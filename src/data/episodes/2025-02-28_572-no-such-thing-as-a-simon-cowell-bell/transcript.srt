00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,320
 - Hey everyone, welcome to this week's episode of Fish.

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:08,320
 Before we get going, we've got a quick, exciting announcement

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,520
 which is that two of our colleagues, Jack and Manu,

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,420
 along with their chef friend, Rosie McKean,

6
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:16,440
 have just launched a brand new podcast

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,120
 called Lunchbox Envy.

8
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,560
 - Yes, it's all the most interesting, weird,

9
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,240
 incredible facts about specific foods.

10
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,800
 Every episode is based around a food stuff,

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,120
 so bananas or garlic or sausages.

12
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,080
 There are a couple of episodes already out now.

13
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,880
 More will be released very soon.

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,040
 They really are fantastic.

15
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,480
 You might have heard Jack and Manu,

16
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:39,080
 the elves on our spin-off show, Meet the Elves.

17
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,280
 They obviously have the bona fide research credentials

18
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,600
 of QILs, and then Rosie really knows

19
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,040
 what she's talking about in the kitchen.

20
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,640
 - I've learned so many amazing things

21
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,440
 off the back of listening to these episodes.

22
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,480
 All the things that they pull out of their Lunchboxes

23
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,200
 make you just go, what the hell is that?

24
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,640
 Jack, for example, pulls out a chocolate garlic bar

25
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,080
 which was used by the British Secret Services in the war.

26
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,400
 I'd never heard of it before.

27
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,440
 You get these amazing, untold histories,

28
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,120
 but also good advice on food.

29
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,440
 - Yes, in fact, as a result,

30
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,360
 I have started slow cooking sausages.

31
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,440
 Find out why.

32
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,680
 The good thing about the good advice is

33
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,920
 they don't just tell you what to do.

34
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,960
 They tell you why certain things work.

35
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,840
 It is jam-packed.

36
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,680
 Jam-packed, yeah, very good.

37
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,760
 Jam-packed with interesting facts

38
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,720
 from why food tastes better if you eat it with your hands.

39
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,560
 There you go, toddlers, you've got it right.

40
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,960
 As to how you can turn peanut butter into diamonds

41
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,800
 and make your fortune, go and listen to it right now.

42
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,440
 Go to qi.com/lunchbox

43
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,720
 or wherever podcasts are available.

44
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,040
 - That's right, so do check it out.

45
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,160
 Lunchbox envy, out now.

46
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,920
 Okay, on with the show.

47
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,680
 (dramatic music)

48
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:49,520
 (upbeat music)

49
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,440
 (speaking in foreign language)

50
00:01:53,440 --> 00:02:00,960
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

51
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,560
 of No Such Thing as a Fish,

52
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,360
 a weekly podcast coming to you

53
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,520
 from the QI offices in Hoburn.

54
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,840
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

55
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,000
 I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,

56
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 Anna Tyshinski, and James Harkin.

57
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,280
 Once again, we have gathered around the microphones

58
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,960
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

59
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,160
 and in a particular order, here we go.

60
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,720
 Starting with fact number one, that is Anna.

61
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,960
 - My fact this week is that every time your heart beats,

62
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,120
 your memory gets worse,

63
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,000
 but you become better at firing a gun.

64
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,240
 - Better at firing a what?

65
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,880
 Sorry, better at firing a gun.

66
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,040
 Better at firing a what?

67
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,040
 - I see, I see what's happening.

68
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,240
 - You see what I'm doing there?

69
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,080
 - Yeah, you expose some obvious flaws in the system.

70
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,240
 - Your heart beats a lot,

71
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,400
 and I don't feel like I lose my memory

72
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,640
 every second in a bit.

73
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,120
 - You are, I think this is useful information to know.

74
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,960
 So if you're ever doing certain things,

75
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,600
 always do it on the offbeat.

76
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,240
 Other things, do it on the onbeat.

77
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:57,160
 And I found this a really interesting study I came across

78
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,280
 about the cardiac cycle, basically,

79
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,200
 which is the cycle of how your heart beats,

80
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,520
 which says that in cisterly, which is when it's beating,

81
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,760
 basically it triggers these barrier receptors,

82
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,400
 which are nerves in your blood vessels,

83
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,960
 which clock that the blood vessel is stretching,

84
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,320
 'cause the heart's just beat, the blood vessel stretches,

85
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,240
 the barrier receptors send a message to the brain going,

86
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,720
 "Right, the blood vessels have stretched.

87
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,640
 "This is how much, this is what's going on."

88
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:23,000
 And it sets off all this activity in your brain

89
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,520
 every time your heart beats.

90
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,000
 And all that activity in your brain,

91
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,720
 which is giving your brain all the information

92
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,880
 about exactly how much your heart's beat,

93
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,080
 how hard, how fast, how much the vessel's expanded,

94
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,000
 that drowns out loads of other stuff

95
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,240
 that's happening in your brain.

96
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,000
 So you get worse at lots of stuff,

97
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,040
 like your memory gets worse.

98
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,720
 - How do they test this, Anna?

99
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,840
 - That's a very good question.

100
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,240
 They rig people up to ECGs

101
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:49,160
 and they do things like really scare them or they--

102
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,360
 - So they have more heartbeats.

103
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,200
 Is that what you mean?

104
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,600
 - No, so they test exactly whether they're on cisterly

105
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,920
 or diastole, if their heart's beating or not beating,

106
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,680
 and then they scare them with something,

107
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,120
 and if their heart's on an on beat,

108
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,120
 then their reaction will be slightly slower

109
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,320
 than their heartbeats. - Like reaction times.

110
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,320
 - Yeah, and they had people in a rifle range

111
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,040
 and they logged them up to ECGs and they did the same thing.

112
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:10,880
 - I've got two questions.

113
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,960
 One, memory, is this long-term memory

114
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,600
 or is it memory in the moment that it's making worse?

115
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,560
 - It's memory in the moment.

116
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,720
 So I think they'd say, what's Ernzo's name?

117
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,200
 What's the name of the person who was that next to you

118
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,880
 yesterday, Dan, and then on the on beat,

119
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,720
 you'd be a bit less--

120
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,000
 - Dan is not gonna remember that.

121
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,440
 - Any circle step is.

122
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:30,000
 - Question two was to do with the gun.

123
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,800
 So I'd read a study a while ago,

124
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,240
 which is that apparently snipers

125
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,360
 like to take their shot in between heartbeats.

126
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,320
 - How interesting.

127
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,800
 - Yeah, so they've been doing it wrong.

128
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,240
 - Yeah, that's why they keep missing.

129
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,560
 - Yes, that's why they keep missing.

130
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,680
 - Yeah, well, it's a technique that they do,

131
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,520
 which is it's a bit of meditation prior to it.

132
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,640
 Slow breathing, they time the shot.

133
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,040
 Apparently if your heartbeat is raised

134
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,280
 and it's much higher than the blood pressure

135
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,240
 on your trigger finger, like pulses will come in there,

136
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,520
 it might make you pull a shot slightly differently.

137
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,000
 - If you ever watch Biaflon,

138
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,600
 which is cross country skiing and then shooting.

139
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,560
 - Not at the same time.

140
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,400
 - Not at the same time.

141
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,320
 And that is the critical point

142
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,600
 because your heart rate gets really, really high

143
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,200
 because you're doing this really big exercise

144
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,720
 and then you have to shoot.

145
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,920
 And the best players, the best people

146
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,000
 like Johannes Tingersboro, people like that,

147
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,840
 he would like really lower, lower, lower his heart rate.

148
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,800
 And you can see it, they often have it on the screen.

149
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,200
 It'll say what their heart rate is

150
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,280
 and you can see it going down, down, down,

151
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,520
 and they won't shoot immediately.

152
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:31,200
 They'll let the heartbeat go down and then they'll shoot.

153
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,440
 - That's really cool.

154
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,760
 So they do, okay, yeah.

155
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,600
 - And that makes sense to make the heartbeat go down, I guess,

156
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,840
 'cause you're more focused, you're more relaxed.

157
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,280
 I've watched my own heartbeat during surgery.

158
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,120
 - What?

159
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,440
 As in the actual heart itself?

160
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,160
 - No, I haven't seen my physical heart pumping away.

161
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,560
 I mean, on a screen, I was having a minor operation

162
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,560
 which I was allowed to stay awake for.

163
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,040
 And you can see it.

164
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,240
 And they sort of accidentally left the screen

165
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,520
 like pointing a bit at my face.

166
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,880
 So I was trying to muck around and speed it up

167
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,720
 and slow it down.

168
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,560
 It's great fun.

169
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,400
 - Were they inside,

170
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,480
 they have something inside your body?

171
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,320
 You said that actually.

172
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,400
 - Oh yeah, oh yeah.

173
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,120
 - But you didn't have an open heart surgery, did you?

174
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,840
 - No, I said a minor operation.

175
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,000
 I like to play it cool,

176
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,360
 but even I would probably say

177
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,440
 that's a medium-sized operation.

178
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,000
 - And when they actually put the extension in your penis,

179
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,720
 did your heart rate go up or it made that noise

180
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,720
 like a slide or something.

181
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:27,520
 - Can I just say the potential reason for this,

182
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,840
 evolutionarily, which I also think is really cool.

183
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,680
 And just to let you know,

184
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,560
 is that when your heart doesn't beat,

185
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,640
 your sensitivity to pain goes down.

186
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,080
 You have a worse memory for words,

187
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,760
 your concentration is less good,

188
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,120
 you've got higher fear response,

189
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,280
 so you're more afraid, more intense reaction,

190
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,360
 but your reactions are slower.

191
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,800
 And then on the offbeat,

192
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,480
 you have a stronger grip,

193
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,640
 so you're stronger,

194
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,760
 you're more accurate at firing a gun,

195
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,960
 and your eyes flicker around more.

196
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,880
 And weirdly, I didn't know what happens is

197
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,360
 when you're under threat,

198
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,720
 what do you think happens to your heart rate?

199
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,200
 - Speeds up, speeds up.

200
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,040
 - Incorrect.

201
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,880
 - What?

202
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,160
 - Isn't this incredible?

203
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,200
 Immediately after you're under threat,

204
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,720
 usually your heartbeat for a second slows down.

205
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,880
 Apparently, in an evolutionary sense,

206
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,200
 and that's because for a second,

207
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,880
 it needs to be on the offbeat more often.

208
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,000
 So when your heartbeat goes slower,

209
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,120
 it's more often on the offbeat,

210
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,160
 so that you can have fast reactions

211
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,240
 and process information more.

212
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,960
 So you process everything around you,

213
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,640
 and then it speeds up a lot,

214
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,960
 because as soon as you've done that,

215
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,240
 then it's on the onbeat,

216
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,000
 and then you're really good at firing a gun,

217
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 or punching someone, or gripping something.

218
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,400
 - I would've thought it would be a part of

219
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,400
 just trying to be quiet, like more quiet,

220
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,160
 so they don't find you.

221
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,480
 Not having that pumping heartbeat.

222
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,200
 - Just as psychologically, you'd be like,

223
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,080
 you can hear, you know, you'd be like,

224
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,200
 - Can I just ask for clarification?

225
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,160
 If your heartbeat slows down,

226
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,880
 and you go from 100 beats to 50 beats,

227
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:51,680
 that means you also have 50 offbeats in a minute.

228
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,600
 So does that not mean you have fewer offbeats

229
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,920
 as opposed to more?

230
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,920
 - I think it's more time is spent on an off,

231
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,600
 so you've got a longer offbeat,

232
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,680
 'cause like an onbeat is always going to be

233
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,440
 the same amount of time your heart takes to go,

234
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,640
 but to pump the blood out, right?

235
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,640
 But then between them, there's a longer gap.

236
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,440
 - So the offbeat is actually the gap

237
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,720
 between your heart pumping and not pumping.

238
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,120
 - Exactly.

239
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,520
 And this was only in one study that it said,

240
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,120
 usually the fear response causes your heart

241
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,760
 to immediately slow down and speed up,

242
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,320
 and I couldn't find it many other places,

243
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,440
 but I thought that was fascinating.

244
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,800
 - That was very cool.

245
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,160
 Heartbeats are something that I didn't realize

246
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,320
 play quite a feature role in the world of music.

247
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:33,240
 - Heartbeats is a single by steps.

248
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,080
 But there you go.

249
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,920
 - Is that what you're thinking?

250
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:35,760
 - That's not what I'm thinking.

251
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,640
 I mean, artists recording their heartbeats

252
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,000
 or their of their children and putting them into songs

253
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,360
 have been used multiple times.

254
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,400
 You've get them in print songs in John Lennon,

255
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:50,800
 very sadly released it as part of an ultrasound heartbeat

256
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,960
 to a child that unfortunately didn't make it full term,

257
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,800
 but so many bands.

258
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,760
 Max Cavallera from Sepultura, he did it.

259
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,520
 Interestingly, Taylor Swift did it for one of her songs, right?

260
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:07,720
 And it was a song that was re-recorded as you might remember,

261
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,320
 Taylor Swift had this huge moment

262
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:13,040
 whereby she had her manager claim all of her music.

263
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,720
 So she went and re-recorded every single album.

264
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,560
 - I do remember.

265
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,840
 - So one of these songs contains her heartbeat.

266
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:22,760
 So she had to replicate the sound recording of her heartbeat.

267
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,360
 So she's got twice recorded heartbeats into tracks,

268
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,560
 but they all get listed in the song credits

269
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,120
 on heartbeat, Taylor Swift.

270
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,080
 - Very nice.

271
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,600
 - So it means you get more money.

272
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,800
 - Yeah, exactly.

273
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,000
 - That's like Phil Collins.

274
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,400
 Do you remember Phil Collins, didn't he do an album

275
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,360
 where it was all Phil Collins?

276
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,960
 And I think he put himself in the credits as everything.

277
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,120
 - So he played like the kazoo when he played it.

278
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,360
 (all laughing)

279
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:48,000
 - Huge kazoo guy, Collins, yeah, yeah.

280
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,920
 - You can't just add more on,

281
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,920
 you can't just add a triangle

282
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,440
 and get paid a whole extra bit, can't you?

283
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,960
 - Well, you can, that's the whole idea.

284
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,600
 So Simon Cowell, that was a story

285
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,400
 that he would play a minor instrument,

286
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,040
 like one cowbell noise,

287
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,680
 and that would be writer's credits on the songs

288
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,080
 to all his audits that he would get.

289
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,320
 - And that's why we renamed it the cowbell.

290
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,320
 But no one knows.

291
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,160
 - It's so beautiful.

292
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,000
 - It's so beautiful.

293
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,520
 - Very good.

294
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,280
 - When your heart rate synchronizes,

295
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,560
 we've briefly mentioned before, I think,

296
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:15,600
 that it's choirs, their heartbeats all synchronized.

297
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,440
 It's pretty cool.

298
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,280
 - That is cool.

299
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:20,080
 - When you go to the theater,

300
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,680
 your heart also synchronizes with the people around you.

301
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,560
 And it lasts into the interval.

302
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,960
 Everyone goes out into the interval,

303
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,280
 with their hearts speeding up,

304
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,280
 sort of going at the same rate.

305
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,320
 - I wonder why we all go to the toilet

306
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,720
 at exactly the same moment

307
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,600
 when there's like five minutes left before the second half.

308
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,080
 'Cause our hearts is the problem, isn't it?

309
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:37,920
 - It's the problem.

310
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,400
 - But so that's saying that a movie has a heart rate.

311
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,080
 - Yes, it does.

312
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,480
 - So you could actually probably,

313
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,800
 you know we talked before about how you could do CPR,

314
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,040
 singing a certain type of song,

315
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,000
 because it's the right BPM in order to do it.

316
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,880
 There probably is, like, if you want to go to a movie

317
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,480
 that puts you on this heart rate.

318
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,880
 - No, 'cause it'll go up and down.

319
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,680
 So you'd be caught if it was Titanic, you know,

320
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,760
 as the ship cracks in half,

321
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,520
 you suddenly have to double the rate of CPR.

322
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,920
 - Oh yeah, but I'm sure there's some like,

323
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,160
 how long are you going to do? - How long are you going to do?

324
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,640
 - Movies where you can just sit for...

325
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,360
 - If you're like, if it's something really tedious,

326
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,800
 like June two, you can just sit all the way through it.

327
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,000
 - That's too slow, the person would die.

328
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,080
 - But if it's something really exciting, yeah, then...

329
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,000
 I mean, you don't need to do it for long.

330
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,320
 How long do you need to do CPR for normally?

331
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,160
 If you...

332
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,000
 - It's all the way through.

333
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,400
 - Okay, yeah, I've done 45 seconds now.

334
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,520
 I'm afraid we've watched the whole

335
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,200
 of the climactic fight scene in Gladiator,

336
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,200
 so I am going to be clocking off, yeah.

337
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,800
 Pig hearts, you know how we were all going to get

338
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,120
 pig hearts a while ago? - Oh yeah.

339
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:33,960
 - That was going to be the big thing.

340
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,080
 - I know, I was so excited.

341
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,560
 - It's so complicated, the process.

342
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,320
 'Cause basically pigs are very similar to people

343
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,760
 in lots of ways physiologically.

344
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,600
 And there was an idea that we were going to be able

345
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,360
 to transplant pig hearts into people.

346
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,800
 And that was going to be, 'cause there are loads of pigs,

347
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,080
 I mean, there are hundreds of millions of pigs

348
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,600
 around the world. - Sure, just sitting there

349
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,240
 with their hearts beating away and around, oink oink.

350
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,840
 - We're not using them for anything, right?

351
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,680
 - Exactly.

352
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,880
 - So let's steal their hearts for us.

353
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,280
 It's pretty sinister as a species.

354
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,160
 Anyway, but it turns out you have to do so much stuff,

355
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,240
 you have to make the pig more human before you do this.

356
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,080
 - How do you do that?

357
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:07,920
 Dress it up.

358
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,280
 - Give it a newspaper.

359
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,520
 - Sprig it to the movies.

360
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,400
 - Like grandma, what big trotters you have?

361
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:17,760
 Yeah, it's so, no, you can't just take a,

362
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,640
 like take a heart out of a pig and shove it in the person.

363
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,040
 You have to take a pig, right?

364
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:25,080
 Remove three of its genes, knock out some growth hormones.

365
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,280
 - So you have to dress it up.

366
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,160
 - Knock out some growth hormones.

367
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,240
 Add a couple of other genes.

368
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,040
 Then you have to keep the pig nice and clean,

369
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,920
 so it doesn't get any pig bacteria.

370
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,560
 Then you breed from that pig and you make these GM embryos,

371
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,400
 you put them in surrogate cells,

372
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,480
 and then you have to give the mummy pig a C-section

373
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,800
 so that it doesn't get contaminated at all.

374
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,600
 And then those piglets have to be bred up

375
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,440
 until they're big enough.

376
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,280
 - Wow.

377
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,520
 - And those are then the sort of a bit more human pigs.

378
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,000
 They've had no contact with the outside world,

379
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,560
 no external viruses.

380
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,400
 Those are the ones that--

381
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,800
 - And has anyone ever had this?

382
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,640
 - I think two people have, and they both didn't survive.

383
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,280
 - Well, one of them built a house out of straw,

384
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,800
 the other one built a house out of sticks,

385
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,640
 and they never made it.

386
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,120
 - No wonder we don't use it.

387
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,040
 You got to, it's like, we found a match,

388
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,320
 we now just have to get it pregnant.

389
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,120
 - By it didn't first.

390
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,440
 - Let it birth some, and then take their hearts.

391
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,680
 - Anna's right, a couple of people have had it,

392
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,480
 but I think it didn't, it didn't--

393
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,680
 - I think the reason is like hearts in all mammals

394
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,000
 are kind of the same, aren't they really?

395
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,840
 - Right.

396
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,160
 - They all work the same way with electrical impulses,

397
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,080
 and they have sodium and potassium

398
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,520
 that make the electricity happen,

399
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,800
 and they're all kind of the same, so that's the idea.

400
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,120
 - Is it right that we have a billion beats, all mammals?

401
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:34,960
 - Three billion.

402
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,720
 - We've got roughly the same number, yeah.

403
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,680
 - Humans get about three billion.

404
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,760
 Humans get a bit more, basically,

405
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,560
 'cause our life is longer because we have invented indoors.

406
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:44,600
 And indoors is a more relaxing environment, and--

407
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,480
 - But like we're similar enough

408
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,960
 that we have roughly the same--

409
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,200
 - You do, but it's not like you have that number.

410
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,120
 Like Donald Trump thinks that you have a certain number,

411
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,720
 and if you use them up, then that's when you die.

412
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,520
 And that's why he doesn't like to do any exercise

413
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,320
 apart from play golf.

414
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,320
 And I think a few other famous people have thought that.

415
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,880
 Maybe Neil Armstrong thought that.

416
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,520
 - I think, I think, yeah, yeah, no, there's a quote.

417
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,000
 I think they've looked into it.

418
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,840
 - Maybe as a joke, he said, "You only get a certain amount,

419
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,160
 "and I'm down if I'm gonna use all mine

420
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,280
 "running up and down the street."

421
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,940
 - Oh, well, that's a funny line.

422
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,520
 - That's interesting, when you're playing golf,

423
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,480
 because it is reduced, is it better to play in the gaps?

424
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,120
 - Well, you know what, I'd never thought that before,

425
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,800
 but I'm gonna try that next time on the course.

426
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,240
 - Yeah, I think that's why small animals

427
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,080
 don't live as long, isn't it?

428
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,680
 'Cause as a small animal, you have to,

429
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,440
 your heart beats faster and so use them up.

430
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,920
 - I got one last thing before we move on.

431
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,440
 Have you guys heard of the Intimacy 2.0 dress?

432
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,480
 - No.

433
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,120
 - No, okay, let me guess.

434
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,800
 It's a dress you wear.

435
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,640
 - Correct.

436
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:39,120
 - And two people wear it, and it syncs your heartbeats,

437
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,720
 and it changes color with the heartbeats

438
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,520
 so you can see that each is flashing at the same time

439
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,360
 and that you're in sync.

440
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,800
 - Is it like a dress version of paddles, basically?

441
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,800
 (all laugh)

442
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,760
 - Aggressively stops your heart and restarts in that,

443
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,320
 tell you what I'm saying.

444
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,160
 - No, no.

445
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,800
 - Does it change color?

446
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:59,120
 Does it go transparent if your heart rate rises?

447
00:14:59,120 --> 00:14:59,960
 - There we go.

448
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,040
 - Is that what Kanye West's partner was wearing?

449
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,520
 She was just so excited to be at the Grammys.

450
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,600
 Her heart was going 10 a second.

451
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,600
 - But it's basically that.

452
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,920
 So it's a dress that you would wear.

453
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,520
 Obviously no one is wearing this, as far as I can tell.

454
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,040
 And it's got a neckline that plunges to the midriff,

455
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:17,300
 which if your heart rate rises and you're out on a date,

456
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:20,880
 it slowly makes the dress more transparent around these,

457
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,840
 yeah, sort of like the cleavage area and so on,

458
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,800
 in order to, yeah.

459
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,360
 So it's just enhancing.

460
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,800
 - In the woods, you're wearing it

461
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,560
 and you're threatened by a lion.

462
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,720
 Now the lion's seen your naked flesh exposed.

463
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,000
 That makes the duration even worse.

464
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,080
 - Well, fortunately, when you're panicked,

465
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,040
 your heart rate goes down.

466
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,000
 So you should be fine.

467
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,840
 - Good point.

468
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,200
 - Have you learned nothing from this section?

469
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,040
 - Where'd she go?

470
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,040
 (all laugh)

471
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,620
 (upbeat music)

472
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:46,680
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two

473
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,580
 and that is James.

474
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:51,220
 - Okay, my fact this week is that in 2023,

475
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,500
 a team mapping the ocean floor

476
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:57,460
 announced they may have found Amelia Earhart's plane.

477
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:00,180
 In 2024, they announced it was actually

478
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,700
 a plane-shaped pile of rocks.

479
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:03,540
 (all laugh)

480
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:04,700
 - Could they not have looked a bit closer

481
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,940
 the first time round?

482
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:06,780
 Got a second opinion.

483
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:07,620
 - It's at the bottom of the sea, Anna.

484
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:08,460
 - Ah, it's very hot.

485
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:12,060
 It's amazing they found such a plane-shaped pile of rocks.

486
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:14,380
 It would have been cool if they had just announced

487
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,760
 we found a wicked pile of rocks shaped like a plane down there.

488
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,600
 - Yeah.

489
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,420
 - But they had to go a bit further

490
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,480
 and say it's one of the most famous lost planes ever.

491
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,360
 - Yeah, so this is Amelia Earhart.

492
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,000
 We've mentioned her once or twice before.

493
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,760
 She was flying around the world in 1937

494
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,400
 and she was about 100 miles from a place

495
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,360
 called Howland Island, which is in Kiribati.

496
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,520
 And she started running out of fuel

497
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,120
 and we never heard from her again, basically.

498
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,920
 She gave one last radio call and then disappeared

499
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,760
 and for the subsequent 90 years,

500
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,540
 people have been wondering what's happened to her.

501
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:46,380
 - Yeah.

502
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,420
 And she was really, she was well-famous wasn't she?

503
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:49,260
 - Oh yeah, yeah.

504
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:51,780
 - Incredibly celebrated aviate tricks.

505
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:54,060
 - Yeah, prior to the disappearance as well, which is-

506
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:54,900
 - Yeah, absolutely.

507
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,580
 - Often sometimes these things make you.

508
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:59,260
 - She broke in so many records and things like that

509
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,420
 and she'd done a lot of trips,

510
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,580
 which was the first time a woman might have made those flights

511
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:03,420
 and things like that.

512
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:04,260
 She was amazing.

513
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,460
 - And this is a group called Deepsea Vision,

514
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,660
 the CEO, Tony Romeo,

515
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:11,300
 who's a former U.S. Air Force intelligence officer,

516
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,180
 said that they'd found these.

517
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,020
 (laughs)

518
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,280
 Rocks said that they found this plane

519
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,800
 or what they thought was a plane

520
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,960
 and then they've done a bit more work

521
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,040
 and they realized that it is some rocks.

522
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:23,320
 And Tony said, "Talk about the cruelest formation

523
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,080
 "ever created by nature."

524
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:25,920
 - Yeah.

525
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,760
 - And I can only agree.

526
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,600
 - 'Cause it was, yeah,

527
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,720
 it's a hundred miles from Holland Island, right?

528
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,720
 So if you see a plane shape.

529
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,560
 - I don't mean to be morbid,

530
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,880
 but when a plane hits the water,

531
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,840
 it often, especially a 1930s plane,

532
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,560
 it might not stay looking like a pristine plane

533
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,360
 all the way to the ocean bottom, you know?

534
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,200
 - Absolutely.

535
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,720
 And what were they using to see it?

536
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,460
 Was it like a sonar thing that sent back a vague shape?

537
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:45,740
 - The image does look pretty good.

538
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:46,580
 - Is it very plain?

539
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,020
 - Oh yeah, it's even got a little tail fin on it.

540
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,520
 - Yeah, it looks very plain like.

541
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,360
 - Does it?

542
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,500
 - It was a huge search for her at the time.

543
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,980
 As in, the U.S. Navy did a lot of searching.

544
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:57,340
 They even sent, I think, an aircraft carrier

545
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:00,260
 to the region, which had 63 aircraft on it.

546
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:03,340
 So, you know, all those planes can go out making trips.

547
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:04,700
 - I thought you meant like an empty one,

548
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:07,140
 optimistically hoping to carry her aircraft back.

549
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:07,980
 (laughs)

550
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:10,900
 - Yeah, and it cost them about four million U.S. dollars

551
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:14,000
 at the time, it was about 90 million U.S. dollars today.

552
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,280
 This, and of course they didn't find her.

553
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,640
 And actually that became kind of the end

554
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,800
 of celebrity aviation because at that time,

555
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,440
 the loads of celebrity flyers who were doing loads

556
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,560
 of crazy stunts and everyone that they're on the front page

557
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:30,200
 of all the newspapers, but when Emilia Earhart disappeared,

558
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,640
 Congress decided to make it illegal for the Navy

559
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,840
 to spend any money on search and rescue.

560
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,760
 And when they did that, everyone just stopped

561
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,600
 carrying a little bit.

562
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,440
 - Wow.

563
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,280
 - Yeah, there were all these psychics who were claiming

564
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,820
 that they were in touch with her.

565
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,940
 And the family were looking for anything.

566
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:45,540
 So, they were going to see psychics

567
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,220
 and hoping to follow up on things.

568
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,860
 There was this story that we mentioned briefly,

569
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,700
 which was the Tokyo Rose story.

570
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,860
 It's the idea that the Japanese had got hold

571
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,780
 of Emilia Earhart, she was captured,

572
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:57,500
 and she was putting out propaganda radio news

573
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,820
 about what was going on in the war.

574
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,460
 - So, Tokyo Rose was real, right?

575
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,300
 - Yeah.

576
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,820
 - That was actually, but they were saying that that was her.

577
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:03,860
 - That was, they were saying it was her,

578
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:05,980
 but what's interesting is her husband,

579
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,900
 'cause she was married, Emilia Earhart,

580
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:08,940
 to a guy called George Putnam.

581
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,480
 He actually made a three-day trek

582
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,560
 through a Japanese-held territory

583
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,600
 so that he could get to a US Marine radio station

584
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,720
 to confirm whether or not it was her voice.

585
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,360
 So, it was taken really seriously,

586
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,760
 even by the immediate family, some of these,

587
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,600
 some of these theories.

588
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,440
 - I think that was one of the ones

589
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,200
 that vaguely sane people believe.

590
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,040
 - Yeah.

591
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,240
 - The person who was in charge of the island.

592
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,920
 I have to say, I find that Emilia Earhart searches,

593
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,120
 I have a real blank like with Jack the Ripper on them.

594
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,960
 I'm like, "God, get a life, guys."

595
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,360
 A lot of them, no offence.

596
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,200
 - Interesting.

597
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,760
 - Also, welcome to the podcast.

598
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,580
 We appreciate you listening.

599
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:41,900
 - It's interesting you've made these people your bet noir.

600
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:42,740
 - I don't know why.

601
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:43,860
 - The people, relatively blind-minded people,

602
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,700
 trying to solve a classic mystery.

603
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,100
 - New enemies of the podcast.

604
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:47,940
 - Yeah.

605
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,260
 - I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

606
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,620
 You can buy stuff from their website.

607
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,060
 Look, I'll advertise for them.

608
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:54,780
 They sell little, they sell t-shirts, they sell badges.

609
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:57,140
 If you wanna help fund their expeditions,

610
00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:01,060
 each trip costs up to $500,000 to go and uncover

611
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:03,860
 another rusty jackknife or compact mirror in the ocean

612
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:05,620
 that you say belong to Emilia Earhart.

613
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:06,460
 - Sounds good.

614
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,300
 - Okay.

615
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,520
 - So just on sort of the ocean

616
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,560
 and the mysteries of the ocean.

617
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:14,340
 Something that I read about, which is a big problem

618
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:19,040
 for a lot of boats out in the open sea now, is UFOs.

619
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:19,880
 - Oh, no.

620
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:24,760
 - Unidentified floating objects.

621
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,640
 So this is to do with container ships.

622
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,360
 And container ships, when they're in rough seas,

623
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:31,040
 they can lose, so many containers have gone missing.

624
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:34,040
 There was an estimate between 1985 and 2007,

625
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:37,080
 five to six million container units

626
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:37,920
 would be floating--

627
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,740
 - Wow, it's mental.

628
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:39,580
 - Yeah, and--

629
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:40,420
 - Do they all float?

630
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,420
 - They do for a while, so they can for a few weeks.

631
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,580
 If a container is up to 80% full,

632
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:46,580
 then you've got enough air in there for it to,

633
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,780
 but they're not airtight,

634
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:50,580
 so they will eventually seep water and go down.

635
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,940
 So a lot of ships just say that if they're out,

636
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,900
 these come out of nowhere, 'cause they're not mapped right.

637
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:58,620
 So you're dodging UFOs all the way through the ocean.

638
00:20:58,620 --> 00:20:59,460
 - Wow.

639
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,180
 - Yeah, we're just constantly losing giant containers

640
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,740
 off the back of ships.

641
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:05,540
 - Other mysterious things in the ocean.

642
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,780
 - Yeah, yeah.

643
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,960
 - Well, one big ocean mystery is,

644
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,660
 you know all the plastic in the ocean?

645
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:11,940
 - Yes, yeah.

646
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,100
 - Well, where is it?

647
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:13,940
 - In the ocean.

648
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:14,780
 - It's not nearly enough there.

649
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:16,040
 - It's in the garbage patch, isn't it?

650
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,360
 - Well, not nearly enough, James.

651
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,200
 - What do you mean?

652
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,880
 - Let's get more in there, guys.

653
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,220
 - Yeah, what is the problem you're trying to solve here?

654
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,200
 - This plastic.

655
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,460
 - It's in animals.

656
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:26,080
 - No, we don't know, so you,

657
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,800
 well, we're starting to find out,

658
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,400
 but basically 99% of the plastic

659
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,920
 that should be in the ocean is not in the ocean.

660
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,760
 We keep on looking,

661
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,240
 and most of what is there is in the garbage patch,

662
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,620
 but a lot of that is kind of old plastic,

663
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:40,460
 and we don't know where the newer plastic's gone,

664
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:41,780
 whereas you'd think the older plastic

665
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:43,660
 would be the stuff that degrades, if anything,

666
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,380
 and is getting smaller and disappearing.

667
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:48,380
 - So when you say it's not there, sorry, what do you mean?

668
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:51,220
 - So in the surveys that we've done of the ocean,

669
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:53,580
 looking at how much ocean plastic there is,

670
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,780
 we haven't found nearly enough to equate

671
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:59,300
 with how much we estimate we've been flushing into the ocean,

672
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,780
 and it's called dark plastic,

673
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,180
 and they equate it with dark matter.

674
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,580
 - I knew, I knew.

675
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:05,380
 The climate change was a hoax

676
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:07,560
 in this whole environmental push.

677
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,640
 I knew it.

678
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,480
 - It's actually not,

679
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,080
 it's only quite for the climate change,

680
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,180
 but it's not quite the same.

681
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,020
 - Yeah, but that's crazy.

682
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,660
 - So is this scary, Anna?

683
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:16,980
 'Cause presumably it's somewhere bad.

684
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:19,640
 - No, it's actually somewhere good.

685
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,580
 I think the latest research shows,

686
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,580
 and this is great news.

687
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:25,220
 - Anna, this is a roller coaster of the fair.

688
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:28,180
 - I like to keep your heart beats fluctuating.

689
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:31,300
 The latest research is a guy called Lauren Lebriton,

690
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:34,280
 who's an oceanographer who ran this big computer model,

691
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,260
 looking at how the plastic that we know about

692
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:38,240
 gets distributed, where it lands in the ocean,

693
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,820
 where it floats to and stuff.

694
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:42,860
 He's concluded that the vast majority

695
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:44,820
 of macro plastics and micro plastics,

696
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,260
 so big and small bits,

697
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:48,300
 rather than being lost in the middle of the ocean

698
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,940
 or deep down where we don't know,

699
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:52,220
 they actually all wash up on beaches

700
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:54,860
 on a buried in shorelines or a right on the coastline.

701
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:55,700
 - Interesting.

702
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:56,880
 - Which to me says, great,

703
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,740
 I always thought we can't get that plastic back.

704
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,580
 I can't row out to sea and get it back.

705
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:02,140
 But if all you need to do is go to a beach.

706
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,100
 - That's great, we just need to pick up

707
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,540
 the baby turtles it's choked to death on the beach.

708
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:06,380
 - Well, it's amazing.

709
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:08,580
 - Under the beach is the lug worms who are getting it back.

710
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:09,420
 - Oh no.

711
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:10,880
 - I know the lug, the poor lugs.

712
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,720
 No one talks about them.

713
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,540
 - And it's gonna turn out the lug worms

714
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:15,340
 with a keystone species keeping this whole thing going,

715
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,500
 and we'll be sorry.

716
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,660
 That's really interesting though.

717
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:19,500
 - It just seems more accessible, doesn't it?

718
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,440
 - Does it make it easier for us to deal with

719
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,960
 if we can work out technologies to do that?

720
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,000
 I understand animals will die, obviously, but like.

721
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,660
 - I think really the problem is stopping it

722
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,240
 from entering the oceans in the first place.

723
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,080
 - Yeah.

724
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,320
 - But I mean, I think once it gets to the coast,

725
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,960
 to me, I mean, this is new research,

726
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,220
 but it seems like it would be easier to access

727
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,780
 once it's not in the middle of nowhere.

728
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:37,820
 It looks like it.

729
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:40,180
 So get to your beach, people, with a bucket and spade.

730
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,220
 - Yeah, nice.

731
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:43,180
 - Have you guys heard of dark oxygen?

732
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,220
 (laughing)

733
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:45,320
 - Dark oxygen.

734
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,020
 - Dark oxygen.

735
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:49,820
 - So by extension, it's, there's not as much oxygen

736
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:50,980
 as we thought there should be.

737
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:51,820
 - Yeah.

738
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:53,660
 - And some of it's missing.

739
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,820
 - This is stuff that's found on the ocean floor.

740
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:56,660
 - Yeah.

741
00:23:56,660 --> 00:24:01,580
 - And it's produced this dark oxygen by battery rocks.

742
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:02,420
 - Okay.

743
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:04,880
 - These are the nodules, metallic nodules

744
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,640
 that are all over huge chunks of the ocean floor

745
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:12,120
 around the world, and they make oxygen without light.

746
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,400
 They do it chemically.

747
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,400
 So they split the water molecules around them

748
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,200
 into hydrogen and oxygen.

749
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,800
 So that's insane.

750
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,960
 I mean, that's the source of oxygen.

751
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,160
 - Yeah, it's like putting an electric,

752
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,920
 like we would make on a chemistry lesson.

753
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,760
 - Electrolysis.

754
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,600
 - It's crackers.

755
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,440
 Yeah, yeah.

756
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,800
 - Are these connected to ocean farts?

757
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,640
 - No.

758
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,480
 (laughing)

759
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,200
 - Walk in one of those in a minute.

760
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,360
 - I just love the idea of having me doing a lecture

761
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,440
 and dancing on the front row with questions like,

762
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,600
 if you could put your hand down until we end up.

763
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,960
 (laughing)

764
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:46,040
 - We will have a question and answer session by in writing.

765
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,280
 (laughing)

766
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:52,240
 - Go on, please go on.

767
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,600
 - How can I possibly continue talking about something

768
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,120
 really interesting when you say, about ocean farts?

769
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,840
 And that's how the disruptive kids do it.

770
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:01,680
 - Yeah.

771
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,040
 This is why no one learns anything.

772
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:03,880
 - Yeah.

773
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,720
 - Yeah.

774
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,540
 No, it's just interesting

775
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:07,320
 'cause there's a huge debate at the moment.

776
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,400
 I'm sure you're all keeping up with it

777
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,400
 in the International Seabed Authority

778
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,920
 about ocean mining the ocean floor.

779
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,760
 Are we going to do it?

780
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,320
 Should we definitely not do it?

781
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,760
 And...

782
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,840
 - Well, the problem is,

783
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,040
 one of the big problems is,

784
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,960
 obviously logically you say we shouldn't do it,

785
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,480
 but it contains so much stuff like lithium

786
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,320
 that you need.

787
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,440
 If everyone's gonna have an electric car,

788
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:29,200
 you need these minerals and where you're gonna get them from.

789
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,440
 So it's like this weird sort of balance.

790
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,480
 - Do you get them from land,

791
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,840
 which we know causes some damage,

792
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:34,880
 do we get them from the ocean,

793
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,080
 where we really have no idea what effect it would have.

794
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,720
 - It might be none.

795
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,800
 - Might be absolutely fine.

796
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,120
 Why not just do it, assuming it'll be none.

797
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,720
 - That's really big, the ocean, isn't it?

798
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,680
 - Oh, it's huge, yeah.

799
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,640
 So, but it is a really big debate at the moment.

800
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,760
 - So, wait, these batteries,

801
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:51,760
 how are they, are we mining these big ocean floor batteries?

802
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,560
 - These are the nodules that people want to mine

803
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,160
 because they contain these metals.

804
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,880
 And so it's being debated at the moment.

805
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,880
 And it was found in a study,

806
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,240
 which was funded by a mining firm,

807
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,560
 which is desperate to mine the ocean.

808
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,400
 And then it turned out,

809
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,080
 oh, these might be a really important source of oxygen

810
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,160
 for all kinds of life.

811
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,160
 And so they were furious

812
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,920
 that they'd accidentally funded this study.

813
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,120
 - One of the problem is that they are mostly found

814
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,600
 in something that's called silicious ooze.

815
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:16,320
 Silicious ooze is this kind of really low sediment

816
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,920
 at the bottom of the ocean,

817
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:20,520
 but it accumulates about one to three millimeters

818
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,600
 every thousand years.

819
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,400
 So once you dig it up, it's going to take a while to get back.

820
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,000
 - Oh, 'cause we're probably going to dig faster than that.

821
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,080
 'Cause we dig faster than one to three millimeters, don't we?

822
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,200
 - My company is suggesting that we will do faster than that.

823
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,400
 - And I've invested, so.

824
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,240
 - Interesting.

825
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,480
 - Well, there is one kind of ocean drilling, which is good.

826
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,640
 And that's the scientific research kind.

827
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,840
 And the first mission was really cool.

828
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,960
 It was in 1957, and it was organized

829
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:49,200
 by this group called the American Miscellaneous Society.

830
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,160
 - I love them already.

831
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,120
 - They are so cool.

832
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,200
 They're like the ignobles of their time.

833
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,400
 They were a bunch of geologists and oceanographers

834
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:58,240
 who just wanted to get together and have weird ideas.

835
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,880
 Anyway, there was this thing called Project Moho,

836
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,360
 which they started,

837
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:06,080
 which was to investigate the Mohorovich discontinuity.

838
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,280
 - It sounds sci-fi, doesn't it?

839
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,120
 - Yeah.

840
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,960
 - The Mohorovich discontinuity

841
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,160
 has been producing dark oxygen.

842
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,920
 - It does sound like someone who thought,

843
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,760
 I'm going to write it as a Russian name.

844
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,680
 And they go, no, no, that's not Russian enough.

845
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,800
 Let's put another it to the end.

846
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,800
 There are too many O's and too many itches in it,

847
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,200
 for me, to be honest.

848
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,640
 But that's this bit between the crust of the Earth

849
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,520
 and the mantle,

850
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,880
 where suddenly seismic waves start moving much faster.

851
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,680
 And it was the only reason we knew back then

852
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,080
 that there was an Earth's crust.

853
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,000
 So these guys, the Miscellaneous Society,

854
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,640
 were like, well, let's go and dig into the ocean

855
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,600
 and find out what's happening.

856
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,800
 It ended up being a failure,

857
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,720
 but it started off this thing that happens today,

858
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,840
 a lot where we dig into the ocean floor

859
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,120
 and pull up all these cores

860
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,720
 and find out loads of cool stuff.

861
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,640
 And the person who came along with them to write about it,

862
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,080
 and to report about it,

863
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:56,280
 was oceanography fan and big lover of the sea,

864
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,200
 taking a guess.

865
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,400
 - James Cameron.

866
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,840
 - Ah, he, I think in a former life,

867
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,040
 maybe this is who he was.

868
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:02,960
 - Jack Cousteau.

869
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,800
 - In '57.

870
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,640
 - Ooh, Jack Cousteau.

871
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,120
 - Yeah, no.

872
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,440
 Oh, I can give you a clue by saying,

873
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,720
 one of the lesser books he wrote

874
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,000
 was called Steinbeck and Ricketts Sea of Cortez.

875
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,200
 - So John Steinbeck.

876
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,320
 - So it was John Steinbeck.

877
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,920
 (all laughing)

878
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:21,160
 - He absolutely loved the sea and oceanography.

879
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,000
 - Really?

880
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,480
 - So he hopped on board this research boat

881
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,320
 and recourse for it.

882
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,400
 - That's so good.

883
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,040
 Mentioning Jack Cousteau,

884
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:30,520
 the Calypso and his efforts of ocean mapping

885
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,480
 are some of the greatest that we've ever had.

886
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,320
 On his ship.

887
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,160
 - With the Calypso, his ship.

888
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,000
 - The Calypso was the ship,

889
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,520
 it was a very famous ship.

890
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,960
 And he had three tanks

891
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,520
 that would be there to take out to sea.

892
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,040
 So you had the diesel to run the ship,

893
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,520
 you had the water to drink.

894
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,320
 What do you think his third tank was?

895
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,160
 - Probably ocean farts.

896
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,960
 - Which he's bottled with, yes.

897
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:49,800
 - Along the way?

898
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,640
 - Thank you for reminding me.

899
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,920
 We didn't pick up on my question.

900
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:55,400
 - It's just like bilge water to keep him.

901
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,320
 - Wastewater?

902
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,160
 - Yeah, wastewater.

903
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,120
 - So it did not pollute the sea?

904
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:58,960
 - No.

905
00:28:58,960 --> 00:28:59,800
 - Is it just whiskey or something?

906
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,840
 - It's wine.

907
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:04,280
 He had a giant wine tank attached to the ship

908
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,120
 in order to.

909
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,040
 - For drinking?

910
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:06,880
 - Of course for drinking.

911
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,800
 - Right, not for some kind of fuel purpose.

912
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,200
 - It's Jack Cousteau.

913
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,640
 He's gonna be, and his French buddies,

914
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,320
 drinking as they're...

915
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,160
 - Amazing.

916
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,480
 - Have you guys heard of,

917
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,440
 while we're talking about weird rock formations?

918
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,560
 Do you guys know about the Ararat Anomaly?

919
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,200
 - So Mount Ararat?

920
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,120
 - Mount Ararat, yes.

921
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,360
 - Above land?

922
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,200
 - It's above land.

923
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,680
 - Oh, is it that there are loads of fossils

924
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:32,680
 that should be ocean things on Mount Ararat?

925
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,080
 - There are those, but that's not what this is.

926
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,120
 This is if people have taken photos

927
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,520
 of the snow near the summit of Mount Ararat,

928
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:43,080
 there's something that looks very much like Noah's Ark.

929
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:43,920
 - Brilliant.

930
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,040
 - And if you see the pictures,

931
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,520
 you can kind of see where they're coming from.

932
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,720
 I mean, they're very fuzzy.

933
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,880
 But the interesting thing is,

934
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,800
 this was classified as secret for the U.S. Air Force

935
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:56,560
 from 1949 until the '90s.

936
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,880
 - Wow.

937
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,960
 - And it's in snow, it's like a snow arc.

938
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:03,040
 - It's kind of, it's basically just a jagged bit of rock.

939
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,720
 - A snow, it's an arc shaped pile of rocks.

940
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,520
 - Precisely, okay.

941
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,600
 Yeah, why do you think it was classified as secret

942
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,280
 for so long?

943
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,600
 - Because it might provoke religious conflict.

944
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,040
 - Interesting, because obviously,

945
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:16,320
 a lot of believers think that this is evidence,

946
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,120
 that the Bible is true, but no, that wasn't it.

947
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,520
 - Okay.

948
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:23,800
 - It's much more Cotidian, much more boring than that.

949
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,880
 - People might visit if they didn't want to visit.

950
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:29,280
 - Basically, it's on the border of the Soviet Union.

951
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:32,360
 And so there was lots of things happening around there

952
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,040
 between America and the Soviet Union,

953
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,240
 so they didn't want any photos coming out.

954
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,240
 But obviously the conspiracy theorists were like,

955
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,080
 oh, what are you hiding?

956
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:41,920
 What are you hiding?

957
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,320
 - Yeah, Noah's Ark.

958
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:46,760
 - Noah's in there, you're keeping him prisoner.

959
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,640
 - I've got one last thing, it's very silly,

960
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,240
 but I was looking into people

961
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,480
 and how they managed to survive the ocean

962
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,160
 once they'd been lost and people are out looking for them.

963
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:58,640
 So there was a group of people, eight men and seven women,

964
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,880
 and they were stuck out on a sort of life raft situation.

965
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,360
 No one there to save them.

966
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,040
 They have no water, how do they survive?

967
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:06,880
 And they managed 12 days.

968
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,560
 - Huge barrel of wide floats up.

969
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:11,440
 How long did they manage?

970
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,160
 - I think they were out there for 12 days.

971
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,200
 - Like drinking turtle blood, that is not okay.

972
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,320
 - So we're in that territory,

973
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,280
 they've got to find a source of food.

974
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,400
 - Drinking the little bit of liquid you get

975
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:23,200
 in a fish's eye, we've said that before.

976
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,320
 - We covered turtle blood enemas in the past.

977
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,080
 - Yeah, turtle blood enemas.

978
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,760
 - They were on a journey to Puerto Rico.

979
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:35,200
 So one of the people on the boat was Faustina Mercedes.

980
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,880
 She had back at home a one-year-old daughter,

981
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:40,440
 which meant she was still lactating.

982
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,320
 She was lactating.

983
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:46,280
 And so she offered up her breasts to everyone on the boat.

984
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,360
 And every day.

985
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,560
 - How many people were on the boat?

986
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,880
 - There were a lot, there were eight men.

987
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,720
 - It was a cruise ship.

988
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,800
 (all laughing)

989
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,880
 - 2,000 people.

990
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,720
 - Oh, Lord.

991
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,560
 - Killing up every day.

992
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,760
 (all laughing)

993
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,280
 - Eight men, seven women.

994
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:00,360
 Every day they would take a quick couple of sips,

995
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,880
 and then that was just keeping them at bay.

996
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,520
 And in order to feed herself,

997
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,760
 her sister would go on the breast

998
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,520
 and then pass the milk back to her.

999
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,560
 - Oh, clever.

1000
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,400
 - Yeah.

1001
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,240
 - Wait, does that keep her going?

1002
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:14,400
 Does that, it feels like that doesn't make any sense.

1003
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,400
 It doesn't make any sense.

1004
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,120
 I know many people have pointed this out,

1005
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:17,960
 but it's-

1006
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,160
 - We're not producing milk out of nowhere.

1007
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,440
 - But it deals with your dry mouth, you know?

1008
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,280
 - It's basically,

1009
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,720
 they're very, very slowly cannibalizing this woman.

1010
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,560
 - Yes.

1011
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,400
 - Yeah.

1012
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,240
 - Yeah.

1013
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,080
 - And our motherhood-

1014
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,920
 - She must have been quite saggy by the end,

1015
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:30,760
 was she?

1016
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,600
 - When she got back,

1017
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,840
 she said she was unable to feed her own child

1018
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,400
 because of the, it was pretty traumatic.

1019
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,240
 It was pretty weird.

1020
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,080
 - It was highly unsurprising.

1021
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:37,920
 - She said it was weird, yeah.

1022
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:38,760
 - Well.

1023
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,000
 - That's, that is weird.

1024
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:40,840
 - It is weird.

1025
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,360
 - I'm with her on that one.

1026
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,600
 - It's also, it's also the ending of,

1027
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,720
 loop it right around,

1028
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,840
 "The Grapes of Roth".

1029
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,280
 (all laughing)

1030
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,400
 - It is, "The Grapes of Roth" ends with a lady-

1031
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,240
 - Yeah, we're suckling on it.

1032
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,760
 - It ends with a young lady suckling an old man

1033
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,960
 who's starving to death.

1034
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,400
 It's the Dust Bowl America.

1035
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,240
 It's, that is the final seat.

1036
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,080
 - That's not right.

1037
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:58,920
 - That's the final seat.

1038
00:32:58,920 --> 00:32:59,880
 - That's an incredible full circle.

1039
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,200
 I am only a hundred pages into "The Grapes of Roth",

1040
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,800
 10 years ago, fine, I never got any.

1041
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,000
 (all laughing)

1042
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,580
 (upbeat music)

1043
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:13,280
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

1044
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,160
 and that is my fact.

1045
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,880
 My fact this week is that when the Forbidden City in China

1046
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:20,160
 had its first telephone installed,

1047
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:25,040
 it was first used by the emperor to make prank phone calls.

1048
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:28,560
 This was the last emperor of China known as Puyi.

1049
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,840
 And after having the phone installed,

1050
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,320
 he went through a phone book.

1051
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,160
 He found one of his favorite opera singers,

1052
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,640
 a guy called Yang Xiaolu.

1053
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,480
 And he called him up and he said,

1054
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,040
 "Is this the great operatic singer?"

1055
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:39,880
 And he said, "Yes."

1056
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,360
 And then he just giggled and hung up.

1057
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,280
 - He hadn't developed the pranks by that point.

1058
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,160
 - No, that's not Bart Simpson level.

1059
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:48,640
 - No, the second one is closer to sort of teenage pranking.

1060
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,840
 He would call up local restaurants

1061
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,920
 and he would order a bunch of food to an address

1062
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,760
 that wasn't brilliant, the Forbidden City.

1063
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,360
 - And so here's a question.

1064
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,760
 It sounds like everyone in the country

1065
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,720
 had telephones apart from him.

1066
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,560
 - Yeah, possibly.

1067
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,400
 I mean, well, they, you know,

1068
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,560
 the emperor was kind of isolated from the rest of the world.

1069
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,200
 They were sort of, no one was really allowed

1070
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,480
 into the Forbidden City who weren't part of the system.

1071
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,480
 - Okay, you should probably explain who he was then.

1072
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,680
 - Well, yes.

1073
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:15,400
 So he was the, he was no longer really the emperor

1074
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:18,080
 by the time we were talking about when he was a teenager.

1075
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,640
 So he was born in 1906.

1076
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,520
 He became the emperor in 1908.

1077
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,360
 And he was deposed in 1911

1078
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,440
 because he, you know, he did such a terrible job.

1079
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,720
 - Yeah, they screwed him up.

1080
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:29,800
 - He thrown his ties out of the pram or something.

1081
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,520
 - It was like having Boris Johnson in charge over there.

1082
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:35,520
 - Yeah, so he, but he was allowed to stay in a palace

1083
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,840
 and keep living as though he were the supreme authority,

1084
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,680
 even though he wasn't.

1085
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,000
 So it's really strange.

1086
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,160
 - Well, he's a figurehead, wasn't he?

1087
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,440
 - That is a bit like Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings,

1088
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,280
 isn't it?

1089
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,120
 - Yeah, exactly.

1090
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:46,960
 - It's exactly that.

1091
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:47,880
 - I'll let you stay.

1092
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,480
 - But when he asked for his phone in the first place,

1093
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:52,200
 he was told there is nothing in the ancestral regulations

1094
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,320
 to provide for this.

1095
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,360
 Because obviously his ancestors had been saying,

1096
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,320
 "Oh, I gotta have a phone."

1097
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,640
 - He wouldn't predict these things.

1098
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,000
 - It was a really weird, the old fashion,

1099
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,400
 and his father said it would upset imperial dignity

1100
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,280
 if outside voices could ring into the palace.

1101
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,040
 So there was controversy about it at the time.

1102
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:06,880
 - There were, absolutely.

1103
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,200
 And this was, he only really knew about the phones

1104
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,000
 because he had a British tutor,

1105
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,960
 who was a guy called Sir Reginald Fleming Johnston.

1106
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,840
 Not a sir at the time, I don't think,

1107
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:20,360
 but he became the English tutor to Puyi.

1108
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,040
 And he was the one who mentioned it.

1109
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,800
 He was, "Oh, you've got these things called phones."

1110
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,760
 And he said, "I love one."

1111
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,240
 - Johnson got pranked all the time by Puyi.

1112
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,880
 Puyi was constantly bringing up the man who'd got in the phone.

1113
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,240
 - That's a, 'cause kind of he was his only friend,

1114
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,480
 I got the impression.

1115
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,600
 So that's kind of sad.

1116
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,560
 And I'm sure Johnston pretends to be really upset

1117
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,480
 or amused every time.

1118
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,920
 - I think what we're gonna find

1119
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,040
 is that this is a pretty tragic story, isn't it?

1120
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:45,320
 This guy, very young, made an emperor,

1121
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,800
 turned out to be a utter, utter asshole,

1122
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,960
 but probably a victim of circumstance

1123
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,640
 because he was left on his own the whole time.

1124
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,840
 - That's the thing, the whole thing feeds on itself.

1125
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,840
 It's like no one comes out good in this story.

1126
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,480
 I just want to stick up for Puyi.

1127
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,320
 - Oh yeah.

1128
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,800
 - Because I've got this book out of the library.

1129
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,640
 - Yep.

1130
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,920
 - It's from Emperor to Citizen.

1131
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:03,760
 - Oh yes.

1132
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,600
 - And it's his memoir.

1133
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,440
 - Oh yeah.

1134
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,560
 - And I've been reading it.

1135
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,680
 And he, you know, it's actually a lot funnier

1136
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,080
 than we're all giving it credit for.

1137
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,040
 - Does he mention all the stuff

1138
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,680
 about constantly whipping eunuchs

1139
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,760
 just for the sake of having fun of watching that?

1140
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,600
 - He does.

1141
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,440
 - He beats them to death.

1142
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,280
 Did he do that?

1143
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,440
 - Does he mention it when his wife

1144
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,840
 had a child with another man

1145
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,720
 and then he had that baby stolen and killed?

1146
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,560
 Is that in there?

1147
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,400
 Is that part of the funny stuff?

1148
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,240
 - Okay, I haven't read the whole thing.

1149
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,080
 - Yeah.

1150
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:26,920
 He's a bad dude.

1151
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,480
 - No, he does mention the eunuch stuff though

1152
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,480
 because that was his whole big repentance thing.

1153
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,400
 His memoirs at the end of his life

1154
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,280
 was when he said, "I'm sorry for all this."

1155
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:37,920
 - There's an entire chapter called the eunuchs

1156
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,520
 because he lived surrounded by eunuchs.

1157
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,360
 - Yeah.

1158
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,200
 - There were a few hundred

1159
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,040
 and even that was a substantial cut down

1160
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,160
 from the glory days when there were--

1161
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,520
 - Substantial cut down to make those eunuchs.

1162
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,480
 - In the good old days,

1163
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,960
 there were thousands and thousands of you.

1164
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,120
 Look, just look, eunuchs, page 61,

1165
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,440
 just a great section on, you know,

1166
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,480
 the eunuchy life he lived.

1167
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,320
 - That's pretty funny.

1168
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,160
 - Until he was 10 years old,

1169
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,520
 he only played hide and seek with his own eunuchs.

1170
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,960
 He was very isolated growing up.

1171
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:01,880
 I mean, he had siblings,

1172
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:04,120
 but he didn't see his own mother for years and years and years

1173
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,680
 'cause he was taken away to live in the--

1174
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,080
 - He wasn't the child of the previous emperor.

1175
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,280
 The previous emperor was his uncle.

1176
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,120
 - That's right.

1177
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:10,960
 So there was the emperor Stowager,

1178
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,720
 who's a very famous character in ancient Chinese--

1179
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,960
 - Yeah, Sushi, who's this amazing person.

1180
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,720
 - And she, when the emperor had passed away,

1181
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,920
 there was no child in order to take over.

1182
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,400
 So this was the nephew.

1183
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,800
 - But there were moments of levity in his childhood.

1184
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,560
 I just think there were a few.

1185
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,800
 So just get this, if you ever went to the park,

1186
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,680
 this is the process of how it would happen.

1187
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,480
 He would have a eunuch walking ahead of him,

1188
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,960
 basically honking with his mouth to say,

1189
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,200
 "Everyone keep away."

1190
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,440
 He was like a sort of one-man beep, beep, beep system.

1191
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:41,200
 - Well, they hadn't invented the klaxon horn,

1192
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,360
 had they ever done yet? - No, yeah, no.

1193
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,520
 - So you needed the eunuch.

1194
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,960
 - A rare example of China not inventing something first,

1195
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,400
 just 'cause the eunuch system works so well.

1196
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,720
 Then there would be two chief eunuchs

1197
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,640
 going kind of crab-wise sideways,

1198
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,920
 just keeping an eye on everything.

1199
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,080
 Then there would be junior eunuchs with him.

1200
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,480
 There would be a eunuch with a canopy,

1201
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,000
 then more eunuchs holding a chair, a change of clothes,

1202
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,520
 some umbrellas, some cakes,

1203
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,920
 some hot water.

1204
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,480
 Then there were the medical eunuchs who came behind them.

1205
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,680
 - We've all been to the beach with our kids.

1206
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,480
 We know how much you have to take,

1207
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,800
 how many eunuchs you need.

1208
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:13,280
 - And then at the end is the eunuch with the Lou,

1209
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,280
 or the eunuchs, several eunuchs

1210
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,040
 with commodes and chamber pots and things.

1211
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,800
 And when he was a kid, he would just run around.

1212
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,120
 And it's called absolute mayhem

1213
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,640
 because the whole procession was trying to keep up

1214
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,160
 with a five-year-old boy

1215
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,800
 who was just running around in a park.

1216
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,760
 - Can I do it an incredibly quick?

1217
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,600
 This is his life.

1218
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,640
 So on the throne at two, kicked off the throne at six,

1219
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:35,240
 but got to be pretend emperor until like early mid 1920s,

1220
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,720
 at which point he was booted out by a warlord,

1221
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,840
 hung up being a playboy who used to be the emperor,

1222
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,120
 shagging around a bit.

1223
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:44,360
 Until 1931, Japan invaded Manchuria,

1224
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,680
 thought we'll pluck this former emperor,

1225
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:49,600
 put him in charge apparently, but he's our puppet.

1226
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,680
 He had no power,

1227
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:53,680
 but he got to keep living this weird fake royal life.

1228
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:56,040
 So continued being pampered and petted,

1229
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,400
 having people wait on him.

1230
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,440
 No power.

1231
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:02,600
 Then Japanese surrender 1945, he's fucked

1232
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,840
 because the Soviets come,

1233
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,360
 they put him in prison for five years.

1234
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,760
 Then they hand him over to the Chinese who reeducate him.

1235
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,120
 - The communists at this point.

1236
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,960
 - Who are communists, reeducate him.

1237
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,680
 He comes out, bona fide communists

1238
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:13,960
 and ends his life for Gardner.

1239
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,000
 Mad life.

1240
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:15,840
 - It is a mad life.

1241
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:19,080
 And reeducation is like being in a jail cell, right?

1242
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:19,920
 Like it's your-

1243
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:20,760
 - It's like going out to school, Dan.

1244
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,600
 - You're being conditioned.

1245
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,600
 Yeah, it's like a British boarding school.

1246
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,320
 Maybe that's why I think all this sounds absolutely

1247
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,320
 part of the course.

1248
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,360
 (all laughing)

1249
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,120
 We were constantly firing air guns at the Unix

1250
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:30,960
 at my school.

1251
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,400
 (all laughing)

1252
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,080
 - And the final bit of life where he became a Gardner,

1253
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:39,560
 he's fascinating just reading how useless he was

1254
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,080
 in day-to-day activities,

1255
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,440
 where he would sort of forget to flush a toilet

1256
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:47,000
 or know any directions or all these basic things

1257
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:47,840
 that you would-

1258
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:48,680
 - Shoelaces.

1259
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,520
 - Yeah, shoelaces.

1260
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,520
 - Just done his shoes for his whole life.

1261
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,760
 - I found it, I really question this,

1262
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,360
 but I mean, all the historians say it,

1263
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,440
 that when he was being reeducated by China,

1264
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,320
 it was partly to say be a communist

1265
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,080
 and apologize for uniting with the Japanese.

1266
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,120
 And it was partly to say,

1267
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,920
 "Here's how to look after yourself."

1268
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,440
 And they taught him to tie his shoelaces

1269
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,600
 and brush his teeth.

1270
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:08,000
 - He was breastfed until the age of eight.

1271
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:08,840
 - Yep.

1272
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,960
 - And at that point, the Dowager,

1273
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,000
 the powerful Dowager said,

1274
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,640
 "I think it's probably time we've removed your wet nurse

1275
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,480
 from you."

1276
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,320
 Which made him very sad,

1277
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,280
 'cause he would just believe we're still enjoying it.

1278
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,000
 - But he was stranded out in the Pacific at the time,

1279
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:20,840
 wasn't he?

1280
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:21,680
 (all laughing)

1281
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,880
 He had no other sustenance.

1282
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,920
 - If you were the Empress Dowager

1283
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,880
 in this weird fake palace situation,

1284
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:29,880
 was it real palace?

1285
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,800
 - First of all, what is an Empress Dowager?

1286
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,640
 - So she's the widow of the emperor,

1287
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,760
 who is now in a senior position,

1288
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,080
 kind of like a regent.

1289
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,040
 She's got a lot of authority,

1290
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,440
 but she's not technically--

1291
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,360
 - So she basically runs everything.

1292
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,200
 - Exactly.

1293
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,440
 - But she's putting in little puppets to do her work for her.

1294
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,200
 'Cause arguably this guy,

1295
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,800
 even though he was emperor three times,

1296
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,600
 he was never really in charge at any stage.

1297
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,680
 - Absolutely, absolutely.

1298
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:53,720
 He just wasn't in charge.

1299
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,000
 So yeah, the Dowager would have been the one

1300
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,080
 really controlling things,

1301
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,480
 saying, "I think maybe we should stop breastfeeding you now,"

1302
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,840
 that kind of thing.

1303
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:02,360
 - Or more like, "I think maybe we should invade Mongolia now."

1304
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,400
 - Yeah, exactly.

1305
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:06,440
 (all laughing)

1306
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,440
 They had this thing in the palace,

1307
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,160
 and again, this is after the First Revolution.

1308
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,360
 So they're not really in charge anymore,

1309
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,480
 but they're still treated with a lot of respect.

1310
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,400
 There was an as you wish lodge,

1311
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,080
 which was one of the 48 offices

1312
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,480
 that the staff were working in.

1313
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:21,680
 And if the Empress Dowager decided to do some painting,

1314
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:26,080
 the staff at the lodge would make her the painting already.

1315
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:28,000
 They basically made her a paint by numbers,

1316
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,520
 and she just had to fill in the colors

1317
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,360
 and put the title on it.

1318
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,200
 - That's great.

1319
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,040
 - What a great service.

1320
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:32,880
 - How cool is that?

1321
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,600
 - Wow, I want that.

1322
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,200
 He married five times,

1323
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,320
 which was easier to fit in

1324
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,320
 when you're allowed multiple marriages at once,

1325
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,720
 as you were.

1326
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,240
 But again, this seemed like an unfair trick.

1327
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:44,920
 This is in 1921.

1328
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:48,080
 So when he was being like pretend emperor with no power,

1329
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:51,320
 he was shown five photos of women.

1330
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,920
 It used to be that the emperor had women paraded

1331
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,200
 in front of him and got to choose,

1332
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:58,160
 but because he's been downgraded, he just got photos.

1333
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,600
 And he was asked, "Choose who you like best."

1334
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:01,960
 He picked one.

1335
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,520
 And then they chatted amongst themselves.

1336
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,360
 The other people at court went,

1337
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,920
 "No, she's not fit enough."

1338
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:06,760
 - No.

1339
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,240
 - And they made him marry the other one.

1340
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,560
 - So he did get a second wife from a different photo,

1341
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,560
 but on the day of marriage,

1342
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:14,000
 he then also married this first choice.

1343
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:14,840
 - Yes.

1344
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:15,680
 - He had two marriages on the same day.

1345
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:16,520
 - On the same day.

1346
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:18,760
 - That's a sitcom, ready to be written, isn't it?

1347
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:19,600
 (laughing)

1348
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:22,560
 - You know what, it sounds so unfunny their lives.

1349
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,440
 I want you to inject some gags in there, please.

1350
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,760
 - If anyone has any objection

1351
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,680
 and you're hoping the concubine hasn't turned up

1352
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,360
 to your wedding, or your wife hasn't turned up

1353
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,600
 for the concubine marriage, I think this is good.

1354
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:32,760
 - They were really young weren't they?

1355
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,960
 These young women who were brought in.

1356
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,400
 The last one who was called Li Yuqin.

1357
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:40,480
 She was, I think she was 14 or something

1358
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:43,400
 when she became the last imperial consort

1359
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:48,120
 and the emperor was comparatively old at this stage.

1360
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:50,000
 But she said, and in his view she said

1361
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,920
 she didn't even know how children were made at that stage.

1362
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,080
 She believed what she was told by her mother

1363
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:59,120
 that we were picked up from the rubbish bins.

1364
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,800
 I just think that's an unusual way of telling kids

1365
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,240
 that that's where babies come from.

1366
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:06,040
 - It's good parenting, and it's a story I've maintained.

1367
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:08,040
 - Well, I just think, 'cause we have like the stock

1368
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,680
 comes and drops the baby at the front door.

1369
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:10,520
 - That's very nice.

1370
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:12,600
 Cabbage patch is nice, fertility and growth.

1371
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:13,600
 - But rubbish bins?

1372
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:14,720
 - Yeah, to be fair,

1373
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,560
 this is an almost entirely unique based society.

1374
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,800
 It's very hard to actually get a handle

1375
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:21,040
 on where children come from in this world.

1376
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,040
 But he doesn't seem to have been

1377
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:24,280
 especially actually interested in women now.

1378
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:26,960
 - Well, he used to have blazing rounds with his wife,

1379
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,960
 both wives and all five wives about,

1380
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,960
 they would sometimes refer to him as a eunuch

1381
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,800
 because of his lack of prowess.

1382
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,040
 In the bedroom on the honeymoon night,

1383
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,520
 he had both of his first wives,

1384
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:38,920
 so the wife and the consort in the same bed,

1385
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:39,760
 waiting for him.

1386
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,440
 And when he went in, the story goes,

1387
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,480
 he ran out of the room and they don't know

1388
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:45,960
 if there was much, with any consummation happening.

1389
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:48,600
 - I'm hearing sitcom, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1390
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,800
 - They're running in and running out,

1391
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,440
 certainly out of the element of farce.

1392
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,720
 His last wife seemed like quite a sweet story.

1393
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:59,000
 So this was in the 1960s.

1394
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,960
 He started off working as a street sweeper.

1395
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,880
 So the Chinese reeducated him, then pardoned him.

1396
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:06,440
 He became a street sweeper and there's a very sad story

1397
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:09,560
 of him getting lost and he has to approach his former subjects

1398
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:11,600
 and say, "Hello, I used to be the emperor.

1399
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:12,760
 I don't know how to get home.

1400
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:13,600
 I'm staying with family."

1401
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,840
 - He should just follow the clean streets.

1402
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,200
 If he goes back in the direction

1403
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,280
 that all the clean streets are,

1404
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,600
 he knows that's where he came from.

1405
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,440
 - The thing is James, he was so bad at all these tasks.

1406
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,600
 He hadn't actually effectively cleaned the streets.

1407
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:26,800
 - I think it's like the reverse of following the breadcrumbs.

1408
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,480
 - Yeah. - That's beautiful.

1409
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,800
 - Follow the lack of breadcrumbs.

1410
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,880
 But then he married this woman who was a nurse

1411
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:35,520
 and they stayed together forever.

1412
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,440
 And I think she didn't die until 1997.

1413
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,160
 And she said he was just desperate for someone to love him.

1414
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,520
 Which after that life?

1415
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:42,600
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

1416
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:43,960
 - Yeah, it's wild.

1417
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:45,720
 - So you find the story very depressing Dan,

1418
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:46,760
 which is fair. - Yeah.

1419
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:49,840
 - But actually, when he did write his memoirs at the end,

1420
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:51,080
 which were heavily influenced

1421
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:53,120
 by the Chinese Communist Party and its free education,

1422
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:54,600
 he did say he was-

1423
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:55,680
 - They come in for some very good press

1424
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,000
 at the end of this one, I've gotta say.

1425
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:57,840
 - Exactly.

1426
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:01,120
 He was at least contented with his current status

1427
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:05,680
 as a repentant and devoted communist who loved the party.

1428
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:08,160
 - I didn't notice, Addy, that it is a little red book.

1429
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:09,160
 (all laughing)

1430
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:10,480
 - Yes it is.

1431
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:13,060
 (upbeat music)

1432
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:16,100
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show

1433
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:17,820
 and that is Andy.

1434
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:19,660
 - My fact is that the film "Spider-Man"

1435
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:22,460
 once cast two crowds of identical twin extras,

1436
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:24,740
 so they could film the same scene at the same time

1437
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:26,100
 in different places.

1438
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:27,140
 - Amazing. - That's amazing.

1439
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:27,980
 - Why?

1440
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:29,540
 You know, the first thing that comes into my head

1441
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:32,380
 is that meme of all the Spider-Man points at each other.

1442
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:33,220
 - Yeah.

1443
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:34,060
 (all laughing)

1444
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:37,380
 - This is a really weird thing that just happened to happen

1445
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:39,260
 once in the annals of filming history.

1446
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:41,220
 And I got this because I was looking in the mirror

1447
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:42,980
 in history and I got this because I was looking

1448
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:45,620
 into casting and how people are cast

1449
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:47,420
 and how extras get cast in films.

1450
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:49,620
 And there was a woman called Jennifer Bender

1451
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:52,980
 who was the vice president of an extras film

1452
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:54,540
 about 10 years ago and she was being in due

1453
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:55,820
 to develop a business.

1454
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:59,100
 And she said that this film, they had two units shooting.

1455
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:00,700
 You know, you have-- - Sorry, two eunuchs.

1456
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:03,940
 (all laughing)

1457
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:05,420
 - There's a main unit and a second unit.

1458
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:09,020
 And they needed, yeah, due to just the nature of film.

1459
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:10,820
 It's so weird when you ask anyone about the world of film,

1460
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:13,260
 why their stuff is so weird.

1461
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:14,700
 They just say, "Well, that's just filming, isn't it?"

1462
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:17,940
 And it's basically, they had to shoot this scene

1463
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:19,660
 in two places at the same time

1464
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:21,700
 because of the schedule they were on to get this filmed.

1465
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:23,500
 So they said, "Well, let's just cast twins."

1466
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:26,140
 So they got 25 sets of twins, so one lot to one set,

1467
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:28,060
 so one lot to the other set, dressed them the same.

1468
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:28,900
 - That's really good.

1469
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:29,740
 - That's really cool.

1470
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:31,820
 - And one of the thing is that the twins,

1471
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:34,620
 they can telepathically communicate to each other, right?

1472
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:37,460
 So they can tell them what's happening in the other place.

1473
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:39,140
 - So when he said this fact, so we were like,

1474
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:42,140
 "Wow, why?" and you said, "You'll have to wait and see."

1475
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:43,860
 But what the answer is just,

1476
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:45,940
 'cause they're really shit at making film schedules.

1477
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:47,260
 - Schedules, it's just, you know.

1478
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:49,660
 - I'm sure it's easier to repack the schedule.

1479
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:53,380
 - I've got to say, Andy's sort of amazing mystery

1480
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:56,340
 is always going to end up, it was a matter of scheduling.

1481
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:58,220
 (laughing)

1482
00:46:58,220 --> 00:47:00,020
 - Anna, you don't understand the nature of film.

1483
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:02,860
 Like, there are producers on your ass all the time saying,

1484
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:03,700
 "We've got to get this ready

1485
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:06,220
 "for the Hong Kong market in two weeks," you know?

1486
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:07,980
 - Can't have that many identical twins in the world.

1487
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:08,940
 - We've got to do the re-shoots.

1488
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:10,540
 Get Chalamet now.

1489
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:13,820
 I want five Chalamets on my desk tomorrow morning.

1490
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:16,340
 You know, it's hard, that's film.

1491
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:17,980
 - Incredible, so good.

1492
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:18,820
 - That's really cool.

1493
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:20,340
 - It's hard to be an extra.

1494
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:21,700
 - Oh, it sounds it.

1495
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:23,020
 I've done extra work a couple of times.

1496
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:23,860
 - Have you?

1497
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:24,700
 - Yeah.

1498
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:25,540
 - Well, in this podcast.

1499
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:26,380
 - Wow.

1500
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:27,340
 (laughing)

1501
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:28,460
 - What did you do?

1502
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:29,300
 - I can't remember.

1503
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:31,260
 It was a film with James McAvoy, which was quite exciting.

1504
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:33,220
 'Cause you often don't know before you turn up

1505
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:34,140
 what it's going to be.

1506
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:34,980
 - Yeah, right.

1507
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:36,860
 - Are they looking specifically for people

1508
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:40,100
 with quite normal-looking faces?

1509
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:42,500
 - Planned, ideally, they want balloons on sticks.

1510
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:43,820
 - Well, that is a thing, isn't it?

1511
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:44,660
 - Yeah.

1512
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:45,500
 - Like, you can buy it.

1513
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:46,860
 - Is it like inflatable crowds for movies?

1514
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:47,700
 - No.

1515
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:48,540
 - Yeah.

1516
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:50,460
 - I think Seabiscuit famously, like, that's where it started.

1517
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:51,420
 - I think that was the first one.

1518
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:52,980
 Yeah, this guy called Joe Biggins,

1519
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:54,900
 who suddenly realized rather than organize loads

1520
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:56,580
 of extras and have to pay them,

1521
00:47:56,580 --> 00:47:58,580
 you can just make inflatable people.

1522
00:47:58,580 --> 00:47:59,420
 - Really?

1523
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:00,260
 - And you can do,

1524
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:02,180
 I think he got 10,000 in the back of a lorry,

1525
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:03,540
 which you can't do with extras.

1526
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:05,860
 (laughing)

1527
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:08,140
 - That's against union rules, yeah, yeah.

1528
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:09,940
 - Oh, they're very annoying about that.

1529
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:12,060
 - I really hope, like, in the background of, like,

1530
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:14,140
 a movie, like, Gladiator, if you look carefully,

1531
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:17,180
 there's just a slowly floppy, deflating.

1532
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:18,340
 - They're floating away, unfortunately.

1533
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:19,180
 - He is helium.

1534
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:21,020
 (laughing)

1535
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:23,300
 - Weirdly, appendages cost extra,

1536
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:26,260
 so he charges $50 for the Bod the torso.

1537
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:28,340
 - So is this from a big distance that you're shooting?

1538
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:29,940
 Of course, 'cause it couldn't be--

1539
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:30,780
 - Yeah, it is.

1540
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:32,540
 It's like crowd scenes, really.

1541
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:35,220
 So Seabiscuit, they're running around a horse track,

1542
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:36,940
 and they-- - So that's kind of perfect.

1543
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:38,340
 - And what you do is you get loads of them,

1544
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:40,660
 and then you get some humans in between them,

1545
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:43,500
 and your eyes are naturally drawn to the humans,

1546
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:45,060
 so the rest of it is just background.

1547
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:45,900
 - That's brilliant.

1548
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:47,140
 - It's amazing what we don't notice.

1549
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:48,980
 - I read about a movie that was made

1550
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:51,460
 by actually an old buddy of mine called Anthony Ng,

1551
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:54,580
 where he tracked down the lady who has the Guinness World

1552
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:58,380
 record for the most extras appearances in movies.

1553
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:02,140
 So her record was 1,951.

1554
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:02,980
 And they're everything from,

1555
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:06,300
 she said she was on 80% of the carry-on films.

1556
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:09,580
 She was in the very first episode of EastEnders.

1557
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:12,100
 She remembers being on a set one day with a guy,

1558
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:14,180
 having a great chat at the lunch hall,

1559
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:16,420
 and then he's the lead in a movie years later.

1560
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:17,980
 It's David Bowie, who says,

1561
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:19,460
 "Hey, we had a great chat,"

1562
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:20,980
 and they reconnected through that.

1563
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:22,620
 So she sees people go up.

1564
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:24,100
 So her name's Jill Goldston,

1565
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:29,060
 and we know that she has appeared in the 1,951 movies.

1566
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:31,160
 Certainly, she had at that point for the record,

1567
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:33,660
 because her husband is an accountant,

1568
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:35,020
 and he marked down every time.

1569
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:36,300
 He just got obsessed with making sure

1570
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:37,980
 that he had lists of what was going on.

1571
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:39,980
 Yeah, so there's a whole documentary about her,

1572
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:42,220
 and all her little things that she learned along the way.

1573
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:44,220
 Don't look at Tom Cruise when he's on set, you know?

1574
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:45,900
 - Are we saying because her husband's an accountant,

1575
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:47,380
 therefore sort of a really boring guy

1576
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:49,180
 who loves tallying up on hate information?

1577
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:50,020
 - He just happened to do it.

1578
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:52,340
 Yeah, he liked making Excel spreadsheets.

1579
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:53,540
 - Fair. - For respect.

1580
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:54,380
 - Yeah.

1581
00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:56,700
 - Don't point at me when he's talking about a boring guy.

1582
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:57,620
 It's offensive.

1583
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:01,260
 - When we say someone comes from central casting.

1584
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:02,100
 - Oh, yeah.

1585
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:03,040
 - That's a phrase, right?

1586
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:05,540
 It's a sort of, oh, he's straight out of central casting.

1587
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:06,980
 I mean, someone's a bit of like a stock carrier,

1588
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:08,740
 or like if someone turns up and they're an accountant

1589
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:09,740
 and they're wearing a gray suit

1590
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:11,100
 and they're carrying a gray briefcase

1591
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:13,300
 and they've got to roll up a breller.

1592
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:14,980
 Central casting is an actual company,

1593
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:17,380
 which I didn't know until I was researching this,

1594
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:19,860
 and it's 100 years old this year,

1595
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:24,780
 'cause it started in 100 years ago, 1925.

1596
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:26,620
 - You could do the math as well.

1597
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:29,600
 - Wow, are you an accountant?

1598
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:32,160
 - Yeah, and just, that was the firm that Jennifer Bender

1599
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:33,480
 was the vice president of.

1600
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:35,880
 They place hundreds of, even now, these days,

1601
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:37,480
 they place hundreds of thousands of people a year.

1602
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:39,320
 - American based or here?

1603
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:41,280
 - Certainly in America, and I think all over,

1604
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:42,560
 and lots of people started out there.

1605
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:45,560
 David Niven started out there, he's a famous actor.

1606
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:48,760
 He was registered as Anglo-Saxon type number 2008,

1607
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:51,640
 and in the 1920s, extras were categorized into groups

1608
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:53,920
 because you just needed like a job lot of people

1609
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:55,240
 who looked a particular way,

1610
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:57,220
 and the groups included blonde, beautiful,

1611
00:50:57,220 --> 00:51:00,600
 Latin, nurses, swimmers, and toothless.

1612
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:03,180
 (all laughing)

1613
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:06,220
 - Sometimes you could take a few boxes,

1614
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:07,060
 didn't you?

1615
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:07,900
 - Yeah, yeah.

1616
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:10,740
 - Beautiful, but toothless, you know, I'm not too gigs.

1617
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:13,020
 - The Log of the Rings films have got a lot of extras in,

1618
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:14,140
 haven't they, famously?

1619
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:17,020
 In fact, they pretty much cast everyone in New Zealand,

1620
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:18,580
 in those movies, I think.

1621
00:51:18,580 --> 00:51:19,820
 In Return of the King,

1622
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:23,060
 they brought in some members of the New Zealand army,

1623
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:25,500
 and apparently they were way too enthusiastic

1624
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:27,500
 and kept breaking all the wooden swords and stuff.

1625
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:28,780
 (all laughing)

1626
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:31,660
 But in the two towers, they had a group of,

1627
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:33,620
 apologies to people who like Log of the Rings,

1628
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:34,820
 'cause I've never read any of them,

1629
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:37,100
 but there's a group called the Uruk High,

1630
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:38,520
 which is the orcs.

1631
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:39,360
 - Floorless.

1632
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:42,060
 - And they needed to get people to play them,

1633
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:44,320
 so they put a casting call out for everyone

1634
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:47,180
 over six foot tall in New Zealand

1635
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:49,100
 to come and play the Uruk High,

1636
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:50,680
 and they couldn't find enough people,

1637
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:53,460
 so they said, okay, everyone who's over five foot

1638
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:55,420
 can come in, and they brought in all these

1639
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:56,780
 like slightly shorter men,

1640
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:59,680
 and they were no one on set as the Uruk Low.

1641
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:00,520
 - Brilliant.

1642
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:03,740
 (all laughing)

1643
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:05,700
 - Having a fun day out as an extra on a movie.

1644
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:06,780
 (all laughing)

1645
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:08,740
 Can we get the Uruk Low in?

1646
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:09,580
 - We would.

1647
00:52:09,580 --> 00:52:12,820
 - Do you know how many extras were used on those movies?

1648
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:14,180
 It'd be in like the tens of thousands, right?

1649
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:15,380
 - Tens of thousands for sure.

1650
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:19,020
 - Yeah, so the one that gets cited as the movie

1651
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:21,760
 that possibly will never get broken for most extras

1652
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:26,300
 is Gandhi, which had 300,000 extras,

1653
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:27,480
 which is pretty extraordinary,

1654
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:30,320
 and that was for Gandhi's funeral scene.

1655
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:32,000
 - They weren't all paid, though.

1656
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:32,840
 - No.

1657
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:34,440
 - Most extras, like 200,000 of them

1658
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:36,300
 were just people who were milling around.

1659
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:37,440
 (all laughing)

1660
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:38,800
 - Yeah, that's true.

1661
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,240
 And that's often sometimes the case,

1662
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,320
 it's just actual people in the background.

1663
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:45,080
 There is a big list of movies of the most extras ever used,

1664
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:46,480
 Lord of the Rings is in there as well,

1665
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:49,660
 and another one is The Last Emperor movie,

1666
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:50,500
 which was filmed--

1667
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:51,660
 - Oh, about Puyi.

1668
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:54,020
 - Based on Puyi, it was filmed in the Forbidden City.

1669
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:57,540
 It was an extraordinary achievement of British filmmaking

1670
00:52:57,540 --> 00:52:58,780
 because they managed to get access

1671
00:52:58,780 --> 00:53:01,060
 to the Forbidden City itself to film inside.

1672
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:02,980
 So even when the queen was over there,

1673
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:05,860
 she couldn't visit it because they had priority access

1674
00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:07,380
 over filming in there.

1675
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:09,140
 It was a big deal, it was a big collaboration.

1676
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:10,540
 - Well, she could have, if she applied to be an extra.

1677
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:11,380
 - Yeah.

1678
00:53:11,380 --> 00:53:12,860
 (all laughing)

1679
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:14,700
 - Is it a comedy?

1680
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:16,020
 - Yes, it's hilarious.

1681
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:17,800
 - It's a raucous unit-based comedy.

1682
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:20,680
 Have you guys heard of Waller groups?

1683
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:21,520
 - Waller.

1684
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:23,600
 - Waller, W-A-W-L-L-A.

1685
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:24,440
 - Waller.

1686
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:25,280
 - Yeah.

1687
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:26,120
 - No.

1688
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:29,440
 - Rick Waller was a singer from the early days of pop idol.

1689
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:32,080
 - Fats Waller was a blues, blues, you know?

1690
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:34,320
 I mean, we're talking extras in movies here.

1691
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:37,120
 Phoebe Waller Bridge, there's a bit of lots of movies.

1692
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:39,240
 - Oh, the prequel to Wall-E.

1693
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:40,080
 - Wall-A.

1694
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:40,920
 - Wall-A.

1695
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:41,760
 - Yeah, yes.

1696
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,480
 - I'm in the film area at least.

1697
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:44,960
 - You are, that's very good.

1698
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:47,060
 - No, this is to do with the fact that

1699
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:49,300
 if you were filming extras in the background,

1700
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:52,700
 you're miking up your main characters who you're recording.

1701
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:54,420
 You haven't necessarily miked up the extras,

1702
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:56,340
 but you need that background noise.

1703
00:53:56,340 --> 00:53:58,280
 So they often hire people to come in

1704
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:00,340
 and make the sounds of the extras.

1705
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:04,260
 So they're sort of actors who are acting as the extras.

1706
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:05,100
 - Oh my God.

1707
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:06,500
 - And so they stand in and there'll be a group of them

1708
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:07,980
 who will stand in a studio

1709
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:10,260
 and they just have to make murmur sounds.

1710
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:12,460
 They're called Wallers because Wall-A, Wall-A, Wall-A, Wall-A.

1711
00:54:12,460 --> 00:54:13,580
 - Like group-up, group-up, group-up.

1712
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:14,620
 - Exactly, yeah.

1713
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:17,140
 And so they're called Waller, but it's obviously changed.

1714
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:19,400
 But so that often happens where you just have a group of people

1715
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:21,800
 having to make the sounds of the people in the background.

1716
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,280
 - Who mentioned short extras?

1717
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,800
 Oh, the Uruk Hai, being the Merrick Lowe.

1718
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:28,280
 So there's another film which had short extras

1719
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:29,760
 for a very specific reason.

1720
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:30,840
 So can you guess?

1721
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:32,120
 It's one of the most famous films of all time.

1722
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:32,960
 - Chocolate Factory.

1723
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:34,360
 - Yeah, that was my first thought.

1724
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:35,760
 - Not Chocolate Factory, not Wizard of Oz.

1725
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:37,440
 Those probably both did do exactly that,

1726
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,440
 but please let's just move on.

1727
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:39,280
 - Yep.

1728
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:42,600
 - Okay, it's something with lots of children in it.

1729
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:43,440
 - It's not.

1730
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:45,160
 It's something where you need to make something else

1731
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:46,900
 look a different size.

1732
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:48,300
 - Oh, okay, a film about a giant.

1733
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:49,660
 - Dullover's Travels.

1734
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:50,500
 - Very good.

1735
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:51,600
 - Very nice.

1736
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:53,520
 - No one's so short they can be a little appugian.

1737
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:55,400
 (all laughing)

1738
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:58,200
 - We've been in a bunch of three entire people.

1739
00:54:58,200 --> 00:54:59,380
 - Honey, I shrunk the kids.

1740
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:02,980
 - I think we've still got the same problem here.

1741
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:07,100
 - You've built a prop, but you need the prop to,

1742
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:08,820
 but the prop is only like three quarters

1743
00:55:08,820 --> 00:55:10,620
 of the actual size of the actual thing it's representing.

1744
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:12,240
 So you need to make it look bigger.

1745
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,640
 - That, what's the one where the monkey's coming?

1746
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:17,440
 It's Earth all along and they planted the apes.

1747
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:19,980
 So there's the Statue of Liberty,

1748
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:21,360
 but they couldn't get a full size one.

1749
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:22,620
 So they had to get small apes.

1750
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:23,460
 - That's right.

1751
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:25,440
 This is not, I mean, it's not right, but it's brilliant.

1752
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:26,760
 - Oh, damn it.

1753
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:28,260
 - But it's right in that it's good.

1754
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:29,960
 Yeah, it's exactly that kind of thing.

1755
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:32,480
 - But it's something else like Stonehenge or the Eiffel.

1756
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:33,320
 - Titanic.

1757
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:34,840
 Leonardo DiCaprio is actually four foot two.

1758
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:35,680
 - Titanic.

1759
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:36,520
 - Titanic.

1760
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:37,360
 - That was a Titanic.

1761
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:39,800
 - James Cameron only used people under five foot eight

1762
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:41,560
 on the actual ship.

1763
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:42,400
 - Okay.

1764
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:44,000
 - To make it look, to make the ship look bigger.

1765
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:44,840
 - Wow.

1766
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:45,840
 - 'Cause it's a pretty big ship already.

1767
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:48,600
 - It is pretty big, but the ship was a bit smaller

1768
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:49,600
 than the real life Titanic.

1769
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:50,720
 It was 15% smaller.

1770
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:53,240
 So if you cast a load of like six foot nine people,

1771
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:54,880
 it was like a bit. - It's gonna look tiny.

1772
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:55,720
 You're right.

1773
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:58,000
 (all laughing)

1774
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,920
 - Why have they started the movie in the lifeboat?

1775
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:00,760
 What's going on?

1776
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:03,020
 (all laughing)

1777
00:56:03,020 --> 00:56:05,600
 (upbeat music)

1778
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:09,000
 - Okay, that's it.

1779
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:09,960
 That is all of our facts.

1780
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:11,460

1806
00:56:56,300 --> 00:56:57,140
