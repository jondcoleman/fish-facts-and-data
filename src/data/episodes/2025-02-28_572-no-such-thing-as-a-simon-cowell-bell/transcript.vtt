00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 (upbeat music)

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.320
 - Hey everyone, welcome to this week's episode of Fish.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.320
 Before we get going, we've got a quick, exciting announcement

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.520
 which is that two of our colleagues, Jack and Manu,

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.420
 along with their chef friend, Rosie McKean,

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.440
 have just launched a brand new podcast

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.120
 called Lunchbox Envy.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.560
 - Yes, it's all the most interesting, weird,

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.240
 incredible facts about specific foods.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.800
 Every episode is based around a food stuff,

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.120
 so bananas or garlic or sausages.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.080
 There are a couple of episodes already out now.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.880
 More will be released very soon.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.040
 They really are fantastic.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.480
 You might have heard Jack and Manu,

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.080
 the elves on our spin-off show, Meet the Elves.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.280
 They obviously have the bona fide research credentials

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.600
 of QILs, and then Rosie really knows

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.040
 what she's talking about in the kitchen.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.640
 - I've learned so many amazing things

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.440
 off the back of listening to these episodes.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.480
 All the things that they pull out of their Lunchboxes

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.200
 make you just go, what the hell is that?

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.640
 Jack, for example, pulls out a chocolate garlic bar

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.080
 which was used by the British Secret Services in the war.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.400
 I'd never heard of it before.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.440
 You get these amazing, untold histories,

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.120
 but also good advice on food.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.440
 - Yes, in fact, as a result,

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.360
 I have started slow cooking sausages.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.440
 Find out why.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.680
 The good thing about the good advice is

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:12.920
 they don't just tell you what to do.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.960
 They tell you why certain things work.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.840
 It is jam-packed.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.680
 Jam-packed, yeah, very good.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.760
 Jam-packed with interesting facts

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.720
 from why food tastes better if you eat it with your hands.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.560
 There you go, toddlers, you've got it right.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.960
 As to how you can turn peanut butter into diamonds

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.800
 and make your fortune, go and listen to it right now.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.440
 Go to qi.com/lunchbox

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.720
 or wherever podcasts are available.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.040
 - That's right, so do check it out.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.160
 Lunchbox envy, out now.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.920
 Okay, on with the show.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.680
 (dramatic music)

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.520
 (upbeat music)

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.440
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:01:53.440 --> 00:02:00.960
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.560
 of No Such Thing as a Fish,

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.360
 a weekly podcast coming to you

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.520
 from the QI offices in Hoburn.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.840
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.000
 I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 Anna Tyshinski, and James Harkin.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.280
 Once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.960
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.160
 and in a particular order, here we go.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.720
 Starting with fact number one, that is Anna.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.960
 - My fact this week is that every time your heart beats,

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.120
 your memory gets worse,

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.000
 but you become better at firing a gun.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.240
 - Better at firing a what?

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.880
 Sorry, better at firing a gun.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.040
 Better at firing a what?

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.040
 - I see, I see what's happening.

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.240
 - You see what I'm doing there?

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.080
 - Yeah, you expose some obvious flaws in the system.

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.240
 - Your heart beats a lot,

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.400
 and I don't feel like I lose my memory

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.640
 every second in a bit.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.120
 - You are, I think this is useful information to know.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.960
 So if you're ever doing certain things,

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.600
 always do it on the offbeat.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.240
 Other things, do it on the onbeat.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.160
 And I found this a really interesting study I came across

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.280
 about the cardiac cycle, basically,

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.200
 which is the cycle of how your heart beats,

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.520
 which says that in cisterly, which is when it's beating,

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.760
 basically it triggers these barrier receptors,

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.400
 which are nerves in your blood vessels,

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.960
 which clock that the blood vessel is stretching,

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.320
 'cause the heart's just beat, the blood vessel stretches,

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.240
 the barrier receptors send a message to the brain going,

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.720
 "Right, the blood vessels have stretched.

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.640
 "This is how much, this is what's going on."

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.000
 And it sets off all this activity in your brain

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.520
 every time your heart beats.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.000
 And all that activity in your brain,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.720
 which is giving your brain all the information

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.880
 about exactly how much your heart's beat,

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.080
 how hard, how fast, how much the vessel's expanded,

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.000
 that drowns out loads of other stuff

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.240
 that's happening in your brain.

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.000
 So you get worse at lots of stuff,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.040
 like your memory gets worse.

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.720
 - How do they test this, Anna?

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:42.840
 - That's a very good question.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.240
 They rig people up to ECGs

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:49.160
 and they do things like really scare them or they--

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.360
 - So they have more heartbeats.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.200
 Is that what you mean?

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.600
 - No, so they test exactly whether they're on cisterly

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.920
 or diastole, if their heart's beating or not beating,

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.680
 and then they scare them with something,

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.120
 and if their heart's on an on beat,

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.120
 then their reaction will be slightly slower

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.320
 than their heartbeats. - Like reaction times.

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.320
 - Yeah, and they had people in a rifle range

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.040
 and they logged them up to ECGs and they did the same thing.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.880
 - I've got two questions.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.960
 One, memory, is this long-term memory

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.600
 or is it memory in the moment that it's making worse?

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:17.560
 - It's memory in the moment.

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.720
 So I think they'd say, what's Ernzo's name?

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.200
 What's the name of the person who was that next to you

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.880
 yesterday, Dan, and then on the on beat,

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:23.720
 you'd be a bit less--

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.000
 - Dan is not gonna remember that.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.440
 - Any circle step is.

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.000
 - Question two was to do with the gun.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.800
 So I'd read a study a while ago,

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.240
 which is that apparently snipers

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.360
 like to take their shot in between heartbeats.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.320
 - How interesting.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.800
 - Yeah, so they've been doing it wrong.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.240
 - Yeah, that's why they keep missing.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.560
 - Yes, that's why they keep missing.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.680
 - Yeah, well, it's a technique that they do,

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.520
 which is it's a bit of meditation prior to it.

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.640
 Slow breathing, they time the shot.

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.040
 Apparently if your heartbeat is raised

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.280
 and it's much higher than the blood pressure

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.240
 on your trigger finger, like pulses will come in there,

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.520
 it might make you pull a shot slightly differently.

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.000
 - If you ever watch Biaflon,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.600
 which is cross country skiing and then shooting.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:04.560
 - Not at the same time.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.400
 - Not at the same time.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.320
 And that is the critical point

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.600
 because your heart rate gets really, really high

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.200
 because you're doing this really big exercise

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:13.720
 and then you have to shoot.

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.920
 And the best players, the best people

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.000
 like Johannes Tingersboro, people like that,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.840
 he would like really lower, lower, lower his heart rate.

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.800
 And you can see it, they often have it on the screen.

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.200
 It'll say what their heart rate is

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.280
 and you can see it going down, down, down,

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:28.520
 and they won't shoot immediately.

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.200
 They'll let the heartbeat go down and then they'll shoot.

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.440
 - That's really cool.

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:33.760
 So they do, okay, yeah.

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.600
 - And that makes sense to make the heartbeat go down, I guess,

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.840
 'cause you're more focused, you're more relaxed.

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.280
 I've watched my own heartbeat during surgery.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.120
 - What?

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.440
 As in the actual heart itself?

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.160
 - No, I haven't seen my physical heart pumping away.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.560
 I mean, on a screen, I was having a minor operation

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.560
 which I was allowed to stay awake for.

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.040
 And you can see it.

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.240
 And they sort of accidentally left the screen

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.520
 like pointing a bit at my face.

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:58.880
 So I was trying to muck around and speed it up

00:05:58.880 --> 00:05:59.720
 and slow it down.

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:00.560
 It's great fun.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:01.400
 - Were they inside,

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:02.480
 they have something inside your body?

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:03.320
 You said that actually.

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:04.400
 - Oh yeah, oh yeah.

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.120
 - But you didn't have an open heart surgery, did you?

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.840
 - No, I said a minor operation.

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.000
 I like to play it cool,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.360
 but even I would probably say

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:12.440
 that's a medium-sized operation.

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.000
 - And when they actually put the extension in your penis,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.720
 did your heart rate go up or it made that noise

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:18.720
 like a slide or something.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:27.520
 - Can I just say the potential reason for this,

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.840
 evolutionarily, which I also think is really cool.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:30.680
 And just to let you know,

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.560
 is that when your heart doesn't beat,

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.640
 your sensitivity to pain goes down.

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:36.080
 You have a worse memory for words,

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.760
 your concentration is less good,

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.120
 you've got higher fear response,

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.280
 so you're more afraid, more intense reaction,

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.360
 but your reactions are slower.

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.800
 And then on the offbeat,

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.480
 you have a stronger grip,

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:47.640
 so you're stronger,

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.760
 you're more accurate at firing a gun,

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.960
 and your eyes flicker around more.

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:53.880
 And weirdly, I didn't know what happens is

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.360
 when you're under threat,

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:56.720
 what do you think happens to your heart rate?

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.200
 - Speeds up, speeds up.

00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:59.040
 - Incorrect.

00:06:59.040 --> 00:06:59.880
 - What?

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:01.160
 - Isn't this incredible?

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.200
 Immediately after you're under threat,

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.720
 usually your heartbeat for a second slows down.

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:07.880
 Apparently, in an evolutionary sense,

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:10.200
 and that's because for a second,

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:12.880
 it needs to be on the offbeat more often.

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.000
 So when your heartbeat goes slower,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.120
 it's more often on the offbeat,

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.160
 so that you can have fast reactions

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.240
 and process information more.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.960
 So you process everything around you,

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:23.640
 and then it speeds up a lot,

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:24.960
 because as soon as you've done that,

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:26.240
 then it's on the onbeat,

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.000
 and then you're really good at firing a gun,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 or punching someone, or gripping something.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.400
 - I would've thought it would be a part of

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:33.400
 just trying to be quiet, like more quiet,

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:35.160
 so they don't find you.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:36.480
 Not having that pumping heartbeat.

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:38.200
 - Just as psychologically, you'd be like,

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:41.080
 you can hear, you know, you'd be like,

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:43.200
 - Can I just ask for clarification?

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:45.160
 If your heartbeat slows down,

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.880
 and you go from 100 beats to 50 beats,

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:51.680
 that means you also have 50 offbeats in a minute.

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.600
 So does that not mean you have fewer offbeats

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:54.920
 as opposed to more?

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:57.920
 - I think it's more time is spent on an off,

00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:59.600
 so you've got a longer offbeat,

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:01.680
 'cause like an onbeat is always going to be

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.440
 the same amount of time your heart takes to go,

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:05.640
 but to pump the blood out, right?

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:07.640
 But then between them, there's a longer gap.

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:09.440
 - So the offbeat is actually the gap

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:11.720
 between your heart pumping and not pumping.

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:13.120
 - Exactly.

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:15.520
 And this was only in one study that it said,

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.120
 usually the fear response causes your heart

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:18.760
 to immediately slow down and speed up,

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:20.320
 and I couldn't find it many other places,

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:21.440
 but I thought that was fascinating.

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:22.800
 - That was very cool.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:26.160
 Heartbeats are something that I didn't realize

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:29.320
 play quite a feature role in the world of music.

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:33.240
 - Heartbeats is a single by steps.

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:34.080
 But there you go.

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:34.920
 - Is that what you're thinking?

00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:35.760
 - That's not what I'm thinking.

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:38.640
 I mean, artists recording their heartbeats

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:42.000
 or their of their children and putting them into songs

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.360
 have been used multiple times.

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:46.400
 You've get them in print songs in John Lennon,

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:50.800
 very sadly released it as part of an ultrasound heartbeat

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:53.960
 to a child that unfortunately didn't make it full term,

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:55.800
 but so many bands.

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:59.760
 Max Cavallera from Sepultura, he did it.

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:03.520
 Interestingly, Taylor Swift did it for one of her songs, right?

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:07.720
 And it was a song that was re-recorded as you might remember,

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:09.320
 Taylor Swift had this huge moment

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:13.040
 whereby she had her manager claim all of her music.

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:15.720
 So she went and re-recorded every single album.

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:16.560
 - I do remember.

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:18.840
 - So one of these songs contains her heartbeat.

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:22.760
 So she had to replicate the sound recording of her heartbeat.

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:25.360
 So she's got twice recorded heartbeats into tracks,

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:27.560
 but they all get listed in the song credits

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:29.120
 on heartbeat, Taylor Swift.

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:30.080
 - Very nice.

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:31.600
 - So it means you get more money.

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:32.800
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:34.000
 - That's like Phil Collins.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.400
 Do you remember Phil Collins, didn't he do an album

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:37.360
 where it was all Phil Collins?

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:39.960
 And I think he put himself in the credits as everything.

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:42.120
 - So he played like the kazoo when he played it.

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:44.360
 (all laughing)

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:48.000
 - Huge kazoo guy, Collins, yeah, yeah.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:48.920
 - You can't just add more on,

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:49.920
 you can't just add a triangle

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:51.440
 and get paid a whole extra bit, can't you?

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:52.960
 - Well, you can, that's the whole idea.

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:54.600
 So Simon Cowell, that was a story

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:56.400
 that he would play a minor instrument,

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:58.040
 like one cowbell noise,

00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:00.680
 and that would be writer's credits on the songs

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:02.080
 to all his audits that he would get.

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:04.320
 - And that's why we renamed it the cowbell.

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:05.320
 But no one knows.

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:06.160
 - It's so beautiful.

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:07.000
 - It's so beautiful.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.520
 - Very good.

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:10.280
 - When your heart rate synchronizes,

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:11.560
 we've briefly mentioned before, I think,

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:15.600
 that it's choirs, their heartbeats all synchronized.

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:16.440
 It's pretty cool.

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:17.280
 - That is cool.

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:20.080
 - When you go to the theater,

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:22.680
 your heart also synchronizes with the people around you.

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:25.560
 And it lasts into the interval.

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:26.960
 Everyone goes out into the interval,

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:28.280
 with their hearts speeding up,

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:29.280
 sort of going at the same rate.

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:31.320
 - I wonder why we all go to the toilet

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:32.720
 at exactly the same moment

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:35.600
 when there's like five minutes left before the second half.

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.080
 'Cause our hearts is the problem, isn't it?

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:37.920
 - It's the problem.

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:41.400
 - But so that's saying that a movie has a heart rate.

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:43.080
 - Yes, it does.

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:44.480
 - So you could actually probably,

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:47.800
 you know we talked before about how you could do CPR,

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:49.040
 singing a certain type of song,

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:51.000
 because it's the right BPM in order to do it.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.880
 There probably is, like, if you want to go to a movie

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:54.480
 that puts you on this heart rate.

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:55.880
 - No, 'cause it'll go up and down.

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:57.680
 So you'd be caught if it was Titanic, you know,

00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:58.760
 as the ship cracks in half,

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:00.520
 you suddenly have to double the rate of CPR.

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:01.920
 - Oh yeah, but I'm sure there's some like,

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:03.160
 how long are you going to do? - How long are you going to do?

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:04.640
 - Movies where you can just sit for...

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:06.360
 - If you're like, if it's something really tedious,

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:09.800
 like June two, you can just sit all the way through it.

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:12.000
 - That's too slow, the person would die.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.080
 - But if it's something really exciting, yeah, then...

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:16.000
 I mean, you don't need to do it for long.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.320
 How long do you need to do CPR for normally?

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:19.160
 If you...

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:20.000
 - It's all the way through.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.400
 - Okay, yeah, I've done 45 seconds now.

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:24.520
 I'm afraid we've watched the whole

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:26.200
 of the climactic fight scene in Gladiator,

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:28.200
 so I am going to be clocking off, yeah.

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:31.800
 Pig hearts, you know how we were all going to get

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:33.120
 pig hearts a while ago? - Oh yeah.

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:33.960
 - That was going to be the big thing.

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:35.080
 - I know, I was so excited.

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:37.560
 - It's so complicated, the process.

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:39.320
 'Cause basically pigs are very similar to people

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:40.760
 in lots of ways physiologically.

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:42.600
 And there was an idea that we were going to be able

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:46.360
 to transplant pig hearts into people.

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:48.800
 And that was going to be, 'cause there are loads of pigs,

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:50.080
 I mean, there are hundreds of millions of pigs

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:52.600
 around the world. - Sure, just sitting there

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:55.240
 with their hearts beating away and around, oink oink.

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:56.840
 - We're not using them for anything, right?

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:57.680
 - Exactly.

00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:00.880
 - So let's steal their hearts for us.

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:02.280
 It's pretty sinister as a species.

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:04.160
 Anyway, but it turns out you have to do so much stuff,

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.240
 you have to make the pig more human before you do this.

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:07.080
 - How do you do that?

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:07.920
 Dress it up.

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:10.280
 - Give it a newspaper.

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:11.520
 - Sprig it to the movies.

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:13.400
 - Like grandma, what big trotters you have?

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:17.760
 Yeah, it's so, no, you can't just take a,

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:19.640
 like take a heart out of a pig and shove it in the person.

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:22.040
 You have to take a pig, right?

00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:25.080
 Remove three of its genes, knock out some growth hormones.

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:27.280
 - So you have to dress it up.

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:29.160
 - Knock out some growth hormones.

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:30.240
 Add a couple of other genes.

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:32.040
 Then you have to keep the pig nice and clean,

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:33.920
 so it doesn't get any pig bacteria.

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:38.560
 Then you breed from that pig and you make these GM embryos,

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:40.400
 you put them in surrogate cells,

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:42.480
 and then you have to give the mummy pig a C-section

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:44.800
 so that it doesn't get contaminated at all.

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:46.600
 And then those piglets have to be bred up

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:47.440
 until they're big enough.

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:48.280
 - Wow.

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:50.520
 - And those are then the sort of a bit more human pigs.

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:52.000
 They've had no contact with the outside world,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.560
 no external viruses.

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:54.400
 Those are the ones that--

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:55.800
 - And has anyone ever had this?

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:57.640
 - I think two people have, and they both didn't survive.

00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:59.280
 - Well, one of them built a house out of straw,

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:00.800
 the other one built a house out of sticks,

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:02.640
 and they never made it.

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:04.120
 - No wonder we don't use it.

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:06.040
 You got to, it's like, we found a match,

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:08.320
 we now just have to get it pregnant.

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:11.120
 - By it didn't first.

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:14.440
 - Let it birth some, and then take their hearts.

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:15.680
 - Anna's right, a couple of people have had it,

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:17.480
 but I think it didn't, it didn't--

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:19.680
 - I think the reason is like hearts in all mammals

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:22.000
 are kind of the same, aren't they really?

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:22.840
 - Right.

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:25.160
 - They all work the same way with electrical impulses,

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:27.080
 and they have sodium and potassium

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:28.520
 that make the electricity happen,

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:30.800
 and they're all kind of the same, so that's the idea.

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:34.120
 - Is it right that we have a billion beats, all mammals?

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:34.960
 - Three billion.

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:36.720
 - We've got roughly the same number, yeah.

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:37.680
 - Humans get about three billion.

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:38.760
 Humans get a bit more, basically,

00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:41.560
 'cause our life is longer because we have invented indoors.

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:44.600
 And indoors is a more relaxing environment, and--

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:45.480
 - But like we're similar enough

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:46.960
 that we have roughly the same--

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:49.200
 - You do, but it's not like you have that number.

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:51.120
 Like Donald Trump thinks that you have a certain number,

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:53.720
 and if you use them up, then that's when you die.

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:55.520
 And that's why he doesn't like to do any exercise

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:57.320
 apart from play golf.

00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:59.320
 And I think a few other famous people have thought that.

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:00.880
 Maybe Neil Armstrong thought that.

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:03.520
 - I think, I think, yeah, yeah, no, there's a quote.

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:05.000
 I think they've looked into it.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.840
 - Maybe as a joke, he said, "You only get a certain amount,

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:08.160
 "and I'm down if I'm gonna use all mine

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:09.280
 "running up and down the street."

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:10.940
 - Oh, well, that's a funny line.

00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:12.520
 - That's interesting, when you're playing golf,

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:15.480
 because it is reduced, is it better to play in the gaps?

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:17.120
 - Well, you know what, I'd never thought that before,

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:18.800
 but I'm gonna try that next time on the course.

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:21.240
 - Yeah, I think that's why small animals

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:22.080
 don't live as long, isn't it?

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:23.680
 'Cause as a small animal, you have to,

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:26.440
 your heart beats faster and so use them up.

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:27.920
 - I got one last thing before we move on.

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:30.440
 Have you guys heard of the Intimacy 2.0 dress?

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:31.480
 - No.

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:33.120
 - No, okay, let me guess.

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:34.800
 It's a dress you wear.

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:35.640
 - Correct.

00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:39.120
 - And two people wear it, and it syncs your heartbeats,

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:41.720
 and it changes color with the heartbeats

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:44.520
 so you can see that each is flashing at the same time

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:45.360
 and that you're in sync.

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:47.800
 - Is it like a dress version of paddles, basically?

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:49.800
 (all laugh)

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:51.760
 - Aggressively stops your heart and restarts in that,

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:53.320
 tell you what I'm saying.

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:54.160
 - No, no.

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:55.800
 - Does it change color?

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:59.120
 Does it go transparent if your heart rate rises?

00:14:59.120 --> 00:14:59.960
 - There we go.

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:02.040
 - Is that what Kanye West's partner was wearing?

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:04.520
 She was just so excited to be at the Grammys.

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:06.600
 Her heart was going 10 a second.

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:07.600
 - But it's basically that.

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:08.920
 So it's a dress that you would wear.

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:11.520
 Obviously no one is wearing this, as far as I can tell.

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:14.040
 And it's got a neckline that plunges to the midriff,

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:17.300
 which if your heart rate rises and you're out on a date,

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:20.880
 it slowly makes the dress more transparent around these,

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:22.840
 yeah, sort of like the cleavage area and so on,

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:24.800
 in order to, yeah.

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:26.360
 So it's just enhancing.

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:27.800
 - In the woods, you're wearing it

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:29.560
 and you're threatened by a lion.

00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:31.720
 Now the lion's seen your naked flesh exposed.

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:33.000
 That makes the duration even worse.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.080
 - Well, fortunately, when you're panicked,

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:35.040
 your heart rate goes down.

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:36.000
 So you should be fine.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:36.840
 - Good point.

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:38.200
 - Have you learned nothing from this section?

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:39.040
 - Where'd she go?

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:40.040
 (all laugh)

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:42.620
 (upbeat music)

00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:46.680
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two

00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:48.580
 and that is James.

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:51.220
 - Okay, my fact this week is that in 2023,

00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:53.500
 a team mapping the ocean floor

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:57.460
 announced they may have found Amelia Earhart's plane.

00:15:57.460 --> 00:16:00.180
 In 2024, they announced it was actually

00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:02.700
 a plane-shaped pile of rocks.

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:03.540
 (all laugh)

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:04.700
 - Could they not have looked a bit closer

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:05.940
 the first time round?

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:06.780
 Got a second opinion.

00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:07.620
 - It's at the bottom of the sea, Anna.

00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:08.460
 - Ah, it's very hot.

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:12.060
 It's amazing they found such a plane-shaped pile of rocks.

00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:14.380
 It would have been cool if they had just announced

00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:16.760
 we found a wicked pile of rocks shaped like a plane down there.

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:17.600
 - Yeah.

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:18.420
 - But they had to go a bit further

00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:20.480
 and say it's one of the most famous lost planes ever.

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:22.360
 - Yeah, so this is Amelia Earhart.

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:24.000
 We've mentioned her once or twice before.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.760
 She was flying around the world in 1937

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:29.400
 and she was about 100 miles from a place

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:32.360
 called Howland Island, which is in Kiribati.

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:34.520
 And she started running out of fuel

00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:37.120
 and we never heard from her again, basically.

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:40.920
 She gave one last radio call and then disappeared

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:43.760
 and for the subsequent 90 years,

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:45.540
 people have been wondering what's happened to her.

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:46.380
 - Yeah.

00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:48.420
 And she was really, she was well-famous wasn't she?

00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:49.260
 - Oh yeah, yeah.

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.780
 - Incredibly celebrated aviate tricks.

00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:54.060
 - Yeah, prior to the disappearance as well, which is-

00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:54.900
 - Yeah, absolutely.

00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:56.580
 - Often sometimes these things make you.

00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:59.260
 - She broke in so many records and things like that

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:00.420
 and she'd done a lot of trips,

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:02.580
 which was the first time a woman might have made those flights

00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:03.420
 and things like that.

00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:04.260
 She was amazing.

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:06.460
 - And this is a group called Deepsea Vision,

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:08.660
 the CEO, Tony Romeo,

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:11.300
 who's a former U.S. Air Force intelligence officer,

00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:13.180
 said that they'd found these.

00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:14.020
 (laughs)

00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:15.280
 Rocks said that they found this plane

00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:16.800
 or what they thought was a plane

00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:17.960
 and then they've done a bit more work

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:20.040
 and they realized that it is some rocks.

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:23.320
 And Tony said, "Talk about the cruelest formation

00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:25.080
 "ever created by nature."

00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:25.920
 - Yeah.

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:26.760
 - And I can only agree.

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:27.600
 - 'Cause it was, yeah,

00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:28.720
 it's a hundred miles from Holland Island, right?

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:30.720
 So if you see a plane shape.

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:31.560
 - I don't mean to be morbid,

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:32.880
 but when a plane hits the water,

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:34.840
 it often, especially a 1930s plane,

00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:37.560
 it might not stay looking like a pristine plane

00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:39.360
 all the way to the ocean bottom, you know?

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:40.200
 - Absolutely.

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:41.720
 And what were they using to see it?

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:44.460
 Was it like a sonar thing that sent back a vague shape?

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:45.740
 - The image does look pretty good.

00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:46.580
 - Is it very plain?

00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:48.020
 - Oh yeah, it's even got a little tail fin on it.

00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:49.520
 - Yeah, it looks very plain like.

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:50.360
 - Does it?

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:52.500
 - It was a huge search for her at the time.

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:54.980
 As in, the U.S. Navy did a lot of searching.

00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:57.340
 They even sent, I think, an aircraft carrier

00:17:57.340 --> 00:18:00.260
 to the region, which had 63 aircraft on it.

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:03.340
 So, you know, all those planes can go out making trips.

00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:04.700
 - I thought you meant like an empty one,

00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:07.140
 optimistically hoping to carry her aircraft back.

00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:07.980
 (laughs)

00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:10.900
 - Yeah, and it cost them about four million U.S. dollars

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:14.000
 at the time, it was about 90 million U.S. dollars today.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.280
 This, and of course they didn't find her.

00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:18.640
 And actually that became kind of the end

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:21.800
 of celebrity aviation because at that time,

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:24.440
 the loads of celebrity flyers who were doing loads

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:26.560
 of crazy stunts and everyone that they're on the front page

00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:30.200
 of all the newspapers, but when Emilia Earhart disappeared,

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:32.640
 Congress decided to make it illegal for the Navy

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:34.840
 to spend any money on search and rescue.

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:36.760
 And when they did that, everyone just stopped

00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:37.600
 carrying a little bit.

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:38.440
 - Wow.

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:40.280
 - Yeah, there were all these psychics who were claiming

00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:41.820
 that they were in touch with her.

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:43.940
 And the family were looking for anything.

00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:45.540
 So, they were going to see psychics

00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:47.220
 and hoping to follow up on things.

00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:48.860
 There was this story that we mentioned briefly,

00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:50.700
 which was the Tokyo Rose story.

00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:52.860
 It's the idea that the Japanese had got hold

00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:54.780
 of Emilia Earhart, she was captured,

00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:57.500
 and she was putting out propaganda radio news

00:18:57.500 --> 00:18:58.820
 about what was going on in the war.

00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:00.460
 - So, Tokyo Rose was real, right?

00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:01.300
 - Yeah.

00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:02.820
 - That was actually, but they were saying that that was her.

00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:03.860
 - That was, they were saying it was her,

00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:05.980
 but what's interesting is her husband,

00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:07.900
 'cause she was married, Emilia Earhart,

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:08.940
 to a guy called George Putnam.

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:10.480
 He actually made a three-day trek

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:12.560
 through a Japanese-held territory

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:14.600
 so that he could get to a US Marine radio station

00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:16.720
 to confirm whether or not it was her voice.

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:18.360
 So, it was taken really seriously,

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:20.760
 even by the immediate family, some of these,

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:21.600
 some of these theories.

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:22.440
 - I think that was one of the ones

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:24.200
 that vaguely sane people believe.

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:25.040
 - Yeah.

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:26.240
 - The person who was in charge of the island.

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:28.920
 I have to say, I find that Emilia Earhart searches,

00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:31.120
 I have a real blank like with Jack the Ripper on them.

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:33.960
 I'm like, "God, get a life, guys."

00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:35.360
 A lot of them, no offence.

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:36.200
 - Interesting.

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:37.760
 - Also, welcome to the podcast.

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:39.580
 We appreciate you listening.

00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:41.900
 - It's interesting you've made these people your bet noir.

00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:42.740
 - I don't know why.

00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:43.860
 - The people, relatively blind-minded people,

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:45.700
 trying to solve a classic mystery.

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:47.100
 - New enemies of the podcast.

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:47.940
 - Yeah.

00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:49.260
 - I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:50.620
 You can buy stuff from their website.

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:52.060
 Look, I'll advertise for them.

00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:54.780
 They sell little, they sell t-shirts, they sell badges.

00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:57.140
 If you wanna help fund their expeditions,

00:19:57.140 --> 00:20:01.060
 each trip costs up to $500,000 to go and uncover

00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:03.860
 another rusty jackknife or compact mirror in the ocean

00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:05.620
 that you say belong to Emilia Earhart.

00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:06.460
 - Sounds good.

00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:07.300
 - Okay.

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:09.520
 - So just on sort of the ocean

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:11.560
 and the mysteries of the ocean.

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:14.340
 Something that I read about, which is a big problem

00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:19.040
 for a lot of boats out in the open sea now, is UFOs.

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:19.880
 - Oh, no.

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:24.760
 - Unidentified floating objects.

00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:26.640
 So this is to do with container ships.

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:28.360
 And container ships, when they're in rough seas,

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:31.040
 they can lose, so many containers have gone missing.

00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:34.040
 There was an estimate between 1985 and 2007,

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:37.080
 five to six million container units

00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:37.920
 would be floating--

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:38.740
 - Wow, it's mental.

00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:39.580
 - Yeah, and--

00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:40.420
 - Do they all float?

00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:42.420
 - They do for a while, so they can for a few weeks.

00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:44.580
 If a container is up to 80% full,

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:46.580
 then you've got enough air in there for it to,

00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:47.780
 but they're not airtight,

00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:50.580
 so they will eventually seep water and go down.

00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:52.940
 So a lot of ships just say that if they're out,

00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:54.900
 these come out of nowhere, 'cause they're not mapped right.

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:58.620
 So you're dodging UFOs all the way through the ocean.

00:20:58.620 --> 00:20:59.460
 - Wow.

00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:01.180
 - Yeah, we're just constantly losing giant containers

00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:02.740
 off the back of ships.

00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:05.540
 - Other mysterious things in the ocean.

00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:06.780
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:08.960
 - Well, one big ocean mystery is,

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:10.660
 you know all the plastic in the ocean?

00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:11.940
 - Yes, yeah.

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:13.100
 - Well, where is it?

00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:13.940
 - In the ocean.

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:14.780
 - It's not nearly enough there.

00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:16.040
 - It's in the garbage patch, isn't it?

00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:17.360
 - Well, not nearly enough, James.

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:18.200
 - What do you mean?

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:19.880
 - Let's get more in there, guys.

00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:22.220
 - Yeah, what is the problem you're trying to solve here?

00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:23.200
 - This plastic.

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:24.460
 - It's in animals.

00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:26.080
 - No, we don't know, so you,

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:27.800
 well, we're starting to find out,

00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:30.400
 but basically 99% of the plastic

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:32.920
 that should be in the ocean is not in the ocean.

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:33.760
 We keep on looking,

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:36.240
 and most of what is there is in the garbage patch,

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:38.620
 but a lot of that is kind of old plastic,

00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:40.460
 and we don't know where the newer plastic's gone,

00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:41.780
 whereas you'd think the older plastic

00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:43.660
 would be the stuff that degrades, if anything,

00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:45.380
 and is getting smaller and disappearing.

00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:48.380
 - So when you say it's not there, sorry, what do you mean?

00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:51.220
 - So in the surveys that we've done of the ocean,

00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:53.580
 looking at how much ocean plastic there is,

00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:55.780
 we haven't found nearly enough to equate

00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:59.300
 with how much we estimate we've been flushing into the ocean,

00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:00.780
 and it's called dark plastic,

00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:02.180
 and they equate it with dark matter.

00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:03.580
 - I knew, I knew.

00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:05.380
 The climate change was a hoax

00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:07.560
 in this whole environmental push.

00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:08.640
 I knew it.

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:09.480
 - It's actually not,

00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:11.080
 it's only quite for the climate change,

00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:12.180
 but it's not quite the same.

00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:13.020
 - Yeah, but that's crazy.

00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:14.660
 - So is this scary, Anna?

00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:16.980
 'Cause presumably it's somewhere bad.

00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:19.640
 - No, it's actually somewhere good.

00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:21.580
 I think the latest research shows,

00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:22.580
 and this is great news.

00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:25.220
 - Anna, this is a roller coaster of the fair.

00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:28.180
 - I like to keep your heart beats fluctuating.

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:31.300
 The latest research is a guy called Lauren Lebriton,

00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:34.280
 who's an oceanographer who ran this big computer model,

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:36.260
 looking at how the plastic that we know about

00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:38.240
 gets distributed, where it lands in the ocean,

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:39.820
 where it floats to and stuff.

00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:42.860
 He's concluded that the vast majority

00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:44.820
 of macro plastics and micro plastics,

00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:46.260
 so big and small bits,

00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:48.300
 rather than being lost in the middle of the ocean

00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:49.940
 or deep down where we don't know,

00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:52.220
 they actually all wash up on beaches

00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:54.860
 on a buried in shorelines or a right on the coastline.

00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:55.700
 - Interesting.

00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:56.880
 - Which to me says, great,

00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:58.740
 I always thought we can't get that plastic back.

00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:00.580
 I can't row out to sea and get it back.

00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:02.140
 But if all you need to do is go to a beach.

00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:03.100
 - That's great, we just need to pick up

00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:05.540
 the baby turtles it's choked to death on the beach.

00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:06.380
 - Well, it's amazing.

00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:08.580
 - Under the beach is the lug worms who are getting it back.

00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:09.420
 - Oh no.

00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:10.880
 - I know the lug, the poor lugs.

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:11.720
 No one talks about them.

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:12.540
 - And it's gonna turn out the lug worms

00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:15.340
 with a keystone species keeping this whole thing going,

00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:16.500
 and we'll be sorry.

00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:17.660
 That's really interesting though.

00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:19.500
 - It just seems more accessible, doesn't it?

00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:21.440
 - Does it make it easier for us to deal with

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:23.960
 if we can work out technologies to do that?

00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:26.000
 I understand animals will die, obviously, but like.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.660
 - I think really the problem is stopping it

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:29.240
 from entering the oceans in the first place.

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:30.080
 - Yeah.

00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:31.320
 - But I mean, I think once it gets to the coast,

00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:32.960
 to me, I mean, this is new research,

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:35.220
 but it seems like it would be easier to access

00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:36.780
 once it's not in the middle of nowhere.

00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:37.820
 It looks like it.

00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:40.180
 So get to your beach, people, with a bucket and spade.

00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:41.220
 - Yeah, nice.

00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:43.180
 - Have you guys heard of dark oxygen?

00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:44.220
 (laughing)

00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:45.320
 - Dark oxygen.

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:47.020
 - Dark oxygen.

00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:49.820
 - So by extension, it's, there's not as much oxygen

00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:50.980
 as we thought there should be.

00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:51.820
 - Yeah.

00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:53.660
 - And some of it's missing.

00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:55.820
 - This is stuff that's found on the ocean floor.

00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:56.660
 - Yeah.

00:23:56.660 --> 00:24:01.580
 - And it's produced this dark oxygen by battery rocks.

00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:02.420
 - Okay.

00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:04.880
 - These are the nodules, metallic nodules

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:07.640
 that are all over huge chunks of the ocean floor

00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:12.120
 around the world, and they make oxygen without light.

00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:13.400
 They do it chemically.

00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:15.400
 So they split the water molecules around them

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:17.200
 into hydrogen and oxygen.

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:18.800
 So that's insane.

00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:19.960
 I mean, that's the source of oxygen.

00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:21.160
 - Yeah, it's like putting an electric,

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:23.920
 like we would make on a chemistry lesson.

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:24.760
 - Electrolysis.

00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:25.600
 - It's crackers.

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:26.440
 Yeah, yeah.

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:28.800
 - Are these connected to ocean farts?

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:29.640
 - No.

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:30.480
 (laughing)

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:32.200
 - Walk in one of those in a minute.

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:35.360
 - I just love the idea of having me doing a lecture

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:38.440
 and dancing on the front row with questions like,

00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:40.600
 if you could put your hand down until we end up.

00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:41.960
 (laughing)

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:46.040
 - We will have a question and answer session by in writing.

00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:48.280
 (laughing)

00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:52.240
 - Go on, please go on.

00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:55.600
 - How can I possibly continue talking about something

00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:59.120
 really interesting when you say, about ocean farts?

00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:00.840
 And that's how the disruptive kids do it.

00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:01.680
 - Yeah.

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:03.040
 This is why no one learns anything.

00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:03.880
 - Yeah.

00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:04.720
 - Yeah.

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:05.540
 No, it's just interesting

00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:07.320
 'cause there's a huge debate at the moment.

00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:08.400
 I'm sure you're all keeping up with it

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:10.400
 in the International Seabed Authority

00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:12.920
 about ocean mining the ocean floor.

00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:14.760
 Are we going to do it?

00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:16.320
 Should we definitely not do it?

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:17.760
 And...

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:18.840
 - Well, the problem is,

00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:20.040
 one of the big problems is,

00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:21.960
 obviously logically you say we shouldn't do it,

00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:24.480
 but it contains so much stuff like lithium

00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:25.320
 that you need.

00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:26.440
 If everyone's gonna have an electric car,

00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:29.200
 you need these minerals and where you're gonna get them from.

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:31.440
 So it's like this weird sort of balance.

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:32.480
 - Do you get them from land,

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:33.840
 which we know causes some damage,

00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:34.880
 do we get them from the ocean,

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:37.080
 where we really have no idea what effect it would have.

00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:38.720
 - It might be none.

00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:40.800
 - Might be absolutely fine.

00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:43.120
 Why not just do it, assuming it'll be none.

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:44.720
 - That's really big, the ocean, isn't it?

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:45.680
 - Oh, it's huge, yeah.

00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:47.640
 So, but it is a really big debate at the moment.

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:48.760
 - So, wait, these batteries,

00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:51.760
 how are they, are we mining these big ocean floor batteries?

00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:53.560
 - These are the nodules that people want to mine

00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:55.160
 because they contain these metals.

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:56.880
 And so it's being debated at the moment.

00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:58.880
 And it was found in a study,

00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:00.240
 which was funded by a mining firm,

00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:01.560
 which is desperate to mine the ocean.

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:02.400
 And then it turned out,

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:04.080
 oh, these might be a really important source of oxygen

00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:05.160
 for all kinds of life.

00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:06.160
 And so they were furious

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:07.920
 that they'd accidentally funded this study.

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:10.120
 - One of the problem is that they are mostly found

00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:12.600
 in something that's called silicious ooze.

00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:16.320
 Silicious ooze is this kind of really low sediment

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:17.920
 at the bottom of the ocean,

00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:20.520
 but it accumulates about one to three millimeters

00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:22.600
 every thousand years.

00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:25.400
 So once you dig it up, it's going to take a while to get back.

00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:28.000
 - Oh, 'cause we're probably going to dig faster than that.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.080
 'Cause we dig faster than one to three millimeters, don't we?

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:33.200
 - My company is suggesting that we will do faster than that.

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:35.400
 - And I've invested, so.

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:36.240
 - Interesting.

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:38.480
 - Well, there is one kind of ocean drilling, which is good.

00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:40.640
 And that's the scientific research kind.

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:43.840
 And the first mission was really cool.

00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:45.960
 It was in 1957, and it was organized

00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:49.200
 by this group called the American Miscellaneous Society.

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:50.160
 - I love them already.

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:51.120
 - They are so cool.

00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:53.200
 They're like the ignobles of their time.

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:55.400
 They were a bunch of geologists and oceanographers

00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:58.240
 who just wanted to get together and have weird ideas.

00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:00.880
 Anyway, there was this thing called Project Moho,

00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:02.360
 which they started,

00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:06.080
 which was to investigate the Mohorovich discontinuity.

00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:08.280
 - It sounds sci-fi, doesn't it?

00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:09.120
 - Yeah.

00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:10.960
 - The Mohorovich discontinuity

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:13.160
 has been producing dark oxygen.

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:14.920
 - It does sound like someone who thought,

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:16.760
 I'm going to write it as a Russian name.

00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:18.680
 And they go, no, no, that's not Russian enough.

00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:20.800
 Let's put another it to the end.

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:22.800
 There are too many O's and too many itches in it,

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:24.200
 for me, to be honest.

00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:26.640
 But that's this bit between the crust of the Earth

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:27.520
 and the mantle,

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:30.880
 where suddenly seismic waves start moving much faster.

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:32.680
 And it was the only reason we knew back then

00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:34.080
 that there was an Earth's crust.

00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:36.000
 So these guys, the Miscellaneous Society,

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.640
 were like, well, let's go and dig into the ocean

00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:39.600
 and find out what's happening.

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:40.800
 It ended up being a failure,

00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:42.720
 but it started off this thing that happens today,

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:44.840
 a lot where we dig into the ocean floor

00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:46.120
 and pull up all these cores

00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:47.720
 and find out loads of cool stuff.

00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:50.640
 And the person who came along with them to write about it,

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:52.080
 and to report about it,

00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:56.280
 was oceanography fan and big lover of the sea,

00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:57.200
 taking a guess.

00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:58.400
 - James Cameron.

00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:00.840
 - Ah, he, I think in a former life,

00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:02.040
 maybe this is who he was.

00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:02.960
 - Jack Cousteau.

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:03.800
 - In '57.

00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:04.640
 - Ooh, Jack Cousteau.

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:06.120
 - Yeah, no.

00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:07.440
 Oh, I can give you a clue by saying,

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:08.720
 one of the lesser books he wrote

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:12.000
 was called Steinbeck and Ricketts Sea of Cortez.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.200
 - So John Steinbeck.

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:14.320
 - So it was John Steinbeck.

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:16.920
 (all laughing)

00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:21.160
 - He absolutely loved the sea and oceanography.

00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:22.000
 - Really?

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.480
 - So he hopped on board this research boat

00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:24.320
 and recourse for it.

00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:25.400
 - That's so good.

00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:27.040
 Mentioning Jack Cousteau,

00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:30.520
 the Calypso and his efforts of ocean mapping

00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:32.480
 are some of the greatest that we've ever had.

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:33.320
 On his ship.

00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:34.160
 - With the Calypso, his ship.

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:35.000
 - The Calypso was the ship,

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.520
 it was a very famous ship.

00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:38.960
 And he had three tanks

00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:40.520
 that would be there to take out to sea.

00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:42.040
 So you had the diesel to run the ship,

00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:43.520
 you had the water to drink.

00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:45.320
 What do you think his third tank was?

00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:47.160
 - Probably ocean farts.

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:48.960
 - Which he's bottled with, yes.

00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:49.800
 - Along the way?

00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:50.640
 - Thank you for reminding me.

00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:52.920
 We didn't pick up on my question.

00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:55.400
 - It's just like bilge water to keep him.

00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:56.320
 - Wastewater?

00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:57.160
 - Yeah, wastewater.

00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:58.120
 - So it did not pollute the sea?

00:28:58.120 --> 00:28:58.960
 - No.

00:28:58.960 --> 00:28:59.800
 - Is it just whiskey or something?

00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:00.840
 - It's wine.

00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:04.280
 He had a giant wine tank attached to the ship

00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:05.120
 in order to.

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:06.040
 - For drinking?

00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:06.880
 - Of course for drinking.

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:08.800
 - Right, not for some kind of fuel purpose.

00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:10.200
 - It's Jack Cousteau.

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:12.640
 He's gonna be, and his French buddies,

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:14.320
 drinking as they're...

00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:15.160
 - Amazing.

00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:16.480
 - Have you guys heard of,

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:19.440
 while we're talking about weird rock formations?

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:22.560
 Do you guys know about the Ararat Anomaly?

00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:24.200
 - So Mount Ararat?

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:26.120
 - Mount Ararat, yes.

00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:27.360
 - Above land?

00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:28.200
 - It's above land.

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:29.680
 - Oh, is it that there are loads of fossils

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:32.680
 that should be ocean things on Mount Ararat?

00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:35.080
 - There are those, but that's not what this is.

00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:37.120
 This is if people have taken photos

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:39.520
 of the snow near the summit of Mount Ararat,

00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:43.080
 there's something that looks very much like Noah's Ark.

00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:43.920
 - Brilliant.

00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:45.040
 - And if you see the pictures,

00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:46.520
 you can kind of see where they're coming from.

00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:47.720
 I mean, they're very fuzzy.

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:48.880
 But the interesting thing is,

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:52.800
 this was classified as secret for the U.S. Air Force

00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:56.560
 from 1949 until the '90s.

00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:57.880
 - Wow.

00:29:57.880 --> 00:29:59.960
 - And it's in snow, it's like a snow arc.

00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:03.040
 - It's kind of, it's basically just a jagged bit of rock.

00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:04.720
 - A snow, it's an arc shaped pile of rocks.

00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:06.520
 - Precisely, okay.

00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:08.600
 Yeah, why do you think it was classified as secret

00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:10.280
 for so long?

00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:12.600
 - Because it might provoke religious conflict.

00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:14.040
 - Interesting, because obviously,

00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:16.320
 a lot of believers think that this is evidence,

00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:19.120
 that the Bible is true, but no, that wasn't it.

00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:20.520
 - Okay.

00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:23.800
 - It's much more Cotidian, much more boring than that.

00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:25.880
 - People might visit if they didn't want to visit.

00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:29.280
 - Basically, it's on the border of the Soviet Union.

00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:32.360
 And so there was lots of things happening around there

00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:34.040
 between America and the Soviet Union,

00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:36.240
 so they didn't want any photos coming out.

00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:40.240
 But obviously the conspiracy theorists were like,

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:41.080
 oh, what are you hiding?

00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:41.920
 What are you hiding?

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:43.320
 - Yeah, Noah's Ark.

00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:46.760
 - Noah's in there, you're keeping him prisoner.

00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:48.640
 - I've got one last thing, it's very silly,

00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:50.240
 but I was looking into people

00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:52.480
 and how they managed to survive the ocean

00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:55.160
 once they'd been lost and people are out looking for them.

00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:58.640
 So there was a group of people, eight men and seven women,

00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:01.880
 and they were stuck out on a sort of life raft situation.

00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:03.360
 No one there to save them.

00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:06.040
 They have no water, how do they survive?

00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:06.880
 And they managed 12 days.

00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:08.560
 - Huge barrel of wide floats up.

00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:11.440
 How long did they manage?

00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:13.160
 - I think they were out there for 12 days.

00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:15.200
 - Like drinking turtle blood, that is not okay.

00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:16.320
 - So we're in that territory,

00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:18.280
 they've got to find a source of food.

00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:20.400
 - Drinking the little bit of liquid you get

00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:23.200
 in a fish's eye, we've said that before.

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:26.320
 - We covered turtle blood enemas in the past.

00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:28.080
 - Yeah, turtle blood enemas.

00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:30.760
 - They were on a journey to Puerto Rico.

00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:35.200
 So one of the people on the boat was Faustina Mercedes.

00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:37.880
 She had back at home a one-year-old daughter,

00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:40.440
 which meant she was still lactating.

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:42.320
 She was lactating.

00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:46.280
 And so she offered up her breasts to everyone on the boat.

00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:47.360
 And every day.

00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:48.560
 - How many people were on the boat?

00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:49.880
 - There were a lot, there were eight men.

00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:50.720
 - It was a cruise ship.

00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:51.800
 (all laughing)

00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:52.880
 - 2,000 people.

00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:53.720
 - Oh, Lord.

00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:54.560
 - Killing up every day.

00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:55.760
 (all laughing)

00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:57.280
 - Eight men, seven women.

00:31:57.280 --> 00:32:00.360
 Every day they would take a quick couple of sips,

00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:02.880
 and then that was just keeping them at bay.

00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:04.520
 And in order to feed herself,

00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:06.760
 her sister would go on the breast

00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:08.520
 and then pass the milk back to her.

00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:09.560
 - Oh, clever.

00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:10.400
 - Yeah.

00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:11.240
 - Wait, does that keep her going?

00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:14.400
 Does that, it feels like that doesn't make any sense.

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:15.400
 It doesn't make any sense.

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:17.120
 I know many people have pointed this out,

00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:17.960
 but it's-

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:19.160
 - We're not producing milk out of nowhere.

00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:21.440
 - But it deals with your dry mouth, you know?

00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:22.280
 - It's basically,

00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:24.720
 they're very, very slowly cannibalizing this woman.

00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:25.560
 - Yes.

00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:26.400
 - Yeah.

00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:27.240
 - Yeah.

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:28.080
 - And our motherhood-

00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:29.920
 - She must have been quite saggy by the end,

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:30.760
 was she?

00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:31.600
 - When she got back,

00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:33.840
 she said she was unable to feed her own child

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:35.400
 because of the, it was pretty traumatic.

00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:36.240
 It was pretty weird.

00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:37.080
 - It was highly unsurprising.

00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:37.920
 - She said it was weird, yeah.

00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:38.760
 - Well.

00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:40.000
 - That's, that is weird.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:40.840
 - It is weird.

00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:42.360
 - I'm with her on that one.

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:44.600
 - It's also, it's also the ending of,

00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:45.720
 loop it right around,

00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:46.840
 "The Grapes of Roth".

00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:49.280
 (all laughing)

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:51.400
 - It is, "The Grapes of Roth" ends with a lady-

00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:52.240
 - Yeah, we're suckling on it.

00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:53.760
 - It ends with a young lady suckling an old man

00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:54.960
 who's starving to death.

00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:56.400
 It's the Dust Bowl America.

00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:57.240
 It's, that is the final seat.

00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:58.080
 - That's not right.

00:32:58.080 --> 00:32:58.920
 - That's the final seat.

00:32:58.920 --> 00:32:59.880
 - That's an incredible full circle.

00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:02.200
 I am only a hundred pages into "The Grapes of Roth",

00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:03.800
 10 years ago, fine, I never got any.

00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:06.000
 (all laughing)

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.580
 (upbeat music)

00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:13.280
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:15.160
 and that is my fact.

00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:17.880
 My fact this week is that when the Forbidden City in China

00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:20.160
 had its first telephone installed,

00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:25.040
 it was first used by the emperor to make prank phone calls.

00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:28.560
 This was the last emperor of China known as Puyi.

00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:30.840
 And after having the phone installed,

00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:32.320
 he went through a phone book.

00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:34.160
 He found one of his favorite opera singers,

00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:35.640
 a guy called Yang Xiaolu.

00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:37.480
 And he called him up and he said,

00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:39.040
 "Is this the great operatic singer?"

00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:39.880
 And he said, "Yes."

00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:41.360
 And then he just giggled and hung up.

00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:43.280
 - He hadn't developed the pranks by that point.

00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:45.160
 - No, that's not Bart Simpson level.

00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:48.640
 - No, the second one is closer to sort of teenage pranking.

00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:50.840
 He would call up local restaurants

00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:52.920
 and he would order a bunch of food to an address

00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:54.760
 that wasn't brilliant, the Forbidden City.

00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:57.360
 - And so here's a question.

00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:59.760
 It sounds like everyone in the country

00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:01.720
 had telephones apart from him.

00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:02.560
 - Yeah, possibly.

00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:03.400
 I mean, well, they, you know,

00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:05.560
 the emperor was kind of isolated from the rest of the world.

00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:07.200
 They were sort of, no one was really allowed

00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:09.480
 into the Forbidden City who weren't part of the system.

00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:11.480
 - Okay, you should probably explain who he was then.

00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:12.680
 - Well, yes.

00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:15.400
 So he was the, he was no longer really the emperor

00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:18.080
 by the time we were talking about when he was a teenager.

00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:19.640
 So he was born in 1906.

00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:21.520
 He became the emperor in 1908.

00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:23.360
 And he was deposed in 1911

00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:25.440
 because he, you know, he did such a terrible job.

00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:27.720
 - Yeah, they screwed him up.

00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:29.800
 - He thrown his ties out of the pram or something.

00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:31.520
 - It was like having Boris Johnson in charge over there.

00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:35.520
 - Yeah, so he, but he was allowed to stay in a palace

00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:38.840
 and keep living as though he were the supreme authority,

00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:39.680
 even though he wasn't.

00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:41.000
 So it's really strange.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:42.160
 - Well, he's a figurehead, wasn't he?

00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:44.440
 - That is a bit like Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings,

00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:45.280
 isn't it?

00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:46.120
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:46.960
 - It's exactly that.

00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:47.880
 - I'll let you stay.

00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:49.480
 - But when he asked for his phone in the first place,

00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:52.200
 he was told there is nothing in the ancestral regulations

00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:53.320
 to provide for this.

00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:55.360
 Because obviously his ancestors had been saying,

00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:56.320
 "Oh, I gotta have a phone."

00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:57.640
 - He wouldn't predict these things.

00:34:57.640 --> 00:34:59.000
 - It was a really weird, the old fashion,

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.400
 and his father said it would upset imperial dignity

00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:04.280
 if outside voices could ring into the palace.

00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:06.040
 So there was controversy about it at the time.

00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:06.880
 - There were, absolutely.

00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:09.200
 And this was, he only really knew about the phones

00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:11.000
 because he had a British tutor,

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.960
 who was a guy called Sir Reginald Fleming Johnston.

00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:15.840
 Not a sir at the time, I don't think,

00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:20.360
 but he became the English tutor to Puyi.

00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:22.040
 And he was the one who mentioned it.

00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:23.800
 He was, "Oh, you've got these things called phones."

00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:25.760
 And he said, "I love one."

00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:28.240
 - Johnson got pranked all the time by Puyi.

00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:30.880
 Puyi was constantly bringing up the man who'd got in the phone.

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:33.240
 - That's a, 'cause kind of he was his only friend,

00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:34.480
 I got the impression.

00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:35.600
 So that's kind of sad.

00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:37.560
 And I'm sure Johnston pretends to be really upset

00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:38.480
 or amused every time.

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:39.920
 - I think what we're gonna find

00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:42.040
 is that this is a pretty tragic story, isn't it?

00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:45.320
 This guy, very young, made an emperor,

00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:47.800
 turned out to be a utter, utter asshole,

00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:49.960
 but probably a victim of circumstance

00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:51.640
 because he was left on his own the whole time.

00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:53.840
 - That's the thing, the whole thing feeds on itself.

00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:55.840
 It's like no one comes out good in this story.

00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:57.480
 I just want to stick up for Puyi.

00:35:57.480 --> 00:35:58.320
 - Oh yeah.

00:35:58.320 --> 00:35:59.800
 - Because I've got this book out of the library.

00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:00.640
 - Yep.

00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:02.920
 - It's from Emperor to Citizen.

00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:03.760
 - Oh yes.

00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:04.600
 - And it's his memoir.

00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:05.440
 - Oh yeah.

00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:06.560
 - And I've been reading it.

00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:08.680
 And he, you know, it's actually a lot funnier

00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:10.080
 than we're all giving it credit for.

00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:11.040
 - Does he mention all the stuff

00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:13.680
 about constantly whipping eunuchs

00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:15.760
 just for the sake of having fun of watching that?

00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:16.600
 - He does.

00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:17.440
 - He beats them to death.

00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:18.280
 Did he do that?

00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:19.440
 - Does he mention it when his wife

00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:20.840
 had a child with another man

00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:22.720
 and then he had that baby stolen and killed?

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:23.560
 Is that in there?

00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:24.400
 Is that part of the funny stuff?

00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:25.240
 - Okay, I haven't read the whole thing.

00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:26.080
 - Yeah.

00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:26.920
 He's a bad dude.

00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:28.480
 - No, he does mention the eunuch stuff though

00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:30.480
 because that was his whole big repentance thing.

00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:32.400
 His memoirs at the end of his life

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:34.280
 was when he said, "I'm sorry for all this."

00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:37.920
 - There's an entire chapter called the eunuchs

00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:40.520
 because he lived surrounded by eunuchs.

00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:41.360
 - Yeah.

00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:42.200
 - There were a few hundred

00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:43.040
 and even that was a substantial cut down

00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:44.160
 from the glory days when there were--

00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:47.520
 - Substantial cut down to make those eunuchs.

00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:48.480
 - In the good old days,

00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:49.960
 there were thousands and thousands of you.

00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:52.120
 Look, just look, eunuchs, page 61,

00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:54.440
 just a great section on, you know,

00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:55.480
 the eunuchy life he lived.

00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:56.320
 - That's pretty funny.

00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:57.160
 - Until he was 10 years old,

00:36:57.160 --> 00:36:59.520
 he only played hide and seek with his own eunuchs.

00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:00.960
 He was very isolated growing up.

00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:01.880
 I mean, he had siblings,

00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:04.120
 but he didn't see his own mother for years and years and years

00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:05.680
 'cause he was taken away to live in the--

00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:08.080
 - He wasn't the child of the previous emperor.

00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:09.280
 The previous emperor was his uncle.

00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:10.120
 - That's right.

00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:10.960
 So there was the emperor Stowager,

00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:13.720
 who's a very famous character in ancient Chinese--

00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:15.960
 - Yeah, Sushi, who's this amazing person.

00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:18.720
 - And she, when the emperor had passed away,

00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:20.920
 there was no child in order to take over.

00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:22.400
 So this was the nephew.

00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:24.800
 - But there were moments of levity in his childhood.

00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:26.560
 I just think there were a few.

00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:28.800
 So just get this, if you ever went to the park,

00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:30.680
 this is the process of how it would happen.

00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:32.480
 He would have a eunuch walking ahead of him,

00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:33.960
 basically honking with his mouth to say,

00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:35.200
 "Everyone keep away."

00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:38.440
 He was like a sort of one-man beep, beep, beep system.

00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:41.200
 - Well, they hadn't invented the klaxon horn,

00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:42.360
 had they ever done yet? - No, yeah, no.

00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:43.520
 - So you needed the eunuch.

00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:45.960
 - A rare example of China not inventing something first,

00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:48.400
 just 'cause the eunuch system works so well.

00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:49.720
 Then there would be two chief eunuchs

00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:51.640
 going kind of crab-wise sideways,

00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:52.920
 just keeping an eye on everything.

00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:55.080
 Then there would be junior eunuchs with him.

00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:56.480
 There would be a eunuch with a canopy,

00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:59.000
 then more eunuchs holding a chair, a change of clothes,

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.520
 some umbrellas, some cakes,

00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:01.920
 some hot water.

00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:04.480
 Then there were the medical eunuchs who came behind them.

00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:06.680
 - We've all been to the beach with our kids.

00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:08.480
 We know how much you have to take,

00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:09.800
 how many eunuchs you need.

00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:13.280
 - And then at the end is the eunuch with the Lou,

00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:15.280
 or the eunuchs, several eunuchs

00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:17.040
 with commodes and chamber pots and things.

00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:18.800
 And when he was a kid, he would just run around.

00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:20.120
 And it's called absolute mayhem

00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:21.640
 because the whole procession was trying to keep up

00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:23.160
 with a five-year-old boy

00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:24.800
 who was just running around in a park.

00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:26.760
 - Can I do it an incredibly quick?

00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:27.600
 This is his life.

00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:30.640
 So on the throne at two, kicked off the throne at six,

00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:35.240
 but got to be pretend emperor until like early mid 1920s,

00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:37.720
 at which point he was booted out by a warlord,

00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:39.840
 hung up being a playboy who used to be the emperor,

00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:41.120
 shagging around a bit.

00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:44.360
 Until 1931, Japan invaded Manchuria,

00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:46.680
 thought we'll pluck this former emperor,

00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:49.600
 put him in charge apparently, but he's our puppet.

00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:50.680
 He had no power,

00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:53.680
 but he got to keep living this weird fake royal life.

00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:56.040
 So continued being pampered and petted,

00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:57.400
 having people wait on him.

00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:58.440
 No power.

00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:02.600
 Then Japanese surrender 1945, he's fucked

00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:03.840
 because the Soviets come,

00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:05.360
 they put him in prison for five years.

00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:07.760
 Then they hand him over to the Chinese who reeducate him.

00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:09.120
 - The communists at this point.

00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:10.960
 - Who are communists, reeducate him.

00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:12.680
 He comes out, bona fide communists

00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:13.960
 and ends his life for Gardner.

00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:15.000
 Mad life.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:15.840
 - It is a mad life.

00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:19.080
 And reeducation is like being in a jail cell, right?

00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:19.920
 Like it's your-

00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:20.760
 - It's like going out to school, Dan.

00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:21.600
 - You're being conditioned.

00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:24.600
 Yeah, it's like a British boarding school.

00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:26.320
 Maybe that's why I think all this sounds absolutely

00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:27.320
 part of the course.

00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:28.360
 (all laughing)

00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:30.120
 We were constantly firing air guns at the Unix

00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:30.960
 at my school.

00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:33.400
 (all laughing)

00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:36.080
 - And the final bit of life where he became a Gardner,

00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:39.560
 he's fascinating just reading how useless he was

00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:41.080
 in day-to-day activities,

00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:43.440
 where he would sort of forget to flush a toilet

00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:47.000
 or know any directions or all these basic things

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:47.840
 that you would-

00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:48.680
 - Shoelaces.

00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:49.520
 - Yeah, shoelaces.

00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:50.520
 - Just done his shoes for his whole life.

00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:52.760
 - I found it, I really question this,

00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:54.360
 but I mean, all the historians say it,

00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:56.440
 that when he was being reeducated by China,

00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:58.320
 it was partly to say be a communist

00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:00.080
 and apologize for uniting with the Japanese.

00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:01.120
 And it was partly to say,

00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:02.920
 "Here's how to look after yourself."

00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:04.440
 And they taught him to tie his shoelaces

00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:05.600
 and brush his teeth.

00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:08.000
 - He was breastfed until the age of eight.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:08.840
 - Yep.

00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:09.960
 - And at that point, the Dowager,

00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:11.000
 the powerful Dowager said,

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:14.640
 "I think it's probably time we've removed your wet nurse

00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:15.480
 from you."

00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:16.320
 Which made him very sad,

00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:18.280
 'cause he would just believe we're still enjoying it.

00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:20.000
 - But he was stranded out in the Pacific at the time,

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:20.840
 wasn't he?

00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:21.680
 (all laughing)

00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:22.880
 He had no other sustenance.

00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:25.920
 - If you were the Empress Dowager

00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:28.880
 in this weird fake palace situation,

00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:29.880
 was it real palace?

00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:31.800
 - First of all, what is an Empress Dowager?

00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:34.640
 - So she's the widow of the emperor,

00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:36.760
 who is now in a senior position,

00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:38.080
 kind of like a regent.

00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:39.040
 She's got a lot of authority,

00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:40.440
 but she's not technically--

00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:42.360
 - So she basically runs everything.

00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:43.200
 - Exactly.

00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:46.440
 - But she's putting in little puppets to do her work for her.

00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:48.200
 'Cause arguably this guy,

00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:49.800
 even though he was emperor three times,

00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:51.600
 he was never really in charge at any stage.

00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:52.680
 - Absolutely, absolutely.

00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:53.720
 He just wasn't in charge.

00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:55.000
 So yeah, the Dowager would have been the one

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:56.080
 really controlling things,

00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:58.480
 saying, "I think maybe we should stop breastfeeding you now,"

00:40:58.480 --> 00:40:59.840
 that kind of thing.

00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:02.360
 - Or more like, "I think maybe we should invade Mongolia now."

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:03.400
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:06.440
 (all laughing)

00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:08.440
 They had this thing in the palace,

00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:10.160
 and again, this is after the First Revolution.

00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:11.360
 So they're not really in charge anymore,

00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:13.480
 but they're still treated with a lot of respect.

00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:15.400
 There was an as you wish lodge,

00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:17.080
 which was one of the 48 offices

00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:18.480
 that the staff were working in.

00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:21.680
 And if the Empress Dowager decided to do some painting,

00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:26.080
 the staff at the lodge would make her the painting already.

00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:28.000
 They basically made her a paint by numbers,

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:29.520
 and she just had to fill in the colors

00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:30.360
 and put the title on it.

00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:31.200
 - That's great.

00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:32.040
 - What a great service.

00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:32.880
 - How cool is that?

00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:34.600
 - Wow, I want that.

00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:36.200
 He married five times,

00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:37.320
 which was easier to fit in

00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:39.320
 when you're allowed multiple marriages at once,

00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:40.720
 as you were.

00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:43.240
 But again, this seemed like an unfair trick.

00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:44.920
 This is in 1921.

00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:48.080
 So when he was being like pretend emperor with no power,

00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:51.320
 he was shown five photos of women.

00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:53.920
 It used to be that the emperor had women paraded

00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:55.200
 in front of him and got to choose,

00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:58.160
 but because he's been downgraded, he just got photos.

00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:00.600
 And he was asked, "Choose who you like best."

00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:01.960
 He picked one.

00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:03.520
 And then they chatted amongst themselves.

00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:04.360
 The other people at court went,

00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:05.920
 "No, she's not fit enough."

00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:06.760
 - No.

00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:08.240
 - And they made him marry the other one.

00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:10.560
 - So he did get a second wife from a different photo,

00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:11.560
 but on the day of marriage,

00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:14.000
 he then also married this first choice.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:14.840
 - Yes.

00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:15.680
 - He had two marriages on the same day.

00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:16.520
 - On the same day.

00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:18.760
 - That's a sitcom, ready to be written, isn't it?

00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:19.600
 (laughing)

00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:22.560
 - You know what, it sounds so unfunny their lives.

00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:24.440
 I want you to inject some gags in there, please.

00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:25.760
 - If anyone has any objection

00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:27.680
 and you're hoping the concubine hasn't turned up

00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:29.360
 to your wedding, or your wife hasn't turned up

00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:31.600
 for the concubine marriage, I think this is good.

00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:32.760
 - They were really young weren't they?

00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:34.960
 These young women who were brought in.

00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:37.400
 The last one who was called Li Yuqin.

00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:40.480
 She was, I think she was 14 or something

00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:43.400
 when she became the last imperial consort

00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:48.120
 and the emperor was comparatively old at this stage.

00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:50.000
 But she said, and in his view she said

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.920
 she didn't even know how children were made at that stage.

00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:56.080
 She believed what she was told by her mother

00:42:56.080 --> 00:42:59.120
 that we were picked up from the rubbish bins.

00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:01.800
 I just think that's an unusual way of telling kids

00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:03.240
 that that's where babies come from.

00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:06.040
 - It's good parenting, and it's a story I've maintained.

00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:08.040
 - Well, I just think, 'cause we have like the stock

00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:09.680
 comes and drops the baby at the front door.

00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:10.520
 - That's very nice.

00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:12.600
 Cabbage patch is nice, fertility and growth.

00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:13.600
 - But rubbish bins?

00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:14.720
 - Yeah, to be fair,

00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:16.560
 this is an almost entirely unique based society.

00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:17.800
 It's very hard to actually get a handle

00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:21.040
 on where children come from in this world.

00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:22.040
 But he doesn't seem to have been

00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:24.280
 especially actually interested in women now.

00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:26.960
 - Well, he used to have blazing rounds with his wife,

00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:28.960
 both wives and all five wives about,

00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:30.960
 they would sometimes refer to him as a eunuch

00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:32.800
 because of his lack of prowess.

00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:35.040
 In the bedroom on the honeymoon night,

00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:36.520
 he had both of his first wives,

00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:38.920
 so the wife and the consort in the same bed,

00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:39.760
 waiting for him.

00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:41.440
 And when he went in, the story goes,

00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:43.480
 he ran out of the room and they don't know

00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:45.960
 if there was much, with any consummation happening.

00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:48.600
 - I'm hearing sitcom, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:50.800
 - They're running in and running out,

00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:53.440
 certainly out of the element of farce.

00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:55.720
 His last wife seemed like quite a sweet story.

00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:59.000
 So this was in the 1960s.

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:00.960
 He started off working as a street sweeper.

00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:03.880
 So the Chinese reeducated him, then pardoned him.

00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:06.440
 He became a street sweeper and there's a very sad story

00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:09.560
 of him getting lost and he has to approach his former subjects

00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:11.600
 and say, "Hello, I used to be the emperor.

00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:12.760
 I don't know how to get home.

00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:13.600
 I'm staying with family."

00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:15.840
 - He should just follow the clean streets.

00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:17.200
 If he goes back in the direction

00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:18.280
 that all the clean streets are,

00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:19.600
 he knows that's where he came from.

00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:21.440
 - The thing is James, he was so bad at all these tasks.

00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:23.600
 He hadn't actually effectively cleaned the streets.

00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:26.800
 - I think it's like the reverse of following the breadcrumbs.

00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:28.480
 - Yeah. - That's beautiful.

00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:30.800
 - Follow the lack of breadcrumbs.

00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:33.880
 But then he married this woman who was a nurse

00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:35.520
 and they stayed together forever.

00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:37.440
 And I think she didn't die until 1997.

00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:40.160
 And she said he was just desperate for someone to love him.

00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:41.520
 Which after that life?

00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:42.600
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:43.960
 - Yeah, it's wild.

00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:45.720
 - So you find the story very depressing Dan,

00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:46.760
 which is fair. - Yeah.

00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:49.840
 - But actually, when he did write his memoirs at the end,

00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:51.080
 which were heavily influenced

00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:53.120
 by the Chinese Communist Party and its free education,

00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:54.600
 he did say he was-

00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:55.680
 - They come in for some very good press

00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:57.000
 at the end of this one, I've gotta say.

00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:57.840
 - Exactly.

00:44:57.840 --> 00:45:01.120
 He was at least contented with his current status

00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:05.680
 as a repentant and devoted communist who loved the party.

00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:08.160
 - I didn't notice, Addy, that it is a little red book.

00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:09.160
 (all laughing)

00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:10.480
 - Yes it is.

00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:13.060
 (upbeat music)

00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:16.100
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show

00:45:16.100 --> 00:45:17.820
 and that is Andy.

00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:19.660
 - My fact is that the film "Spider-Man"

00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:22.460
 once cast two crowds of identical twin extras,

00:45:22.460 --> 00:45:24.740
 so they could film the same scene at the same time

00:45:24.740 --> 00:45:26.100
 in different places.

00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:27.140
 - Amazing. - That's amazing.

00:45:27.140 --> 00:45:27.980
 - Why?

00:45:27.980 --> 00:45:29.540
 You know, the first thing that comes into my head

00:45:29.540 --> 00:45:32.380
 is that meme of all the Spider-Man points at each other.

00:45:32.380 --> 00:45:33.220
 - Yeah.

00:45:33.220 --> 00:45:34.060
 (all laughing)

00:45:34.060 --> 00:45:37.380
 - This is a really weird thing that just happened to happen

00:45:37.380 --> 00:45:39.260
 once in the annals of filming history.

00:45:39.260 --> 00:45:41.220
 And I got this because I was looking in the mirror

00:45:41.220 --> 00:45:42.980
 in history and I got this because I was looking

00:45:42.980 --> 00:45:45.620
 into casting and how people are cast

00:45:45.620 --> 00:45:47.420
 and how extras get cast in films.

00:45:47.420 --> 00:45:49.620
 And there was a woman called Jennifer Bender

00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:52.980
 who was the vice president of an extras film

00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:54.540
 about 10 years ago and she was being in due

00:45:54.540 --> 00:45:55.820
 to develop a business.

00:45:55.820 --> 00:45:59.100
 And she said that this film, they had two units shooting.

00:45:59.100 --> 00:46:00.700
 You know, you have-- - Sorry, two eunuchs.

00:46:00.700 --> 00:46:03.940
 (all laughing)

00:46:03.940 --> 00:46:05.420
 - There's a main unit and a second unit.

00:46:05.420 --> 00:46:09.020
 And they needed, yeah, due to just the nature of film.

00:46:09.020 --> 00:46:10.820
 It's so weird when you ask anyone about the world of film,

00:46:10.820 --> 00:46:13.260
 why their stuff is so weird.

00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:14.700
 They just say, "Well, that's just filming, isn't it?"

00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:17.940
 And it's basically, they had to shoot this scene

00:46:17.940 --> 00:46:19.660
 in two places at the same time

00:46:19.660 --> 00:46:21.700
 because of the schedule they were on to get this filmed.

00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:23.500
 So they said, "Well, let's just cast twins."

00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:26.140
 So they got 25 sets of twins, so one lot to one set,

00:46:26.140 --> 00:46:28.060
 so one lot to the other set, dressed them the same.

00:46:28.060 --> 00:46:28.900
 - That's really good.

00:46:28.900 --> 00:46:29.740
 - That's really cool.

00:46:29.740 --> 00:46:31.820
 - And one of the thing is that the twins,

00:46:31.820 --> 00:46:34.620
 they can telepathically communicate to each other, right?

00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:37.460
 So they can tell them what's happening in the other place.

00:46:37.460 --> 00:46:39.140
 - So when he said this fact, so we were like,

00:46:39.140 --> 00:46:42.140
 "Wow, why?" and you said, "You'll have to wait and see."

00:46:42.140 --> 00:46:43.860
 But what the answer is just,

00:46:43.860 --> 00:46:45.940
 'cause they're really shit at making film schedules.

00:46:45.940 --> 00:46:47.260
 - Schedules, it's just, you know.

00:46:47.260 --> 00:46:49.660
 - I'm sure it's easier to repack the schedule.

00:46:49.660 --> 00:46:53.380
 - I've got to say, Andy's sort of amazing mystery

00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:56.340
 is always going to end up, it was a matter of scheduling.

00:46:56.340 --> 00:46:58.220
 (laughing)

00:46:58.220 --> 00:47:00.020
 - Anna, you don't understand the nature of film.

00:47:00.020 --> 00:47:02.860
 Like, there are producers on your ass all the time saying,

00:47:02.860 --> 00:47:03.700
 "We've got to get this ready

00:47:03.700 --> 00:47:06.220
 "for the Hong Kong market in two weeks," you know?

00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:07.980
 - Can't have that many identical twins in the world.

00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:08.940
 - We've got to do the re-shoots.

00:47:08.940 --> 00:47:10.540
 Get Chalamet now.

00:47:10.540 --> 00:47:13.820
 I want five Chalamets on my desk tomorrow morning.

00:47:13.820 --> 00:47:16.340
 You know, it's hard, that's film.

00:47:16.340 --> 00:47:17.980
 - Incredible, so good.

00:47:17.980 --> 00:47:18.820
 - That's really cool.

00:47:18.820 --> 00:47:20.340
 - It's hard to be an extra.

00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:21.700
 - Oh, it sounds it.

00:47:21.700 --> 00:47:23.020
 I've done extra work a couple of times.

00:47:23.020 --> 00:47:23.860
 - Have you?

00:47:23.860 --> 00:47:24.700
 - Yeah.

00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:25.540
 - Well, in this podcast.

00:47:25.540 --> 00:47:26.380
 - Wow.

00:47:26.380 --> 00:47:27.340
 (laughing)

00:47:27.340 --> 00:47:28.460
 - What did you do?

00:47:28.460 --> 00:47:29.300
 - I can't remember.

00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:31.260
 It was a film with James McAvoy, which was quite exciting.

00:47:31.260 --> 00:47:33.220
 'Cause you often don't know before you turn up

00:47:33.220 --> 00:47:34.140
 what it's going to be.

00:47:34.140 --> 00:47:34.980
 - Yeah, right.

00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:36.860
 - Are they looking specifically for people

00:47:36.860 --> 00:47:40.100
 with quite normal-looking faces?

00:47:40.100 --> 00:47:42.500
 - Planned, ideally, they want balloons on sticks.

00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:43.820
 - Well, that is a thing, isn't it?

00:47:43.820 --> 00:47:44.660
 - Yeah.

00:47:44.660 --> 00:47:45.500
 - Like, you can buy it.

00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:46.860
 - Is it like inflatable crowds for movies?

00:47:46.860 --> 00:47:47.700
 - No.

00:47:47.700 --> 00:47:48.540
 - Yeah.

00:47:48.540 --> 00:47:50.460
 - I think Seabiscuit famously, like, that's where it started.

00:47:50.460 --> 00:47:51.420
 - I think that was the first one.

00:47:51.420 --> 00:47:52.980
 Yeah, this guy called Joe Biggins,

00:47:52.980 --> 00:47:54.900
 who suddenly realized rather than organize loads

00:47:54.900 --> 00:47:56.580
 of extras and have to pay them,

00:47:56.580 --> 00:47:58.580
 you can just make inflatable people.

00:47:58.580 --> 00:47:59.420
 - Really?

00:47:59.420 --> 00:48:00.260
 - And you can do,

00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:02.180
 I think he got 10,000 in the back of a lorry,

00:48:02.180 --> 00:48:03.540
 which you can't do with extras.

00:48:03.540 --> 00:48:05.860
 (laughing)

00:48:05.860 --> 00:48:08.140
 - That's against union rules, yeah, yeah.

00:48:08.140 --> 00:48:09.940
 - Oh, they're very annoying about that.

00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:12.060
 - I really hope, like, in the background of, like,

00:48:12.060 --> 00:48:14.140
 a movie, like, Gladiator, if you look carefully,

00:48:14.140 --> 00:48:17.180
 there's just a slowly floppy, deflating.

00:48:17.180 --> 00:48:18.340
 - They're floating away, unfortunately.

00:48:18.340 --> 00:48:19.180
 - He is helium.

00:48:19.180 --> 00:48:21.020
 (laughing)

00:48:21.020 --> 00:48:23.300
 - Weirdly, appendages cost extra,

00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:26.260
 so he charges $50 for the Bod the torso.

00:48:26.260 --> 00:48:28.340
 - So is this from a big distance that you're shooting?

00:48:28.340 --> 00:48:29.940
 Of course, 'cause it couldn't be--

00:48:29.940 --> 00:48:30.780
 - Yeah, it is.

00:48:30.780 --> 00:48:32.540
 It's like crowd scenes, really.

00:48:32.540 --> 00:48:35.220
 So Seabiscuit, they're running around a horse track,

00:48:35.220 --> 00:48:36.940
 and they-- - So that's kind of perfect.

00:48:36.940 --> 00:48:38.340
 - And what you do is you get loads of them,

00:48:38.340 --> 00:48:40.660
 and then you get some humans in between them,

00:48:40.660 --> 00:48:43.500
 and your eyes are naturally drawn to the humans,

00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:45.060
 so the rest of it is just background.

00:48:45.060 --> 00:48:45.900
 - That's brilliant.

00:48:45.900 --> 00:48:47.140
 - It's amazing what we don't notice.

00:48:47.140 --> 00:48:48.980
 - I read about a movie that was made

00:48:48.980 --> 00:48:51.460
 by actually an old buddy of mine called Anthony Ng,

00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:54.580
 where he tracked down the lady who has the Guinness World

00:48:54.580 --> 00:48:58.380
 record for the most extras appearances in movies.

00:48:58.380 --> 00:49:02.140
 So her record was 1,951.

00:49:02.140 --> 00:49:02.980
 And they're everything from,

00:49:02.980 --> 00:49:06.300
 she said she was on 80% of the carry-on films.

00:49:06.300 --> 00:49:09.580
 She was in the very first episode of EastEnders.

00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:12.100
 She remembers being on a set one day with a guy,

00:49:12.100 --> 00:49:14.180
 having a great chat at the lunch hall,

00:49:14.180 --> 00:49:16.420
 and then he's the lead in a movie years later.

00:49:16.420 --> 00:49:17.980
 It's David Bowie, who says,

00:49:17.980 --> 00:49:19.460
 "Hey, we had a great chat,"

00:49:19.460 --> 00:49:20.980
 and they reconnected through that.

00:49:20.980 --> 00:49:22.620
 So she sees people go up.

00:49:22.620 --> 00:49:24.100
 So her name's Jill Goldston,

00:49:24.100 --> 00:49:29.060
 and we know that she has appeared in the 1,951 movies.

00:49:29.060 --> 00:49:31.160
 Certainly, she had at that point for the record,

00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:33.660
 because her husband is an accountant,

00:49:33.660 --> 00:49:35.020
 and he marked down every time.

00:49:35.020 --> 00:49:36.300
 He just got obsessed with making sure

00:49:36.300 --> 00:49:37.980
 that he had lists of what was going on.

00:49:37.980 --> 00:49:39.980
 Yeah, so there's a whole documentary about her,

00:49:39.980 --> 00:49:42.220
 and all her little things that she learned along the way.

00:49:42.220 --> 00:49:44.220
 Don't look at Tom Cruise when he's on set, you know?

00:49:44.220 --> 00:49:45.900
 - Are we saying because her husband's an accountant,

00:49:45.900 --> 00:49:47.380
 therefore sort of a really boring guy

00:49:47.380 --> 00:49:49.180
 who loves tallying up on hate information?

00:49:49.180 --> 00:49:50.020
 - He just happened to do it.

00:49:50.020 --> 00:49:52.340
 Yeah, he liked making Excel spreadsheets.

00:49:52.340 --> 00:49:53.540
 - Fair. - For respect.

00:49:53.540 --> 00:49:54.380
 - Yeah.

00:49:54.380 --> 00:49:56.700
 - Don't point at me when he's talking about a boring guy.

00:49:56.700 --> 00:49:57.620
 It's offensive.

00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:01.260
 - When we say someone comes from central casting.

00:50:01.260 --> 00:50:02.100
 - Oh, yeah.

00:50:02.100 --> 00:50:03.040
 - That's a phrase, right?

00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:05.540
 It's a sort of, oh, he's straight out of central casting.

00:50:05.540 --> 00:50:06.980
 I mean, someone's a bit of like a stock carrier,

00:50:06.980 --> 00:50:08.740
 or like if someone turns up and they're an accountant

00:50:08.740 --> 00:50:09.740
 and they're wearing a gray suit

00:50:09.740 --> 00:50:11.100
 and they're carrying a gray briefcase

00:50:11.100 --> 00:50:13.300
 and they've got to roll up a breller.

00:50:13.300 --> 00:50:14.980
 Central casting is an actual company,

00:50:14.980 --> 00:50:17.380
 which I didn't know until I was researching this,

00:50:17.380 --> 00:50:19.860
 and it's 100 years old this year,

00:50:19.860 --> 00:50:24.780
 'cause it started in 100 years ago, 1925.

00:50:24.780 --> 00:50:26.620
 - You could do the math as well.

00:50:26.620 --> 00:50:29.600
 - Wow, are you an accountant?

00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:32.160
 - Yeah, and just, that was the firm that Jennifer Bender

00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:33.480
 was the vice president of.

00:50:33.480 --> 00:50:35.880
 They place hundreds of, even now, these days,

00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:37.480
 they place hundreds of thousands of people a year.

00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:39.320
 - American based or here?

00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:41.280
 - Certainly in America, and I think all over,

00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:42.560
 and lots of people started out there.

00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:45.560
 David Niven started out there, he's a famous actor.

00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:48.760
 He was registered as Anglo-Saxon type number 2008,

00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:51.640
 and in the 1920s, extras were categorized into groups

00:50:51.640 --> 00:50:53.920
 because you just needed like a job lot of people

00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:55.240
 who looked a particular way,

00:50:55.240 --> 00:50:57.220
 and the groups included blonde, beautiful,

00:50:57.220 --> 00:51:00.600
 Latin, nurses, swimmers, and toothless.

00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:03.180
 (all laughing)

00:51:03.180 --> 00:51:06.220
 - Sometimes you could take a few boxes,

00:51:06.220 --> 00:51:07.060
 didn't you?

00:51:07.060 --> 00:51:07.900
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:51:07.900 --> 00:51:10.740
 - Beautiful, but toothless, you know, I'm not too gigs.

00:51:10.740 --> 00:51:13.020
 - The Log of the Rings films have got a lot of extras in,

00:51:13.020 --> 00:51:14.140
 haven't they, famously?

00:51:14.140 --> 00:51:17.020
 In fact, they pretty much cast everyone in New Zealand,

00:51:17.020 --> 00:51:18.580
 in those movies, I think.

00:51:18.580 --> 00:51:19.820
 In Return of the King,

00:51:19.820 --> 00:51:23.060
 they brought in some members of the New Zealand army,

00:51:23.060 --> 00:51:25.500
 and apparently they were way too enthusiastic

00:51:25.500 --> 00:51:27.500
 and kept breaking all the wooden swords and stuff.

00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:28.780
 (all laughing)

00:51:28.780 --> 00:51:31.660
 But in the two towers, they had a group of,

00:51:31.660 --> 00:51:33.620
 apologies to people who like Log of the Rings,

00:51:33.620 --> 00:51:34.820
 'cause I've never read any of them,

00:51:34.820 --> 00:51:37.100
 but there's a group called the Uruk High,

00:51:37.100 --> 00:51:38.520
 which is the orcs.

00:51:38.520 --> 00:51:39.360
 - Floorless.

00:51:39.360 --> 00:51:42.060
 - And they needed to get people to play them,

00:51:42.060 --> 00:51:44.320
 so they put a casting call out for everyone

00:51:44.320 --> 00:51:47.180
 over six foot tall in New Zealand

00:51:47.180 --> 00:51:49.100
 to come and play the Uruk High,

00:51:49.100 --> 00:51:50.680
 and they couldn't find enough people,

00:51:50.680 --> 00:51:53.460
 so they said, okay, everyone who's over five foot

00:51:53.460 --> 00:51:55.420
 can come in, and they brought in all these

00:51:55.420 --> 00:51:56.780
 like slightly shorter men,

00:51:56.780 --> 00:51:59.680
 and they were no one on set as the Uruk Low.

00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:00.520
 - Brilliant.

00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:03.740
 (all laughing)

00:52:03.740 --> 00:52:05.700
 - Having a fun day out as an extra on a movie.

00:52:05.700 --> 00:52:06.780
 (all laughing)

00:52:06.780 --> 00:52:08.740
 Can we get the Uruk Low in?

00:52:08.740 --> 00:52:09.580
 - We would.

00:52:09.580 --> 00:52:12.820
 - Do you know how many extras were used on those movies?

00:52:12.820 --> 00:52:14.180
 It'd be in like the tens of thousands, right?

00:52:14.180 --> 00:52:15.380
 - Tens of thousands for sure.

00:52:15.380 --> 00:52:19.020
 - Yeah, so the one that gets cited as the movie

00:52:19.020 --> 00:52:21.760
 that possibly will never get broken for most extras

00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:26.300
 is Gandhi, which had 300,000 extras,

00:52:26.300 --> 00:52:27.480
 which is pretty extraordinary,

00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:30.320
 and that was for Gandhi's funeral scene.

00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:32.000
 - They weren't all paid, though.

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:32.840
 - No.

00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:34.440
 - Most extras, like 200,000 of them

00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:36.300
 were just people who were milling around.

00:52:36.300 --> 00:52:37.440
 (all laughing)

00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:38.800
 - Yeah, that's true.

00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:40.240
 And that's often sometimes the case,

00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:42.320
 it's just actual people in the background.

00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:45.080
 There is a big list of movies of the most extras ever used,

00:52:45.080 --> 00:52:46.480
 Lord of the Rings is in there as well,

00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:49.660
 and another one is The Last Emperor movie,

00:52:49.660 --> 00:52:50.500
 which was filmed--

00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:51.660
 - Oh, about Puyi.

00:52:51.660 --> 00:52:54.020
 - Based on Puyi, it was filmed in the Forbidden City.

00:52:54.020 --> 00:52:57.540
 It was an extraordinary achievement of British filmmaking

00:52:57.540 --> 00:52:58.780
 because they managed to get access

00:52:58.780 --> 00:53:01.060
 to the Forbidden City itself to film inside.

00:53:01.060 --> 00:53:02.980
 So even when the queen was over there,

00:53:02.980 --> 00:53:05.860
 she couldn't visit it because they had priority access

00:53:05.860 --> 00:53:07.380
 over filming in there.

00:53:07.380 --> 00:53:09.140
 It was a big deal, it was a big collaboration.

00:53:09.140 --> 00:53:10.540
 - Well, she could have, if she applied to be an extra.

00:53:10.540 --> 00:53:11.380
 - Yeah.

00:53:11.380 --> 00:53:12.860
 (all laughing)

00:53:12.860 --> 00:53:14.700
 - Is it a comedy?

00:53:14.700 --> 00:53:16.020
 - Yes, it's hilarious.

00:53:16.020 --> 00:53:17.800
 - It's a raucous unit-based comedy.

00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:20.680
 Have you guys heard of Waller groups?

00:53:20.680 --> 00:53:21.520
 - Waller.

00:53:21.520 --> 00:53:23.600
 - Waller, W-A-W-L-L-A.

00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:24.440
 - Waller.

00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:25.280
 - Yeah.

00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:26.120
 - No.

00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:29.440
 - Rick Waller was a singer from the early days of pop idol.

00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:32.080
 - Fats Waller was a blues, blues, you know?

00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:34.320
 I mean, we're talking extras in movies here.

00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:37.120
 Phoebe Waller Bridge, there's a bit of lots of movies.

00:53:37.120 --> 00:53:39.240
 - Oh, the prequel to Wall-E.

00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:40.080
 - Wall-A.

00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:40.920
 - Wall-A.

00:53:40.920 --> 00:53:41.760
 - Yeah, yes.

00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:43.480
 - I'm in the film area at least.

00:53:43.480 --> 00:53:44.960
 - You are, that's very good.

00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:47.060
 - No, this is to do with the fact that

00:53:47.060 --> 00:53:49.300
 if you were filming extras in the background,

00:53:49.300 --> 00:53:52.700
 you're miking up your main characters who you're recording.

00:53:52.700 --> 00:53:54.420
 You haven't necessarily miked up the extras,

00:53:54.420 --> 00:53:56.340
 but you need that background noise.

00:53:56.340 --> 00:53:58.280
 So they often hire people to come in

00:53:58.280 --> 00:54:00.340
 and make the sounds of the extras.

00:54:00.340 --> 00:54:04.260
 So they're sort of actors who are acting as the extras.

00:54:04.260 --> 00:54:05.100
 - Oh my God.

00:54:05.100 --> 00:54:06.500
 - And so they stand in and there'll be a group of them

00:54:06.500 --> 00:54:07.980
 who will stand in a studio

00:54:07.980 --> 00:54:10.260
 and they just have to make murmur sounds.

00:54:10.260 --> 00:54:12.460
 They're called Wallers because Wall-A, Wall-A, Wall-A, Wall-A.

00:54:12.460 --> 00:54:13.580
 - Like group-up, group-up, group-up.

00:54:13.580 --> 00:54:14.620
 - Exactly, yeah.

00:54:14.620 --> 00:54:17.140
 And so they're called Waller, but it's obviously changed.

00:54:17.140 --> 00:54:19.400
 But so that often happens where you just have a group of people

00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:21.800
 having to make the sounds of the people in the background.

00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:23.280
 - Who mentioned short extras?

00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:25.800
 Oh, the Uruk Hai, being the Merrick Lowe.

00:54:25.800 --> 00:54:28.280
 So there's another film which had short extras

00:54:28.280 --> 00:54:29.760
 for a very specific reason.

00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:30.840
 So can you guess?

00:54:30.840 --> 00:54:32.120
 It's one of the most famous films of all time.

00:54:32.120 --> 00:54:32.960
 - Chocolate Factory.

00:54:32.960 --> 00:54:34.360
 - Yeah, that was my first thought.

00:54:34.360 --> 00:54:35.760
 - Not Chocolate Factory, not Wizard of Oz.

00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:37.440
 Those probably both did do exactly that,

00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:38.440
 but please let's just move on.

00:54:38.440 --> 00:54:39.280
 - Yep.

00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:42.600
 - Okay, it's something with lots of children in it.

00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:43.440
 - It's not.

00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:45.160
 It's something where you need to make something else

00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:46.900
 look a different size.

00:54:46.900 --> 00:54:48.300
 - Oh, okay, a film about a giant.

00:54:48.300 --> 00:54:49.660
 - Dullover's Travels.

00:54:49.660 --> 00:54:50.500
 - Very good.

00:54:50.500 --> 00:54:51.600
 - Very nice.

00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:53.520
 - No one's so short they can be a little appugian.

00:54:53.520 --> 00:54:55.400
 (all laughing)

00:54:55.400 --> 00:54:58.200
 - We've been in a bunch of three entire people.

00:54:58.200 --> 00:54:59.380
 - Honey, I shrunk the kids.

00:54:59.380 --> 00:55:02.980
 - I think we've still got the same problem here.

00:55:02.980 --> 00:55:07.100
 - You've built a prop, but you need the prop to,

00:55:07.100 --> 00:55:08.820
 but the prop is only like three quarters

00:55:08.820 --> 00:55:10.620
 of the actual size of the actual thing it's representing.

00:55:10.620 --> 00:55:12.240
 So you need to make it look bigger.

00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:14.640
 - That, what's the one where the monkey's coming?

00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:17.440
 It's Earth all along and they planted the apes.

00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:19.980
 So there's the Statue of Liberty,

00:55:19.980 --> 00:55:21.360
 but they couldn't get a full size one.

00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:22.620
 So they had to get small apes.

00:55:22.620 --> 00:55:23.460
 - That's right.

00:55:23.460 --> 00:55:25.440
 This is not, I mean, it's not right, but it's brilliant.

00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:26.760
 - Oh, damn it.

00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:28.260
 - But it's right in that it's good.

00:55:28.260 --> 00:55:29.960
 Yeah, it's exactly that kind of thing.

00:55:29.960 --> 00:55:32.480
 - But it's something else like Stonehenge or the Eiffel.

00:55:32.480 --> 00:55:33.320
 - Titanic.

00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:34.840
 Leonardo DiCaprio is actually four foot two.

00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:35.680
 - Titanic.

00:55:35.680 --> 00:55:36.520
 - Titanic.

00:55:36.520 --> 00:55:37.360
 - That was a Titanic.

00:55:37.360 --> 00:55:39.800
 - James Cameron only used people under five foot eight

00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:41.560
 on the actual ship.

00:55:41.560 --> 00:55:42.400
 - Okay.

00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:44.000
 - To make it look, to make the ship look bigger.

00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:44.840
 - Wow.

00:55:44.840 --> 00:55:45.840
 - 'Cause it's a pretty big ship already.

00:55:45.840 --> 00:55:48.600
 - It is pretty big, but the ship was a bit smaller

00:55:48.600 --> 00:55:49.600
 than the real life Titanic.

00:55:49.600 --> 00:55:50.720
 It was 15% smaller.

00:55:50.720 --> 00:55:53.240
 So if you cast a load of like six foot nine people,

00:55:53.240 --> 00:55:54.880
 it was like a bit. - It's gonna look tiny.

00:55:54.880 --> 00:55:55.720
 You're right.

00:55:55.720 --> 00:55:58.000
 (all laughing)

00:55:58.000 --> 00:55:59.920
 - Why have they started the movie in the lifeboat?

00:55:59.920 --> 00:56:00.760
 What's going on?

00:56:00.760 --> 00:56:03.020
 (all laughing)

00:56:03.020 --> 00:56:05.600
 (upbeat music)

00:56:05.600 --> 00:56:09.000
 - Okay, that's it.

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:09.960
 That is all of our facts.

00:56:09.960 --> 00:56:11.460

 We love hearing from you.

 Have you ever been an extra?

00:56:53.140 --> 00:56:55.460
 Are you Ridley Scott, you know, like right in?

00:56:55.460 --> 00:56:56.300
 - Yes.

00:56:56.300 --> 00:56:57.140
 - You're a eunuch.

00:56:57.140 --> 00:56:58.020
 (all laughing)

00:56:58.020 --> 00:56:59.060
 - But I actually do write it

00:56:59.060 --> 00:57:02.220
 because we use that material for our bonus episodes.

00:57:02.220 --> 00:57:03.540
 - We do, you can get a mention.

00:57:03.540 --> 00:57:05.100
 You can be an extra on our show.

00:57:05.100 --> 00:57:06.900

00:57:06.900 --> 00:57:08.340
 which is part of Club Fish,

00:57:08.340 --> 00:57:12.680
 which is our very secretive community of bonus episodes

00:57:12.680 --> 00:57:13.520
 and stuff.

00:57:13.520 --> 00:57:14.360
 It's great.

00:57:14.360 --> 00:57:15.180

 We will see you then.

00:57:24.840 --> 00:57:26.180
 Goodbye.

00:57:26.180 --> 00:57:28.760
 (upbeat music)
