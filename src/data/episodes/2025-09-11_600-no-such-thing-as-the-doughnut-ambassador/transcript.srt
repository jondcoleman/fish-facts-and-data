1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:14,480
 - Hello, and welcome to another episode

3
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,040
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,460
 coming to you from the QI offices in Hoburn.

5
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:20,600
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,200
 I'm sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,

7
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,400
 James Harkin, and Anna Tyshinski.

8
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,540
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

9
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:30,200
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

10
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,960
 And in no particular order, here we go.

11
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,120
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Anna.

12
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,800
 - My fact this week is that in the 1940s,

13
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,240
 a mystery man traveled America measuring the holes

14
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,560
 in donuts and passing a ruling on what size they should be.

15
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,400
 - Pervert.

16
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,040
 (laughing)

17
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,800
 It's got pervert written all over it.

18
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,640
 (laughing)

19
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,240
 - That didn't even cross my mind.

20
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,440
 Now I'm looking down all my research on this guy

21
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,920
 and questioning his motives.

22
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,960
 - Yeah, I didn't as well.

23
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,480
 Why is he a pervert?

24
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,320
 What's going on?

25
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,120
 - Just it's weird having an obsession with measuring holes

26
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,720
 and putting your mucky little fingers in there,

27
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,560
 and like, what are you doing?

28
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,640
 - 'Cause he got mucky fingers.

29
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,480
 (laughing)

30
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,800
 - 'Cause they got sugar on them, 'cause they're all the donuts.

31
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,480
 - We don't know he wasn't a good hand washer.

32
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,120
 In fact, we know almost nothing about him.

33
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,440
 - What was he measuring the holes with?

34
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,440
 That's what I wanna know.

35
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,160
 - Come on, people.

36
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,440
 - Okay, now I get it.

37
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,720
 (laughing)

38
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:23,880
 - Edward Velasca was a perfectly innocent donut aficionado.

39
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,960
 And this, I started looking into this

40
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,360
 'cause there's a picture that occasionally pops up online

41
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:31,920
 of a man who's holding up a big sign

42
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,960
 with three pictures on it.

43
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,960
 And the sign says size of donut hole down through the years.

44
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,920
 And then there's three pictures of donuts

45
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,760
 in 1927, '37, and '48.

46
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,680
 And there are just all these reports in the late 1940s

47
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,760
 of this guy, Edward Velasca, going around America

48
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,280
 and announcing that donut holes will be shrinking.

49
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,960
 And that, he says, is because people

50
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,880
 are getting dunked dimples from handling the existing size,

51
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,800
 which I think meant if the hole's too big,

52
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,880
 you leave a dent in your donut when you dip it.

53
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,440
 - Pervert, pervert, pervert, pervert.

54
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,280
 I'm sorry.

55
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,720
 This is just a screen spread.

56
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,640
 Also, this was the 1940s.

57
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,720
 The world had big things on its plate.

58
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,560
 - No longer.

59
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,800
 - Nah, they've forgotten all that.

60
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,760
 It was '47.

61
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,840
 - First half of the '40s was a very stressful time.

62
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,680
 - It was.

63
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,560
 - But second half was donut city.

64
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,080
 - No, you're right, people.

65
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,520
 - Maybe he was in the war, and when peace comes,

66
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,640
 I'm gonna get back to doing what I love.

67
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,760
 - I'm thinking PTSD.

68
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,720
 - This, actually, that was the most plausible explanation.

69
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,920
 - It's all it holds, isn't it?

70
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,360
 - It's a, kkkk.

71
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,440
 - Oh, yes, of course.

72
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,600
 - It's the D in PTSD for donut.

73
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,520
 I didn't know that, I did not know that.

74
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,880
 - So there's a great photo, isn't there,

75
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,320
 of him holding up a board,

76
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,960
 and he's pointing to three different donuts over the years.

77
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,800
 - That's the one.

78
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,000
 - That's the one in that, exactly.

79
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,440
 And that photo, we have that thanks

80
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:52,080
 to a Smithsonian collection of donut ephemera,

81
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,800
 which is collected by Sally L. Steinberg.

82
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,880
 She is the donut princess of America,

83
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,720
 and she wrote a book.

84
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,560
 - Self-appointed.

85
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,960
 - Self-appointed.

86
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,720
 She wrote a book called The Donut Book,

87
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,600
 The Origins, History, Literature, Law, Taste,

88
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,320
 Etiquette, Traditions, Techniques, Varieties,

89
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,200
 Mathematics, Mythology, Commerce, Philosophy,

90
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,360
 Cuisine, and Glory of the Donut,

91
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,800
 which I found a copy of, and it is insane.

92
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,760
 It's an insane book, but it's so brilliantly researched.

93
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,200
 And she's the person who has this photo

94
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,960
 that we now know of as a result of her collection.

95
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,160
 - Yeah, if you thought the Smithsonian

96
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,520
 had very serious things in its collection, it doesn't.

97
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,400
 It has donut ephemera from this girl,

98
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,680
 who was the granddaughter of that.

99
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,120
 I think the reason she calls herself a princess,

100
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,920
 'cause she was the granddaughter of Adolf Levitt,

101
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,040
 a refugee from Russia in the 1920s,

102
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,880
 who made America's first donut machine.

103
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,720
 So it got called The Donut King, and she's his offspring.

104
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,880
 - 'Cause obviously Russia did away with the monarchy,

105
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,760
 didn't they, in the start of the 20th century,

106
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,200
 but they didn't figure for the donut monarchy, did they?

107
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,280
 - Yeah, indeed.

108
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:49,080
 They were chasing him down for decades, actually.

109
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,240
 A lot of Stalin's resources went in, tracking him down.

110
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,760
 - He was supposedly inspired,

111
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,280
 so it goes back to the war, actually,

112
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,360
 where people were cooking biscuits and dough,

113
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,760
 and they were putting them on bayonets

114
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,800
 and giving them out to soldiers,

115
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,400
 so you would have the whole, so that you could kebab it.

116
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,200
 That's, there's lots of stories

117
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,480
 about how he had the inspiration.

118
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,720
 That's one that's mentioned.

119
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,840
 - I think it's definitely true

120
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,640
 that they did have donuts in the war, though, isn't it?

121
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,920
 In the First World War,

122
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,160
 they had the Salvation Army volunteers

123
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,560
 who went there on the front line,

124
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,840
 and they just went there to make various sweet meats

125
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,000
 and cakes and stuff,

126
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,920
 but they realized that donuts, actually,

127
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,480
 you don't really need many ingredients for them.

128
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,560
 You don't need to bake them.

129
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,080
 You can just cook them in oil,

130
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:30,080
 so they're really easy to do right on the front line.

131
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,880
 And I think the popularity of donuts,

132
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,000
 people put it down to that

133
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,080
 because the servicemen came home

134
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,120
 and they kind of got a taste for the donut.

135
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,960
 - Quite brave, these, they were called the dough lassies?

136
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,920
 The Salvation Army, and there's some men in the tents as well,

137
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,880
 the Salvation Army tents, and plenty of women, too,

138
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,040
 and they were sort of looking after the American soldiers,

139
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,880
 and sometimes they got shrapnel in the tents,

140
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,240
 they were that close to the front lines, and yeah.

141
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,840
 - That's how sprinkles were born.

142
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,880
 (laughing)

143
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,720
 - And didn't they, they used Stolder's helmets

144
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,560
 as frying pan?

145
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,400
 - As cooking pan.

146
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,240
 - Really?

147
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,160
 - They used bayonets to store the donuts on them.

148
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,120
 - This is amazing.

149
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,120
 The whole of war was just a donut production unit.

150
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,040
 - It was, that was what it was for.

151
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,680
 - Wait, is it a bayonet charge they're doing,

152
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,880
 or are they just bringing us some lovely new donut?

153
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,520
 - Is that a jam, or is it, yeah.

154
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,360
 - Open your mouth, and cross your fingers.

155
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,640
 No, they did, they said they used Stolder's helmets,

156
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,960
 they'd asked for a Stolder's helmet to double up

157
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,000
 as a frying pan, 'cause they didn't have

158
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,600
 any of the equipment at first.

159
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,680
 Well, this is what they claimed,

160
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,200
 but I don't believe these women, because they also claim--

161
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,120
 - Your cash price.

162
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,000
 (laughing)

163
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,720
 - There were two women who started it, really,

164
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,320
 it was their idea, and Helen Pervience,

165
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,240
 who was one of those, another Perv.

166
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,240
 - Another Perv, yeah.

167
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,800
 - She wrote that in one day,

168
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,640
 her and her one colleague, Margaret,

169
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,640
 who were making these in their frying pans,

170
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,200
 using their shell casings as rolling pins,

171
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,480
 she wrote they'd make in one day 2,500 donuts,

172
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,720
 100 cupcakes, 50 pies, 800 pancakes,

173
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,400
 and 255 gallons of cocoa,

174
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,400
 which James, you've worked in catering.

175
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,320
 - That's a lot.

176
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,160
 - That's not possible.

177
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,080
 - War catering, isn't it?

178
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,800
 Can we talk about the mad donut myth,

179
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,680
 I think this is not true of donuts in general.

180
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,160
 - Okay, go on, 'cause I'm gonna counter it,

181
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,480
 I think it might be true.

182
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,200
 - Oh, okay, while we're in New England,

183
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,000
 they had been brought over as oily cooks,

184
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,240
 which is the Dutch word meaning oily cakes,

185
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,480
 cakes were cooked in oil,

186
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,240
 and then in New England,

187
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,040
 there was a woman called Elizabeth Gregory,

188
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,260
 and her son was a ship's captain,

189
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,960
 and she wanted to feed him,

190
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,040
 you know, keep him well fed at sea and all of that,

191
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:35,760
 and she put nuts in the center of the little cake she made,

192
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,620
 there was dough in the middle, dough, nuts, donuts,

193
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:41,860
 and supposedly her son, Hanson Gregory,

194
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,620
 put the hole in donuts,

195
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,180
 because he was a ship's captain,

196
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,740
 he was at the wheel having one of his snacks,

197
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,380
 a terrible storm blew up,

198
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,860
 he was trying to control this big ship's wheel,

199
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:54,500
 he jams his donut on the wheel.

200
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:59,180
 - Are you deliberately making up extra stuff now?

201
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,500
 - This is the story.

202
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,060
 - He skews it on the ship's wheel to control the donut,

203
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,140
 while he's, you know, helming with it.

204
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,980
 - It makes total sense.

205
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,940
 - He's trying to control the ship and keep his lovely donut.

206
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,340
 - I actually think, Andy,

207
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:13,140
 that you were not going to go down any of this rope,

208
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,940
 but as soon as I said that, I believe it,

209
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,980
 you thought, right, what is the most ridiculous thing

210
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,060
 that I could possibly say?

211
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,460
 - What's the back end of that story?

212
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,220
 They make it through the storm,

213
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,700
 he removes the donuts,

214
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,820
 and everyone goes, what's that?

215
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:25,900
 - I think that's it.

216
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:26,740
 - Is that it?

217
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,980
 - He did claim that he had made the hole himself,

218
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,260
 but he claimed he'd done it on purpose,

219
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,140
 rather than jamming it on the wheel later.

220
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,540
 - Yeah, with good reason,

221
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,980
 because it wasn't cooking properly on the inside.

222
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,860
 - So I'm skeptical about Elizabeth Gregory

223
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:38,820
 put the nuts in the middle,

224
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,780
 but I think he just said it wasn't cooking right

225
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:43,460
 on the inside, so I thought, take the inside out,

226
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,420
 and then it cooks right.

227
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:47,060
 - I'm with Anna, I think the nut thing doesn't make sense,

228
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:49,060
 because the word nut just means a cake,

229
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:51,580
 like ginger nuts or biscuits or whatever,

230
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,940
 but the fact that it was invented by him

231
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:57,340
 and he put the hole in, the dates do work.

232
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:58,180
 - Okay, okay.

233
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:00,980
 - So it definitely was invented somewhere around New England,

234
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,620
 and it was definitely around that time

235
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:05,260
 when we first see donuts with holes in.

236
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:08,340
 And he was really proud of it, like if he didn't do it,

237
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,820
 he really embraced the idea that he did.

238
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,260
 - He definitely thought he did.

239
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,620
 - He did, or he wanted to convince the world.

240
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:17,260
 And he would say, when an interviewer asked him in 1916,

241
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:21,140
 when he was 85 years old, how he felt about it,

242
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:24,140
 was he pleased when he got the results

243
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:26,820
 of this first donut ever that he made?

244
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:31,100
 He said, "Was Columbus pleased when he landed in America?"

245
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:31,940
 - What year was that?

246
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,300
 - That was 19-- - 1492.

247
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,260
 - It was 1916, and I know what you're gonna say.

248
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,380
 We have bigger fish to fry.

249
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,900
 - Another period of total war,

250
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,260
 which for America at the time--

251
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,140
 - For America at a healthy and time of peace.

252
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:47,740
 - Do you know the idea of dunking donuts,

253
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:50,340
 very big in America, not sure if it's massive here,

254
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,180
 is it massive here?

255
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,820
 - Do you mean the shop or the--

256
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:55,220
 - I mean the act itself of doing it.

257
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:57,060
 - It's not, I don't think it's a big thing here.

258
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,420
 - But in America, it was, and there's a lot of theories

259
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,820
 about who was the first person to do it,

260
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,460
 where it came from.

261
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:07,420
 - It was a ship's captain who's donut fell overboard

262
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:11,180
 during the Boston Tea Party.

263
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,980
 This is delicious.

264
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:15,340
 - Well, the donut princess has put forward a few theories

265
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,620
 in the donut book.

266
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,900
 One is that she said that it began in the Civil War,

267
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:22,460
 it was inspired by soldiers dunking hardtack into coffee,

268
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,940
 hardtack being a type of biscuit

269
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,740
 that they would put in or a cracker.

270
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,060
 But then there's this other theory

271
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:32,660
 that Hollywood actress who was really big called May Murray,

272
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,380
 so namesake of you, Andy.

273
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:37,380
 She was sitting in a cafe, she was holding her donut

274
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,900
 and it slipped out of her fingers and fell into her coffee

275
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,100
 and she picked it out.

276
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,380
 And the person with her did the same thing

277
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,100
 to make it look like it was intentional.

278
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,900
 And because so many people were watching,

279
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,060
 they went, "Wow, what's that?"

280
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:50,780
 And it became a fad off the back of this famous actress.

281
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,340
 - Wouldn't you love to be a person

282
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:54,820
 who was famous or respected or feared enough

283
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,300
 that you could do something really stupid

284
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,580
 and it became copied and trendy?

285
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,700
 - The other day I was playing golf

286
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,260
 and someone said to me halfway around,

287
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,900
 "Oh, your flies are undone."

288
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,740
 Imagine if the next day you come into central London

289
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,060
 and everyone's got their flies in.

290
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:10,700
 - Yeah, exactly. - That's the dream, isn't it?

291
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,660
 - That doesn't happen, there'll be many examples of that.

292
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:15,980
 - You know, in our, a bit of behind the scenes

293
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:19,220
 inside baseball here, you know our Google document

294
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:22,060
 where we put what subjects we've researched each week

295
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:24,500
 so that we don't go in different directions.

296
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:28,180
 We all spelt the word "donut" differently, right?

297
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:30,980
 And I spelt it the American way, D-O-N-U-T,

298
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,860
 because I just think everyone knows what you mean

299
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,500
 and it just saves a few characters.

300
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,500
 - Same time, yeah.

301
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,740
 - But the interesting thing about that, I think,

302
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:42,980
 is the original spelling was D-O-N-O-T-E-S, for donuts.

303
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,660
 - Donut days. - Donuties.

304
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:47,900
 - Donut days, yes. - And that's from 1782.

305
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:53,060
 And then we have donuts with D-O-U-G-H, nuts,

306
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,460
 which is the British way of spelling it.

307
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:57,260
 And that's kind of takes over and becomes the main thing.

308
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,500
 And then the spelling D-O-N-U-T,

309
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,260
 which is how Americans spell it.

310
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,460
 There's a journalist called Kate Taylor

311
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,980
 for Business Insider who looked at this

312
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,220
 and found that basically,

313
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:10,780
 if you look at where Dunkin' Donuts opens throughout America,

314
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,980
 you can see where the spelling changes.

315
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:16,020
 And spelling basically changes wherever Dunkin' Donuts goes.

316
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,700
 People start spelling it that way.

317
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:21,420
 - They used to spell it with the "U-G-H" in the middle.

318
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,900
 - And obviously now Dunkin' Donuts is ubiquitous in America,

319
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,140
 so everyone spells it any time.

320
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:28,460
 - That makes sense because you're in all the old newspaper archives,

321
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,180
 the Americans are spelling it with a "G-H".

322
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,980
 But I must admit, I put it in our public doc,

323
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,860
 public to the four of us with a "G-H",

324
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,740
 but in my private notes, it's too much effort

325
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:39,580
 to put those extra three letters in and I just got it out.

326
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:40,580
 - Get out. - Sorry.

327
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,100
 - It's amazing. - We keep saying Dunkin' Donuts.

328
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,220
 Do you know in America it's no longer called that?

329
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,740
 It's now just called Dunkin'.

330
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,020
 They've lost the donuts.

331
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:51,220
 And I think it's largely because as the donut ambassador,

332
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:54,900
 not weighed in, the donut archduke, not made a statement.

333
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,620
 - Well, it sounds like they don't sell as many donuts

334
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,740
 as they used to back in the day.

335
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,420
 They're largely a coffee and restaurant place.

336
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,540
 Dunkin' is what they're called colloquially,

337
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,260
 you know, that people just say, "Let's go to Dunkin'".

338
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,820
 So it's gone, but except globally,

339
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,460
 we've still got it as Dunkin' Donuts.

340
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:11,260
 - I think we should not leave out

341
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:15,340
 the world's leading donut consuming country in this.

342
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:17,660
 - San Marino. - San Marino.

343
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:21,900
 - And that's by Shea Volly, but it's not per person.

344
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,460
 It's just, that's amazing.

345
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:26,420
 - No, I've seen the claim in various places

346
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:27,260
 that it's actually Canada.

347
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,100
 - Yeah, I saw that.

348
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,100
 It's amazing that, isn't it?

349
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:29,940
 - Really?

350
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,820
 - Tim Hortons is the chain.

351
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:32,820
 - He's a hockey player.

352
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,020
 - Yes, now, sadly, no longer with us.

353
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,300
 I don't know. - Related to the--

354
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,460
 - No, I don't believe so.

355
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:38,460
 I don't believe so.

356
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,260
 But yeah, it's a big-- - He used to skate over

357
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,820
 and he would put donuts on the end of his ice skates.

358
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:46,780
 - Well, they can be dangerous.

359
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:49,660
 In the Donut Princesses book, she cites a few times

360
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,540
 where donuts can lead to major issues

361
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:54,100
 under a title called What Can Donuts Do?

362
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,220
 On the highway, I saw a man stuff a chocolate

363
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,260
 donut in his mouth.

364
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,980
 Then his car skidded into two cars

365
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,820
 for a three car crackup.

366
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,780
 So just a word of warning.

367
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:03,620
 - That's a donut fault, that, isn't it?

368
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:05,180
 - What are the chances of the Donut Princesses

369
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,980
 watching you in a car eating a donut,

370
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,700
 leading to a crash, right?

371
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:09,860
 What's her outfit like?

372
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:12,380
 - That's probably what put him up when he was driving.

373
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:14,980
 He's like, "My God, that woman's dressed

374
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,420
 in just two donuts over her nipples."

375
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:20,660
 - That would be such a bad nipple cover

376
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:23,900
 'cause it would be the only bit that it didn't turn.

377
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,220
 Didn't cover, wouldn't it?

378
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:27,140
 - That's what makes it sexy.

379
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:30,540
 And you get the nipple access.

380
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:31,380
 - I was reading that.

381
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,140
 Have you guys come across this thing that in France,

382
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,980
 anything that is a sweet fried cake

383
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,980
 has the nickname of nuns fart?

384
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:37,820
 - Really?

385
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,300
 - I think nun fart is a specific thing.

386
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,220
 - That's a specific cake, I think.

387
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:44,300
 It's so light and airy that it's like a nun's fart.

388
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,620
 - It's like a profiterole, isn't it?

389
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,780
 - Oh, that's not the story that I read.

390
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:48,620
 - Oh, God.

391
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:51,180
 - Okay, according to the Donut Princesses, the--

392
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,500
 - Okay, now, because we know what nuns fart is,

393
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,380
 now I'm thinking that maybe not everything

394
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,700
 the Donut Princesses saying it might be true.

395
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,420
 - So, no, she definitely saw someone crash a car

396
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,620
 after eating a chocolate donut.

397
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:05,340
 She says that a long time ago,

398
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:07,740
 there was a nun called Agnes,

399
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,580
 and Agnes and her fellow nuns were in the kitchen

400
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,740
 making some stuff,

401
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:15,580
 and one of them had some sweet dough on a spoon,

402
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,820
 and Agnes farted really loud,

403
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,860
 and it made the other nun laugh so much

404
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,860
 that she dropped the dough into the water

405
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:26,100
 with the oil in it, frying it, and what?

406
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:30,300
 This is the Smithsonian's leading doughnut ephemera expert

407
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:33,020
 who is putting this in her brilliant book,

408
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:35,860
 and yeah, and so that became the byword for you,

409
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:39,060
 it's a nun's fart because it inspired the dish.

410
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,940
 - In which religious tract did the nuns

411
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,780
 record this for posterity?

412
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:46,380
 One of us has got to write this moment down.

413
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,980
 - That's very funny, yeah.

414
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:50,060
 I thought it was just 'cause it was a lovely light cake,

415
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:52,340
 but now I realize it's because of Agnes,

416
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:54,220
 specific incident, my goodness.

417
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,220
 - Agnes the nun.

418
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:59,300
 - Why do cops like doughnuts?

419
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,580
 - That's the myth, isn't it?

420
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:01,420
 - Yeah. - In America?

421
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:02,260
 - I don't think it's a myth.

422
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,220
 - They do buy doughnuts.

423
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,060
 - Yeah, they do.

424
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:04,900
 - Why?

425
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,940
 - 'Cause they've got, they have like a deal,

426
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,860
 do they get like 20% off every purchase?

427
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:09,700
 - No.

428
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,140
 - If you're on a, like a stakeout,

429
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,100
 might be the last day on the force.

430
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:14,940
 - Yeah.

431
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:17,020
 - But you're having to sit out there for 24 hours

432
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:19,540
 while the hoodlums are doing whatever they do inside.

433
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:21,540
 - That's it, can you hang it round your gun?

434
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,140
 - Is it, is it so messy?

435
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:24,860
 - I was in the middle of a bit of whimsy here at the house.

436
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:27,860
 - Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry, I got too excited.

437
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,900
 - They're tired, so they need to drink coffee

438
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,380
 and what goes with coffee doughnuts?

439
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,700
 - Well, not far off actually, yeah.

440
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,780
 Sort of irritating, considering it was whimsy.

441
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:39,140
 No, basically it was, the sort of,

442
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,340
 the idea of it comes from the '50s.

443
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,420
 It was when cops were often on the late night beat

444
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,860
 and they were the only snacks available.

445
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,620
 They were the only shops open a lot of the time

446
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:46,700
 'cause they have a morning rush

447
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,700
 and they would have to stay up late baking away

448
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,540
 for the morning.

449
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,300
 So it was one of the only options available to them.

450
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:54,460
 - I want James's 'Women's Call the Wire' version.

451
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,460
 I want that to continue rather than that.

452
00:15:56,460 --> 00:16:00,060
 A quite mundane to be honest explanation for, yeah.

453
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:00,900
 - Sorry, yeah.

454
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:01,900
 - Can you make something better up,

455
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:02,740
 like the doughnut princess?

456
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:04,860
 - Sorry, my guys, my guys are tired now.

457
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:07,100
 (laughing)

458
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,680
 (upbeat music)

459
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:17,140
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is James.

460
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:19,460
 - Okay, my fact this week is that scientists

461
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:23,220
 are using poetry from the past to protect porpoises.

462
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,580
 - Beautifully illiterated.

463
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,220
 Is that the most illiterative fact we've ever had?

464
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,060
 Do you think?

465
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:27,900
 - I think so, yeah.

466
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,340
 - If it had been to protect slugs,

467
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:31,140
 would you have still put it forward as a fact?

468
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:33,140
 - I would have still said the word scientist at the start

469
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,580
 but the rest of it might have been different.

470
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:35,900
 (laughing)

471
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:40,080
 - Sonnet, from the 17th century to save slugs.

472
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,300
 (laughing)

473
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,460
 - Anyway, sorry, porpoises, porpoises.

474
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,500
 - Yeah, so this is a team

475
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,300
 from the Chinese Academy of Sciences

476
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:48,780
 and they looked at 700 ancient Chinese poems

477
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:50,420
 dating back nearly 2000 years

478
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:53,220
 and then they've managed to work out the habitat

479
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:57,260
 that has been lost in the time, which is extensive.

480
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:00,220
 - So is it like someone in the fifth century

481
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,260
 writes a poem saying,

482
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,780
 oh, I saw a great porpoise over here

483
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:03,700
 and it reminded me of--

484
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:06,420
 - Yeah, so we know where on the Yangtze River,

485
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:08,420
 so this is all on the Yangtze River in China,

486
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,940
 that we know where they will have lived,

487
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:12,060
 where they will have written, where they will have visited

488
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,620
 and they write about porpoises

489
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:15,980
 because porpoises are really big, they're really obvious,

490
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:18,660
 they're quite active on the surface of the water.

491
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,180
 Especially when there's thunderstorms,

492
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:22,300
 they kind of jump around and try and catch fish

493
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,220
 and so that's obviously quite a moment

494
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,700
 for someone to write poetry about.

495
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:28,740
 So, yeah, there's lots of examples of it in history

496
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,780
 and they've kind of mapped it out

497
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,660
 and then they looked at actual science

498
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:33,900
 and they said, yeah, it's the same

499
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,220
 as what actual science says.

500
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,060
 - That's really cool.

501
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,260
 - So it kind of fills in the gaps a little bit.

502
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,100
 - Yeah, it's brilliant.

503
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:38,940
 - That's nice.

504
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,300
 - One of the poets was an emperor.

505
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,700
 It was one of the, yeah, he was--

506
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,880
 - Was it a stoner emperor?

507
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,140
 (laughing)

508
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,980
 - Qianlong, he was sailing across the Yangtze River

509
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,660
 and yeah, he wrote,

510
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:53,540
 "Porpuses chased moonlight on silvered tides

511
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:57,040
 "as dragons summoned storm clouds loom in sight."

512
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,580
 And that was used as part of the--

513
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:59,420
 - Very cool.

514
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:02,060
 And of course, dragons have died out now as well, haven't they?

515
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:04,060
 So, that is one of the problems

516
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,780
 because a lot of the things that people wrote

517
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:08,260
 were metaphorical, so you're not always,

518
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:10,700
 you have to kind of read the poem, understand the poem

519
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:13,020
 and then work out, are they talking about a porpoise

520
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,780
 that they've seen or are they talking about a long lost love?

521
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,660
 - Yeah, particularly in China, you're right.

522
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:19,660
 All of this stuff is like Qianlong himself,

523
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:22,980
 he had a concubine who was called the Fragrant Concubine

524
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:23,820
 and she's--

525
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,780
 - Doesn't say much for the rest of the concubines.

526
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:27,980
 (laughing)

527
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:30,420
 - So, he may, I'll go for the Fragrant one again.

528
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:32,420
 (laughing)

529
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,420
 He was overseas and he smelt her and he was like,

530
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:36,900
 "Oh my God, I've never smelt anything like you before."

531
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,020
 He was like, "Oh, he didn't smell her from overseas."

532
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,500
 He was overseas, yeah.

533
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,660
 - Was she also overseas though?

534
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,620
 - Yeah, obviously, he was next to her guys.

535
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,460
 He was next to her.

536
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,900
 - I'm imagining, he saw a picture of her smelling

537
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:49,260
 like a cartoon character floats towards her.

538
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,540
 (laughing)

539
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,780
 - Well, he fell in love with her

540
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,620
 and he was like, "I must make her one of my concubines."

541
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,140
 And the deal was struck and she came back

542
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,540
 and she was bathed in camel's milk all the way

543
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,820
 as she was coming back to make sure

544
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,340
 that her fragrance remained there.

545
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,180
 - Preserved the fragrance.

546
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,620
 - Yeah, but then we don't know if she was real or not.

547
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:04,620
 - That suggests that she smelled like camel's milk,

548
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:05,940
 doesn't it?

549
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,060
 - Hang on, wait, what's the porpoise

550
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:09,580
 and she was called known as the Fragrant Porpoise Woman?

551
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:12,300
 - No, no, no, I was saying that all these metaphors,

552
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,740
 dragons and so on were used, like even in his life,

553
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:16,420
 we have a concubine who's written about

554
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,980
 and we don't know if she was real or not.

555
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:18,820
 - I see.

556
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,140
 - It's sort of a mythic road.

557
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:22,140
 - Yeah, maybe I've been misunderstanding poetry

558
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,380
 all my life so far, but sometimes when I read poems,

559
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:25,660
 I don't assume that it's all based

560
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,420
 in scientific historical facts.

561
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,700
 - Well, it depends on the poet, doesn't it?

562
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,220
 Philip Larkin, if he says I found a hedgehog,

563
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,980
 you sort of trust that.

564
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:35,900
 These ones are finless porpoises, aren't they?

565
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:36,740
 - Yes.

566
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:37,580
 - Which are very cool.

567
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,500
 I believe the only freshwater porpoise in the world,

568
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,420
 every other kind lives out at sea.

569
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:43,900
 And porpoises are just a family of toothed whales,

570
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,420
 small whales, basically.

571
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,940
 But finless really gave me pause

572
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:50,020
 and I was really surprised to read that.

573
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:52,180
 And it turns out they do, I was thinking they would,

574
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,820
 how do they move?

575
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:54,860
 - They're just like a sausage.

576
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,500
 - They're just like a sort of gray sausage in the water.

577
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,900
 It turns out they just don't have a dorsal fin on their back.

578
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,540
 Yeah, they do have flippers on the front.

579
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,380
 - Interesting.

580
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,220
 - Yes.

581
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,060
 - Oh, yes, yes.

582
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:06,700
 - I find it really interesting and very surprising

583
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:09,460
 having read this, that dolphins and porpoises

584
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:12,940
 are not the two most closely related animals to each other.

585
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:13,940
 - Oh, what?

586
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:14,780
 - Isn't that weird?

587
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:17,220
 Well, you would think that who is most closely related

588
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,460
 to a porpoise, a dolphin, absolutely.

589
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:21,180
 But actually it's not that at all, is it?

590
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,020
 - Who is it?

591
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:22,860
 - No, a hedgehog.

592
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,740
 - It's the other toothed whales, basically.

593
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:25,580
 - Oh, really?

594
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:26,900
 - Yeah, yeah.

595
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,340
 - Looks-wise, I feel quite bad for them

596
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:30,780
 'cause they're basically confated with dolphins.

597
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:33,540
 And essentially, whenever they're described,

598
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:38,100
 they're like fat, snub-nosed, spayed-toothed dolphins.

599
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,740
 That's why when you're like,

600
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,180
 what's the difference between a porpoise and a dolphin?

601
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:43,340
 It's like a dolphin has a beautiful, elegant long nose.

602
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:44,980
 Porpoise has this squashed thing.

603
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:45,980
 - I think they're charming.

604
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,220
 - And they're stocky.

605
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,100
 They're stocky, though.

606
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,180
 Come on, they're broad, aren't they?

607
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:52,220
 - They're all stocky, they're the long nose.

608
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,300
 - When will you see a thin dolphin, yuck?

609
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,500
 - Have you guys seen, there's a Wikipedia page

610
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,060
 which is sort of known for its joke.

611
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,700
 So it's the list of cetaceans

612
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,220
 and it's got all the whales, dolphins

613
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,900
 and porpoises listed down.

614
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,740
 - Like a cetacean-needed kind of thing.

615
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:05,580
 - Exactly.

616
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,620
 So what they have is that they have the name

617
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,500
 of the animal and then they'll say,

618
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,780
 how many are in the wild?

619
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:11,740
 And then they have a photo

620
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:14,460
 and if they're missing a photo, they say, cetacean-needed.

621
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:15,820
 - Oh, that's very good.

622
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:16,660
 - It's very good.

623
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:17,940
 And the list, I think, used to have more,

624
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,100
 but it's down to one now.

625
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,780
 It's just got one cetacean-needed,

626
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,500
 which is the Durrani-Yagala's Beaked Whale.

627
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,740
 And there are photos out there,

628
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,340
 but just no one's put one on Wikipedia.

629
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:28,940
 So if anyone out there wants to fill the final cetacean-needed.

630
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:30,300
 - And spoil the joke.

631
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,140
 - Wow.

632
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:32,540
 - Is that the reason they haven't put it up?

633
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,540
 'Cause they want to keep the joke?

634
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:34,380
 - That's what I was thinking.

635
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,820
 But it's pretty depressing reading as well, by the way,

636
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,140
 despite the really great gag,

637
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:40,980
 because it does show how many are left in the wild

638
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:43,140
 with certain porpoises and dolphins and whales,

639
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,540
 and it's really scary.

640
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:47,580
 - These ones are down to about 1,200.

641
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:49,020
 They've had a very, very slight bounce back,

642
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,540
 but the numbers are still so much lower

643
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:52,420
 than they were even 30 years ago.

644
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:54,820
 It's 'cause the Yanksie has a lot of sand mining,

645
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:57,220
 much of it illegal, and it obviously just completely

646
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,740
 messes up their habitat, you know?

647
00:21:58,740 --> 00:21:59,580
 - Yeah.

648
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:00,420
 - Yeah.

649
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,420
 - The Vaquita is probably the worst, right?

650
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:03,260
 - Yeah.

651
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,100
 - In a good way.

652
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:04,940
 - Yeah.

653
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:07,380
 There was how many do we reckon about a dozen?

654
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,700
 In 2021, the estimate was 10 porpoises

655
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,980
 remaining in the wild.

656
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:14,780
 The problem is that there's a fish called the totoaba,

657
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:19,420
 and their swim bladders are very popular in Chinese medicine.

658
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:21,780
 They're known as aquatic cocaine.

659
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:24,700
 - They go for like $50,000 per bladder.

660
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:25,540
 - It's mental.

661
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,380
 - It's insane.

662
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:27,340
 - Is that the Vaquita?

663
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:29,020
 - No, that's the totoaba.

664
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:31,020
 So people fish for that fish,

665
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:33,540
 and then they end up damaging the Vaquita.

666
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:35,140
 - The fishing nets just happened.

667
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:35,980
 They're the same size.

668
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,860
 - But the Vaquitas live off Mexico.

669
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:38,700
 - Yeah.

670
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:41,980
 - But it's crazy that a demand for something in China

671
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:42,820
 is messing up species.

672
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:45,220
 - The Chinese ones, they used to have similar fish in China,

673
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:48,540
 but they died out, and so they go to the Mexican ones instead.

674
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,540
 - Chinese medicine does have quite a lot to answer,

675
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,380
 doesn't it?

676
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,220
 When you read about extinctions,

677
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,940
 there's a lot of animals.

678
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:57,580
 - I gotta say though, the prices, they are eye-watering.

679
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,340
 And you can kind of see where the poachers

680
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,900
 are coming from, kind of curious.

681
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:01,740
 - Oh, I'd do it.

682
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:03,660
 I'd kill the last day in a heartbeat.

683
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,340
 That's gonna get me a million dollars.

684
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:08,220
 - It's mental how expensive they are for a swim bladder.

685
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,060
 - Yeah.

686
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:09,900
 - That's crazy.

687
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:10,980
 - And also, maybe they're all experts,

688
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:14,860
 but I wouldn't be able to tell totoaba swim bladder

689
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,260
 from a cod swim bladder.

690
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,100
 - No, you're right.

691
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,860
 There's in fact, do you know what, guys?

692
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:21,860
 There's money to be made here in faking swim bladders,

693
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:23,700
 and we'll protect the Vaquita at the same time.

694
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:24,540
 - Oh, great.

695
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:25,660
 All right, we'll head to shop

696
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:27,140
 at nosuchthingasfish.com.

697
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,820
 (all laughing)

698
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:29,660
 Oh my God.

699
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:34,300
 Can we talk about the harbour porpoise, please?

700
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,060
 'Cause that one's not doing so badly

701
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:38,660
 in endangerment terms, relatively.

702
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,620
 And they are amazing.

703
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:44,020
 So, this is a thing specifically about their mating.

704
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,540
 And if you wanna see a harbour porpoise mate,

705
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:47,340
 there's one place in the world to go.

706
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,620
 And it's the Golden Gate Bridge.

707
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:51,300
 Ah, 'cause they hang out in the sort of narrow

708
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:53,820
 channels of water under that very romantic, and you just--

709
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:54,660
 - When you say one place,

710
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:56,540
 is this like the Sargato Sea for eels?

711
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:58,460
 All harbour porpoises from all around the world,

712
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:00,100
 congregate under the Golden Gate Bridge.

713
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,660
 - No, no, no, it's just a good place

714
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:02,900
 'cause you have a great vantage point

715
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,020
 through the slats like a pervert, basically.

716
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,460
 And it's called the funnel of love

717
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:08,380
 is where these channels are that they mate.

718
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,260
 - Cool.

719
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:11,020
 - Did you guys read about the mating process?

720
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:11,860
 - No.

721
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:12,700
 - It's crazy.

722
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:15,260
 It takes one second, okay?

723
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:18,260
 So, basically, the female will surface for air.

724
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,540
 That's her big mistake.

725
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:21,740
 She very briefly swims along the surface,

726
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:23,420
 at which point a nearby male

727
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:26,780
 will just prang himself at her like a torpedo,

728
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:29,860
 approaching 100% of the time from the left-hand side,

729
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,420
 that's important.

730
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:33,780
 The female has about half a second to assess

731
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:37,180
 whether she wants to raise this male's offspring,

732
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:39,740
 and either twist towards him or away from him, basically.

733
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:41,740
 So, if it goes wrong, he just goes,

734
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:44,820
 "Beyoing," bounces off,

735
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:47,620
 corkscrews out of the water, it goes off.

736
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,620
 And if it goes right,

737
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:51,620
 then there's a very, very, very quick coupling,

738
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:52,460
 and then--

739
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:53,220
 - For a second.

740
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:54,180
 - For a one second,

741
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:57,100
 and then she might well be pregnant.

742
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,460
 But it's really interesting,

743
00:24:58,460 --> 00:24:59,780
 is this evolutionary race going on,

744
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:02,180
 the male's penis is very asymmetrical,

745
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:04,220
 and it might be because males have worked out

746
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:07,020
 the optimal angle to approach from,

747
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,900
 to give themselves a chance,

748
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:11,500
 and the female's reproductive tract is very complicated,

749
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,740
 potentially because the female's trying to,

750
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,140
 in evolutionary terms,

751
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:17,220
 have a bit more control over this procedure,

752
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,500
 and scientists have worked all this out.

753
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,140
 The males have approached from that side

754
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,780
 to get around the vaginal folding.

755
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,500
 - So, you could tell, if you were a female,

756
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,340
 and you turned around,

757
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:27,180
 you'd know that this person's interested in you,

758
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:28,780
 because of the angle they're coming at.

759
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:30,420
 - Well, he's swimming towards you with a penis,

760
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:32,380
 a third of the length of his body, very, very fast.

761
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:34,500
 So, like, the signals are not mixed.

762
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,340
 This is not a--

763
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:38,980
 - This is not a rubbing, thicky moment.

764
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,420
 - And their testes go massive.

765
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:42,700
 They've got big testicles in breeding season.

766
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,980
 The total body mass can go in the testes,

767
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:48,340
 can be represented as four to six percent of their body weight.

768
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:50,100
 - It'll be three kilos for you, Deb.

769
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:50,940
 - Yes.

770
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:51,780
 - Nice.

771
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,580
 - Like, 'cause four to six percent doesn't sound much,

772
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:55,580
 but then three kilos would be a...

773
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:56,420
 How much is that?

774
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:57,260
 Like, at least twice as much.

775
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:59,020
 - Well, I'd have to contact my tailor.

776
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:01,700
 (both laughing)

777
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:05,780
 - Yeah, bad news, though, for harvopopsis in Britain,

778
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:07,860
 we have some pollutants called PCBs,

779
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:10,500
 polychlorinated biphenyls,

780
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:13,700
 and they were used in, like, old light bulbs

781
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,500
 and hydraulic fluids and stuff like that,

782
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,620
 but they're used for many, many years.

783
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:19,980
 They're banned now, but they're still in the environment.

784
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:22,820
 And if a harper has too much of that,

785
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,740
 then the testes will shrink.

786
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:25,580
 - Oh, no.

787
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:29,020
 - Another thing about harvopopsis

788
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,300
 that I think this might explain why

789
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,460
 they can only make for one second

790
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,620
 is 'cause they have to be eating all the time.

791
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:34,540
 - Oh, really?

792
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:36,740
 - So they live in cold water,

793
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:38,060
 which requires lots and lots of energy,

794
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:39,740
 and they're quite small.

795
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:42,780
 And so they can only eat really small fish.

796
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:45,220
 And so they need just hundreds of them.

797
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:46,700
 And there's a study that found that they can hunt

798
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:49,260
 up to 550 fish per hour.

799
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:50,180
 - Oh, gosh.

800
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:53,100
 - And they have a 90% hunting success rate as well,

801
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,900
 which I think is up there with dragonflies,

802
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:57,780
 which I think we've said are the most successful hunters.

803
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,820
 But yeah, if you're eating 500 fish an hour,

804
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,260
 you just don't really have time

805
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:03,660
 to do anything else at all.

806
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:05,060
 - And you're saying they have to be eating

807
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:07,100
 just to maintain their body weight?

808
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,860
 - Yes, I think they lose,

809
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:11,300
 they would lose 10% of their body weight a day

810
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,140
 if they didn't eat.

811
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:14,340
 So they die very quickly, they disappear.

812
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,180
 - Gosh.

813
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,980
 - I know, what an easy diet, though.

814
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:18,340
 Imagine if you were told you were going to lose

815
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:20,300
 10% of your body weight a day if you didn't eat.

816
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,140
 And please, please.

817
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,940
 - 'Cause then pick up the sea that they've got in them.

818
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:27,300
 - I can still imagine it getting to about 5 p.m.

819
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,480
 and me seeing that key line,

820
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,860
 pie-end operation thinking I'll start tomorrow.

821
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:34,440
 (upbeat music)

822
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:39,860
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three.

823
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:41,340
 And that is my fact.

824
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,220
 My fact this week is in Canada,

825
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:46,900
 tractor tires are filled up with vegetable juice.

826
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:47,740
 This is so interesting.

827
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,460
 It's a ballast thing.

828
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:52,020
 So you've got tractors with the center of gravity's way off

829
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:54,220
 and you could tip over, that's very, very dangerous.

830
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:56,340
 So you need to counter that weight now.

831
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:59,820
 So instead of putting air into these giant back tires,

832
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:03,240
 beet juice is something that is used a lot.

833
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,540
 And for various reasons,

834
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:06,940
 one is that in Canada gets very cold.

835
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:08,700
 If you put water in there, that could freeze.

836
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:11,620
 So that's really bad for the whole tractor in its own right.

837
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:14,940
 So they use this because it can get really cold

838
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:15,940
 and not freeze.

839
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,660
 - And you've got a, yet you put a straw in,

840
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:20,180
 nice little drink on a cold day.

841
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:21,420
 - I just want to say as well,

842
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:24,300
 like ballast is not just used to stop you tipping,

843
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,340
 it's to give you grip.

844
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:28,540
 So let's say it's a really muddy day or even an icy day

845
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:32,860
 and you want to get your tractor to go down a muddy field,

846
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:36,060
 then you need the weight in your tires to help you get grip.

847
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,380
 - Yeah. - Lovely.

848
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,180
 - Ethylene glycol is used as well,

849
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,540
 but the problem is that is toxic.

850
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:42,480
 So if it leaks out of the tire,

851
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,380
 animals around who are eating it can die.

852
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:45,740
 So they don't like to use that.

853
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:48,100
 And then windshield washer fluid is used.

854
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,860
 That's very good as well.

855
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,220
 Yeah, that's very good as well.

856
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:53,020
 - I didn't think you got windshield water fluid

857
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:53,860
 in that quantity.

858
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:56,380
 - Well, you don't really get juice in that quantity either.

859
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:58,780
 So you've got to go to specialist places to get it.

860
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:00,500
 - That's a very good point.

861
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:04,500
 - I think windscreen fluid is also flammable.

862
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:07,380
 - Oh, cool, I mean, not cool, but you know.

863
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:09,300
 - So that's another reason why you might want to go

864
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,860
 for the beach juice. - Oh, dangerous.

865
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,580
 There we go, I've retaken that.

866
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:14,300
 We should say just a little shout out

867
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:16,900
 to the commercial name for this beach juice,

868
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:17,940
 which is Rim Guard.

869
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,300
 - Yes. - The heaviest.

870
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:22,060
 - The heaviest non-corrosive tire ballast on the market.

871
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,780
 And I went to their website and the two options are

872
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:27,740
 find a dealer of Rim Guard or become a dealer.

873
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:32,220
 I thought I was incredibly tempted to click onto a book.

874
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,940
 Anyway, would anyone like to buy,

875
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,100
 if any listeners would like to buy

876
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:38,380
 300,000 gallons of Rim Guard, please contact me.

877
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:41,380
 - I wonder why you came in such a big overcoat today.

878
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:44,700
 - I've got a bit of Rim Guard, mate.

879
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:45,980
 - God, your rims got mad.

880
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:50,980
 - Anyway, tractors, tractors.

881
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:53,060
 - Invented, I think, in Britain.

882
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,500
 - Ooh, couldn't agree more.

883
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:57,100
 - Britain, Britain, Britain, all right.

884
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:59,660
 Probably the first version of them was,

885
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:02,060
 you would get two traction engines,

886
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:05,540
 two big steam engines on either side of your field,

887
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:08,140
 and you put a big rope between the two of them,

888
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,980
 and then you would attach something to the rope,

889
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:12,580
 like a plowing machine, and you would pull it

890
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:15,220
 from one side of the field to the other.

891
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:18,020
 And that was before we had any kind of tractors,

892
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:19,220
 like we know them today.

893
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:21,980
 - I think that's a good shout, yeah, traction engines.

894
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:23,060
 - Yeah, yeah.

895
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:25,820
 There's a real mystery about the tractor,

896
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:27,900
 which is why it took so long to catch on,

897
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:31,060
 and it comes up a lot in conversations

898
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:32,780
 about what we can expect from them.

899
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:33,620
 - With Andy.

900
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:36,140
 (laughing)

901
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:38,020
 - So it's often used in chats about how long

902
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:40,140
 we should expect driverless cars to catch on,

903
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:42,580
 why isn't AI moving as fast as we think it is?

904
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,340
 You know, a new technology comes along.

905
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:46,660
 Everyone says, as they did in the 1910s,

906
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:48,420
 when tractors came along basically,

907
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:50,380
 like to mechanize farming, everyone said,

908
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:52,260
 well, this is gonna revolutionize farming immediately

909
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:54,380
 and completely replace horses.

910
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:58,820
 And incredibly, by 1942, in Britain,

911
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:02,020
 horses still outnumbered tractors by 30 to one

912
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:03,380
 on British farms.

913
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:05,740
 It took until the late 1950s for tractors

914
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:08,620
 to overtake horses, so that's like half a century.

915
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:12,060
 And yeah, it's an example of slow diffusion,

916
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:14,220
 where everyone said, this is it, end of horses.

917
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:15,780
 - And actually horses are just really good,

918
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:18,620
 'cause they're flexible and they don't use up fuel.

919
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:20,820
 - They don't use fuel, there was a depression,

920
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,140
 so people didn't really have the money

921
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:24,380
 to make the big tractor investments at the time,

922
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:25,980
 but they did have the money to employ some bloke

923
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:28,900
 to look after the horses, 'cause labor was cheap.

924
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,060
 They weren't that good at first,

925
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,300
 like they didn't have pneumatic tires,

926
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:33,380
 so they just sank in the mud quite a lot.

927
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:35,820
 - Right, yes, the tires were solid rubber

928
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:37,660
 or solid metal, in some cases.

929
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:39,380
 They were not very useful.

930
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:40,420
 This is a really interesting thing

931
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:41,860
 about the change it made.

932
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:44,860
 So in 1910, the USA had 25 million horses

933
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:46,340
 and mules on its farms.

934
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:48,460
 By 1960, there were three million left,

935
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:50,220
 so that is a huge decline,

936
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:52,460
 and they'd been replaced by five million tractors,

937
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:54,620
 'cause one tractor can do the work of lots of horses,

938
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:55,460
 basically.

939
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:57,740
 - But in 1963 million, I find it still really surprising.

940
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:58,820
 - Yeah. - That's happening.

941
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:00,620
 - America's big, isn't it?

942
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:02,420
 But in 1910, this is the other thing

943
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,860
 that tractors changed.

944
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:07,100
 One in three Americans worked on a farm.

945
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,660
 - Wow. - One in three.

946
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,500
 By 2010, a century later,

947
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,700
 it was 2% of the workforce worked on a farm.

948
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,540
 - 1910, that's wild.

949
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:15,380
 - It is.

950
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:16,740
 It's a massive shift over the last hundred years,

951
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,220
 and the same will be true in lots of other countries,

952
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,340
 obviously, you know.

953
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:21,700
 - I'm surprised it's one in 50 now.

954
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,860
 - Yeah.

955
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,540
 - When you think how big cities are

956
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:26,980
 and how much population lives in cities.

957
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,700
 - Yeah, get more tractors, lads.

958
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,140
 Why is it all hand pulling these plows?

959
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:31,180
 - Well, that might be including people

960
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:33,300
 who work on farm shops and things, I don't know.

961
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,340
 - Yeah, people who work in the Whole Foods

962
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:37,420
 probably can't serve them.

963
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:40,460
 - No doubt, that's technically agriculture, yeah.

964
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,940
 - You've got the Amish, of course,

965
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:44,260
 who don't love using tractors,

966
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,420
 so they're doing a lot of it.

967
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:47,660
 You know, that probably takes quite a lot of labour.

968
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:50,420
 But I was looking into the Amish's use of tractors,

969
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:54,020
 'cause you picture an Amish horse and cart, right?

970
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:55,660
 And you picture a horse drawn plow.

971
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:56,620
 - So these are the people

972
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:58,340
 who don't like to use any technology?

973
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,580
 - Yes. - Are they in Pennsylvania?

974
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:00,940
 - Yep. - Okay.

975
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:02,820
 - So I--

976
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:05,100
 - Big shout out to our Amish listeners, we should say.

977
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,940
 - Yeah, I'm pro this.

978
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:07,780
 So they don't use tractors.

979
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:09,540
 - Do they use podcasts?

980
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:10,740
 - I think there's quite a lot of variety

981
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:11,580
 within the Amish community.

982
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:13,620
 And I think if you're at the quite technological end,

983
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:15,500
 you might be listening to a podcast right now.

984
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,500
 - Well, write in if you're Amish

985
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,580
 and you listen and tell us how.

986
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,820
 - Please do, write in with your quill.

987
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:22,540
 (all laughing)

988
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:24,100
 - Just get us on TikTok, guys.

989
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:27,460
 - But they don't use tractors

990
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:30,340
 just because they think it's a slippery slope to cars,

991
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:31,180
 basically.

992
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:33,460
 - Well, the ballast means it's not a slippery slope.

993
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:36,700
 Maybe they haven't discovered the vegetable oil in which case.

994
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,500
 So there's lots of Amish websites that say

995
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,700
 you'll have a tractor on your farm

996
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:40,660
 and it'll run little errands,

997
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:42,340
 it'll carry hay bales around,

998
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,980
 it will fill up silo,

999
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,380
 but don't use it in the fields

1000
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:46,820
 'cause then you'll get a taste

1001
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:48,620
 for how good they are at driving.

1002
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:50,780
 And the next thing is you'll be on the roads.

1003
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:53,620
 And actually a lot of Amish people use the old tractors

1004
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:55,500
 with just the metal tires

1005
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,260
 because they really damage roads.

1006
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:59,180
 So that's to remove the temptation.

1007
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:00,980
 So if you've just got metal,

1008
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,260
 what are they called those spikes

1009
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:05,060
 that you have for proper traction on old metal tires?

1010
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:05,900
 - Winter tires.

1011
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,860
 - Lugs, lugs.

1012
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:10,780
 Then you can't get onto a road 'cause you're ruining it.

1013
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:12,300
 So you're stuck in your field.

1014
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,140
 - Right.

1015
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:14,500
 - Anyway, I thought, you know, that's interesting.

1016
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,180
 - That's certainly how I got into driving.

1017
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:17,660
 I started in a tractor

1018
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:21,140
 and now I'm knee deep in Maserati's, that's a nightmare.

1019
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:25,020
 - Well, that's the original Lamborghini was a tractor.

1020
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:25,860
 - Right.

1021
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:30,100
 - So Ferruccio Lamborghini founded his tractor company

1022
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,620
 way before he founded it as a car company.

1023
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:34,540
 - So he's slippery slope.

1024
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:37,020
 - They still make them though 'cause on Clarkson's farm,

1025
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:38,100
 he has a Lamborghini tractor.

1026
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:38,940
 - Yeah.

1027
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:41,060
 And he got really rich after selling a lot of them.

1028
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:43,700
 And so he started buying nice expensive cars

1029
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:44,700
 and he bought a Ferrari.

1030
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:47,240
 And he was really annoyed with how the clutch worked

1031
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:48,700
 in one of his Ferraris.

1032
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:50,980
 And he was also really annoyed that when he pointed it out,

1033
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,820
 the sales team were just really bad with him.

1034
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:55,220
 So he got into an argument with Enzo Ferrari

1035
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:56,460
 and said, you need to make this better.

1036
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:57,660
 And he said, go away.

1037
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,660
 And so he went, I will, and I will invent my own car,

1038
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:00,980
 which is better version of your car.

1039
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:04,580
 So the Lamborghini was built to spite the Ferrari.

1040
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:06,740
 It's a proper rivalry, but it started with tractors.

1041
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:10,460
 - I read a guy, there's a book called Lamborghini Supercar

1042
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:13,420
 Supreme, which was written by like a big historian

1043
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:14,260
 of this time.

1044
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:16,460
 And they think, even though Lamborghini said

1045
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:19,220
 that this is what happened, and even Ferrari said

1046
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:20,900
 this is what happened, they reckon it probably

1047
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:21,740
 didn't happen.

1048
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:23,980
 And it was all marketing stuff that that's.

1049
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:25,500
 - Well, I killed the joy of the story.

1050
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,660
 - I know, sorry.

1051
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,660
 - We can accept that these two people might have

1052
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:31,060
 raced down the story, but they've said it.

1053
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:34,940
 - And then they attached donuts to the exhaust pipe.

1054
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:37,180
 Lamborghini, a lot of these people actually started

1055
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:39,300
 because they were into car racing.

1056
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,700
 And Lamborghini was into car racing

1057
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,820
 for a very short amount of time.

1058
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:47,660
 He entered one of his early cars into the 1947

1059
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:50,020
 Mila Miglia road event.

1060
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,940
 And two thirds of the way through the race,

1061
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:55,340
 he crashed into a cafe and never raced again.

1062
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:58,220
 And apparently he crashed his car into the cafe.

1063
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:01,140
 And the cafe owner was like discombobulated.

1064
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:03,460
 And he said, I'll have a glass of wine, please.

1065
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:04,900
 - Brilliant.

1066
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:07,020
 - To toast the end of my racing career.

1067
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:09,220
 - And they didn't give him a glass of wine, did they?

1068
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:11,300
 - Well, it's a cafe, it depends on what time of day it was.

1069
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,740
 And what their license is.

1070
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,100
 - Oh, if it's in Italy.

1071
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:16,100
 - You think even if someone's crashed their sort of

1072
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:18,380
 tractor race car through the wall of your cafe,

1073
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:19,300
 you're serving them wine?

1074
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:21,580
 - I think I would do that because then I'd be to the police.

1075
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:22,900
 Look, he's been drinking.

1076
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:25,540
 (all laughing)

1077
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:27,540
 But I think all of these are kind of slightly

1078
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:28,660
 exaggerated stories.

1079
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:31,860
 - They're all worthy of the doughnut princess herself.

1080
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:33,820
 Can I talk about my tractor hero?

1081
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:35,100
 We've all got one.

1082
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:37,620
 Robert William Thompson, he was a Scottish engineer.

1083
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:40,780
 He made the first mechanical road haulage vehicle.

1084
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:42,340
 It was a steam traction engine.

1085
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:46,220
 So he invented the pneumatic tire in the 1840s.

1086
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:49,300
 Really before there were decent roads for a pneumatic tire.

1087
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,180
 Also before there were cars.

1088
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:53,500
 And in fact, really before there were bikes.

1089
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:56,100
 So he invented something that the world wasn't yet ready for.

1090
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:56,940
 - Right.

1091
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:57,780
 - So, and he--

1092
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:59,780
 - Running around with a steering wheel going.

1093
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:00,620
 I don't think I can do with this.

1094
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:01,980
 - It's gonna change the world.

1095
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:05,180
 And he invented it, but there was a lack of demand,

1096
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:07,540
 as I've said, and the rubber was really expensive.

1097
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:09,220
 So he couldn't make it commercial.

1098
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:11,700
 And so he went off and invented the self-filling fountain pen

1099
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:12,540
 instead.

1100
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:13,380
 - Oh, wow.

1101
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:15,300
 - It was such a great inventor and engineer.

1102
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,260
 And he had invented these tires and he tried them

1103
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:18,100
 in Regent's Park.

1104
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:20,340
 There was a big trial of two carriages next to each other.

1105
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:22,420
 One with pneumatic tires, one without.

1106
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:25,500
 And the pneumatic tire one was much nicer to ride in

1107
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,580
 and much more smooth and comfortable.

1108
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:29,180
 But yeah, there just wasn't the demand.

1109
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:31,740
 - If you, like, let's say you know how to make cars,

1110
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:33,260
 which I certainly don't know how to do that,

1111
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:34,580
 but a lot of people do.

1112
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:37,420
 And you think, okay, well, I've also made a time travel machine.

1113
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:39,380
 So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go back to the time

1114
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:42,220
 before cars, and I'm gonna make the first car.

1115
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:45,620
 And I'm gonna be, you know, my kids will be billionaires.

1116
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:48,020
 You can't go back too far, can you?

1117
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:49,300
 You have to go back to the time

1118
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,020
 just before the first one was made.

1119
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:53,420
 Because if you do go back too far, they don't have roads.

1120
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:54,260
 - You're right.

1121
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:56,540
 The conditions need to be in place.

1122
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:57,980
 Otherwise, you'd then have to invent the road.

1123
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,500
 And you don't know how to invent the road.

1124
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,340
 - Look would have it.

1125
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:01,540
 You brought a fountain pen with you.

1126
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:03,300
 (laughing)

1127
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:05,880
 (upbeat music)

1128
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:11,980
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show.

1129
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:13,500
 That is Andy.

1130
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,940
 My fact is that if civilization comes to an end,

1131
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:18,040
 one of the best places to be is a cafe

1132
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:20,220
 in Fort Mason, San Francisco.

1133
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:21,060
 - Mm-hmm.

1134
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:21,880
 - Is that so?

1135
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,780
 You got a good view of the poppers shagging.

1136
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:26,580
 You're gonna have to occupy yourself in the aftertimes.

1137
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:29,140
 That's gonna be one of the few things that is entertaining.

1138
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,860
 (laughing)

1139
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:32,660
 No, this is quite a cool thing.

1140
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:36,780
 It's a library that's called the Manual for Civilization.

1141
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:38,860
 And it's a collection of three and a half thousand books,

1142
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:41,860
 basically, which contain the operating instructions

1143
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:44,460
 for Earth, how you would start civilization again

1144
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:46,100
 from scratch if you had to.

1145
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:48,700
 And it's run by this organization called the Long Now,

1146
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:51,980
 who are, they're quite sort of eccentric,

1147
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:53,620
 but they say we need to be focusing

1148
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:55,460
 on the next 10,000 years, you know,

1149
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,660
 we've got problems with intermediate,

1150
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:59,580
 but actually we've got to preserve civilization.

1151
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:01,420
 - Yeah, yeah, I'm not gonna do my recycling

1152
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:03,660
 because what's gonna happen in 10,000 years?

1153
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:05,340
 - Yeah, exactly, exactly.

1154
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:07,500
 So it was a phrase that was coined,

1155
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:10,300
 I think unknowingly by Brian Eno, the musician.

1156
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:11,860
 He was talking with Stuart Brand

1157
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:14,220
 and a few other guys who are the founders of the Long Now.

1158
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:16,340
 And they were saying all the stuff about,

1159
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:17,540
 remember how back in the day,

1160
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:19,500
 people used to talk about the year 2000

1161
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,820
 and all the like, what's going on in the year two?

1162
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:21,660
 And we don't do that.

1163
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,180
 We don't talk about the year 3000

1164
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:24,500
 in the way that they would talk about.

1165
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:25,860
 - I think not much has changed,

1166
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:27,220
 but we live under water.

1167
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:28,540
 (laughing)

1168
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:31,020
 I think philosophers have talked about this for years.

1169
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:33,620
 - That's a huge change as well.

1170
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:35,700
 The infrastructural changes.

1171
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,460
 How do you mean not much change?

1172
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:39,700
 (laughing)

1173
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:43,740
 How do trades work under water?

1174
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:44,740
 What are you saying?

1175
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:47,340
 Okay, Buzz has been talking about it,

1176
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:49,180
 but not many other people.

1177
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:51,620
 But yeah, so like in the Long Now Foundation,

1178
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:54,020
 for example, we're not living in the year 2025,

1179
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:56,460
 we're living in the year 2020-25.

1180
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:59,460
 - I really like, it's quite teenage to do.

1181
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:02,660
 They were founded in '09, 1996.

1182
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:04,620
 - I mean, everything that I read about these guys,

1183
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:06,260
 it does sound like teenagers

1184
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:08,340
 who have just read a book for the first time go,

1185
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:10,220
 ah, but dude, what about this?

1186
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:11,820
 - Well, Stuart Brand, the founder,

1187
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:14,260
 he's part of that old counterculture America.

1188
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:16,500
 He was part of LSD and all that.

1189
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,780
 He had these big hippie ideas of changing the world.

1190
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:21,500
 And so he's, yeah, those little things,

1191
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:24,340
 I think they were a bit sort of hippie-ish in their ideas.

1192
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:25,340
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1193
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:27,180
 - I mean, there's a very good thing to be focusing on.

1194
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:30,060
 Obviously, I mean, it's largely what responsible people

1195
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:31,420
 who look to the future do focus on,

1196
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:34,540
 but what I quite like is that this cafe,

1197
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:36,380
 which has the big library in it, doesn't it?

1198
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:38,300
 So the cafe is called The Interval,

1199
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:40,620
 and it was founded with such great ideals,

1200
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:42,060
 and it reminded me a little bit,

1201
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:43,980
 and I say this with complete fondness,

1202
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:47,940
 of QI actually set up its own bar many years ago.

1203
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:49,380
 And I'm sure many other people have done this,

1204
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:50,540
 thought I'm gonna set up a cafe,

1205
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:52,180
 but the idea is that everyone's gonna have

1206
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:54,100
 amazing conversations.

1207
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:56,620
 So the idea of this cafe is everyone will be discussing

1208
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,380
 topics relating to long-term thinking,

1209
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:00,420
 how to save the world in 10,000 years,

1210
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:02,460
 and you go to the TripAdvisor reviews,

1211
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,620
 and the only thing they say is,

1212
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:06,340
 "God, the cocktails are good."

1213
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,180
 - Oh, really?

1214
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:08,020
 (laughing)

1215
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:09,660
 - And that was true of the QI club as well.

1216
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:10,500
 - Yeah.

1217
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:11,660
 - The cocktails were amazing.

1218
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:14,140
 I wanna just say on the record that I disagree.

1219
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:15,780
 I think we should be looking at the problems

1220
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:17,980
 that are immediate and deal with those,

1221
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:19,300
 and I don't think we should be saying,

1222
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:21,460
 "Yeah, we don't need to save the purposes

1223
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:23,060
 "because we need to worry about what we're doing

1224
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:24,140
 "in 10,000 years."

1225
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:24,980
 - I think that's a fair point.

1226
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:26,580
 - It's just a lot easier to kick it down the road, I think.

1227
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:29,060
 - Oh, I think to be fair, that is what they're about.

1228
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:31,100
 I don't think that, I don't think they're saying,

1229
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:31,940
 let's forget about it,

1230
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:34,460
 they're looking to extend ourselves to 10,000 years.

1231
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:35,300
 - Yeah.

1232
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,140
 - You don't think so?

1233
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:38,460
 - Well, it's hard to allocate your resources,

1234
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:41,500
 like the stuff that the world is losing now,

1235
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,860
 like biodiversity and things like that,

1236
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:44,660
 I think is a really, really immediate,

1237
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:45,500
 impressive concern.

1238
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,860
 And then you have to preserve it for a long time,

1239
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:49,300
 but sometimes like,

1240
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,900
 you have to put out the fire that's burning now,

1241
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:53,660
 rather than say, "Hey, maybe this fire will spread, man."

1242
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:54,500
 - Yeah. - No, sorry,

1243
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,340
 that's not how it's done. - No, I'm just saying

1244
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:57,060
 that Stuart Brown, he created the Whole Earth Catalog.

1245
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:58,220
 - What is the Whole Earth Catalog?

1246
00:41:58,220 --> 00:41:59,820
 - It was an idea of going, where are we now?

1247
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:01,220
 What do we need to look at?

1248
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:02,700
 How do we save things?

1249
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,540
 It's a big collaboration project.

1250
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:05,620
 - Well, explain this, Dan.

1251
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:07,660
 Why are they building a clock in a Texas mountain,

1252
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:09,620
 which will function for the next 10,000 years,

1253
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:11,260
 and which you won't be able to visit?

1254
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:14,820
 - Well, you mean the one that was conceived

1255
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:18,180
 by a millionaire funded by the world's richest man,

1256
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:21,020
 and built in his private space pot inside his mountain?

1257
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:21,860
 - That's right.

1258
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:24,900
 - Well, that does sound like it'll help us in the long term.

1259
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:27,500
 - Okay, guys, when you put it like that,

1260
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:29,220
 now I sound like a horrible man.

1261
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:30,980
 - No, no, no, Jeff Bezos has funded it.

1262
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:33,900
 It's simply called The Clock, and--

1263
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:35,220
 - That's not what I call him.

1264
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:38,140
 (all laughing)

1265
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:39,620
 - Yeah, and Brian Nino's involved in that, too.

1266
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:41,300
 - Yeah, yeah, he's a founding member of--

1267
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:44,780
 - I think it like, ticks once a year or something, does it?

1268
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:45,740
 I remember reading about it.

1269
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:48,300
 Like, as in, instead of ticking once a second,

1270
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:49,660
 it ticks once a year,

1271
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:53,300
 and the cuckoo comes out once every millennium or something.

1272
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:54,580
 I think that was the original thing,

1273
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:56,260
 but for some reason they changed it,

1274
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:59,140
 and it plays a tone every 1,000 years instead of the cuckoo.

1275
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:01,100
 But originally they were gonna go for the cuckoo,

1276
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:02,500
 probably because they thought,

1277
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:04,140
 well, the cuckoo have died out by then,

1278
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:06,100
 and we don't give a fuck about that.

1279
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:08,100
 - They're not about saving stuff now.

1280
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:11,980
 They are about whatever's in charge in 10,000 years, save that.

1281
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:13,620
 - It's more about the idea,

1282
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:15,980
 is to change your manner of thinking,

1283
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:17,860
 not think about the modern day,

1284
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:19,580
 just about what's happening today and tomorrow,

1285
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:21,620
 but to think in the long term, that's their idea.

1286
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:22,940
 - Yeah. - Okay.

1287
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:24,860
 Like, you know, go on a diet today,

1288
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:27,100
 and next week you'll feel better,

1289
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:28,540
 rather than eat chocolate today.

1290
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:29,780
 - Well, they would be more like,

1291
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:33,300
 well, maybe I should buy some really, really big clothes,

1292
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:35,500
 because I'm not gonna have a diet for a while,

1293
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:37,140
 but I know that in 20 years' time,

1294
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:39,180
 I'm gonna be morbidly obese.

1295
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:40,700
 - That's actually a really good,

1296
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:43,460
 you should start marketing big clothes.

1297
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:46,580
 - This library has 3,500 books, as mentioned.

1298
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:48,860
 I found a list of some of the books that are in there,

1299
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:49,900
 'cause they are interesting.

1300
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:50,740
 What are the books that are rebuilding?

1301
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:52,540
 - So please tell me that the princess's book is in there.

1302
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:54,860
 (laughing)

1303
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:57,620
 - There's Dirt, The Erosion of Civilizations.

1304
00:43:57,620 --> 00:44:00,500
 There's six Ian M. Bank novels.

1305
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:01,740
 - They have quite a lot of sci-fi,

1306
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:03,940
 as you might expect from some sci-fi thinkers.

1307
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:05,820
 - But I was talking to a scientist the other day,

1308
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:08,020
 who said that a lot of scientific ideas are inspired

1309
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:10,420
 by reading nothing but science fiction.

1310
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:12,460
 So they are valuable things, I think.

1311
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:14,340
 - Completely, but I think they haven't chosen

1312
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:15,180
 all the books yet.

1313
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:18,540
 As of the year '0, 2014,

1314
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:21,740
 they only had about 1,400 nominations for their library,

1315
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:23,900
 and of those 200 were sci-fi.

1316
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:26,340
 And I just think, if you need a book

1317
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:28,420
 on how to build a water wheel,

1318
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:30,460
 and you've accidentally got all five Dune novels

1319
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:33,140
 in your way, or Dune is in there.

1320
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:35,060
 - I know all sorts of courses in there.

1321
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:36,820
 - They will be useful for kindling.

1322
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:38,820
 - Yeah, that's true.

1323
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:41,100
 - I wonder if they have The Buck.

1324
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:43,260
 - Ooh, The Buck. - Have you guys heard of The Buck?

1325
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:44,100
 - What's that?

1326
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:45,860
 - This was the third most successful

1327
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:47,780
 Kickstarter campaign of all time.

1328
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:50,060
 It's a book that I own as well, I have one.

1329
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:53,340
 It's 2.3 kilograms, so almost as heavy as Dan's testicles

1330
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:54,980
 if he was a corpus.

1331
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:58,940
 And it was written by a group of escape room designers.

1332
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:01,660
 And the idea is this one book will help you

1333
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:04,060
 restart civilization if you have it.

1334
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:06,540
 So on the first page, it tells you how to make string,

1335
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:08,980
 and how to start fire, and how to make wheels.

1336
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:10,940
 And then it goes all the way to the last pages,

1337
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:12,700
 which tells you how to play football,

1338
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:15,500
 and how to make sex toys, and stuff like that.

1339
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:17,620
 - Well, ironically, my testicles are the other thing

1340
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:19,100
 you need to restart civilization.

1341
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:20,460
 So that's true.

1342
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:22,220
 - That book and my balls are the--

1343
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:24,420
 - The sex toy that they came up with

1344
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:28,020
 was a five foot tall fountain, and you pour water into it.

1345
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:30,780
 And as the water goes down, it creates a vacuum

1346
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:33,380
 that makes a sucking action on a handy attachment

1347
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:35,460
 that you can attach to yourself.

1348
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:36,740
 - Do you need the fountain?

1349
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:39,420
 I mean, is that the best way of creating that suction?

1350
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:41,540
 With the technology you've got after reading the book?

1351
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:43,580
 - Well, to be honest, they do tell you

1352
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:45,980
 how to make electricity and stuff in the book.

1353
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:48,260
 So I'm not sure why, 'cause this is right at the end,

1354
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:49,340
 they do this, but yeah.

1355
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:51,140
 - They probably had a few pages left, and they thought,

1356
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:52,660
 well, we've got to fill up the book somehow.

1357
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:53,820
 So we may as well, you know.

1358
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:55,060
 - It's a great book though.

1359
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:57,620
 - It does sound really interesting.

1360
00:45:57,620 --> 00:45:59,580
 I know that it's not dealing with the immediate problems

1361
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:00,420
 facing the world.

1362
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:02,020
 I do find it quite interesting.

1363
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:04,020
 - It is interesting, the idea of--

1364
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:06,780
 - It's fun to think about in 10,000 years.

1365
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:08,220
 I mean, I don't know if you guys listened

1366
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:10,100
 to the 80,000 hours podcast, but--

1367
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:11,700
 - I've listened to the first hour, but yeah.

1368
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:13,620
 (laughing)

1369
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:15,300
 - They're always talking about the deep future

1370
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:16,220
 and what we do about it.

1371
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:18,180
 And there was one I listened to recently

1372
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:19,740
 where they interviewed Paul Cristiano,

1373
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:22,620
 who's a AI researcher who thinks about,

1374
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:26,140
 how should we leave a message to, let's say, lizard people

1375
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:29,900
 if they're the only ones who have survived in 20,000 years?

1376
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:32,020
 Sweetly, the first thing that happened in the interview

1377
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:34,580
 was he said, let's say lizards are what have survived.

1378
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:35,900
 How can we leave a message for them

1379
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:38,740
 once they've evolved to say, don't do this, do that?

1380
00:46:38,740 --> 00:46:41,540
 And Rob Wiblin, who's the host, said,

1381
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:43,100
 I must interrupt now, 'cause apparently

1382
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:45,020
 there's some insane conspiracy theory

1383
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:46,740
 that I've never really heard about,

1384
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:48,860
 about lizard people running the world.

1385
00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:50,380
 And I just want to be clear, and I was like--

1386
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:51,460
 - Yeah, they're already here, mate.

1387
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:52,500
 What's he talking about?

1388
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:53,340
 - Yeah, we're there.

1389
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:54,180
 - Is that King Charles?

1390
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:56,020
 - I did feel like you guys are so well-informed,

1391
00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:57,260
 but you don't know the right stuff.

1392
00:46:57,260 --> 00:46:59,380
 You don't know about the crazy lizard conspiracy theory.

1393
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:00,660
 - Many of the doughnut royal family

1394
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:02,140
 are actually lizards themselves.

1395
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:04,060
 (laughing)

1396
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:06,260
 But anyway, his solution, which I quite liked was,

1397
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:08,900
 you need to draw attention to a spot in Earth

1398
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:11,460
 where we can leave a message saying,

1399
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:13,460
 don't create nuclear weapons,

1400
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:15,140
 or whatever it is we want to say.

1401
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:17,060
 And Paul Cristiano's suggestion was,

1402
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:19,460
 there's this massive magnetic anomaly in Russia.

1403
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:21,500
 So if we're talking tens of thousands of years

1404
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:24,140
 in the future, anything that you carve on a rock

1405
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:26,260
 or a big structure you make will have descended

1406
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,580
 into the Earth, or tectonic plates will have moved.

1407
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:30,820
 But magnetism doesn't really change.

1408
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:33,060
 And there's this amazing thing called the Kursk anomaly,

1409
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:35,540
 I think it's called, and it's in Russia.

1410
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:37,780
 And if you go there, your compass goes totally mad.

1411
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:39,540
 The magnetism is insane.

1412
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:41,620
 And it's riddled with iron deposits.

1413
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:43,180
 And he was like, it's really easy to find

1414
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:44,780
 quite early on in civilization

1415
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:46,660
 once you've worked out magnetism.

1416
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:48,140
 Go there and then we can encode loads of,

1417
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:49,940
 just draw loads of maps there.

1418
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:51,300
 - Right.

1419
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:52,340
 - Leave them that message.

1420
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:55,620
 - Have we checked that magnetic anomaly

1421
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:57,620
 for messages from previous civilizations?

1422
00:47:57,620 --> 00:47:58,460
 - What a good point.

1423
00:47:58,460 --> 00:47:59,740
 - Yes, we actually have,

1424
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:01,740
 I've got a book called "Ancient Aliens."

1425
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:02,900
 (laughing)

1426
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:04,180
 I think it's kind of interesting.

1427
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:07,260
 Like, let's say humans die out,

1428
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:11,180
 as is probably likely over a long period, right?

1429
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:13,100
 But then some other animals don't die out.

1430
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:15,680
 Then what will the next big species be?

1431
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,020
 Like the lizards, obviously,

1432
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:20,420
 they've had their go with dinosaurs really, arguably, right?

1433
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:21,900
 - Is it a turn-based system?

1434
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:23,740
 - It's turn-based, so we've had lizards,

1435
00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:24,860
 so we've had a mammal.

1436
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:25,700
 - Yeah, yeah.

1437
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:28,540
 So one idea is octopuses.

1438
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:30,860
 - Okay, I would happily give it to them.

1439
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:33,900
 - Yeah, so like, let's say there's a big problem on earth,

1440
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:37,020
 on land-based earth that we've probably caused,

1441
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:39,540
 then maybe at the bottom of the sea, they'll be okay.

1442
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:41,660
 And the idea is that they would probably

1443
00:48:41,660 --> 00:48:44,300
 go straight to renewable energy,

1444
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:46,340
 'cause they can't really burn coal down there,

1445
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:47,620
 'cause they're underwater.

1446
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:51,340
 But what they do have is tidal power and hydrothermal,

1447
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:53,220
 so heat coming from the bottom of the ocean.

1448
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:54,060
 - Great.

1449
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:55,700
 - So they will be able to go straight in

1450
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:58,220
 at the, you know, the Tesla stage.

1451
00:48:58,220 --> 00:49:00,740
 - That's really, that's quite a comforting thought, actually.

1452
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:02,700
 - Work octopuses.

1453
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:04,020
 - Oh, God.

1454
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:06,380
 Oh, you'll be one of the right-wing octopus journalists.

1455
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:09,540
 Oh, what's wrong with getting off out of Calvary?

1456
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:12,060
 - That's the missing lyric from the Bust-It-Sog, isn't it?

1457
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:14,260
 Not much has changed, except we are now ruled

1458
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:16,980
 by our octopus overlords.

1459
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:19,220
 You've got to cut a verse, lads.

1460
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:21,540
 This is really an important verse.

1461
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:23,020
 No, cut it.

1462
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:25,700
 It doesn't play well with the 18 to 24 market.

1463
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:27,260
 Cut the octopus verse.

1464
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:30,140
 Okay, let's say we're going to the stars, then.

1465
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:33,860
 You need a crew mission which takes dozens of generations, right?

1466
00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:36,140
 How many people do you need on your spaceship?

1467
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:38,940
 - See, like, I kind of want to go on my own.

1468
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:39,780
 - Okay.

1469
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:41,820
 - I'm not sure I could last the journey.

1470
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:43,500
 - That's the octopus mindset.

1471
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:45,700
 You're going to love the anti-social octopus age.

1472
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:47,180
 - Talking to other people?

1473
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:49,540
 - Well, yeah, for like tens of thousands of years.

1474
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:52,580
 - Well, you'll die at some point, which is the consolation.

1475
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:56,140
 - Probably quite early, given what my crewmates will think.

1476
00:49:56,140 --> 00:49:59,140
 James, can you, you just pop in the airlock and again,

1477
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:02,820
 I've dropped a contact lens, I just want to know if we find it.

1478
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:05,820
 No, so basically, the mission lasts many generations.

1479
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:07,100
 Sorry, that's the thing I missed out.

1480
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:07,940
 - I see.

1481
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:09,300
 - It's going to take centuries and centuries and centuries

1482
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:11,860
 to get to the planet that we've picked, as I knew her.

1483
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:13,740
 - So, it's the question, Andy, sorry to interrupt.

1484
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:16,180
 It's the question, how many people do we need

1485
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:17,860
 so that we don't die out from imbreding?

1486
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:18,700
 - Bingo.

1487
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:19,540
 - Right.

1488
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:20,380
 - Okay.

1489
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:21,220
 - Bingo, yeah.

1490
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:22,060
 - Okay.

1491
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:22,900
 - Like four?

1492
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:24,660
 I mean, if you have a child with your cousin,

1493
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:26,020
 it's basically fine.

1494
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:28,140
 - Yes, they will have children at some point, though,

1495
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:29,140
 won't they Anna?

1496
00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:30,580
 You've not thought this through.

1497
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:33,460
 - It's exactly, that's like, that's okay for one generation.

1498
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:34,300
 - Yeah.

1499
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:35,820
 - And then it gets progressively worse.

1500
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:36,660
 - Yes.

1501
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:38,380
 - You've got the ancient Egyptians will tell you.

1502
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:40,260
 - You've got to go for 6,000 years.

1503
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:42,140
 - See, I'm a short-term thinker.

1504
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:42,980
 - Absolutely.

1505
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:43,820
 - I've got you up all along now.

1506
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:44,660
 - You're not one.

1507
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:45,740
 - I'm going to go around a hundred.

1508
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:46,580
 - Mm-hmm.

1509
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:50,580
 - Um, two, just me and my sister.

1510
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:51,420
 - And bud.

1511
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:53,060
 (laughing)

1512
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:54,620
 - It's going to be incest at some point.

1513
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:56,020
 You might as well get it over with, don't we?

1514
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:57,220
 - Let's nip it in the bud.

1515
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:58,060
 - Let's.

1516
00:50:58,060 --> 00:51:00,340
 (laughing)

1517
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:02,980
 - One of you is right, and it's obviously James.

1518
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:05,540
 (laughing)

1519
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:06,380
 - Who's it?

1520
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:07,740
 (laughing)

1521
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:09,900
 - This is the easiest game show ever

1522
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,540
 when you're up against two idiots.

1523
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:13,420
 (laughing)

1524
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:16,380
 - Send me and Dan somewhere else, honestly.

1525
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:17,740
 Make sure we're not on a ship.

1526
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:18,620
 - I don't think we're sending you

1527
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:19,740
 to one of the good planets.

1528
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:21,820
 (laughing)

1529
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:24,380
 Anna and Dan's weird incest mission.

1530
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:25,980
 You're not going to get a plum posting.

1531
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:28,220
 (laughing)

1532
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:30,800
 (upbeat music)

1533
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:33,780
 - Okay, that's it.

1534
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:34,780
 That's all of our facts.

1535
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:36,500
 Thank you so much for listening.

1536
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:38,780
 If you would like to get in contact with any of us

1537
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:40,260
 about the things that we have said

1538
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:41,740
 over the course of this podcast,

1539
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:42,980
 we can all be found online.

1540
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:45,660
 I'm on @shribeland on Instagram, James.

1541
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:47,660
 - I'm on TikTok, no such thing as James Harkin.

1542
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:50,100
 - Andy, I'm on Instagram @andrewhunterm.

1543
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:52,220
 - And if you want to get to us as a group, Anna.

1544
00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:54,580
 - You can go to Instagram @no such thing as a fish,

1545
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:58,100
 Twitter @nosuchthing or email podcast at qi.com.

1546
00:51:58,100 --> 00:52:00,100
 - Yeah, or you can go to our website,

1547
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:01,700
 nosuchthingasafish.com.

1548
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:03,900
 All of our previous episodes are up there.

1549
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:06,220
 There's a link to some live shows that we're doing

1550
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:07,380
 later this year.

1551
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:08,940
 Otherwise, just come back next week

1552
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:11,060
 'cause we will be back here with another episode.

1553
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:12,380
 We'll see you all then.

1554
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:13,220
 Goodbye.

1555
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:15,800
 (upbeat music)

1556
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:18,380
 (upbeat music)

1557
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:20,960
 (upbeat music)

1558
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:23,540
 (upbeat music)
