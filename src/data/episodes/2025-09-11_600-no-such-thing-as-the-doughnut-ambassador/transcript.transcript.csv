00:00:00,00:00:02,(upbeat music)
00:00:02,00:00:14,"- Hello, and welcome to another episode"
00:00:14,00:00:17,"of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast"
00:00:17,00:00:19,coming to you from the QI offices in Hoburn.
00:00:19,00:00:20,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:20,00:00:23,"I'm sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,"
00:00:23,00:00:25,"James Harkin, and Anna Tyshinski."
00:00:25,00:00:27,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:27,00:00:30,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.
00:00:30,00:00:32,"And in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:32,00:00:36,"Starting with fact number one, and that is Anna."
00:00:36,00:00:38,"- My fact this week is that in the 1940s,"
00:00:38,00:00:42,a mystery man traveled America measuring the holes
00:00:42,00:00:46,in donuts and passing a ruling on what size they should be.
00:00:46,00:00:47,- Pervert.
00:00:47,00:00:49,(laughing)
00:00:49,00:00:50,It's got pervert written all over it.
00:00:50,00:00:52,(laughing)
00:00:52,00:00:54,- That didn't even cross my mind.
00:00:54,00:00:56,Now I'm looking down all my research on this guy
00:00:56,00:00:57,and questioning his motives.
00:00:57,00:00:58,"- Yeah, I didn't as well."
00:00:58,00:01:00,Why is he a pervert?
00:01:00,00:01:01,What's going on?
00:01:01,00:01:03,- Just it's weird having an obsession with measuring holes
00:01:03,00:01:04,"and putting your mucky little fingers in there,"
00:01:04,00:01:05,"and like, what are you doing?"
00:01:05,00:01:06,- 'Cause he got mucky fingers.
00:01:06,00:01:07,(laughing)
00:01:07,00:01:09,"- 'Cause they got sugar on them, 'cause they're all the donuts."
00:01:09,00:01:11,- We don't know he wasn't a good hand washer.
00:01:11,00:01:13,"In fact, we know almost nothing about him."
00:01:13,00:01:14,- What was he measuring the holes with?
00:01:14,00:01:15,That's what I wanna know.
00:01:15,00:01:17,"- Come on, people."
00:01:17,00:01:18,"- Okay, now I get it."
00:01:18,00:01:19,(laughing)
00:01:19,00:01:23,- Edward Velasca was a perfectly innocent donut aficionado.
00:01:23,00:01:25,"And this, I started looking into this"
00:01:25,00:01:28,'cause there's a picture that occasionally pops up online
00:01:28,00:01:31,of a man who's holding up a big sign
00:01:31,00:01:32,with three pictures on it.
00:01:32,00:01:36,And the sign says size of donut hole down through the years.
00:01:36,00:01:38,And then there's three pictures of donuts
00:01:38,00:01:41,"in 1927, '37, and '48."
00:01:41,00:01:44,And there are just all these reports in the late 1940s
00:01:44,00:01:47,"of this guy, Edward Velasca, going around America"
00:01:47,00:01:51,and announcing that donut holes will be shrinking.
00:01:51,00:01:52,"And that, he says, is because people"
00:01:52,00:01:57,"are getting dunked dimples from handling the existing size,"
00:01:57,00:01:59,"which I think meant if the hole's too big,"
00:01:59,00:02:02,you leave a dent in your donut when you dip it.
00:02:02,00:02:04,"- Pervert, pervert, pervert, pervert."
00:02:04,00:02:05,I'm sorry.
00:02:05,00:02:06,This is just a screen spread.
00:02:06,00:02:08,"Also, this was the 1940s."
00:02:08,00:02:10,The world had big things on its plate.
00:02:10,00:02:11,- No longer.
00:02:11,00:02:12,"- Nah, they've forgotten all that."
00:02:12,00:02:13,It was '47.
00:02:13,00:02:15,- First half of the '40s was a very stressful time.
00:02:15,00:02:16,- It was.
00:02:16,00:02:18,- But second half was donut city.
00:02:18,00:02:20,"- No, you're right, people."
00:02:20,00:02:23,"- Maybe he was in the war, and when peace comes,"
00:02:23,00:02:25,I'm gonna get back to doing what I love.
00:02:25,00:02:27,- I'm thinking PTSD.
00:02:27,00:02:29,"- This, actually, that was the most plausible explanation."
00:02:29,00:02:30,"- It's all it holds, isn't it?"
00:02:30,00:02:32,"- It's a, kkkk."
00:02:32,00:02:33,"- Oh, yes, of course."
00:02:33,00:02:35,- It's the D in PTSD for donut.
00:02:35,00:02:38,"I didn't know that, I did not know that."
00:02:38,00:02:39,"- So there's a great photo, isn't there,"
00:02:39,00:02:41,"of him holding up a board,"
00:02:41,00:02:43,and he's pointing to three different donuts over the years.
00:02:43,00:02:44,- That's the one.
00:02:44,00:02:46,"- That's the one in that, exactly."
00:02:46,00:02:48,"And that photo, we have that thanks"
00:02:48,00:02:52,"to a Smithsonian collection of donut ephemera,"
00:02:52,00:02:54,which is collected by Sally L. Steinberg.
00:02:54,00:02:56,"She is the donut princess of America,"
00:02:56,00:02:57,and she wrote a book.
00:02:57,00:02:58,- Self-appointed.
00:02:58,00:02:59,- Self-appointed.
00:02:59,00:03:01,"She wrote a book called The Donut Book,"
00:03:01,00:03:03,"The Origins, History, Literature, Law, Taste,"
00:03:03,00:03:05,"Etiquette, Traditions, Techniques, Varieties,"
00:03:05,00:03:07,"Mathematics, Mythology, Commerce, Philosophy,"
00:03:07,00:03:09,"Cuisine, and Glory of the Donut,"
00:03:09,00:03:12,"which I found a copy of, and it is insane."
00:03:12,00:03:15,"It's an insane book, but it's so brilliantly researched."
00:03:15,00:03:18,And she's the person who has this photo
00:03:18,00:03:19,that we now know of as a result of her collection.
00:03:19,00:03:21,"- Yeah, if you thought the Smithsonian"
00:03:21,00:03:23,"had very serious things in its collection, it doesn't."
00:03:23,00:03:25,"It has donut ephemera from this girl,"
00:03:25,00:03:26,who was the granddaughter of that.
00:03:26,00:03:28,"I think the reason she calls herself a princess,"
00:03:28,00:03:30,"'cause she was the granddaughter of Adolf Levitt,"
00:03:30,00:03:33,"a refugee from Russia in the 1920s,"
00:03:33,00:03:34,who made America's first donut machine.
00:03:34,00:03:37,"So it got called The Donut King, and she's his offspring."
00:03:37,00:03:39,"- 'Cause obviously Russia did away with the monarchy,"
00:03:39,00:03:42,"didn't they, in the start of the 20th century,"
00:03:42,00:03:45,"but they didn't figure for the donut monarchy, did they?"
00:03:45,00:03:46,"- Yeah, indeed."
00:03:46,00:03:49,"They were chasing him down for decades, actually."
00:03:49,00:03:52,"A lot of Stalin's resources went in, tracking him down."
00:03:52,00:03:53,"- He was supposedly inspired,"
00:03:53,00:03:55,"so it goes back to the war, actually,"
00:03:55,00:03:58,"where people were cooking biscuits and dough,"
00:03:58,00:03:59,and they were putting them on bayonets
00:03:59,00:04:00,"and giving them out to soldiers,"
00:04:00,00:04:03,"so you would have the whole, so that you could kebab it."
00:04:03,00:04:05,"That's, there's lots of stories"
00:04:05,00:04:06,about how he had the inspiration.
00:04:06,00:04:07,That's one that's mentioned.
00:04:07,00:04:08,- I think it's definitely true
00:04:08,00:04:11,"that they did have donuts in the war, though, isn't it?"
00:04:11,00:04:12,"In the First World War,"
00:04:12,00:04:15,they had the Salvation Army volunteers
00:04:15,00:04:16,"who went there on the front line,"
00:04:16,00:04:18,and they just went there to make various sweet meats
00:04:18,00:04:20,"and cakes and stuff,"
00:04:20,00:04:21,"but they realized that donuts, actually,"
00:04:21,00:04:24,you don't really need many ingredients for them.
00:04:24,00:04:25,You don't need to bake them.
00:04:25,00:04:27,"You can just cook them in oil,"
00:04:27,00:04:30,so they're really easy to do right on the front line.
00:04:30,00:04:31,"And I think the popularity of donuts,"
00:04:31,00:04:33,people put it down to that
00:04:33,00:04:35,because the servicemen came home
00:04:35,00:04:37,and they kind of got a taste for the donut.
00:04:37,00:04:39,"- Quite brave, these, they were called the dough lassies?"
00:04:39,00:04:42,"The Salvation Army, and there's some men in the tents as well,"
00:04:42,00:04:44,"the Salvation Army tents, and plenty of women, too,"
00:04:44,00:04:48,"and they were sort of looking after the American soldiers,"
00:04:48,00:04:49,"and sometimes they got shrapnel in the tents,"
00:04:49,00:04:52,"they were that close to the front lines, and yeah."
00:04:52,00:04:53,- That's how sprinkles were born.
00:04:53,00:04:55,(laughing)
00:04:55,00:04:58,"- And didn't they, they used Stolder's helmets"
00:04:58,00:04:59,as frying pan?
00:04:59,00:05:00,- As cooking pan.
00:05:00,00:05:01,- Really?
00:05:01,00:05:03,- They used bayonets to store the donuts on them.
00:05:03,00:05:04,- This is amazing.
00:05:04,00:05:07,The whole of war was just a donut production unit.
00:05:07,00:05:09,"- It was, that was what it was for."
00:05:09,00:05:10,"- Wait, is it a bayonet charge they're doing,"
00:05:10,00:05:13,or are they just bringing us some lovely new donut?
00:05:13,00:05:15,"- Is that a jam, or is it, yeah."
00:05:15,00:05:18,"- Open your mouth, and cross your fingers."
00:05:18,00:05:20,"No, they did, they said they used Stolder's helmets,"
00:05:20,00:05:21,they'd asked for a Stolder's helmet to double up
00:05:21,00:05:23,"as a frying pan, 'cause they didn't have"
00:05:23,00:05:24,any of the equipment at first.
00:05:24,00:05:25,"Well, this is what they claimed,"
00:05:25,00:05:29,"but I don't believe these women, because they also claim--"
00:05:29,00:05:30,- Your cash price.
00:05:30,00:05:33,(laughing)
00:05:33,00:05:34,"- There were two women who started it, really,"
00:05:34,00:05:37,"it was their idea, and Helen Pervience,"
00:05:37,00:05:39,"who was one of those, another Perv."
00:05:39,00:05:41,"- Another Perv, yeah."
00:05:41,00:05:42,"- She wrote that in one day,"
00:05:42,00:05:44,"her and her one colleague, Margaret,"
00:05:44,00:05:46,"who were making these in their frying pans,"
00:05:46,00:05:49,"using their shell casings as rolling pins,"
00:05:49,00:05:52,"she wrote they'd make in one day 2,500 donuts,"
00:05:52,00:05:55,"100 cupcakes, 50 pies, 800 pancakes,"
00:05:55,00:05:58,"and 255 gallons of cocoa,"
00:05:58,00:06:00,"which James, you've worked in catering."
00:06:00,00:06:01,- That's a lot.
00:06:01,00:06:03,- That's not possible.
00:06:03,00:06:04,"- War catering, isn't it?"
00:06:04,00:06:06,"Can we talk about the mad donut myth,"
00:06:06,00:06:08,I think this is not true of donuts in general.
00:06:08,00:06:11,"- Okay, go on, 'cause I'm gonna counter it,"
00:06:11,00:06:12,I think it might be true.
00:06:12,00:06:15,"- Oh, okay, while we're in New England,"
00:06:15,00:06:18,"they had been brought over as oily cooks,"
00:06:18,00:06:20,"which is the Dutch word meaning oily cakes,"
00:06:20,00:06:21,"cakes were cooked in oil,"
00:06:21,00:06:23,"and then in New England,"
00:06:23,00:06:25,"there was a woman called Elizabeth Gregory,"
00:06:25,00:06:27,"and her son was a ship's captain,"
00:06:27,00:06:28,"and she wanted to feed him,"
00:06:28,00:06:31,"you know, keep him well fed at sea and all of that,"
00:06:31,00:06:35,"and she put nuts in the center of the little cake she made,"
00:06:35,00:06:38,"there was dough in the middle, dough, nuts, donuts,"
00:06:38,00:06:41,"and supposedly her son, Hanson Gregory,"
00:06:41,00:06:44,"put the hole in donuts,"
00:06:44,00:06:46,"because he was a ship's captain,"
00:06:46,00:06:47,"he was at the wheel having one of his snacks,"
00:06:47,00:06:49,"a terrible storm blew up,"
00:06:49,00:06:51,"he was trying to control this big ship's wheel,"
00:06:51,00:06:54,he jams his donut on the wheel.
00:06:54,00:06:59,- Are you deliberately making up extra stuff now?
00:06:59,00:07:00,- This is the story.
00:07:00,00:07:03,"- He skews it on the ship's wheel to control the donut,"
00:07:03,00:07:05,"while he's, you know, helming with it."
00:07:05,00:07:06,- It makes total sense.
00:07:06,00:07:08,- He's trying to control the ship and keep his lovely donut.
00:07:08,00:07:10,"- I actually think, Andy,"
00:07:10,00:07:13,"that you were not going to go down any of this rope,"
00:07:13,00:07:14,"but as soon as I said that, I believe it,"
00:07:14,00:07:16,"you thought, right, what is the most ridiculous thing"
00:07:16,00:07:18,that I could possibly say?
00:07:18,00:07:19,- What's the back end of that story?
00:07:19,00:07:21,"They make it through the storm,"
00:07:21,00:07:22,"he removes the donuts,"
00:07:22,00:07:24,"and everyone goes, what's that?"
00:07:24,00:07:25,- I think that's it.
00:07:25,00:07:26,- Is that it?
00:07:26,00:07:28,"- He did claim that he had made the hole himself,"
00:07:28,00:07:30,"but he claimed he'd done it on purpose,"
00:07:30,00:07:32,rather than jamming it on the wheel later.
00:07:32,00:07:33,"- Yeah, with good reason,"
00:07:33,00:07:35,because it wasn't cooking properly on the inside.
00:07:35,00:07:37,- So I'm skeptical about Elizabeth Gregory
00:07:37,00:07:38,"put the nuts in the middle,"
00:07:38,00:07:40,but I think he just said it wasn't cooking right
00:07:40,00:07:43,"on the inside, so I thought, take the inside out,"
00:07:43,00:07:44,and then it cooks right.
00:07:44,00:07:47,"- I'm with Anna, I think the nut thing doesn't make sense,"
00:07:47,00:07:49,"because the word nut just means a cake,"
00:07:49,00:07:51,"like ginger nuts or biscuits or whatever,"
00:07:51,00:07:53,but the fact that it was invented by him
00:07:53,00:07:57,"and he put the hole in, the dates do work."
00:07:57,00:07:58,"- Okay, okay."
00:07:58,00:08:00,"- So it definitely was invented somewhere around New England,"
00:08:00,00:08:02,and it was definitely around that time
00:08:02,00:08:05,when we first see donuts with holes in.
00:08:05,00:08:08,"And he was really proud of it, like if he didn't do it,"
00:08:08,00:08:10,he really embraced the idea that he did.
00:08:10,00:08:12,- He definitely thought he did.
00:08:12,00:08:14,"- He did, or he wanted to convince the world."
00:08:14,00:08:17,"And he would say, when an interviewer asked him in 1916,"
00:08:17,00:08:21,"when he was 85 years old, how he felt about it,"
00:08:21,00:08:24,was he pleased when he got the results
00:08:24,00:08:26,of this first donut ever that he made?
00:08:26,00:08:31,"He said, ""Was Columbus pleased when he landed in America?"""
00:08:31,00:08:31,- What year was that?
00:08:31,00:08:33,- That was 19-- - 1492.
00:08:34,00:08:36,"- It was 1916, and I know what you're gonna say."
00:08:36,00:08:37,We have bigger fish to fry.
00:08:37,00:08:39,"- Another period of total war,"
00:08:39,00:08:41,which for America at the time--
00:08:41,00:08:43,- For America at a healthy and time of peace.
00:08:43,00:08:47,"- Do you know the idea of dunking donuts,"
00:08:47,00:08:50,"very big in America, not sure if it's massive here,"
00:08:50,00:08:51,is it massive here?
00:08:51,00:08:52,- Do you mean the shop or the--
00:08:52,00:08:55,- I mean the act itself of doing it.
00:08:55,00:08:57,"- It's not, I don't think it's a big thing here."
00:08:57,00:08:59,"- But in America, it was, and there's a lot of theories"
00:08:59,00:09:01,"about who was the first person to do it,"
00:09:01,00:09:03,where it came from.
00:09:03,00:09:07,- It was a ship's captain who's donut fell overboard
00:09:07,00:09:11,during the Boston Tea Party.
00:09:11,00:09:12,This is delicious.
00:09:12,00:09:15,"- Well, the donut princess has put forward a few theories"
00:09:15,00:09:16,in the donut book.
00:09:16,00:09:18,"One is that she said that it began in the Civil War,"
00:09:18,00:09:22,"it was inspired by soldiers dunking hardtack into coffee,"
00:09:22,00:09:24,hardtack being a type of biscuit
00:09:24,00:09:26,that they would put in or a cracker.
00:09:26,00:09:28,But then there's this other theory
00:09:28,00:09:32,"that Hollywood actress who was really big called May Murray,"
00:09:32,00:09:34,"so namesake of you, Andy."
00:09:34,00:09:37,"She was sitting in a cafe, she was holding her donut"
00:09:37,00:09:39,and it slipped out of her fingers and fell into her coffee
00:09:39,00:09:41,and she picked it out.
00:09:41,00:09:43,And the person with her did the same thing
00:09:43,00:09:45,to make it look like it was intentional.
00:09:45,00:09:46,"And because so many people were watching,"
00:09:46,00:09:48,"they went, ""Wow, what's that?"""
00:09:48,00:09:50,And it became a fad off the back of this famous actress.
00:09:50,00:09:52,- Wouldn't you love to be a person
00:09:52,00:09:54,who was famous or respected or feared enough
00:09:54,00:09:57,that you could do something really stupid
00:09:57,00:09:59,and it became copied and trendy?
00:09:59,00:10:01,- The other day I was playing golf
00:10:01,00:10:03,"and someone said to me halfway around,"
00:10:03,00:10:04,"""Oh, your flies are undone."""
00:10:04,00:10:07,Imagine if the next day you come into central London
00:10:07,00:10:09,and everyone's got their flies in.
00:10:09,00:10:10,"- Yeah, exactly. - That's the dream, isn't it?"
00:10:10,00:10:12,"- That doesn't happen, there'll be many examples of that."
00:10:12,00:10:15,"- You know, in our, a bit of behind the scenes"
00:10:15,00:10:19,"inside baseball here, you know our Google document"
00:10:19,00:10:22,where we put what subjects we've researched each week
00:10:22,00:10:24,so that we don't go in different directions.
00:10:24,00:10:28,"We all spelt the word ""donut"" differently, right?"
00:10:28,00:10:30,"And I spelt it the American way, D-O-N-U-T,"
00:10:30,00:10:32,because I just think everyone knows what you mean
00:10:32,00:10:34,and it just saves a few characters.
00:10:34,00:10:35,"- Same time, yeah."
00:10:35,00:10:37,"- But the interesting thing about that, I think,"
00:10:37,00:10:42,"is the original spelling was D-O-N-O-T-E-S, for donuts."
00:10:42,00:10:44,- Donut days. - Donuties.
00:10:44,00:10:47,"- Donut days, yes. - And that's from 1782."
00:10:47,00:10:53,"And then we have donuts with D-O-U-G-H, nuts,"
00:10:53,00:10:54,which is the British way of spelling it.
00:10:54,00:10:57,And that's kind of takes over and becomes the main thing.
00:10:57,00:10:59,"And then the spelling D-O-N-U-T,"
00:10:59,00:11:01,which is how Americans spell it.
00:11:01,00:11:03,There's a journalist called Kate Taylor
00:11:03,00:11:05,for Business Insider who looked at this
00:11:05,00:11:07,"and found that basically,"
00:11:07,00:11:10,"if you look at where Dunkin' Donuts opens throughout America,"
00:11:10,00:11:12,you can see where the spelling changes.
00:11:12,00:11:16,And spelling basically changes wherever Dunkin' Donuts goes.
00:11:16,00:11:17,People start spelling it that way.
00:11:17,00:11:21,"- They used to spell it with the ""U-G-H"" in the middle."
00:11:21,00:11:23,"- And obviously now Dunkin' Donuts is ubiquitous in America,"
00:11:23,00:11:26,so everyone spells it any time.
00:11:26,00:11:28,"- That makes sense because you're in all the old newspaper archives,"
00:11:28,00:11:30,"the Americans are spelling it with a ""G-H""."
00:11:30,00:11:32,"But I must admit, I put it in our public doc,"
00:11:32,00:11:34,"public to the four of us with a ""G-H"","
00:11:34,00:11:36,"but in my private notes, it's too much effort"
00:11:36,00:11:39,to put those extra three letters in and I just got it out.
00:11:39,00:11:40,- Get out. - Sorry.
00:11:40,00:11:42,- It's amazing. - We keep saying Dunkin' Donuts.
00:11:42,00:11:44,Do you know in America it's no longer called that?
00:11:44,00:11:45,It's now just called Dunkin'.
00:11:45,00:11:47,They've lost the donuts.
00:11:47,00:11:51,"And I think it's largely because as the donut ambassador,"
00:11:51,00:11:54,"not weighed in, the donut archduke, not made a statement."
00:11:56,00:11:58,"- Well, it sounds like they don't sell as many donuts"
00:11:58,00:11:59,as they used to back in the day.
00:11:59,00:12:01,They're largely a coffee and restaurant place.
00:12:01,00:12:03,"Dunkin' is what they're called colloquially,"
00:12:03,00:12:05,"you know, that people just say, ""Let's go to Dunkin'""."
00:12:05,00:12:06,"So it's gone, but except globally,"
00:12:06,00:12:08,we've still got it as Dunkin' Donuts.
00:12:08,00:12:11,- I think we should not leave out
00:12:11,00:12:15,the world's leading donut consuming country in this.
00:12:15,00:12:17,- San Marino. - San Marino.
00:12:17,00:12:21,"- And that's by Shea Volly, but it's not per person."
00:12:21,00:12:23,"It's just, that's amazing."
00:12:23,00:12:26,"- No, I've seen the claim in various places"
00:12:26,00:12:27,that it's actually Canada.
00:12:27,00:12:28,"- Yeah, I saw that."
00:12:28,00:12:29,"It's amazing that, isn't it?"
00:12:29,00:12:29,- Really?
00:12:29,00:12:31,- Tim Hortons is the chain.
00:12:31,00:12:32,- He's a hockey player.
00:12:32,00:12:35,"- Yes, now, sadly, no longer with us."
00:12:35,00:12:36,I don't know. - Related to the--
00:12:36,00:12:37,"- No, I don't believe so."
00:12:37,00:12:38,I don't believe so.
00:12:38,00:12:40,"But yeah, it's a big-- - He used to skate over"
00:12:40,00:12:42,and he would put donuts on the end of his ice skates.
00:12:42,00:12:46,"- Well, they can be dangerous."
00:12:46,00:12:49,"In the Donut Princesses book, she cites a few times"
00:12:49,00:12:51,where donuts can lead to major issues
00:12:51,00:12:54,under a title called What Can Donuts Do?
00:12:54,00:12:56,"On the highway, I saw a man stuff a chocolate"
00:12:56,00:12:57,donut in his mouth.
00:12:57,00:12:58,Then his car skidded into two cars
00:12:58,00:13:00,for a three car crackup.
00:13:00,00:13:02,So just a word of warning.
00:13:02,00:13:03,"- That's a donut fault, that, isn't it?"
00:13:03,00:13:05,- What are the chances of the Donut Princesses
00:13:05,00:13:06,"watching you in a car eating a donut,"
00:13:06,00:13:08,"leading to a crash, right?"
00:13:08,00:13:09,What's her outfit like?
00:13:09,00:13:12,- That's probably what put him up when he was driving.
00:13:12,00:13:14,"He's like, ""My God, that woman's dressed"
00:13:14,00:13:17,"in just two donuts over her nipples."""
00:13:17,00:13:20,- That would be such a bad nipple cover
00:13:20,00:13:23,'cause it would be the only bit that it didn't turn.
00:13:23,00:13:25,"Didn't cover, wouldn't it?"
00:13:25,00:13:27,- That's what makes it sexy.
00:13:27,00:13:30,And you get the nipple access.
00:13:30,00:13:31,- I was reading that.
00:13:31,00:13:33,"Have you guys come across this thing that in France,"
00:13:33,00:13:34,anything that is a sweet fried cake
00:13:34,00:13:36,has the nickname of nuns fart?
00:13:36,00:13:37,- Really?
00:13:37,00:13:39,- I think nun fart is a specific thing.
00:13:39,00:13:40,"- That's a specific cake, I think."
00:13:40,00:13:44,It's so light and airy that it's like a nun's fart.
00:13:44,00:13:45,"- It's like a profiterole, isn't it?"
00:13:45,00:13:47,"- Oh, that's not the story that I read."
00:13:47,00:13:48,"- Oh, God."
00:13:48,00:13:51,"- Okay, according to the Donut Princesses, the--"
00:13:51,00:13:53,"- Okay, now, because we know what nuns fart is,"
00:13:53,00:13:55,now I'm thinking that maybe not everything
00:13:55,00:13:57,the Donut Princesses saying it might be true.
00:13:57,00:14:00,"- So, no, she definitely saw someone crash a car"
00:14:00,00:14:02,after eating a chocolate donut.
00:14:02,00:14:05,"She says that a long time ago,"
00:14:05,00:14:07,"there was a nun called Agnes,"
00:14:07,00:14:10,and Agnes and her fellow nuns were in the kitchen
00:14:10,00:14:11,"making some stuff,"
00:14:11,00:14:15,"and one of them had some sweet dough on a spoon,"
00:14:15,00:14:17,"and Agnes farted really loud,"
00:14:17,00:14:19,and it made the other nun laugh so much
00:14:19,00:14:22,that she dropped the dough into the water
00:14:22,00:14:26,"with the oil in it, frying it, and what?"
00:14:26,00:14:30,This is the Smithsonian's leading doughnut ephemera expert
00:14:30,00:14:33,"who is putting this in her brilliant book,"
00:14:33,00:14:35,"and yeah, and so that became the byword for you,"
00:14:35,00:14:39,it's a nun's fart because it inspired the dish.
00:14:39,00:14:40,- In which religious tract did the nuns
00:14:40,00:14:42,record this for posterity?
00:14:42,00:14:46,One of us has got to write this moment down.
00:14:46,00:14:47,"- That's very funny, yeah."
00:14:47,00:14:50,"I thought it was just 'cause it was a lovely light cake,"
00:14:50,00:14:52,"but now I realize it's because of Agnes,"
00:14:52,00:14:54,"specific incident, my goodness."
00:14:54,00:14:55,- Agnes the nun.
00:14:55,00:14:59,- Why do cops like doughnuts?
00:14:59,00:15:00,"- That's the myth, isn't it?"
00:15:00,00:15:01,- Yeah. - In America?
00:15:01,00:15:02,- I don't think it's a myth.
00:15:02,00:15:03,- They do buy doughnuts.
00:15:03,00:15:04,"- Yeah, they do."
00:15:04,00:15:04,- Why?
00:15:04,00:15:06,"- 'Cause they've got, they have like a deal,"
00:15:06,00:15:08,do they get like 20% off every purchase?
00:15:08,00:15:09,- No.
00:15:09,00:15:12,"- If you're on a, like a stakeout,"
00:15:12,00:15:14,might be the last day on the force.
00:15:14,00:15:14,- Yeah.
00:15:14,00:15:17,- But you're having to sit out there for 24 hours
00:15:17,00:15:19,while the hoodlums are doing whatever they do inside.
00:15:19,00:15:21,"- That's it, can you hang it round your gun?"
00:15:21,00:15:23,"- Is it, is it so messy?"
00:15:23,00:15:24,- I was in the middle of a bit of whimsy here at the house.
00:15:24,00:15:27,"- Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry, I got too excited."
00:15:27,00:15:29,"- They're tired, so they need to drink coffee"
00:15:29,00:15:31,and what goes with coffee doughnuts?
00:15:31,00:15:33,"- Well, not far off actually, yeah."
00:15:33,00:15:36,"Sort of irritating, considering it was whimsy."
00:15:36,00:15:39,"No, basically it was, the sort of,"
00:15:39,00:15:40,the idea of it comes from the '50s.
00:15:40,00:15:42,It was when cops were often on the late night beat
00:15:42,00:15:43,and they were the only snacks available.
00:15:43,00:15:45,They were the only shops open a lot of the time
00:15:45,00:15:46,'cause they have a morning rush
00:15:46,00:15:48,and they would have to stay up late baking away
00:15:48,00:15:49,for the morning.
00:15:49,00:15:51,So it was one of the only options available to them.
00:15:51,00:15:54,- I want James's 'Women's Call the Wire' version.
00:15:54,00:15:56,I want that to continue rather than that.
00:15:56,00:16:00,"A quite mundane to be honest explanation for, yeah."
00:16:00,00:16:00,"- Sorry, yeah."
00:16:00,00:16:01,"- Can you make something better up,"
00:16:01,00:16:02,like the doughnut princess?
00:16:02,00:16:04,"- Sorry, my guys, my guys are tired now."
00:16:04,00:16:07,(laughing)
00:16:07,00:16:09,(upbeat music)
00:16:09,00:16:17,"- Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is James."
00:16:17,00:16:19,"- Okay, my fact this week is that scientists"
00:16:19,00:16:23,are using poetry from the past to protect porpoises.
00:16:23,00:16:24,- Beautifully illiterated.
00:16:24,00:16:26,Is that the most illiterative fact we've ever had?
00:16:26,00:16:27,Do you think?
00:16:27,00:16:27,"- I think so, yeah."
00:16:27,00:16:29,"- If it had been to protect slugs,"
00:16:29,00:16:31,would you have still put it forward as a fact?
00:16:31,00:16:33,- I would have still said the word scientist at the start
00:16:33,00:16:34,but the rest of it might have been different.
00:16:34,00:16:35,(laughing)
00:16:35,00:16:40,"- Sonnet, from the 17th century to save slugs."
00:16:40,00:16:41,(laughing)
00:16:41,00:16:42,"- Anyway, sorry, porpoises, porpoises."
00:16:42,00:16:43,"- Yeah, so this is a team"
00:16:43,00:16:45,from the Chinese Academy of Sciences
00:16:45,00:16:48,and they looked at 700 ancient Chinese poems
00:16:48,00:16:50,dating back nearly 2000 years
00:16:50,00:16:53,and then they've managed to work out the habitat
00:16:53,00:16:57,"that has been lost in the time, which is extensive."
00:16:57,00:17:00,- So is it like someone in the fifth century
00:17:00,00:17:01,"writes a poem saying,"
00:17:01,00:17:02,"oh, I saw a great porpoise over here"
00:17:02,00:17:03,and it reminded me of--
00:17:03,00:17:06,"- Yeah, so we know where on the Yangtze River,"
00:17:06,00:17:08,"so this is all on the Yangtze River in China,"
00:17:08,00:17:09,"that we know where they will have lived,"
00:17:09,00:17:12,"where they will have written, where they will have visited"
00:17:12,00:17:13,and they write about porpoises
00:17:13,00:17:15,"because porpoises are really big, they're really obvious,"
00:17:15,00:17:18,they're quite active on the surface of the water.
00:17:18,00:17:20,"Especially when there's thunderstorms,"
00:17:20,00:17:22,they kind of jump around and try and catch fish
00:17:22,00:17:24,and so that's obviously quite a moment
00:17:24,00:17:25,for someone to write poetry about.
00:17:25,00:17:28,"So, yeah, there's lots of examples of it in history"
00:17:28,00:17:30,and they've kind of mapped it out
00:17:30,00:17:32,and then they looked at actual science
00:17:32,00:17:33,"and they said, yeah, it's the same"
00:17:33,00:17:35,as what actual science says.
00:17:35,00:17:36,- That's really cool.
00:17:36,00:17:37,- So it kind of fills in the gaps a little bit.
00:17:37,00:17:38,"- Yeah, it's brilliant."
00:17:38,00:17:38,- That's nice.
00:17:38,00:17:40,- One of the poets was an emperor.
00:17:40,00:17:41,"It was one of the, yeah, he was--"
00:17:41,00:17:42,- Was it a stoner emperor?
00:17:42,00:17:46,(laughing)
00:17:46,00:17:48,"- Qianlong, he was sailing across the Yangtze River"
00:17:48,00:17:50,"and yeah, he wrote,"
00:17:50,00:17:53,"""Porpuses chased moonlight on silvered tides"
00:17:53,00:17:57,"""as dragons summoned storm clouds loom in sight."""
00:17:57,00:17:58,And that was used as part of the--
00:17:58,00:17:59,- Very cool.
00:17:59,00:18:02,"And of course, dragons have died out now as well, haven't they?"
00:18:02,00:18:04,"So, that is one of the problems"
00:18:04,00:18:05,because a lot of the things that people wrote
00:18:05,00:18:08,"were metaphorical, so you're not always,"
00:18:08,00:18:10,"you have to kind of read the poem, understand the poem"
00:18:10,00:18:13,"and then work out, are they talking about a porpoise"
00:18:13,00:18:15,that they've seen or are they talking about a long lost love?
00:18:15,00:18:17,"- Yeah, particularly in China, you're right."
00:18:17,00:18:19,"All of this stuff is like Qianlong himself,"
00:18:19,00:18:22,he had a concubine who was called the Fragrant Concubine
00:18:22,00:18:23,and she's--
00:18:23,00:18:25,- Doesn't say much for the rest of the concubines.
00:18:25,00:18:27,(laughing)
00:18:27,00:18:30,"- So, he may, I'll go for the Fragrant one again."
00:18:30,00:18:32,(laughing)
00:18:32,00:18:34,"He was overseas and he smelt her and he was like,"
00:18:34,00:18:36,"""Oh my God, I've never smelt anything like you before."""
00:18:36,00:18:39,"He was like, ""Oh, he didn't smell her from overseas."""
00:18:39,00:18:40,"He was overseas, yeah."
00:18:40,00:18:41,- Was she also overseas though?
00:18:41,00:18:43,"- Yeah, obviously, he was next to her guys."
00:18:43,00:18:44,He was next to her.
00:18:44,00:18:46,"- I'm imagining, he saw a picture of her smelling"
00:18:46,00:18:49,like a cartoon character floats towards her.
00:18:49,00:18:50,(laughing)
00:18:50,00:18:51,"- Well, he fell in love with her"
00:18:51,00:18:53,"and he was like, ""I must make her one of my concubines."""
00:18:53,00:18:55,And the deal was struck and she came back
00:18:55,00:18:57,and she was bathed in camel's milk all the way
00:18:57,00:18:58,as she was coming back to make sure
00:18:58,00:19:00,that her fragrance remained there.
00:19:00,00:19:01,- Preserved the fragrance.
00:19:01,00:19:02,"- Yeah, but then we don't know if she was real or not."
00:19:02,00:19:04,"- That suggests that she smelled like camel's milk,"
00:19:04,00:19:05,doesn't it?
00:19:05,00:19:07,"- Hang on, wait, what's the porpoise"
00:19:07,00:19:09,and she was called known as the Fragrant Porpoise Woman?
00:19:09,00:19:12,"- No, no, no, I was saying that all these metaphors,"
00:19:12,00:19:14,"dragons and so on were used, like even in his life,"
00:19:14,00:19:16,we have a concubine who's written about
00:19:16,00:19:17,and we don't know if she was real or not.
00:19:17,00:19:18,- I see.
00:19:18,00:19:20,- It's sort of a mythic road.
00:19:20,00:19:22,"- Yeah, maybe I've been misunderstanding poetry"
00:19:22,00:19:24,"all my life so far, but sometimes when I read poems,"
00:19:24,00:19:25,I don't assume that it's all based
00:19:25,00:19:27,in scientific historical facts.
00:19:27,00:19:28,"- Well, it depends on the poet, doesn't it?"
00:19:28,00:19:31,"Philip Larkin, if he says I found a hedgehog,"
00:19:31,00:19:32,you sort of trust that.
00:19:32,00:19:35,"These ones are finless porpoises, aren't they?"
00:19:35,00:19:36,- Yes.
00:19:36,00:19:37,- Which are very cool.
00:19:37,00:19:39,"I believe the only freshwater porpoise in the world,"
00:19:39,00:19:41,every other kind lives out at sea.
00:19:41,00:19:43,"And porpoises are just a family of toothed whales,"
00:19:43,00:19:45,"small whales, basically."
00:19:45,00:19:47,But finless really gave me pause
00:19:47,00:19:50,and I was really surprised to read that.
00:19:50,00:19:52,"And it turns out they do, I was thinking they would,"
00:19:52,00:19:53,how do they move?
00:19:53,00:19:54,- They're just like a sausage.
00:19:54,00:19:57,- They're just like a sort of gray sausage in the water.
00:19:57,00:19:59,It turns out they just don't have a dorsal fin on their back.
00:19:59,00:20:01,"Yeah, they do have flippers on the front."
00:20:01,00:20:02,- Interesting.
00:20:02,00:20:03,- Yes.
00:20:03,00:20:04,"- Oh, yes, yes."
00:20:04,00:20:06,- I find it really interesting and very surprising
00:20:06,00:20:09,"having read this, that dolphins and porpoises"
00:20:09,00:20:12,are not the two most closely related animals to each other.
00:20:12,00:20:13,"- Oh, what?"
00:20:13,00:20:14,- Isn't that weird?
00:20:14,00:20:17,"Well, you would think that who is most closely related"
00:20:17,00:20:19,"to a porpoise, a dolphin, absolutely."
00:20:19,00:20:21,"But actually it's not that at all, is it?"
00:20:21,00:20:22,- Who is it?
00:20:22,00:20:22,"- No, a hedgehog."
00:20:22,00:20:24,"- It's the other toothed whales, basically."
00:20:24,00:20:25,"- Oh, really?"
00:20:25,00:20:26,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:20:26,00:20:28,"- Looks-wise, I feel quite bad for them"
00:20:28,00:20:30,'cause they're basically confated with dolphins.
00:20:30,00:20:33,"And essentially, whenever they're described,"
00:20:33,00:20:38,"they're like fat, snub-nosed, spayed-toothed dolphins."
00:20:38,00:20:39,"That's why when you're like,"
00:20:39,00:20:41,what's the difference between a porpoise and a dolphin?
00:20:41,00:20:43,"It's like a dolphin has a beautiful, elegant long nose."
00:20:43,00:20:44,Porpoise has this squashed thing.
00:20:44,00:20:45,- I think they're charming.
00:20:45,00:20:47,- And they're stocky.
00:20:47,00:20:48,"They're stocky, though."
00:20:48,00:20:49,"Come on, they're broad, aren't they?"
00:20:49,00:20:52,"- They're all stocky, they're the long nose."
00:20:52,00:20:54,"- When will you see a thin dolphin, yuck?"
00:20:54,00:20:56,"- Have you guys seen, there's a Wikipedia page"
00:20:56,00:20:58,which is sort of known for its joke.
00:20:58,00:20:59,So it's the list of cetaceans
00:20:59,00:21:01,"and it's got all the whales, dolphins"
00:21:01,00:21:02,and porpoises listed down.
00:21:02,00:21:04,- Like a cetacean-needed kind of thing.
00:21:04,00:21:05,- Exactly.
00:21:05,00:21:07,So what they have is that they have the name
00:21:07,00:21:09,"of the animal and then they'll say,"
00:21:09,00:21:10,how many are in the wild?
00:21:10,00:21:11,And then they have a photo
00:21:11,00:21:14,"and if they're missing a photo, they say, cetacean-needed."
00:21:14,00:21:15,"- Oh, that's very good."
00:21:15,00:21:16,- It's very good.
00:21:16,00:21:17,"And the list, I think, used to have more,"
00:21:17,00:21:19,but it's down to one now.
00:21:19,00:21:20,"It's just got one cetacean-needed,"
00:21:20,00:21:23,which is the Durrani-Yagala's Beaked Whale.
00:21:23,00:21:24,"And there are photos out there,"
00:21:24,00:21:26,but just no one's put one on Wikipedia.
00:21:26,00:21:28,So if anyone out there wants to fill the final cetacean-needed.
00:21:28,00:21:30,- And spoil the joke.
00:21:30,00:21:31,- Wow.
00:21:31,00:21:32,- Is that the reason they haven't put it up?
00:21:32,00:21:33,'Cause they want to keep the joke?
00:21:33,00:21:34,- That's what I was thinking.
00:21:34,00:21:36,"But it's pretty depressing reading as well, by the way,"
00:21:36,00:21:38,"despite the really great gag,"
00:21:38,00:21:40,because it does show how many are left in the wild
00:21:40,00:21:43,"with certain porpoises and dolphins and whales,"
00:21:43,00:21:44,and it's really scary.
00:21:44,00:21:47,"- These ones are down to about 1,200."
00:21:47,00:21:49,"They've had a very, very slight bounce back,"
00:21:49,00:21:50,but the numbers are still so much lower
00:21:50,00:21:52,than they were even 30 years ago.
00:21:52,00:21:54,"It's 'cause the Yanksie has a lot of sand mining,"
00:21:54,00:21:57,"much of it illegal, and it obviously just completely"
00:21:57,00:21:58,"messes up their habitat, you know?"
00:21:58,00:21:59,- Yeah.
00:21:59,00:22:00,- Yeah.
00:22:00,00:22:02,"- The Vaquita is probably the worst, right?"
00:22:02,00:22:03,- Yeah.
00:22:03,00:22:04,- In a good way.
00:22:04,00:22:04,- Yeah.
00:22:04,00:22:07,There was how many do we reckon about a dozen?
00:22:07,00:22:09,"In 2021, the estimate was 10 porpoises"
00:22:09,00:22:10,remaining in the wild.
00:22:10,00:22:14,"The problem is that there's a fish called the totoaba,"
00:22:14,00:22:19,and their swim bladders are very popular in Chinese medicine.
00:22:19,00:22:21,They're known as aquatic cocaine.
00:22:21,00:22:24,"- They go for like $50,000 per bladder."
00:22:24,00:22:25,- It's mental.
00:22:25,00:22:26,- It's insane.
00:22:26,00:22:27,- Is that the Vaquita?
00:22:27,00:22:29,"- No, that's the totoaba."
00:22:29,00:22:31,"So people fish for that fish,"
00:22:31,00:22:33,and then they end up damaging the Vaquita.
00:22:33,00:22:35,- The fishing nets just happened.
00:22:35,00:22:35,They're the same size.
00:22:35,00:22:37,- But the Vaquitas live off Mexico.
00:22:37,00:22:38,- Yeah.
00:22:38,00:22:41,- But it's crazy that a demand for something in China
00:22:41,00:22:42,is messing up species.
00:22:42,00:22:45,"- The Chinese ones, they used to have similar fish in China,"
00:22:45,00:22:48,"but they died out, and so they go to the Mexican ones instead."
00:22:48,00:22:50,"- Chinese medicine does have quite a lot to answer,"
00:22:50,00:22:51,doesn't it?
00:22:51,00:22:52,"When you read about extinctions,"
00:22:52,00:22:53,there's a lot of animals.
00:22:53,00:22:57,"- I gotta say though, the prices, they are eye-watering."
00:22:57,00:22:59,And you can kind of see where the poachers
00:22:59,00:23:00,"are coming from, kind of curious."
00:23:00,00:23:01,"- Oh, I'd do it."
00:23:01,00:23:03,I'd kill the last day in a heartbeat.
00:23:03,00:23:05,That's gonna get me a million dollars.
00:23:05,00:23:08,- It's mental how expensive they are for a swim bladder.
00:23:08,00:23:09,- Yeah.
00:23:09,00:23:09,- That's crazy.
00:23:09,00:23:10,"- And also, maybe they're all experts,"
00:23:10,00:23:14,but I wouldn't be able to tell totoaba swim bladder
00:23:14,00:23:16,from a cod swim bladder.
00:23:16,00:23:17,"- No, you're right."
00:23:17,00:23:18,"There's in fact, do you know what, guys?"
00:23:18,00:23:21,"There's money to be made here in faking swim bladders,"
00:23:21,00:23:23,and we'll protect the Vaquita at the same time.
00:23:23,00:23:24,"- Oh, great."
00:23:24,00:23:25,"All right, we'll head to shop"
00:23:25,00:23:27,at nosuchthingasfish.com.
00:23:27,00:23:28,(all laughing)
00:23:28,00:23:29,Oh my God.
00:23:29,00:23:34,"Can we talk about the harbour porpoise, please?"
00:23:34,00:23:36,'Cause that one's not doing so badly
00:23:36,00:23:38,"in endangerment terms, relatively."
00:23:38,00:23:40,And they are amazing.
00:23:40,00:23:44,"So, this is a thing specifically about their mating."
00:23:44,00:23:45,"And if you wanna see a harbour porpoise mate,"
00:23:45,00:23:47,there's one place in the world to go.
00:23:47,00:23:48,And it's the Golden Gate Bridge.
00:23:48,00:23:51,"Ah, 'cause they hang out in the sort of narrow"
00:23:51,00:23:53,"channels of water under that very romantic, and you just--"
00:23:53,00:23:54,"- When you say one place,"
00:23:54,00:23:56,is this like the Sargato Sea for eels?
00:23:56,00:23:58,"All harbour porpoises from all around the world,"
00:23:58,00:24:00,congregate under the Golden Gate Bridge.
00:24:00,00:24:01,"- No, no, no, it's just a good place"
00:24:01,00:24:02,'cause you have a great vantage point
00:24:02,00:24:05,"through the slats like a pervert, basically."
00:24:05,00:24:06,And it's called the funnel of love
00:24:06,00:24:08,is where these channels are that they mate.
00:24:08,00:24:09,- Cool.
00:24:09,00:24:11,- Did you guys read about the mating process?
00:24:11,00:24:11,- No.
00:24:11,00:24:12,- It's crazy.
00:24:12,00:24:15,"It takes one second, okay?"
00:24:15,00:24:18,"So, basically, the female will surface for air."
00:24:18,00:24:19,That's her big mistake.
00:24:19,00:24:21,"She very briefly swims along the surface,"
00:24:21,00:24:23,at which point a nearby male
00:24:23,00:24:26,"will just prang himself at her like a torpedo,"
00:24:26,00:24:29,"approaching 100% of the time from the left-hand side,"
00:24:29,00:24:31,that's important.
00:24:31,00:24:33,The female has about half a second to assess
00:24:33,00:24:37,"whether she wants to raise this male's offspring,"
00:24:37,00:24:39,"and either twist towards him or away from him, basically."
00:24:39,00:24:41,"So, if it goes wrong, he just goes,"
00:24:41,00:24:44,"""Beyoing,"" bounces off,"
00:24:44,00:24:47,"corkscrews out of the water, it goes off."
00:24:47,00:24:48,"And if it goes right,"
00:24:48,00:24:51,"then there's a very, very, very quick coupling,"
00:24:51,00:24:52,and then--
00:24:52,00:24:53,- For a second.
00:24:53,00:24:54,"- For a one second,"
00:24:54,00:24:57,and then she might well be pregnant.
00:24:57,00:24:58,"But it's really interesting,"
00:24:58,00:24:59,"is this evolutionary race going on,"
00:24:59,00:25:02,"the male's penis is very asymmetrical,"
00:25:02,00:25:04,and it might be because males have worked out
00:25:04,00:25:07,"the optimal angle to approach from,"
00:25:07,00:25:08,"to give themselves a chance,"
00:25:08,00:25:11,"and the female's reproductive tract is very complicated,"
00:25:11,00:25:13,"potentially because the female's trying to,"
00:25:13,00:25:15,"in evolutionary terms,"
00:25:15,00:25:17,"have a bit more control over this procedure,"
00:25:17,00:25:19,and scientists have worked all this out.
00:25:19,00:25:21,The males have approached from that side
00:25:21,00:25:22,to get around the vaginal folding.
00:25:22,00:25:24,"- So, you could tell, if you were a female,"
00:25:24,00:25:25,"and you turned around,"
00:25:25,00:25:27,"you'd know that this person's interested in you,"
00:25:27,00:25:28,because of the angle they're coming at.
00:25:28,00:25:30,"- Well, he's swimming towards you with a penis,"
00:25:30,00:25:32,"a third of the length of his body, very, very fast."
00:25:32,00:25:34,"So, like, the signals are not mixed."
00:25:34,00:25:36,This is not a--
00:25:36,00:25:38,"- This is not a rubbing, thicky moment."
00:25:38,00:25:40,- And their testes go massive.
00:25:40,00:25:42,They've got big testicles in breeding season.
00:25:42,00:25:44,"The total body mass can go in the testes,"
00:25:44,00:25:48,can be represented as four to six percent of their body weight.
00:25:48,00:25:50,"- It'll be three kilos for you, Deb."
00:25:50,00:25:50,- Yes.
00:25:50,00:25:51,- Nice.
00:25:51,00:25:53,"- Like, 'cause four to six percent doesn't sound much,"
00:25:53,00:25:55,but then three kilos would be a...
00:25:55,00:25:56,How much is that?
00:25:56,00:25:57,"Like, at least twice as much."
00:25:57,00:25:59,"- Well, I'd have to contact my tailor."
00:25:59,00:26:01,(both laughing)
00:26:01,00:26:05,"- Yeah, bad news, though, for harvopopsis in Britain,"
00:26:05,00:26:07,"we have some pollutants called PCBs,"
00:26:07,00:26:10,"polychlorinated biphenyls,"
00:26:10,00:26:13,"and they were used in, like, old light bulbs"
00:26:13,00:26:15,"and hydraulic fluids and stuff like that,"
00:26:15,00:26:16,"but they're used for many, many years."
00:26:16,00:26:19,"They're banned now, but they're still in the environment."
00:26:19,00:26:22,"And if a harper has too much of that,"
00:26:22,00:26:24,then the testes will shrink.
00:26:24,00:26:25,"- Oh, no."
00:26:25,00:26:29,- Another thing about harvopopsis
00:26:29,00:26:30,that I think this might explain why
00:26:30,00:26:31,they can only make for one second
00:26:31,00:26:33,is 'cause they have to be eating all the time.
00:26:33,00:26:34,"- Oh, really?"
00:26:34,00:26:36,"- So they live in cold water,"
00:26:36,00:26:38,"which requires lots and lots of energy,"
00:26:38,00:26:39,and they're quite small.
00:26:39,00:26:42,And so they can only eat really small fish.
00:26:42,00:26:45,And so they need just hundreds of them.
00:26:45,00:26:46,And there's a study that found that they can hunt
00:26:46,00:26:49,up to 550 fish per hour.
00:26:49,00:26:50,"- Oh, gosh."
00:26:50,00:26:53,"- And they have a 90% hunting success rate as well,"
00:26:53,00:26:54,"which I think is up there with dragonflies,"
00:26:54,00:26:57,which I think we've said are the most successful hunters.
00:26:57,00:26:59,"But yeah, if you're eating 500 fish an hour,"
00:26:59,00:27:01,you just don't really have time
00:27:01,00:27:03,to do anything else at all.
00:27:03,00:27:05,- And you're saying they have to be eating
00:27:05,00:27:07,just to maintain their body weight?
00:27:07,00:27:08,"- Yes, I think they lose,"
00:27:08,00:27:11,they would lose 10% of their body weight a day
00:27:11,00:27:12,if they didn't eat.
00:27:12,00:27:14,"So they die very quickly, they disappear."
00:27:14,00:27:15,- Gosh.
00:27:15,00:27:16,"- I know, what an easy diet, though."
00:27:16,00:27:18,Imagine if you were told you were going to lose
00:27:18,00:27:20,10% of your body weight a day if you didn't eat.
00:27:20,00:27:22,"And please, please."
00:27:22,00:27:24,- 'Cause then pick up the sea that they've got in them.
00:27:24,00:27:27,- I can still imagine it getting to about 5 p.m.
00:27:27,00:27:28,"and me seeing that key line,"
00:27:28,00:27:31,pie-end operation thinking I'll start tomorrow.
00:27:31,00:27:34,(upbeat music)
00:27:34,00:27:39,"- Okay, it is time for fact number three."
00:27:39,00:27:41,And that is my fact.
00:27:41,00:27:43,"My fact this week is in Canada,"
00:27:43,00:27:46,tractor tires are filled up with vegetable juice.
00:27:46,00:27:47,This is so interesting.
00:27:47,00:27:49,It's a ballast thing.
00:27:49,00:27:52,So you've got tractors with the center of gravity's way off
00:27:52,00:27:54,"and you could tip over, that's very, very dangerous."
00:27:54,00:27:56,So you need to counter that weight now.
00:27:56,00:27:59,"So instead of putting air into these giant back tires,"
00:27:59,00:28:03,beet juice is something that is used a lot.
00:28:03,00:28:04,"And for various reasons,"
00:28:04,00:28:06,one is that in Canada gets very cold.
00:28:06,00:28:08,"If you put water in there, that could freeze."
00:28:08,00:28:11,So that's really bad for the whole tractor in its own right.
00:28:11,00:28:14,So they use this because it can get really cold
00:28:14,00:28:15,and not freeze.
00:28:15,00:28:17,"- And you've got a, yet you put a straw in,"
00:28:17,00:28:20,nice little drink on a cold day.
00:28:20,00:28:21,"- I just want to say as well,"
00:28:21,00:28:24,"like ballast is not just used to stop you tipping,"
00:28:24,00:28:25,it's to give you grip.
00:28:25,00:28:28,So let's say it's a really muddy day or even an icy day
00:28:28,00:28:32,"and you want to get your tractor to go down a muddy field,"
00:28:32,00:28:36,then you need the weight in your tires to help you get grip.
00:28:36,00:28:37,- Yeah. - Lovely.
00:28:37,00:28:39,"- Ethylene glycol is used as well,"
00:28:39,00:28:40,but the problem is that is toxic.
00:28:40,00:28:42,"So if it leaks out of the tire,"
00:28:42,00:28:44,animals around who are eating it can die.
00:28:44,00:28:45,So they don't like to use that.
00:28:45,00:28:48,And then windshield washer fluid is used.
00:28:48,00:28:49,That's very good as well.
00:28:49,00:28:51,"Yeah, that's very good as well."
00:28:51,00:28:53,- I didn't think you got windshield water fluid
00:28:53,00:28:53,in that quantity.
00:28:53,00:28:56,"- Well, you don't really get juice in that quantity either."
00:28:56,00:28:58,So you've got to go to specialist places to get it.
00:28:58,00:29:00,- That's a very good point.
00:29:00,00:29:04,- I think windscreen fluid is also flammable.
00:29:04,00:29:07,"- Oh, cool, I mean, not cool, but you know."
00:29:07,00:29:09,- So that's another reason why you might want to go
00:29:09,00:29:10,"for the beach juice. - Oh, dangerous."
00:29:10,00:29:12,"There we go, I've retaken that."
00:29:12,00:29:14,We should say just a little shout out
00:29:14,00:29:16,"to the commercial name for this beach juice,"
00:29:16,00:29:17,which is Rim Guard.
00:29:17,00:29:19,- Yes. - The heaviest.
00:29:19,00:29:22,- The heaviest non-corrosive tire ballast on the market.
00:29:22,00:29:23,And I went to their website and the two options are
00:29:23,00:29:27,find a dealer of Rim Guard or become a dealer.
00:29:27,00:29:32,I thought I was incredibly tempted to click onto a book.
00:29:32,00:29:33,"Anyway, would anyone like to buy,"
00:29:33,00:29:35,if any listeners would like to buy
00:29:35,00:29:38,"300,000 gallons of Rim Guard, please contact me."
00:29:38,00:29:41,- I wonder why you came in such a big overcoat today.
00:29:43,00:29:44,"- I've got a bit of Rim Guard, mate."
00:29:44,00:29:45,"- God, your rims got mad."
00:29:45,00:29:50,"- Anyway, tractors, tractors."
00:29:50,00:29:53,"- Invented, I think, in Britain."
00:29:53,00:29:54,"- Ooh, couldn't agree more."
00:29:54,00:29:57,"- Britain, Britain, Britain, all right."
00:29:57,00:29:59,"Probably the first version of them was,"
00:29:59,00:30:02,"you would get two traction engines,"
00:30:02,00:30:05,"two big steam engines on either side of your field,"
00:30:05,00:30:08,"and you put a big rope between the two of them,"
00:30:08,00:30:09,"and then you would attach something to the rope,"
00:30:09,00:30:12,"like a plowing machine, and you would pull it"
00:30:12,00:30:15,from one side of the field to the other.
00:30:15,00:30:18,"And that was before we had any kind of tractors,"
00:30:18,00:30:19,like we know them today.
00:30:19,00:30:21,"- I think that's a good shout, yeah, traction engines."
00:30:21,00:30:23,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:30:23,00:30:25,"There's a real mystery about the tractor,"
00:30:25,00:30:27,"which is why it took so long to catch on,"
00:30:27,00:30:31,and it comes up a lot in conversations
00:30:31,00:30:32,about what we can expect from them.
00:30:32,00:30:33,- With Andy.
00:30:33,00:30:36,(laughing)
00:30:36,00:30:38,- So it's often used in chats about how long
00:30:38,00:30:40,"we should expect driverless cars to catch on,"
00:30:40,00:30:42,why isn't AI moving as fast as we think it is?
00:30:42,00:30:44,"You know, a new technology comes along."
00:30:44,00:30:46,"Everyone says, as they did in the 1910s,"
00:30:46,00:30:48,"when tractors came along basically,"
00:30:48,00:30:50,"like to mechanize farming, everyone said,"
00:30:50,00:30:52,"well, this is gonna revolutionize farming immediately"
00:30:52,00:30:54,and completely replace horses.
00:30:54,00:30:58,"And incredibly, by 1942, in Britain,"
00:30:58,00:31:02,horses still outnumbered tractors by 30 to one
00:31:02,00:31:03,on British farms.
00:31:03,00:31:05,It took until the late 1950s for tractors
00:31:05,00:31:08,"to overtake horses, so that's like half a century."
00:31:08,00:31:12,"And yeah, it's an example of slow diffusion,"
00:31:12,00:31:14,"where everyone said, this is it, end of horses."
00:31:14,00:31:15,"- And actually horses are just really good,"
00:31:15,00:31:18,'cause they're flexible and they don't use up fuel.
00:31:18,00:31:20,"- They don't use fuel, there was a depression,"
00:31:20,00:31:22,so people didn't really have the money
00:31:22,00:31:24,"to make the big tractor investments at the time,"
00:31:24,00:31:25,but they did have the money to employ some bloke
00:31:25,00:31:28,"to look after the horses, 'cause labor was cheap."
00:31:28,00:31:30,"They weren't that good at first,"
00:31:30,00:31:31,"like they didn't have pneumatic tires,"
00:31:31,00:31:33,so they just sank in the mud quite a lot.
00:31:33,00:31:35,"- Right, yes, the tires were solid rubber"
00:31:35,00:31:37,"or solid metal, in some cases."
00:31:37,00:31:39,They were not very useful.
00:31:39,00:31:40,This is a really interesting thing
00:31:40,00:31:41,about the change it made.
00:31:41,00:31:44,"So in 1910, the USA had 25 million horses"
00:31:44,00:31:46,and mules on its farms.
00:31:46,00:31:48,"By 1960, there were three million left,"
00:31:48,00:31:50,"so that is a huge decline,"
00:31:50,00:31:52,"and they'd been replaced by five million tractors,"
00:31:52,00:31:54,"'cause one tractor can do the work of lots of horses,"
00:31:54,00:31:55,basically.
00:31:55,00:31:57,"- But in 1963 million, I find it still really surprising."
00:31:57,00:31:58,- Yeah. - That's happening.
00:31:58,00:32:00,"- America's big, isn't it?"
00:32:00,00:32:02,"But in 1910, this is the other thing"
00:32:02,00:32:03,that tractors changed.
00:32:03,00:32:07,One in three Americans worked on a farm.
00:32:07,00:32:08,- Wow. - One in three.
00:32:08,00:32:10,"By 2010, a century later,"
00:32:10,00:32:12,it was 2% of the workforce worked on a farm.
00:32:12,00:32:14,"- 1910, that's wild."
00:32:14,00:32:15,- It is.
00:32:15,00:32:16,"It's a massive shift over the last hundred years,"
00:32:16,00:32:18,"and the same will be true in lots of other countries,"
00:32:18,00:32:19,"obviously, you know."
00:32:19,00:32:21,- I'm surprised it's one in 50 now.
00:32:21,00:32:22,- Yeah.
00:32:22,00:32:24,- When you think how big cities are
00:32:24,00:32:26,and how much population lives in cities.
00:32:26,00:32:28,"- Yeah, get more tractors, lads."
00:32:28,00:32:30,Why is it all hand pulling these plows?
00:32:30,00:32:31,"- Well, that might be including people"
00:32:31,00:32:33,"who work on farm shops and things, I don't know."
00:32:33,00:32:35,"- Yeah, people who work in the Whole Foods"
00:32:35,00:32:37,probably can't serve them.
00:32:37,00:32:40,"- No doubt, that's technically agriculture, yeah."
00:32:40,00:32:41,"- You've got the Amish, of course,"
00:32:41,00:32:44,"who don't love using tractors,"
00:32:44,00:32:45,so they're doing a lot of it.
00:32:45,00:32:47,"You know, that probably takes quite a lot of labour."
00:32:47,00:32:50,"But I was looking into the Amish's use of tractors,"
00:32:50,00:32:54,"'cause you picture an Amish horse and cart, right?"
00:32:54,00:32:55,And you picture a horse drawn plow.
00:32:55,00:32:56,- So these are the people
00:32:56,00:32:58,who don't like to use any technology?
00:32:58,00:32:59,- Yes. - Are they in Pennsylvania?
00:32:59,00:33:00,- Yep. - Okay.
00:33:00,00:33:02,- So I--
00:33:02,00:33:05,"- Big shout out to our Amish listeners, we should say."
00:33:05,00:33:06,"- Yeah, I'm pro this."
00:33:06,00:33:07,So they don't use tractors.
00:33:07,00:33:09,- Do they use podcasts?
00:33:09,00:33:10,- I think there's quite a lot of variety
00:33:10,00:33:11,within the Amish community.
00:33:11,00:33:13,"And I think if you're at the quite technological end,"
00:33:13,00:33:15,you might be listening to a podcast right now.
00:33:15,00:33:16,"- Well, write in if you're Amish"
00:33:16,00:33:17,and you listen and tell us how.
00:33:17,00:33:19,"- Please do, write in with your quill."
00:33:19,00:33:22,(all laughing)
00:33:22,00:33:24,"- Just get us on TikTok, guys."
00:33:24,00:33:27,- But they don't use tractors
00:33:27,00:33:30,"just because they think it's a slippery slope to cars,"
00:33:30,00:33:31,basically.
00:33:31,00:33:33,"- Well, the ballast means it's not a slippery slope."
00:33:33,00:33:36,Maybe they haven't discovered the vegetable oil in which case.
00:33:36,00:33:38,So there's lots of Amish websites that say
00:33:38,00:33:39,you'll have a tractor on your farm
00:33:39,00:33:40,"and it'll run little errands,"
00:33:40,00:33:42,"it'll carry hay bales around,"
00:33:42,00:33:43,"it will fill up silo,"
00:33:43,00:33:45,but don't use it in the fields
00:33:45,00:33:46,'cause then you'll get a taste
00:33:46,00:33:48,for how good they are at driving.
00:33:48,00:33:50,And the next thing is you'll be on the roads.
00:33:50,00:33:53,And actually a lot of Amish people use the old tractors
00:33:53,00:33:55,with just the metal tires
00:33:55,00:33:57,because they really damage roads.
00:33:57,00:33:59,So that's to remove the temptation.
00:33:59,00:34:00,"So if you've just got metal,"
00:34:00,00:34:02,what are they called those spikes
00:34:02,00:34:05,that you have for proper traction on old metal tires?
00:34:05,00:34:05,- Winter tires.
00:34:05,00:34:07,"- Lugs, lugs."
00:34:07,00:34:10,Then you can't get onto a road 'cause you're ruining it.
00:34:10,00:34:12,So you're stuck in your field.
00:34:12,00:34:13,- Right.
00:34:13,00:34:14,"- Anyway, I thought, you know, that's interesting."
00:34:14,00:34:16,- That's certainly how I got into driving.
00:34:16,00:34:17,I started in a tractor
00:34:17,00:34:21,"and now I'm knee deep in Maserati's, that's a nightmare."
00:34:21,00:34:25,"- Well, that's the original Lamborghini was a tractor."
00:34:25,00:34:25,- Right.
00:34:25,00:34:30,- So Ferruccio Lamborghini founded his tractor company
00:34:30,00:34:32,way before he founded it as a car company.
00:34:32,00:34:34,- So he's slippery slope.
00:34:34,00:34:37,"- They still make them though 'cause on Clarkson's farm,"
00:34:37,00:34:38,he has a Lamborghini tractor.
00:34:38,00:34:38,- Yeah.
00:34:38,00:34:41,And he got really rich after selling a lot of them.
00:34:41,00:34:43,And so he started buying nice expensive cars
00:34:43,00:34:44,and he bought a Ferrari.
00:34:44,00:34:47,And he was really annoyed with how the clutch worked
00:34:47,00:34:48,in one of his Ferraris.
00:34:48,00:34:50,"And he was also really annoyed that when he pointed it out,"
00:34:50,00:34:52,the sales team were just really bad with him.
00:34:52,00:34:55,So he got into an argument with Enzo Ferrari
00:34:55,00:34:56,"and said, you need to make this better."
00:34:56,00:34:57,"And he said, go away."
00:34:57,00:34:59,"And so he went, I will, and I will invent my own car,"
00:34:59,00:35:00,which is better version of your car.
00:35:00,00:35:04,So the Lamborghini was built to spite the Ferrari.
00:35:04,00:35:06,"It's a proper rivalry, but it started with tractors."
00:35:06,00:35:10,"- I read a guy, there's a book called Lamborghini Supercar"
00:35:10,00:35:13,"Supreme, which was written by like a big historian"
00:35:13,00:35:14,of this time.
00:35:14,00:35:16,"And they think, even though Lamborghini said"
00:35:16,00:35:19,"that this is what happened, and even Ferrari said"
00:35:19,00:35:20,"this is what happened, they reckon it probably"
00:35:20,00:35:21,didn't happen.
00:35:21,00:35:23,And it was all marketing stuff that that's.
00:35:23,00:35:25,"- Well, I killed the joy of the story."
00:35:25,00:35:26,"- I know, sorry."
00:35:26,00:35:28,- We can accept that these two people might have
00:35:28,00:35:31,"raced down the story, but they've said it."
00:35:31,00:35:34,- And then they attached donuts to the exhaust pipe.
00:35:34,00:35:37,"Lamborghini, a lot of these people actually started"
00:35:37,00:35:39,because they were into car racing.
00:35:39,00:35:41,And Lamborghini was into car racing
00:35:41,00:35:43,for a very short amount of time.
00:35:43,00:35:47,He entered one of his early cars into the 1947
00:35:47,00:35:50,Mila Miglia road event.
00:35:50,00:35:51,"And two thirds of the way through the race,"
00:35:51,00:35:55,he crashed into a cafe and never raced again.
00:35:55,00:35:58,And apparently he crashed his car into the cafe.
00:35:58,00:36:01,And the cafe owner was like discombobulated.
00:36:01,00:36:03,"And he said, I'll have a glass of wine, please."
00:36:03,00:36:04,- Brilliant.
00:36:04,00:36:07,- To toast the end of my racing career.
00:36:07,00:36:09,"- And they didn't give him a glass of wine, did they?"
00:36:09,00:36:11,"- Well, it's a cafe, it depends on what time of day it was."
00:36:11,00:36:12,And what their license is.
00:36:12,00:36:14,"- Oh, if it's in Italy."
00:36:14,00:36:16,- You think even if someone's crashed their sort of
00:36:16,00:36:18,"tractor race car through the wall of your cafe,"
00:36:18,00:36:19,you're serving them wine?
00:36:19,00:36:21,- I think I would do that because then I'd be to the police.
00:36:21,00:36:22,"Look, he's been drinking."
00:36:22,00:36:25,(all laughing)
00:36:25,00:36:27,But I think all of these are kind of slightly
00:36:27,00:36:28,exaggerated stories.
00:36:28,00:36:31,- They're all worthy of the doughnut princess herself.
00:36:31,00:36:33,Can I talk about my tractor hero?
00:36:33,00:36:35,We've all got one.
00:36:35,00:36:37,"Robert William Thompson, he was a Scottish engineer."
00:36:37,00:36:40,He made the first mechanical road haulage vehicle.
00:36:40,00:36:42,It was a steam traction engine.
00:36:42,00:36:46,So he invented the pneumatic tire in the 1840s.
00:36:46,00:36:49,Really before there were decent roads for a pneumatic tire.
00:36:49,00:36:51,Also before there were cars.
00:36:51,00:36:53,"And in fact, really before there were bikes."
00:36:53,00:36:56,So he invented something that the world wasn't yet ready for.
00:36:56,00:36:56,- Right.
00:36:56,00:36:57,"- So, and he--"
00:36:57,00:36:59,- Running around with a steering wheel going.
00:36:59,00:37:00,I don't think I can do with this.
00:37:00,00:37:01,- It's gonna change the world.
00:37:01,00:37:05,"And he invented it, but there was a lack of demand,"
00:37:05,00:37:07,"as I've said, and the rubber was really expensive."
00:37:07,00:37:09,So he couldn't make it commercial.
00:37:09,00:37:11,And so he went off and invented the self-filling fountain pen
00:37:11,00:37:12,instead.
00:37:12,00:37:13,"- Oh, wow."
00:37:13,00:37:15,- It was such a great inventor and engineer.
00:37:15,00:37:17,And he had invented these tires and he tried them
00:37:17,00:37:18,in Regent's Park.
00:37:18,00:37:20,There was a big trial of two carriages next to each other.
00:37:20,00:37:22,"One with pneumatic tires, one without."
00:37:22,00:37:25,And the pneumatic tire one was much nicer to ride in
00:37:25,00:37:27,and much more smooth and comfortable.
00:37:27,00:37:29,"But yeah, there just wasn't the demand."
00:37:29,00:37:31,"- If you, like, let's say you know how to make cars,"
00:37:31,00:37:33,"which I certainly don't know how to do that,"
00:37:33,00:37:34,but a lot of people do.
00:37:34,00:37:37,"And you think, okay, well, I've also made a time travel machine."
00:37:37,00:37:39,So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go back to the time
00:37:39,00:37:42,"before cars, and I'm gonna make the first car."
00:37:42,00:37:45,"And I'm gonna be, you know, my kids will be billionaires."
00:37:45,00:37:48,"You can't go back too far, can you?"
00:37:48,00:37:49,You have to go back to the time
00:37:49,00:37:51,just before the first one was made.
00:37:51,00:37:53,"Because if you do go back too far, they don't have roads."
00:37:53,00:37:54,- You're right.
00:37:54,00:37:56,The conditions need to be in place.
00:37:56,00:37:57,"Otherwise, you'd then have to invent the road."
00:37:57,00:37:59,And you don't know how to invent the road.
00:37:59,00:38:00,- Look would have it.
00:38:00,00:38:01,You brought a fountain pen with you.
00:38:01,00:38:03,(laughing)
00:38:03,00:38:05,(upbeat music)
00:38:05,00:38:11,"- Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show."
00:38:11,00:38:13,That is Andy.
00:38:13,00:38:15,"My fact is that if civilization comes to an end,"
00:38:15,00:38:18,one of the best places to be is a cafe
00:38:18,00:38:20,"in Fort Mason, San Francisco."
00:38:20,00:38:21,- Mm-hmm.
00:38:21,00:38:21,- Is that so?
00:38:21,00:38:23,You got a good view of the poppers shagging.
00:38:23,00:38:26,You're gonna have to occupy yourself in the aftertimes.
00:38:26,00:38:29,That's gonna be one of the few things that is entertaining.
00:38:29,00:38:30,(laughing)
00:38:30,00:38:32,"No, this is quite a cool thing."
00:38:32,00:38:36,It's a library that's called the Manual for Civilization.
00:38:36,00:38:38,"And it's a collection of three and a half thousand books,"
00:38:38,00:38:41,"basically, which contain the operating instructions"
00:38:41,00:38:44,"for Earth, how you would start civilization again"
00:38:44,00:38:46,from scratch if you had to.
00:38:46,00:38:48,"And it's run by this organization called the Long Now,"
00:38:48,00:38:51,"who are, they're quite sort of eccentric,"
00:38:51,00:38:53,but they say we need to be focusing
00:38:53,00:38:55,"on the next 10,000 years, you know,"
00:38:55,00:38:56,"we've got problems with intermediate,"
00:38:56,00:38:59,but actually we've got to preserve civilization.
00:38:59,00:39:01,"- Yeah, yeah, I'm not gonna do my recycling"
00:39:01,00:39:03,"because what's gonna happen in 10,000 years?"
00:39:03,00:39:05,"- Yeah, exactly, exactly."
00:39:05,00:39:07,"So it was a phrase that was coined,"
00:39:07,00:39:10,"I think unknowingly by Brian Eno, the musician."
00:39:10,00:39:11,He was talking with Stuart Brand
00:39:11,00:39:14,and a few other guys who are the founders of the Long Now.
00:39:14,00:39:16,"And they were saying all the stuff about,"
00:39:16,00:39:17,"remember how back in the day,"
00:39:17,00:39:19,people used to talk about the year 2000
00:39:19,00:39:20,"and all the like, what's going on in the year two?"
00:39:20,00:39:21,And we don't do that.
00:39:21,00:39:23,We don't talk about the year 3000
00:39:23,00:39:24,in the way that they would talk about.
00:39:24,00:39:25,"- I think not much has changed,"
00:39:25,00:39:27,but we live under water.
00:39:27,00:39:28,(laughing)
00:39:28,00:39:31,I think philosophers have talked about this for years.
00:39:31,00:39:33,- That's a huge change as well.
00:39:33,00:39:35,The infrastructural changes.
00:39:35,00:39:37,How do you mean not much change?
00:39:37,00:39:39,(laughing)
00:39:39,00:39:43,How do trades work under water?
00:39:43,00:39:44,What are you saying?
00:39:44,00:39:47,"Okay, Buzz has been talking about it,"
00:39:47,00:39:49,but not many other people.
00:39:49,00:39:51,"But yeah, so like in the Long Now Foundation,"
00:39:51,00:39:54,"for example, we're not living in the year 2025,"
00:39:54,00:39:56,we're living in the year 2020-25.
00:39:56,00:39:59,"- I really like, it's quite teenage to do."
00:39:59,00:40:02,"They were founded in '09, 1996."
00:40:02,00:40:04,"- I mean, everything that I read about these guys,"
00:40:04,00:40:06,it does sound like teenagers
00:40:06,00:40:08,"who have just read a book for the first time go,"
00:40:08,00:40:10,"ah, but dude, what about this?"
00:40:10,00:40:11,"- Well, Stuart Brand, the founder,"
00:40:11,00:40:14,he's part of that old counterculture America.
00:40:14,00:40:16,He was part of LSD and all that.
00:40:16,00:40:18,He had these big hippie ideas of changing the world.
00:40:18,00:40:21,"And so he's, yeah, those little things,"
00:40:21,00:40:24,I think they were a bit sort of hippie-ish in their ideas.
00:40:24,00:40:25,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:40:25,00:40:27,"- I mean, there's a very good thing to be focusing on."
00:40:27,00:40:30,"Obviously, I mean, it's largely what responsible people"
00:40:30,00:40:31,"who look to the future do focus on,"
00:40:31,00:40:34,"but what I quite like is that this cafe,"
00:40:34,00:40:36,"which has the big library in it, doesn't it?"
00:40:36,00:40:38,"So the cafe is called The Interval,"
00:40:38,00:40:40,"and it was founded with such great ideals,"
00:40:40,00:40:42,"and it reminded me a little bit,"
00:40:42,00:40:43,"and I say this with complete fondness,"
00:40:43,00:40:47,of QI actually set up its own bar many years ago.
00:40:47,00:40:49,"And I'm sure many other people have done this,"
00:40:49,00:40:50,"thought I'm gonna set up a cafe,"
00:40:50,00:40:52,but the idea is that everyone's gonna have
00:40:52,00:40:54,amazing conversations.
00:40:54,00:40:56,So the idea of this cafe is everyone will be discussing
00:40:56,00:40:58,"topics relating to long-term thinking,"
00:40:58,00:41:00,"how to save the world in 10,000 years,"
00:41:00,00:41:02,"and you go to the TripAdvisor reviews,"
00:41:02,00:41:04,"and the only thing they say is,"
00:41:04,00:41:06,"""God, the cocktails are good."""
00:41:06,00:41:07,"- Oh, really?"
00:41:07,00:41:08,(laughing)
00:41:08,00:41:09,- And that was true of the QI club as well.
00:41:09,00:41:10,- Yeah.
00:41:10,00:41:11,- The cocktails were amazing.
00:41:11,00:41:14,I wanna just say on the record that I disagree.
00:41:14,00:41:15,I think we should be looking at the problems
00:41:15,00:41:17,"that are immediate and deal with those,"
00:41:17,00:41:19,"and I don't think we should be saying,"
00:41:19,00:41:21,"""Yeah, we don't need to save the purposes"
00:41:21,00:41:23,"""because we need to worry about what we're doing"
00:41:23,00:41:24,"""in 10,000 years."""
00:41:24,00:41:24,- I think that's a fair point.
00:41:24,00:41:26,"- It's just a lot easier to kick it down the road, I think."
00:41:26,00:41:29,"- Oh, I think to be fair, that is what they're about."
00:41:29,00:41:31,"I don't think that, I don't think they're saying,"
00:41:31,00:41:31,"let's forget about it,"
00:41:31,00:41:34,"they're looking to extend ourselves to 10,000 years."
00:41:34,00:41:35,- Yeah.
00:41:35,00:41:36,- You don't think so?
00:41:36,00:41:38,"- Well, it's hard to allocate your resources,"
00:41:38,00:41:41,"like the stuff that the world is losing now,"
00:41:41,00:41:42,"like biodiversity and things like that,"
00:41:42,00:41:44,"I think is a really, really immediate,"
00:41:44,00:41:45,impressive concern.
00:41:45,00:41:47,"And then you have to preserve it for a long time,"
00:41:47,00:41:49,"but sometimes like,"
00:41:49,00:41:50,"you have to put out the fire that's burning now,"
00:41:50,00:41:53,"rather than say, ""Hey, maybe this fire will spread, man."""
00:41:53,00:41:54,"- Yeah. - No, sorry,"
00:41:54,00:41:55,"that's not how it's done. - No, I'm just saying"
00:41:55,00:41:57,"that Stuart Brown, he created the Whole Earth Catalog."
00:41:57,00:41:58,- What is the Whole Earth Catalog?
00:41:58,00:41:59,"- It was an idea of going, where are we now?"
00:41:59,00:42:01,What do we need to look at?
00:42:01,00:42:02,How do we save things?
00:42:02,00:42:04,It's a big collaboration project.
00:42:04,00:42:05,"- Well, explain this, Dan."
00:42:05,00:42:07,"Why are they building a clock in a Texas mountain,"
00:42:07,00:42:09,"which will function for the next 10,000 years,"
00:42:09,00:42:11,and which you won't be able to visit?
00:42:11,00:42:14,"- Well, you mean the one that was conceived"
00:42:14,00:42:18,"by a millionaire funded by the world's richest man,"
00:42:18,00:42:21,and built in his private space pot inside his mountain?
00:42:21,00:42:21,- That's right.
00:42:21,00:42:24,"- Well, that does sound like it'll help us in the long term."
00:42:24,00:42:27,"- Okay, guys, when you put it like that,"
00:42:27,00:42:29,now I sound like a horrible man.
00:42:29,00:42:30,"- No, no, no, Jeff Bezos has funded it."
00:42:30,00:42:33,"It's simply called The Clock, and--"
00:42:33,00:42:35,- That's not what I call him.
00:42:35,00:42:38,(all laughing)
00:42:38,00:42:39,"- Yeah, and Brian Nino's involved in that, too."
00:42:39,00:42:41,"- Yeah, yeah, he's a founding member of--"
00:42:41,00:42:44,"- I think it like, ticks once a year or something, does it?"
00:42:44,00:42:45,I remember reading about it.
00:42:45,00:42:48,"Like, as in, instead of ticking once a second,"
00:42:48,00:42:49,"it ticks once a year,"
00:42:49,00:42:53,and the cuckoo comes out once every millennium or something.
00:42:53,00:42:54,"I think that was the original thing,"
00:42:54,00:42:56,"but for some reason they changed it,"
00:42:56,00:42:59,"and it plays a tone every 1,000 years instead of the cuckoo."
00:42:59,00:43:01,"But originally they were gonna go for the cuckoo,"
00:43:01,00:43:02,"probably because they thought,"
00:43:02,00:43:04,"well, the cuckoo have died out by then,"
00:43:04,00:43:06,and we don't give a fuck about that.
00:43:06,00:43:08,- They're not about saving stuff now.
00:43:08,00:43:11,"They are about whatever's in charge in 10,000 years, save that."
00:43:11,00:43:13,"- It's more about the idea,"
00:43:13,00:43:15,"is to change your manner of thinking,"
00:43:15,00:43:17,"not think about the modern day,"
00:43:17,00:43:19,"just about what's happening today and tomorrow,"
00:43:19,00:43:21,"but to think in the long term, that's their idea."
00:43:21,00:43:22,- Yeah. - Okay.
00:43:22,00:43:24,"Like, you know, go on a diet today,"
00:43:24,00:43:27,"and next week you'll feel better,"
00:43:27,00:43:28,rather than eat chocolate today.
00:43:28,00:43:29,"- Well, they would be more like,"
00:43:29,00:43:33,"well, maybe I should buy some really, really big clothes,"
00:43:33,00:43:35,"because I'm not gonna have a diet for a while,"
00:43:35,00:43:37,"but I know that in 20 years' time,"
00:43:37,00:43:39,I'm gonna be morbidly obese.
00:43:39,00:43:40,"- That's actually a really good,"
00:43:40,00:43:43,you should start marketing big clothes.
00:43:43,00:43:46,"- This library has 3,500 books, as mentioned."
00:43:46,00:43:48,"I found a list of some of the books that are in there,"
00:43:48,00:43:49,'cause they are interesting.
00:43:49,00:43:50,What are the books that are rebuilding?
00:43:50,00:43:52,- So please tell me that the princess's book is in there.
00:43:52,00:43:54,(laughing)
00:43:54,00:43:57,"- There's Dirt, The Erosion of Civilizations."
00:43:57,00:44:00,There's six Ian M. Bank novels.
00:44:00,00:44:01,"- They have quite a lot of sci-fi,"
00:44:01,00:44:03,as you might expect from some sci-fi thinkers.
00:44:03,00:44:05,"- But I was talking to a scientist the other day,"
00:44:05,00:44:08,who said that a lot of scientific ideas are inspired
00:44:08,00:44:10,by reading nothing but science fiction.
00:44:10,00:44:12,"So they are valuable things, I think."
00:44:12,00:44:14,"- Completely, but I think they haven't chosen"
00:44:14,00:44:15,all the books yet.
00:44:15,00:44:18,"As of the year '0, 2014,"
00:44:18,00:44:21,"they only had about 1,400 nominations for their library,"
00:44:21,00:44:23,and of those 200 were sci-fi.
00:44:23,00:44:26,"And I just think, if you need a book"
00:44:26,00:44:28,"on how to build a water wheel,"
00:44:28,00:44:30,and you've accidentally got all five Dune novels
00:44:30,00:44:33,"in your way, or Dune is in there."
00:44:33,00:44:35,- I know all sorts of courses in there.
00:44:35,00:44:36,- They will be useful for kindling.
00:44:36,00:44:38,"- Yeah, that's true."
00:44:38,00:44:41,- I wonder if they have The Buck.
00:44:41,00:44:43,"- Ooh, The Buck. - Have you guys heard of The Buck?"
00:44:43,00:44:44,- What's that?
00:44:44,00:44:45,- This was the third most successful
00:44:45,00:44:47,Kickstarter campaign of all time.
00:44:47,00:44:50,"It's a book that I own as well, I have one."
00:44:50,00:44:53,"It's 2.3 kilograms, so almost as heavy as Dan's testicles"
00:44:53,00:44:54,if he was a corpus.
00:44:54,00:44:58,And it was written by a group of escape room designers.
00:44:58,00:45:01,And the idea is this one book will help you
00:45:01,00:45:04,restart civilization if you have it.
00:45:04,00:45:06,"So on the first page, it tells you how to make string,"
00:45:06,00:45:08,"and how to start fire, and how to make wheels."
00:45:08,00:45:10,"And then it goes all the way to the last pages,"
00:45:10,00:45:12,"which tells you how to play football,"
00:45:12,00:45:15,"and how to make sex toys, and stuff like that."
00:45:15,00:45:17,"- Well, ironically, my testicles are the other thing"
00:45:17,00:45:19,you need to restart civilization.
00:45:19,00:45:20,So that's true.
00:45:20,00:45:22,- That book and my balls are the--
00:45:22,00:45:24,- The sex toy that they came up with
00:45:24,00:45:28,"was a five foot tall fountain, and you pour water into it."
00:45:28,00:45:30,"And as the water goes down, it creates a vacuum"
00:45:30,00:45:33,that makes a sucking action on a handy attachment
00:45:33,00:45:35,that you can attach to yourself.
00:45:35,00:45:36,- Do you need the fountain?
00:45:36,00:45:39,"I mean, is that the best way of creating that suction?"
00:45:39,00:45:41,With the technology you've got after reading the book?
00:45:41,00:45:43,"- Well, to be honest, they do tell you"
00:45:43,00:45:45,how to make electricity and stuff in the book.
00:45:45,00:45:48,"So I'm not sure why, 'cause this is right at the end,"
00:45:48,00:45:49,"they do this, but yeah."
00:45:49,00:45:51,"- They probably had a few pages left, and they thought,"
00:45:51,00:45:52,"well, we've got to fill up the book somehow."
00:45:52,00:45:53,"So we may as well, you know."
00:45:53,00:45:55,- It's a great book though.
00:45:55,00:45:57,- It does sound really interesting.
00:45:57,00:45:59,I know that it's not dealing with the immediate problems
00:45:59,00:46:00,facing the world.
00:46:00,00:46:02,I do find it quite interesting.
00:46:02,00:46:04,"- It is interesting, the idea of--"
00:46:04,00:46:06,"- It's fun to think about in 10,000 years."
00:46:06,00:46:08,"I mean, I don't know if you guys listened"
00:46:08,00:46:10,"to the 80,000 hours podcast, but--"
00:46:10,00:46:11,"- I've listened to the first hour, but yeah."
00:46:11,00:46:13,(laughing)
00:46:13,00:46:15,- They're always talking about the deep future
00:46:15,00:46:16,and what we do about it.
00:46:16,00:46:18,And there was one I listened to recently
00:46:18,00:46:19,"where they interviewed Paul Cristiano,"
00:46:19,00:46:22,"who's a AI researcher who thinks about,"
00:46:22,00:46:26,"how should we leave a message to, let's say, lizard people"
00:46:26,00:46:29,"if they're the only ones who have survived in 20,000 years?"
00:46:29,00:46:32,"Sweetly, the first thing that happened in the interview"
00:46:32,00:46:34,"was he said, let's say lizards are what have survived."
00:46:34,00:46:35,How can we leave a message for them
00:46:35,00:46:38,"once they've evolved to say, don't do this, do that?"
00:46:38,00:46:41,"And Rob Wiblin, who's the host, said,"
00:46:41,00:46:43,"I must interrupt now, 'cause apparently"
00:46:43,00:46:45,there's some insane conspiracy theory
00:46:45,00:46:46,"that I've never really heard about,"
00:46:46,00:46:48,about lizard people running the world.
00:46:48,00:46:50,"And I just want to be clear, and I was like--"
00:46:50,00:46:51,"- Yeah, they're already here, mate."
00:46:51,00:46:52,What's he talking about?
00:46:52,00:46:53,"- Yeah, we're there."
00:46:53,00:46:54,- Is that King Charles?
00:46:54,00:46:56,"- I did feel like you guys are so well-informed,"
00:46:56,00:46:57,but you don't know the right stuff.
00:46:57,00:46:59,You don't know about the crazy lizard conspiracy theory.
00:46:59,00:47:00,- Many of the doughnut royal family
00:47:00,00:47:02,are actually lizards themselves.
00:47:02,00:47:04,(laughing)
00:47:04,00:47:06,"But anyway, his solution, which I quite liked was,"
00:47:06,00:47:08,you need to draw attention to a spot in Earth
00:47:08,00:47:11,"where we can leave a message saying,"
00:47:11,00:47:13,"don't create nuclear weapons,"
00:47:13,00:47:15,or whatever it is we want to say.
00:47:15,00:47:17,"And Paul Cristiano's suggestion was,"
00:47:17,00:47:19,there's this massive magnetic anomaly in Russia.
00:47:19,00:47:21,So if we're talking tens of thousands of years
00:47:21,00:47:24,"in the future, anything that you carve on a rock"
00:47:24,00:47:26,or a big structure you make will have descended
00:47:26,00:47:28,"into the Earth, or tectonic plates will have moved."
00:47:28,00:47:30,But magnetism doesn't really change.
00:47:30,00:47:33,"And there's this amazing thing called the Kursk anomaly,"
00:47:33,00:47:35,"I think it's called, and it's in Russia."
00:47:35,00:47:37,"And if you go there, your compass goes totally mad."
00:47:37,00:47:39,The magnetism is insane.
00:47:39,00:47:41,And it's riddled with iron deposits.
00:47:41,00:47:43,"And he was like, it's really easy to find"
00:47:43,00:47:44,quite early on in civilization
00:47:44,00:47:46,once you've worked out magnetism.
00:47:46,00:47:48,"Go there and then we can encode loads of,"
00:47:48,00:47:49,just draw loads of maps there.
00:47:49,00:47:51,- Right.
00:47:51,00:47:52,- Leave them that message.
00:47:52,00:47:55,- Have we checked that magnetic anomaly
00:47:55,00:47:57,for messages from previous civilizations?
00:47:57,00:47:58,- What a good point.
00:47:58,00:47:59,"- Yes, we actually have,"
00:47:59,00:48:01,"I've got a book called ""Ancient Aliens."""
00:48:01,00:48:02,(laughing)
00:48:02,00:48:04,I think it's kind of interesting.
00:48:04,00:48:07,"Like, let's say humans die out,"
00:48:07,00:48:11,"as is probably likely over a long period, right?"
00:48:11,00:48:13,But then some other animals don't die out.
00:48:13,00:48:15,Then what will the next big species be?
00:48:15,00:48:17,"Like the lizards, obviously,"
00:48:17,00:48:20,"they've had their go with dinosaurs really, arguably, right?"
00:48:20,00:48:21,- Is it a turn-based system?
00:48:21,00:48:23,"- It's turn-based, so we've had lizards,"
00:48:23,00:48:24,so we've had a mammal.
00:48:24,00:48:25,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:48:25,00:48:28,So one idea is octopuses.
00:48:28,00:48:30,"- Okay, I would happily give it to them."
00:48:30,00:48:33,"- Yeah, so like, let's say there's a big problem on earth,"
00:48:33,00:48:37,"on land-based earth that we've probably caused,"
00:48:37,00:48:39,"then maybe at the bottom of the sea, they'll be okay."
00:48:39,00:48:41,And the idea is that they would probably
00:48:41,00:48:44,"go straight to renewable energy,"
00:48:44,00:48:46,"'cause they can't really burn coal down there,"
00:48:46,00:48:47,'cause they're underwater.
00:48:47,00:48:51,"But what they do have is tidal power and hydrothermal,"
00:48:51,00:48:53,so heat coming from the bottom of the ocean.
00:48:53,00:48:54,- Great.
00:48:54,00:48:55,- So they will be able to go straight in
00:48:55,00:48:58,"at the, you know, the Tesla stage."
00:48:58,00:49:00,"- That's really, that's quite a comforting thought, actually."
00:49:00,00:49:02,- Work octopuses.
00:49:02,00:49:04,"- Oh, God."
00:49:04,00:49:06,"Oh, you'll be one of the right-wing octopus journalists."
00:49:06,00:49:09,"Oh, what's wrong with getting off out of Calvary?"
00:49:09,00:49:12,"- That's the missing lyric from the Bust-It-Sog, isn't it?"
00:49:12,00:49:14,"Not much has changed, except we are now ruled"
00:49:14,00:49:16,by our octopus overlords.
00:49:16,00:49:19,"You've got to cut a verse, lads."
00:49:19,00:49:21,This is really an important verse.
00:49:21,00:49:23,"No, cut it."
00:49:23,00:49:25,It doesn't play well with the 18 to 24 market.
00:49:25,00:49:27,Cut the octopus verse.
00:49:27,00:49:30,"Okay, let's say we're going to the stars, then."
00:49:30,00:49:33,"You need a crew mission which takes dozens of generations, right?"
00:49:33,00:49:36,How many people do you need on your spaceship?
00:49:36,00:49:38,"- See, like, I kind of want to go on my own."
00:49:38,00:49:39,- Okay.
00:49:39,00:49:41,- I'm not sure I could last the journey.
00:49:41,00:49:43,- That's the octopus mindset.
00:49:43,00:49:45,You're going to love the anti-social octopus age.
00:49:45,00:49:47,- Talking to other people?
00:49:47,00:49:49,"- Well, yeah, for like tens of thousands of years."
00:49:49,00:49:52,"- Well, you'll die at some point, which is the consolation."
00:49:52,00:49:56,"- Probably quite early, given what my crewmates will think."
00:49:56,00:49:59,"James, can you, you just pop in the airlock and again,"
00:49:59,00:50:02,"I've dropped a contact lens, I just want to know if we find it."
00:50:02,00:50:05,"No, so basically, the mission lasts many generations."
00:50:05,00:50:07,"Sorry, that's the thing I missed out."
00:50:07,00:50:07,- I see.
00:50:07,00:50:09,- It's going to take centuries and centuries and centuries
00:50:09,00:50:11,"to get to the planet that we've picked, as I knew her."
00:50:11,00:50:13,"- So, it's the question, Andy, sorry to interrupt."
00:50:13,00:50:16,"It's the question, how many people do we need"
00:50:16,00:50:17,so that we don't die out from imbreding?
00:50:17,00:50:18,- Bingo.
00:50:18,00:50:19,- Right.
00:50:19,00:50:20,- Okay.
00:50:20,00:50:21,"- Bingo, yeah."
00:50:21,00:50:22,- Okay.
00:50:22,00:50:22,- Like four?
00:50:22,00:50:24,"I mean, if you have a child with your cousin,"
00:50:24,00:50:26,it's basically fine.
00:50:26,00:50:28,"- Yes, they will have children at some point, though,"
00:50:28,00:50:29,won't they Anna?
00:50:29,00:50:30,You've not thought this through.
00:50:30,00:50:33,"- It's exactly, that's like, that's okay for one generation."
00:50:33,00:50:34,- Yeah.
00:50:34,00:50:35,- And then it gets progressively worse.
00:50:35,00:50:36,- Yes.
00:50:36,00:50:38,- You've got the ancient Egyptians will tell you.
00:50:38,00:50:40,"- You've got to go for 6,000 years."
00:50:40,00:50:42,"- See, I'm a short-term thinker."
00:50:42,00:50:42,- Absolutely.
00:50:42,00:50:43,- I've got you up all along now.
00:50:43,00:50:44,- You're not one.
00:50:44,00:50:45,- I'm going to go around a hundred.
00:50:45,00:50:46,- Mm-hmm.
00:50:46,00:50:50,"- Um, two, just me and my sister."
00:50:50,00:50:51,- And bud.
00:50:51,00:50:53,(laughing)
00:50:53,00:50:54,- It's going to be incest at some point.
00:50:54,00:50:56,"You might as well get it over with, don't we?"
00:50:56,00:50:57,- Let's nip it in the bud.
00:50:57,00:50:58,- Let's.
00:50:58,00:51:00,(laughing)
00:51:00,00:51:02,"- One of you is right, and it's obviously James."
00:51:02,00:51:05,(laughing)
00:51:05,00:51:06,- Who's it?
00:51:06,00:51:07,(laughing)
00:51:07,00:51:09,- This is the easiest game show ever
00:51:09,00:51:11,when you're up against two idiots.
00:51:11,00:51:13,(laughing)
00:51:13,00:51:16,"- Send me and Dan somewhere else, honestly."
00:51:16,00:51:17,Make sure we're not on a ship.
00:51:17,00:51:18,- I don't think we're sending you
00:51:18,00:51:19,to one of the good planets.
00:51:19,00:51:21,(laughing)
00:51:21,00:51:24,Anna and Dan's weird incest mission.
00:51:24,00:51:25,You're not going to get a plum posting.
00:51:25,00:51:28,(laughing)
00:51:28,00:51:30,(upbeat music)
00:51:30,00:51:33,"- Okay, that's it."
00:51:33,00:51:34,That's all of our facts.
00:51:34,00:51:36,Thank you so much for listening.
