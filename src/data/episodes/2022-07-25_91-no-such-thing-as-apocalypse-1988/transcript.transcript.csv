00:00:00,00:00:09,"""It's time to get out of here."""
00:00:09,00:00:17,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming"
00:00:17,00:00:19,to you from the QI offices in Covern Garden.
00:00:19,00:00:20,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:20,00:00:24,"I'm sitting here with Ann Miller, James Harkin, and Anitzo Zinski."
00:00:24,00:00:28,And once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the
00:00:28,00:00:32,"last seven days and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:32,00:00:34,"Starting with you, James Harkin."
00:00:34,00:00:41,"Okay, my fact this week is that the very hungry caterpillar was originally called a"
00:00:41,00:00:43,week with Willie The Worm.
00:00:43,00:00:46,"That's quite a different book, that sounds like."
00:00:46,00:00:49,"Yeah, how similar was it to this story about a caterpillar?"
00:00:49,00:00:52,"Oh, well, it was a different ending, but it was a similar--"
00:00:52,00:00:53,Didn't Worm didn't turn into a butterfly?
00:00:53,00:00:56,"No, the worm didn't turn into a butterfly."
00:00:56,00:01:01,"The book wasn't written by a guy called Eric Karl, and he was inspired by a whole punch."
00:01:01,00:01:05,"He noticed that the hole was going through some paper, and he thought, ""What if I turn"
00:01:05,00:01:06,"this into a book?"""
00:01:06,00:01:11,"And so he thought, ""Well, I could do a bookworm that goes through the holes."""
00:01:11,00:01:13,So that's why it was called Willie The Bookworm.
00:01:13,00:01:16,"And then I think it was his publisher, came up to him and said, ""Well, why don't you change"
00:01:16,00:01:19,"it instead of a worm into a caterpillar?"""
00:01:19,00:01:23,"And he thought, ""Ah-ha, caterpillars turn into butterflies, spoiler alert."
00:01:23,00:01:25,"I could do that at the end of my book."""
00:01:25,00:01:26,Okay.
00:01:26,00:01:31,"""Do we know, was it going to be like Monday, what if the worm goes to the shops, Tuesday,"
00:01:31,00:01:32,"stays in bed all day?"""
00:01:32,00:01:33,"It just seems like, I don't know why."
00:01:33,00:01:34,He spends a week with Willie The Worm.
00:01:34,00:01:37,This is the worst Craig David song of the world.
00:01:37,00:01:40,There are some quite traumatising children's books out there.
00:01:40,00:01:43,"There's one that's like about the journey of a sperm, which is really popular at the"
00:01:43,00:01:44,moment.
00:01:44,00:01:45,I don't know what a sperm is.
00:01:45,00:01:46,It's a cold where Willie went.
00:01:46,00:01:48,"I think it is, which is actually very misleading, calling it Willie."
00:01:48,00:01:51,"I think that is going to confuse a lot of children, I don't know."
00:01:51,00:01:56,"I saw a picture of that book where Willie went, it's called ""The Big Story of a Little"
00:01:56,00:01:57,"Sperm""."
00:01:57,00:02:01,"And on the front cover it says, ""The best story of its sort, the Daily Mail."""
00:02:01,00:02:02,"So it's like, ""Oh wow."""
00:02:02,00:02:05,"""This is the best children's book about sperm."""
00:02:05,00:02:06,In the genre.
00:02:06,00:02:07,That is out there.
00:02:07,00:02:08,Children's Bermbecks.
00:02:08,00:02:11,Last year's best-selling UK child's author.
00:02:11,00:02:12,Dear Williams?
00:02:12,00:02:13,Yeah.
00:02:13,00:02:14,Yeah.
00:02:14,00:02:16,He made seven million last year of book sales.
00:02:16,00:02:17,Seven million pounds.
00:02:17,00:02:18,Yes.
00:02:18,00:02:22,He needs to get out of the podcasting game and into the children's books game.
00:02:22,00:02:23,I know.
00:02:23,00:02:24,Yeah.
00:02:24,00:02:27,"So his books get something like 600,000 sales each, like these got about eight books."
00:02:27,00:02:28,It's ridiculous.
00:02:28,00:02:30,So I didn't look into books because I'm bored of them.
00:02:30,00:02:31,I don't read.
00:02:31,00:02:32,Hell enough of it.
00:02:32,00:02:33,I just looked at worms.
00:02:33,00:02:34,Oh yeah.
00:02:34,00:02:35,Anyone else interested in worms?
00:02:35,00:02:36,"Yeah, definitely."
00:02:36,00:02:38,So have you ever tried worm fiddling?
00:02:38,00:02:39,No.
00:02:39,00:02:40,What's that?
00:02:40,00:02:41,Or worm charming.
00:02:41,00:02:44,"Or worm charming, worm fiddling and worm grunting are all very similar."
00:02:44,00:02:48,"So worms, I don't think we know why, but when you create vibrations in the ground then worms"
00:02:48,00:02:52,"come up to the surface and so the way you worm fiddle or you worm grunt, which is like getting"
00:02:52,00:02:56,"worms up to the surface, is by making vibrations in the ground."
00:02:56,00:03:00,"And they think it might be because molds when they're coming to attack worms, they borrow"
00:03:00,00:03:03,"towards them, make vibrations so they come up."
00:03:03,00:03:07,Another theory is that they think it's rain coming down and so they're going out so that
00:03:07,00:03:08,they don't drown.
00:03:08,00:03:09,Yeah.
00:03:09,00:03:12,"We think on the other end, whenever a tractor like plows a field, that's the vibration."
00:03:12,00:03:13,So the worms get exposed.
00:03:13,00:03:15,But then they get eaten by all those birds that are always following.
00:03:15,00:03:16,Exactly.
00:03:16,00:03:17,And the birds are extremely good at it.
00:03:17,00:03:20,"And the big old dance that you often see them doing, where they bounce around on the"
00:03:20,00:03:23,"floor a little bit, gets to get the worms to come up."
00:03:23,00:03:27,"But so worm grunting, charming fiddling, whatever, is kind of a competitive sport."
00:03:27,00:03:34,"And the person who holds the record for it is a 10-year-old girl who set it in 2009 in Chesha,"
00:03:34,00:03:37,and she brought up 567 worms out of the ground.
00:03:37,00:03:38,That's so cool.
00:03:38,00:03:39,That's so cool.
00:03:39,00:03:40,In this little portion of land.
00:03:40,00:03:45,"There was one, yeah, I think it was like two or three years ago at the worm charming"
00:03:45,00:03:49,worm. No one got a single worm in the entire group of charmers.
00:03:49,00:03:50,Wow.
00:03:50,00:03:53,"Well, maybe that's why they've got more imaginative in how to get them up."
00:03:53,00:03:58,"Apparently, in the competition that this girl won, techniques to get the worms up included"
00:03:58,00:04:02,"a man who strummed rock tunes on his guitar, a woman who tapped dance to the theme from Star Wars"
00:04:02,00:04:06,"and a man who played the xylophones with bottles, none of whom actually won, but it does sound"
00:04:06,00:04:07,like a really entertaining event.
00:04:07,00:04:09,And what did she do again?
00:04:09,00:04:13,She just did the common ways you tap the ground with cinema.
00:04:13,00:04:14,So she just went classic on it?
00:04:14,00:04:17,She went classic.
00:04:17,00:04:20,I had a wee look at Eric Carl's website and his frequently asked questions.
00:04:20,00:04:21,I don't know.
00:04:21,00:04:25,I guess one of his frequently asked questions about the hungry caterpillar is?
00:04:25,00:04:27,The one problem with the hungry caterpillar?
00:04:27,00:04:30,"It's that it comes out of a cocoon, not a chrysalis."
00:04:30,00:04:31,Okay.
00:04:31,00:04:35,"So usually butterflies come from chrysalis, but there is one called the pinesian that comes"
00:04:35,00:04:36,in a cocoon.
00:04:36,00:04:37,So the one's quibbling.
00:04:37,00:04:38,"That was a good, good point."
00:04:38,00:04:39,Okay.
00:04:39,00:04:40,"A good, good point."
00:04:40,00:04:45,So he's technically looked to how he could live in Siberia.
00:04:45,00:04:48,I based it on a Siberian caterpillar.
00:04:48,00:04:52,"But he also says, and here's my unscientific explanation."
00:04:52,00:04:54,My caterpillar is very unusual.
00:04:54,00:04:57,"Caterpillars don't eat lollipops and ice cream, so you won't find my caterpillar in any"
00:04:57,00:04:58,field guides.
00:04:58,00:04:59,Right.
00:04:59,00:05:00,"Fock top, right?"
00:05:00,00:05:01,Yeah.
00:05:01,00:05:02,I fucked up.
00:05:02,00:05:03,I should have said that.
00:05:03,00:05:04,I said this.
00:05:04,00:05:05,Just leave it.
00:05:05,00:05:18,Yeah.
00:05:18,00:05:19,He's so angry.
00:05:19,00:05:21,"He's an ash, he's an ash, he's an ash, a national treasure, but love by children."
00:05:21,00:05:22,"Yeah, but he's got a curve of language."
00:05:22,00:05:26,"It's not appropriate for an FAQ, and you're on the website."
00:05:26,00:05:30,Can I just quickly tell you about one really terrifying worm?
00:05:30,00:05:34,I know I keep one trying to rebound this conversation back to worms.
00:05:34,00:05:39,"But there is this worm, the bobbet worm, which lives on the bottom of the ocean."
00:05:39,00:05:42,"Oh, is he named after Lorraine a bobbet?"
00:05:42,00:05:43,I don't know who that is.
00:05:43,00:05:46,Is it John Wayne bobbet?
00:05:46,00:05:48,"Yeah, so Lorraine a bobbet was John Wayne bobbet's wife."
00:05:48,00:05:49,Yeah.
00:05:49,00:05:50,Who chops off his penis.
00:05:50,00:05:51,Yeah.
00:05:51,00:05:52,That makes sense.
00:05:52,00:05:53,Maybe he's named off into compensated penis.
00:05:53,00:05:55,Was it by any chance a 10 foot long penis?
00:05:55,00:05:56,Wow.
00:05:56,00:05:58,Not by the time she cut it off.
00:05:58,00:05:59,It is 10 foot long.
00:05:59,00:06:04,"It lives on the bottom of the ocean, and it lives under the sand at the bottom of"
00:06:04,00:06:05,the ocean.
00:06:05,00:06:09,"And then when pre comes past, it pops up and snaps its jaws down so fast that it can cut"
00:06:09,00:06:10,fish straight in half.
00:06:10,00:06:11,Wow.
00:06:11,00:06:12,And then it sucks them.
00:06:12,00:06:14,"So if you're cut in half, you're dead already, which is good for you."
00:06:14,00:06:18,"And if you're not, it sucks you down into the sand, understand, and eat you."
00:06:18,00:06:22,I just think a 10 foot long worm that can cut fish in half is pretty cool worm.
00:06:22,00:06:25,"I have a more scary worm than that, even, I think."
00:06:25,00:06:26,"Oh, yeah."
00:06:26,00:06:31,This is a colonoscopy performing robot that moves through your body in the same way
00:06:31,00:06:33,that an earthworm moves.
00:06:33,00:06:36,"As in, they've actually made the movement of it to mimic it."
00:06:36,00:06:37,To mimic an earthworm.
00:06:37,00:06:38,Wow.
00:06:38,00:06:39,That was quite scary.
00:06:39,00:06:41,Is there any reason they're sending robots into my body?
00:06:41,00:06:42,"Oh, yeah."
00:06:42,00:06:43,To medical purposes.
00:06:43,00:06:44,Yeah.
00:06:44,00:06:45,And some is products.
00:06:45,00:06:47,And the 10 foot run.
00:06:47,00:06:48,Yeah.
00:06:48,00:06:49,We'll make it.
00:06:49,00:06:50,Yeah.
00:06:50,00:06:51,I like this.
00:06:51,00:06:54,"I clicked on the Mongolian death worm, which I think we've just guessed before."
00:06:54,00:06:55,We have.
00:06:55,00:06:56,"By the way, interesting facts."
00:06:56,00:06:57,I was going to mention it.
00:06:57,00:07:01,But Andy has banned me from ever talking about the Mongolian death worm.
00:07:01,00:07:02,Here's your chance.
00:07:02,00:07:03,He's not here.
00:07:03,00:07:07,"Sometimes, for listeners who haven't heard it, it's a worm from Mongolia that shoots lightning"
00:07:07,00:07:09,bolts out of its anus.
00:07:09,00:07:14,"Disgusting creature that fires lightning out of its anus, Andy Murray will be back next"
00:07:14,00:07:15,week.
00:07:15,00:07:17,Yeah.
00:07:17,00:07:18,"We should move on soon, anyway."
00:07:18,00:07:19,"Oh, should we?"
00:07:19,00:07:20,OK.
00:07:20,00:07:21,We can do more worms.
00:07:21,00:07:23,I've got a few more kid book things.
00:07:23,00:07:29,"One is, one's a question, which is J.K. Rowling has said that she regrets killing one"
00:07:29,00:07:30,character from Harry Potter.
00:07:30,00:07:32,I want to see if anyone can guess.
00:07:32,00:07:34,Is it Harry Potter?
00:07:34,00:07:35,Does he die?
00:07:35,00:07:36,James.
00:07:36,00:07:40,"It's, so I can't answer that for spoiler alert reasons."
00:07:40,00:07:43,"And I actually didn't write down his name, but he's a random ice cream man, right?"
00:07:43,00:07:44,Florian Fortescue.
00:07:44,00:07:45,Right.
00:07:45,00:07:49,"So yeah, it's just a total random character, but it's because it was a senseless killing."
00:07:49,00:07:52,She didn't bring it back into the story in any way.
00:07:52,00:07:54,She didn't justify the killing for any reason.
00:07:54,00:07:55,She just had him killed.
00:07:55,00:07:57,She was just having a bad day.
00:07:57,00:08:00,"So I'm going to run into her website saying, your wizards aren't actually technically"
00:08:00,00:08:01,wizards.
00:08:01,00:08:03,I just lost it.
00:08:03,00:08:08,"OK, time for fact number two, and that is end."
00:08:08,00:08:13,"My fact is that in World War II, the 20 committee was in charge of turning German spies and"
00:08:13,00:08:17,"Roman numerals that made them the XX committee or the Double Cross committee, which basically"
00:08:17,00:08:18,means a peak wartime.
00:08:18,00:08:20,"Someone thought, you know what's good here?"
00:08:20,00:08:21,A pun.
00:08:21,00:08:22,Yeah.
00:08:22,00:08:23,Did they do it on purpose then?
00:08:23,00:08:24,I'm not.
00:08:24,00:08:25,So I heard this.
00:08:25,00:08:27,"I went to Black Tea Park the other week and I got told it on the walking tour, which"
00:08:27,00:08:30,"was brilliant, but I have read recently that they were Double Cross first and then"
00:08:30,00:08:32,until it's 20 after.
00:08:32,00:08:36,"So either way, it's the Double Cross pun and then 24 making it less obvious, but it was hiding"
00:08:36,00:08:37,in plain sight.
00:08:37,00:08:38,And is there a one to 19?
00:08:38,00:08:39,I don't know.
00:08:39,00:08:40,I think it just was 20.
00:08:40,00:08:41,When someone said that was.
00:08:41,00:08:42,I don't know about ones 19 actually.
00:08:42,00:08:43,I think.
00:08:43,00:08:44,I don't know.
00:08:44,00:08:48,"Well, I know the guy who oversaw it was this guy called Tar Roberts, who was the MI5 agent"
00:08:48,00:08:49,who overlooked it.
00:08:49,00:08:54,And he would have done it on purpose because so wartime rules dictated that spy code
00:08:54,00:08:58,names couldn't have a hint of the person's actual identity in them.
00:08:58,00:09:02,And he disregarded these rules completely and made his own rule that every single spy name
00:09:02,00:09:06,had to be a pun hint as to his actual name or a joke.
00:09:06,00:09:07,Amazing.
00:09:07,00:09:08,What was he called?
00:09:08,00:09:09,"He was called Tar Robertson, actually."
00:09:09,00:09:10,And I didn't think he gave himself.
00:09:10,00:09:15,"I think he gave himself a perfectly like impossible to uncover name, but so it was like"
00:09:15,00:09:21,Dusko Popov was his second in command and he called him Scoot because he popped off.
00:09:21,00:09:22,Popov.
00:09:22,00:09:23,Nice.
00:09:23,00:09:25,Although he then later changed his code name to Tricycle because he was known for having
00:09:25,00:09:26,three sons.
00:09:26,00:09:27,I have Tricycle.
00:09:27,00:09:31,"I have Arthur Owens, one of the first agents they turned on this and his code name was Snow,"
00:09:31,00:09:33,which is most letters of his surname.
00:09:33,00:09:34,Yes.
00:09:34,00:09:35,Yeah.
00:09:35,00:09:38,But he was great because he was one of the first to work for this committee and he was very
00:09:38,00:09:42,"useful because the Abwehr, the Germans used him as their meeting great for new agents arriving"
00:09:42,00:09:43,in Britain.
00:09:43,00:09:44,Everyone that came in just by for them went through him.
00:09:44,00:09:48,"He was a reporter to MI5, so he could just let them know what was going on."
00:09:48,00:09:52,"So just to give this a bit more context, this is World War II, bletchley Park, it's set up."
00:09:52,00:09:57,They were trying to sort of get a lot of tricks over on the Germans and a lot of
00:09:57,00:10:01,German agents were coming into Britain and immediately are they being caught or giving themselves
00:10:01,00:10:06,up and then acting as double agents back to Germany or sending messages back and it was
00:10:06,00:10:07,a huge part of the war.
00:10:07,00:10:13,"I mean, it led to some of the biggest moments in the war like the D-Day, the D-Day justified"
00:10:13,00:10:14,it.
00:10:14,00:10:18,I have read one really good book extract which is basically saying this was this ridiculous
00:10:18,00:10:22,"side show with these idiots playing spy games for the whole war, mostly pointless and"
00:10:22,00:10:26,the only reason we now look back on them with this like air of God they saved us because
00:10:26,00:10:27,of D-Day.
00:10:27,00:10:31,Like there was one instance where we tried to persuade the Germans that we were going
00:10:31,00:10:36,to be attacking the French coast at a certain place and so we sent out all these secret radio
00:10:36,00:10:39,signals hoping they picked them up and stuff and they'd get all their troops there and
00:10:39,00:10:43,then we sent some dummy boats out to warn the French coast so it seemed like we were going
00:10:43,00:10:47,to attack and they hadn't picked up on any of these things we planted in their radio waves
00:10:47,00:10:52,so we just spent ridiculous amounts of money and effort on absolutely nothing.
00:10:52,00:10:58,One of my favourite double agents was a guy who was a codename Garbo so he was a guy who
00:10:58,00:11:01,"called Pujaro Garcia from Barcelona, he was anti-communist and he did not say he wanted"
00:11:01,00:11:04,to work for the British but he thought he'd be more helpful if he was already a German spy
00:11:04,00:11:08,so he got himself recruited by telling them he had a visa and was going to England anyway
00:11:08,00:11:11,didn't have the visa so he was spent his all his time in Lisbon library making up stuff
00:11:11,00:11:16,for his spy network and research lines including things like there are in Glasgow men who
00:11:16,00:11:19,will do anything for a liter of wine and the reports were so accurate.
00:11:19,00:11:24,That was a lie was it. His impression from Lisbon of what life in Britain was like but his
00:11:24,00:11:27,reports were so accurate and my five got really worried and started hunting for this mole
00:11:27,00:11:31,in the UK because a lot of stuff was getting out he was just making it all up and then in
00:11:31,00:11:34,the end he managed to get recruited by Britain and came over here to spy told the Germans
00:11:34,00:11:37,he had 24 spies as big network and because it was backed up by the British whenever he
00:11:37,00:11:41,that killed someone off they put their obituary in the paper so it would look legit to the
00:11:41,00:11:45,Germans. On D-Day he was telling his colleagues to stand by for an important message to
00:11:45,00:11:49,distract them from what was actually happening and they never found out when he got
00:11:49,00:11:52,honours after the war for his efforts by the Germans.
00:11:52,00:11:56,I didn't know that thing about all the names had to be a slight pun and I've got a big list
00:11:56,00:12:00,of names of some of the spies and is it all falling into place now.
00:12:00,00:12:04,Slightly I mean you got to sort of know what they did like I don't know what biscuit did.
00:12:04,00:12:05,Eight last nights.
00:12:05,00:12:10,I can presume what the spy careless did got fired.
00:12:10,00:12:13,Yeah. Freak. Not sure what he did.
00:12:13,00:12:14,Gander.
00:12:14,00:12:18,Oh Gander I can tell you Gander. Gander was just cut goose.
00:12:18,00:12:22,Which I would have been so annoyed if I was cut goose and my boss said I'm going to give
00:12:22,00:12:23,you the codename gander.
00:12:23,00:12:28,I think I'd be saying do you mind giving me a slightly less obvious codename.
00:12:28,00:12:31,How about this one? Sniper.
00:12:31,00:12:36,I wonder if the idea is because like in those days there would have been a stereotype that
00:12:36,00:12:40,Germans don't have a sense of humour probably and they felt by doing puns they'll never
00:12:40,00:12:42,get these puns because Germans don't have a sense of humour.
00:12:42,00:12:46,I bet they had that chat in my five HQ.
00:12:46,00:12:50,I'm going to guess that one's hair base.
00:12:50,00:12:56,Well the word mullet about hair only dates back to the 1980s that was the earliest anyone's
00:12:56,00:13:01,ever found it is in a song by the beastie boys and no one's ever found an earlier use of
00:13:01,00:13:02,the word mullet.
00:13:02,00:13:04,So beastie boys technically coined mullet.
00:13:04,00:13:06,Yeah actually it might even be 90s.
00:13:06,00:13:13,So the first Germans boys who came over were ill-peared right they couldn't speak any
00:13:13,00:13:16,"English, a lot of them, or spoke really bad English."
00:13:16,00:13:20,So the extent that M.I.5 thought they were joking thought they were lying used to interrogate
00:13:20,00:13:24,"them and say obviously, you know, Germany wouldn't be stupid now, so despite who could"
00:13:24,00:13:25,not speak any English.
00:13:25,00:13:27,But yeah isn't that bizarre?
00:13:27,00:13:28,Yeah.
00:13:28,00:13:31,So with Bletchley when they set this up the way that they started recruiting people was
00:13:31,00:13:35,through a crossword that they put out on the papers and they set a challenge saying
00:13:35,00:13:39,if people think that they can do a crossword within 12 minutes come and take this challenge
00:13:39,00:13:43,so people came and they did the challenge and after they won they would then re-contact
00:13:43,00:13:48,"it saying, listen you managed to do this, why don't we get you to work it Bletchley?"
00:13:48,00:13:52,"And they reprinted the crossword, you can try the crossword and see if you can do it in"
00:13:52,00:13:53,12 minutes.
00:13:53,00:13:54,Yeah.
00:13:54,00:13:57,I send off crosswords to the Sunday Times and Telegraph when I've done them and I do it in
00:13:57,00:14:00,the secret hope that one day I'm going to get a phone call that one.
00:14:00,00:14:03,"I mean they do invite you to send them off to win a fountain pen, it's not like I'm just"
00:14:03,00:14:04,sending it on.
00:14:04,00:14:05,How many people is it every week?
00:14:05,00:14:06,How many pens do you have?
00:14:06,00:14:07,Telegraph.
00:14:07,00:14:08,I've never won a pen.
00:14:08,00:14:09,I want to note that.
00:14:09,00:14:13,"I've never once successfully got the clue to a crossword right, ever."
00:14:13,00:14:14,What a critic.
00:14:14,00:14:20,"I have any crossword and I'm tried, exactly what a spy would say though and they'd be like,"
00:14:20,00:14:22,I am so bad at crosswords they would never recruit me.
00:14:22,00:14:26,"Because they ain't find out, Dan Shivers is a spy, it's a day in book, my ticket to Mars one"
00:14:26,00:14:27,way.
00:14:27,00:14:34,"Well here's another bit of evidence, he doesn't really speak very good English."
00:14:34,00:14:36,Would a spy say covered guard?
00:14:36,00:14:37,Yeah.
00:14:37,00:14:38,It's a no one knows where we are.
00:14:38,00:14:39,It's an actor genius.
00:14:39,00:14:42,"My name is Shriver, German surname."
00:14:42,00:14:43,What does that mean again?
00:14:43,00:14:44,Shriver.
00:14:44,00:14:45,Writer.
00:14:45,00:14:46,Writer.
00:14:46,00:14:47,"Yeah, just saying."
00:14:47,00:14:49,"And that was my chronic kind of pun, right?"
00:14:49,00:14:50,When they gave you that.
00:14:50,00:14:51,Yes.
00:14:51,00:14:53,It is all falling into place.
00:14:53,00:14:57,"There's this book called Double Cross, the true story of D-Day Spies, it's by a guy called"
00:14:57,00:15:01,"Ben McIntyre and I would highly recommend it, it's full of really exciting Spies."
00:15:01,00:15:03,"Yeah, could I just say as well?"
00:15:03,00:15:07,"He wrote a book called Agent Zigzag, one of the best nonfiction books I've read about"
00:15:07,00:15:09,spying.
00:15:09,00:15:14,"It reads like an Indiana Jones novel based on one of these agents, Agent Zigzag."
00:15:14,00:15:15,"Yeah, he's awesome."
00:15:15,00:15:16,Yeah.
00:15:16,00:15:21,"But so he tells this story about a spy called Goster Karolli, who was a German spy who was"
00:15:21,00:15:26,"parachuted into the Northamptonshire countryside, he got a concussed because he had a bad landing"
00:15:26,00:15:30,"and he tried to sleep off his concussion in a ditch, a farmer saw his leg poking out and"
00:15:30,00:15:31,so he was arrested.
00:15:31,00:15:35,But then it was great being arrested as a spy in those days because you'd immediately
00:15:35,00:15:38,"have the government going, ""What do you want to just be a spy for us instead?"""
00:15:38,00:15:42,"So he was arrested and agreed to be a double agent for Britain, but he agreed at first"
00:15:42,00:15:45,"and then he sort of changed his mind and decided he was betraying the Nazis, so he was in"
00:15:45,00:15:49,a safe outing Cambridge and he was given a minder because double agents had mined us to check
00:15:49,00:15:54,they weren't going rogue and he crept up behind his minder while he was playing patience
00:15:54,00:15:56,and tried to throttle him with a piece of rope.
00:15:56,00:16:01,"When this didn't work, he apologized, tied him to a chair and ran off with a tin of"
00:16:01,00:16:06,"pilchards, a pineapple and a large canvas canoe, then he stole a motorbike and rode towards"
00:16:06,00:16:11,the coast with the canoe balanced on his head with the plan to row to Holland.
00:16:11,00:16:16,He fell off the motorbike unspricingly I guess and then he approached a passing man and asked
00:16:16,00:16:21,"him to help him dispose of his canoe over a hedge, at which point when the man had helped"
00:16:21,00:16:25,"him do that, this man called the police and said, ""A guy with a German accent on a motorbike"
00:16:25,00:16:28,and a canoe in his head just asked me to help him dispose of his canoe.
00:16:28,00:16:33,"Does that sound right?"" and then the quote from this book was, ""Clearly unfit for double"
00:16:33,00:16:35,"agent work, he's my dresser, the war in prison."""
00:16:35,00:16:38,I like to think that if he'd have gotten to the coast he would have gotten his canoe and
00:16:38,00:16:46,put the motorbike on his head and rode across the coast.
00:16:46,00:16:50,"I feel like you've told me this before Anne and I don't think it's been on our show, which"
00:16:50,00:16:55,"is that at one point when Bletchley was going on Agatha Christie, so she got investigated."
00:16:55,00:16:57,Do you want to tell the story?
00:16:57,00:16:58,It's really interesting.
00:16:58,00:17:03,"Well, so Agatha Christie had a friend who actually worked at Bletchley who was very much a part"
00:17:03,00:17:11,of the enigma code cracking team and she released a book called N or M and in it there's a character
00:17:11,00:17:18,"called Major Bletchley and everyone got really worried that this guy, Dilly Nox's name, was"
00:17:18,00:17:23,leaking information about Bletchley to Agatha Christie and it turns out that what happened
00:17:23,00:17:29,was she was on a train heading back to London from Oxford and it stopped for ages at Bletchley
00:17:29,00:17:33,"and she got so annoyed by being stopped in the delay that she said, ""I'm going to name"
00:17:33,00:17:38,"the worst character in my book after this crappy town that we've been stuck in."""
00:17:38,00:17:40,And so it was just a total coincidence.
00:17:40,00:17:43,Bletchley isn't on the way from Oxford to London.
00:17:43,00:17:44,She's a spy.
00:17:44,00:17:45,She's obviously a spy.
00:17:45,00:17:50,I can't believe James and I are the first ones to spot that Bletchley is my.
00:17:50,00:17:51,Did she mean redding?
00:17:51,00:17:56,All of the spies were in redding park and we've just been missing her in these other places.
00:17:56,00:17:57,Just a couple of things on punning.
00:17:57,00:17:58,Yep.
00:17:58,00:17:59,Always.
00:17:59,00:18:00,Obviously a pun in the name.
00:18:00,00:18:01,So there's a pun in the book of Genesis.
00:18:01,00:18:02,So what is it?
00:18:02,00:18:03,The Bible.
00:18:03,00:18:06,The problem is that puns that are written in different languages aren't very good to repeat
00:18:06,00:18:11,on this podcast because we can't get them unless I explain the language to you but so it's
00:18:11,00:18:16,that the word for cunning which describes the serpent is very similar to the word for
00:18:16,00:18:17,naked.
00:18:17,00:18:22,The words are arum and arumim and so I think it's the idea is maybe that it's a pun saying
00:18:22,00:18:25,that the serpent is very close with its evil.
00:18:25,00:18:29,It's actually very close to these naked people who are about to be evil or so that's very
00:18:29,00:18:30,very funny in the Bible.
00:18:30,00:18:31,Would I open it with it?
00:18:31,00:18:33,"Yep, they did."
00:18:33,00:18:42,"Okay, time for fact number three and that is Chuzinski."
00:18:42,00:18:49,My fact this week is that houses in Bali are built in proportion to the owner's body.
00:18:49,00:18:50,That's incredible.
00:18:50,00:18:51,It's so cool.
00:18:51,00:18:52,But what does it mean?
00:18:52,00:18:53,I don't actually know what it means.
00:18:53,00:18:55,It's mean if you have a big head they do a big roof or something.
00:18:55,00:18:58,It's kind of like that except it's not quite laid out like that.
00:18:58,00:19:01,You obviously haven't spoken to Bali and he's architects but it's similar.
00:19:01,00:19:02,So.
00:19:02,00:19:05,So your head and shame James.
00:19:05,00:19:08,So the employer special kind of architect who's called an undargy and the first thing
00:19:08,00:19:12,he does when you employ him to come and build your household is he measures all your
00:19:12,00:19:18,body parts and works out and by those measurements he can work out what shape and size to make the
00:19:18,00:19:19,house.
00:19:19,00:19:22,So he'll measure different parts of the head.
00:19:22,00:19:26,He measures the distance from the elbow to the fingers I think.
00:19:26,00:19:30,"The width of the fist, the length of the index finger, the width of the little finger and"
00:19:30,00:19:35,all these measurements determine the size of the compound and the dimensions inside of
00:19:35,00:19:41,like pavilions and the spacing of different pillars and the width of the beds even is determined
00:19:41,00:19:43,by the width of a fingernail or whatever.
00:19:43,00:19:44,It's so weird.
00:19:44,00:19:45,That's amazing.
00:19:45,00:19:46,"Yeah, it's really cool."
00:19:46,00:19:47,And there's a bit.
00:19:47,00:19:50,So part of the house represents the head and that's where the head of the family should
00:19:50,00:19:53,stay because they think that the head is the most sacred part of the body is the best
00:19:53,00:19:54,bit.
00:19:54,00:20:00,And then the feet are where sort of the cows and the pig if you've got if you own farm animals
00:20:00,00:20:04,the foot area of the house is where they stay and then it's got an anus area which is
00:20:04,00:20:09,where the rubbish is and which is where they measure the size of your area.
00:20:09,00:20:10,I believe they have to.
00:20:10,00:20:11,Wow.
00:20:11,00:20:12,Otherwise you can't build a proper house.
00:20:12,00:20:13,That's amazing.
00:20:13,00:20:15,"I mean, I'm assuming that's not every single house in Bali."
00:20:15,00:20:17,I've been to Bali and I've never seen the measurements.
00:20:17,00:20:19,"No, it's traditional houses."
00:20:19,00:20:25,Because if you didn't know who had done that process and not and you got to their house
00:20:25,00:20:29,"and you saw it at the back, there was a massive rubbish bit, but Mike's got a massive anus."
00:20:29,00:20:30,I have no idea.
00:20:30,00:20:31,Is he okay?
00:20:31,00:20:32,There are three skits for that.
00:20:32,00:20:33,You were a mess anus.
00:20:33,00:20:34,Of.
00:20:34,00:20:36,"Yeah, I don't know if they do that."
00:20:36,00:20:37,Right.
00:20:37,00:20:43,"I wonder if you'd be able to go to a house, measure all the rooms and say, ""Oh, this person"
00:20:43,00:20:50,"must have slightly above average size head, large anus, whatever, large feet so it's going"
00:20:50,00:20:51,"to be Jeff or whatever."""
00:20:51,00:20:52,Yeah.
00:20:52,00:20:56,Or maybe if you take your girlfriend home then she brings a tape measure and you find her
00:20:56,00:21:01,"measuring the sort of protruded extension at some point and that's how you judge a man,"
00:21:01,00:21:02,isn't it?
00:21:02,00:21:06,"But you'd be just like, you know what they say about men with large areas for their pigs"
00:21:06,00:21:07,and cattle.
00:21:07,00:21:08,Huge feet.
00:21:08,00:21:12,The protruding extension.
00:21:12,00:21:19,"By the way, Jeff and Mike, not very Balinese names, for these examples, but Balinese names"
00:21:19,00:21:21,are really interesting.
00:21:21,00:21:26,"So I used to go to Bali a lot as a child because I grew up in Hong Kong, it was very close"
00:21:26,00:21:30,"and so we used to go a lot because Hong Kong being a concrete jungle, you sort of wanted"
00:21:30,00:21:32,to get away from the city.
00:21:32,00:21:34,That was a nice place that you could get to very easy.
00:21:34,00:21:39,"And the names there, so they're kind of given the same names."
00:21:39,00:21:44,"This is traditionally, so I don't want to speak as if everyone's got this, but Huayan is"
00:21:44,00:21:48,a name that I've known since childhood because everyone I've met there is called Huayan.
00:21:48,00:21:49,It's the oldest.
00:21:49,00:21:51,The first son is called Huayan.
00:21:51,00:21:56,"There's a few other options for that as well, but Huayan is the big one."
00:21:56,00:22:00,"Second born names, Maddie, and Huayan's for guys by the way."
00:22:00,00:22:04,"Then you've got the third born, the fourth born, and that's all that the list goes up to."
00:22:04,00:22:09,"So then if you have a fifth child, they just call it Huayan and then use the word for"
00:22:09,00:22:12,"again in Balinese, so it's Huayan again."
00:22:12,00:22:16,"So the word for the name for a fourth child, the ones that Dan's just listed there have"
00:22:16,00:22:17,a few alternatives.
00:22:17,00:22:21,"So you can say Huayan and then there are a couple of other synonyms that they say, so you"
00:22:21,00:22:23,can have one of two or three names.
00:22:23,00:22:27,"But if you're the fourth born, there's only one name, and I think that's because at the"
00:22:27,00:22:31,"time this system was set up, they wanted to discourage people from having too many kids,"
00:22:31,00:22:34,"so they were like, look, you're fourth kid, you've only got one option for the name."
00:22:34,00:22:38,"And that option is Ketut, and it means little banana, as in the smallest banana at the"
00:22:38,00:22:42,"end of the bunch, so every single fourth child is called little banana."
00:22:42,00:22:43,That's much sweeter than that.
00:22:43,00:22:46,Do you remember the thing we had about Victorian slang for the youngest child?
00:22:46,00:22:47,What was that?
00:22:47,00:22:48,Last shake of the bag.
00:22:48,00:22:49,Oh yeah.
00:22:49,00:22:51,"My turn, Victorians."
00:22:51,00:22:55,"I just, this is completely off topic, but I was reading about it today."
00:22:55,00:23:00,"If you read any old kind of Guinness book of records, there's often the woman with most"
00:23:00,00:23:06,"children, and she was Russian, she was from St. Petersburg, I don't remember her name, Valentina,"
00:23:06,00:23:07,maybe it was something.
00:23:07,00:23:10,"Maybe Valentina, for Silly Air, for something."
00:23:10,00:23:17,"Anyway, so she had 67 children, if I remember rightly, a lot of them were triplets and twins."
00:23:17,00:23:34,"So they just got a big garbage jump, isn't she?"
00:23:34,00:23:35,Valentina.
00:23:35,00:23:42,"Yeah, but what I learned today is that her husband, after he left her, and then went to another"
00:23:42,00:23:44,woman and had 18 children with her.
00:23:44,00:23:45,Wow.
00:23:45,00:23:46,Wow.
00:23:46,00:23:51,"It's like 19th century, so I think we're not 100% sure if it's all true, but there are some"
00:23:51,00:23:52,contemporary reports about it.
00:23:52,00:23:53,Wow.
00:23:53,00:23:57,So it's possible that everyone in St. Petersburg has descended from that one man.
00:23:57,00:23:58,That is.
00:23:58,00:24:01,That's the logical conclusion.
00:24:01,00:24:04,"So in Bali, they have sort of an inbuilt sense of direction."
00:24:04,00:24:09,"It's one of the first things you learn is your sense of direction, and anthropological"
00:24:09,00:24:14,accounts will say that if like a traditional Barlinese person moves to a place where they're
00:24:14,00:24:18,"not sure about the orientation, they get really disoriented, then that can make them feel"
00:24:18,00:24:19,really uncomfortable.
00:24:19,00:24:22,You mean like it's you always know which way is North kind of thing?
00:24:22,00:24:27,"You always know which way is North, except if you go to Bali and you ask which way is North,"
00:24:27,00:24:34,sometimes they'll point south because these people have an extraordinary way of telling
00:24:34,00:24:35,where is North.
00:24:35,00:24:36,Why do they point south?
00:24:36,00:24:40,So the reason they point south is actually because the equivalent North in Bali is actually
00:24:40,00:24:45,"just towards their biggest mountain, so in the biggest mountain in Bali is right in the"
00:24:45,00:24:50,"middle, and so it's not actually North, it's Kaja, but that's often translated in English"
00:24:50,00:24:51,as North.
00:24:51,00:24:55,"And most people live in the south of Bali, so Kaja is usually North, but if you're North"
00:24:55,00:24:59,"Bali and they say Kaja, then they mean south towards the mountain."
00:24:59,00:25:04,And all of the orientation is based on towards the mountain or towards sea.
00:25:04,00:25:09,"But I reckon if I had to point towards the largest feature in my island, I would be able"
00:25:09,00:25:10,to do that.
00:25:10,00:25:11,I mean there's a massive mountain.
00:25:11,00:25:12,"You just go look, it's there."
00:25:12,00:25:13,Yeah.
00:25:13,00:25:15,Just stop doing down the innate sense of direction.
00:25:15,00:25:19,"Like when points like Ben Nevers can't hear the way, or they can't see it, although I did"
00:25:19,00:25:24,me something that said that Barlinese people who live nearer other mountains use that mountain
00:25:24,00:25:25,instead of North.
00:25:25,00:25:26,Is this Mount Agung?
00:25:26,00:25:27,Yes.
00:25:27,00:25:30,"Okay, so Mount Agung, it's twice the size of Ben Nevers."
00:25:30,00:25:31,Can you see it from everywhere?
00:25:31,00:25:36,"I feel like it was always, you know, there's obviously bits where you just go way too"
00:25:36,00:25:39,far and it's just what a fog might take over or something like that.
00:25:39,00:25:44,"But yeah, it's, that erupts quite, it will use to erupt quite a lot."
00:25:44,00:25:47,"I remember as kids when we used to go past it, we were always really scared because they"
00:25:47,00:25:50,"said, well, it's still active and that's not what you want to hear."
00:25:50,00:25:51,Yeah.
00:25:51,00:25:55,"And I asked my dad, what would we do in the situation, and he said, well, I'd grab your sister"
00:25:55,00:25:56,and run.
00:25:56,00:25:57,What about me?
00:25:57,00:26:02,"So in the scenario of death, I was being left behind by my dad, that's why I learned that"
00:26:02,00:26:03,day.
00:26:03,00:26:04,At least he was honest with you.
00:26:04,00:26:05,Yeah.
00:26:05,00:26:06,Should we move on?
00:26:06,00:26:09,Yeah.
00:26:09,00:26:10,Yeah.
00:26:10,00:26:14,"China now, the Chinese government now has a ban on building eccentric buildings because people"
00:26:14,00:26:16,keep building buildings they consider embarrassing.
00:26:16,00:26:21,One of them was built by a British company and it's called the pair of pants.
00:26:21,00:26:23,It's been called the pair of pants.
00:26:23,00:26:27,It used to be called the Gate of the Orient Building because it looks like a giant pair
00:26:27,00:26:32,of trousers and lots of people in the area complained it's in suju in China and local
00:26:32,00:26:37,bystanders are raging that it's just a big pair of pants as soon as the legs were joined together
00:26:37,00:26:41,"and they say, I just feel like I'm humiliated as I walk under someone's crotch."
00:26:41,00:26:45,"And so the Chinese government said, look, no more embarrassing buildings."
00:26:45,00:26:46,Wow.
00:26:46,00:26:47,Yeah.
00:26:47,00:26:48,Shame.
00:26:48,00:26:52,"They did a few years ago in South Sudan, do you remember, when they got their independence,"
00:26:52,00:26:56,they decided they were going to build all of their cities in the shape of animals.
00:26:56,00:26:57,Wow.
00:26:57,00:27:02,"So they were going to move the capital from, oh god, the capital is Juba, I think."
00:27:02,00:27:07,They were going to move it to a new city which was shaped like a giraffe or an elephant
00:27:07,00:27:08,or something.
00:27:08,00:27:09,The city was shaped like a giraffe.
00:27:09,00:27:10,"Yeah, really?"
00:27:10,00:27:14,And they would put like the president's palace would be in the eye of the elephant or giraffe
00:27:14,00:27:17,and the waste disposal would be where the anus would be.
00:27:17,00:27:18,Cool.
00:27:18,00:27:19,There's like the streets would be the light up.
00:27:19,00:27:25,"Yeah, but they never did it because basically it would cost like £20 billion to do it and"
00:27:25,00:27:27,the poorest country in the world so they never did it.
00:27:27,00:27:28,Yeah.
00:27:28,00:27:30,But they thought it might get like tourism and stuff.
00:27:30,00:27:32,I got to visit a giraffe town.
00:27:32,00:27:34,I don't know if you would if it was in the South Sudan.
00:27:34,00:27:39,I'd be tempted to pop in if I was ever going from Oxford to London.
00:27:39,00:27:45,"OK, time for our final fact of the show and that is my fact."
00:27:45,00:27:51,"And my fact this week is that according to Isaac Newton, the world is going to end in"
00:27:51,00:27:52,2060.
00:27:52,00:27:53,Hi.
00:27:53,00:27:55,And he knew a lot.
00:27:55,00:27:57,So we believe it.
00:27:57,00:28:00,"No, OK, so we definitely shouldn't believe it."
00:28:00,00:28:03,It's interesting that he just made that prediction though.
00:28:03,00:28:08,And he because obviously we all know if you've looked into Newton's life that he was obviously
00:28:08,00:28:13,"this great scientist, but he also believed in a lot of, I don't know, alchemy and mystical"
00:28:13,00:28:14,sort of stuff.
00:28:14,00:28:15,Crazy shit.
00:28:15,00:28:16,Crazy stuff.
00:28:16,00:28:20,"Yeah, and he also, but the Bible was one thing that he really loved analyzing and this is"
00:28:20,00:28:22,where he got the date 2060 from.
00:28:22,00:28:27,He was analyzing the Bible and he was trying to work out when they ended the world would
00:28:27,00:28:28,"be, I think."
00:28:28,00:28:31,But he said that 2060 is just the earliest that might end.
00:28:31,00:28:32,Yeah.
00:28:32,00:28:38,"I think he said it may end later, but I see no reason for it ending sooner than 2060."
00:28:38,00:28:39,Yeah.
00:28:39,00:28:43,He also said it was to put a stop to the rash conjectures of fanciful men who are frequently
00:28:43,00:28:48,predict in the time of the end and by doing so bring the sacred prophecies into discredit
00:28:48,00:28:49,as often as their predictions fail.
00:28:49,00:28:55,"I should rephrase my fact, according to Isaac Newton, the world will end in 2060 or some"
00:28:55,00:28:58,time in between then and the end of the universe.
00:28:58,00:28:59,"Well, actually no."
00:28:59,00:29:05,"I think that one of the leading Newton scholars who's called Snowblan said, has worked out exactly"
00:29:05,00:29:08,what he meant by it and says he thought that the world was going to end sometime between
00:29:08,00:29:10,2060 and 2344.
00:29:10,00:29:11,Okay.
00:29:11,00:29:13,So it's in that window.
00:29:13,00:29:14,Okay.
00:29:14,00:29:15,That's a good one.
00:29:15,00:29:16,Apparently.
00:29:16,00:29:17,Yeah.
00:29:17,00:29:19,"But yeah, I think it was just, it was sort of rough scribblings, wasn't it?"
00:29:19,00:29:20,It wasn't really ever meant to be published.
00:29:20,00:29:22,"You scribbled it on the back of an envelope, literally."
00:29:22,00:29:23,Yeah.
00:29:23,00:29:28,"And it might have just been to put off, as Anne says, all of these skirmongers who kept"
00:29:28,00:29:31,"on predicting the end of the world and he really got very annoyed about that, all these prophecies"
00:29:31,00:29:33,that were saying the world's going to end.
00:29:33,00:29:36,So we thought the way to counter that is for me to prophesy when the world's going to
00:29:36,00:29:37,end.
00:29:37,00:29:38,Yes.
00:29:38,00:29:39,But also need to put it way out of his own lifetime so no one can say you were wrong.
00:29:39,00:29:40,Yeah.
00:29:40,00:29:46,But so he was truly interesting character for outside of his work in science.
00:29:46,00:29:52,"Interestingly, his most famous work, which I find hard to say, Prince Appier, almost"
00:29:52,00:29:53,didn't get published.
00:29:53,00:29:54,How come?
00:29:54,00:30:00,"Because a book just before it that was published was called ""History of Fishes"" or ""Historia"
00:30:00,00:30:05,"Paseum"" and it bankrupted basically the whole of the world."
00:30:05,00:30:06,What?
00:30:06,00:30:07,"Go back, go back."
00:30:07,00:30:08,Open the book.
00:30:08,00:30:09,To publish another book.
00:30:09,00:30:11,It bankrupted the whole world.
00:30:11,00:30:13,It's somehow the world pulled the cash together.
00:30:13,00:30:17,"Yeah, and they got the money together eventually and so it was published."
00:30:17,00:30:18,So yeah.
00:30:18,00:30:19,What do you actually mean by that?
00:30:19,00:30:20,"No, it's to do with the Royal Society."
00:30:20,00:30:21,Yeah.
00:30:21,00:30:24,And they had funding for publishing books and they thought this book on Fishes was going
00:30:24,00:30:30,to be massive and it tanked no one put it in there.
00:30:30,00:30:35,"So it basically delayed the publication of Prince Appier, so they weren't able to do it."
00:30:35,00:30:39,And then Edmund Halley stood in and he said that I think this book should be published
00:30:39,00:30:44,and he even put in some of his own money and so it was eventually published in 1687.
00:30:44,00:30:47,But there was a point where it wasn't going to be published because of the situation that
00:30:47,00:30:48,they were in.
00:30:48,00:30:49,That's really interesting.
00:30:49,00:30:50,Yeah.
00:30:50,00:30:53,"The Royal Society book, which is, there was a bit of, well today it's generally accepted"
00:30:53,00:30:57,that both Newton and Leibniz came up with calculus independently.
00:30:57,00:31:00,"But there was a while when they were sort of, they were, they sat up basically the Royal Society"
00:31:00,00:31:04,"in 1713 and set up a committee to decide, one's for all who'd done it, who, and they found"
00:31:04,00:31:06,that it was Newton.
00:31:06,00:31:07,Cherry of the committee?
00:31:07,00:31:08,Newton.
00:31:08,00:31:09,Newton.
00:31:09,00:31:10,Newton.
00:31:10,00:31:11,I think it was me.
00:31:11,00:31:12,You're fine.
00:31:12,00:31:16,"But he had a, like, he had a lot of professional rivalries, really better one with hook."
00:31:16,00:31:21,"Hook is what I remember. Hook's, Hook's main one and actually, Hook, he gets everywhere."
00:31:21,00:31:22,"Peter Penn, he pisses off."
00:31:22,00:31:23,Newton.
00:31:23,00:31:25,That's a bad guy.
00:31:25,00:31:26,The crocodile.
00:31:26,00:31:30,"I think Hook might be the good, I know it's hard to say who's the good guy in this."
00:31:30,00:31:32,I think they're both not very good guys actually.
00:31:32,00:31:33,Yeah.
00:31:33,00:31:34,Okay.
00:31:34,00:31:38,"So he, yeah, he had this dispute with Hook and it was about when he came up with this"
00:31:38,00:31:43,theory of gravity and Hook said that actually Newton got part of this idea from me about
00:31:43,00:31:44,how gravity decreases.
00:31:44,00:31:46,The inverse square law.
00:31:46,00:31:48,The inverse square law precisely.
00:31:48,00:31:49,Don't explain that.
00:31:49,00:31:50,We all know that.
00:31:50,00:31:51,Damn.
00:31:51,00:31:54,I don't want to patronize anyone.
00:31:54,00:31:57,"And yeah, Newton just wrote this letter saying he had absolutely nothing to do with it and"
00:31:57,00:31:59,I don't need to include him in my book.
00:31:59,00:32:04,"But there is a theory that, you know, the quote that Newton is most famous for saying,"
00:32:04,00:32:05,which is...
00:32:05,00:32:08,Your mum is so fat that the fear of her.
00:32:08,00:32:13,Your mum is so fat that the gravity decreases by the inverse of the squarehead of the distance
00:32:13,00:32:16,as I move away from her.
00:32:16,00:32:17,Was that it?
00:32:17,00:32:18,Sorry guys.
00:32:18,00:32:23,"His most famous quote is, ""If I have seen further, it is standing on the shoulders of giants."""
00:32:23,00:32:24,"Oh, yeah."
00:32:24,00:32:28,"And he wrote that too, Robert Hook, in a letter where he was saying, you know, it's been a"
00:32:28,00:32:30,real help having you guys around.
00:32:30,00:32:33,"If I've seen further, it's by standing on the shoulders of giants."
00:32:33,00:32:37,Some people believe actually this was just a jive hook because Hook had quite a serious
00:32:37,00:32:41,back problem which caused him to have a really massive hunch.
00:32:41,00:32:45,And so some people have now speculated you look like a steplutter.
00:32:45,00:32:46,No?
00:32:46,00:32:47,I don't get it.
00:32:47,00:32:48,What's the jive?
00:32:48,00:32:51,So he's thanking the giants for not hitting because he's too small.
00:32:51,00:32:52,"Oh, he's small."
00:32:52,00:32:53,Yeah.
00:32:53,00:32:54,You're not one of those giants.
00:32:54,00:32:59,"Yeah, it's nice that you're bending over so I can climb onto your shoulders."
00:32:59,00:33:00,So I found a list.
00:33:00,00:33:03,Have you guys read this list that he wrote when he was about 20 years old?
00:33:03,00:33:04,Yes.
00:33:04,00:33:05,I love it.
00:33:05,00:33:06,It's incredible.
00:33:06,00:33:07,It's such an insight.
00:33:07,00:33:08,What are your favourite ones?
00:33:08,00:33:12,My favourite is threatening my father and mother Smith to burn them in the house over them.
00:33:12,00:33:13,Yeah.
00:33:13,00:33:15,That's pretty vicious.
00:33:15,00:33:18,The next one is wishing death and hoping it to some.
00:33:18,00:33:19,Wow.
00:33:19,00:33:20,Eating an apple at thy house.
00:33:20,00:33:22,"Probably the apple, but he was-"
00:33:22,00:33:23,Cosa ate it.
00:33:23,00:33:25,Was that so you're not allowed to eat an apple in church?
00:33:25,00:33:26,"Well, I guess at the time."
00:33:26,00:33:29,"So you're focused on praying, not your belly."
00:33:29,00:33:30,24.
00:33:30,00:33:31,Punching my sister.
00:33:31,00:33:33,25.
00:33:33,00:33:35,Robing my mother's box of plums and sugar.
00:33:35,00:33:36,Yeah.
00:33:36,00:33:37,"Oh, is that some kind of weird euphemism?"
00:33:37,00:33:38,No.
00:33:38,00:33:39,Making jam.
00:33:39,00:33:40,What?
00:33:40,00:33:41,Making jam is a euphemism.
00:33:41,00:33:44,So people have speculated about his relationship with his mother.
00:33:44,00:33:46,It was very difficult and twisted.
00:33:46,00:33:51,A lot of people have Freudianly decided that he has mother issues and that's why he remained
00:33:51,00:33:52,a virgin.
00:33:52,00:33:53,"His whole life, which he did, didn't he?"
00:33:53,00:33:54,Yeah.
00:33:54,00:33:56,I've never really had an attachment to women because they think and he hated his stepfather.
00:33:56,00:33:59,He didn't like his sister much because he punched her.
00:33:59,00:34:02,"No, that was a sign of affection in the 17th century."
00:34:02,00:34:03,Yeah.
00:34:03,00:34:04,Playful punching.
00:34:04,00:34:05,"Okay, going on to the end of the world."
00:34:05,00:34:06,Yeah.
00:34:06,00:34:07,Yeah.
00:34:07,00:34:15,"I'm called 88 Reasons, The Rapture will be in 1988 by Edgar Weissant, which I really like."
00:34:15,00:34:18,"And on Amazon, there's some One-Star reviews."
00:34:18,00:34:22,"In fact, there's only two reviews and they're both One-Star reviews."
00:34:22,00:34:26,"And one of the reviews is, really, it's impossible to give this a positive review given that it"
00:34:26,00:34:33,"exists entirely to preach that the Rapture will be happening in 1988, as I recall, The Rapture"
00:34:33,00:34:34,did not occur in 1982.
00:34:34,00:34:35,Yeah.
00:34:35,00:34:42,"But yeah, this guy, Edgar Weissant, was quite famous at the time, but obviously, in 1989,"
00:34:42,00:34:44,they realised that he was wrong.
00:34:44,00:34:49,But then his next book was called Rapture Report 1989.
00:34:49,00:34:52,And then he also wrote another one called 23 Reasons.
00:34:52,00:34:57,"It looks like the end of the world will occur on Roch Hashanah, 1993."
00:34:57,00:35:02,"And another one called Earth Destruction by Fire, Nuclear Bomb Fire, Prediction for"
00:35:02,00:35:03,1994.
00:35:03,00:35:05,Is it an annual?
00:35:05,00:35:06,It is phenomenal.
00:35:06,00:35:09,"Had these people managed, if it doesn't, when it doesn't happen, to say, oh, yeah, we've just"
00:35:09,00:35:10,gotten the numbers wrong.
00:35:10,00:35:14,"And the next time there's always a big fuss again, there was a new story and people panic,"
00:35:14,00:35:18,"oh, I really like this guy in New Hampshire, who set up a business called Eternal Earthbound"
00:35:18,00:35:20,"Pets, which will look after the Pets."
00:35:20,00:35:22,"If you believe you're going to be raptured, you pay him to look after your pet, because"
00:35:22,00:35:25,the ones who stay behind can feed the cats.
00:35:25,00:35:28,And he's told the Wall Street Journal that the people who pay him will be disappointed
00:35:28,00:35:31,"twice, once because they weren't raptured."
00:35:31,00:35:32,"And again, because I don't do refunds."
00:35:32,00:35:36,"But actually, he admitted that that was a hoax a bit later on."
00:35:36,00:35:37,"Oh, no."
00:35:37,00:35:42,"Well, it was because the State Insurance Department came after him and said, oh, you seem to be selling"
00:35:42,00:35:46,"insurance, but you're not really registered to sell insurance, are you?"
00:35:46,00:35:52,"He said he's had no clients, never issued a certificate, and he's not taken a single dollar"
00:35:52,00:35:53,in the three years of its existence.
00:35:53,00:35:57,"So the baby isn't going well, you sure?"
00:35:57,00:36:02,"It is really interesting, though, that whole, when the rapture can't, when you've predicted"
00:36:02,00:36:04,"the rapture comes, and it doesn't, what do you do after that?"
00:36:04,00:36:10,"And I think that was one of the spurs for psychological analysis of cognitive dissonance, which"
00:36:10,00:36:15,"is the thing where you adjust reality in your mind to suit what you've expected, because"
00:36:15,00:36:19,humans find it so hard to deal with facts that don't accord with what they thought was
00:36:19,00:36:20,the truth.
00:36:20,00:36:25,"And so I think this is expanded in 1954, when Dorothy Martin said that she'd received"
00:36:25,00:36:29,"news from the planet Clarion, that a bunch of aliens were going to come down on a flying"
00:36:29,00:36:34,"saucer, and beam up everyone who, you know, collected in a certain area, and she gathered"
00:36:34,00:36:39,"quite a few followers, and on Christmas Eve, they all went to this area to be beamed up"
00:36:39,00:36:44,"by a flying saucer, and they sung some Christmas carols, and the flying saucer didn't come."
00:36:44,00:36:48,And what she didn't realise was that her group had been infiltrated by this really famous
00:36:48,00:36:53,"psychologist called Festinger, who I think is the leading psychologist on cognitive dissonance,"
00:36:53,00:36:55,"who was looking at how, how do you justify that?"
00:36:55,00:36:59,And they justified it by saying the aliens were so impressed at their sign of devotion that
00:36:59,00:37:02,they decided not to destroy Earth after all.
00:37:02,00:37:03,"Oh, that is really an excuse."
00:37:03,00:37:05,"Went away again, yeah."
00:37:05,00:37:09,"And so I think on Twitter about a while ago, which I love, which is there was a dystopian"
00:37:09,00:37:14,"features book convention, and someone overheard someone saying, excuse me, is this the cue"
00:37:14,00:37:15,for the apocalypse?
00:37:15,00:37:16,One of the events?
00:37:16,00:37:17,I just think it's so British.
00:37:17,00:37:18,"Yeah, yeah."
00:37:18,00:37:19,The cue for the apocalypse.
00:37:19,00:37:23,You know Newton used to give lectures to lecture theatres.
00:37:23,00:37:25,Good to be.
00:37:25,00:37:30,"Actually, someone's done a study on kind of mentally what famous scientists are like, and that"
00:37:30,00:37:35,"someone is Simon Baron Cohen, who's a really famous neuroscientist, and he's also Sasha"
00:37:35,00:37:40,"Baron Cohen's cousin, but this is looking into how they display signs of autism, and it"
00:37:40,00:37:43,"seems like Newton found it really hard to connect to other people, and he gave really"
00:37:43,00:37:48,"boring lectures, he didn't care about lecturing, he just wanted to be alone in his attic studying,"
00:37:48,00:37:51,"so people tended not to go, and if no one went, he'd just give the lecture anyway to an"
00:37:51,00:37:52,empty room.
00:37:52,00:38:01,And that's it for this week's episode.
00:38:01,00:38:06,"You'll notice our abrupt ending there, that was because Alex Bell came in to tell us that"
00:38:06,00:38:12,"the entire road that we work on had been evacuated, except for us, because we were busy making"
00:38:12,00:38:16,a podcast talking about the end of the world.
00:38:16,00:38:19,"So we had to leave the building immediately, also incidentally at the same time, Mount"
00:38:19,00:38:24,"Antner erupted, so yeah, but that's it, that's our show, that's all of our facts, thank you"
00:38:24,00:38:26,so much for listening.
