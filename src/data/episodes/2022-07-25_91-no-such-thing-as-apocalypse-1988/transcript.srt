1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,640
 "It's time to get out of here."

2
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:17,120
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

3
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,840
 to you from the QI offices in Covern Garden.

4
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:20,840
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

5
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:24,480
 I'm sitting here with Ann Miller, James Harkin, and Anitzo Zinski.

6
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,160
 And once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the

7
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,360
 last seven days and in no particular order, here we go.

8
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,760
 Starting with you, James Harkin.

9
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:41,520
 Okay, my fact this week is that the very hungry caterpillar was originally called a

10
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,320
 week with Willie The Worm.

11
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,120
 That's quite a different book, that sounds like.

12
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,200
 Yeah, how similar was it to this story about a caterpillar?

13
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,080
 Oh, well, it was a different ending, but it was a similar--

14
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,760
 Didn't Worm didn't turn into a butterfly?

15
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,080
 No, the worm didn't turn into a butterfly.

16
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:01,640
 The book wasn't written by a guy called Eric Karl, and he was inspired by a whole punch.

17
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,080
 He noticed that the hole was going through some paper, and he thought, "What if I turn

18
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,920
 this into a book?"

19
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:11,080
 And so he thought, "Well, I could do a bookworm that goes through the holes."

20
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,360
 So that's why it was called Willie The Bookworm.

21
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,920
 And then I think it was his publisher, came up to him and said, "Well, why don't you change

22
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,720
 it instead of a worm into a caterpillar?"

23
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:23,280
 And he thought, "Ah-ha, caterpillars turn into butterflies, spoiler alert.

24
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,040
 I could do that at the end of my book."

25
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,040
 Okay.

26
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:31,400
 "Do we know, was it going to be like Monday, what if the worm goes to the shops, Tuesday,

27
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,400
 stays in bed all day?"

28
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,400
 It just seems like, I don't know why.

29
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,920
 He spends a week with Willie The Worm.

30
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,960
 This is the worst Craig David song of the world.

31
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,240
 There are some quite traumatising children's books out there.

32
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,920
 There's one that's like about the journey of a sperm, which is really popular at the

33
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,920
 moment.

34
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,920
 I don't know what a sperm is.

35
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,920
 It's a cold where Willie went.

36
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,920
 I think it is, which is actually very misleading, calling it Willie.

37
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,760
 I think that is going to confuse a lot of children, I don't know.

38
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:56,480
 I saw a picture of that book where Willie went, it's called "The Big Story of a Little

39
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,480
 Sperm".

40
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:01,720
 And on the front cover it says, "The best story of its sort, the Daily Mail."

41
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,720
 So it's like, "Oh wow."

42
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,520
 "This is the best children's book about sperm."

43
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,520
 In the genre.

44
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,520
 That is out there.

45
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,520
 Children's Bermbecks.

46
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,400
 Last year's best-selling UK child's author.

47
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,400
 Dear Williams?

48
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,400
 Yeah.

49
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,400
 Yeah.

50
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,880
 He made seven million last year of book sales.

51
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,880
 Seven million pounds.

52
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,880
 Yes.

53
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,040
 He needs to get out of the podcasting game and into the children's books game.

54
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,040
 I know.

55
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,040
 Yeah.

56
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:27,280
 So his books get something like 600,000 sales each, like these got about eight books.

57
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,280
 It's ridiculous.

58
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,600
 So I didn't look into books because I'm bored of them.

59
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,600
 I don't read.

60
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,600
 Hell enough of it.

61
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,600
 I just looked at worms.

62
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,600
 Oh yeah.

63
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,600
 Anyone else interested in worms?

64
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,600
 Yeah, definitely.

65
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,400
 So have you ever tried worm fiddling?

66
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,400
 No.

67
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,400
 What's that?

68
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,400
 Or worm charming.

69
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,600
 Or worm charming, worm fiddling and worm grunting are all very similar.

70
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:48,400
 So worms, I don't think we know why, but when you create vibrations in the ground then worms

71
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,840
 come up to the surface and so the way you worm fiddle or you worm grunt, which is like getting

72
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,360
 worms up to the surface, is by making vibrations in the ground.

73
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,840
 And they think it might be because molds when they're coming to attack worms, they borrow

74
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,080
 towards them, make vibrations so they come up.

75
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:07,120
 Another theory is that they think it's rain coming down and so they're going out so that

76
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,120
 they don't drown.

77
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,120
 Yeah.

78
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,280
 We think on the other end, whenever a tractor like plows a field, that's the vibration.

79
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,280
 So the worms get exposed.

80
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,480
 But then they get eaten by all those birds that are always following.

81
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,480
 Exactly.

82
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,480
 And the birds are extremely good at it.

83
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,720
 And the big old dance that you often see them doing, where they bounce around on the

84
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,120
 floor a little bit, gets to get the worms to come up.

85
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,800
 But so worm grunting, charming fiddling, whatever, is kind of a competitive sport.

86
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:34,160
 And the person who holds the record for it is a 10-year-old girl who set it in 2009 in Chesha,

87
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,920
 and she brought up 567 worms out of the ground.

88
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,920
 That's so cool.

89
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,920
 That's so cool.

90
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,920
 In this little portion of land.

91
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:45,040
 There was one, yeah, I think it was like two or three years ago at the worm charming

92
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,320
 worm. No one got a single worm in the entire group of charmers.

93
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,320
 Wow.

94
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,160
 Well, maybe that's why they've got more imaginative in how to get them up.

95
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:58,000
 Apparently, in the competition that this girl won, techniques to get the worms up included

96
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,840
 a man who strummed rock tunes on his guitar, a woman who tapped dance to the theme from Star Wars

97
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,920
 and a man who played the xylophones with bottles, none of whom actually won, but it does sound

98
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,920
 like a really entertaining event.

99
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,920
 And what did she do again?

100
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,120
 She just did the common ways you tap the ground with cinema.

101
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,760
 So she just went classic on it?

102
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,720
 She went classic.

103
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,840
 I had a wee look at Eric Carl's website and his frequently asked questions.

104
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:21,840
 I don't know.

105
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,040
 I guess one of his frequently asked questions about the hungry caterpillar is?

106
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,360
 The one problem with the hungry caterpillar?

107
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,520
 It's that it comes out of a cocoon, not a chrysalis.

108
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,520
 Okay.

109
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,160
 So usually butterflies come from chrysalis, but there is one called the pinesian that comes

110
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,160
 in a cocoon.

111
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,160
 So the one's quibbling.

112
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,480
 That was a good, good point.

113
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,480
 Okay.

114
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,480
 A good, good point.

115
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:45,680
 So he's technically looked to how he could live in Siberia.

116
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,720
 I based it on a Siberian caterpillar.

117
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,480
 But he also says, and here's my unscientific explanation.

118
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,200
 My caterpillar is very unusual.

119
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,320
 Caterpillars don't eat lollipops and ice cream, so you won't find my caterpillar in any

120
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,320
 field guides.

121
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,320
 Right.

122
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,320
 Fock top, right?

123
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,320
 Yeah.

124
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,320
 I fucked up.

125
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,320
 I should have said that.

126
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,320
 I said this.

127
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,320
 Just leave it.

128
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:18,320
 Yeah.

129
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,320
 He's so angry.

130
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,320
 He's an ash, he's an ash, he's an ash, a national treasure, but love by children.

131
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,320
 Yeah, but he's got a curve of language.

132
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,600
 It's not appropriate for an FAQ, and you're on the website.

133
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:30,200
 Can I just quickly tell you about one really terrifying worm?

134
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:34,440
 I know I keep one trying to rebound this conversation back to worms.

135
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:39,320
 But there is this worm, the bobbet worm, which lives on the bottom of the ocean.

136
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,280
 Oh, is he named after Lorraine a bobbet?

137
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,280
 I don't know who that is.

138
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,280
 Is it John Wayne bobbet?

139
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,960
 Yeah, so Lorraine a bobbet was John Wayne bobbet's wife.

140
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,960
 Yeah.

141
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,960
 Who chops off his penis.

142
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,960
 Yeah.

143
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,960
 That makes sense.

144
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,960
 Maybe he's named off into compensated penis.

145
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,960
 Was it by any chance a 10 foot long penis?

146
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,960
 Wow.

147
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,960
 Not by the time she cut it off.

148
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,960
 It is 10 foot long.

149
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:04,360
 It lives on the bottom of the ocean, and it lives under the sand at the bottom of

150
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,360
 the ocean.

151
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,120
 And then when pre comes past, it pops up and snaps its jaws down so fast that it can cut

152
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,440
 fish straight in half.

153
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,440
 Wow.

154
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,440
 And then it sucks them.

155
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,600
 So if you're cut in half, you're dead already, which is good for you.

156
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:18,680
 And if you're not, it sucks you down into the sand, understand, and eat you.

157
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:22,640
 I just think a 10 foot long worm that can cut fish in half is pretty cool worm.

158
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,000
 I have a more scary worm than that, even, I think.

159
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 Oh, yeah.

160
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,880
 This is a colonoscopy performing robot that moves through your body in the same way

161
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,360
 that an earthworm moves.

162
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,880
 As in, they've actually made the movement of it to mimic it.

163
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,880
 To mimic an earthworm.

164
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,880
 Wow.

165
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,880
 That was quite scary.

166
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,880
 Is there any reason they're sending robots into my body?

167
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,880
 Oh, yeah.

168
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,880
 To medical purposes.

169
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,880
 Yeah.

170
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,880
 And some is products.

171
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,880
 And the 10 foot run.

172
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,880
 Yeah.

173
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,880
 We'll make it.

174
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,880
 Yeah.

175
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,880
 I like this.

176
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,880
 I clicked on the Mongolian death worm, which I think we've just guessed before.

177
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,880
 We have.

178
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,880
 By the way, interesting facts.

179
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,880
 I was going to mention it.

180
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:01,000
 But Andy has banned me from ever talking about the Mongolian death worm.

181
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 Here's your chance.

182
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 He's not here.

183
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,480
 Sometimes, for listeners who haven't heard it, it's a worm from Mongolia that shoots lightning

184
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,720
 bolts out of its anus.

185
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:14,520
 Disgusting creature that fires lightning out of its anus, Andy Murray will be back next

186
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,520
 week.

187
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,520
 Yeah.

188
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,520
 We should move on soon, anyway.

189
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,520
 Oh, should we?

190
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,520
 OK.

191
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,520
 We can do more worms.

192
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,200
 I've got a few more kid book things.

193
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:29,080
 One is, one's a question, which is J.K. Rowling has said that she regrets killing one

194
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,360
 character from Harry Potter.

195
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,400
 I want to see if anyone can guess.

196
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,520
 Is it Harry Potter?

197
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,520
 Does he die?

198
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,520
 James.

199
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:40,320
 It's, so I can't answer that for spoiler alert reasons.

200
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,880
 And I actually didn't write down his name, but he's a random ice cream man, right?

201
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,880
 Florian Fortescue.

202
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,880
 Right.

203
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:49,480
 So yeah, it's just a total random character, but it's because it was a senseless killing.

204
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,000
 She didn't bring it back into the story in any way.

205
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,080
 She didn't justify the killing for any reason.

206
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,080
 She just had him killed.

207
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,080
 She was just having a bad day.

208
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,780
 So I'm going to run into her website saying, your wizards aren't actually technically

209
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,780
 wizards.

210
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,420
 I just lost it.

211
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:08,980
 OK, time for fact number two, and that is end.

212
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:13,180
 My fact is that in World War II, the 20 committee was in charge of turning German spies and

213
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:17,900
 Roman numerals that made them the XX committee or the Double Cross committee, which basically

214
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:18,900
 means a peak wartime.

215
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,420
 Someone thought, you know what's good here?

216
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,420
 A pun.

217
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,420
 Yeah.

218
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,420
 Did they do it on purpose then?

219
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,420
 I'm not.

220
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,420
 So I heard this.

221
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,620
 I went to Black Tea Park the other week and I got told it on the walking tour, which

222
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:30,940
 was brilliant, but I have read recently that they were Double Cross first and then

223
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,340
 until it's 20 after.

224
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:36,220
 So either way, it's the Double Cross pun and then 24 making it less obvious, but it was hiding

225
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,220
 in plain sight.

226
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,220
 And is there a one to 19?

227
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,220
 I don't know.

228
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,220
 I think it just was 20.

229
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,220
 When someone said that was.

230
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,420
 I don't know about ones 19 actually.

231
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:43,420
 I think.

232
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:44,420
 I don't know.

233
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:48,540
 Well, I know the guy who oversaw it was this guy called Tar Roberts, who was the MI5 agent

234
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,540
 who overlooked it.

235
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:54,060
 And he would have done it on purpose because so wartime rules dictated that spy code

236
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:58,180
 names couldn't have a hint of the person's actual identity in them.

237
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:02,980
 And he disregarded these rules completely and made his own rule that every single spy name

238
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:06,260
 had to be a pun hint as to his actual name or a joke.

239
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:07,260
 Amazing.

240
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,260
 What was he called?

241
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,260
 He was called Tar Robertson, actually.

242
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,260
 And I didn't think he gave himself.

243
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:15,820
 I think he gave himself a perfectly like impossible to uncover name, but so it was like

244
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:21,060
 Dusko Popov was his second in command and he called him Scoot because he popped off.

245
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,060
 Popov.

246
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,060
 Nice.

247
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:25,660
 Although he then later changed his code name to Tricycle because he was known for having

248
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:26,660
 three sons.

249
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,660
 I have Tricycle.

250
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:31,820
 I have Arthur Owens, one of the first agents they turned on this and his code name was Snow,

251
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,540
 which is most letters of his surname.

252
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,540
 Yes.

253
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,540
 Yeah.

254
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:38,740
 But he was great because he was one of the first to work for this committee and he was very

255
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:42,420
 useful because the Abwehr, the Germans used him as their meeting great for new agents arriving

256
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,420
 in Britain.

257
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,900
 Everyone that came in just by for them went through him.

258
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:48,340
 He was a reporter to MI5, so he could just let them know what was going on.

259
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:52,060
 So just to give this a bit more context, this is World War II, bletchley Park, it's set up.

260
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:57,220
 They were trying to sort of get a lot of tricks over on the Germans and a lot of

261
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:01,980
 German agents were coming into Britain and immediately are they being caught or giving themselves

262
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:06,820
 up and then acting as double agents back to Germany or sending messages back and it was

263
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:07,820
 a huge part of the war.

264
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:13,620
 I mean, it led to some of the biggest moments in the war like the D-Day, the D-Day justified

265
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:14,620
 it.

266
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:18,660
 I have read one really good book extract which is basically saying this was this ridiculous

267
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:22,820
 side show with these idiots playing spy games for the whole war, mostly pointless and

268
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:26,500
 the only reason we now look back on them with this like air of God they saved us because

269
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,500
 of D-Day.

270
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:31,180
 Like there was one instance where we tried to persuade the Germans that we were going

271
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:36,340
 to be attacking the French coast at a certain place and so we sent out all these secret radio

272
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:39,580
 signals hoping they picked them up and stuff and they'd get all their troops there and

273
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:43,380
 then we sent some dummy boats out to warn the French coast so it seemed like we were going

274
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:47,460
 to attack and they hadn't picked up on any of these things we planted in their radio waves

275
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:52,740
 so we just spent ridiculous amounts of money and effort on absolutely nothing.

276
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:58,020
 One of my favourite double agents was a guy who was a codename Garbo so he was a guy who

277
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:01,500
 called Pujaro Garcia from Barcelona, he was anti-communist and he did not say he wanted

278
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,860
 to work for the British but he thought he'd be more helpful if he was already a German spy

279
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:08,140
 so he got himself recruited by telling them he had a visa and was going to England anyway

280
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:11,620
 didn't have the visa so he was spent his all his time in Lisbon library making up stuff

281
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:16,300
 for his spy network and research lines including things like there are in Glasgow men who

282
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,340
 will do anything for a liter of wine and the reports were so accurate.

283
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:24,380
 That was a lie was it. His impression from Lisbon of what life in Britain was like but his

284
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:27,180
 reports were so accurate and my five got really worried and started hunting for this mole

285
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:31,420
 in the UK because a lot of stuff was getting out he was just making it all up and then in

286
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:34,700
 the end he managed to get recruited by Britain and came over here to spy told the Germans

287
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:37,940
 he had 24 spies as big network and because it was backed up by the British whenever he

288
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:41,220
 that killed someone off they put their obituary in the paper so it would look legit to the

289
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:45,700
 Germans. On D-Day he was telling his colleagues to stand by for an important message to

290
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:49,220
 distract them from what was actually happening and they never found out when he got

291
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:52,180
 honours after the war for his efforts by the Germans.

292
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:56,060
 I didn't know that thing about all the names had to be a slight pun and I've got a big list

293
00:11:56,060 --> 00:12:00,260
 of names of some of the spies and is it all falling into place now.

294
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:04,660
 Slightly I mean you got to sort of know what they did like I don't know what biscuit did.

295
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:05,660
 Eight last nights.

296
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:10,500
 I can presume what the spy careless did got fired.

297
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,900
 Yeah. Freak. Not sure what he did.

298
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:14,900
 Gander.

299
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:18,980
 Oh Gander I can tell you Gander. Gander was just cut goose.

300
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:22,540
 Which I would have been so annoyed if I was cut goose and my boss said I'm going to give

301
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,540
 you the codename gander.

302
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:28,260
 I think I'd be saying do you mind giving me a slightly less obvious codename.

303
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:31,660
 How about this one? Sniper.

304
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:36,220
 I wonder if the idea is because like in those days there would have been a stereotype that

305
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:40,380
 Germans don't have a sense of humour probably and they felt by doing puns they'll never

306
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,900
 get these puns because Germans don't have a sense of humour.

307
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:46,220
 I bet they had that chat in my five HQ.

308
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:50,460
 I'm going to guess that one's hair base.

309
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:56,380
 Well the word mullet about hair only dates back to the 1980s that was the earliest anyone's

310
00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:01,180
 ever found it is in a song by the beastie boys and no one's ever found an earlier use of

311
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,180
 the word mullet.

312
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:04,180
 So beastie boys technically coined mullet.

313
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:06,500
 Yeah actually it might even be 90s.

314
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:13,020
 So the first Germans boys who came over were ill-peared right they couldn't speak any

315
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:16,420
 English, a lot of them, or spoke really bad English.

316
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:20,700
 So the extent that M.I.5 thought they were joking thought they were lying used to interrogate

317
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:24,940
 them and say obviously, you know, Germany wouldn't be stupid now, so despite who could

318
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:25,940
 not speak any English.

319
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,340
 But yeah isn't that bizarre?

320
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,340
 Yeah.

321
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:31,540
 So with Bletchley when they set this up the way that they started recruiting people was

322
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:35,180
 through a crossword that they put out on the papers and they set a challenge saying

323
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:39,740
 if people think that they can do a crossword within 12 minutes come and take this challenge

324
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:43,220
 so people came and they did the challenge and after they won they would then re-contact

325
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:48,580
 it saying, listen you managed to do this, why don't we get you to work it Bletchley?

326
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:52,140
 And they reprinted the crossword, you can try the crossword and see if you can do it in

327
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,140
 12 minutes.

328
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,140
 Yeah.

329
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:57,940
 I send off crosswords to the Sunday Times and Telegraph when I've done them and I do it in

330
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:00,820
 the secret hope that one day I'm going to get a phone call that one.

331
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:03,580
 I mean they do invite you to send them off to win a fountain pen, it's not like I'm just

332
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:04,580
 sending it on.

333
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:05,580
 How many people is it every week?

334
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:06,580
 How many pens do you have?

335
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,580
 Telegraph.

336
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,580
 I've never won a pen.

337
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:09,580
 I want to note that.

338
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:13,900
 I've never once successfully got the clue to a crossword right, ever.

339
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:14,900
 What a critic.

340
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:20,220
 I have any crossword and I'm tried, exactly what a spy would say though and they'd be like,

341
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,540
 I am so bad at crosswords they would never recruit me.

342
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:26,500
 Because they ain't find out, Dan Shivers is a spy, it's a day in book, my ticket to Mars one

343
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,500
 way.

344
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:34,700
 Well here's another bit of evidence, he doesn't really speak very good English.

345
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,500
 Would a spy say covered guard?

346
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,500
 Yeah.

347
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,500
 It's a no one knows where we are.

348
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,500
 It's an actor genius.

349
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,220
 My name is Shriver, German surname.

350
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,220
 What does that mean again?

351
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,220
 Shriver.

352
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,220
 Writer.

353
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,220
 Writer.

354
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,220
 Yeah, just saying.

355
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,220
 And that was my chronic kind of pun, right?

356
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,220
 When they gave you that.

357
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,220
 Yes.

358
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,740
 It is all falling into place.

359
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:57,740
 There's this book called Double Cross, the true story of D-Day Spies, it's by a guy called

360
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:01,500
 Ben McIntyre and I would highly recommend it, it's full of really exciting Spies.

361
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,340
 Yeah, could I just say as well?

362
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:07,860
 He wrote a book called Agent Zigzag, one of the best nonfiction books I've read about

363
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,860
 spying.

364
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:14,020
 It reads like an Indiana Jones novel based on one of these agents, Agent Zigzag.

365
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,020
 Yeah, he's awesome.

366
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,020
 Yeah.

367
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:21,900
 But so he tells this story about a spy called Goster Karolli, who was a German spy who was

368
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:26,300
 parachuted into the Northamptonshire countryside, he got a concussed because he had a bad landing

369
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:30,940
 and he tried to sleep off his concussion in a ditch, a farmer saw his leg poking out and

370
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:31,940
 so he was arrested.

371
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:35,140
 But then it was great being arrested as a spy in those days because you'd immediately

372
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:38,020
 have the government going, "What do you want to just be a spy for us instead?"

373
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:42,140
 So he was arrested and agreed to be a double agent for Britain, but he agreed at first

374
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:45,820
 and then he sort of changed his mind and decided he was betraying the Nazis, so he was in

375
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:49,860
 a safe outing Cambridge and he was given a minder because double agents had mined us to check

376
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:54,500
 they weren't going rogue and he crept up behind his minder while he was playing patience

377
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,940
 and tried to throttle him with a piece of rope.

378
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:01,580
 When this didn't work, he apologized, tied him to a chair and ran off with a tin of

379
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:06,380
 pilchards, a pineapple and a large canvas canoe, then he stole a motorbike and rode towards

380
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:11,100
 the coast with the canoe balanced on his head with the plan to row to Holland.

381
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:16,860
 He fell off the motorbike unspricingly I guess and then he approached a passing man and asked

382
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:21,420
 him to help him dispose of his canoe over a hedge, at which point when the man had helped

383
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:25,460
 him do that, this man called the police and said, "A guy with a German accent on a motorbike

384
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:28,740
 and a canoe in his head just asked me to help him dispose of his canoe.

385
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:33,300
 Does that sound right?" and then the quote from this book was, "Clearly unfit for double

386
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,460
 agent work, he's my dresser, the war in prison."

387
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:38,860
 I like to think that if he'd have gotten to the coast he would have gotten his canoe and

388
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:46,340
 put the motorbike on his head and rode across the coast.

389
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:50,620
 I feel like you've told me this before Anne and I don't think it's been on our show, which

390
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:55,940
 is that at one point when Bletchley was going on Agatha Christie, so she got investigated.

391
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:57,420
 Do you want to tell the story?

392
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,420
 It's really interesting.

393
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:03,140
 Well, so Agatha Christie had a friend who actually worked at Bletchley who was very much a part

394
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:11,060
 of the enigma code cracking team and she released a book called N or M and in it there's a character

395
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:18,180
 called Major Bletchley and everyone got really worried that this guy, Dilly Nox's name, was

396
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:23,980
 leaking information about Bletchley to Agatha Christie and it turns out that what happened

397
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:29,860
 was she was on a train heading back to London from Oxford and it stopped for ages at Bletchley

398
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:33,540
 and she got so annoyed by being stopped in the delay that she said, "I'm going to name

399
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:38,140
 the worst character in my book after this crappy town that we've been stuck in."

400
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,940
 And so it was just a total coincidence.

401
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:43,420
 Bletchley isn't on the way from Oxford to London.

402
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,420
 She's a spy.

403
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,420
 She's obviously a spy.

404
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:50,220
 I can't believe James and I are the first ones to spot that Bletchley is my.

405
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,220
 Did she mean redding?

406
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:56,420
 All of the spies were in redding park and we've just been missing her in these other places.

407
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:57,420
 Just a couple of things on punning.

408
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,420
 Yep.

409
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,420
 Always.

410
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,420
 Obviously a pun in the name.

411
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,420
 So there's a pun in the book of Genesis.

412
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:02,420
 So what is it?

413
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,420
 The Bible.

414
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:06,860
 The problem is that puns that are written in different languages aren't very good to repeat

415
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:11,460
 on this podcast because we can't get them unless I explain the language to you but so it's

416
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:16,300
 that the word for cunning which describes the serpent is very similar to the word for

417
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,300
 naked.

418
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:22,620
 The words are arum and arumim and so I think it's the idea is maybe that it's a pun saying

419
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,060
 that the serpent is very close with its evil.

420
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:29,900
 It's actually very close to these naked people who are about to be evil or so that's very

421
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:30,900
 very funny in the Bible.

422
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:31,900
 Would I open it with it?

423
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,900
 Yep, they did.

424
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:42,780
 Okay, time for fact number three and that is Chuzinski.

425
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:49,100
 My fact this week is that houses in Bali are built in proportion to the owner's body.

426
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,100
 That's incredible.

427
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,100
 It's so cool.

428
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,100
 But what does it mean?

429
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,100
 I don't actually know what it means.

430
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,700
 It's mean if you have a big head they do a big roof or something.

431
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,020
 It's kind of like that except it's not quite laid out like that.

432
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:01,340
 You obviously haven't spoken to Bali and he's architects but it's similar.

433
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,340
 So.

434
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:05,100
 So your head and shame James.

435
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:08,620
 So the employer special kind of architect who's called an undargy and the first thing

436
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:12,460
 he does when you employ him to come and build your household is he measures all your

437
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:18,380
 body parts and works out and by those measurements he can work out what shape and size to make the

438
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,860
 house.

439
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:22,860
 So he'll measure different parts of the head.

440
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:26,380
 He measures the distance from the elbow to the fingers I think.

441
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:30,620
 The width of the fist, the length of the index finger, the width of the little finger and

442
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:35,140
 all these measurements determine the size of the compound and the dimensions inside of

443
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:41,300
 like pavilions and the spacing of different pillars and the width of the beds even is determined

444
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,460
 by the width of a fingernail or whatever.

445
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,460
 It's so weird.

446
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,460
 That's amazing.

447
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,460
 Yeah, it's really cool.

448
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:47,460
 And there's a bit.

449
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:50,260
 So part of the house represents the head and that's where the head of the family should

450
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:53,980
 stay because they think that the head is the most sacred part of the body is the best

451
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:54,980
 bit.

452
00:19:54,980 --> 00:20:00,260
 And then the feet are where sort of the cows and the pig if you've got if you own farm animals

453
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:04,620
 the foot area of the house is where they stay and then it's got an anus area which is

454
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:09,020
 where the rubbish is and which is where they measure the size of your area.

455
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,340
 I believe they have to.

456
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,340
 Wow.

457
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,340
 Otherwise you can't build a proper house.

458
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,340
 That's amazing.

459
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:15,820
 I mean, I'm assuming that's not every single house in Bali.

460
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:17,820
 I've been to Bali and I've never seen the measurements.

461
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,340
 No, it's traditional houses.

462
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:25,340
 Because if you didn't know who had done that process and not and you got to their house

463
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:29,300
 and you saw it at the back, there was a massive rubbish bit, but Mike's got a massive anus.

464
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,300
 I have no idea.

465
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,300
 Is he okay?

466
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,300
 There are three skits for that.

467
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,300
 You were a mess anus.

468
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,300
 Of.

469
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,300
 Yeah, I don't know if they do that.

470
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,300
 Right.

471
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:43,020
 I wonder if you'd be able to go to a house, measure all the rooms and say, "Oh, this person

472
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:50,140
 must have slightly above average size head, large anus, whatever, large feet so it's going

473
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,460
 to be Jeff or whatever."

474
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,460
 Yeah.

475
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:56,820
 Or maybe if you take your girlfriend home then she brings a tape measure and you find her

476
00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:01,580
 measuring the sort of protruded extension at some point and that's how you judge a man,

477
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:02,580
 isn't it?

478
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:06,640
 But you'd be just like, you know what they say about men with large areas for their pigs

479
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,640
 and cattle.

480
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,640
 Huge feet.

481
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,540
 The protruding extension.

482
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:19,640
 By the way, Jeff and Mike, not very Balinese names, for these examples, but Balinese names

483
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,640
 are really interesting.

484
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:26,460
 So I used to go to Bali a lot as a child because I grew up in Hong Kong, it was very close

485
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:30,700
 and so we used to go a lot because Hong Kong being a concrete jungle, you sort of wanted

486
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,380
 to get away from the city.

487
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:34,820
 That was a nice place that you could get to very easy.

488
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:39,940
 And the names there, so they're kind of given the same names.

489
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:44,220
 This is traditionally, so I don't want to speak as if everyone's got this, but Huayan is

490
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:48,300
 a name that I've known since childhood because everyone I've met there is called Huayan.

491
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,300
 It's the oldest.

492
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,420
 The first son is called Huayan.

493
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:56,080
 There's a few other options for that as well, but Huayan is the big one.

494
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,300
 Second born names, Maddie, and Huayan's for guys by the way.

495
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:04,100
 Then you've got the third born, the fourth born, and that's all that the list goes up to.

496
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:09,540
 So then if you have a fifth child, they just call it Huayan and then use the word for

497
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:12,980
 again in Balinese, so it's Huayan again.

498
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:16,540
 So the word for the name for a fourth child, the ones that Dan's just listed there have

499
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,540
 a few alternatives.

500
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:21,060
 So you can say Huayan and then there are a couple of other synonyms that they say, so you

501
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:23,260
 can have one of two or three names.

502
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:27,820
 But if you're the fourth born, there's only one name, and I think that's because at the

503
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:31,500
 time this system was set up, they wanted to discourage people from having too many kids,

504
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,420
 so they were like, look, you're fourth kid, you've only got one option for the name.

505
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:38,860
 And that option is Ketut, and it means little banana, as in the smallest banana at the

506
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:42,740
 end of the bunch, so every single fourth child is called little banana.

507
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:43,740
 That's much sweeter than that.

508
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:46,540
 Do you remember the thing we had about Victorian slang for the youngest child?

509
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:47,540
 What was that?

510
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,540
 Last shake of the bag.

511
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,540
 Oh yeah.

512
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:51,540
 My turn, Victorians.

513
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:55,940
 I just, this is completely off topic, but I was reading about it today.

514
00:22:55,940 --> 00:23:00,940
 If you read any old kind of Guinness book of records, there's often the woman with most

515
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:06,860
 children, and she was Russian, she was from St. Petersburg, I don't remember her name, Valentina,

516
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:07,860
 maybe it was something.

517
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:10,260
 Maybe Valentina, for Silly Air, for something.

518
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:17,140
 Anyway, so she had 67 children, if I remember rightly, a lot of them were triplets and twins.

519
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:34,140
 So they just got a big garbage jump, isn't she?

520
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,140
 Valentina.

521
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:42,220
 Yeah, but what I learned today is that her husband, after he left her, and then went to another

522
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:44,620
 woman and had 18 children with her.

523
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,620
 Wow.

524
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:46,620
 Wow.

525
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:51,140
 It's like 19th century, so I think we're not 100% sure if it's all true, but there are some

526
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,900
 contemporary reports about it.

527
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:53,900
 Wow.

528
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:57,260
 So it's possible that everyone in St. Petersburg has descended from that one man.

529
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,260
 That is.

530
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:01,940
 That's the logical conclusion.

531
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,860
 So in Bali, they have sort of an inbuilt sense of direction.

532
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:09,300
 It's one of the first things you learn is your sense of direction, and anthropological

533
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:14,460
 accounts will say that if like a traditional Barlinese person moves to a place where they're

534
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:18,700
 not sure about the orientation, they get really disoriented, then that can make them feel

535
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,700
 really uncomfortable.

536
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:22,580
 You mean like it's you always know which way is North kind of thing?

537
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:27,460
 You always know which way is North, except if you go to Bali and you ask which way is North,

538
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:34,420
 sometimes they'll point south because these people have an extraordinary way of telling

539
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:35,740
 where is North.

540
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:36,740
 Why do they point south?

541
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:40,940
 So the reason they point south is actually because the equivalent North in Bali is actually

542
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:45,980
 just towards their biggest mountain, so in the biggest mountain in Bali is right in the

543
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:50,700
 middle, and so it's not actually North, it's Kaja, but that's often translated in English

544
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:51,700
 as North.

545
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:55,660
 And most people live in the south of Bali, so Kaja is usually North, but if you're North

546
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:59,540
 Bali and they say Kaja, then they mean south towards the mountain.

547
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:04,580
 And all of the orientation is based on towards the mountain or towards sea.

548
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:09,820
 But I reckon if I had to point towards the largest feature in my island, I would be able

549
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:10,820
 to do that.

550
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:11,820
 I mean there's a massive mountain.

551
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:12,820
 You just go look, it's there.

552
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:13,820
 Yeah.

553
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:15,460
 Just stop doing down the innate sense of direction.

554
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:19,940
 Like when points like Ben Nevers can't hear the way, or they can't see it, although I did

555
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:24,540
 me something that said that Barlinese people who live nearer other mountains use that mountain

556
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:25,540
 instead of North.

557
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:26,540
 Is this Mount Agung?

558
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:27,540
 Yes.

559
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:30,540
 Okay, so Mount Agung, it's twice the size of Ben Nevers.

560
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:31,540
 Can you see it from everywhere?

561
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:36,380
 I feel like it was always, you know, there's obviously bits where you just go way too

562
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:39,740
 far and it's just what a fog might take over or something like that.

563
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:44,380
 But yeah, it's, that erupts quite, it will use to erupt quite a lot.

564
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:47,300
 I remember as kids when we used to go past it, we were always really scared because they

565
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:50,660
 said, well, it's still active and that's not what you want to hear.

566
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:51,660
 Yeah.

567
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:55,260
 And I asked my dad, what would we do in the situation, and he said, well, I'd grab your sister

568
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,260
 and run.

569
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:57,260
 What about me?

570
00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:02,500
 So in the scenario of death, I was being left behind by my dad, that's why I learned that

571
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,500
 day.

572
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,500
 At least he was honest with you.

573
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,500
 Yeah.

574
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,500
 Should we move on?

575
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:09,500
 Yeah.

576
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,500
 Yeah.

577
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:14,940
 China now, the Chinese government now has a ban on building eccentric buildings because people

578
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,900
 keep building buildings they consider embarrassing.

579
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:21,340
 One of them was built by a British company and it's called the pair of pants.

580
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:23,340
 It's been called the pair of pants.

581
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:27,340
 It used to be called the Gate of the Orient Building because it looks like a giant pair

582
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:32,860
 of trousers and lots of people in the area complained it's in suju in China and local

583
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:37,260
 bystanders are raging that it's just a big pair of pants as soon as the legs were joined together

584
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:41,340
 and they say, I just feel like I'm humiliated as I walk under someone's crotch.

585
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:45,340
 And so the Chinese government said, look, no more embarrassing buildings.

586
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,340
 Wow.

587
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:47,340
 Yeah.

588
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,340
 Shame.

589
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:52,140
 They did a few years ago in South Sudan, do you remember, when they got their independence,

590
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:56,540
 they decided they were going to build all of their cities in the shape of animals.

591
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:57,540
 Wow.

592
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:02,220
 So they were going to move the capital from, oh god, the capital is Juba, I think.

593
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:07,140
 They were going to move it to a new city which was shaped like a giraffe or an elephant

594
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,140
 or something.

595
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,140
 The city was shaped like a giraffe.

596
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:10,140
 Yeah, really?

597
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:14,540
 And they would put like the president's palace would be in the eye of the elephant or giraffe

598
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:17,500
 and the waste disposal would be where the anus would be.

599
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,500
 Cool.

600
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:19,740
 There's like the streets would be the light up.

601
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:25,340
 Yeah, but they never did it because basically it would cost like £20 billion to do it and

602
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:27,740
 the poorest country in the world so they never did it.

603
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:28,740
 Yeah.

604
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,220
 But they thought it might get like tourism and stuff.

605
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:32,220
 I got to visit a giraffe town.

606
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:34,780
 I don't know if you would if it was in the South Sudan.

607
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:39,220
 I'd be tempted to pop in if I was ever going from Oxford to London.

608
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:45,820
 OK, time for our final fact of the show and that is my fact.

609
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:51,140
 And my fact this week is that according to Isaac Newton, the world is going to end in

610
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,140
 2060.

611
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,140
 Hi.

612
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:55,940
 And he knew a lot.

613
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,540
 So we believe it.

614
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:00,460
 No, OK, so we definitely shouldn't believe it.

615
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:03,060
 It's interesting that he just made that prediction though.

616
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:08,140
 And he because obviously we all know if you've looked into Newton's life that he was obviously

617
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:13,180
 this great scientist, but he also believed in a lot of, I don't know, alchemy and mystical

618
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:14,180
 sort of stuff.

619
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:15,180
 Crazy shit.

620
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,180
 Crazy stuff.

621
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:20,460
 Yeah, and he also, but the Bible was one thing that he really loved analyzing and this is

622
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:22,380
 where he got the date 2060 from.

623
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:27,300
 He was analyzing the Bible and he was trying to work out when they ended the world would

624
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,300
 be, I think.

625
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:31,780
 But he said that 2060 is just the earliest that might end.

626
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:32,780
 Yeah.

627
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:38,580
 I think he said it may end later, but I see no reason for it ending sooner than 2060.

628
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:39,580
 Yeah.

629
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:43,980
 He also said it was to put a stop to the rash conjectures of fanciful men who are frequently

630
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:48,180
 predict in the time of the end and by doing so bring the sacred prophecies into discredit

631
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:49,940
 as often as their predictions fail.

632
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:55,620
 I should rephrase my fact, according to Isaac Newton, the world will end in 2060 or some

633
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:58,380
 time in between then and the end of the universe.

634
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,380
 Well, actually no.

635
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:05,140
 I think that one of the leading Newton scholars who's called Snowblan said, has worked out exactly

636
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:08,180
 what he meant by it and says he thought that the world was going to end sometime between

637
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,780
 2060 and 2344.

638
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:11,780
 Okay.

639
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:13,300
 So it's in that window.

640
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,300
 Okay.

641
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,300
 That's a good one.

642
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,300
 Apparently.

643
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:17,300
 Yeah.

644
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:19,100
 But yeah, I think it was just, it was sort of rough scribblings, wasn't it?

645
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,340
 It wasn't really ever meant to be published.

646
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:22,580
 You scribbled it on the back of an envelope, literally.

647
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:23,580
 Yeah.

648
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:28,060
 And it might have just been to put off, as Anne says, all of these skirmongers who kept

649
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:31,780
 on predicting the end of the world and he really got very annoyed about that, all these prophecies

650
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:33,260
 that were saying the world's going to end.

651
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:36,140
 So we thought the way to counter that is for me to prophesy when the world's going to

652
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:37,140
 end.

653
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:38,140
 Yes.

654
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:39,820
 But also need to put it way out of his own lifetime so no one can say you were wrong.

655
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:40,820
 Yeah.

656
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:46,500
 But so he was truly interesting character for outside of his work in science.

657
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:52,300
 Interestingly, his most famous work, which I find hard to say, Prince Appier, almost

658
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,660
 didn't get published.

659
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:54,660
 How come?

660
00:29:54,660 --> 00:30:00,780
 Because a book just before it that was published was called "History of Fishes" or "Historia

661
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:05,260
 Paseum" and it bankrupted basically the whole of the world.

662
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:06,260
 What?

663
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:07,260
 Go back, go back.

664
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:08,260
 Open the book.

665
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:09,260
 To publish another book.

666
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:11,260
 It bankrupted the whole world.

667
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:13,780
 It's somehow the world pulled the cash together.

668
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:17,020
 Yeah, and they got the money together eventually and so it was published.

669
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,020
 So yeah.

670
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:19,020
 What do you actually mean by that?

671
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,020
 No, it's to do with the Royal Society.

672
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:21,020
 Yeah.

673
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:24,700
 And they had funding for publishing books and they thought this book on Fishes was going

674
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:30,540
 to be massive and it tanked no one put it in there.

675
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:35,740
 So it basically delayed the publication of Prince Appier, so they weren't able to do it.

676
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:39,780
 And then Edmund Halley stood in and he said that I think this book should be published

677
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:44,020
 and he even put in some of his own money and so it was eventually published in 1687.

678
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:47,420
 But there was a point where it wasn't going to be published because of the situation that

679
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:48,420
 they were in.

680
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:49,420
 That's really interesting.

681
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:50,420
 Yeah.

682
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:53,540
 The Royal Society book, which is, there was a bit of, well today it's generally accepted

683
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:57,940
 that both Newton and Leibniz came up with calculus independently.

684
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:00,460
 But there was a while when they were sort of, they were, they sat up basically the Royal Society

685
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:04,220
 in 1713 and set up a committee to decide, one's for all who'd done it, who, and they found

686
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:06,220
 that it was Newton.

687
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,220
 Cherry of the committee?

688
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:08,220
 Newton.

689
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,220
 Newton.

690
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:10,220
 Newton.

691
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:11,220
 I think it was me.

692
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,220
 You're fine.

693
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:16,540
 But he had a, like, he had a lot of professional rivalries, really better one with hook.

694
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:21,140
 Hook is what I remember. Hook's, Hook's main one and actually, Hook, he gets everywhere.

695
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,740
 Peter Penn, he pisses off.

696
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:23,740
 Newton.

697
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:25,740
 That's a bad guy.

698
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:26,740
 The crocodile.

699
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:30,460
 I think Hook might be the good, I know it's hard to say who's the good guy in this.

700
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:32,580
 I think they're both not very good guys actually.

701
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:33,580
 Yeah.

702
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,580
 Okay.

703
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:38,540
 So he, yeah, he had this dispute with Hook and it was about when he came up with this

704
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:43,500
 theory of gravity and Hook said that actually Newton got part of this idea from me about

705
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,500
 how gravity decreases.

706
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,620
 The inverse square law.

707
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,620
 The inverse square law precisely.

708
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:49,620
 Don't explain that.

709
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:50,620
 We all know that.

710
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:51,620
 Damn.

711
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:54,220
 I don't want to patronize anyone.

712
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:57,820
 And yeah, Newton just wrote this letter saying he had absolutely nothing to do with it and

713
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:59,500
 I don't need to include him in my book.

714
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:04,740
 But there is a theory that, you know, the quote that Newton is most famous for saying,

715
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:05,740
 which is...

716
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:08,500
 Your mum is so fat that the fear of her.

717
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:13,180
 Your mum is so fat that the gravity decreases by the inverse of the squarehead of the distance

718
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:16,380
 as I move away from her.

719
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,380
 Was that it?

720
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:18,500
 Sorry guys.

721
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:23,540
 His most famous quote is, "If I have seen further, it is standing on the shoulders of giants."

722
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:24,540
 Oh, yeah.

723
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:28,820
 And he wrote that too, Robert Hook, in a letter where he was saying, you know, it's been a

724
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:30,700
 real help having you guys around.

725
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:33,380
 If I've seen further, it's by standing on the shoulders of giants.

726
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:37,980
 Some people believe actually this was just a jive hook because Hook had quite a serious

727
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:41,380
 back problem which caused him to have a really massive hunch.

728
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:45,300
 And so some people have now speculated you look like a steplutter.

729
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,300
 No?

730
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,300
 I don't get it.

731
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,300
 What's the jive?

732
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:51,620
 So he's thanking the giants for not hitting because he's too small.

733
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:52,620
 Oh, he's small.

734
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:53,620
 Yeah.

735
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:54,620
 You're not one of those giants.

736
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:59,060
 Yeah, it's nice that you're bending over so I can climb onto your shoulders.

737
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,620
 So I found a list.

738
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:03,620
 Have you guys read this list that he wrote when he was about 20 years old?

739
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:04,620
 Yes.

740
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:05,620
 I love it.

741
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:06,620
 It's incredible.

742
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:07,620
 It's such an insight.

743
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:08,620
 What are your favourite ones?

744
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:12,740
 My favourite is threatening my father and mother Smith to burn them in the house over them.

745
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:13,740
 Yeah.

746
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:15,540
 That's pretty vicious.

747
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:18,580
 The next one is wishing death and hoping it to some.

748
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,580
 Wow.

749
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,580
 Eating an apple at thy house.

750
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:22,580
 Probably the apple, but he was-

751
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:23,580
 Cosa ate it.

752
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:25,580
 Was that so you're not allowed to eat an apple in church?

753
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:26,580
 Well, I guess at the time.

754
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:29,100
 So you're focused on praying, not your belly.

755
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,100
 24.

756
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,620
 Punching my sister.

757
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:33,100
 25.

758
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:35,060
 Robing my mother's box of plums and sugar.

759
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:36,060
 Yeah.

760
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,060
 Oh, is that some kind of weird euphemism?

761
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:38,060
 No.

762
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:39,060
 Making jam.

763
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,060
 What?

764
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,060
 Making jam is a euphemism.

765
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:44,060
 So people have speculated about his relationship with his mother.

766
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:46,540
 It was very difficult and twisted.

767
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:51,100
 A lot of people have Freudianly decided that he has mother issues and that's why he remained

768
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,100
 a virgin.

769
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,100
 His whole life, which he did, didn't he?

770
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,100
 Yeah.

771
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:56,980
 I've never really had an attachment to women because they think and he hated his stepfather.

772
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:59,900
 He didn't like his sister much because he punched her.

773
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:02,100
 No, that was a sign of affection in the 17th century.

774
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,100
 Yeah.

775
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,100
 Playful punching.

776
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,100
 Okay, going on to the end of the world.

777
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,100
 Yeah.

778
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,100
 Yeah.

779
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:15,180
 I'm called 88 Reasons, The Rapture will be in 1988 by Edgar Weissant, which I really like.

780
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:18,420
 And on Amazon, there's some One-Star reviews.

781
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:22,460
 In fact, there's only two reviews and they're both One-Star reviews.

782
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:26,860
 And one of the reviews is, really, it's impossible to give this a positive review given that it

783
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:33,140
 exists entirely to preach that the Rapture will be happening in 1988, as I recall, The Rapture

784
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:34,620
 did not occur in 1982.

785
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:35,620
 Yeah.

786
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:42,300
 But yeah, this guy, Edgar Weissant, was quite famous at the time, but obviously, in 1989,

787
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,420
 they realised that he was wrong.

788
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:49,220
 But then his next book was called Rapture Report 1989.

789
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:52,580
 And then he also wrote another one called 23 Reasons.

790
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:57,860
 It looks like the end of the world will occur on Roch Hashanah, 1993.

791
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:02,780
 And another one called Earth Destruction by Fire, Nuclear Bomb Fire, Prediction for

792
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:03,780
 1994.

793
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:05,220
 Is it an annual?

794
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:06,220
 It is phenomenal.

795
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:09,740
 Had these people managed, if it doesn't, when it doesn't happen, to say, oh, yeah, we've just

796
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:10,740
 gotten the numbers wrong.

797
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:14,140
 And the next time there's always a big fuss again, there was a new story and people panic,

798
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:18,460
 oh, I really like this guy in New Hampshire, who set up a business called Eternal Earthbound

799
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:20,460
 Pets, which will look after the Pets.

800
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:22,820
 If you believe you're going to be raptured, you pay him to look after your pet, because

801
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:25,020
 the ones who stay behind can feed the cats.

802
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:28,860
 And he's told the Wall Street Journal that the people who pay him will be disappointed

803
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:31,020
 twice, once because they weren't raptured.

804
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:32,580
 And again, because I don't do refunds.

805
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:36,820
 But actually, he admitted that that was a hoax a bit later on.

806
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:37,820
 Oh, no.

807
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:42,660
 Well, it was because the State Insurance Department came after him and said, oh, you seem to be selling

808
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:46,020
 insurance, but you're not really registered to sell insurance, are you?

809
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:52,140
 He said he's had no clients, never issued a certificate, and he's not taken a single dollar

810
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:53,860
 in the three years of its existence.

811
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:57,140
 So the baby isn't going well, you sure?

812
00:35:57,140 --> 00:36:02,180
 It is really interesting, though, that whole, when the rapture can't, when you've predicted

813
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:04,740
 the rapture comes, and it doesn't, what do you do after that?

814
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:10,540
 And I think that was one of the spurs for psychological analysis of cognitive dissonance, which

815
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:15,420
 is the thing where you adjust reality in your mind to suit what you've expected, because

816
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:19,280
 humans find it so hard to deal with facts that don't accord with what they thought was

817
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,280
 the truth.

818
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:25,260
 And so I think this is expanded in 1954, when Dorothy Martin said that she'd received

819
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:29,620
 news from the planet Clarion, that a bunch of aliens were going to come down on a flying

820
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:34,660
 saucer, and beam up everyone who, you know, collected in a certain area, and she gathered

821
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:39,220
 quite a few followers, and on Christmas Eve, they all went to this area to be beamed up

822
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:44,220
 by a flying saucer, and they sung some Christmas carols, and the flying saucer didn't come.

823
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:48,100
 And what she didn't realise was that her group had been infiltrated by this really famous

824
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:53,360
 psychologist called Festinger, who I think is the leading psychologist on cognitive dissonance,

825
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,740
 who was looking at how, how do you justify that?

826
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:59,940
 And they justified it by saying the aliens were so impressed at their sign of devotion that

827
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:02,140
 they decided not to destroy Earth after all.

828
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:03,940
 Oh, that is really an excuse.

829
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:05,180
 Went away again, yeah.

830
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:09,720
 And so I think on Twitter about a while ago, which I love, which is there was a dystopian

831
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:14,860
 features book convention, and someone overheard someone saying, excuse me, is this the cue

832
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:15,860
 for the apocalypse?

833
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:16,860
 One of the events?

834
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:17,860
 I just think it's so British.

835
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:18,860
 Yeah, yeah.

836
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:19,860
 The cue for the apocalypse.

837
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:23,260
 You know Newton used to give lectures to lecture theatres.

838
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:25,260
 Good to be.

839
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:30,740
 Actually, someone's done a study on kind of mentally what famous scientists are like, and that

840
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:35,180
 someone is Simon Baron Cohen, who's a really famous neuroscientist, and he's also Sasha

841
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:40,300
 Baron Cohen's cousin, but this is looking into how they display signs of autism, and it

842
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:43,740
 seems like Newton found it really hard to connect to other people, and he gave really

843
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:48,100
 boring lectures, he didn't care about lecturing, he just wanted to be alone in his attic studying,

844
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:51,700
 so people tended not to go, and if no one went, he'd just give the lecture anyway to an

845
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:52,700
 empty room.

846
00:37:52,700 --> 00:38:01,900
 And that's it for this week's episode.

847
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:06,820
 You'll notice our abrupt ending there, that was because Alex Bell came in to tell us that

848
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:12,340
 the entire road that we work on had been evacuated, except for us, because we were busy making

849
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:16,180
 a podcast talking about the end of the world.

850
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:19,480
 So we had to leave the building immediately, also incidentally at the same time, Mount

851
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:24,800
 Antner erupted, so yeah, but that's it, that's our show, that's all of our facts, thank you

852
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,040
 so much for listening.

853
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:29,400
 If you want to get in contact with any of us about the things we've said over the course

854
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:33,680
 of this podcast, we can be found on our Twitter accounts, I'm on @Sriberland, and...

855
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:41,960

856
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:46,520

857

 We'll see you again next week, goodbye.
