1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:16,200
 - We're basically just a little fact show

3
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,800
 where we just tell each other little facts

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:20,800
 and then we go home.

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,820
 That's what you've come to tonight.

6
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,280
 They're not shitty facts though.

7
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,480
 I think everyone here knows that.

8
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,680
 They're kind of like in the,

9
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,480
 it's not just like, oh, there's an interesting like,

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,160
 you know, rising the rates of interest right now.

11
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,640
 It's kind of, there's a few people like,

12
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,720
 I'd love to hear that show.

13
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,760
 No, they're kind of like, we love the juicy facts.

14
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,600
 The little facts that like,

15
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,080
 give you that little orgasmic shiver

16
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,240
 where you're like, oh God.

17
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:44,360
 So, is that literally just me?

18
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,400
 - It's just you then.

19
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,240
 - Yes.

20
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,080
 - Just you.

21
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:47,920
 - Oh wow, okay.

22
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,260
 James, you said you had a fact that you were-

23
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,800
 - I'll give you a fact.

24
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,240
 Prince William is exempt from the Data Protection Act,

25
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,240
 the Wildlife and Countryside Act,

26
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,080
 and the Nuclear Explosions Act,

27
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,200
 which means he is allowed to set off a nuclear bomb,

28
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,880
 share your email address with third parties,

29
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,760
 and shoot a great crested newt with a machine gun.

30
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,560
 (all laughing)

31
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,200
 If he wants.

32
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,040
 - That's great.

33
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:13,880
 - Living the dream.

34
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:14,720
 - That's amazing.

35
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,560
 All right, let's do this.

36
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,400
 You guys ready?

37
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,720
 (all cheering)

38
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,760
 Let's record a show.

39
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,360
 Roll the theme tune.

40
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,040
 - Do you know what kills most bacteria in the world?

41
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,120
 - Metal.

42
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,460
 - Nope.

43
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,040
 - Is it death hole, like 99.5?

44
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,520
 - Death hole, good guess, no.

45
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,960
 As in not humans.

46
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,240
 - Is it just old age?

47
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,080
 - Old age?

48
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,560
 No, it's not old age.

49
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,040
 - So what do you mean not humans?

50
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,320
 - Well, so try thinking of something that's not a human.

51
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,440
 - Is it a dragonfly?

52
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,880
 - No, it's not dragonflies.

53
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,960
 It is viruses.

54
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,440
 Viruses called bacteriophages.

55
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,960
 Oh, it's viruses, blah, blah, blah.

56
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:51,000
 But here's the really interesting thing about that, right?

57
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,320
 They destroy 40% of all bacteria

58
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,820
 in the ocean every day.

59
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,140
 - 40% of the ocean every day.

60
00:01:59,140 --> 00:01:59,980
 - What?

61
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:03,100
 - So if you take all the bacteria in the ocean on a day,

62
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,020
 40% of them won't be there the next day

63
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,420
 because they've been eaten by viruses.

64
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:10,180
 And of course they keep making more and more bacteria.

65
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:12,140
 Imagine if all the viruses disappeared.

66
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:14,220
 - This is, imagine I'm frustrating the viruses.

67
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,540
 This is the real Sisyphian task, isn't it?

68
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:19,380
 We've literally done almost half of, oh God, they're back.

69
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,220
 (all laughing)

70
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,040
 - We'll get rid of them all this time.

71
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,380
 - They're eating them, right?

72
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,720
 - They're eating them, aren't they?

73
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,140
 When you come back to the fridge and it's full again,

74
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,380
 you're like, whoa.

75
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:30,060
 - Yeah, they do phages eat.

76
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,820
 - It is, but it's not eating like we're eating, is it?

77
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,380
 There's no plates and knives and forks.

78
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,660
 - That is a huge number.

79
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:36,500
 - That is insane.

80
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,340
 - That's insane.

81
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,580
 - Is it totally equilibrium or is there like a clean time

82
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,440
 to go each day, like at the end of the day,

83
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,280
 the users don't know?

84
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,620
 (all laughing)

85
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:44,760
 - And it regenerates at midnight,

86
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,540
 like shutting back into a pumpkin.

87
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:49,700
 - I think they do work with the days and nights

88
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,340
 and stuff like that to a certain extent.

89
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:55,480
 But on average, a trillion, trillion viruses

90
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:59,140
 will infect bacteria in the ocean every second.

91
00:02:59,140 --> 00:02:59,980
 - Wow.

92
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:00,820
 - Whoa.

93
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,200
 - We need to teach them to eat plastic.

94
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,040
 - That's a good idea.

95
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,000
 - Yeah, really good idea.

96
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,920
 - I think actually there are,

97
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,760
 I think it's bacteria,

98
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,080
 the scientists are trying to get to eat plastic

99
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,560
 and then you release it and then what could go wrong?

100
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,400
 - Yeah.

101
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,320
 (all laughing)

102
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,600
 - I wonder if there's ever been a day where it just,

103
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,640
 there was too much eating, you know,

104
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,780
 where they just got to like 70% or like something just

105
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,280
 ridiculous, one harvest day.

106
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,760
 - Or a day when the viruses are like,

107
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,920
 oh, it's, you know, virus independence day.

108
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,440
 We're not going to do anything today.

109
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,280
 - Yes.

110
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,600
 - Or Lent, virus Lent.

111
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,440
 (all laughing)

112
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,680
 - Yeah, exactly.

113
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,320
 - So I came across when researching for this fact,

114
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,840
 a website called faxcore.com.

115
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,500
 No, it's not a fax porn site.

116
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,880
 (all laughing)

117
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,080
 It basically provides sort of

118
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,320
 modern day cloud faxing services,

119
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,760
 but it has a page on fax news,

120
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,680
 which seems to be really well researched.

121
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,780
 There's Sam Minton who's doing a great job.

122
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,740
 Just trawling through local newspapers for fax news.

123
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:58,380
 So they reported on a blimpy sandwich shop,

124
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,460
 I think it's a sandwich chain in America,

125
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,700
 in New Jersey in 2015,

126
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,300
 which was being sued by an auto parts repair place

127
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,420
 for sending unwanted fax promotions.

128
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,900
 So they sent thousands and thousands of promotions.

129
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,020
 In, also in 2016, the Milwaukee Bucks,

130
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:15,060
 who were a basketball team,

131
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,860
 ran a promotion saying,

132
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:19,300
 if you want to meet Coolio and Glenn Robinson,

133
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,080
 who I think was a basketballer in the '90s,

134
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:24,000
 and he, it was like a throwback to the '90s.

135
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,840
 So they were like,

136
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,800
 if you want to meet these two famous people,

137
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,160
 throwback to the '90s,

138
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,280
 why don't you fax us to this number?

139
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,640
 And they expected to only get about three faxes,

140
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,240
 'cause no one has a fax machine.

141
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,720
 - Anybody likes Coolio,

142
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,360
 it's just gonna fax after fax, right?

143
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,040
 - Well, indeed, they had to then put a tweet out saying,

144
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,400
 sorry, we're desperately changing the toner in our machine,

145
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,120
 'cause there's far too many faxes coming through.

146
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,240
 Sorry about this.

147
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,500
 And then one, which sounds incredibly annoying,

148
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,300
 a woman called Ann Bruce in Phoenix, Arizona, in 2015,

149
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,300
 her number, her phone number,

150
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:58,260
 was accidentally printed on a doctor's business card

151
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,060
 as his fax number,

152
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,380
 'cause doctors still use faxes quite a long way

153
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,060
 beyond ordinary people.

154
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:06,380
 And so she was just getting woken up

155
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,460
 all hours of the night.

156
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,940
 He'd be on call all hours of the night

157
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,700
 by fax machines calling her,

158
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,700
 just constantly picking up her phone to,

159
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,700
 (imitates phone ringing)

160
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:17,920
 (all laughing)

161
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,840
 - Have you read the story about the 2015 fake Goya?

162
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,680
 - What's that?

163
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,600
 - It's just, I actually feel really sorry

164
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,120
 for the con artist in this story.

165
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,440
 So there were these two men who bought a Goya painting,

166
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,400
 I think in 2006, they bought a Goya painting,

167
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,240
 which they thought was real

168
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,600
 and it came with a certificate of authenticity.

169
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,400
 But then, after they paid for some of it,

170
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,040
 like the deposit, it turned out that it was a fake

171
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,880
 and the court ruled that they could keep it,

172
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,960
 but they had to pay the deposit

173
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,320
 'cause they lost quite a lot of money on it.

174
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,700
 So then they decided they would try

175
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,220
 and sell it themselves as a genuine,

176
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,740
 they would try and con someone to buy it

177
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:50,900
 to get the money back.

178
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,260
 When they successfully got somebody

179
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:56,500
 to say they were gonna pay for it,

180
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,500
 and they had a middleman who was a broker

181
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,460
 and they gave that middleman 300,000 euros

182
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,300
 to kind of do the deal.

183
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:05,060
 So they gave him 300,000 pounds of money that they borrowed.

184
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:08,860
 They then received 1.7 million Swiss francs from the buyer,

185
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:11,300
 but that money turned out to be fake.

186
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,620
 So they were there.

187
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,400
 - Is this all a weird game of Monopoly?

188
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,240
 - It's amazing.

189
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,320
 But then they got arrested in the airport

190
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,100
 for possessing fake money.

191
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:22,720
 So then they basically sold a fake goya for fake money,

192
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,880
 but accidentally used real money as a transaction.

193
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,680
 - Yeah, so they lost genuine 300,000.

194
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,560
 - So much money, I feel so bad for them, yeah.

195
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,040
 - The money was photocopied.

196
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,560
 - Yeah, it was so badly forged.

197
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,320
 I can't believe that even, I suppose,

198
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,440
 you just, when you get a hand at a suitcase of money,

199
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,160
 like you just like open and close.

200
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,000
 And I always learn from Hustle

201
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,680
 that you put real money on the very top.

202
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,520
 So that like the top where every money is real.

203
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,940
 - Maybe they did that, that's possible.

204
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:46,180
 - I think if you are trying to sell a fake goya,

205
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:48,500
 then check some of the middle notes.

206
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,160
 - Hmm, yeah, that's true.

207
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,300
 That's a good tip.

208
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,140
 - Good tip.

209
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,860
 - Good very niche piece of advice.

210
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:58,820
 - Just because we can't leave a fact alone

211
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,820
 without mentioning a penis fact in it,

212
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,580
 if there is a penis fact to be had in it.

213
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:03,420
 - Oh, okay.

214
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,660
 - So I think we should just say

215
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:08,180
 that he had a very close friend goya called Martin Zappete,

216
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:10,960
 who, it's always confusing, I suppose,

217
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,660
 when you read exchanges of letters between men,

218
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,380
 which are very affectionate in the olden days.

219
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:16,260
 And critics always say,

220
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,740
 this relationship has been hugely misinterpreted,

221
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,660
 and people have attributed homosexuality to it

222
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,500
 when it's not.

223
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,520
 - It's just good friends, they're just good friends.

224
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,020
 - Exactly, why are we insisting, like, these letters?

225
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,720
 So they really loved each other

226
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,500
 in whatever way you choose to believe.

227
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,500
 And they swapped dick pics, which is a perp,

228
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,180
 I'm sure you, James and Dan, do that often.

229
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,020
 - Was it?

230
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:39,580
 Yeah, but mine are Saturn devouring Dan's dick.

231
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,600
 (all laughing)

232
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,800
 - Mine is a dog being drowned by James's dick.

233
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,480
 (all laughing)

234
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,680
 - Oh, that didn't even work.

235
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,160
 Okay, so there was this guy,

236
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,840
 he was a merchant, Martin Zappete,

237
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,000
 and we just have a letter from goya to him saying,

238
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,040
 dear, and then in place of his name,

239
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,640
 there's just a picture of a penis.

240
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,400
 (all laughing)

241
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,800
 - That could be a slug.

242
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,120
 - So he would draw just a little cock and balls,

243
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:05,960
 kind of thing.

244
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,800
 - He drew a little one, but then he went on to say--

245
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,540
 - That must have been a burn, a little one.

246
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,140
 - I think it was meant to be complimentary,

247
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,900
 because then, and it was obviously in response

248
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,460
 to a letter that he'd received from Martin,

249
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,140
 and in response to the letter he'd received,

250
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:22,080
 he said, Jesus Christ, what an almighty member.

251
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,420
 (all laughing)

252
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,700
 The Spanish is slightly, like there's no direct translation,

253
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,100
 but what an almighty member.

254
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,500
 And then he said, you must have drawn that from life,

255
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,180
 as in you must have been drawing your own penis.

256
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,540
 - You know, like when you're at school

257
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:35,180
 and you draw around your hands to make like hand prints,

258
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:36,500
 do you think that's what he was doing?

259
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,420
 - That's what exactly he said.

260
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:39,660
 - He said, I think you've traced around your own penis.

261
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:40,500
 - Really?

262
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,300
 - 'Cause otherwise you're an amazing artist.

263
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:45,340
 And then he said, what a pity, otherwise Goya,

264
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,180
 you're an amazing artist.

265
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,500
 (all laughing)

266
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,700
 - I'd love to come around and do a rubbing one.

267
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,280
 (all laughing)

268
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:56,580
 It's the other, this is Goya writing it.

269
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,420
 - I'm Goya writing it.

270
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,740
 - The artist, he's like, and then he said,

271
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:02,260
 and he starts referring to the penis picture as a man.

272
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:04,700
 So he says, what a pity he cannot be exhibited

273
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,780
 to the public so that he could be tried out

274
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,900
 and the lady he fits best can get to keep him.

275
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:10,740
 And--

276
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:11,940
 - This is locker room chat, isn't it?

277
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,140
 - Yeah, this is, oh, sorry, Trump.

278
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,580
 (all laughing)

279
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:17,300
 - It's lads banter, isn't it?

280
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:20,380
 Although, to be fair, to be fair to the boys, boys, boys,

281
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:23,820
 they also exchange drawings of female genitalia as well.

282
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,340
 Equal rights for all genitals.

283
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,980
 - How do you trace around that?

284
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:29,740
 (all laughing)

285
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,060
 - I'll show you how she was jimmed.

286
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,460
 (all laughing)

287
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,460
 - It's more of a potato print, I think.

288
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:37,040
 (all laughing)

289
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:46,500
 - What did it do to the industry

290
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,140
 once people were no longer selling their piss?

291
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,380
 - Bad news for the piss industry.

292
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,700
 - Yeah, exactly.

293
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:54,620
 - Pissful, pissful, exactly.

294
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:55,780
 - Do you know that in France,

295
00:09:55,780 --> 00:10:00,780
 they call Pisoise sometimes Vespasians

296
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:03,660
 because Vespasian, the Roman emperor,

297
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:06,540
 taxed urine because they could use it

298
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:07,900
 in the tanning industry and various other things.

299
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:08,740
 - They use it in everything,

300
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:09,580
 they're obsessed with it.

301
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,400
 - Yeah, exactly.

302
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:15,300
 And because he became synonymous with taxing urine,

303
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,700
 people called the urinals Vespasians,

304
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,660
 and it's still in France,

305
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,940
 they're called that sometimes today.

306
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:20,780
 - That's quite cool.

307
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,180
 - That's like, like, Boris Bikes, is like--

308
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,020
 - Bit like that, yeah.

309
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,220
 - He's gonna seem to have the name Boris attached.

310
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,740
 - If that still is the name in 2,000 years, yeah.

311
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,380
 Do you think separate of Vespasian,

312
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,580
 is separate of Vespasian happy

313
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:32,900
 that that's his legacy 2,000 years into the future?

314
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,460
 - It's quite grumpy anyway, Vespasian, I think.

315
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,540
 - It's not gonna cheer him up, is it?

316
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,220
 Well, do you know, your name has remained

317
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,780
 in the urinals of Paris.

318
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:40,620
 - Didn't he?

319
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:41,460
 Was he the one who built the Colosseum?

320
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:42,300
 - It's kind of annoying.

321
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,300
 - He was the one who started

322
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,940
 the building of the Colosseum, yeah.

323
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:45,780
 - That is frustrating,

324
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:46,820
 'cause I think that's a real move

325
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:47,820
 towards your legacy there,

326
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,020
 to be like, "Ah, this is what we were running for."

327
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:50,860
 And then there's like--

328
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,740
 - Everyone's calling toilets after me.

329
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,580
 I'm gonna build this massive Colosseum.

330
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:55,420
 This will do it.

331
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,300
 - We'll be in the shape of a massive toilet, then.

332
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,940
 (laughing)

333
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:00,780
 - That's cool.

334
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:01,620
 - Yeah, pretty sweet.

335
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:04,460
 - And then there's huge efforts in America

336
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:08,700
 for cyberattacking happens so much more than I realized.

337
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,260
 And so say like banks.

338
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,140
 Banks have whole, basically, war rooms

339
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:14,060
 in bunkers that are dedicated

340
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,380
 in order to stop cyberattacks.

341
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:16,980
 - I mean, like closely under attack as well.

342
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,500
 - So per day, this is from a few years ago,

343
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,060
 per day they would get 267,000 attacks.

344
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,700
 So it's an attack every three seconds

345
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,220
 where someone's trying to steal money.

346
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,260
 Billions of dollars successfully

347
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,580
 would get stolen in the past.

348
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:32,660
 And so this was set up to stop that.

349
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:33,740
 In America, at one point,

350
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:36,140
 they hired up to 2,000 new personnel

351
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:38,180
 to deal with cyberattacks within the government.

352
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:40,380
 And this was under FBI director James Comey

353
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,020
 when he was in charge there.

354
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,660
 And the biggest problem that he faces

355
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,740
 is that the people who were best suited

356
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:48,100
 for fixing cybercrime and monitoring it

357
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,660
 were all weed smokers.

358
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:52,700
 And so you can't hire someone into the FBI

359
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:53,860
 if they smoke weed.

360
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,700
 It's part of the screening process

361
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:56,980
 to not allow them to do it.

362
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:59,180
 There's a rumor that there's a lot of agencies

363
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:02,020
 that hire a lot of Mormons at a sort of,

364
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:04,180
 they say because they're so easy to screen.

365
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,700
 I think that's just a rumor that one.

366
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,660
 But this was a real thing.

367
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,260
 And so Comey had to say,

368
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,140
 we've got to let the weed smokers in

369
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:12,420
 because we need them, they're the best in the world.

370
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,980
 So they, yeah, relax the law.

371
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,660
 So do apply if you smoke weed.

372
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:16,500
 - Really?

373
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,900
 - You will get past the first screening.

374
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,780
 We might not make it through in the end, you know.

375
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:20,620
 - So now if you want--

376
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,460
 - 'Cause you can't remember anything.

377
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,700
 (laughing)

378
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:28,540
 - Steal, just very quickly on sort of steal generally.

379
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,300
 I didn't appreciate

380
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:33,260
 what an extraordinary recyclable object it is

381
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:35,660
 and how much we do recycle it around the world.

382
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,140
 And that's really impressive.

383
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,780
 - Like in buildings and stuff, right?

384
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,260
 - In buildings, yeah, exactly.

385
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,620
 Particularly buildings that mostly recyclable.

386
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,900
 If you take down a building, the metal can be reused.

387
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:47,900
 And in fact, one of the things of, you know,

388
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,620
 the Twin Towers when it went down,

389
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,420
 a lot of that metal was reused.

390
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:54,100
 In various, yeah, if you go to places like,

391
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,100
 I don't know, if you go to India,

392
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,580
 you're gonna find a college that has been built

393
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,740
 using the steel, yeah, you'll find--

394
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,020
 - Did they also make a ship?

395
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,060
 - The USS New York?

396
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:03,940
 - The USS New York, it's so interesting.

397
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:05,260
 There is this ship out there

398
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:08,100
 where they have in the ship itself,

399
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,220
 there's a steel plate which is on display

400
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,660
 above the most used passageway

401
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,300
 and they have a firefighters helmet there.

402
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:16,300
 So all the sailors are reminded of the first responders.

403
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,220
 Every day the chaplain on that ship

404
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:21,020
 will pick a name of someone who died in the terrorist attack

405
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,660
 and they will read them as part of their prayers

406
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,020
 so that everyone remembers.

407
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,660
 But the bow of the ship itself

408
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:28,180
 is using the steel from the building as well.

409
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:31,340
 So it's a real remembrance ship.

410
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:33,340
 - And it's like the big sort of wires

411
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,460
 that you get in reinforced concrete, isn't it?

412
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:36,460
 The steel, I think.

413
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:37,500
 - Right. - Is that right?

414
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,340
 I'm pretty sure.

415
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,700
 - I think the, I don't know if it is interesting,

416
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,860
 but the key reason why concrete,

417
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:44,180
 like steel reinforced concrete works as a thing

418
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:46,580
 is because the heat coefficient of steel and concrete

419
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,980
 is the same so that when concrete expands in heat,

420
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:51,060
 concrete and steel expands by the same amount

421
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,180
 because they're kind of infused together

422
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:54,220
 so they need to grow and shrink at the same rate.

423
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,540
 That is the most interesting

424
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,260
 and at the same time, the most dull thing.

425
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,500
 - It's the most interesting boring thing

426
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,020
 I've ever thought about, yeah.

427
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,220
 - I think you've got to be careful

428
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,980
 tossing the word "coefficient" into it.

429
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:06,540
 It's so interesting, it's so nice of you, it's brilliant.

430
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,180
 - This is suddenly the first stamp

431
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,540
 where there's a naked woman on a stamp

432
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:13,180
 and in American, this is 1959, they banned it.

433
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:15,580
 A Time Magazine wrote, "An indecent picture is bad enough,

434
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:18,460
 but a postage stamp whose backside must be licked,

435
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:21,940
 millions of innocent children collect stamps."

436
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:24,100
 And so, yeah, and there were certain places

437
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,660
 that kind of allowed it in America

438
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,980
 'cause obviously so many different states,

439
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,700
 it's not one all-consuming thing,

440
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,020
 but eventually they did ban it entirely.

441
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,380
 - But it didn't have a picture of her bum

442
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:32,780
 on the back that you could lick, did it?

443
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:33,620
 - No.

444
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:34,460
 - It's just a normal stamp.

445
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:36,500
 - It would be so good if stamps had the back

446
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,340
 of the person's head on the other side.

447
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,180
 - Yeah.

448
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,020
 - Why don't they do that?

449
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:42,580
 - And if like Prince, King Prince Charles,

450
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,940
 when they do his stamps, if they haven't already,

451
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:48,620
 then he has a sort of haptic device on the back of his head

452
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:51,220
 that whenever anyone licks a stamp, he feels the lick.

453
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,620
 (all laughing)

454
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:54,780
 - Very nice, wouldn't it?

455
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,060
 - For whom?

456
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:58,700
 - Nice is not, like, it's many things, it's not nice.

457
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,780
 (all laughing)

458
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:02,380
 - Can I give you some metallurgy words

459
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:03,820
 and see if you can guess what they are?

460
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,300
 - Yes.

461
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,460
 - Bottom running.

462
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:07,300
 - Bottom running.

463
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,900
 - That was when people tried to poo on steel to turn in.

464
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,620
 (all laughing)

465
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:12,940
 - You've got to try these things.

466
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:15,700
 - Is that wire that gets fed through the oceans

467
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:18,020
 to connect up internet in terms of the bottom?

468
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,380
 - No, 'cause they don't run them

469
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,260
 through the ground bottom, they drop them,

470
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:24,620
 they lay them, they lay them, that's always laying.

471
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:25,460
 - So what is it?

472
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,740
 - Oh, sorry.

473
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:28,900
 All the answers are gonna be really boring.

474
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,020
 It's filling a mould cavity from the bottom

475
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,860
 by means of gates from another channel

476
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,860
 through which molten metal is passed

477
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,300
 from one receptacle to another.

478
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,420
 - I did know that, actually.

479
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:40,460
 - Does anyone know what the MF temperature is?

480
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:42,100
 - MF temperature. - Oh, come on.

481
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,060
 - The motherfucking temperature!

482
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:46,580
 (all laughing)

483
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:47,940
 - It is the temperature at which

484
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:50,860
 martinsite formation finishes, of course.

485
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,580
 Martinsite being a very hard form

486
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:54,980
 of steel crystalline structure.

487
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:55,900
 - I hate this show.

488
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,460
 (all laughing)

489
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,180
 - Do you know what a slag trap is?

490
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:01,620
 (all laughing)

491
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:02,700
 - You're looking at him!

492
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,340
 (all laughing)

493
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,180
 - Sorry.

494
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,500
 (all laughing)

495
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,340
 - It's so horrible.

496
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:10,620
 (all laughing)

497
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:13,060
 - It's an extrusion in the gating or runner system

498
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,860
 in a mould for the purpose of preventing

499
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:17,940
 molten slag particles from entering the mould cavity.

500
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:20,060
 I got a lot more of these, but let's move on.

501
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:20,900
 - Are you sure?

502
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,460
 - Yeah, 'cause the joke answers are fun,

503
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:23,620
 but then you actually have to keep

504
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,900
 in the responses. - Yeah, absolutely.

505
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,540
 I found an interesting thing that a loose bit of wire

506
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,900
 is responsible for.

507
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:32,380
 Great innovation in the world.

508
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:36,380
 This is 1962, the year after the Goya is stolen

509
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:40,420
 from the museum, and basically there was a factory

510
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,820
 that, it used to be that if you put people on hold

511
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:45,380
 on a phone call, it would just be absolute silence, right?

512
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:48,540
 And so this guy had it as factory.

513
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,660
 There happened to be when he put it on hold,

514
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,100
 there was just a random loose wire

515
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,380
 that was touching a steel girder

516
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,060
 that turned it into a transmitter.

517
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:58,700
 And basically it was tuning in a local radio station.

518
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,820
 And so anytime someone went on hold,

519
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,540
 they found themselves listening to music

520
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,780
 from this radio station.

521
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,480
 And he thought this was gonna be incredibly annoying,

522
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,500
 but every time the people who were left waiting for ages

523
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,020
 would come back on, they'd say,

524
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:10,860
 "Oh, that was really nice.

525
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:11,700
 "No, it was pleasant.

526
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,700
 "I didn't actually notice time passing by."

527
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,260
 So this guy, Albert Levy,

528
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:17,300
 who should never have invented this technology,

529
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:21,220
 patented basically hold music as a signal.

530
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,980
 - Just because Andy's not here,

531
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,220
 and we all know what he would say at this point.

532
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,980
 Oh, all these things that claim

533
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:30,100
 to be accidentally invented, definitely one,

534
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,380
 it's just made up on this.

535
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,060
 - I'm sorry, miss, through some steel

536
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:35,900
 in the pilot invented wire.

537
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,860
 - Also, can Andy smoking 80 cigarettes a day now?

538
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,700
 - Just wanna compliment the impression there.

539
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,540
 - I think he's spot on.

540
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,780
 - I've been really honing it.

541
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,380
 Yeah, that's actually, for the listeners,

542
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,500
 that's what he talks like when he's not on the podcast.

543
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,020
 (all laughing)

544
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:51,340
 - I read about Benjamin Franklin's 40 essay.

545
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,420
 - Oh yeah.

546
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:54,220
 - So it was in 1781, he wrote an essay,

547
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,860
 which is either known as

548
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,420
 to the Royal Academy of Farting,

549
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:59,940
 or Fart Proudly, as it's snappier title.

550
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:02,820
 And it was a submission to the Royal Academy of Brussels,

551
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:03,860
 but he never actually sent it,

552
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:06,340
 but it was kind of like his sort of slamming back

553
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:10,140
 at the sort of, he saw it as like sort of impractical questions

554
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,100
 that scientists were looking at.

555
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,340
 And he's like, well, he might as well look into

556
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:14,620
 how we stop our fart smelling.

557
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,220
 But I was reading what he was saying.

558
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,460
 And if I as part of this, he,

559
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:20,700
 so he didn't send in, he just gave it to his friends.

560
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,460
 But as part of it, he talks about

561
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,220
 how you can change the smell if you're a wee.

562
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,100
 So if we've done on QI,

563
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,540
 the asparagus makes your wee smell kind of weird.

564
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,940
 And Franklin says, if you use turpentine,

565
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,460
 it makes your wee smell good.

566
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,100
 - What, if you drink turpentine?

567
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,700
 - Yes, there are problems with this plan.

568
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:36,540
 (all laughing)

569
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,060
 - I don't think you're gonna be around to smell it.

570
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:38,980
 - Well, you're not supposed to,

571
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,260
 but apparently it does work.

572
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:42,540
 Don't try this at home, and ever.

573
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:44,500
 But it makes it smell with violets.

574
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,340
 Apparently it does.

575
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,180
 - Does it?

576
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:48,900
 - Well, does turpentine mean what I think they mean?

577
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,340
 So I looked up turpentine to check.

578
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,660
 And turpentine, Britannica says,

579
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:56,180
 clear a clear oily liquid that's more flammable

580
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:58,020
 and more toxic than white spirits.

581
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,700
 - Yeah, that's what I thought.

582
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,380
 - But I think they did use to use it medicinally.

583
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,980
 'Cause Britannica also says it has a hot,

584
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,180
 disagreeable taste,

585
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,740
 which just people have been trying.

586
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,860
 - I think they did use it medicinally,

587
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:10,060
 but absolutely don't do that.

588
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,420
 - No, and I think I much rather have wee

589
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,180
 that smells normal than drink turpentine.

590
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:15,220
 - Yeah, just buy some violets.

591
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,820
 Put them in the loo every time you go.

592
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,060
 - Get air freshener, you're right.

593
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,380
 And much less hazardous.

594
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,820
 - That's funny, 'cause I was reading about Franklin

595
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,420
 for the last fact on clubs,

596
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:26,100
 'cause he founded an intellectual literary society

597
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,460
 which sounded brilliant.

598
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,820
 And they met every week.

599
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,860
 And the idea was about exploring

600
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:34,060
 moral philosophical questions of natural philosophy,

601
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:36,700
 changing policy, improving the world.

602
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,340
 And I wonder if this whole,

603
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,540
 that it was a bit of an off day at the reading group,

604
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:41,740
 where they came up with the whole,

605
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:44,540
 should we write to someone about fart-stopping farts?

606
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:46,260
 (laughing)

607
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,580
 - Say Shonagun.

608
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:50,260
 - She writes a lot about her affairs in the book.

609
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,820
 There were a lot of men in her life.

610
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,500
 And I was reading this great article

611
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,580
 by a guy called David Greer,

612
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:56,220
 who was saying a lot of people then go to it

613
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,140
 thinking the pillow book affairs.

614
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,780
 This is gonna be like old school erotica.

615
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:01,620
 And you get to it.

616
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:04,660
 And there's really nothing in there that's erotic in any way.

617
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:07,540
 There's very, very subtle lines.

618
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,980
 But the men who she has the affairs with

619
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:10,860
 do appear in the book,

620
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,420
 but they largely appear in a list

621
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,300
 called things that irritate me.

622
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,020
 And it's just knocking them about.

623
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:18,820
 They're snoring, they're stumbling around.

624
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,460
 You know, like they're just being idiots generally.

625
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,380
 - They're leaving in a rush in the morning.

626
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,420
 Take note, modern day men.

627
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:26,300
 She's like a man who leaps out of bed

628
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,340
 after you've shagged him,

629
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:28,860
 puts on his clothes and runs out the door.

630
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,580
 Not cool guys.

631
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:32,540
 - They get turned into a sex manual.

632
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:33,380
 - Did it?

633
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,220
 - Yeah.

634
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:37,660
 And picture books and letter writing manuals,

635
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:38,860
 textbooks, stuff like that.

636
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:40,340
 - At the same time or different months.

637
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:42,620
 (laughing)

638
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:45,420
 - Yeah, so this was basically in the thousand years

639
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:47,820
 subsequently because it was such a famous book.

640
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:51,100
 They would kind of adapt it into various different things.

641
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,420
 - Like fan fiction kind of thing.

642
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:54,820
 - Kind of, if you need to write a sex manual

643
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,500
 and you're like, okay, well, how am I gonna start?

644
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,660
 They're like, well, let's start with this really famous thing

645
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,540
 and then take bits of that

646
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:03,700
 and then tell people how to have sex.

647
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,660
 - I definitely read something which I wouldn't say

648
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,020
 if it had been written in the modern day

649
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:09,660
 'cause it's so gross, but it was written in 1714.

650
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,100
 So it feels less gross,

651
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,700
 but which takes Seanagan, the character of Seanagan

652
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:16,380
 and is like a fan fiction and puts her in a story

653
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:19,660
 where she's being had sex with from behind

654
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,780
 while her brother looks on masturbating.

655
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,820
 - Oh, okay.

656
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:23,660
 - Yeah, that's fine.

657
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:25,700
 - It's quite Game of Thrones-y, isn't it?

658
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,620
 - Yeah, maybe that's what Game of Thrones is based on.

659
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,220
 Does that happen in Game of Thrones?

660
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,660
 - There's incest and there's shagging and all that stuff.

661
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:32,500
 - Lots of sex, yeah.

662
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,900
 - Is there incest in Game of Thrones?

663
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,660
 - Yeah, I think that's one of the main bits.

664
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:38,060
 (laughing)

665
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:39,660
 - I gotta watch it one of these days.

666
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,300
 - Yeah, it's kind of episode one, series one,

667
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,140
 I think, all those.

668
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,580
 (laughing)

669
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:44,420
 - Free titles.

670
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:46,460
 (laughing)

671
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,380
 - Just very quickly on the fact

672
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,980
 that the book loops in on itself.

673
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:53,100
 I just went down a bit of a loop on that,

674
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,380
 just finding other versions of it.

675
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:57,100
 And so one famous version of it

676
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,440
 is the Pink Floyd album, The Wall,

677
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,620
 which ends on the same wording that the album begins on.

678
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:05,940
 So in theory, you can just play it in one continuous loop.

679
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,820
 But the one that seems most exciting to me,

680
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:10,180
 which hasn't happened, but Al Jean,

681
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:13,540
 who is an executive producer and writer for The Simpsons,

682
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,620
 he has said that if he has it his way,

683
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:17,500
 that's how The Simpsons will end.

684
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,340
 The final scene will loop back

685
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:21,820
 into the very opening scene of The Simpsons

686
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,860
 to show that no time has passed.

687
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:25,740
 - That's very cool, but they looked very different

688
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:26,580
 in the first series.

689
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,140
 - Exactly, and the voices were very different and so on.

690
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:31,660
 - They go through like a magic mirror and then be like.

691
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:33,900
 - I think there'll be a Doctor Who regeneration episode

692
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:36,140
 weren't there, where it's a really painful

693
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:38,300
 agonizing process and they just turn into these slightly

694
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:40,740
 tweaks, weird versions of themselves.

695
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,900
 - I suppose like the first episode will have begun

696
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,860
 with him jumping out of the school,

697
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,620
 like every episode begins, would it?

698
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,100
 Or do you reckon they'll go back to that?

699
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,300
 Or do you think they'll go back to?

700
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:51,260
 - Oh, there's a pre-title incest scene.

701
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:52,100
 That is...

702
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,340
 (laughing)

703
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:57,900
 - Do you think we should do the final episode of Fish

704
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,940
 should be President Garfield's anus or whatever?

705
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:01,860
 No, it was the sun, the get.

706
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:05,540
 - I actually think it should end with you saying to me,

707
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:07,020
 you know there's no such thing as a fish,

708
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,340
 what do you mean there's no such thing as a fish?

709
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,180
 - Oh, that's a good idea.

710
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,820
 - Yeah, that's the loop, 'cause that's the initial.

711
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:13,660
 - Although we could do that, 'cause our first fact was

712
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:16,020
 that someone dropped a baguette in CERN.

713
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,580
 And CERN obviously there was a theory

714
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,700
 that time travelers would come there.

715
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,380
 So we could finish with me saying,

716
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:24,700
 "Oh, Dan, I'm just going off to visit CERN.

717
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,220
 "Just bought a nice baguette."

718
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:27,700
 (laughing)

719
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:28,540
 - That's great, what did I do?

720
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,380
 - I don't know, guys.

721
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,820
 President Garfield ate stuff through his arse.

722
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:32,380
 I think we're disappearing up our own arse.

723
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:33,780
 (laughing)

724
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:34,620
 Let's get out.

725
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:36,740
 - Here's someone who died.

726
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:38,460
 Justin Schmidt.

727
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,300
 - Who's that?

728
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,140
 - No.

729
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,340
 - You might know him by his nickname.

730
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:42,940
 The King of Sting.

731
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:43,780
 - No.

732
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:44,620
 - Okay.

733
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:46,260
 (laughing)

734
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,980
 - Is he from the Schmidt Pain Index?

735
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,220
 - Yes. - No.

736
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,700
 - He's the guy he came up with.

737
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:51,540
 - The bees.

738
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:52,380
 - A thing we spoke about.

739
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,140
 I think in the first few episodes of this podcast,

740
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:55,420
 he's an amazing guy.

741
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:59,620
 He was stung over his life by 150 different insects.

742
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:00,940
 He filled his home with them

743
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:03,300
 so that he could feel what it was like

744
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,140
 to be stung by each of them.

745
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:06,940
 And then he wrote down how painful it was.

746
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:07,780
 - Yeah.

747
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,940
 - And he came up with this incredible,

748
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,660
 these beautiful writings.

749
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,740
 So a bee, a normal bee is two.

750
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:14,580
 It's called two.

751
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:16,020
 I think it goes up to four.

752
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:16,980
 A bee, quite boring.

753
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,900
 A burning match head lands on your skin.

754
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:19,740
 Yeah.

755
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,060
 (laughing)

756
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:21,900
 Who cares?

757
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,980
 A club-horned wasp, 0.5.

758
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,260
 Rather disappointing.

759
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,900
 (laughing)

760
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,980
 But he collected a lot of quite exotic

761
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:31,740
 and really dangerous insects.

762
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,460
 And it's like, okay, here's one.

763
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:34,700
 The warrior wasp.

764
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,260
 This scores four.

765
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,100
 Torture.

766
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:40,180
 You are chained in the flow of an active volcano.

767
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,900
 Why did I start this list?

768
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:44,140
 (laughing)

769
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:50,300
 - And that was four on the pain index?

770
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,060
 - No, I think four is the maximum.

771
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:53,820
 I'm not sure why, but like that was really high.

772
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:54,660
 - Yeah, okay, right.

773
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,900
 - And he died this year.

774
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:56,740
 - He died this year.

775
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:57,580
 - Such a shame.

776
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:58,420
 - Yeah.

777
00:24:58,420 --> 00:24:59,260
 (laughing)

778
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:01,300
 - I believe he swallowed a fly, didn't he?

779
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:04,540
 (laughing)

780
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:05,380
 - I've actually just realized,

781
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:06,980
 I thought I'd written down a fact about Berlusconi,

782
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,620
 but it was just that he was five foot five,

783
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:10,380
 and it was my way of segwaying into a fact

784
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:13,500
 I thought was very interesting and tangentially related,

785
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:17,740
 which is that this year is the year that we, height-wise,

786
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:21,820
 as humans, caught up with ourselves as hunter-gatherers.

787
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:24,540
 So, the average height of humans

788
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:27,700
 has been gradually going up for a couple of hundred years.

789
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:32,420
 And it, this year, was clarified as five foot 10 for men.

790
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:34,380
 - So, can I just say, after hunter-gatherers,

791
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:36,300
 we shrunk and we're going back up again?

792
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,140
 - Yes, indeed.

793
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:39,140
 And we've just reached hunter-gatherer height again.

794
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:40,980
 'Cause what hunter-gatherers, very tall, very healthy,

795
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:43,220
 ate a nice range of berries and bears or whatever.

796
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:46,940
 And then, we (laughing)

797
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:49,260
 started to know, depending where you lived.

798
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:51,820
 And then, we started farming,

799
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,460
 and our diets got quite a lot worse,

800
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,780
 'cause it was like all monocultures.

801
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:55,620
 - Just eating grain.

802
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:56,460
 - And just eating grain,

803
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,780
 exactly, and all hunched over with the labour.

804
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:00,500
 And we started working much harder.

805
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,820
 And so, we shrunk.

806
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:03,700
 And I think 4,000 years ago,

807
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,340
 the average height was five foot four.

808
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:07,500
 So, Berlusconi, five foot five.

809
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,540
 He would have fitted right here.

810
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:10,580
 He would have been tall 4,000 years ago.

811
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:11,820
 But he wasn't today.

812
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:14,460
 And anyway, now we've made it up back to hunter-gatherer height.

813
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:15,300
 - That's nice.

814
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,140
 - Isn't it?

815
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:16,980
 - Yeah.

816
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,380
 - Can finally reach those high berries.

817
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:20,300
 (laughing)

818
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:23,340
 - Can I just, my favorite promotional story,

819
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:26,500
 Christmas-based, a very specific category,

820
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:29,380
 is, you know, the American dino chain Denny's,

821
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:32,820
 which advertises as always open in America.

822
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,700
 So, it's been going around since the 1950s.

823
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:38,180
 So, and it is open 24/7, 365 days a year,

824
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:40,780
 366 in a leap year, always open.

825
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:42,260
 And then, in 1988,

826
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:45,380
 Denny's decided to give its staff Christmas Day off.

827
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:48,780
 And so, they were gonna close for Christmas Day.

828
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:51,940
 The problem with this was that they had never closed before.

829
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:53,380
 So, none of the doors shut.

830
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:55,780
 (laughing)

831
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,740
 They suddenly found themselves calling locksmiths.

832
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:00,660
 They had to have 700 Denny's chains,

833
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:03,300
 have locksmiths visit to replace the doors and the locks.

834
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,620
 - Whoa, whoa.

835
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:07,200

836
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,780
