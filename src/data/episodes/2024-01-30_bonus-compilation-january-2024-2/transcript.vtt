WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:16.200
 - We're basically just a little fact show

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.800
 where we just tell each other little facts

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:20.800
 and then we go home.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.820
 That's what you've come to tonight.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:24.280
 They're not shitty facts though.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.480
 I think everyone here knows that.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:26.680
 They're kind of like in the,

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.480
 it's not just like, oh, there's an interesting like,

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.160
 you know, rising the rates of interest right now.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.640
 It's kind of, there's a few people like,

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.720
 I'd love to hear that show.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.760
 No, they're kind of like, we love the juicy facts.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:38.600
 The little facts that like,

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.080
 give you that little orgasmic shiver

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.240
 where you're like, oh God.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.360
 So, is that literally just me?

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.400
 - It's just you then.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.240
 - Yes.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.080
 - Just you.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.920
 - Oh wow, okay.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.260
 James, you said you had a fact that you were-

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.800
 - I'll give you a fact.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.240
 Prince William is exempt from the Data Protection Act,

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.240
 the Wildlife and Countryside Act,

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.080
 and the Nuclear Explosions Act,

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.200
 which means he is allowed to set off a nuclear bomb,

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.880
 share your email address with third parties,

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.760
 and shoot a great crested newt with a machine gun.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.560
 (all laughing)

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.200
 If he wants.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.040
 - That's great.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.880
 - Living the dream.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:14.720
 - That's amazing.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:15.560
 All right, let's do this.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.400
 You guys ready?

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.720
 (all cheering)

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:18.760
 Let's record a show.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.360
 Roll the theme tune.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.040
 - Do you know what kills most bacteria in the world?

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.120
 - Metal.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.460
 - Nope.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.040
 - Is it death hole, like 99.5?

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.520
 - Death hole, good guess, no.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.960
 As in not humans.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.240
 - Is it just old age?

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.080
 - Old age?

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.560
 No, it's not old age.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.040
 - So what do you mean not humans?

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.320
 - Well, so try thinking of something that's not a human.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.440
 - Is it a dragonfly?

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.880
 - No, it's not dragonflies.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.960
 It is viruses.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.440
 Viruses called bacteriophages.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.960
 Oh, it's viruses, blah, blah, blah.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.000
 But here's the really interesting thing about that, right?

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.320
 They destroy 40% of all bacteria

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.820
 in the ocean every day.

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.140
 - 40% of the ocean every day.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.980
 - What?

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.100
 - So if you take all the bacteria in the ocean on a day,

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.020
 40% of them won't be there the next day

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.420
 because they've been eaten by viruses.

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.180
 And of course they keep making more and more bacteria.

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:12.140
 Imagine if all the viruses disappeared.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.220
 - This is, imagine I'm frustrating the viruses.

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.540
 This is the real Sisyphian task, isn't it?

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.380
 We've literally done almost half of, oh God, they're back.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.220
 (all laughing)

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.040
 - We'll get rid of them all this time.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.380
 - They're eating them, right?

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.720
 - They're eating them, aren't they?

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.140
 When you come back to the fridge and it's full again,

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.380
 you're like, whoa.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.060
 - Yeah, they do phages eat.

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.820
 - It is, but it's not eating like we're eating, is it?

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.380
 There's no plates and knives and forks.

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:35.660
 - That is a huge number.

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:36.500
 - That is insane.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:37.340
 - That's insane.

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.580
 - Is it totally equilibrium or is there like a clean time

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.440
 to go each day, like at the end of the day,

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.280
 the users don't know?

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.620
 (all laughing)

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:44.760
 - And it regenerates at midnight,

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.540
 like shutting back into a pumpkin.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.700
 - I think they do work with the days and nights

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.340
 and stuff like that to a certain extent.

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.480
 But on average, a trillion, trillion viruses

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.140
 will infect bacteria in the ocean every second.

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.980
 - Wow.

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:00.820
 - Whoa.

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.200
 - We need to teach them to eat plastic.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.040
 - That's a good idea.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.000
 - Yeah, really good idea.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.920
 - I think actually there are,

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:06.760
 I think it's bacteria,

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.080
 the scientists are trying to get to eat plastic

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.560
 and then you release it and then what could go wrong?

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.400
 - Yeah.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.320
 (all laughing)

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.600
 - I wonder if there's ever been a day where it just,

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.640
 there was too much eating, you know,

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.780
 where they just got to like 70% or like something just

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.280
 ridiculous, one harvest day.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.760
 - Or a day when the viruses are like,

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.920
 oh, it's, you know, virus independence day.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.440
 We're not going to do anything today.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.280
 - Yes.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.600
 - Or Lent, virus Lent.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:29.440
 (all laughing)

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.680
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.320
 - So I came across when researching for this fact,

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.840
 a website called faxcore.com.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.500
 No, it's not a fax porn site.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.880
 (all laughing)

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.080
 It basically provides sort of

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.320
 modern day cloud faxing services,

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.760
 but it has a page on fax news,

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.680
 which seems to be really well researched.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.780
 There's Sam Minton who's doing a great job.

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.740
 Just trawling through local newspapers for fax news.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.380
 So they reported on a blimpy sandwich shop,

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.460
 I think it's a sandwich chain in America,

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:02.700
 in New Jersey in 2015,

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.300
 which was being sued by an auto parts repair place

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.420
 for sending unwanted fax promotions.

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.900
 So they sent thousands and thousands of promotions.

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.020
 In, also in 2016, the Milwaukee Bucks,

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.060
 who were a basketball team,

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.860
 ran a promotion saying,

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:19.300
 if you want to meet Coolio and Glenn Robinson,

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.080
 who I think was a basketballer in the '90s,

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.000
 and he, it was like a throwback to the '90s.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.840
 So they were like,

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.800
 if you want to meet these two famous people,

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.160
 throwback to the '90s,

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.280
 why don't you fax us to this number?

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.640
 And they expected to only get about three faxes,

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.240
 'cause no one has a fax machine.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.720
 - Anybody likes Coolio,

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.360
 it's just gonna fax after fax, right?

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.040
 - Well, indeed, they had to then put a tweet out saying,

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.400
 sorry, we're desperately changing the toner in our machine,

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.120
 'cause there's far too many faxes coming through.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.240
 Sorry about this.

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.500
 And then one, which sounds incredibly annoying,

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.300
 a woman called Ann Bruce in Phoenix, Arizona, in 2015,

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.300
 her number, her phone number,

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.260
 was accidentally printed on a doctor's business card

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.060
 as his fax number,

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.380
 'cause doctors still use faxes quite a long way

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.060
 beyond ordinary people.

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.380
 And so she was just getting woken up

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:07.460
 all hours of the night.

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:08.940
 He'd be on call all hours of the night

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.700
 by fax machines calling her,

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:12.700
 just constantly picking up her phone to,

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:14.700
 (imitates phone ringing)

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.920
 (all laughing)

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:20.840
 - Have you read the story about the 2015 fake Goya?

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:21.680
 - What's that?

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.600
 - It's just, I actually feel really sorry

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.120
 for the con artist in this story.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.440
 So there were these two men who bought a Goya painting,

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.400
 I think in 2006, they bought a Goya painting,

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.240
 which they thought was real

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.600
 and it came with a certificate of authenticity.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.400
 But then, after they paid for some of it,

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.040
 like the deposit, it turned out that it was a fake

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:41.880
 and the court ruled that they could keep it,

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:42.960
 but they had to pay the deposit

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.320
 'cause they lost quite a lot of money on it.

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:45.700
 So then they decided they would try

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.220
 and sell it themselves as a genuine,

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:49.740
 they would try and con someone to buy it

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:50.900
 to get the money back.

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.260
 When they successfully got somebody

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.500
 to say they were gonna pay for it,

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.500
 and they had a middleman who was a broker

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.460
 and they gave that middleman 300,000 euros

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:02.300
 to kind of do the deal.

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.060
 So they gave him 300,000 pounds of money that they borrowed.

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.860
 They then received 1.7 million Swiss francs from the buyer,

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:11.300
 but that money turned out to be fake.

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:12.620
 So they were there.

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.400
 - Is this all a weird game of Monopoly?

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:15.240
 - It's amazing.

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.320
 But then they got arrested in the airport

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.100
 for possessing fake money.

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.720
 So then they basically sold a fake goya for fake money,

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.880
 but accidentally used real money as a transaction.

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.680
 - Yeah, so they lost genuine 300,000.

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.560
 - So much money, I feel so bad for them, yeah.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.040
 - The money was photocopied.

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.560
 - Yeah, it was so badly forged.

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.320
 I can't believe that even, I suppose,

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:36.440
 you just, when you get a hand at a suitcase of money,

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.160
 like you just like open and close.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:39.000
 And I always learn from Hustle

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.680
 that you put real money on the very top.

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.520
 So that like the top where every money is real.

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:43.940
 - Maybe they did that, that's possible.

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:46.180
 - I think if you are trying to sell a fake goya,

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:48.500
 then check some of the middle notes.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:50.160
 - Hmm, yeah, that's true.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:51.300
 That's a good tip.

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:52.140
 - Good tip.

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:53.860
 - Good very niche piece of advice.

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:58.820
 - Just because we can't leave a fact alone

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:00.820
 without mentioning a penis fact in it,

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:02.580
 if there is a penis fact to be had in it.

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:03.420
 - Oh, okay.

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:04.660
 - So I think we should just say

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:08.180
 that he had a very close friend goya called Martin Zappete,

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:10.960
 who, it's always confusing, I suppose,

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:12.660
 when you read exchanges of letters between men,

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:14.380
 which are very affectionate in the olden days.

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:16.260
 And critics always say,

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.740
 this relationship has been hugely misinterpreted,

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:20.660
 and people have attributed homosexuality to it

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:21.500
 when it's not.

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:23.520
 - It's just good friends, they're just good friends.

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:27.020
 - Exactly, why are we insisting, like, these letters?

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:28.720
 So they really loved each other

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.500
 in whatever way you choose to believe.

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:33.500
 And they swapped dick pics, which is a perp,

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.180
 I'm sure you, James and Dan, do that often.

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:37.020
 - Was it?

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:39.580
 Yeah, but mine are Saturn devouring Dan's dick.

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:41.600
 (all laughing)

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.800
 - Mine is a dog being drowned by James's dick.

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:46.480
 (all laughing)

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:47.680
 - Oh, that didn't even work.

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:50.160
 Okay, so there was this guy,

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:51.840
 he was a merchant, Martin Zappete,

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:55.000
 and we just have a letter from goya to him saying,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.040
 dear, and then in place of his name,

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:58.640
 there's just a picture of a penis.

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:01.400
 (all laughing)

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:02.800
 - That could be a slug.

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:05.120
 - So he would draw just a little cock and balls,

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:05.960
 kind of thing.

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:08.800
 - He drew a little one, but then he went on to say--

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:10.540
 - That must have been a burn, a little one.

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:12.140
 - I think it was meant to be complimentary,

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:13.900
 because then, and it was obviously in response

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:16.460
 to a letter that he'd received from Martin,

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:18.140
 and in response to the letter he'd received,

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:22.080
 he said, Jesus Christ, what an almighty member.

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:23.420
 (all laughing)

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:25.700
 The Spanish is slightly, like there's no direct translation,

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:27.100
 but what an almighty member.

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:29.500
 And then he said, you must have drawn that from life,

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:31.180
 as in you must have been drawing your own penis.

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:32.540
 - You know, like when you're at school

00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:35.180
 and you draw around your hands to make like hand prints,

00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:36.500
 do you think that's what he was doing?

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:37.420
 - That's what exactly he said.

00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:39.660
 - He said, I think you've traced around your own penis.

00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:40.500
 - Really?

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:42.300
 - 'Cause otherwise you're an amazing artist.

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:45.340
 And then he said, what a pity, otherwise Goya,

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:47.180
 you're an amazing artist.

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:48.500
 (all laughing)

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:50.700
 - I'd love to come around and do a rubbing one.

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:53.280
 (all laughing)

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:56.580
 It's the other, this is Goya writing it.

00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:57.420
 - I'm Goya writing it.

00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:59.740
 - The artist, he's like, and then he said,

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:02.260
 and he starts referring to the penis picture as a man.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.700
 So he says, what a pity he cannot be exhibited

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:06.780
 to the public so that he could be tried out

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:09.900
 and the lady he fits best can get to keep him.

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:10.740
 And--

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:11.940
 - This is locker room chat, isn't it?

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:14.140
 - Yeah, this is, oh, sorry, Trump.

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:15.580
 (all laughing)

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:17.300
 - It's lads banter, isn't it?

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:20.380
 Although, to be fair, to be fair to the boys, boys, boys,

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:23.820
 they also exchange drawings of female genitalia as well.

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:25.340
 Equal rights for all genitals.

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:26.980
 - How do you trace around that?

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:29.740
 (all laughing)

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:31.060
 - I'll show you how she was jimmed.

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:32.460
 (all laughing)

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:34.460
 - It's more of a potato print, I think.

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:37.040
 (all laughing)

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:46.500
 - What did it do to the industry

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:49.140
 once people were no longer selling their piss?

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:50.380
 - Bad news for the piss industry.

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:51.700
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:54.620
 - Pissful, pissful, exactly.

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:55.780
 - Do you know that in France,

00:09:55.780 --> 00:10:00.780
 they call Pisoise sometimes Vespasians

00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:03.660
 because Vespasian, the Roman emperor,

00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:06.540
 taxed urine because they could use it

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:07.900
 in the tanning industry and various other things.

00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:08.740
 - They use it in everything,

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:09.580
 they're obsessed with it.

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:10.400
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:15.300
 And because he became synonymous with taxing urine,

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:17.700
 people called the urinals Vespasians,

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:18.660
 and it's still in France,

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:19.940
 they're called that sometimes today.

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:20.780
 - That's quite cool.

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:22.180
 - That's like, like, Boris Bikes, is like--

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:23.020
 - Bit like that, yeah.

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:24.220
 - He's gonna seem to have the name Boris attached.

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:26.740
 - If that still is the name in 2,000 years, yeah.

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:28.380
 Do you think separate of Vespasian,

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:29.580
 is separate of Vespasian happy

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:32.900
 that that's his legacy 2,000 years into the future?

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:35.460
 - It's quite grumpy anyway, Vespasian, I think.

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:36.540
 - It's not gonna cheer him up, is it?

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:38.220
 Well, do you know, your name has remained

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:39.780
 in the urinals of Paris.

00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:40.620
 - Didn't he?

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:41.460
 Was he the one who built the Colosseum?

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:42.300
 - It's kind of annoying.

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:43.300
 - He was the one who started

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:44.940
 the building of the Colosseum, yeah.

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:45.780
 - That is frustrating,

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:46.820
 'cause I think that's a real move

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:47.820
 towards your legacy there,

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:50.020
 to be like, "Ah, this is what we were running for."

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:50.860
 And then there's like--

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:52.740
 - Everyone's calling toilets after me.

00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:54.580
 I'm gonna build this massive Colosseum.

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:55.420
 This will do it.

00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:57.300
 - We'll be in the shape of a massive toilet, then.

00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:59.940
 (laughing)

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:00.780
 - That's cool.

00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:01.620
 - Yeah, pretty sweet.

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:04.460
 - And then there's huge efforts in America

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:08.700
 for cyberattacking happens so much more than I realized.

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:10.260
 And so say like banks.

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.140
 Banks have whole, basically, war rooms

00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:14.060
 in bunkers that are dedicated

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:15.380
 in order to stop cyberattacks.

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:16.980
 - I mean, like closely under attack as well.

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:19.500
 - So per day, this is from a few years ago,

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:23.060
 per day they would get 267,000 attacks.

00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:24.700
 So it's an attack every three seconds

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:26.220
 where someone's trying to steal money.

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:28.260
 Billions of dollars successfully

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:29.580
 would get stolen in the past.

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:32.660
 And so this was set up to stop that.

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:33.740
 In America, at one point,

00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:36.140
 they hired up to 2,000 new personnel

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:38.180
 to deal with cyberattacks within the government.

00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:40.380
 And this was under FBI director James Comey

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:42.020
 when he was in charge there.

00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:43.660
 And the biggest problem that he faces

00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:45.740
 is that the people who were best suited

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:48.100
 for fixing cybercrime and monitoring it

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:49.660
 were all weed smokers.

00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:52.700
 And so you can't hire someone into the FBI

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:53.860
 if they smoke weed.

00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:55.700
 It's part of the screening process

00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:56.980
 to not allow them to do it.

00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:59.180
 There's a rumor that there's a lot of agencies

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:02.020
 that hire a lot of Mormons at a sort of,

00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:04.180
 they say because they're so easy to screen.

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:05.700
 I think that's just a rumor that one.

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:06.660
 But this was a real thing.

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:08.260
 And so Comey had to say,

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.140
 we've got to let the weed smokers in

00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:12.420
 because we need them, they're the best in the world.

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:13.980
 So they, yeah, relax the law.

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:15.660
 So do apply if you smoke weed.

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:16.500
 - Really?

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:17.900
 - You will get past the first screening.

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:19.780
 We might not make it through in the end, you know.

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:20.620
 - So now if you want--

00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:21.460
 - 'Cause you can't remember anything.

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:23.700
 (laughing)

00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:28.540
 - Steal, just very quickly on sort of steal generally.

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:30.300
 I didn't appreciate

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:33.260
 what an extraordinary recyclable object it is

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.660
 and how much we do recycle it around the world.

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:37.140
 And that's really impressive.

00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:38.780
 - Like in buildings and stuff, right?

00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:40.260
 - In buildings, yeah, exactly.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.620
 Particularly buildings that mostly recyclable.

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:44.900
 If you take down a building, the metal can be reused.

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:47.900
 And in fact, one of the things of, you know,

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:49.620
 the Twin Towers when it went down,

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:51.420
 a lot of that metal was reused.

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:54.100
 In various, yeah, if you go to places like,

00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:55.100
 I don't know, if you go to India,

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:57.580
 you're gonna find a college that has been built

00:12:57.580 --> 00:12:59.740
 using the steel, yeah, you'll find--

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:01.020
 - Did they also make a ship?

00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:02.060
 - The USS New York?

00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:03.940
 - The USS New York, it's so interesting.

00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:05.260
 There is this ship out there

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:08.100
 where they have in the ship itself,

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:10.220
 there's a steel plate which is on display

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:11.660
 above the most used passageway

00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:13.300
 and they have a firefighters helmet there.

00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:16.300
 So all the sailors are reminded of the first responders.

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:18.220
 Every day the chaplain on that ship

00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:21.020
 will pick a name of someone who died in the terrorist attack

00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:22.660
 and they will read them as part of their prayers

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:24.020
 so that everyone remembers.

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:25.660
 But the bow of the ship itself

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:28.180
 is using the steel from the building as well.

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:31.340
 So it's a real remembrance ship.

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:33.340
 - And it's like the big sort of wires

00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:35.460
 that you get in reinforced concrete, isn't it?

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:36.460
 The steel, I think.

00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:37.500
 - Right. - Is that right?

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:38.340
 I'm pretty sure.

00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:39.700
 - I think the, I don't know if it is interesting,

00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:41.860
 but the key reason why concrete,

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:44.180
 like steel reinforced concrete works as a thing

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:46.580
 is because the heat coefficient of steel and concrete

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:48.980
 is the same so that when concrete expands in heat,

00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:51.060
 concrete and steel expands by the same amount

00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:52.180
 because they're kind of infused together

00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:54.220
 so they need to grow and shrink at the same rate.

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:55.540
 That is the most interesting

00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:57.260
 and at the same time, the most dull thing.

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:58.500
 - It's the most interesting boring thing

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:00.020
 I've ever thought about, yeah.

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:01.220
 - I think you've got to be careful

00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:02.980
 tossing the word "coefficient" into it.

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:06.540
 It's so interesting, it's so nice of you, it's brilliant.

00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:08.180
 - This is suddenly the first stamp

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:10.540
 where there's a naked woman on a stamp

00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:13.180
 and in American, this is 1959, they banned it.

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:15.580
 A Time Magazine wrote, "An indecent picture is bad enough,

00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:18.460
 but a postage stamp whose backside must be licked,

00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:21.940
 millions of innocent children collect stamps."

00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:24.100
 And so, yeah, and there were certain places

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:25.660
 that kind of allowed it in America

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:26.980
 'cause obviously so many different states,

00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:28.700
 it's not one all-consuming thing,

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:30.020
 but eventually they did ban it entirely.

00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:31.380
 - But it didn't have a picture of her bum

00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:32.780
 on the back that you could lick, did it?

00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:33.620
 - No.

00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:34.460
 - It's just a normal stamp.

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:36.500
 - It would be so good if stamps had the back

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:38.340
 of the person's head on the other side.

00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:39.180
 - Yeah.

00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:40.020
 - Why don't they do that?

00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:42.580
 - And if like Prince, King Prince Charles,

00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:44.940
 when they do his stamps, if they haven't already,

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:48.620
 then he has a sort of haptic device on the back of his head

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:51.220
 that whenever anyone licks a stamp, he feels the lick.

00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:53.620
 (all laughing)

00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:54.780
 - Very nice, wouldn't it?

00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:56.060
 - For whom?

00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:58.700
 - Nice is not, like, it's many things, it's not nice.

00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:00.780
 (all laughing)

00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:02.380
 - Can I give you some metallurgy words

00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:03.820
 and see if you can guess what they are?

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:05.300
 - Yes.

00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:06.460
 - Bottom running.

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:07.300
 - Bottom running.

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:09.900
 - That was when people tried to poo on steel to turn in.

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:11.620
 (all laughing)

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:12.940
 - You've got to try these things.

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:15.700
 - Is that wire that gets fed through the oceans

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:18.020
 to connect up internet in terms of the bottom?

00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:19.380
 - No, 'cause they don't run them

00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:21.260
 through the ground bottom, they drop them,

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:24.620
 they lay them, they lay them, that's always laying.

00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:25.460
 - So what is it?

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:26.740
 - Oh, sorry.

00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:28.900
 All the answers are gonna be really boring.

00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:31.020
 It's filling a mould cavity from the bottom

00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:32.860
 by means of gates from another channel

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:34.860
 through which molten metal is passed

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:36.300
 from one receptacle to another.

00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:37.420
 - I did know that, actually.

00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:40.460
 - Does anyone know what the MF temperature is?

00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:42.100
 - MF temperature. - Oh, come on.

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:44.060
 - The motherfucking temperature!

00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:46.580
 (all laughing)

00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:47.940
 - It is the temperature at which

00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:50.860
 martinsite formation finishes, of course.

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:52.580
 Martinsite being a very hard form

00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:54.980
 of steel crystalline structure.

00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:55.900
 - I hate this show.

00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:57.460
 (all laughing)

00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:59.180
 - Do you know what a slag trap is?

00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:01.620
 (all laughing)

00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:02.700
 - You're looking at him!

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:04.340
 (all laughing)

00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:05.180
 - Sorry.

00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:06.500
 (all laughing)

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:07.340
 - It's so horrible.

00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:10.620
 (all laughing)

00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:13.060
 - It's an extrusion in the gating or runner system

00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:14.860
 in a mould for the purpose of preventing

00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:17.940
 molten slag particles from entering the mould cavity.

00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:20.060
 I got a lot more of these, but let's move on.

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:20.900
 - Are you sure?

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:22.460
 - Yeah, 'cause the joke answers are fun,

00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:23.620
 but then you actually have to keep

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:25.900
 in the responses. - Yeah, absolutely.

00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:28.540
 I found an interesting thing that a loose bit of wire

00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:29.900
 is responsible for.

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:32.380
 Great innovation in the world.

00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:36.380
 This is 1962, the year after the Goya is stolen

00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:40.420
 from the museum, and basically there was a factory

00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:42.820
 that, it used to be that if you put people on hold

00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:45.380
 on a phone call, it would just be absolute silence, right?

00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:48.540
 And so this guy had it as factory.

00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:50.660
 There happened to be when he put it on hold,

00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:52.100
 there was just a random loose wire

00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:53.380
 that was touching a steel girder

00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:55.060
 that turned it into a transmitter.

00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:58.700
 And basically it was tuning in a local radio station.

00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:00.820
 And so anytime someone went on hold,

00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:02.540
 they found themselves listening to music

00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:03.780
 from this radio station.

00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:05.480
 And he thought this was gonna be incredibly annoying,

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:08.500
 but every time the people who were left waiting for ages

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:10.020
 would come back on, they'd say,

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:10.860
 "Oh, that was really nice.

00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:11.700
 "No, it was pleasant.

00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:13.700
 "I didn't actually notice time passing by."

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:15.260
 So this guy, Albert Levy,

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:17.300
 who should never have invented this technology,

00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:21.220
 patented basically hold music as a signal.

00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:22.980
 - Just because Andy's not here,

00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:25.220
 and we all know what he would say at this point.

00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:26.980
 Oh, all these things that claim

00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:30.100
 to be accidentally invented, definitely one,

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:31.380
 it's just made up on this.

00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:33.060
 - I'm sorry, miss, through some steel

00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:35.900
 in the pilot invented wire.

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:38.860
 - Also, can Andy smoking 80 cigarettes a day now?

00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:40.700
 - Just wanna compliment the impression there.

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:41.540
 - I think he's spot on.

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:42.780
 - I've been really honing it.

00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:44.380
 Yeah, that's actually, for the listeners,

00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:46.500
 that's what he talks like when he's not on the podcast.

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:49.020
 (all laughing)

00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:51.340
 - I read about Benjamin Franklin's 40 essay.

00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:52.420
 - Oh yeah.

00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:54.220
 - So it was in 1781, he wrote an essay,

00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:55.860
 which is either known as

00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:57.420
 to the Royal Academy of Farting,

00:17:57.420 --> 00:17:59.940
 or Fart Proudly, as it's snappier title.

00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:02.820
 And it was a submission to the Royal Academy of Brussels,

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:03.860
 but he never actually sent it,

00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:06.340
 but it was kind of like his sort of slamming back

00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:10.140
 at the sort of, he saw it as like sort of impractical questions

00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:11.100
 that scientists were looking at.

00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:12.340
 And he's like, well, he might as well look into

00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:14.620
 how we stop our fart smelling.

00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:16.220
 But I was reading what he was saying.

00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:18.460
 And if I as part of this, he,

00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:20.700
 so he didn't send in, he just gave it to his friends.

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:22.460
 But as part of it, he talks about

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:24.220
 how you can change the smell if you're a wee.

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:26.100
 So if we've done on QI,

00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:28.540
 the asparagus makes your wee smell kind of weird.

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:30.940
 And Franklin says, if you use turpentine,

00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:32.460
 it makes your wee smell good.

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:34.100
 - What, if you drink turpentine?

00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:35.700
 - Yes, there are problems with this plan.

00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:36.540
 (all laughing)

00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:38.060
 - I don't think you're gonna be around to smell it.

00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:38.980
 - Well, you're not supposed to,

00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:40.260
 but apparently it does work.

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:42.540
 Don't try this at home, and ever.

00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:44.500
 But it makes it smell with violets.

00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:45.340
 Apparently it does.

00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:46.180
 - Does it?

00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:48.900
 - Well, does turpentine mean what I think they mean?

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:50.340
 So I looked up turpentine to check.

00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:52.660
 And turpentine, Britannica says,

00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:56.180
 clear a clear oily liquid that's more flammable

00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:58.020
 and more toxic than white spirits.

00:18:58.020 --> 00:18:59.700
 - Yeah, that's what I thought.

00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:02.380
 - But I think they did use to use it medicinally.

00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:03.980
 'Cause Britannica also says it has a hot,

00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:05.180
 disagreeable taste,

00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:06.740
 which just people have been trying.

00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:08.860
 - I think they did use it medicinally,

00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:10.060
 but absolutely don't do that.

00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:11.420
 - No, and I think I much rather have wee

00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:13.180
 that smells normal than drink turpentine.

00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:15.220
 - Yeah, just buy some violets.

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:16.820
 Put them in the loo every time you go.

00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:18.060
 - Get air freshener, you're right.

00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:19.380
 And much less hazardous.

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:20.820
 - That's funny, 'cause I was reading about Franklin

00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:22.420
 for the last fact on clubs,

00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:26.100
 'cause he founded an intellectual literary society

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:27.460
 which sounded brilliant.

00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:28.820
 And they met every week.

00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:30.860
 And the idea was about exploring

00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:34.060
 moral philosophical questions of natural philosophy,

00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:36.700
 changing policy, improving the world.

00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:38.340
 And I wonder if this whole,

00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:40.540
 that it was a bit of an off day at the reading group,

00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:41.740
 where they came up with the whole,

00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:44.540
 should we write to someone about fart-stopping farts?

00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:46.260
 (laughing)

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:47.580
 - Say Shonagun.

00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:50.260
 - She writes a lot about her affairs in the book.

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:51.820
 There were a lot of men in her life.

00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:53.500
 And I was reading this great article

00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:54.580
 by a guy called David Greer,

00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:56.220
 who was saying a lot of people then go to it

00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:58.140
 thinking the pillow book affairs.

00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:00.780
 This is gonna be like old school erotica.

00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:01.620
 And you get to it.

00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:04.660
 And there's really nothing in there that's erotic in any way.

00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:07.540
 There's very, very subtle lines.

00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:09.980
 But the men who she has the affairs with

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:10.860
 do appear in the book,

00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:12.420
 but they largely appear in a list

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:14.300
 called things that irritate me.

00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:16.020
 And it's just knocking them about.

00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:18.820
 They're snoring, they're stumbling around.

00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:20.460
 You know, like they're just being idiots generally.

00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:22.380
 - They're leaving in a rush in the morning.

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:24.420
 Take note, modern day men.

00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:26.300
 She's like a man who leaps out of bed

00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:27.340
 after you've shagged him,

00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:28.860
 puts on his clothes and runs out the door.

00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:30.580
 Not cool guys.

00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:32.540
 - They get turned into a sex manual.

00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:33.380
 - Did it?

00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:34.220
 - Yeah.

00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:37.660
 And picture books and letter writing manuals,

00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:38.860
 textbooks, stuff like that.

00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:40.340
 - At the same time or different months.

00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:42.620
 (laughing)

00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:45.420
 - Yeah, so this was basically in the thousand years

00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:47.820
 subsequently because it was such a famous book.

00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:51.100
 They would kind of adapt it into various different things.

00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:52.420
 - Like fan fiction kind of thing.

00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:54.820
 - Kind of, if you need to write a sex manual

00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:57.500
 and you're like, okay, well, how am I gonna start?

00:20:57.500 --> 00:20:59.660
 They're like, well, let's start with this really famous thing

00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:01.540
 and then take bits of that

00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:03.700
 and then tell people how to have sex.

00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:05.660
 - I definitely read something which I wouldn't say

00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:07.020
 if it had been written in the modern day

00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:09.660
 'cause it's so gross, but it was written in 1714.

00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:11.100
 So it feels less gross,

00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:13.700
 but which takes Seanagan, the character of Seanagan

00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:16.380
 and is like a fan fiction and puts her in a story

00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:19.660
 where she's being had sex with from behind

00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:21.780
 while her brother looks on masturbating.

00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:22.820
 - Oh, okay.

00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:23.660
 - Yeah, that's fine.

00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:25.700
 - It's quite Game of Thrones-y, isn't it?

00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:27.620
 - Yeah, maybe that's what Game of Thrones is based on.

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:29.220
 Does that happen in Game of Thrones?

00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:31.660
 - There's incest and there's shagging and all that stuff.

00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:32.500
 - Lots of sex, yeah.

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:33.900
 - Is there incest in Game of Thrones?

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:35.660
 - Yeah, I think that's one of the main bits.

00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:38.060
 (laughing)

00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:39.660
 - I gotta watch it one of these days.

00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:41.300
 - Yeah, it's kind of episode one, series one,

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:42.140
 I think, all those.

00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:43.580
 (laughing)

00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:44.420
 - Free titles.

00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:46.460
 (laughing)

00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:48.380
 - Just very quickly on the fact

00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:49.980
 that the book loops in on itself.

00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:53.100
 I just went down a bit of a loop on that,

00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:54.380
 just finding other versions of it.

00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:57.100
 And so one famous version of it

00:21:57.100 --> 00:21:59.440
 is the Pink Floyd album, The Wall,

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:02.620
 which ends on the same wording that the album begins on.

00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:05.940
 So in theory, you can just play it in one continuous loop.

00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:07.820
 But the one that seems most exciting to me,

00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:10.180
 which hasn't happened, but Al Jean,

00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:13.540
 who is an executive producer and writer for The Simpsons,

00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:15.620
 he has said that if he has it his way,

00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:17.500
 that's how The Simpsons will end.

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:19.340
 The final scene will loop back

00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:21.820
 into the very opening scene of The Simpsons

00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:23.860
 to show that no time has passed.

00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:25.740
 - That's very cool, but they looked very different

00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:26.580
 in the first series.

00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:28.140
 - Exactly, and the voices were very different and so on.

00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:31.660
 - They go through like a magic mirror and then be like.

00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:33.900
 - I think there'll be a Doctor Who regeneration episode

00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:36.140
 weren't there, where it's a really painful

00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:38.300
 agonizing process and they just turn into these slightly

00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:40.740
 tweaks, weird versions of themselves.

00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:42.900
 - I suppose like the first episode will have begun

00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:44.860
 with him jumping out of the school,

00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:46.620
 like every episode begins, would it?

00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:48.100
 Or do you reckon they'll go back to that?

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:49.300
 Or do you think they'll go back to?

00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:51.260
 - Oh, there's a pre-title incest scene.

00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:52.100
 That is...

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:54.340
 (laughing)

00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:57.900
 - Do you think we should do the final episode of Fish

00:22:57.900 --> 00:22:59.940
 should be President Garfield's anus or whatever?

00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:01.860
 No, it was the sun, the get.

00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:05.540
 - I actually think it should end with you saying to me,

00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:07.020
 you know there's no such thing as a fish,

00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:08.340
 what do you mean there's no such thing as a fish?

00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:09.180
 - Oh, that's a good idea.

00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:10.820
 - Yeah, that's the loop, 'cause that's the initial.

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:13.660
 - Although we could do that, 'cause our first fact was

00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:16.020
 that someone dropped a baguette in CERN.

00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:17.580
 And CERN obviously there was a theory

00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:19.700
 that time travelers would come there.

00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:21.380
 So we could finish with me saying,

00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:24.700
 "Oh, Dan, I'm just going off to visit CERN.

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:26.220
 "Just bought a nice baguette."

00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:27.700
 (laughing)

00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:28.540
 - That's great, what did I do?

00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:29.380
 - I don't know, guys.

00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:30.820
 President Garfield ate stuff through his arse.

00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:32.380
 I think we're disappearing up our own arse.

00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:33.780
 (laughing)

00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:34.620
 Let's get out.

00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:36.740
 - Here's someone who died.

00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:38.460
 Justin Schmidt.

00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:39.300
 - Who's that?

00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:40.140
 - No.

00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:41.340
 - You might know him by his nickname.

00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:42.940
 The King of Sting.

00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:43.780
 - No.

00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:44.620
 - Okay.

00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:46.260
 (laughing)

00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:47.980
 - Is he from the Schmidt Pain Index?

00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:49.220
 - Yes. - No.

00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:50.700
 - He's the guy he came up with.

00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:51.540
 - The bees.

00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:52.380
 - A thing we spoke about.

00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:54.140
 I think in the first few episodes of this podcast,

00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:55.420
 he's an amazing guy.

00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:59.620
 He was stung over his life by 150 different insects.

00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:00.940
 He filled his home with them

00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:03.300
 so that he could feel what it was like

00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:04.140
 to be stung by each of them.

00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:06.940
 And then he wrote down how painful it was.

00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:07.780
 - Yeah.

00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:09.940
 - And he came up with this incredible,

00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:11.660
 these beautiful writings.

00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:13.740
 So a bee, a normal bee is two.

00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:14.580
 It's called two.

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:16.020
 I think it goes up to four.

00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:16.980
 A bee, quite boring.

00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:18.900
 A burning match head lands on your skin.

00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:19.740
 Yeah.

00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:21.060
 (laughing)

00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:21.900
 Who cares?

00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:23.980
 A club-horned wasp, 0.5.

00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:25.260
 Rather disappointing.

00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:26.900
 (laughing)

00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:29.980
 But he collected a lot of quite exotic

00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:31.740
 and really dangerous insects.

00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:33.460
 And it's like, okay, here's one.

00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:34.700
 The warrior wasp.

00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:36.260
 This scores four.

00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:37.100
 Torture.

00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:40.180
 You are chained in the flow of an active volcano.

00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:41.900
 Why did I start this list?

00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:44.140
 (laughing)

00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:50.300
 - And that was four on the pain index?

00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:52.060
 - No, I think four is the maximum.

00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:53.820
 I'm not sure why, but like that was really high.

00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:54.660
 - Yeah, okay, right.

00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:55.900
 - And he died this year.

00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:56.740
 - He died this year.

00:24:56.740 --> 00:24:57.580
 - Such a shame.

00:24:57.580 --> 00:24:58.420
 - Yeah.

00:24:58.420 --> 00:24:59.260
 (laughing)

00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:01.300
 - I believe he swallowed a fly, didn't he?

00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:04.540
 (laughing)

00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:05.380
 - I've actually just realized,

00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:06.980
 I thought I'd written down a fact about Berlusconi,

00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:08.620
 but it was just that he was five foot five,

00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:10.380
 and it was my way of segwaying into a fact

00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:13.500
 I thought was very interesting and tangentially related,

00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:17.740
 which is that this year is the year that we, height-wise,

00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:21.820
 as humans, caught up with ourselves as hunter-gatherers.

00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:24.540
 So, the average height of humans

00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:27.700
 has been gradually going up for a couple of hundred years.

00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:32.420
 And it, this year, was clarified as five foot 10 for men.

00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:34.380
 - So, can I just say, after hunter-gatherers,

00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:36.300
 we shrunk and we're going back up again?

00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:37.140
 - Yes, indeed.

00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:39.140
 And we've just reached hunter-gatherer height again.

00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:40.980
 'Cause what hunter-gatherers, very tall, very healthy,

00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:43.220
 ate a nice range of berries and bears or whatever.

00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:46.940
 And then, we (laughing)

00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:49.260
 started to know, depending where you lived.

00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:51.820
 And then, we started farming,

00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:53.460
 and our diets got quite a lot worse,

00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:54.780
 'cause it was like all monocultures.

00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:55.620
 - Just eating grain.

00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:56.460
 - And just eating grain,

00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:58.780
 exactly, and all hunched over with the labour.

00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:00.500
 And we started working much harder.

00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:01.820
 And so, we shrunk.

00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:03.700
 And I think 4,000 years ago,

00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:05.340
 the average height was five foot four.

00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:07.500
 So, Berlusconi, five foot five.

00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:08.540
 He would have fitted right here.

00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:10.580
 He would have been tall 4,000 years ago.

00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:11.820
 But he wasn't today.

00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:14.460
 And anyway, now we've made it up back to hunter-gatherer height.

00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:15.300
 - That's nice.

00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:16.140
 - Isn't it?

00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:16.980
 - Yeah.

00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:18.380
 - Can finally reach those high berries.

00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:20.300
 (laughing)

00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:23.340
 - Can I just, my favorite promotional story,

00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:26.500
 Christmas-based, a very specific category,

00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:29.380
 is, you know, the American dino chain Denny's,

00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:32.820
 which advertises as always open in America.

00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:34.700
 So, it's been going around since the 1950s.

00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:38.180
 So, and it is open 24/7, 365 days a year,

00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:40.780
 366 in a leap year, always open.

00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:42.260
 And then, in 1988,

00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:45.380
 Denny's decided to give its staff Christmas Day off.

00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:48.780
 And so, they were gonna close for Christmas Day.

00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:51.940
 The problem with this was that they had never closed before.

00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:53.380
 So, none of the doors shut.

00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:55.780
 (laughing)

00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:57.740
 They suddenly found themselves calling locksmiths.

00:26:57.740 --> 00:27:00.660
 They had to have 700 Denny's chains,

00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:03.300
 have locksmiths visit to replace the doors and the locks.

00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:04.620
 - Whoa, whoa.

00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:07.200
 (upbeat music)

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:09.780
 (upbeat music)

00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:13.200
 (upbeat music)

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:16.560
