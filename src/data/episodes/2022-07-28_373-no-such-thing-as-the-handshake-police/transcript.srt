00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,200
 Hey, everyone, welcome to this week's episode of Fish.

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:05,760
 Before we begin, just to let you know that we have a special guest on this week.

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:09,720
 Andy is away looking at thatched roofs around the UK.

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:13,720
 And so in his place, we have got the brilliant Ella Al-Shemahi.

5
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,000
 Ella is a National Geographic explorer.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,200
 She's a paleoanthropologist, an evolutionary biologist, a standup comedian.

7
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,160
 She's extraordinary.

8
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,880
 And she's written this new book, which is called The Handshake, A Gripping History.

9
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,840
 It's all about, as it says on the tin, the handshake.

10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,200
 You know, where did it come from?

11
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,240
 How long have we had it?

12
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,480
 Is it dead after this pandemic?

13
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,840
 It really is an awesome book.

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,040
 It's got amazing chapters.

15
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,720
 I mean, take this as a chapter headline, chapter number three,

16
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,680
 finger snaps and penis shakes.

17
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,880
 Who doesn't want this book?

18
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,240
 So do go out and get it.

19
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,440
 It's available online.

20
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,240
 You can go back into physical bookshops as well to pick one up

21
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,520
 and do follow her adventures online as well.

22
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:51,880
 She can be found on Twitter on @ella_alshamahi.

23
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,880
 Do that because she is packed with facts.

24
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,360
 That's right.

25
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,360
 And you'll be getting a bit of a taster of those in the upcoming episode.

26
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,120
 But sadly, of course, Andy is going to be back next week,

27
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,920
 and he's also going to be joining us for our upcoming tour.

28
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,000
 We couldn't convince Ella to come on that instead.

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,760
 But yeah, we've got a tour coming up.

30
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,960
 Please join us.

31
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,480
 We are going to lots of fun places, Belfast, Birmingham, Nottingham,

32
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:16,480
 Peterborough, Richmond, Dublin, and then loads more.

33
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,640
 Go to knowsuchthingasafish.com to get tickets right now.

34
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,280
 OK, on with the show.

35
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,080
 You can have a bath on your own.

36
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,840
 You can have a bath on your own.

37
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,240
 You can have a bath on your own.

38
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:39,840
 Hello and welcome to another episode of Know Such Thing as a Fish,

39
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,920
 a weekly podcast coming to you from four undisclosed locations in the UK.

40
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,560
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

41
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,000
 I am sitting here with James Harkin, Anna Tyshinski

42
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:54,640
 and our special guest, it is paleo anthropologist Ella Al-Shamahi.

43
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,760
 And once again, we have gathered round our microphones

44
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,040
 with our four favourite facts from the last seven days.

45
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,720
 And in no particular order, here we go.

46
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:06,120
 Starting with fact number one, that is Ella.

47
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:10,880
 My fact is that an anti-handshake society was formed in Baku, Azerbaijan

48
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,640
 in 1894 because of a cholera outbreak.

49
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,360
 You paid six rubles as membership.

50
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,800
 You wore a pin to identify yourself.

51
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,400
 And just in case you did slip up and shake hands,

52
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,520
 you had to pay three rubles as a fine.

53
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,960
 You're volunteering to be fined.

54
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,280
 If you didn't join the society, you didn't have to be fined.

55
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,160
 Yeah, I mean, there's a question about the money there, isn't it?

56
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,040
 Six as membership and then three every single time you shake hands.

57
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,120
 Yeah, but if you're signing up, you're fairly confident

58
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,200
 that you're not going to be doing the handshaking, right?

59
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,800
 Like, that's it's like instituting the swear box or something.

60
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,880
 But I love the pin that, you know, it's basically declaring

61
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,240
 that you're really not involved at all.

62
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,080
 You're not having any part of it.

63
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,000
 Do you think that pin is so that people can see you and think

64
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,440
 that guy is not to be handshuck?

65
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,520
 I think so. I think it's to identify yourself.

66
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,800
 But I do have questions about how many people were actually wearing these pins.

67
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,320
 You know, is it just you and Mike down the street?

68
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,440
 Or was it actually a lot of people wearing it?

69
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,880
 I don't. You're talking about it like it was a police badge.

70
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,560
 I don't think anyone was staring at the badge anyway.

71
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:17,400
 It was probably a badge that was like, I love Ninja Turtles that, you know,

72
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,000
 I would wear like, yeah, it's on me, but no one's no one's paying attention.

73
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,200
 Right. I mean, who knows?

74
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,480
 This is this is way back since over a hundred years ago.

75
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,840
 But the thing that I love about this bit is that the lancet of all things,

76
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,080
 which is obviously really respectable medical journal,

77
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,560
 absolutely blasted them for this and just blasted them for not refusing

78
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,360
 to shake hands during an epidemic, which is hilarious, obviously, today.

79
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,720
 And they're basically are these Russians.

80
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,640
 They've taken everything too seriously.

81
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,920
 They've completely lost it.

82
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,520
 Obviously, that has not aged well, has it?

83
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:50,560
 So they knew that shaking hands was going to be bad for the spread of cholera.

84
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,760
 This is why they did it.

85
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,000
 So, yes, this society knew it.

86
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,520
 Obviously, generally, the people in that area didn't.

87
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,920
 And more importantly, the whole of the Western medical establishment

88
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,080
 thought they were lunatics.

89
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,080
 So this is a story that just kept getting repeated everywhere,

90
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:06,120
 kind of in that that period, which is people going,

91
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,960
 what is going on with these Russians?

92
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:11,480
 I mean, that's about it, but at the time, it was, you know, they were clad as Russians.

93
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:16,240
 Yeah, that was a really bad cholera outbreak in Baku, started in 1892.

94
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:20,600
 And when it first got into the town, they didn't have a single microscope

95
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:26,480
 in the entire city and everyone realized that there was this problem with cholera

96
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:32,040
 and everyone just fled the city had 120,000 people at the start of June.

97
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,360
 And by the end of June, there were only 20,000 people left in Baku.

98
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,680
 And so basically, people had fled out of Baku, but it meant that they'd taken

99
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,800
 cholera with them on the trains and the boats to the whole rest of Russia.

100
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,560
 And then there was a cholera outbreak for two more years in the whole of Russia.

101
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:52,600
 And in Baku, they had four doctors who were in charge of all the different

102
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,520
 sanitary sections of the town.

103
00:04:54,520 --> 00:05:00,000
 And they were called Arkhangelsky, Akhundov, Lokheman and Dr. Corona.

104
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,920
 He believed that.

105
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,440
 It's Russian for crown, but he was called Dr. Corona.

106
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,400
 Yeah, that's amazing.

107
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,200
 How come they spread it because cholera is pretty hard to spread person to person?

108
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,800
 It's you've got to be drinking their poo.

109
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,120
 Well, it can be misconception, right?

110
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,080
 In the olden days and actually handshake, avoiding handshaking

111
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,560
 probably wasn't fully necessary unless someone had just wiped their bum.

112
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:26,200
 It can it can go on clothing and on bedding and stuff like that.

113
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,520
 So I think that was one one way it went.

114
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,800
 So I actually think that's why the lancet were having a go at them

115
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,400
 because the lancet rather racistly were like, oh, the Russians have terrible

116
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,280
 sanitation and their solution is just not to shake hands.

117
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,240
 They're being absolutely ludicrous as opposed to, you know, like.

118
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,280
 But it's it's an interesting one.

119
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,880
 Yeah, because because they do say that it's not really touch that gives you cholera,

120
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:51,160
 although actually refugee camps or workers, they are told not to shake hands

121
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,840
 and to have distance if there's a cholera outbreak.

122
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,240
 So presumably it's a little bit.

123
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,320
 Yeah, it's feces getting in your mouth.

124
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,200
 And if you have feces on your hands, then, you know, if you got two hands,

125
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,080
 you could have traces.

126
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,760
 I mean, it's easy to get traces, isn't it?

127
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:09,360
 Yeah, well, I think it's just it's only just the point that people often thought

128
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,640
 that it was really bad to be around people who had cholera in the olden days.

129
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,120
 And people would try and keep them in a different room.

130
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,600
 But actually, largely, it's just from drinking infected water.

131
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,880
 And it's so horrible when you read these tales of people being so terrified

132
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,760
 and fleeing, it's so easy to treat.

133
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,520
 It must be the easiest disease on earth to treat, right?

134
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,720
 You die of dehydration.

135
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,520
 You can die within two hours of getting it.

136
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,400
 But if you just drink and if you drink rehydration salts,

137
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:37,040
 if you're super dehydrated or if you just neck water constantly, you're basically fine.

138
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:41,480
 OK, so we're saying that it is water, but and there might be traces.

139
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,560
 But do you guys know that only 90 percent of people globally

140
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,960
 actually wash their hands after a number two?

141
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,520
 Do they? Only 19 percent.

142
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,400
 I suppose you can take out all the men.

143
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:56,240
 So it's, you know, 19 percent of the 50 percent of the women, you know,

144
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,240
 everyone knows that no men wash their hands after they go to the toilet.

145
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,960
 So what is that thing?

146
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,880
 Yeah, I heard that they actually did a study of what's it called?

147
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,640
 Thingy stations, service stations, the men's toilets.

148
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,640
 And it was not. It was not a good site.

149
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:15,400
 OK, well, that's that's a that's a whole different world,

150
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,000
 the men's toilets in a service.

151
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,200
 No, not in that way, Dan.

152
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,640
 I mean, just in terms of washing your hands afterwards.

153
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,440
 Well, no, you don't want to touch anything.

154
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:27,120
 Even the even the washing of the hands, you know, pressing the tap down.

155
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,360
 I feel like I'm going to get a disease in a place like that.

156
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,240
 So that's that's a place where you touch nothing, except yourself and then go out.

157
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,320
 I don't mean that.

158
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,760
 That is that does happen a lot for the stations.

159
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,760
 Yeah, that's right.

160
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,400
 But you do wash your hands, though, Dan, right?

161
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,280
 Not in service stations.

162
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,760
 I'll happily admit that I don't touch anything.

163
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,520
 I do think men's toilets are worse because they get cleaned less often.

164
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,600
 I think that's the thing. Or perhaps this is just a thing that.

165
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,960
 No, I think they're just not very clean.

166
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,360
 You are. You think they're just not clean.

167
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,160
 Like, do you think any woman would just admit to what Dan just admitted to?

168
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,880
 I think the problem is not admitting to it is really what we're saying here.

169
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,840
 We're just liars.

170
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,120
 Just on the handshakes, one more thing in in Russia.

171
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,680
 This carried on for a while.

172
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:13,360
 And in 1918 in St. Petersburg, there was a quite a common slogan

173
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,160
 called down with the handshake and you could again buy little badges

174
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:21,440
 which had down with the handshake on because people thought the handshaking was bad.

175
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,680
 And there was a union of simplifying greetings in the 1920s,

176
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,520
 which not only banned handshakes, it also banned hugs and kisses.

177
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,440
 And Bulgarkov writes about it in one of his early stories called Devildom.

178
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,600
 My problem with all of this is whenever we kind of talk about the handshake

179
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,880
 you know, just how gross it is, how many people weren't shaking hands, etc.

180
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,000
 etc. at various times, because of things.

181
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,040
 I always just think once upon a time on our planet, there were penis handshakes

182
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,440
 and we're mortified.

183
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,720
 Dan still does that in the welcome break every weekend.

184
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,960
 What is a penis handshake?

185
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:59,160
 Does that two penis is shaking or one out of the two penis are?

186
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,120
 No, it's one hand shakes the penis.

187
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,840
 And this was this was by one one tribe in Australia.

188
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:08,240
 And, you know, it's only recently extinct.

189
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,280
 I think it became extinct in the 1950s.

190
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:15,680
 So what it is is one village, one group of people from one village comes to another group.

191
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:20,800
 The visitors, they offer their their penises

192
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,040
 to the to the people who are home, you know, who are at home, basically.

193
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,200
 It's like bringing a bottle of wine to exactly.

194
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,160
 Exactly. If the men at home, if one of them refuses to to shake it,

195
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,320
 that's akin to a declaration of war.

196
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,800
 So then the panicked visitor offers it to all the other guys

197
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,360
 in the hopes that one of them shakes it.

198
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:41,440
 Because if one of them shakes it, it's basically we vouch for you, mate.

199
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,600
 He's probably all right. Fascinating.

200
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,080
 Absolutely amazing. God, how long did this last for?

201
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,880
 You said it ended in what, the 50s?

202
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:53,160
 Yeah. So the last reference, so the reference we have of it,

203
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:57,000
 kind of a really detailed anthropological study was in the 1950s.

204
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,760
 And then we don't really know anything after that.

205
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,880
 And it's just really hard to know what really went down, if that makes sense.

206
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,320
 But also because I've got to be honest, as an anthropologist,

207
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,640
 sometimes I feel like anthropologists turn up somewhere

208
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,840
 and tribes just do whatever they want.

209
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:14,200
 There's always a bit of me that's like.

210
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,960
 So you think this tribe is like, yeah, we do this every day, mate.

211
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:20,640
 Yeah, of course, behind the corner, they're just giggling to themselves,

212
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,360
 go ahead and swallow that, not literally swallow it.

213
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,000
 I found it really fascinating reading about handshakes,

214
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,320
 both historical and modern ones.

215
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,560
 And some of my favourite ones that I've discovered,

216
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:37,320
 probably my favourite, whenever Prince Charles used to participate

217
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,480
 in a tree planting ceremony, he'd always give one of the branches

218
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,760
 a handshake and wish it well before leaving.

219
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,960
 Wow.

220
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:49,040
 Was that the penis handshake or your standard just hand on twig, right?

221
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,040
 Just hand on twig.

222
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,160
 Oh, God, yeah.

223
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:57,200
 Charles mob out just waiting for the wind to brush a branch against it.

224
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:05,080
 If he doesn't accept, he goes to the other trees, please, one of you.

225
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:08,960
 What I found really interesting about this fact, what I liked about it,

226
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:12,480
 the initial fact is just the idea that we've been doing some of the same stuff

227
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,920
 for so long, you know, we say there's a disease spreading, don't handshake today.

228
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,120
 The same back then.

229
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,760
 And I hadn't quite realised how widespread that advice was around pandemic time.

230
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,600
 So there was like, it went out of fashion basically always

231
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,720
 when there was an illness around, didn't it, in the early 20th century.

232
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,080
 You're right, you keep seeing it time and time again.

233
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:34,080
 So Prescott, Arizona actually banned the handshake during the Spanish flu.

234
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,800
 They just made it illegal.

235
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,920
 And you do see stuff like that during different pandemics and epidemics.

236
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,640
 People either shun it or they actually completely ban it.

237
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,760
 So it's not the first time at all, you know.

238
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:49,280
 They had handshake police sort of going down the street, throwing people apart.

239
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,320
 I suppose they must have.

240
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,560
 I'd love to have that.

241
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,840
 Not really sure how they would have policed it.

242
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,920
 I guess it's like everything.

243
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,960
 How on earth do you police any of this stuff?

244
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:00,280
 I guess you would just grass on your neighbours doing the handshakes, wouldn't you?

245
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,720
 That's what usually happens.

246
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,200
 Yeah, it's probably like today, you can't police.

247
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,240
 And it's like diversion.

248
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:10,960
 But like I was, I was in like Yemeni is a very, very, I'm Yemeni originally.

249
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,240
 Yemeni is very famous for polygamy.

250
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:16,280
 Like it's a really big thing to men tend to have loads of wives.

251
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,160
 I was in a cab.

252
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:21,280
 There's a Yemeni taxi driver and I was like, how's your dad handling lockdown?

253
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,560
 He was like, oh, he's been a bit naughty.

254
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,320
 He went out and visited his second wife.

255
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:29,080
 I was like, first of all, that's so typically Yemeni.

256
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,440
 Secondly, how do you police that?

257
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,040
 Like I'm going to go see my second wife.

258
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,400
 But how are the police going to get involved with any of this stuff?

259
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,040
 Yeah, that's just an extended bubble, isn't it?

260
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,920
 Ella, there's a thing that you say in the book, which I found quite surprising.

261
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:50,480
 I think when you read facts about handshakes, a lot of a sort of very classic

262
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,640
 fact that's out there, which turns out to be wrong, is that the handshake was sort

263
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,720
 of that came about during medieval times to show you didn't have a weapon in your

264
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,200
 hand and that you were presenting an open palm to show you.

265
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,760
 But that turns out that's according to your book, completely wrong, right?

266
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,880
 Yes, yes, my research very much is against this.

267
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:11,120
 But I love that I've now become the authority on the handshake in this country.

268
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,000
 Like, I just don't know how this happened, but I'm completely loving it

269
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,800
 with all the random things.

270
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,160
 But yeah, I think the sport was open.

271
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,360
 There wasn't an established handshake authority.

272
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,720
 All right, all right, all right.

273
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:26,400
 No, but yeah, so I kind of looked into it and it just never made any sense.

274
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,280
 And my argument is that the handshake is biological.

275
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:33,200
 And I've got two arguments for this to support it rather.

276
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,800
 One is the chimps shake hands, so chimps and bonobos shake hands.

277
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:41,600
 Dr. Kat Hobaiter showed that the chip handshake actually has a very similar

278
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,000
 meaning to our own. So she's got, like, for example, videos of two chimps

279
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,760
 kind of really going at each other in a fight and then kind of sheepishly

280
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,320
 walking up to each other and shaking hands to make up, which is adorable.

281
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:55,320
 So if you think about it, our closest living relatives of the chimps and bonobos,

282
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,200
 it kind of makes sense that, you know, that's by descent.

283
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,520
 So I'm arguing that the handshake is seven million years old.

284
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:06,360
 But the coolest bit that kind of supports this is that we actually transfer

285
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,400
 chemo signals, chemical signals via handshakes.

286
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,880
 And there's data to show that we actually sniff our hands afterwards.

287
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:17,600
 And I know that sounds absolutely mad, but chemo signals are something

288
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,840
 a lot of us don't really realise are actually going on.

289
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:23,080
 So I think we accept that, you know, the animals in the animal kingdom

290
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,080
 communicate with each other chemically.

291
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,880
 But we like to think that our communications are via like sonnets

292
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,000
 and, you know, language and what have you.

293
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,880
 But it's it's absolutely bull because we do communicate with each other chemically.

294
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,440
 So they did these crazy experiments where they got gauze.

295
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,280
 They put it under people's armpits.

296
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,800
 They got them to watch, you know, stressful films or happy films.

297
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,920
 And then they took that gauze to a different group of participants

298
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:51,520
 and they go point to the bottle that has gauze in it that is like smells like happiness.

299
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:55,320
 And they were getting it right more than you'd expect by chance, which.

300
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,960
 So when we shake hands, you're saying, we're trying to tell someone I'm really happy

301
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:02,360
 or I'm freaking out and we're hoping that you smell your hands afterwards.

302
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,120
 And you go, oh, God, are you OK?

303
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,360
 Yeah, there's one institute, the Wiseman Institute,

304
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,360
 actually put hidden cameras on people and they showed that people were more

305
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:14,640
 likely to put their hand to their nose and take a sniff after they shake hands

306
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,560
 than if they agree in a different way.

307
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,120
 So it's it's we're just animals, basically.

308
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,560
 Whenever I close a Zoom call, I always sniff my computer afterwards.

309
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,800
 That's why I'm just in case I can gain some information.

310
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:32,520
 Anything is your computer sad?

311
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,960
 I've had color quite badly this whole time.

312
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:39,240
 Right. So we do know it's covered in your own faces.

313
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:43,760
 I think most people could have worked that out anyway.

314
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:52,720
 OK, it is time for fact number two.

315
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,280
 And that is my fact.

316
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:58,320
 My fact this week is the 2013 recipient of the Amelia Earhart

317
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:03,000
 pioneering achievement award, who later successfully completed Amelia Earhart's

318
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,240
 fatal circumnavigation of the world is called Amelia Earhart.

319
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:11,480
 What? Did she change her name for it?

320
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,400
 She did. She did not change her name.

321
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,720
 She was born Amelia Rose Earhart.

322
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:19,800
 She was named that by her parents because they wanted to inspire her by

323
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:24,400
 pairing her up as a namesake to one of the great aviators of all time.

324
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:29,480
 And I don't believe that there's any kind of aviation history in her family.

325
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:34,600
 She tried to find out if she was actually descended from Amelia Earhart

326
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:38,600
 in any way, if she was a relative, because they lived fairly close to each other.

327
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,400
 And it turns out there's nothing that connects them.

328
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,680
 She hired a genealogist who looked into it and said that she was connected

329
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,760
 as far back as the 1700s.

330
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:50,320
 And then she found a sort of second advanced team who said there's absolutely

331
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,040
 no traceable connection. So. So weird.

332
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:58,520
 Yeah, my brother is having a kids and we're like, names aren't important.

333
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:02,000
 And now I'm like, no, names are definitely, definitely important.

334
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,720
 Like, that is so random.

335
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:07,280
 I think if you want someone to win a prize and you actually give them

336
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,880
 the name of that prize, like if your brother decides to call his

337
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,880
 child the Nobel Prize for Chemistry or something, and he might have a chance.

338
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,960
 I mean, he won't have a chance in school.

339
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:25,280
 But, you know, having friends, it just detracts from all that time

340
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,400
 you could spend doing chemistry, doesn't it? That's the thing.

341
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,240
 Yeah.

342
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,080
 Hold on. So she was the first.

343
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,840
 She couldn't have been the first person to to then redo it.

344
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,280
 No, no, she wasn't the first person to redo it.

345
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:40,040
 She she's she's the second youngest ever to do it, though,

346
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,920
 which is a pretty amazing feat in itself.

347
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:47,200
 No, it was done solo by another person a few years beforehand.

348
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,280
 The media reported that she had done it because I think it felt like a better story.

349
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,400
 Yeah, yeah, I did it.

350
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,000
 And sorry, when you say because I couldn't help noticing that in your wording,

351
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,600
 you said she successfully completed Amelia Earhart's fatal circumnavigation.

352
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,400
 So she didn't complete the fatal bit, right?

353
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,040
 She decided to remain alive throughout.

354
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,160
 Is that correct? Yes.

355
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,520
 She's cool. It was it was a cheat.

356
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,920
 I'll be really sticking to the cause, wouldn't it?

357
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:18,240
 To think, well, I've really got to follow her into what states and disappear as well.

358
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,440
 Yeah, especially not knowing where she disappeared.

359
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,160
 Like, that's quite quite a feat.

360
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,240
 Well, the thing is, though, we so we don't know the exact spot

361
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,120
 where Amelia Earhart disappeared, but we know roughly the area.

362
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,200
 It's Howland Island is the general area.

363
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,640
 This is a place that is in the Pacific Ocean.

364
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,760
 It's halfway between Hawaii and Australia.

365
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:41,360
 There were ships in the immediate area that were on radio contact with Amelia Earhart

366
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,320
 trying to help guide her there.

367
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,600
 So it was her. It was her co-pilot.

368
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,160
 It really doesn't feature much in this story.

369
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,320
 You know, I know, right?

370
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,280
 Don't don't die next to someone famous.

371
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,760
 You know, don't blame yourself.

372
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,480
 Famous. This really is the great example of that.

373
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,240
 Because most people didn't even know there was another dude there.

374
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,800
 I don't think it was her.

375
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,320
 I always thought she tried it alone.

376
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:06,640
 And I I couldn't believe I found myself researching this and thinking,

377
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,320
 we've really got to rejuvenate the reputation of the man in this story.

378
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,600
 Way too much cuteness for it.

379
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,880
 Fred Noonan. And he was a navigator.

380
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:19,560
 He was brought on to be able to navigate using the stars and help them find

381
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,200
 where she was going. She was going to do a lot of it solo.

382
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,720
 But I think he was so good at what he did that he sort of hitched the ride

383
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,040
 for much more of it than he was meant to.

384
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,520
 And he's a guy who was known for surviving stuff.

385
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:34,440
 He used to be a he used to work on ammunition ships during wars.

386
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:38,440
 And his he was on three separate vessels that were all sunk by U-boats.

387
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,640
 And he survived.

388
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:42,200
 So, you know, this is a guy with a good survival rate.

389
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,880
 I would think of that as a bad omen, because that certainly implies that my

390
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,280
 plane is going to go down and crash and I'm going to die.

391
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,160
 But he'll walk away.

392
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:53,880
 He's got this is like I went through a five year period.

393
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:57,280
 Every time I turn up on an expedition somewhere that was coming out of war,

394
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,840
 suddenly would go straight back into war.

395
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:02,080
 The minute I would turn up and it was like my brother was like,

396
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,160
 do you think you're cursed?

397
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,280
 I was like, maybe.

398
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,880
 Is it true that Amelia Earhart got ripped apart by crabs?

399
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,760
 That's why I always read at the end.

400
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,760
 Well, this is one of the latest theories.

401
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:17,360
 So, so Howland Island is the island that she was meant to be landing on.

402
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,960
 There's another island next to it, which is Gardner Island.

403
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:25,320
 And it's thought that that is where she turned and landed on a reef, survived.

404
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:30,720
 And then was eventually killed by giant crabs, which ate her, carried her

405
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:35,000
 bones to the the holes that they dig and left her down there.

406
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,040
 So that is a theory.

407
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:40,080
 And one of the last expeditions, which I believe happened in about

408
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:46,280
 2017, 2018, they had bone sniffing dogs to try and find her.

409
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:49,280
 And bone sniffing dogs can smell quite far down.

410
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,400
 And so the hope was is that they were going to find her.

411
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,680
 And I think they found some bones, but I don't don't think it was hers.

412
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,120
 That is a dog's dream job, isn't it?

413
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,680
 I'm going to I'm going to literally employ you to find bones.

414
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,400
 Yeah, that is amazing.

415
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,360
 The only better job is chasing post-med, isn't it?

416
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,960
 Yeah.

417
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,840
 Yeah, I think they did an experiment where they tested

418
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,160
 how well she could have been consumed by these crabs.

419
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:17,120
 And it was coconut hermit crabs, which we must have mentioned before.

420
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,680
 And they are giant crabs in the largest land crab.

421
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,040
 They're like three feet wide.

422
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,200
 They can kill birds and climb trees and stuff.

423
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,200
 And their claws produce double the force of a tiger's bite

424
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,360
 so they can just crunch through bones.

425
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,920
 And I think the scientists took a pig carcass to the beach

426
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,880
 where they found these sort of remnants that could be Amelia Earhart.

427
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,880
 I think they found like lipstick remnants and stuff.

428
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,000
 So they thought she'd been there.

429
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,440
 So they brought a pig carcass to the beach and they left it there.

430
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,640
 And there's a time lapse that I believe you can watch,

431
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,880
 which shows the crabs just destroying this thing,

432
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,200
 turning it to nothing within a week.

433
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,480
 It's really cool.

434
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,680
 But she wasn't killed by them, which should be clear.

435
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,480
 Although that would have been an awesome way to go.

436
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,040
 Well, we don't know. We don't know anything.

437
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:57,680
 We don't know.

438
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,720
 She might have been murdered by a coconut crab.

439
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:02,640
 There's so many theories, aren't there?

440
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,240
 They've come out about this over the last 70 odd years

441
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,440
 about her disappearance and everything from alien abduction

442
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:13,640
 through to she was captured by Japanese soldiers

443
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:18,520
 and was broadcasting as Tokyo Rose to, you know, all stuff like that.

444
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,880
 It's pretty exciting when you go through the big list.

445
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:26,600
 Yeah, I know you guys deal with facts, but in terms of feelings,

446
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,800
 do you think that, you know, if she was in any way kind of aware

447
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,440
 of what was going on, there's a bit of her that's like, damn, I didn't.

448
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:35,040
 I didn't succeed, but they're still obsessed with me.

449
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:35,880
 Do you know what I mean?

450
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,920
 Like the world is still like, what happened to Amelia Earhart?

451
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,560
 Yeah, I hope she's, yeah, she's up there going,

452
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,720
 thank God they've forgotten all about that noon and guy.

453
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:49,760
 She was really pro kind of getting as many women to fly aeroplanes

454
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,280
 as possible, wasn't she?

455
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:57,000
 She was the first president of the 99s, which was a group of women who

456
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,360
 basically were dedicated to ice creams, weren't they?

457
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,920
 That was it. That was all they used to do.

458
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,360
 Just eat ice creams all day.

459
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,640
 They had 99 problems, but a flake wasn't one.

460
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,640
 God.

461
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:08,720
 God.

462
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:14,920
 But they really, basically the first licenses you could get in America

463
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:19,080
 were in 1927 and within two years were 9,000 men with licenses

464
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,400
 and only 117 women.

465
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,960
 And so they started this club to try and encourage more women to fly.

466
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,840
 And there were some amazing people who were part of it.

467
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:32,840
 There was one woman called Opal Kuntz, who was part of the 99s.

468
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:37,000
 And she was one of the first women to, sorry, what?

469
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,760
 No, no, no, that's not much over that.

470
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,360
 Could you just say the name once more?

471
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,360
 Opal Kuntz.

472
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:47,840
 Opal Kuntz was one of the first people to fly against men in races.

473
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,920
 And she used to win them as well.

474
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,400
 She used to she was a really, really good racing pilot.

475
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:57,360
 And there was a thing in 1929 where it was the first women's air derby

476
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:01,600
 where they went all the way across America from Santa Monica to Cleveland, Ohio.

477
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,000
 And the newspapers called it the powder puff derby

478
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,160
 because it was all women taking part.

479
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:12,000
 There were 40 people who took part and she would have won it.

480
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,680
 But they said that her aircraft must have a horsepower appropriate for a woman.

481
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,520
 In other words, her plane was too fast.

482
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,760
 They wouldn't let her fly it.

483
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,600
 So she had to fly in a slower aeroplane and she came seven.

484
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,080
 I want to use her surname to describe them.

485
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,360
 Is that bad? No, it's quite right.

486
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,520
 And then the other thing about the 99s

487
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:35,960
 is Amelia Earhart had a thing called the Hat of the Month Programme.

488
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:40,520
 And she would give it to whichever member of the club flew to the most airports

489
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,560
 wearing a Stetson hat that she designed herself.

490
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:48,440
 That is so weird because she initially preferred hats to planes.

491
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:51,200
 What's her origin story, Amelia Earhart?

492
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,840
 It's really great. She wrote a diary that's quite detailed.

493
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,280
 So we know lots about what she thought.

494
00:24:55,280 --> 00:25:00,160
 And she saw her very first airplane when she was 10 at the Iowa State Fair.

495
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,000
 And there were planes there.

496
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,960
 And so she was 10 years old.

497
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,320
 She saw this plane and was like, I wasn't interested at all.

498
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,640
 It was just a bunch of kind of wood and wire.

499
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,040
 And someone said, look, dear, it flies.

500
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:15,000
 And she said, I was much more interested in an absurd hat made

501
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,400
 from an inverted peach basket that I just bought.

502
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,400
 And so that's that was her first love.

503
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,440
 So maybe she was all about the hats.

504
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:25,520
 The whole plane thing was so that she could get this Stetson hat competition.

505
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,920
 Right, she had her own fashion label, didn't she? I think.

506
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,640
 Back then, it was really hard to fund all of these projects.

507
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,040
 And she wrote some books and she used to go on lecture tours.

508
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:38,320
 But one of the other things she did was become one of the first

509
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,120
 for the modern era, celebrity fashion designers.

510
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,040
 And she had her own line, this Amelia Earhart fashion line,

511
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:47,960
 where she would incorporate bits of airplane onto the clothing as well.

512
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:52,520
 So she would have wing bolts and she would have, you know, sort of little.

513
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:57,160
 You know, that hat that people wear with a like a rotor on the top of it.

514
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,920
 She had that.

515
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,520
 Oh, God, I wish she did.

516
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,520
 No, I don't think so.

517
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,160
 I'm going to speak to my expedition buddies,

518
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:08,280
 because right now we're trying to approach like Dell to give us like funding.

519
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:14,440
 And I'm like, no, no, guys, let's just go design a fashion line to fund our expeditions.

520
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:18,680
 It kind of pioneered fashion a bit as well, didn't it?

521
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:25,240
 Because up until then women were wearing one piece suits or dress

522
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,120
 or it was always one thing.

523
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,680
 And she, with this fashion line, created the idea or at least popularized it

524
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:35,760
 quite nicely, separates the idea of matching this with this skirt,

525
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,240
 with this jacket, with this shirt, you know, you buy in different pieces.

526
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,160
 And that really wasn't a thing back then.

527
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:44,160
 And she kind of pushed it to be as part of her line.

528
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,520
 Wow.

529
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,720
 Ella, what was the name of that company

530
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:50,600
 that you want to give you some money for your next exhibition?

531
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,960
 Was it Dell, the makers of amazing computers

532
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,480
 that everyone should go and buy computers from?

533
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,160
 Dell, but I'll take IBM.

534
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,160
 I'll take anyone.

535
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,240
 I will take anyone.

536
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:05,000
 And then I will, I can't stop actually, because she didn't need to fund it.

537
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,680
 I will take anyone.

538
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,920
 Yeah, Dell already to sign off on that, you know,

539
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:14,640
 until you pinch yourself out to all of their competitors.

540
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,720
 Oops, oh well.

541
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,400
 Do you know, she did have one successful fundraising thing,

542
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,400
 which is what did fund her trips.

543
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,400
 And that was carrying letters.

544
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:28,520
 So she wasn't a carrier pigeon.

545
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,440
 She was, she was a postman.

546
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,240
 OK, this is this is actually her career.

547
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:38,080
 No, she was, um, she had this idea of basically crowdfunding

548
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,280
 by saying that she would take letters that people had written

549
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:44,360
 with commemorative stamps that said, like,

550
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,440
 I went all the way around the world with Amelia Earhart,

551
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,680
 or I went over the Atlantic with Amelia Earhart.

552
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:52,040
 So I think across the Atlantic, she had 100 or so commemorative stamps

553
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:54,960
 and she'd sign them and on her round the world trip, that plane.

554
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,800
 And when we find it, we'll have 5,000 stamped letters in.

555
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:03,600
 And she said that she's such a hassle on every stop along the way.

556
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,280
 She had to postmark every single one of those letters.

557
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:11,280
 With a sack, 5,000 letters down to the local post office

558
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,760
 in wherever, Hawaii.

559
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,360
 I wonder if I wonder if they told the bone-snipping dogs,

560
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,680
 you know, she used to be a postwoman, just to give them

561
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:20,680
 that extra bit of incentive.

562
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:28,000
 You know what? This makes me feel better that even Amelia Earhart

563
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,320
 struggled with financing her expeditions.

564
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,680
 This is just, this is information I needed, Anna.

565
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,080
 Bless you, thank you.

566
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,080
 That's offered to deliver mail as part of them.

567
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,000
 Where are you next going? I'm sure there are people who have letters.

568
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 Somaliland?

569
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,480
 Perfect.

570
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,600
 I, if anyone's got a friend in Somaliland, you need to write a letter.

571
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,080
 LSU Women.

572
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,640
 She charges a grand letter.

573
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,280
 Thank you.

574
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:56,400
 So Amelia Earhart was the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic.

575
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:01,560
 But she was actually the first woman to cross the Atlantic in a plane

576
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:04,680
 where she wasn't a solo flyer.

577
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:08,480
 And that was when she was a guest in the plane of Wilma Stoltz

578
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,360
 and a guy called Slim Gordon.

579
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:15,760
 And she spent the flight crouched in between the fuel tanks of the plane.

580
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,760
 So she went as a passenger over.

581
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:21,200
 But she said that she was no more useful than a sack of potatoes.

582
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,920
 When you eat potatoes.

583
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,400
 Yes, they are useful.

584
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,040
 She was less useful.

585
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,200
 You can make them into loads of different things, potatoes.

586
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,120
 They're probably one of the most useful of all the vegetables, aren't they?

587
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:35,280
 They're more edible than Amelia Earhart, unless you're a coconut crowd.

588
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:38,600
 Yeah, they're less good at flying a plane.

589
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,720
 Are they in emergency situations?

590
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,720
 They are. That's true.

591
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,360
 You wouldn't call on, you might call on Mr.

592
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,800
 Potato Head if you're really desperate, but he's probably the only potato you want.

593
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,040
 But yeah, that was actually what launched her flying career.

594
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,560
 Guesting or no, it wasn't what launched it, sorry.

595
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:58,560
 But that really propelled her to stratospheric heights, as it were, career wise,

596
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:02,920
 because she was put up to it by another woman called Amy Phipps Guest,

597
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:05,120
 who was actually this millionaire.

598
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,960
 And this woman, Amy Phipps, wanted to make the crossing.

599
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:11,000
 She was like, women can do just as much as men can do.

600
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,760
 I want to cross the Atlantic with these two chaps.

601
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,640
 And her family just begged her not to go.

602
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,480
 Like, we love you too much. You too, Rich. Come on, stay.

603
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,480
 So she said, OK, well, find me a suitable woman.

604
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:25,360
 And she hired a guy called George Putnam to find a woman who she wanted to be

605
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:29,200
 adventurous, but actually in Amelia's diary, by the time they tracked her down,

606
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:34,120
 they were looking for someone with social graces, education, charm and pulchritude.

607
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:38,240
 So the men had obviously slightly changed the advert on the way.

608
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,600
 G-S-O-H.

609
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,080
 Yes, yeah.

610
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,600
 But George Putnam found her and ended up marrying her

611
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,280
 as well as getting her on the flight.

612
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,760
 And when do we ever hear about George Putnam?

613
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:53,400
 Exactly. More airtime for George.

614
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:57,160
 So she had a wealthy benefactor to start off with.

615
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:00,520
 She did.

616
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:03,920
 This podcast is quickly becoming a how to fund my next expedition.

617
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:09,040
 I'm the rich woman. I hear Mrs. Melinda Gates.

618
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:15,640
 I don't know what the people at Dalla are going to think about that.

619
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,720
 I'll take any of them.

620
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:28,240
 OK, it is time for fact number three, and that is Anna.

621
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,200
 My fact this week is that scientists have started putting fossilised

622
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,720
 poos in particle accelerators.

623
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,160
 Why are they like that?

624
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,920
 Well, A, it's fun.

625
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:43,480
 And B, you can learn loads about the poo.

626
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 And so these are...

627
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,400
 So a particle accelerator, you get like an electron

628
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:52,520
 and you fire it round a great big tunnel and they smash into each other.

629
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:55,840
 Are they firing poos around this tunnel and smashing into each other?

630
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:59,480
 The poos are not taking the place of the electrons.

631
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:02,440
 No, although that would be such an awesome way to find the God Particle.

632
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:05,360
 No, it would be gross.

633
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:10,680
 You don't want to be the cleaner in the lab that day.

634
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:13,600
 Oh, guys.

635
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,160
 It's not messy. Don't panic. Is it like a little test tube?

636
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:19,840
 So this is this really amazing new way that they found of studying

637
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:23,920
 coprolites. So coprolites are fossilised feces and you can learn a lot about

638
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:26,960
 the thing that pooed out millions and millions of years ago, because, you know,

639
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,200
 it's preserved the stuff that they were eating inside it.

640
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:34,600
 And we said years ago on this podcast that the only way to study a coprolite

641
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,080
 is to cut it in half, which cut it into slices.

642
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:40,920
 Now, not true anymore, because you can put it in these very specific

643
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:43,480
 particle accelerators called synchrotrons.

644
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:47,400
 And so there's one called the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility.

645
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:52,360
 And basically you put the poo in there and the electrons

646
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:54,760
 are being fired round and round, around super, super fast.

647
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:58,080
 And if you just slightly change the electrons' direction along the way,

648
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:01,440
 they let out x-rays, but incredibly powerful x-rays.

649
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:06,040
 So the x-rays are 100 billion times brighter than the ones that you'd use in a hospital.

650
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:09,160
 So they see straight into the coprolite.

651
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,240
 Or they have lots of other purposes as well.

652
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,200
 The coprolite is one thing they do.

653
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,120
 It does feel cheaper, though, just to cut it in half with a knife, doesn't it?

654
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:19,840
 Yeah, if you don't have the budget.

655
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,240
 But also, then you've destroyed your coprolite.

656
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,960
 Then you've got two half-coprolites, don't you?

657
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,160
 This way you can keep the integrity of it.

658
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,480
 That's true, yeah.

659
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,120
 Although, as you just sort of trod on your own point, James,

660
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,440
 because then you do have two coprolites, which does seem like it's

661
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,760
 twice as good as having one, doesn't it, in some ways.

662
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,400
 That's true. I've got a pizza to sell you,

663
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,880
 which is eight slices, opposed to six slices.

664
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,840
 Damn it.

665
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,240
 But one person we haven't mentioned is Mary Anning,

666
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,160
 who was one of the first people to work out what a coprolite was.

667
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:55,920
 So she is these days a famous fossil collector

668
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,600
 from the south of England.

669
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:02,760
 Some people think that it's where we get she sells seashells on the seashore.

670
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:05,880
 It was supposedly named after her, whether it was, we don't know.

671
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:09,360
 But when you say these days, you mean she's famous these days,

672
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,240
 not that she's a fossil collector these days.

673
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,320
 She is herself quite close to being a fossil by now.

674
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,320
 She is quite dead.

675
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,080
 She is quite a dead person.

676
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,720
 It's what she would have wanted. It's fine.

677
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:22,160
 I know, I know.

678
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:25,680
 She was perhaps not really appreciated in her time,

679
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,720
 although a little bit more than you would expect,

680
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:31,160
 because she works with a guy called William Buckland,

681
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:34,360
 who was a very famous paleontologist.

682
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,440
 And when he wrote his paper,

683
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:40,080
 when he gave his paper to the Geological Society in London in 1829,

684
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,760
 he did recognise her by name.

685
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,280
 So, you know, she was kind of known in her time,

686
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,520
 but she wasn't allowed to be part of the Geological Society

687
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,400
 because they didn't allow women in those days.

688
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:54,960
 There was the Director of the Lime Regis Museum called David Tucker.

689
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,280
 He says that if she was born in 1970,

690
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:01,520
 she'd be heading up the Paleontology Department at Imperial or Cambridge by now.

691
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,960
 But as it was, she was just someone who collected fossils

692
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,600
 and learned about them and kind of wrote to this guy, William Buckland.

693
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:12,000
 But it was in the correspondence between these two people

694
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,440
 that the word "coprolite" first came into use.

695
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:19,400
 And the idea that these rocks with little bits of bone and stuff

696
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,400
 might be fossilised poos.

697
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,720
 It does feel like Buckland could have done a bit more

698
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,960
 to sort of give her a bit more cred,

699
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:28,840
 because he did clearly get on with her really well

700
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:32,760
 and took her seriously, took her ideas seriously as well.

701
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:37,640
 But when these ideas were being presented to other scientists,

702
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:41,880
 they even used her drawings of the dinosaurs that she sketched out,

703
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,840
 that she found, with no mention of her name.

704
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:46,800
 That was what was shown, and she got nothing.

705
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,480
 It's pretty extraordinary.

706
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,080
 Yeah, what was going through their heads?

707
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,040
 Did they look at those drawings, you wonder, and think,

708
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,840
 "Maybe I did draw that.

709
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:56,160
 Maybe I did find that fossil actually."

710
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,280
 You know, I don't remember everything I've done.

711
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:01,280
 (LAUGHTER)

712
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,280
 Because she sort of invented...

713
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:07,400
 I think this is why she invented the idea of drawing or imaginings

714
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,920
 of what these things that we found the fossils of would look like.

715
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,920
 So the reason that we now can picture like a T-rex or a Diplodocus or whatever

716
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,720
 is because she came up with, "Look, we've got to draw these things

717
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,480
 so people don't understand how they appeared."

718
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:22,760
 But there's a really cool thing about the drawings that she did,

719
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:27,200
 which is that she drew fossils with fossils.

720
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,880
 So she had a friend called Elizabeth Philpot,

721
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:33,520
 who was another great fossil collector at the time,

722
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:36,800
 and they found this Bellumknight fossil,

723
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,880
 which I think is an extinct kind of squid,

724
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,800
 and they found that it contained fossilized ink sacs.

725
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,760
 So you have squid ink, squid ink sacs.

726
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,120
 And her friend, Elizabeth Philpot,

727
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,520
 realised that you could grind up and still make ink.

728
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:51,600
 So Mary Ann Ink then used that process to grind it up,

729
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:55,280
 and with this 100 million-year-old squid ink,

730
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,800
 she drew some of her pictures.

731
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,120
 That is amazing.

732
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,320
 I have questions about this.

733
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,600
 How rare are those fossils?

734
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,400
 Because I just feel like today I wouldn't get away with that.

735
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:10,120
 Just filling up your lamy pen with some 100 million-year-old fossils.

736
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,440
 You're right.

737
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,200
 But aside from that, she was very cool.

738
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,000
 She was very attached to her dog,

739
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,360
 which very sadly died when she was out on a fossil-collecting trip.

740
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,160
 And she wrote a sweet letter saying that...

741
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,080
 Is she writing the dog's blood?

742
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,640
 Yeah, she was out of fossil-collecting,

743
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,520
 and this cliff collapsed and nearly killed her.

744
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,480
 Basically, this huge cliff fell down inches away from her

745
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,160
 and crushed her little dog.

746
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,240
 Oh, no.

747
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,720
 Sad.

748
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,680
 Just one last thing on Mary Ann Ink.

749
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:40,320
 I said about David Tucker at the Lime Regis Museum.

750
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,480
 The Lime Regis Museum,

751
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,000
 you can go and learn some stuff about Mary Ann Ink.

752
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,560
 And it is in the place where she was born.

753
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,720
 That's where the museum is.

754
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:53,520
 But it's a complete coincidence that it's in that same building.

755
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,520
 No.

756
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,640
 Yeah, they bought this place,

757
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:58,360
 and they didn't realise that that was where she was born.

758
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:02,000
 And it turned out that the actual area where the family lived

759
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,760
 has since fallen into the sea.

760
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:07,760
 But it was a bit of the building that was attached to where they lived,

761
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,760
 which is now where the museum is.

762
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,360
 Wow. Is that the bit that squashed the dog?

763
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,720
 Wouldn't that be a thing if that was true?

764
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:15,720
 Oh, my goodness.

765
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,400
 It sort of swings around about, you know.

766
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,960
 We lost the dog. We've now got a seafront view.

767
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:24,640
 It's so dark.

768
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:29,160
 The oldest human copper light we have in existence is a Neanderthal one

769
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:32,320
 from 50,000 years ago in a Spanish site.

770
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:36,280
 And what I love most about it is it was on top of a hearth.

771
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,560
 So you've got to imagine there was a fire.

772
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,560
 They put the fire out and the guy was like,

773
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,680
 "Just give me a second. Give me a second, lads."

774
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,000
 "Just going to do a number two."

775
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,960
 Probably didn't wash his hands. You might know him, Dan.

776
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,960
 And then went about his business.

777
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,840
 I was descended.

778
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:56,240
 But yeah, it's just, it's kind of wonderful.

779
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,280
 Wow. Pooing in the fireplace.

780
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:01,200
 No manners than Neanderthals. That's why they died out.

781
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,280
 Well, did we learn about that?

782
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,320
 Do we learn anything about that Neanderthal poo?

783
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,120
 Like what they ate and stuff like that?

784
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:10,480
 Yes. So it turns out they, obviously, they meet.

785
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,120
 That's not surprising, but they did eat veggies,

786
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,200
 which some people still find surprising.

787
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,640
 I don't know why. Why would they? Why would that be weird?

788
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:21,480
 But they also found a whole pile of parasites.

789
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,120
 So, Pidworms and a whole pile of other stuff

790
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,760
 that I think if they'd have found them in a modern human,

791
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,880
 they would say that person would be very, very sick.

792
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:30,240
 So either they were really hardy, basically,

793
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:34,200
 or the poor guy was really, or woman, was really sick.

794
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:37,320
 But also, I just, I kind of, I love human poo,

795
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,160
 like coprolites because, sorry,

796
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:42,160
 probably shouldn't say it like that, but it's just that,

797
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,480
 you know, when people talk about the paleo diet,

798
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,400
 for me, kind of people that really into the paleo diet,

799
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,080
 there's always a bit of bouginess about it.

800
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,560
 Don't get me wrong, I'm quite bougie as well,

801
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,240
 but there's an element of like,

802
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,440
 "Oh, you know, there's this like, blah, blah, blah."

803
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,920
 And it's actually like, "Well, the real paleo diet,

804
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:59,760
 these guys all had worms and they're all dead by 30, you know."

805
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,120
 And shitting on the fire.

806
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,960
 Exactly. Exactly.

807
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:07,080
 Like, I got a kick out for this one paleo diet restaurant.

808
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:09,280
 I was trying to explain to the lady in the paleo diet restaurant,

809
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,480
 as you do as an academic, you know, just completely obnoxious.

810
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,640
 Actually, the real paleo diet wouldn't have been the chicken breast.

811
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,280
 It would have been all parts of the chicken.

812
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,320
 So, are you serving chicken eyes?

813
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,720
 And dozens of the animal?

814
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,920
 Are you serving the poor girl?

815
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,040
 Oh, no.

816
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:30,840
 Speaking of technology being used for studying Neanderthals,

817
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:35,200
 I was reading this in BBC Future and they said that in 2013,

818
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:39,120
 they discovered that the genetic code for penis spines

819
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:41,200
 is lacking from Neanderthals,

820
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,520
 which means that we know in theory

821
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,600
 that they didn't have spines on their penises.

822
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:50,040
 And what that apparently shows us is that they were more monogamous

823
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,560
 than we might have thought they were in the past,

824
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:59,040
 because usually the animals with penis spines are more like people from Yemen.

825
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,480
 They tend to have spines.

826
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,440
 Oh, my God.

827
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,120
 So, Dad, you're telling me?

828
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:10,960
 At one point, somebody turned around and was like,

829
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:14,120
 "Why don't you marry a second wife, Dr. Ashima?"

830
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:16,760
 And my dad was like, "Oh, one's enough for me."

831
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:21,480
 My mum's reaction was, "Ah, no, hold on. That's an insult."

832
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:26,400
 I love that they can look at the genomes of these like ancient,

833
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,840
 like long, long dead species of humans

834
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:33,040
 and can tell you something as kind of weird as that,

835
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,320
 how many sexual partners they might have had.

836
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,680
 That's extraordinary.

837
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:39,680
 So, do you mean kind of like a penis bone is what you're talking about?

838
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:43,000
 No, so like animals would have spikes on their penises.

839
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:43,840
 A lot of them do.

840
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,480
 Spike. Sorry, I heard spine.

841
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,240
 OK, yeah. Oh, yeah, I did say spine.

842
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,280
 Yeah, it's all spines like spines.

843
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:54,560
 And the spikes were basically clearing out previous gentlemen's stuff

844
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,680
 that was in there using these.

845
00:41:56,680 --> 00:42:01,120
 Exactly, and so it's more necessary for a polyamorous species

846
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:05,720
 because you're more likely to have stuff to clean out from there, so to speak.

847
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,000
 Oh, interesting.

848
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
 So, Neanderthals were all romantics,

849
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,080
 monogamous romantics is what we can do.

850
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:13,240
 Yeah, let's go with that, the romantics.

851
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,640
 And I read another study.

852
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,680
 This is from the University of California, San Diego Laboratory,

853
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:21,960
 and they made some tiny brains.

854
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:25,880
 They're not conscious brains, but they're kind of brain cells.

855
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:30,960
 And using CRISPR, which is like the gene editing thing,

856
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:35,080
 they made some that were human and some that had Neanderthal genes in them.

857
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:39,440
 And the Neanderthal ones matured much quicker than the human ones did.

858
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:44,160
 And what they inferred from that is that perhaps young

859
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:47,240
 and Neanderthals would be more capable than younger humans.

860
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:50,200
 But then perhaps the Homo sapiens, as they got older,

861
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,600
 would have gotten better or smarter.

862
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,520
 I don't know if any of this is true, Ella or Emma?

863
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:58,800
 No, it's completely, completely true, as I would expect from you, James.

864
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,600
 But no, yeah, they're called organoids.

865
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:05,120
 That's what they made, these kind of little brain things.

866
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:08,200
 And it's really interesting because it plays into this theory.

867
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:10,160
 Anna, what you're saying, you know, why did they die out?

868
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:14,240
 Well, there's this one theory that suggests that because we,

869
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:18,520
 we, as in modern humans, Homo sapiens, have an extended juvenile period.

870
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:21,680
 Basically, we don't become adults very quickly at all.

871
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:24,680
 That that's given us a competitive advantage,

872
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:28,760
 because it means we play and play is really good for creativity, imagination,

873
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:30,200
 invention, blah, blah, blah.

874
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:33,400
 And obviously, it's absolutely, it's not impossible to prove it.

875
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,880
 But it's, I mean, it is kind of, I guess.

876
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:38,680
 But it's just really interesting to think that the Neanderthals

877
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:43,680
 kind of growing up so quickly might be one of the reasons why they became extinct.

878
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:47,200
 But you are, you are right as well, when you say that, you know,

879
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:50,920
 we kind of know a certain amount about Neanderthals from their DNA.

880
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:53,960
 We know a lot about them from their DNA, including, obviously,

881
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:56,880
 that all of us have about 2% Neanderthal DNA in us.

882
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:00,640
 So all a wee bit Neanderthal, which is, you know, I think is really cute,

883
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,160
 because it means they're not completely gone.

884
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,640
 They're still with us a little bit.

885
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:07,880
 Yeah, if you have more, you know how Dan is like a particularly hairy man.

886
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:11,760
 Does that mean that he's more likely to have more Neanderthal in him?

887
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:15,240
 Or is, does it not kind of, can you not see from the outside

888
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:17,920
 how Neanderthal someone is, you have to go into the genes and.

889
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,960
 Yeah, you have to go into the genes, because as hairy as Neanderthals,

890
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,560
 as hairy as Neanderthal might be, as hairy as Dan might be.

891
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:29,800
 Sorry, Dan, we actually, we don't actually know that Neanderthals were hairy.

892
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,560
 That's kind of just something that got into public imagination.

893
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:36,440
 But no, there's no real, how do you know what I mean?

894
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:38,600
 How do you even prove that?

895
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:39,600
 We don't know.

896
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,920
 How about the fact that I keep ruining parties

897
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,440
 by having a shit on the fireplace?

898
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:48,760
 You can't blame that on your genes, sadly.

899
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:58,360
 OK, it is time for fact number four, and that is James.

900
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:02,160
 OK, my fact this week is that Frasier Crane was an early investor

901
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,320
 in Microsoft.

902
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:06,000
 How?

903
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,840
 Because one of them is real.

904
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:11,520
 One of them is real, which one?

905
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:13,760
 How did they cross this weird space of time?

906
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:17,960
 And why did he not go with Dell, which is a far superior company?

907
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:21,400
 So Frasier Crane, obviously fictional character

908
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:24,600
 from the incredibly popular American sitcom, Frasier.

909
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:27,040
 Microsoft, obviously a real company.

910
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:31,720
 And this is a made up back story, which we found out about

911
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:35,800
 because our old friend Richard Osman tweeted that he didn't

912
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:38,960
 understand how Frasier could possibly afford to live in such

913
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:41,600
 a nice apartment in Seattle on his wages.

914
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:46,440
 And then one of the writers, Joe Keenan, replied and said

915
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:49,680
 that they'd kind of talked about it in the writers' room on occasion.

916
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:53,360
 And they said that they decided that he must have invested his money

917
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:58,360
 from his Boston practice very wisely, perhaps in a friend's Seattle

918
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:00,360
 software startup.

919
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:03,880
 And we can only infer from that that the Seattle software

920
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:06,960
 startup must be Microsoft because, apart from anything else,

921
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:10,360
 Bill Gates was on Frasier as a character.

922
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:13,440
 And in that episode, he did say he was a fan of Frasier.

923
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:18,440
 So he didn't mention that Frasier had invested in his company beforehand.

924
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:19,920
 But, you know, that's what I mean.

925
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,400
 That's a bit gauche, isn't it?

926
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:22,960
 You don't say that in public.

927
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:23,720
 Exactly.

928
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:28,400
 That's yeah, there is an episode where one of his I think it's his nephew

929
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:32,040
 with someone who's coming into town and he desperately wants to get a tour

930
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:36,200
 of the Microsoft offices and Frasier is desperately looking for any contact

931
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:41,120
 that he has. It's just curious that as an investor, he didn't have an in.

932
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:43,680
 I think what happened is that he'd sold all his shares at that point

933
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:46,520
 and people had got a bit upset because it had forced the price down

934
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:49,520
 and they I'm just making stuff up there.

935
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:53,240
 I was like, oh, OK, yeah, yeah.

936
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:56,360
 Yeah, because because you're right, because there was that it was Freddy.

937
00:46:56,360 --> 00:47:00,000
 So it's his son and he was trying to find somebody that knew anyone at

938
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:05,480
 Microsoft and then he convinced Ross to to get in contact with an ex-boyfriend.

939
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:08,720
 And even when it's because this is like a mega fan talking here.

940
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:13,880
 Even when Bill Gates comes in, he calls him.

941
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:16,800
 It's very clear that they don't know each other very well at all.

942
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,520
 And he calls him sir.

943
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:22,120
 And I'm just saying I'm just saying I think these writers.

944
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:26,520
 It might be a cover up like how probably Boris Johnson would call

945
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:29,280
 James Dyson, sir, if he walked in, you know, sometimes you don't want

946
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:32,360
 to be open about quite how tight you are to power.

947
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:35,880
 Never know. I mean, also, I'm not part of the investor class.

948
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:39,600
 So I also just don't know if you even need to know Bill Gates

949
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:41,720
 to invest in Microsoft. I'm assuming maybe you don't.

950
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:43,000
 Yeah, that's true, actually.

951
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:47,720
 If you if you were to buy some stocks in Tesla, you don't have to have

952
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:51,520
 an interview with Elon Musk beforehand to make sure he's a friend.

953
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,840
 Probably a good thing.

954
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:55,760
 You know, they're rebooting.

955
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:58,400
 Yeah, are they? Yeah, yeah.

956
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,280
 I now feel like I'm going to have to go back and watch it all

957
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:03,280
 from the start, because I've just seen it very sporadically.

958
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,600
 Well, you should actually start from Cheers and properly

959
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:07,320
 watch his character development.

960
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:08,680
 It's like delicious.

961
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:11,360
 Well, that's so we should say this is the most interesting

962
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:15,360
 thing about Frasier is that it's a spin off series of one of the other

963
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:18,600
 most popular American sitcoms of all time, Cheers.

964
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:21,440
 And he was a character who just came in and sat at the bar.

965
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,360
 He was only meant to be in for a few episodes, but he proved to be

966
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:28,080
 so popular with audiences that they wrote him into the series more and more.

967
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:31,240
 And eventually when they ended, they thought, what are we going to do next

968
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:34,480
 as a team? And Frasier was this spin off.

969
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:37,400
 You know, that happened a couple of times.

970
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:41,320
 Does it not even used to annoy me when I was younger that it felt like

971
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:44,240
 there was a disconnect between his character there and then his character

972
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:47,440
 in Frasier or it was like kind of confusing to my young head.

973
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:49,400
 I was like, how is that the same person?

974
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:54,200
 And he seems a bit different and there is lots of inconsistency as a superfan,

975
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:56,360
 which must stress you out, Ella, surely.

976
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:59,320
 Like, I think his it's mentioned that he has a horrible relationship

977
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:01,720
 with his dad or something in Cheers though.

978
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:03,960
 Actually, I think still does.

979
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:06,360
 I think in Cheers, they said that his father was dead.

980
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:12,320
 Yes. And then another character from Cheers came to visit him in the in

981
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:13,920
 the second sitcom.

982
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,680
 He said, I thought you said your father was dead.

983
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:17,480
 And he said, oh, we were fighting.

984
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:19,920
 So that's how they taught that I see.

985
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,240
 Clever, good luck.

986
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:22,440
 They do a few things like that.

987
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:29,520
 Yeah. So the Cheers was set in Boston and they wanted to have this new sitcom,

988
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,280
 but they didn't want it to be too close to Boston because then you would have

989
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:35,760
 to deal with all the previous characters and you would have to explain

990
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:37,120
 why they're not there, et cetera.

991
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:40,000
 But if you move to the other side of the country, you can get away with it.

992
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,080
 So they're going to move to Denver, Colorado.

993
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:47,000
 But then in 1992, there was a group called Colorado for Family Values

994
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:52,400
 that pushed an amendment, which was described by the writers of Cheers

995
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:57,120
 as an egregious anti-gay amendment, which was basically stopping any gay rights

996
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:58,600
 in Colorado.

997
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:02,760
 And if you read the newspapers from the time, it was a huge, huge, huge deal.

998
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:05,560
 A load of films stopped being filmed there.

999
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:08,680
 They were going to do a Stephen King movie there and they didn't do it in Colorado.

1000
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:12,120
 And then David Lee, who was one of the show's creators, said that they were going

1001
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:15,240
 to do they were going to put Fraser in Colorado in Denver,

1002
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:19,000
 but they had to move it away from there because they didn't want to be associated

1003
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,680
 with this anti-gay amendment.

1004
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:26,680
 And then in 1996, four years later, the US Supreme Court declared it was unconstitutional.

1005
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:30,120
 So it got kicked out anyway, but they lost all of this kind of investment

1006
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:33,880
 and all of these shows and stuff just refused to go to Colorado.

1007
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:36,520
 In your face, Colorado, that's what you get.

1008
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:41,120
 Because I feel like I know the space needle now because of because of Fraser.

1009
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:42,760
 Yes. Yeah.

1010
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:45,640
 But they all did cameo in Fraser at times, didn't they?

1011
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:50,680
 Except one main Cheers character who was Rebecca, who actually

1012
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:53,200
 was probably maybe the most annoying Cheers character anyway, I think,

1013
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:56,760
 from what I vaguely remember, but she never guested in Fraser.

1014
00:50:56,760 --> 00:51:00,000
 And it was an actress who is called Kirstie Alley.

1015
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,600
 And she said that she turned it down because as a Scientologist,

1016
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:08,200
 her beliefs forbid things like psychiatry.

1017
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:11,640
 So Scientologists are very anti-psychiatry, which I didn't realize.

1018
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:12,640
 How interesting.

1019
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:15,120
 Yeah. Although she did give an interview saying this.

1020
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:18,720
 And then the show creator, David Lee, said, I don't remember asking her.

1021
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:24,120
 I mean, she was a big deal.

1022
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:25,320
 She would have been asked at some point.

1023
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:27,280
 She would have been asked. Yeah.

1024
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:31,200
 You know, Kelsey Grammer in that show, quite a fascinating story

1025
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:35,640
 of how he went from being this character that was just a normal actor.

1026
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:38,480
 And it happens in these sitcoms where the actor becomes

1027
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,360
 the biggest part of the show generally.

1028
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:41,520
 They become an exec producer.

1029
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:42,560
 They start directing.

1030
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:46,520
 They start his power grew so great as he was going on that he could start

1031
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:49,760
 pulling these power moves, which felt really bizarre.

1032
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:54,400
 So one of the things was he employed an acting method that he called requisite

1033
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:59,280
 disrespect. And the thing was, is that he said he would rehearse each scene

1034
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:04,000
 only once and he would not learn his lines until the moments before

1035
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,200
 the scene was shot.

1036
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:09,240
 And in some cases go, OK, I'll do it better and not even use the lines.

1037
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:14,160
 He said he'd played the role so long that he could now embody any kind

1038
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,960
 of remark that would come out of Fraser better than a script writer

1039
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:18,960
 and just became Fraser Crane himself.

1040
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:21,560
 I'll just say whatever I want to say in this show now.

1041
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:23,520
 That's kind of, you know, it works.

1042
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:29,040
 The best actor in Fraser, of course, was Moose, who played the dog, Eddie.

1043
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:35,160
 And he retired at the end of season seven and his son, Enzo, took over the role.

1044
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:39,080
 But what I find interesting about that is Moose had been deliberately

1045
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:44,480
 bred to create a new child, which would look enough like him that they would

1046
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:48,160
 be able to bring him in when he retired, which I think is just a really

1047
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:50,960
 interesting idea of imagine that happened with humans that you were

1048
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:54,880
 you're an actor in a show and they're like, OK, we're going to find someone

1049
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:59,080
 for you to mate with who looks the right kind of person that when you have kids,

1050
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:01,200
 they'll be able to come up and take your place.

1051
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:03,400
 Well, and they cocked it up a bit, didn't they?

1052
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:06,400
 Because they had to paint Enzo's fur to match his dad.

1053
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,400
 Didn't quite nail the patterns.

1054
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:10,880
 They didn't. And also, they hated each other.

1055
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:12,400
 The father and son.

1056
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:17,520
 Father and son, the creator, Peter Casey, called their relationship

1057
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,920
 a classic parent-child Hollywood rivalry.

1058
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:22,880
 By all accounts, Moose was horrible.

1059
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:25,040
 So Eddie, quite lovable on the show.

1060
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:27,120
 Moose was like, bitey.

1061
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:30,400
 Everyone hated him like the trainer didn't like anyone else on set

1062
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:31,960
 and really hated his son.

1063
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:33,800
 Enzo, they had to be kept apart.

1064
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:38,920
 Do you think they were basically mirroring the Frasier and his father's relationship?

1065
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:42,120
 Oh, I hope there's a behind the scenes documentary

1066
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:45,080
 where it's from their perspective, bickering at each other.

1067
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:47,720
 And you've just got Frasier and the dad in the background.

1068
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:51,640
 Well, didn't the dad actually adopt?

1069
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:52,920
 Didn't he adopt?

1070
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:54,320
 I think Ross did.

1071
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:56,520
 The actor who played Ross, Perry Gilpin.

1072
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:58,240
 Yeah. Yeah. Right.

1073
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:03,760
 My favourite fact about Frasier is that the pilot was six minutes too long.

1074
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:05,240
 And they chopped and chopped and chopped.

1075
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:09,160
 And finally they had a pilot that ended up a 60 seconds longer

1076
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:11,600
 than it should have been for the slot.

1077
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:15,320
 So they handed it in and they said, we're sorry, we just can't do anything.

1078
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:17,320
 It's 60 seconds too long.

1079
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:21,760
 And amazingly, the network went, OK, so NBC agreed with it.

1080
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:26,920
 And they found extra time by taking 15 seconds of four other shows

1081
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:29,360
 that were airing that night.

1082
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:32,160
 That's how you know you're the favourite of the night.

1083
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:36,000
 Are you saying like if you remember that one episode of like Party of Five

1084
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,800
 where it ends really abruptly, that was probably the night that Frasier went out.

1085
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:43,840
 You remember that game of basketball where it was all tied up with 50 seconds left?

1086
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:49,440
 Lisa Kudrow, who plays Phoebe in Friends,

1087
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:55,200
 actually had the job of Ross initially and got fired before they even really started.

1088
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:58,160
 And you're saying Ross, not Ross, aren't you?

1089
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:00,240
 Because for Lisa Kudrow, she cast as Ross.

1090
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:05,440
 We're talking about a random factor suddenly throw in Ella.

1091
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:08,440
 We're talking about Frasier here. Come on.

1092
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:11,000
 Sorry, Ross, that was supposed to be Lisa Kudrow.

1093
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,400
 It was Lisa Kudrow and then she got fired.

1094
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:19,120
 And you can imagine like she has stories about how people were so shocked

1095
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:22,840
 that she got fired from this massive show that they were like looking at her like,

1096
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:24,240
 oh, we are so sorry.

1097
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:26,720
 Like she just she wanted to just die basically.

1098
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:28,440
 She fell her feet in the end.

1099
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:32,120
 Right. She went to a fortune teller who was like, it's OK.

1100
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,560
 I see big things for you.

1101
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:36,160
 And if I was like, it's absolutely bullshit, Lisa, your career is over.

1102
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:41,480
 And then. Well, she said that she she was so depressed.

1103
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:45,280
 I think that day or that kind of in those few days, she went to a party

1104
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:50,120
 and she she was just like, oh, this is so I'm so past it.

1105
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:51,160
 I've got nothing else.

1106
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:52,720
 And she sees this cute guy.

1107
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:54,000
 She just goes, why not?

1108
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,600
 Nothing else is who cares?

1109
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:57,440
 I'm just going to go hit on him and she ended up marrying him.

1110
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:02,480
 So it's really it's kind of a woman who's just managed to make it all work for her

1111
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:04,440
 from from being, you know, fired.

1112
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:06,600
 It's amazing what Scientology can do, isn't it?

1113
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:08,640
 No, no, no, no.

1114
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:10,600
 No, this is Lisa Kudrow.

1115
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:12,680
 Lisa Kudrow is like a nice Jewish girl.

1116
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:16,200
 Hey, question.

1117
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:20,000
 Which actor in Frasier is from Manchester?

1118
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:24,640
 Oh, well, Jay Leaves, Jay Leaves, the British one.

1119
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:26,840
 Incorrect.

1120
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:29,360
 So devastated to learn this.

1121
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:30,200
 She's not.

1122
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:33,560
 I think she grew up in East Grinstead, which is very much the south of England.

1123
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:35,040
 And I'm a Scientology.

1124
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:38,240
 So I guess the alley.

1125
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:40,760
 Stop picking everyone up Frasier Scientologist.

1126
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:44,160
 Really, I'm saying it's a broad church.

1127
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:46,280
 No, so she was asked to do that accent.

1128
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:47,640
 That wasn't a real accent.

1129
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:48,760
 And she's from there.

1130
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:52,640
 But John Mahoney, who plays Martin, the dad is from Manchester.

1131
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:55,800
 So he was born in Blackpool, but his family were from Manchester.

1132
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:59,080
 And he was schooled, schooled and raised in Manchester.

1133
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:00,200
 Isn't that weird?

1134
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:04,000
 Yeah, you know how we all used to really kind of laugh at her accent

1135
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,440
 being a Mancunian accent, because it was just really weird accent.

1136
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:10,960
 I caught a clip of her once, kind of, where somebody very politely

1137
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:14,120
 on one of the English morning shows was like, your accent's not really.

1138
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:15,400
 Like, it was, you know, it was a dig.

1139
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:17,800
 But, you know, it was morning television, so they were trying to be polite.

1140
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:21,480
 And you could tell that she was very aware of it and kind of a bit

1141
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:22,520
 like stressed about it.

1142
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:25,280
 And she kind of said, well, you know, I was told that the

1143
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:29,360
 the the actual accent that I had was too, it was too strong

1144
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:32,040
 and the Americans wouldn't, you know, understand it.

1145
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:34,840
 So the actual Mancunian accent was, was, you know,

1146
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:36,840
 considered to be inappropriate or something.

1147
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:38,320
 Oh, yes. I read that.

1148
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:42,560
 She was trained to do a relatable to the Americans Mancunian version.

1149
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:46,560
 Or that's what she's claiming.

1150
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:49,760
 I thought I'd read that she, her character was living in America

1151
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:52,840
 for so long at that point, that she had a kind of transatlantic

1152
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:58,400
 drool that had seeped into the Mancunian accent and had distorted it.

1153
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:01,400
 She's all sorts of excuses, isn't she?

1154
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:03,640
 It's like worse than your accent.

1155
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:06,640
 Like, it's like there's there's like.

1156
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:08,640
 I mean, I assume you're talking to me.

1157
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:10,240
 Sorry.

1158
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:13,040
 Well, actually, well, for any Americans listening,

1159
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:14,920
 like I'm from just outside Manchester,

1160
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:17,440
 so she should have an accent that's a bit like mine.

1161
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:20,240
 Instead, it's a bit Yorkshire and then just weird.

1162
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:21,640
 It's a bit, God knows.

1163
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:24,760
 It's just too many things.

1164
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:26,760
 It's lovable, which is all that matters.

1165
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:29,320
 A lovable accent.

1166
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:32,040
 I read a quote from David Hyde Pierce, who plays Niles,

1167
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:34,920
 who said, "To me, Jane is in Jane, Jane leaves.

1168
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:37,160
 To me, Jane and Daphne were identical,

1169
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:39,680
 exquisite and charming with fragrant hair

1170
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:42,040
 that smelled like puppies, springtime and sex."

1171
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:44,000
 Wow.

1172
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,600
 That's what I'm saying, he's gay.

1173
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:47,880
 Yeah, exactly.

1174
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:50,720
 It's OK, because he is gay, but otherwise it wouldn't be.

1175
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:53,240
 I have to say that's a show that's aged really well.

1176
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:56,920
 You know, a lot of the shows from that period

1177
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:59,280
 are a lot of kind of issues that you just,

1178
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:01,880
 jokes that you just wouldn't be able to get away with now.

1179
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:05,000
 That's one of those shows that's aged really well,

1180
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:08,920
 because the joke is always on whoever is being, you know, the...

1181
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:12,680
 Oh, it's basically, it's never on.

1182
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:15,800
 So it's unlike a lot of the other shows of its time.

1183
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:17,400
 Yeah, take that, Lisa Kudrow.

1184
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:21,480
 I might have made the wrong choice there.

1185
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:24,240
 OK, that's it.

1186
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:25,360
 That is all of our facts.

1187
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:26,960

 It's called The Handshake, A Gripping History.

1203
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:58,200
 It is absolutely awesome.

1204
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:00,560
 You got a bit of a hint of the stuff that's in there in this episode.

1205

 There is so much more.

1206
