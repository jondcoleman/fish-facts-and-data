00:00:00,00:00:02,"Hey, everyone, welcome to this week's episode of Fish."
00:00:02,00:00:05,"Before we begin, just to let you know that we have a special guest on this week."
00:00:05,00:00:09,Andy is away looking at thatched roofs around the UK.
00:00:09,00:00:13,"And so in his place, we have got the brilliant Ella Al-Shemahi."
00:00:13,00:00:16,Ella is a National Geographic explorer.
00:00:16,00:00:20,"She's a paleoanthropologist, an evolutionary biologist, a standup comedian."
00:00:20,00:00:21,She's extraordinary.
00:00:21,00:00:24,"And she's written this new book, which is called The Handshake, A Gripping History."
00:00:24,00:00:27,"It's all about, as it says on the tin, the handshake."
00:00:27,00:00:29,"You know, where did it come from?"
00:00:29,00:00:30,How long have we had it?
00:00:30,00:00:32,Is it dead after this pandemic?
00:00:32,00:00:33,It really is an awesome book.
00:00:33,00:00:35,It's got amazing chapters.
00:00:35,00:00:37,"I mean, take this as a chapter headline, chapter number three,"
00:00:37,00:00:39,finger snaps and penis shakes.
00:00:39,00:00:40,Who doesn't want this book?
00:00:40,00:00:42,So do go out and get it.
00:00:42,00:00:43,It's available online.
00:00:43,00:00:46,You can go back into physical bookshops as well to pick one up
00:00:46,00:00:48,and do follow her adventures online as well.
00:00:48,00:00:51,She can be found on Twitter on @ella_alshamahi.
00:00:51,00:00:53,Do that because she is packed with facts.
00:00:53,00:00:54,That's right.
00:00:54,00:00:57,And you'll be getting a bit of a taster of those in the upcoming episode.
00:00:57,00:01:00,"But sadly, of course, Andy is going to be back next week,"
00:01:00,00:01:03,and he's also going to be joining us for our upcoming tour.
00:01:03,00:01:06,We couldn't convince Ella to come on that instead.
00:01:06,00:01:07,"But yeah, we've got a tour coming up."
00:01:07,00:01:08,Please join us.
00:01:08,00:01:12,"We are going to lots of fun places, Belfast, Birmingham, Nottingham,"
00:01:12,00:01:16,"Peterborough, Richmond, Dublin, and then loads more."

00:01:28,00:01:31,You can have a bath on your own.
00:01:31,00:01:39,"Hello and welcome to another episode of Know Such Thing as a Fish,"
00:01:39,00:01:44,a weekly podcast coming to you from four undisclosed locations in the UK.
00:01:44,00:01:46,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:01:46,00:01:50,"I am sitting here with James Harkin, Anna Tyshinski"
00:01:50,00:01:54,"and our special guest, it is paleo anthropologist Ella Al-Shamahi."
00:01:54,00:01:57,"And once again, we have gathered round our microphones"
00:01:57,00:02:00,with our four favourite facts from the last seven days.
00:02:00,00:02:02,"And in no particular order, here we go."
00:02:02,00:02:06,"Starting with fact number one, that is Ella."
00:02:06,00:02:10,"My fact is that an anti-handshake society was formed in Baku, Azerbaijan"
00:02:10,00:02:13,in 1894 because of a cholera outbreak.
00:02:13,00:02:16,You paid six rubles as membership.
00:02:16,00:02:18,You wore a pin to identify yourself.
00:02:19,00:02:21,"And just in case you did slip up and shake hands,"
00:02:21,00:02:23,you had to pay three rubles as a fine.
00:02:23,00:02:26,You're volunteering to be fined.
00:02:26,00:02:29,"If you didn't join the society, you didn't have to be fined."
00:02:29,00:02:32,"Yeah, I mean, there's a question about the money there, isn't it?"
00:02:32,00:02:36,Six as membership and then three every single time you shake hands.
00:02:36,00:02:38,"Yeah, but if you're signing up, you're fairly confident"
00:02:38,00:02:40,"that you're not going to be doing the handshaking, right?"
00:02:40,00:02:43,"Like, that's it's like instituting the swear box or something."
00:02:45,00:02:48,"But I love the pin that, you know, it's basically declaring"
00:02:48,00:02:51,that you're really not involved at all.
00:02:51,00:02:53,You're not having any part of it.
00:02:53,00:02:56,Do you think that pin is so that people can see you and think
00:02:56,00:02:58,that guy is not to be handshuck?
00:02:58,00:03:00,I think so. I think it's to identify yourself.
00:03:00,00:03:03,But I do have questions about how many people were actually wearing these pins.
00:03:03,00:03:06,"You know, is it just you and Mike down the street?"
00:03:06,00:03:08,Or was it actually a lot of people wearing it?
00:03:08,00:03:10,I don't. You're talking about it like it was a police badge.
00:03:10,00:03:13,I don't think anyone was staring at the badge anyway.
00:03:13,00:03:17,"It was probably a badge that was like, I love Ninja Turtles that, you know,"
00:03:17,00:03:21,"I would wear like, yeah, it's on me, but no one's no one's paying attention."
00:03:21,00:03:23,"Right. I mean, who knows?"
00:03:23,00:03:25,This is this is way back since over a hundred years ago.
00:03:25,00:03:28,"But the thing that I love about this bit is that the lancet of all things,"
00:03:28,00:03:31,"which is obviously really respectable medical journal,"
00:03:31,00:03:35,absolutely blasted them for this and just blasted them for not refusing
00:03:35,00:03:39,"to shake hands during an epidemic, which is hilarious, obviously, today."
00:03:39,00:03:40,And they're basically are these Russians.
00:03:40,00:03:42,They've taken everything too seriously.
00:03:42,00:03:43,They've completely lost it.
00:03:43,00:03:46,"Obviously, that has not aged well, has it?"
00:03:46,00:03:50,So they knew that shaking hands was going to be bad for the spread of cholera.
00:03:50,00:03:51,This is why they did it.
00:03:51,00:03:54,"So, yes, this society knew it."
00:03:54,00:03:56,"Obviously, generally, the people in that area didn't."
00:03:56,00:03:58,"And more importantly, the whole of the Western medical establishment"
00:03:58,00:04:00,thought they were lunatics.
00:04:00,00:04:03,"So this is a story that just kept getting repeated everywhere,"
00:04:03,00:04:06,"kind of in that that period, which is people going,"
00:04:06,00:04:07,what is going on with these Russians?
00:04:07,00:04:11,"I mean, that's about it, but at the time, it was, you know, they were clad as Russians."
00:04:11,00:04:16,"Yeah, that was a really bad cholera outbreak in Baku, started in 1892."
00:04:16,00:04:20,"And when it first got into the town, they didn't have a single microscope"
00:04:20,00:04:26,in the entire city and everyone realized that there was this problem with cholera
00:04:26,00:04:32,"and everyone just fled the city had 120,000 people at the start of June."
00:04:32,00:04:35,"And by the end of June, there were only 20,000 people left in Baku."
00:04:35,00:04:39,"And so basically, people had fled out of Baku, but it meant that they'd taken"
00:04:39,00:04:43,cholera with them on the trains and the boats to the whole rest of Russia.
00:04:43,00:04:47,And then there was a cholera outbreak for two more years in the whole of Russia.
00:04:47,00:04:52,"And in Baku, they had four doctors who were in charge of all the different"
00:04:52,00:04:54,sanitary sections of the town.
00:04:54,00:05:00,"And they were called Arkhangelsky, Akhundov, Lokheman and Dr. Corona."
00:05:00,00:05:03,He believed that.
00:05:03,00:05:06,"It's Russian for crown, but he was called Dr. Corona."
00:05:06,00:05:07,"Yeah, that's amazing."
00:05:07,00:05:11,How come they spread it because cholera is pretty hard to spread person to person?
00:05:11,00:05:12,It's you've got to be drinking their poo.
00:05:12,00:05:15,"Well, it can be misconception, right?"
00:05:15,00:05:18,"In the olden days and actually handshake, avoiding handshaking"
00:05:18,00:05:21,probably wasn't fully necessary unless someone had just wiped their bum.
00:05:21,00:05:26,It can it can go on clothing and on bedding and stuff like that.
00:05:26,00:05:28,So I think that was one one way it went.
00:05:28,00:05:30,So I actually think that's why the lancet were having a go at them
00:05:30,00:05:34,"because the lancet rather racistly were like, oh, the Russians have terrible"
00:05:34,00:05:37,sanitation and their solution is just not to shake hands.
00:05:37,00:05:40,"They're being absolutely ludicrous as opposed to, you know, like."
00:05:40,00:05:42,But it's it's an interesting one.
00:05:42,00:05:45,"Yeah, because because they do say that it's not really touch that gives you cholera,"
00:05:45,00:05:51,"although actually refugee camps or workers, they are told not to shake hands"
00:05:51,00:05:53,and to have distance if there's a cholera outbreak.
00:05:53,00:05:56,So presumably it's a little bit.
00:05:56,00:05:58,"Yeah, it's feces getting in your mouth."
00:05:58,00:06:02,"And if you have feces on your hands, then, you know, if you got two hands,"
00:06:02,00:06:04,you could have traces.
00:06:04,00:06:05,"I mean, it's easy to get traces, isn't it?"
00:06:05,00:06:09,"Yeah, well, I think it's just it's only just the point that people often thought"
00:06:09,00:06:12,that it was really bad to be around people who had cholera in the olden days.
00:06:12,00:06:14,And people would try and keep them in a different room.
00:06:14,00:06:17,"But actually, largely, it's just from drinking infected water."
00:06:17,00:06:20,And it's so horrible when you read these tales of people being so terrified
00:06:20,00:06:23,"and fleeing, it's so easy to treat."
00:06:23,00:06:26,"It must be the easiest disease on earth to treat, right?"
00:06:26,00:06:27,You die of dehydration.
00:06:27,00:06:29,You can die within two hours of getting it.
00:06:29,00:06:33,"But if you just drink and if you drink rehydration salts,"
00:06:33,00:06:37,"if you're super dehydrated or if you just neck water constantly, you're basically fine."
00:06:37,00:06:41,"OK, so we're saying that it is water, but and there might be traces."
00:06:41,00:06:44,But do you guys know that only 90 percent of people globally
00:06:44,00:06:46,actually wash their hands after a number two?
00:06:46,00:06:49,Do they? Only 19 percent.
00:06:49,00:06:51,I suppose you can take out all the men.
00:06:51,00:06:56,"So it's, you know, 19 percent of the 50 percent of the women, you know,"
00:06:56,00:06:59,everyone knows that no men wash their hands after they go to the toilet.
00:06:59,00:07:00,So what is that thing?
00:07:00,00:07:04,"Yeah, I heard that they actually did a study of what's it called?"
00:07:04,00:07:08,"Thingy stations, service stations, the men's toilets."
00:07:08,00:07:11,And it was not. It was not a good site.
00:07:11,00:07:15,"OK, well, that's that's a that's a whole different world,"
00:07:15,00:07:17,the men's toilets in a service.
00:07:17,00:07:18,"No, not in that way, Dan."
00:07:18,00:07:20,"I mean, just in terms of washing your hands afterwards."
00:07:20,00:07:22,"Well, no, you don't want to touch anything."
00:07:22,00:07:27,"Even the even the washing of the hands, you know, pressing the tap down."
00:07:27,00:07:29,I feel like I'm going to get a disease in a place like that.
00:07:29,00:07:33,"So that's that's a place where you touch nothing, except yourself and then go out."
00:07:33,00:07:35,I don't mean that.
00:07:35,00:07:37,That is that does happen a lot for the stations.
00:07:37,00:07:39,"Yeah, that's right."
00:07:39,00:07:42,"But you do wash your hands, though, Dan, right?"
00:07:42,00:07:43,Not in service stations.
00:07:43,00:07:45,I'll happily admit that I don't touch anything.
00:07:45,00:07:48,I do think men's toilets are worse because they get cleaned less often.
00:07:48,00:07:50,I think that's the thing. Or perhaps this is just a thing that.
00:07:50,00:07:52,"No, I think they're just not very clean."
00:07:52,00:07:54,You are. You think they're just not clean.
00:07:54,00:07:57,"Like, do you think any woman would just admit to what Dan just admitted to?"
00:07:58,00:08:01,I think the problem is not admitting to it is really what we're saying here.
00:08:01,00:08:03,We're just liars.
00:08:03,00:08:07,"Just on the handshakes, one more thing in in Russia."
00:08:07,00:08:08,This carried on for a while.
00:08:08,00:08:13,"And in 1918 in St. Petersburg, there was a quite a common slogan"
00:08:13,00:08:17,called down with the handshake and you could again buy little badges
00:08:17,00:08:21,which had down with the handshake on because people thought the handshaking was bad.
00:08:21,00:08:25,"And there was a union of simplifying greetings in the 1920s,"
00:08:26,00:08:29,"which not only banned handshakes, it also banned hugs and kisses."
00:08:29,00:08:33,And Bulgarkov writes about it in one of his early stories called Devildom.
00:08:33,00:08:36,My problem with all of this is whenever we kind of talk about the handshake
00:08:36,00:08:40,"you know, just how gross it is, how many people weren't shaking hands, etc."
00:08:40,00:08:43,"etc. at various times, because of things."
00:08:43,00:08:47,"I always just think once upon a time on our planet, there were penis handshakes"
00:08:47,00:08:49,and we're mortified.
00:08:49,00:08:51,Dan still does that in the welcome break every weekend.
00:08:51,00:08:55,What is a penis handshake?
00:08:55,00:08:59,Does that two penis is shaking or one out of the two penis are?
00:08:59,00:09:02,"No, it's one hand shakes the penis."
00:09:02,00:09:04,And this was this was by one one tribe in Australia.
00:09:04,00:09:08,"And, you know, it's only recently extinct."
00:09:08,00:09:10,I think it became extinct in the 1950s.
00:09:10,00:09:15,"So what it is is one village, one group of people from one village comes to another group."
00:09:15,00:09:20,"The visitors, they offer their their penises"
00:09:20,00:09:25,"to the to the people who are home, you know, who are at home, basically."
00:09:25,00:09:27,It's like bringing a bottle of wine to exactly.
00:09:27,00:09:31,"Exactly. If the men at home, if one of them refuses to to shake it,"
00:09:31,00:09:33,that's akin to a declaration of war.
00:09:33,00:09:36,So then the panicked visitor offers it to all the other guys
00:09:36,00:09:38,in the hopes that one of them shakes it.
00:09:38,00:09:41,"Because if one of them shakes it, it's basically we vouch for you, mate."
00:09:41,00:09:43,He's probably all right. Fascinating.
00:09:43,00:09:47,"Absolutely amazing. God, how long did this last for?"
00:09:47,00:09:49,"You said it ended in what, the 50s?"
00:09:49,00:09:53,"Yeah. So the last reference, so the reference we have of it,"
00:09:53,00:09:57,kind of a really detailed anthropological study was in the 1950s.
00:09:57,00:09:59,And then we don't really know anything after that.
00:09:59,00:10:03,"And it's just really hard to know what really went down, if that makes sense."
00:10:03,00:10:06,"But also because I've got to be honest, as an anthropologist,"
00:10:06,00:10:08,sometimes I feel like anthropologists turn up somewhere
00:10:08,00:10:10,and tribes just do whatever they want.
00:10:10,00:10:14,There's always a bit of me that's like.
00:10:14,00:10:16,"So you think this tribe is like, yeah, we do this every day, mate."
00:10:16,00:10:20,"Yeah, of course, behind the corner, they're just giggling to themselves,"
00:10:20,00:10:23,"go ahead and swallow that, not literally swallow it."
00:10:23,00:10:28,"I found it really fascinating reading about handshakes,"
00:10:28,00:10:30,both historical and modern ones.
00:10:30,00:10:32,"And some of my favourite ones that I've discovered,"
00:10:32,00:10:37,"probably my favourite, whenever Prince Charles used to participate"
00:10:37,00:10:40,"in a tree planting ceremony, he'd always give one of the branches"
00:10:40,00:10:42,a handshake and wish it well before leaving.
00:10:42,00:10:44,Wow.
00:10:44,00:10:49,"Was that the penis handshake or your standard just hand on twig, right?"
00:10:49,00:10:51,Just hand on twig.
00:10:51,00:10:52,"Oh, God, yeah."
00:10:52,00:10:57,Charles mob out just waiting for the wind to brush a branch against it.
00:10:57,00:11:05,"If he doesn't accept, he goes to the other trees, please, one of you."
00:11:05,00:11:08,"What I found really interesting about this fact, what I liked about it,"
00:11:08,00:11:12,the initial fact is just the idea that we've been doing some of the same stuff
00:11:12,00:11:15,"for so long, you know, we say there's a disease spreading, don't handshake today."
00:11:15,00:11:17,The same back then.
00:11:17,00:11:21,And I hadn't quite realised how widespread that advice was around pandemic time.
00:11:21,00:11:25,"So there was like, it went out of fashion basically always"
00:11:25,00:11:28,"when there was an illness around, didn't it, in the early 20th century."
00:11:28,00:11:31,"You're right, you keep seeing it time and time again."
00:11:31,00:11:34,"So Prescott, Arizona actually banned the handshake during the Spanish flu."
00:11:34,00:11:35,They just made it illegal.
00:11:35,00:11:38,And you do see stuff like that during different pandemics and epidemics.
00:11:38,00:11:41,People either shun it or they actually completely ban it.
00:11:41,00:11:44,"So it's not the first time at all, you know."
00:11:44,00:11:49,"They had handshake police sort of going down the street, throwing people apart."
00:11:49,00:11:50,I suppose they must have.
00:11:50,00:11:51,I'd love to have that.
00:11:51,00:11:53,Not really sure how they would have policed it.
00:11:53,00:11:54,I guess it's like everything.
00:11:54,00:11:56,How on earth do you police any of this stuff?
00:11:56,00:12:00,"I guess you would just grass on your neighbours doing the handshakes, wouldn't you?"
00:12:00,00:12:02,That's what usually happens.
00:12:02,00:12:05,"Yeah, it's probably like today, you can't police."
00:12:05,00:12:07,And it's like diversion.
00:12:07,00:12:10,"But like I was, I was in like Yemeni is a very, very, I'm Yemeni originally."
00:12:10,00:12:13,Yemeni is very famous for polygamy.
00:12:13,00:12:16,Like it's a really big thing to men tend to have loads of wives.
00:12:16,00:12:17,I was in a cab.
00:12:17,00:12:21,"There's a Yemeni taxi driver and I was like, how's your dad handling lockdown?"
00:12:21,00:12:22,"He was like, oh, he's been a bit naughty."
00:12:22,00:12:24,He went out and visited his second wife.
00:12:24,00:12:29,"I was like, first of all, that's so typically Yemeni."
00:12:29,00:12:31,"Secondly, how do you police that?"
00:12:31,00:12:33,Like I'm going to go see my second wife.
00:12:33,00:12:35,But how are the police going to get involved with any of this stuff?
00:12:35,00:12:38,"Yeah, that's just an extended bubble, isn't it?"
00:12:41,00:12:44,"Ella, there's a thing that you say in the book, which I found quite surprising."
00:12:44,00:12:50,"I think when you read facts about handshakes, a lot of a sort of very classic"
00:12:50,00:12:53,"fact that's out there, which turns out to be wrong, is that the handshake was sort"
00:12:53,00:12:56,of that came about during medieval times to show you didn't have a weapon in your
00:12:56,00:13:00,hand and that you were presenting an open palm to show you.
00:13:00,00:13:03,"But that turns out that's according to your book, completely wrong, right?"
00:13:03,00:13:07,"Yes, yes, my research very much is against this."
00:13:07,00:13:11,But I love that I've now become the authority on the handshake in this country.
00:13:11,00:13:14,"Like, I just don't know how this happened, but I'm completely loving it"
00:13:14,00:13:15,with all the random things.
00:13:15,00:13:17,"But yeah, I think the sport was open."
00:13:17,00:13:19,There wasn't an established handshake authority.
00:13:19,00:13:21,"All right, all right, all right."
00:13:21,00:13:26,"No, but yeah, so I kind of looked into it and it just never made any sense."
00:13:26,00:13:29,And my argument is that the handshake is biological.
00:13:29,00:13:33,And I've got two arguments for this to support it rather.
00:13:33,00:13:36,"One is the chimps shake hands, so chimps and bonobos shake hands."
00:13:37,00:13:41,Dr. Kat Hobaiter showed that the chip handshake actually has a very similar
00:13:41,00:13:45,"meaning to our own. So she's got, like, for example, videos of two chimps"
00:13:45,00:13:47,kind of really going at each other in a fight and then kind of sheepishly
00:13:47,00:13:51,"walking up to each other and shaking hands to make up, which is adorable."
00:13:51,00:13:55,"So if you think about it, our closest living relatives of the chimps and bonobos,"
00:13:55,00:13:58,"it kind of makes sense that, you know, that's by descent."
00:13:58,00:14:00,So I'm arguing that the handshake is seven million years old.
00:14:00,00:14:06,But the coolest bit that kind of supports this is that we actually transfer
00:14:06,00:14:09,"chemo signals, chemical signals via handshakes."
00:14:09,00:14:12,And there's data to show that we actually sniff our hands afterwards.
00:14:12,00:14:17,"And I know that sounds absolutely mad, but chemo signals are something"
00:14:17,00:14:19,a lot of us don't really realise are actually going on.
00:14:19,00:14:23,"So I think we accept that, you know, the animals in the animal kingdom"
00:14:23,00:14:25,communicate with each other chemically.
00:14:25,00:14:27,But we like to think that our communications are via like sonnets
00:14:27,00:14:30,"and, you know, language and what have you."
00:14:30,00:14:33,But it's it's absolutely bull because we do communicate with each other chemically.
00:14:34,00:14:37,So they did these crazy experiments where they got gauze.
00:14:37,00:14:39,They put it under people's armpits.
00:14:39,00:14:42,"They got them to watch, you know, stressful films or happy films."
00:14:42,00:14:45,And then they took that gauze to a different group of participants
00:14:45,00:14:51,and they go point to the bottle that has gauze in it that is like smells like happiness.
00:14:51,00:14:55,"And they were getting it right more than you'd expect by chance, which."
00:14:55,00:14:58,"So when we shake hands, you're saying, we're trying to tell someone I'm really happy"
00:14:58,00:15:02,or I'm freaking out and we're hoping that you smell your hands afterwards.
00:15:02,00:15:04,"And you go, oh, God, are you OK?"
00:15:04,00:15:07,"Yeah, there's one institute, the Wiseman Institute,"
00:15:07,00:15:10,actually put hidden cameras on people and they showed that people were more
00:15:10,00:15:14,likely to put their hand to their nose and take a sniff after they shake hands
00:15:14,00:15:16,than if they agree in a different way.
00:15:16,00:15:19,"So it's it's we're just animals, basically."
00:15:19,00:15:22,"Whenever I close a Zoom call, I always sniff my computer afterwards."
00:15:22,00:15:26,That's why I'm just in case I can gain some information.
00:15:26,00:15:32,Anything is your computer sad?
00:15:33,00:15:35,I've had color quite badly this whole time.
00:15:35,00:15:39,Right. So we do know it's covered in your own faces.
00:15:39,00:15:43,I think most people could have worked that out anyway.
00:15:43,00:15:52,"OK, it is time for fact number two."
00:15:52,00:15:54,And that is my fact.
00:15:54,00:15:58,My fact this week is the 2013 recipient of the Amelia Earhart
00:15:58,00:16:03,"pioneering achievement award, who later successfully completed Amelia Earhart's"
00:16:03,00:16:07,fatal circumnavigation of the world is called Amelia Earhart.
00:16:07,00:16:11,What? Did she change her name for it?
00:16:11,00:16:13,She did. She did not change her name.
00:16:13,00:16:15,She was born Amelia Rose Earhart.
00:16:15,00:16:19,She was named that by her parents because they wanted to inspire her by
00:16:19,00:16:24,pairing her up as a namesake to one of the great aviators of all time.
00:16:24,00:16:29,And I don't believe that there's any kind of aviation history in her family.
00:16:29,00:16:34,She tried to find out if she was actually descended from Amelia Earhart
00:16:34,00:16:38,"in any way, if she was a relative, because they lived fairly close to each other."
00:16:38,00:16:41,And it turns out there's nothing that connects them.
00:16:41,00:16:44,She hired a genealogist who looked into it and said that she was connected
00:16:44,00:16:46,as far back as the 1700s.
00:16:46,00:16:50,And then she found a sort of second advanced team who said there's absolutely
00:16:50,00:16:53,no traceable connection. So. So weird.
00:16:53,00:16:58,"Yeah, my brother is having a kids and we're like, names aren't important."
00:16:58,00:17:02,"And now I'm like, no, names are definitely, definitely important."
00:17:02,00:17:03,"Like, that is so random."
00:17:03,00:17:07,I think if you want someone to win a prize and you actually give them
00:17:07,00:17:10,"the name of that prize, like if your brother decides to call his"
00:17:10,00:17:15,"child the Nobel Prize for Chemistry or something, and he might have a chance."
00:17:15,00:17:18,"I mean, he won't have a chance in school."
00:17:22,00:17:25,"But, you know, having friends, it just detracts from all that time"
00:17:25,00:17:27,"you could spend doing chemistry, doesn't it? That's the thing."
00:17:27,00:17:28,Yeah.
00:17:28,00:17:31,Hold on. So she was the first.
00:17:31,00:17:33,She couldn't have been the first person to to then redo it.
00:17:33,00:17:36,"No, no, she wasn't the first person to redo it."
00:17:36,00:17:40,"She she's she's the second youngest ever to do it, though,"
00:17:40,00:17:42,which is a pretty amazing feat in itself.
00:17:42,00:17:47,"No, it was done solo by another person a few years beforehand."
00:17:47,00:17:51,The media reported that she had done it because I think it felt like a better story.
00:17:51,00:17:54,"Yeah, yeah, I did it."
00:17:54,00:17:58,"And sorry, when you say because I couldn't help noticing that in your wording,"
00:17:58,00:18:01,you said she successfully completed Amelia Earhart's fatal circumnavigation.
00:18:01,00:18:04,"So she didn't complete the fatal bit, right?"
00:18:04,00:18:07,She decided to remain alive throughout.
00:18:07,00:18:08,Is that correct? Yes.
00:18:08,00:18:10,She's cool. It was it was a cheat.
00:18:10,00:18:12,"I'll be really sticking to the cause, wouldn't it?"
00:18:12,00:18:18,"To think, well, I've really got to follow her into what states and disappear as well."
00:18:18,00:18:21,"Yeah, especially not knowing where she disappeared."
00:18:21,00:18:23,"Like, that's quite quite a feat."
00:18:23,00:18:26,"Well, the thing is, though, we so we don't know the exact spot"
00:18:26,00:18:29,"where Amelia Earhart disappeared, but we know roughly the area."
00:18:29,00:18:32,It's Howland Island is the general area.
00:18:32,00:18:34,This is a place that is in the Pacific Ocean.
00:18:34,00:18:36,It's halfway between Hawaii and Australia.
00:18:36,00:18:41,There were ships in the immediate area that were on radio contact with Amelia Earhart
00:18:41,00:18:43,trying to help guide her there.
00:18:43,00:18:45,So it was her. It was her co-pilot.
00:18:45,00:18:48,It really doesn't feature much in this story.
00:18:48,00:18:50,"You know, I know, right?"
00:18:50,00:18:53,Don't don't die next to someone famous.
00:18:53,00:18:54,"You know, don't blame yourself."
00:18:54,00:18:57,Famous. This really is the great example of that.
00:18:57,00:19:00,Because most people didn't even know there was another dude there.
00:19:00,00:19:01,I don't think it was her.
00:19:01,00:19:03,I always thought she tried it alone.
00:19:03,00:19:06,"And I I couldn't believe I found myself researching this and thinking,"
00:19:06,00:19:10,we've really got to rejuvenate the reputation of the man in this story.
00:19:10,00:19:13,Way too much cuteness for it.
00:19:13,00:19:15,Fred Noonan. And he was a navigator.
00:19:15,00:19:19,He was brought on to be able to navigate using the stars and help them find
00:19:20,00:19:22,where she was going. She was going to do a lot of it solo.
00:19:22,00:19:25,But I think he was so good at what he did that he sort of hitched the ride
00:19:25,00:19:28,for much more of it than he was meant to.
00:19:28,00:19:30,And he's a guy who was known for surviving stuff.
00:19:30,00:19:34,He used to be a he used to work on ammunition ships during wars.
00:19:34,00:19:38,And his he was on three separate vessels that were all sunk by U-boats.
00:19:38,00:19:39,And he survived.
00:19:39,00:19:42,"So, you know, this is a guy with a good survival rate."
00:19:42,00:19:45,"I would think of that as a bad omen, because that certainly implies that my"
00:19:45,00:19:48,plane is going to go down and crash and I'm going to die.
00:19:48,00:19:49,But he'll walk away.
00:19:49,00:19:53,He's got this is like I went through a five year period.
00:19:53,00:19:57,"Every time I turn up on an expedition somewhere that was coming out of war,"
00:19:57,00:19:58,suddenly would go straight back into war.
00:19:58,00:20:02,"The minute I would turn up and it was like my brother was like,"
00:20:02,00:20:03,do you think you're cursed?
00:20:03,00:20:05,"I was like, maybe."
00:20:05,00:20:07,Is it true that Amelia Earhart got ripped apart by crabs?
00:20:07,00:20:09,That's why I always read at the end.
00:20:09,00:20:12,"Well, this is one of the latest theories."
00:20:12,00:20:17,"So, so Howland Island is the island that she was meant to be landing on."
00:20:17,00:20:19,"There's another island next to it, which is Gardner Island."
00:20:19,00:20:25,"And it's thought that that is where she turned and landed on a reef, survived."
00:20:25,00:20:30,"And then was eventually killed by giant crabs, which ate her, carried her"
00:20:30,00:20:35,bones to the the holes that they dig and left her down there.
00:20:35,00:20:37,So that is a theory.
00:20:37,00:20:40,"And one of the last expeditions, which I believe happened in about"
00:20:40,00:20:46,"2017, 2018, they had bone sniffing dogs to try and find her."
00:20:46,00:20:49,And bone sniffing dogs can smell quite far down.
00:20:49,00:20:52,And so the hope was is that they were going to find her.
00:20:52,00:20:55,"And I think they found some bones, but I don't don't think it was hers."
00:20:55,00:20:58,"That is a dog's dream job, isn't it?"
00:20:58,00:21:00,I'm going to I'm going to literally employ you to find bones.
00:21:00,00:21:02,"Yeah, that is amazing."
00:21:02,00:21:05,"The only better job is chasing post-med, isn't it?"
00:21:05,00:21:07,Yeah.
00:21:07,00:21:10,"Yeah, I think they did an experiment where they tested"
00:21:10,00:21:13,how well she could have been consumed by these crabs.
00:21:13,00:21:17,"And it was coconut hermit crabs, which we must have mentioned before."
00:21:17,00:21:19,And they are giant crabs in the largest land crab.
00:21:19,00:21:21,They're like three feet wide.
00:21:21,00:21:23,They can kill birds and climb trees and stuff.
00:21:23,00:21:27,And their claws produce double the force of a tiger's bite
00:21:27,00:21:29,so they can just crunch through bones.
00:21:29,00:21:33,And I think the scientists took a pig carcass to the beach
00:21:33,00:21:36,where they found these sort of remnants that could be Amelia Earhart.
00:21:36,00:21:38,I think they found like lipstick remnants and stuff.
00:21:38,00:21:40,So they thought she'd been there.
00:21:40,00:21:42,So they brought a pig carcass to the beach and they left it there.
00:21:42,00:21:44,"And there's a time lapse that I believe you can watch,"
00:21:44,00:21:47,"which shows the crabs just destroying this thing,"
00:21:47,00:21:50,turning it to nothing within a week.
00:21:50,00:21:51,It's really cool.
00:21:51,00:21:53,"But she wasn't killed by them, which should be clear."
00:21:53,00:21:55,Although that would have been an awesome way to go.
00:21:55,00:21:57,"Well, we don't know. We don't know anything."
00:21:57,00:21:57,We don't know.
00:21:57,00:21:59,She might have been murdered by a coconut crab.
00:21:59,00:22:02,"There's so many theories, aren't there?"
00:22:02,00:22:06,They've come out about this over the last 70 odd years
00:22:06,00:22:10,about her disappearance and everything from alien abduction
00:22:10,00:22:13,through to she was captured by Japanese soldiers
00:22:13,00:22:18,"and was broadcasting as Tokyo Rose to, you know, all stuff like that."
00:22:18,00:22:21,It's pretty exciting when you go through the big list.
00:22:21,00:22:26,"Yeah, I know you guys deal with facts, but in terms of feelings,"
00:22:26,00:22:29,"do you think that, you know, if she was in any way kind of aware"
00:22:29,00:22:32,"of what was going on, there's a bit of her that's like, damn, I didn't."
00:22:32,00:22:35,"I didn't succeed, but they're still obsessed with me."
00:22:35,00:22:35,Do you know what I mean?
00:22:35,00:22:38,"Like the world is still like, what happened to Amelia Earhart?"
00:22:39,00:22:41,"Yeah, I hope she's, yeah, she's up there going,"
00:22:41,00:22:43,thank God they've forgotten all about that noon and guy.
00:22:43,00:22:49,She was really pro kind of getting as many women to fly aeroplanes
00:22:49,00:22:51,"as possible, wasn't she?"
00:22:51,00:22:57,"She was the first president of the 99s, which was a group of women who"
00:22:57,00:22:59,"basically were dedicated to ice creams, weren't they?"
00:22:59,00:23:00,That was it. That was all they used to do.
00:23:00,00:23:03,Just eat ice creams all day.
00:23:03,00:23:06,"They had 99 problems, but a flake wasn't one."
00:23:06,00:23:07,God.
00:23:08,00:23:08,God.
00:23:08,00:23:14,"But they really, basically the first licenses you could get in America"
00:23:14,00:23:19,"were in 1927 and within two years were 9,000 men with licenses"
00:23:19,00:23:21,and only 117 women.
00:23:21,00:23:24,And so they started this club to try and encourage more women to fly.
00:23:24,00:23:27,And there were some amazing people who were part of it.
00:23:27,00:23:32,"There was one woman called Opal Kuntz, who was part of the 99s."
00:23:32,00:23:37,"And she was one of the first women to, sorry, what?"
00:23:37,00:23:38,"No, no, no, that's not much over that."
00:23:38,00:23:40,Could you just say the name once more?
00:23:40,00:23:41,Opal Kuntz.
00:23:41,00:23:47,Opal Kuntz was one of the first people to fly against men in races.
00:23:47,00:23:49,And she used to win them as well.
00:23:49,00:23:52,"She used to she was a really, really good racing pilot."
00:23:52,00:23:57,And there was a thing in 1929 where it was the first women's air derby
00:23:57,00:24:01,"where they went all the way across America from Santa Monica to Cleveland, Ohio."
00:24:01,00:24:05,And the newspapers called it the powder puff derby
00:24:05,00:24:08,because it was all women taking part.
00:24:08,00:24:12,There were 40 people who took part and she would have won it.
00:24:12,00:24:16,But they said that her aircraft must have a horsepower appropriate for a woman.
00:24:16,00:24:19,"In other words, her plane was too fast."
00:24:19,00:24:20,They wouldn't let her fly it.
00:24:20,00:24:23,So she had to fly in a slower aeroplane and she came seven.
00:24:23,00:24:27,I want to use her surname to describe them.
00:24:27,00:24:29,"Is that bad? No, it's quite right."
00:24:29,00:24:32,And then the other thing about the 99s
00:24:32,00:24:35,is Amelia Earhart had a thing called the Hat of the Month Programme.
00:24:35,00:24:40,And she would give it to whichever member of the club flew to the most airports
00:24:40,00:24:43,wearing a Stetson hat that she designed herself.
00:24:43,00:24:48,That is so weird because she initially preferred hats to planes.
00:24:48,00:24:51,"What's her origin story, Amelia Earhart?"
00:24:51,00:24:53,It's really great. She wrote a diary that's quite detailed.
00:24:53,00:24:55,So we know lots about what she thought.
00:24:55,00:25:00,And she saw her very first airplane when she was 10 at the Iowa State Fair.
00:25:00,00:25:02,And there were planes there.
00:25:02,00:25:03,And so she was 10 years old.
00:25:03,00:25:06,"She saw this plane and was like, I wasn't interested at all."
00:25:06,00:25:08,It was just a bunch of kind of wood and wire.
00:25:08,00:25:11,"And someone said, look, dear, it flies."
00:25:11,00:25:15,"And she said, I was much more interested in an absurd hat made"
00:25:15,00:25:17,from an inverted peach basket that I just bought.
00:25:17,00:25:20,And so that's that was her first love.
00:25:20,00:25:22,So maybe she was all about the hats.
00:25:22,00:25:25,The whole plane thing was so that she could get this Stetson hat competition.
00:25:25,00:25:28,"Right, she had her own fashion label, didn't she? I think."
00:25:29,00:25:32,"Back then, it was really hard to fund all of these projects."
00:25:32,00:25:35,And she wrote some books and she used to go on lecture tours.
00:25:35,00:25:38,But one of the other things she did was become one of the first
00:25:38,00:25:41,"for the modern era, celebrity fashion designers."
00:25:41,00:25:44,"And she had her own line, this Amelia Earhart fashion line,"
00:25:44,00:25:47,where she would incorporate bits of airplane onto the clothing as well.
00:25:47,00:25:52,"So she would have wing bolts and she would have, you know, sort of little."
00:25:52,00:25:57,"You know, that hat that people wear with a like a rotor on the top of it."
00:25:57,00:25:58,She had that.
00:25:59,00:26:01,"Oh, God, I wish she did."
00:26:01,00:26:02,"No, I don't think so."
00:26:02,00:26:05,"I'm going to speak to my expedition buddies,"
00:26:05,00:26:08,because right now we're trying to approach like Dell to give us like funding.
00:26:08,00:26:14,"And I'm like, no, no, guys, let's just go design a fashion line to fund our expeditions."
00:26:14,00:26:18,"It kind of pioneered fashion a bit as well, didn't it?"
00:26:18,00:26:25,Because up until then women were wearing one piece suits or dress
00:26:25,00:26:27,or it was always one thing.
00:26:27,00:26:31,"And she, with this fashion line, created the idea or at least popularized it"
00:26:31,00:26:35,"quite nicely, separates the idea of matching this with this skirt,"
00:26:35,00:26:39,"with this jacket, with this shirt, you know, you buy in different pieces."
00:26:39,00:26:41,And that really wasn't a thing back then.
00:26:41,00:26:44,And she kind of pushed it to be as part of her line.
00:26:44,00:26:45,Wow.
00:26:45,00:26:47,"Ella, what was the name of that company"
00:26:47,00:26:50,that you want to give you some money for your next exhibition?
00:26:50,00:26:52,"Was it Dell, the makers of amazing computers"
00:26:52,00:26:55,that everyone should go and buy computers from?
00:26:55,00:26:57,"Dell, but I'll take IBM."
00:26:57,00:26:59,I'll take anyone.
00:26:59,00:27:00,I will take anyone.
00:27:00,00:27:05,"And then I will, I can't stop actually, because she didn't need to fund it."
00:27:05,00:27:08,I will take anyone.
00:27:08,00:27:10,"Yeah, Dell already to sign off on that, you know,"
00:27:10,00:27:14,until you pinch yourself out to all of their competitors.
00:27:14,00:27:18,"Oops, oh well."
00:27:18,00:27:21,"Do you know, she did have one successful fundraising thing,"
00:27:21,00:27:23,which is what did fund her trips.
00:27:23,00:27:25,And that was carrying letters.
00:27:25,00:27:28,So she wasn't a carrier pigeon.
00:27:28,00:27:30,"She was, she was a postman."
00:27:30,00:27:33,"OK, this is this is actually her career."
00:27:33,00:27:38,"No, she was, um, she had this idea of basically crowdfunding"
00:27:38,00:27:41,by saying that she would take letters that people had written
00:27:41,00:27:44,"with commemorative stamps that said, like,"
00:27:44,00:27:46,"I went all the way around the world with Amelia Earhart,"
00:27:46,00:27:48,or I went over the Atlantic with Amelia Earhart.
00:27:48,00:27:52,"So I think across the Atlantic, she had 100 or so commemorative stamps"
00:27:52,00:27:54,"and she'd sign them and on her round the world trip, that plane."
00:27:54,00:27:58,"And when we find it, we'll have 5,000 stamped letters in."
00:27:58,00:28:03,And she said that she's such a hassle on every stop along the way.
00:28:03,00:28:06,She had to postmark every single one of those letters.
00:28:06,00:28:11,"With a sack, 5,000 letters down to the local post office"
00:28:11,00:28:12,"in wherever, Hawaii."
00:28:12,00:28:15,"I wonder if I wonder if they told the bone-snipping dogs,"
00:28:15,00:28:17,"you know, she used to be a postwoman, just to give them"
00:28:17,00:28:20,that extra bit of incentive.
00:28:24,00:28:28,You know what? This makes me feel better that even Amelia Earhart
00:28:28,00:28:30,struggled with financing her expeditions.
00:28:30,00:28:32,"This is just, this is information I needed, Anna."
00:28:32,00:28:34,"Bless you, thank you."
00:28:34,00:28:37,That's offered to deliver mail as part of them.
00:28:37,00:28:39,Where are you next going? I'm sure there are people who have letters.
00:28:39,00:28:40,Somaliland?
00:28:40,00:28:42,Perfect.
00:28:42,00:28:45,"I, if anyone's got a friend in Somaliland, you need to write a letter."
00:28:45,00:28:47,LSU Women.
00:28:47,00:28:49,She charges a grand letter.
00:28:49,00:28:51,Thank you.
00:28:51,00:28:56,So Amelia Earhart was the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic.
00:28:56,00:29:01,But she was actually the first woman to cross the Atlantic in a plane
00:29:01,00:29:04,where she wasn't a solo flyer.
00:29:04,00:29:08,And that was when she was a guest in the plane of Wilma Stoltz
00:29:08,00:29:11,and a guy called Slim Gordon.
00:29:11,00:29:15,And she spent the flight crouched in between the fuel tanks of the plane.
00:29:15,00:29:17,So she went as a passenger over.
00:29:17,00:29:21,But she said that she was no more useful than a sack of potatoes.
00:29:22,00:29:23,When you eat potatoes.
00:29:23,00:29:25,"Yes, they are useful."
00:29:25,00:29:27,She was less useful.
00:29:27,00:29:29,"You can make them into loads of different things, potatoes."
00:29:29,00:29:32,"They're probably one of the most useful of all the vegetables, aren't they?"
00:29:32,00:29:35,"They're more edible than Amelia Earhart, unless you're a coconut crowd."
00:29:35,00:29:38,"Yeah, they're less good at flying a plane."
00:29:38,00:29:40,Are they in emergency situations?
00:29:40,00:29:41,They are. That's true.
00:29:41,00:29:43,"You wouldn't call on, you might call on Mr."
00:29:43,00:29:46,"Potato Head if you're really desperate, but he's probably the only potato you want."
00:29:48,00:29:52,"But yeah, that was actually what launched her flying career."
00:29:52,00:29:54,"Guesting or no, it wasn't what launched it, sorry."
00:29:54,00:29:58,"But that really propelled her to stratospheric heights, as it were, career wise,"
00:29:58,00:30:02,"because she was put up to it by another woman called Amy Phipps Guest,"
00:30:02,00:30:05,who was actually this millionaire.
00:30:05,00:30:07,"And this woman, Amy Phipps, wanted to make the crossing."
00:30:07,00:30:11,"She was like, women can do just as much as men can do."
00:30:11,00:30:12,I want to cross the Atlantic with these two chaps.
00:30:12,00:30:14,And her family just begged her not to go.
00:30:14,00:30:17,"Like, we love you too much. You too, Rich. Come on, stay."
00:30:17,00:30:20,"So she said, OK, well, find me a suitable woman."
00:30:20,00:30:25,And she hired a guy called George Putnam to find a woman who she wanted to be
00:30:25,00:30:29,"adventurous, but actually in Amelia's diary, by the time they tracked her down,"
00:30:29,00:30:34,"they were looking for someone with social graces, education, charm and pulchritude."
00:30:34,00:30:38,So the men had obviously slightly changed the advert on the way.
00:30:38,00:30:39,G-S-O-H.
00:30:39,00:30:42,"Yes, yeah."
00:30:42,00:30:45,But George Putnam found her and ended up marrying her
00:30:45,00:30:47,as well as getting her on the flight.
00:30:47,00:30:49,And when do we ever hear about George Putnam?
00:30:49,00:30:53,Exactly. More airtime for George.
00:30:53,00:30:57,So she had a wealthy benefactor to start off with.
00:30:57,00:31:00,She did.
00:31:00,00:31:03,This podcast is quickly becoming a how to fund my next expedition.
00:31:03,00:31:09,I'm the rich woman. I hear Mrs. Melinda Gates.
00:31:09,00:31:15,I don't know what the people at Dalla are going to think about that.
00:31:16,00:31:18,I'll take any of them.
00:31:18,00:31:28,"OK, it is time for fact number three, and that is Anna."
00:31:28,00:31:32,My fact this week is that scientists have started putting fossilised
00:31:32,00:31:34,poos in particle accelerators.
00:31:34,00:31:38,Why are they like that?
00:31:38,00:31:40,"Well, A, it's fun."
00:31:40,00:31:43,"And B, you can learn loads about the poo."
00:31:44,00:31:46,And so these are...
00:31:46,00:31:49,"So a particle accelerator, you get like an electron"
00:31:49,00:31:52,and you fire it round a great big tunnel and they smash into each other.
00:31:52,00:31:55,Are they firing poos around this tunnel and smashing into each other?
00:31:55,00:31:59,The poos are not taking the place of the electrons.
00:31:59,00:32:02,"No, although that would be such an awesome way to find the God Particle."
00:32:02,00:32:05,"No, it would be gross."
00:32:05,00:32:10,You don't want to be the cleaner in the lab that day.
00:32:10,00:32:13,"Oh, guys."
00:32:13,00:32:16,It's not messy. Don't panic. Is it like a little test tube?
00:32:16,00:32:19,So this is this really amazing new way that they found of studying
00:32:19,00:32:23,coprolites. So coprolites are fossilised feces and you can learn a lot about
00:32:23,00:32:26,"the thing that pooed out millions and millions of years ago, because, you know,"
00:32:26,00:32:30,it's preserved the stuff that they were eating inside it.
00:32:30,00:32:34,And we said years ago on this podcast that the only way to study a coprolite
00:32:34,00:32:37,"is to cut it in half, which cut it into slices."
00:32:37,00:32:40,"Now, not true anymore, because you can put it in these very specific"
00:32:40,00:32:43,particle accelerators called synchrotrons.
00:32:43,00:32:47,And so there's one called the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility.
00:32:47,00:32:52,And basically you put the poo in there and the electrons
00:32:52,00:32:54,"are being fired round and round, around super, super fast."
00:32:54,00:32:58,"And if you just slightly change the electrons' direction along the way,"
00:32:58,00:33:01,"they let out x-rays, but incredibly powerful x-rays."
00:33:01,00:33:06,So the x-rays are 100 billion times brighter than the ones that you'd use in a hospital.
00:33:06,00:33:09,So they see straight into the coprolite.
00:33:09,00:33:11,Or they have lots of other purposes as well.
00:33:11,00:33:13,The coprolite is one thing they do.
00:33:13,00:33:16,"It does feel cheaper, though, just to cut it in half with a knife, doesn't it?"
00:33:16,00:33:19,"Yeah, if you don't have the budget."
00:33:19,00:33:22,"But also, then you've destroyed your coprolite."
00:33:22,00:33:24,"Then you've got two half-coprolites, don't you?"
00:33:24,00:33:27,This way you can keep the integrity of it.
00:33:27,00:33:28,"That's true, yeah."
00:33:28,00:33:31,"Although, as you just sort of trod on your own point, James,"
00:33:31,00:33:33,"because then you do have two coprolites, which does seem like it's"
00:33:33,00:33:36,"twice as good as having one, doesn't it, in some ways."
00:33:37,00:33:39,"That's true. I've got a pizza to sell you,"
00:33:39,00:33:41,"which is eight slices, opposed to six slices."
00:33:41,00:33:43,Damn it.
00:33:43,00:33:46,"But one person we haven't mentioned is Mary Anning,"
00:33:46,00:33:50,who was one of the first people to work out what a coprolite was.
00:33:50,00:33:55,So she is these days a famous fossil collector
00:33:55,00:33:58,from the south of England.
00:33:58,00:34:02,Some people think that it's where we get she sells seashells on the seashore.
00:34:02,00:34:05,"It was supposedly named after her, whether it was, we don't know."
00:34:06,00:34:09,"But when you say these days, you mean she's famous these days,"
00:34:09,00:34:11,not that she's a fossil collector these days.
00:34:11,00:34:13,She is herself quite close to being a fossil by now.
00:34:13,00:34:15,She is quite dead.
00:34:15,00:34:17,She is quite a dead person.
00:34:17,00:34:19,It's what she would have wanted. It's fine.
00:34:19,00:34:22,"I know, I know."
00:34:22,00:34:25,"She was perhaps not really appreciated in her time,"
00:34:25,00:34:27,"although a little bit more than you would expect,"
00:34:27,00:34:31,"because she works with a guy called William Buckland,"
00:34:31,00:34:34,who was a very famous paleontologist.
00:34:34,00:34:36,"And when he wrote his paper,"
00:34:36,00:34:40,"when he gave his paper to the Geological Society in London in 1829,"
00:34:40,00:34:41,he did recognise her by name.
00:34:41,00:34:45,"So, you know, she was kind of known in her time,"
00:34:45,00:34:48,but she wasn't allowed to be part of the Geological Society
00:34:48,00:34:50,because they didn't allow women in those days.
00:34:50,00:34:54,There was the Director of the Lime Regis Museum called David Tucker.
00:34:54,00:34:57,"He says that if she was born in 1970,"
00:34:57,00:35:01,she'd be heading up the Paleontology Department at Imperial or Cambridge by now.
00:35:01,00:35:04,"But as it was, she was just someone who collected fossils"
00:35:04,00:35:08,"and learned about them and kind of wrote to this guy, William Buckland."
00:35:08,00:35:12,But it was in the correspondence between these two people
00:35:12,00:35:14,"that the word ""coprolite"" first came into use."
00:35:14,00:35:19,And the idea that these rocks with little bits of bone and stuff
00:35:19,00:35:21,might be fossilised poos.
00:35:21,00:35:23,It does feel like Buckland could have done a bit more
00:35:23,00:35:25,"to sort of give her a bit more cred,"
00:35:25,00:35:28,because he did clearly get on with her really well
00:35:28,00:35:32,"and took her seriously, took her ideas seriously as well."
00:35:32,00:35:37,"But when these ideas were being presented to other scientists,"
00:35:37,00:35:41,"they even used her drawings of the dinosaurs that she sketched out,"
00:35:41,00:35:43,"that she found, with no mention of her name."
00:35:43,00:35:46,"That was what was shown, and she got nothing."
00:35:46,00:35:48,It's pretty extraordinary.
00:35:48,00:35:50,"Yeah, what was going through their heads?"
00:35:50,00:35:52,"Did they look at those drawings, you wonder, and think,"
00:35:52,00:35:53,"""Maybe I did draw that."
00:35:53,00:35:56,"Maybe I did find that fossil actually."""
00:35:56,00:35:58,"You know, I don't remember everything I've done."
00:35:58,00:36:01,(LAUGHTER)
00:36:01,00:36:04,Because she sort of invented...
00:36:04,00:36:07,I think this is why she invented the idea of drawing or imaginings
00:36:07,00:36:09,of what these things that we found the fossils of would look like.
00:36:09,00:36:13,So the reason that we now can picture like a T-rex or a Diplodocus or whatever
00:36:13,00:36:16,"is because she came up with, ""Look, we've got to draw these things"
00:36:16,00:36:19,"so people don't understand how they appeared."""
00:36:19,00:36:22,"But there's a really cool thing about the drawings that she did,"
00:36:22,00:36:27,which is that she drew fossils with fossils.
00:36:27,00:36:29,"So she had a friend called Elizabeth Philpot,"
00:36:29,00:36:33,"who was another great fossil collector at the time,"
00:36:33,00:36:36,"and they found this Bellumknight fossil,"
00:36:36,00:36:38,"which I think is an extinct kind of squid,"
00:36:38,00:36:41,and they found that it contained fossilized ink sacs.
00:36:41,00:36:44,"So you have squid ink, squid ink sacs."
00:36:44,00:36:46,"And her friend, Elizabeth Philpot,"
00:36:46,00:36:48,realised that you could grind up and still make ink.
00:36:48,00:36:51,"So Mary Ann Ink then used that process to grind it up,"
00:36:51,00:36:55,"and with this 100 million-year-old squid ink,"
00:36:55,00:36:56,she drew some of her pictures.
00:36:56,00:36:58,That is amazing.
00:36:58,00:36:59,I have questions about this.
00:36:59,00:37:00,How rare are those fossils?
00:37:00,00:37:03,Because I just feel like today I wouldn't get away with that.
00:37:03,00:37:10,Just filling up your lamy pen with some 100 million-year-old fossils.
00:37:10,00:37:11,You're right.
00:37:11,00:37:13,"But aside from that, she was very cool."
00:37:13,00:37:15,"She was very attached to her dog,"
00:37:15,00:37:18,which very sadly died when she was out on a fossil-collecting trip.
00:37:18,00:37:20,And she wrote a sweet letter saying that...
00:37:20,00:37:22,Is she writing the dog's blood?
00:37:24,00:37:25,"Yeah, she was out of fossil-collecting,"
00:37:25,00:37:27,and this cliff collapsed and nearly killed her.
00:37:27,00:37:30,"Basically, this huge cliff fell down inches away from her"
00:37:30,00:37:32,and crushed her little dog.
00:37:32,00:37:33,"Oh, no."
00:37:33,00:37:34,Sad.
00:37:34,00:37:36,Just one last thing on Mary Ann Ink.
00:37:36,00:37:40,I said about David Tucker at the Lime Regis Museum.
00:37:40,00:37:42,"The Lime Regis Museum,"
00:37:42,00:37:45,you can go and learn some stuff about Mary Ann Ink.
00:37:45,00:37:48,And it is in the place where she was born.
00:37:48,00:37:49,That's where the museum is.
00:37:49,00:37:53,But it's a complete coincidence that it's in that same building.
00:37:53,00:37:54,No.
00:37:54,00:37:55,"Yeah, they bought this place,"
00:37:55,00:37:58,and they didn't realise that that was where she was born.
00:37:58,00:38:02,And it turned out that the actual area where the family lived
00:38:02,00:38:03,has since fallen into the sea.
00:38:03,00:38:07,"But it was a bit of the building that was attached to where they lived,"
00:38:07,00:38:09,which is now where the museum is.
00:38:09,00:38:12,Wow. Is that the bit that squashed the dog?
00:38:12,00:38:14,Wouldn't that be a thing if that was true?
00:38:14,00:38:15,"Oh, my goodness."
00:38:15,00:38:17,"It sort of swings around about, you know."
00:38:17,00:38:19,We lost the dog. We've now got a seafront view.
00:38:19,00:38:24,It's so dark.
00:38:24,00:38:29,The oldest human copper light we have in existence is a Neanderthal one
00:38:29,00:38:32,"from 50,000 years ago in a Spanish site."
00:38:32,00:38:36,And what I love most about it is it was on top of a hearth.
00:38:36,00:38:38,So you've got to imagine there was a fire.
00:38:38,00:38:40,"They put the fire out and the guy was like,"
00:38:40,00:38:43,"""Just give me a second. Give me a second, lads."""
00:38:43,00:38:45,"""Just going to do a number two."""
00:38:45,00:38:48,"Probably didn't wash his hands. You might know him, Dan."
00:38:48,00:38:50,And then went about his business.
00:38:50,00:38:53,I was descended.
00:38:53,00:38:56,"But yeah, it's just, it's kind of wonderful."
00:38:56,00:38:58,Wow. Pooing in the fireplace.
00:38:58,00:39:01,No manners than Neanderthals. That's why they died out.
00:39:01,00:39:02,"Well, did we learn about that?"
00:39:02,00:39:04,Do we learn anything about that Neanderthal poo?
00:39:04,00:39:06,Like what they ate and stuff like that?
00:39:06,00:39:10,"Yes. So it turns out they, obviously, they meet."
00:39:10,00:39:13,"That's not surprising, but they did eat veggies,"
00:39:13,00:39:15,which some people still find surprising.
00:39:15,00:39:17,I don't know why. Why would they? Why would that be weird?
00:39:17,00:39:21,But they also found a whole pile of parasites.
00:39:21,00:39:23,"So, Pidworms and a whole pile of other stuff"
00:39:23,00:39:25,"that I think if they'd have found them in a modern human,"
00:39:25,00:39:27,"they would say that person would be very, very sick."
00:39:27,00:39:30,"So either they were really hardy, basically,"
00:39:30,00:39:34,"or the poor guy was really, or woman, was really sick."
00:39:34,00:39:37,"But also, I just, I kind of, I love human poo,"
00:39:37,00:39:39,"like coprolites because, sorry,"
00:39:39,00:39:42,"probably shouldn't say it like that, but it's just that,"
00:39:42,00:39:44,"you know, when people talk about the paleo diet,"
00:39:44,00:39:46,"for me, kind of people that really into the paleo diet,"
00:39:46,00:39:48,there's always a bit of bouginess about it.
00:39:48,00:39:49,"Don't get me wrong, I'm quite bougie as well,"
00:39:49,00:39:51,"but there's an element of like,"
00:39:51,00:39:53,"""Oh, you know, there's this like, blah, blah, blah."""
00:39:53,00:39:55,"And it's actually like, ""Well, the real paleo diet,"
00:39:55,00:39:59,"these guys all had worms and they're all dead by 30, you know."""
00:39:59,00:40:01,And shitting on the fire.
00:40:01,00:40:02,Exactly. Exactly.
00:40:02,00:40:07,"Like, I got a kick out for this one paleo diet restaurant."
00:40:07,00:40:09,"I was trying to explain to the lady in the paleo diet restaurant,"
00:40:09,00:40:12,"as you do as an academic, you know, just completely obnoxious."
00:40:12,00:40:15,"Actually, the real paleo diet wouldn't have been the chicken breast."
00:40:15,00:40:17,It would have been all parts of the chicken.
00:40:17,00:40:19,"So, are you serving chicken eyes?"
00:40:19,00:40:21,And dozens of the animal?
00:40:21,00:40:23,Are you serving the poor girl?
00:40:23,00:40:25,"Oh, no."
00:40:25,00:40:30,"Speaking of technology being used for studying Neanderthals,"
00:40:30,00:40:35,"I was reading this in BBC Future and they said that in 2013,"
00:40:35,00:40:39,they discovered that the genetic code for penis spines
00:40:39,00:40:41,"is lacking from Neanderthals,"
00:40:41,00:40:43,which means that we know in theory
00:40:43,00:40:45,that they didn't have spines on their penises.
00:40:45,00:40:50,And what that apparently shows us is that they were more monogamous
00:40:50,00:40:52,"than we might have thought they were in the past,"
00:40:52,00:40:59,because usually the animals with penis spines are more like people from Yemen.
00:40:59,00:41:00,They tend to have spines.
00:41:00,00:41:03,"Oh, my God."
00:41:03,00:41:05,"So, Dad, you're telling me?"
00:41:05,00:41:10,"At one point, somebody turned around and was like,"
00:41:10,00:41:14,"""Why don't you marry a second wife, Dr. Ashima?"""
00:41:14,00:41:16,"And my dad was like, ""Oh, one's enough for me."""
00:41:16,00:41:21,"My mum's reaction was, ""Ah, no, hold on. That's an insult."""
00:41:21,00:41:26,"I love that they can look at the genomes of these like ancient,"
00:41:26,00:41:29,"like long, long dead species of humans"
00:41:29,00:41:33,"and can tell you something as kind of weird as that,"
00:41:33,00:41:35,how many sexual partners they might have had.
00:41:35,00:41:36,That's extraordinary.
00:41:36,00:41:39,"So, do you mean kind of like a penis bone is what you're talking about?"
00:41:39,00:41:43,"No, so like animals would have spikes on their penises."
00:41:43,00:41:43,A lot of them do.
00:41:43,00:41:45,"Spike. Sorry, I heard spine."
00:41:45,00:41:47,"OK, yeah. Oh, yeah, I did say spine."
00:41:47,00:41:49,"Yeah, it's all spines like spines."
00:41:49,00:41:54,And the spikes were basically clearing out previous gentlemen's stuff
00:41:54,00:41:56,that was in there using these.
00:41:56,00:42:01,"Exactly, and so it's more necessary for a polyamorous species"
00:42:01,00:42:05,"because you're more likely to have stuff to clean out from there, so to speak."
00:42:05,00:42:07,"Oh, interesting."
00:42:07,00:42:09,"So, Neanderthals were all romantics,"
00:42:09,00:42:11,monogamous romantics is what we can do.
00:42:11,00:42:13,"Yeah, let's go with that, the romantics."
00:42:13,00:42:14,And I read another study.
00:42:14,00:42:17,"This is from the University of California, San Diego Laboratory,"
00:42:17,00:42:21,and they made some tiny brains.
00:42:21,00:42:25,"They're not conscious brains, but they're kind of brain cells."
00:42:25,00:42:30,"And using CRISPR, which is like the gene editing thing,"
00:42:30,00:42:35,they made some that were human and some that had Neanderthal genes in them.
00:42:35,00:42:39,And the Neanderthal ones matured much quicker than the human ones did.
00:42:39,00:42:44,And what they inferred from that is that perhaps young
00:42:44,00:42:47,and Neanderthals would be more capable than younger humans.
00:42:47,00:42:50,"But then perhaps the Homo sapiens, as they got older,"
00:42:50,00:42:52,would have gotten better or smarter.
00:42:52,00:42:54,"I don't know if any of this is true, Ella or Emma?"
00:42:54,00:42:58,"No, it's completely, completely true, as I would expect from you, James."
00:42:58,00:43:01,"But no, yeah, they're called organoids."
00:43:01,00:43:05,"That's what they made, these kind of little brain things."
00:43:05,00:43:08,And it's really interesting because it plays into this theory.
00:43:08,00:43:10,"Anna, what you're saying, you know, why did they die out?"
00:43:10,00:43:14,"Well, there's this one theory that suggests that because we,"
00:43:14,00:43:18,"we, as in modern humans, Homo sapiens, have an extended juvenile period."
00:43:18,00:43:21,"Basically, we don't become adults very quickly at all."
00:43:21,00:43:24,"That that's given us a competitive advantage,"
00:43:24,00:43:28,"because it means we play and play is really good for creativity, imagination,"
00:43:28,00:43:30,"invention, blah, blah, blah."
00:43:30,00:43:33,"And obviously, it's absolutely, it's not impossible to prove it."
00:43:33,00:43:35,"But it's, I mean, it is kind of, I guess."
00:43:36,00:43:38,But it's just really interesting to think that the Neanderthals
00:43:38,00:43:43,kind of growing up so quickly might be one of the reasons why they became extinct.
00:43:43,00:43:47,"But you are, you are right as well, when you say that, you know,"
00:43:47,00:43:50,we kind of know a certain amount about Neanderthals from their DNA.
00:43:50,00:43:53,"We know a lot about them from their DNA, including, obviously,"
00:43:53,00:43:56,that all of us have about 2% Neanderthal DNA in us.
00:43:56,00:44:00,"So all a wee bit Neanderthal, which is, you know, I think is really cute,"
00:44:00,00:44:02,because it means they're not completely gone.
00:44:02,00:44:03,They're still with us a little bit.
00:44:03,00:44:07,"Yeah, if you have more, you know how Dan is like a particularly hairy man."
00:44:07,00:44:11,Does that mean that he's more likely to have more Neanderthal in him?
00:44:11,00:44:15,"Or is, does it not kind of, can you not see from the outside"
00:44:15,00:44:17,"how Neanderthal someone is, you have to go into the genes and."
00:44:17,00:44:20,"Yeah, you have to go into the genes, because as hairy as Neanderthals,"
00:44:20,00:44:23,"as hairy as Neanderthal might be, as hairy as Dan might be."
00:44:23,00:44:29,"Sorry, Dan, we actually, we don't actually know that Neanderthals were hairy."
00:44:29,00:44:32,That's kind of just something that got into public imagination.
00:44:32,00:44:36,"But no, there's no real, how do you know what I mean?"
00:44:36,00:44:38,How do you even prove that?
00:44:38,00:44:39,We don't know.
00:44:39,00:44:41,How about the fact that I keep ruining parties
00:44:41,00:44:43,by having a shit on the fireplace?
00:44:43,00:44:48,"You can't blame that on your genes, sadly."
00:44:48,00:44:58,"OK, it is time for fact number four, and that is James."
00:44:58,00:45:02,"OK, my fact this week is that Frasier Crane was an early investor"
00:45:02,00:45:03,in Microsoft.
00:45:03,00:45:06,How?
00:45:06,00:45:08,Because one of them is real.
00:45:08,00:45:11,"One of them is real, which one?"
00:45:11,00:45:13,How did they cross this weird space of time?
00:45:13,00:45:17,"And why did he not go with Dell, which is a far superior company?"
00:45:17,00:45:21,"So Frasier Crane, obviously fictional character"
00:45:21,00:45:24,"from the incredibly popular American sitcom, Frasier."
00:45:24,00:45:27,"Microsoft, obviously a real company."
00:45:27,00:45:31,"And this is a made up back story, which we found out about"
00:45:31,00:45:35,because our old friend Richard Osman tweeted that he didn't
00:45:35,00:45:38,understand how Frasier could possibly afford to live in such
00:45:38,00:45:41,a nice apartment in Seattle on his wages.
00:45:41,00:45:46,"And then one of the writers, Joe Keenan, replied and said"
00:45:46,00:45:49,that they'd kind of talked about it in the writers' room on occasion.
00:45:49,00:45:53,And they said that they decided that he must have invested his money
00:45:53,00:45:58,"from his Boston practice very wisely, perhaps in a friend's Seattle"
00:45:58,00:46:00,software startup.
00:46:00,00:46:03,And we can only infer from that that the Seattle software
00:46:03,00:46:06,"startup must be Microsoft because, apart from anything else,"
00:46:06,00:46:10,Bill Gates was on Frasier as a character.
00:46:10,00:46:13,"And in that episode, he did say he was a fan of Frasier."
00:46:13,00:46:18,So he didn't mention that Frasier had invested in his company beforehand.
00:46:18,00:46:19,"But, you know, that's what I mean."
00:46:19,00:46:21,"That's a bit gauche, isn't it?"
00:46:21,00:46:22,You don't say that in public.
00:46:22,00:46:23,Exactly.
00:46:23,00:46:28,"That's yeah, there is an episode where one of his I think it's his nephew"
00:46:28,00:46:32,with someone who's coming into town and he desperately wants to get a tour
00:46:32,00:46:36,of the Microsoft offices and Frasier is desperately looking for any contact
00:46:36,00:46:41,"that he has. It's just curious that as an investor, he didn't have an in."
00:46:41,00:46:43,I think what happened is that he'd sold all his shares at that point
00:46:43,00:46:46,and people had got a bit upset because it had forced the price down
00:46:46,00:46:49,and they I'm just making stuff up there.
00:46:49,00:46:53,"I was like, oh, OK, yeah, yeah."
00:46:53,00:46:56,"Yeah, because because you're right, because there was that it was Freddy."
00:46:56,00:47:00,So it's his son and he was trying to find somebody that knew anyone at
00:47:00,00:47:05,Microsoft and then he convinced Ross to to get in contact with an ex-boyfriend.
00:47:05,00:47:08,And even when it's because this is like a mega fan talking here.
00:47:08,00:47:13,"Even when Bill Gates comes in, he calls him."
00:47:13,00:47:16,It's very clear that they don't know each other very well at all.
00:47:16,00:47:18,And he calls him sir.
00:47:18,00:47:22,And I'm just saying I'm just saying I think these writers.
00:47:22,00:47:26,It might be a cover up like how probably Boris Johnson would call
00:47:26,00:47:29,"James Dyson, sir, if he walked in, you know, sometimes you don't want"
00:47:29,00:47:32,to be open about quite how tight you are to power.
00:47:32,00:47:35,"Never know. I mean, also, I'm not part of the investor class."
00:47:35,00:47:39,So I also just don't know if you even need to know Bill Gates
00:47:39,00:47:41,to invest in Microsoft. I'm assuming maybe you don't.
00:47:41,00:47:43,"Yeah, that's true, actually."
00:47:43,00:47:47,"If you if you were to buy some stocks in Tesla, you don't have to have"
00:47:47,00:47:51,an interview with Elon Musk beforehand to make sure he's a friend.
00:47:51,00:47:53,Probably a good thing.
00:47:53,00:47:55,"You know, they're rebooting."
00:47:55,00:47:58,"Yeah, are they? Yeah, yeah."
00:47:58,00:48:00,I now feel like I'm going to have to go back and watch it all
00:48:00,00:48:03,"from the start, because I've just seen it very sporadically."
00:48:03,00:48:05,"Well, you should actually start from Cheers and properly"
00:48:05,00:48:07,watch his character development.
00:48:07,00:48:08,It's like delicious.
00:48:08,00:48:11,"Well, that's so we should say this is the most interesting"
00:48:11,00:48:15,thing about Frasier is that it's a spin off series of one of the other
00:48:15,00:48:18,"most popular American sitcoms of all time, Cheers."
00:48:18,00:48:21,And he was a character who just came in and sat at the bar.
00:48:21,00:48:24,"He was only meant to be in for a few episodes, but he proved to be"
00:48:24,00:48:28,so popular with audiences that they wrote him into the series more and more.
00:48:28,00:48:31,"And eventually when they ended, they thought, what are we going to do next"
00:48:31,00:48:34,as a team? And Frasier was this spin off.
00:48:34,00:48:37,"You know, that happened a couple of times."
00:48:37,00:48:41,Does it not even used to annoy me when I was younger that it felt like
00:48:41,00:48:44,there was a disconnect between his character there and then his character
00:48:44,00:48:47,in Frasier or it was like kind of confusing to my young head.
00:48:47,00:48:49,"I was like, how is that the same person?"
00:48:49,00:48:54,"And he seems a bit different and there is lots of inconsistency as a superfan,"
00:48:54,00:48:56,"which must stress you out, Ella, surely."
00:48:56,00:48:59,"Like, I think his it's mentioned that he has a horrible relationship"
00:48:59,00:49:01,with his dad or something in Cheers though.
00:49:01,00:49:03,"Actually, I think still does."
00:49:03,00:49:06,"I think in Cheers, they said that his father was dead."
00:49:06,00:49:12,Yes. And then another character from Cheers came to visit him in the in
00:49:12,00:49:13,the second sitcom.
00:49:13,00:49:15,"He said, I thought you said your father was dead."
00:49:15,00:49:17,"And he said, oh, we were fighting."
00:49:17,00:49:19,So that's how they taught that I see.
00:49:19,00:49:21,"Clever, good luck."
00:49:21,00:49:22,They do a few things like that.
00:49:22,00:49:29,"Yeah. So the Cheers was set in Boston and they wanted to have this new sitcom,"
00:49:29,00:49:32,but they didn't want it to be too close to Boston because then you would have
00:49:32,00:49:35,to deal with all the previous characters and you would have to explain
00:49:35,00:49:37,"why they're not there, et cetera."
00:49:37,00:49:40,"But if you move to the other side of the country, you can get away with it."
00:49:40,00:49:42,"So they're going to move to Denver, Colorado."
00:49:42,00:49:47,"But then in 1992, there was a group called Colorado for Family Values"
00:49:47,00:49:52,"that pushed an amendment, which was described by the writers of Cheers"
00:49:52,00:49:57,"as an egregious anti-gay amendment, which was basically stopping any gay rights"
00:49:57,00:49:58,in Colorado.
00:49:58,00:50:02,"And if you read the newspapers from the time, it was a huge, huge, huge deal."
00:50:02,00:50:05,A load of films stopped being filmed there.
00:50:05,00:50:08,They were going to do a Stephen King movie there and they didn't do it in Colorado.
00:50:08,00:50:12,"And then David Lee, who was one of the show's creators, said that they were going"
00:50:12,00:50:15,"to do they were going to put Fraser in Colorado in Denver,"
00:50:15,00:50:19,but they had to move it away from there because they didn't want to be associated
00:50:19,00:50:20,with this anti-gay amendment.
00:50:20,00:50:26,"And then in 1996, four years later, the US Supreme Court declared it was unconstitutional."
00:50:26,00:50:30,"So it got kicked out anyway, but they lost all of this kind of investment"
00:50:30,00:50:33,and all of these shows and stuff just refused to go to Colorado.
00:50:33,00:50:36,"In your face, Colorado, that's what you get."
00:50:36,00:50:41,Because I feel like I know the space needle now because of because of Fraser.
00:50:41,00:50:42,Yes. Yeah.
00:50:42,00:50:45,"But they all did cameo in Fraser at times, didn't they?"
00:50:45,00:50:50,"Except one main Cheers character who was Rebecca, who actually"
00:50:50,00:50:53,"was probably maybe the most annoying Cheers character anyway, I think,"
00:50:53,00:50:56,"from what I vaguely remember, but she never guested in Fraser."
00:50:56,00:51:00,And it was an actress who is called Kirstie Alley.
00:51:00,00:51:04,"And she said that she turned it down because as a Scientologist,"
00:51:04,00:51:08,her beliefs forbid things like psychiatry.
00:51:08,00:51:11,"So Scientologists are very anti-psychiatry, which I didn't realize."
00:51:11,00:51:12,How interesting.
00:51:12,00:51:15,Yeah. Although she did give an interview saying this.
00:51:15,00:51:18,"And then the show creator, David Lee, said, I don't remember asking her."
00:51:18,00:51:24,"I mean, she was a big deal."
00:51:24,00:51:25,She would have been asked at some point.
00:51:25,00:51:27,She would have been asked. Yeah.
00:51:27,00:51:31,"You know, Kelsey Grammer in that show, quite a fascinating story"
00:51:31,00:51:35,of how he went from being this character that was just a normal actor.
00:51:35,00:51:38,And it happens in these sitcoms where the actor becomes
00:51:38,00:51:40,the biggest part of the show generally.
00:51:40,00:51:41,They become an exec producer.
00:51:41,00:51:42,They start directing.
00:51:42,00:51:46,They start his power grew so great as he was going on that he could start
00:51:46,00:51:49,"pulling these power moves, which felt really bizarre."
00:51:49,00:51:54,So one of the things was he employed an acting method that he called requisite
00:51:54,00:51:59,"disrespect. And the thing was, is that he said he would rehearse each scene"
00:51:59,00:52:04,only once and he would not learn his lines until the moments before
00:52:04,00:52:05,the scene was shot.
00:52:05,00:52:09,"And in some cases go, OK, I'll do it better and not even use the lines."
00:52:09,00:52:14,He said he'd played the role so long that he could now embody any kind
00:52:14,00:52:16,of remark that would come out of Fraser better than a script writer
00:52:16,00:52:18,and just became Fraser Crane himself.
00:52:18,00:52:21,I'll just say whatever I want to say in this show now.
00:52:21,00:52:23,"That's kind of, you know, it works."
00:52:23,00:52:29,"The best actor in Fraser, of course, was Moose, who played the dog, Eddie."
00:52:29,00:52:35,"And he retired at the end of season seven and his son, Enzo, took over the role."
00:52:35,00:52:39,But what I find interesting about that is Moose had been deliberately
00:52:39,00:52:44,"bred to create a new child, which would look enough like him that they would"
00:52:44,00:52:48,"be able to bring him in when he retired, which I think is just a really"
00:52:48,00:52:50,interesting idea of imagine that happened with humans that you were
00:52:50,00:52:54,"you're an actor in a show and they're like, OK, we're going to find someone"
00:52:54,00:52:59,"for you to mate with who looks the right kind of person that when you have kids,"
00:52:59,00:53:01,they'll be able to come up and take your place.
00:53:01,00:53:03,"Well, and they cocked it up a bit, didn't they?"
00:53:03,00:53:06,Because they had to paint Enzo's fur to match his dad.
00:53:06,00:53:08,Didn't quite nail the patterns.
00:53:08,00:53:10,"They didn't. And also, they hated each other."
00:53:10,00:53:12,The father and son.
00:53:12,00:53:17,"Father and son, the creator, Peter Casey, called their relationship"
00:53:17,00:53:19,a classic parent-child Hollywood rivalry.
00:53:19,00:53:22,"By all accounts, Moose was horrible."
00:53:22,00:53:25,"So Eddie, quite lovable on the show."
00:53:25,00:53:27,"Moose was like, bitey."
00:53:27,00:53:30,Everyone hated him like the trainer didn't like anyone else on set
00:53:30,00:53:31,and really hated his son.
00:53:31,00:53:33,"Enzo, they had to be kept apart."
00:53:33,00:53:38,Do you think they were basically mirroring the Frasier and his father's relationship?
00:53:38,00:53:42,"Oh, I hope there's a behind the scenes documentary"
00:53:42,00:53:45,"where it's from their perspective, bickering at each other."
00:53:45,00:53:47,And you've just got Frasier and the dad in the background.
00:53:47,00:53:51,"Well, didn't the dad actually adopt?"
00:53:51,00:53:52,Didn't he adopt?
00:53:52,00:53:54,I think Ross did.
00:53:54,00:53:56,"The actor who played Ross, Perry Gilpin."
00:53:56,00:53:58,Yeah. Yeah. Right.
00:53:58,00:54:03,My favourite fact about Frasier is that the pilot was six minutes too long.
00:54:03,00:54:05,And they chopped and chopped and chopped.
00:54:05,00:54:09,And finally they had a pilot that ended up a 60 seconds longer
00:54:09,00:54:11,than it should have been for the slot.
00:54:11,00:54:15,"So they handed it in and they said, we're sorry, we just can't do anything."
00:54:15,00:54:17,It's 60 seconds too long.
00:54:17,00:54:21,"And amazingly, the network went, OK, so NBC agreed with it."
00:54:21,00:54:26,And they found extra time by taking 15 seconds of four other shows
00:54:26,00:54:29,that were airing that night.
00:54:29,00:54:32,That's how you know you're the favourite of the night.
00:54:32,00:54:36,Are you saying like if you remember that one episode of like Party of Five
00:54:36,00:54:39,"where it ends really abruptly, that was probably the night that Frasier went out."
00:54:39,00:54:43,You remember that game of basketball where it was all tied up with 50 seconds left?
00:54:43,00:54:49,"Lisa Kudrow, who plays Phoebe in Friends,"
00:54:49,00:54:55,actually had the job of Ross initially and got fired before they even really started.
00:54:55,00:54:58,"And you're saying Ross, not Ross, aren't you?"
00:54:58,00:55:00,"Because for Lisa Kudrow, she cast as Ross."
00:55:00,00:55:05,We're talking about a random factor suddenly throw in Ella.
00:55:05,00:55:08,We're talking about Frasier here. Come on.
00:55:08,00:55:11,"Sorry, Ross, that was supposed to be Lisa Kudrow."
00:55:11,00:55:14,It was Lisa Kudrow and then she got fired.
00:55:14,00:55:19,And you can imagine like she has stories about how people were so shocked
00:55:19,00:55:22,"that she got fired from this massive show that they were like looking at her like,"
00:55:22,00:55:24,"oh, we are so sorry."
00:55:24,00:55:26,Like she just she wanted to just die basically.
00:55:26,00:55:28,She fell her feet in the end.
00:55:28,00:55:32,"Right. She went to a fortune teller who was like, it's OK."
00:55:32,00:55:33,I see big things for you.
00:55:33,00:55:36,"And if I was like, it's absolutely bullshit, Lisa, your career is over."
00:55:36,00:55:41,"And then. Well, she said that she she was so depressed."
00:55:41,00:55:45,"I think that day or that kind of in those few days, she went to a party"
00:55:45,00:55:50,"and she she was just like, oh, this is so I'm so past it."
00:55:50,00:55:51,I've got nothing else.
00:55:51,00:55:52,And she sees this cute guy.
00:55:52,00:55:54,"She just goes, why not?"
00:55:54,00:55:55,Nothing else is who cares?
00:55:55,00:55:57,I'm just going to go hit on him and she ended up marrying him.
00:55:57,00:56:02,So it's really it's kind of a woman who's just managed to make it all work for her
00:56:02,00:56:04,"from from being, you know, fired."
00:56:04,00:56:06,"It's amazing what Scientology can do, isn't it?"
00:56:06,00:56:08,"No, no, no, no."
00:56:08,00:56:10,"No, this is Lisa Kudrow."
00:56:10,00:56:12,Lisa Kudrow is like a nice Jewish girl.
00:56:12,00:56:16,"Hey, question."
00:56:16,00:56:20,Which actor in Frasier is from Manchester?
00:56:20,00:56:24,"Oh, well, Jay Leaves, Jay Leaves, the British one."
00:56:24,00:56:26,Incorrect.
00:56:26,00:56:29,So devastated to learn this.
00:56:29,00:56:30,She's not.
00:56:30,00:56:33,"I think she grew up in East Grinstead, which is very much the south of England."
00:56:33,00:56:35,And I'm a Scientology.
00:56:35,00:56:38,So I guess the alley.
00:56:38,00:56:40,Stop picking everyone up Frasier Scientologist.
00:56:40,00:56:44,"Really, I'm saying it's a broad church."
00:56:44,00:56:46,"No, so she was asked to do that accent."
00:56:46,00:56:47,That wasn't a real accent.
00:56:47,00:56:48,And she's from there.
00:56:48,00:56:52,"But John Mahoney, who plays Martin, the dad is from Manchester."
00:56:52,00:56:55,"So he was born in Blackpool, but his family were from Manchester."
00:56:55,00:56:59,"And he was schooled, schooled and raised in Manchester."
00:56:59,00:57:00,Isn't that weird?
00:57:00,00:57:04,"Yeah, you know how we all used to really kind of laugh at her accent"
00:57:04,00:57:07,"being a Mancunian accent, because it was just really weird accent."
00:57:07,00:57:10,"I caught a clip of her once, kind of, where somebody very politely"
00:57:10,00:57:14,"on one of the English morning shows was like, your accent's not really."
00:57:14,00:57:15,"Like, it was, you know, it was a dig."
00:57:15,00:57:17,"But, you know, it was morning television, so they were trying to be polite."
00:57:17,00:57:21,And you could tell that she was very aware of it and kind of a bit
00:57:21,00:57:22,like stressed about it.
00:57:22,00:57:25,"And she kind of said, well, you know, I was told that the"
00:57:25,00:57:29,"the the actual accent that I had was too, it was too strong"
00:57:29,00:57:32,"and the Americans wouldn't, you know, understand it."
00:57:32,00:57:34,"So the actual Mancunian accent was, was, you know,"
00:57:34,00:57:36,considered to be inappropriate or something.
00:57:36,00:57:38,"Oh, yes. I read that."
00:57:38,00:57:42,She was trained to do a relatable to the Americans Mancunian version.
00:57:42,00:57:46,Or that's what she's claiming.
00:57:46,00:57:49,"I thought I'd read that she, her character was living in America"
00:57:49,00:57:52,"for so long at that point, that she had a kind of transatlantic"
00:57:53,00:57:58,drool that had seeped into the Mancunian accent and had distorted it.
00:57:58,00:58:01,"She's all sorts of excuses, isn't she?"
00:58:01,00:58:03,It's like worse than your accent.
00:58:03,00:58:06,"Like, it's like there's there's like."
00:58:06,00:58:08,"I mean, I assume you're talking to me."
00:58:08,00:58:10,Sorry.
00:58:10,00:58:13,"Well, actually, well, for any Americans listening,"
00:58:13,00:58:14,"like I'm from just outside Manchester,"
00:58:14,00:58:17,so she should have an accent that's a bit like mine.
00:58:17,00:58:20,"Instead, it's a bit Yorkshire and then just weird."
00:58:20,00:58:21,"It's a bit, God knows."
00:58:21,00:58:24,It's just too many things.
00:58:24,00:58:26,"It's lovable, which is all that matters."
00:58:26,00:58:29,A lovable accent.
00:58:29,00:58:32,"I read a quote from David Hyde Pierce, who plays Niles,"
00:58:32,00:58:34,"who said, ""To me, Jane is in Jane, Jane leaves."
00:58:34,00:58:37,"To me, Jane and Daphne were identical,"
00:58:37,00:58:39,exquisite and charming with fragrant hair
00:58:39,00:58:42,"that smelled like puppies, springtime and sex."""
00:58:42,00:58:44,Wow.
00:58:44,00:58:45,"That's what I'm saying, he's gay."
00:58:45,00:58:47,"Yeah, exactly."
00:58:47,00:58:50,"It's OK, because he is gay, but otherwise it wouldn't be."
00:58:51,00:58:53,I have to say that's a show that's aged really well.
00:58:53,00:58:56,"You know, a lot of the shows from that period"
00:58:56,00:58:59,"are a lot of kind of issues that you just,"
00:58:59,00:59:01,jokes that you just wouldn't be able to get away with now.
00:59:01,00:59:05,"That's one of those shows that's aged really well,"
00:59:05,00:59:08,"because the joke is always on whoever is being, you know, the..."
00:59:08,00:59:12,"Oh, it's basically, it's never on."
00:59:12,00:59:15,So it's unlike a lot of the other shows of its time.
00:59:15,00:59:17,"Yeah, take that, Lisa Kudrow."
00:59:19,00:59:21,I might have made the wrong choice there.
00:59:21,00:59:24,"OK, that's it."
00:59:24,00:59:25,That is all of our facts.
