00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200
 Hey, everyone, welcome to this week's episode of Fish.

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.760
 Before we begin, just to let you know that we have a special guest on this week.

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.720
 Andy is away looking at thatched roofs around the UK.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.720
 And so in his place, we have got the brilliant Ella Al-Shemahi.

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.000
 Ella is a National Geographic explorer.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.200
 She's a paleoanthropologist, an evolutionary biologist, a standup comedian.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.160
 She's extraordinary.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.880
 And she's written this new book, which is called The Handshake, A Gripping History.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.840
 It's all about, as it says on the tin, the handshake.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.200
 You know, where did it come from?

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.240
 How long have we had it?

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.480
 Is it dead after this pandemic?

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:33.840
 It really is an awesome book.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.040
 It's got amazing chapters.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.720
 I mean, take this as a chapter headline, chapter number three,

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.680
 finger snaps and penis shakes.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:40.880
 Who doesn't want this book?

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.240
 So do go out and get it.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.440
 It's available online.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.240
 You can go back into physical bookshops as well to pick one up

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.520
 and do follow her adventures online as well.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.880
 She can be found on Twitter on @ella_alshamahi.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.880
 Do that because she is packed with facts.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:54.360
 That's right.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.360
 And you'll be getting a bit of a taster of those in the upcoming episode.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.120
 But sadly, of course, Andy is going to be back next week,

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.920
 and he's also going to be joining us for our upcoming tour.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.000
 We couldn't convince Ella to come on that instead.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.760
 But yeah, we've got a tour coming up.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:08.960
 Please join us.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.480
 We are going to lots of fun places, Belfast, Birmingham, Nottingham,

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.480
 Peterborough, Richmond, Dublin, and then loads more.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.640
 Go to knowsuchthingasafish.com to get tickets right now.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.280
 OK, on with the show.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.080
 You can have a bath on your own.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.840
 You can have a bath on your own.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.240
 You can have a bath on your own.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:39.840
 Hello and welcome to another episode of Know Such Thing as a Fish,

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.920
 a weekly podcast coming to you from four undisclosed locations in the UK.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.560
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.000
 I am sitting here with James Harkin, Anna Tyshinski

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.640
 and our special guest, it is paleo anthropologist Ella Al-Shamahi.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.760
 And once again, we have gathered round our microphones

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.040
 with our four favourite facts from the last seven days.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.720
 And in no particular order, here we go.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.120
 Starting with fact number one, that is Ella.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.880
 My fact is that an anti-handshake society was formed in Baku, Azerbaijan

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.640
 in 1894 because of a cholera outbreak.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.360
 You paid six rubles as membership.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.800
 You wore a pin to identify yourself.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.400
 And just in case you did slip up and shake hands,

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.520
 you had to pay three rubles as a fine.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.960
 You're volunteering to be fined.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.280
 If you didn't join the society, you didn't have to be fined.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.160
 Yeah, I mean, there's a question about the money there, isn't it?

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.040
 Six as membership and then three every single time you shake hands.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.120
 Yeah, but if you're signing up, you're fairly confident

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.200
 that you're not going to be doing the handshaking, right?

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.800
 Like, that's it's like instituting the swear box or something.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.880
 But I love the pin that, you know, it's basically declaring

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.240
 that you're really not involved at all.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.080
 You're not having any part of it.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.000
 Do you think that pin is so that people can see you and think

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.440
 that guy is not to be handshuck?

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.520
 I think so. I think it's to identify yourself.

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.800
 But I do have questions about how many people were actually wearing these pins.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.320
 You know, is it just you and Mike down the street?

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.440
 Or was it actually a lot of people wearing it?

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.880
 I don't. You're talking about it like it was a police badge.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.560
 I don't think anyone was staring at the badge anyway.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.400
 It was probably a badge that was like, I love Ninja Turtles that, you know,

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.000
 I would wear like, yeah, it's on me, but no one's no one's paying attention.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.200
 Right. I mean, who knows?

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.480
 This is this is way back since over a hundred years ago.

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.840
 But the thing that I love about this bit is that the lancet of all things,

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.080
 which is obviously really respectable medical journal,

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.560
 absolutely blasted them for this and just blasted them for not refusing

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.360
 to shake hands during an epidemic, which is hilarious, obviously, today.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.720
 And they're basically are these Russians.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.640
 They've taken everything too seriously.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:43.920
 They've completely lost it.

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.520
 Obviously, that has not aged well, has it?

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:50.560
 So they knew that shaking hands was going to be bad for the spread of cholera.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:51.760
 This is why they did it.

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.000
 So, yes, this society knew it.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.520
 Obviously, generally, the people in that area didn't.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.920
 And more importantly, the whole of the Western medical establishment

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.080
 thought they were lunatics.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.080
 So this is a story that just kept getting repeated everywhere,

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.120
 kind of in that that period, which is people going,

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.960
 what is going on with these Russians?

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.480
 I mean, that's about it, but at the time, it was, you know, they were clad as Russians.

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.240
 Yeah, that was a really bad cholera outbreak in Baku, started in 1892.

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:20.600
 And when it first got into the town, they didn't have a single microscope

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:26.480
 in the entire city and everyone realized that there was this problem with cholera

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:32.040
 and everyone just fled the city had 120,000 people at the start of June.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.360
 And by the end of June, there were only 20,000 people left in Baku.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.680
 And so basically, people had fled out of Baku, but it meant that they'd taken

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.800
 cholera with them on the trains and the boats to the whole rest of Russia.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.560
 And then there was a cholera outbreak for two more years in the whole of Russia.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.600
 And in Baku, they had four doctors who were in charge of all the different

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.520
 sanitary sections of the town.

00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:00.000
 And they were called Arkhangelsky, Akhundov, Lokheman and Dr. Corona.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.920
 He believed that.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.440
 It's Russian for crown, but he was called Dr. Corona.

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:07.400
 Yeah, that's amazing.

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.200
 How come they spread it because cholera is pretty hard to spread person to person?

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:12.800
 It's you've got to be drinking their poo.

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.120
 Well, it can be misconception, right?

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.080
 In the olden days and actually handshake, avoiding handshaking

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.560
 probably wasn't fully necessary unless someone had just wiped their bum.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:26.200
 It can it can go on clothing and on bedding and stuff like that.

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.520
 So I think that was one one way it went.

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.800
 So I actually think that's why the lancet were having a go at them

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.400
 because the lancet rather racistly were like, oh, the Russians have terrible

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.280
 sanitation and their solution is just not to shake hands.

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.240
 They're being absolutely ludicrous as opposed to, you know, like.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.280
 But it's it's an interesting one.

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.880
 Yeah, because because they do say that it's not really touch that gives you cholera,

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:51.160
 although actually refugee camps or workers, they are told not to shake hands

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.840
 and to have distance if there's a cholera outbreak.

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.240
 So presumably it's a little bit.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.320
 Yeah, it's feces getting in your mouth.

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.200
 And if you have feces on your hands, then, you know, if you got two hands,

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.080
 you could have traces.

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.760
 I mean, it's easy to get traces, isn't it?

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:09.360
 Yeah, well, I think it's just it's only just the point that people often thought

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.640
 that it was really bad to be around people who had cholera in the olden days.

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:14.120
 And people would try and keep them in a different room.

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:17.600
 But actually, largely, it's just from drinking infected water.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.880
 And it's so horrible when you read these tales of people being so terrified

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.760
 and fleeing, it's so easy to treat.

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:26.520
 It must be the easiest disease on earth to treat, right?

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:27.720
 You die of dehydration.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.520
 You can die within two hours of getting it.

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:33.400
 But if you just drink and if you drink rehydration salts,

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:37.040
 if you're super dehydrated or if you just neck water constantly, you're basically fine.

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:41.480
 OK, so we're saying that it is water, but and there might be traces.

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:44.560
 But do you guys know that only 90 percent of people globally

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:46.960
 actually wash their hands after a number two?

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.520
 Do they? Only 19 percent.

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.400
 I suppose you can take out all the men.

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:56.240
 So it's, you know, 19 percent of the 50 percent of the women, you know,

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.240
 everyone knows that no men wash their hands after they go to the toilet.

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:00.960
 So what is that thing?

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:04.880
 Yeah, I heard that they actually did a study of what's it called?

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:08.640
 Thingy stations, service stations, the men's toilets.

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:11.640
 And it was not. It was not a good site.

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:15.400
 OK, well, that's that's a that's a whole different world,

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.000
 the men's toilets in a service.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.200
 No, not in that way, Dan.

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.640
 I mean, just in terms of washing your hands afterwards.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.440
 Well, no, you don't want to touch anything.

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:27.120
 Even the even the washing of the hands, you know, pressing the tap down.

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:29.360
 I feel like I'm going to get a disease in a place like that.

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:33.240
 So that's that's a place where you touch nothing, except yourself and then go out.

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:35.320
 I don't mean that.

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:37.760
 That is that does happen a lot for the stations.

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.760
 Yeah, that's right.

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:42.400
 But you do wash your hands, though, Dan, right?

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:43.280
 Not in service stations.

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:45.760
 I'll happily admit that I don't touch anything.

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:48.520
 I do think men's toilets are worse because they get cleaned less often.

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:50.600
 I think that's the thing. Or perhaps this is just a thing that.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:52.960
 No, I think they're just not very clean.

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:54.360
 You are. You think they're just not clean.

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:57.160
 Like, do you think any woman would just admit to what Dan just admitted to?

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:01.880
 I think the problem is not admitting to it is really what we're saying here.

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:03.840
 We're just liars.

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:07.120
 Just on the handshakes, one more thing in in Russia.

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.680
 This carried on for a while.

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:13.360
 And in 1918 in St. Petersburg, there was a quite a common slogan

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:17.160
 called down with the handshake and you could again buy little badges

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:21.440
 which had down with the handshake on because people thought the handshaking was bad.

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:25.680
 And there was a union of simplifying greetings in the 1920s,

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:29.520
 which not only banned handshakes, it also banned hugs and kisses.

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:33.440
 And Bulgarkov writes about it in one of his early stories called Devildom.

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:36.600
 My problem with all of this is whenever we kind of talk about the handshake

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:40.880
 you know, just how gross it is, how many people weren't shaking hands, etc.

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:43.000
 etc. at various times, because of things.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.040
 I always just think once upon a time on our planet, there were penis handshakes

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:49.440
 and we're mortified.

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.720
 Dan still does that in the welcome break every weekend.

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:55.960
 What is a penis handshake?

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:59.160
 Does that two penis is shaking or one out of the two penis are?

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:02.120
 No, it's one hand shakes the penis.

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:04.840
 And this was this was by one one tribe in Australia.

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:08.240
 And, you know, it's only recently extinct.

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:10.280
 I think it became extinct in the 1950s.

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:15.680
 So what it is is one village, one group of people from one village comes to another group.

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:20.800
 The visitors, they offer their their penises

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:25.040
 to the to the people who are home, you know, who are at home, basically.

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:27.200
 It's like bringing a bottle of wine to exactly.

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:31.160
 Exactly. If the men at home, if one of them refuses to to shake it,

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:33.320
 that's akin to a declaration of war.

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:36.800
 So then the panicked visitor offers it to all the other guys

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.360
 in the hopes that one of them shakes it.

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:41.440
 Because if one of them shakes it, it's basically we vouch for you, mate.

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:43.600
 He's probably all right. Fascinating.

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:47.080
 Absolutely amazing. God, how long did this last for?

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:49.880
 You said it ended in what, the 50s?

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:53.160
 Yeah. So the last reference, so the reference we have of it,

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:57.000
 kind of a really detailed anthropological study was in the 1950s.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.760
 And then we don't really know anything after that.

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:03.880
 And it's just really hard to know what really went down, if that makes sense.

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:06.320
 But also because I've got to be honest, as an anthropologist,

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:08.640
 sometimes I feel like anthropologists turn up somewhere

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:10.840
 and tribes just do whatever they want.

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:14.200
 There's always a bit of me that's like.

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:16.960
 So you think this tribe is like, yeah, we do this every day, mate.

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:20.640
 Yeah, of course, behind the corner, they're just giggling to themselves,

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:23.360
 go ahead and swallow that, not literally swallow it.

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:28.000
 I found it really fascinating reading about handshakes,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.320
 both historical and modern ones.

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:32.560
 And some of my favourite ones that I've discovered,

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:37.320
 probably my favourite, whenever Prince Charles used to participate

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:40.480
 in a tree planting ceremony, he'd always give one of the branches

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:42.760
 a handshake and wish it well before leaving.

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:44.960
 Wow.

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:49.040
 Was that the penis handshake or your standard just hand on twig, right?

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:51.040
 Just hand on twig.

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:52.160
 Oh, God, yeah.

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:57.200
 Charles mob out just waiting for the wind to brush a branch against it.

00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:05.080
 If he doesn't accept, he goes to the other trees, please, one of you.

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:08.960
 What I found really interesting about this fact, what I liked about it,

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:12.480
 the initial fact is just the idea that we've been doing some of the same stuff

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:15.920
 for so long, you know, we say there's a disease spreading, don't handshake today.

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:17.120
 The same back then.

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:21.760
 And I hadn't quite realised how widespread that advice was around pandemic time.

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:25.600
 So there was like, it went out of fashion basically always

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:28.720
 when there was an illness around, didn't it, in the early 20th century.

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:31.080
 You're right, you keep seeing it time and time again.

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:34.080
 So Prescott, Arizona actually banned the handshake during the Spanish flu.

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:35.800
 They just made it illegal.

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:38.920
 And you do see stuff like that during different pandemics and epidemics.

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:41.640
 People either shun it or they actually completely ban it.

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:44.760
 So it's not the first time at all, you know.

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:49.280
 They had handshake police sort of going down the street, throwing people apart.

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:50.320
 I suppose they must have.

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:51.560
 I'd love to have that.

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:53.840
 Not really sure how they would have policed it.

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:54.920
 I guess it's like everything.

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:56.960
 How on earth do you police any of this stuff?

00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:00.280
 I guess you would just grass on your neighbours doing the handshakes, wouldn't you?

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:02.720
 That's what usually happens.

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:05.200
 Yeah, it's probably like today, you can't police.

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:07.240
 And it's like diversion.

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:10.960
 But like I was, I was in like Yemeni is a very, very, I'm Yemeni originally.

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:13.240
 Yemeni is very famous for polygamy.

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:16.280
 Like it's a really big thing to men tend to have loads of wives.

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:17.160
 I was in a cab.

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:21.280
 There's a Yemeni taxi driver and I was like, how's your dad handling lockdown?

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:22.560
 He was like, oh, he's been a bit naughty.

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:24.320
 He went out and visited his second wife.

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:29.080
 I was like, first of all, that's so typically Yemeni.

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:31.440
 Secondly, how do you police that?

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:33.040
 Like I'm going to go see my second wife.

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:35.400
 But how are the police going to get involved with any of this stuff?

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:38.040
 Yeah, that's just an extended bubble, isn't it?

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:44.920
 Ella, there's a thing that you say in the book, which I found quite surprising.

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:50.480
 I think when you read facts about handshakes, a lot of a sort of very classic

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:53.640
 fact that's out there, which turns out to be wrong, is that the handshake was sort

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:56.720
 of that came about during medieval times to show you didn't have a weapon in your

00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:00.200
 hand and that you were presenting an open palm to show you.

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:03.760
 But that turns out that's according to your book, completely wrong, right?

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:07.880
 Yes, yes, my research very much is against this.

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:11.120
 But I love that I've now become the authority on the handshake in this country.

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:14.000
 Like, I just don't know how this happened, but I'm completely loving it

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.800
 with all the random things.

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:17.160
 But yeah, I think the sport was open.

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.360
 There wasn't an established handshake authority.

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:21.720
 All right, all right, all right.

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:26.400
 No, but yeah, so I kind of looked into it and it just never made any sense.

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:29.280
 And my argument is that the handshake is biological.

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:33.200
 And I've got two arguments for this to support it rather.

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:36.800
 One is the chimps shake hands, so chimps and bonobos shake hands.

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:41.600
 Dr. Kat Hobaiter showed that the chip handshake actually has a very similar

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:45.000
 meaning to our own. So she's got, like, for example, videos of two chimps

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.760
 kind of really going at each other in a fight and then kind of sheepishly

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:51.320
 walking up to each other and shaking hands to make up, which is adorable.

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:55.320
 So if you think about it, our closest living relatives of the chimps and bonobos,

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:58.200
 it kind of makes sense that, you know, that's by descent.

00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:00.520
 So I'm arguing that the handshake is seven million years old.

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:06.360
 But the coolest bit that kind of supports this is that we actually transfer

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:09.400
 chemo signals, chemical signals via handshakes.

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:12.880
 And there's data to show that we actually sniff our hands afterwards.

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:17.600
 And I know that sounds absolutely mad, but chemo signals are something

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:19.840
 a lot of us don't really realise are actually going on.

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:23.080
 So I think we accept that, you know, the animals in the animal kingdom

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:25.080
 communicate with each other chemically.

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:27.880
 But we like to think that our communications are via like sonnets

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:30.000
 and, you know, language and what have you.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.880
 But it's it's absolutely bull because we do communicate with each other chemically.

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:37.440
 So they did these crazy experiments where they got gauze.

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:39.280
 They put it under people's armpits.

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:42.800
 They got them to watch, you know, stressful films or happy films.

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:45.920
 And then they took that gauze to a different group of participants

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:51.520
 and they go point to the bottle that has gauze in it that is like smells like happiness.

00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:55.320
 And they were getting it right more than you'd expect by chance, which.

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:58.960
 So when we shake hands, you're saying, we're trying to tell someone I'm really happy

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:02.360
 or I'm freaking out and we're hoping that you smell your hands afterwards.

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:04.120
 And you go, oh, God, are you OK?

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:07.360
 Yeah, there's one institute, the Wiseman Institute,

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:10.360
 actually put hidden cameras on people and they showed that people were more

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:14.640
 likely to put their hand to their nose and take a sniff after they shake hands

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:16.560
 than if they agree in a different way.

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:19.120
 So it's it's we're just animals, basically.

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:22.560
 Whenever I close a Zoom call, I always sniff my computer afterwards.

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:26.800
 That's why I'm just in case I can gain some information.

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:32.520
 Anything is your computer sad?

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:35.960
 I've had color quite badly this whole time.

00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:39.240
 Right. So we do know it's covered in your own faces.

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:43.760
 I think most people could have worked that out anyway.

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:52.720
 OK, it is time for fact number two.

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:54.280
 And that is my fact.

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:58.320
 My fact this week is the 2013 recipient of the Amelia Earhart

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:03.000
 pioneering achievement award, who later successfully completed Amelia Earhart's

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.240
 fatal circumnavigation of the world is called Amelia Earhart.

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:11.480
 What? Did she change her name for it?

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:13.400
 She did. She did not change her name.

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:15.720
 She was born Amelia Rose Earhart.

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:19.800
 She was named that by her parents because they wanted to inspire her by

00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:24.400
 pairing her up as a namesake to one of the great aviators of all time.

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:29.480
 And I don't believe that there's any kind of aviation history in her family.

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:34.600
 She tried to find out if she was actually descended from Amelia Earhart

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:38.600
 in any way, if she was a relative, because they lived fairly close to each other.

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:41.400
 And it turns out there's nothing that connects them.

00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:44.680
 She hired a genealogist who looked into it and said that she was connected

00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:46.760
 as far back as the 1700s.

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:50.320
 And then she found a sort of second advanced team who said there's absolutely

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:53.040
 no traceable connection. So. So weird.

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:58.520
 Yeah, my brother is having a kids and we're like, names aren't important.

00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:02.000
 And now I'm like, no, names are definitely, definitely important.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.720
 Like, that is so random.

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:07.280
 I think if you want someone to win a prize and you actually give them

00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:10.880
 the name of that prize, like if your brother decides to call his

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:15.880
 child the Nobel Prize for Chemistry or something, and he might have a chance.

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:18.960
 I mean, he won't have a chance in school.

00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:25.280
 But, you know, having friends, it just detracts from all that time

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:27.400
 you could spend doing chemistry, doesn't it? That's the thing.

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:28.240
 Yeah.

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:31.080
 Hold on. So she was the first.

00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:33.840
 She couldn't have been the first person to to then redo it.

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:36.280
 No, no, she wasn't the first person to redo it.

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:40.040
 She she's she's the second youngest ever to do it, though,

00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:42.920
 which is a pretty amazing feat in itself.

00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:47.200
 No, it was done solo by another person a few years beforehand.

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:51.280
 The media reported that she had done it because I think it felt like a better story.

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:54.400
 Yeah, yeah, I did it.

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:58.000
 And sorry, when you say because I couldn't help noticing that in your wording,

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.600
 you said she successfully completed Amelia Earhart's fatal circumnavigation.

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:04.400
 So she didn't complete the fatal bit, right?

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:07.040
 She decided to remain alive throughout.

00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:08.160
 Is that correct? Yes.

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:10.520
 She's cool. It was it was a cheat.

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:12.920
 I'll be really sticking to the cause, wouldn't it?

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:18.240
 To think, well, I've really got to follow her into what states and disappear as well.

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:21.440
 Yeah, especially not knowing where she disappeared.

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:23.160
 Like, that's quite quite a feat.

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:26.240
 Well, the thing is, though, we so we don't know the exact spot

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:29.120
 where Amelia Earhart disappeared, but we know roughly the area.

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:32.200
 It's Howland Island is the general area.

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:34.640
 This is a place that is in the Pacific Ocean.

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:36.760
 It's halfway between Hawaii and Australia.

00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:41.360
 There were ships in the immediate area that were on radio contact with Amelia Earhart

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:43.320
 trying to help guide her there.

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:45.600
 So it was her. It was her co-pilot.

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:48.160
 It really doesn't feature much in this story.

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:50.320
 You know, I know, right?

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:53.280
 Don't don't die next to someone famous.

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:54.760
 You know, don't blame yourself.

00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:57.480
 Famous. This really is the great example of that.

00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:00.240
 Because most people didn't even know there was another dude there.

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:01.800
 I don't think it was her.

00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:03.320
 I always thought she tried it alone.

00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:06.640
 And I I couldn't believe I found myself researching this and thinking,

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:10.320
 we've really got to rejuvenate the reputation of the man in this story.

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:13.600
 Way too much cuteness for it.

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:15.880
 Fred Noonan. And he was a navigator.

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:19.560
 He was brought on to be able to navigate using the stars and help them find

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.200
 where she was going. She was going to do a lot of it solo.

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:25.720
 But I think he was so good at what he did that he sort of hitched the ride

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:28.040
 for much more of it than he was meant to.

00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:30.520
 And he's a guy who was known for surviving stuff.

00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:34.440
 He used to be a he used to work on ammunition ships during wars.

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:38.440
 And his he was on three separate vessels that were all sunk by U-boats.

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:39.640
 And he survived.

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:42.200
 So, you know, this is a guy with a good survival rate.

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:45.880
 I would think of that as a bad omen, because that certainly implies that my

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:48.280
 plane is going to go down and crash and I'm going to die.

00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:49.160
 But he'll walk away.

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:53.880
 He's got this is like I went through a five year period.

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:57.280
 Every time I turn up on an expedition somewhere that was coming out of war,

00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:58.840
 suddenly would go straight back into war.

00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:02.080
 The minute I would turn up and it was like my brother was like,

00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:03.160
 do you think you're cursed?

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:05.280
 I was like, maybe.

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:07.880
 Is it true that Amelia Earhart got ripped apart by crabs?

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:09.760
 That's why I always read at the end.

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:12.760
 Well, this is one of the latest theories.

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:17.360
 So, so Howland Island is the island that she was meant to be landing on.

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:19.960
 There's another island next to it, which is Gardner Island.

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:25.320
 And it's thought that that is where she turned and landed on a reef, survived.

00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:30.720
 And then was eventually killed by giant crabs, which ate her, carried her

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:35.000
 bones to the the holes that they dig and left her down there.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.040
 So that is a theory.

00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:40.080
 And one of the last expeditions, which I believe happened in about

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:46.280
 2017, 2018, they had bone sniffing dogs to try and find her.

00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:49.280
 And bone sniffing dogs can smell quite far down.

00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:52.400
 And so the hope was is that they were going to find her.

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:55.680
 And I think they found some bones, but I don't don't think it was hers.

00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:58.120
 That is a dog's dream job, isn't it?

00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:00.680
 I'm going to I'm going to literally employ you to find bones.

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:02.400
 Yeah, that is amazing.

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:05.360
 The only better job is chasing post-med, isn't it?

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:07.960
 Yeah.

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:10.840
 Yeah, I think they did an experiment where they tested

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:13.160
 how well she could have been consumed by these crabs.

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:17.120
 And it was coconut hermit crabs, which we must have mentioned before.

00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:19.680
 And they are giant crabs in the largest land crab.

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:21.040
 They're like three feet wide.

00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:23.200
 They can kill birds and climb trees and stuff.

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:27.200
 And their claws produce double the force of a tiger's bite

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:29.360
 so they can just crunch through bones.

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:33.920
 And I think the scientists took a pig carcass to the beach

00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:36.880
 where they found these sort of remnants that could be Amelia Earhart.

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:38.880
 I think they found like lipstick remnants and stuff.

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:40.000
 So they thought she'd been there.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.440
 So they brought a pig carcass to the beach and they left it there.

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:44.640
 And there's a time lapse that I believe you can watch,

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:47.880
 which shows the crabs just destroying this thing,

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:50.200
 turning it to nothing within a week.

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:51.480
 It's really cool.

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:53.680
 But she wasn't killed by them, which should be clear.

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:55.480
 Although that would have been an awesome way to go.

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:57.040
 Well, we don't know. We don't know anything.

00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:57.680
 We don't know.

00:21:57.680 --> 00:21:59.720
 She might have been murdered by a coconut crab.

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:02.640
 There's so many theories, aren't there?

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:06.240
 They've come out about this over the last 70 odd years

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:10.440
 about her disappearance and everything from alien abduction

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:13.640
 through to she was captured by Japanese soldiers

00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:18.520
 and was broadcasting as Tokyo Rose to, you know, all stuff like that.

00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:21.880
 It's pretty exciting when you go through the big list.

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:26.600
 Yeah, I know you guys deal with facts, but in terms of feelings,

00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:29.800
 do you think that, you know, if she was in any way kind of aware

00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:32.440
 of what was going on, there's a bit of her that's like, damn, I didn't.

00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:35.040
 I didn't succeed, but they're still obsessed with me.

00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:35.880
 Do you know what I mean?

00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:38.920
 Like the world is still like, what happened to Amelia Earhart?

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:41.560
 Yeah, I hope she's, yeah, she's up there going,

00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:43.720
 thank God they've forgotten all about that noon and guy.

00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:49.760
 She was really pro kind of getting as many women to fly aeroplanes

00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:51.280
 as possible, wasn't she?

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:57.000
 She was the first president of the 99s, which was a group of women who

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.360
 basically were dedicated to ice creams, weren't they?

00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:00.920
 That was it. That was all they used to do.

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:03.360
 Just eat ice creams all day.

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:06.640
 They had 99 problems, but a flake wasn't one.

00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:07.640
 God.

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:08.720
 God.

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:14.920
 But they really, basically the first licenses you could get in America

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:19.080
 were in 1927 and within two years were 9,000 men with licenses

00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:21.400
 and only 117 women.

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:24.960
 And so they started this club to try and encourage more women to fly.

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:27.840
 And there were some amazing people who were part of it.

00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:32.840
 There was one woman called Opal Kuntz, who was part of the 99s.

00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:37.000
 And she was one of the first women to, sorry, what?

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:38.760
 No, no, no, that's not much over that.

00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:40.360
 Could you just say the name once more?

00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:41.360
 Opal Kuntz.

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:47.840
 Opal Kuntz was one of the first people to fly against men in races.

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:49.920
 And she used to win them as well.

00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:52.400
 She used to she was a really, really good racing pilot.

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:57.360
 And there was a thing in 1929 where it was the first women's air derby

00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:01.600
 where they went all the way across America from Santa Monica to Cleveland, Ohio.

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:05.000
 And the newspapers called it the powder puff derby

00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:08.160
 because it was all women taking part.

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:12.000
 There were 40 people who took part and she would have won it.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.680
 But they said that her aircraft must have a horsepower appropriate for a woman.

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:19.520
 In other words, her plane was too fast.

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:20.760
 They wouldn't let her fly it.

00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:23.600
 So she had to fly in a slower aeroplane and she came seven.

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:27.080
 I want to use her surname to describe them.

00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:29.360
 Is that bad? No, it's quite right.

00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:32.520
 And then the other thing about the 99s

00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:35.960
 is Amelia Earhart had a thing called the Hat of the Month Programme.

00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:40.520
 And she would give it to whichever member of the club flew to the most airports

00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:43.560
 wearing a Stetson hat that she designed herself.

00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:48.440
 That is so weird because she initially preferred hats to planes.

00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:51.200
 What's her origin story, Amelia Earhart?

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:53.840
 It's really great. She wrote a diary that's quite detailed.

00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:55.280
 So we know lots about what she thought.

00:24:55.280 --> 00:25:00.160
 And she saw her very first airplane when she was 10 at the Iowa State Fair.

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:02.000
 And there were planes there.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.960
 And so she was 10 years old.

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:06.320
 She saw this plane and was like, I wasn't interested at all.

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:08.640
 It was just a bunch of kind of wood and wire.

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:11.040
 And someone said, look, dear, it flies.

00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:15.000
 And she said, I was much more interested in an absurd hat made

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.400
 from an inverted peach basket that I just bought.

00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:20.400
 And so that's that was her first love.

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:22.440
 So maybe she was all about the hats.

00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:25.520
 The whole plane thing was so that she could get this Stetson hat competition.

00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:28.920
 Right, she had her own fashion label, didn't she? I think.

00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:32.640
 Back then, it was really hard to fund all of these projects.

00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:35.040
 And she wrote some books and she used to go on lecture tours.

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:38.320
 But one of the other things she did was become one of the first

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:41.120
 for the modern era, celebrity fashion designers.

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:44.040
 And she had her own line, this Amelia Earhart fashion line,

00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:47.960
 where she would incorporate bits of airplane onto the clothing as well.

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:52.520
 So she would have wing bolts and she would have, you know, sort of little.

00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:57.160
 You know, that hat that people wear with a like a rotor on the top of it.

00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:58.920
 She had that.

00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:01.520
 Oh, God, I wish she did.

00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:02.520
 No, I don't think so.

00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:05.160
 I'm going to speak to my expedition buddies,

00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:08.280
 because right now we're trying to approach like Dell to give us like funding.

00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:14.440
 And I'm like, no, no, guys, let's just go design a fashion line to fund our expeditions.

00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:18.680
 It kind of pioneered fashion a bit as well, didn't it?

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:25.240
 Because up until then women were wearing one piece suits or dress

00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:27.120
 or it was always one thing.

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:31.680
 And she, with this fashion line, created the idea or at least popularized it

00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:35.760
 quite nicely, separates the idea of matching this with this skirt,

00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:39.240
 with this jacket, with this shirt, you know, you buy in different pieces.

00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:41.160
 And that really wasn't a thing back then.

00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:44.160
 And she kind of pushed it to be as part of her line.

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:45.520
 Wow.

00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:47.720
 Ella, what was the name of that company

00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:50.600
 that you want to give you some money for your next exhibition?

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:52.960
 Was it Dell, the makers of amazing computers

00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:55.480
 that everyone should go and buy computers from?

00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:57.160
 Dell, but I'll take IBM.

00:26:57.160 --> 00:26:59.160
 I'll take anyone.

00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:00.240
 I will take anyone.

00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:05.000
 And then I will, I can't stop actually, because she didn't need to fund it.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.680
 I will take anyone.

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:10.920
 Yeah, Dell already to sign off on that, you know,

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:14.640
 until you pinch yourself out to all of their competitors.

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:18.720
 Oops, oh well.

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:21.400
 Do you know, she did have one successful fundraising thing,

00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:23.400
 which is what did fund her trips.

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:25.400
 And that was carrying letters.

00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:28.520
 So she wasn't a carrier pigeon.

00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:30.440
 She was, she was a postman.

00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:33.240
 OK, this is this is actually her career.

00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:38.080
 No, she was, um, she had this idea of basically crowdfunding

00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:41.280
 by saying that she would take letters that people had written

00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:44.360
 with commemorative stamps that said, like,

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:46.440
 I went all the way around the world with Amelia Earhart,

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:48.680
 or I went over the Atlantic with Amelia Earhart.

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:52.040
 So I think across the Atlantic, she had 100 or so commemorative stamps

00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:54.960
 and she'd sign them and on her round the world trip, that plane.

00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:58.800
 And when we find it, we'll have 5,000 stamped letters in.

00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:03.600
 And she said that she's such a hassle on every stop along the way.

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:06.280
 She had to postmark every single one of those letters.

00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:11.280
 With a sack, 5,000 letters down to the local post office

00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:12.760
 in wherever, Hawaii.

00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:15.360
 I wonder if I wonder if they told the bone-snipping dogs,

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:17.680
 you know, she used to be a postwoman, just to give them

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:20.680
 that extra bit of incentive.

00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:28.000
 You know what? This makes me feel better that even Amelia Earhart

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.320
 struggled with financing her expeditions.

00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:32.680
 This is just, this is information I needed, Anna.

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:34.080
 Bless you, thank you.

00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:37.080
 That's offered to deliver mail as part of them.

00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:39.000
 Where are you next going? I'm sure there are people who have letters.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.000
 Somaliland?

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.480
 Perfect.

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:45.600
 I, if anyone's got a friend in Somaliland, you need to write a letter.

00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:47.080
 LSU Women.

00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:49.640
 She charges a grand letter.

00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:51.280
 Thank you.

00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:56.400
 So Amelia Earhart was the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic.

00:28:56.400 --> 00:29:01.560
 But she was actually the first woman to cross the Atlantic in a plane

00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:04.680
 where she wasn't a solo flyer.

00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:08.480
 And that was when she was a guest in the plane of Wilma Stoltz

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:11.360
 and a guy called Slim Gordon.

00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:15.760
 And she spent the flight crouched in between the fuel tanks of the plane.

00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:17.760
 So she went as a passenger over.

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:21.200
 But she said that she was no more useful than a sack of potatoes.

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:23.920
 When you eat potatoes.

00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:25.400
 Yes, they are useful.

00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:27.040
 She was less useful.

00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:29.200
 You can make them into loads of different things, potatoes.

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:32.120
 They're probably one of the most useful of all the vegetables, aren't they?

00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:35.280
 They're more edible than Amelia Earhart, unless you're a coconut crowd.

00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:38.600
 Yeah, they're less good at flying a plane.

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:40.720
 Are they in emergency situations?

00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:41.720
 They are. That's true.

00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:43.360
 You wouldn't call on, you might call on Mr.

00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:46.800
 Potato Head if you're really desperate, but he's probably the only potato you want.

00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:52.040
 But yeah, that was actually what launched her flying career.

00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:54.560
 Guesting or no, it wasn't what launched it, sorry.

00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:58.560
 But that really propelled her to stratospheric heights, as it were, career wise,

00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:02.920
 because she was put up to it by another woman called Amy Phipps Guest,

00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:05.120
 who was actually this millionaire.

00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:07.960
 And this woman, Amy Phipps, wanted to make the crossing.

00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:11.000
 She was like, women can do just as much as men can do.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.760
 I want to cross the Atlantic with these two chaps.

00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:14.640
 And her family just begged her not to go.

00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:17.480
 Like, we love you too much. You too, Rich. Come on, stay.

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:20.480
 So she said, OK, well, find me a suitable woman.

00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:25.360
 And she hired a guy called George Putnam to find a woman who she wanted to be

00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:29.200
 adventurous, but actually in Amelia's diary, by the time they tracked her down,

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:34.120
 they were looking for someone with social graces, education, charm and pulchritude.

00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:38.240
 So the men had obviously slightly changed the advert on the way.

00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:39.600
 G-S-O-H.

00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:42.080
 Yes, yeah.

00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:45.600
 But George Putnam found her and ended up marrying her

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:47.280
 as well as getting her on the flight.

00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:49.760
 And when do we ever hear about George Putnam?

00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:53.400
 Exactly. More airtime for George.

00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:57.160
 So she had a wealthy benefactor to start off with.

00:30:57.160 --> 00:31:00.520
 She did.

00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:03.920
 This podcast is quickly becoming a how to fund my next expedition.

00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:09.040
 I'm the rich woman. I hear Mrs. Melinda Gates.

00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:15.640
 I don't know what the people at Dalla are going to think about that.

00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:18.720
 I'll take any of them.

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:28.240
 OK, it is time for fact number three, and that is Anna.

00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:32.200
 My fact this week is that scientists have started putting fossilised

00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:34.720
 poos in particle accelerators.

00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:38.160
 Why are they like that?

00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:40.920
 Well, A, it's fun.

00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:43.480
 And B, you can learn loads about the poo.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000
 And so these are...

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.400
 So a particle accelerator, you get like an electron

00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:52.520
 and you fire it round a great big tunnel and they smash into each other.

00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:55.840
 Are they firing poos around this tunnel and smashing into each other?

00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:59.480
 The poos are not taking the place of the electrons.

00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:02.440
 No, although that would be such an awesome way to find the God Particle.

00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:05.360
 No, it would be gross.

00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:10.680
 You don't want to be the cleaner in the lab that day.

00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:13.600
 Oh, guys.

00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:16.160
 It's not messy. Don't panic. Is it like a little test tube?

00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:19.840
 So this is this really amazing new way that they found of studying

00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:23.920
 coprolites. So coprolites are fossilised feces and you can learn a lot about

00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:26.960
 the thing that pooed out millions and millions of years ago, because, you know,

00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:30.200
 it's preserved the stuff that they were eating inside it.

00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:34.600
 And we said years ago on this podcast that the only way to study a coprolite

00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:37.080
 is to cut it in half, which cut it into slices.

00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:40.920
 Now, not true anymore, because you can put it in these very specific

00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:43.480
 particle accelerators called synchrotrons.

00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:47.400
 And so there's one called the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility.

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:52.360
 And basically you put the poo in there and the electrons

00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:54.760
 are being fired round and round, around super, super fast.

00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:58.080
 And if you just slightly change the electrons' direction along the way,

00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:01.440
 they let out x-rays, but incredibly powerful x-rays.

00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:06.040
 So the x-rays are 100 billion times brighter than the ones that you'd use in a hospital.

00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:09.160
 So they see straight into the coprolite.

00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:11.240
 Or they have lots of other purposes as well.

00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:13.200
 The coprolite is one thing they do.

00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:16.120
 It does feel cheaper, though, just to cut it in half with a knife, doesn't it?

00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:19.840
 Yeah, if you don't have the budget.

00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:22.240
 But also, then you've destroyed your coprolite.

00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:24.960
 Then you've got two half-coprolites, don't you?

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:27.160
 This way you can keep the integrity of it.

00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:28.480
 That's true, yeah.

00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:31.120
 Although, as you just sort of trod on your own point, James,

00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:33.440
 because then you do have two coprolites, which does seem like it's

00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:36.760
 twice as good as having one, doesn't it, in some ways.

00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:39.400
 That's true. I've got a pizza to sell you,

00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:41.880
 which is eight slices, opposed to six slices.

00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:43.840
 Damn it.

00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:46.240
 But one person we haven't mentioned is Mary Anning,

00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:50.160
 who was one of the first people to work out what a coprolite was.

00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:55.920
 So she is these days a famous fossil collector

00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:58.600
 from the south of England.

00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:02.760
 Some people think that it's where we get she sells seashells on the seashore.

00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:05.880
 It was supposedly named after her, whether it was, we don't know.

00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:09.360
 But when you say these days, you mean she's famous these days,

00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:11.240
 not that she's a fossil collector these days.

00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:13.320
 She is herself quite close to being a fossil by now.

00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:15.320
 She is quite dead.

00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:17.080
 She is quite a dead person.

00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:19.720
 It's what she would have wanted. It's fine.

00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:22.160
 I know, I know.

00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:25.680
 She was perhaps not really appreciated in her time,

00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:27.720
 although a little bit more than you would expect,

00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:31.160
 because she works with a guy called William Buckland,

00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:34.360
 who was a very famous paleontologist.

00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:36.440
 And when he wrote his paper,

00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:40.080
 when he gave his paper to the Geological Society in London in 1829,

00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:41.760
 he did recognise her by name.

00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:45.280
 So, you know, she was kind of known in her time,

00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:48.520
 but she wasn't allowed to be part of the Geological Society

00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:50.400
 because they didn't allow women in those days.

00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:54.960
 There was the Director of the Lime Regis Museum called David Tucker.

00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:57.280
 He says that if she was born in 1970,

00:34:57.280 --> 00:35:01.520
 she'd be heading up the Paleontology Department at Imperial or Cambridge by now.

00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:04.960
 But as it was, she was just someone who collected fossils

00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:08.600
 and learned about them and kind of wrote to this guy, William Buckland.

00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:12.000
 But it was in the correspondence between these two people

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.440
 that the word "coprolite" first came into use.

00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:19.400
 And the idea that these rocks with little bits of bone and stuff

00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:21.400
 might be fossilised poos.

00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:23.720
 It does feel like Buckland could have done a bit more

00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:25.960
 to sort of give her a bit more cred,

00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:28.840
 because he did clearly get on with her really well

00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:32.760
 and took her seriously, took her ideas seriously as well.

00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:37.640
 But when these ideas were being presented to other scientists,

00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:41.880
 they even used her drawings of the dinosaurs that she sketched out,

00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:43.840
 that she found, with no mention of her name.

00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:46.800
 That was what was shown, and she got nothing.

00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:48.480
 It's pretty extraordinary.

00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:50.080
 Yeah, what was going through their heads?

00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:52.040
 Did they look at those drawings, you wonder, and think,

00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:53.840
 "Maybe I did draw that.

00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:56.160
 Maybe I did find that fossil actually."

00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:58.280
 You know, I don't remember everything I've done.

00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:01.280
 (LAUGHTER)

00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:04.280
 Because she sort of invented...

00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:07.400
 I think this is why she invented the idea of drawing or imaginings

00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:09.920
 of what these things that we found the fossils of would look like.

00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:13.920
 So the reason that we now can picture like a T-rex or a Diplodocus or whatever

00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:16.720
 is because she came up with, "Look, we've got to draw these things

00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:19.480
 so people don't understand how they appeared."

00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:22.760
 But there's a really cool thing about the drawings that she did,

00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:27.200
 which is that she drew fossils with fossils.

00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:29.880
 So she had a friend called Elizabeth Philpot,

00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:33.520
 who was another great fossil collector at the time,

00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:36.800
 and they found this Bellumknight fossil,

00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:38.880
 which I think is an extinct kind of squid,

00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:41.800
 and they found that it contained fossilized ink sacs.

00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:44.760
 So you have squid ink, squid ink sacs.

00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:46.120
 And her friend, Elizabeth Philpot,

00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:48.520
 realised that you could grind up and still make ink.

00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:51.600
 So Mary Ann Ink then used that process to grind it up,

00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:55.280
 and with this 100 million-year-old squid ink,

00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:56.800
 she drew some of her pictures.

00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:58.120
 That is amazing.

00:36:58.120 --> 00:36:59.320
 I have questions about this.

00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:00.600
 How rare are those fossils?

00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:03.400
 Because I just feel like today I wouldn't get away with that.

00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:10.120
 Just filling up your lamy pen with some 100 million-year-old fossils.

00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:11.440
 You're right.

00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:13.200
 But aside from that, she was very cool.

00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:15.000
 She was very attached to her dog,

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.360
 which very sadly died when she was out on a fossil-collecting trip.

00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:20.160
 And she wrote a sweet letter saying that...

00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:22.080
 Is she writing the dog's blood?

00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:25.640
 Yeah, she was out of fossil-collecting,

00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:27.520
 and this cliff collapsed and nearly killed her.

00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:30.480
 Basically, this huge cliff fell down inches away from her

00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:32.160
 and crushed her little dog.

00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:33.240
 Oh, no.

00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:34.720
 Sad.

00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:36.680
 Just one last thing on Mary Ann Ink.

00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:40.320
 I said about David Tucker at the Lime Regis Museum.

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:42.480
 The Lime Regis Museum,

00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:45.000
 you can go and learn some stuff about Mary Ann Ink.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.560
 And it is in the place where she was born.

00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:49.720
 That's where the museum is.

00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:53.520
 But it's a complete coincidence that it's in that same building.

00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:54.520
 No.

00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:55.640
 Yeah, they bought this place,

00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:58.360
 and they didn't realise that that was where she was born.

00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:02.000
 And it turned out that the actual area where the family lived

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.760
 has since fallen into the sea.

00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:07.760
 But it was a bit of the building that was attached to where they lived,

00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:09.760
 which is now where the museum is.

00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:12.360
 Wow. Is that the bit that squashed the dog?

00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:14.720
 Wouldn't that be a thing if that was true?

00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:15.720
 Oh, my goodness.

00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:17.400
 It sort of swings around about, you know.

00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:19.960
 We lost the dog. We've now got a seafront view.

00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:24.640
 It's so dark.

00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:29.160
 The oldest human copper light we have in existence is a Neanderthal one

00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:32.320
 from 50,000 years ago in a Spanish site.

00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:36.280
 And what I love most about it is it was on top of a hearth.

00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:38.560
 So you've got to imagine there was a fire.

00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:40.560
 They put the fire out and the guy was like,

00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:43.680
 "Just give me a second. Give me a second, lads."

00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:45.000
 "Just going to do a number two."

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:48.960
 Probably didn't wash his hands. You might know him, Dan.

00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:50.960
 And then went about his business.

00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:53.840
 I was descended.

00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:56.240
 But yeah, it's just, it's kind of wonderful.

00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:58.280
 Wow. Pooing in the fireplace.

00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:01.200
 No manners than Neanderthals. That's why they died out.

00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:02.280
 Well, did we learn about that?

00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:04.320
 Do we learn anything about that Neanderthal poo?

00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:06.120
 Like what they ate and stuff like that?

00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:10.480
 Yes. So it turns out they, obviously, they meet.

00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:13.120
 That's not surprising, but they did eat veggies,

00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:15.200
 which some people still find surprising.

00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:17.640
 I don't know why. Why would they? Why would that be weird?

00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:21.480
 But they also found a whole pile of parasites.

00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:23.120
 So, Pidworms and a whole pile of other stuff

00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:25.760
 that I think if they'd have found them in a modern human,

00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:27.880
 they would say that person would be very, very sick.

00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:30.240
 So either they were really hardy, basically,

00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:34.200
 or the poor guy was really, or woman, was really sick.

00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:37.320
 But also, I just, I kind of, I love human poo,

00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:39.160
 like coprolites because, sorry,

00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:42.160
 probably shouldn't say it like that, but it's just that,

00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:44.480
 you know, when people talk about the paleo diet,

00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:46.400
 for me, kind of people that really into the paleo diet,

00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:48.080
 there's always a bit of bouginess about it.

00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:49.560
 Don't get me wrong, I'm quite bougie as well,

00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:51.240
 but there's an element of like,

00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:53.440
 "Oh, you know, there's this like, blah, blah, blah."

00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:55.920
 And it's actually like, "Well, the real paleo diet,

00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:59.760
 these guys all had worms and they're all dead by 30, you know."

00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:01.120
 And shitting on the fire.

00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:02.960
 Exactly. Exactly.

00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:07.080
 Like, I got a kick out for this one paleo diet restaurant.

00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:09.280
 I was trying to explain to the lady in the paleo diet restaurant,

00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:12.480
 as you do as an academic, you know, just completely obnoxious.

00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:15.640
 Actually, the real paleo diet wouldn't have been the chicken breast.

00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:17.280
 It would have been all parts of the chicken.

00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:19.320
 So, are you serving chicken eyes?

00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:21.720
 And dozens of the animal?

00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:23.920
 Are you serving the poor girl?

00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:25.040
 Oh, no.

00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:30.840
 Speaking of technology being used for studying Neanderthals,

00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:35.200
 I was reading this in BBC Future and they said that in 2013,

00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:39.120
 they discovered that the genetic code for penis spines

00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:41.200
 is lacking from Neanderthals,

00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:43.520
 which means that we know in theory

00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:45.600
 that they didn't have spines on their penises.

00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:50.040
 And what that apparently shows us is that they were more monogamous

00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:52.560
 than we might have thought they were in the past,

00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:59.040
 because usually the animals with penis spines are more like people from Yemen.

00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:00.480
 They tend to have spines.

00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:03.440
 Oh, my God.

00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:05.120
 So, Dad, you're telling me?

00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:10.960
 At one point, somebody turned around and was like,

00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:14.120
 "Why don't you marry a second wife, Dr. Ashima?"

00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:16.760
 And my dad was like, "Oh, one's enough for me."

00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:21.480
 My mum's reaction was, "Ah, no, hold on. That's an insult."

00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:26.400
 I love that they can look at the genomes of these like ancient,

00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:29.840
 like long, long dead species of humans

00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:33.040
 and can tell you something as kind of weird as that,

00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:35.320
 how many sexual partners they might have had.

00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:36.680
 That's extraordinary.

00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:39.680
 So, do you mean kind of like a penis bone is what you're talking about?

00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:43.000
 No, so like animals would have spikes on their penises.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:43.840
 A lot of them do.

00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:45.480
 Spike. Sorry, I heard spine.

00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:47.240
 OK, yeah. Oh, yeah, I did say spine.

00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:49.280
 Yeah, it's all spines like spines.

00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:54.560
 And the spikes were basically clearing out previous gentlemen's stuff

00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:56.680
 that was in there using these.

00:41:56.680 --> 00:42:01.120
 Exactly, and so it's more necessary for a polyamorous species

00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:05.720
 because you're more likely to have stuff to clean out from there, so to speak.

00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:07.000
 Oh, interesting.

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.000
 So, Neanderthals were all romantics,

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.080
 monogamous romantics is what we can do.

00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:13.240
 Yeah, let's go with that, the romantics.

00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:14.640
 And I read another study.

00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:17.680
 This is from the University of California, San Diego Laboratory,

00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:21.960
 and they made some tiny brains.

00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:25.880
 They're not conscious brains, but they're kind of brain cells.

00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:30.960
 And using CRISPR, which is like the gene editing thing,

00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:35.080
 they made some that were human and some that had Neanderthal genes in them.

00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:39.440
 And the Neanderthal ones matured much quicker than the human ones did.

00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:44.160
 And what they inferred from that is that perhaps young

00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:47.240
 and Neanderthals would be more capable than younger humans.

00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:50.200
 But then perhaps the Homo sapiens, as they got older,

00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:52.600
 would have gotten better or smarter.

00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:54.520
 I don't know if any of this is true, Ella or Emma?

00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:58.800
 No, it's completely, completely true, as I would expect from you, James.

00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:01.600
 But no, yeah, they're called organoids.

00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:05.120
 That's what they made, these kind of little brain things.

00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:08.200
 And it's really interesting because it plays into this theory.

00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:10.160
 Anna, what you're saying, you know, why did they die out?

00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:14.240
 Well, there's this one theory that suggests that because we,

00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:18.520
 we, as in modern humans, Homo sapiens, have an extended juvenile period.

00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:21.680
 Basically, we don't become adults very quickly at all.

00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:24.680
 That that's given us a competitive advantage,

00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:28.760
 because it means we play and play is really good for creativity, imagination,

00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:30.200
 invention, blah, blah, blah.

00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:33.400
 And obviously, it's absolutely, it's not impossible to prove it.

00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:35.880
 But it's, I mean, it is kind of, I guess.

00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:38.680
 But it's just really interesting to think that the Neanderthals

00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:43.680
 kind of growing up so quickly might be one of the reasons why they became extinct.

00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:47.200
 But you are, you are right as well, when you say that, you know,

00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:50.920
 we kind of know a certain amount about Neanderthals from their DNA.

00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:53.960
 We know a lot about them from their DNA, including, obviously,

00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:56.880
 that all of us have about 2% Neanderthal DNA in us.

00:43:56.880 --> 00:44:00.640
 So all a wee bit Neanderthal, which is, you know, I think is really cute,

00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:02.160
 because it means they're not completely gone.

00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:03.640
 They're still with us a little bit.

00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:07.880
 Yeah, if you have more, you know how Dan is like a particularly hairy man.

00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:11.760
 Does that mean that he's more likely to have more Neanderthal in him?

00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:15.240
 Or is, does it not kind of, can you not see from the outside

00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:17.920
 how Neanderthal someone is, you have to go into the genes and.

00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:20.960
 Yeah, you have to go into the genes, because as hairy as Neanderthals,

00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:23.560
 as hairy as Neanderthal might be, as hairy as Dan might be.

00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:29.800
 Sorry, Dan, we actually, we don't actually know that Neanderthals were hairy.

00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:32.560
 That's kind of just something that got into public imagination.

00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:36.440
 But no, there's no real, how do you know what I mean?

00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:38.600
 How do you even prove that?

00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:39.600
 We don't know.

00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:41.920
 How about the fact that I keep ruining parties

00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:43.440
 by having a shit on the fireplace?

00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:48.760
 You can't blame that on your genes, sadly.

00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:58.360
 OK, it is time for fact number four, and that is James.

00:44:58.360 --> 00:45:02.160
 OK, my fact this week is that Frasier Crane was an early investor

00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:03.320
 in Microsoft.

00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:06.000
 How?

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.840
 Because one of them is real.

00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:11.520
 One of them is real, which one?

00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:13.760
 How did they cross this weird space of time?

00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:17.960
 And why did he not go with Dell, which is a far superior company?

00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:21.400
 So Frasier Crane, obviously fictional character

00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:24.600
 from the incredibly popular American sitcom, Frasier.

00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:27.040
 Microsoft, obviously a real company.

00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:31.720
 And this is a made up back story, which we found out about

00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:35.800
 because our old friend Richard Osman tweeted that he didn't

00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:38.960
 understand how Frasier could possibly afford to live in such

00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:41.600
 a nice apartment in Seattle on his wages.

00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:46.440
 And then one of the writers, Joe Keenan, replied and said

00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:49.680
 that they'd kind of talked about it in the writers' room on occasion.

00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:53.360
 And they said that they decided that he must have invested his money

00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:58.360
 from his Boston practice very wisely, perhaps in a friend's Seattle

00:45:58.360 --> 00:46:00.360
 software startup.

00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:03.880
 And we can only infer from that that the Seattle software

00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:06.960
 startup must be Microsoft because, apart from anything else,

00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:10.360
 Bill Gates was on Frasier as a character.

00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:13.440
 And in that episode, he did say he was a fan of Frasier.

00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:18.440
 So he didn't mention that Frasier had invested in his company beforehand.

00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:19.920
 But, you know, that's what I mean.

00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:21.400
 That's a bit gauche, isn't it?

00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:22.960
 You don't say that in public.

00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:23.720
 Exactly.

00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:28.400
 That's yeah, there is an episode where one of his I think it's his nephew

00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:32.040
 with someone who's coming into town and he desperately wants to get a tour

00:46:32.040 --> 00:46:36.200
 of the Microsoft offices and Frasier is desperately looking for any contact

00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:41.120
 that he has. It's just curious that as an investor, he didn't have an in.

00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:43.680
 I think what happened is that he'd sold all his shares at that point

00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:46.520
 and people had got a bit upset because it had forced the price down

00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:49.520
 and they I'm just making stuff up there.

00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:53.240
 I was like, oh, OK, yeah, yeah.

00:46:53.240 --> 00:46:56.360
 Yeah, because because you're right, because there was that it was Freddy.

00:46:56.360 --> 00:47:00.000
 So it's his son and he was trying to find somebody that knew anyone at

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:05.480
 Microsoft and then he convinced Ross to to get in contact with an ex-boyfriend.

00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:08.720
 And even when it's because this is like a mega fan talking here.

00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:13.880
 Even when Bill Gates comes in, he calls him.

00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:16.800
 It's very clear that they don't know each other very well at all.

00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:18.520
 And he calls him sir.

00:47:18.520 --> 00:47:22.120
 And I'm just saying I'm just saying I think these writers.

00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:26.520
 It might be a cover up like how probably Boris Johnson would call

00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:29.280
 James Dyson, sir, if he walked in, you know, sometimes you don't want

00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:32.360
 to be open about quite how tight you are to power.

00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:35.880
 Never know. I mean, also, I'm not part of the investor class.

00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:39.600
 So I also just don't know if you even need to know Bill Gates

00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:41.720
 to invest in Microsoft. I'm assuming maybe you don't.

00:47:41.720 --> 00:47:43.000
 Yeah, that's true, actually.

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:47.720
 If you if you were to buy some stocks in Tesla, you don't have to have

00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:51.520
 an interview with Elon Musk beforehand to make sure he's a friend.

00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:53.840
 Probably a good thing.

00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:55.760
 You know, they're rebooting.

00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:58.400
 Yeah, are they? Yeah, yeah.

00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:00.280
 I now feel like I'm going to have to go back and watch it all

00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:03.280
 from the start, because I've just seen it very sporadically.

00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:05.600
 Well, you should actually start from Cheers and properly

00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:07.320
 watch his character development.

00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:08.680
 It's like delicious.

00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:11.360
 Well, that's so we should say this is the most interesting

00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:15.360
 thing about Frasier is that it's a spin off series of one of the other

00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:18.600
 most popular American sitcoms of all time, Cheers.

00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:21.440
 And he was a character who just came in and sat at the bar.

00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:24.360
 He was only meant to be in for a few episodes, but he proved to be

00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:28.080
 so popular with audiences that they wrote him into the series more and more.

00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:31.240
 And eventually when they ended, they thought, what are we going to do next

00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:34.480
 as a team? And Frasier was this spin off.

00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:37.400
 You know, that happened a couple of times.

00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:41.320
 Does it not even used to annoy me when I was younger that it felt like

00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:44.240
 there was a disconnect between his character there and then his character

00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:47.440
 in Frasier or it was like kind of confusing to my young head.

00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:49.400
 I was like, how is that the same person?

00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:54.200
 And he seems a bit different and there is lots of inconsistency as a superfan,

00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:56.360
 which must stress you out, Ella, surely.

00:48:56.360 --> 00:48:59.320
 Like, I think his it's mentioned that he has a horrible relationship

00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:01.720
 with his dad or something in Cheers though.

00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:03.960
 Actually, I think still does.

00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:06.360
 I think in Cheers, they said that his father was dead.

00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:12.320
 Yes. And then another character from Cheers came to visit him in the in

00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:13.920
 the second sitcom.

00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:15.680
 He said, I thought you said your father was dead.

00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:17.480
 And he said, oh, we were fighting.

00:49:17.480 --> 00:49:19.920
 So that's how they taught that I see.

00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:21.240
 Clever, good luck.

00:49:21.240 --> 00:49:22.440
 They do a few things like that.

00:49:22.440 --> 00:49:29.520
 Yeah. So the Cheers was set in Boston and they wanted to have this new sitcom,

00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:32.280
 but they didn't want it to be too close to Boston because then you would have

00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:35.760
 to deal with all the previous characters and you would have to explain

00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:37.120
 why they're not there, et cetera.

00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:40.000
 But if you move to the other side of the country, you can get away with it.

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.080
 So they're going to move to Denver, Colorado.

00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:47.000
 But then in 1992, there was a group called Colorado for Family Values

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:52.400
 that pushed an amendment, which was described by the writers of Cheers

00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:57.120
 as an egregious anti-gay amendment, which was basically stopping any gay rights

00:49:57.120 --> 00:49:58.600
 in Colorado.

00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:02.760
 And if you read the newspapers from the time, it was a huge, huge, huge deal.

00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:05.560
 A load of films stopped being filmed there.

00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:08.680
 They were going to do a Stephen King movie there and they didn't do it in Colorado.

00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:12.120
 And then David Lee, who was one of the show's creators, said that they were going

00:50:12.120 --> 00:50:15.240
 to do they were going to put Fraser in Colorado in Denver,

00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:19.000
 but they had to move it away from there because they didn't want to be associated

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:20.680
 with this anti-gay amendment.

00:50:20.680 --> 00:50:26.680
 And then in 1996, four years later, the US Supreme Court declared it was unconstitutional.

00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:30.120
 So it got kicked out anyway, but they lost all of this kind of investment

00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:33.880
 and all of these shows and stuff just refused to go to Colorado.

00:50:33.880 --> 00:50:36.520
 In your face, Colorado, that's what you get.

00:50:36.520 --> 00:50:41.120
 Because I feel like I know the space needle now because of because of Fraser.

00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:42.760
 Yes. Yeah.

00:50:42.760 --> 00:50:45.640
 But they all did cameo in Fraser at times, didn't they?

00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:50.680
 Except one main Cheers character who was Rebecca, who actually

00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:53.200
 was probably maybe the most annoying Cheers character anyway, I think,

00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:56.760
 from what I vaguely remember, but she never guested in Fraser.

00:50:56.760 --> 00:51:00.000
 And it was an actress who is called Kirstie Alley.

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:04.600
 And she said that she turned it down because as a Scientologist,

00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:08.200
 her beliefs forbid things like psychiatry.

00:51:08.200 --> 00:51:11.640
 So Scientologists are very anti-psychiatry, which I didn't realize.

00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:12.640
 How interesting.

00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:15.120
 Yeah. Although she did give an interview saying this.

00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:18.720
 And then the show creator, David Lee, said, I don't remember asking her.

00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:24.120
 I mean, she was a big deal.

00:51:24.120 --> 00:51:25.320
 She would have been asked at some point.

00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:27.280
 She would have been asked. Yeah.

00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:31.200
 You know, Kelsey Grammer in that show, quite a fascinating story

00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:35.640
 of how he went from being this character that was just a normal actor.

00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:38.480
 And it happens in these sitcoms where the actor becomes

00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:40.360
 the biggest part of the show generally.

00:51:40.360 --> 00:51:41.520
 They become an exec producer.

00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:42.560
 They start directing.

00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:46.520
 They start his power grew so great as he was going on that he could start

00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:49.760
 pulling these power moves, which felt really bizarre.

00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:54.400
 So one of the things was he employed an acting method that he called requisite

00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:59.280
 disrespect. And the thing was, is that he said he would rehearse each scene

00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:04.000
 only once and he would not learn his lines until the moments before

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:05.200
 the scene was shot.

00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:09.240
 And in some cases go, OK, I'll do it better and not even use the lines.

00:52:09.240 --> 00:52:14.160
 He said he'd played the role so long that he could now embody any kind

00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:16.960
 of remark that would come out of Fraser better than a script writer

00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:18.960
 and just became Fraser Crane himself.

00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:21.560
 I'll just say whatever I want to say in this show now.

00:52:21.560 --> 00:52:23.520
 That's kind of, you know, it works.

00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:29.040
 The best actor in Fraser, of course, was Moose, who played the dog, Eddie.

00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:35.160
 And he retired at the end of season seven and his son, Enzo, took over the role.

00:52:35.160 --> 00:52:39.080
 But what I find interesting about that is Moose had been deliberately

00:52:39.080 --> 00:52:44.480
 bred to create a new child, which would look enough like him that they would

00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:48.160
 be able to bring him in when he retired, which I think is just a really

00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:50.960
 interesting idea of imagine that happened with humans that you were

00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:54.880
 you're an actor in a show and they're like, OK, we're going to find someone

00:52:54.880 --> 00:52:59.080
 for you to mate with who looks the right kind of person that when you have kids,

00:52:59.080 --> 00:53:01.200
 they'll be able to come up and take your place.

00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:03.400
 Well, and they cocked it up a bit, didn't they?

00:53:03.400 --> 00:53:06.400
 Because they had to paint Enzo's fur to match his dad.

00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:08.400
 Didn't quite nail the patterns.

00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:10.880
 They didn't. And also, they hated each other.

00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:12.400
 The father and son.

00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:17.520
 Father and son, the creator, Peter Casey, called their relationship

00:53:17.520 --> 00:53:19.920
 a classic parent-child Hollywood rivalry.

00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:22.880
 By all accounts, Moose was horrible.

00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:25.040
 So Eddie, quite lovable on the show.

00:53:25.040 --> 00:53:27.120
 Moose was like, bitey.

00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:30.400
 Everyone hated him like the trainer didn't like anyone else on set

00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:31.960
 and really hated his son.

00:53:31.960 --> 00:53:33.800
 Enzo, they had to be kept apart.

00:53:33.800 --> 00:53:38.920
 Do you think they were basically mirroring the Frasier and his father's relationship?

00:53:38.920 --> 00:53:42.120
 Oh, I hope there's a behind the scenes documentary

00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:45.080
 where it's from their perspective, bickering at each other.

00:53:45.080 --> 00:53:47.720
 And you've just got Frasier and the dad in the background.

00:53:47.720 --> 00:53:51.640
 Well, didn't the dad actually adopt?

00:53:51.640 --> 00:53:52.920
 Didn't he adopt?

00:53:52.920 --> 00:53:54.320
 I think Ross did.

00:53:54.320 --> 00:53:56.520
 The actor who played Ross, Perry Gilpin.

00:53:56.520 --> 00:53:58.240
 Yeah. Yeah. Right.

00:53:58.240 --> 00:54:03.760
 My favourite fact about Frasier is that the pilot was six minutes too long.

00:54:03.880 --> 00:54:05.240
 And they chopped and chopped and chopped.

00:54:05.240 --> 00:54:09.160
 And finally they had a pilot that ended up a 60 seconds longer

00:54:09.160 --> 00:54:11.600
 than it should have been for the slot.

00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:15.320
 So they handed it in and they said, we're sorry, we just can't do anything.

00:54:15.320 --> 00:54:17.320
 It's 60 seconds too long.

00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:21.760
 And amazingly, the network went, OK, so NBC agreed with it.

00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:26.920
 And they found extra time by taking 15 seconds of four other shows

00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:29.360
 that were airing that night.

00:54:29.360 --> 00:54:32.160
 That's how you know you're the favourite of the night.

00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:36.000
 Are you saying like if you remember that one episode of like Party of Five

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:39.800
 where it ends really abruptly, that was probably the night that Frasier went out.

00:54:39.800 --> 00:54:43.840
 You remember that game of basketball where it was all tied up with 50 seconds left?

00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:49.440
 Lisa Kudrow, who plays Phoebe in Friends,

00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:55.200
 actually had the job of Ross initially and got fired before they even really started.

00:54:55.200 --> 00:54:58.160
 And you're saying Ross, not Ross, aren't you?

00:54:58.160 --> 00:55:00.240
 Because for Lisa Kudrow, she cast as Ross.

00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:05.440
 We're talking about a random factor suddenly throw in Ella.

00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:08.440
 We're talking about Frasier here. Come on.

00:55:08.440 --> 00:55:11.000
 Sorry, Ross, that was supposed to be Lisa Kudrow.

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:14.400
 It was Lisa Kudrow and then she got fired.

00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:19.120
 And you can imagine like she has stories about how people were so shocked

00:55:19.120 --> 00:55:22.840
 that she got fired from this massive show that they were like looking at her like,

00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:24.240
 oh, we are so sorry.

00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:26.720
 Like she just she wanted to just die basically.

00:55:26.720 --> 00:55:28.440
 She fell her feet in the end.

00:55:28.440 --> 00:55:32.120
 Right. She went to a fortune teller who was like, it's OK.

00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:33.560
 I see big things for you.

00:55:33.560 --> 00:55:36.160
 And if I was like, it's absolutely bullshit, Lisa, your career is over.

00:55:36.160 --> 00:55:41.480
 And then. Well, she said that she she was so depressed.

00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:45.280
 I think that day or that kind of in those few days, she went to a party

00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:50.120
 and she she was just like, oh, this is so I'm so past it.

00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:51.160
 I've got nothing else.

00:55:51.160 --> 00:55:52.720
 And she sees this cute guy.

00:55:52.720 --> 00:55:54.000
 She just goes, why not?

00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:55.600
 Nothing else is who cares?

00:55:55.600 --> 00:55:57.440
 I'm just going to go hit on him and she ended up marrying him.

00:55:57.920 --> 00:56:02.480
 So it's really it's kind of a woman who's just managed to make it all work for her

00:56:02.480 --> 00:56:04.440
 from from being, you know, fired.

00:56:04.440 --> 00:56:06.600
 It's amazing what Scientology can do, isn't it?

00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:08.640
 No, no, no, no.

00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:10.600
 No, this is Lisa Kudrow.

00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:12.680
 Lisa Kudrow is like a nice Jewish girl.

00:56:12.680 --> 00:56:16.200
 Hey, question.

00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:20.000
 Which actor in Frasier is from Manchester?

00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:24.640
 Oh, well, Jay Leaves, Jay Leaves, the British one.

00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:26.840
 Incorrect.

00:56:26.840 --> 00:56:29.360
 So devastated to learn this.

00:56:29.360 --> 00:56:30.200
 She's not.

00:56:30.200 --> 00:56:33.560
 I think she grew up in East Grinstead, which is very much the south of England.

00:56:33.560 --> 00:56:35.040
 And I'm a Scientology.

00:56:35.040 --> 00:56:38.240
 So I guess the alley.

00:56:38.240 --> 00:56:40.760
 Stop picking everyone up Frasier Scientologist.

00:56:40.760 --> 00:56:44.160
 Really, I'm saying it's a broad church.

00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:46.280
 No, so she was asked to do that accent.

00:56:46.280 --> 00:56:47.640
 That wasn't a real accent.

00:56:47.640 --> 00:56:48.760
 And she's from there.

00:56:48.760 --> 00:56:52.640
 But John Mahoney, who plays Martin, the dad is from Manchester.

00:56:52.640 --> 00:56:55.800
 So he was born in Blackpool, but his family were from Manchester.

00:56:55.960 --> 00:56:59.080
 And he was schooled, schooled and raised in Manchester.

00:56:59.080 --> 00:57:00.200
 Isn't that weird?

00:57:00.200 --> 00:57:04.000
 Yeah, you know how we all used to really kind of laugh at her accent

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:07.440
 being a Mancunian accent, because it was just really weird accent.

00:57:07.440 --> 00:57:10.960
 I caught a clip of her once, kind of, where somebody very politely

00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:14.120
 on one of the English morning shows was like, your accent's not really.

00:57:14.120 --> 00:57:15.400
 Like, it was, you know, it was a dig.

00:57:15.400 --> 00:57:17.800
 But, you know, it was morning television, so they were trying to be polite.

00:57:17.800 --> 00:57:21.480
 And you could tell that she was very aware of it and kind of a bit

00:57:21.480 --> 00:57:22.520
 like stressed about it.

00:57:22.520 --> 00:57:25.280
 And she kind of said, well, you know, I was told that the

00:57:25.280 --> 00:57:29.360
 the the actual accent that I had was too, it was too strong

00:57:29.360 --> 00:57:32.040
 and the Americans wouldn't, you know, understand it.

00:57:32.040 --> 00:57:34.840
 So the actual Mancunian accent was, was, you know,

00:57:34.840 --> 00:57:36.840
 considered to be inappropriate or something.

00:57:36.840 --> 00:57:38.320
 Oh, yes. I read that.

00:57:38.320 --> 00:57:42.560
 She was trained to do a relatable to the Americans Mancunian version.

00:57:42.560 --> 00:57:46.560
 Or that's what she's claiming.

00:57:46.560 --> 00:57:49.760
 I thought I'd read that she, her character was living in America

00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:52.840
 for so long at that point, that she had a kind of transatlantic

00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:58.400
 drool that had seeped into the Mancunian accent and had distorted it.

00:57:58.400 --> 00:58:01.400
 She's all sorts of excuses, isn't she?

00:58:01.400 --> 00:58:03.640
 It's like worse than your accent.

00:58:03.640 --> 00:58:06.640
 Like, it's like there's there's like.

00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:08.640
 I mean, I assume you're talking to me.

00:58:08.640 --> 00:58:10.240
 Sorry.

00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:13.040
 Well, actually, well, for any Americans listening,

00:58:13.040 --> 00:58:14.920
 like I'm from just outside Manchester,

00:58:14.920 --> 00:58:17.440
 so she should have an accent that's a bit like mine.

00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:20.240
 Instead, it's a bit Yorkshire and then just weird.

00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:21.640
 It's a bit, God knows.

00:58:21.640 --> 00:58:24.760
 It's just too many things.

00:58:24.760 --> 00:58:26.760
 It's lovable, which is all that matters.

00:58:26.760 --> 00:58:29.320
 A lovable accent.

00:58:29.320 --> 00:58:32.040
 I read a quote from David Hyde Pierce, who plays Niles,

00:58:32.040 --> 00:58:34.920
 who said, "To me, Jane is in Jane, Jane leaves.

00:58:34.920 --> 00:58:37.160
 To me, Jane and Daphne were identical,

00:58:37.160 --> 00:58:39.680
 exquisite and charming with fragrant hair

00:58:39.680 --> 00:58:42.040
 that smelled like puppies, springtime and sex."

00:58:42.040 --> 00:58:44.000
 Wow.

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:45.600
 That's what I'm saying, he's gay.

00:58:45.600 --> 00:58:47.880
 Yeah, exactly.

00:58:47.880 --> 00:58:50.720
 It's OK, because he is gay, but otherwise it wouldn't be.

00:58:51.280 --> 00:58:53.240
 I have to say that's a show that's aged really well.

00:58:53.240 --> 00:58:56.920
 You know, a lot of the shows from that period

00:58:56.920 --> 00:58:59.280
 are a lot of kind of issues that you just,

00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:01.880
 jokes that you just wouldn't be able to get away with now.

00:59:01.880 --> 00:59:05.000
 That's one of those shows that's aged really well,

00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:08.920
 because the joke is always on whoever is being, you know, the...

00:59:08.920 --> 00:59:12.680
 Oh, it's basically, it's never on.

00:59:12.680 --> 00:59:15.800
 So it's unlike a lot of the other shows of its time.

00:59:15.800 --> 00:59:17.400
 Yeah, take that, Lisa Kudrow.

00:59:19.400 --> 00:59:21.480
 I might have made the wrong choice there.

00:59:21.480 --> 00:59:24.240
 OK, that's it.

00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:25.360
 That is all of our facts.

00:59:25.360 --> 00:59:26.960
