00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 Hello and welcome to an extra special edition of No Such Thing as a Fish. This time we are celebrating the release of our new book, The Book of the Year 2019, The World Weirdest News.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, Anich Zinski, and James Harkin, and once again we have gathered around the table with our four favorite facts from our new book, which is out now, and in no particular order, here we go, starting with you, James.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 Okay, my fact from the Book of the Year 2019, The World's Weirdest News, is that Greta Thunberg's middle name is Tintin.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 Isn't that great? Now, you can argue this isn't technically true, because we opened on this one, immediate climb down.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 Well, she has five names in total, and Tintin is the second one. I call it middle name, so she is called Greta Tintin, Eleanor-Ernman Thunberg.

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 That's an incredibly professional way of a view to caveat that fact, James, because any other person would have just said her middle name is Tintin, that's fine, but you said we'll technically as one outside her middle name, but it's not a first or a surname.

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 We kept editing that sentence out of the actual book, though, in the end.

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 I reckon that any name, which is not your first name, or your surname, is technically a middle name.

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 Definitely, yeah, absolutely.

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 Agreed, like if you're in a family of ten people, and you're the ninth child, you say you're one of the middle siblings, don't you?

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 Sure.

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 I think you only get to single yourself out until the first name or the surname.

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 I would tell you it was the penultimate child.

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 You do, don't you? You're an only child, which is bizarre.

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 She's not the only person with a fun middle name to appear in our book, just very quickly.

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 Lucy Bronze, the footballer for the England football team. Her middle name is Tough.

24
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 Yeah, very cool. It's a great middle name.

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 Tough Bronze, that's good.

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 But why is Greta Thunberg's middle name Tintin? Do we know?

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 I don't know, actually. I can only assume her parents were fans.

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 Or she has a white dog.

29
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 She could, although she wouldn't have had it when she was born.

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 No, you're right.

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 I have no other Tintin references, so I can't think of any other reason.

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 She's a sort of young adventurer going around the world, having adventures.

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 That's true, that's true.

34
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 But she wasn't when she was born.

35
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 No, again, no, you're right.

36
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 She is still very young to be adventuring, though, isn't she?

37
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 I'm always surprised that she's 16 still, I think.

38
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 She's amazing.

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 And she's currently, so she took this trip to the US

40
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 and then going on to Chile to attend these conferences.

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 And she's still, as we speak, traveling down through the US on her way to Chile.

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 And I don't know who she's with, does she have any parental guidance?

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 I think is it not true that if you're traveling under the age of 18,

44
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 your parents can drop you off and then someone can pick you up at the airport

45
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 and actually you're fine. I think that's probably what she's doing.

46
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 Yes.

47
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 Should we just quickly say--

48
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 She has to do that, by the way.

49
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 She's definitely would never go by airplane anywhere.

50
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 No, absolutely.

51
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 I was just going to say, we should say, there might be a few people out there

52
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 who genuinely don't know who Greta Thumburg is.

53
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 She's one of the biggest names of the year, but the way women talking about it

54
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 sounds like she's an adventurer.

55
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 She's the environmentalist campaigner who has been causing huge storms of the good kind.

56
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 No, in climate change, which is causing the huge storms.

57
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 She's trying to fight storms wherever she goes.

58
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 She started off sitting outside.

59
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 Was it a Swedish parliament building?

60
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 It's a Swedish Reichstag, yeah.

61
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 Yeah, and she was skipping school to do that.

62
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 And that turned into the huge school strike movement.

63
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 But her initial leaflets that she handed out said,

64
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 "I am doing this because you adults are shitting on my future."

65
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 Which is a great phrase.

66
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 It is.

67
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 Terrible misbehavior. So she's skived school and then used foul language to abuse strangers.

68
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 Okay, you have to stop reading the telegram.

69
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 No, she is great.

70
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 And she learned what were the biggest climate protests in all history.

71
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 So I think in the space of one month, she led two which were attended by four million people.

72
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 She's just extraordinary.

73
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 Amazing.

74
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 Do you think they'll look back?

75
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 We look back now at Joan of Arc, who was 14 years old or something,

76
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 who can't believe that she managed to have the whole of a French army behind her.

77
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 But now there's this 16-year-old who's got four million more than that.

78
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 Let's be honest, people behind her is just insane.

79
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 But Greta Thunberg isn't using those people to throw the English out of France.

80
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 We should say that.

81
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 There's been a lot of stuff thrown around about her.

82
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 There is one conspiracy, this is a very mad conspiracy theory about her,

83
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 that says she's actually an Australian actress called Estella Renee,

84
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 who is working for the Deep State.

85
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 It's not clear why the Deep State would be amazing.

86
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 If you looked back at all the episodes of Neighbours and she just popped up.

87
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 Do you know the foundation for this rumor?

88
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 No.

89
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 Cool.

90
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 Incredibly weird people on the internet.

91
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 It's really, really like her.

92
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 Because we know who her parents are, we know where she was born.

93
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 The records of her all the way through.

94
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 I wasn't suggesting it might be true.

95
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 I just wondered if there was any logic to it.

96
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 Maybe someone thought she had a tan that maybe she'd got from Australia.

97
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 I believe you Andy, Thunberg.

98
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 Well, there is another one which is, it's slightly less mad, but it's still completely mad if you know what I mean.

99
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 Which is that she's got an IMDB page and she's listed as an actress because she wants to devise over.

100
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 So that's the evidence for some people saying that she's therefore not real.

101
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 Well, her mum was in the arts, wasn't she?

102
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 She was a performer of some sort.

103
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 Yeah, opera singer.

104
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 Yeah, so that makes sense.

105
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 You might have your child appear in something at a young age without their consent.

106
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 I think it's a climate thing that she did a voiceover for, actually.

107
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 Oh, I mean, Donald Trump is listed as an actor on IMDB.

108
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 So being on IMDB does not mean that you're not a person.

109
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 Well, he is. No, he is though.

110
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 He was in home alone too.

111
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 Yeah.

112
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 Oh, yeah.

113
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 Classic scene.

114
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 He's an actor.

115
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 He's an actor.

116
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 He was brilliant in that.

117
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 And I thought, no, I don't think I haven't seen it.

118
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 Yeah, her mother.

119
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 It's quite interesting.

120
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 Her mother's a woman called Malena Ernman.

121
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 And she was a famous opera singer.

122
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 A really famous opera singer in Sweden.

123
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 And she gave it up because of Greta.

124
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 So Greta convinced her to cancel her entire career

125
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 because all the international travel so bad for the environment.

126
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 Oh, the travel.

127
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 I was thinking like, because you do so much singing and you're kind of breathing a lot.

128
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 All the carbon dioxide that comes out.

129
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 Yeah.

130
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 That's what I was thinking about, yeah.

131
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 I read this as a bit of a...

132
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 It must be very hard trying to get everything right when you're trying to do your best to stop a carbon footprint.

133
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 So her going across to America and a boat.

134
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 I read that, unfortunately, in order to get the boat back, they had to fly out to the boat pilots to America in order to bring it back.

135
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 They could have just sent them off in another boat.

136
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 Exactly.

137
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 Why weren't they in the boat?

138
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 What's going on?

139
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 Where were they?

140
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 They did.

141
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 But they said in response to that that their whole flight was carbon neutral.

142
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 So they, you know, what's the problem?

143
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 You can't...

144
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 They offset the carbon of that.

145
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 It's tricky though, because offsetting is a thing which some people say doesn't really work.

146
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 You can't really suck up carbon in the same way that...

147
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 I think the argument mostly is that by doing it, people think that it's okay to fly.

148
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 Right.

149
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 And so if you think, oh, I'm going to offset it, then you might be more inclined to do more short-haul flying.

150
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 Yeah.

151
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 The protests, the environmental protests have been pretty interesting.

152
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 There was a really good fact that one of you guys found, I think,

153
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 which is that the levels of pollution on Oxford Street fell by 45% due to the extinction rebellion protests

154
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 because they stopped all of the cars going there.

155
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 Which is really cool.

156
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 That's very cool.

157
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 That's very cool.

158
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 That's like immediate action.

159
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 And also, I found this protest in Australia, which was pretty cool.

160
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 It was on Manly Beach near Sydney.

161
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 And 150 protestors buried their heads in the sand.

162
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 That's a great protest.

163
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 That's a great protest.

164
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 The pictures are amazing.

165
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 That's great.

166
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 They look like they're praying, you know, they're right on the knees with their heads down and stuff like that.

167
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 That's very funny.

168
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 Did they have guards to stop people just running around kicking them all up the ass one after the other?

169
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 I didn't see him.

170
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 I support the protests.

171
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 I just want to make it clear.

172
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 But we didn't assume you didn't.

173
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 We did when he implied that he was going to ride along the beach of protestors kicking them all in the ass.

174
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 I think the implication was you just bought the protest.

175
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 But if you see a big row of asses in the air, you have to kick them.

176
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 You got it.

177
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 Yeah, that's where I went.

178
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 You could play them like bongos.

179
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 You could play them like bongos.

180
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 It's not quite as violent, but it's still funny.

181
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 One of the first things Extinction Rebellion did was to occupy the offices of, guess where?

182
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 So was it in Sweden?

183
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 No, I think it was here actually.

184
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 It was in the offices of Shell.

185
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 It was Greenpeace.

186
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 Was it?

187
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 Yeah.

188
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 They handed out flowers, but they also gave out leaflets saying we're going to be much more assertive about this than you guys have been.

189
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 Wow.

190
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 Greenpeace didn't do their share of, you know, start protests and things.

191
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 Yeah, yeah.

192
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 But Extinction Rebellion was just, you know, marking their territory.

193
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 God, I think of Greenpeace as quite assertive.

194
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 They did as well.

195
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 They also had this thing in July where hundreds of environmental climate demonstrators picketed the headquarters of Drax.

196
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 And that's Drax as a big energy and gas giant.

197
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 And they were picketing them over a new gas power plant that they were planning in Yorkshire, I think.

198
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 Anyway, they hadn't done the research.

199
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 Drax moved out of that building over a year ago.

200
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 And they instead chain themselves to this block in more gate, which is now occupied by Europe's leading renewables generator.

201
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 You can't win them all.

202
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 I love the headline that we actually have for the Extinction Rebellion article in our book is a woman glued her breasts to the road to protest against climate change.

203
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 And this was just the most wonderful, the glue.

204
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 It was just fantastic.

205
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 They were gluing their bumps to the windows and the Westminster.

206
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 They were gluing themselves on streets.

207
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 They were a guy did it on top of a plane the other day.

208
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 Did you see that?

209
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 Well, glued himself on top of a plane.

210
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 It's part of this new Extinction Rebellion sort of revival.

211
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 He was getting on a plane from the steps on the outside and he climbed on top and he glued himself to the top.

212
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 And so, yeah, disrupted this flight.

213
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 That is amazing.

214
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 There's a bit of me that wished that they just pranked him, just closed the door and started heading back.

215
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 I'm really behind the plane trying to kick it in the ass.

216
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 I just wanna say I do support the whole thing.

217
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 Thank you.

218
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 There were the people who glued themselves to Corbin's house weren't there.

219
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 I think it was four protestors.

220
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 Glue themselves outside Jeremy Corbin's home.

221
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 But, you know, a lot of these people are very nice people, the climate protestors.

222
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 So, they admitted they felt absolutely terrible about upsetting his wife who was indoors at the time.

223
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 And they had flowers and Easter eggs delivered to the house to apologise for the inconvenience.

224
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 I think, sort of, while they were still glued, I think maybe one of them with their toes dialed the flowers and the grease surface or something.

225
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 One protestor was arrested while dressed as some broccoli.

226
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 Oh, great job.

227
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 He looks very, very good.

228
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 Because they've been very creative with the costumes and everything.

229
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 And as he was arrested, he was heard to be shouting either give peace a chance or give peace a chance.

230
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 They're not clear which he was shouting.

231
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 Right.

232
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 And why was he broccoli then?

233
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 Because broccoli is good for you.

234
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 You should eat less meat.

235
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 You know, this kind of stuff.

236
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 Yeah, it's green.

237
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 It's green.

238
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 Just as a peep, if that's going to be your line.

239
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 What about broccoli fossil fuels in the ground?

240
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 Very nice.

241
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 He could have done with you.

242
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 But I do support what he did.

243
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 Just can I just say my favourite group of people who are protesting climate change is drug users and drug dealers with them.

244
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 So, this was the news this year.

245
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 This is in our book that cocaine is now being sold in environmentally friendly pods.

246
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 This was a interview that was done, I think in the Birmingham mail, the Birmingham post and they interviewed a drug user who said that he thought this dealer was joking when he gave him a reusable container with this cocaine in it.

247
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 He was like, what on earth is that mate?

248
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 And the dealer said, basically, we're not using the plastic zip lock bags anymore.

249
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 We are using these reusable ones.

250
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 And if you want a refill of cocaine, you're going to have to bring back your reusable container.

251
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 You know what, I'm going to take it up again.

252
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 That was always a deal breaker for me.

253
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 And finally, they could have just introduced a 5P charge for a small plastic container.

254
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 That would have been a waste.

255
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is Andy.

256
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 My fact is that you can now be pulled over for drink driving by your own car.

257
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 Where did you read this fact, Andy?

258
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 Did you read it in a book?

259
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 Oh yeah, sorry, I read it in the book, no, I wrote it in the book of the year.

260
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 In the world's weirdest news.

261
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 You've read it since, though, right?

262
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 Of course, it's my bedside reading.

263
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 Sorry, just check. I just wanted the citation in there.

264
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 What an aggressive and unhelpful talk for a fact.

265
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 Sorry.

266
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 I'm so sorry.

267
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 I read it on a newspaper website probably and then I wrote it down in the book that we've all just written between us.

268
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 Sorry, what's that book?

269
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 It's called the book of the year 2019, the world's weirdest news.

270
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 Right.

271
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 The title wins it out.

272
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 No, Andy, no.

273
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 It's out now.

274
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 Andy, he missed the point of this podcast.

275
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 We're just trying to get you to say the name of the book.

276
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 Got it, it's out now.

277
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 Okay, so anyway, Volvo have developed this car or they have announced they are developing a car

278
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 which can tell you off for drink driving if it detects that you're drunk.

279
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 Sorry, it just tells you off.

280
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 It doesn't make you stop or anything.

281
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 It just tells you naughty boy.

282
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 I think it actually can pull over to the side of the road. It's still in development so this is not a standard in new Volvo's that you buy.

283
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 But I think it detects from the way you're driving.

284
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 If you're driving very very very drunkingly.

285
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 Well, if for instance, not saying I'm like this, but what if you're just a very bad driver?

286
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 You'll never drive again, I'm afraid.

287
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 Even if I'm sober.

288
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 I'm afraid not, no.

289
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 Actually, a bit better after a few trips. Can I just say that? You don't support the drunk drivers.

290
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 That's very clever. So it was a car that detects if you've driven through your own kitchen window or something.

291
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 Volvo also had some other interesting technology that it announced this year, didn't it?

292
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 And that was that it's cars will warn each other if you're driving on icy roads.

293
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 So cool.

294
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 I believe this is certain development, but yeah, it'll be automatic detection. If you're on an icy road and your car detects sort of a lack of friction,

295
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 it will tell all the other Volvo's nearby so the people driving them will get warnings.

296
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 And if you don't drive a Volvo, then I guess you're boggled.

297
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 That's very cool.

298
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 Well, we're doing an advert for Volvo.

299
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 The great thing about Volvo, I always thought, was the fact that they invented the seat belt.

300
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 Right? The modern seat belt that we have, which is kind of a 3.1.

301
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 It kind of comes across your chest and your waist. They invented it and they never patented it.

302
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 So it meant that everyone could use it for free because they realized that it was so good for safety,

303
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 that it would be better to be in every car and they didn't want the money for it.

304
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 But one thing that they are working on at the moment is a self-driving car seat belt.

305
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 Okay, because when you're in your self-driving car, you're probably not going to want to sit there at the front looking out of the windscreen.

306
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 You might want to be having a lie down or you might want to be playing video games or something like that.

307
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 And so they have come up with a seat belt blanket.

308
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 So you kind of lie down or kind of lounge a little bit.

309
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 And then the strap goes across your whole body, about cross your legs, across your chest and everything like that.

310
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 But it's not like you have been strapped down because you're in a hospital or something like that.

311
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 Because you're making yourself like you're sort of mummified into the car. It's not quite that. It's supposed to not feel restrictive, but it does kind of cocoon you.

312
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 That's brilliant. That's a new thing that they're working on.

313
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 That's very cool.

314
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 When you set a self-driving seat belt, I thought it was, if you'd driven off without your seat belt, your seat belt at home would remember.

315
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 And it would drive out to the car and catch up with you and then get into the car.

316
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 I've got another car development thing here. It's not Volvo.

317
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 Well, I'm not interested. I know. I stupidly took a sponsorship from Ford, which are fantastic cars.

318
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 But this year, and this is in our robot's article, Ford have developed a robotic bottom, which they test on their car seats.

319
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 So this is the idea of testing for wear and tear in your car seats.

320
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 Have that for a while, haven't they?

321
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 Yes, they have. But what they've added to it this year, this is the 2019 edition, it now has sweat glands so it can mimic the behavior of someone with a very sweaty bottom.

322
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 You know, you're driving on a hot day, and you've taken your trousers off to drive, as I always do.

323
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 But the self-driving trousers are on the way. They're getting there eventually.

324
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 That's, I think, that's a real shame because you're putting a lot of real life human bottom testers out of work, aren't you?

325
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 That's very, very, very sad.

326
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 No, but it's a thing that's dealing with the real issue. Why don't they just find people with sweaty bottoms?

327
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 That's what I'm saying.

328
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 Oh, gotcha.

329
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 I remember when I was at school and they were trying to me what kind of job I might have in the future.

330
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 And they did check how sweaty my bottom was, and they did think I would be able to do this.

331
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 I think that has been reported to the authorities, actually.

332
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 Just because this is about sort of new robotics technology, such as new robotics.

333
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 One of my favourite stories in the book was the extreme advance in shoes, which is that Nike has invented self-lacing trainers.

334
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 Wow, man. So these trainers are $300. They fit your foot shape automatically.

335
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 So you try them on, they fit any foot shape. They're self-lacing, so they don't actually have laces because the robots don't need laces.

336
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 They just tighten and loosen automatically.

337
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 And the idea is that it would be good in something like basketball where sometimes you need some looseness for flexibility to increase blood flow.

338
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 Then sometimes you need it to tighten up when you need more grip.

339
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 And the problem is it's a total failure on Android phones.

340
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 So people tried it on Android's and it often broke after a few days.

341
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 There were complaints that it only worked on the right shoe.

342
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 So for some reason, the left shoes just constantly weren't responding.

343
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 And often the app would also say it's already connected to another pair of trainers.

344
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 So can you just make people fall over as they're walking by you?

345
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 I guess so.

346
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 Because you connect your app to their shoes. That's like the modern equivalent of time someone shoelaces together.

347
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 Yes. Speaking of as we were self-driving things, there is a self-driving wheelie bin that has been developed this year.

348
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 It's called SmartCan. And the SmartCan creator who is called Andrew Murray.

349
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 No. Yes. Wow.

350
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 He said we want to help people eliminate unnecessary chores from their daily lives.

351
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 And what happens is basically when it's been day, the bins take themselves out.

352
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 Isn't that great?

353
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 That's really amazing. So it's not a thing where if you can't afford a self-driving car,

354
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 but you can't afford a self-driving bin, it's getting the bin to go to work.

355
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 It's not like Trilipair of My Holes in it.

356
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 My other car is a SmartCan.

357
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 There's other car technology.

358
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 So there's a great company Ford who have designed...

359
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 Give it a rest mate. The car in front is a Toyota.

360
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 They've developed something not for cars, but for the bedroom.

361
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 And this is in our book. It's a mattress that nudges you away from your partner if you start getting too near to them in bed.

362
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 Yeah. It's a mattress.

363
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 Like a chaperone mattress.

364
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 It's exactly if you've got the mother-in-law mattress.

365
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 Yeah. You keep your hands off her. God, I hope your mother-in-law is not going to say that to you.

366
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 She's coming to your bedroom every evening.

367
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 You keep her in the cupboard, didn't you?

368
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 You've got to sort that relationship out, but back to the fact.

369
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 So it's a mattress, so the idea is the reason that Ford have been able to make is

370
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 they've been using the lane-keeping technology that they have in their cars,

371
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 which nudges the car away from a lane by taking the steering wheel and moving it,

372
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 and they've applied it to the bed.

373
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 And it's only a prototype stage at this point, but yeah.

374
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 I mean, I'm not familiar with whenever I'm driving a car and slightly go off course,

375
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 then my car gets tipped off the road.

376
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 But do they do that for all cars?

377
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 Do they have this lane-keeping technology?

378
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 Self-driving cars.

379
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 Self-driving cars in the future will have things that keep you in the lane.

380
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 I got it. So this isn't technology that they have in existing Ford cars.

381
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 Because that's one of the two main struggles when driving, I found,

382
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 is the left and right of the lane.

383
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 Staying on the road.

384
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 Staying on the road one.

385
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 Yeah, it's the main one.

386
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 And then you've got the forward and backwards one of how close you are to the car in front.

387
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 And you've got the left right one of, you know.

388
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 It's very much a two-dimensional, exactly, isn't it?

389
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 You're not going up in the up and down day's care of yourself.

390
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 It doesn't help out your mother calls in the back home.

391
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 Andy, for Christ's sake.

392
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 I just have one more bot of the year that I quite like.

393
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 Let's try to help humans out in the future.

394
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 This is irony man.

395
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 Based on Iron Man, it name wise, but nothing else.

396
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 This is a sarcastic robot.

397
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 And it has a useful purpose, which is that, apparently, people trust robots more

398
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 when, and they see more natural and trustworthy when they're being a bit sarcastic

399
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 because humans are sarcastic or ironic.

400
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 And so when robots are just giving you direct answers all the time, people don't trust them.

401
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 So they've invented irony man.

402
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 And it does things like it will pair a really deadpan expression

403
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 with humorous facial expression, a deadpan words with humorous facial expressions,

404
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 or it will add sarcastic emphasis.

405
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 So it will say something like, "I'm delighted you spilled your pint of beer on me."

406
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 And then, you know, give it away.

407
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 Which is you in the face?

408
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 Exactly.

409
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 Violent irony.

410
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 It has a slight problem, so it's sort of to help vulnerable people or older people

411
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 who, you know, people get robots to care for them around the house.

412
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 But it can't tell when's the appropriate time to deploy irony.

413
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 So in really sensitive situations, it is currently saying things like

414
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 which you might get with older people indeed.

415
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 Oh, good.

416
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 You've fallen over.

417
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 That's sort of thing.

418
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 Well, we got just while we're on robots.

419
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 We've got a fact in the book about the robot hotel in Japan

420
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 where they fired all of their robot staff and replaced them with humans.

421
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 And James, you just went there.

422
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 I did.

423
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 I stayed there deliberately as people know from our last podcast

424
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 when I deliberately went to this town in the Netherlands just because I read about it.

425
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 I deliberately booked into this hotel.

426
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 Instead of going to a nice hotel.

427
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 Drag my wife along to this place.

428
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 And yeah, they have robots at the reception,

429
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 but I didn't see any other robots in the whole building.

430
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 Really?

431
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 I'm afraid.

432
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 Because they used to have them, didn't they?

433
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 I believe so.

434
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 But we left quite early that day and the cleaners were there

435
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 and they were either extremely realistic robots.

436
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 Or they were humans.

437
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 Really?

438
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 Yeah.

439
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 Because there was one problem was that they could only reach a quarter of the rooms,

440
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 I think.

441
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 Was that right in the hotel?

442
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 That's not right.

443
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 They couldn't get up to certain stairs.

444
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 And also whenever a robot met another robot on the corridor,

445
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 they didn't know how to pass each other.

446
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 Which I have that problem a lot as well.

447
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 Are you go left and they go left?

448
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 It's a nightmare.

449
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 Actually, the only other thing that I did see was they had these amazing cupboards.

450
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 I don't know if you guys have seen these before.

451
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 It's like a cupboard and you put your clothes in.

452
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 And it's like a washing machine, but I don't think there's any water.

453
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 And you leave it on for 45 minutes and it freshens up your clothes.

454
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 Wow.

455
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 So it doesn't wash them which I learned.

456
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 Is that the stage?

457
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 I've been on the road for two weeks and didn't have many clean clothes.

458
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 And I thought maybe it'll wash them.

459
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 But it does make them a lot fresher.

460
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 And I think like maybe business people use them because obviously in Japan

461
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 you work long hours and stuff like that.

462
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 And so it just freshens up.

463
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 Do we know how it freshens them?

464
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 I think it's through air.

465
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 And maybe it's damper.

466
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 Wow.

467
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 I think.

468
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 But you basically hang something up and then close the door and some magic happens

469
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 and you open it up and it smells quite nice.

470
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 Wow.

471
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 But it's not clean.

472
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 That was very cool.

473
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 I just have one last thing.

474
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 This is a technology bit of news from the book.

475
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 And it's that the bass player from Blur, who's also a cheese maker, Alex James,

476
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 has been this year turned into cheese.

477
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 It's going to affect the reunion to a pretty bad rhythm.

478
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 This is quite exciting.

479
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 This is done as part of the V&A Museum exhibition in London.

480
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 And what they did was they took celebrities and they turned them into cheese.

481
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 So they took bits of bacteria off of them and made them.

482
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 So Alex James was turned into a block of chasher.

483
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 Professor Greene, a musician, was turned into a sort of form of mozzarella.

484
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 The madness singer Sucks was turned into a block of cheddar.

485
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 And you can go visit all these celebs as cheeses.

486
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 It's like a weird Madame to swords.

487
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 Do you know where on their body they got the bacteria from to make the cheese?

488
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 Because I think it would affect whether I was going to beat the cheese or not.

489
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 I don't think you should eat the exhibits.

490
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 Oh no.

491
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 So it's not cheese that's being sold.

492
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 They didn't do it on mass.

493
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 No, no, it's just part of a museum.

494
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 What a waste.

495
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 That's breaking.

496
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 Well, the thing is with cheeses, it gets better the longer you leave it.

497
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 Some cheeses anyway.

498
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 So maybe once the exhibition is finished, we can all go with a few crackers.

499
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 Yeah.

500
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 Eat Alex James.

501
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 Yeah.

502
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 Okay, it is time for fact number three.

503
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 And that is Chazinski.

504
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 My fact this week, taken straight from the book of the year 2019, available

505
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 from all good bookstores and online.

506
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 That was really professional.

507
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 That's how you do it.

508
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 That is how you do it.

509
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 Thank you very much, guys.

510
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 My fact is that in a country of 1.3 billion people,

511
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 a polling station was set up in the middle of the jungle for one single man.

512
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 So that can only be India or China.

513
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 And it's one of them.

514
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 Take a part.

515
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 Well, which one has elections?

516
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 And you've narrowed it down.

517
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 Yeah, this was in India, India and election this year.

518
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 Of course, a man with election.

519
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 And there was a priest, a holy man called Darshandas, who he takes care of a temple

520
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 which is in a wildlife sanctuary very deep in the jungle.

521
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 It's 70 kilometers into the jungle in Gujarat.

522
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 And he wanted to vote.

523
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 And so five election officials traveled the 70 kilometers into the jungle,

524
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 set up a polling station specifically for this guy.

525
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 And he could vote.

526
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 Although weirdly, and I couldn't find out why this was, they set it up a kilometer from his house.

527
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 So they went all that way and they couldn't quite recall the last kilometer to his front door.

528
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 I think you're going to make the efforts about, don't you?

529
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 Yeah.

530
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 Like you've got to go. He might want to think about who he's going to vote for during that one kilometer walk.

531
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 They probably put placards on the trees on the way.

532
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 So they're trying to convince him to sway the vote.

533
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 Yeah, you're right.

534
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 But this wasn't the only polling station for just one person.

535
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 Was it not?

536
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 Amazingly.

537
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 So there was another one in a place called Malagam.

538
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 And the team traveled 300 miles with the polling booth.

539
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 That must be cumulatively. It must be.

540
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 And there was a big interview with them.

541
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 And I think a Washington Post, it was, went along.

542
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 And the, as they were setting up the voting machines, one of them said,

543
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 there is both excitement and nervousness.

544
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 If the one voter turns up, there will be 100% voting.

545
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 But if she doesn't, it will be 0%.

546
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 And they got there.

547
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 And the locals nearby said, oh, yeah, she's left. She's left the area.

548
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 Oh, wow.

549
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 But they thought, no, we hoped you turned up.

550
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 They still have to have it there just in case they assume, right?

551
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 Right.

552
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 So demanding. So they had to at 5 a.m. wake up and carry out a mock poll with 50 mock votes.

553
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 Even though there's only one voter coming to the polling station.

554
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 And then, thankfully, the woman in question was called Tayang.

555
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 And she turned up.

556
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 She had been 125 miles away looking after her ill mother.

557
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 She came all the way back to vote here.

558
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 She arrived at 8.30. She still had to queue up because there was a problem with the machine.

559
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 No way.

560
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 She voted.

561
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 And then they had to stay open until 5 p.m.

562
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 Oh, my God.

563
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 So if you've ever overslept and missed a count selection or something,

564
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 you should feel incredibly guilty.

565
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 I agree.

566
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 Considering the polls usually close at 10 o'clock, I think.

567
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 If you've overslept.

568
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 Come on, James.

569
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 We've all been students.

570
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 Do we know if the original person that we're talking about with this fact voted?

571
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 Josh Anders did vote.

572
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 We are not sure who he voted for because it's.

573
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 Well, there's a lot of people to vote for because there are thousands and thousands of thousands of people.

574
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 Who take that in this election?

575
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 Yeah.

576
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 There's 1.3 billion people, as we said in India.

577
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 And anyone who doesn't have a criminal conviction can stand in the election.

578
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 So you have so many thousands of people.

579
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 There's only 543 seats.

580
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 And in the last election in 2014, we didn't have the figures for this year yet.

581
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 But 90% of the 8,200 people who were going for election,

582
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 forfeited their deposits.

583
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 I know.

584
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 So everyone's getting like 0% and 0.1% and stuff like that.

585
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 There's a guy from Tamil Nadu who has contested and lost 201 elections.

586
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 Oh, wow.

587
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 How old is he?

588
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 Well, he's been pretty old.

589
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 But maybe like, like you say, council elections, local elections and stuff like that.

590
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 And there's another guy called Fakad Baba who is currently on his 17th time,

591
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 running for the national election.

592
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 And his guru has predicted that his victory will come on the 20th attempt.

593
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 Sorry.

594
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 He's got three or nine having to go through all 20.

595
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 Yeah, only to not win on the 20th attempt.

596
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 Did you say it's if you're not convicted of something?

597
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 If you've not been convicted of a criminal offense.

598
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 I know there are a lot of people who have been charged.

599
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 Yeah.

600
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 So we found out something about this in our research for the book,

601
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 which is that of the MPs elected, actually elected,

602
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 43% are facing criminal charges of some kind.

603
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 And of those, 18% are either charged with murder or attempted murder.

604
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 So it's about 8% of all elected MPs in India are charged with either murder or attempted murder.

605
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 And the reason is, of course, because in India, they have an unbelievable backlog of cases,

606
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 which I think we might have mentioned before, like there are millions.

607
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 If they did one every day or 100 every day,

608
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 they won't clear it up for something like a thousand years or something like that.

609
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 Yeah, I think we have discussed.

610
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 And in fact, there's one story in the book, I think an Indian man was imprisoned this year

611
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 for he stalled something like 20 rupees in 1979.

612
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 That's right.

613
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 So it's been 40 years waiting to get through.

614
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 And he pledged not guilty.

615
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 And then he sort of disappeared in 2004.

616
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 They finally caught up with him arrested and put him in jail.

617
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 And then I think they exonerated him.

618
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 He spent three months in jail.

619
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 And then they were like, "Actually, I'm not guilty."

620
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 Yeah.

621
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 I'm not evidence you can collect for this theft. They released him.

622
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 And then they said, "Don't do it again, I think."

623
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 They did, but they found not guilty.

624
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 You're not guilty, but also don't do the thing you're not guilty of again.

625
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 That's very lucky. It was only three months,

626
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 because presumably the waiting list to revisit cases must be equally long.

627
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 Yeah.

628
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 Yeah.

629
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 That's the thing in the Scottish courts, isn't it?

630
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 They used to have that, I don't know if they're still with that verdict.

631
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 Not guilty.

632
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 Not guilty and not proven, which means not guilty, but don't do it again.

633
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 Yeah.

634
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 That's the old line, yeah.

635
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 Just we should say how amazing and undertaking the Indian election is.

636
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 So it's held in seven different phases because India is so vast.

637
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 As you say, it just shows how swollen our parliamentary system is,

638
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 because they have about a hundred fewer seats than us in Parliament.

639
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 And they manage to rule this massive country.

640
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 But it lasted this year from 11th of April to 19th of May.

641
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 What voting?

642
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 Yeah, voting.

643
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 So they do it in seven different sections and it's across 20 states.

644
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 And of course, Narendra Modi won in the end.

645
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 And just in sort of political news that we have in the book,

646
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 one of my favorite stories was about the Prime Minister of Bhutan.

647
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 We found out this year that he likes to unwind from his very stressful job

648
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 by going to a hospital every Friday and operating on someone.

649
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 That's it.

650
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 He said there's a quote he says, "Some people play golf, so I'm due archery.

651
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 I like to operate."

652
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 Which he is qualified to do, isn't he?

653
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 No, but he doesn't do operations he's qualified for.

654
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 That's the amazing thing.

655
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 He takes a random patient and he picks a random procedure and he just does it.

656
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 Very impressive.

657
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 And the things you can get away with in public office.

658
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 For a long time, so before he was Prime Minister,

659
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 he was the only urological surgeon in Bhutan.

660
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 And he used to have a TV show.

661
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 He used to go on on the BBS, which is Bhutan Broadcasting Service.

662
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 And the public would call in and he would give advice over the...

663
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 Oh, like embarrassing bodies, basically.

664
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 Yeah, but live, I guess.

665
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 Okay, embarrassing bodies live.

666
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 What do you have?

667
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 I don't actually see that.

668
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 I don't know what that show does.

669
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 That's really interesting.

670
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 They didn't have TV in Bhutan until the 80s or 90s.

671
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 As well.

672
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 So he must be like one of the biggest TV stars in history.

673
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 Yeah, actually, do you know what?

674
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 It's possible this is radio.

675
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 I just realised I can actually put that detail down.

676
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 Oh, so like any questions I'm really over for?

677
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 But live.

678
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 Oh, sorry.

679
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 Any answers I'm really over for.

680
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 That's the one where you ring in.

681
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 But it's normally ringing in the same way you think about Brexit.

682
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 It's like gardeners question time.

683
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 Yeah.

684
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 But not about gardening.

685
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 But about the urological place.

686
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 Please don't call up either gardeners question time.

687
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 Or any questions with your weird bodily problems.

688
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 Okay.

689
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 Jonathan Dimblebee will not appreciate such a thing.

690
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 Hello.

691
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 Is that embarrassing bodies?

692
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 No, this is Gardner's question time.

693
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 Oh, can I tell you about my problem anyway?

694
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 I'll go into the garden.

695
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 Hang on.

696
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 The rash on my penis is still there.

697
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 Now the neighbours are shouting something.

698
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 Are there political news from the year?

699
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 Yeah.

700
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 So there was the election of Zelensky, president of Ukraine,

701
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 who's recently comment his own by getting involved in American politics.

702
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 But this, he was a film star.

703
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 So much like the Bhutanese guy.

704
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 He was famous before he became president for other reasons.

705
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 Oh, Greta Thumburg.

706
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
 Oh, Greta Thumburg.

707
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 So he starred in a series called Servant of the People.

708
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 And it was an extremely popular series where he plays a man,

709
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 the lead role, way plays a man who accidentally becomes leader of the country.

710
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 And so he thought I'm going to try that for real.

711
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 And so he set up a party called Servant of the People,

712
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
 because why waste that name?

713
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 And yeah, he smashed it.

714
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 It's insane.

715
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 It's so bizarre.

716
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 I mean, I can't think of it.

717
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 I guess it's like the stars of the thick of it, isn't it?

718
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 Actually becoming Prime Minister.

719
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 Or you know, like the star of the apprentice,

720
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 becoming president of the United States.

721
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 Yeah, true.

722
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
 Yeah.

723
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 I guess the thick of it, yeah, if they are exactly leaders.

724
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
 Did you see the recent news about Zelensky,

725
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 which is too recent for the book, actually,

726
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 aside from the fact that Trump's obviously in a small bit of trouble

727
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
 for asking him to look into his rival?

728
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,000
 But Zelensky also just broke the world record for the longest ever press conference.

729
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 Did you?

730
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 So this is a few days ago.

731
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 It was, it lasted from 10 in the morning until just after midnight.

732
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 It's a long press conference.

733
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 Oh my goodness.

734
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 And what was that?

735
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 Questions and answers?

736
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 It was questions and answers.

737
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 And apparently he largely did it to try and deflect attention

738
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 because he's getting in trouble in Ukraine

739
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 for having got involved with Donald Trump in this questionable way.

740
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 But eight hours, so I guess at 6 p.m.

741
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 someone came up and announced that he'd broken the existing record,

742
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 which was set by Belarus.

743
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 So presumably everyone thought, "Oh, thank God we can go away now."

744
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 He went on for another six hours.

745
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
 That is amazing.

746
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 It's impressive, isn't it?

747
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 Wow.

748
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 And he also said that he had special surgery done,

749
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
 or a special treatment done on his vocal cords

750
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 to make them stronger, had injections to strengthen his vocal cords.

751
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 Oh yeah, you can get both tucks in your vocal cords,

752
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 can't you to make them stronger?

753
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 Oh, it must have been that.

754
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
 Wouldn't that seize them up like it does with your face muscles?

755
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
 It would seize them up, but then you,

756
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 it's the amount that you put in depends on how much they're seized up, right?

757
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
 And actually looking at it now,

758
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 some of the questions were why your vocal cords looking so sexy.

759
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 So I think it, it was the Botox thing.

760
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
 (Laughter)

761
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 There was, who I would have liked when the Ukrainian election,

762
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
 because then they would have been speaking to Trump on the phone

763
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
 and discussing Joe Biden,

764
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
 is the person who was called Darth Vader,

765
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
 who ran for a seat in that election.

766
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 Right.

767
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
 Darth Victoravitch Vader.

768
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
 Wow.

769
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
 So you just want to hear his heavy breathing voice on the phone, you're saying?

770
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 Look, you take it away.

771
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,000
 (Laughter)

772
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 But no, I just, like, I just love the idea of instead of Trump being in trouble with Zaladsky,

773
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 being in trouble with Darth Vader, that would have been hilarious.

774
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
 (Laughter)

775
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 Trump turns out to be his son out of his fifth term in all this.

776
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
 What are my favorite facts of this book?

777
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 So there was a, there was a kid who became quite famous globally known as Eggboy.

778
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,000
 Eggboy became famous in Australia because he threw an egg,

779
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,000
 well smashed an egg rather on a far-right politician called Fraser Anning

780
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
 during a live TV interview and Anning punched him.

781
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
 And so he became famous.

782
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
 But it's just a tiny detail that I think James U found out,

783
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,000
 that Eggboy, who got given the nickname Eggboy for the thing that he did.

784
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,000
 In later interviews, he revealed that at school he is already known as Eggboy

785
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,000
 because he used to bring hard-boiled eggs to school

786
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
 and classmates complain that they smell.

787
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
 So he used to be Eggboy in a bad way

788
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
 and now he's Eggboy the hero.

789
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
 That's good though, he's taking back control of the name Eggboy, really, is what you're saying.

790
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,000
 Yeah, exactly. He's two things have happened in his life, taking back control.

791
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
 And you have to stop reading the telegram.

792
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
 (Laughter)

793
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
 There was one more Aussie politician.

794
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,000
 He got caught replying to his own Facebook post, but under another name.

795
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
 This is Angus Taylor MP. He was a liberal MP.

796
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,000
 And he posted a video announcing extra parking spaces at train stations.

797
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
 Fine, fair enough.

798
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,000
 And then he immediately replied to it, but under his own account name,

799
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
 saying, "Fantastic, great move, well done Angus."

800
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
 (Laughter)

801
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
 And everyone spotted this, and they immediately also started replying.

802
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
 Fantastic, great move, well done Angus.

803
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
 (Laughter)

804
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
 So actually he got what he wanted, lots of support.

805
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
 Lots of surprises.

806
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 Lots of surprises.

807
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
 That's the Eggballs.

808
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
 It's the Eggballs.

809
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
 (Laughter)

810
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
 Eggballs are something you need to see that urologist about.

811
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
 (Laughter)

812
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,000
 (Music)

813
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
 Okay, it is time for our final factor of the show.

814
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
 And that is my fact.

815
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,000
 My fact this week, taken from the book of the year 2019,

816
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,000
 is that a Canadian man who threw his speeding ticket out of his car window

817
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
 was then given a ticket for littering.

818
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
 So he lost twice.

819
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
 That will teach you.

820
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 It's the opposite of Eggboy, basically.

821
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
 And two wrongs don't make a right today.

822
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
 The speeding ticket didn't undo his...

823
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
 Not in law, definitely.

824
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
 ...littering, no.

825
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
 Two wrongs allowed us.

826
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
 It's fine.

827
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
 (Laughter)

828
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
 Didn't even number of murders.

829
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
 Yeah.

830
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
 So many people have been ruined by that misconception.

831
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
 It's such a shame.

832
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
 (Laughter)

833
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
 Yeah, there was a lot of funny, weird crime stories this year.

834
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
 I wasn't there.

835
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 A lot of kind of fitting ones, a bit like that.

836
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
 So one of the stories in the book is that five guys were arrested

837
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
 at a branch of five guys.

838
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
 Yes.

839
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
 The Burger Chain.

840
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
 This was in Florida.

841
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
 And they got into a fist fight.

842
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
 It was an out and out brawl.

843
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
 And I think we like to think that there were only four guys involved

844
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
 and the police just asked the fifth guy.

845
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
 Do you mind if we arrest you as well?

846
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
 (Laughter)

847
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
 We've got to make this work.

848
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
 (Laughter)

849
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,000
 There was a British fugitive who got arrested.

850
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
 He fled Australia on a jet ski.

851
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
 I really like this guy.

852
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
 Where was he going?

853
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:03,000
 He was going to Papua New Guinea, which is 120 miles.

854
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
 So I think he stopped the fuel at Nyland on the way.

855
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
 However, he ran out of fuel three miles short of Papua New Guinea.

856
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,000
 And he was wanted for some pretty bad stuff.

857
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
 He was armed with a crossbow as well.

858
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,000
 And when he arrived at this remote peninsula to refuel

859
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
 with his jet ski, a witness told the Brisbane paper the courier mail

860
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
 that he stuck out like dogs' balls.

861
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
 (Laughter)

862
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
 That just reminds me, the Australian jet ski guy,

863
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
 of a story that we had in, I think it was the first book of the year,

864
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
 still available, still very readable.

865
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
 Remember the guy, I think he was the musician,

866
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
 who had eaten way too much at a restaurant.

867
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
 A seafood restaurant he jumped into the ocean to escape the police.

868
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
 And his tactic for escaping the water jet,

869
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,000
 at the water ski riding police, was to hide underwater.

870
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
 (Laughter)

871
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
 I can't remember his name, he had an amazing name.

872
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
 Oh.

873
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
 He was a rapper.

874
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
 Yeah, that's awesome.

875
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
 I was going to say self-made cash, but he's from this year's button.

876
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
 Yeah, he is.

877
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
 Because he, self-made cash is the rapper who has got done

878
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
 for credit card fraud, right?

879
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
 That's right.

880
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,000
 But was it, and I think the judges, when they condemned him this year,

881
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
 said self-made cash, because he's actually written all these songs

882
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
 where the lyrics kind of talk about how you can do a good fraud.

883
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:18,000
 Or, this probably the authorities don't do a decent fraud, mate.

884
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
 And so I think when he was sentenced, the judge was like,

885
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
 "Self-made cash thinks that he is really adept at credit card fraud.

886
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
 He is not."

887
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
 Yes.

888
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
 If a judge is saying that to you, you probably know

889
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
 that you're not very good at credit card fraud already, don't you?

890
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,000
 Can I give you a crime story, which wasn't in the book?

891
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
 Yeah.

892
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
 This is kind of serious, but also quite amazing.

893
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
 So there was a man who was arrested on suspicion of stalking

894
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
 a female pop idol in Japan.

895
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
 But the way that he stalked her, this is incredible.

896
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,000
 She took photos and selfies and stuff and put them on social media.

897
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,000
 And he looked at her pupils and looked at the reflection

898
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
 in her pupils of what she was looking at.

899
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,000
 And then he used Google Street View to find out where she lived.

900
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
 Fraud.

901
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
 Wow.

902
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
 Isn't that unbelievable?

903
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
 Oh my God.

904
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
 I mean, that is terrifying.

905
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
 It's terrifying.

906
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
 It's not a fun story, but it's an amazing story.

907
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
 But it's useful because it means that we should all start walking around

908
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
 with our eyes closed.

909
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
 I think just whenever you take a selfie, have your eyes closed.

910
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
 Yeah.

911
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
 But if you really want to be a safety contrast owner, just go around with your eyes closed constantly.

912
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
 I think so.

913
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
 There was a similar story, though, that is in the book, which was about

914
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

915
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,000
 Do you remember the thing about the fact that she was in a bath?

916
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
 And it was a nude photo of her in the bath.

917
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,000
 And you could see in the faucet at the end, you could see a reflection

918
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
 that looked like her.

919
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
 And she was insisting that this wasn't her.

920
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
 And they couldn't really prove it, but someone eventually got to the bottom of it.

921
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
 And it was someone who uses the website, WikiFeed,

922
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,000
 which is where feet are posted up of celebrity women all over the world.

923
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
 And you rank them and you look at pictures of their feet.

924
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
 Do you?

925
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
 Only sometimes.

926
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:01,000
 But this guy is the person who exonerated her for the fact it wasn't her,

927
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
 because he was able to show that it wasn't her feet.

928
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
 And he said, "I've sucked enough toes in my life to recognise

929
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
 what something doesn't look right."

930
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
 Yeah.

931
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,000
 I mean, he becomes a hero for doing that.

932
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:18,000
 And then immediately in the same sense, it becomes a creepiest person.

933
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,000
 There was another weirdly, another story related to that as well,

934
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,000
 which was about Taylor Swift using facial recognition at her gigs.

935
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,000
 So when you arrived, I think there are lots of booths around.

936
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,000
 And if you look into the booth, you can get snapped or your photo is taken.

937
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
 Or there are cameras all around at her gigs.

938
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:41,000
 And then those images are uploaded to a central command post.

939
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,000
 And then they're cross-referenced with images of people who are known

940
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:50,000
 to have been stalkers of Taylor Swift or have been too creepy.

941
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
 And then...

942
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
 Is that a crime?

943
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
 I think being too creepy is a crime.

944
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
 Yeah, too creepy, too creepy.

945
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
 And so then the people can be slung out of the gigs.

946
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,000
 Yeah, I read just on the facial recognition thing,

947
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,000
 that in China, they've literally just come up with this new technology

948
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:13,000
 which can facially recognise an entire stadium of people.

949
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
 And that's what it is.

950
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
 It's a really, really high megapixel camera.

951
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,000
 So this is one of the most clear cameras that exists in the world.

952
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000
 And you can get an image of 10, 20,000 people.

953
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
 And it can facially recognise all of them.

954
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,000
 Wait, so if those exact 80,000 people are together again somewhere,

955
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
 it'll know that they're the same ones who all attended the show for a game.

956
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
 That's not the reason.

957
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
 Sorry, just say 80,000 people in a bolted game.

958
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
 That's my take away from that story.

959
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
 That was where that fell down.

960
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,000
 No, it's like to look for stalkers or criminals or anything.

961
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
 Yeah.

962
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:51,000
 The purpose is not to have a comeback gig for an audience.

963
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:55,000
 I just like the phrase, it could recognise an entire stadium of people.

964
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
 It needs to see that one stadium exactly composed that way.

965
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,000
 It would be an amazing game of spot the difference,

966
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,000
 or worse, Wally, for an AI machine.

967
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
 That would be fantastic.

968
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
 If you could cajole the 20,000 people to come back again.

969
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
 Apart from one person who can't make it.

970
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
 And they'd just replace them with someone in a red stripy jumper.

971
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
 Amazing.

972
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
 If you want really good facial recognition,

973
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
 it helps to be an authoritarian state like China,

974
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
 because they are way out in front with it.

975
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
 They are.

976
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
 They know they're doing.

977
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
 That's good advice.

978
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
 I think that.

979
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
 But on facial recognition,

980
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
 we should also talk about bodily recognition,

981
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,000
 which has a big feature in our book.

982
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:37,000
 And this is specifically the story that a Swedish police officer recognised

983
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,000
 the naked body of a criminal when he was sharing a sauna with him.

984
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
 Amazing.

985
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
 I thought he recognised the faces.

986
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
 We don't know.

987
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
 He doesn't say.

988
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
 He said we recognised each other.

989
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
 We don't know which part.

990
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
 I didn't know that rash.

991
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,000
 What a hero though.

992
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
 That is amazing.

993
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
 Because obviously, sauna is a big thing in Sweden,

994
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
 and they are here.

995
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
 And so he arrested him.

996
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
 He made a naked arrest.

997
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
 They were both naked in the sauna together.

998
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
 And I hadn't realised that they did recognise each other.

999
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
 So it sounds like their eyes met across the steam room.

1000
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
 Do you think I recognised the criminal?

1001
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
 I'd quickly put a shitload of water on the colds.

1002
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
 So he got really, really steamy.

1003
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
 And then you could make your escape.

1004
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
 That's brilliant.

1005
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
 That's why every such is a great suit of criminal.

1006
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:23,000
 We had just a bit of behind the scenes on the writing of this book.

1007
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
 Obviously, for all the articles,

1008
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,000
 there was a lot of sort of back and forth about what we thought was a funny way to put things

1009
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
 or a better way to write things.

1010
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
 Massive arguments.

1011
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
 Just put it as it is.

1012
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
 Massive.

1013
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
 Just absolutely life-shattering arguments.

1014
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
 We're not yet talking to each other fully again.

1015
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:41,000
 No, but one of my favourite moments was actually an argument that I had with Andy

1016
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
 about the drawing for this article,

1017
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,000
 which was of a man that Adam Deltie drew for us,

1018
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
 sitting in a sauna with handcuffs around his-

1019
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
 Adam Delties are cartoonists, by the way.

1020
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
 For all three of us.

1021
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
 For all three of us.

1022
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
 Our illustrator, yeah.

1023
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
 And he drew the criminal in the sauna with a towel on,

1024
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
 sitting on a towel and handcuffs on.

1025
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
 Andy wanted the towel removed,

1026
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
 because he wanted to see the man's bottom.

1027
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,000
 Yeah, but probably because in Scandinavia they don't use towels.

1028
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
 Thank you, James.

1029
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
 I wish you'd been in the room for this argument.

1030
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
 Yes, but the scene I would have still come down on.

1031
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
 But he was in handcuffs.

1032
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,000
 So obviously something had happened whereby handcuffs were grabbed.

1033
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
 Most likely a towel was grabbed as well.

1034
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:23,000
 That was your internal logic of the way that scene played out.

1035
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1036
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
 Please write in with your votes.

1037
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
 Who do you want to leave the show forever?

1038
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
 Andy, or Dan?

1039
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
 Or both.

1040
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
 He had an option to see.

1041
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,000
 I've got one fact which didn't sadly make it into the book,

1042
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
 because it's going to happen too late.

1043
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
 But this is another arrest.

1044
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,000
 And it's a man in a place called Mold in North Wales.

1045
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
 Oh, yeah, I like it really.

1046
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
 Yeah.

1047
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
 So he was arrested after he tried on some jeans in a shop.

1048
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
 Okay.

1049
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:54,000
 But he then left behind 31 wraps of heroin in the pockets of the jeans that he tried on.

1050
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
 Let's say really well.

1051
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
 I just want to say.

1052
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
 Wow, that is amazing.

1053
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,000
 And absolutely balls he has. He went back into the shop to say,

1054
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
 "Oh, I've left my medication behind."

1055
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,000
 It was these 31 little wraps of white belt or whatever.

1056
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
 Oh my god.

1057
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,000
 I think I would do that as well, because they are probably going to track you down at that point anyway.

1058
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
 I want to track you down.

1059
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
 Oh, CCTV, I suppose.

1060
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:20,000
 If you've gone in and paid for your dry cleaning, they're going to have your decels.

1061
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
 It's a close shop.

1062
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,000
 He was, he was, he did try, he tried on some.

1063
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
 Wait a minute.

1064
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
 He's taking his trousers off and left them in the clothes shop.

1065
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
 So it wasn't entirely clear to me.

1066
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
 I think he, he's left the clothes shop.

1067
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:35,000
 He tried, he tried the trousers on, but then he was holding the heroin and then he put them in the trousers pockets.

1068
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
 So he could remind himself.

1069
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
 I know, I bet I know.

1070
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:44,000
 Maybe he was testing the trousers to see how they fit with 31 wraps of heroin and then to see if they made the pockets look bulky.

1071
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:51,000
 I think I have done that in close shops, not specifically with that substance, but with other classic drugs.

1072
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
 Really?

1073
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
 Because you do.

1074
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,000
 Well, you put things in the pockets, see how they look.

1075
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
 You need to check the pockets aren't too tight, I think.

1076
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
 Oh, yeah.

1077
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,000
 Well, this is, this is an example actually in the book.

1078
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:11,000
 So we have an article which is called "Unusual Suspects" where this actually happened where a drug dealer suspected drug dealer in Manchester left a rucksack stuff with drugs on a tram.

1079
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,000
 And they found him because he had his full name and address on the bag.

1080
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
 So it does happen that you can...

1081
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:23,000
 Yeah, criminals are ready. It's another good weird idiot criminal story was, I think this is my top five stories in the book.

1082
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:28,000
 It's that the owner of the smugglers in hotel was charged with people smuggling.

1083
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
 And this is a place in Washington state.

1084
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:35,000
 It's near the Canadian border and it's owner Robert Boulay really embraces the smugglers theme.

1085
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:40,000
 So, you know, he's not trying to hide, he hasn't tried to hide the fact before that he's into the smuggling theme.

1086
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,000
 Every room is named after a famous criminal.

1087
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
 You know, all the decorous smuggler theme.

1088
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
 Or as the heroin dealers in.

1089
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
 Yeah.

1090
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:58,000
 And yeah, he just went one step too far and has been charged with 21 counts of inducing aiding a rebetting seven people who are entering Canada illegally.

1091
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
 That's amazing.

1092
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:03,000
 But the thing I love about this place is I think this is the thing that you've found done.

1093
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:13,000
 But that in a more unbelievable coincidence, in 2012 the smugglers in was a scene of a crime when police arrested three people there for smuggling drugs in a car.

1094
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,000
 The coincidence one and the license plate was smuggler.

1095
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
 Yeah.

1096
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
 Well, this was the thing we mentioned on the podcast years ago.

1097
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
 Yeah.

1098
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:25,000
 Just when we were writing this, I don't think it was my facts, but I recalled that we'd mentioned it.

1099
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
 I thought, "Can't be the same place."

1100
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
 And it is. What's the guy doing?

1101
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
 Same place.

1102
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
 Smuggling.

1103
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
 Yeah.

1104
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
 We should wrap up soon.

1105
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
 Anyone got anything before we do?

1106
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
 Just one other nice little crime story.

1107
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:40,000
 This is that a man in Salisbury had to excuse himself from jury duty.

1108
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:45,000
 Do you remember this? He was excusing himself on the grounds that he was scheduled to be the judge in the case in question.

1109
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
 That's awesome.

1110
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
 This was Judge Keith Cutler.

1111
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,000
 And he said, "You know, I can't really be on the jury because I'm judging this case."

1112
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
 He's resident judge of Winchester and Salisbury.

1113
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:58,000
 And so he wrote to ask for an exemption.

1114
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
 And he was rejected.

1115
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,000
 He was told by the authorities that he had to apply to the resident judge if he wanted an exemption.

1116
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,000
 And he wrote back and said, "I am the resident judge."

1117
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,000
 All he needs to be is also the executioner.

1118
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
 He's an idiot of it himself.

1119
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:23,000
 Okay, that's it. That is all of our facts from our new book, The Book of the Year 2019.

1120
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:27,000

1122
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:36,000
 And sorry, can I just say, like, you might think having heard this, you've heard everything in the book.

1123
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:41,000
 There are so many facts from it, but honestly, there are a thousand more facts, two thousand more facts.

1124
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
 Yeah, and it's really, this one's really fun.

1125
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,000
 We've all written individual articles about things that we're passionate about.

1126
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:52,000
 James has written about how to make the ultimate betting move to win a lot of money.

1127
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
 You've written about the Mueller report.

1128
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
 Yeah, my main passion.

1129
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,000
 Andy got a sausages article in, finally.

1130
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,000
 I interviewed the mayor of Uranus in America.

1131
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:08,000
 There's a lot of us in the book this time, and it's, and it's a great book.
