 [MUSIC]

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.520
 >> Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.920
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Peterborough.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.440
 >> [APPLAUSE]

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.480
 >> My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.560
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.120
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.280
 facts from the last seven days.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.040
 And in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.360
 Starting with fact number one, and that's my fact.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.120
 My fact this week is that the man known as the father of British midwifery

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.440
 was called Willie Smelly.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.400
 >> [LAUGH]

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.280
 >> So childish.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.240
 >> Childish.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:07.520
 >> Willie Smelly, so Willie Smelly, he lived between 1697 and 1763.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.720
 He was a Scottish obstetrician, obstetrician, obstetrician.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.640
 >> Sure, I'm sure James can make one of those work in the edit.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.360
 >> [LAUGH]

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.040
 >> He lived in London and he was basically, obviously midwifery was going on for

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.320
 thousands and thousands of years.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.040
 But he was the first male who was allowed sort of into the game.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.120
 And he did quite a lot of things to sort of turn it into somewhere that was a bit

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.800
 more safer for having babies.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.920
 He sort of helped to advance the use of forceps with some designs.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.880
 And he was a very important figure in that world.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.360
 >> He designed a mannequin, didn't he?

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.240
 That would let you learn how to deliver a baby.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.120
 It was known as the mock woman, or sometimes this most curious machine.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.480
 It had legs and feet that would have shoes and stockings on it.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.860
 So that made it quite realistic.

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:57.360
 >> Cool.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.240
 >> There was an anatomist called Robert Campbell who said he could scarcely tell

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.960
 the difference between the machine and a real live woman.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.680
 >> [LAUGH]

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:07.240
 >> Wow.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.800
 >> This machine didn't have a head.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.200
 >> Yeah.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.600
 >> It sounds terrifying, it really does.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.880
 It had a stomach that was full of leather.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:17.280
 >> Right.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.080
 >> Which I think represented the baby.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.040
 >> Well, there's a little wax doll in there as well, also a baby.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.800
 And it had a bladder which you could fill up,

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.760
 which was helpful with a little cork stopper, like the real female bladder.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.120
 >> [LAUGH]

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.920
 >> So you could break the water.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:32.680
 Was that the idea?

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:33.640
 >> I don't know, maybe.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.080
 >> Was that for breaking the water?

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.240
 >> Yeah, we sometimes use real bones and real skeletons.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.960
 I think he made at least four of these weird robot women.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.560
 And for one of them, yeah, he used actual, he made ligaments and muscles and

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.440
 they moved like real people and used an actual skeleton of a mother and baby, I think.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.080
 >> And he used to use real people as well, as in pregnant women.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.000
 And he used to have a thing because he was very good at his job as well.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.680
 So a lot of people wanted him to be the midwife for the job.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.880
 And so he would say, I'll do it for free, I'll wave my feet if I can do it in front

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.160
 of all my students and they can observe and I can do a sort of lecture as I'm doing it.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.080
 >> I do wonder though if you want your midwife to be focused mostly on

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.680
 delivering the child, not on delivering a good lecture.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.480
 If they want to deliver one thing well, you want it to be the child.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.200
 >> Yeah, today's lecture is what not to do during birth.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.360
 >> What?

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.040
 >> Stop the birth, stop the birth.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:29.280
 Hi everybody, just wanted to let you know today's birth is sponsored by Hello Fresh.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.160
 >> This model, we don't have any of them anymore.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.160
 They've all disappeared and we don't know where they are.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.200
 We have a few others from around the same time.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.760
 There's one in France called the Boudin Pinard model.

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.280
 And that was kind of similar.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.560
 It was made of rubber.

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.680
 It had a vaginal opening with a thumb screw so you could make it bigger and smaller.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.480
 >> Some of them work like that actually.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.240
 Yeah, the non-cork, the cheaper vaginas come just with the screw top.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:02.960
 >> This one also had a rubber rectum and the rubber rectum was there because there

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:08.000
 was something called the Rittgen manoeuvre and one version of doing that is the midwife

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.040
 would put her fingers up the bum of the mother and then they would kind of manoeuvre the

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.760
 head a little bit if it was in the wrong place and it would stop the perineum from

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.260
 getting in trouble.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:24.600
 This Rittgen manoeuvre evolved from a technique from the ancient Greeks.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.720
 It was first proposed by a Greek physician called Sauranus.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:28.720
 >> No.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:29.720
 Very nice.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:30.720
 Unbelievable.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:31.720
 >> Sauranus of Ephesus.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:40.720
 >> Can you have an alternative determinism when the words won't mean that for another

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.040
 year.

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:52.040
 >> He was controversial, William Smelly, because men weren't allowed into the midwifery game

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:57.320
 and male midwives were seen as controversial when they started practicing and they had

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:03.160
 to work by touch because there was a risk they would see something indecent so some of

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:08.480
 them had to kind of work with a sheet in between them and the delivery.

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:13.920
 >> I think even up until the 19th century, any men working on the female body, and by

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:17.840
 the 19th century it was all men, women had sort of been edged out of the practice, were

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:23.160
 encouraged not to look directly at a woman's private part so obstetricians were told.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.600
 >> Like the son.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:30.040
 >> Obstetricians had specific instructions that to reassure a female patient they're

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:34.080
 not looking at a private part, they should gaze into the distance or maintain constant

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.080
 eye contact with her.

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:40.280
 >> What a stressful situation, giving birth already, very, very, very stressful.

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.840
 Imagine seeing your medical team walk in, they're all in blindfolds, some of them are

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.960
 looking at the mountain over there.

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.840
 >> One of them just staring you straight in the face.

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:53.200
 >> Do you put the fingers at the bum like it's put the tail in the donkey?

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.720
 >> Oh my God.

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.840
 >> And it was really controversial for the men to come in, wasn't it?

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:03.120
 Because before that all of the midwifery was done by women, there was someone called Elizabeth

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.560
 Nihel who was writing in the 18th century who really thought that this was a terrible

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:08.560
 idea.

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.660
 She thought that basically all the men had come in and they were finding problems that

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:16.600
 weren't there and the best way to do it was to be a natural birth and you're getting all

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:20.480
 these forceps in but if you just leave it it will probably be fine in most cases and

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:25.400
 she said that a lot of the surgeons were coming in and they were being fast tracked to become

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:30.120
 a midwife and people like William Smelly were trying to teach them really, really quickly

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:35.720
 and like barbers, tailors and pork butchers were coming in to become midwives in a short

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:36.720
 period of time.

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.200
 >> Gosh, you would ask, wouldn't you?

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:39.840
 >> What was your previous career?

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:46.520
 >> The men were called, when they started becoming midwives, they were called either man midwife

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:52.880
 or he midwife and the masters of the universe.

00:06:52.880 --> 00:07:00.880
 >> It kind of doesn't work because midwife, the actual term itself, it literally means

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:06.480
 with wife so you are the mid to the wife.

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:09.880
 That was just an extra bit of word you didn't need.

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:14.400
 Everyone is a midwife if you're helping give birth.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:19.600
 >> You said that William Smelly, he developed the forceps which was one of his main contributions

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:23.880
 so he didn't invent it, he made it better, I guess you can all picture what a forceps

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:27.440
 is in birth, it's sort of like a pair of scissors but instead of the scissor bits you have like

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:28.440
 a clamp.

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:31.560
 >> It's more like a pair of asparagus tongs.

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:32.560
 >> It's like that.

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:36.440
 >> Man of the people, Andrew Huntsmurray.

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:39.560
 >> Or like two eyelash curlers clamp together.

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:42.720
 >> More like that but gigantic ones for a giant.

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:44.800
 >> To clamp onto a child's head.

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:50.800
 >> He developed forceps which were only used in 2% of childbirth even then so it's weird

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:56.240
 that it was so revolutionary but forceps before that the design was a complete secret from

00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:00.520
 all the hundred years so there was this one family that invented them, the Chamberlain

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:05.400
 family and from the mid 16th to the mid 17th century over five generations they had to

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:09.560
 keep it completely secret so they had this elaborate ceremony when they arrived at the

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:13.480
 house of a woman in labour they'd arrive in this big carriage, they'd have this massive

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:17.840
 wooden box that had all like carvings all over it, it would take two people to carry

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:21.840
 the forceps in, no one was allowed to see inside, it looked like it was some gigantic

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:26.640
 instrument, no one else is allowed in the room when the woman's giving birth and then

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:30.840
 they'd make weird noises like ringing bells and making weird sounds so the people outside

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:34.120
 the door thought what is this amazing instrument?

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:35.120
 >> Wow.

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:36.120
 >> No one knew.

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:39.760
 >> I read that sometimes they blindfolded the woman giving birth.

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:44.680
 >> Could anyone see in the room?

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:48.320
 >> Blind man's muff was what they called it.

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:49.320
 >> Wow.

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:50.320
 >> Wow.

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:54.200
 >> Yeah, they were two brothers weren't they, the Chamberlains, both called Peter.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.200
 >> Yes.

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.200
 >> So weird.

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.200
 >> So weird.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:01.640
 >> We should say there's another controversial thing about Willie Smelly which is that it

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:08.960
 turns out he might have been a serial killer and the four of us discovered this very late

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:14.920
 in our research, it really feels like his name has buried the headline throughout history.

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:19.160
 >> I don't think it's even worth mentioning, you know, you do one dodgy thing.

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:23.920
 >> Yeah, but no, it turns out apparently quite a serial number of dodgy things here.

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:26.120
 >> You do a series of dodgy things.

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:27.120
 >> Yeah.

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:30.880
 >> And the idea was that he and another guy called John Hunter I think wanted to be the

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:36.280
 best midwives and wanted to kind of become famous for their new techniques and so they

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:41.760
 needed people to test it out on and in the kind of Burke and Hare kind of style, they

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:44.600
 knocked people off so that they could get their cadavers.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:50.260
 >> Called Birking in fact, I don't know, which seems like, where's hair gone in that verb?

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:53.520
 All the papers talk about it as, you know, he was part of a bit of Birking.

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:57.760
 >> I think Hare's like, it's cool, I'm very happy with it.

00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:58.760
 >> Is it definitive?

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:02.520
 It seems like there's a lot, I guess, I mean, he wasn't tried, so it's never been, it's

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:05.680
 hard to kind of know for certain certain, but it does seem like there's lots of circumstantial

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:10.480
 evidence of people not asking, you know, even not asking questions about where the bodies

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:12.480
 are coming from, that kind of thing.

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:16.800
 >> I think it's quite, there was someone at the time who raised it during his lifetime

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:21.680
 and he almost stopped practicing for a while just because he thought, you know, either

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:26.400
 the rumor is becoming too prevalent amongst people or it was true and I better stop, we

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:32.320
 don't know which, but it's come up more recently that someone has gone through all of the lists

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:37.560
 of women that he had access to and how did he get that many women and it kind of seems

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:41.840
 like all the academics who love him, because he was so influential, there were hospitals

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:47.120
 named after him that have since closed, but up until 1992, wouldn't you go to the Willy

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:50.640
 Smelly hospital?

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:55.240
 But so it seems that there's, someone has written this paper and a lot of academics have looked

00:10:55.240 --> 00:11:01.000
 at it and gone, yeah, it's very compelling, damn it, because they love him so much and

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.960
 they almost don't want to look at it but it looks like it could be true.

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:12.560
 >> So on midwives who aren't serial killers, there were some, the job of a midwife sometimes

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:17.920
 entailed giving women orgasms, this was, so there was this belief from basically from

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:21.680
 ancient Greece until the early 19th century that, you know, in the 19th century everything

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:25.360
 got very buttoned up and no one was supposed to enjoy anything anymore, but before that

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:29.640
 everyone thought that it was damaging for women if they didn't have orgasms frequently

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:34.760
 enough and Galen, you know, the ancient physician said that women would suffer from limb aches

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:38.880
 and things like that due to the build up of female generative fluids within.

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:44.200
 And so in the 16th century a doctor called Forestus, a Dutch doctor said that women should

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:47.760
 employ midwives to manually stimulate them on a regular basis if they weren't getting

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:48.760
 enough sex.

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:49.760
 >> Fair enough.

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:50.760
 >> Absolutely fair enough.

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:55.400
 >> The midwife's coming around again, darling, are you sure?

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:58.040
 I didn't even know you were expecting a baby.

00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:00.760
 >> I will be soon.

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:07.720
 >> Yeah, the idea with Galen was that he thought that a woman would have exactly the same genitals

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.880
 as a man, but just inside out.

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:14.640
 And so that was why the man needed to orgasm in order to create the seeds so the women would

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:15.640
 have to do the same.

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:16.640
 That was the idea.

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:21.320
 He thought also if a woman got too hot that her genitals would fall outside of her body

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:24.120
 and she'd turn into a man.

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:32.520
 So it's not true, that's not true, just busting another myth.

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:37.400
 >> Did you know that some midwives are hamsters?

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:39.040
 >> What's this?

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:40.360
 It's a person called a hamster.

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:41.360
 >> No, it's not.

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:42.360
 I'm not doing it.

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:45.200
 >> If this is what the NHS has resulted to, then it does mean more funding.

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:48.800
 >> There's a specific kind of hamster called a Jungarian hamster.

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:53.600
 The paternal hamster, the dad, will mechanically assist the delivery.

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:59.440
 She will help the mother give birth to the litter of baby hamsters and does a proper

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:09.300
 job like will consume the amniotic fluid, tick, proper good service here, eat the placenta

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:10.300
 to...

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:12.560
 >> Finger up the bum, orgasm for the woman.

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:15.920
 >> They'll even open the baby's airways by licking its nostrils.

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:16.920
 So that is...

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:18.520
 >> They're not the only animals that do it.

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:21.560
 So we know that some monkeys do it as well.

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:22.560
 They like to perform that.

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:25.920
 In some cases, bats have been observed doing it as well.

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:30.920
 So there's a biologist called Thomas Kuntz, and he lives in Florida.

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:33.920
 Hey, listen.

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:40.360
 Just because we've had soaring as Willie Smelly, Kuntz doesn't need to be lumped in there.

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:41.920
 So basically, he was in the lab...

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:45.160
 >> Must be so hard for a bat to give birth because you're upside down.

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:46.160
 >> No.

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:47.160
 You're like, "Push, push."

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:48.160
 >> I'm trying.

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:49.160
 >> Exactly.

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:50.160
 You're meant to flip the other way.

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:55.920
 So he was in his lab, and suddenly, there was all this drama because a bat was in distress,

00:13:55.920 --> 00:14:00.960
 and another bat kind of flew over and was like, "Hey, come on, gotta help the bat out."

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:06.080
 And so she flies back, and they go and observe it, and this other bat, who's not related

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:08.360
 by blood, gets next to this bat.

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:12.320
 So bats actually do flip upside down to give birth, so they're on their feet.

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:14.560
 But this bat was upside down, still hanging.

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:18.480
 So this other bat flipped upside down and started going, "Ugh!"

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:19.480
 To show this other bat.

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:23.760
 >> You know, you've used upside down to mean both the right way up and upside down on multiple

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:26.080
 occasions, and no one has any idea.

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:31.120
 >> Okay, so the non-pregnant bat has flipped onto its legs the wrong way around, and it's

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:32.120
 going, "Ugh!"

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:37.040
 And straining and showing the upside down bat how it should be done.

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:40.680
 And then the upside bat goes, "Oh, okay, flips over."

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:47.160
 And then the bat not pregnant starts licking the genitals of the bat to sort of help lubricate

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:48.160
 it.

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:49.160
 So awkward there's a kid in the front row.

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:50.160
 I'm really...

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:54.920
 It's trying to work out how to say what I needed to say here.

00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:58.360
 >> I think what happened there was about five minutes ago, you worked out what you were

00:14:58.360 --> 00:14:59.360
 going to have to say.

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:02.400
 You're like, "I'm just going to keep saying upside down until it stops."

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:05.960
 >> Look, we need to move on to our next fact.

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:09.080
 It is time for fact number two, and that is Andy.

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:15.880
 >> My fact is that there is a town in Mexico where one person in ten is a dentist.

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:18.120
 >> I know what you're thinking.

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:19.120
 Sounds about normal.

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:20.880
 You know, sounds like a roughly normal ratio.

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:21.880
 It's not.

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:22.880
 It's not at all.

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:29.400
 It's called Los Algodones, and it is the dentistry capital maybe of the world, certainly of Mexico.

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:34.040
 It's got 350 dentists in it, but that is one person in ten there.

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:35.520
 >> So who are they...

00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:39.040
 Well, surely if there's not many people, who are they actually dentists drinking?

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:40.040
 >> Each other.

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:41.040
 Each other.

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:42.040
 Got no teeth left?

00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:43.040
 No, no, no.

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:44.040
 It's not that.

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:45.040
 So it's a huge place for health tourism.

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:49.280
 So people who don't have dental insurance in the USA will travel, because it's very

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:52.600
 near the border with the United States.

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:57.280
 But just to give you an idea of how weird this proportion is, one person in ten.

00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:03.560
 So they have to look after 320 teeth each, right?

00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:08.200
 Because you know, one person is, I know I'm sort of assuming there's no health tourism now,

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:10.480
 but that would be 320 teeth each.

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:14.060
 In the UK, each dentist has to look after about 53,000 teeth.

00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:15.060
 >> Right.

00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:16.060
 I know.

00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:17.060
 >> Wow, that's quality.

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:18.060
 That's certainly true.

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:19.060
 >> It's less than one tooth a day, isn't it?

00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:20.060
 That's, you know...

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:21.060
 >> Absolutely.

00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:22.560
 >> They can spend a day and a bit on every single tooth.

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:23.560
 >> Yeah.

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:24.560
 Yeah, yeah.

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:27.680
 They've got 200 times as many dentists per head of population in the town.

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:33.920
 >> Los Algodones is only four square blocks in size, and the population is about 40 times

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:37.120
 smaller than just to take a random city, Peterborough.

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:38.120
 >> Wow.

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:39.120
 Makes me think.

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:44.680
 >> It's also extremely sunny, sunniest place on Earth.

00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:45.680
 So great dental care.

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:46.680
 >> On Earth.

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:47.680
 >> On Earth.

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:51.400
 Well, the sunniest place on Earth is Yuma, which is just on the other side of the border.

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:53.840
 I mean, literally a 20-minute drive away, less.

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:56.360
 So I think it can also be called the sunniest place on Earth.

00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:57.360
 >> That's amazing.

00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:00.680
 >> Yeah, it gets 305 sunny blue sky days a year.

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:01.680
 >> Wow.

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:05.080
 >> Interestingly, the best way to get there from the sunniest place is through a place

00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:06.360
 called The Gap.

00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:08.200
 So if you've got teeth problems...

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:09.200
 >> I love it.

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:14.160
 >> ...but The Gap is just what they call a huge hole in Donald Trump's wall.

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:15.160
 >> Oh, really?

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:20.240
 >> I thought if anyone can fill in a gap, it's the town of Dentist next to it.

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:26.280
 I was reading a bit about dental tourism generally, and dental holiday package deals are just

00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:28.200
 a bound, if anyone's interested.

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:34.240
 I didn't realise this, but you go online to dentalholiday.co.uk, and for £3,200, you

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:39.960
 can get a trip to Slovakia, which includes a Pampadere hot spring spa island, a return

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:44.000
 boat trip down the Danube, and eight crowns or veneers.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.000
 >> Wow.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.000
 >> It's not bizarre.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.000
 >> Sounds great.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:52.120
 >> And it was actually, it was a weird thing in COVID earlier on this year.

00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:57.400
 In Ireland, I said Ireland had specific travel bans which allowed for health tourism, but

00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:03.040
 you couldn't go just on holiday, and suddenly people going to Tenerife rocketed, and it

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:07.560
 turns out they also have quite a lot of dentists in Tenerife, and a study found that 40% of

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:12.480
 people travelling from Dublin airport on flights had a letter from a dentist in Tenerife.

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:13.480
 >> Right.

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:15.960
 >> Yeah, yeah, this person definitely deserves dental treatment.

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:16.960
 They need to come here.

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:17.960
 >> That's amazing.

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:18.960
 >> Right.

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:22.880
 >> Have you guys heard of the big Thomas?

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:23.880
 >> The big Thomas?

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:24.880
 >> Yeah.

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:26.200
 >> That sounds like a euphemism for something.

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:27.200
 >> It does, doesn't it?

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:32.360
 >> Well, he was a French man, and his name actually was, his name was Jean Thomas, which

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:35.640
 is a euphemism for something, but that's not what, that joke wasn't known at the time,

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:36.800
 so he would have been fine.

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:40.480
 >> Neither was Soranus, but it's still funny.

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:46.360
 >> He was a dentist in Paris in the 18th century, and he was, for 50 years, a massive fixture

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:51.400
 on the Pont Neuf Bridge, and he was the most famous dentist in Paris.

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:56.640
 He was this huge guy, and he, if you couldn't get your tooth out, he would lift the patient

00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:00.080
 in the air by the tooth to try and get it out.

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:02.080
 He was incredible.

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:07.440
 His motto was, "Dentem Synon Maxillam," the tooth, and if not the tooth, the jaw.

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:15.400
 I, I'm getting something incredible, incredible guy.

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:18.480
 He was in an opera as a comic character.

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:22.800
 He was called the honor of the universe and the terror of the human jaw.

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:25.080
 He was quite, quite the man.

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:28.520
 He was once pranked by a group of medical students who attached four rockets to the

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:33.080
 underside of his cart, because he had a sort of, you know, wheeled surgery, basically,

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:36.640
 and then when he was in the middle of extracting a tooth, they let off the rockets, and the

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:39.280
 cart blew up, and he fell over on the patient, and that was-

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:40.280
 >> And what about the patient?

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:42.840
 >> It doesn't say what happened to the patient.

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:47.000
 That was, that was the equivalent of, you know, Beatles about or whatever, in 18th century

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.000
 Paris.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.960
 >> I reckon there were a lot of people with only half a jaw in that town who were very

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:53.200
 much behind the medical students during that prank.

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:54.200
 >> Yeah, yeah.

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:57.840
 >> But was that in the 1700s, you say, because that was when becoming a tooth puller became

00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:02.240
 such a lucrative industry suddenly, because sugar consumption quadrupled, I think, in

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:06.360
 that century, and so suddenly people's teeth were rotten all over the place, and they used

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:11.400
 a thing called a pelican, which was shaped like a pelican beak, and it clamped onto your

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:15.800
 tooth and gum, and then you leave it out, you kind of twisted the tooth out, and it

00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:16.800
 came out.

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:19.040
 >> I saw a pelican in the park the other day.

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:20.040
 >> Amazing.

00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:21.040
 >> Great story, Andy.

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:23.440
 >> No, but they are surprisingly huge.

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:24.440
 >> Yeah.

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:25.440
 >> They are.

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:26.440
 >> You've seen a pelican in the flesh?

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:27.440
 >> I have seen them, yeah.

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:31.040
 >> These were smaller than, they were not the size of actual pelicans.

00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:32.040
 >> I understand, yeah, yeah.

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:33.040
 >> As you were.

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:34.040
 >> Yeah.

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:35.040
 >> Nonetheless, guys, check it out.

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:38.720
 If you Google pelican length, you're going to be surprised.

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:42.640
 Thank God you didn't let James cut you off from the rest of that story.

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:43.640
 >> Sorry.

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:47.520
 >> Do you know that your dentist can tell if you're scared of them?

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:50.680
 >> Because you say, you're shaking with fear, you're trying to run away.

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:52.720
 >> Even if you're kind of fronting up, they can tell.

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:53.720
 >> Oh, really?

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:56.320
 >> And it's bad news as well, because it can make them fuck up.

00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:57.320
 >> Oh.

00:20:57.320 --> 00:21:02.440
 >> Because this study, and what they did was they gave students some t-shirts and they

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:07.440
 kind of either gave them a really stressful exam or they gave them a really calm lecture.

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:10.320
 I don't know what a calm lecture is, but they gave them one anyway.

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:14.600
 And then they put the t-shirts on mannequins and they got the dentist to do some dental

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:15.760
 work on them.

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:21.840
 And they found that the dentist who were doing work on the ones with sweaty, scared t-shirts

00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:23.720
 did a much worse job.

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:27.160
 They sometimes would like damage the neighboring teeth when they were trying to get one out.

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:28.160
 They put another one out.

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:29.160
 >> Oh, really?

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:30.360
 >> So they can smell fear?

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:32.360
 >> They can smell fear.

00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:34.800
 >> That makes me more scared of them.

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:38.960
 >> And then that's going to make them even worse, which makes you even more scared.

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:41.760
 >> Well, this is what I haven't been for 10 years, James.

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:42.760
 Gosh.

00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:45.160
 >> You don't need to go as often as they say.

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:46.160
 >> Oh, wow.

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:47.160
 Okay.

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:50.400
 >> I mean, I, too, am more of a once a decade, once a recovery, a couple of decades kind of

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:54.840
 gal, and that's probably not often enough, but how often do most dentists recommend you

00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:55.840
 go?

00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:56.840
 >> Once every six months?

00:21:56.840 --> 00:22:01.720
 75% of dentists in America say every six months, that has no basis in scientific fact.

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:05.800
 That's been around since the 18th century, and actually, the NHS recommends that for

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:08.800
 children, it should be kind of once a year, and for adults, you should be okay going every

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:09.800
 two years.

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:10.800
 >> Oh, okay.

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:11.800
 >> So there you go.

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:12.800
 >> Nice.

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:13.800
 That's pretty encouraging.

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:18.720
 >> The first woman who was a member of the British Dental Association was this really

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:20.720
 cool girl called Lillian Lindsay.

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:24.880
 I was reading about her, it was, I think it was sort of towards the end of the 19th century,

00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:29.800
 and she did it because she sort of made a throwaway rebellious mark to her headmistress,

00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:32.280
 and she became one of the leading dentists in the country.

00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:36.240
 She was head of the British Dental Journal, president of the British Dental Association.

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:40.080
 She was like Britain's leading dentist by the 1930s, 1940s.

00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:43.480
 The reason she became a dentist was because she was at school, and I had a headmistress

00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:47.360
 called her into her office and said, "Look, Lillian, I think you're destined to be a

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:53.000
 teacher of deaf and dumb people," and Lillian said, "I absolutely refuse to be a teacher,"

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.360
 and the headmistress said, "Then I will prevent you from doing anything else."

00:22:56.360 --> 00:23:01.840
 Very interesting teaching style back in the Victorian age, and so Lillian replied straight

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:05.160
 away in her words, she said, "Like a flash," I replied, "You cannot prevent me from being

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:10.200
 a dentist," and then she immediately realized, knowing nothing of dentistry, having stated

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:15.960
 that boldly, she would have to become a dentist, and she did, and she kept on not being allowed.

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:20.320
 When she applied to the National Dental Hospital, she had to do her interview outside on the

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:23.960
 pavement because the dean who was interviewing her said that she would distract all the men

00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:26.400
 in there too much if she came inside.

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:27.400
 Oh my God.

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:28.400
 Yeah.

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:29.400
 Tough.

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:30.400
 Right.

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:32.600
 It was a bit easier to become a dentist in Mexico back in the day.

00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:37.880
 The first female dentist in Mexico was Margarita Chornees Salazar, and she's actually the

00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:43.040
 first woman in Latin America to get a university diploma in anything, if it was in dentistry.

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:48.240
 But to get her degree in dentistry, she needed a letter from her dentist saying that she knew

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:51.120
 how to be a dentist.

00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:53.440
 That's so good.

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:57.440
 Well, the truth is that she had been practicing, I think, someone else in her family had been

00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:02.120
 a dentist, and when they couldn't do it, she would do the work, and then she was like,

00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:05.400
 "Well, I should get a degree for this because I do know how to do it," and they said, "Well,

00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:06.400
 where's your evidence?

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:07.400
 Here's a letter."

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:08.400
 Right.

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:09.400
 That's amazing.

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:11.600
 It's weird because I don't think that my dentist would be a good judge of how good a dentist

00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:12.600
 I would be.

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:17.960
 I took mild curiosity about the procedures, but it's not enough.

00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:23.200
 You know, when you're training to be a dentist, you have to work on something called a phantom

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:29.320
 head, and it's just the name they provide for the head mannequin.

00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:33.040
 That birthing device mannequin was also a phantom, wasn't it?

00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:35.480
 I think phantom just meant something that was not real.

00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:37.520
 But didn't we say the mannequin was missing a head?

00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:40.400
 Yeah, I think this sounds like it was the head, too, in Willie Smelly's body.

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:41.400
 I think that's it.

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:42.400
 Yeah, yeah.

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:44.800
 But you used to have to provide your own teeth, not your own teeth.

00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:49.280
 You had to provide teeth for the phantom head.

00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:50.720
 Where did you get those from?

00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:51.720
 I don't know.

00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:54.720
 Imagine if your first dentist or you went into the room and said, "Okay, we're going

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:58.760
 to extract all of your teeth, of course, because put them in this mannequin."

00:24:58.760 --> 00:24:59.760
 What?

00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:00.760
 Yeah.

00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:04.680
 But I spoke to a dentist about this, and she confirmed that since the passing of the

00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:08.840
 tissues act, you no longer have to bring your own teeth, which is good.

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:13.280
 But she said the phantom head sometimes leak on you in the room, so that's a bit stressful.

00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:14.720
 Hmm, leak on you.

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:15.720
 Lovely.

00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:16.720
 They leak on you, yeah.

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:17.720
 Okay.

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:18.720
 What do they leak?

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:19.720
 I don't ask follow-up questions.

00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:20.720
 That's what I've learned.

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:26.840
 How much do you reckon is the most expensive electric toothbrush on the market today?

00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:29.440
 So something available to all of us in boots?

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:33.280
 Well, to all of us who have enough money for it, which might not be any of us.

00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:34.280
 £1,000.

00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:35.280
 A really nice one.

00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:36.280
 £1,000.

00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:37.280
 £5,000.

00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:38.280
 £3,000.

00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:42.520
 Wow, you've all gone – this is really unusual for these guessing games.

00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:45.820
 Only Dan goes for £10 billion.

00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:48.760
 Andy goes for £25 billion, and it goes for I don't care.

00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:52.200
 But in this case, you've all gone round about the right amount.

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:53.200
 It's $4,200.

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:54.200
 Wow.

00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:56.400
 Not far off, £3,000, really.

00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:57.400
 That's incredible.

00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:58.400
 I'll take it.

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:03.160
 It's the design, durability, it's got an antibacterial coating.

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:05.720
 I mean, it is that much, but they're bristle heads.

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:08.840
 They give you a free one every six months.

00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:11.240
 Oh, so you're saving money, really?

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:13.240
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:15.960
 Actually, that only works for the first three years.

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:17.920
 After that, it's £400.

00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:18.920
 Wow.

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:23.840
 But if you use the offer code FISH, you can get it.

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:25.560
 We do need to move on to our next fact.

00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:29.240
 It is time for fact number three, and that is Anna.

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:35.200
 My fact this week is that in the Yazidi religion, Adam left paradise when a peacock pecked an

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:40.800
 anus in him so he could defecate, and you're not allowed to poo in the Garden of Eden.

00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:44.440
 So he left to have a poo, is basically.

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:46.520
 He had to go outside to take a poo.

00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:48.880
 And then there was the doors didn't let him back in.

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:50.600
 Not allowed back in once you left the Garden of Eden.

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:52.400
 You can't just pop out and in willy-nilly.

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:54.480
 So really smelly.

00:26:54.480 --> 00:27:01.440
 So, was he, so sorry, he didn't need to go to the loo until this peacock pecked him

00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:02.440
 a bottom.

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:03.440
 No.

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:04.920
 Well, first of all, the peacock tricked him.

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:08.400
 So basically the peacock is a guy called Tawusi Melek.

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:12.520
 So in Yazidi religion, there's God, and then God has a bunch of sort of messengers, angels

00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:13.520
 on earth.

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:17.880
 The most important one is this peacock messenger, angel, Tawusi Melek.

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:21.040
 And Melek had to lure Adam out of paradise.

00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:23.760
 And he did so by feeding him a grain of wheat.

00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:27.440
 And then as soon as Adam had eaten this grain of wheat, because he hasn't eaten for eternity.

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:31.640
 So that immediately goes straight through him, and he's desperate for the loo.

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:36.080
 And at that point, Tawusi Melek says, "Okay, I'll peck you an anus, but now I've done that.

00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:37.920
 You are going to have to go outside to poo."

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:40.160
 And then he's out, and he can't get back in.

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:44.560
 And in this creation story, you're thinking, "Where is Eve?"

00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:46.440
 And she's not really a part of this, right?

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:47.440
 No.

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:48.760
 She's not instrumental to the birth of...

00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:53.120
 She's there, but she doesn't create the human race.

00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:54.120
 Yeah.

00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:56.080
 In fact, it sounds like he...

00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:59.360
 Oh, Jesus, the little boy in the front row.

00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:01.400
 So he's upside down.

00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:04.880
 So he spends a bit of time with himself.

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:12.400
 And what he harvests in the process gets put into a jar.

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:15.160
 Have you ever considered setting cryptic crosswords there?

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:22.120
 But from the jar that's contained, that is where the birth of humananity came from, right?

00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:23.120
 Yeah.

00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:24.120
 Or Yazidi people, anyway.

00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:25.120
 Yeah, the Yazidi people, rather.

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:28.520
 The Yazidi people are descended from Adam's divine essence, I think, was what you were

00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:29.520
 trying to say.

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:35.640
 But then Eve's divine essence was put in another jar, and that became all the worms and scorpions

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:37.600
 on Earth, according to the story.

00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:38.600
 Wow.

00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:39.600
 Nice.

00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:40.600
 Where's her PR?

00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:41.600
 Wow.

00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:47.760
 This sounds like a much more fun and strange Garden of Eden myth, doesn't it?

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:49.040
 Maybe we're just so used to...

00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:50.040
 We're so used to it.

00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:51.040
 It's all nuts, isn't it?

00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:52.040
 Yeah.

00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:53.040
 Yeah.

00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:54.040
 It's just a new version.

00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:55.040
 Yeah.

00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:56.040
 It's just got detail of pecking and anus.

00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:57.040
 Is the only thing that...

00:28:57.040 --> 00:28:58.720
 Well, I mean, that's more fun.

00:28:58.720 --> 00:28:59.720
 And it's a peacock.

00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:00.720
 Peacocks, they're fun.

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:01.720
 They're more fun than a snake.

00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:02.720
 They are, do they?

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:03.720
 Yeah.

00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:04.720
 I would say.

00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:08.320
 There are some versions where a dove pecks his anus, and some where a raven pecks his

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:11.680
 anus, but everyone can agree that some kind of bird pecks his anus.

00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:14.440
 Oh, gosh.

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:16.240
 We can all agree.

00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:18.960
 Xanus was that.

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:21.920
 People's Front of Judea, isn't it?

00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:22.920
 Yeah.

00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:27.440
 There are so many of these Garden of Eden stories, and there was a big rash in the

00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:31.760
 19th century of people going looking for it or claiming that they found it.

00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:38.600
 So, one Victorian historian, the first president of Boston University, claimed it was at the

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:43.320
 North Pole because he said it's definitely there, it's got to be there, that he had

00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:47.000
 lots and lots of evidence, published a book which was about 500 pages long saying it's

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:50.120
 definitely at the North Pole.

00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:51.800
 Evidence is a strong word, right, for what he...

00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:53.360
 Really a very strong word.

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:54.360
 William Fairfield Warren said...

00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:55.360
 Yeah, that was his name.

00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:56.360
 Yeah, yeah.

00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:57.360
 What was his evidence?

00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:01.920
 His evidence was that we've never found the Garden of Eden and no one's ever been to

00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:02.920
 the North Pole.

00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:05.200
 That's pretty much what it was.

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:06.200
 It was circumstantial.

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:07.200
 It feels like...

00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:08.200
 That makes sense.

00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:09.200
 It must be that.

00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:12.440
 Wasn't there a bishop who said it was on Mars as well, to really...

00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:13.440
 Oh, really?

00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:14.440
 Yeah.

00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:15.440
 Ages ago.

00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:16.440
 Oh, we've never been to Mars.

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:17.520
 And we've never been to Mars and still haven't.

00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:18.520
 Very good point, James.

00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:22.040
 That was more sensible because, you know, longer term thinking, the whole North Pole thing,

00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:25.880
 we were going to get there in the very near future, at which point we were going to discover

00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:29.200
 it's not the Garden of Eden unless they've all lied to us.

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:33.800
 There was another person who had a theory about where the Garden of Eden was and that

00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:37.440
 was the first female presidential candidate for the United States.

00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:42.760
 So Victoria Woodhull, who we must have mentioned before, ran for president in 1872 and she

00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:49.040
 also wrote a big speech called The Garden of Eden in the 1870s about what she thought

00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:52.200
 it was and she basically was ridiculing all of these people who thought the Garden of

00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:54.800
 Eden was at the North Pole or on Mars or whatever.

00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:59.600
 And she said that any schoolboy of 12 years of age who should read the description of

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:05.640
 this Garden and not discover it has no geographical significance ought to be reprimanded for stupidity.

00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:09.800
 And then she went on to argue that it's all a metaphor for the female body and the female

00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:11.300
 reproductive system.

00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:16.320
 So you know, in the Garden of Eden there are four rivers that meet and she said they are

00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:18.760
 the four fluids of the body.

00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:23.040
 So one river is the blood, one is the bowels, one is the urinary and one is the reproductive

00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:24.040
 system.

00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:30.040
 So the Euphrates is the reproductive system up which the sperm flows in the Biblical

00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:35.680
 metaphor and that was what the Bible intended us to think in order to inseminate the Garden

00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:36.680
 of Eden.

00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:37.680
 Okay.

00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:38.680
 We've got more than four though, right?

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:41.560
 Well, they didn't know about bile ducts and things at the time, I guess.

00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:44.760
 But we had like tears, that's one that's not been mentioned.

00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:45.760
 That's true.

00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:48.640
 Yeah, maybe she should have done tears instead of bowels, maybe bowels and urine could have

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:49.640
 gone together.

00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:50.640
 Yeah, snot.

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:51.640
 If you have, if there is very snot.

00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:52.640
 Yeah.

00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:54.280
 These are more streams, I think, streams and tributaries.

00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:55.280
 Goal.

00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:56.280
 You haven't seen me.

00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:57.280
 Goal.

00:31:57.280 --> 00:31:58.280
 There's another one.

00:31:58.280 --> 00:31:59.280
 Goal, yeah.

00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:00.280
 Goal.

00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:01.280
 Take it up though.

00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:02.280
 Maybe this is why she didn't become president.

00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:05.560
 It's certainly a pretty weird stump speech, yeah.

00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:11.000
 I was looking at some other myths about birds and anuses and all that kind of stuff.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.120
 Oh my goodness.

00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:17.720
 The Taolipang people of North America, of South America, sorry.

00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:22.760
 They have a story where all animals used to have no anus and they would always defecate

00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:24.680
 through their mouths.

00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:28.920
 But the anus was actually a separate animal called Puitu.

00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:33.560
 And Puitu the anus would wander around slowly, but he would always annoy people by farting

00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:34.560
 in their faces.

00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:35.560
 What?

00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:36.560
 And then running away.

00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:37.560
 What is the story?

00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:42.880
 Give us a bit more, what does this mean?

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:43.880
 What happened next?

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:44.880
 Well, it's a great story, isn't it?

00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:47.600
 When you need to know what happens next.

00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:48.600
 Sorry.

00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:49.600
 I'll keep going.

00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:53.960
 So the two parrots decided that they'd had enough of him farting in their faces so they

00:32:53.960 --> 00:33:00.200
 went to try and capture the anus and eventually they did and they tied him up and then they

00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:06.560
 decided to cut up the anus and spread it out to all of the animals in the world.

00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:11.640
 The tapir was really eager to get a piece and they cut out a huge piece and that's why

00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:15.840
 the tapir has a larger anus than other animals.

00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:20.660
 Who's creation story is this?

00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:22.360
 This is the Taulipang.

00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:23.360
 Right.

00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:25.480
 I don't know, it's a good animal story.

00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:31.840
 I think I prefer Andy's Pelican story, it just had so much to it.

00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:38.040
 There is an Inuit folktale, the title character of it was him whose penis stretches down to

00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:44.100
 his knees and in the middle of the story he's attacked by a raven while he's sleeping and

00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:49.400
 by the end of the story he's known as him whose whole penis barely peeps from its cave.

00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:55.960
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show and that is James.

00:33:55.960 --> 00:34:00.840
 Okay, my fact this week is that the first woman to motorcycle from coast to coast in

00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:05.400
 the United States did so with her mother in the sidecar.

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:18.240
 Oh, no, this is the mother and daughter team of Effie and Avis Hotchkiss and in 1915 they

00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:23.200
 decided to go from New York to the world's fair at San Francisco but just to show it

00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:24.200
 could be done really.

00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:28.840
 We're not exactly show why they did it, Effie told one reporter that it was to demonstrate

00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:33.840
 that motorcycling is perfectly good as a girl's sport and other people thought that she was

00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:37.740
 just sick as she was working in Wall Street and she was sick of her clerical job and she

00:34:37.740 --> 00:34:39.360
 wanted to see the world.

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:42.080
 Other people thought she just wanted to go to San Francisco and wasn't trying to break

00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:43.080
 any records.

00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:44.080
 She was just trying to do it.

00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:45.080
 Wow.

00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:46.080
 What about her mum?

00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:47.080
 What do you think about why her mum went?

00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:48.600
 Well, we're not sure why her mum went.

00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:52.120
 According to some of the interviews at the time, one of the reasons might have been that

00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:58.240
 she wanted to inflate the weight of the motorcycle because she's quite a big lady because then

00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:00.920
 that would stop Effie from going too fast.

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:04.520
 Yeah, she was really concerned with her speed, wasn't she?

00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:05.520
 Yeah.

00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:08.080
 Effie had been sort of booked a few times.

00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:11.440
 She was quite famous for kind of zipping around the town.

00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:12.440
 She was getting booked.

00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:13.440
 Yeah.

00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:14.520
 So there's an idea that she did that.

00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:17.560
 It could be just, again, that she wanted to see the world because she kind of taught

00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:21.920
 her into going to the Grand Canyon and to, I don't know, Niagara Falls and places like

00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:22.920
 that.

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:23.920
 Yeah.

00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:27.920
 It sounds amazing as a trip because there weren't many, I mean, roads were really pretty

00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:33.200
 bad at the time and they had to do a lot of mending the motorbike as they went.

00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:34.480
 They had to have a gun.

00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:38.520
 They had to shoot at rattlesnakes and coyotes at various times.

00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:40.160
 I really like this detail of the journey.

00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:44.680
 They took with them a jar of water from the Atlantic Ocean so that they could pour it

00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:47.040
 into the Pacific Ocean when they got to California.

00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:48.040
 Wow.

00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:49.280
 Imagine if that had ruined everything.

00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:52.280
 Suddenly the ocean just exploded.

00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:54.280
 It starts to boil.

00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:57.440
 All the animals die float to the surface.

00:35:57.440 --> 00:35:58.440
 Fuck.

00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:03.280
 This is why we don't let women on motorbikes.

00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:07.960
 Once they had a puncture and they ran out of inner tube spares and so what they did

00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:12.640
 was they just got blankets and stuffed it into the wheels so that it would keep going.

00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:14.840
 So that was kind of how it was in those days.

00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:18.200
 Once you got to the Midwest, it was like you say, no roads.

00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:20.160
 It was pretty hard to get anywhere.

00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:21.160
 I like that.

00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:26.040
 It does sound like the mother, like she was there just to slow them down and keep on top

00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:30.080
 of speed but also it sounds like whenever they stopped and had to do stuff, she just

00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:31.560
 remained in the sidecar.

00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:36.580
 She just wasn't interested in getting out and at one point she was taught tatting which

00:36:36.580 --> 00:36:39.080
 is it's kind of like, you know, lace.

00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:45.640
 It's like weaving lace together and so she just tatted the whole way across America just

00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:49.320
 making these beautiful little pieces of fabric.

00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:50.320
 Yeah.

00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:51.320
 I mean maybe she couldn't get out.

00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:55.520
 She was a larger lady and an older lady presumably and the sidecar is quite low.

00:36:55.520 --> 00:37:00.720
 And maybe she was just too embarrassed to say all the way across, I really can't stand

00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:01.720
 up.

00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:07.200
 Well they really struggled to find a sidecar that fit, not just because of her but also

00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:08.920
 they had all of the gear as well, right?

00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:12.960
 They had absolutely tons of stuff and eventually what they called it was the bathtub, which

00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:14.840
 explains the size and shape of it.

00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:15.840
 It was a real big thing.

00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:17.760
 And because it had a jar of water in it.

00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:22.920
 She brought a gun with her as well.

00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:23.920
 Yeah.

00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:25.480
 It was standard, wasn't it?

00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:30.200
 It was completely standard equipment for just being, like traveling across America at the

00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:31.200
 time.

00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:32.200
 I think it's part of the course now.

00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:33.200
 To be honest guys.

00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:34.200
 Oh yeah, good point.

00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:37.120
 Yeah, I'd say that like it's a weird thing, yeah, of course.

00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:41.640
 The following year there were sisters, the Van Buren sisters, who did the same thing but

00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:46.240
 did it together, a bike to cross together, I think with no one in the sidecar.

00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:49.480
 And they did it to prove that women could be dispatch riders so that they could free up

00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:52.680
 men to fight in World War One.

00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:56.560
 So you know, trying to help and not only were they arrested multiple times on the way for

00:37:56.560 --> 00:38:00.440
 wearing men's clothes, they were then not accepted into the army.

00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:02.440
 For wearing, they were arrested not for doing anything else.

00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:05.600
 Yeah, in a lot of parts of America you weren't allowed to wear trousers if you were a woman.

00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:06.600
 Yeah.

00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:07.600
 Yeah, that's what they did them for.

00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:08.600
 Yeah.

00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:10.840
 But you can't wear a skirt because it blows up on a bike if one sees your pants.

00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:13.200
 So it's a rock and a hard place.

00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:14.200
 Yeah.

00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:17.320
 And they did not get accepted into the army at the end.

00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:20.240
 So a complete waste of time.

00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:23.960
 And there was Alice Hewler Ramsey, who drove a car.

00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:24.960
 This was not a motorbike.

00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:28.480
 She was the first woman to drive a car from coast to coast.

00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:31.880
 She did so with two of her sisters-in-law and a friend.

00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:33.080
 They went from one to the other.

00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:37.960
 And the headline in the San Francisco Chronicle the next day was, "Pretty women motorists

00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:40.440
 arrive after a trip across the continent."

00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:43.280
 And one of them was called Margaret Atwood.

00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:44.280
 No.

00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:45.280
 Really?

00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:48.480
 Not thee, but you know, still cool.

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:50.440
 She had a good trip, Alice Ramsey.

00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:54.280
 She had various obstacles along the way, but she wasn't really allowed to say so because

00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:58.400
 the reason she was doing it was because she was driving in a Maxwell Briscoe company car,

00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:00.400
 a Maxwell car.

00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:05.620
 And it was the company's idea for them to do it, to say, "Look, our car can drive even

00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:07.480
 a woman across America."

00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:11.560
 So even though it broke down various times along the way, and she had to fix it herself,

00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:14.800
 had to wait for mechanics to come out, in fact, she said there was an awkward moment

00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:20.040
 where they had to replace a coil, and they had to wait for a while for a coil.

00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:22.320
 When you say coil, you mean part of the car, right?

00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:23.320
 The coil in the car, yeah.

00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:27.040
 Reproductive technology wasn't that advanced back then.

00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:31.580
 But yeah, the crowd surrounded her and shunted, "Get a horse!"

00:39:31.580 --> 00:39:32.580
 Which is embarrassing.

00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:33.580
 Get a horse!

00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:36.440
 Get a horse, love!

00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:39.580
 And the horse lobby was a big one back then.

00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:43.960
 So another problem they found was they used guidebooks, which would just be lists of landmarks

00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:44.960
 to follow.

00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:48.680
 So they'd say things like, you know, take the big oak tree, get to the oak tree, turn

00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:51.440
 right along the white fence, et cetera.

00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:55.960
 And the problem was the landmarks used to change, and specifically there was a yellow

00:39:55.960 --> 00:40:01.360
 house and barn in their instructions, but the owner of it was a horse loyalist, hated

00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:08.320
 this new motor thing, and so he repainted his barn red, deliberately to send them off

00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:09.320
 the trail.

00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:10.320
 That's so funny.

00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:11.320
 Wow.

00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:12.320
 Amazingly, they made it.

00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:15.800
 And what they would do is, there were telephone lines there, weren't there?

00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:19.720
 And they would just follow whatever the telephone wires had the most wires on them.

00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:23.520
 They thought, "Well, that must be going towards a big town," and they kind of navigated through

00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:24.520
 the towns that way.

00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:25.520
 That's clever.

00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:26.520
 Smart.

00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:29.440
 Well, motorcyclists as well used to go on the railroad tracks, didn't they, when they

00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:32.800
 were just like, "Well, this will definitely just lead me to where, yeah."

00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:37.000
 And it's, you know, I'll just move when there's a train, but otherwise they'll get me there.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:38.720
 So are you reading about George Wyman?

00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:39.720
 Yeah, I think so.

00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:40.720
 Yeah.

00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:46.000
 So he was the first person to take a motorbike across America, 1903 this was, and it was

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:47.240
 basically a bike as well.

00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:48.520
 It wasn't really a motorbike.

00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:52.080
 It was a bike which had a motor on it, kind of like an e-bike, basically.

00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:53.080
 Yeah.

00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:54.080
 Yeah.

00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:59.800
 And he had a camera, he had a change of clothes and a gun, obviously, and it was so broken

00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:01.080
 down by the end of the journey.

00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:06.440
 His motor worked so badly that he had to cycle the last 150 miles, just pedaling his motorbike.

00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:12.000
 But he cycled on railroad tracks, but across the West, so you know, the sleepers, he was

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:17.680
 just cycling over the sleepers, bum, bum, bum, bum, but he miles and miles and miles.

00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:21.880
 And it's created a thing that you can do today, which I really like, which is called the Iron

00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:29.560
 Butt Association, and it's if you cycle, sorry, if you motorcycle a thousand miles in 24 hours

00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:30.560
 of riding.

00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:34.880
 Yeah, not if you, no one has ever cycled a thousand miles in 24 hours, but if you motorbike

00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:37.160
 like that, you get, you join the Iron Butt Association.

00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:38.160
 Yeah, that's really cool.

00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:39.160
 Yeah.

00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:41.080
 Do you guys hear of the first person to walk across America?

00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:42.080
 No.

00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:43.080
 No?

00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:44.080
 It's great.

00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:46.200
 In fact, it's someone we've mentioned on this podcast, friend of the podcast, I would

00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:51.480
 say, he's called Edward Payson-Weston, known as the Wiley Wobbler.

00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:53.680
 I can't remember.

00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:58.360
 He was the founder of pedestrianism, and he did all these walking challenges.

00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:02.760
 He would walk, you know, 500 miles in five days or whatever it was.

00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:03.760
 500 more.

00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:10.240
 He would walk, yeah, and he was the man who walked a thousand miles to turn up in California,

00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:12.000
 it turns out, walking across.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:17.120
 When you say he was a founder of pedestrianism, because it's not like everyone else was driving

00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:18.120
 a car until he came along.

00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:23.320
 No, it was in much the same way that William Smelly was the father of midwifery.

00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:26.320
 People had walked before, but he perfected it.

00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:27.320
 I see.

00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:28.320
 He perfected the form.

00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:29.320
 He got the tools.

00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:36.360
 America, for the first time, aged 70, and then he did it again, aged 71, and 500,000

00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:40.060
 people supposedly turned up to see him arrive in New York.

00:42:40.060 --> 00:42:41.060
 Big deal.

00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:42.060
 Oh my God.

00:42:42.060 --> 00:42:43.560
 He was world famous just for walking.

00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:48.740
 He walked across America when he was 70, which presumably would take about a year, and then

00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:49.740
 he walked it at 71.

00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:51.240
 Took him 100 days.

00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:52.240
 100 days only.

00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:53.240
 Yeah.

00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:54.240
 To walk America.

00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:55.240
 I know.

00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:56.240
 He was the Wiley Wobbler.

00:42:56.240 --> 00:42:57.240
 I knew he was Wiley.

00:42:57.240 --> 00:42:58.240
 He was the Wiley Wobbler.

00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:02.080
 And then he came to Britain and he walked all around Britain and people went nuts.

00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:03.760
 He must have found that piss easy.

00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:04.760
 He absolutely did.

00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:09.240
 Peter K. He walked 5,000 miles around Britain in 1884.

00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:10.240
 Get this.

00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:11.240
 I love this line.

00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:16.720
 "The Royal Society, very eminent body, announced that his feet is the greatest recorded labor

00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:20.280
 that any human being has ever undertaken without injury."

00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:21.280
 Right.

00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:22.280
 Imagine getting that accolade.

00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:25.240
 The feet were his feet, which it is.

00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:26.240
 His feet.

00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:28.880
 I'm surprised you can even get 5,000 miles around.

00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:30.200
 He must have gone right around the coast.

00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:31.200
 You got a webball.

00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:32.200
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:33.200
 You walk.

00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:34.200
 You do the...

00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:37.120
 I remember when I used to live by the coast, I used to go for a run in the morning and

00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:40.000
 I would run for 30 minutes along the coast.

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:43.920
 But because of fractal geometry, that meant that I'd gone an infinite distance.

00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:44.920
 All right.

00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:45.920
 Sure.

00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:49.720
 Just watch the mathematicians there.

00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:52.760
 Guys, we need to wrap up very soon.

00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:54.640
 Oh, really?

00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:55.640
 The Cannonball Run.

00:43:55.640 --> 00:43:56.640
 Do you know this?

00:43:56.640 --> 00:43:57.640
 The one thing?

00:43:57.640 --> 00:44:01.680
 Cannonball Run is the speed record across America for driving.

00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:08.200
 The current record is 25 hours and 55 minutes to drive from one side to the other.

00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:09.200
 What?

00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:14.400
 The record was beaten only four times between 2006 and 2019, and then it was beaten five

00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:16.880
 times in 2020.

00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:19.800
 Pretty quiet, yeah, for everybody.

00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:22.560
 Basically no police on the roads, no cars on the roads.

00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:24.320
 They could just go as fast as they wanted.

00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:26.600
 Yeah, it's very illegal, isn't it?

00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:31.280
 The average speed for that guy, Fred Ashmore, I think it's called, is 108 miles an hour.

00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:32.280
 Average speed.

00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:33.280
 Yeah.

00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:34.600
 It's insane.

00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:39.700
 The amount of logistics it takes to organise it, because they all have spot cars going

00:44:39.700 --> 00:44:41.920
 ahead to say if they see any police, don't they?

00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:42.920
 Exactly.

00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:44.440
 And he had to...

00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:49.400
 He removed all the seats in the car and he got an extra special kind of gasoline tank

00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:51.000
 so he could get more in.

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.960
 And this was a rental car.

00:44:52.960 --> 00:44:57.920
 Afterwards, he had to put it all back together again.

00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:03.280
 I love to be the guy at the rental place who's just recording the mileage on the car.

00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:05.400
 Oh, that's funny.

00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:10.360
 You rented this yesterday and it's got 3,000 miles more.

00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:16.320
 The first all-female motorcycling stunt group in the UK was called the Motobirds.

00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:20.360
 They were formed in Leicester in the '70s, and every year they would try and jump over

00:45:20.360 --> 00:45:23.480
 a river in Leicester, and they always failed.

00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:25.420
 They could never quite get it working.

00:45:25.420 --> 00:45:29.520
 And then one time, the final time they tried it, they really souped up their motorbike.

00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:34.120
 They jumped over, landed on the other side of the river in the net, bounced out of the

00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:36.360
 net and back into the river.

00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:40.040
 Look, guys, we need to wrap up.

00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:41.520
 Okay, that is it.

00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:42.800
 That is all of our facts.

00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:44.520
