00:00:14,00:00:19,">> Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,"
00:00:19,00:00:24,a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Peterborough.
00:00:24,00:00:28,>> [APPLAUSE]
00:00:28,00:00:30,>> My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:30,00:00:35,"I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin."
00:00:35,00:00:39,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite"
00:00:39,00:00:41,facts from the last seven days.
00:00:41,00:00:45,"And in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:45,00:00:48,"Starting with fact number one, and that's my fact."
00:00:48,00:00:54,My fact this week is that the man known as the father of British midwifery
00:00:54,00:00:56,was called Willie Smelly.
00:00:56,00:00:59,>> [LAUGH]
00:00:59,00:01:00,>> So childish.
00:01:00,00:01:01,>> Childish.
00:01:01,00:01:07,">> Willie Smelly, so Willie Smelly, he lived between 1697 and 1763."
00:01:07,00:01:13,"He was a Scottish obstetrician, obstetrician, obstetrician."
00:01:13,00:01:15,">> Sure, I'm sure James can make one of those work in the edit."
00:01:15,00:01:18,>> [LAUGH]
00:01:18,00:01:23,">> He lived in London and he was basically, obviously midwifery was going on for"
00:01:23,00:01:24,thousands and thousands of years.
00:01:24,00:01:28,But he was the first male who was allowed sort of into the game.
00:01:28,00:01:32,And he did quite a lot of things to sort of turn it into somewhere that was a bit
00:01:32,00:01:33,more safer for having babies.
00:01:33,00:01:37,He sort of helped to advance the use of forceps with some designs.
00:01:37,00:01:39,And he was a very important figure in that world.
00:01:39,00:01:42,">> He designed a mannequin, didn't he?"
00:01:42,00:01:46,That would let you learn how to deliver a baby.
00:01:46,00:01:51,"It was known as the mock woman, or sometimes this most curious machine."
00:01:51,00:01:55,It had legs and feet that would have shoes and stockings on it.
00:01:55,00:01:56,So that made it quite realistic.
00:01:56,00:01:57,>> Cool.
00:01:57,00:02:02,>> There was an anatomist called Robert Campbell who said he could scarcely tell
00:02:02,00:02:04,the difference between the machine and a real live woman.
00:02:04,00:02:06,>> [LAUGH]
00:02:06,00:02:07,>> Wow.
00:02:07,00:02:08,>> This machine didn't have a head.
00:02:08,00:02:10,>> Yeah.
00:02:10,00:02:12,">> It sounds terrifying, it really does."
00:02:12,00:02:16,It had a stomach that was full of leather.
00:02:16,00:02:17,>> Right.
00:02:17,00:02:19,>> Which I think represented the baby.
00:02:19,00:02:22,">> Well, there's a little wax doll in there as well, also a baby."
00:02:22,00:02:24,"And it had a bladder which you could fill up,"
00:02:24,00:02:28,"which was helpful with a little cork stopper, like the real female bladder."
00:02:28,00:02:30,>> [LAUGH]
00:02:30,00:02:31,>> So you could break the water.
00:02:31,00:02:32,Was that the idea?
00:02:32,00:02:33,">> I don't know, maybe."
00:02:33,00:02:35,>> Was that for breaking the water?
00:02:35,00:02:38,">> Yeah, we sometimes use real bones and real skeletons."
00:02:38,00:02:41,I think he made at least four of these weird robot women.
00:02:41,00:02:46,"And for one of them, yeah, he used actual, he made ligaments and muscles and"
00:02:46,00:02:51,"they moved like real people and used an actual skeleton of a mother and baby, I think."
00:02:51,00:02:55,">> And he used to use real people as well, as in pregnant women."
00:02:55,00:02:58,And he used to have a thing because he was very good at his job as well.
00:02:58,00:03:01,So a lot of people wanted him to be the midwife for the job.
00:03:01,00:03:05,"And so he would say, I'll do it for free, I'll wave my feet if I can do it in front"
00:03:05,00:03:10,of all my students and they can observe and I can do a sort of lecture as I'm doing it.
00:03:10,00:03:13,>> I do wonder though if you want your midwife to be focused mostly on
00:03:13,00:03:15,"delivering the child, not on delivering a good lecture."
00:03:15,00:03:18,"If they want to deliver one thing well, you want it to be the child."
00:03:18,00:03:21,">> Yeah, today's lecture is what not to do during birth."
00:03:21,00:03:22,>> What?
00:03:22,00:03:24,">> Stop the birth, stop the birth."
00:03:24,00:03:29,"Hi everybody, just wanted to let you know today's birth is sponsored by Hello Fresh."
00:03:29,00:03:33,">> This model, we don't have any of them anymore."
00:03:33,00:03:35,They've all disappeared and we don't know where they are.
00:03:35,00:03:37,We have a few others from around the same time.
00:03:37,00:03:40,There's one in France called the Boudin Pinard model.
00:03:40,00:03:42,And that was kind of similar.
00:03:42,00:03:43,It was made of rubber.
00:03:43,00:03:48,It had a vaginal opening with a thumb screw so you could make it bigger and smaller.
00:03:48,00:03:50,>> Some of them work like that actually.
00:03:50,00:03:55,"Yeah, the non-cork, the cheaper vaginas come just with the screw top."
00:03:55,00:04:02,>> This one also had a rubber rectum and the rubber rectum was there because there
00:04:02,00:04:08,was something called the Rittgen manoeuvre and one version of doing that is the midwife
00:04:08,00:04:13,would put her fingers up the bum of the mother and then they would kind of manoeuvre the
00:04:13,00:04:16,head a little bit if it was in the wrong place and it would stop the perineum from
00:04:16,00:04:18,getting in trouble.
00:04:18,00:04:24,This Rittgen manoeuvre evolved from a technique from the ancient Greeks.
00:04:24,00:04:27,It was first proposed by a Greek physician called Sauranus.
00:04:27,00:04:28,>> No.
00:04:28,00:04:29,Very nice.
00:04:29,00:04:30,Unbelievable.
00:04:30,00:04:31,>> Sauranus of Ephesus.
00:04:31,00:04:40,>> Can you have an alternative determinism when the words won't mean that for another
00:04:40,00:04:44,year.
00:04:44,00:04:52,">> He was controversial, William Smelly, because men weren't allowed into the midwifery game"
00:04:52,00:04:57,and male midwives were seen as controversial when they started practicing and they had
00:04:57,00:05:03,to work by touch because there was a risk they would see something indecent so some of
00:05:03,00:05:08,them had to kind of work with a sheet in between them and the delivery.
00:05:08,00:05:13,">> I think even up until the 19th century, any men working on the female body, and by"
00:05:13,00:05:17,"the 19th century it was all men, women had sort of been edged out of the practice, were"
00:05:17,00:05:23,encouraged not to look directly at a woman's private part so obstetricians were told.
00:05:23,00:05:25,>> Like the son.
00:05:25,00:05:30,>> Obstetricians had specific instructions that to reassure a female patient they're
00:05:30,00:05:34,"not looking at a private part, they should gaze into the distance or maintain constant"
00:05:34,00:05:36,eye contact with her.
00:05:36,00:05:40,">> What a stressful situation, giving birth already, very, very, very stressful."
00:05:40,00:05:43,"Imagine seeing your medical team walk in, they're all in blindfolds, some of them are"
00:05:43,00:05:45,looking at the mountain over there.
00:05:45,00:05:47,>> One of them just staring you straight in the face.
00:05:47,00:05:53,>> Do you put the fingers at the bum like it's put the tail in the donkey?
00:05:53,00:05:55,>> Oh my God.
00:05:55,00:05:58,">> And it was really controversial for the men to come in, wasn't it?"
00:05:58,00:06:03,"Because before that all of the midwifery was done by women, there was someone called Elizabeth"
00:06:03,00:06:07,Nihel who was writing in the 18th century who really thought that this was a terrible
00:06:07,00:06:08,idea.
00:06:08,00:06:11,She thought that basically all the men had come in and they were finding problems that
00:06:11,00:06:16,weren't there and the best way to do it was to be a natural birth and you're getting all
00:06:16,00:06:20,these forceps in but if you just leave it it will probably be fine in most cases and
00:06:20,00:06:25,she said that a lot of the surgeons were coming in and they were being fast tracked to become
00:06:25,00:06:30,"a midwife and people like William Smelly were trying to teach them really, really quickly"
00:06:30,00:06:35,"and like barbers, tailors and pork butchers were coming in to become midwives in a short"
00:06:35,00:06:36,period of time.
00:06:36,00:06:38,">> Gosh, you would ask, wouldn't you?"
00:06:38,00:06:39,>> What was your previous career?
00:06:39,00:06:46,">> The men were called, when they started becoming midwives, they were called either man midwife"
00:06:46,00:06:52,or he midwife and the masters of the universe.
00:06:52,00:07:00,">> It kind of doesn't work because midwife, the actual term itself, it literally means"
00:07:00,00:07:06,with wife so you are the mid to the wife.
00:07:06,00:07:09,That was just an extra bit of word you didn't need.
00:07:09,00:07:14,Everyone is a midwife if you're helping give birth.
00:07:14,00:07:19,">> You said that William Smelly, he developed the forceps which was one of his main contributions"
00:07:19,00:07:23,"so he didn't invent it, he made it better, I guess you can all picture what a forceps"
00:07:23,00:07:27,"is in birth, it's sort of like a pair of scissors but instead of the scissor bits you have like"
00:07:27,00:07:28,a clamp.
00:07:28,00:07:31,>> It's more like a pair of asparagus tongs.
00:07:31,00:07:32,>> It's like that.
00:07:32,00:07:36,">> Man of the people, Andrew Huntsmurray."
00:07:36,00:07:39,>> Or like two eyelash curlers clamp together.
00:07:39,00:07:42,>> More like that but gigantic ones for a giant.
00:07:42,00:07:44,>> To clamp onto a child's head.
00:07:44,00:07:50,>> He developed forceps which were only used in 2% of childbirth even then so it's weird
00:07:50,00:07:56,that it was so revolutionary but forceps before that the design was a complete secret from
00:07:56,00:08:00,"all the hundred years so there was this one family that invented them, the Chamberlain"
00:08:00,00:08:05,family and from the mid 16th to the mid 17th century over five generations they had to
00:08:05,00:08:09,keep it completely secret so they had this elaborate ceremony when they arrived at the
00:08:09,00:08:13,"house of a woman in labour they'd arrive in this big carriage, they'd have this massive"
00:08:13,00:08:17,"wooden box that had all like carvings all over it, it would take two people to carry"
00:08:17,00:08:21,"the forceps in, no one was allowed to see inside, it looked like it was some gigantic"
00:08:21,00:08:26,"instrument, no one else is allowed in the room when the woman's giving birth and then"
00:08:26,00:08:30,they'd make weird noises like ringing bells and making weird sounds so the people outside
00:08:30,00:08:34,the door thought what is this amazing instrument?
00:08:34,00:08:35,>> Wow.
00:08:35,00:08:36,>> No one knew.
00:08:36,00:08:39,>> I read that sometimes they blindfolded the woman giving birth.
00:08:39,00:08:44,>> Could anyone see in the room?
00:08:44,00:08:48,>> Blind man's muff was what they called it.
00:08:48,00:08:49,>> Wow.
00:08:49,00:08:50,>> Wow.
00:08:50,00:08:54,">> Yeah, they were two brothers weren't they, the Chamberlains, both called Peter."
00:08:54,00:08:55,>> Yes.
00:08:55,00:08:56,>> So weird.
00:08:56,00:08:57,>> So weird.
00:08:57,00:09:01,>> We should say there's another controversial thing about Willie Smelly which is that it
00:09:01,00:09:08,turns out he might have been a serial killer and the four of us discovered this very late
00:09:08,00:09:14,"in our research, it really feels like his name has buried the headline throughout history."
00:09:14,00:09:19,">> I don't think it's even worth mentioning, you know, you do one dodgy thing."
00:09:19,00:09:23,">> Yeah, but no, it turns out apparently quite a serial number of dodgy things here."
00:09:23,00:09:26,>> You do a series of dodgy things.
00:09:26,00:09:27,>> Yeah.
00:09:27,00:09:30,>> And the idea was that he and another guy called John Hunter I think wanted to be the
00:09:30,00:09:36,best midwives and wanted to kind of become famous for their new techniques and so they
00:09:36,00:09:41,"needed people to test it out on and in the kind of Burke and Hare kind of style, they"
00:09:41,00:09:44,knocked people off so that they could get their cadavers.
00:09:44,00:09:50,">> Called Birking in fact, I don't know, which seems like, where's hair gone in that verb?"
00:09:50,00:09:53,"All the papers talk about it as, you know, he was part of a bit of Birking."
00:09:53,00:09:57,">> I think Hare's like, it's cool, I'm very happy with it."
00:09:57,00:09:58,>> Is it definitive?
00:09:58,00:10:02,"It seems like there's a lot, I guess, I mean, he wasn't tried, so it's never been, it's"
00:10:02,00:10:05,"hard to kind of know for certain certain, but it does seem like there's lots of circumstantial"
00:10:05,00:10:10,"evidence of people not asking, you know, even not asking questions about where the bodies"
00:10:10,00:10:12,"are coming from, that kind of thing."
00:10:12,00:10:16,">> I think it's quite, there was someone at the time who raised it during his lifetime"
00:10:16,00:10:21,"and he almost stopped practicing for a while just because he thought, you know, either"
00:10:21,00:10:26,"the rumor is becoming too prevalent amongst people or it was true and I better stop, we"
00:10:26,00:10:32,"don't know which, but it's come up more recently that someone has gone through all of the lists"
00:10:32,00:10:37,of women that he had access to and how did he get that many women and it kind of seems
00:10:37,00:10:41,"like all the academics who love him, because he was so influential, there were hospitals"
00:10:41,00:10:47,"named after him that have since closed, but up until 1992, wouldn't you go to the Willy"
00:10:47,00:10:50,Smelly hospital?
00:10:50,00:10:55,"But so it seems that there's, someone has written this paper and a lot of academics have looked"
00:10:55,00:11:01,"at it and gone, yeah, it's very compelling, damn it, because they love him so much and"
00:11:01,00:11:04,they almost don't want to look at it but it looks like it could be true.
00:11:04,00:11:12,">> So on midwives who aren't serial killers, there were some, the job of a midwife sometimes"
00:11:12,00:11:17,"entailed giving women orgasms, this was, so there was this belief from basically from"
00:11:17,00:11:21,"ancient Greece until the early 19th century that, you know, in the 19th century everything"
00:11:21,00:11:25,"got very buttoned up and no one was supposed to enjoy anything anymore, but before that"
00:11:25,00:11:29,everyone thought that it was damaging for women if they didn't have orgasms frequently
00:11:29,00:11:34,"enough and Galen, you know, the ancient physician said that women would suffer from limb aches"
00:11:34,00:11:38,and things like that due to the build up of female generative fluids within.
00:11:38,00:11:44,"And so in the 16th century a doctor called Forestus, a Dutch doctor said that women should"
00:11:44,00:11:47,employ midwives to manually stimulate them on a regular basis if they weren't getting
00:11:47,00:11:48,enough sex.
00:11:48,00:11:49,>> Fair enough.
00:11:49,00:11:50,>> Absolutely fair enough.
00:11:50,00:11:55,">> The midwife's coming around again, darling, are you sure?"
00:11:55,00:11:58,I didn't even know you were expecting a baby.
00:11:58,00:12:00,>> I will be soon.
00:12:00,00:12:07,">> Yeah, the idea with Galen was that he thought that a woman would have exactly the same genitals"
00:12:07,00:12:09,"as a man, but just inside out."
00:12:09,00:12:14,And so that was why the man needed to orgasm in order to create the seeds so the women would
00:12:14,00:12:15,have to do the same.
00:12:15,00:12:16,That was the idea.
00:12:16,00:12:21,He thought also if a woman got too hot that her genitals would fall outside of her body
00:12:21,00:12:24,and she'd turn into a man.
00:12:24,00:12:32,"So it's not true, that's not true, just busting another myth."
00:12:32,00:12:37,>> Did you know that some midwives are hamsters?
00:12:37,00:12:39,>> What's this?
00:12:39,00:12:40,It's a person called a hamster.
00:12:40,00:12:41,">> No, it's not."
00:12:41,00:12:42,I'm not doing it.
00:12:42,00:12:45,">> If this is what the NHS has resulted to, then it does mean more funding."
00:12:45,00:12:48,>> There's a specific kind of hamster called a Jungarian hamster.
00:12:48,00:12:53,"The paternal hamster, the dad, will mechanically assist the delivery."
00:12:53,00:12:59,She will help the mother give birth to the litter of baby hamsters and does a proper
00:12:59,00:13:09,"job like will consume the amniotic fluid, tick, proper good service here, eat the placenta"
00:13:09,00:13:10,to...
00:13:10,00:13:12,">> Finger up the bum, orgasm for the woman."
00:13:12,00:13:15,>> They'll even open the baby's airways by licking its nostrils.
00:13:15,00:13:16,So that is...
00:13:16,00:13:18,>> They're not the only animals that do it.
00:13:18,00:13:21,So we know that some monkeys do it as well.
00:13:21,00:13:22,They like to perform that.
00:13:22,00:13:25,"In some cases, bats have been observed doing it as well."
00:13:25,00:13:30,"So there's a biologist called Thomas Kuntz, and he lives in Florida."
00:13:30,00:13:33,"Hey, listen."
00:13:33,00:13:40,"Just because we've had soaring as Willie Smelly, Kuntz doesn't need to be lumped in there."
00:13:40,00:13:41,"So basically, he was in the lab..."
00:13:41,00:13:45,>> Must be so hard for a bat to give birth because you're upside down.
00:13:45,00:13:46,>> No.
00:13:46,00:13:47,"You're like, ""Push, push."""
00:13:47,00:13:48,>> I'm trying.
00:13:48,00:13:49,>> Exactly.
00:13:49,00:13:50,You're meant to flip the other way.
00:13:50,00:13:55,"So he was in his lab, and suddenly, there was all this drama because a bat was in distress,"
00:13:55,00:14:00,"and another bat kind of flew over and was like, ""Hey, come on, gotta help the bat out."""
00:14:00,00:14:06,"And so she flies back, and they go and observe it, and this other bat, who's not related"
00:14:06,00:14:08,"by blood, gets next to this bat."
00:14:08,00:14:12,"So bats actually do flip upside down to give birth, so they're on their feet."
00:14:12,00:14:14,"But this bat was upside down, still hanging."
00:14:14,00:14:18,"So this other bat flipped upside down and started going, ""Ugh!"""
00:14:18,00:14:19,To show this other bat.
00:14:19,00:14:23,">> You know, you've used upside down to mean both the right way up and upside down on multiple"
00:14:23,00:14:26,"occasions, and no one has any idea."
00:14:26,00:14:31,">> Okay, so the non-pregnant bat has flipped onto its legs the wrong way around, and it's"
00:14:31,00:14:32,"going, ""Ugh!"""
00:14:32,00:14:37,And straining and showing the upside down bat how it should be done.
00:14:37,00:14:40,"And then the upside bat goes, ""Oh, okay, flips over."""
00:14:40,00:14:47,And then the bat not pregnant starts licking the genitals of the bat to sort of help lubricate
00:14:47,00:14:48,it.
00:14:48,00:14:49,So awkward there's a kid in the front row.
00:14:49,00:14:50,I'm really...
00:14:50,00:14:54,It's trying to work out how to say what I needed to say here.
00:14:54,00:14:58,">> I think what happened there was about five minutes ago, you worked out what you were"
00:14:58,00:14:59,going to have to say.
00:14:59,00:15:02,"You're like, ""I'm just going to keep saying upside down until it stops."""
00:15:02,00:15:05,">> Look, we need to move on to our next fact."
00:15:05,00:15:09,"It is time for fact number two, and that is Andy."
00:15:09,00:15:15,>> My fact is that there is a town in Mexico where one person in ten is a dentist.
00:15:15,00:15:18,>> I know what you're thinking.
00:15:18,00:15:19,Sounds about normal.
00:15:19,00:15:20,"You know, sounds like a roughly normal ratio."
00:15:20,00:15:21,It's not.
00:15:21,00:15:22,It's not at all.
00:15:22,00:15:29,"It's called Los Algodones, and it is the dentistry capital maybe of the world, certainly of Mexico."
00:15:29,00:15:34,"It's got 350 dentists in it, but that is one person in ten there."
00:15:34,00:15:35,>> So who are they...
00:15:35,00:15:39,"Well, surely if there's not many people, who are they actually dentists drinking?"
00:15:39,00:15:40,>> Each other.
00:15:40,00:15:41,Each other.
00:15:41,00:15:42,Got no teeth left?
00:15:42,00:15:43,"No, no, no."
00:15:43,00:15:44,It's not that.
00:15:44,00:15:45,So it's a huge place for health tourism.
00:15:45,00:15:49,"So people who don't have dental insurance in the USA will travel, because it's very"
00:15:49,00:15:52,near the border with the United States.
00:15:52,00:15:57,"But just to give you an idea of how weird this proportion is, one person in ten."
00:15:57,00:16:03,"So they have to look after 320 teeth each, right?"
00:16:03,00:16:08,"Because you know, one person is, I know I'm sort of assuming there's no health tourism now,"
00:16:08,00:16:10,but that would be 320 teeth each.
00:16:10,00:16:14,"In the UK, each dentist has to look after about 53,000 teeth."
00:16:14,00:16:15,>> Right.
00:16:15,00:16:16,I know.
00:16:16,00:16:17,">> Wow, that's quality."
00:16:17,00:16:18,That's certainly true.
00:16:18,00:16:19,">> It's less than one tooth a day, isn't it?"
00:16:19,00:16:20,"That's, you know..."
00:16:20,00:16:21,>> Absolutely.
00:16:21,00:16:22,>> They can spend a day and a bit on every single tooth.
00:16:22,00:16:23,>> Yeah.
00:16:23,00:16:24,"Yeah, yeah."
00:16:24,00:16:27,They've got 200 times as many dentists per head of population in the town.
00:16:27,00:16:33,">> Los Algodones is only four square blocks in size, and the population is about 40 times"
00:16:33,00:16:37,"smaller than just to take a random city, Peterborough."
00:16:37,00:16:38,>> Wow.
00:16:38,00:16:39,Makes me think.
00:16:39,00:16:44,">> It's also extremely sunny, sunniest place on Earth."
00:16:44,00:16:45,So great dental care.
00:16:45,00:16:46,>> On Earth.
00:16:46,00:16:47,>> On Earth.
00:16:47,00:16:51,"Well, the sunniest place on Earth is Yuma, which is just on the other side of the border."
00:16:51,00:16:53,"I mean, literally a 20-minute drive away, less."
00:16:53,00:16:56,So I think it can also be called the sunniest place on Earth.
00:16:56,00:16:57,>> That's amazing.
00:16:57,00:17:00,">> Yeah, it gets 305 sunny blue sky days a year."
00:17:00,00:17:01,>> Wow.
00:17:01,00:17:05,">> Interestingly, the best way to get there from the sunniest place is through a place"
00:17:05,00:17:06,called The Gap.
00:17:06,00:17:08,So if you've got teeth problems...
00:17:08,00:17:09,>> I love it.
00:17:09,00:17:14,>> ...but The Gap is just what they call a huge hole in Donald Trump's wall.
00:17:14,00:17:15,">> Oh, really?"
00:17:15,00:17:20,">> I thought if anyone can fill in a gap, it's the town of Dentist next to it."
00:17:20,00:17:26,"I was reading a bit about dental tourism generally, and dental holiday package deals are just"
00:17:26,00:17:28,"a bound, if anyone's interested."
00:17:28,00:17:34,"I didn't realise this, but you go online to dentalholiday.co.uk, and for £3,200, you"
00:17:34,00:17:39,"can get a trip to Slovakia, which includes a Pampadere hot spring spa island, a return"
00:17:39,00:17:44,"boat trip down the Danube, and eight crowns or veneers."
00:17:44,00:17:45,>> Wow.
00:17:45,00:17:46,>> It's not bizarre.
00:17:46,00:17:47,>> Sounds great.
00:17:47,00:17:52,">> And it was actually, it was a weird thing in COVID earlier on this year."
00:17:52,00:17:57,"In Ireland, I said Ireland had specific travel bans which allowed for health tourism, but"
00:17:57,00:18:03,"you couldn't go just on holiday, and suddenly people going to Tenerife rocketed, and it"
00:18:03,00:18:07,"turns out they also have quite a lot of dentists in Tenerife, and a study found that 40% of"
00:18:07,00:18:12,people travelling from Dublin airport on flights had a letter from a dentist in Tenerife.
00:18:12,00:18:13,>> Right.
00:18:13,00:18:15,">> Yeah, yeah, this person definitely deserves dental treatment."
00:18:15,00:18:16,They need to come here.
00:18:16,00:18:17,>> That's amazing.
00:18:17,00:18:18,>> Right.
00:18:18,00:18:22,>> Have you guys heard of the big Thomas?
00:18:22,00:18:23,>> The big Thomas?
00:18:23,00:18:24,>> Yeah.
00:18:24,00:18:26,>> That sounds like a euphemism for something.
00:18:26,00:18:27,">> It does, doesn't it?"
00:18:27,00:18:32,">> Well, he was a French man, and his name actually was, his name was Jean Thomas, which"
00:18:32,00:18:35,"is a euphemism for something, but that's not what, that joke wasn't known at the time,"
00:18:35,00:18:36,so he would have been fine.
00:18:36,00:18:40,">> Neither was Soranus, but it's still funny."
00:18:40,00:18:46,">> He was a dentist in Paris in the 18th century, and he was, for 50 years, a massive fixture"
00:18:46,00:18:51,"on the Pont Neuf Bridge, and he was the most famous dentist in Paris."
00:18:51,00:18:56,"He was this huge guy, and he, if you couldn't get your tooth out, he would lift the patient"
00:18:56,00:19:00,in the air by the tooth to try and get it out.
00:19:00,00:19:02,He was incredible.
00:19:02,00:19:07,"His motto was, ""Dentem Synon Maxillam,"" the tooth, and if not the tooth, the jaw."
00:19:07,00:19:15,"I, I'm getting something incredible, incredible guy."
00:19:15,00:19:18,He was in an opera as a comic character.
00:19:18,00:19:22,He was called the honor of the universe and the terror of the human jaw.
00:19:22,00:19:25,"He was quite, quite the man."
00:19:25,00:19:28,He was once pranked by a group of medical students who attached four rockets to the
00:19:28,00:19:33,"underside of his cart, because he had a sort of, you know, wheeled surgery, basically,"
00:19:33,00:19:36,"and then when he was in the middle of extracting a tooth, they let off the rockets, and the"
00:19:36,00:19:39,"cart blew up, and he fell over on the patient, and that was-"
00:19:39,00:19:40,>> And what about the patient?
00:19:40,00:19:42,>> It doesn't say what happened to the patient.
00:19:42,00:19:47,"That was, that was the equivalent of, you know, Beatles about or whatever, in 18th century"
00:19:47,00:19:48,Paris.
00:19:48,00:19:50,>> I reckon there were a lot of people with only half a jaw in that town who were very
00:19:50,00:19:53,much behind the medical students during that prank.
00:19:53,00:19:54,">> Yeah, yeah."
00:19:54,00:19:57,">> But was that in the 1700s, you say, because that was when becoming a tooth puller became"
00:19:57,00:20:02,"such a lucrative industry suddenly, because sugar consumption quadrupled, I think, in"
00:20:02,00:20:06,"that century, and so suddenly people's teeth were rotten all over the place, and they used"
00:20:06,00:20:11,"a thing called a pelican, which was shaped like a pelican beak, and it clamped onto your"
00:20:11,00:20:15,"tooth and gum, and then you leave it out, you kind of twisted the tooth out, and it"
00:20:15,00:20:16,came out.
00:20:16,00:20:19,>> I saw a pelican in the park the other day.
00:20:19,00:20:20,>> Amazing.
00:20:20,00:20:21,">> Great story, Andy."
00:20:21,00:20:23,">> No, but they are surprisingly huge."
00:20:23,00:20:24,>> Yeah.
00:20:24,00:20:25,>> They are.
00:20:25,00:20:26,>> You've seen a pelican in the flesh?
00:20:26,00:20:27,">> I have seen them, yeah."
00:20:27,00:20:31,">> These were smaller than, they were not the size of actual pelicans."
00:20:31,00:20:32,">> I understand, yeah, yeah."
00:20:32,00:20:33,>> As you were.
00:20:33,00:20:34,>> Yeah.
00:20:34,00:20:35,">> Nonetheless, guys, check it out."
00:20:35,00:20:38,"If you Google pelican length, you're going to be surprised."
00:20:38,00:20:42,Thank God you didn't let James cut you off from the rest of that story.
00:20:42,00:20:43,>> Sorry.
00:20:43,00:20:47,>> Do you know that your dentist can tell if you're scared of them?
00:20:47,00:20:50,">> Because you say, you're shaking with fear, you're trying to run away."
00:20:50,00:20:52,">> Even if you're kind of fronting up, they can tell."
00:20:52,00:20:53,">> Oh, really?"
00:20:53,00:20:56,">> And it's bad news as well, because it can make them fuck up."
00:20:56,00:20:57,>> Oh.
00:20:57,00:21:02,">> Because this study, and what they did was they gave students some t-shirts and they"
00:21:02,00:21:07,kind of either gave them a really stressful exam or they gave them a really calm lecture.
00:21:07,00:21:10,"I don't know what a calm lecture is, but they gave them one anyway."
00:21:10,00:21:14,And then they put the t-shirts on mannequins and they got the dentist to do some dental
00:21:14,00:21:15,work on them.
00:21:15,00:21:21,"And they found that the dentist who were doing work on the ones with sweaty, scared t-shirts"
00:21:21,00:21:23,did a much worse job.
00:21:23,00:21:27,They sometimes would like damage the neighboring teeth when they were trying to get one out.
00:21:27,00:21:28,They put another one out.
00:21:28,00:21:29,">> Oh, really?"
00:21:29,00:21:30,>> So they can smell fear?
00:21:30,00:21:32,>> They can smell fear.
00:21:32,00:21:34,>> That makes me more scared of them.
00:21:34,00:21:38,">> And then that's going to make them even worse, which makes you even more scared."
00:21:38,00:21:41,">> Well, this is what I haven't been for 10 years, James."
00:21:41,00:21:42,Gosh.
00:21:42,00:21:45,>> You don't need to go as often as they say.
00:21:45,00:21:46,">> Oh, wow."
00:21:46,00:21:47,Okay.
00:21:47,00:21:50,">> I mean, I, too, am more of a once a decade, once a recovery, a couple of decades kind of"
00:21:50,00:21:54,"gal, and that's probably not often enough, but how often do most dentists recommend you"
00:21:54,00:21:55,go?
00:21:55,00:21:56,>> Once every six months?
00:21:56,00:22:01,"75% of dentists in America say every six months, that has no basis in scientific fact."
00:22:01,00:22:05,"That's been around since the 18th century, and actually, the NHS recommends that for"
00:22:05,00:22:08,"children, it should be kind of once a year, and for adults, you should be okay going every"
00:22:08,00:22:09,two years.
00:22:09,00:22:10,">> Oh, okay."
00:22:10,00:22:11,>> So there you go.
00:22:11,00:22:12,>> Nice.
00:22:12,00:22:13,That's pretty encouraging.
00:22:13,00:22:18,>> The first woman who was a member of the British Dental Association was this really
00:22:18,00:22:20,cool girl called Lillian Lindsay.
00:22:20,00:22:24,"I was reading about her, it was, I think it was sort of towards the end of the 19th century,"
00:22:24,00:22:29,"and she did it because she sort of made a throwaway rebellious mark to her headmistress,"
00:22:29,00:22:32,and she became one of the leading dentists in the country.
00:22:32,00:22:36,"She was head of the British Dental Journal, president of the British Dental Association."
00:22:36,00:22:40,"She was like Britain's leading dentist by the 1930s, 1940s."
00:22:40,00:22:43,"The reason she became a dentist was because she was at school, and I had a headmistress"
00:22:43,00:22:47,"called her into her office and said, ""Look, Lillian, I think you're destined to be a"
00:22:47,00:22:53,"teacher of deaf and dumb people,"" and Lillian said, ""I absolutely refuse to be a teacher,"""
00:22:53,00:22:56,"and the headmistress said, ""Then I will prevent you from doing anything else."""
00:22:56,00:23:01,"Very interesting teaching style back in the Victorian age, and so Lillian replied straight"
00:23:01,00:23:05,"away in her words, she said, ""Like a flash,"" I replied, ""You cannot prevent me from being"
00:23:05,00:23:10,"a dentist,"" and then she immediately realized, knowing nothing of dentistry, having stated"
00:23:10,00:23:15,"that boldly, she would have to become a dentist, and she did, and she kept on not being allowed."
00:23:15,00:23:20,"When she applied to the National Dental Hospital, she had to do her interview outside on the"
00:23:20,00:23:23,pavement because the dean who was interviewing her said that she would distract all the men
00:23:23,00:23:26,in there too much if she came inside.
00:23:26,00:23:27,Oh my God.
00:23:27,00:23:28,Yeah.
00:23:28,00:23:29,Tough.
00:23:29,00:23:30,Right.
00:23:30,00:23:32,It was a bit easier to become a dentist in Mexico back in the day.
00:23:32,00:23:37,"The first female dentist in Mexico was Margarita Chornees Salazar, and she's actually the"
00:23:37,00:23:43,"first woman in Latin America to get a university diploma in anything, if it was in dentistry."
00:23:43,00:23:48,"But to get her degree in dentistry, she needed a letter from her dentist saying that she knew"
00:23:48,00:23:51,how to be a dentist.
00:23:51,00:23:53,That's so good.
00:23:53,00:23:57,"Well, the truth is that she had been practicing, I think, someone else in her family had been"
00:23:57,00:24:02,"a dentist, and when they couldn't do it, she would do the work, and then she was like,"
00:24:02,00:24:05,"""Well, I should get a degree for this because I do know how to do it,"" and they said, ""Well,"
00:24:05,00:24:06,where's your evidence?
00:24:06,00:24:07,"Here's a letter."""
00:24:07,00:24:08,Right.
00:24:08,00:24:09,That's amazing.
00:24:09,00:24:11,It's weird because I don't think that my dentist would be a good judge of how good a dentist
00:24:11,00:24:12,I would be.
00:24:12,00:24:17,"I took mild curiosity about the procedures, but it's not enough."
00:24:17,00:24:23,"You know, when you're training to be a dentist, you have to work on something called a phantom"
00:24:23,00:24:29,"head, and it's just the name they provide for the head mannequin."
00:24:29,00:24:33,"That birthing device mannequin was also a phantom, wasn't it?"
00:24:33,00:24:35,I think phantom just meant something that was not real.
00:24:35,00:24:37,But didn't we say the mannequin was missing a head?
00:24:37,00:24:40,"Yeah, I think this sounds like it was the head, too, in Willie Smelly's body."
00:24:40,00:24:41,I think that's it.
00:24:41,00:24:42,"Yeah, yeah."
00:24:42,00:24:44,"But you used to have to provide your own teeth, not your own teeth."
00:24:44,00:24:49,You had to provide teeth for the phantom head.
00:24:49,00:24:50,Where did you get those from?
00:24:50,00:24:51,I don't know.
00:24:51,00:24:54,"Imagine if your first dentist or you went into the room and said, ""Okay, we're going"
00:24:54,00:24:58,"to extract all of your teeth, of course, because put them in this mannequin."""
00:24:58,00:24:59,What?
00:24:59,00:25:00,Yeah.
00:25:00,00:25:04,"But I spoke to a dentist about this, and she confirmed that since the passing of the"
00:25:04,00:25:08,"tissues act, you no longer have to bring your own teeth, which is good."
00:25:08,00:25:13,"But she said the phantom head sometimes leak on you in the room, so that's a bit stressful."
00:25:13,00:25:14,"Hmm, leak on you."
00:25:14,00:25:15,Lovely.
00:25:15,00:25:16,"They leak on you, yeah."
00:25:16,00:25:17,Okay.
00:25:17,00:25:18,What do they leak?
00:25:18,00:25:19,I don't ask follow-up questions.
00:25:19,00:25:20,That's what I've learned.
00:25:20,00:25:26,How much do you reckon is the most expensive electric toothbrush on the market today?
00:25:26,00:25:29,So something available to all of us in boots?
00:25:29,00:25:33,"Well, to all of us who have enough money for it, which might not be any of us."
00:25:33,00:25:34,"£1,000."
00:25:34,00:25:35,A really nice one.
00:25:35,00:25:36,"£1,000."
00:25:36,00:25:37,"£5,000."
00:25:37,00:25:38,"£3,000."
00:25:38,00:25:42,"Wow, you've all gone – this is really unusual for these guessing games."
00:25:42,00:25:45,Only Dan goes for £10 billion.
00:25:45,00:25:48,"Andy goes for £25 billion, and it goes for I don't care."
00:25:48,00:25:52,"But in this case, you've all gone round about the right amount."
00:25:52,00:25:53,"It's $4,200."
00:25:53,00:25:54,Wow.
00:25:54,00:25:56,"Not far off, £3,000, really."
00:25:56,00:25:57,That's incredible.
00:25:57,00:25:58,I'll take it.
00:25:58,00:26:03,"It's the design, durability, it's got an antibacterial coating."
00:26:03,00:26:05,"I mean, it is that much, but they're bristle heads."
00:26:05,00:26:08,They give you a free one every six months.
00:26:08,00:26:11,"Oh, so you're saving money, really?"
00:26:11,00:26:13,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:26:13,00:26:15,"Actually, that only works for the first three years."
00:26:15,00:26:17,"After that, it's £400."
00:26:17,00:26:18,Wow.
00:26:18,00:26:23,"But if you use the offer code FISH, you can get it."
00:26:23,00:26:25,We do need to move on to our next fact.
00:26:25,00:26:29,"It is time for fact number three, and that is Anna."
00:26:29,00:26:35,"My fact this week is that in the Yazidi religion, Adam left paradise when a peacock pecked an"
00:26:35,00:26:40,"anus in him so he could defecate, and you're not allowed to poo in the Garden of Eden."
00:26:40,00:26:44,"So he left to have a poo, is basically."
00:26:44,00:26:46,He had to go outside to take a poo.
00:26:46,00:26:48,And then there was the doors didn't let him back in.
00:26:48,00:26:50,Not allowed back in once you left the Garden of Eden.
00:26:50,00:26:52,You can't just pop out and in willy-nilly.
00:26:52,00:26:54,So really smelly.
00:26:54,00:27:01,"So, was he, so sorry, he didn't need to go to the loo until this peacock pecked him"
00:27:01,00:27:02,a bottom.
00:27:02,00:27:03,No.
00:27:03,00:27:04,"Well, first of all, the peacock tricked him."
00:27:04,00:27:08,So basically the peacock is a guy called Tawusi Melek.
00:27:08,00:27:12,"So in Yazidi religion, there's God, and then God has a bunch of sort of messengers, angels"
00:27:12,00:27:13,on earth.
00:27:13,00:27:17,"The most important one is this peacock messenger, angel, Tawusi Melek."
00:27:17,00:27:21,And Melek had to lure Adam out of paradise.
00:27:21,00:27:23,And he did so by feeding him a grain of wheat.
00:27:23,00:27:27,"And then as soon as Adam had eaten this grain of wheat, because he hasn't eaten for eternity."
00:27:27,00:27:31,"So that immediately goes straight through him, and he's desperate for the loo."
00:27:31,00:27:36,"And at that point, Tawusi Melek says, ""Okay, I'll peck you an anus, but now I've done that."
00:27:36,00:27:37,"You are going to have to go outside to poo."""
00:27:37,00:27:40,"And then he's out, and he can't get back in."
00:27:40,00:27:44,"And in this creation story, you're thinking, ""Where is Eve?"""
00:27:44,00:27:46,"And she's not really a part of this, right?"
00:27:46,00:27:47,No.
00:27:47,00:27:48,She's not instrumental to the birth of...
00:27:48,00:27:53,"She's there, but she doesn't create the human race."
00:27:53,00:27:54,Yeah.
00:27:54,00:27:56,"In fact, it sounds like he..."
00:27:56,00:27:59,"Oh, Jesus, the little boy in the front row."
00:27:59,00:28:01,So he's upside down.
00:28:01,00:28:04,So he spends a bit of time with himself.
00:28:04,00:28:12,And what he harvests in the process gets put into a jar.
00:28:12,00:28:15,Have you ever considered setting cryptic crosswords there?
00:28:15,00:28:22,"But from the jar that's contained, that is where the birth of humananity came from, right?"
00:28:22,00:28:23,Yeah.
00:28:23,00:28:24,"Or Yazidi people, anyway."
00:28:24,00:28:25,"Yeah, the Yazidi people, rather."
00:28:25,00:28:28,"The Yazidi people are descended from Adam's divine essence, I think, was what you were"
00:28:28,00:28:29,trying to say.
00:28:29,00:28:35,"But then Eve's divine essence was put in another jar, and that became all the worms and scorpions"
00:28:35,00:28:37,"on Earth, according to the story."
00:28:37,00:28:38,Wow.
00:28:38,00:28:39,Nice.
00:28:39,00:28:40,Where's her PR?
00:28:40,00:28:41,Wow.
00:28:41,00:28:47,"This sounds like a much more fun and strange Garden of Eden myth, doesn't it?"
00:28:47,00:28:49,Maybe we're just so used to...
00:28:49,00:28:50,We're so used to it.
00:28:50,00:28:51,"It's all nuts, isn't it?"
00:28:51,00:28:52,Yeah.
00:28:52,00:28:53,Yeah.
00:28:53,00:28:54,It's just a new version.
00:28:54,00:28:55,Yeah.
00:28:55,00:28:56,It's just got detail of pecking and anus.
00:28:56,00:28:57,Is the only thing that...
00:28:57,00:28:58,"Well, I mean, that's more fun."
00:28:58,00:28:59,And it's a peacock.
00:28:59,00:29:00,"Peacocks, they're fun."
00:29:00,00:29:01,They're more fun than a snake.
00:29:01,00:29:02,"They are, do they?"
00:29:02,00:29:03,Yeah.
00:29:03,00:29:04,I would say.
00:29:04,00:29:08,"There are some versions where a dove pecks his anus, and some where a raven pecks his"
00:29:08,00:29:11,"anus, but everyone can agree that some kind of bird pecks his anus."
00:29:11,00:29:14,"Oh, gosh."
00:29:14,00:29:16,We can all agree.
00:29:16,00:29:18,Xanus was that.
00:29:18,00:29:21,"People's Front of Judea, isn't it?"
00:29:21,00:29:22,Yeah.
00:29:22,00:29:27,"There are so many of these Garden of Eden stories, and there was a big rash in the"
00:29:27,00:29:31,19th century of people going looking for it or claiming that they found it.
00:29:31,00:29:38,"So, one Victorian historian, the first president of Boston University, claimed it was at the"
00:29:38,00:29:43,"North Pole because he said it's definitely there, it's got to be there, that he had"
00:29:43,00:29:47,"lots and lots of evidence, published a book which was about 500 pages long saying it's"
00:29:47,00:29:50,definitely at the North Pole.
00:29:50,00:29:51,"Evidence is a strong word, right, for what he..."
00:29:51,00:29:53,Really a very strong word.
00:29:53,00:29:54,William Fairfield Warren said...
00:29:54,00:29:55,"Yeah, that was his name."
00:29:55,00:29:56,"Yeah, yeah."
00:29:56,00:29:57,What was his evidence?
00:29:57,00:30:01,His evidence was that we've never found the Garden of Eden and no one's ever been to
00:30:01,00:30:02,the North Pole.
00:30:02,00:30:05,That's pretty much what it was.
00:30:05,00:30:06,It was circumstantial.
00:30:06,00:30:07,It feels like...
00:30:07,00:30:08,That makes sense.
00:30:08,00:30:09,It must be that.
00:30:09,00:30:12,"Wasn't there a bishop who said it was on Mars as well, to really..."
00:30:12,00:30:13,"Oh, really?"
00:30:13,00:30:14,Yeah.
00:30:14,00:30:15,Ages ago.
00:30:15,00:30:16,"Oh, we've never been to Mars."
00:30:16,00:30:17,And we've never been to Mars and still haven't.
00:30:17,00:30:18,"Very good point, James."
00:30:18,00:30:22,"That was more sensible because, you know, longer term thinking, the whole North Pole thing,"
00:30:22,00:30:25,"we were going to get there in the very near future, at which point we were going to discover"
00:30:25,00:30:29,it's not the Garden of Eden unless they've all lied to us.
00:30:29,00:30:33,There was another person who had a theory about where the Garden of Eden was and that
00:30:33,00:30:37,was the first female presidential candidate for the United States.
00:30:37,00:30:42,"So Victoria Woodhull, who we must have mentioned before, ran for president in 1872 and she"
00:30:42,00:30:49,also wrote a big speech called The Garden of Eden in the 1870s about what she thought
00:30:49,00:30:52,it was and she basically was ridiculing all of these people who thought the Garden of
00:30:52,00:30:54,Eden was at the North Pole or on Mars or whatever.
00:30:54,00:30:59,And she said that any schoolboy of 12 years of age who should read the description of
00:30:59,00:31:05,this Garden and not discover it has no geographical significance ought to be reprimanded for stupidity.
00:31:05,00:31:09,And then she went on to argue that it's all a metaphor for the female body and the female
00:31:09,00:31:11,reproductive system.
00:31:11,00:31:16,"So you know, in the Garden of Eden there are four rivers that meet and she said they are"
00:31:16,00:31:18,the four fluids of the body.
00:31:18,00:31:23,"So one river is the blood, one is the bowels, one is the urinary and one is the reproductive"
00:31:23,00:31:24,system.
00:31:24,00:31:30,So the Euphrates is the reproductive system up which the sperm flows in the Biblical
00:31:30,00:31:35,metaphor and that was what the Bible intended us to think in order to inseminate the Garden
00:31:35,00:31:36,of Eden.
00:31:36,00:31:37,Okay.
00:31:37,00:31:38,"We've got more than four though, right?"
00:31:38,00:31:41,"Well, they didn't know about bile ducts and things at the time, I guess."
00:31:41,00:31:44,"But we had like tears, that's one that's not been mentioned."
00:31:44,00:31:45,That's true.
00:31:45,00:31:48,"Yeah, maybe she should have done tears instead of bowels, maybe bowels and urine could have"
00:31:48,00:31:49,gone together.
00:31:49,00:31:50,"Yeah, snot."
00:31:50,00:31:51,"If you have, if there is very snot."
00:31:51,00:31:52,Yeah.
00:31:52,00:31:54,"These are more streams, I think, streams and tributaries."
00:31:54,00:31:55,Goal.
00:31:55,00:31:56,You haven't seen me.
00:31:56,00:31:57,Goal.
00:31:57,00:31:58,There's another one.
00:31:58,00:31:59,"Goal, yeah."
00:31:59,00:32:00,Goal.
00:32:00,00:32:01,Take it up though.
00:32:01,00:32:02,Maybe this is why she didn't become president.
00:32:02,00:32:05,"It's certainly a pretty weird stump speech, yeah."
00:32:05,00:32:11,I was looking at some other myths about birds and anuses and all that kind of stuff.
00:32:11,00:32:13,Oh my goodness.
00:32:13,00:32:17,"The Taolipang people of North America, of South America, sorry."
00:32:17,00:32:22,They have a story where all animals used to have no anus and they would always defecate
00:32:22,00:32:24,through their mouths.
00:32:24,00:32:28,But the anus was actually a separate animal called Puitu.
00:32:28,00:32:33,"And Puitu the anus would wander around slowly, but he would always annoy people by farting"
00:32:33,00:32:34,in their faces.
00:32:34,00:32:35,What?
00:32:35,00:32:36,And then running away.
00:32:36,00:32:37,What is the story?
00:32:37,00:32:42,"Give us a bit more, what does this mean?"
00:32:42,00:32:43,What happened next?
00:32:43,00:32:44,"Well, it's a great story, isn't it?"
00:32:44,00:32:47,When you need to know what happens next.
00:32:47,00:32:48,Sorry.
00:32:48,00:32:49,I'll keep going.
00:32:49,00:32:53,So the two parrots decided that they'd had enough of him farting in their faces so they
00:32:53,00:33:00,went to try and capture the anus and eventually they did and they tied him up and then they
00:33:00,00:33:06,decided to cut up the anus and spread it out to all of the animals in the world.
00:33:06,00:33:11,The tapir was really eager to get a piece and they cut out a huge piece and that's why
00:33:11,00:33:15,the tapir has a larger anus than other animals.
00:33:15,00:33:20,Who's creation story is this?
00:33:20,00:33:22,This is the Taulipang.
00:33:22,00:33:23,Right.
00:33:23,00:33:25,"I don't know, it's a good animal story."
00:33:25,00:33:31,"I think I prefer Andy's Pelican story, it just had so much to it."
00:33:31,00:33:38,"There is an Inuit folktale, the title character of it was him whose penis stretches down to"
00:33:38,00:33:44,his knees and in the middle of the story he's attacked by a raven while he's sleeping and
00:33:44,00:33:49,by the end of the story he's known as him whose whole penis barely peeps from its cave.
00:33:49,00:33:55,"Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show and that is James."
00:33:55,00:34:00,"Okay, my fact this week is that the first woman to motorcycle from coast to coast in"
00:34:00,00:34:05,the United States did so with her mother in the sidecar.
00:34:05,00:34:18,"Oh, no, this is the mother and daughter team of Effie and Avis Hotchkiss and in 1915 they"
00:34:18,00:34:23,decided to go from New York to the world's fair at San Francisco but just to show it
00:34:23,00:34:24,could be done really.
00:34:24,00:34:28,"We're not exactly show why they did it, Effie told one reporter that it was to demonstrate"
00:34:28,00:34:33,that motorcycling is perfectly good as a girl's sport and other people thought that she was
00:34:33,00:34:37,just sick as she was working in Wall Street and she was sick of her clerical job and she
00:34:37,00:34:39,wanted to see the world.
00:34:39,00:34:42,Other people thought she just wanted to go to San Francisco and wasn't trying to break
00:34:42,00:34:43,any records.
00:34:43,00:34:44,She was just trying to do it.
00:34:44,00:34:45,Wow.
00:34:45,00:34:46,What about her mum?
00:34:46,00:34:47,What do you think about why her mum went?
00:34:47,00:34:48,"Well, we're not sure why her mum went."
00:34:48,00:34:52,"According to some of the interviews at the time, one of the reasons might have been that"
00:34:52,00:34:58,she wanted to inflate the weight of the motorcycle because she's quite a big lady because then
00:34:58,00:35:00,that would stop Effie from going too fast.
00:35:00,00:35:04,"Yeah, she was really concerned with her speed, wasn't she?"
00:35:04,00:35:05,Yeah.
00:35:05,00:35:08,Effie had been sort of booked a few times.
00:35:08,00:35:11,She was quite famous for kind of zipping around the town.
00:35:11,00:35:12,She was getting booked.
00:35:12,00:35:13,Yeah.
00:35:13,00:35:14,So there's an idea that she did that.
00:35:14,00:35:17,"It could be just, again, that she wanted to see the world because she kind of taught"
00:35:17,00:35:21,"her into going to the Grand Canyon and to, I don't know, Niagara Falls and places like"
00:35:21,00:35:22,that.
00:35:22,00:35:23,Yeah.
00:35:23,00:35:27,"It sounds amazing as a trip because there weren't many, I mean, roads were really pretty"
00:35:27,00:35:33,bad at the time and they had to do a lot of mending the motorbike as they went.
00:35:33,00:35:34,They had to have a gun.
00:35:34,00:35:38,They had to shoot at rattlesnakes and coyotes at various times.
00:35:38,00:35:40,I really like this detail of the journey.
00:35:40,00:35:44,They took with them a jar of water from the Atlantic Ocean so that they could pour it
00:35:44,00:35:47,into the Pacific Ocean when they got to California.
00:35:47,00:35:48,Wow.
00:35:48,00:35:49,Imagine if that had ruined everything.
00:35:49,00:35:52,Suddenly the ocean just exploded.
00:35:52,00:35:54,It starts to boil.
00:35:54,00:35:57,All the animals die float to the surface.
00:35:57,00:35:58,Fuck.
00:35:58,00:36:03,This is why we don't let women on motorbikes.
00:36:03,00:36:07,Once they had a puncture and they ran out of inner tube spares and so what they did
00:36:07,00:36:12,was they just got blankets and stuffed it into the wheels so that it would keep going.
00:36:12,00:36:14,So that was kind of how it was in those days.
00:36:14,00:36:18,"Once you got to the Midwest, it was like you say, no roads."
00:36:18,00:36:20,It was pretty hard to get anywhere.
00:36:20,00:36:21,I like that.
00:36:21,00:36:26,"It does sound like the mother, like she was there just to slow them down and keep on top"
00:36:26,00:36:30,"of speed but also it sounds like whenever they stopped and had to do stuff, she just"
00:36:30,00:36:31,remained in the sidecar.
00:36:31,00:36:36,She just wasn't interested in getting out and at one point she was taught tatting which
00:36:36,00:36:39,"is it's kind of like, you know, lace."
00:36:39,00:36:45,It's like weaving lace together and so she just tatted the whole way across America just
00:36:45,00:36:49,making these beautiful little pieces of fabric.
00:36:49,00:36:50,Yeah.
00:36:50,00:36:51,I mean maybe she couldn't get out.
00:36:51,00:36:55,She was a larger lady and an older lady presumably and the sidecar is quite low.
00:36:55,00:37:00,"And maybe she was just too embarrassed to say all the way across, I really can't stand"
00:37:00,00:37:01,up.
00:37:01,00:37:07,"Well they really struggled to find a sidecar that fit, not just because of her but also"
00:37:07,00:37:08,"they had all of the gear as well, right?"
00:37:08,00:37:12,"They had absolutely tons of stuff and eventually what they called it was the bathtub, which"
00:37:12,00:37:14,explains the size and shape of it.
00:37:14,00:37:15,It was a real big thing.
00:37:15,00:37:17,And because it had a jar of water in it.
00:37:17,00:37:22,She brought a gun with her as well.
00:37:22,00:37:23,Yeah.
00:37:23,00:37:25,"It was standard, wasn't it?"
00:37:25,00:37:30,"It was completely standard equipment for just being, like traveling across America at the"
00:37:30,00:37:31,time.
00:37:31,00:37:32,I think it's part of the course now.
00:37:32,00:37:33,To be honest guys.
00:37:33,00:37:34,"Oh yeah, good point."
00:37:34,00:37:37,"Yeah, I'd say that like it's a weird thing, yeah, of course."
00:37:37,00:37:41,"The following year there were sisters, the Van Buren sisters, who did the same thing but"
00:37:41,00:37:46,"did it together, a bike to cross together, I think with no one in the sidecar."
00:37:46,00:37:49,And they did it to prove that women could be dispatch riders so that they could free up
00:37:49,00:37:52,men to fight in World War One.
00:37:52,00:37:56,"So you know, trying to help and not only were they arrested multiple times on the way for"
00:37:56,00:38:00,"wearing men's clothes, they were then not accepted into the army."
00:38:00,00:38:02,"For wearing, they were arrested not for doing anything else."
00:38:02,00:38:05,"Yeah, in a lot of parts of America you weren't allowed to wear trousers if you were a woman."
00:38:05,00:38:06,Yeah.
00:38:06,00:38:07,"Yeah, that's what they did them for."
00:38:07,00:38:08,Yeah.
00:38:08,00:38:10,But you can't wear a skirt because it blows up on a bike if one sees your pants.
00:38:10,00:38:13,So it's a rock and a hard place.
00:38:13,00:38:14,Yeah.
00:38:14,00:38:17,And they did not get accepted into the army at the end.
00:38:17,00:38:20,So a complete waste of time.
00:38:20,00:38:23,"And there was Alice Hewler Ramsey, who drove a car."
00:38:23,00:38:24,This was not a motorbike.
00:38:24,00:38:28,She was the first woman to drive a car from coast to coast.
00:38:28,00:38:31,She did so with two of her sisters-in-law and a friend.
00:38:31,00:38:33,They went from one to the other.
00:38:33,00:38:37,"And the headline in the San Francisco Chronicle the next day was, ""Pretty women motorists"
00:38:37,00:38:40,"arrive after a trip across the continent."""
00:38:40,00:38:43,And one of them was called Margaret Atwood.
00:38:43,00:38:44,No.
00:38:44,00:38:45,Really?
00:38:45,00:38:48,"Not thee, but you know, still cool."
00:38:48,00:38:50,"She had a good trip, Alice Ramsey."
00:38:50,00:38:54,"She had various obstacles along the way, but she wasn't really allowed to say so because"
00:38:54,00:38:58,"the reason she was doing it was because she was driving in a Maxwell Briscoe company car,"
00:38:58,00:39:00,a Maxwell car.
00:39:00,00:39:05,"And it was the company's idea for them to do it, to say, ""Look, our car can drive even"
00:39:05,00:39:07,"a woman across America."""
00:39:07,00:39:11,"So even though it broke down various times along the way, and she had to fix it herself,"
00:39:11,00:39:14,"had to wait for mechanics to come out, in fact, she said there was an awkward moment"
00:39:14,00:39:20,"where they had to replace a coil, and they had to wait for a while for a coil."
00:39:20,00:39:22,"When you say coil, you mean part of the car, right?"
00:39:22,00:39:23,"The coil in the car, yeah."
00:39:23,00:39:27,Reproductive technology wasn't that advanced back then.
00:39:27,00:39:31,"But yeah, the crowd surrounded her and shunted, ""Get a horse!"""
00:39:31,00:39:32,Which is embarrassing.
00:39:32,00:39:33,Get a horse!
00:39:33,00:39:36,"Get a horse, love!"
00:39:36,00:39:39,And the horse lobby was a big one back then.
00:39:39,00:39:43,"So another problem they found was they used guidebooks, which would just be lists of landmarks"
00:39:43,00:39:44,to follow.
00:39:44,00:39:48,"So they'd say things like, you know, take the big oak tree, get to the oak tree, turn"
00:39:48,00:39:51,"right along the white fence, et cetera."
00:39:51,00:39:55,"And the problem was the landmarks used to change, and specifically there was a yellow"
00:39:55,00:40:01,"house and barn in their instructions, but the owner of it was a horse loyalist, hated"
00:40:01,00:40:08,"this new motor thing, and so he repainted his barn red, deliberately to send them off"
00:40:08,00:40:09,the trail.
00:40:09,00:40:10,That's so funny.
00:40:10,00:40:11,Wow.
00:40:11,00:40:12,"Amazingly, they made it."
00:40:12,00:40:15,"And what they would do is, there were telephone lines there, weren't there?"
00:40:15,00:40:19,And they would just follow whatever the telephone wires had the most wires on them.
00:40:19,00:40:23,"They thought, ""Well, that must be going towards a big town,"" and they kind of navigated through"
00:40:23,00:40:24,the towns that way.
00:40:24,00:40:25,That's clever.
00:40:25,00:40:26,Smart.
00:40:26,00:40:29,"Well, motorcyclists as well used to go on the railroad tracks, didn't they, when they"
00:40:29,00:40:32,"were just like, ""Well, this will definitely just lead me to where, yeah."""
00:40:32,00:40:37,"And it's, you know, I'll just move when there's a train, but otherwise they'll get me there."
00:40:37,00:40:38,So are you reading about George Wyman?
00:40:38,00:40:39,"Yeah, I think so."
00:40:39,00:40:40,Yeah.
00:40:40,00:40:46,"So he was the first person to take a motorbike across America, 1903 this was, and it was"
00:40:46,00:40:47,basically a bike as well.
00:40:47,00:40:48,It wasn't really a motorbike.
00:40:48,00:40:52,"It was a bike which had a motor on it, kind of like an e-bike, basically."
00:40:52,00:40:53,Yeah.
00:40:53,00:40:54,Yeah.
00:40:54,00:40:59,"And he had a camera, he had a change of clothes and a gun, obviously, and it was so broken"
00:40:59,00:41:01,down by the end of the journey.
00:41:01,00:41:06,"His motor worked so badly that he had to cycle the last 150 miles, just pedaling his motorbike."
00:41:06,00:41:12,"But he cycled on railroad tracks, but across the West, so you know, the sleepers, he was"
00:41:12,00:41:17,"just cycling over the sleepers, bum, bum, bum, bum, but he miles and miles and miles."
00:41:17,00:41:21,"And it's created a thing that you can do today, which I really like, which is called the Iron"
00:41:21,00:41:29,"Butt Association, and it's if you cycle, sorry, if you motorcycle a thousand miles in 24 hours"
00:41:29,00:41:30,of riding.
00:41:30,00:41:34,"Yeah, not if you, no one has ever cycled a thousand miles in 24 hours, but if you motorbike"
00:41:34,00:41:37,"like that, you get, you join the Iron Butt Association."
00:41:37,00:41:38,"Yeah, that's really cool."
00:41:38,00:41:39,Yeah.
00:41:39,00:41:41,Do you guys hear of the first person to walk across America?
00:41:41,00:41:42,No.
00:41:42,00:41:43,No?
00:41:43,00:41:44,It's great.
00:41:44,00:41:46,"In fact, it's someone we've mentioned on this podcast, friend of the podcast, I would"
00:41:46,00:41:51,"say, he's called Edward Payson-Weston, known as the Wiley Wobbler."
00:41:51,00:41:53,I can't remember.
00:41:53,00:41:58,"He was the founder of pedestrianism, and he did all these walking challenges."
00:41:58,00:42:02,"He would walk, you know, 500 miles in five days or whatever it was."
00:42:02,00:42:03,500 more.
00:42:03,00:42:10,"He would walk, yeah, and he was the man who walked a thousand miles to turn up in California,"
00:42:10,00:42:12,"it turns out, walking across."
00:42:12,00:42:17,"When you say he was a founder of pedestrianism, because it's not like everyone else was driving"
00:42:17,00:42:18,a car until he came along.
00:42:18,00:42:23,"No, it was in much the same way that William Smelly was the father of midwifery."
00:42:23,00:42:26,"People had walked before, but he perfected it."
00:42:26,00:42:27,I see.
00:42:27,00:42:28,He perfected the form.
00:42:28,00:42:29,He got the tools.
00:42:29,00:42:36,"America, for the first time, aged 70, and then he did it again, aged 71, and 500,000"
00:42:36,00:42:40,people supposedly turned up to see him arrive in New York.
00:42:40,00:42:41,Big deal.
00:42:41,00:42:42,Oh my God.
00:42:42,00:42:43,He was world famous just for walking.
00:42:43,00:42:48,"He walked across America when he was 70, which presumably would take about a year, and then"
00:42:48,00:42:49,he walked it at 71.
00:42:49,00:42:51,Took him 100 days.
00:42:51,00:42:52,100 days only.
00:42:52,00:42:53,Yeah.
00:42:53,00:42:54,To walk America.
00:42:54,00:42:55,I know.
00:42:55,00:42:56,He was the Wiley Wobbler.
00:42:56,00:42:57,I knew he was Wiley.
00:42:57,00:42:58,He was the Wiley Wobbler.
00:42:58,00:43:02,And then he came to Britain and he walked all around Britain and people went nuts.
00:43:02,00:43:03,He must have found that piss easy.
00:43:03,00:43:04,He absolutely did.
00:43:04,00:43:09,"Peter K. He walked 5,000 miles around Britain in 1884."
00:43:09,00:43:10,Get this.
00:43:10,00:43:11,I love this line.
00:43:11,00:43:16,"""The Royal Society, very eminent body, announced that his feet is the greatest recorded labor"
00:43:16,00:43:20,"that any human being has ever undertaken without injury."""
00:43:20,00:43:21,Right.
00:43:21,00:43:22,Imagine getting that accolade.
00:43:22,00:43:25,"The feet were his feet, which it is."
00:43:25,00:43:26,His feet.
00:43:26,00:43:28,"I'm surprised you can even get 5,000 miles around."
00:43:28,00:43:30,He must have gone right around the coast.
00:43:30,00:43:31,You got a webball.
00:43:31,00:43:32,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:43:32,00:43:33,You walk.
00:43:33,00:43:34,You do the...
00:43:34,00:43:37,"I remember when I used to live by the coast, I used to go for a run in the morning and"
00:43:37,00:43:40,I would run for 30 minutes along the coast.
00:43:40,00:43:43,"But because of fractal geometry, that meant that I'd gone an infinite distance."
00:43:43,00:43:44,All right.
00:43:44,00:43:45,Sure.
00:43:45,00:43:49,Just watch the mathematicians there.
00:43:49,00:43:52,"Guys, we need to wrap up very soon."
00:43:52,00:43:54,"Oh, really?"
00:43:54,00:43:55,The Cannonball Run.
00:43:55,00:43:56,Do you know this?
00:43:56,00:43:57,The one thing?
00:43:57,00:44:01,Cannonball Run is the speed record across America for driving.
00:44:01,00:44:08,The current record is 25 hours and 55 minutes to drive from one side to the other.
00:44:08,00:44:09,What?
00:44:09,00:44:14,"The record was beaten only four times between 2006 and 2019, and then it was beaten five"
00:44:14,00:44:16,times in 2020.
00:44:16,00:44:19,"Pretty quiet, yeah, for everybody."
00:44:19,00:44:22,"Basically no police on the roads, no cars on the roads."
00:44:22,00:44:24,They could just go as fast as they wanted.
00:44:24,00:44:26,"Yeah, it's very illegal, isn't it?"
00:44:26,00:44:31,"The average speed for that guy, Fred Ashmore, I think it's called, is 108 miles an hour."
00:44:31,00:44:32,Average speed.
00:44:32,00:44:33,Yeah.
00:44:33,00:44:34,It's insane.
00:44:34,00:44:39,"The amount of logistics it takes to organise it, because they all have spot cars going"
00:44:39,00:44:41,"ahead to say if they see any police, don't they?"
00:44:41,00:44:42,Exactly.
00:44:42,00:44:44,And he had to...
00:44:44,00:44:49,He removed all the seats in the car and he got an extra special kind of gasoline tank
00:44:49,00:44:51,so he could get more in.
00:44:51,00:44:52,And this was a rental car.
00:44:52,00:44:57,"Afterwards, he had to put it all back together again."
00:44:57,00:45:03,I love to be the guy at the rental place who's just recording the mileage on the car.
00:45:03,00:45:05,"Oh, that's funny."
00:45:05,00:45:10,"You rented this yesterday and it's got 3,000 miles more."
00:45:10,00:45:16,The first all-female motorcycling stunt group in the UK was called the Motobirds.
00:45:16,00:45:20,"They were formed in Leicester in the '70s, and every year they would try and jump over"
00:45:20,00:45:23,"a river in Leicester, and they always failed."
00:45:23,00:45:25,They could never quite get it working.
00:45:25,00:45:29,"And then one time, the final time they tried it, they really souped up their motorbike."
00:45:29,00:45:34,"They jumped over, landed on the other side of the river in the net, bounced out of the"
00:45:34,00:45:36,net and back into the river.
00:45:36,00:45:40,"Look, guys, we need to wrap up."
00:45:40,00:45:41,"Okay, that is it."
00:45:41,00:45:42,That is all of our facts.
00:45:42,00:45:44,Thank you so much for listening.
