2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,520
 >> Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,

3
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,920
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Peterborough.

4
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:28,440
 >> [APPLAUSE]

5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,480
 >> My name is Dan Schreiber.

6
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,560
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin.

7
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:39,120
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

8
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,280
 facts from the last seven days.

9
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,040
 And in no particular order, here we go.

10
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,360
 Starting with fact number one, and that's my fact.

11
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:54,120
 My fact this week is that the man known as the father of British midwifery

12
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,440
 was called Willie Smelly.

13
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,400
 >> [LAUGH]

14
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,280
 >> So childish.

15
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,240
 >> Childish.

16
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:07,520
 >> Willie Smelly, so Willie Smelly, he lived between 1697 and 1763.

17
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:13,720
 He was a Scottish obstetrician, obstetrician, obstetrician.

18
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,640
 >> Sure, I'm sure James can make one of those work in the edit.

19
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,360
 >> [LAUGH]

20
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:23,040
 >> He lived in London and he was basically, obviously midwifery was going on for

21
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,320
 thousands and thousands of years.

22
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,040
 But he was the first male who was allowed sort of into the game.

23
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:32,120
 And he did quite a lot of things to sort of turn it into somewhere that was a bit

24
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,800
 more safer for having babies.

25
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:37,920
 He sort of helped to advance the use of forceps with some designs.

26
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,880
 And he was a very important figure in that world.

27
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,360
 >> He designed a mannequin, didn't he?

28
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,240
 That would let you learn how to deliver a baby.

29
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,120
 It was known as the mock woman, or sometimes this most curious machine.

30
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:55,480
 It had legs and feet that would have shoes and stockings on it.

31
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,860
 So that made it quite realistic.

32
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:57,360
 >> Cool.

33
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,240
 >> There was an anatomist called Robert Campbell who said he could scarcely tell

34
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,960
 the difference between the machine and a real live woman.

35
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,680
 >> [LAUGH]

36
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,240
 >> Wow.

37
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,800
 >> This machine didn't have a head.

38
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,200
 >> Yeah.

39
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,600
 >> It sounds terrifying, it really does.

40
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:16,880
 It had a stomach that was full of leather.

41
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,280
 >> Right.

42
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,080
 >> Which I think represented the baby.

43
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,040
 >> Well, there's a little wax doll in there as well, also a baby.

44
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,800
 And it had a bladder which you could fill up,

45
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,760
 which was helpful with a little cork stopper, like the real female bladder.

46
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,120
 >> [LAUGH]

47
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,920
 >> So you could break the water.

48
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,680
 Was that the idea?

49
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,640
 >> I don't know, maybe.

50
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,080
 >> Was that for breaking the water?

51
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:38,240
 >> Yeah, we sometimes use real bones and real skeletons.

52
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,960
 I think he made at least four of these weird robot women.

53
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:46,560
 And for one of them, yeah, he used actual, he made ligaments and muscles and

54
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,440
 they moved like real people and used an actual skeleton of a mother and baby, I think.

55
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,080
 >> And he used to use real people as well, as in pregnant women.

56
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,000
 And he used to have a thing because he was very good at his job as well.

57
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,680
 So a lot of people wanted him to be the midwife for the job.

58
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,880
 And so he would say, I'll do it for free, I'll wave my feet if I can do it in front

59
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:10,160
 of all my students and they can observe and I can do a sort of lecture as I'm doing it.

60
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,080
 >> I do wonder though if you want your midwife to be focused mostly on

61
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,680
 delivering the child, not on delivering a good lecture.

62
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,480
 If they want to deliver one thing well, you want it to be the child.

63
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,200
 >> Yeah, today's lecture is what not to do during birth.

64
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,360
 >> What?

65
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,040
 >> Stop the birth, stop the birth.

66
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:29,280
 Hi everybody, just wanted to let you know today's birth is sponsored by Hello Fresh.

67
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,160
 >> This model, we don't have any of them anymore.

68
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,160
 They've all disappeared and we don't know where they are.

69
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,200
 We have a few others from around the same time.

70
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,760
 There's one in France called the Boudin Pinard model.

71
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,280
 And that was kind of similar.

72
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,560
 It was made of rubber.

73
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:48,680
 It had a vaginal opening with a thumb screw so you could make it bigger and smaller.

74
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,480
 >> Some of them work like that actually.

75
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,240
 Yeah, the non-cork, the cheaper vaginas come just with the screw top.

76
00:03:55,240 --> 00:04:02,960
 >> This one also had a rubber rectum and the rubber rectum was there because there

77
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:08,000
 was something called the Rittgen manoeuvre and one version of doing that is the midwife

78
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,040
 would put her fingers up the bum of the mother and then they would kind of manoeuvre the

79
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,760
 head a little bit if it was in the wrong place and it would stop the perineum from

80
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,260
 getting in trouble.

81
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:24,600
 This Rittgen manoeuvre evolved from a technique from the ancient Greeks.

82
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,720
 It was first proposed by a Greek physician called Sauranus.

83
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,720
 >> No.

84
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,720
 Very nice.

85
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,720
 Unbelievable.

86
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,720
 >> Sauranus of Ephesus.

87
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:40,720
 >> Can you have an alternative determinism when the words won't mean that for another

88
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,040
 year.

89
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:52,040
 >> He was controversial, William Smelly, because men weren't allowed into the midwifery game

90
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:57,320
 and male midwives were seen as controversial when they started practicing and they had

91
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:03,160
 to work by touch because there was a risk they would see something indecent so some of

92
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:08,480
 them had to kind of work with a sheet in between them and the delivery.

93
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:13,920
 >> I think even up until the 19th century, any men working on the female body, and by

94
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:17,840
 the 19th century it was all men, women had sort of been edged out of the practice, were

95
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:23,160
 encouraged not to look directly at a woman's private part so obstetricians were told.

96
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,600
 >> Like the son.

97
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,040
 >> Obstetricians had specific instructions that to reassure a female patient they're

98
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:34,080
 not looking at a private part, they should gaze into the distance or maintain constant

99
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,080
 eye contact with her.

100
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,280
 >> What a stressful situation, giving birth already, very, very, very stressful.

101
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,840
 Imagine seeing your medical team walk in, they're all in blindfolds, some of them are

102
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,960
 looking at the mountain over there.

103
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,840
 >> One of them just staring you straight in the face.

104
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:53,200
 >> Do you put the fingers at the bum like it's put the tail in the donkey?

105
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,720
 >> Oh my God.

106
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,840
 >> And it was really controversial for the men to come in, wasn't it?

107
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:03,120
 Because before that all of the midwifery was done by women, there was someone called Elizabeth

108
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,560
 Nihel who was writing in the 18th century who really thought that this was a terrible

109
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,560
 idea.

110
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,660
 She thought that basically all the men had come in and they were finding problems that

111
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:16,600
 weren't there and the best way to do it was to be a natural birth and you're getting all

112
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:20,480
 these forceps in but if you just leave it it will probably be fine in most cases and

113
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:25,400
 she said that a lot of the surgeons were coming in and they were being fast tracked to become

114
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:30,120
 a midwife and people like William Smelly were trying to teach them really, really quickly

115
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:35,720
 and like barbers, tailors and pork butchers were coming in to become midwives in a short

116
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,720
 period of time.

117
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,200
 >> Gosh, you would ask, wouldn't you?

118
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,840
 >> What was your previous career?

119
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:46,520
 >> The men were called, when they started becoming midwives, they were called either man midwife

120
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:52,880
 or he midwife and the masters of the universe.

121
00:06:52,880 --> 00:07:00,880
 >> It kind of doesn't work because midwife, the actual term itself, it literally means

122
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:06,480
 with wife so you are the mid to the wife.

123
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,880
 That was just an extra bit of word you didn't need.

124
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:14,400
 Everyone is a midwife if you're helping give birth.

125
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:19,600
 >> You said that William Smelly, he developed the forceps which was one of his main contributions

126
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:23,880
 so he didn't invent it, he made it better, I guess you can all picture what a forceps

127
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:27,440
 is in birth, it's sort of like a pair of scissors but instead of the scissor bits you have like

128
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,440
 a clamp.

129
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:31,560
 >> It's more like a pair of asparagus tongs.

130
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,560
 >> It's like that.

131
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,440
 >> Man of the people, Andrew Huntsmurray.

132
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,560
 >> Or like two eyelash curlers clamp together.

133
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,720
 >> More like that but gigantic ones for a giant.

134
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,800
 >> To clamp onto a child's head.

135
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:50,800
 >> He developed forceps which were only used in 2% of childbirth even then so it's weird

136
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:56,240
 that it was so revolutionary but forceps before that the design was a complete secret from

137
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,520
 all the hundred years so there was this one family that invented them, the Chamberlain

138
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:05,400
 family and from the mid 16th to the mid 17th century over five generations they had to

139
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,560
 keep it completely secret so they had this elaborate ceremony when they arrived at the

140
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,480
 house of a woman in labour they'd arrive in this big carriage, they'd have this massive

141
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:17,840
 wooden box that had all like carvings all over it, it would take two people to carry

142
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,840
 the forceps in, no one was allowed to see inside, it looked like it was some gigantic

143
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,640
 instrument, no one else is allowed in the room when the woman's giving birth and then

144
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:30,840
 they'd make weird noises like ringing bells and making weird sounds so the people outside

145
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:34,120
 the door thought what is this amazing instrument?

146
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,120
 >> Wow.

147
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,120
 >> No one knew.

148
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,760
 >> I read that sometimes they blindfolded the woman giving birth.

149
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,680
 >> Could anyone see in the room?

150
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:48,320
 >> Blind man's muff was what they called it.

151
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,320
 >> Wow.

152
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,320
 >> Wow.

153
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,200
 >> Yeah, they were two brothers weren't they, the Chamberlains, both called Peter.

154
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,200
 >> Yes.

155
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,200
 >> So weird.

156
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,200
 >> So weird.

157
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,640
 >> We should say there's another controversial thing about Willie Smelly which is that it

158
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:08,960
 turns out he might have been a serial killer and the four of us discovered this very late

159
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:14,920
 in our research, it really feels like his name has buried the headline throughout history.

160
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:19,160
 >> I don't think it's even worth mentioning, you know, you do one dodgy thing.

161
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:23,920
 >> Yeah, but no, it turns out apparently quite a serial number of dodgy things here.

162
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,120
 >> You do a series of dodgy things.

163
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,120
 >> Yeah.

164
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,880
 >> And the idea was that he and another guy called John Hunter I think wanted to be the

165
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:36,280
 best midwives and wanted to kind of become famous for their new techniques and so they

166
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:41,760
 needed people to test it out on and in the kind of Burke and Hare kind of style, they

167
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,600
 knocked people off so that they could get their cadavers.

168
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:50,260
 >> Called Birking in fact, I don't know, which seems like, where's hair gone in that verb?

169
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:53,520
 All the papers talk about it as, you know, he was part of a bit of Birking.

170
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:57,760
 >> I think Hare's like, it's cool, I'm very happy with it.

171
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,760
 >> Is it definitive?

172
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:02,520
 It seems like there's a lot, I guess, I mean, he wasn't tried, so it's never been, it's

173
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:05,680
 hard to kind of know for certain certain, but it does seem like there's lots of circumstantial

174
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:10,480
 evidence of people not asking, you know, even not asking questions about where the bodies

175
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,480
 are coming from, that kind of thing.

176
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,800
 >> I think it's quite, there was someone at the time who raised it during his lifetime

177
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,680
 and he almost stopped practicing for a while just because he thought, you know, either

178
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,400
 the rumor is becoming too prevalent amongst people or it was true and I better stop, we

179
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:32,320
 don't know which, but it's come up more recently that someone has gone through all of the lists

180
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:37,560
 of women that he had access to and how did he get that many women and it kind of seems

181
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:41,840
 like all the academics who love him, because he was so influential, there were hospitals

182
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:47,120
 named after him that have since closed, but up until 1992, wouldn't you go to the Willy

183
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,640
 Smelly hospital?

184
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:55,240
 But so it seems that there's, someone has written this paper and a lot of academics have looked

185
00:10:55,240 --> 00:11:01,000
 at it and gone, yeah, it's very compelling, damn it, because they love him so much and

186
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,960
 they almost don't want to look at it but it looks like it could be true.

187
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:12,560
 >> So on midwives who aren't serial killers, there were some, the job of a midwife sometimes

188
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,920
 entailed giving women orgasms, this was, so there was this belief from basically from

189
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,680
 ancient Greece until the early 19th century that, you know, in the 19th century everything

190
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,360
 got very buttoned up and no one was supposed to enjoy anything anymore, but before that

191
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,640
 everyone thought that it was damaging for women if they didn't have orgasms frequently

192
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:34,760
 enough and Galen, you know, the ancient physician said that women would suffer from limb aches

193
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:38,880
 and things like that due to the build up of female generative fluids within.

194
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:44,200
 And so in the 16th century a doctor called Forestus, a Dutch doctor said that women should

195
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,760
 employ midwives to manually stimulate them on a regular basis if they weren't getting

196
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,760
 enough sex.

197
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,760
 >> Fair enough.

198
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,760
 >> Absolutely fair enough.

199
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:55,400
 >> The midwife's coming around again, darling, are you sure?

200
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,040
 I didn't even know you were expecting a baby.

201
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,760
 >> I will be soon.

202
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:07,720
 >> Yeah, the idea with Galen was that he thought that a woman would have exactly the same genitals

203
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,880
 as a man, but just inside out.

204
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:14,640
 And so that was why the man needed to orgasm in order to create the seeds so the women would

205
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,640
 have to do the same.

206
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,640
 That was the idea.

207
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:21,320
 He thought also if a woman got too hot that her genitals would fall outside of her body

208
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,120
 and she'd turn into a man.

209
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:32,520
 So it's not true, that's not true, just busting another myth.

210
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:37,400
 >> Did you know that some midwives are hamsters?

211
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,040
 >> What's this?

212
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,360
 It's a person called a hamster.

213
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,360
 >> No, it's not.

214
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,360
 I'm not doing it.

215
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,200
 >> If this is what the NHS has resulted to, then it does mean more funding.

216
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,800
 >> There's a specific kind of hamster called a Jungarian hamster.

217
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:53,600
 The paternal hamster, the dad, will mechanically assist the delivery.

218
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:59,440
 She will help the mother give birth to the litter of baby hamsters and does a proper

219
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:09,300
 job like will consume the amniotic fluid, tick, proper good service here, eat the placenta

220
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,300
 to...

221
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,560
 >> Finger up the bum, orgasm for the woman.

222
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,920
 >> They'll even open the baby's airways by licking its nostrils.

223
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,920
 So that is...

224
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,520
 >> They're not the only animals that do it.

225
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,560
 So we know that some monkeys do it as well.

226
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,560
 They like to perform that.

227
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,920
 In some cases, bats have been observed doing it as well.

228
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:30,920
 So there's a biologist called Thomas Kuntz, and he lives in Florida.

229
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,920
 Hey, listen.

230
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:40,360
 Just because we've had soaring as Willie Smelly, Kuntz doesn't need to be lumped in there.

231
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,920
 So basically, he was in the lab...

232
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,160
 >> Must be so hard for a bat to give birth because you're upside down.

233
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,160
 >> No.

234
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,160
 You're like, "Push, push."

235
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,160
 >> I'm trying.

236
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,160
 >> Exactly.

237
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,160
 You're meant to flip the other way.

238
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:55,920
 So he was in his lab, and suddenly, there was all this drama because a bat was in distress,

239
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,960
 and another bat kind of flew over and was like, "Hey, come on, gotta help the bat out."

240
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:06,080
 And so she flies back, and they go and observe it, and this other bat, who's not related

241
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,360
 by blood, gets next to this bat.

242
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:12,320
 So bats actually do flip upside down to give birth, so they're on their feet.

243
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,560
 But this bat was upside down, still hanging.

244
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,480
 So this other bat flipped upside down and started going, "Ugh!"

245
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,480
 To show this other bat.

246
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:23,760
 >> You know, you've used upside down to mean both the right way up and upside down on multiple

247
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,080
 occasions, and no one has any idea.

248
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:31,120
 >> Okay, so the non-pregnant bat has flipped onto its legs the wrong way around, and it's

249
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,120
 going, "Ugh!"

250
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:37,040
 And straining and showing the upside down bat how it should be done.

251
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,680
 And then the upside bat goes, "Oh, okay, flips over."

252
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:47,160
 And then the bat not pregnant starts licking the genitals of the bat to sort of help lubricate

253
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,160
 it.

254
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,160
 So awkward there's a kid in the front row.

255
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,160
 I'm really...

256
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,920
 It's trying to work out how to say what I needed to say here.

257
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:58,360
 >> I think what happened there was about five minutes ago, you worked out what you were

258
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,360
 going to have to say.

259
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,400
 You're like, "I'm just going to keep saying upside down until it stops."

260
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,960
 >> Look, we need to move on to our next fact.

261
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:09,080
 It is time for fact number two, and that is Andy.

262
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:15,880
 >> My fact is that there is a town in Mexico where one person in ten is a dentist.

263
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,120
 >> I know what you're thinking.

264
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,120
 Sounds about normal.

265
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,880
 You know, sounds like a roughly normal ratio.

266
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,880
 It's not.

267
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,880
 It's not at all.

268
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:29,400
 It's called Los Algodones, and it is the dentistry capital maybe of the world, certainly of Mexico.

269
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:34,040
 It's got 350 dentists in it, but that is one person in ten there.

270
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,520
 >> So who are they...

271
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:39,040
 Well, surely if there's not many people, who are they actually dentists drinking?

272
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,040
 >> Each other.

273
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,040
 Each other.

274
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,040
 Got no teeth left?

275
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,040
 No, no, no.

276
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,040
 It's not that.

277
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,040
 So it's a huge place for health tourism.

278
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,280
 So people who don't have dental insurance in the USA will travel, because it's very

279
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:52,600
 near the border with the United States.

280
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:57,280
 But just to give you an idea of how weird this proportion is, one person in ten.

281
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:03,560
 So they have to look after 320 teeth each, right?

282
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:08,200
 Because you know, one person is, I know I'm sort of assuming there's no health tourism now,

283
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,480
 but that would be 320 teeth each.

284
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,060
 In the UK, each dentist has to look after about 53,000 teeth.

285
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,060
 >> Right.

286
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,060
 I know.

287
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,060
 >> Wow, that's quality.

288
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,060
 That's certainly true.

289
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,060
 >> It's less than one tooth a day, isn't it?

290
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,060
 That's, you know...

291
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:21,060
 >> Absolutely.

292
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,560
 >> They can spend a day and a bit on every single tooth.

293
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,560
 >> Yeah.

294
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,560
 Yeah, yeah.

295
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,680
 They've got 200 times as many dentists per head of population in the town.

296
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:33,920
 >> Los Algodones is only four square blocks in size, and the population is about 40 times

297
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,120
 smaller than just to take a random city, Peterborough.

298
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,120
 >> Wow.

299
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,120
 Makes me think.

300
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:44,680
 >> It's also extremely sunny, sunniest place on Earth.

301
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,680
 So great dental care.

302
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,680
 >> On Earth.

303
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,680
 >> On Earth.

304
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,400
 Well, the sunniest place on Earth is Yuma, which is just on the other side of the border.

305
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,840
 I mean, literally a 20-minute drive away, less.

306
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,360
 So I think it can also be called the sunniest place on Earth.

307
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,360
 >> That's amazing.

308
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,680
 >> Yeah, it gets 305 sunny blue sky days a year.

309
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,680
 >> Wow.

310
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,080
 >> Interestingly, the best way to get there from the sunniest place is through a place

311
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,360
 called The Gap.

312
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,200
 So if you've got teeth problems...

313
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,200
 >> I love it.

314
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:14,160
 >> ...but The Gap is just what they call a huge hole in Donald Trump's wall.

315
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,160
 >> Oh, really?

316
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:20,240
 >> I thought if anyone can fill in a gap, it's the town of Dentist next to it.

317
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:26,280
 I was reading a bit about dental tourism generally, and dental holiday package deals are just

318
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,200
 a bound, if anyone's interested.

319
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:34,240
 I didn't realise this, but you go online to dentalholiday.co.uk, and for £3,200, you

320
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:39,960
 can get a trip to Slovakia, which includes a Pampadere hot spring spa island, a return

321
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:44,000
 boat trip down the Danube, and eight crowns or veneers.

322
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 >> Wow.

323
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 >> It's not bizarre.

324
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 >> Sounds great.

325
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,120
 >> And it was actually, it was a weird thing in COVID earlier on this year.

326
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:57,400
 In Ireland, I said Ireland had specific travel bans which allowed for health tourism, but

327
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:03,040
 you couldn't go just on holiday, and suddenly people going to Tenerife rocketed, and it

328
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:07,560
 turns out they also have quite a lot of dentists in Tenerife, and a study found that 40% of

329
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:12,480
 people travelling from Dublin airport on flights had a letter from a dentist in Tenerife.

330
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,480
 >> Right.

331
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,960
 >> Yeah, yeah, this person definitely deserves dental treatment.

332
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,960
 They need to come here.

333
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,960
 >> That's amazing.

334
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,960
 >> Right.

335
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,880
 >> Have you guys heard of the big Thomas?

336
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,880
 >> The big Thomas?

337
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,880
 >> Yeah.

338
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,200
 >> That sounds like a euphemism for something.

339
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,200
 >> It does, doesn't it?

340
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:32,360
 >> Well, he was a French man, and his name actually was, his name was Jean Thomas, which

341
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:35,640
 is a euphemism for something, but that's not what, that joke wasn't known at the time,

342
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,800
 so he would have been fine.

343
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:40,480
 >> Neither was Soranus, but it's still funny.

344
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:46,360
 >> He was a dentist in Paris in the 18th century, and he was, for 50 years, a massive fixture

345
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:51,400
 on the Pont Neuf Bridge, and he was the most famous dentist in Paris.

346
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:56,640
 He was this huge guy, and he, if you couldn't get your tooth out, he would lift the patient

347
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,080
 in the air by the tooth to try and get it out.

348
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,080
 He was incredible.

349
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:07,440
 His motto was, "Dentem Synon Maxillam," the tooth, and if not the tooth, the jaw.

350
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:15,400
 I, I'm getting something incredible, incredible guy.

351
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,480
 He was in an opera as a comic character.

352
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,800
 He was called the honor of the universe and the terror of the human jaw.

353
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,080
 He was quite, quite the man.

354
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:28,520
 He was once pranked by a group of medical students who attached four rockets to the

355
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:33,080
 underside of his cart, because he had a sort of, you know, wheeled surgery, basically,

356
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:36,640
 and then when he was in the middle of extracting a tooth, they let off the rockets, and the

357
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,280
 cart blew up, and he fell over on the patient, and that was-

358
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,280
 >> And what about the patient?

359
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,840
 >> It doesn't say what happened to the patient.

360
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:47,000
 That was, that was the equivalent of, you know, Beatles about or whatever, in 18th century

361
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 Paris.

362
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,960
 >> I reckon there were a lot of people with only half a jaw in that town who were very

363
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,200
 much behind the medical students during that prank.

364
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,200
 >> Yeah, yeah.

365
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,840
 >> But was that in the 1700s, you say, because that was when becoming a tooth puller became

366
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:02,240
 such a lucrative industry suddenly, because sugar consumption quadrupled, I think, in

367
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,360
 that century, and so suddenly people's teeth were rotten all over the place, and they used

368
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:11,400
 a thing called a pelican, which was shaped like a pelican beak, and it clamped onto your

369
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,800
 tooth and gum, and then you leave it out, you kind of twisted the tooth out, and it

370
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,800
 came out.

371
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,040
 >> I saw a pelican in the park the other day.

372
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,040
 >> Amazing.

373
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,040
 >> Great story, Andy.

374
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,440
 >> No, but they are surprisingly huge.

375
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,440
 >> Yeah.

376
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,440
 >> They are.

377
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,440
 >> You've seen a pelican in the flesh?

378
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,440
 >> I have seen them, yeah.

379
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,040
 >> These were smaller than, they were not the size of actual pelicans.

380
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,040
 >> I understand, yeah, yeah.

381
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,040
 >> As you were.

382
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,040
 >> Yeah.

383
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,040
 >> Nonetheless, guys, check it out.

384
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:38,720
 If you Google pelican length, you're going to be surprised.

385
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,640
 Thank God you didn't let James cut you off from the rest of that story.

386
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,640
 >> Sorry.

387
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:47,520
 >> Do you know that your dentist can tell if you're scared of them?

388
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,680
 >> Because you say, you're shaking with fear, you're trying to run away.

389
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,720
 >> Even if you're kind of fronting up, they can tell.

390
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,720
 >> Oh, really?

391
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,320
 >> And it's bad news as well, because it can make them fuck up.

392
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,320
 >> Oh.

393
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:02,440
 >> Because this study, and what they did was they gave students some t-shirts and they

394
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:07,440
 kind of either gave them a really stressful exam or they gave them a really calm lecture.

395
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,320
 I don't know what a calm lecture is, but they gave them one anyway.

396
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,600
 And then they put the t-shirts on mannequins and they got the dentist to do some dental

397
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,760
 work on them.

398
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:21,840
 And they found that the dentist who were doing work on the ones with sweaty, scared t-shirts

399
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,720
 did a much worse job.

400
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:27,160
 They sometimes would like damage the neighboring teeth when they were trying to get one out.

401
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,160
 They put another one out.

402
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,160
 >> Oh, really?

403
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,360
 >> So they can smell fear?

404
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,360
 >> They can smell fear.

405
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,800
 >> That makes me more scared of them.

406
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:38,960
 >> And then that's going to make them even worse, which makes you even more scared.

407
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,760
 >> Well, this is what I haven't been for 10 years, James.

408
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,760
 Gosh.

409
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,160
 >> You don't need to go as often as they say.

410
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,160
 >> Oh, wow.

411
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,160
 Okay.

412
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:50,400
 >> I mean, I, too, am more of a once a decade, once a recovery, a couple of decades kind of

413
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,840
 gal, and that's probably not often enough, but how often do most dentists recommend you

414
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:55,840
 go?

415
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,840
 >> Once every six months?

416
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:01,720
 75% of dentists in America say every six months, that has no basis in scientific fact.

417
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:05,800
 That's been around since the 18th century, and actually, the NHS recommends that for

418
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,800
 children, it should be kind of once a year, and for adults, you should be okay going every

419
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,800
 two years.

420
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,800
 >> Oh, okay.

421
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,800
 >> So there you go.

422
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,800
 >> Nice.

423
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,800
 That's pretty encouraging.

424
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:18,720
 >> The first woman who was a member of the British Dental Association was this really

425
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,720
 cool girl called Lillian Lindsay.

426
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,880
 I was reading about her, it was, I think it was sort of towards the end of the 19th century,

427
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:29,800
 and she did it because she sort of made a throwaway rebellious mark to her headmistress,

428
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,280
 and she became one of the leading dentists in the country.

429
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:36,240
 She was head of the British Dental Journal, president of the British Dental Association.

430
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,080
 She was like Britain's leading dentist by the 1930s, 1940s.

431
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,480
 The reason she became a dentist was because she was at school, and I had a headmistress

432
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:47,360
 called her into her office and said, "Look, Lillian, I think you're destined to be a

433
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:53,000
 teacher of deaf and dumb people," and Lillian said, "I absolutely refuse to be a teacher,"

434
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,360
 and the headmistress said, "Then I will prevent you from doing anything else."

435
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:01,840
 Very interesting teaching style back in the Victorian age, and so Lillian replied straight

436
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,160
 away in her words, she said, "Like a flash," I replied, "You cannot prevent me from being

437
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:10,200
 a dentist," and then she immediately realized, knowing nothing of dentistry, having stated

438
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:15,960
 that boldly, she would have to become a dentist, and she did, and she kept on not being allowed.

439
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:20,320
 When she applied to the National Dental Hospital, she had to do her interview outside on the

440
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,960
 pavement because the dean who was interviewing her said that she would distract all the men

441
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,400
 in there too much if she came inside.

442
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,400
 Oh my God.

443
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,400
 Yeah.

444
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,400
 Tough.

445
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,400
 Right.

446
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,600
 It was a bit easier to become a dentist in Mexico back in the day.

447
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:37,880
 The first female dentist in Mexico was Margarita Chornees Salazar, and she's actually the

448
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:43,040
 first woman in Latin America to get a university diploma in anything, if it was in dentistry.

449
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:48,240
 But to get her degree in dentistry, she needed a letter from her dentist saying that she knew

450
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,120
 how to be a dentist.

451
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,440
 That's so good.

452
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,440
 Well, the truth is that she had been practicing, I think, someone else in her family had been

453
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:02,120
 a dentist, and when they couldn't do it, she would do the work, and then she was like,

454
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:05,400
 "Well, I should get a degree for this because I do know how to do it," and they said, "Well,

455
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,400
 where's your evidence?

456
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,400
 Here's a letter."

457
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,400
 Right.

458
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,400
 That's amazing.

459
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,600
 It's weird because I don't think that my dentist would be a good judge of how good a dentist

460
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,600
 I would be.

461
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:17,960
 I took mild curiosity about the procedures, but it's not enough.

462
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:23,200
 You know, when you're training to be a dentist, you have to work on something called a phantom

463
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:29,320
 head, and it's just the name they provide for the head mannequin.

464
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:33,040
 That birthing device mannequin was also a phantom, wasn't it?

465
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,480
 I think phantom just meant something that was not real.

466
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,520
 But didn't we say the mannequin was missing a head?

467
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,400
 Yeah, I think this sounds like it was the head, too, in Willie Smelly's body.

468
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,400
 I think that's it.

469
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,400
 Yeah, yeah.

470
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,800
 But you used to have to provide your own teeth, not your own teeth.

471
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:49,280
 You had to provide teeth for the phantom head.

472
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,720
 Where did you get those from?

473
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,720
 I don't know.

474
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,720
 Imagine if your first dentist or you went into the room and said, "Okay, we're going

475
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,760
 to extract all of your teeth, of course, because put them in this mannequin."

476
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,760
 What?

477
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,760
 Yeah.

478
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:04,680
 But I spoke to a dentist about this, and she confirmed that since the passing of the

479
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:08,840
 tissues act, you no longer have to bring your own teeth, which is good.

480
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:13,280
 But she said the phantom head sometimes leak on you in the room, so that's a bit stressful.

481
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,720
 Hmm, leak on you.

482
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,720
 Lovely.

483
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,720
 They leak on you, yeah.

484
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,720
 Okay.

485
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,720
 What do they leak?

486
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,720
 I don't ask follow-up questions.

487
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,720
 That's what I've learned.

488
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:26,840
 How much do you reckon is the most expensive electric toothbrush on the market today?

489
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,440
 So something available to all of us in boots?

490
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,280
 Well, to all of us who have enough money for it, which might not be any of us.

491
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,280
 £1,000.

492
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,280
 A really nice one.

493
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,280
 £1,000.

494
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,280
 £5,000.

495
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,280
 £3,000.

496
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:42,520
 Wow, you've all gone – this is really unusual for these guessing games.

497
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:45,820
 Only Dan goes for £10 billion.

498
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:48,760
 Andy goes for £25 billion, and it goes for I don't care.

499
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:52,200
 But in this case, you've all gone round about the right amount.

500
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,200
 It's $4,200.

501
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,200
 Wow.

502
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,400
 Not far off, £3,000, really.

503
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,400
 That's incredible.

504
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,400
 I'll take it.

505
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:03,160
 It's the design, durability, it's got an antibacterial coating.

506
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,720
 I mean, it is that much, but they're bristle heads.

507
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,840
 They give you a free one every six months.

508
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,240
 Oh, so you're saving money, really?

509
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,240
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

510
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,960
 Actually, that only works for the first three years.

511
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,920
 After that, it's £400.

512
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,920
 Wow.

513
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:23,840
 But if you use the offer code FISH, you can get it.

514
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,560
 We do need to move on to our next fact.

515
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:29,240
 It is time for fact number three, and that is Anna.

516
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:35,200
 My fact this week is that in the Yazidi religion, Adam left paradise when a peacock pecked an

517
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:40,800
 anus in him so he could defecate, and you're not allowed to poo in the Garden of Eden.

518
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:44,440
 So he left to have a poo, is basically.

519
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,520
 He had to go outside to take a poo.

520
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,880
 And then there was the doors didn't let him back in.

521
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,600
 Not allowed back in once you left the Garden of Eden.

522
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,400
 You can't just pop out and in willy-nilly.

523
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,480
 So really smelly.

524
00:26:54,480 --> 00:27:01,440
 So, was he, so sorry, he didn't need to go to the loo until this peacock pecked him

525
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,440
 a bottom.

526
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,440
 No.

527
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,920
 Well, first of all, the peacock tricked him.

528
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:08,400
 So basically the peacock is a guy called Tawusi Melek.

529
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,520
 So in Yazidi religion, there's God, and then God has a bunch of sort of messengers, angels

530
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,520
 on earth.

531
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:17,880
 The most important one is this peacock messenger, angel, Tawusi Melek.

532
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:21,040
 And Melek had to lure Adam out of paradise.

533
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,760
 And he did so by feeding him a grain of wheat.

534
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,440
 And then as soon as Adam had eaten this grain of wheat, because he hasn't eaten for eternity.

535
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:31,640
 So that immediately goes straight through him, and he's desperate for the loo.

536
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:36,080
 And at that point, Tawusi Melek says, "Okay, I'll peck you an anus, but now I've done that.

537
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,920
 You are going to have to go outside to poo."

538
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,160
 And then he's out, and he can't get back in.

539
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:44,560
 And in this creation story, you're thinking, "Where is Eve?"

540
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,440
 And she's not really a part of this, right?

541
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,440
 No.

542
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,760
 She's not instrumental to the birth of...

543
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:53,120
 She's there, but she doesn't create the human race.

544
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,120
 Yeah.

545
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,080
 In fact, it sounds like he...

546
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,360
 Oh, Jesus, the little boy in the front row.

547
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,400
 So he's upside down.

548
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,880
 So he spends a bit of time with himself.

549
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:12,400
 And what he harvests in the process gets put into a jar.

550
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:15,160
 Have you ever considered setting cryptic crosswords there?

551
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:22,120
 But from the jar that's contained, that is where the birth of humananity came from, right?

552
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,120
 Yeah.

553
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,120
 Or Yazidi people, anyway.

554
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,120
 Yeah, the Yazidi people, rather.

555
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,520
 The Yazidi people are descended from Adam's divine essence, I think, was what you were

556
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,520
 trying to say.

557
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:35,640
 But then Eve's divine essence was put in another jar, and that became all the worms and scorpions

558
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,600
 on Earth, according to the story.

559
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,600
 Wow.

560
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,600
 Nice.

561
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,600
 Where's her PR?

562
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,600
 Wow.

563
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:47,760
 This sounds like a much more fun and strange Garden of Eden myth, doesn't it?

564
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,040
 Maybe we're just so used to...

565
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,040
 We're so used to it.

566
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,040
 It's all nuts, isn't it?

567
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,040
 Yeah.

568
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,040
 Yeah.

569
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,040
 It's just a new version.

570
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,040
 Yeah.

571
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,040
 It's just got detail of pecking and anus.

572
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,040
 Is the only thing that...

573
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,720
 Well, I mean, that's more fun.

574
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,720
 And it's a peacock.

575
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,720
 Peacocks, they're fun.

576
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,720
 They're more fun than a snake.

577
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,720
 They are, do they?

578
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,720
 Yeah.

579
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,720
 I would say.

580
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,320
 There are some versions where a dove pecks his anus, and some where a raven pecks his

581
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,680
 anus, but everyone can agree that some kind of bird pecks his anus.

582
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,440
 Oh, gosh.

583
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,240
 We can all agree.

584
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,960
 Xanus was that.

585
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,920
 People's Front of Judea, isn't it?

586
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:22,920
 Yeah.

587
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:27,440
 There are so many of these Garden of Eden stories, and there was a big rash in the

588
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,760
 19th century of people going looking for it or claiming that they found it.

589
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:38,600
 So, one Victorian historian, the first president of Boston University, claimed it was at the

590
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:43,320
 North Pole because he said it's definitely there, it's got to be there, that he had

591
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:47,000
 lots and lots of evidence, published a book which was about 500 pages long saying it's

592
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,120
 definitely at the North Pole.

593
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,800
 Evidence is a strong word, right, for what he...

594
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,360
 Really a very strong word.

595
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,360
 William Fairfield Warren said...

596
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,360
 Yeah, that was his name.

597
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,360
 Yeah, yeah.

598
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,360
 What was his evidence?

599
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:01,920
 His evidence was that we've never found the Garden of Eden and no one's ever been to

600
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,920
 the North Pole.

601
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:05,200
 That's pretty much what it was.

602
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,200
 It was circumstantial.

603
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,200
 It feels like...

604
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,200
 That makes sense.

605
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,200
 It must be that.

606
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,440
 Wasn't there a bishop who said it was on Mars as well, to really...

607
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,440
 Oh, really?

608
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,440
 Yeah.

609
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,440
 Ages ago.

610
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,440
 Oh, we've never been to Mars.

611
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,520
 And we've never been to Mars and still haven't.

612
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,520
 Very good point, James.

613
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:22,040
 That was more sensible because, you know, longer term thinking, the whole North Pole thing,

614
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:25,880
 we were going to get there in the very near future, at which point we were going to discover

615
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:29,200
 it's not the Garden of Eden unless they've all lied to us.

616
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:33,800
 There was another person who had a theory about where the Garden of Eden was and that

617
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:37,440
 was the first female presidential candidate for the United States.

618
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:42,760
 So Victoria Woodhull, who we must have mentioned before, ran for president in 1872 and she

619
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:49,040
 also wrote a big speech called The Garden of Eden in the 1870s about what she thought

620
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:52,200
 it was and she basically was ridiculing all of these people who thought the Garden of

621
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,800
 Eden was at the North Pole or on Mars or whatever.

622
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:59,600
 And she said that any schoolboy of 12 years of age who should read the description of

623
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:05,640
 this Garden and not discover it has no geographical significance ought to be reprimanded for stupidity.

624
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:09,800
 And then she went on to argue that it's all a metaphor for the female body and the female

625
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,300
 reproductive system.

626
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:16,320
 So you know, in the Garden of Eden there are four rivers that meet and she said they are

627
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,760
 the four fluids of the body.

628
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:23,040
 So one river is the blood, one is the bowels, one is the urinary and one is the reproductive

629
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,040
 system.

630
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:30,040
 So the Euphrates is the reproductive system up which the sperm flows in the Biblical

631
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:35,680
 metaphor and that was what the Bible intended us to think in order to inseminate the Garden

632
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,680
 of Eden.

633
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,680
 Okay.

634
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,680
 We've got more than four though, right?

635
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:41,560
 Well, they didn't know about bile ducts and things at the time, I guess.

636
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:44,760
 But we had like tears, that's one that's not been mentioned.

637
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,760
 That's true.

638
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,640
 Yeah, maybe she should have done tears instead of bowels, maybe bowels and urine could have

639
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,640
 gone together.

640
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,640
 Yeah, snot.

641
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,640
 If you have, if there is very snot.

642
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,640
 Yeah.

643
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,280
 These are more streams, I think, streams and tributaries.

644
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,280
 Goal.

645
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,280
 You haven't seen me.

646
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,280
 Goal.

647
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,280
 There's another one.

648
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,280
 Goal, yeah.

649
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,280
 Goal.

650
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,280
 Take it up though.

651
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,280
 Maybe this is why she didn't become president.

652
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:05,560
 It's certainly a pretty weird stump speech, yeah.

653
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:11,000
 I was looking at some other myths about birds and anuses and all that kind of stuff.

654
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,120
 Oh my goodness.

655
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:17,720
 The Taolipang people of North America, of South America, sorry.

656
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:22,760
 They have a story where all animals used to have no anus and they would always defecate

657
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,680
 through their mouths.

658
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:28,920
 But the anus was actually a separate animal called Puitu.

659
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:33,560
 And Puitu the anus would wander around slowly, but he would always annoy people by farting

660
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,560
 in their faces.

661
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,560
 What?

662
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,560
 And then running away.

663
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,560
 What is the story?

664
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:42,880
 Give us a bit more, what does this mean?

665
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,880
 What happened next?

666
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,880
 Well, it's a great story, isn't it?

667
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,600
 When you need to know what happens next.

668
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,600
 Sorry.

669
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,600
 I'll keep going.

670
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:53,960
 So the two parrots decided that they'd had enough of him farting in their faces so they

671
00:32:53,960 --> 00:33:00,200
 went to try and capture the anus and eventually they did and they tied him up and then they

672
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:06,560
 decided to cut up the anus and spread it out to all of the animals in the world.

673
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:11,640
 The tapir was really eager to get a piece and they cut out a huge piece and that's why

674
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:15,840
 the tapir has a larger anus than other animals.

675
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:20,660
 Who's creation story is this?

676
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:22,360
 This is the Taulipang.

677
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,360
 Right.

678
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,480
 I don't know, it's a good animal story.

679
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:31,840
 I think I prefer Andy's Pelican story, it just had so much to it.

680
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:38,040
 There is an Inuit folktale, the title character of it was him whose penis stretches down to

681
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:44,100
 his knees and in the middle of the story he's attacked by a raven while he's sleeping and

682
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:49,400
 by the end of the story he's known as him whose whole penis barely peeps from its cave.

683
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:55,960
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show and that is James.

684
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:00,840
 Okay, my fact this week is that the first woman to motorcycle from coast to coast in

685
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:05,400
 the United States did so with her mother in the sidecar.

686
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:18,240
 Oh, no, this is the mother and daughter team of Effie and Avis Hotchkiss and in 1915 they

687
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:23,200
 decided to go from New York to the world's fair at San Francisco but just to show it

688
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,200
 could be done really.

689
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:28,840
 We're not exactly show why they did it, Effie told one reporter that it was to demonstrate

690
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:33,840
 that motorcycling is perfectly good as a girl's sport and other people thought that she was

691
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:37,740
 just sick as she was working in Wall Street and she was sick of her clerical job and she

692
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:39,360
 wanted to see the world.

693
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:42,080
 Other people thought she just wanted to go to San Francisco and wasn't trying to break

694
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,080
 any records.

695
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,080
 She was just trying to do it.

696
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,080
 Wow.

697
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,080
 What about her mum?

698
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,080
 What do you think about why her mum went?

699
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,600
 Well, we're not sure why her mum went.

700
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:52,120
 According to some of the interviews at the time, one of the reasons might have been that

701
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:58,240
 she wanted to inflate the weight of the motorcycle because she's quite a big lady because then

702
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,920
 that would stop Effie from going too fast.

703
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:04,520
 Yeah, she was really concerned with her speed, wasn't she?

704
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,520
 Yeah.

705
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,080
 Effie had been sort of booked a few times.

706
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:11,440
 She was quite famous for kind of zipping around the town.

707
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,440
 She was getting booked.

708
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,440
 Yeah.

709
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,520
 So there's an idea that she did that.

710
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:17,560
 It could be just, again, that she wanted to see the world because she kind of taught

711
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:21,920
 her into going to the Grand Canyon and to, I don't know, Niagara Falls and places like

712
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,920
 that.

713
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:23,920
 Yeah.

714
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,920
 It sounds amazing as a trip because there weren't many, I mean, roads were really pretty

715
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:33,200
 bad at the time and they had to do a lot of mending the motorbike as they went.

716
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,480
 They had to have a gun.

717
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:38,520
 They had to shoot at rattlesnakes and coyotes at various times.

718
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,160
 I really like this detail of the journey.

719
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:44,680
 They took with them a jar of water from the Atlantic Ocean so that they could pour it

720
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:47,040
 into the Pacific Ocean when they got to California.

721
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,040
 Wow.

722
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,280
 Imagine if that had ruined everything.

723
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,280
 Suddenly the ocean just exploded.

724
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,280
 It starts to boil.

725
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:57,440
 All the animals die float to the surface.

726
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,440
 Fuck.

727
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:03,280
 This is why we don't let women on motorbikes.

728
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:07,960
 Once they had a puncture and they ran out of inner tube spares and so what they did

729
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:12,640
 was they just got blankets and stuffed it into the wheels so that it would keep going.

730
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,840
 So that was kind of how it was in those days.

731
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:18,200
 Once you got to the Midwest, it was like you say, no roads.

732
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,160
 It was pretty hard to get anywhere.

733
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,160
 I like that.

734
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:26,040
 It does sound like the mother, like she was there just to slow them down and keep on top

735
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:30,080
 of speed but also it sounds like whenever they stopped and had to do stuff, she just

736
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,560
 remained in the sidecar.

737
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:36,580
 She just wasn't interested in getting out and at one point she was taught tatting which

738
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:39,080
 is it's kind of like, you know, lace.

739
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:45,640
 It's like weaving lace together and so she just tatted the whole way across America just

740
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:49,320
 making these beautiful little pieces of fabric.

741
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,320
 Yeah.

742
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,320
 I mean maybe she couldn't get out.

743
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:55,520
 She was a larger lady and an older lady presumably and the sidecar is quite low.

744
00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:00,720
 And maybe she was just too embarrassed to say all the way across, I really can't stand

745
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:01,720
 up.

746
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:07,200
 Well they really struggled to find a sidecar that fit, not just because of her but also

747
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,920
 they had all of the gear as well, right?

748
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:12,960
 They had absolutely tons of stuff and eventually what they called it was the bathtub, which

749
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,840
 explains the size and shape of it.

750
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:15,840
 It was a real big thing.

751
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,760
 And because it had a jar of water in it.

752
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:22,920
 She brought a gun with her as well.

753
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:23,920
 Yeah.

754
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,480
 It was standard, wasn't it?

755
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:30,200
 It was completely standard equipment for just being, like traveling across America at the

756
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,200
 time.

757
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,200
 I think it's part of the course now.

758
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,200
 To be honest guys.

759
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,200
 Oh yeah, good point.

760
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:37,120
 Yeah, I'd say that like it's a weird thing, yeah, of course.

761
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:41,640
 The following year there were sisters, the Van Buren sisters, who did the same thing but

762
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:46,240
 did it together, a bike to cross together, I think with no one in the sidecar.

763
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:49,480
 And they did it to prove that women could be dispatch riders so that they could free up

764
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:52,680
 men to fight in World War One.

765
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:56,560
 So you know, trying to help and not only were they arrested multiple times on the way for

766
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:00,440
 wearing men's clothes, they were then not accepted into the army.

767
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,440
 For wearing, they were arrested not for doing anything else.

768
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:05,600
 Yeah, in a lot of parts of America you weren't allowed to wear trousers if you were a woman.

769
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,600
 Yeah.

770
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,600
 Yeah, that's what they did them for.

771
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,600
 Yeah.

772
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,840
 But you can't wear a skirt because it blows up on a bike if one sees your pants.

773
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:13,200
 So it's a rock and a hard place.

774
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,200
 Yeah.

775
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:17,320
 And they did not get accepted into the army at the end.

776
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:20,240
 So a complete waste of time.

777
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:23,960
 And there was Alice Hewler Ramsey, who drove a car.

778
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:24,960
 This was not a motorbike.

779
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,480
 She was the first woman to drive a car from coast to coast.

780
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,880
 She did so with two of her sisters-in-law and a friend.

781
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,080
 They went from one to the other.

782
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:37,960
 And the headline in the San Francisco Chronicle the next day was, "Pretty women motorists

783
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:40,440
 arrive after a trip across the continent."

784
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:43,280
 And one of them was called Margaret Atwood.

785
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,280
 No.

786
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,280
 Really?

787
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,480
 Not thee, but you know, still cool.

788
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,440
 She had a good trip, Alice Ramsey.

789
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:54,280
 She had various obstacles along the way, but she wasn't really allowed to say so because

790
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:58,400
 the reason she was doing it was because she was driving in a Maxwell Briscoe company car,

791
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,400
 a Maxwell car.

792
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:05,620
 And it was the company's idea for them to do it, to say, "Look, our car can drive even

793
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:07,480
 a woman across America."

794
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:11,560
 So even though it broke down various times along the way, and she had to fix it herself,

795
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:14,800
 had to wait for mechanics to come out, in fact, she said there was an awkward moment

796
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:20,040
 where they had to replace a coil, and they had to wait for a while for a coil.

797
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:22,320
 When you say coil, you mean part of the car, right?

798
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,320
 The coil in the car, yeah.

799
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:27,040
 Reproductive technology wasn't that advanced back then.

800
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:31,580
 But yeah, the crowd surrounded her and shunted, "Get a horse!"

801
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:32,580
 Which is embarrassing.

802
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:33,580
 Get a horse!

803
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:36,440
 Get a horse, love!

804
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:39,580
 And the horse lobby was a big one back then.

805
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:43,960
 So another problem they found was they used guidebooks, which would just be lists of landmarks

806
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:44,960
 to follow.

807
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:48,680
 So they'd say things like, you know, take the big oak tree, get to the oak tree, turn

808
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:51,440
 right along the white fence, et cetera.

809
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:55,960
 And the problem was the landmarks used to change, and specifically there was a yellow

810
00:39:55,960 --> 00:40:01,360
 house and barn in their instructions, but the owner of it was a horse loyalist, hated

811
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:08,320
 this new motor thing, and so he repainted his barn red, deliberately to send them off

812
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,320
 the trail.

813
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,320
 That's so funny.

814
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,320
 Wow.

815
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,320
 Amazingly, they made it.

816
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:15,800
 And what they would do is, there were telephone lines there, weren't there?

817
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:19,720
 And they would just follow whatever the telephone wires had the most wires on them.

818
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:23,520
 They thought, "Well, that must be going towards a big town," and they kind of navigated through

819
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,520
 the towns that way.

820
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,520
 That's clever.

821
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,520
 Smart.

822
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:29,440
 Well, motorcyclists as well used to go on the railroad tracks, didn't they, when they

823
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,800
 were just like, "Well, this will definitely just lead me to where, yeah."

824
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:37,000
 And it's, you know, I'll just move when there's a train, but otherwise they'll get me there.

825
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,720
 So are you reading about George Wyman?

826
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,720
 Yeah, I think so.

827
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:40,720
 Yeah.

828
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:46,000
 So he was the first person to take a motorbike across America, 1903 this was, and it was

829
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,240
 basically a bike as well.

830
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,520
 It wasn't really a motorbike.

831
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:52,080
 It was a bike which had a motor on it, kind of like an e-bike, basically.

832
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,080
 Yeah.

833
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,080
 Yeah.

834
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:59,800
 And he had a camera, he had a change of clothes and a gun, obviously, and it was so broken

835
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,080
 down by the end of the journey.

836
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:06,440
 His motor worked so badly that he had to cycle the last 150 miles, just pedaling his motorbike.

837
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:12,000
 But he cycled on railroad tracks, but across the West, so you know, the sleepers, he was

838
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:17,680
 just cycling over the sleepers, bum, bum, bum, bum, but he miles and miles and miles.

839
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:21,880
 And it's created a thing that you can do today, which I really like, which is called the Iron

840
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:29,560
 Butt Association, and it's if you cycle, sorry, if you motorcycle a thousand miles in 24 hours

841
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:30,560
 of riding.

842
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:34,880
 Yeah, not if you, no one has ever cycled a thousand miles in 24 hours, but if you motorbike

843
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,160
 like that, you get, you join the Iron Butt Association.

844
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,160
 Yeah, that's really cool.

845
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,160
 Yeah.

846
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,080
 Do you guys hear of the first person to walk across America?

847
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,080
 No.

848
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,080
 No?

849
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,080
 It's great.

850
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:46,200
 In fact, it's someone we've mentioned on this podcast, friend of the podcast, I would

851
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:51,480
 say, he's called Edward Payson-Weston, known as the Wiley Wobbler.

852
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,680
 I can't remember.

853
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:58,360
 He was the founder of pedestrianism, and he did all these walking challenges.

854
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:02,760
 He would walk, you know, 500 miles in five days or whatever it was.

855
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,760
 500 more.

856
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:10,240
 He would walk, yeah, and he was the man who walked a thousand miles to turn up in California,

857
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,000
 it turns out, walking across.

858
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:17,120
 When you say he was a founder of pedestrianism, because it's not like everyone else was driving

859
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,120
 a car until he came along.

860
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:23,320
 No, it was in much the same way that William Smelly was the father of midwifery.

861
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:26,320
 People had walked before, but he perfected it.

862
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,320
 I see.

863
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,320
 He perfected the form.

864
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,320
 He got the tools.

865
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:36,360
 America, for the first time, aged 70, and then he did it again, aged 71, and 500,000

866
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:40,060
 people supposedly turned up to see him arrive in New York.

867
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:41,060
 Big deal.

868
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:42,060
 Oh my God.

869
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,560
 He was world famous just for walking.

870
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:48,740
 He walked across America when he was 70, which presumably would take about a year, and then

871
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:49,740
 he walked it at 71.

872
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:51,240
 Took him 100 days.

873
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,240
 100 days only.

874
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,240
 Yeah.

875
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:54,240
 To walk America.

876
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,240
 I know.

877
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,240
 He was the Wiley Wobbler.

878
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,240
 I knew he was Wiley.

879
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,240
 He was the Wiley Wobbler.

880
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:02,080
 And then he came to Britain and he walked all around Britain and people went nuts.

881
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,760
 He must have found that piss easy.

882
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:04,760
 He absolutely did.

883
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:09,240
 Peter K. He walked 5,000 miles around Britain in 1884.

884
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:10,240
 Get this.

885
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,240
 I love this line.

886
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:16,720
 "The Royal Society, very eminent body, announced that his feet is the greatest recorded labor

887
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:20,280
 that any human being has ever undertaken without injury."

888
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,280
 Right.

889
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,280
 Imagine getting that accolade.

890
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:25,240
 The feet were his feet, which it is.

891
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:26,240
 His feet.

892
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,880
 I'm surprised you can even get 5,000 miles around.

893
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,200
 He must have gone right around the coast.

894
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:31,200
 You got a webball.

895
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,200
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

896
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:33,200
 You walk.

897
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,200
 You do the...

898
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:37,120
 I remember when I used to live by the coast, I used to go for a run in the morning and

899
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:40,000
 I would run for 30 minutes along the coast.

900
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,920
 But because of fractal geometry, that meant that I'd gone an infinite distance.

901
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:44,920
 All right.

902
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:45,920
 Sure.

903
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:49,720
 Just watch the mathematicians there.

904
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:52,760
 Guys, we need to wrap up very soon.

905
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,640
 Oh, really?

906
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:55,640
 The Cannonball Run.

907
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:56,640
 Do you know this?

908
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:57,640
 The one thing?

909
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:01,680
 Cannonball Run is the speed record across America for driving.

910
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:08,200
 The current record is 25 hours and 55 minutes to drive from one side to the other.

911
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:09,200
 What?

912
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:14,400
 The record was beaten only four times between 2006 and 2019, and then it was beaten five

913
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,880
 times in 2020.

914
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:19,800
 Pretty quiet, yeah, for everybody.

915
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:22,560
 Basically no police on the roads, no cars on the roads.

916
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,320
 They could just go as fast as they wanted.

917
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,600
 Yeah, it's very illegal, isn't it?

918
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:31,280
 The average speed for that guy, Fred Ashmore, I think it's called, is 108 miles an hour.

919
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,280
 Average speed.

920
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:33,280
 Yeah.

921
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,600
 It's insane.

922
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:39,700
 The amount of logistics it takes to organise it, because they all have spot cars going

923
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:41,920
 ahead to say if they see any police, don't they?

924
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:42,920
 Exactly.

925
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:44,440
 And he had to...

926
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:49,400
 He removed all the seats in the car and he got an extra special kind of gasoline tank

927
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:51,000
 so he could get more in.

928
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,960
 And this was a rental car.

929
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:57,920
 Afterwards, he had to put it all back together again.

930
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:03,280
 I love to be the guy at the rental place who's just recording the mileage on the car.

931
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:05,400
 Oh, that's funny.

932
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:10,360
 You rented this yesterday and it's got 3,000 miles more.

933
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:16,320
 The first all-female motorcycling stunt group in the UK was called the Motobirds.

934
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:20,360
 They were formed in Leicester in the '70s, and every year they would try and jump over

935
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:23,480
 a river in Leicester, and they always failed.

936
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,420
 They could never quite get it working.

937
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:29,520
 And then one time, the final time they tried it, they really souped up their motorbike.

938
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:34,120
 They jumped over, landed on the other side of the river in the net, bounced out of the

939
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:36,360
 net and back into the river.

940
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:40,040
 Look, guys, we need to wrap up.

941
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:41,520
 Okay, that is it.

942
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:42,800
 That is all of our facts.

943
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,520

 Peterborough, thank you so much.

954
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:14,880
 That was so much fun.

955

 Goodbye!

960
