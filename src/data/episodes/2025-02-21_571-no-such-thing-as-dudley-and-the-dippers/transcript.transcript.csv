00:00:12,00:00:16,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,"
00:00:16,00:00:19,a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Hoburn.
00:00:19,00:00:20,"My name is Dan Schreiber,"
00:00:20,00:00:22,"I'm sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,"
00:00:22,00:00:24,Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin.
00:00:24,00:00:27,"Once again, we have gathered around the microphones with"
00:00:27,00:00:29,"our four favorite facts from the last seven days,"
00:00:29,00:00:33,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:33,00:00:36,"Starting with fact number one, that is Anna."
00:00:36,00:00:40,"My fact this week is that ancient Rome had a secret name,"
00:00:40,00:00:44,and no one knows what it was to this very day.
00:00:44,00:00:44,To this day.
00:00:44,00:00:46,To this very day.
00:00:46,00:00:48,It's very cool.
00:00:48,00:00:48,It is very cool.
00:00:48,00:00:50,"It also, when you're looking into it,"
00:00:50,00:00:52,it also seems like did they?
00:00:52,00:00:54,Was there definitely a secret name?
00:00:54,00:00:55,Why do you think they're all making it up?
00:00:55,00:00:57,It seems like it might have been something that was written by
00:00:57,00:00:59,historians a bit later.
00:00:59,00:01:00,"No, no, it was written at the time."
00:01:00,00:01:03,"It was so, there's a bunch of ancient sources that claim it"
00:01:03,00:01:04,from about the first century onwards.
00:01:04,00:01:07,"So it's Plinian Plutarch of the first, but they quote."
00:01:07,00:01:10,"Paulini, she's quoting Paulini."
00:01:10,00:01:11,"Yeah, yeah."
00:01:11,00:01:14,It was about six or seven different writers throughout
00:01:14,00:01:17,the ancient Roman period saying this was a thing with
00:01:17,00:01:19,like varying different accounts of what exactly it was.
00:01:19,00:01:23,"But they mostly said it's a name that only very few people know,"
00:01:23,00:01:25,"like just really extreme dignitaries,"
00:01:25,00:01:28,with the queen and her corgis basically.
00:01:28,00:01:30,"And then even though they know it,"
00:01:30,00:01:32,"they're not allowed to say it, even in special ceremonies."
00:01:32,00:01:33,"A couple of the writers said,"
00:01:33,00:01:38,"""Sometimes in ceremonies they say the name, but no, there was..."""
00:01:38,00:01:39,What do you reckon it was?
00:01:39,00:01:40,"There's a few ideas, right?"
00:01:40,00:01:42,There are some ideas which are bullshit.
00:01:42,00:01:43,Amor.
00:01:43,00:01:46,"Amor is the main one, first mentioned in the sixth century."
00:01:46,00:01:48,An anagram of Rome.
00:01:48,00:01:50,"Indeed, just Rome backwards."
00:01:50,00:01:50,The paladrome.
00:01:50,00:01:53,"And they call the city of love, don't they?"
00:01:53,00:01:55,"That is Paris, famously."
00:01:55,00:02:00,"Yes, Syrap I call it."
00:02:00,00:02:03,"Yeah, there is that theory which is from a scholar called"
00:02:03,00:02:06,"John the Lydian in the sixth century who said,"
00:02:06,00:02:08,"just confidently, it was called Amor."
00:02:08,00:02:09,That was a secret name.
00:02:09,00:02:10,We don't seem to have evidence for that.
00:02:10,00:02:12,And why?
00:02:12,00:02:14,"For protection, I think so."
00:02:14,00:02:16,There's also a lot of stuff alongside it saying
00:02:16,00:02:19,there was a secret goddess who protected Rome.
00:02:19,00:02:22,And the reason you can't say the goddess's name
00:02:22,00:02:24,is that then your enemies will know her name
00:02:24,00:02:26,and then they can use her and they can call upon her
00:02:26,00:02:27,"and say, help me and stress."
00:02:27,00:02:28,"She would defect was the idea, right?"
00:02:28,00:02:29,"She defect, yeah."
00:02:29,00:02:30,And go with the enemy.
00:02:30,00:02:33,"So that's quite a common thing, I think, with gods, right?"
00:02:33,00:02:35,"It's like if you know their name,"
00:02:35,00:02:37,then you can tell them what to do kind of thing.
00:02:37,00:02:39,I think they happen in Egypt quite a lot.
00:02:39,00:02:41,"Like in the Book of the Dead, for instance,"
00:02:41,00:02:45,"when you go to the underworld, you have to pass through these gates."
00:02:45,00:02:48,"But the only way you can pass through is if you name the gods,"
00:02:48,00:02:49,"because you name them and when you've got the name,"
00:02:49,00:02:51,they have to do whatever you tell them.
00:02:51,00:02:54,"Is that, I mean, I'm hearing Rumpelstiltskin big time here."
00:02:54,00:02:55,"Oh, yes."
00:02:55,00:02:57,"It's basically the same story, isn't it?"
00:02:57,00:02:58,Yeah.
00:02:58,00:03:00,"Except he's going to, what is it, he's going to marry you"
00:03:00,00:03:02,"if you don't know his name, he'll marry you,"
00:03:02,00:03:05,"which is a bigger, is a more immediate threat."
00:03:05,00:03:06,Yeah.
00:03:06,00:03:09,There is a lot of people who've come up with ideas about this.
00:03:09,00:03:15,"So the Roma Amour idea, there was an author called Dolores Prato."
00:03:15,00:03:17,And she said that one reason for saying
00:03:17,00:03:20,that this could be the case is a lot of early Romans
00:03:20,00:03:23,used to read and write from right to left.
00:03:23,00:03:26,So they were very good at knowing...
00:03:26,00:03:26,Palantroes.
00:03:26,00:03:28,"Palantroes, basically."
00:03:28,00:03:31,"Wait, did they, why did they read and write from right as in..."
00:03:31,00:03:34,"Early Romans, according to Dolores Prato."
00:03:34,00:03:36,"Maybe Arabic influences, I don't know."
00:03:36,00:03:37,Is that likely?
00:03:37,00:03:39,"In ancient, in the penitentiary."
00:03:39,00:03:41,I've never heard that.
00:03:41,00:03:44,I'll tell you one thing they did do is they used to write like
00:03:44,00:03:48,"secret squares, right, where you would write loads of five-letter words"
00:03:48,00:03:50,one after the other.
00:03:50,00:03:53,And then the last one would be the reverse of the first one.
00:03:53,00:03:55,And then if you read them up and down or left and right
00:03:55,00:03:57,"or on the diagonals, they all said the same thing."
00:03:57,00:03:59,Abracadabra is one of those words.
00:03:59,00:04:00,"Well, you can write it in a triangle."
00:04:00,00:04:02,So it's like one of those.
00:04:02,00:04:03,And that's very powerful.
00:04:03,00:04:06,There's a famous thing called the Sattor Square.
00:04:06,00:04:06,"Oh, yes."
00:04:06,00:04:09,"Sattor something, opera something, rotors."
00:04:09,00:04:12,"In fact, it sounds like Prato is a name that would fit"
00:04:12,00:04:13,in one of these mystical squares.
00:04:13,00:04:14,Dolores Prato.
00:04:14,00:04:15,"Yeah, and what is that?"
00:04:15,00:04:18,"Prato must be an anagram that says gotcha, you know,"
00:04:18,00:04:21,"something like that, obviously not that."
00:04:21,00:04:24,So there was someone supposedly who was executed for saying the name.
00:04:24,00:04:26,"Yes, you know, it was terrible punishment if you said it."
00:04:26,00:04:28,"Soranus, he was called."
00:04:28,00:04:29,Stop it.
00:04:29,00:04:30,"Well, what, CJ?"
00:04:30,00:04:31,He was called Soranus.
00:04:31,00:04:35,"Now, people who listen to the podcast might remember Soranus."
00:04:35,00:04:40,There was a guy called Soranus of Ephesus who came up with the idea
00:04:40,00:04:42,of a midwife putting their fingers up your bum
00:04:42,00:04:45,to orient the head of a baby before you give birth.
00:04:45,00:04:47,But it's not that Soranus.
00:04:47,00:04:49,It's a different Soranus.
00:04:49,00:04:51,And this Soranus is according to Pliny.
00:04:51,00:04:56,He was the first writer to provide a table of contents in a book ever.
00:04:56,00:04:58,"Before that, if you wanted to look something up,"
00:04:58,00:05:00,you just had to read the whole thing.
00:05:00,00:05:03,But he invented the idea of putting a table of contents.
00:05:03,00:05:06,And then he got into a barney with some of the bloke.
00:05:06,00:05:08,And then he went to court and he said the name of Rome
00:05:08,00:05:09,and he got executed.
00:05:09,00:05:10,"Yeah, right."
00:05:10,00:05:12,But the main thing is the contents thing.
00:05:12,00:05:14,Which is a bigger contribution to history?
00:05:14,00:05:16,Which Soranus?
00:05:16,00:05:18,"Well, I think Soranus, the midwife."
00:05:18,00:05:21,You say Soranus and I say Soranus.
00:05:21,00:05:24,"I think the midwife guy, because he's saved quite a lot of wives with that."
00:05:24,00:05:25,Does that work?
00:05:25,00:05:26,It does work.
00:05:26,00:05:27,"Yeah, I didn't know that."
00:05:27,00:05:30,"If you've got a breech baby and not like a full breech one,"
00:05:30,00:05:32,but if you're just trying to move the head in the right place.
00:05:32,00:05:34,"But if you don't have a table of contents,"
00:05:34,00:05:37,how can you even read a midwifery book to learn that in the first place?
00:05:37,00:05:40,"Well, fairness, Anus will be right near the start of the book."
00:05:40,00:05:41,That's true.
00:05:41,00:05:44,"I wonder, you know, that thing of in ancient Rome,"
00:05:44,00:05:45,so many things would have been invented.
00:05:45,00:05:48,So many amazing characters who've been lost through the footnotes of time.
00:05:48,00:05:52,And do we have two Soranuses purely because their name is Soranus?
00:05:52,00:05:58,"You have so misunderstood classical historians, I don't know where to start."
00:05:58,00:06:01,"There are a lot of these sort of mystery cults, weren't there?"
00:06:01,00:06:05,"So this name of Rome was to be used in sacred rituals, you know?"
00:06:05,00:06:07,"Maybe, according to Sun."
00:06:07,00:06:12,"Okay, well, if it's never used, then what are we all doing here?"
00:06:12,00:06:15,"I mean, but there was a place called the Cave of Rome."
00:06:15,00:06:16,Did you hear of this?
00:06:16,00:06:17,No. This is great.
00:06:17,00:06:20,This is buried deep under the ruins of the palace of the Emperor Augustus.
00:06:20,00:06:26,"It was full of mosaics and seashells, which is pretty cool."
00:06:26,00:06:30,"And this may, according to legend,"
00:06:30,00:06:33,this is where Rome itself came to be.
00:06:33,00:06:37,OK. I.E. where Romulus and Remus got suckled.
00:06:37,00:06:39,"They were found there by the wolf, the twins."
00:06:39,00:06:41,I didn't know they were the sons of the God Mars.
00:06:41,00:06:44,That gets glossed over a lot in the story.
00:06:44,00:06:46,"Like, they were Nepo babies, basically."
00:06:46,00:06:49,They were just random twin babies who were left and then found by all.
00:06:49,00:06:51,"I don't think they are in all stories, are they?"
00:06:51,00:06:53,"OK, maybe not. They might be."
00:06:53,00:06:55,"But there were ceremonies there for hundreds of years,"
00:06:55,00:06:57,and that's the secret cave of Rome.
00:06:57,00:06:58,Do we know where it is?
00:06:58,00:07:00,"It's under the ruins of the palace of the Emperor Augustus,"
00:07:00,00:07:02,"as I said, 30 seconds ago."
00:07:02,00:07:03,But it's a real thing.
00:07:03,00:07:04,"Yeah, it's real. Right."
00:07:04,00:07:09,"On these secretive cults, I think my favourite is Mithraism or Mithraism."
00:07:10,00:07:12,"The thing about secret cults is they were really secret,"
00:07:12,00:07:14,so no one was allowed to write anything down or say anything.
00:07:14,00:07:17,"So it was all just rumour about what happened there,"
00:07:17,00:07:18,based on what people said.
00:07:18,00:07:22,But they did stuff like there was lots of archaeological sources
00:07:22,00:07:25,"of Mithraic temples, where there's people killing bulls."
00:07:25,00:07:27,There's one in London.
00:07:27,00:07:28,There's a Mithraium in London.
00:07:28,00:07:29,Yes.
00:07:29,00:07:31,They found it when they were excavating.
00:07:31,00:07:32,I can't remember what they were digging up.
00:07:32,00:07:34,"Yes, it's Rael or something."
00:07:34,00:07:36,"I think it was near the Museum of London, weirdly, it was found."
00:07:36,00:07:39,"Yeah, and they reconstructed what it would have looked like."
00:07:39,00:07:42,"And at the end, there's the classic image of Mithra slaughtering a bull."
00:07:42,00:07:47,That was the big image of him wearing a Phrygian cap and Anatolian trousers.
00:07:47,00:07:48,"Oh, lovely. That was his..."
00:07:48,00:07:49,I can picture it now.
00:07:49,00:07:51,That was his look.
00:07:51,00:07:52,I think Phrygian cap is what the Smurfs wear.
00:07:52,00:07:53,"Yeah, yeah, they do."
00:07:53,00:07:55,"And Anatolian trousers, I don't know what they are."
00:07:55,00:07:57,They're just trousers from modern-day Turkey.
00:07:57,00:07:59,I imagined black pirate pants.
00:07:59,00:08:02,"I remember, yeah, like whirling dervish pants,"
00:08:02,00:08:05,so quite wide around the thighs and then tight around the knees.
00:08:05,00:08:06,Yes.
00:08:06,00:08:07,It's like MC Hammer.
00:08:07,00:08:08,"Yes, exactly."
00:08:08,00:08:09,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:08:09,00:08:11,"It was a primitive MC Hammer cult, basically."
00:08:11,00:08:12,That's what he's based on.
00:08:12,00:08:15,My favourite place in Rome is Amethraic Temple.
00:08:15,00:08:19,It is by far the coolest site.
00:08:19,00:08:20,"Forget everything else, forget the Coliseum."
00:08:20,00:08:22,"About five minutes from the Coliseum,"
00:08:22,00:08:23,there's the Basilica of San Clement.
00:08:23,00:08:24,Have you guys been to it?
00:08:24,00:08:26,"No, I think I might have been, maybe."
00:08:26,00:08:29,"It's an 11th-century church, you go in, 11th-century church."
00:08:29,00:08:34,"And there was a cleric who worked in the church in 1867,"
00:08:34,00:08:35,"the friar who worked in the church,"
00:08:35,00:08:38,"who just found that underneath it was hollow,"
00:08:38,00:08:40,"and so they excavated underneath,"
00:08:40,00:08:42,"and they found a fourth-century church,"
00:08:42,00:08:44,and now you can go descend down into that.
00:08:44,00:08:47,"So that's, you know, in the olden days, things were lower down"
00:08:47,00:08:49,because the ground hadn't accumulated on top of it yet.
00:08:49,00:08:50,"And that's incredible,"
00:08:50,00:08:52,"and you're looking at fourth-century stuff, artwork preserved."
00:08:52,00:08:53,Wow.
00:08:53,00:08:57,"And then, here it comes, a layer below they discover,"
00:08:57,00:09:00,"not one, but two things, an ancient Roman house,"
00:09:00,00:09:03,"which you can now wander through, deep underground,"
00:09:03,00:09:05,"and the Amethraic Temple,"
00:09:05,00:09:06,which you can sit in.
00:09:06,00:09:08,"It's the coolest thing ever,"
00:09:08,00:09:11,"and you can sit there and pretend to be taking, you know,"
00:09:11,00:09:13,sermons from the bullkiller or...
00:09:13,00:09:14,"Wow, that's very cool."
00:09:14,00:09:15,"Yeah, that's awesome."
00:09:15,00:09:15,That's really cool.
00:09:15,00:09:17,We don't know much about these places
00:09:17,00:09:19,because you weren't supposed to...
00:09:19,00:09:21,"You weren't supposed to go there if you weren't allowed,"
00:09:21,00:09:23,"and you often didn't write about them, right?"
00:09:23,00:09:25,"Yes, exactly, it was only for initiates."
00:09:25,00:09:26,"But there was one,"
00:09:26,00:09:29,there was a festival of the goddess of fertility
00:09:29,00:09:31,who's called Bonadir.
00:09:31,00:09:33,"It was only women who were allowed to go,"
00:09:33,00:09:35,"and since men were the people who write stuff down,"
00:09:35,00:09:38,we didn't really know anything about it.
00:09:38,00:09:39,But there was a huge scandal
00:09:39,00:09:44,"because a guy called Publius Claudius Pulcher, or Pulca,"
00:09:44,00:09:46,he disguised himself as a woman in 62 BC
00:09:46,00:09:48,"and went to the festival,"
00:09:48,00:09:50,"and when people found out about it,"
00:09:50,00:09:53,"oh, my days, this is bad news, oh, boy."
00:09:53,00:09:57,I think that story is in one of Cicero's speeches.
00:09:57,00:10:00,I think I've read the prosecution speech from that trial.
00:10:00,00:10:02,"I think it exists, wow."
00:10:02,00:10:05,But the interesting thing is
00:10:05,00:10:09,that he was prosecuted for incest.
00:10:09,00:10:10,What?
00:10:10,00:10:13,"Claudius was one of the sort of chief gang dudes in ancient Rome,"
00:10:13,00:10:17,"and he had a very, very attractive sister."
00:10:17,00:10:18,And there was a big--
00:10:18,00:10:19,"That's no excuse, Andy."
00:10:19,00:10:21,"Absolutely not, but it was a big..."
00:10:21,00:10:23,"Your honor, but your honor."
00:10:23,00:10:24,"Just look at her, your honor."
00:10:24,00:10:30,"Yeah, and that was one of his big rivalries."
00:10:30,00:10:32,"But can I say, for the listener,"
00:10:32,00:10:33,"even though he was done for incest,"
00:10:33,00:10:36,he hadn't had sex with his sister.
00:10:36,00:10:37,"It was like a technical thing,"
00:10:37,00:10:39,because there was a thing about
00:10:39,00:10:41,"if you had sex with a Vestal Virgin,"
00:10:41,00:10:43,"then that was counted as incest,"
00:10:43,00:10:47,because they were kind of the children of the city kind of thing
00:10:47,00:10:49,who looked after the city and all that kind of stuff.
00:10:49,00:10:51,"And this was like an extension of this,"
00:10:51,00:10:54,because he defiled this cult of women.
00:10:54,00:10:56,"It counted technically as incest,"
00:10:56,00:10:58,even though none of them was related to him.
00:10:58,00:11:00,"Hang on, why do we know his sister so well?"
00:11:00,00:11:01,"He also had, in his speech,"
00:11:01,00:11:03,"I'm pretty sure I remember Cicero says,"
00:11:03,00:11:04,"""Look at the sister on him though."""
00:11:04,00:11:07,"You know, he was very much implying that he had also,"
00:11:07,00:11:09,"I think, slept with his actual sister."
00:11:09,00:11:12,"That was a sort of low trick from Cicero, it wasn't so..."
00:11:12,00:11:14,"Is that, James, what you said is that unbiased history,"
00:11:14,00:11:17,"or is that the defense lawyer's speech that you read,"
00:11:17,00:11:18,that you got those facts?
00:11:18,00:11:19,I don't know.
00:11:19,00:11:21,"Like, I got it from Wikipedia, I'll be honest."
00:11:21,00:11:23,"Now, I did read some of the..."
00:11:23,00:11:25,I read the Cicero thing.
00:11:25,00:11:26,"Like, I don't think it's biased."
00:11:26,00:11:27,I think this is stuff that actually happened.
00:11:27,00:11:29,"No, that's just he got in trouble"
00:11:29,00:11:31,"for invading the woman's space, as people shouldn't."
00:11:31,00:11:32,But did he find out anything good?
00:11:32,00:11:33,What were they doing?
00:11:33,00:11:35,Were they all teaching how to insert tampons and stuff?
00:11:35,00:11:40,They were all reading scary stories and kissing each other.
00:11:40,00:11:43,Knew it! Knew it!
00:11:43,00:11:45,"Hey, can I tell you very quickly,"
00:11:45,00:11:48,"this is not Ancient Rome, but it's Ancient China."
00:11:48,00:11:49,It's a pretty astonishing thing.
00:11:49,00:11:50,I was just looking into general secrets
00:11:50,00:11:53,that we still don't know much about.
00:11:53,00:11:54,"For a good 3,000 years,"
00:11:54,00:11:58,"there was a secret women's language called Nuxu,"
00:11:58,00:12:01,"which is lady writing, basically."
00:12:01,00:12:03,And it was for women who needed to pass on information
00:12:03,00:12:05,to each other that they didn't want men to have any idea about.
00:12:05,00:12:07,And they created an entire script.
00:12:07,00:12:11,It's only in the 1980s that we even found out it existed.
00:12:11,00:12:14,"It lasted, yeah, for close to 3,000 years."
00:12:14,00:12:16,"So, the only thing I noticed is you guys found out it existed."
00:12:16,00:12:17,We actually know...
00:12:17,00:12:19,"No, if you've ever watched ITV,"
00:12:19,00:12:23,the show Loose Women is actually broadcast in that language.
00:12:23,00:12:26,And this language that women only speak is called New Shoes.
00:12:30,00:12:32,Sex in the city is based on a lot of it's writing.
00:12:32,00:12:34,"Yeah, but it's amazing that it's all these years."
00:12:34,00:12:37,"And it's coming back, the last writers of it"
00:12:37,00:12:39,"died a couple of decades ago,"
00:12:39,00:12:42,"but they've worked it out and they're teaching it again,"
00:12:42,00:12:43,and so it's becoming a language again.
00:12:43,00:12:44,It's beautiful to look at.
00:12:44,00:12:46,"It's actually, as someone pointed out, very sexy to look at."
00:12:46,00:12:50,"If writing could be sexy, this is it, yeah."
00:12:50,00:12:53,Have you guys heard of boob slang?
00:12:53,00:12:55,"This is not related to Nuxu, by the way."
00:12:55,00:12:58,This is a modern thing. This is New Zealand we're in now.
00:12:58,00:13:01,And what's an environment where you get a lot of slang?
00:13:01,00:13:04,- Sailors. - Not far off.
00:13:04,00:13:05,It's an enclosed space.
00:13:05,00:13:06,- Workshop. - Prisons.
00:13:06,00:13:09,"- Prisons. - Oh, it's not far off."
00:13:09,00:13:12,"I just want to say, it's when he's sailor's listening."
00:13:12,00:13:15,"Yeah, we know what you did, and you're very lucky"
00:13:15,00:13:18,"that you haven't been banged up yet, no."
00:13:18,00:13:20,"What are they going to do, James? They're at sea."
00:13:20,00:13:22,I could just hear right now.
00:13:22,00:13:24,Set a course for London.
00:13:24,00:13:26,"Right now, ships are turning."
00:13:26,00:13:27,I just need to stay.
00:13:27,00:13:29,"I just need to stay in central Leicestershire,"
00:13:29,00:13:31,and I'll be fine.
00:13:31,00:13:32,No boob.
00:13:32,00:13:33,Grand Eugie and Camel!
00:13:33,00:13:43,No boob slang is a New Zealand prison language.
00:13:43,00:13:45,"And it has 3,000 separate words."
00:13:45,00:13:48,"So obviously, let's get into it."
00:13:48,00:13:50,What is boob?
00:13:50,00:13:52,It's the name of the language.
00:13:52,00:13:54,"Yeah, well, boob slang is the language."
00:13:54,00:13:57,"- Oh, it's the boob. - It's the name of the person."
00:13:57,00:13:58,- It's prison. - It's prison.
00:13:58,00:14:00,- We're in the boob. - We're in boob.
00:14:00,00:14:03,So what's a boob story?
00:14:03,00:14:06,- It's a story that you tell when you're in prison. - Prison story.
00:14:06,00:14:08,Are they all hang-up?
00:14:08,00:14:11,And that's how they all work.
00:14:11,00:14:14,What are boob handcuffs?
00:14:14,00:14:16,"I said, has anyone eaten boob lunch today?"
00:14:16,00:14:19,What am I asking?
00:14:19,00:14:23,"I think boob story is how you ended up in the big house, basically."
00:14:23,00:14:24,"All right, what's a double yoka?"
00:14:24,00:14:26,"Oh, a double yoka."
00:14:26,00:14:30,- Is it two black eyes? - Is it a bit of great luck?
00:14:30,00:14:32,It's just an idiot.
00:14:32,00:14:33,A double yoka. I don't know why.
00:14:33,00:14:35,I would think a double yoka would be brainier than the average.
00:14:35,00:14:37,Is it like a yoko?
00:14:37,00:14:40,But then the doubly as yokely as a yoko.
00:14:40,00:14:41,It might be. It doesn't have an anonyme.
00:14:41,00:14:43,Let's have one more. What's a good night kiss?
00:14:43,00:14:47,"Oh, it's one of those shower things that we don't know we should get into."
00:14:47,00:14:48,Knockout punch.
00:14:48,00:14:53,Get your hands off my boob boobs.
00:14:53,00:14:56,Dan's right. It's a knockout punch.
00:14:56,00:15:00,So be very careful if you ask someone in prison to give you a good night kiss.
00:15:00,00:15:01,Do you think you would?
00:15:01,00:15:02,I don't know.
00:15:02,00:15:04,"I think it would make you feel happy, wouldn't it?"
00:15:04,00:15:06,I was reassuring you a bit.
00:15:06,00:15:08,"- To the guards. - Yeah, to the guards."
00:15:08,00:15:10,- On night number one. - Excuse me?
00:15:10,00:15:12,My mummy always.
00:15:12,00:15:24,"OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is James."
00:15:24,00:15:27,"OK, my fact this week is that in 2010, Jaguar made a car"
00:15:27,00:15:31,that sounded like an actual Jaguar.
00:15:31,00:15:34,Give us an idea of what that sounds like.
00:15:34,00:15:35,Roar!
00:15:35,00:15:36,"- Yeah, OK. - It's very good."
00:15:36,00:15:39,I had to do the hand gesture when I do that as well.
00:15:39,00:15:44,I sort of think cars sound a bit like roaring animals.
00:15:44,00:15:47,"It was easier than making it sound like a laughing hyena, for instance."
00:15:47,00:15:50,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah. - You know, there wasn't much to tweak."
00:15:50,00:15:53,But I did listen because you can hear a sample online.
00:15:53,00:15:55,And it does start with the regular car sound.
00:15:55,00:15:58,"And in your head, you're going, ""Oh, that doesn't sound..."""
00:15:58,00:16:00,"And then out of nowhere, a Jaguar sound."
00:16:00,00:16:01,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah. - And yeah."
00:16:01,00:16:03,"So it does, it is distinctly different."
00:16:03,00:16:07,"Yeah, so this was debuted at the 2010 Paris Motor Show."
00:16:07,00:16:11,And it was the Jaguar CX75.
00:16:11,00:16:14,And it was designed by a guy called Ian Callum.
00:16:14,00:16:17,"And then last year, he's started his own business now"
00:16:17,00:16:19,called Callum That Makes Cars.
00:16:19,00:16:21,"And he is making his own version,"
00:16:21,00:16:24,which is the original one was a concept one.
00:16:24,00:16:25,I think it was in the movie Spectre.
00:16:25,00:16:28,- Yeah. - But he's making ones that are street legal.
00:16:28,00:16:30,So they've got the basic safety that you need
00:16:30,00:16:33,and the right emissions and stuff like that.
00:16:33,00:16:37,"So if you want to give him a loaded dash, he'll make you one."
00:16:37,00:16:40,"- So Spectre, they were provided supposedly"
00:16:40,00:16:42,"with about five of these cars, five to seven."
00:16:42,00:16:44,No one actually knows how many of these have been produced
00:16:44,00:16:45,as of yet because it's not on the road.
00:16:45,00:16:48,"- Another one of those secrets. - It's another secret, yeah."
00:16:48,00:16:50,"And if anyone watches it, it's a chase scene,"
00:16:50,00:16:51,"Bond is in the nest in Marden,"
00:16:51,00:16:55,and he's being chased by someone who is in this Jaguar.
00:16:55,00:16:58,- Don't watch Spectre just for that chase though.
00:16:58,00:16:59,- Are there other reasons to watch it?
00:16:59,00:17:01,"- No. - Right, thank you."
00:17:01,00:17:02,"- Well, so if you're going to watch it,"
00:17:02,00:17:03,"it should be just for that chase, it sounds like."
00:17:03,00:17:05,"- Oh yeah, that's a good point."
00:17:05,00:17:07,- Can I just say one more thing about Ian Callum?
00:17:07,00:17:08,"- Oh yeah. - By the way,"
00:17:08,00:17:10,"when he was 14 years old,"
00:17:10,00:17:12,he submitted a car design to Jaguar
00:17:12,00:17:14,in the hope of getting a job.
00:17:14,00:17:16,"And then later on, he went on to work for them."
00:17:16,00:17:18,- That's very cool. - Yeah.
00:17:18,00:17:20,"- I just want to see that car that he designed,"
00:17:20,00:17:24,"'cause I'm sure, I mean, he's one of the great car designers,"
00:17:24,00:17:26,"but for 14 year old,"
00:17:26,00:17:28,"it's gonna look like Homer Simpson's car, isn't it?"
00:17:28,00:17:29,- Have you seen a cyber truck?
00:17:29,00:17:36,"- So on car sound, something that is added by manufacturers"
00:17:36,00:17:38,"is the noise of car doors closing,"
00:17:38,00:17:40,or it's enhanced by manufacturers.
00:17:40,00:17:42,"- Shulk that, shulk."
00:17:42,00:17:45,"- Yeah, 'cause they think that,"
00:17:45,00:17:47,"so cars used to be heavier,"
00:17:47,00:17:48,"they made of different materials,"
00:17:48,00:17:50,"so they made that really satisfying, deep clunk."
00:17:50,00:17:53,And now car manufacturers don't actually need
00:17:53,00:17:55,"to use such heavy materials, they're a bit more efficient,"
00:17:55,00:17:57,"but they think if people hear a lighter, tinny clunk,"
00:17:57,00:17:59,they'll think it's not as expensive.
00:17:59,00:18:00,So then they alter the design
00:18:00,00:18:05,"to make the car door thudding clunk sound more,"
00:18:05,00:18:06,and they go to huge lengths.
00:18:06,00:18:07,So what was it?
00:18:07,00:18:10,Cadillac was saying that they listened to dozens
00:18:10,00:18:11,and dozens of different cars
00:18:11,00:18:12,"and make notes on their sounds,"
00:18:12,00:18:13,and then investigate all the cars
00:18:13,00:18:17,"to work out what's making that sound the way it sounds,"
00:18:17,00:18:19,and then combine them.
00:18:19,00:18:19,"- I don't know if you've heard that,"
00:18:19,00:18:21,cars are big business.
00:18:21,00:18:24,- I've never seen one.
00:18:24,00:18:27,"- What would you, to your car, sound sonically, if you could?"
00:18:27,00:18:31,- One of those boop boop boop horns.
00:18:31,00:18:32,- A clown horn.
00:18:32,00:18:33,"- A clown horn, a clown horn."
00:18:33,00:18:34,"- Yeah, that's nice."
00:18:34,00:18:35,- I saw one grab in a boob in the '87s.
00:18:35,00:18:41,"- Yeah, I do have a favorite car sound now"
00:18:41,00:18:42,"as a result of looking up this fact,"
00:18:42,00:18:44,which is pink noise.
00:18:44,00:18:46,You heard a pink noise?
00:18:46,00:18:48,This is a really fascinating innovation.
00:18:48,00:18:50,So this noise is something you would only ever hear
00:18:50,00:18:53,"if you're about to get into a crash,"
00:18:53,00:18:54,and they're anticipating--
00:18:54,00:18:55,- Who's it?
00:18:55,00:18:56,- Fuck!
00:18:56,00:18:59,"- Oh, you have heard it."
00:18:59,00:19:01,"Yeah, pink noise, it's really interesting."
00:19:01,00:19:03,So one of the things that happens to a lot of people
00:19:03,00:19:05,"who get into big crashes,"
00:19:05,00:19:06,"the sound is incredibly loud,"
00:19:06,00:19:08,and it damages their hearing.
00:19:08,00:19:09,"So when it detects a potential collision,"
00:19:09,00:19:12,"it puts out this sound, which is at 80 decibels,"
00:19:12,00:19:14,which basically prepares your ear
00:19:14,00:19:17,for this even louder 165 decibels
00:19:17,00:19:19,that it's about to receive.
00:19:19,00:19:22,And so it's a way of getting your ears into a place
00:19:22,00:19:23,where they're not gonna get damaged.
00:19:23,00:19:24,- What?
00:19:24,00:19:25,"- Yeah, it's really interesting."
00:19:25,00:19:26,- 'Cause my car has a thing which beeps
00:19:26,00:19:29,"where it thinks I'm about to hit something,"
00:19:29,00:19:30,"but that's not this, right?"
00:19:30,00:19:31,And it's going on all the time.
00:19:31,00:19:33,I've actually had to rip it out.
00:19:33,00:19:34,(laughing)
00:19:34,00:19:36,"- That's incredible, and that protects your ears"
00:19:36,00:19:39,by warming your ears up to that.
00:19:39,00:19:41,- I don't think your ears could be tricked
00:19:41,00:19:43,out of mechanical deafness.
00:19:43,00:19:45,"- No, it's so, okay, this is what it says."
00:19:45,00:19:47,"It says, ""It triggers muscles in the ear"
00:19:47,00:19:50,"""to contract by reflex, automatically bracing the inner ear"
00:19:50,00:19:54,"""and the ear drum for extremely loud noise by the crash."""
00:19:54,00:19:56,- You've all heard of Hans Zimmer.
00:19:56,00:19:56,"- Yeah, of course."
00:19:56,00:19:57,"- Yeah, invented the Zimmer frame."
00:19:57,00:19:58,- That's right.
00:19:58,00:20:00,(laughing)
00:20:00,00:20:01,"So we're talking Inception,"
00:20:01,00:20:03,"Pirates of the Caribbean, The Lion King,"
00:20:03,00:20:05,"Gladiator, Dunkirk, Dune."
00:20:05,00:20:06,- He did the music for them.
00:20:06,00:20:07,- He did the music.
00:20:07,00:20:08,He did the music for all of these.
00:20:08,00:20:10,Dune too.
00:20:10,00:20:13,- He also designed the sound of the BMW.
00:20:13,00:20:14,"So electric cars, they don't have"
00:20:14,00:20:15,an internal combustion engine.
00:20:15,00:20:18,They do not need to sound like a car.
00:20:18,00:20:22,But you can't just have them sounding like anything
00:20:22,00:20:23,"'cause if you're driving close to someone,"
00:20:23,00:20:25,they need to know there's a car passing by.
00:20:25,00:20:26,- And they need to know it's a car.
00:20:26,00:20:28,You can't do a horse noise or like a crazy bird noise.
00:20:28,00:20:29,- Exactly.
00:20:29,00:20:30,- That's a temptation.
00:20:30,00:20:31,- But Hans Zimmer was given the brief
00:20:31,00:20:33,"to define what was it,"
00:20:33,00:20:37,to compose the sound of e-mobility for BMW.
00:20:37,00:20:38,(laughing)
00:20:38,00:20:39,- And it's exactly the exact same.
00:20:39,00:20:41,- It was really good.
00:20:41,00:20:44,- And I listened to it and it just sounds like a car.
00:20:44,00:20:45,"- Well, that's the idea, then, Andy."
00:20:45,00:20:47,"- No, but it sounds too much like a car."
00:20:47,00:20:49,"As in if I was getting Zimmer on the case,"
00:20:49,00:20:51,I'd want something that revolutionized.
00:20:51,00:20:52,"- Yeah, but when you watched Dune,"
00:20:52,00:20:54,"did you think, oh, that just sounds like a giant worm?"
00:20:54,00:20:56,(laughing)
00:20:56,00:20:58,Like he's just brilliant at making things
00:20:58,00:20:59,sound like they're supposed to sound.
00:20:59,00:21:00,"- Really, the worms sound like a BMW."
00:21:00,00:21:02,(laughing)
00:21:02,00:21:03,- It's very confusing.
00:21:03,00:21:04,"Yeah, no, and they have an in-helps person,"
00:21:04,00:21:06,"don't they, BMW, who is doing this."
00:21:06,00:21:07,So Zimmer was sort of brought in to collaborate
00:21:07,00:21:09,"with a guy called Renzo Vitale,"
00:21:09,00:21:11,who's already there creating these sounds.
00:21:11,00:21:13,"'Cause as we know, and we've spoken about"
00:21:13,00:21:14,"on this podcast before,"
00:21:14,00:21:17,it is a time where the electric car is knocking out sounds
00:21:17,00:21:19,and people are finding that incredibly scary.
00:21:19,00:21:22,"In fact, Jaguar are saying that they're gonna go"
00:21:22,00:21:25,entirely electric by this year.
00:21:25,00:21:26,"And who knows if that's gonna happen,"
00:21:26,00:21:28,but that certainly was said a while ago.
00:21:28,00:21:30,And so things like the British Library
00:21:30,00:21:32,are starting to archive car sounds.
00:21:32,00:21:34,"So the Jaguar car sound,"
00:21:34,00:21:36,which is a notably famous car sound
00:21:36,00:21:37,"amongst car connoisseurs,"
00:21:37,00:21:39,is now part of the audio library in there
00:21:39,00:21:42,because my children might never know that sound.
00:21:42,00:21:43,"- God, I can imagine the bore."
00:21:43,00:21:45,If you see someone listening to that audio
00:21:45,00:21:47,in the British Library of all the things
00:21:47,00:21:48,"you could be looking at,"
00:21:48,00:21:49,"you're not talking to them, are you?"
00:21:49,00:21:51,- Imagine you see an attractive person
00:21:51,00:21:52,on the other side of the train
00:21:52,00:21:53,and they've got their headphones in
00:21:53,00:21:55,"and you think they'll sidle over,"
00:21:55,00:21:56,"""Hey, what are you listening to?"""
00:21:56,00:21:57,(laughing)
00:21:57,00:21:58,- And the Zimmer.
00:21:58,00:21:59,"- Oh, I love that."
00:21:59,00:22:02,(laughing)
00:22:02,00:22:03,- One thing where this is important
00:22:03,00:22:07,"is in formula E, which is like formula one,"
00:22:07,00:22:09,but for electric cars.
00:22:09,00:22:11,I read an article in the Washington Post
00:22:11,00:22:12,that was talking about this
00:22:12,00:22:14,and they said that the cars were going round
00:22:14,00:22:16,and they sounded like electric toothbrushes.
00:22:16,00:22:17,(laughing)
00:22:17,00:22:18,Going round.
00:22:18,00:22:20,"Which when you think about the formula one,"
00:22:20,00:22:22,"it's like, ""Round, round."""
00:22:22,00:22:23,But then I read another article
00:22:23,00:22:25,"that said that the old F1 engines,"
00:22:25,00:22:28,they had a volume that would peak
00:22:28,00:22:30,"between 500 and 2500 hertz,"
00:22:30,00:22:34,which is about the same frequency as a human scream.
00:22:34,00:22:35,And that's the reason people like it so much
00:22:35,00:22:37,'cause it really puts you on edge.
00:22:37,00:22:38,- Right.
00:22:38,00:22:39,- You're watching the cars
00:22:39,00:22:40,but you're kind of on edge the whole time.
00:22:40,00:22:42,You're really excited about it
00:22:42,00:22:44,"because your brain is thinking,"
00:22:44,00:22:45,"""Is someone screaming there or something?"""
00:22:45,00:22:46,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:22:46,00:22:48,"The drivers, it's always their first time."
00:22:48,00:22:49,"And they're very, very scared."
00:22:49,00:22:51,(screaming)
00:22:51,00:22:53,Even they got pink noise in there.
00:22:53,00:22:55,But even petrol car noise is a fake.
00:22:55,00:22:55,That's what I find so weird.
00:22:55,00:22:58,"Even these days, like the car door thing,"
00:22:58,00:22:59,it's this thing skeuomorphism.
00:22:59,00:23:01,"We've talked, maybe we mentioned this before,"
00:23:01,00:23:03,it's where you have a new technology
00:23:03,00:23:05,but you keep an element from the old technology
00:23:05,00:23:06,for aesthetic reasons.
00:23:06,00:23:08,Like an app which has a picture of a bookshelf
00:23:08,00:23:10,to trick you into thinking you're reading an ancient tome.
00:23:10,00:23:12,"You know, it's just that skeuomorphism."
00:23:12,00:23:14,"And all these modern cars, even petrol ones,"
00:23:14,00:23:16,"still, they play fake engine noises."
00:23:16,00:23:18,Some of them literally have speakers in the cabin.
00:23:18,00:23:19,"- They do, wasn't it?"
00:23:19,00:23:21,I think a car journalist found this out.
00:23:21,00:23:22,"It was in the Ford Mustang,"
00:23:22,00:23:25,which has apparently an incredibly famous sound.
00:23:25,00:23:26,"He broke his speakers or something,"
00:23:26,00:23:28,or pulled a fuse that took his speaker out
00:23:28,00:23:30,"and he was like, ""Oh my God, the engine's gone off."""
00:23:30,00:23:31,And it turns out that's just...
00:23:31,00:23:32,- It's great.
00:23:32,00:23:34,I think so many sounds must be manufactured
00:23:34,00:23:36,in a way that we don't realize.
00:23:36,00:23:37,It's like secret sounds everywhere.
00:23:37,00:23:40,Someone was telling me that they have an old mouse
00:23:40,00:23:43,"which when you click, you hear a noise."
00:23:43,00:23:45,And apparently it's a little speaker in there
00:23:45,00:23:46,that is playing that.
00:23:46,00:23:47,(laughing)
00:23:47,00:23:50,"Yeah, it's a little tiny speaker that when you click it,"
00:23:50,00:23:51,it's playing a sound.
00:23:51,00:23:53,It's not the click itself that's happening
00:23:53,00:23:55,because people found it quite disorientating
00:23:55,00:23:58,to have a mouse that wasn't clicking anymore.
00:23:58,00:23:59,And so they created a little...
00:23:59,00:24:01,- It sounds so real. - What is real?
00:24:01,00:24:04,- I have a little speaker that I keep in my trousers
00:24:04,00:24:06,'cause I can only do silent but deadly farts
00:24:06,00:24:08,and it really puts people off.
00:24:08,00:24:10,"So whenever I know one's coming,"
00:24:10,00:24:12,I press the button and it makes them nice.
00:24:12,00:24:13,"- Wow, yeah."
00:24:13,00:24:14,"Oh, that's good."
00:24:14,00:24:15,Is it Bose?
00:24:15,00:24:18,"'Cause yours are very basic, basic, yeah."
00:24:18,00:24:21,(upbeat music)
00:24:23,00:24:26,"- Okay, it is time for fact number three"
00:24:26,00:24:27,and that is my fact.
00:24:27,00:24:30,My fact this week is that Queen Elizabeth I
00:24:30,00:24:33,never visited Shakespeare's Globe.
00:24:33,00:24:36,"However, she did visit a venue down the road"
00:24:36,00:24:38,to watch bears fighting a dog and monkey.
00:24:38,00:24:41,"- Oh, it does depend on the Shakespeare play, I would say."
00:24:41,00:24:43,"- Right, yeah. - Some Shakespeare plays,"
00:24:43,00:24:44,way better than a dog fighting a monkey.
00:24:44,00:24:45,(laughing)
00:24:45,00:24:48,"Others, yeah."
00:24:48,00:24:49,"I read this, by the way,"
00:24:49,00:24:51,"in a book called ""London A Travel Guide Through Time"""
00:24:51,00:24:53,by Dr. Matthew Green.
00:24:53,00:24:56,I love this book and my wife actually
00:24:56,00:24:57,was the editor on the book.
00:24:57,00:24:58,And it's actually--
00:24:58,00:25:00,"- Ah, that is this cool."
00:25:00,00:25:01,- Is this Spond?
00:25:01,00:25:04,"It's like eight, 10 years old now, this book."
00:25:04,00:25:05,- She's still looking back. - She's doing Worldies.
00:25:05,00:25:08,(laughing)
00:25:08,00:25:09,"- Anyway, if you could all buy it"
00:25:09,00:25:12,with three children to feed.
00:25:12,00:25:15,"No, it's a fantastic book where Matthew Green takes"
00:25:15,00:25:17,the reader as if they were a time traveler
00:25:17,00:25:18,through different periods of London.
00:25:18,00:25:21,The first one you start in is walking along the South Bank
00:25:21,00:25:24,and you're heading towards Shakespeare's Globe.
00:25:24,00:25:26,"But he makes the point that, surprisingly,"
00:25:26,00:25:29,"Queen Elizabeth I never went to the Globe,"
00:25:29,00:25:33,but she did go to a venue that was very near to it
00:25:33,00:25:34,to watch this extraordinary thing
00:25:34,00:25:37,where bears would be brought into an arena
00:25:37,00:25:40,and they would have dogs that would let loose on them
00:25:40,00:25:42,and they would just fight until either it looked like
00:25:42,00:25:45,the dogs have had way too much and were gonna die
00:25:45,00:25:46,or that the bear looked a bit injured
00:25:46,00:25:49,because these bears were kind of like professional wrestlers.
00:25:49,00:25:51,They were famous in their day.
00:25:51,00:25:52,People knew their names.
00:25:52,00:25:54,One's even named in a Shakespeare play itself.
00:25:54,00:25:56,So this is a big deal.
00:25:56,00:25:57,"So yeah, it's a-"
00:25:57,00:25:59,"- Which is the famous one, can you remember?"
00:25:59,00:26:00,"- Yeah, it's-"
00:26:00,00:26:01,"- He was called ""Team on a Bathance."""
00:26:01,00:26:04,"- I think he was called ""Sackerson,"" I believe."
00:26:04,00:26:05,- Oh.
00:26:05,00:26:06,- He was a real celebrity bear.
00:26:06,00:26:07,"- Yeah, there was Ned Whitting."
00:26:07,00:26:09,There was Harry Hunks.
00:26:09,00:26:10,There was Blind Bess.
00:26:10,00:26:13,"And then ""Sackerson,"" yeah, in ""The Merry Wives of Windsor."""
00:26:13,00:26:14,- Okay.
00:26:14,00:26:15,"- And yeah, it's literally the worst play."
00:26:15,00:26:17,"The worst of Shakespeare's plays, arguably,"
00:26:17,00:26:18,maybe the worst of all plays ever written.
00:26:18,00:26:19,It's really bad.
00:26:19,00:26:21,"So did they throw ""Sackerson"" in"
00:26:21,00:26:23,just to sort of boost up its interest?
00:26:23,00:26:24,- I have some ratings.
00:26:24,00:26:27,- There's a theory that Shakespeare wrote it in nine days.
00:26:27,00:26:29,"It was a very, very rushed job play."
00:26:29,00:26:30,- Right.
00:26:30,00:26:31,- They had to quickly come up with something.
00:26:31,00:26:33,"And he just sort of said, ""I'm gonna pull this out."""
00:26:33,00:26:34,"- ""I'll chuck a bear in there."
00:26:34,00:26:35,"People will rock up."""
00:26:35,00:26:36,And it was a fair fight.
00:26:36,00:26:39,"I think he said that it was bears fighting a dog and a monkey,"
00:26:39,00:26:41,but I think they would usually give him a few dogs.
00:26:41,00:26:43,"- Yeah, yeah, a bunch of dogs, sometimes the monkey."
00:26:43,00:26:44,The monkey was usually on horseback.
00:26:44,00:26:45,Like it was-
00:26:45,00:26:46,"- So it has an advantage there, doesn't it?"
00:26:46,00:26:47,- Yeah.
00:26:47,00:26:48,"- Wait, who's fighting who?"
00:26:48,00:26:49,- The monkey's on a horse.
00:26:49,00:26:50,Who's the monkey on a horse fighting?
00:26:50,00:26:51,"- No, I think in that case,"
00:26:51,00:26:53,I think the monkey is just riding around on a horse
00:26:53,00:26:54,as a bit of entertainment.
00:26:54,00:26:56,"- Oh, wait, so the bears didn't fight the monkey?"
00:26:56,00:26:57,- I think monkeys did fight bears.
00:26:57,00:26:59,- But I don't think you could incentivize a bear
00:26:59,00:27:00,"to repeatedly attack a horse, can you?"
00:27:00,00:27:02,- Who's the horse fighting?
00:27:02,00:27:03,The horse is just having a good time.
00:27:03,00:27:04,- Yeah.
00:27:04,00:27:05,- It's just a day out.
00:27:05,00:27:05,- Horse is confused.
00:27:05,00:27:06,It's just hanging out.
00:27:06,00:27:08,"Well, it was confusing, wasn't it?"
00:27:08,00:27:10,Because this is gruesome entertainment.
00:27:10,00:27:12,"Yet when you read people writing about it,"
00:27:12,00:27:13,it was like a great day out.
00:27:13,00:27:15,- I read a lot of articles about it for this.
00:27:15,00:27:17,One thing I really liked about it
00:27:17,00:27:19,is they sometimes did it in pubs.
00:27:19,00:27:22,"And they do seem to have had bear gardens,"
00:27:22,00:27:24,which is where they did the fighting.
00:27:24,00:27:25,Which is just like--
00:27:25,00:27:27,- Is that where we get bear garden?
00:27:27,00:27:28,"- Well, I think."
00:27:28,00:27:30,"But yeah, lots of play."
00:27:30,00:27:31,There's a trolling.
00:27:31,00:27:33,I think the way we live now has the bear garden
00:27:33,00:27:35,as the gentleman's club they go to.
00:27:35,00:27:37,The name stayed on and bear garden was anywhere
00:27:37,00:27:38,the bears for.
00:27:38,00:27:40,- And there is a road called bear garden now.
00:27:40,00:27:41,- Yes.
00:27:41,00:27:44,"- And Bear Lane, yeah, near the spots where this happened."
00:27:44,00:27:45,"- It's one of those sports which makes you think,"
00:27:45,00:27:47,"oh, people in the past would just,"
00:27:47,00:27:48,I owe nothing to them.
00:27:48,00:27:50,I don't care about their civilization.
00:27:50,00:27:54,I don't think their values are at all interesting to me.
00:27:54,00:27:57,"- Well, let's not get into the cultural relativism."
00:27:57,00:27:59,"Is it Bellatoturf, Foxes and Shreds?"
00:27:59,00:27:59,Who knows?
00:27:59,00:28:00,Who are we to judge?
00:28:00,00:28:01,"- Yeah, like you do every day."
00:28:01,00:28:02,- I tell you that--
00:28:02,00:28:04,"- Andy, I've seen you on the hunt."
00:28:04,00:28:10,"- Yeah, but it's so, it's really grim."
00:28:10,00:28:12,But the Puritans didn't like it.
00:28:12,00:28:14,"- They're boars though, weren't they?"
00:28:14,00:28:15,- The Puritans carried out plenty of it.
00:28:15,00:28:17,They tried some things in other spaces and times.
00:28:17,00:28:19,"- Sorry, who were the boars fighting?"
00:28:19,00:28:21,(laughing)
00:28:21,00:28:22,- The Puritans banned it.
00:28:22,00:28:23,I think part of their objection was
00:28:23,00:28:24,that it happened on Sundays.
00:28:24,00:28:27,Not that it's a bit grim.
00:28:27,00:28:29,- One of these arenas collapsed on the South Bank.
00:28:29,00:28:31,And the Puritans all said that this was
00:28:31,00:28:34,because God was displeasured about what was going on.
00:28:34,00:28:35,- They would say that.
00:28:35,00:28:36,"- But actually, they weren't that bothered"
00:28:36,00:28:37,about bears getting hurt.
00:28:37,00:28:39,They just thought everyone was having too much fun.
00:28:39,00:28:42,"- Yeah, that's the thing, it was encouraging odd ideas."
00:28:42,00:28:44,"Some of them cared about the animals,"
00:28:44,00:28:45,but majority of the Puritans didn't.
00:28:45,00:28:47,And one of the places that collapsed
00:28:47,00:28:50,is where Queen Elizabeth went to the venue itself
00:28:50,00:28:53,when it was rebuilt and had a French ambassador
00:28:53,00:28:53,come and see a show.
00:28:53,00:28:55,So it was a private showing.
00:28:55,00:28:57,I asked Dr. Matthew Green about the globe thing.
00:28:57,00:28:59,"And he said, ""To be fair,"
00:28:59,00:29:01,"""Queen Elizabeth didn't need to go to the globe."
00:29:01,00:29:03,"""Shakespeare came to her."""
00:29:03,00:29:06,So it's not as if she was against Shakespeare in plays.
00:29:06,00:29:08,But she did go to one of the bear garden places.
00:29:08,00:29:10,- 'Cause the bears wouldn't go to her.
00:29:10,00:29:11,- The bears wouldn't go to her.
00:29:11,00:29:12,They were drunk in the pub.
00:29:12,00:29:13,- All Republicans.
00:29:13,00:29:14,"- And the other thing is,"
00:29:14,00:29:17,"is that this whole point of trying to ban it on the Sundays,"
00:29:17,00:29:20,Queen Elizabeth herself actually overturned
00:29:20,00:29:23,"a parliamentary motion to have it banned on Sundays,"
00:29:23,00:29:25,"'cause she was like, ""No, this is great entertainment."""
00:29:25,00:29:28,"- The bears, we should say, as you sort of did,"
00:29:28,00:29:30,they weren't killed that often.
00:29:30,00:29:32,It was just a lot of the dogs they got through.
00:29:32,00:29:32,The bears actually had quite a few times.
00:29:32,00:29:34,- Did you see what they were wearing?
00:29:34,00:29:35,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:29:35,00:29:37,"- But the masts, my God, they went through a lot."
00:29:37,00:29:40,"And there was actually the, yeah, the dogs."
00:29:40,00:29:42,There was a master of the king's bears
00:29:42,00:29:45,"who was deployed from about the 1400s, I think,"
00:29:45,00:29:46,who was the person who was responsible
00:29:46,00:29:48,"for looking after the royal bears,"
00:29:48,00:29:50,basically looking after bear fights.
00:29:50,00:29:52,And they were constantly having to restock mastiff.
00:29:52,00:29:53,"So I think in Queen Elizabeth's time,"
00:29:53,00:29:56,"in King James's time, it was a guy called Alayne,"
00:29:56,00:29:59,"who was an actor, so he acted in plays and stuff."
00:29:59,00:30:01,But also he had to be always going around the country.
00:30:01,00:30:03,"And he had the right to take people's dogs, I think,"
00:30:03,00:30:07,if he needed spare ones or can't seem to negotiate.
00:30:07,00:30:09,And if anyone was doing a bear fight or a bear dog fight
00:30:09,00:30:12,"around the country, then he got a cut."
00:30:12,00:30:13,- Which is pretty sweet.
00:30:13,00:30:14,- It is wild.
00:30:14,00:30:16,And apparently bears were literally walked
00:30:16,00:30:17,"past you in the streets, you know,"
00:30:17,00:30:19,they weren't like in cages.
00:30:19,00:30:21,"They're just on like a leech, like a dog,"
00:30:21,00:30:23,"just sort of from the pub heading over to,"
00:30:23,00:30:25,"say, oh, watch out for the bear."
00:30:25,00:30:26,It's just wild time.
00:30:26,00:30:27,"- Step aside, darling."
00:30:27,00:30:28,- Yeah.
00:30:28,00:30:30,- I'm with Andy that this is a bad thing.
00:30:30,00:30:31,"- Yeah, actually."
00:30:31,00:30:33,"- Guys, James and I are, James and I are."
00:30:33,00:30:35,- We're not putting you two against us two on this one.
00:30:35,00:30:37,"- Oh, look, I'm just saying, like,"
00:30:37,00:30:40,"if anyone at home agrees with me and Andy, then, you know."
00:30:40,00:30:41,"- Thanks, James."
00:30:41,00:30:42,"- Really, thank you for the support there."
00:30:42,00:30:43,And I'm so glad that we're on this.
00:30:43,00:30:44,"- Oh, it's very brave of you."
00:30:44,00:30:45,Well done.
00:30:45,00:30:46,(laughing)
00:30:46,00:30:48,"Look, there was other stuff that was like peripheral"
00:30:48,00:30:51,"to the bear baiting, which was actually quite fun."
00:30:51,00:30:53,"So I was reading an account by, I think,"
00:30:53,00:30:55,"a foreigner who came to watch one of these,"
00:30:55,00:30:57,obviously barbaric displays.
00:30:57,00:30:58,But also there were-
00:30:58,00:31:01,"- Amazon boardnet, just feeling a bit cold now, Dan."
00:31:01,00:31:03,(laughing)
00:31:03,00:31:04,- Thought I slipped that in.
00:31:04,00:31:06,So there were dogs chasing horses around
00:31:06,00:31:07,as one of the rounds.
00:31:07,00:31:09,So this is in between the bear baiting.
00:31:09,00:31:10,"You know, you use the arena for other things."
00:31:10,00:31:12,Dogs chasing horses.
00:31:12,00:31:14,Men and women were brought out in boxes
00:31:14,00:31:17,"to fight, dance and converse with each other for entertainment."
00:31:17,00:31:18,(laughing)
00:31:18,00:31:20,There was another quite fun thing
00:31:20,00:31:23,where a man threw some white bread among the crowd.
00:31:23,00:31:25,The crowd all scrambled for it.
00:31:25,00:31:27,"And then over the middle of the arena,"
00:31:27,00:31:31,a giant rose was fixed and then set on fire by a rocket.
00:31:31,00:31:33,Lots of apples and pears fell down from this rocket
00:31:33,00:31:35,while all the people were scrambling for the bread
00:31:35,00:31:37,and scared the shit out of them.
00:31:37,00:31:39,"- That sounds like Hella Gabalus, doesn't it?"
00:31:39,00:31:40,"- Yes, it does."
00:31:40,00:31:42,"- A man and emperor who used to do weird things like that,"
00:31:42,00:31:44,like drown people in rose petals and stuff.
00:31:44,00:31:44,- Yes.
00:31:44,00:31:46,I think none of these people even drowned
00:31:46,00:31:50,in the raining apples and pears and bread.
00:31:50,00:31:51,They just got a nice bit of white bread.
00:31:51,00:31:53,It's just quite weird to imagine that crowd goes that mad
00:31:53,00:31:54,for some crumbs of white bread.
00:31:54,00:31:55,"- I might have said this before,"
00:31:55,00:31:57,but I was in a cricket crowd once
00:31:57,00:32:01,where people were throwing out bits of soiree and malt loaf
00:32:01,00:32:03,and everyone were absolutely mental for that.
00:32:03,00:32:07,"- Oh, I don't blame you, I would too."
00:32:07,00:32:08,That's nice.
00:32:08,00:32:10,- Elizabethan sort of hobbies in general?
00:32:10,00:32:11,- Yeah.
00:32:11,00:32:12,- Sort of that kind of thing.
00:32:12,00:32:14,I got a bit distracted by things
00:32:14,00:32:16,that Queen Elizabeth liked doing.
00:32:16,00:32:17,- All right.
00:32:17,00:32:21,"- She liked going to parties,"
00:32:21,00:32:24,specifically large parties held for her around the country.
00:32:24,00:32:27,- Didn't you just have to go to those?
00:32:27,00:32:28,Do we know that you like--
00:32:28,00:32:29,"- Far from, no, no."
00:32:29,00:32:31,So you know the thing of royal progress is?
00:32:31,00:32:32,- No.
00:32:32,00:32:34,- It's where the monarch would go around the whole country
00:32:34,00:32:35,and it dates back to a time
00:32:35,00:32:38,when there wasn't a proper court and a proper castle.
00:32:38,00:32:39,"You might have a bit of a fortress,"
00:32:39,00:32:41,but basically to subdue your territory
00:32:41,00:32:43,"and show you're still the boss man,"
00:32:43,00:32:45,you have to go around quite a lot
00:32:45,00:32:46,and the court is always on the move.
00:32:46,00:32:48,And that still survived even when Queen Elizabeth
00:32:48,00:32:49,was on the throne.
00:32:49,00:32:52,You would progress to various different
00:32:52,00:32:54,stately homes around the country
00:32:54,00:32:55,and they would go into a huge tiz
00:32:55,00:32:57,'cause the queen or king was coming and you'd have to--
00:32:57,00:32:58,- Is that the same thing
00:32:58,00:33:01,there's like certain stately homes still have laws
00:33:01,00:33:02,"that if the monarch goes there,"
00:33:02,00:33:04,then they have to give them a bed.
00:33:04,00:33:06,"- I think it's that, it's exactly that."
00:33:06,00:33:08,New toilet seats and all of that.
00:33:08,00:33:11,And there was one party which was hosted
00:33:11,00:33:13,"by the Earl of Leicester, who was Robert Dudley."
00:33:13,00:33:15,"- Yep, her fave, that's not all."
00:33:15,00:33:17,"- Her fave, he was constantly proposing to her."
00:33:17,00:33:19,That was her other hobby was turning down the proposals
00:33:19,00:33:23,"of Dudley and he threw this huge party,"
00:33:23,00:33:27,"the Kenilworth Spectacle in 1575, 19 days of partying."
00:33:27,00:33:30,He built her her own micro palace on his grounds.
00:33:30,00:33:31,"And then she complained,"
00:33:31,00:33:33,I can't see the garden you've commissioned from my bedroom.
00:33:33,00:33:35,So he had his gardeners build her a new version
00:33:35,00:33:38,of the garden overnight under her window.
00:33:38,00:33:40,"Crazy, there was a water pageant"
00:33:40,00:33:41,with an 18 foot long mermaid.
00:33:41,00:33:43,"There was a moving island, there were fireworks,"
00:33:43,00:33:45,"there was hunting, there were plays."
00:33:45,00:33:47,"He was the least popular man in England, we should say."
00:33:47,00:33:50,He was incredibly popular 'cause his wife he married
00:33:50,00:33:52,when he was a teenager had mysteriously died
00:33:52,00:33:54,two years after Elizabeth became the queen.
00:33:54,00:33:56,And there was a lot of talk that maybe he was responsible.
00:33:56,00:33:59,"- I guess back then as well, you don't know so many people."
00:33:59,00:34:01,"Like there's like six celebrities back then, right?"
00:34:01,00:34:03,So he would have been one
00:34:03,00:34:04,and one's got to be the most hated.
00:34:04,00:34:07,- It's not like you could have like some people hate
00:34:07,00:34:10,Piers Morgan and some people hate Elon Musk.
00:34:10,00:34:12,"Like you basically, everyone's going for the same one."
00:34:12,00:34:14,"- I got six people to pick from, that's it."
00:34:14,00:34:16,"- Yeah, well, he was so unpopular."
00:34:16,00:34:17,- Probably because everyone knew
00:34:17,00:34:19,"that he fancied Elizabeth, right?"
00:34:19,00:34:20,Everyone always hates the person
00:34:20,00:34:22,who's trying to have the affair with the monarch.
00:34:22,00:34:23,- And might have killed his first wife.
00:34:23,00:34:26,- I don't like the first wife thing.
00:34:26,00:34:28,- She definitely died two years after she became queen.
00:34:28,00:34:30,So an old lady from Brentwood told her neighbors
00:34:30,00:34:33,that my Lord Robert hath given her majesty a red petticoat
00:34:33,00:34:36,implying that they've slept together.
00:34:36,00:34:37,- New Zealand jail slang.
00:34:37,00:34:39,"- It's boob slang, yeah."
00:34:39,00:34:42,She was jailed for even telling her neighbors that.
00:34:42,00:34:42,- Really?
00:34:42,00:34:43,- So they were crushing down on it.
00:34:43,00:34:45,"But yeah, so that was."
00:34:45,00:34:46,- That's interesting.
00:34:46,00:34:48,- Was the kennel a thing that he displayed put on?
00:34:48,00:34:49,That was where they accidentally burned a town
00:34:49,00:34:51,"to the ground, right?"
00:34:51,00:34:52,(laughing)
00:34:52,00:34:54,- That normally have not helped his popularity yet.
00:34:54,00:34:56,(laughing)
00:34:56,00:34:57,- I don't know that.
00:34:57,00:35:00,"- It was 1572, it was one of the things"
00:35:00,00:35:01,that he put on for Elizabeth.
00:35:01,00:35:04,And he staged this huge mock battle for her.
00:35:04,00:35:06,And they had these amazing fireworks.
00:35:06,00:35:08,And then they had cannons that they just fired
00:35:08,00:35:09,randomly into the air.
00:35:09,00:35:11,And they all landed on the adjacent town
00:35:11,00:35:12,and burned down a bunch of houses
00:35:12,00:35:13,and killed at least one person.
00:35:13,00:35:16,- That's the most upper class English sentence ever.
00:35:16,00:35:18,Is that the town I accidentally burned down?
00:35:18,00:35:21,(laughing)
00:35:21,00:35:22,"- Please, yeah."
00:35:22,00:35:24,"- Just very quickly, Henry VIII,"
00:35:24,00:35:26,"father of Elizabeth the First,"
00:35:26,00:35:27,also loved bear baiting.
00:35:27,00:35:29,And he used to go around the country as well.
00:35:29,00:35:32,And one thing that he always brought with him
00:35:32,00:35:36,was a locksmith who always put a new lock
00:35:36,00:35:37,on the door that he was sleeping in
00:35:37,00:35:38,of the room that he was in.
00:35:38,00:35:39,- Really?
00:35:39,00:35:40,"- Yeah, 'cause he was so worried about assassination."
00:35:40,00:35:42,And then when they left the next day
00:35:42,00:35:43,"or however many days later,"
00:35:43,00:35:45,he would take the lock off the door again.
00:35:45,00:35:47,So you just have this messed up door
00:35:47,00:35:49,as a result of the stay.
00:35:49,00:35:50,And he would bring it to the next house
00:35:50,00:35:52,and he would lock it onto the new door.
00:35:52,00:35:53,"- Oh, so it's one lock."
00:35:53,00:35:54,He's not having to put--
00:35:54,00:35:55,"- I'm sure he had multiple,"
00:35:55,00:35:57,but he would always put it on and take it off.
00:35:57,00:35:58,So you left with the lock.
00:35:58,00:35:59,- That's quite good.
00:35:59,00:36:01,"That's a good plot device, I'm sorry."
00:36:01,00:36:03,"Like the lock man is the assassin, you know?"
00:36:03,00:36:06,- He's gonna be the first person everyone suspects
00:36:06,00:36:08,when suddenly the lock has been opened.
00:36:08,00:36:10,(all laughing)
00:36:10,00:36:12,- Who could have done this?
00:36:12,00:36:14,"- It feels like someone's got something to hide, doesn't it?"
00:36:14,00:36:16,"If they rock up at your sleepover and they say,"
00:36:16,00:36:19,"""I've brought my own lock, don't mind me."""
00:36:19,00:36:20,What are you doing in there?
00:36:20,00:36:21,What are you doing in there?
00:36:21,00:36:23,It's so paranoid about.
00:36:23,00:36:24,- Is the lock going on the sleeping bag here?
00:36:24,00:36:25,"- Wait, why would it, what?"
00:36:25,00:36:27,"- Sorry, you just said someone turns up at your sleepover"
00:36:27,00:36:28,and they brought their own lock.
00:36:28,00:36:29,"- 'Cause I'm a sleepover,"
00:36:29,00:36:31,everyone gets their own rooms.
00:36:31,00:36:33,(all laughing)
00:36:33,00:36:35,- We're all gonna go to bed in our separate rooms now.
00:36:35,00:36:37,"- Oh, we're all going to a different wing."
00:36:37,00:36:38,"- Yeah, for the scary stories."
00:36:38,00:36:40,"Yes, perfect, yeah."
00:36:40,00:36:43,(upbeat music)
00:36:43,00:36:47,"- Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show"
00:36:47,00:36:49,and that is Andy.
00:36:49,00:36:51,"- My fact is that in Edwardian times,"
00:36:51,00:36:54,you could order a barrel of seawater
00:36:54,00:36:56,to be delivered to your inland home
00:36:56,00:36:58,so you could keep on enjoying the health benefits
00:36:58,00:37:00,of your holiday after it ended.
00:37:00,00:37:02,"- Now, do you have to get some sailors"
00:37:02,00:37:03,to come from their boats?
00:37:03,00:37:07,"- Oh no, a cracker for my nice fresh barrel of seawater"
00:37:07,00:37:08,to have my bath.
00:37:08,00:37:10,"Oh, it's full of jacktars."
00:37:10,00:37:12,"- Yes, was it to have your bath or was it to drink?"
00:37:12,00:37:14,Or was it to massage yourself with?
00:37:14,00:37:15,"- A bit of everything, a bit of everything."
00:37:15,00:37:17,There's nothing that seawater couldn't do.
00:37:17,00:37:18,- Right.
00:37:18,00:37:21,"- And this is from a great, it's from a sub-stack"
00:37:21,00:37:23,"I subscribe to called ""Reading On Trains"""
00:37:23,00:37:25,"by Andrew Martin, which is all about trains."
00:37:25,00:37:29,And it's mostly about trains that I got interested in this.
00:37:29,00:37:30,"- This isn't about trains though, is it?"
00:37:30,00:37:31,"- No, it's about seawater."
00:37:31,00:37:34,But seawater delivered by the Great Eastern Railway.
00:37:34,00:37:35,- Oh my God.
00:37:35,00:37:38,"- So this was in Edwardian times,"
00:37:38,00:37:39,"so in the early 20th century,"
00:37:39,00:37:41,you would get a barrel of seawater
00:37:41,00:37:44,from Lowestoft to Liverpool Street
00:37:44,00:37:48,and they would pump it into these massive wagons at one end
00:37:48,00:37:49,and then they decant it.
00:37:49,00:37:50,"They have a little spigot at the other end,"
00:37:50,00:37:52,they just decant it into a barrel
00:37:52,00:37:55,and then they send the barrels all around everywhere.
00:37:55,00:37:58,And you would order a massive barrel of seawater
00:37:58,00:38:00,and have a bath in the sea in your house.
00:38:00,00:38:02,"- Were there any poor kids who said,"
00:38:02,00:38:04,"""Can we go on a beach holiday this year, Mum?"""
00:38:04,00:38:05,"And they're like, ""I'll do you, almost as good."""
00:38:05,00:38:06,- We have the sea at home.
00:38:06,00:38:07,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:38:07,00:38:08,It was basically that.
00:38:08,00:38:11,And this was all because people were obsessed with seawater
00:38:11,00:38:12,being a really good thing for your health.
00:38:12,00:38:15,"- Yeah, this is a, so I now live in Margate"
00:38:15,00:38:17,and there's still a ginormous hospital there
00:38:17,00:38:19,"which was built as a royal bathing house,"
00:38:19,00:38:23,basically using sea therapy as a way of fixing people.
00:38:23,00:38:24,"- But ironically, at the moment,"
00:38:24,00:38:26,"the trains don't really go from here to Margate,"
00:38:26,00:38:27,"do they, Dad?"
00:38:27,00:38:28,- Yes.
00:38:28,00:38:30,- That's why you're half an hour late this afternoon.
00:38:30,00:38:31,"- It's all right, 'cause once you get there,"
00:38:31,00:38:32,the sea's full of poo anyway.
00:38:32,00:38:33,"So it's fine, I know."
00:38:33,00:38:35,This is the problem with sea these days.
00:38:35,00:38:37,"But it was, this is a big deal"
00:38:37,00:38:40,that kind of actually weirdly transformed
00:38:40,00:38:41,the way that we visit beaches now
00:38:41,00:38:43,because it was like a paupers thing
00:38:43,00:38:45,and it was never part of holidays.
00:38:45,00:38:48,"And then suddenly when this hydrotherapy thing came in,"
00:38:48,00:38:50,suddenly everyone was going back to the beach
00:38:50,00:38:51,and that's kind of created.
00:38:51,00:38:52,"- And that actually started much earlier, didn't it?"
00:38:52,00:38:53,"Like 1750s, I think."
00:38:53,00:38:55,"- Like 1700s, yeah, exactly."
00:38:55,00:38:56,- It's one doctor.
00:38:56,00:38:58,- It was a guy called Richard Russell.
00:38:58,00:39:01,And he's basically responsible for Brighton existing.
00:39:01,00:39:04,"He thought that seawater was great for you,"
00:39:04,00:39:06,much better than like getting the water from Bath
00:39:06,00:39:09,or from an inland spa or Bugston or something.
00:39:09,00:39:11,"And he got a big old house in Brighton,"
00:39:11,00:39:13,"the biggest house at the time,"
00:39:13,00:39:15,because Brighton wasn't really a thing.
00:39:15,00:39:16,And he got a lot of people there
00:39:16,00:39:18,and he cured them supposedly.
00:39:18,00:39:19,- Of anything as well.
00:39:19,00:39:21,It was the usual cures in the olden days.
00:39:21,00:39:24,"You could cure scurvy or jaundice or TB,"
00:39:24,00:39:28,a lot of TB cured by just drinking or bathing in.
00:39:28,00:39:31,I think Richard Russell advised his patients
00:39:31,00:39:33,to drink seawater and he said that a pint of it
00:39:33,00:39:36,"was sufficient to give three or four sharp stools,"
00:39:36,00:39:38,which I think he meant as a good thing.
00:39:38,00:39:40,"- Yeah, you don't want it sharp, do you?"
00:39:40,00:39:41,"- It seems not today,"
00:39:41,00:39:43,but maybe it was sought after in those days.
00:39:43,00:39:48,"- You diluted it with milk or honey, either way."
00:39:48,00:39:50,"I mean, I did read that he variously included"
00:39:50,00:39:52,"a few extra things, like he sprinkled in some,"
00:39:52,00:39:54,"I read Crab's Eyes,"
00:39:54,00:39:56,"which I can't believe is a cost effective thing,"
00:39:56,00:39:57,'cause seawater is quite cheap to get.
00:39:57,00:40:00,Crab's Eyes feels like quite labor intensive.
00:40:00,00:40:02,"- Yeah, it feels like they've got a little bit of grit"
00:40:02,00:40:03,in the bottom of the seawater.
00:40:03,00:40:05,So I know that's Crab's Eyes.
00:40:05,00:40:07,- Is it because basically medicine wasn't very good
00:40:07,00:40:11,at the time and seawater is at least relatively benign?
00:40:11,00:40:12,Is that it?
00:40:12,00:40:13,"- No, who knows. - Is it fresh air?"
00:40:13,00:40:15,"- They just didn't know about evidence-based medicine,"
00:40:15,00:40:16,did they?
00:40:16,00:40:17,"Oh, but I imagine the fresh air."
00:40:17,00:40:19,- I think people just sometimes get better.
00:40:19,00:40:20,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:40:20,00:40:22,"- Like from some things, sometimes people will say,"
00:40:22,00:40:24,"""Oh, you've got tuberculosis"
00:40:24,00:40:27,"""and actually you've got a terrible, awful cough."""
00:40:27,00:40:28,- Right.
00:40:28,00:40:28,- And eventually it gets a bit better
00:40:28,00:40:30,"and you're like, ""Oh, I'm cured of my TB."""
00:40:30,00:40:33,But they didn't do an actual test to see if you had TB.
00:40:33,00:40:34,"- Right, I see that, yeah."
00:40:34,00:40:38,"- This guy anyway, he sold his house to George III"
00:40:38,00:40:40,and then George III invited the Prince of Wales
00:40:40,00:40:43,"to visit him, the big Prince Regent."
00:40:43,00:40:45,It was originally called the Bright Helmston
00:40:45,00:40:47,and they decided to change its name to Brighton
00:40:47,00:40:49,because the royals had started going there.
00:40:49,00:40:51,So it literally was him that started Brighton.
00:40:51,00:40:52,Brighton wasn't a thing before that.
00:40:52,00:40:55,"- Yeah, Bright Helmston is such a cool name."
00:40:55,00:40:56,"- When I look at it,"
00:40:56,00:40:59,I bet the locals pronounced it Brighton anyway.
00:40:59,00:41:00,- Brick Helmston.
00:41:00,00:41:01,"- You know, it's one of those English names."
00:41:01,00:41:03,- I did read that it was from about the 1600s.
00:41:03,00:41:05,Most people had been calling it Brighton.
00:41:05,00:41:09,"But it was still officially Brick Helmston until about 1810,"
00:41:09,00:41:11,"I think, which is back in the period you're talking about."
00:41:11,00:41:12,- This was the same with Margate.
00:41:12,00:41:17,"So in 1791, this big hospital was called Margate Infirmary"
00:41:17,00:41:20,for the relief of the poor whose diseases require sea bathing.
00:41:20,00:41:21,But then it got a royal patronage
00:41:21,00:41:23,and became the royal sea bathing infirmary.
00:41:23,00:41:26,"And if you go down to Margate these days,"
00:41:26,00:41:28,most of the houses have very randomly
00:41:28,00:41:31,just a little porch on the first floor.
00:41:31,00:41:34,And the idea was you would push out your elderly relative
00:41:34,00:41:35,onto the balcony of your house
00:41:35,00:41:37,and you just leave them outside.
00:41:37,00:41:39,And then you'd come and get them after hours and hours
00:41:39,00:41:41,just to see how it affected there.
00:41:41,00:41:43,So you see them all over these random balconies
00:41:43,00:41:45,on those houses there. - That's cool.
00:41:45,00:41:45,- Fresh air is good for you.
00:41:45,00:41:47,"And cold water is good for you, right?"
00:41:47,00:41:49,- A lot of things about going to the beach are very good too.
00:41:49,00:41:51,"You get away from the stresses of daily life,"
00:41:51,00:41:52,the pollution of London.
00:41:52,00:41:54,"- But being dunked, being dunked in cold water"
00:41:54,00:41:55,is definitely good for your health.
00:41:55,00:41:57,It sort of triggers all sorts of adrenaline response.
00:41:57,00:41:58,- It depends.
00:41:58,00:42:00,"If you dunk pneumonia, it's not really that good for you."
00:42:00,00:42:02,"- I don't think there's a huge, I mean, I'm a huge fan,"
00:42:02,00:42:03,"as you know, big cold water bather."
00:42:03,00:42:06,But I don't think there's a huge amount of scientific studies
00:42:06,00:42:08,that have been done that definitively prove that.
00:42:08,00:42:09,"- There are a few things like,"
00:42:09,00:42:12,"because you have this weird sort of reflex, don't you?"
00:42:12,00:42:14,Like a diving reflex.
00:42:14,00:42:17,So I think it's something to do with your vagus nerve.
00:42:17,00:42:18,- Yeah.
00:42:18,00:42:19,And that was the idea at the time
00:42:19,00:42:21,that it shocks you out of something.
00:42:21,00:42:23,"So this is why women were dipped, right?"
00:42:23,00:42:26,And dippers were celebrities.
00:42:26,00:42:27,And they'd be-
00:42:27,00:42:29,"- Again, there were fewer famous people at the time."
00:42:29,00:42:31,This is a Robert Dudley problem.
00:42:31,00:42:32,- It was Robert Dudley and the dippers.
00:42:32,00:42:35,- Dudley and the dippers is a great 1960s party.
00:42:35,00:42:38,"- Yeah, and the dippers were great."
00:42:38,00:42:39,So they were men and women.
00:42:39,00:42:41,"And if you were a male bather who'd gone to Brighton,"
00:42:41,00:42:43,and often you'd be someone who couldn't swim
00:42:43,00:42:44,"'cause most people couldn't,"
00:42:44,00:42:45,then you'd need a dipper.
00:42:45,00:42:47,"And as a man, you'd have a male dipper."
00:42:47,00:42:48,"As a woman, you'd have a female dipper."
00:42:48,00:42:51,"But these were beefy, muscly people."
00:42:51,00:42:54,I think one of the most famous ones was Martha Gunn
00:42:54,00:42:58,"in Brighton, who did it from 1750 to the early 1800s."
00:42:58,00:43:00,And the idea was that you have your client.
00:43:00,00:43:02,"- Wow, she would have been quite old by then."
00:43:02,00:43:05,"- Yeah, she did it from, you know, 20 to 80 or whatever."
00:43:05,00:43:07,- She lived until she was 90.
00:43:07,00:43:08,She just was constantly dunking
00:43:08,00:43:11,and just standing in the water all the time.
00:43:11,00:43:12,Rain or shine?
00:43:12,00:43:13,- Yeah.
00:43:13,00:43:14,- Martha had very wrinkly toes.
00:43:14,00:43:16,- Oh!
00:43:16,00:43:18,- She's 90-year-olds to start off with.
00:43:18,00:43:19,And then she's in the water all day.
00:43:19,00:43:20,- You wouldn't be able to tell
00:43:20,00:43:23,where it was natural wrinkle versus ocean wrinkle.
00:43:23,00:43:25,- Yeah.
00:43:25,00:43:27,"- But you did a lot more than just dunk, of course."
00:43:27,00:43:29,You tailored your treatment to your client.
00:43:29,00:43:31,"So if Dan came to me and was like, ""I want to be dunked,"""
00:43:31,00:43:33,"I'd say, ""Why? What's wrong with you?"""
00:43:33,00:43:35,"I'd work out how long you want to be dunked for,"
00:43:35,00:43:38,"how many times, how deep, which bit of seawater,"
00:43:38,00:43:40,whether you want to massage with it.
00:43:40,00:43:42,- We all know he wants to be dunked in lockdown
00:43:42,00:43:43,until he's found the monster.
00:43:43,00:43:46,(all laughing)
00:43:46,00:43:48,"- Now seawater, though, it's going to do nothing."
00:43:48,00:43:51,There's a cool invention that came off the back of people
00:43:51,00:43:55,"wanting to bring the sea to them, as Andy was mentioning."
00:43:55,00:43:57,"You could use normal water as well for this,"
00:43:57,00:44:00,but there was an item that was invented in the 1890s
00:44:00,00:44:03,called the rocking bathtub.
00:44:03,00:44:05,"And what it was is it's a bathtub,"
00:44:05,00:44:09,which is shaped in a sort of like crescent moon sort of shape.
00:44:09,00:44:11,"So like a, as if like a rocking chair."
00:44:11,00:44:13,"And you would sit inside,"
00:44:13,00:44:16,"you would put three barrels of water inside with you,"
00:44:16,00:44:18,and then you would start rocking back and forth.
00:44:18,00:44:20,- You'd add to the water out of the barrels?
00:44:20,00:44:22,"- No, into your bath."
00:44:22,00:44:23,"- Right, so you pour the water out of the bath."
00:44:23,00:44:25,"- Sorry, yeah, you don't hug the barrels, yeah."
00:44:25,00:44:27,It's not Donkey Kong.
00:44:27,00:44:28,(all laughing)
00:44:28,00:44:30,"So the idea was to create the ocean,"
00:44:30,00:44:33,"to the waves, to make it feel as if you were in the ocean."
00:44:33,00:44:35,"So not only do you have your saltwater with you,"
00:44:35,00:44:37,you have the vibe of an ocean side.
00:44:37,00:44:38,- I quite like doing that.
00:44:38,00:44:39,I think that's good to do in the bath anyway.
00:44:39,00:44:41,It's just my bath is not a rocker.
00:44:41,00:44:42,Oh my God.
00:44:42,00:44:45,- Whose mom has to come in and clear up the bathroom afterwards?
00:44:45,00:44:47,"- Well, it supposedly didn't leak, but it did."
00:44:47,00:44:50,"But supposedly it didn't, but it absolutely didn't."
00:44:50,00:44:51,- I just am these bathrooms.
00:44:51,00:44:53,"After every time he has a bath,"
00:44:53,00:44:55,"water all over the floor, isn't there?"
00:44:55,00:44:56,- It's pretty bad.
00:44:56,00:44:57,"Lot of rubber ducks,"
00:44:57,00:45:00,a lot of accurate bottles of World War II battleships.
00:45:00,00:45:02,It's true about the place.
00:45:02,00:45:03,Do you know it's still so handy?
00:45:03,00:45:06,I know that sometimes you read these things
00:45:06,00:45:09,and you think you want to have that in your own home.
00:45:09,00:45:10,That's often how you are.
00:45:10,00:45:13,You can get seawater delivered to your house still to this day.
00:45:13,00:45:15,"Yeah, I found a place."
00:45:15,00:45:17,"If you want the details, I'll forward them on."
00:45:17,00:45:21,You can get 20 litres sent to your house for 19 pounds.
00:45:21,00:45:26,And it's seawater that's sourced off the Dorset coastline
00:45:26,00:45:28,from a deep water supply.
00:45:28,00:45:31,And so this is largely for aquariums and so on.
00:45:31,00:45:32,- Oh.
00:45:32,00:45:33,(laughing)
00:45:33,00:45:34,- Have water delivered to them.
00:45:34,00:45:35,- I'm still interested.
00:45:35,00:45:35,(laughing)
00:45:35,00:45:36,"- It's such a shame,"
00:45:36,00:45:37,'cause I literally just watched Andy write down
00:45:37,00:45:39,all those details he gave him.
00:45:39,00:45:41,And now I have to get a fish.
00:45:41,00:45:43,"- I've written 20 litres, 90 pounds in sourced Dorset."
00:45:43,00:45:44,- It sounds great.
00:45:44,00:45:45,"- Yeah, but yeah, it happens."
00:45:45,00:45:48,- Deep seawater I think is like a trendy thing
00:45:48,00:45:50,"that's supposed to be good for you, right?"
00:45:50,00:45:53,'Cause the minerals go down to the very deep part
00:45:53,00:45:56,of the water and all the carbon goes down there
00:45:56,00:45:57,and it can't really get anywhere out.
00:45:57,00:45:59,"So the minerals in there are really, really awesome,"
00:45:59,00:46:01,"apparently, and it's supposed to be good for you."
00:46:01,00:46:05,I think like some sports people use it to rehydrate
00:46:05,00:46:06,'cause it's supposed to have more chemicals in it.
00:46:06,00:46:07,- Right.
00:46:07,00:46:09,"- Yeah, is there any healthier than the rest of us?"
00:46:09,00:46:11,(laughing)
00:46:11,00:46:12,"- No, I've heard that."
00:46:12,00:46:13,I think that's plausible.
00:46:13,00:46:14,"And also, but shallow seawater genuinely,"
00:46:14,00:46:16,there is a problem in the UK with lots of--
00:46:16,00:46:17,"- Yeah, it's terrible."
00:46:17,00:46:18,- It's sewage and the--
00:46:18,00:46:20,"- Yeah, but you, I mean, you would fish the turds out"
00:46:20,00:46:21,"when you, before you drink it."
00:46:21,00:46:22,- And there's our slogan.
00:46:22,00:46:24,- We fish the turds out.
00:46:24,00:46:27,(laughing)
00:46:27,00:46:28,- May contain turds.
00:46:28,00:46:30,(laughing)
00:46:30,00:46:32,- Prepared in a facility which contains turds.
00:46:32,00:46:34,(laughing)
00:46:34,00:46:36,"We've made our best efforts, yeah."
00:46:36,00:46:39,- I found some cool waters that exist out there.
00:46:39,00:46:40,Melted water.
00:46:40,00:46:41,Would you drink melted water?
00:46:41,00:46:44,"- Uh, so melted, so it was frozen?"
00:46:44,00:46:48,- I've had like water that comes from icebergs.
00:46:48,00:46:50,"- Yeah, so this is Lithuania, they make,"
00:46:50,00:46:53,but what's interesting is they grow and create the iceberg
00:46:53,00:46:54,and then they melt them.
00:46:54,00:46:56,So it's not natural icebergs.
00:46:56,00:46:59,And then they put that melted ice into a bottle.
00:46:59,00:47:01,"And so yeah, apparently it tastes like puddle water,"
00:47:01,00:47:04,but it won the Lithuanian product of the year 2013.
00:47:04,00:47:05,It won gold for that.
00:47:05,00:47:07,"- They don't have a lot going on in Lithuania, do they?"
00:47:07,00:47:08,"- No, it must have been a thin year."
00:47:08,00:47:09,- That's winning.
00:47:09,00:47:10,(laughing)
00:47:10,00:47:11,"- In thin year in Lithuania, yeah."
00:47:11,00:47:12,- That's very funny.
00:47:12,00:47:15,"- Also, interestingly mentioned just a few minutes ago,"
00:47:15,00:47:17,Loch Nesswater is now bottled.
00:47:17,00:47:20,"It's taken, it's put through filtration systems"
00:47:20,00:47:21,and they sell it.
00:47:21,00:47:25,"For example, the AIG Women's Open Golf Championship in 2024."
00:47:25,00:47:27,It was the official sponsor.
00:47:27,00:47:30,So all of their players were drinking Loch Nesswater.
00:47:30,00:47:33,"- Okay, now I wasn't interested in that"
00:47:33,00:47:34,"until the very end, now I am."
00:47:34,00:47:35,(laughing)
00:47:35,00:47:38,Finally the crossover of interest with you and Dan.
00:47:38,00:47:39,(laughing)
00:47:39,00:47:41,It's a liver.
00:47:41,00:47:43,"- Yeah, the most famous person who would have done"
00:47:43,00:47:46,the sea bathing thing down in Margate is T.S. Eliot.
00:47:46,00:47:47,- Really?
00:47:47,00:47:49,"- Yeah, T.S. Eliot came down and he did it."
00:47:49,00:47:52,And he took time off from his bank job.
00:47:52,00:47:53,He moved down there and his wife came with him.
00:47:53,00:47:56,And that's where he started properly writing
00:47:56,00:47:57,the Wasteland again.
00:47:57,00:47:58,And--
00:47:58,00:47:59,- Is that based on Margate?
00:47:59,00:48:02,(laughing)
00:48:02,00:48:04,"- Yeah, my house gets a shout out, it's quite cool."
00:48:04,00:48:05,(laughing)
00:48:05,00:48:06,"- Yeah, and so in the Wasteland,"
00:48:06,00:48:09,there's only one moment where you see through the eyes
00:48:09,00:48:12,"of T.S. Eliot, as in he's sitting in a spot looking up"
00:48:12,00:48:14,and that's by a bus stop down on Margate Beach
00:48:14,00:48:16,as he was there using the sea air to recover.
00:48:16,00:48:17,- Has it got a plaque?
00:48:17,00:48:19,"- It did, and that's down now, unfortunately."
00:48:19,00:48:21,"And what's even more annoying for T.S. Eliot,"
00:48:21,00:48:24,we did a great fact that his name is an anagram of toilets.
00:48:24,00:48:27,It is literally right next to the public toilets.
00:48:27,00:48:27,So--
00:48:27,00:48:29,"- People see the plaque saying T.S. Eliot,"
00:48:29,00:48:30,they just think it's a massive typo.
00:48:30,00:48:32,(laughing)
00:48:32,00:48:36,"- No, right next to his plaque is in block words, toilets."
00:48:36,00:48:38,"- They put underneath in brackets, Wasteland,"
00:48:38,00:48:39,but that didn't help anyone.
00:48:39,00:48:41,(laughing)
00:48:41,00:48:44,(upbeat music)
00:48:44,00:48:48,"- Okay, that's it, that is all of our facts."
