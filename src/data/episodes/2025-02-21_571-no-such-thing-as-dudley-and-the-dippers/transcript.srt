00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,000
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,760
 a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Hoburn.

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:20,880
 My name is Dan Schreiber,

5
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,800
 I'm sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,880
 Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin.

7
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,200
 Once again, we have gathered around the microphones with

8
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,880
 our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

9
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,160
 and in no particular order, here we go.

10
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:36,640
 Starting with fact number one, that is Anna.

11
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,800
 My fact this week is that ancient Rome had a secret name,

12
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,160
 and no one knows what it was to this very day.

13
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:44,840
 To this day.

14
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,760
 To this very day.

15
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,080
 It's very cool.

16
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:48,960
 It is very cool.

17
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,480
 It also, when you're looking into it,

18
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,400
 it also seems like did they?

19
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,240
 Was there definitely a secret name?

20
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,480
 Why do you think they're all making it up?

21
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,840
 It seems like it might have been something that was written by

22
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,560
 historians a bit later.

23
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,720
 No, no, it was written at the time.

24
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,280
 It was so, there's a bunch of ancient sources that claim it

25
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,800
 from about the first century onwards.

26
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,520
 So it's Plinian Plutarch of the first, but they quote.

27
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,920
 Paulini, she's quoting Paulini.

28
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,760
 Yeah, yeah.

29
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,360
 It was about six or seven different writers throughout

30
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,080
 the ancient Roman period saying this was a thing with

31
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,880
 like varying different accounts of what exactly it was.

32
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,720
 But they mostly said it's a name that only very few people know,

33
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,560
 like just really extreme dignitaries,

34
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,040
 with the queen and her corgis basically.

35
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,200
 And then even though they know it,

36
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,280
 they're not allowed to say it, even in special ceremonies.

37
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,680
 A couple of the writers said,

38
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,200
 "Sometimes in ceremonies they say the name, but no, there was..."

39
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,440
 What do you reckon it was?

40
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,440
 There's a few ideas, right?

41
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,160
 There are some ideas which are bullshit.

42
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,480
 Amor.

43
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,120
 Amor is the main one, first mentioned in the sixth century.

44
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,680
 An anagram of Rome.

45
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,080
 Indeed, just Rome backwards.

46
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,920
 The paladrome.

47
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,360
 And they call the city of love, don't they?

48
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,760
 That is Paris, famously.

49
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:00,960
 Yes, Syrap I call it.

50
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,520
 Yeah, there is that theory which is from a scholar called

51
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,440
 John the Lydian in the sixth century who said,

52
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,240
 just confidently, it was called Amor.

53
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,720
 That was a secret name.

54
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,960
 We don't seem to have evidence for that.

55
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,600
 And why?

56
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,760
 For protection, I think so.

57
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,760
 There's also a lot of stuff alongside it saying

58
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,800
 there was a secret goddess who protected Rome.

59
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,080
 And the reason you can't say the goddess's name

60
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,200
 is that then your enemies will know her name

61
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,080
 and then they can use her and they can call upon her

62
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,320
 and say, help me and stress.

63
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,800
 She would defect was the idea, right?

64
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,800
 She defect, yeah.

65
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,680
 And go with the enemy.

66
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,240
 So that's quite a common thing, I think, with gods, right?

67
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,120
 It's like if you know their name,

68
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,960
 then you can tell them what to do kind of thing.

69
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,560
 I think they happen in Egypt quite a lot.

70
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,760
 Like in the Book of the Dead, for instance,

71
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,400
 when you go to the underworld, you have to pass through these gates.

72
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,040
 But the only way you can pass through is if you name the gods,

73
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,680
 because you name them and when you've got the name,

74
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,360
 they have to do whatever you tell them.

75
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,640
 Is that, I mean, I'm hearing Rumpelstiltskin big time here.

76
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,640
 Oh, yes.

77
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,520
 It's basically the same story, isn't it?

78
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,520
 Yeah.

79
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,640
 Except he's going to, what is it, he's going to marry you

80
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,840
 if you don't know his name, he'll marry you,

81
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,080
 which is a bigger, is a more immediate threat.

82
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,000
 Yeah.

83
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,560
 There is a lot of people who've come up with ideas about this.

84
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:15,160
 So the Roma Amour idea, there was an author called Dolores Prato.

85
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,760
 And she said that one reason for saying

86
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,640
 that this could be the case is a lot of early Romans

87
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,720
 used to read and write from right to left.

88
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,120
 So they were very good at knowing...

89
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:26,960
 Palantroes.

90
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,520
 Palantroes, basically.

91
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,880
 Wait, did they, why did they read and write from right as in...

92
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,120
 Early Romans, according to Dolores Prato.

93
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,000
 Maybe Arabic influences, I don't know.

94
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,600
 Is that likely?

95
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,480
 In ancient, in the penitentiary.

96
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,840
 I've never heard that.

97
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,720
 I'll tell you one thing they did do is they used to write like

98
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,760
 secret squares, right, where you would write loads of five-letter words

99
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,040
 one after the other.

100
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,040
 And then the last one would be the reverse of the first one.

101
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,760
 And then if you read them up and down or left and right

102
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,680
 or on the diagonals, they all said the same thing.

103
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,480
 Abracadabra is one of those words.

104
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,920
 Well, you can write it in a triangle.

105
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,200
 So it's like one of those.

106
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,680
 And that's very powerful.

107
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,000
 There's a famous thing called the Sattor Square.

108
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,840
 Oh, yes.

109
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,560
 Sattor something, opera something, rotors.

110
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,080
 In fact, it sounds like Prato is a name that would fit

111
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,680
 in one of these mystical squares.

112
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,960
 Dolores Prato.

113
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,800
 Yeah, and what is that?

114
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,560
 Prato must be an anagram that says gotcha, you know,

115
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,120
 something like that, obviously not that.

116
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,120
 So there was someone supposedly who was executed for saying the name.

117
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,560
 Yes, you know, it was terrible punishment if you said it.

118
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,120
 Soranus, he was called.

119
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,200
 Stop it.

120
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,400
 Well, what, CJ?

121
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,280
 He was called Soranus.

122
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,280
 Now, people who listen to the podcast might remember Soranus.

123
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:40,360
 There was a guy called Soranus of Ephesus who came up with the idea

124
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,920
 of a midwife putting their fingers up your bum

125
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,840
 to orient the head of a baby before you give birth.

126
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,400
 But it's not that Soranus.

127
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,080
 It's a different Soranus.

128
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,960
 And this Soranus is according to Pliny.

129
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:56,680
 He was the first writer to provide a table of contents in a book ever.

130
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,840
 Before that, if you wanted to look something up,

131
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,480
 you just had to read the whole thing.

132
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,000
 But he invented the idea of putting a table of contents.

133
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,200
 And then he got into a barney with some of the bloke.

134
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,560
 And then he went to court and he said the name of Rome

135
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,720
 and he got executed.

136
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,400
 Yeah, right.

137
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,080
 But the main thing is the contents thing.

138
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,440
 Which is a bigger contribution to history?

139
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,200
 Which Soranus?

140
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,560
 Well, I think Soranus, the midwife.

141
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,680
 You say Soranus and I say Soranus.

142
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,720
 I think the midwife guy, because he's saved quite a lot of wives with that.

143
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,680
 Does that work?

144
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,280
 It does work.

145
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,360
 Yeah, I didn't know that.

146
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,160
 If you've got a breech baby and not like a full breech one,

147
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,000
 but if you're just trying to move the head in the right place.

148
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,040
 But if you don't have a table of contents,

149
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:37,520
 how can you even read a midwifery book to learn that in the first place?

150
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,240
 Well, fairness, Anus will be right near the start of the book.

151
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,440
 That's true.

152
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,080
 I wonder, you know, that thing of in ancient Rome,

153
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,400
 so many things would have been invented.

154
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,280
 So many amazing characters who've been lost through the footnotes of time.

155
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:52,880
 And do we have two Soranuses purely because their name is Soranus?

156
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:58,000
 You have so misunderstood classical historians, I don't know where to start.

157
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,640
 There are a lot of these sort of mystery cults, weren't there?

158
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:05,760
 So this name of Rome was to be used in sacred rituals, you know?

159
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,320
 Maybe, according to Sun.

160
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:12,000
 Okay, well, if it's never used, then what are we all doing here?

161
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,400
 I mean, but there was a place called the Cave of Rome.

162
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,160
 Did you hear of this?

163
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,520
 No. This is great.

164
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,960
 This is buried deep under the ruins of the palace of the Emperor Augustus.

165
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:26,840
 It was full of mosaics and seashells, which is pretty cool.

166
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:30,720
 And this may, according to legend,

167
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,800
 this is where Rome itself came to be.

168
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,640
 OK. I.E. where Romulus and Remus got suckled.

169
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,680
 They were found there by the wolf, the twins.

170
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,960
 I didn't know they were the sons of the God Mars.

171
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,160
 That gets glossed over a lot in the story.

172
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,840
 Like, they were Nepo babies, basically.

173
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,720
 They were just random twin babies who were left and then found by all.

174
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,440
 I don't think they are in all stories, are they?

175
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,280
 OK, maybe not. They might be.

176
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,440
 But there were ceremonies there for hundreds of years,

177
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,120
 and that's the secret cave of Rome.

178
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,240
 Do we know where it is?

179
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,600
 It's under the ruins of the palace of the Emperor Augustus,

180
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,160
 as I said, 30 seconds ago.

181
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,480
 But it's a real thing.

182
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,640
 Yeah, it's real. Right.

183
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:09,800
 On these secretive cults, I think my favourite is Mithraism or Mithraism.

184
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,320
 The thing about secret cults is they were really secret,

185
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,520
 so no one was allowed to write anything down or say anything.

186
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,040
 So it was all just rumour about what happened there,

187
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,840
 based on what people said.

188
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:22,640
 But they did stuff like there was lots of archaeological sources

189
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,760
 of Mithraic temples, where there's people killing bulls.

190
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,040
 There's one in London.

191
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,600
 There's a Mithraium in London.

192
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,600
 Yes.

193
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,520
 They found it when they were excavating.

194
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,640
 I can't remember what they were digging up.

195
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,000
 Yes, it's Rael or something.

196
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,360
 I think it was near the Museum of London, weirdly, it was found.

197
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,000
 Yeah, and they reconstructed what it would have looked like.

198
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,400
 And at the end, there's the classic image of Mithra slaughtering a bull.

199
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:47,600
 That was the big image of him wearing a Phrygian cap and Anatolian trousers.

200
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,880
 Oh, lovely. That was his...

201
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,840
 I can picture it now.

202
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,160
 That was his look.

203
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,520
 I think Phrygian cap is what the Smurfs wear.

204
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,920
 Yeah, yeah, they do.

205
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,640
 And Anatolian trousers, I don't know what they are.

206
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,440
 They're just trousers from modern-day Turkey.

207
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,560
 I imagined black pirate pants.

208
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,840
 I remember, yeah, like whirling dervish pants,

209
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,800
 so quite wide around the thighs and then tight around the knees.

210
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,320
 Yes.

211
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,280
 It's like MC Hammer.

212
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,280
 Yes, exactly.

213
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,280
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

214
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,360
 It was a primitive MC Hammer cult, basically.

215
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,680
 That's what he's based on.

216
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,680
 My favourite place in Rome is Amethraic Temple.

217
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,400
 It is by far the coolest site.

218
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,760
 Forget everything else, forget the Coliseum.

219
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,240
 About five minutes from the Coliseum,

220
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,720
 there's the Basilica of San Clement.

221
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,640
 Have you guys been to it?

222
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,760
 No, I think I might have been, maybe.

223
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,600
 It's an 11th-century church, you go in, 11th-century church.

224
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:34,360
 And there was a cleric who worked in the church in 1867,

225
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,760
 the friar who worked in the church,

226
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,560
 who just found that underneath it was hollow,

227
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,640
 and so they excavated underneath,

228
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,720
 and they found a fourth-century church,

229
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,920
 and now you can go descend down into that.

230
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,080
 So that's, you know, in the olden days, things were lower down

231
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,480
 because the ground hadn't accumulated on top of it yet.

232
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,480
 And that's incredible,

233
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,680
 and you're looking at fourth-century stuff, artwork preserved.

234
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,360
 Wow.

235
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,680
 And then, here it comes, a layer below they discover,

236
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,440
 not one, but two things, an ancient Roman house,

237
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,000
 which you can now wander through, deep underground,

238
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,600
 and the Amethraic Temple,

239
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,640
 which you can sit in.

240
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,800
 It's the coolest thing ever,

241
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,440
 and you can sit there and pretend to be taking, you know,

242
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,160
 sermons from the bullkiller or...

243
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,480
 Wow, that's very cool.

244
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,160
 Yeah, that's awesome.

245
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:15,840
 That's really cool.

246
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,400
 We don't know much about these places

247
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,560
 because you weren't supposed to...

248
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,520
 You weren't supposed to go there if you weren't allowed,

249
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,120
 and you often didn't write about them, right?

250
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,120
 Yes, exactly, it was only for initiates.

251
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,600
 But there was one,

252
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,000
 there was a festival of the goddess of fertility

253
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,440
 who's called Bonadir.

254
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,720
 It was only women who were allowed to go,

255
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,960
 and since men were the people who write stuff down,

256
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,000
 we didn't really know anything about it.

257
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,560
 But there was a huge scandal

258
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:44,000
 because a guy called Publius Claudius Pulcher, or Pulca,

259
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,680
 he disguised himself as a woman in 62 BC

260
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,560
 and went to the festival,

261
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,360
 and when people found out about it,

262
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,640
 oh, my days, this is bad news, oh, boy.

263
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:57,680
 I think that story is in one of Cicero's speeches.

264
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,920
 I think I've read the prosecution speech from that trial.

265
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,880
 I think it exists, wow.

266
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,520
 But the interesting thing is

267
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:09,760
 that he was prosecuted for incest.

268
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,600
 What?

269
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,920
 Claudius was one of the sort of chief gang dudes in ancient Rome,

270
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,360
 and he had a very, very attractive sister.

271
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,200
 And there was a big--

272
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,040
 That's no excuse, Andy.

273
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,040
 Absolutely not, but it was a big...

274
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,120
 Your honor, but your honor.

275
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,600
 Just look at her, your honor.

276
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:30,160
 Yeah, and that was one of his big rivalries.

277
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,480
 But can I say, for the listener,

278
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,960
 even though he was done for incest,

279
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,120
 he hadn't had sex with his sister.

280
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,480
 It was like a technical thing,

281
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,120
 because there was a thing about

282
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,640
 if you had sex with a Vestal Virgin,

283
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,480
 then that was counted as incest,

284
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:47,200
 because they were kind of the children of the city kind of thing

285
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,360
 who looked after the city and all that kind of stuff.

286
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,040
 And this was like an extension of this,

287
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,600
 because he defiled this cult of women.

288
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,480
 It counted technically as incest,

289
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,160
 even though none of them was related to him.

290
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,240
 Hang on, why do we know his sister so well?

291
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,880
 He also had, in his speech,

292
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,600
 I'm pretty sure I remember Cicero says,

293
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,720
 "Look at the sister on him though."

294
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,720
 You know, he was very much implying that he had also,

295
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,640
 I think, slept with his actual sister.

296
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:12,320
 That was a sort of low trick from Cicero, it wasn't so...

297
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,360
 Is that, James, what you said is that unbiased history,

298
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,080
 or is that the defense lawyer's speech that you read,

299
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,120
 that you got those facts?

300
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,000
 I don't know.

301
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,080
 Like, I got it from Wikipedia, I'll be honest.

302
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,960
 Now, I did read some of the...

303
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,280
 I read the Cicero thing.

304
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,560
 Like, I don't think it's biased.

305
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,760
 I think this is stuff that actually happened.

306
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,000
 No, that's just he got in trouble

307
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,560
 for invading the woman's space, as people shouldn't.

308
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,560
 But did he find out anything good?

309
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,400
 What were they doing?

310
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,480
 Were they all teaching how to insert tampons and stuff?

311
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:40,160
 They were all reading scary stories and kissing each other.

312
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,400
 Knew it! Knew it!

313
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,800
 Hey, can I tell you very quickly,

314
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,160
 this is not Ancient Rome, but it's Ancient China.

315
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,200
 It's a pretty astonishing thing.

316
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,920
 I was just looking into general secrets

317
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,400
 that we still don't know much about.

318
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,920
 For a good 3,000 years,

319
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:58,600
 there was a secret women's language called Nuxu,

320
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,480
 which is lady writing, basically.

321
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,640
 And it was for women who needed to pass on information

322
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,960
 to each other that they didn't want men to have any idea about.

323
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,480
 And they created an entire script.

324
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:11,120
 It's only in the 1980s that we even found out it existed.

325
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,080
 It lasted, yeah, for close to 3,000 years.

326
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,200
 So, the only thing I noticed is you guys found out it existed.

327
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,640
 We actually know...

328
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,760
 No, if you've ever watched ITV,

329
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,320
 the show Loose Women is actually broadcast in that language.

330
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,640
 And this language that women only speak is called New Shoes.

331
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,680
 Sex in the city is based on a lot of it's writing.

332
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,800
 Yeah, but it's amazing that it's all these years.

333
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,760
 And it's coming back, the last writers of it

334
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,600
 died a couple of decades ago,

335
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,000
 but they've worked it out and they're teaching it again,

336
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,240
 and so it's becoming a language again.

337
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,400
 It's beautiful to look at.

338
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,920
 It's actually, as someone pointed out, very sexy to look at.

339
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:50,240
 If writing could be sexy, this is it, yeah.

340
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,200
 Have you guys heard of boob slang?

341
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,480
 This is not related to Nuxu, by the way.

342
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,920
 This is a modern thing. This is New Zealand we're in now.

343
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,720
 And what's an environment where you get a lot of slang?

344
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,200
 - Sailors. - Not far off.

345
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,440
 It's an enclosed space.

346
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,440
 - Workshop. - Prisons.

347
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,760
 - Prisons. - Oh, it's not far off.

348
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,440
 I just want to say, it's when he's sailor's listening.

349
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,080
 Yeah, we know what you did, and you're very lucky

350
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:18,240
 that you haven't been banged up yet, no.

351
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,280
 What are they going to do, James? They're at sea.

352
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,440
 I could just hear right now.

353
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,600
 Set a course for London.

354
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,080
 Right now, ships are turning.

355
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,800
 I just need to stay.

356
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,960
 I just need to stay in central Leicestershire,

357
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,560
 and I'll be fine.

358
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,080
 No boob.

359
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,960
 Grand Eugie and Camel!

360
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:43,280
 No boob slang is a New Zealand prison language.

361
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,760
 And it has 3,000 separate words.

362
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,400
 So obviously, let's get into it.

363
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,960
 What is boob?

364
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,440
 It's the name of the language.

365
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,120
 Yeah, well, boob slang is the language.

366
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:57,040
 - Oh, it's the boob. - It's the name of the person.

367
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,360
 - It's prison. - It's prison.

368
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,360
 - We're in the boob. - We're in boob.

369
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,800
 So what's a boob story?

370
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,640
 - It's a story that you tell when you're in prison. - Prison story.

371
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,560
 Are they all hang-up?

372
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,160
 And that's how they all work.

373
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:14,760
 What are boob handcuffs?

374
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,840
 I said, has anyone eaten boob lunch today?

375
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,960
 What am I asking?

376
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:23,240
 I think boob story is how you ended up in the big house, basically.

377
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,840
 All right, what's a double yoka?

378
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,840
 Oh, a double yoka.

379
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:30,440
 - Is it two black eyes? - Is it a bit of great luck?

380
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,280
 It's just an idiot.

381
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,480
 A double yoka. I don't know why.

382
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,440
 I would think a double yoka would be brainier than the average.

383
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,040
 Is it like a yoko?

384
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,160
 But then the doubly as yokely as a yoko.

385
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,720
 It might be. It doesn't have an anonyme.

386
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,560
 Let's have one more. What's a good night kiss?

387
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:47,440
 Oh, it's one of those shower things that we don't know we should get into.

388
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,440
 Knockout punch.

389
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:53,560
 Get your hands off my boob boobs.

390
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,200
 Dan's right. It's a knockout punch.

391
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:00,360
 So be very careful if you ask someone in prison to give you a good night kiss.

392
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,960
 Do you think you would?

393
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,720
 I don't know.

394
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,360
 I think it would make you feel happy, wouldn't it?

395
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,360
 I was reassuring you a bit.

396
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,040
 - To the guards. - Yeah, to the guards.

397
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,520
 - On night number one. - Excuse me?

398
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,520
 My mummy always.

399
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:24,160
 OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is James.

400
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,960
 OK, my fact this week is that in 2010, Jaguar made a car

401
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:31,800
 that sounded like an actual Jaguar.

402
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,160
 Give us an idea of what that sounds like.

403
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,640
 Roar!

404
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,920
 - Yeah, OK. - It's very good.

405
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,880
 I had to do the hand gesture when I do that as well.

406
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:44,240
 I sort of think cars sound a bit like roaring animals.

407
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,800
 It was easier than making it sound like a laughing hyena, for instance.

408
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,400
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - You know, there wasn't much to tweak.

409
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,120
 But I did listen because you can hear a sample online.

410
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,880
 And it does start with the regular car sound.

411
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,120
 And in your head, you're going, "Oh, that doesn't sound..."

412
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,680
 And then out of nowhere, a Jaguar sound.

413
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,600
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - And yeah.

414
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,520
 So it does, it is distinctly different.

415
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:07,360
 Yeah, so this was debuted at the 2010 Paris Motor Show.

416
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,320
 And it was the Jaguar CX75.

417
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:14,360
 And it was designed by a guy called Ian Callum.

418
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,720
 And then last year, he's started his own business now

419
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,360
 called Callum That Makes Cars.

420
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,720
 And he is making his own version,

421
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,040
 which is the original one was a concept one.

422
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,640
 I think it was in the movie Spectre.

423
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,840
 - Yeah. - But he's making ones that are street legal.

424
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,760
 So they've got the basic safety that you need

425
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,600
 and the right emissions and stuff like that.

426
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,040
 So if you want to give him a loaded dash, he'll make you one.

427
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,080
 - So Spectre, they were provided supposedly

428
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,280
 with about five of these cars, five to seven.

429
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,200
 No one actually knows how many of these have been produced

430
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,600
 as of yet because it's not on the road.

431
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,360
 - Another one of those secrets. - It's another secret, yeah.

432
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,560
 And if anyone watches it, it's a chase scene,

433
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,960
 Bond is in the nest in Marden,

434
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:55,720
 and he's being chased by someone who is in this Jaguar.

435
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,280
 - Don't watch Spectre just for that chase though.

436
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,480
 - Are there other reasons to watch it?

437
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,200
 - No. - Right, thank you.

438
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,200
 - Well, so if you're going to watch it,

439
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,880
 it should be just for that chase, it sounds like.

440
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,040
 - Oh yeah, that's a good point.

441
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,360
 - Can I just say one more thing about Ian Callum?

442
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,720
 - Oh yeah. - By the way,

443
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,280
 when he was 14 years old,

444
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,280
 he submitted a car design to Jaguar

445
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,040
 in the hope of getting a job.

446
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,800
 And then later on, he went on to work for them.

447
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,120
 - That's very cool. - Yeah.

448
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,920
 - I just want to see that car that he designed,

449
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:24,520
 'cause I'm sure, I mean, he's one of the great car designers,

450
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,280
 but for 14 year old,

451
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,480
 it's gonna look like Homer Simpson's car, isn't it?

452
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,800
 - Have you seen a cyber truck?

453
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:36,320
 - So on car sound, something that is added by manufacturers

454
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,920
 is the noise of car doors closing,

455
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,640
 or it's enhanced by manufacturers.

456
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,360
 - Shulk that, shulk.

457
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,200
 - Yeah, 'cause they think that,

458
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,160
 so cars used to be heavier,

459
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,200
 they made of different materials,

460
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,320
 so they made that really satisfying, deep clunk.

461
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,160
 And now car manufacturers don't actually need

462
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,080
 to use such heavy materials, they're a bit more efficient,

463
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,600
 but they think if people hear a lighter, tinny clunk,

464
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,160
 they'll think it's not as expensive.

465
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,720
 So then they alter the design

466
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,200
 to make the car door thudding clunk sound more,

467
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,560
 and they go to huge lengths.

468
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,800
 So what was it?

469
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,080
 Cadillac was saying that they listened to dozens

470
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,240
 and dozens of different cars

471
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,400
 and make notes on their sounds,

472
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,880
 and then investigate all the cars

473
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:17,440
 to work out what's making that sound the way it sounds,

474
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,040
 and then combine them.

475
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:19,880
 - I don't know if you've heard that,

476
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,240
 cars are big business.

477
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:24,000
 - I've never seen one.

478
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,880
 - What would you, to your car, sound sonically, if you could?

479
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:31,480
 - One of those boop boop boop horns.

480
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,320
 - A clown horn.

481
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,160
 - A clown horn, a clown horn.

482
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,000
 - Yeah, that's nice.

483
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,880
 - I saw one grab in a boob in the '87s.

484
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:41,240
 - Yeah, I do have a favorite car sound now

485
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,600
 as a result of looking up this fact,

486
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,400
 which is pink noise.

487
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,280
 You heard a pink noise?

488
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,120
 This is a really fascinating innovation.

489
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,960
 So this noise is something you would only ever hear

490
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,200
 if you're about to get into a crash,

491
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,720
 and they're anticipating--

492
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,560
 - Who's it?

493
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,400
 - Fuck!

494
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,800
 - Oh, you have heard it.

495
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,600
 Yeah, pink noise, it's really interesting.

496
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,920
 So one of the things that happens to a lot of people

497
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,200
 who get into big crashes,

498
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,840
 the sound is incredibly loud,

499
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,200
 and it damages their hearing.

500
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,840
 So when it detects a potential collision,

501
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,360
 it puts out this sound, which is at 80 decibels,

502
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,880
 which basically prepares your ear

503
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,800
 for this even louder 165 decibels

504
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,880
 that it's about to receive.

505
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,400
 And so it's a way of getting your ears into a place

506
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,680
 where they're not gonna get damaged.

507
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,520
 - What?

508
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,360
 - Yeah, it's really interesting.

509
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,960
 - 'Cause my car has a thing which beeps

510
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,040
 where it thinks I'm about to hit something,

511
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,680
 but that's not this, right?

512
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,840
 And it's going on all the time.

513
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,040
 I've actually had to rip it out.

514
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,800
 (laughing)

515
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,800
 - That's incredible, and that protects your ears

516
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,600
 by warming your ears up to that.

517
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,640
 - I don't think your ears could be tricked

518
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,600
 out of mechanical deafness.

519
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,400
 - No, it's so, okay, this is what it says.

520
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,080
 It says, "It triggers muscles in the ear

521
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:50,480
 "to contract by reflex, automatically bracing the inner ear

522
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,000
 "and the ear drum for extremely loud noise by the crash."

523
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 - You've all heard of Hans Zimmer.

524
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,840
 - Yeah, of course.

525
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,880
 - Yeah, invented the Zimmer frame.

526
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,720
 - That's right.

527
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,280
 (laughing)

528
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,800
 So we're talking Inception,

529
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,400
 Pirates of the Caribbean, The Lion King,

530
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,200
 Gladiator, Dunkirk, Dune.

531
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,640
 - He did the music for them.

532
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,480
 - He did the music.

533
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,760
 He did the music for all of these.

534
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,240
 Dune too.

535
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,080
 - He also designed the sound of the BMW.

536
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,560
 So electric cars, they don't have

537
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,600
 an internal combustion engine.

538
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,080
 They do not need to sound like a car.

539
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:22,000
 But you can't just have them sounding like anything

540
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,720
 'cause if you're driving close to someone,

541
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,360
 they need to know there's a car passing by.

542
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,360
 - And they need to know it's a car.

543
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,800
 You can't do a horse noise or like a crazy bird noise.

544
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,640
 - Exactly.

545
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,480
 - That's a temptation.

546
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,640
 - But Hans Zimmer was given the brief

547
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,400
 to define what was it,

548
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:37,920
 to compose the sound of e-mobility for BMW.

549
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,760
 (laughing)

550
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,920
 - And it's exactly the exact same.

551
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,880
 - It was really good.

552
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,400
 - And I listened to it and it just sounds like a car.

553
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,680
 - Well, that's the idea, then, Andy.

554
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,800
 - No, but it sounds too much like a car.

555
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,560
 As in if I was getting Zimmer on the case,

556
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,320
 I'd want something that revolutionized.

557
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,480
 - Yeah, but when you watched Dune,

558
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,800
 did you think, oh, that just sounds like a giant worm?

559
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,000
 (laughing)

560
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,240
 Like he's just brilliant at making things

561
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,480
 sound like they're supposed to sound.

562
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,920
 - Really, the worms sound like a BMW.

563
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,240
 (laughing)

564
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,080
 - It's very confusing.

565
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,640
 Yeah, no, and they have an in-helps person,

566
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,080
 don't they, BMW, who is doing this.

567
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,840
 So Zimmer was sort of brought in to collaborate

568
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,880
 with a guy called Renzo Vitale,

569
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,960
 who's already there creating these sounds.

570
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,160
 'Cause as we know, and we've spoken about

571
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,560
 on this podcast before,

572
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:17,760
 it is a time where the electric car is knocking out sounds

573
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,960
 and people are finding that incredibly scary.

574
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,920
 In fact, Jaguar are saying that they're gonna go

575
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,520
 entirely electric by this year.

576
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,720
 And who knows if that's gonna happen,

577
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,480
 but that certainly was said a while ago.

578
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,320
 And so things like the British Library

579
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,680
 are starting to archive car sounds.

580
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,000
 So the Jaguar car sound,

581
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,120
 which is a notably famous car sound

582
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,600
 amongst car connoisseurs,

583
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,280
 is now part of the audio library in there

584
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,160
 because my children might never know that sound.

585
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,520
 - God, I can imagine the bore.

586
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,640
 If you see someone listening to that audio

587
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,160
 in the British Library of all the things

588
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,400
 you could be looking at,

589
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,760
 you're not talking to them, are you?

590
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,320
 - Imagine you see an attractive person

591
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,600
 on the other side of the train

592
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,960
 and they've got their headphones in

593
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,400
 and you think they'll sidle over,

594
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,680
 "Hey, what are you listening to?"

595
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,760
 (laughing)

596
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,600
 - And the Zimmer.

597
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,440
 - Oh, I love that.

598
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,480
 (laughing)

599
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,880
 - One thing where this is important

600
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:07,880
 is in formula E, which is like formula one,

601
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,680
 but for electric cars.

602
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,760
 I read an article in the Washington Post

603
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,920
 that was talking about this

604
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,520
 and they said that the cars were going round

605
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,400
 and they sounded like electric toothbrushes.

606
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,240
 (laughing)

607
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,440
 Going round.

608
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,080
 Which when you think about the formula one,

609
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,520
 it's like, "Round, round."

610
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,720
 But then I read another article

611
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,920
 that said that the old F1 engines,

612
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,480
 they had a volume that would peak

613
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,920
 between 500 and 2500 hertz,

614
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:34,200
 which is about the same frequency as a human scream.

615
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,800
 And that's the reason people like it so much

616
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,640
 'cause it really puts you on edge.

617
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,480
 - Right.

618
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,320
 - You're watching the cars

619
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,840
 but you're kind of on edge the whole time.

620
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,440
 You're really excited about it

621
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,000
 because your brain is thinking,

622
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,240
 "Is someone screaming there or something?"

623
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,320
 - Yeah, yeah.

624
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,480
 The drivers, it's always their first time.

625
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,920
 And they're very, very scared.

626
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,800
 (screaming)

627
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,560
 Even they got pink noise in there.

628
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,000
 But even petrol car noise is a fake.

629
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:55,880
 That's what I find so weird.

630
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:58,160
 Even these days, like the car door thing,

631
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,720
 it's this thing skeuomorphism.

632
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,600
 We've talked, maybe we mentioned this before,

633
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,040
 it's where you have a new technology

634
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,040
 but you keep an element from the old technology

635
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,200
 for aesthetic reasons.

636
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,200
 Like an app which has a picture of a bookshelf

637
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,440
 to trick you into thinking you're reading an ancient tome.

638
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,520
 You know, it's just that skeuomorphism.

639
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,880
 And all these modern cars, even petrol ones,

640
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,840
 still, they play fake engine noises.

641
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,640
 Some of them literally have speakers in the cabin.

642
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,480
 - They do, wasn't it?

643
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,040
 I think a car journalist found this out.

644
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,040
 It was in the Ford Mustang,

645
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:25,120
 which has apparently an incredibly famous sound.

646
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,560
 He broke his speakers or something,

647
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,120
 or pulled a fuse that took his speaker out

648
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,080
 and he was like, "Oh my God, the engine's gone off."

649
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,680
 And it turns out that's just...

650
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,520
 - It's great.

651
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,480
 I think so many sounds must be manufactured

652
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,080
 in a way that we don't realize.

653
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,880
 It's like secret sounds everywhere.

654
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,520
 Someone was telling me that they have an old mouse

655
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,240
 which when you click, you hear a noise.

656
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,520
 And apparently it's a little speaker in there

657
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,640
 that is playing that.

658
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,760
 (laughing)

659
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,200
 Yeah, it's a little tiny speaker that when you click it,

660
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,400
 it's playing a sound.

661
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,000
 It's not the click itself that's happening

662
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,920
 because people found it quite disorientating

663
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,240
 to have a mouse that wasn't clicking anymore.

664
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,680
 And so they created a little...

665
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,640
 - It sounds so real. - What is real?

666
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,560
 - I have a little speaker that I keep in my trousers

667
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,680
 'cause I can only do silent but deadly farts

668
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,520
 and it really puts people off.

669
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,400
 So whenever I know one's coming,

670
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,280
 I press the button and it makes them nice.

671
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,800
 - Wow, yeah.

672
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,640
 Oh, that's good.

673
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,480
 Is it Bose?

674
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:18,840
 'Cause yours are very basic, basic, yeah.

675
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,420
 (upbeat music)

676
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,040
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three

677
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,360
 and that is my fact.

678
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,440
 My fact this week is that Queen Elizabeth I

679
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:33,320
 never visited Shakespeare's Globe.

680
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:36,320
 However, she did visit a venue down the road

681
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,400
 to watch bears fighting a dog and monkey.

682
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,960
 - Oh, it does depend on the Shakespeare play, I would say.

683
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,160
 - Right, yeah. - Some Shakespeare plays,

684
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,800
 way better than a dog fighting a monkey.

685
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,720
 (laughing)

686
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,240
 Others, yeah.

687
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,400
 I read this, by the way,

688
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,960
 in a book called "London A Travel Guide Through Time"

689
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,520
 by Dr. Matthew Green.

690
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,160
 I love this book and my wife actually

691
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,320
 was the editor on the book.

692
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,680
 And it's actually--

693
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,880
 - Ah, that is this cool.

694
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,960
 - Is this Spond?

695
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,000
 It's like eight, 10 years old now, this book.

696
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,760
 - She's still looking back. - She's doing Worldies.

697
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,680
 (laughing)

698
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,760
 - Anyway, if you could all buy it

699
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,080
 with three children to feed.

700
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,320
 No, it's a fantastic book where Matthew Green takes

701
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,080
 the reader as if they were a time traveler

702
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,680
 through different periods of London.

703
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:21,880
 The first one you start in is walking along the South Bank

704
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,000
 and you're heading towards Shakespeare's Globe.

705
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,200
 But he makes the point that, surprisingly,

706
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:29,960
 Queen Elizabeth I never went to the Globe,

707
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:33,040
 but she did go to a venue that was very near to it

708
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,640
 to watch this extraordinary thing

709
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,320
 where bears would be brought into an arena

710
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:40,160
 and they would have dogs that would let loose on them

711
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,760
 and they would just fight until either it looked like

712
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:45,080
 the dogs have had way too much and were gonna die

713
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,480
 or that the bear looked a bit injured

714
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,320
 because these bears were kind of like professional wrestlers.

715
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,000
 They were famous in their day.

716
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,400
 People knew their names.

717
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,800
 One's even named in a Shakespeare play itself.

718
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,800
 So this is a big deal.

719
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,960
 So yeah, it's a-

720
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,360
 - Which is the famous one, can you remember?

721
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,200
 - Yeah, it's-

722
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,280
 - He was called "Team on a Bathance."

723
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:04,160
 - I think he was called "Sackerson," I believe.

724
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,000
 - Oh.

725
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,520
 - He was a real celebrity bear.

726
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,840
 - Yeah, there was Ned Whitting.

727
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,080
 There was Harry Hunks.

728
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,640
 There was Blind Bess.

729
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,160
 And then "Sackerson," yeah, in "The Merry Wives of Windsor."

730
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,000
 - Okay.

731
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,600
 - And yeah, it's literally the worst play.

732
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,280
 The worst of Shakespeare's plays, arguably,

733
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,880
 maybe the worst of all plays ever written.

734
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,720
 It's really bad.

735
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,680
 So did they throw "Sackerson" in

736
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,800
 just to sort of boost up its interest?

737
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,640
 - I have some ratings.

738
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,640
 - There's a theory that Shakespeare wrote it in nine days.

739
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,600
 It was a very, very rushed job play.

740
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,440
 - Right.

741
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,600
 - They had to quickly come up with something.

742
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,560
 And he just sort of said, "I'm gonna pull this out."

743
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,480
 - "I'll chuck a bear in there.

744
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,480
 People will rock up."

745
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,640
 And it was a fair fight.

746
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,160
 I think he said that it was bears fighting a dog and a monkey,

747
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,280
 but I think they would usually give him a few dogs.

748
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,120
 - Yeah, yeah, a bunch of dogs, sometimes the monkey.

749
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,760
 The monkey was usually on horseback.

750
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,600
 Like it was-

751
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,760
 - So it has an advantage there, doesn't it?

752
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:47,600
 - Yeah.

753
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,440
 - Wait, who's fighting who?

754
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,280
 - The monkey's on a horse.

755
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,120
 Who's the monkey on a horse fighting?

756
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,160
 - No, I think in that case,

757
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,040
 I think the monkey is just riding around on a horse

758
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,360
 as a bit of entertainment.

759
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,280
 - Oh, wait, so the bears didn't fight the monkey?

760
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,960
 - I think monkeys did fight bears.

761
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,320
 - But I don't think you could incentivize a bear

762
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,840
 to repeatedly attack a horse, can you?

763
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,240
 - Who's the horse fighting?

764
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,440
 The horse is just having a good time.

765
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,280
 - Yeah.

766
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,120
 - It's just a day out.

767
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:05,960
 - Horse is confused.

768
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:06,800
 It's just hanging out.

769
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,280
 Well, it was confusing, wasn't it?

770
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,000
 Because this is gruesome entertainment.

771
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 Yet when you read people writing about it,

772
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,400
 it was like a great day out.

773
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,600
 - I read a lot of articles about it for this.

774
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,000
 One thing I really liked about it

775
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,240
 is they sometimes did it in pubs.

776
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:22,240
 And they do seem to have had bear gardens,

777
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,600
 which is where they did the fighting.

778
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,440
 Which is just like--

779
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,000
 - Is that where we get bear garden?

780
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,560
 - Well, I think.

781
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,840
 But yeah, lots of play.

782
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,680
 There's a trolling.

783
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,480
 I think the way we live now has the bear garden

784
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,840
 as the gentleman's club they go to.

785
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,960
 The name stayed on and bear garden was anywhere

786
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:38,800
 the bears for.

787
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,720
 - And there is a road called bear garden now.

788
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,560
 - Yes.

789
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:44,160
 - And Bear Lane, yeah, near the spots where this happened.

790
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,600
 - It's one of those sports which makes you think,

791
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,320
 oh, people in the past would just,

792
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,400
 I owe nothing to them.

793
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,680
 I don't care about their civilization.

794
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:54,240
 I don't think their values are at all interesting to me.

795
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,480
 - Well, let's not get into the cultural relativism.

796
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,120
 Is it Bellatoturf, Foxes and Shreds?

797
00:27:59,120 --> 00:27:59,960
 Who knows?

798
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,800
 Who are we to judge?

799
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,800
 - Yeah, like you do every day.

800
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,640
 - I tell you that--

801
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,840
 - Andy, I've seen you on the hunt.

802
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:10,840
 - Yeah, but it's so, it's really grim.

803
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,280
 But the Puritans didn't like it.

804
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,320
 - They're boars though, weren't they?

805
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,520
 - The Puritans carried out plenty of it.

806
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,760
 They tried some things in other spaces and times.

807
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,080
 - Sorry, who were the boars fighting?

808
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,160
 (laughing)

809
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,080
 - The Puritans banned it.

810
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,360
 I think part of their objection was

811
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,360
 that it happened on Sundays.

812
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:27,040
 Not that it's a bit grim.

813
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,840
 - One of these arenas collapsed on the South Bank.

814
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,400
 And the Puritans all said that this was

815
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:34,760
 because God was displeasured about what was going on.

816
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,600
 - They would say that.

817
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,680
 - But actually, they weren't that bothered

818
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,920
 about bears getting hurt.

819
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,560
 They just thought everyone was having too much fun.

820
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:42,640
 - Yeah, that's the thing, it was encouraging odd ideas.

821
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,000
 Some of them cared about the animals,

822
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,880
 but majority of the Puritans didn't.

823
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,640
 And one of the places that collapsed

824
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,480
 is where Queen Elizabeth went to the venue itself

825
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,120
 when it was rebuilt and had a French ambassador

826
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:53,960
 come and see a show.

827
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,480
 So it was a private showing.

828
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,800
 I asked Dr. Matthew Green about the globe thing.

829
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,400
 And he said, "To be fair,

830
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,960
 "Queen Elizabeth didn't need to go to the globe.

831
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,480
 "Shakespeare came to her."

832
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:06,560
 So it's not as if she was against Shakespeare in plays.

833
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,760
 But she did go to one of the bear garden places.

834
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,040
 - 'Cause the bears wouldn't go to her.

835
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,440
 - The bears wouldn't go to her.

836
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,400
 They were drunk in the pub.

837
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,760
 - All Republicans.

838
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,600
 - And the other thing is,

839
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,720
 is that this whole point of trying to ban it on the Sundays,

840
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:20,040
 Queen Elizabeth herself actually overturned

841
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:23,600
 a parliamentary motion to have it banned on Sundays,

842
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,560
 'cause she was like, "No, this is great entertainment."

843
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:28,800
 - The bears, we should say, as you sort of did,

844
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,000
 they weren't killed that often.

845
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,080
 It was just a lot of the dogs they got through.

846
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:32,920
 The bears actually had quite a few times.

847
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,200
 - Did you see what they were wearing?

848
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,880
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

849
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,800
 - But the masts, my God, they went through a lot.

850
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,320
 And there was actually the, yeah, the dogs.

851
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,760
 There was a master of the king's bears

852
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:45,040
 who was deployed from about the 1400s, I think,

853
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,280
 who was the person who was responsible

854
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,360
 for looking after the royal bears,

855
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,440
 basically looking after bear fights.

856
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,520
 And they were constantly having to restock mastiff.

857
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,800
 So I think in Queen Elizabeth's time,

858
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,320
 in King James's time, it was a guy called Alayne,

859
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,480
 who was an actor, so he acted in plays and stuff.

860
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,640
 But also he had to be always going around the country.

861
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,760
 And he had the right to take people's dogs, I think,

862
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,080
 if he needed spare ones or can't seem to negotiate.

863
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,880
 And if anyone was doing a bear fight or a bear dog fight

864
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:12,120
 around the country, then he got a cut.

865
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,160
 - Which is pretty sweet.

866
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,000
 - It is wild.

867
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,160
 And apparently bears were literally walked

868
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,640
 past you in the streets, you know,

869
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,000
 they weren't like in cages.

870
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,200
 They're just on like a leech, like a dog,

871
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,480
 just sort of from the pub heading over to,

872
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,120
 say, oh, watch out for the bear.

873
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,880
 It's just wild time.

874
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,720
 - Step aside, darling.

875
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,560
 - Yeah.

876
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,680
 - I'm with Andy that this is a bad thing.

877
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,720
 - Yeah, actually.

878
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,920
 - Guys, James and I are, James and I are.

879
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,920
 - We're not putting you two against us two on this one.

880
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,760
 - Oh, look, I'm just saying, like,

881
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,520
 if anyone at home agrees with me and Andy, then, you know.

882
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,360
 - Thanks, James.

883
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,680
 - Really, thank you for the support there.

884
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,800
 And I'm so glad that we're on this.

885
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,720
 - Oh, it's very brave of you.

886
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,560
 Well done.

887
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,400
 (laughing)

888
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,680
 Look, there was other stuff that was like peripheral

889
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,000
 to the bear baiting, which was actually quite fun.

890
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,200
 So I was reading an account by, I think,

891
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,080
 a foreigner who came to watch one of these,

892
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,240
 obviously barbaric displays.

893
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,400
 But also there were-

894
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,080
 - Amazon boardnet, just feeling a bit cold now, Dan.

895
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:03,160
 (laughing)

896
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,880
 - Thought I slipped that in.

897
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,720
 So there were dogs chasing horses around

898
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,800
 as one of the rounds.

899
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,160
 So this is in between the bear baiting.

900
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,960
 You know, you use the arena for other things.

901
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,520
 Dogs chasing horses.

902
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,440
 Men and women were brought out in boxes

903
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:17,880
 to fight, dance and converse with each other for entertainment.

904
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:18,800
 (laughing)

905
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,240
 There was another quite fun thing

906
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,400
 where a man threw some white bread among the crowd.

907
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,680
 The crowd all scrambled for it.

908
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,520
 And then over the middle of the arena,

909
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:31,280
 a giant rose was fixed and then set on fire by a rocket.

910
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,600
 Lots of apples and pears fell down from this rocket

911
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,640
 while all the people were scrambling for the bread

912
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,320
 and scared the shit out of them.

913
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,400
 - That sounds like Hella Gabalus, doesn't it?

914
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,240
 - Yes, it does.

915
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,000
 - A man and emperor who used to do weird things like that,

916
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 like drown people in rose petals and stuff.

917
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:44,840
 - Yes.

918
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,520
 I think none of these people even drowned

919
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:50,000
 in the raining apples and pears and bread.

920
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,920
 They just got a nice bit of white bread.

921
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,800
 It's just quite weird to imagine that crowd goes that mad

922
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,920
 for some crumbs of white bread.

923
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,920
 - I might have said this before,

924
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,600
 but I was in a cricket crowd once

925
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:01,080
 where people were throwing out bits of soiree and malt loaf

926
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,200
 and everyone were absolutely mental for that.

927
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:07,280
 - Oh, I don't blame you, I would too.

928
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,400
 That's nice.

929
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,680
 - Elizabethan sort of hobbies in general?

930
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,520
 - Yeah.

931
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,520
 - Sort of that kind of thing.

932
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,960
 I got a bit distracted by things

933
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,480
 that Queen Elizabeth liked doing.

934
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,320
 - All right.

935
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:21,680
 - She liked going to parties,

936
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,920
 specifically large parties held for her around the country.

937
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:27,600
 - Didn't you just have to go to those?

938
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,600
 Do we know that you like--

939
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,640
 - Far from, no, no.

940
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,600
 So you know the thing of royal progress is?

941
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,440
 - No.

942
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,800
 - It's where the monarch would go around the whole country

943
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:35,760
 and it dates back to a time

944
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,200
 when there wasn't a proper court and a proper castle.

945
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,520
 You might have a bit of a fortress,

946
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,720
 but basically to subdue your territory

947
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,240
 and show you're still the boss man,

948
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,320
 you have to go around quite a lot

949
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,880
 and the court is always on the move.

950
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,520
 And that still survived even when Queen Elizabeth

951
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,920
 was on the throne.

952
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,600
 You would progress to various different

953
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,080
 stately homes around the country

954
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,400
 and they would go into a huge tiz

955
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,240
 'cause the queen or king was coming and you'd have to--

956
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,080
 - Is that the same thing

957
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:01,400
 there's like certain stately homes still have laws

958
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,880
 that if the monarch goes there,

959
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,240
 then they have to give them a bed.

960
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,480
 - I think it's that, it's exactly that.

961
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,980
 New toilet seats and all of that.

962
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:11,320
 And there was one party which was hosted

963
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,080
 by the Earl of Leicester, who was Robert Dudley.

964
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,080
 - Yep, her fave, that's not all.

965
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,480
 - Her fave, he was constantly proposing to her.

966
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,440
 That was her other hobby was turning down the proposals

967
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:23,120
 of Dudley and he threw this huge party,

968
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:27,040
 the Kenilworth Spectacle in 1575, 19 days of partying.

969
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:30,320
 He built her her own micro palace on his grounds.

970
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,160
 And then she complained,

971
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,400
 I can't see the garden you've commissioned from my bedroom.

972
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,760
 So he had his gardeners build her a new version

973
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,360
 of the garden overnight under her window.

974
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,160
 Crazy, there was a water pageant

975
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,920
 with an 18 foot long mermaid.

976
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,600
 There was a moving island, there were fireworks,

977
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,120
 there was hunting, there were plays.

978
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,280
 He was the least popular man in England, we should say.

979
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:50,040
 He was incredibly popular 'cause his wife he married

980
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,560
 when he was a teenager had mysteriously died

981
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,600
 two years after Elizabeth became the queen.

982
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,760
 And there was a lot of talk that maybe he was responsible.

983
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:59,360
 - I guess back then as well, you don't know so many people.

984
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,880
 Like there's like six celebrities back then, right?

985
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,160
 So he would have been one

986
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,400
 and one's got to be the most hated.

987
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,040
 - It's not like you could have like some people hate

988
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:10,440
 Piers Morgan and some people hate Elon Musk.

989
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,320
 Like you basically, everyone's going for the same one.

990
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,280
 - I got six people to pick from, that's it.

991
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,600
 - Yeah, well, he was so unpopular.

992
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,800
 - Probably because everyone knew

993
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,280
 that he fancied Elizabeth, right?

994
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,480
 Everyone always hates the person

995
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,360
 who's trying to have the affair with the monarch.

996
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,760
 - And might have killed his first wife.

997
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,040
 - I don't like the first wife thing.

998
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:28,160
 - She definitely died two years after she became queen.

999
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,240
 So an old lady from Brentwood told her neighbors

1000
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:33,920
 that my Lord Robert hath given her majesty a red petticoat

1001
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:36,160
 implying that they've slept together.

1002
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,840
 - New Zealand jail slang.

1003
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,400
 - It's boob slang, yeah.

1004
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:42,120
 She was jailed for even telling her neighbors that.

1005
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:42,960
 - Really?

1006
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:43,800
 - So they were crushing down on it.

1007
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,560
 But yeah, so that was.

1008
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,400
 - That's interesting.

1009
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,400
 - Was the kennel a thing that he displayed put on?

1010
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,880
 That was where they accidentally burned a town

1011
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,040
 to the ground, right?

1012
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,200
 (laughing)

1013
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,840
 - That normally have not helped his popularity yet.

1014
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,200
 (laughing)

1015
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,520
 - I don't know that.

1016
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:00,000
 - It was 1572, it was one of the things

1017
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,720
 that he put on for Elizabeth.

1018
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:04,480
 And he staged this huge mock battle for her.

1019
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,280
 And they had these amazing fireworks.

1020
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,160
 And then they had cannons that they just fired

1021
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,440
 randomly into the air.

1022
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,440
 And they all landed on the adjacent town

1023
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,560
 and burned down a bunch of houses

1024
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,880
 and killed at least one person.

1025
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:16,520
 - That's the most upper class English sentence ever.

1026
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,880
 Is that the town I accidentally burned down?

1027
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,640
 (laughing)

1028
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,840
 - Please, yeah.

1029
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,720
 - Just very quickly, Henry VIII,

1030
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,600
 father of Elizabeth the First,

1031
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,880
 also loved bear baiting.

1032
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,960
 And he used to go around the country as well.

1033
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,520
 And one thing that he always brought with him

1034
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:36,200
 was a locksmith who always put a new lock

1035
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,600
 on the door that he was sleeping in

1036
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,920
 of the room that he was in.

1037
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:39,760
 - Really?

1038
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,960
 - Yeah, 'cause he was so worried about assassination.

1039
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,760
 And then when they left the next day

1040
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,920
 or however many days later,

1041
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,400
 he would take the lock off the door again.

1042
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,920
 So you just have this messed up door

1043
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,560
 as a result of the stay.

1044
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,880
 And he would bring it to the next house

1045
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,440
 and he would lock it onto the new door.

1046
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,600
 - Oh, so it's one lock.

1047
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,440
 He's not having to put--

1048
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,280
 - I'm sure he had multiple,

1049
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,440
 but he would always put it on and take it off.

1050
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,600
 So you left with the lock.

1051
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,440
 - That's quite good.

1052
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,000
 That's a good plot device, I'm sorry.

1053
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,720
 Like the lock man is the assassin, you know?

1054
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,400
 - He's gonna be the first person everyone suspects

1055
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,240
 when suddenly the lock has been opened.

1056
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,640
 (all laughing)

1057
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,680
 - Who could have done this?

1058
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,880
 - It feels like someone's got something to hide, doesn't it?

1059
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,720
 If they rock up at your sleepover and they say,

1060
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,400
 "I've brought my own lock, don't mind me."

1061
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,760
 What are you doing in there?

1062
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,600
 What are you doing in there?

1063
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,200
 It's so paranoid about.

1064
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,920
 - Is the lock going on the sleeping bag here?

1065
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:25,960
 - Wait, why would it, what?

1066
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,720
 - Sorry, you just said someone turns up at your sleepover

1067
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:28,560
 and they brought their own lock.

1068
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,800
 - 'Cause I'm a sleepover,

1069
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,140
 everyone gets their own rooms.

1070
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:33,600
 (all laughing)

1071
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,520
 - We're all gonna go to bed in our separate rooms now.

1072
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,360
 - Oh, we're all going to a different wing.

1073
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,800
 - Yeah, for the scary stories.

1074
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,520
 Yes, perfect, yeah.

1075
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:43,100
 (upbeat music)

1076
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:47,800
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show

1077
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,360
 and that is Andy.

1078
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,600
 - My fact is that in Edwardian times,

1079
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:54,200
 you could order a barrel of seawater

1080
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,280
 to be delivered to your inland home

1081
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,200
 so you could keep on enjoying the health benefits

1082
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,120
 of your holiday after it ended.

1083
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,800
 - Now, do you have to get some sailors

1084
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,920
 to come from their boats?

1085
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:07,320
 - Oh no, a cracker for my nice fresh barrel of seawater

1086
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,160
 to have my bath.

1087
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,760
 Oh, it's full of jacktars.

1088
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,960
 - Yes, was it to have your bath or was it to drink?

1089
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,280
 Or was it to massage yourself with?

1090
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,880
 - A bit of everything, a bit of everything.

1091
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,680
 There's nothing that seawater couldn't do.

1092
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,720
 - Right.

1093
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,280
 - And this is from a great, it's from a sub-stack

1094
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,480
 I subscribe to called "Reading On Trains"

1095
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,600
 by Andrew Martin, which is all about trains.

1096
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:29,160
 And it's mostly about trains that I got interested in this.

1097
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,520
 - This isn't about trains though, is it?

1098
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,480
 - No, it's about seawater.

1099
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:34,200
 But seawater delivered by the Great Eastern Railway.

1100
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,040
 - Oh my God.

1101
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,640
 - So this was in Edwardian times,

1102
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,640
 so in the early 20th century,

1103
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,560
 you would get a barrel of seawater

1104
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:44,120
 from Lowestoft to Liverpool Street

1105
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:48,080
 and they would pump it into these massive wagons at one end

1106
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,200
 and then they decant it.

1107
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,480
 They have a little spigot at the other end,

1108
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,160
 they just decant it into a barrel

1109
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,440
 and then they send the barrels all around everywhere.

1110
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,000
 And you would order a massive barrel of seawater

1111
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,480
 and have a bath in the sea in your house.

1112
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,080
 - Were there any poor kids who said,

1113
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,200
 "Can we go on a beach holiday this year, Mum?"

1114
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,920
 And they're like, "I'll do you, almost as good."

1115
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:06,960
 - We have the sea at home.

1116
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:07,800
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1117
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,720
 It was basically that.

1118
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,520
 And this was all because people were obsessed with seawater

1119
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,680
 being a really good thing for your health.

1120
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:15,000
 - Yeah, this is a, so I now live in Margate

1121
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,480
 and there's still a ginormous hospital there

1122
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,760
 which was built as a royal bathing house,

1123
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:23,280
 basically using sea therapy as a way of fixing people.

1124
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,600
 - But ironically, at the moment,

1125
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,680
 the trains don't really go from here to Margate,

1126
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:27,520
 do they, Dad?

1127
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,360
 - Yes.

1128
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,360
 - That's why you're half an hour late this afternoon.

1129
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,200
 - It's all right, 'cause once you get there,

1130
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,440
 the sea's full of poo anyway.

1131
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,800
 So it's fine, I know.

1132
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,240
 This is the problem with sea these days.

1133
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,360
 But it was, this is a big deal

1134
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:40,160
 that kind of actually weirdly transformed

1135
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,680
 the way that we visit beaches now

1136
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,760
 because it was like a paupers thing

1137
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,720
 and it was never part of holidays.

1138
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:48,840
 And then suddenly when this hydrotherapy thing came in,

1139
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,360
 suddenly everyone was going back to the beach

1140
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,200
 and that's kind of created.

1141
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,680
 - And that actually started much earlier, didn't it?

1142
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:53,520
 Like 1750s, I think.

1143
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,560
 - Like 1700s, yeah, exactly.

1144
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,400
 - It's one doctor.

1145
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,520
 - It was a guy called Richard Russell.

1146
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:01,480
 And he's basically responsible for Brighton existing.

1147
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:04,000
 He thought that seawater was great for you,

1148
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,560
 much better than like getting the water from Bath

1149
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:09,440
 or from an inland spa or Bugston or something.

1150
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,760
 And he got a big old house in Brighton,

1151
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,320
 the biggest house at the time,

1152
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,000
 because Brighton wasn't really a thing.

1153
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,720
 And he got a lot of people there

1154
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,800
 and he cured them supposedly.

1155
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:19,640
 - Of anything as well.

1156
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,720
 It was the usual cures in the olden days.

1157
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:24,280
 You could cure scurvy or jaundice or TB,

1158
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:28,480
 a lot of TB cured by just drinking or bathing in.

1159
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,080
 I think Richard Russell advised his patients

1160
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,840
 to drink seawater and he said that a pint of it

1161
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:36,560
 was sufficient to give three or four sharp stools,

1162
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,200
 which I think he meant as a good thing.

1163
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,560
 - Yeah, you don't want it sharp, do you?

1164
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,920
 - It seems not today,

1165
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,960
 but maybe it was sought after in those days.

1166
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:48,000
 - You diluted it with milk or honey, either way.

1167
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,920
 I mean, I did read that he variously included

1168
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,800
 a few extra things, like he sprinkled in some,

1169
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,280
 I read Crab's Eyes,

1170
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,520
 which I can't believe is a cost effective thing,

1171
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,800
 'cause seawater is quite cheap to get.

1172
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,160
 Crab's Eyes feels like quite labor intensive.

1173
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,080
 - Yeah, it feels like they've got a little bit of grit

1174
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,400
 in the bottom of the seawater.

1175
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,400
 So I know that's Crab's Eyes.

1176
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,640
 - Is it because basically medicine wasn't very good

1177
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:11,280
 at the time and seawater is at least relatively benign?

1178
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,120
 Is that it?

1179
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,320
 - No, who knows. - Is it fresh air?

1180
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,280
 - They just didn't know about evidence-based medicine,

1181
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,120
 did they?

1182
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,360
 Oh, but I imagine the fresh air.

1183
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,120
 - I think people just sometimes get better.

1184
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,040
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1185
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,600
 - Like from some things, sometimes people will say,

1186
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,680
 "Oh, you've got tuberculosis

1187
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:27,240
 "and actually you've got a terrible, awful cough."

1188
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,080
 - Right.

1189
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:28,920
 - And eventually it gets a bit better

1190
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,280
 and you're like, "Oh, I'm cured of my TB."

1191
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:33,760
 But they didn't do an actual test to see if you had TB.

1192
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,960
 - Right, I see that, yeah.

1193
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,360
 - This guy anyway, he sold his house to George III

1194
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,720
 and then George III invited the Prince of Wales

1195
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:43,040
 to visit him, the big Prince Regent.

1196
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,560
 It was originally called the Bright Helmston

1197
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,480
 and they decided to change its name to Brighton

1198
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,520
 because the royals had started going there.

1199
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,560
 So it literally was him that started Brighton.

1200
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,640
 Brighton wasn't a thing before that.

1201
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,760
 - Yeah, Bright Helmston is such a cool name.

1202
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,600
 - When I look at it,

1203
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:59,160
 I bet the locals pronounced it Brighton anyway.

1204
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,000
 - Brick Helmston.

1205
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,320
 - You know, it's one of those English names.

1206
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,680
 - I did read that it was from about the 1600s.

1207
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,520
 Most people had been calling it Brighton.

1208
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:09,160
 But it was still officially Brick Helmston until about 1810,

1209
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:11,040
 I think, which is back in the period you're talking about.

1210
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,560
 - This was the same with Margate.

1211
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:17,080
 So in 1791, this big hospital was called Margate Infirmary

1212
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:20,080
 for the relief of the poor whose diseases require sea bathing.

1213
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,440
 But then it got a royal patronage

1214
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,640
 and became the royal sea bathing infirmary.

1215
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:26,840
 And if you go down to Margate these days,

1216
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,920
 most of the houses have very randomly

1217
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:31,160
 just a little porch on the first floor.

1218
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:34,360
 And the idea was you would push out your elderly relative

1219
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,920
 onto the balcony of your house

1220
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,360
 and you just leave them outside.

1221
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,560
 And then you'd come and get them after hours and hours

1222
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:41,840
 just to see how it affected there.

1223
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,960
 So you see them all over these random balconies

1224
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,000
 on those houses there. - That's cool.

1225
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:45,840
 - Fresh air is good for you.

1226
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,120
 And cold water is good for you, right?

1227
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:49,240
 - A lot of things about going to the beach are very good too.

1228
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,040
 You get away from the stresses of daily life,

1229
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,520
 the pollution of London.

1230
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,000
 - But being dunked, being dunked in cold water

1231
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,080
 is definitely good for your health.

1232
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,240
 It sort of triggers all sorts of adrenaline response.

1233
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:58,080
 - It depends.

1234
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,440
 If you dunk pneumonia, it's not really that good for you.

1235
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,360
 - I don't think there's a huge, I mean, I'm a huge fan,

1236
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,680
 as you know, big cold water bather.

1237
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,640
 But I don't think there's a huge amount of scientific studies

1238
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,320
 that have been done that definitively prove that.

1239
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,360
 - There are a few things like,

1240
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:12,920
 because you have this weird sort of reflex, don't you?

1241
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,640
 Like a diving reflex.

1242
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,400
 So I think it's something to do with your vagus nerve.

1243
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,240
 - Yeah.

1244
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,320
 And that was the idea at the time

1245
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:21,480
 that it shocks you out of something.

1246
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,960
 So this is why women were dipped, right?

1247
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:26,360
 And dippers were celebrities.

1248
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,200
 And they'd be-

1249
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,240
 - Again, there were fewer famous people at the time.

1250
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:31,040
 This is a Robert Dudley problem.

1251
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,880
 - It was Robert Dudley and the dippers.

1252
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,680
 - Dudley and the dippers is a great 1960s party.

1253
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:38,400
 - Yeah, and the dippers were great.

1254
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,440
 So they were men and women.

1255
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,720
 And if you were a male bather who'd gone to Brighton,

1256
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,320
 and often you'd be someone who couldn't swim

1257
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,560
 'cause most people couldn't,

1258
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:45,760
 then you'd need a dipper.

1259
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,200
 And as a man, you'd have a male dipper.

1260
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,920
 As a woman, you'd have a female dipper.

1261
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:51,560
 But these were beefy, muscly people.

1262
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:54,240
 I think one of the most famous ones was Martha Gunn

1263
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:58,720
 in Brighton, who did it from 1750 to the early 1800s.

1264
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,960
 And the idea was that you have your client.

1265
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,680
 - Wow, she would have been quite old by then.

1266
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:05,200
 - Yeah, she did it from, you know, 20 to 80 or whatever.

1267
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,040
 - She lived until she was 90.

1268
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,960
 She just was constantly dunking

1269
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,320
 and just standing in the water all the time.

1270
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,200
 Rain or shine?

1271
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:13,040
 - Yeah.

1272
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,800
 - Martha had very wrinkly toes.

1273
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,120
 - Oh!

1274
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:18,160
 - She's 90-year-olds to start off with.

1275
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,920
 And then she's in the water all day.

1276
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:20,760
 - You wouldn't be able to tell

1277
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:23,760
 where it was natural wrinkle versus ocean wrinkle.

1278
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,320
 - Yeah.

1279
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:27,200
 - But you did a lot more than just dunk, of course.

1280
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,520
 You tailored your treatment to your client.

1281
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,640
 So if Dan came to me and was like, "I want to be dunked,"

1282
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:33,400
 I'd say, "Why? What's wrong with you?"

1283
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,080
 I'd work out how long you want to be dunked for,

1284
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:38,920
 how many times, how deep, which bit of seawater,

1285
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:40,440
 whether you want to massage with it.

1286
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:42,120
 - We all know he wants to be dunked in lockdown

1287
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:43,200
 until he's found the monster.

1288
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,200
 (all laughing)

1289
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,760
 - Now seawater, though, it's going to do nothing.

1290
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:51,760
 There's a cool invention that came off the back of people

1291
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:55,640
 wanting to bring the sea to them, as Andy was mentioning.

1292
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:57,640
 You could use normal water as well for this,

1293
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:00,640
 but there was an item that was invented in the 1890s

1294
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:03,000
 called the rocking bathtub.

1295
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,520
 And what it was is it's a bathtub,

1296
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:09,160
 which is shaped in a sort of like crescent moon sort of shape.

1297
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:11,640
 So like a, as if like a rocking chair.

1298
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,440
 And you would sit inside,

1299
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,200
 you would put three barrels of water inside with you,

1300
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,280
 and then you would start rocking back and forth.

1301
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,960
 - You'd add to the water out of the barrels?

1302
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,160
 - No, into your bath.

1303
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,160
 - Right, so you pour the water out of the bath.

1304
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,760
 - Sorry, yeah, you don't hug the barrels, yeah.

1305
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,120
 It's not Donkey Kong.

1306
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:28,800
 (all laughing)

1307
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,880
 So the idea was to create the ocean,

1308
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:33,840
 to the waves, to make it feel as if you were in the ocean.

1309
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:35,600
 So not only do you have your saltwater with you,

1310
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,480
 you have the vibe of an ocean side.

1311
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:38,320
 - I quite like doing that.

1312
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:39,960
 I think that's good to do in the bath anyway.

1313
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:41,520
 It's just my bath is not a rocker.

1314
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:42,360
 Oh my God.

1315
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:45,040
 - Whose mom has to come in and clear up the bathroom afterwards?

1316
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,880
 - Well, it supposedly didn't leak, but it did.

1317
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:50,200
 But supposedly it didn't, but it absolutely didn't.

1318
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,720
 - I just am these bathrooms.

1319
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:53,480
 After every time he has a bath,

1320
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:55,160
 water all over the floor, isn't there?

1321
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:56,400
 - It's pretty bad.

1322
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,280
 Lot of rubber ducks,

1323
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:00,360
 a lot of accurate bottles of World War II battleships.

1324
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:02,360
 It's true about the place.

1325
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:03,800
 Do you know it's still so handy?

1326
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:06,600
 I know that sometimes you read these things

1327
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:09,440
 and you think you want to have that in your own home.

1328
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,280
 That's often how you are.

1329
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:13,920
 You can get seawater delivered to your house still to this day.

1330
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,440
 Yeah, I found a place.

1331
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,440
 If you want the details, I'll forward them on.

1332
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:21,440
 You can get 20 litres sent to your house for 19 pounds.

1333
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:26,480
 And it's seawater that's sourced off the Dorset coastline

1334
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,240
 from a deep water supply.

1335
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:31,520
 And so this is largely for aquariums and so on.

1336
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:32,360
 - Oh.

1337
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:33,200
 (laughing)

1338
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:34,040
 - Have water delivered to them.

1339
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:35,000
 - I'm still interested.

1340
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:35,840
 (laughing)

1341
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:36,680
 - It's such a shame,

1342
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:37,960
 'cause I literally just watched Andy write down

1343
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:39,520
 all those details he gave him.

1344
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,160
 And now I have to get a fish.

1345
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:43,720
 - I've written 20 litres, 90 pounds in sourced Dorset.

1346
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:44,560
 - It sounds great.

1347
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:45,800
 - Yeah, but yeah, it happens.

1348
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:48,560
 - Deep seawater I think is like a trendy thing

1349
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,160
 that's supposed to be good for you, right?

1350
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:53,120
 'Cause the minerals go down to the very deep part

1351
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:56,400
 of the water and all the carbon goes down there

1352
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:57,600
 and it can't really get anywhere out.

1353
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:59,920
 So the minerals in there are really, really awesome,

1354
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,600
 apparently, and it's supposed to be good for you.

1355
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:05,000
 I think like some sports people use it to rehydrate

1356
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,560
 'cause it's supposed to have more chemicals in it.

1357
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:07,400
 - Right.

1358
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:09,360
 - Yeah, is there any healthier than the rest of us?

1359
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:11,640
 (laughing)

1360
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:12,480
 - No, I've heard that.

1361
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:13,320
 I think that's plausible.

1362
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:14,880
 And also, but shallow seawater genuinely,

1363
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,200
 there is a problem in the UK with lots of--

1364
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:17,040
 - Yeah, it's terrible.

1365
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,120
 - It's sewage and the--

1366
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:20,440
 - Yeah, but you, I mean, you would fish the turds out

1367
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:21,760
 when you, before you drink it.

1368
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:22,800
 - And there's our slogan.

1369
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,120
 - We fish the turds out.

1370
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:27,160
 (laughing)

1371
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:28,200
 - May contain turds.

1372
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:30,240
 (laughing)

1373
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,800
 - Prepared in a facility which contains turds.

1374
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,600
 (laughing)

1375
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,720
 We've made our best efforts, yeah.

1376
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:39,000
 - I found some cool waters that exist out there.

1377
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,280
 Melted water.

1378
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:41,880
 Would you drink melted water?

1379
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:44,680
 - Uh, so melted, so it was frozen?

1380
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:48,320
 - I've had like water that comes from icebergs.

1381
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:50,440
 - Yeah, so this is Lithuania, they make,

1382
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:53,000
 but what's interesting is they grow and create the iceberg

1383
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,040
 and then they melt them.

1384
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:56,600
 So it's not natural icebergs.

1385
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:59,640
 And then they put that melted ice into a bottle.

1386
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:01,600
 And so yeah, apparently it tastes like puddle water,

1387
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:04,880
 but it won the Lithuanian product of the year 2013.

1388
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:05,840
 It won gold for that.

1389
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:07,680
 - They don't have a lot going on in Lithuania, do they?

1390
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:08,520
 - No, it must have been a thin year.

1391
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:09,360
 - That's winning.

1392
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:10,200
 (laughing)

1393
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:11,600
 - In thin year in Lithuania, yeah.

1394
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:12,440
 - That's very funny.

1395
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:15,240
 - Also, interestingly mentioned just a few minutes ago,

1396
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:17,880
 Loch Nesswater is now bottled.

1397
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:20,080
 It's taken, it's put through filtration systems

1398
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:21,400
 and they sell it.

1399
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:25,920
 For example, the AIG Women's Open Golf Championship in 2024.

1400
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,160
 It was the official sponsor.

1401
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:30,920
 So all of their players were drinking Loch Nesswater.

1402
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:33,080
 - Okay, now I wasn't interested in that

1403
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:34,880
 until the very end, now I am.

1404
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:35,920
 (laughing)

1405
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:38,320
 Finally the crossover of interest with you and Dan.

1406
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:39,560
 (laughing)

1407
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:41,000
 It's a liver.

1408
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,200
 - Yeah, the most famous person who would have done

1409
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:46,560
 the sea bathing thing down in Margate is T.S. Eliot.

1410
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:47,560
 - Really?

1411
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:49,240
 - Yeah, T.S. Eliot came down and he did it.

1412
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:52,080
 And he took time off from his bank job.

1413
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:53,800
 He moved down there and his wife came with him.

1414
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:56,160
 And that's where he started properly writing

1415
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:57,560
 the Wasteland again.

1416
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:58,400
 And--

1417
00:47:58,400 --> 00:47:59,680
 - Is that based on Margate?

1418
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:02,320
 (laughing)

1419
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:04,720
 - Yeah, my house gets a shout out, it's quite cool.

1420
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:05,560
 (laughing)

1421
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:06,760
 - Yeah, and so in the Wasteland,

1422
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:09,400
 there's only one moment where you see through the eyes

1423
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:12,320
 of T.S. Eliot, as in he's sitting in a spot looking up

1424
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:14,320
 and that's by a bus stop down on Margate Beach

1425
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:16,440
 as he was there using the sea air to recover.

1426
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:17,360
 - Has it got a plaque?

1427
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:19,760
 - It did, and that's down now, unfortunately.

1428
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:21,660
 And what's even more annoying for T.S. Eliot,

1429
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:24,480
 we did a great fact that his name is an anagram of toilets.

1430
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:27,000
 It is literally right next to the public toilets.

1431
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:27,840
 So--

1432
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:29,000
 - People see the plaque saying T.S. Eliot,

1433
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,600
 they just think it's a massive typo.

1434
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,880
 (laughing)

1435
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:36,840
 - No, right next to his plaque is in block words, toilets.

1436
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:38,440
 - They put underneath in brackets, Wasteland,

1437
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:39,600
 but that didn't help anyone.

1438
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,440
 (laughing)

1439
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:44,020
 (upbeat music)

1440
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:48,120
 - Okay, that's it, that is all of our facts.

1441
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:49,600
