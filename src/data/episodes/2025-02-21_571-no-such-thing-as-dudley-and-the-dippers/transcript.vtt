00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.000
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.760
 a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Hoburn.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:20.880
 My name is Dan Schreiber,

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.800
 I'm sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.880
 Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.200
 Once again, we have gathered around the microphones with

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.880
 our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.160
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.640
 Starting with fact number one, that is Anna.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.800
 My fact this week is that ancient Rome had a secret name,

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.160
 and no one knows what it was to this very day.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.840
 To this day.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.760
 To this very day.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.080
 It's very cool.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.960
 It is very cool.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.480
 It also, when you're looking into it,

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.400
 it also seems like did they?

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.240
 Was there definitely a secret name?

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.480
 Why do you think they're all making it up?

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.840
 It seems like it might have been something that was written by

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.560
 historians a bit later.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:00.720
 No, no, it was written at the time.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.280
 It was so, there's a bunch of ancient sources that claim it

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.800
 from about the first century onwards.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.520
 So it's Plinian Plutarch of the first, but they quote.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.920
 Paulini, she's quoting Paulini.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:11.760
 Yeah, yeah.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.360
 It was about six or seven different writers throughout

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.080
 the ancient Roman period saying this was a thing with

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.880
 like varying different accounts of what exactly it was.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.720
 But they mostly said it's a name that only very few people know,

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.560
 like just really extreme dignitaries,

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.040
 with the queen and her corgis basically.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.200
 And then even though they know it,

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.280
 they're not allowed to say it, even in special ceremonies.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.680
 A couple of the writers said,

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.200
 "Sometimes in ceremonies they say the name, but no, there was..."

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.440
 What do you reckon it was?

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.440
 There's a few ideas, right?

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.160
 There are some ideas which are bullshit.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.480
 Amor.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.120
 Amor is the main one, first mentioned in the sixth century.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.680
 An anagram of Rome.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.080
 Indeed, just Rome backwards.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.920
 The paladrome.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.360
 And they call the city of love, don't they?

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.760
 That is Paris, famously.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.960
 Yes, Syrap I call it.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.520
 Yeah, there is that theory which is from a scholar called

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.440
 John the Lydian in the sixth century who said,

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.240
 just confidently, it was called Amor.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.720
 That was a secret name.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.960
 We don't seem to have evidence for that.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.600
 And why?

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.760
 For protection, I think so.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.760
 There's also a lot of stuff alongside it saying

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.800
 there was a secret goddess who protected Rome.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.080
 And the reason you can't say the goddess's name

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.200
 is that then your enemies will know her name

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.080
 and then they can use her and they can call upon her

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.320
 and say, help me and stress.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.800
 She would defect was the idea, right?

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:29.800
 She defect, yeah.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:30.680
 And go with the enemy.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.240
 So that's quite a common thing, I think, with gods, right?

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.120
 It's like if you know their name,

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.960
 then you can tell them what to do kind of thing.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.560
 I think they happen in Egypt quite a lot.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.760
 Like in the Book of the Dead, for instance,

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.400
 when you go to the underworld, you have to pass through these gates.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.040
 But the only way you can pass through is if you name the gods,

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.680
 because you name them and when you've got the name,

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.360
 they have to do whatever you tell them.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.640
 Is that, I mean, I'm hearing Rumpelstiltskin big time here.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:55.640
 Oh, yes.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.520
 It's basically the same story, isn't it?

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:58.520
 Yeah.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.640
 Except he's going to, what is it, he's going to marry you

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.840
 if you don't know his name, he'll marry you,

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.080
 which is a bigger, is a more immediate threat.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.000
 Yeah.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.560
 There is a lot of people who've come up with ideas about this.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:15.160
 So the Roma Amour idea, there was an author called Dolores Prato.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.760
 And she said that one reason for saying

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.640
 that this could be the case is a lot of early Romans

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.720
 used to read and write from right to left.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.120
 So they were very good at knowing...

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.960
 Palantroes.

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:28.520
 Palantroes, basically.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.880
 Wait, did they, why did they read and write from right as in...

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.120
 Early Romans, according to Dolores Prato.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.000
 Maybe Arabic influences, I don't know.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.600
 Is that likely?

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.480
 In ancient, in the penitentiary.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.840
 I've never heard that.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.720
 I'll tell you one thing they did do is they used to write like

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.760
 secret squares, right, where you would write loads of five-letter words

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.040
 one after the other.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.040
 And then the last one would be the reverse of the first one.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.760
 And then if you read them up and down or left and right

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.680
 or on the diagonals, they all said the same thing.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.480
 Abracadabra is one of those words.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:00.920
 Well, you can write it in a triangle.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.200
 So it's like one of those.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.680
 And that's very powerful.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.000
 There's a famous thing called the Sattor Square.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.840
 Oh, yes.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.560
 Sattor something, opera something, rotors.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.080
 In fact, it sounds like Prato is a name that would fit

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.680
 in one of these mystical squares.

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:14.960
 Dolores Prato.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:15.800
 Yeah, and what is that?

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.560
 Prato must be an anagram that says gotcha, you know,

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.120
 something like that, obviously not that.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.120
 So there was someone supposedly who was executed for saying the name.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.560
 Yes, you know, it was terrible punishment if you said it.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.120
 Soranus, he was called.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.200
 Stop it.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.400
 Well, what, CJ?

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.280
 He was called Soranus.

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.280
 Now, people who listen to the podcast might remember Soranus.

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:40.360
 There was a guy called Soranus of Ephesus who came up with the idea

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.920
 of a midwife putting their fingers up your bum

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.840
 to orient the head of a baby before you give birth.

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.400
 But it's not that Soranus.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.080
 It's a different Soranus.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.960
 And this Soranus is according to Pliny.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:56.680
 He was the first writer to provide a table of contents in a book ever.

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.840
 Before that, if you wanted to look something up,

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.480
 you just had to read the whole thing.

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.000
 But he invented the idea of putting a table of contents.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.200
 And then he got into a barney with some of the bloke.

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.560
 And then he went to court and he said the name of Rome

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:09.720
 and he got executed.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:10.400
 Yeah, right.

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.080
 But the main thing is the contents thing.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.440
 Which is a bigger contribution to history?

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.200
 Which Soranus?

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.560
 Well, I think Soranus, the midwife.

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.680
 You say Soranus and I say Soranus.

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.720
 I think the midwife guy, because he's saved quite a lot of wives with that.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:25.680
 Does that work?

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:26.280
 It does work.

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.360
 Yeah, I didn't know that.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.160
 If you've got a breech baby and not like a full breech one,

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.000
 but if you're just trying to move the head in the right place.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.040
 But if you don't have a table of contents,

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:37.520
 how can you even read a midwifery book to learn that in the first place?

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.240
 Well, fairness, Anus will be right near the start of the book.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.440
 That's true.

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.080
 I wonder, you know, that thing of in ancient Rome,

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.400
 so many things would have been invented.

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.280
 So many amazing characters who've been lost through the footnotes of time.

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.880
 And do we have two Soranuses purely because their name is Soranus?

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:58.000
 You have so misunderstood classical historians, I don't know where to start.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.640
 There are a lot of these sort of mystery cults, weren't there?

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:05.760
 So this name of Rome was to be used in sacred rituals, you know?

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:07.320
 Maybe, according to Sun.

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:12.000
 Okay, well, if it's never used, then what are we all doing here?

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.400
 I mean, but there was a place called the Cave of Rome.

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:16.160
 Did you hear of this?

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.520
 No. This is great.

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:20.960
 This is buried deep under the ruins of the palace of the Emperor Augustus.

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:26.840
 It was full of mosaics and seashells, which is pretty cool.

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:30.720
 And this may, according to legend,

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.800
 this is where Rome itself came to be.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:37.640
 OK. I.E. where Romulus and Remus got suckled.

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.680
 They were found there by the wolf, the twins.

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.960
 I didn't know they were the sons of the God Mars.

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.160
 That gets glossed over a lot in the story.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.840
 Like, they were Nepo babies, basically.

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.720
 They were just random twin babies who were left and then found by all.

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.440
 I don't think they are in all stories, are they?

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.280
 OK, maybe not. They might be.

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.440
 But there were ceremonies there for hundreds of years,

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:57.120
 and that's the secret cave of Rome.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.240
 Do we know where it is?

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.600
 It's under the ruins of the palace of the Emperor Augustus,

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.160
 as I said, 30 seconds ago.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:03.480
 But it's a real thing.

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:04.640
 Yeah, it's real. Right.

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:09.800
 On these secretive cults, I think my favourite is Mithraism or Mithraism.

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:12.320
 The thing about secret cults is they were really secret,

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:14.520
 so no one was allowed to write anything down or say anything.

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:17.040
 So it was all just rumour about what happened there,

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:18.840
 based on what people said.

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:22.640
 But they did stuff like there was lots of archaeological sources

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:25.760
 of Mithraic temples, where there's people killing bulls.

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:27.040
 There's one in London.

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.600
 There's a Mithraium in London.

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:29.600
 Yes.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:31.520
 They found it when they were excavating.

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:32.640
 I can't remember what they were digging up.

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:34.000
 Yes, it's Rael or something.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.360
 I think it was near the Museum of London, weirdly, it was found.

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:39.000
 Yeah, and they reconstructed what it would have looked like.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.400
 And at the end, there's the classic image of Mithra slaughtering a bull.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:47.600
 That was the big image of him wearing a Phrygian cap and Anatolian trousers.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:48.880
 Oh, lovely. That was his...

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:49.840
 I can picture it now.

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:51.160
 That was his look.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:52.520
 I think Phrygian cap is what the Smurfs wear.

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:53.920
 Yeah, yeah, they do.

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:55.640
 And Anatolian trousers, I don't know what they are.

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:57.440
 They're just trousers from modern-day Turkey.

00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:59.560
 I imagined black pirate pants.

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:02.840
 I remember, yeah, like whirling dervish pants,

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:05.800
 so quite wide around the thighs and then tight around the knees.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:06.320
 Yes.

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:07.280
 It's like MC Hammer.

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:08.280
 Yes, exactly.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:09.280
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.360
 It was a primitive MC Hammer cult, basically.

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:12.680
 That's what he's based on.

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:15.680
 My favourite place in Rome is Amethraic Temple.

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:19.400
 It is by far the coolest site.

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:20.760
 Forget everything else, forget the Coliseum.

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:22.240
 About five minutes from the Coliseum,

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:23.720
 there's the Basilica of San Clement.

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:24.640
 Have you guys been to it?

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:26.760
 No, I think I might have been, maybe.

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:29.600
 It's an 11th-century church, you go in, 11th-century church.

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:34.360
 And there was a cleric who worked in the church in 1867,

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:35.760
 the friar who worked in the church,

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:38.560
 who just found that underneath it was hollow,

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:40.640
 and so they excavated underneath,

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:42.720
 and they found a fourth-century church,

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:44.920
 and now you can go descend down into that.

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:47.080
 So that's, you know, in the olden days, things were lower down

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:49.480
 because the ground hadn't accumulated on top of it yet.

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:50.480
 And that's incredible,

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.680
 and you're looking at fourth-century stuff, artwork preserved.

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:53.360
 Wow.

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:57.680
 And then, here it comes, a layer below they discover,

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:00.440
 not one, but two things, an ancient Roman house,

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:03.000
 which you can now wander through, deep underground,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.600
 and the Amethraic Temple,

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:06.640
 which you can sit in.

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:08.800
 It's the coolest thing ever,

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:11.440
 and you can sit there and pretend to be taking, you know,

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:13.160
 sermons from the bullkiller or...

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:14.480
 Wow, that's very cool.

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:15.160
 Yeah, that's awesome.

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:15.840
 That's really cool.

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.400
 We don't know much about these places

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.560
 because you weren't supposed to...

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:21.520
 You weren't supposed to go there if you weren't allowed,

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:23.120
 and you often didn't write about them, right?

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:25.120
 Yes, exactly, it was only for initiates.

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:26.600
 But there was one,

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:29.000
 there was a festival of the goddess of fertility

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.440
 who's called Bonadir.

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:33.720
 It was only women who were allowed to go,

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:35.960
 and since men were the people who write stuff down,

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:38.000
 we didn't really know anything about it.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.560
 But there was a huge scandal

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:44.000
 because a guy called Publius Claudius Pulcher, or Pulca,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.680
 he disguised himself as a woman in 62 BC

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:48.560
 and went to the festival,

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:50.360
 and when people found out about it,

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:53.640
 oh, my days, this is bad news, oh, boy.

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:57.680
 I think that story is in one of Cicero's speeches.

00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:00.920
 I think I've read the prosecution speech from that trial.

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:02.880
 I think it exists, wow.

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:05.520
 But the interesting thing is

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:09.760
 that he was prosecuted for incest.

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:10.600
 What?

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:13.920
 Claudius was one of the sort of chief gang dudes in ancient Rome,

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:17.360
 and he had a very, very attractive sister.

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:18.200
 And there was a big--

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.040
 That's no excuse, Andy.

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:21.040
 Absolutely not, but it was a big...

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:23.120
 Your honor, but your honor.

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:24.600
 Just look at her, your honor.

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:30.160
 Yeah, and that was one of his big rivalries.

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.480
 But can I say, for the listener,

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:33.960
 even though he was done for incest,

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:36.120
 he hadn't had sex with his sister.

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:37.480
 It was like a technical thing,

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:39.120
 because there was a thing about

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:41.640
 if you had sex with a Vestal Virgin,

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:43.480
 then that was counted as incest,

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:47.200
 because they were kind of the children of the city kind of thing

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.360
 who looked after the city and all that kind of stuff.

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:51.040
 And this was like an extension of this,

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:54.600
 because he defiled this cult of women.

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:56.480
 It counted technically as incest,

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:58.160
 even though none of them was related to him.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.240
 Hang on, why do we know his sister so well?

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:01.880
 He also had, in his speech,

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:03.600
 I'm pretty sure I remember Cicero says,

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:04.720
 "Look at the sister on him though."

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:07.720
 You know, he was very much implying that he had also,

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.640
 I think, slept with his actual sister.

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:12.320
 That was a sort of low trick from Cicero, it wasn't so...

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:14.360
 Is that, James, what you said is that unbiased history,

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:17.080
 or is that the defense lawyer's speech that you read,

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:18.120
 that you got those facts?

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:19.000
 I don't know.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.080
 Like, I got it from Wikipedia, I'll be honest.

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:23.960
 Now, I did read some of the...

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:25.280
 I read the Cicero thing.

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:26.560
 Like, I don't think it's biased.

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:27.760
 I think this is stuff that actually happened.

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:29.000
 No, that's just he got in trouble

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.560
 for invading the woman's space, as people shouldn't.

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:32.560
 But did he find out anything good?

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:33.400
 What were they doing?

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:35.480
 Were they all teaching how to insert tampons and stuff?

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:40.160
 They were all reading scary stories and kissing each other.

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:43.400
 Knew it! Knew it!

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:45.800
 Hey, can I tell you very quickly,

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:48.160
 this is not Ancient Rome, but it's Ancient China.

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:49.200
 It's a pretty astonishing thing.

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:50.920
 I was just looking into general secrets

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:53.400
 that we still don't know much about.

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:54.920
 For a good 3,000 years,

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:58.600
 there was a secret women's language called Nuxu,

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:01.480
 which is lady writing, basically.

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:03.640
 And it was for women who needed to pass on information

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:05.960
 to each other that they didn't want men to have any idea about.

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:07.480
 And they created an entire script.

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:11.120
 It's only in the 1980s that we even found out it existed.

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:14.080
 It lasted, yeah, for close to 3,000 years.

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:16.200
 So, the only thing I noticed is you guys found out it existed.

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:17.640
 We actually know...

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:19.760
 No, if you've ever watched ITV,

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:23.320
 the show Loose Women is actually broadcast in that language.

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:26.640
 And this language that women only speak is called New Shoes.

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:32.680
 Sex in the city is based on a lot of it's writing.

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:34.800
 Yeah, but it's amazing that it's all these years.

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:37.760
 And it's coming back, the last writers of it

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:39.600
 died a couple of decades ago,

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:42.000
 but they've worked it out and they're teaching it again,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.240
 and so it's becoming a language again.

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:44.400
 It's beautiful to look at.

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:46.920
 It's actually, as someone pointed out, very sexy to look at.

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:50.240
 If writing could be sexy, this is it, yeah.

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:53.200
 Have you guys heard of boob slang?

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:55.480
 This is not related to Nuxu, by the way.

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:58.920
 This is a modern thing. This is New Zealand we're in now.

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:01.720
 And what's an environment where you get a lot of slang?

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:04.200
 - Sailors. - Not far off.

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.440
 It's an enclosed space.

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:06.440
 - Workshop. - Prisons.

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:09.760
 - Prisons. - Oh, it's not far off.

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:12.440
 I just want to say, it's when he's sailor's listening.

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:15.080
 Yeah, we know what you did, and you're very lucky

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:18.240
 that you haven't been banged up yet, no.

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:20.280
 What are they going to do, James? They're at sea.

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:22.440
 I could just hear right now.

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:24.600
 Set a course for London.

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:26.080
 Right now, ships are turning.

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:27.800
 I just need to stay.

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:29.960
 I just need to stay in central Leicestershire,

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:31.560
 and I'll be fine.

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:32.080
 No boob.

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:33.960
 Grand Eugie and Camel!

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:43.280
 No boob slang is a New Zealand prison language.

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:45.760
 And it has 3,000 separate words.

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:48.400
 So obviously, let's get into it.

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:50.960
 What is boob?

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.440
 It's the name of the language.

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:54.120
 Yeah, well, boob slang is the language.

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:57.040
 - Oh, it's the boob. - It's the name of the person.

00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:58.360
 - It's prison. - It's prison.

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:00.360
 - We're in the boob. - We're in boob.

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:03.800
 So what's a boob story?

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:06.640
 - It's a story that you tell when you're in prison. - Prison story.

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:08.560
 Are they all hang-up?

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:11.160
 And that's how they all work.

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:14.760
 What are boob handcuffs?

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:16.840
 I said, has anyone eaten boob lunch today?

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:19.960
 What am I asking?

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:23.240
 I think boob story is how you ended up in the big house, basically.

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:24.840
 All right, what's a double yoka?

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:26.840
 Oh, a double yoka.

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:30.440
 - Is it two black eyes? - Is it a bit of great luck?

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:32.280
 It's just an idiot.

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:33.480
 A double yoka. I don't know why.

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:35.440
 I would think a double yoka would be brainier than the average.

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:37.040
 Is it like a yoko?

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:40.160
 But then the doubly as yokely as a yoko.

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:41.720
 It might be. It doesn't have an anonyme.

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:43.560
 Let's have one more. What's a good night kiss?

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:47.440
 Oh, it's one of those shower things that we don't know we should get into.

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:48.440
 Knockout punch.

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:53.560
 Get your hands off my boob boobs.

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:56.200
 Dan's right. It's a knockout punch.

00:14:56.200 --> 00:15:00.360
 So be very careful if you ask someone in prison to give you a good night kiss.

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:01.960
 Do you think you would?

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:02.720
 I don't know.

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:04.360
 I think it would make you feel happy, wouldn't it?

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:06.360
 I was reassuring you a bit.

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:08.040
 - To the guards. - Yeah, to the guards.

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:10.520
 - On night number one. - Excuse me?

00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:12.520
 My mummy always.

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:24.160
 OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is James.

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:27.960
 OK, my fact this week is that in 2010, Jaguar made a car

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:31.800
 that sounded like an actual Jaguar.

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:34.160
 Give us an idea of what that sounds like.

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:35.640
 Roar!

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:36.920
 - Yeah, OK. - It's very good.

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:39.880
 I had to do the hand gesture when I do that as well.

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:44.240
 I sort of think cars sound a bit like roaring animals.

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:47.800
 It was easier than making it sound like a laughing hyena, for instance.

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:50.400
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - You know, there wasn't much to tweak.

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:53.120
 But I did listen because you can hear a sample online.

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:55.880
 And it does start with the regular car sound.

00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:58.120
 And in your head, you're going, "Oh, that doesn't sound..."

00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:00.680
 And then out of nowhere, a Jaguar sound.

00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:01.600
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - And yeah.

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:03.520
 So it does, it is distinctly different.

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:07.360
 Yeah, so this was debuted at the 2010 Paris Motor Show.

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:11.320
 And it was the Jaguar CX75.

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:14.360
 And it was designed by a guy called Ian Callum.

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:17.720
 And then last year, he's started his own business now

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:19.360
 called Callum That Makes Cars.

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:21.720
 And he is making his own version,

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:24.040
 which is the original one was a concept one.

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:25.640
 I think it was in the movie Spectre.

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:28.840
 - Yeah. - But he's making ones that are street legal.

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:30.760
 So they've got the basic safety that you need

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:33.600
 and the right emissions and stuff like that.

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:37.040
 So if you want to give him a loaded dash, he'll make you one.

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:40.080
 - So Spectre, they were provided supposedly

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:42.280
 with about five of these cars, five to seven.

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:44.200
 No one actually knows how many of these have been produced

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:45.600
 as of yet because it's not on the road.

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:48.360
 - Another one of those secrets. - It's another secret, yeah.

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:50.560
 And if anyone watches it, it's a chase scene,

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:51.960
 Bond is in the nest in Marden,

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:55.720
 and he's being chased by someone who is in this Jaguar.

00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:58.280
 - Don't watch Spectre just for that chase though.

00:16:58.280 --> 00:16:59.480
 - Are there other reasons to watch it?

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:01.200
 - No. - Right, thank you.

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:02.200
 - Well, so if you're going to watch it,

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:03.880
 it should be just for that chase, it sounds like.

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:05.040
 - Oh yeah, that's a good point.

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:07.360
 - Can I just say one more thing about Ian Callum?

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:08.720
 - Oh yeah. - By the way,

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:10.280
 when he was 14 years old,

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:12.280
 he submitted a car design to Jaguar

00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:14.040
 in the hope of getting a job.

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:16.800
 And then later on, he went on to work for them.

00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:18.120
 - That's very cool. - Yeah.

00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:20.920
 - I just want to see that car that he designed,

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:24.520
 'cause I'm sure, I mean, he's one of the great car designers,

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:26.280
 but for 14 year old,

00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:28.480
 it's gonna look like Homer Simpson's car, isn't it?

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:29.800
 - Have you seen a cyber truck?

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:36.320
 - So on car sound, something that is added by manufacturers

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:38.920
 is the noise of car doors closing,

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:40.640
 or it's enhanced by manufacturers.

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:42.360
 - Shulk that, shulk.

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:45.200
 - Yeah, 'cause they think that,

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:47.160
 so cars used to be heavier,

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:48.200
 they made of different materials,

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:50.320
 so they made that really satisfying, deep clunk.

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:53.160
 And now car manufacturers don't actually need

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:55.080
 to use such heavy materials, they're a bit more efficient,

00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:57.600
 but they think if people hear a lighter, tinny clunk,

00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:59.160
 they'll think it's not as expensive.

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:00.720
 So then they alter the design

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:05.200
 to make the car door thudding clunk sound more,

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:06.560
 and they go to huge lengths.

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:07.800
 So what was it?

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:10.080
 Cadillac was saying that they listened to dozens

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:11.240
 and dozens of different cars

00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:12.400
 and make notes on their sounds,

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:13.880
 and then investigate all the cars

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:17.440
 to work out what's making that sound the way it sounds,

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:19.040
 and then combine them.

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:19.880
 - I don't know if you've heard that,

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:21.240
 cars are big business.

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:24.000
 - I've never seen one.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.880
 - What would you, to your car, sound sonically, if you could?

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:31.480
 - One of those boop boop boop horns.

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:32.320
 - A clown horn.

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:33.160
 - A clown horn, a clown horn.

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:34.000
 - Yeah, that's nice.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.880
 - I saw one grab in a boob in the '87s.

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:41.240
 - Yeah, I do have a favorite car sound now

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:42.600
 as a result of looking up this fact,

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:44.400
 which is pink noise.

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:46.280
 You heard a pink noise?

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:48.120
 This is a really fascinating innovation.

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:50.960
 So this noise is something you would only ever hear

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:53.200
 if you're about to get into a crash,

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:54.720
 and they're anticipating--

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:55.560
 - Who's it?

00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:56.400
 - Fuck!

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:59.800
 - Oh, you have heard it.

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:01.600
 Yeah, pink noise, it's really interesting.

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:03.920
 So one of the things that happens to a lot of people

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:05.200
 who get into big crashes,

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:06.840
 the sound is incredibly loud,

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:08.200
 and it damages their hearing.

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:09.840
 So when it detects a potential collision,

00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:12.360
 it puts out this sound, which is at 80 decibels,

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:14.880
 which basically prepares your ear

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:17.800
 for this even louder 165 decibels

00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:19.880
 that it's about to receive.

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:22.400
 And so it's a way of getting your ears into a place

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:23.680
 where they're not gonna get damaged.

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:24.520
 - What?

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:25.360
 - Yeah, it's really interesting.

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:26.960
 - 'Cause my car has a thing which beeps

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:29.040
 where it thinks I'm about to hit something,

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:30.680
 but that's not this, right?

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:31.840
 And it's going on all the time.

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:33.040
 I've actually had to rip it out.

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:34.800
 (laughing)

00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:36.800
 - That's incredible, and that protects your ears

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:39.600
 by warming your ears up to that.

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:41.640
 - I don't think your ears could be tricked

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:43.600
 out of mechanical deafness.

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:45.400
 - No, it's so, okay, this is what it says.

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:47.080
 It says, "It triggers muscles in the ear

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:50.480
 "to contract by reflex, automatically bracing the inner ear

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:54.000
 "and the ear drum for extremely loud noise by the crash."

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000
 - You've all heard of Hans Zimmer.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:56.840
 - Yeah, of course.

00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:57.880
 - Yeah, invented the Zimmer frame.

00:19:57.880 --> 00:19:58.720
 - That's right.

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:00.280
 (laughing)

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:01.800
 So we're talking Inception,

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:03.400
 Pirates of the Caribbean, The Lion King,

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:05.200
 Gladiator, Dunkirk, Dune.

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:06.640
 - He did the music for them.

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:07.480
 - He did the music.

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:08.760
 He did the music for all of these.

00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:10.240
 Dune too.

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:13.080
 - He also designed the sound of the BMW.

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:14.560
 So electric cars, they don't have

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:15.600
 an internal combustion engine.

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:18.080
 They do not need to sound like a car.

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:22.000
 But you can't just have them sounding like anything

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.720
 'cause if you're driving close to someone,

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:25.360
 they need to know there's a car passing by.

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:26.360
 - And they need to know it's a car.

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:28.800
 You can't do a horse noise or like a crazy bird noise.

00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:29.640
 - Exactly.

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:30.480
 - That's a temptation.

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:31.640
 - But Hans Zimmer was given the brief

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:33.400
 to define what was it,

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:37.920
 to compose the sound of e-mobility for BMW.

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:38.760
 (laughing)

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:39.920
 - And it's exactly the exact same.

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:41.880
 - It was really good.

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:44.400
 - And I listened to it and it just sounds like a car.

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:45.680
 - Well, that's the idea, then, Andy.

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:47.800
 - No, but it sounds too much like a car.

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:49.560
 As in if I was getting Zimmer on the case,

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:51.320
 I'd want something that revolutionized.

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:52.480
 - Yeah, but when you watched Dune,

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:54.800
 did you think, oh, that just sounds like a giant worm?

00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:56.000
 (laughing)

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.240
 Like he's just brilliant at making things

00:20:58.240 --> 00:20:59.480
 sound like they're supposed to sound.

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:00.920
 - Really, the worms sound like a BMW.

00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:02.240
 (laughing)

00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:03.080
 - It's very confusing.

00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:04.640
 Yeah, no, and they have an in-helps person,

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:06.080
 don't they, BMW, who is doing this.

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:07.840
 So Zimmer was sort of brought in to collaborate

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:09.880
 with a guy called Renzo Vitale,

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:11.960
 who's already there creating these sounds.

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:13.160
 'Cause as we know, and we've spoken about

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:14.560
 on this podcast before,

00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:17.760
 it is a time where the electric car is knocking out sounds

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:19.960
 and people are finding that incredibly scary.

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:22.920
 In fact, Jaguar are saying that they're gonna go

00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:25.520
 entirely electric by this year.

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:26.720
 And who knows if that's gonna happen,

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:28.480
 but that certainly was said a while ago.

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:30.320
 And so things like the British Library

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:32.680
 are starting to archive car sounds.

00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:34.000
 So the Jaguar car sound,

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.120
 which is a notably famous car sound

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:37.600
 amongst car connoisseurs,

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:39.280
 is now part of the audio library in there

00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:42.160
 because my children might never know that sound.

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:43.520
 - God, I can imagine the bore.

00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:45.640
 If you see someone listening to that audio

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:47.160
 in the British Library of all the things

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:48.400
 you could be looking at,

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:49.760
 you're not talking to them, are you?

00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:51.320
 - Imagine you see an attractive person

00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:52.600
 on the other side of the train

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:53.960
 and they've got their headphones in

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:55.400
 and you think they'll sidle over,

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:56.680
 "Hey, what are you listening to?"

00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:57.760
 (laughing)

00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:58.600
 - And the Zimmer.

00:21:58.600 --> 00:21:59.440
 - Oh, I love that.

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:02.480
 (laughing)

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:03.880
 - One thing where this is important

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:07.880
 is in formula E, which is like formula one,

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:09.680
 but for electric cars.

00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:11.760
 I read an article in the Washington Post

00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:12.920
 that was talking about this

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:14.520
 and they said that the cars were going round

00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:16.400
 and they sounded like electric toothbrushes.

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:17.240
 (laughing)

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:18.440
 Going round.

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:20.080
 Which when you think about the formula one,

00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:22.520
 it's like, "Round, round."

00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:23.720
 But then I read another article

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:25.920
 that said that the old F1 engines,

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:28.480
 they had a volume that would peak

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:30.920
 between 500 and 2500 hertz,

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:34.200
 which is about the same frequency as a human scream.

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:35.800
 And that's the reason people like it so much

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:37.640
 'cause it really puts you on edge.

00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:38.480
 - Right.

00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:39.320
 - You're watching the cars

00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:40.840
 but you're kind of on edge the whole time.

00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:42.440
 You're really excited about it

00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:44.000
 because your brain is thinking,

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.240
 "Is someone screaming there or something?"

00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:46.320
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:48.480
 The drivers, it's always their first time.

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:49.920
 And they're very, very scared.

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:51.800
 (screaming)

00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:53.560
 Even they got pink noise in there.

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:55.000
 But even petrol car noise is a fake.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:55.880
 That's what I find so weird.

00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:58.160
 Even these days, like the car door thing,

00:22:58.160 --> 00:22:59.720
 it's this thing skeuomorphism.

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:01.600
 We've talked, maybe we mentioned this before,

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:03.040
 it's where you have a new technology

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:05.040
 but you keep an element from the old technology

00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:06.200
 for aesthetic reasons.

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:08.200
 Like an app which has a picture of a bookshelf

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:10.440
 to trick you into thinking you're reading an ancient tome.

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:12.520
 You know, it's just that skeuomorphism.

00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:14.880
 And all these modern cars, even petrol ones,

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:16.840
 still, they play fake engine noises.

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:18.640
 Some of them literally have speakers in the cabin.

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:19.480
 - They do, wasn't it?

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:21.040
 I think a car journalist found this out.

00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:22.040
 It was in the Ford Mustang,

00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:25.120
 which has apparently an incredibly famous sound.

00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:26.560
 He broke his speakers or something,

00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:28.120
 or pulled a fuse that took his speaker out

00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:30.080
 and he was like, "Oh my God, the engine's gone off."

00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:31.680
 And it turns out that's just...

00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:32.520
 - It's great.

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:34.480
 I think so many sounds must be manufactured

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:36.080
 in a way that we don't realize.

00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:37.880
 It's like secret sounds everywhere.

00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:40.520
 Someone was telling me that they have an old mouse

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:43.240
 which when you click, you hear a noise.

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:45.520
 And apparently it's a little speaker in there

00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:46.640
 that is playing that.

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:47.760
 (laughing)

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:50.200
 Yeah, it's a little tiny speaker that when you click it,

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:51.400
 it's playing a sound.

00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:53.000
 It's not the click itself that's happening

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.920
 because people found it quite disorientating

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:58.240
 to have a mouse that wasn't clicking anymore.

00:23:58.240 --> 00:23:59.680
 And so they created a little...

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:01.640
 - It sounds so real. - What is real?

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:04.560
 - I have a little speaker that I keep in my trousers

00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:06.680
 'cause I can only do silent but deadly farts

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:08.520
 and it really puts people off.

00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:10.400
 So whenever I know one's coming,

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:12.280
 I press the button and it makes them nice.

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:13.800
 - Wow, yeah.

00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:14.640
 Oh, that's good.

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:15.480
 Is it Bose?

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:18.840
 'Cause yours are very basic, basic, yeah.

00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:21.420
 (upbeat music)

00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:26.040
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three

00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:27.360
 and that is my fact.

00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:30.440
 My fact this week is that Queen Elizabeth I

00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:33.320
 never visited Shakespeare's Globe.

00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:36.320
 However, she did visit a venue down the road

00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:38.400
 to watch bears fighting a dog and monkey.

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:41.960
 - Oh, it does depend on the Shakespeare play, I would say.

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:43.160
 - Right, yeah. - Some Shakespeare plays,

00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:44.800
 way better than a dog fighting a monkey.

00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:45.720
 (laughing)

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:48.240
 Others, yeah.

00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:49.400
 I read this, by the way,

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:51.960
 in a book called "London A Travel Guide Through Time"

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:53.520
 by Dr. Matthew Green.

00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:56.160
 I love this book and my wife actually

00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:57.320
 was the editor on the book.

00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:58.680
 And it's actually--

00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:00.880
 - Ah, that is this cool.

00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:01.960
 - Is this Spond?

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:04.000
 It's like eight, 10 years old now, this book.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.760
 - She's still looking back. - She's doing Worldies.

00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:08.680
 (laughing)

00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:09.760
 - Anyway, if you could all buy it

00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:12.080
 with three children to feed.

00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:15.320
 No, it's a fantastic book where Matthew Green takes

00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:17.080
 the reader as if they were a time traveler

00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:18.680
 through different periods of London.

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:21.880
 The first one you start in is walking along the South Bank

00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:24.000
 and you're heading towards Shakespeare's Globe.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.200
 But he makes the point that, surprisingly,

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:29.960
 Queen Elizabeth I never went to the Globe,

00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:33.040
 but she did go to a venue that was very near to it

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:34.640
 to watch this extraordinary thing

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:37.320
 where bears would be brought into an arena

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:40.160
 and they would have dogs that would let loose on them

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:42.760
 and they would just fight until either it looked like

00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:45.080
 the dogs have had way too much and were gonna die

00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:46.480
 or that the bear looked a bit injured

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:49.320
 because these bears were kind of like professional wrestlers.

00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:51.000
 They were famous in their day.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.400
 People knew their names.

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:54.800
 One's even named in a Shakespeare play itself.

00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:56.800
 So this is a big deal.

00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:57.960
 So yeah, it's a-

00:25:57.960 --> 00:25:59.360
 - Which is the famous one, can you remember?

00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:00.200
 - Yeah, it's-

00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:01.280
 - He was called "Team on a Bathance."

00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:04.160
 - I think he was called "Sackerson," I believe.

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:05.000
 - Oh.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.520
 - He was a real celebrity bear.

00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:07.840
 - Yeah, there was Ned Whitting.

00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:09.080
 There was Harry Hunks.

00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:10.640
 There was Blind Bess.

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:13.160
 And then "Sackerson," yeah, in "The Merry Wives of Windsor."

00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:14.000
 - Okay.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.600
 - And yeah, it's literally the worst play.

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:17.280
 The worst of Shakespeare's plays, arguably,

00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:18.880
 maybe the worst of all plays ever written.

00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:19.720
 It's really bad.

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:21.680
 So did they throw "Sackerson" in

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:23.800
 just to sort of boost up its interest?

00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:24.640
 - I have some ratings.

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:27.640
 - There's a theory that Shakespeare wrote it in nine days.

00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:29.600
 It was a very, very rushed job play.

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:30.440
 - Right.

00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:31.600
 - They had to quickly come up with something.

00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:33.560
 And he just sort of said, "I'm gonna pull this out."

00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:34.480
 - "I'll chuck a bear in there.

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:35.480
 People will rock up."

00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:36.640
 And it was a fair fight.

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:39.160
 I think he said that it was bears fighting a dog and a monkey,

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:41.280
 but I think they would usually give him a few dogs.

00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:43.120
 - Yeah, yeah, a bunch of dogs, sometimes the monkey.

00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:44.760
 The monkey was usually on horseback.

00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:45.600
 Like it was-

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:46.760
 - So it has an advantage there, doesn't it?

00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:47.600
 - Yeah.

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:48.440
 - Wait, who's fighting who?

00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:49.280
 - The monkey's on a horse.

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:50.120
 Who's the monkey on a horse fighting?

00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:51.160
 - No, I think in that case,

00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:53.040
 I think the monkey is just riding around on a horse

00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:54.360
 as a bit of entertainment.

00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:56.280
 - Oh, wait, so the bears didn't fight the monkey?

00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:57.960
 - I think monkeys did fight bears.

00:26:57.960 --> 00:26:59.320
 - But I don't think you could incentivize a bear

00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:00.840
 to repeatedly attack a horse, can you?

00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:02.240
 - Who's the horse fighting?

00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:03.440
 The horse is just having a good time.

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:04.280
 - Yeah.

00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:05.120
 - It's just a day out.

00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:05.960
 - Horse is confused.

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:06.800
 It's just hanging out.

00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:08.280
 Well, it was confusing, wasn't it?

00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:10.000
 Because this is gruesome entertainment.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000
 Yet when you read people writing about it,

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.400
 it was like a great day out.

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:15.600
 - I read a lot of articles about it for this.

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:17.000
 One thing I really liked about it

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.240
 is they sometimes did it in pubs.

00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:22.240
 And they do seem to have had bear gardens,

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:24.600
 which is where they did the fighting.

00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:25.440
 Which is just like--

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:27.000
 - Is that where we get bear garden?

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.560
 - Well, I think.

00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:30.840
 But yeah, lots of play.

00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:31.680
 There's a trolling.

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:33.480
 I think the way we live now has the bear garden

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:35.840
 as the gentleman's club they go to.

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:37.960
 The name stayed on and bear garden was anywhere

00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:38.800
 the bears for.

00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:40.720
 - And there is a road called bear garden now.

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:41.560
 - Yes.

00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:44.160
 - And Bear Lane, yeah, near the spots where this happened.

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:45.600
 - It's one of those sports which makes you think,

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:47.320
 oh, people in the past would just,

00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:48.400
 I owe nothing to them.

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:50.680
 I don't care about their civilization.

00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:54.240
 I don't think their values are at all interesting to me.

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:57.480
 - Well, let's not get into the cultural relativism.

00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:59.120
 Is it Bellatoturf, Foxes and Shreds?

00:27:59.120 --> 00:27:59.960
 Who knows?

00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:00.800
 Who are we to judge?

00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:01.800
 - Yeah, like you do every day.

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:02.640
 - I tell you that--

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:04.840
 - Andy, I've seen you on the hunt.

00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:10.840
 - Yeah, but it's so, it's really grim.

00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:12.280
 But the Puritans didn't like it.

00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:14.320
 - They're boars though, weren't they?

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:15.520
 - The Puritans carried out plenty of it.

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:17.760
 They tried some things in other spaces and times.

00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:19.080
 - Sorry, who were the boars fighting?

00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:21.160
 (laughing)

00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:22.080
 - The Puritans banned it.

00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:23.360
 I think part of their objection was

00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:24.360
 that it happened on Sundays.

00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:27.040
 Not that it's a bit grim.

00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:29.840
 - One of these arenas collapsed on the South Bank.

00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:31.400
 And the Puritans all said that this was

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:34.760
 because God was displeasured about what was going on.

00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:35.600
 - They would say that.

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:36.680
 - But actually, they weren't that bothered

00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:37.920
 about bears getting hurt.

00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:39.560
 They just thought everyone was having too much fun.

00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:42.640
 - Yeah, that's the thing, it was encouraging odd ideas.

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:44.000
 Some of them cared about the animals,

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.880
 but majority of the Puritans didn't.

00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:47.640
 And one of the places that collapsed

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:50.480
 is where Queen Elizabeth went to the venue itself

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:53.120
 when it was rebuilt and had a French ambassador

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:53.960
 come and see a show.

00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:55.480
 So it was a private showing.

00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:57.800
 I asked Dr. Matthew Green about the globe thing.

00:28:57.800 --> 00:28:59.400
 And he said, "To be fair,

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:01.960
 "Queen Elizabeth didn't need to go to the globe.

00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:03.480
 "Shakespeare came to her."

00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:06.560
 So it's not as if she was against Shakespeare in plays.

00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:08.760
 But she did go to one of the bear garden places.

00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:10.040
 - 'Cause the bears wouldn't go to her.

00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:11.440
 - The bears wouldn't go to her.

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:12.400
 They were drunk in the pub.

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:13.760
 - All Republicans.

00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:14.600
 - And the other thing is,

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:17.720
 is that this whole point of trying to ban it on the Sundays,

00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:20.040
 Queen Elizabeth herself actually overturned

00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:23.600
 a parliamentary motion to have it banned on Sundays,

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:25.560
 'cause she was like, "No, this is great entertainment."

00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:28.800
 - The bears, we should say, as you sort of did,

00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:30.000
 they weren't killed that often.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.080
 It was just a lot of the dogs they got through.

00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:32.920
 The bears actually had quite a few times.

00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:34.200
 - Did you see what they were wearing?

00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:35.880
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:37.800
 - But the masts, my God, they went through a lot.

00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:40.320
 And there was actually the, yeah, the dogs.

00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:42.760
 There was a master of the king's bears

00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:45.040
 who was deployed from about the 1400s, I think,

00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:46.280
 who was the person who was responsible

00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:48.360
 for looking after the royal bears,

00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:50.440
 basically looking after bear fights.

00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:52.520
 And they were constantly having to restock mastiff.

00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:53.800
 So I think in Queen Elizabeth's time,

00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:56.320
 in King James's time, it was a guy called Alayne,

00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:59.480
 who was an actor, so he acted in plays and stuff.

00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:01.640
 But also he had to be always going around the country.

00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:03.760
 And he had the right to take people's dogs, I think,

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:07.080
 if he needed spare ones or can't seem to negotiate.

00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:09.880
 And if anyone was doing a bear fight or a bear dog fight

00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:12.120
 around the country, then he got a cut.

00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:13.160
 - Which is pretty sweet.

00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:14.000
 - It is wild.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.160
 And apparently bears were literally walked

00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:17.640
 past you in the streets, you know,

00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:19.000
 they weren't like in cages.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.200
 They're just on like a leech, like a dog,

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:23.480
 just sort of from the pub heading over to,

00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:25.120
 say, oh, watch out for the bear.

00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:26.880
 It's just wild time.

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:27.720
 - Step aside, darling.

00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:28.560
 - Yeah.

00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:30.680
 - I'm with Andy that this is a bad thing.

00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:31.720
 - Yeah, actually.

00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:33.920
 - Guys, James and I are, James and I are.

00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:35.920
 - We're not putting you two against us two on this one.

00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:37.760
 - Oh, look, I'm just saying, like,

00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:40.520
 if anyone at home agrees with me and Andy, then, you know.

00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:41.360
 - Thanks, James.

00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:42.680
 - Really, thank you for the support there.

00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:43.800
 And I'm so glad that we're on this.

00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:44.720
 - Oh, it's very brave of you.

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:45.560
 Well done.

00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:46.400
 (laughing)

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:48.680
 Look, there was other stuff that was like peripheral

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:51.000
 to the bear baiting, which was actually quite fun.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.200
 So I was reading an account by, I think,

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:55.080
 a foreigner who came to watch one of these,

00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:57.240
 obviously barbaric displays.

00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:58.400
 But also there were-

00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:01.080
 - Amazon boardnet, just feeling a bit cold now, Dan.

00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:03.160
 (laughing)

00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:04.880
 - Thought I slipped that in.

00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:06.720
 So there were dogs chasing horses around

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:07.800
 as one of the rounds.

00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:09.160
 So this is in between the bear baiting.

00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:10.960
 You know, you use the arena for other things.

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:12.520
 Dogs chasing horses.

00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:14.440
 Men and women were brought out in boxes

00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:17.880
 to fight, dance and converse with each other for entertainment.

00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:18.800
 (laughing)

00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:20.240
 There was another quite fun thing

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:23.400
 where a man threw some white bread among the crowd.

00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:25.680
 The crowd all scrambled for it.

00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:27.520
 And then over the middle of the arena,

00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:31.280
 a giant rose was fixed and then set on fire by a rocket.

00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:33.600
 Lots of apples and pears fell down from this rocket

00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:35.640
 while all the people were scrambling for the bread

00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:37.320
 and scared the shit out of them.

00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:39.400
 - That sounds like Hella Gabalus, doesn't it?

00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:40.240
 - Yes, it does.

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:42.000
 - A man and emperor who used to do weird things like that,

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.000
 like drown people in rose petals and stuff.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:44.840
 - Yes.

00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:46.520
 I think none of these people even drowned

00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:50.000
 in the raining apples and pears and bread.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.920
 They just got a nice bit of white bread.

00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:53.800
 It's just quite weird to imagine that crowd goes that mad

00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:54.920
 for some crumbs of white bread.

00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:55.920
 - I might have said this before,

00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:57.600
 but I was in a cricket crowd once

00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:01.080
 where people were throwing out bits of soiree and malt loaf

00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:03.200
 and everyone were absolutely mental for that.

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:07.280
 - Oh, I don't blame you, I would too.

00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:08.400
 That's nice.

00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:10.680
 - Elizabethan sort of hobbies in general?

00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:11.520
 - Yeah.

00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:12.520
 - Sort of that kind of thing.

00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:14.960
 I got a bit distracted by things

00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:16.480
 that Queen Elizabeth liked doing.

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:17.320
 - All right.

00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:21.680
 - She liked going to parties,

00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:24.920
 specifically large parties held for her around the country.

00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:27.600
 - Didn't you just have to go to those?

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:28.600
 Do we know that you like--

00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:29.640
 - Far from, no, no.

00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:31.600
 So you know the thing of royal progress is?

00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:32.440
 - No.

00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:34.800
 - It's where the monarch would go around the whole country

00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:35.760
 and it dates back to a time

00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:38.200
 when there wasn't a proper court and a proper castle.

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:39.520
 You might have a bit of a fortress,

00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:41.720
 but basically to subdue your territory

00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:43.240
 and show you're still the boss man,

00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:45.320
 you have to go around quite a lot

00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:46.880
 and the court is always on the move.

00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:48.520
 And that still survived even when Queen Elizabeth

00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:49.920
 was on the throne.

00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:52.600
 You would progress to various different

00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:54.080
 stately homes around the country

00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:55.400
 and they would go into a huge tiz

00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:57.240
 'cause the queen or king was coming and you'd have to--

00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:58.080
 - Is that the same thing

00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:01.400
 there's like certain stately homes still have laws

00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:02.880
 that if the monarch goes there,

00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:04.240
 then they have to give them a bed.

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:06.480
 - I think it's that, it's exactly that.

00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:08.980
 New toilet seats and all of that.

00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:11.320
 And there was one party which was hosted

00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:13.080
 by the Earl of Leicester, who was Robert Dudley.

00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:15.080
 - Yep, her fave, that's not all.

00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:17.480
 - Her fave, he was constantly proposing to her.

00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:19.440
 That was her other hobby was turning down the proposals

00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:23.120
 of Dudley and he threw this huge party,

00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:27.040
 the Kenilworth Spectacle in 1575, 19 days of partying.

00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:30.320
 He built her her own micro palace on his grounds.

00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:31.160
 And then she complained,

00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:33.400
 I can't see the garden you've commissioned from my bedroom.

00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:35.760
 So he had his gardeners build her a new version

00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:38.360
 of the garden overnight under her window.

00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:40.160
 Crazy, there was a water pageant

00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:41.920
 with an 18 foot long mermaid.

00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:43.600
 There was a moving island, there were fireworks,

00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:45.120
 there was hunting, there were plays.

00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:47.280
 He was the least popular man in England, we should say.

00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:50.040
 He was incredibly popular 'cause his wife he married

00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:52.560
 when he was a teenager had mysteriously died

00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:54.600
 two years after Elizabeth became the queen.

00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:56.760
 And there was a lot of talk that maybe he was responsible.

00:33:56.760 --> 00:33:59.360
 - I guess back then as well, you don't know so many people.

00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:01.880
 Like there's like six celebrities back then, right?

00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:03.160
 So he would have been one

00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:04.400
 and one's got to be the most hated.

00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:07.040
 - It's not like you could have like some people hate

00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:10.440
 Piers Morgan and some people hate Elon Musk.

00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:12.320
 Like you basically, everyone's going for the same one.

00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:14.280
 - I got six people to pick from, that's it.

00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:16.600
 - Yeah, well, he was so unpopular.

00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:17.800
 - Probably because everyone knew

00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:19.280
 that he fancied Elizabeth, right?

00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:20.480
 Everyone always hates the person

00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:22.360
 who's trying to have the affair with the monarch.

00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:23.760
 - And might have killed his first wife.

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:26.040
 - I don't like the first wife thing.

00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:28.160
 - She definitely died two years after she became queen.

00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:30.240
 So an old lady from Brentwood told her neighbors

00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:33.920
 that my Lord Robert hath given her majesty a red petticoat

00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:36.160
 implying that they've slept together.

00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:37.840
 - New Zealand jail slang.

00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:39.400
 - It's boob slang, yeah.

00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:42.120
 She was jailed for even telling her neighbors that.

00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:42.960
 - Really?

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:43.800
 - So they were crushing down on it.

00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:45.560
 But yeah, so that was.

00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:46.400
 - That's interesting.

00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:48.400
 - Was the kennel a thing that he displayed put on?

00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:49.880
 That was where they accidentally burned a town

00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:51.040
 to the ground, right?

00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:52.200
 (laughing)

00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:54.840
 - That normally have not helped his popularity yet.

00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:56.200
 (laughing)

00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:57.520
 - I don't know that.

00:34:57.520 --> 00:35:00.000
 - It was 1572, it was one of the things

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.720
 that he put on for Elizabeth.

00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:04.480
 And he staged this huge mock battle for her.

00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:06.280
 And they had these amazing fireworks.

00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:08.160
 And then they had cannons that they just fired

00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:09.440
 randomly into the air.

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:11.440
 And they all landed on the adjacent town

00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:12.560
 and burned down a bunch of houses

00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:13.880
 and killed at least one person.

00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:16.520
 - That's the most upper class English sentence ever.

00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:18.880
 Is that the town I accidentally burned down?

00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:21.640
 (laughing)

00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:22.840
 - Please, yeah.

00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:24.720
 - Just very quickly, Henry VIII,

00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:26.600
 father of Elizabeth the First,

00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:27.880
 also loved bear baiting.

00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:29.960
 And he used to go around the country as well.

00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:32.520
 And one thing that he always brought with him

00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:36.200
 was a locksmith who always put a new lock

00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:37.600
 on the door that he was sleeping in

00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:38.920
 of the room that he was in.

00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:39.760
 - Really?

00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:40.960
 - Yeah, 'cause he was so worried about assassination.

00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:42.760
 And then when they left the next day

00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:43.920
 or however many days later,

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:45.400
 he would take the lock off the door again.

00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:47.920
 So you just have this messed up door

00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:49.560
 as a result of the stay.

00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:50.880
 And he would bring it to the next house

00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:52.440
 and he would lock it onto the new door.

00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:53.600
 - Oh, so it's one lock.

00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:54.440
 He's not having to put--

00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:55.280
 - I'm sure he had multiple,

00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:57.440
 but he would always put it on and take it off.

00:35:57.440 --> 00:35:58.600
 So you left with the lock.

00:35:58.600 --> 00:35:59.440
 - That's quite good.

00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:01.000
 That's a good plot device, I'm sorry.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.720
 Like the lock man is the assassin, you know?

00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:06.400
 - He's gonna be the first person everyone suspects

00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:08.240
 when suddenly the lock has been opened.

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:10.640
 (all laughing)

00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:12.680
 - Who could have done this?

00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:14.880
 - It feels like someone's got something to hide, doesn't it?

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:16.720
 If they rock up at your sleepover and they say,

00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:19.400
 "I've brought my own lock, don't mind me."

00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:20.760
 What are you doing in there?

00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:21.600
 What are you doing in there?

00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:23.200
 It's so paranoid about.

00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:24.920
 - Is the lock going on the sleeping bag here?

00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:25.960
 - Wait, why would it, what?

00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:27.720
 - Sorry, you just said someone turns up at your sleepover

00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:28.560
 and they brought their own lock.

00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:29.800
 - 'Cause I'm a sleepover,

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:31.140
 everyone gets their own rooms.

00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:33.600
 (all laughing)

00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:35.520
 - We're all gonna go to bed in our separate rooms now.

00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:37.360
 - Oh, we're all going to a different wing.

00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:38.800
 - Yeah, for the scary stories.

00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:40.520
 Yes, perfect, yeah.

00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:43.100
 (upbeat music)

00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:47.800
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:49.360
 and that is Andy.

00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:51.600
 - My fact is that in Edwardian times,

00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:54.200
 you could order a barrel of seawater

00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:56.280
 to be delivered to your inland home

00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:58.200
 so you could keep on enjoying the health benefits

00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:00.120
 of your holiday after it ended.

00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:02.800
 - Now, do you have to get some sailors

00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:03.920
 to come from their boats?

00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:07.320
 - Oh no, a cracker for my nice fresh barrel of seawater

00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:08.160
 to have my bath.

00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:10.760
 Oh, it's full of jacktars.

00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:12.960
 - Yes, was it to have your bath or was it to drink?

00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:14.280
 Or was it to massage yourself with?

00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:15.880
 - A bit of everything, a bit of everything.

00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:17.680
 There's nothing that seawater couldn't do.

00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:18.720
 - Right.

00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:21.280
 - And this is from a great, it's from a sub-stack

00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:23.480
 I subscribe to called "Reading On Trains"

00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:25.600
 by Andrew Martin, which is all about trains.

00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:29.160
 And it's mostly about trains that I got interested in this.

00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:30.520
 - This isn't about trains though, is it?

00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:31.480
 - No, it's about seawater.

00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:34.200
 But seawater delivered by the Great Eastern Railway.

00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:35.040
 - Oh my God.

00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:38.640
 - So this was in Edwardian times,

00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:39.640
 so in the early 20th century,

00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:41.560
 you would get a barrel of seawater

00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:44.120
 from Lowestoft to Liverpool Street

00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:48.080
 and they would pump it into these massive wagons at one end

00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:49.200
 and then they decant it.

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:50.480
 They have a little spigot at the other end,

00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:52.160
 they just decant it into a barrel

00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:55.440
 and then they send the barrels all around everywhere.

00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:58.000
 And you would order a massive barrel of seawater

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.480
 and have a bath in the sea in your house.

00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:02.080
 - Were there any poor kids who said,

00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:04.200
 "Can we go on a beach holiday this year, Mum?"

00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:05.920
 And they're like, "I'll do you, almost as good."

00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:06.960
 - We have the sea at home.

00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:07.800
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:08.720
 It was basically that.

00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:11.520
 And this was all because people were obsessed with seawater

00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:12.680
 being a really good thing for your health.

00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:15.000
 - Yeah, this is a, so I now live in Margate

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.480
 and there's still a ginormous hospital there

00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:19.760
 which was built as a royal bathing house,

00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:23.280
 basically using sea therapy as a way of fixing people.

00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:24.600
 - But ironically, at the moment,

00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:26.680
 the trains don't really go from here to Margate,

00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:27.520
 do they, Dad?

00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:28.360
 - Yes.

00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:30.360
 - That's why you're half an hour late this afternoon.

00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:31.200
 - It's all right, 'cause once you get there,

00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:32.440
 the sea's full of poo anyway.

00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:33.800
 So it's fine, I know.

00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:35.240
 This is the problem with sea these days.

00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:37.360
 But it was, this is a big deal

00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:40.160
 that kind of actually weirdly transformed

00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:41.680
 the way that we visit beaches now

00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:43.760
 because it was like a paupers thing

00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:45.720
 and it was never part of holidays.

00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:48.840
 And then suddenly when this hydrotherapy thing came in,

00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:50.360
 suddenly everyone was going back to the beach

00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:51.200
 and that's kind of created.

00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:52.680
 - And that actually started much earlier, didn't it?

00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:53.520
 Like 1750s, I think.

00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:55.560
 - Like 1700s, yeah, exactly.

00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:56.400
 - It's one doctor.

00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:58.520
 - It was a guy called Richard Russell.

00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:01.480
 And he's basically responsible for Brighton existing.

00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:04.000
 He thought that seawater was great for you,

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.560
 much better than like getting the water from Bath

00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:09.440
 or from an inland spa or Bugston or something.

00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:11.760
 And he got a big old house in Brighton,

00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:13.320
 the biggest house at the time,

00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:15.000
 because Brighton wasn't really a thing.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:16.720
 And he got a lot of people there

00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:18.800
 and he cured them supposedly.

00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:19.640
 - Of anything as well.

00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:21.720
 It was the usual cures in the olden days.

00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:24.280
 You could cure scurvy or jaundice or TB,

00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:28.480
 a lot of TB cured by just drinking or bathing in.

00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:31.080
 I think Richard Russell advised his patients

00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:33.840
 to drink seawater and he said that a pint of it

00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:36.560
 was sufficient to give three or four sharp stools,

00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:38.200
 which I think he meant as a good thing.

00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:40.560
 - Yeah, you don't want it sharp, do you?

00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:41.920
 - It seems not today,

00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:43.960
 but maybe it was sought after in those days.

00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:48.000
 - You diluted it with milk or honey, either way.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.920
 I mean, I did read that he variously included

00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:52.800
 a few extra things, like he sprinkled in some,

00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:54.280
 I read Crab's Eyes,

00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:56.520
 which I can't believe is a cost effective thing,

00:39:56.520 --> 00:39:57.800
 'cause seawater is quite cheap to get.

00:39:57.800 --> 00:40:00.160
 Crab's Eyes feels like quite labor intensive.

00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:02.080
 - Yeah, it feels like they've got a little bit of grit

00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:03.400
 in the bottom of the seawater.

00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:05.400
 So I know that's Crab's Eyes.

00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:07.640
 - Is it because basically medicine wasn't very good

00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:11.280
 at the time and seawater is at least relatively benign?

00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:12.120
 Is that it?

00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:13.320
 - No, who knows. - Is it fresh air?

00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:15.280
 - They just didn't know about evidence-based medicine,

00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:16.120
 did they?

00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:17.360
 Oh, but I imagine the fresh air.

00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:19.120
 - I think people just sometimes get better.

00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:20.040
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:22.600
 - Like from some things, sometimes people will say,

00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:24.680
 "Oh, you've got tuberculosis

00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:27.240
 "and actually you've got a terrible, awful cough."

00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:28.080
 - Right.

00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:28.920
 - And eventually it gets a bit better

00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:30.280
 and you're like, "Oh, I'm cured of my TB."

00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:33.760
 But they didn't do an actual test to see if you had TB.

00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:34.960
 - Right, I see that, yeah.

00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:38.360
 - This guy anyway, he sold his house to George III

00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:40.720
 and then George III invited the Prince of Wales

00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:43.040
 to visit him, the big Prince Regent.

00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:45.560
 It was originally called the Bright Helmston

00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:47.480
 and they decided to change its name to Brighton

00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:49.520
 because the royals had started going there.

00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:51.560
 So it literally was him that started Brighton.

00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:52.640
 Brighton wasn't a thing before that.

00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:55.760
 - Yeah, Bright Helmston is such a cool name.

00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:56.600
 - When I look at it,

00:40:56.600 --> 00:40:59.160
 I bet the locals pronounced it Brighton anyway.

00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:00.000
 - Brick Helmston.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:01.320
 - You know, it's one of those English names.

00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:03.680
 - I did read that it was from about the 1600s.

00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:05.520
 Most people had been calling it Brighton.

00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:09.160
 But it was still officially Brick Helmston until about 1810,

00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:11.040
 I think, which is back in the period you're talking about.

00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:12.560
 - This was the same with Margate.

00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:17.080
 So in 1791, this big hospital was called Margate Infirmary

00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:20.080
 for the relief of the poor whose diseases require sea bathing.

00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:21.440
 But then it got a royal patronage

00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:23.640
 and became the royal sea bathing infirmary.

00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:26.840
 And if you go down to Margate these days,

00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:28.920
 most of the houses have very randomly

00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:31.160
 just a little porch on the first floor.

00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:34.360
 And the idea was you would push out your elderly relative

00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:35.920
 onto the balcony of your house

00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:37.360
 and you just leave them outside.

00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:39.560
 And then you'd come and get them after hours and hours

00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:41.840
 just to see how it affected there.

00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:43.960
 So you see them all over these random balconies

00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:45.000
 on those houses there. - That's cool.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:45.840
 - Fresh air is good for you.

00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:47.120
 And cold water is good for you, right?

00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:49.240
 - A lot of things about going to the beach are very good too.

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:51.040
 You get away from the stresses of daily life,

00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:52.520
 the pollution of London.

00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:54.000
 - But being dunked, being dunked in cold water

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.080
 is definitely good for your health.

00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:57.240
 It sort of triggers all sorts of adrenaline response.

00:41:57.240 --> 00:41:58.080
 - It depends.

00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:00.440
 If you dunk pneumonia, it's not really that good for you.

00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:02.360
 - I don't think there's a huge, I mean, I'm a huge fan,

00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:03.680
 as you know, big cold water bather.

00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:06.640
 But I don't think there's a huge amount of scientific studies

00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:08.320
 that have been done that definitively prove that.

00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:09.360
 - There are a few things like,

00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:12.920
 because you have this weird sort of reflex, don't you?

00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:14.640
 Like a diving reflex.

00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:17.400
 So I think it's something to do with your vagus nerve.

00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:18.240
 - Yeah.

00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:19.320
 And that was the idea at the time

00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:21.480
 that it shocks you out of something.

00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:23.960
 So this is why women were dipped, right?

00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:26.360
 And dippers were celebrities.

00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:27.200
 And they'd be-

00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:29.240
 - Again, there were fewer famous people at the time.

00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:31.040
 This is a Robert Dudley problem.

00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:32.880
 - It was Robert Dudley and the dippers.

00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:35.680
 - Dudley and the dippers is a great 1960s party.

00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:38.400
 - Yeah, and the dippers were great.

00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:39.440
 So they were men and women.

00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:41.720
 And if you were a male bather who'd gone to Brighton,

00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:43.320
 and often you'd be someone who couldn't swim

00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:44.560
 'cause most people couldn't,

00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:45.760
 then you'd need a dipper.

00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:47.200
 And as a man, you'd have a male dipper.

00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:48.920
 As a woman, you'd have a female dipper.

00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:51.560
 But these were beefy, muscly people.

00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:54.240
 I think one of the most famous ones was Martha Gunn

00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:58.720
 in Brighton, who did it from 1750 to the early 1800s.

00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:00.960
 And the idea was that you have your client.

00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:02.680
 - Wow, she would have been quite old by then.

00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:05.200
 - Yeah, she did it from, you know, 20 to 80 or whatever.

00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:07.040
 - She lived until she was 90.

00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:08.960
 She just was constantly dunking

00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:11.320
 and just standing in the water all the time.

00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:12.200
 Rain or shine?

00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:13.040
 - Yeah.

00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:14.800
 - Martha had very wrinkly toes.

00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:16.120
 - Oh!

00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:18.160
 - She's 90-year-olds to start off with.

00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:19.920
 And then she's in the water all day.

00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:20.760
 - You wouldn't be able to tell

00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:23.760
 where it was natural wrinkle versus ocean wrinkle.

00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:25.320
 - Yeah.

00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:27.200
 - But you did a lot more than just dunk, of course.

00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:29.520
 You tailored your treatment to your client.

00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:31.640
 So if Dan came to me and was like, "I want to be dunked,"

00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:33.400
 I'd say, "Why? What's wrong with you?"

00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:35.080
 I'd work out how long you want to be dunked for,

00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:38.920
 how many times, how deep, which bit of seawater,

00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:40.440
 whether you want to massage with it.

00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:42.120
 - We all know he wants to be dunked in lockdown

00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:43.200
 until he's found the monster.

00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:46.200
 (all laughing)

00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:48.760
 - Now seawater, though, it's going to do nothing.

00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:51.760
 There's a cool invention that came off the back of people

00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:55.640
 wanting to bring the sea to them, as Andy was mentioning.

00:43:55.640 --> 00:43:57.640
 You could use normal water as well for this,

00:43:57.640 --> 00:44:00.640
 but there was an item that was invented in the 1890s

00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:03.000
 called the rocking bathtub.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.520
 And what it was is it's a bathtub,

00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:09.160
 which is shaped in a sort of like crescent moon sort of shape.

00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:11.640
 So like a, as if like a rocking chair.

00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:13.440
 And you would sit inside,

00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:16.200
 you would put three barrels of water inside with you,

00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:18.280
 and then you would start rocking back and forth.

00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:20.960
 - You'd add to the water out of the barrels?

00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:22.160
 - No, into your bath.

00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:23.160
 - Right, so you pour the water out of the bath.

00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:25.760
 - Sorry, yeah, you don't hug the barrels, yeah.

00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:27.120
 It's not Donkey Kong.

00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:28.800
 (all laughing)

00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:30.880
 So the idea was to create the ocean,

00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:33.840
 to the waves, to make it feel as if you were in the ocean.

00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:35.600
 So not only do you have your saltwater with you,

00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:37.480
 you have the vibe of an ocean side.

00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:38.320
 - I quite like doing that.

00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:39.960
 I think that's good to do in the bath anyway.

00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:41.520
 It's just my bath is not a rocker.

00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:42.360
 Oh my God.

00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:45.040
 - Whose mom has to come in and clear up the bathroom afterwards?

00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:47.880
 - Well, it supposedly didn't leak, but it did.

00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:50.200
 But supposedly it didn't, but it absolutely didn't.

00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:51.720
 - I just am these bathrooms.

00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:53.480
 After every time he has a bath,

00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:55.160
 water all over the floor, isn't there?

00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:56.400
 - It's pretty bad.

00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:57.280
 Lot of rubber ducks,

00:44:57.280 --> 00:45:00.360
 a lot of accurate bottles of World War II battleships.

00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:02.360
 It's true about the place.

00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:03.800
 Do you know it's still so handy?

00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:06.600
 I know that sometimes you read these things

00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:09.440
 and you think you want to have that in your own home.

00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:10.280
 That's often how you are.

00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:13.920
 You can get seawater delivered to your house still to this day.

00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:15.440
 Yeah, I found a place.

00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:17.440
 If you want the details, I'll forward them on.

00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:21.440
 You can get 20 litres sent to your house for 19 pounds.

00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:26.480
 And it's seawater that's sourced off the Dorset coastline

00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:28.240
 from a deep water supply.

00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:31.520
 And so this is largely for aquariums and so on.

00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:32.360
 - Oh.

00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:33.200
 (laughing)

00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:34.040
 - Have water delivered to them.

00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:35.000
 - I'm still interested.

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:35.840
 (laughing)

00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:36.680
 - It's such a shame,

00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:37.960
 'cause I literally just watched Andy write down

00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:39.520
 all those details he gave him.

00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:41.160
 And now I have to get a fish.

00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:43.720
 - I've written 20 litres, 90 pounds in sourced Dorset.

00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:44.560
 - It sounds great.

00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:45.800
 - Yeah, but yeah, it happens.

00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:48.560
 - Deep seawater I think is like a trendy thing

00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:50.160
 that's supposed to be good for you, right?

00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:53.120
 'Cause the minerals go down to the very deep part

00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:56.400
 of the water and all the carbon goes down there

00:45:56.400 --> 00:45:57.600
 and it can't really get anywhere out.

00:45:57.600 --> 00:45:59.920
 So the minerals in there are really, really awesome,

00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:01.600
 apparently, and it's supposed to be good for you.

00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:05.000
 I think like some sports people use it to rehydrate

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:06.560
 'cause it's supposed to have more chemicals in it.

00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:07.400
 - Right.

00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:09.360
 - Yeah, is there any healthier than the rest of us?

00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:11.640
 (laughing)

00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:12.480
 - No, I've heard that.

00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:13.320
 I think that's plausible.

00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:14.880
 And also, but shallow seawater genuinely,

00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:16.200
 there is a problem in the UK with lots of--

00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:17.040
 - Yeah, it's terrible.

00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:18.120
 - It's sewage and the--

00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:20.440
 - Yeah, but you, I mean, you would fish the turds out

00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:21.760
 when you, before you drink it.

00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:22.800
 - And there's our slogan.

00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:24.120
 - We fish the turds out.

00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:27.160
 (laughing)

00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:28.200
 - May contain turds.

00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:30.240
 (laughing)

00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:32.800
 - Prepared in a facility which contains turds.

00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:34.600
 (laughing)

00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:36.720
 We've made our best efforts, yeah.

00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:39.000
 - I found some cool waters that exist out there.

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:40.280
 Melted water.

00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:41.880
 Would you drink melted water?

00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:44.680
 - Uh, so melted, so it was frozen?

00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:48.320
 - I've had like water that comes from icebergs.

00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:50.440
 - Yeah, so this is Lithuania, they make,

00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:53.000
 but what's interesting is they grow and create the iceberg

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:54.040
 and then they melt them.

00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:56.600
 So it's not natural icebergs.

00:46:56.600 --> 00:46:59.640
 And then they put that melted ice into a bottle.

00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:01.600
 And so yeah, apparently it tastes like puddle water,

00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:04.880
 but it won the Lithuanian product of the year 2013.

00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:05.840
 It won gold for that.

00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:07.680
 - They don't have a lot going on in Lithuania, do they?

00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:08.520
 - No, it must have been a thin year.

00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:09.360
 - That's winning.

00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:10.200
 (laughing)

00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:11.600
 - In thin year in Lithuania, yeah.

00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:12.440
 - That's very funny.

00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:15.240
 - Also, interestingly mentioned just a few minutes ago,

00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:17.880
 Loch Nesswater is now bottled.

00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:20.080
 It's taken, it's put through filtration systems

00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:21.400
 and they sell it.

00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:25.920
 For example, the AIG Women's Open Golf Championship in 2024.

00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:27.160
 It was the official sponsor.

00:47:27.160 --> 00:47:30.920
 So all of their players were drinking Loch Nesswater.

00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:33.080
 - Okay, now I wasn't interested in that

00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:34.880
 until the very end, now I am.

00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:35.920
 (laughing)

00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:38.320
 Finally the crossover of interest with you and Dan.

00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:39.560
 (laughing)

00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:41.000
 It's a liver.

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:43.200
 - Yeah, the most famous person who would have done

00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:46.560
 the sea bathing thing down in Margate is T.S. Eliot.

00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:47.560
 - Really?

00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:49.240
 - Yeah, T.S. Eliot came down and he did it.

00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:52.080
 And he took time off from his bank job.

00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:53.800
 He moved down there and his wife came with him.

00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:56.160
 And that's where he started properly writing

00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:57.560
 the Wasteland again.

00:47:57.560 --> 00:47:58.400
 And--

00:47:58.400 --> 00:47:59.680
 - Is that based on Margate?

00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:02.320
 (laughing)

00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:04.720
 - Yeah, my house gets a shout out, it's quite cool.

00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:05.560
 (laughing)

00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:06.760
 - Yeah, and so in the Wasteland,

00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:09.400
 there's only one moment where you see through the eyes

00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:12.320
 of T.S. Eliot, as in he's sitting in a spot looking up

00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:14.320
 and that's by a bus stop down on Margate Beach

00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:16.440
 as he was there using the sea air to recover.

00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:17.360
 - Has it got a plaque?

00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:19.760
 - It did, and that's down now, unfortunately.

00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:21.660
 And what's even more annoying for T.S. Eliot,

00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:24.480
 we did a great fact that his name is an anagram of toilets.

00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:27.000
 It is literally right next to the public toilets.

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:27.840
 So--

00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:29.000
 - People see the plaque saying T.S. Eliot,

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:30.600
 they just think it's a massive typo.

00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:32.880
 (laughing)

00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:36.840
 - No, right next to his plaque is in block words, toilets.

00:48:36.840 --> 00:48:38.440
 - They put underneath in brackets, Wasteland,

00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:39.600
 but that didn't help anyone.

00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:41.440
 (laughing)

00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:44.020
 (upbeat music)

00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:48.120
 - Okay, that's it, that is all of our facts.
