00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.500
 [MUSIC]

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:20.800
 >> Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Auckland.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:28.540
 [APPLAUSE]

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:34.900
 >> My name is Dan Schreiber, and I am sitting here with Anna Chazinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:40.160
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.700
 And in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.020
 Starting with you, Chazinski.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:54.940
 >> My fact is that in 2004, Moscow's politicians were told to stop kissing each other because it took up valuable time that could be spent having more meetings.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.540
 [LAUGHTER]

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.940
 >> Just really got one laugh before the end of the time.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.640
 >> You're going to love this evening, if you're.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.700
 >> Yeah, this is true, this was, I think it was first reported in the British press in the Telegraph.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:23.580
 2004, basically, Moscow politicians were kind of sick of being mocked by the media for the big Soviet era style bear hug they would do in the three kisses, very enthusiastic kisses, the kissing ceremony, they would call it.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.980
 So a word was passed down through local government circles that they had to stop kissing each other because it was time wasting.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.620
 It just took up so much time that you walked into a meeting with 20 other politicians in there.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.620
 Everyone had to do three ostentatious kisses and a massive bear hug to each other.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.580
 And by that point, the meeting was adjourned.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.060
 [LAUGHTER]

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.660
 >> So it's banned officially from the meetings?

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:49.060
 >> People were told within regional government that we shouldn't be doing it.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:58.740
 But there is, I didn't know this, a thing called the Socialist Fraternal Kiss, which is a secret kiss that you can only give or receive if you're a communist leader.

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.500
 >> Wow, that's all right, yeah.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.340
 >> So it is.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.500
 >> Not many of them left, isn't it?

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.220
 >> No, kissing club is getting smaller and smaller every year.

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:13.580
 So as you said, I know there's three kisses on alternate cheeks or if you're really close on the lips.

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.820
 And there's also the Socialist Fraternal Embrace, which is three deep hugs without kissing.

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.460
 >> Three hugs.

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.340
 >> You hug and then you push away and then you swing back healing.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.540
 >> Yeah, it's like the hokey-cokey but with hugs.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.540
 >> Wow, that's so ambitious.

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.620
 >> It's really gone in and out of fashion in Russia, though, since sort of pre-Soviet times, even.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.380
 And yeah, I read a really good article, which was in the Washington Post in 1994.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.860
 So obviously, a few years after the fall of the Berlin Wall.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:48.460
 And it was a journalist saying how devastated he was that the Socialist Fraternal Kiss seemed to be coming back into fashion.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:54.700
 He said we were so thrilled when the Soviet Union collapsed, because even though a lot of things about its split opinion,

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.540
 it brought about one change that everyone could agree on.

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.980
 We could share that no longer would our breakfast be upset by photos of commy big wigs

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.820
 nuzzling each other's five o'clock shadows and a smack each other on the lips.

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.340
 [LAUGHTER]

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.340
 And then it came right back into fashion.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.740
 >> Wow.

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.580
 >> I guess it's gone in and out of fashion everywhere, hasn't it really, like kissing in greetings?

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:22.260
 Because it used to be that if you ever had a contract in England or France, for instance, you would have to kiss to make the contract real.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:22.740
 >> Right.

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.340
 >> And that was at least till the 13th or 14th century.

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.700
 And the reckon of the reason they don't do it anymore was that by the 18th century,

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.700
 people's mouths were no longer vile, stinking, diseased, and stained.

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.300
 [LAUGHTER]

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.140
 And so it meant that actually a kiss became more eroticized.

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.940
 >> Oh.

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.900
 >> So before that, if you kiss someone on the lips, it was a real kind of, it's a burden.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.100
 >> Yeah, a burden, exactly.

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.700
 >> Wow.

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.500
 >> It meant you really wanted to do the contract.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.340
 >> But it was banned though in various places since early medieval times.

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.940
 And so in 1439 Henry, the 6th of England banned kissing.

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.820
 And it was thought that it spread plague, which is actually quite well done on them,

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.140
 given they had no understanding of germs and work for another half millennium.

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.460
 But he banned kissing, it was banned in Naples.

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:11.740
 And this was because, particularly in England, kissing was a huge deal until then.

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:13.300
 So it was thought that spread the plague.

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.180
 But foreign journalists would come to England and they loved it.

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:23.380
 So there was Erasmus, not the Erasmus, but another Erasmus around that time visited England.

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:28.380
 And just said, I'm so thrilled and surprised that female hostesses at every single party

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.700
 just come up to me and snog me full on the lips.

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:31.340
 >> Really?

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:32.820
 >> He never said the word snog.

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:33.580
 >> Yeah.

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:34.380
 >> Yeah.

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.100
 >> Poor guy, poor the guy, the other Erasmus, not the main Erasmus.

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.740
 He must have spent his whole career going, "Hi, I'm Erasmus."

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.620
 No, actually, there are two of us.

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:49.660
 >> The one about Henry the 6th, it was Parliament who asked him to do this because of the plague, wasn't it?

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:55.860
 And the reason was that knights would always kiss the king on the mouth whenever they did him a service.

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.460
 >> I don't know the service, James.

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.660
 >> Wow.

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:02.540
 >> I don't know what doing him a service isn't this context.

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:06.820
 >> And kissing babies, politicians kissing babies, this is the longest average thing.

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:09.780
 But I think it was first established by President Andrew Jackson.

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.300
 So he once got handed in the reports of the time a dirty baby to kiss.

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.900
 And he didn't want to sort of thought it was a bit of a gross baby.

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.700
 >> But you're not kissing the bit that gets dirty, are you?

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.340
 >> You're not, no.

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.620
 But it was a sort of grubby child.

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:28.260
 And he handed it over to the war minister and said, "Eden, kiss him."

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.220
 >> Yeah.

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:33.500
 >> Or did you know who they kissed before they kissed babies?

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.180
 >> Oh, no.

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.780
 >> Feet assist now, that can't be, yeah.

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:40.460
 >> It's not just the thing before babies.

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:41.420
 >> Okay.

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:43.820
 >> It was wives.

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:48.700
 So in the 18th century and before that, politicians when they were canvassing would kiss people's wives.

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.420
 And this is because it was openly understood, even though women couldn't vote.

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:54.060
 They had huge influence over the men in their lives.

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:59.620
 And so politicians used to suck up to women almost literally more than they did to men.

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:06.180
 And it was a thing, if you go through old book sources, they're constantly canvassing by kissing women.

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:06.980
 And in fact-

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.620
 >> So, is Donald Trump just being old-fashioned, you know?

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:11.020
 >> [LAUGH]

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:12.140
 >> Yeah.

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:13.220
 >> It's just tradition.

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.780
 >> [APPLAUSE]

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:18.660
 >> He's respecting the English aristocracy.

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:22.900
 There was a candidate for Norfolk, for a Norfolk borough in 1758,

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:27.420
 who apparently was expelled from the party when he kissed all his voters' wives

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:31.820
 and slipped a golden guinea into the mouth of each one while doing so.

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:32.820
 >> Wow.

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:34.780
 >> That was pretty creepy.

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:35.900
 >> That's a good trick, that is.

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:36.860
 >> That's right, if you can do it.

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:38.300
 >> Very clever, very clever.

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:39.260
 >> A guinea is a joke on that.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:40.300
 You wouldn't be expecting that with you.

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:41.260
 >> That's a big coin.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:42.260
 >> That's a big coin.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:43.060
 >> Yeah.

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:46.100
 >> Just, I have a few things that are banned in Russia.

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:47.620
 >> Okay, everything.

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:48.100
 No.

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:49.900
 >> [LAUGH]

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:50.620
 >> Free speech.

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:52.300
 No, well, it is a bit like that, actually.

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:54.100
 >> [LAUGH]

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:55.420
 >> So there is a thing at the moment.

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:56.700
 You must have seen it in the news, maybe.

00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:01.100
 I don't know, but the Ross Com-Nazdor is the federal service

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:03.220
 for monitoring mass communications.

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:05.620
 Okay, and so there is an app called Telegram.

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:09.740
 It's a bit like WhatsApp, and what you do is you send messages to each other,

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:13.900
 but it's encrypted, and they refuse to give the government the encryption software.

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:18.180
 And so no one can read the messages, and they've tried to close it down.

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:21.060
 And they closed it down by blocking IP addresses.

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:26.460
 In doing so, they blocked and crashed MasterCard Google, Amazon, Volvo,

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:30.100
 Nintendo, Spotify, and their own website.

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:32.580
 >> [LAUGH]

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:35.580
 >> And they've not managed to stop anyone from using Telegram at all.

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:37.580
 >> [LAUGH]

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:39.540
 >> Is all of the election fiddling rumors?

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:41.900
 It's just them trying to sort out their own messaging service,

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:44.420
 and accidentally crashing elections around the world.

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:47.180
 >> A couple of things on meetings.

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:50.140
 Just ways you can, actually, I've got one more thing on kissing,

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:53.780
 which I think I want to say to you, which is about animal kissing.

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:56.260
 >> Oh yeah, so not many animals kiss, very, very rare.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:08:03.060
 Apart from bonobos, bonobos, so bonobos will suck each other's tongues for 12 minutes straight.

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:04.660
 >> [LAUGH]

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:05.140
 >> Wow.

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:07.380
 >> That would get my vote, I'll tell you that.

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:09.860
 >> You can probably get a few thousand pounds in your mouth.

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:11.780
 >> [LAUGH]

00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:13.020
 >> Keep the guineas coming, come on.

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:14.500
 >> [LAUGH]

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:19.620
 >> Hey, I read a thing about kissing, which is now if you're a criminal,

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:22.580
 don't kiss someone at the scene of the crime before you leave,

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:24.500
 because you can get caught for it.

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:26.140
 >> I mean, who is actually doing that, though?

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:30.100
 >> What bank robbers says, put everything in the bag and give us a kiss?

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:31.220
 >> Yeah.

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:33.660
 >> This happened in Paris, basically.

00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:35.220
 Of course it was Paris.

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:38.740
 Of course it was, he was overcome with the romance of the city.

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:39.900
 >> Yeah.

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:42.620
 >> So, check this out, what happened was in this case,

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:45.980
 there was a hold up with this lady who worked for a bank.

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:47.540
 And they were really bad to her.

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:50.180
 They did tricks to her that made her fear for her life.

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:54.260
 But, and so one of the bank robbers was so worried that they'd gone a bit too far with

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:58.300
 the trauma that he kissed her to sort of calm her nerves like that would help.

00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:04.860
 So, he gave her a kiss and they went off and she freed herself and she called the police.

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:08.700
 And they took a swab from the inside of her cheek and they managed to pick up some of

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:12.980
 the DNA that he'd left inside there from the kiss and they found him and he got arrested.

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:13.500
 >> Wow.

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:14.380
 >> Yeah.

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:17.740
 >> And sorry, what was the source that said he kissed her to calm her nerves?

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:23.300
 >> I think if he's leaving enough DNA in her mouth.

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:25.940
 >> That's almost a binobo kiss, isn't it?

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:28.980
 >> I would take that as aggressive.

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:33.300
 Although, the binobo kiss would not be allowed in Hollywood for a very long period of time.

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:39.140
 Because kisses in Hollywood were only allowed to last three seconds, less than three seconds.

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:40.980
 So, it was so strict on kissing.

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:44.420
 This was from the 1920s onwards, basically it was the Hollywood code because to prevent

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:50.740
 like salaciousness and immorality getting into Hollywood, sorry, started in the early 1930s.

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:55.380
 And it said that because there could only be three seconds, they had to be essential to

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:57.700
 the plot, otherwise they weren't allowed.

00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:00.260
 And you had to kiss with at least two feet on the floor.

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:05.740
 So if there were four at least two feet, you could have three at least four is fine.

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:09.100
 >> Hang on, a kiss takes two people, so there are four feet involved.

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:10.100
 >> Okay.

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:11.700
 >> So at least two of the couples feet.

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:16.460
 But it did mean that when you see a woman lying on a sofa in a 1940s film and snogging

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:19.820
 a man who rigidly stays standing up for the process.

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:22.420
 Because he's not allowed to get onto the sofa with her.

00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:23.420
 >> Wow.

00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:26.060
 >> Well, you could both be hopping, that would be fine.

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:27.060
 >> Yeah.

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:28.060
 >> Yeah.

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:31.020
 >> As long as you're not both off the ground at the same time, Ditto, trampolines.

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:32.020
 >> [LAUGH]

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:35.260
 >> So we're going to have to move on to our next fact, surely.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:40.140
 >> I genuinely did have a thing about meetings, which is a way to keep a meeting short.

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:42.860
 This has genuinely been tried to save time in meetings.

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:48.300
 So it's by the co-founder of Flickr, the app, her name was Catherine Affake, which I think

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:50.300
 is a real name.

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:58.860
 But she, she, she used to insist that everyone would drink a pint of water before a meeting.

00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:01.340
 And the meeting would last until someone had to go to the Lou.

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:03.340
 >> That's really clever.

00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:04.340
 >> Yeah.

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:05.340
 >> Yeah.

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:06.340
 >> That's amazing.

00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:07.340
 >> That's great.

00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:08.340
 And we're using that principle tonight.

00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:09.340
 >> Yeah.

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:10.340
 [MUSIC]

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:11.340
 >> Okay.

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:14.340
 It is time for fact number two and that is James.

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:19.340
 Okay, my fact this week is that the Northern Ireland Assembly Building was camouflaged

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:22.340
 during World War II by covering it in Kalmanur.

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:24.340
 >> [LAUGH]

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:25.340
 >> So cool.

00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:28.820
 >> So this is the thing that happened, it's storm once, it's cold.

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:32.980
 And they painted it with a mixture of Kalmanur and Bitumen, and the problem was it was a really,

00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:34.500
 really white building.

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:37.380
 And they thought that the Nazis would be able to see it really easily.

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:41.700
 And so they thought if we cover it in shit, it would look like the rest of Belfast.

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:44.700
 >> Wow.

00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:47.700
 >> Wow.

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:48.700
 >> Do you know James?

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:53.700
 I've really enjoyed our show in Belfast era in the year and I'm just sad that it's never ever going to happen again.

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:56.700
 >> Not bizarre how much support that got in Auckland New Zealand.

00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:58.700
 >> [LAUGH]

00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:05.700
 >> Yeah, but actually they spent seven years scrubbing it after the war and it's still slightly off-white.

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:06.700
 >> Yeah.

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:11.700
 >> It was meant to wash right off, right? That's why they used that specific material, but yeah, it failed.

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:14.700
 So it's got a hint of poo all over it.

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:15.700
 >> [LAUGH]

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:16.700
 >> Wow.

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:21.700
 >> People did try some really extravagant things to disguise buildings in the war, didn't they?

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:27.700
 So Boeing's plant number two, which was the American plant that made sort of most of their bombers,

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:32.700
 I think, during the Second World War, was disguised as an entire town.

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:37.700
 It's so cool, so it made 300 bombers a month. It was totally crucial to the war effort.

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:42.700
 But on top of this factory, they had fake streets and fake trees and fake cars and houses.

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:46.700
 But because it was only meant to be disguised from above, everything was weirdly distorted from below.

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:51.700
 So all the houses were four-foot tall, so they were like shoulder height houses.

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:54.700
 >> It's like Hobbit Town down the road, isn't it?

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:55.700
 >> [LAUGH]

00:12:55.700 --> 00:13:04.700
 >> They were designed by a Hollywood set designer who was used to doing that stuff for tricks in films and trees were made of chicken wire, covered in feathers.

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:11.700
 And then there were weird little clues like the streets in this place were called things like synthetic streets on the street signs.

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:14.700
 >> You have to get pretty close in an airplane to be able to read that.

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:20.700
 >> Yeah, and also they had leaves that were chicken feathers that were painted green.

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:21.700
 >> Yeah.

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:22.700
 >> Why didn't they just use leaves?

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:23.700
 >> Yeah, fair play.

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:26.700
 >> I'll tell you why, it's because they did, no, there's no good reason.

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:35.700
 The reason is that, as Anna said, this is in Hollywood and what the government did is they spoke to the Disney Studios Universal Warner and all of them got so excited.

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:42.700
 They sent in all of their best set people and they just took it too far and they were sending real people in day to day to act out as if they were living there.

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:46.700
 And they would move the cars so that it looked like things were different.

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:48.700
 >> They would, they had to go and take down their washing.

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:55.700
 >> They were in a different one because there were a few, one in California, sort of actors or people in the military had to go and take their washing down off the fake washing line.

00:13:55.700 --> 00:14:01.700
 Their fake washing off the fake line just in case a plane flew overhead, which it didn't ever.

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:08.700
 >> If the towns were tiny though, because they were smaller, they were to a smaller scale, wouldn't it have looked like there were giants?

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:09.700
 >> Yeah.

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:11.700
 >> Along the west coast of America.

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:12.700
 >> That's scary.

00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:13.700
 >> That's very scary.

00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:16.700
 >> Yeah, don't mess with them, they're huge.

00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:24.700
 >> On disguising things in the war, so there was also a thing called Operation Bertram which was in Britain, mainline Britain.

00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:31.700
 And it was using fake equipment and fake munitions to trick the Germans into thinking that things were elsewhere when they weren't.

00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:44.700
 But get this, one tactic that was used was to hide real artillery under fake trucks and also to hide real artillery under structures which looked like badly camouflaged dummy structures.

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:45.700
 >> Wow.

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:52.700
 >> So they would fly over and think, oh, they've really botched disguising that, you know, dressed in making a stupid fake bit of artillery there.

00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:56.700
 So that's all fake artillery, great, with real artillery underneath it.

00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:57.700
 >> Wow.

00:14:57.700 --> 00:14:59.700
 >> I'm so confused, Andy, so.

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:01.700
 >> That's the idea, James.

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:02.700
 >> Yeah.

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:04.700
 >> That's amazing.

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:05.700
 >> Yeah.

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:06.700
 >> That's a risky game.

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:07.700
 >> It's risky.

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:12.700
 >> Do you know they actually had, I didn't realize this at the time, they had a camouflage school in South Kensington.

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:22.700
 So it was a place where they sent all of their most sort of camouflage, the designers who sort of manufactured all of these things that we're talking about.

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:26.700
 A lot of the British ones would go and they would come up with their ideas there and they would road test them there.

00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:37.700
 Number of the ideas that came out of there and manufactured out of there, they had a thing where if you were in a trench in the war, it'd be very dangerous obviously if snipers were shooting at the trench.

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:42.700
 So what they did was they manufactured lots of paper mache heads and they put them on a stick.

00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:49.700
 So they would lift up from the trenches just a stick with a head on it, a soldier's head and if that got shot they would know that the snipers were active and ready.

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:52.700
 So that was one of the things that they manufactured.

00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:53.700
 >> Yeah, pretty cool.

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:55.700
 >> Why didn't they always do that?

00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:58.700
 Why did anyone die in the trenches?

00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:03.700
 >> I suppose you could have given every soldier an extra fake head on top of their head.

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:09.700
 And really all like one of those costumes where it looks like you're riding an EMU.

00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:10.700
 >> Yeah.

00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:13.700
 >> Because in that case the head is always the person's head, isn't it?

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:14.700
 >> I guess so.

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:19.700
 So I guess it would be a massive EMU costume with which you're in, which they're not shooting.

00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:23.700
 >> Well you could do it. You know when you have children trying to get into a movie and they're on each other's shoulders.

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:24.700
 >> Yeah, yeah.

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:27.700
 >> And the massive overcoat because then they'd also think you were giants.

00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:28.700
 >> Yeah.

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:29.700
 >> Wow.

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:34.700
 >> What a shame pantomime directors didn't also direct the first world war.

00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:37.700
 >> So a use of dung in the second world war.

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:38.700
 >> Yeah.

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:42.700
 >> When the German army were in North Africa, a lot of the soldiers suffered from dysentery.

00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:46.700
 And what they thought they'd do is they'd look at the locals didn't seem to suffer.

00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:48.700
 So they thought they'd look at the locals.

00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:53.700
 And they saw the locals would follow a camel and scoop up its dung and eat it.

00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:54.700
 Okay.

00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:58.700
 So the Germans thought, well we might as well try it, you know, might as well, right?

00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:00.700
 And it turns out it works.

00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:04.700
 And that's because there is beneficial bacteria in this camel poo.

00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:08.700
 And for that reason, these camel dung things were really good luck for the Germans.

00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:10.700
 They found them to be really, really good luck.

00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:13.700
 And so whenever they saw them in the tanks, they would drive over them.

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:15.700
 And so what did the British do?

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:17.700
 We just put explosives in them.

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:21.700
 And so every time they went over a camel dung, they got blown up.

00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:24.700
 And so then they thought, okay, we're not going to do that anymore.

00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:29.700
 But we still need the good luck. So what they would do is they'd go over ones which had tire tracks in them.

00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:31.700
 And so what did the British do?

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:34.700
 They made ones with tire tracks in them and put explosives in them.

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:38.700
 Oh, those dastardly brits, there's always one step ahead.

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:42.700
 Dung in war, other uses of Dung in war, Vietnam war.

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:47.700
 The soldiers had, I think, which was a dog poo transmitter.

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:48.700
 So it was the tea--

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:49.700
 That's a transmit dog poo.

00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:51.700
 No, sorry.

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:57.700
 It's a fake radio. It's a dirty fido sort of plastic poo, which is actually a radio transmitter.

00:17:57.700 --> 00:17:59.700
 And it can be used as a homie beacon.

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:03.700
 That's great. But they're going to notice if you hold that next to your mouth and speak into it.

00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:09.700
 They'll probably think you're hangover from the North African campaign in the Second World War.

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:10.700
 Just giving it a go.

00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:15.700
 That reminds me, there was an interview in the Indian Express quite recently with a guy called Shankar Lau.

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:19.700
 And he's part of a group that's trying to promote traditional methods in India.

00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:25.700
 And he says that he applies fresh cow dung to the front and back of his mobile phone every day.

00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:31.700
 And he says that that is going to protect him from harmful radioactive emissions.

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:38.700
 He says in the interview, if cow dung can treat cancer, why can't it save us from phones microwaves?

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:43.700
 I think there is a flaw in that argument, isn't it?

00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:48.700
 Although they have considered using human dung in space, we never call it dung.

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:51.700
 We never call it dung, I know. But human poo in space.

00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:57.700
 So the Mars mission that was planned in 2013, which has come to nothing and they've sort of hidden that fact.

00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:03.700
 But they plan to use human poo on the outside of the spacecraft in order to protect it from radiation.

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:04.700
 That's right, yeah.

00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:11.700
 And in 2017 there was a study that was done looking into where the human feces would be useful, protecting from outer space radiation.

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:16.700
 It turns out it will, and more importantly, it will, even when it's been dehydrated.

00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:21.700
 Because you know how in space you obviously need to reuse all the liquids that you can in order to drink them.

00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:25.700
 So you can drain the liquid out of your own poo and drink that.

00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:28.700
 And you're still able to use the dried poo to protect you from radiation.

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:30.700
 Well, this is wonderful news.

00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:33.700
 It's a win-win.

00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:35.700
 Yeah.

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:37.700
 But it's not just on the outside, isn't it?

00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:42.700
 The idea is that they would, as they were going to Mars, any new poo that they made,

00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:46.700
 would you smear it on the inside? It's only new poo, sorry.

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:49.700
 It's only new poo, exactly. So you don't pre-smart this.

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:51.700
 I understand that, but it's going on the outside, right?

00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:52.700
 Not the inside.

00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:53.700
 Well, how are you going outside?

00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:56.700
 Every time you have a poo, you've got to go outside and smear it on your wall.

00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:57.700
 Yeah.

00:19:57.700 --> 00:19:59.700
 It's protecting from, I'd rather live on it.

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:04.700
 Okay, I'd rather live in a home, which had poo smeared all over the outside than all over the inside.

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:07.700
 Oh, they're picky.

00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:10.700
 This is why you'd never pass the NASA training.

00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:17.700
 So what would you choose, sorry?

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:20.700
 Would you, right, poo outside or poo within?

00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:21.700
 Pooh inside.

00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:22.700
 Why poo inside?

00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:26.700
 You're hurtling towards Mars. I'm going to go outside into the vacuum of the universe

00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:30.700
 just so that I can put my little stool on the side. No.

00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:31.700
 I just mean--

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:35.700
 Do you know how long it takes to put on the outfit alone?

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:37.700
 They don't call it an outfit.

00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:44.700
 I--

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:48.700
 I just mean socially. I would rather my neighbours thought I lived in a horrible house,

00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:51.700
 but I live in a nice house.

00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:52.700
 Do you--

00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:53.700
 Please.

00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:59.700
 All right, so this is--it's also poo based, I'm afraid, but this is quite cool.

00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:05.700
 There is a plant which pretends to be an antelope poo in order to propagate itself.

00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:10.700
 So it's the resty-ad plant and it produces seeds and they're quite big seeds

00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:13.700
 and they look exactly like antelope droppings.

00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:18.700
 And this tricks dumb beetles into rolling them to a new home.

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:20.700
 No, that's very cool.

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:22.700
 How weird is that?

00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:23.700
 A free ride.

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:24.700
 Yeah.

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:28.700
 Well, there's--so a lot of insects keep their own feces.

00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:29.700
 Poo-ba, poo-ba.

00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:31.700
 Sorry, that's like a poo-ba.

00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:33.700
 What?

00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:38.700
 If you--if you say that in a sentence, I can edit it in.

00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:41.700
 It's like they invented poo-ba.

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:43.700
 It's like poo-ba, poo-ba.

00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:45.700
 It's a poo.

00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:55.700
 So there are insects that keep their own poo to use as a weapon, which is good recycling.

00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:57.700
 There are quite a few of them, actually.

00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:00.700
 There's the tortoise beetle and it mounts its poo on its back.

00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:02.700
 So when it defecates, then it puts its poo on its back.

00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:03.700
 And that's a shield.

00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:07.700
 And it can also repurpose that shield to use as a sword in a fight

00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:08.700
 if it's attacked.

00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:10.700
 And it's--

00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:15.700
 Oh, it's not a shot.

00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:16.700
 It's funny.

00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:17.700
 It's funny.

00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:19.700
 It's a--it's a poo sword.

00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:20.700
 It's a poo sword.

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:21.700
 It's a poo sword.

00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:22.700
 It's a poo sword.

00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:27.700
 And its offspring have what scientists seem to be calling a fecal thatch,

00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:30.700
 which is basically the roof of your home.

00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:31.700
 They make--

00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:34.700
 Oh, now the roof, the inside and the outside.

00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:36.700
 I thought the roof was safe.

00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:41.700
 Would you rather have it on the top of the roof or the inside of the roof?

00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:44.700
 We need to move on and take, but finish this, Anna.

00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:45.700
 That's it.

00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:46.700
 They'll have a fecal thatch.

00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:47.700
 They have a thatch made of poo.

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:48.700
 They weave it together.

00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:50.700
 They weave it like a thatch, though.

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:51.700
 It's called that's for a reason.

00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:54.700
 They sort of sew their poo together, their poo strands.

00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:55.700
 And that's a protective thatch.

00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:59.700
 So when the larvae are attacked, the tortoise beetle larvae,

00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:01.700
 then they can't penetrate the poo.

00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:04.700
 It's weird, though, because the sword's made out of poo,

00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:06.700
 but also the protection is made out of poo.

00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:07.700
 Yeah.

00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:08.700
 Yeah.

00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:09.700
 It's just interesting.

00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:12.700
 This is why they're not running the show on this planet, frankly.

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:14.700
 [LAUGHTER]

00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:19.700
 OK, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:21.700
 My fact is that according to the best available study,

00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:27.700
 men think about sex between once a day and 388 times a day.

00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:30.700
 [LAUGHTER]

00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:32.700
 So what you're saying is the best available study is not

00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:33.700
 very good, sir.

00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:36.700
 Well, all there's a load of variation.

00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:39.700
 So this is more a fact about study design.

00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:40.700
 Strap in, guys.

00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:43.700
 [LAUGHTER]

00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:47.700
 In case you thought it was about sex, it's not.

00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:50.700
 So there are lots of myths and things on the internet about how

00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:51.700
 often men think about sex.

00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:54.700
 And one thing says every seven seconds, that's a really old and

00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:56.700
 debunked thing.

00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:59.700
 And that would be 7,000 times a day, which is huge.

00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:04.700
 So there was a recent study by Ohio State University, which gave

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:08.700
 people, gave men a clicker with three buttons.

00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:10.700
 And they were food, sex, and sleep.

00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:13.700
 And it just said, click each of the relevant buttons whenever

00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:14.700
 you think about this thing.

00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:16.700
 So they did that.

00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:18.700
 And one man clicked the sex button one time in a day.

00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:21.700
 And another man in the study clicked 388 times.

00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:24.700
 Which is every-- he might have been aroused by clickers.

00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:28.700
 [LAUGHTER]

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:29.700
 That's a very good point.

00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:32.700
 I think he misunderstood and thought it was which one of these

00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:35.700
 do you want to order?

00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:37.700
 It's like you have a menu.

00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:39.700
 I think my clicker's broken.

00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:42.700
 I've pressed the sex order a number of times.

00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:44.700
 It's not shown up.

00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:45.700
 Yeah.

00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:48.700
 But the people who did this study, what they wanted to do was

00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:51.700
 they wrote about it, and they said that what they don't want

00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:54.700
 is for people to report it as men think about sex

00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:57.700
 on average 19 times a day, because that's what they found.

00:24:57.700 --> 00:24:59.700
 The average was 19 times.

00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:01.700
 But they thought if people reported it like that, then people

00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:04.700
 would be saying, I think about it too much.

00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:05.700
 I think about it not enough.

00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:06.700
 And people get anxious about that.

00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:07.700
 I think they're unusual.

00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:10.700
 And so they're really keen for people to say men think

00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:14.700
 about sex between one and 388 to show that all of these things

00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:15.700
 are quite normal.

00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:16.700
 That's what I said.

00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:17.700
 That's what I said.

00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:18.700
 I'm thanking you.

00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:19.700
 Oh, cool.

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:21.700
 Well, thank God we didn't mention the thing that they didn't want.

00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:22.700
 No, I'm James.

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:23.700
 Right.

00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:27.700
 The other thing is this was of men under the age of 25.

00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:28.700
 This was college students.

00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:29.700
 Okay.

00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:31.700
 And they said that they really want to do it of adults

00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:33.700
 over the age of 25.

00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:35.700
 But it was hard to obtain that sample,

00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:37.700
 because most of the participants did not follow through

00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:40.700
 with a telly counter, because they had no real incentive

00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:41.700
 to do so.

00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:43.700
 Oh, yeah, they just cut the ass.

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:45.700
 They were like, oh, whatever.

00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:46.700
 They pressed it once.

00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:48.700
 They realized it wasn't working as a menu.

00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:52.700
 So there are other ways of solving this problem,

00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:54.700
 because in that study, you don't know if people are clicking

00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:56.700
 accurately or if a thought passes through their head too quickly

00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:58.700
 to register or if having a clicker, as you said,

00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:00.700
 makes them more aware of their thoughts.

00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:03.700
 So there was a German study which did a different thing

00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:04.700
 that it was a phone survey.

00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:07.700
 And they would text people on the phones.

00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:10.700
 And they would ask seven times a day and they would just say,

00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:13.700
 what have you been thinking about in the last half hour?

00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:16.700
 And that found that--

00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:18.700
 so that's a slightly better way of doing it, perhaps,

00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:20.700
 because you're not relying on self-reporting.

00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:23.700
 And yeah, you're just checking in with people.

00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:25.700
 And that one found that until 5 p.m.,

00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:29.700
 men think about sex less frequently than they do about coffee,

00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:34.700
 and that checking email was in first place almost constantly.

00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:37.700
 And sex only became a big thing at the end of the day,

00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:40.700
 and even then sleep beat it.

00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:42.700
 That is my experience of sex as well.

00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:45.700
 [LAUGHTER]

00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:48.700
 It always wins in the end sleep.

00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:52.700
 But I guess the only thing that really is illuminating it

00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:55.700
 in these studies a lot is that men have needs-based thoughts,

00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:56.700
 don't they?

00:26:56.700 --> 00:27:01.700
 So always men think about food, sex, and sleep more often

00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:04.700
 than women do, and it's not clear why.

00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:06.700
 But that does seem to be the case.

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:09.700
 So I think in this study it was thinking about food,

00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:13.700
 men every 68, men every 38 minutes, women every 62,

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:17.700
 sleep, women thought about it every 72, men every 33.

00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:21.700
 So women have so much more thinking time to use up.

00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:23.700
 Is that the take-home thing there?

00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:27.700
 My take-home is honestly, how did the patriarchy ever get above water?

00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:28.700
 Yeah.

00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:29.700
 [LAUGHTER]

00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:32.700
 You guys are way six so much time.

00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:35.700
 [APPLAUSE]

00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:37.700
 There's a thing about how many thoughts you have a day.

00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:40.700
 When I know that, people quote wildly different numbers,

00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:43.700
 because some people say it's 70,000 a day, which is about 50

00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:45.700
 thoughts every minute.

00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:47.700
 And I just-- I know this is an anecdote,

00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:49.700
 but I do not have 50 thoughts a minute.

00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:50.700
 I do agree with that.

00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:51.700
 In your case.

00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:52.700
 Yeah, thank you.

00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:54.700
 [LAUGHTER]

00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:55.700
 Do you know what?

00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:57.700
 [LAUGHTER]

00:27:57.700 --> 00:27:59.700
 Do you know what questions do you do thinking?

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:00.700
 No.

00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:02.700
 Well, it's happening now, whatever it is.

00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:03.700
 Yeah.

00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:05.700
 You think it would encourage you to think creatively

00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:07.700
 as you're trying to come up with an answer, no?

00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:10.700
 No, so this is a good point.

00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:12.700
 It stops you from thinking about anything else.

00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:13.700
 It engages your brain.

00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:16.700
 Your brain effectively goes, ooh, and shuts down

00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:19.700
 to focus on this one thing that's about to come at you.

00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:20.700
 But that's good, right?

00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:22.700
 That's exactly what you want from a question.

00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:24.700
 Well, it depends what the question is, doesn't it?

00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:27.700
 If the question is, would you rather have poo on the outside

00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:28.700
 of your house or the inside?

00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:29.700
 [LAUGHTER]

00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:32.700
 Then there's probably better things to think about, 100%.

00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:37.700
 Starting to a 2013 study, men think about football at least once a minute.

00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:40.700
 Again, I don't want to be a Debbie downer on that.

00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:44.700
 But I haven't thought about football for about at least a month.

00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:45.700
 [LAUGHTER]

00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:47.700
 And even then, it was bloody football's on again.

00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:48.700
 [LAUGHTER]

00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:51.700
 That was according to a study by the English FA.

00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:53.700
 [LAUGHTER]

00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:57.700
 So on thinking, I've been thinking about thinking.

00:28:57.700 --> 00:29:01.700
 And it's very hard to find out about experiments about thought online,

00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:04.700
 if you Google that, you just get thought experiments, which is a different thing.

00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:08.700
 However, there is a thing about whether animals think and what they think,

00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:11.700
 if they think, obviously they do think.

00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:15.700
 But if you search for do animals think, the first suggested Google result,

00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:19.700
 the first one is, do animals think humans are cute?

00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:21.700
 [LAUGHTER]

00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:23.700
 And I think that some of them do, don't they?

00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:24.700
 Maybe.

00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:28.700
 But number four is, do animals think cars are animals?

00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:29.700
 [LAUGHTER]

00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:33.700
 And that's as you'd-- and there's so much thought devoted to this online.

00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:34.700
 And what's the answer?

00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:36.700
 Well, it's not conclusive.

00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:39.700
 Because they've got four wheels, which could be light legs.

00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:40.700
 Yeah.

00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:41.700
 Exactly. They're big.

00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:44.700
 So there was an account written on Reddit, which I just wanted to share.

00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:45.700
 So there's a guy who wrote on Reddit.

00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:48.700
 He said, once rescued a hungry cat from a fishing spot,

00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:51.700
 it was deadly scared of being in the car and couldn't stay still.

00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:53.700
 It was a hazard for me to drive back within the cabin.

00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:56.700
 So it left me no choice but to put it in the trunk.

00:29:56.700 --> 00:30:00.700
 So my surprise, traveling at 70 miles an hour, the cat managed to hit the child,

00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:02.700
 the skateboard, and jump out.

00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:07.700
 I believe the cat thought the car was some sort of big whale

00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:09.700
 [LAUGHTER]

00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:13.700
 and got swallowed, then pooped out, traveling 70 miles per hour.

00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:15.700
 Wow.

00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:17.700
 [LAUGHTER]

00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:19.700
 This wasn't a scientist right in this.

00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:21.700
 I don't think so.

00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:24.700
 Where has a cat ever seen a whale?

00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:27.700
 [LAUGHTER]

00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:31.700
 Weird.

00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:34.700
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show.

00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:36.700
 And that is my fact.

00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:43.700
 My fact this week is that in 1565, Pope Pius IV commissioned artist Daniela Del Volterra

00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:47.700
 to add to Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel fresco

00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:50.700
 by painting underwear on all the naked people.

00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:53.700
 [LAUGHTER]

00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:57.700
 Presumably it was nice underwear, not sort of grubby wife-runs.

00:30:57.700 --> 00:31:00.700
 Well, it was, yeah, underwear of the time.

00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:06.700
 So the underwear was more loinclothy and sort of little sheets that would come over.

00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:11.700
 And nicely positioned in the wind over a butter kind of thing.

00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:16.700
 But this is because it was seen as very controversial that you had this beautiful fresco

00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:20.700
 with all these penises basically hanging out on them.

00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:22.700
 And they wanted to get rid of that.

00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:29.700
 And this particular artist, Daniela Del Volterra, was a disciple of Michelangelo

00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:31.700
 who painted the Sistine Chapel.

00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:32.700
 He studied under him.

00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:34.700
 He was a very good friend of his.

00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:38.700
 And so he was given this task to go and sort of just cover up all the nudity.

00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:41.700
 The Volterra guy, do you think when people asked him what he did?

00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:42.700
 He said, "I'm a panter."

00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:44.700
 And they'd say, "Do you mean a painter?"

00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:46.700
 And he'd say, "No."

00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:47.700
 [LAUGHTER]

00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:48.700
 I don't think so.

00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:49.700
 Yes, unlikely, yeah.

00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:52.700
 Because he was Italian and the joke wouldn't work in that language.

00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:54.700
 Yeah, it doesn't, let's be honest.

00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:56.700
 It doesn't really work in this language.

00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:57.700
 [LAUGHTER]

00:31:57.700 --> 00:32:01.700
 But he did get a nickname which still is attached to his name to this day,

00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:03.700
 which is Il Braquettone.

00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:05.700
 And that means the breaches maker.

00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:10.700
 And it was an embarrassing thing really in the history of art that he had to do it.

00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:16.700
 I've heard arguments that he did it because he was actually trying to save the Sistine Chapel

00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:19.700
 from total destruction, so he was doing it to save his friends.

00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:20.700
 Oh, really?

00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:21.700
 Yeah.

00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:25.700
 Because he said he was a disciple and I thought that he's a massive traitor.

00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:30.700
 No, because, sorry, just what happened was they had the council of Trent just afterwards.

00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:34.700
 And there was a new law which said, "You're not allowed any of these kind of images in churches anymore."

00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:37.700
 And anyone that exists have to be destroyed.

00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:40.700
 And he managed to put this on just in time so they didn't destroy it.

00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:41.700
 Yeah.

00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:48.700
 It said that the holy synod ordains that no one be allowed to place or cause to be placed

00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:52.700
 any unusual image in any place or church, however exempted,

00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:55.700
 except that image that had been approved by the bishop.

00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:58.700
 So you weren't allowed to put anything in your church that wasn't approved.

00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:01.700
 And this, a few years later, there was a guy called Paolo Veronaise,

00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:05.700
 and he was brought in front of the Inquisition because he'd painted the last supper

00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:08.700
 with a load of drunken Germans in the background.

00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:10.700
 [LAUGHTER]

00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:12.700
 That's not his fault they turned up.

00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:15.700
 [LAUGHTER]

00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:16.700
 Unusual image.

00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:17.700
 Unusual image.

00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:19.700
 Like, I think the council of Trent still holds it.

00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:21.700
 You're not allowed on usual images in your church.

00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:22.700
 That's so weird.

00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:24.700
 Unusual isn't even erotic or salacious.

00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:28.700
 It's like a lizard eating Harrison Ford or something.

00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:30.700
 [LAUGHTER]

00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:34.700
 I love, I love an Andy's idea of those guys just turning up and even being forced to paint it.

00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:38.700
 I love the idea that all future last supper of paintings had a bouncer at the end.

00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:40.700
 [LAUGHTER]

00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:41.700
 Sorry, mate, can't come in.

00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:42.700
 [LAUGHTER]

00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:47.700
 So Michelangelo's David was another victim of what is called the Fig Leaf campaign

00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:49.700
 by the church and by the authorities in Florence,

00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:52.700
 which is all about covering up genitals, basically.

00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:56.700
 So nude statuary.

00:33:56.700 --> 00:33:58.700
 Statuary, statue.

00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:02.700
 New statues were a new thing.

00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:05.700
 So there's an idea which says that Donna Tello's David in 1440

00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:08.700
 was the first naked statue since Roman times.

00:34:08.700 --> 00:34:11.700
 And that there just weren't any in all the dark ages

00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:13.700
 because it had fallen out of favor as an ideal.

00:34:13.700 --> 00:34:15.700
 Whereas in Roman and Greek times, it wasn't ideal.

00:34:15.700 --> 00:34:17.700
 It was a nude hero.

00:34:17.700 --> 00:34:19.700
 And it wasn't a shameful thing.

00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:22.700
 But the Fig Leaf campaign was all about covering things up.

00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:27.700
 So Michelangelo's David got either a bronze fig leaf, a report's vary,

00:34:27.700 --> 00:34:32.700
 or a mini skirt, soon after being unveiled.

00:34:32.700 --> 00:34:33.700
 Wow.

00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:34.700
 Really?

00:34:34.700 --> 00:34:35.700
 Yeah.

00:34:35.700 --> 00:34:37.700
 It's just on Michelangelo's David.

00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:39.700
 It's very easy to look back and think.

00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:42.700
 God, how weird and prudish well they didn't appreciate it.

00:34:42.700 --> 00:34:47.700
 But in 2012, the most expensive exhibition that had ever been put on

00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:49.700
 in the Beijing Museum was put on.

00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:52.700
 And it involved Michelangelo's David Apollo.

00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:55.700
 And when it was reported on CCTV, on Chinese TV,

00:34:55.700 --> 00:34:58.700
 all the genitals were blurred out.

00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:00.700
 So the statue genitals were blurred out.

00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:01.700
 Wow, really.

00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:02.700
 So we're still screwing that up.

00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:05.700
 There was a paper that was published about the reasoning.

00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:10.700
 Because if you look at Michelangelo's David, everything is in fantastic proportion.

00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:12.700
 All the, he's fantastic.

00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:14.700
 He does have quite a small penis, does he?

00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:16.700
 Yes, and that's very well-proportioned, James.

00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:23.700
 Click.

00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:24.700
 How many?

00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:32.700
 Unclick that click immediately.

00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:37.700
 Yeah, so they were looking at, they were doing the study and they noticed a few things

00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:39.700
 that were intentionally changed in size.

00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:43.700
 So for example, he has a big right hand, for example.

00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:46.700
 And that's because the suggestion is when he...

00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:50.700
 You're not allowed to do your own jokes.

00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:58.700
 It just looks like a small penis because it's right hand is so freakishly big, all right?

00:35:58.700 --> 00:35:59.700
 It happens.

00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:00.700
 It happens.

00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:05.700
 And he had hand extensions years ago.

00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:10.700
 He's regretted that ever since.

00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:19.700
 But yeah, so the suggestion is, because that was a tribute to the fact that he took down Goliath.

00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:24.700
 And so they looked at the penis size and said the reason that it's so small,

00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:27.700
 their conclusion is he's about to fight a giant.

00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:30.700
 His genitals have contracted in fear.

00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:33.700
 Yeah, he's petrified.

00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:34.700
 They've gone inside.

00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:36.700
 And he's...

00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:37.700
 What happens?

00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:38.700
 Is it?

00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:39.700
 That's...

00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:41.700
 Yeah, have you ever fought a giant?

00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:42.700
 Yeah.

00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:47.700
 It's a different excuse, isn't it?

00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:49.700
 I'm sorry darling, it's very cold.

00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:52.700
 I'm sorry darling, I just fought a giant.

00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:57.700
 And I won, high five.

00:36:57.700 --> 00:37:08.700
 It was a thing though, covering up paintings in the Renaissance and beyond.

00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:11.700
 And so there was...

00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:16.700
 A Renaissance fresco was discovered recently under a full ceiling in Valencia.

00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:19.700
 And it had been covered up for about 500 years.

00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:23.700
 And it was discovered when a pigeon suddenly fell out of a hole in the roof.

00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:26.700
 And some builders were redoing the roof, a kind of baroque roof,

00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:28.700
 that they thought was real baroque.

00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:31.700
 And a pigeon flew through a hole and they looked up through that hole.

00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:33.700
 And they realized it was a fake baroque roof.

00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:37.700
 And there was a huge fresco underneath that had been covered up,

00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:42.700
 not because it was obscene or anything, just because it was rotting in about the 1600s.

00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:46.700
 And it turned out that builders had been asked to cover this thing up to protect it.

00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:50.700
 But what we discovered a few years ago when we revealed this big fresco

00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:58.700
 was that the 1700s workmen who had to break it up had flicked plaster globules at each other.

00:37:58.700 --> 00:38:00.700
 So they'd had a game.

00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:04.700
 So all the sort of targets on the fresco, like the eyes and the mouth of the angels,

00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:06.700
 had big globules of plaster on them.

00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:08.700
 They'd been throwing plaster at each other.

00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:11.700
 And one of the angels' wings had a cock and bulls drawn on it.

00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:21.700
 That's 1674, people were drawing cock and bulls on angels' wings.

00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:23.700
 Wow.

00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:25.700
 Wow.

00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:30.700
 You know, there's a rumor that all the, because a lot of generals were chipped off statues.

00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:31.700
 Yes.

00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:34.700
 And that was the thing during the Fig Leaf campaign, which lasted decades.

00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:40.700
 But there is a rumor that there is a draw in the Vatican still full of all the removed penises.

00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:41.700
 Really?

00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:45.700
 And I can't stress the word rumour enough.

00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:49.700
 But it would make sense, because you would keep them away.

00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:50.700
 You would keep them away.

00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:51.700
 In case you needed them.

00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:53.700
 I really used them for building or...

00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:56.700
 No, they're not useful for anything else, but sometimes, you know, politics may change.

00:38:56.700 --> 00:38:57.700
 Yeah.

00:38:57.700 --> 00:39:01.700
 And there might be a great repunishing might happen.

00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:06.700
 Can I quickly add as well, just on our guy, Volterra.

00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:08.700
 I'm definitely saying that wrong.

00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:11.700
 He didn't get to complete it all.

00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:16.700
 So he only did a number of them, and then he passed away, and it was carried on by other artists.

00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:17.700
 Yeah.

00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:19.700
 So he didn't, he's not responsible for all the other work.

00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:20.700
 He did the ones at the top, didn't he?

00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:21.700
 Yeah.

00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:22.700
 When he was on scaffolding.

00:39:22.700 --> 00:39:26.700
 And then they had to remove all the scaffolding, because they had to get a new Pope or something.

00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:27.700
 Yes.

00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:31.700
 And then by the time they got the new Pope, he died, and so someone else had to do the other ones.

00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:34.700
 Does anyone, if they've been removed, the underpants that were painted on?

00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:37.700
 No, they haven't. This is a very interesting thing.

00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:44.700
 So the Vatican restored a lot of these frescoes and paintings in the ceiling between 1980 and 1994,

00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:47.700
 and a lot of the censorship has still remained.

00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:49.700
 Yeah, I think some of them have been removed.

00:39:49.700 --> 00:39:53.700
 Some of them have been removed, but they could have obviously revealed all the genitals, and they've been revealed some.

00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:58.700
 And they used to, when they were restoring, because they restored Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel a number of times,

00:39:58.700 --> 00:40:04.700
 the last judgment, sorry, is it's really cool. And what they used to do back in the day with restoration

00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:08.700
 is they would dab little bits of bread and clean it with tiny bits of bread.

00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:10.700
 Yeah, and these days they use cotton buds and so on.

00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:16.700
 I've heard that still some restoration people use bread as a good way of cleaning a painting.

00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:18.700
 Because they used to use bread as a razor, didn't they?

00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:22.700
 Before we had rubbers, then you'd use a rolled up bit of bread as an eraser.

00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:27.700
 Yeah. So a lot of people think that Michelangelo painted while lying down on his back.

00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:29.700
 I think there's a movie where he did that.

00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:37.700
 But actually, he was painting kind of standing upright, kind of cricking his neck backwards and reaching upwards with his arm and painting like that.

00:40:37.700 --> 00:40:39.700
 And it was unbelievably painful for him.

00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:43.700
 And he wrote a poem to his friend about what happened.

00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:54.700
 And he said, "My stomach squashed under my chin, my beards pointing towards heaven, my brains crushed in a casket, my breasts twist like a harpies, my brush above me all the time dribbles paint,

00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:58.700
 so my face makes a fine floor for my droppings.

00:40:58.700 --> 00:41:00.700
 My haunches are grinding into my guts.

00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:05.700
 My poor ass strings to work as a counterweight. Every gestor I make is blind and aimless."

00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:08.700
 And it goes on and on. Basically, he was an unbelievable pain.

00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:09.700
 Wow.

00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:11.700
 And I read this and I don't know if this can be true.

00:41:11.700 --> 00:41:18.700
 But it says, someone called Condivi, who was around just afterwards said that he had a bizarre form of eye strain,

00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:22.700
 which meant whenever he had to read a letter, he had to hold it at arm's length above his head.

00:41:22.700 --> 00:41:23.700
 No.

00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:25.700
 Where he was holding the paper.

00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:26.700
 No, really.

00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:27.700
 Apparently, God.

00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:28.700
 God.

00:41:28.700 --> 00:41:32.700
 He also painted, because it's nine panels and it tells a lot of stories from the Bible.

00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:34.700
 He painted it in reverse.

00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:41.700
 He started at the end and went back because he wanted to get so good at painting that by the time he got to God, he wanted to be an actor.

00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:47.700
 He didn't want to do a crappy God at the front and then a killer know his arc at the end.

00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:48.700
 He wanted...

00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:49.700
 Wow.

00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:57.700
 But he is an important thing to say, though. He was made to paint the city in chapel, Michael Andrews is, as punishment.

00:41:57.700 --> 00:41:59.700
 And it was thought it would be a huge failure.

00:41:59.700 --> 00:42:12.700
 And so Raphael, the other turtle, who is well known, suggested that he be the one to paint the city in chapel ceiling,

00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:19.700
 because it was thought to be impossible and also because Michael Andrews did not really do paintings. He did sculptures and he really didn't want to do it. He did it under papal duress.

00:42:19.700 --> 00:42:21.700
 He was made to do it.

00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:22.700
 And Raphael was so happy.

00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:30.700
 And the reason he was happy was because Michael Andrews had a falling out with Raphael's friend, Leonardo, surname Davinci.

00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:32.700
 And so it was a big turtle.

00:42:32.700 --> 00:42:33.700
 Really?

00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:34.700
 Yeah.

00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:38.700
 Do you think the reason he didn't do it on his back is because he wouldn't be able to get back up again?

00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:44.700
 [Laughter]

00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:47.700
 So, was Donna Tello in this on that?

00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:52.700
 As with every other piece of history that involves the three other turtles, Donna Tello was not involved.

00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:55.700
 Because he was long dead, sadly.

00:42:55.700 --> 00:43:02.700
 But the interesting thing about Raphael and how it backfired was that Raphael snuck in to see the city in chapel mid-creation.

00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:08.700
 So, Michael Andrews said cover it up with canvas so no one can see it until it's fully done and Raphael snuck in and had a look.

00:43:08.700 --> 00:43:20.700
 And he was so devastated by how good it was that he returned to his picture of the Prophet Isaiah and completely destroyed it, scratched it off the wall and repainted the whole thing because he realised that Michael Andrews was so good.

00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:24.700
 You know he got a really bad review when he first released the Sistine Chapel.

00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:26.700
 You released the Sistine Chapel.

00:43:26.700 --> 00:43:27.700
 [Laughter]

00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:33.700
 He got critics, some critics loved it, but other critics really did not like it.

00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:43.700
 This is the writing from a critic who called Pietro Arotino, again, bad pronunciation, but he wrote, and he was specifically about the ludeness and the nudity,

00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:55.700
 makes such a genuine spectacle out of both the lack of decorum in the martyrs and the virgins and the gesture of the man grabbed by his genitals that even in a brothel these eyes would shut, so was not to see it.

00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:56.700
 And that was a...

00:43:56.700 --> 00:43:57.700
 Two stars.

00:43:57.700 --> 00:43:58.700
 Two stars.

00:43:58.700 --> 00:44:07.700
 And no one at the time really pointing out that Arotino who wrote this was a very famous writer of pornography, so this is someone...

00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:08.700
 Yeah, coming from...

00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:20.700
 And so Michelangelo didn't respond to it, he was better than that and he didn't give any sort of reaction to it, but then he got a second bit of criticism much later, and this was by someone who was the master of ceremonies for the Pope.

00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:28.700
 He was very close to the Pope and he took a jab at Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel, and so Michelangelo then included him in the Sistine Chapel.

00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:39.700
 He took his likeness and he had a snake wrapping around him, which meant he was definitely going to hell, and then the top of the snake was here, the bottom of the snake came through his legs and was biting his balls.

00:44:39.700 --> 00:44:44.700
 Yeah, it's pretty harsh response to a critics' review, your show.

00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:49.700
 We're going to have to wrap up very shortly, anything before we do?

00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:59.700
 I can tell you that there was a pub in Shepperton in the UK called The Huffle, and in the ladies' toilets there was a statue of a naked man with a fig leaf on it.

00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:07.700
 The fig leaf was hinged, and when you lifted it, a small sign read, "A red light just flashed on and the buzzer sounded in the bar."

00:45:07.700 --> 00:45:15.700
 Amazing.

00:45:15.700 --> 00:45:26.700
