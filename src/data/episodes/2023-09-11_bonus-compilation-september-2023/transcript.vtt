00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.500
 Hey everyone, welcome to your very special bonus secret compilation episode that you get as part of being a Club Fish member.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.600
 This is a fun one today. Again, a very exciting collection of names joining us over the next half hour.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:20.400
 You're going to hear Phil Dunster. That's Jamie Tartt from Ted Lasso. You're going to hear comedian Rosie Jones.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:28.400
 And then of course we're joined by the brilliant Ann Miller and Alex Bell, QI elves and veterans of the No Such Thing as a Fish team.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:35.400
 So anyway, I hope you enjoy the episode. Before I get into it though, let's quickly reiterate something that was said on a recent episode with Neil Gaiman,

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:45.400
 which is that we are doing our 500th episode live at the London Podcast Festival on the 14th of September, and we're going to be joined by Anna Tushinsky.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:51.400
 She is back, but she's back just for this one episode. She's still on maternity, but she's coming back for this one.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:57.400
 I feel like Andy and I might have given the impression that she's back for good now. She is coming back for good, but not just yet.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:07.400
 So this is a very exciting special one off. If you want to see her and enjoy it live, you can do that from the confines of your home because we are streaming the gig live.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:39.400
 So yeah, do do that. And until then, just enjoy secretly this extra special compilation bonus. So here we go. On with the show.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:50.400
 [Music]

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:59.400
 Sorry, I thought you had the number on your hand down and it says, but for my glance, I thought it said 2023 and I thought you were rebinding yourself of what you.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.400
 [Laughter]

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:10.400
 It's temporary tattoo every year. It's my debit card. It's pin. Oh, well, I'll cut that out.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.400
 [Laughter]

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.400
 Are you not worried someone's going to cut your hand off?

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.400
 Funnily enough, no. I sort of thought I don't have enough money in my account for that to be a thing.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.400
 It's not like this is being recorded or anything. With cameras around.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:36.400
 And I've got a bone to pick with the movies because I thought that a lot of cowboys, I think it's very rare to see anyone that's non-white as a cowboy in a movie.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:44.400
 And it turns out that one in four Texan cowboys were African American. The number of Mexican cowboys were even more than that.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.400
 Yet we've whitewashed the whole thing in the movies.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.400
 Yeah, that's the movies for you.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.400
 That's John Wayne for you and that's Clint Eastwood. It's all those movies are completely whitewashed.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:03.400
 There's a lot of effort in America right now to readdress with the stories of anyone who was non-white to say they actually were a huge part of it.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:09.400
 It was still horrific. It wasn't like the sense of a cowboy is that you're a loner doing your own thing.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.400
 They were still slave cowboys and so on.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.400
 Have you heard of the Hawaiian cowboys?

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:20.400
 This was a huge thing and a big element of and again way before the wild west era, the frontier stuff.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:27.400
 So Hawaii didn't have what Hawaii had a bit of a slow start in the cowboy states because there were no large animals on Hawaii until the end of the 18th century.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.400
 So there was no need basically.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:38.400
 But then there were cows brought over in 1793. They were brought to King Kamehameha and they were they were protected and they were bred, you know, very intensively.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:49.400
 So you eventually had loads and loads of cows and the Hawaiian people then brought over a load of vaqueros, the Mexican cowboys to teach them the ways of the cow herding.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:56.400
 And the World Championship Radio Finals in 1908, the Hawaiian cowboy won one of those competitions.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.400
 And again, you don't think of a Hawaiian.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:07.400
 Yeah, they came first, second and sixth despite one of the team having an asthma attack halfway through, which is not what you want when you're riding a fucking Bronco or whatever.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.400
 I just need to get my inhaler.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:18.400
 I was reading the Kansas City Journal, we talked about the old days of the the Wild West kind of thing.

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.400
 But there was some cowboys who would get into lasso jewels.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.400
 Cool.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.400
 I would say lasso or lasso.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.400
 I say lasso.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.400
 I say lasso.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.400
 I say lasso.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.400
 You've been watching Ted Lasso.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.400
 You know a lot when I was researching this.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.400
 Yeah, in America, they call it lasso, don't they?

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.400
 Yeah.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.400
 And I think lasso, I think it comes from the Spanish lasso.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.400
 So I think you should call it lasso, but we do call it lasso.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.400
 No idea why.

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:51.400
 But anyway, yeah, you would, two people who wanted to duel against each other because something's gone wrong in their relationship would go on the horses.

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:52.400
 Yeah, okay, great.

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.400
 You'd all have a, you'd each have a lasso and you try and lasso the other guy and pull him off his horse.

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:58.400
 Okay.

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.400
 Nice.

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.400
 Not nice because then you drag him to his death.

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.400
 Oh, no.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.400
 Wow.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:05.400
 Yeah.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:10.400
 You see that a lot in movies where someone's tied at the feet with a lasso and then they're dragged to the ground.

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.400
 No, it looks a lot more fun.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.400
 It does.

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:14.400
 It looks really good.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.400
 A lot of things do.

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:16.400
 It looks really good.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:24.400
 Well, just while we're on books, puffin books, going back to what we were saying earlier, the original puffin books were published to explain war to children.

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.400
 Really?

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:26.400
 That was their first brief.

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.400
 Yeah, when they came out.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.400
 Are they like penguin, like one of the penguin?

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.400
 Yeah, like the kids version of, within the imprint of penguin.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.400
 So it was like the penguin book of war?

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.400
 Yes, a world war two.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.400
 No fiction.

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:43.400
 Yeah, it was, they would do books that like called The Clothes We Wear, which was explaining all about, you know, the industry and what was going on.

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.400
 There was Animals of the Countryside, Great Deeds of War.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:53.400
 These were all published in 1941 and it was there just to, it was kind of propaganda to an extent, but important propaganda sort of.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.400
 It's all important propaganda.

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:56.400
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:57.400
 That's true.

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:05.400
 Very rarely find good, very few good propaganda will admit that stuff is trivial and irrelevant.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:10.400
 But on the Saving Puffins, I read about a project that was dubbed the Pufferatze, which is the RSPV.

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:17.400
 RSPV Scotland appealed for public photos of puffins and basically got a massive data grab of puffins all over the country.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:22.400
 And what they were eating, that's how they found out that actually maybe they're not eating as nutritious meals as they once were.

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:26.400
 But I thought, what a great way to get more information, just be like, have you seen a puffin? Send me their photo.

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:27.400
 That's really good.

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:28.400
 That's a great name too.

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:29.400
 Pufferatze.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.400
 I got one more thing on puffins before we move on.

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:32.400
 Okay.

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.400
 This, because I found this really interesting.

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:40.400
 If you have a bird that lives near the equator, they tend to have big beaks.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:45.400
 And if you have one that lives in the north or in the south where it's colder, then they tend to have small beaks.

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:49.400
 And that is because they use their beak to get rid of heat.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:50.400
 Oh.

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:56.400
 Okay. So because there's lots of like vascul, vascals and blood that goes through those beaks in it.

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.400
 So it cools you down.

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:03.400
 Now the issue is puffins have big beaks and they live in the cold part of the world.

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:04.400
 So what is going on?

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:11.400
 And it turns out that the reason is that when they fly, they're flying such long distances and they're really, really beating their wings.

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.400
 They're creating loads and loads of energy.

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:18.400
 They're kind of getting really, really hot like you might do if you run around the park really, really fast.

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:19.400
 Yeah.

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.400
 So they're creating all this energy and they need to get rid of it.

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:26.400
 And they use their beaks to kind of get rid of this energy and keep them cool on the inside.

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:29.400
 And there was a guy called Dr. Elliott.

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:31.400
 I didn't get his first name.

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:41.400
 And he did some, some calculations and he reckoned that the amount of energy that you get from a single puffin flying around coming out of their beak is enough to light a light bulb.

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:42.400
 Wow.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:43.400
 That's amazing.

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:46.400
 So you could theoretically put a little light bulb on their beak.

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:47.400
 Yeah.

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:50.400
 And they'd be flying around and it'd be a beautiful light bulb.

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:51.400
 That's incredible.

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:53.400
 You know how they have drones instead of fireworks.

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:54.400
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:55.400
 You could do it with puffins.

00:07:55.400 --> 00:08:00.400
 I wonder if anyone's ever tried to breed puffins on the equator just to see how big the beaks get.

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.400
 Look, there's one fictional footballer we have to talk about.

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:03.400
 Yeah.

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:04.400
 Roy the Rovers.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:05.400
 Oh, yeah.

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:06.400
 I can't believe we haven't.

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:07.400
 Roy the Rovers.

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:14.400
 He's a cartoon comic strip character who started his career for Melchester Rovers.

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:16.400
 I thought he only ever played for Melchester.

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:17.400
 No, he moved to what?

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:18.400
 Walford Rovers.

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:19.400
 Oh, did he?

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:20.400
 The same borrower as EastEnders is filmed.

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:21.400
 Yeah.

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:22.400
 I know.

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:23.400
 Right.

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:24.400
 Anyway, he started in 1954.

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.400
 20 years later, he became a player manager.

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:27.400
 Lasted another 20 years.

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:28.400
 So 40 years playing.

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:29.400
 Good career.

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:30.400
 That is a good career.

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.400
 I believe that's a long footballing career.

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:37.400
 But because it's a comic strip, they just had, he had such a busy life, basically.

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:38.400
 Like so he married the club secretary.

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:40.400
 They had three kids, blah, blah, blah.

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:43.400
 His wife left him because he was spending too much time on the club, which made it onto national news.

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:44.400
 At the time it happened.

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:45.400
 Right.

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:48.400
 I think the 17s or 80s are a bit slower, apparently.

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:51.400
 He was kidnapped five times in his first 10 years as a footballer.

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:52.400
 Oh, that's a lucky one.

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:53.400
 It's very good.

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:54.400
 Lucky.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:59.400
 He was shot in his office by a mystery gunman.

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:02.400
 And that happened the year after on the TV show Dallas.

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:04.400
 JR Ewing was shot.

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:05.400
 Copycat offense.

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:06.400
 Yeah.

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:12.400
 Then in July '86, eight Rovers players died in a terrorist accident when they were on tour.

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:16.400
 He got away with a dislocated shoulder, but he was in a coma twice and his playing career

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:20.400
 ended when he got his left foot amputated after a helicopter crash in 1993.

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:21.400
 Wow.

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:22.400
 I know.

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:24.400
 That's the writer's room on acid.

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:25.400
 That really is.

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:30.400
 But I don't know if this is a well-known thing, but I didn't know that the president couldn't

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:31.400
 open windows.

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.400
 It's not allowed to open windows.

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:34.400
 Sorry.

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:36.400
 It's a security concern.

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:37.400
 It has to tell.

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:38.400
 Why?

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:40.400
 Because they...

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.400
 Will fall out.

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:45.400
 Wonder where Shudo might be waiting.

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:49.400
 Someone might be there or there might be somebody hanging around trying to get in or whatever.

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:50.400
 Oh, right.

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:51.400
 Yeah.

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:52.400
 And it was...

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:54.400
 I think Michelle Obama said that she was...

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:55.400
 It was a special day.

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:56.400
 She was given a treat.

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:59.400
 I can't remember what happened that day, but she was allowed to have the windows open.

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:01.400
 I said she was allowed to open the windows herself.

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:02.400
 For an afternoon.

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:04.400
 I think that they were opened for her.

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:05.400
 For her.

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:06.400
 Yeah, yeah.

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:07.400
 What a treat.

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:09.400
 Because they're so conscious of safety.

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:10.400
 And then when...

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:11.400
 I don't know.

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:12.400
 Clinton, when he went...

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:13.400
 He loved jogging.

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:14.400
 Right.

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:15.400
 And he refused.

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:18.400
 They tried to make him a jogging track inside the grounds of the White House.

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:19.400
 He was like, "No, no, no.

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:20.400
 I want to go out and jog."

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.400
 And he was like, "I want to be with the people."

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:26.400
 And you can imagine how the president of the United States just going on a jog through

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:28.400
 the park and people jogging with him.

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:29.400
 The secret service lost their mind.

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:30.400
 So weird.

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.400
 Because we've said before on this, I'm sure we must have done that.

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:33.400
 They used to.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:36.400
 You used to be able to just go to the White House and shake the hand of the president.

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:37.400
 That's so weird.

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:38.400
 Yeah, yeah.

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:40.400
 Until it wasn't that real.

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:41.400
 Someone died.

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:42.400
 Someone got killed, didn't they?

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:44.400
 I can't remember which president it was.

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:48.400
 One of them got assassinated by someone who went to shake the hand, but they had a gun in

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:49.400
 the hand and shot them.

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:50.400
 Oh, really?

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:51.400
 Not Garfield?

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:52.400
 No.

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:53.400
 Don't recall.

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:54.400
 Garfield was shot by someone turning out.

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:55.400
 Yeah.

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:56.400
 No, I know who it was.

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:57.400
 There's one more.

00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:58.400
 There's one more president.

00:10:58.400 --> 00:10:59.400
 McKinley.

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:00.400
 It was McKinley.

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:01.400
 Right, yeah.

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:02.400
 Because McKinley used to keep a coronation on him.

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:03.400
 And he was always...

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:04.400
 It was his lucky coronation.

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:05.400
 He had one on.

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:06.400
 He felt bad luck was with him.

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:07.400
 So always wore one.

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:10.400
 And moments before he was assassinated, he gave his flower to a little girl.

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:15.400
 And literally, like a minute later, this guy shoots him and kills him.

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:16.400
 Yeah.

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:17.400
 And there were no doctors around.

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:21.400
 So he went to hospital and he had to be looked after by a gynecologist who was looking at

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:22.400
 the wound.

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:26.400
 I can't see a head.

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:28.400
 Guys, that's really interesting.

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:30.400
 I didn't know all those bits.

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:33.400
 I'm going off the top of my head here, but I'm pretty sure that that's all.

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:34.400
 That's amazing.

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:35.400
 It's all right.

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:38.400
 And there was one president who escaped through the window when there was a little riot there.

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:44.400
 Well, it's a good thing they had an institute in this no window room.

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:47.400
 I was looking into name changes that happened by accident.

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:49.400
 Most famously, autocorrect.

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:50.400
 Yeah.

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:51.400
 Autocorrect.

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:52.400
 Such a fun thing.

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:53.400
 So this is amazing.

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:55.400
 The creator of autocorrect, who was a guy called...

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:59.400
 Or at least the person who's attributed as the main creator of autocorrect.

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:02.400
 Guy called Dean Hatchimovich or Hatchimovich.

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:07.400
 Even when he meets people, he autocorrects their name by accident.

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:14.400
 So the guy writing the article, in the article, the writer who's called Gideon goes up to

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.400
 Dean, puts his hand up, says, "Dean."

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:17.400
 And he says, "Gabriel."

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:19.400
 And he goes, "No, no, it's Gideon."

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:21.400
 And Dean goes, "I'm so sorry, autocorrect.

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:22.400
 I just do that.

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:23.400
 I just naturally...

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:24.400
 Really?

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:25.400
 I remember."

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:26.400
 Yeah.

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:27.400
 So he says he's got autocorrect going.

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:28.400
 That's bizarre.

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:30.400
 I know it's bizarre, but that's what he says, right?

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:32.400
 And he's not a...

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:33.400
 I know.

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:34.400
 It's not a fun.

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:35.400
 I know.

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:38.400
 He's a human, right?

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:42.400
 He autocorrects people's names and then apologizes.

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:43.400
 So...

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:49.400
 Is he okay?

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:50.400
 But autocor...

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:51.400
 That's not autocorrect.

00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:53.400
 That's auto-incorrect as well.

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:54.400
 Yes.

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:55.400
 Well, no.

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:56.400
 That was the thing.

00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:03.400
 So, a lot of the problems with autocorrect is that initially it was to do with trying to predict where you were going with something.

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:07.400
 But in the early days, they used to use the prank as well.

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:08.400
 So you could go...

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:11.400
 He went to his daughter's school, for example, and while he was at his daughter's school,

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:13.400
 he was doing a presentation, got into the computer,

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:16.400
 and made it so that any time that the teacher had to email him about his daughter,

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:20.400
 the autocorrect of her name would change to The Pretty Princess.

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:22.400
 And there was nothing she just kept saying.

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:23.400
 So he's...

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:24.400
 This is the same guy?

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:28.400
 This is before autocorrect was a solid system where it do its own thing.

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:32.400
 You could hack into it and you could change what you wanted for the autocorrecting to be.

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:33.400
 Yeah.

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:40.400
 But there was a guy who officially gave him the idea for how rude words should no longer be allowed to be part of autocorrect.

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:44.400
 Because a man wrote in saying, "You've changed my name to Bill Vagina."

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:46.400
 And it's not Bill Vagina.

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:47.400
 And it keeps changing.

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:48.400
 That was the inspiration.

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:54.400
 And they created what was known as the words which should neither be flagged nor suggested list as a result of this.

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:55.400
 Yeah.

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:56.400
 My name isn't Bill Vagina.

00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:59.400
 It's HSBC, our corporate wankers.

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:12.400
 But actually, that is a thing about autocorrect that I hate because I swear a lot.

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:25.400
 And the amount of time that I'm talking, who had ever needed to be talking?

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:27.400
 Just people who were trying to find out if you were a witch or not.

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:29.400
 That's actually the only time in history, is it?

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:32.400
 Can I tell you some Lancashire dialect that I didn't know?

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:33.400
 Oh, yeah.

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:36.400
 So I found a really old book of Lancashire dialect words.

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:38.400
 So, bants.

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:40.400
 If you say someone's got a lot of bants.

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:42.400
 B-A-N-T-S.

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:43.400
 Oh, yeah.

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:44.400
 Top bants.

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:46.400
 What does it mean in Lancashire?

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:48.400
 Someone's got a lot of bants.

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:49.400
 Top bants.

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:51.400
 You can't work this out logically, I'm afraid.

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:52.400
 And it's Lancashire.

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:53.400
 Lancashire, yeah.

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:54.400
 Bants.

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:55.400
 Bants.

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:57.400
 Is it like Cockney rhyming slang?

00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:58.400
 Is it working that way?

00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:00.400
 Not this one, no.

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:02.400
 It just means you've got a lot of strength.

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:04.400
 If you're really strong, you've got a lot of bants.

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:05.400
 Okay, right.

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:07.400
 This one you might be able to get.

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:08.400
 Balls out.

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:09.400
 Balls out.

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:10.400
 Balls out.

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:11.400
 Balls out.

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:12.400
 Balls out.

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:13.400
 Is that courage?

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:14.400
 Yeah, yeah.

00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:17.400
 I think it's so hot you've got to get your balls out.

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:21.400
 Remind me not to go on holiday.

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:24.400
 No, it means to call out.

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:26.400
 To call out, like to ball, to shout.

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:29.400
 So your mum might balls out.

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:30.400
 Balls out.

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:31.400
 Sons out.

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:32.400
 Balls out, mother.

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:33.400
 Sons out.

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:34.400
 Guns out.

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:35.400
 Balls out.

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:36.400
 Yeah.

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:37.400
 Isn't she saying come in for your tea?

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:38.400
 Yeah, kind of.

00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:39.400
 She shouts balls out.

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:40.400
 No, she bows out.

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:41.400
 Oh, she would be just balls out.

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:42.400
 Okay, yeah, yeah.

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:43.400
 She balls out.

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:44.400
 Oh, yeah, that makes sense.

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:45.400
 Yeah, yeah, okay.

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:46.400
 A wankle is a wobbly horse.

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:49.400
 Sorry, what is a wobbly horse?

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:50.400
 A wankle.

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:51.400
 Oh, okay, thank you.

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:54.400
 It's a horse that kind of wobbles a little bit.

00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:56.400
 Like a wooden horse or an actual horse.

00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:57.400
 No, an actual horse.

00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:58.400
 Maybe a bit lame or...

00:15:58.400 --> 00:15:59.400
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:00.400
 Okay.

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:01.400
 Isn't there a wankle engine?

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:02.400
 That's after a guy called Wankle.

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:03.400
 Right, right, right.

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:04.400
 I think the wankle engine.

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:07.400
 Yeah, I got a million more of those.

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:08.400
 I think we've reached the end of them.

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:11.400
 Here's a Wigan joke.

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:13.400
 This will explain what a Wigan accent is like.

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:16.200
 A man goes to the vets and says, "My cat's not well.

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:17.400
 Can you have a look at it?"

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:19.400
 The vet says, "Is it a tom?"

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:21.400
 And the man says, "No, it's a basket."

00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:22.400
 That's good.

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:23.400
 Oh, that's really nice.

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:24.400
 It's at home.

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:26.400
 Yeah, that's how Wigan people talk.

00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:27.400
 That's very good.

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:28.400
 Nice.

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:31.400
 Definitely see like a linguist at a university opening a lecture with that.

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:33.400
 See, it's a bit of fun.

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:36.400
 We're going to have fun, guys.

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:43.400
 I'm at Bridlington's only after a platform.

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:51.400
 It is, of course, a hometown of glorious comedians.

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:52.400
 Rosie.

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:53.400
 Yeah.

00:16:53.400 --> 00:17:03.400
 But from that, I love that it is the lost capital of Europe.

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:04.400
 Really?

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:05.400
 Yeah.

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:08.400
 What most lobsters fish there?

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:09.400
 Yeah.

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:10.400
 Yeah.

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:25.400
 So, and you see it at 5 a.m., there's so many lobsters that come especially from Spain.

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:31.400
 They get all the lobsters and take them back.

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:39.400
 So, if you're in Raleigh right now, jumping down on the rail,

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:43.400
 lobsters, you're welcome.

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:46.400
 It's from Bridlington.

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:47.400
 That's amazing.

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:48.400
 That's so cool.

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:50.400
 The second tallest man in the world is a Paralympian.

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:51.400
 What events?

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:52.400
 Does he?

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:54.400
 He is in Sit Down Volleyball.

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:55.400
 Oh.

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:58.400
 This is quite fun because he does have a tall torso.

00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:00.400
 So, that's where he's got a lot of his height.

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:04.400
 But he's not fully utilizing the entire length of his body.

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:06.400
 You've got to keep a buttock on the ground though, haven't you?

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:07.400
 Yes, that's right.

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:08.400
 Really?

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:09.400
 Yeah.

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:12.400
 I can't remember why or an edge of a buttock.

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:15.400
 There's some that you can't like jump, really.

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:16.400
 Yes.

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:17.400
 I guess so.

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:18.400
 Yeah.

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:19.400
 I can never call them.

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:20.400
 I don't know.

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:21.400
 That's tough.

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:29.400
 I don't know what classification that is.

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:30.400
 No bum.

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:31.400
 No bum, yeah.

00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:35.400
 That's Stephen Fry's favorite joke that he used to always say.

00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:38.400
 He said, "Yesterday I was walking the field and I picked a buttock up."

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:41.400
 I don't know who left all those buttocks there.

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:43.400
 There it is.

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:53.400
 In Harvard, the university, in 1950, you could not get a diploma unless you had passed a test

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:55.400
 in rope descending.

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:56.400
 Why?

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:58.400
 Riddle me that, Rosie.

00:18:58.400 --> 00:18:59.400
 Yeah.

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:04.400
 So rope descending, is that like abseiling or is it just climbing down a…

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:06.400
 It's climbing down a rope, I'm afraid to say.

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:07.400
 It's not ziplining.

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:08.400
 OK.

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:10.400
 It's in the same territory.

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:12.400
 Do you have a good reason that we have to get…

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:13.400
 Oh, well let's go.

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:14.400
 We can get it.

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:15.400
 We can get it.

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:16.400
 Not in a million years.

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:17.400
 Hang on, so it's Harvard.

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:18.400
 It's Harvard.

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:19.400
 Yeah.

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:21.400
 Is it to get down from the unicycle?

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:23.400
 No, I've got it.

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:32.400
 There is an exam room underground but there's no stairs.

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:33.400
 Yeah.

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:34.400
 No.

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:37.400
 It's like those clever interview questions they ask.

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:38.400
 Yeah.

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:43.400
 Guys, I know this is because Harvard's a very old educational institution.

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:45.400
 They'll have some churches on site.

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:49.400
 They will have a bell tower and you've got to be able to get down from the bell tower.

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:51.400
 Yeah, famously by ropes.

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:55.400
 Bell ringers are always at the top of the tower, aren't they?

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:56.400
 They do the ropes by hand.

00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:57.400
 Yeah.

00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:58.400
 Yeah, and then they climb down.

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:01.400
 The ropes actually were just to get down from the bells.

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:02.400
 Right.

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:04.400
 And then that's how bell ringing was invented, of course.

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:05.400
 Yeah.

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:06.400
 I thought, what if we just use the rope?

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:07.400
 Stayed off the ground.

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:08.400
 From down here.

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:09.400
 Yeah, that's clever.

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:10.400
 Is that it?

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:12.400
 No, it's because the dorms didn't have fire exits.

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:13.400
 Oh.

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:17.900
 And when you came to Harvard, each freshman was given a rope in their room to help them

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:19.400
 get down from…

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:20.400
 What?

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:21.400
 In case there was a fire?

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:22.400
 That's clever.

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:23.400
 Isn't that amazing?

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:28.400
 That is why I didn't go to Harvard.

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:32.400
 And they wanted me.

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:36.400
 They were begging me.

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:43.400
 One of my favourite sports is called murder ball.

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:44.400
 Oh, yeah.

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:49.400
 And it is a wheelchair rugby.

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:55.400
 And if you haven't seen it, watch a clip.

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:57.400
 It is brutal.

00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:04.400
 It's a rugby, but other people are having wheelchair.

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:10.400
 It's one of the only sports which is mixed.

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:11.400
 Oh, right.

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:24.400
 So you have men and women on the same team, and literally the players will run into people

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:31.400
 and they will come flying out of their wheelchair.

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:46.400
 And my favourite fact is it's the only sport that on the team they officially have a world.

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:47.400
 Oh, wow.

00:21:47.400 --> 00:22:00.400
 There's a world around the sidelines ready and when there's a great crash they will run

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:05.400
 on world of wheelchair back together.

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:06.400
 Live welding.

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:07.400
 And carry on.

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:09.400
 I'm loving that.

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:13.760
 They also, it's a sport that has two different types of wheelchairs.

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:17.760
 You have offensive wheelchairs and defensive wheelchairs.

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:31.880
 So the offensive ones, the offensive wheelchairs have a round bumper on it, so for the crashes

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:36.760
 when those are happening and then the defensive ones have a bumper protruding from it.

00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:39.760
 They don't have like sauce and stuff like a robot was.

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:43.760
 I just want to see what this welder does.

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:47.760
 Do you know that in 1879 the word zipline existed?

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:48.760
 Go on.

00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:50.760
 Can you guess what it meant?

00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:55.760
 So the fly of a trouser, maybe they had a zip on your trousers there and the zipline was

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:57.760
 a sewing term clothing.

00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:04.760
 In the 30s and 40s you'll see newspaper articles like adverts for zipline dresses and stuff.

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:09.760
 It was used like that, but before that had another meaning.

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:13.760
 Is it when you told people to shut up, you did the zipline as a motion across the mouth?

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:14.760
 You're really close actually.

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:15.760
 Ah, interesting.

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:18.760
 But would the zip have been invented to tell people to zip it?

00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:22.760
 No, that was invented in the early 20th century, I think the zip wasn't it.

00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:26.760
 Was that because of zippy or did zippy come retrospective of zip it?

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:30.760
 I don't think they're really in the same referential universe.

00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:31.760
 No, I know.

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:35.760
 I saw a bin lorry go past with a zippy on it on the front of it this morning.

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:36.760
 It was really upsetting.

00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:37.760
 Oh, yeah.

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:39.760
 I think you're not...

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:41.760
 Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:45.760
 Is it a cigar?

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:47.760
 That looks like it.

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:50.760
 The stitched lines look like a zip, don't they?

00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:51.760
 No.

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:52.760
 Can you tell us?

00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:53.760
 It is.

00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:59.760
 It was a strap that you used to hit children with in school if they were being naughty.

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:00.760
 Now, that's...

00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:01.760
 I should have got that.

00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:02.760
 But this is more interesting.

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:04.760
 Why did they call it a zipline?

00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:06.760
 Is it the mark that it would have left?

00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:07.760
 No.

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:08.760
 Okay, okay.

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:09.760
 Zip.

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:10.760
 Zip line.

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:11.760
 Zip line.

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:12.760
 Zip line.

00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:13.760
 Zip line.

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:14.760
 Zip line.

00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:15.760
 Supplying?

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:17.760
 Supply teachers were the ones who...

00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:21.760
 No, it was short for discipline.

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:23.760
 And they got rid of the...

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:28.760
 So they called it a discipline thing and then they called it a zipline thing and then they called it a zipline

00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:30.760
 and then a zipline.

00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:31.760
 Wow.

00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:34.760
 That is a long journey.

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:39.760
 It felt longer than that.

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:40.760
 But I was looking into Altdorf.

00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:41.760
 So there's about...

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:45.760
 As of 1990, there was about 9,000 people there from the census from around then.

00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:46.760
 So you would think there's...

00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:49.760
 Are there any other notable people outside of William Tell?

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:54.760
 So I looked into it just to see if there were any other famous Altdorfians.

00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:57.760
 And there's a bunch of athletics people.

00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:00.760
 So there's people who ride bikes, have been in the Olympics and all that sort of stuff.

00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:01.760
 But the most interesting ones...

00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:02.760
 Cyclists.

00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:03.760
 Is that what they call it?

00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:06.760
 No, athletic bikemen.

00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:10.760
 So the one that I found most interesting was Henry Haller.

00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:14.760
 And Henry Haller, he was born in Altdorf and he was a chef.

00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:18.760
 And he was the main chef for five presidents at the White House.

00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:23.760
 So from Lyndon B. Johnson through to Ronald Reagan, from a town that had at his time like 5,000 people,

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:26.760
 he goes to be the chief executive chef at the White House.

00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:30.760
 And he would do everything from obviously making huge state dinners,

00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:34.760
 all the way down to like Lyndon Johnson's daughter's school lunchbox,

00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:36.760
 making the tuna sandwiches and so on.

00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:40.760
 I kind of feel like not to do down his achievement, but sort of the era that he was cooking in.

00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:42.760
 You could get away with kind of normal cooking.

00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:45.760
 It's a cool job, but like, I don't think he was cooking the most like a main...

00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:48.760
 Yeah, I guess so. LBJ, JFK.

00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:49.760
 Yeah.

00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:50.760
 You know what I mean? Back in the day, that's like...

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:51.760
 Nixon.

00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:52.760
 Reagan.

00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:55.760
 I feel like Jimmy Carter would have had some interesting tastes.

00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:59.760
 But I mean, in terms of like quality of food and the perception and style of food,

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:01.760
 there's not really like, there's fewer ingredients available.

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:03.760
 I think the 70s was rubbish. That's what you're saying.

00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:04.760
 Yeah, basically, yeah.

00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:06.760
 No, but you had global dignitaries coming in.

00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:09.760
 So you were having to make things that sat aside a palette that was a bit more global.

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:13.760
 And he did have opinions about that because they all wanted different like,

00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:16.760
 some of the president's wives wanted menus had different colors

00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:20.760
 and so he had to redo all the menus or more tapioca pudding with the big demand.

00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:22.760
 That's a printer issue.

00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:25.760
 He was in charge of it, I guess, as well.

00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:27.760
 Sounds like Fenty Towers.

00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:30.760
 He's running in and out of the kitchen with different colors of menus.

00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:32.760
 What's the bear's erection on this menu?

00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:35.760
 Oh, go you!

00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:40.760
 But he said that the Democrats were harder when the Democrats were in power

00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:44.760
 to cater for than the Republicans because the Republicans would have guests

00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:47.760
 that were very much of a type. They all had the same sort of palette.

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:50.760
 Whereas Democrats were always going and hanging out with truckers

00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:52.760
 like, you know, they were like more friends of the people.

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:56.760
 And so he said that you were constantly having to change the type of...

00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:58.760
 I know you'd think that would make it easier, but actually...

00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:00.760
 I really changed with Trump, didn't I?

00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:02.760
 That picture of him in front of all the McDonald's and the White House

00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:04.760
 is my favorite picture in the world.

00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:06.760
 That's your favorite picture in the world.

00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:10.760
 There are so many millions, billions of images in the world.

00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:12.760
 It's more than ever these days.

00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:14.760
 The images of my friends and family.

00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:18.760
 No, it was the fragile earth hanging in space.

00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:22.760
 Your beautiful sea creatures that we've never caught on camera before.

00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:24.760
 I just think every time I look at it, it makes me laugh.

00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:30.760
 That funeral card where it's going, "Why is Trump and McDonald's?"

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:34.760
 Rumour is an interesting word that kept cropping up during this research

00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:41.760
 where it's anyone who is a famous model railway collector or builder.

00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:43.760
 You've given it away. You just said "roddle".

00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:45.760
 No, I don't think he's going to do it.

00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:48.760
 No, we have talked about Rod Stewart in the past.

00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:52.760
 He's very unashamedly a collector and a builder.

00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:54.760
 He talks about it when he's on things like The One Show.

00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:56.760
 But other people, it says Michael Jordan, basketball player.

00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:58.760
 Rumour to have...

00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:00.760
 A secret mill basically.

00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:02.760
 Yeah, exactly.

00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:04.760
 Frank Sinatra.

00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:07.760
 Rumour to be a model railway enthusiast.

00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:09.760
 Had a room in his house called All Abored.

00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:11.760
 Or did he? We don't know.

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:16.760
 I mean, it's so weird. There's so many celebrities who supposedly build model railways.

00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:18.760
 But we don't know.

00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:21.760
 There is one who we do know, Rod Stewart, but also Neil Young.

00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:24.760
 He's not just a model railway enthusiast.

00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:28.760
 He has seven patents that he's listed as co-inventing.

00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:32.760
 Different switches and bits of technology and cameras and sound effects.

00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:34.760
 Neil Young the Rocker.

00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:36.760
 We have talked about this because he has...

00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:41.760
 He's so loyal as his pseudonym for his railway-making life.

00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:44.760
 The part of it is because his sons have cerebral palsy.

00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:48.760
 And he's designed switches and buttons that are easier for them to use so they can operate.

00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:50.760
 Yeah, so it's called Ben.

00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:52.760
 So Ben, that's what was interesting about...

00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:56.760
 A lot of the model railways are a lot of dads and children building it.

00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:58.760
 And it's often associated with trauma.

00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:02.760
 I mean, I only found two cases, Eddie Azard and Neil Young.

00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:04.760
 But I thought that was quite interesting.

00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:07.760
 The children start building these things as a way to communicate with each other.

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:09.760
 Yeah, definitely.

00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:12.760
 He's got a thing that makes the train sounds.

00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:15.760
 When trains can now make sounds, partly dancing Neil Young.

00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:17.760
 Like, from afar. That's pretty cool.

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:20.760
 I once worked in an office that was also a cupboard.

00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:23.760
 Just to be on people who had to spend time in cupboards.

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:25.760
 My first ever work experience was in an office.

00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:28.760
 And the office they gave me was very clearly a cupboard.

00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:30.760
 Are you Philip Schofield?

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:32.760
 He used to work in the broom cupboard.

00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:34.760
 That's a joke for people of a certain age.

00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:36.760
 I wasn't sure where that was going.

00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:40.760
 I mean, all rooms are cupboards for humans in a way.

00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:41.760
 In a way.

00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:43.760
 Well, this was a cupboard for boxes.

00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:45.760
 It sounds like great work experience.

00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:48.760
 Was it one of these, like, oh, got the work experience guys here?

00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:50.760
 We don't really need to give him.

00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:53.760
 I had quite a technical and involved task to do,

00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:56.760
 but one that could be done from a cupboard.

00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:58.760
 Here's Ben on.

00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:00.760
 Are you Harry Potter?

00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:02.760
 Yeah.

00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:05.760
 I was working at Dursley Incorporated.

00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:07.760
 So what did you do? Counting boxes?

00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:11.760
 No, I was, it was something quite complex, actually,

00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:16.760
 but involved tearing and inserting very small pieces of card into a file system.

00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:19.760
 Did you work for News International?

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:22.760
 I had to shred it.

00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:25.760
 I had a load of compromises.

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:28.760
 I can't wait for your episode of Would I Lie to You.

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:31.760
 A money saving instead of buying appliances,

00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:33.760
 you just get free labor to do it all.

00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:36.760
 Paper setable up to a point.

00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:39.760
 You're crying. Why are you crying?

00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:41.760
 It's just the memories.

00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:47.760
 Okay, that's it. There you go.

00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:49.760
 Those are all of our outtakes.

00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:52.760
 If you want to get in contact with any of the people that were on the show,

00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:54.760
 all of us are on Twitter and Instagram,

00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:56.760
 so just go find our handles there.

00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:58.760
 And also, as a reminder,

00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:01.760
 we are going to be doing this live show on the 14th of September.

00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:04.760
 Anna Tyshinski is back with us, and so if you want to see her,

00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:06.760
 if you want to be part of it,

00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:12.760
 join in on the live stream by getting a ticket from nosuchthingasafish.com/live.

00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:13.760
 It's going to be a really fun night.

00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:16.760
 Balloons, possibly a cake, cards, maybe presents.

00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:17.760
 We'll see. We'll see what happens.

00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:19.760
 But it's going to be fun no matter what.

00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:20.760
 So that's it for now.

00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:22.760
 We'll be back in a couple of weeks with another bonus app.

00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:25.760
 So tune in again and see you soon.

00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:27.760
 Okay. Bye for now.

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:32.760
 (upbeat music)

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:37.760
 (upbeat music)
