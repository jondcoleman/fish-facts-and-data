1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,100
 In a year where much of the news was believable but THINK comes a book packed with stories that are unbelievable but true.

2
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,100
 *Clears throat*

3
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:13,100
 Sorry.

4
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:20,400
 Uh, hey everyone it's Dan here. Um, thank you for tuning in once again to this episode, the penultimate episode before Christmas.

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:27,100
 You're probably thinking, "What? I need to get out there. I need to stop listening to the podcast and think about what president buys someone. No, you don't."

6
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,700
 You know why? 'Cause you've got a book you need to buy.

7
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:34,100
 It's called The Book of the Year. It's the weirdest side of 2017. Isn't that right Andy?

8
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:41,400
 Oh yes, that's right Dan. Uh, it's a very, very exciting book about all of the most interesting things that happened this year.

9
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:47,800
 That's true Andy. Yeah, for example, did you guys know that 2000 bees were stolen in Beeston this year?

10
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,800
 That's a little British town, isn't it Anna?

11
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:57,200
 Yes, it is. It's a little tiny town in England called Beeston where they have lots of bees. It's ironic that that happened.

12
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:02,400
 It absolutely is Anna. And, uh, James, what's your favorite factor in the book?

13
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:09,400
 Grave of Throats and Santa World Record for most stuntmen on fire at the same time.

14
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:19,300
 It is a 350-page wonder book of insane knowledge from science stories to little-known facts about the bigger stories that happen this year.

15
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:24,700
 It's in shops now. It's also online. Still for Â£6 on Amazon. It is the ultimate Christmas book.

16
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:33,700
 So please do get the book and so for the last time that the four of us are going to be in the room before this Christmas episode comes out, let's all say it together, guys.

17
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,700
 On with the show. On with the show!

18
00:01:36,700 --> 00:02:00,700
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast this week coming to you from Wimbledon!

19
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:14,700
 My name is Dan Schreiber and I am sitting here with Anna Chazinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin.

20
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:24,700
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go.

21
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:43,700
 Very good. We'll keep it in. This week, starting with my fact, my fact this week is that the telephone dialing code for Cape Canaveral, the famous rocket launch site, is 3-2-1.

22
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,700
 Is that amazing?

23
00:02:45,700 --> 00:03:00,700
 This was changed in 1999 after a petition. Obviously Cape Canaveral, very famous for its connection to NASA, for rocket launching, for so on. They just said let's just have a new dialing telephone number and that's what it is now. 3-2-1.

24
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,700
 So cool.

25
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,700
 Thank you.

26
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,700
 But do they steal it off anyone?

27
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,700
 I think they did actually. There's a town that's really pissed off.

28
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:18,700
 I think they stole it off Chicago, didn't they? It was supposed to be Chicago. Yeah. So it nearly, it could have been 1-2-3. Do you know this?

29
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:23,700
 What you mean when they were launching rockets? Yeah. So NASA, they used to do account up.

30
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,700
 No.

31
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:28,700
 What until and when do they go when they get to like infinity or?

32
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:37,700
 The original thing. And this was, in fact, originally they got their cue from the films. So in films in the 20s and 30s, in space scenes, it went 1-2-3 and then when they got to 5 or 10 or whatever.

33
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:45,700
 They would go. But then when Fritz Lang released a film in 1929, he did 3-2-1 and the NASA borrowed from that.

34
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:46,700
 Oh really?

35
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:51,700
 And on count-ups instead of count-downs, the telegraph website, they did a counter.

36
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:58,700
 I think it was counting up to the royal wedding, the last royal wedding and it was just a counter and it's still counting up.

37
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:03,700
 And it's still counting up. You can go and see it and it's just on millions of seconds since the royal wedding happens.

38
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:10,700
 For what? For like, until it gets to divorce or... What are they? What's the end point?

39
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:13,700
 Nothing, there's no end point. It's just counting. It's just counting.

40
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:17,700
 It's just to help Prince William remember when his wedding anniversary is.

41
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:23,700
 Happy one million and 26,000 seconds, honey. Yeah, why would you need it?

42
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,700
 It's a flawed system. That's why I brought it up. All right.

43
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:33,700
 Kate Canaveral is really interesting. Do you know why it is where it is? It's obviously in Florida, on the coast of Florida.

44
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:43,700
 And there are two main reasons for it is positioning. And one is that when rockets take off, they can sort of steal a bunch of speed from the rotation of the earth.

45
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:50,700
 And the earth rotates fastest at the equator, right? Like if a ball's rotating, then the widest bit is going faster than the smallest bit.

46
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:57,700
 So when rockets take off, they sort of steal that speed, that acceleration as they're taking off, which really helps them.

47
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:03,700
 And also, they always go in line with the rotation of the earth. So they're going sort of from America towards Britain.

48
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:09,700
 And so that means if anything goes really badly wrong, it crashes into the sea, which doesn't hurt very many people.

49
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:15,700
 How can they never do that thing that they do in Formula One where you go behind someone and you get the tailwind speed?

50
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:18,700
 How come there's not like an initial rocket? That's a really good idea.

51
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:22,700
 I think now you've said it, they might do that. Is that scientific or what?

52
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,700
 I think we actually know one's thought of that before.

53
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,700
 Really?

54
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:29,700
 Or it could be the fact that each rocket costs about 100 million quid to mate.

55
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,700
 That's true, yeah.

56
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:39,700
 And do you actually know why the Russians really screwed us over in terms of this, you know, helping rockets get into space?

57
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:46,700
 Is that, you know, the ISS, the positioning of the ISS, is not on the equator, which is incredibly inconvenient.

58
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:50,700
 Because one of the things we want is for the ISS to be a stop-off point on the way to the moon.

59
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:58,700
 And so we'd stop off the ISS, get some food, have a picnic, refuel, have an app, and then you can jump onto the moon in future.

60
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:09,700
 And we can't do that because to appease the Soviet Union, we put the ISS sort of halfway between the latitude of Florida and halfway between their space station, which is way, way further north.

61
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:13,700
 And that actually means that the rotation effect doesn't give the acceleration to rockets that they need.

62
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:17,700
 I've not understood a single thing you've said in the last minute.

63
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,700
 Maybe we should talk about telephone numbers.

64
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,700
 Yeah, sure, yeah.

65
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:25,700
 So, Dan's telephone number is also...

66
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:34,700
 When they first came up with the idea of area codes and stuff like that, basically before that, you would kind of ring up an operator and say,

67
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,700
 "Put me through to Chicago, you know, whatever."

68
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:46,700
 But when they came up with a number system, there was an anti-digit dialing league who tried to stop the idea of having phone numbers, rather than phone words.

69
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:56,700
 And this was in America, and it was organized by a guy who, the internet calls, famed semanticist, "S.I. Hayekawa."

70
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:00,700
 And I want to be a famed semanticist, that's an amazing title.

71
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:09,700
 He said that of this idea of giving numbers rather than words, he said, "These people are systematically trying to destroy the use of memory."

72
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:10,700
 Wow.

73
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:20,700
 He says, "They tell you to write it down, but try writing a telephone number down in a dark booth while growing for a pencil and gasping for breath."

74
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,700
 What?

75
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,700
 Where is this phone booth?

76
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,700
 In a sulphur pit or something.

77
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,700
 They were super anti-they weren't they?

78
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,700
 They were.

79
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:37,700
 They thought it would be dehumanizing. There was, yeah, a bunch of leagues that were set up to attack the creeping humoralism, they called it, and the cult of technology.

80
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:46,700
 And actually, the man who came up with the idea that phone numbers should be numbers rather than a name, because all the letters were sort of getting used up by that point, all the three letter letters.

81
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:52,700
 So the man who came up with the idea of changing his order numbers was at a party once, and he was approached by someone who said,

82
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:55,700
 "How does it feel to be the most hated man in America?"

83
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:56,700
 Wow.

84
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:57,700
 Rough.

85
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,700
 That is bad.

86
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:17,700
 So these people who were from the anti-digit dialing league, they tried to protest by phoning up operators, and rather than giving them the number as anyone else does, they said, "Operator, get me S-I-Haya-Cawa at $4 billion, $155 million, $842,301."

87
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:20,700
 So they said all of their phone numbers as actual numbers.

88
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,700
 Oh, that's great.

89
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:25,700
 And they said, "If they want digits, we'll give them digits."

90
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:32,700
 And hanging up the phone was invented that day.

91
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:36,700
 Have you guys heard of a rapper called Soldier Boy?

92
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,700
 Yep.

93
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:38,700
 Because I haven't.

94
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:39,700
 No.

95
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,700
 I do know one thing about him.

96
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:47,700
 So when he was a lot younger, this is in 2009, he listed a phone number at the start of his song, Kiss Me Through The Phone.

97
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:53,700
 He just read out a string of phone numbers, 12 digit number, and as a result of him reading out that number,

98
00:08:53,700 --> 00:09:02,700
 a family in Oldham, who owned that number, got bombarded with 60 phone calls every day for months,

99
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,700
 saying, "Is Soldier Boy there, please?"

100
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:13,700
 And the householder was a woman called Catrion Howard Smith, and she said, "We just tell them that he doesn't live in Oldham."

101
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:17,700
 That's very similar to Bruce Almighty. You know the film Bruce Almighty?

102
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:18,700
 Yeah, Jim Kerry.

103
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:24,700
 Yeah, exactly where there was a real phone number used in Bruce Almighty that belonged to God.

104
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:30,700
 And the tradition is in America, if you're making a film, the real phone numbers that you use in the film start with 555,

105
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,700
 because then it won't be taken.

106
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:37,700
 But they sort of contravened this rule, and so they just said a number that actually existed.

107
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,700
 And the film Bruce Almighty got in real trouble.

108
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:47,700
 So the number was 2762323, and a bunch of people all across America got phone calls asking to be put through to God.

109
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:53,700
 And these numbers included, one of the numbers put people through to a church in North Carolina,

110
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:58,700
 and the other went through to a pastor in Wisconsin, and saying, "Can I please get through to God?"

111
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:02,700
 Because you would start thinking, wouldn't you? If you were a pastor and you've got a load of phone calls for God,

112
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:06,700
 you might start thinking, "I don't know, I'm not God."

113
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:10,700
 Is this how he would tell me?

114
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:16,700
 No, but I read an interview with one of the guys, one of the church pastors, and he did get the calls,

115
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:21,700
 and they would say, "Oh, is God there?" And then he would be able to go, "Actually, yes, he is."

116
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:24,700
 Actually, he's everywhere.

117
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,700
 But they changed it for the DVD release.

118
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:30,700
 Just in case he should not just read it out now.

119
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:37,700
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Chazinski.

120
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:42,700
 My fact this week is that the world's largest honeybees make hallucinogenic honey,

121
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:48,700
 and you're only allowed to collect this honey if you've had a specific dream.

122
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:52,700
 So, just after the beginning, these are Himalayan giant honeybees,

123
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:58,700
 and they make what's called mad honey, and they are collected by the Kulung people of Nepal.

124
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:03,700
 And at the moment, there's one collector left in this little community,

125
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,700
 who's a guy called Mowley Dan. He's the last honey collector.

126
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:10,700
 And he's got a bunch of apprentices who come with him on the honey collecting missions,

127
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:15,700
 but they're not allowed to actually extract those sort of hives from the cliff face.

128
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:19,700
 He has to let himself, because he's the only person who's had this dream.

129
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:23,700
 And the dream he had was 42 years ago, so he's been doing it for a while.

130
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,700
 He jumped, he was caught in a spider web, he was saved by a monkey,

131
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:30,700
 and he woke up, and it became clear to him that the monkey was a spirit garden

132
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,700
 called rang camey that they believe in.

133
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:37,700
 And so, that means rang camey is a spirit of bees and monkeys.

134
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:41,700
 And so, that meant rang camey was saying, "You can still our honey, and you'll be okay."

135
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:48,700
 And did the rest of the people go, "That guy's clearly nuts, he'll definitely be able to go down the side of a cliff and attack a bee hive."

136
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,700
 Maybe it was that.

137
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:55,700
 It was his father's father's father before him, but they have this serious problem now,

138
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:58,700
 because it's a real source of income, because it's quite valuable,

139
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,700
 but no one else has had the dream, so he's got this apprentice.

140
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:06,700
 And this apprentice says, "I really want to collect the honey on the really dangerous cliff face,

141
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:09,700
 but I just haven't had the dream."

142
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,700
 And you can't lie about the dream?

143
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,700
 Well, I know.

144
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,700
 No, what I mean is everyone here now knows about the dream.

145
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,700
 Does he not know about the dream?

146
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,700
 No, they all know about the dream, but of course you can't lie about the dream.

147
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,700
 This is a spiritual mission you've been given.

148
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,700
 The idea is that if you collect the honey without having had the dream,

149
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,700
 then you'll be cursed forever more.

150
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,700
 Why would you lie about it then?

151
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,700
 Yeah, it's done.

152
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:32,700
 Yeah, it's done.

153
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:33,700
 Sorry.

154
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:36,700
 Think about what you've done, Dan.

155
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,700
 It was a long article.

156
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,700
 I've been to a brainwash point.

157
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,700
 It's an amazing article.

158
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,700
 It was a national geographic, and I really would recommend it.

159
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,700
 It's really good.

160
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,700
 Do you know what else they do these bees?

161
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,700
 They do Mexican waves.

162
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,700
 They nest in the open, right?

163
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,700
 They have a single flat comb on the cliff face, okay?

164
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:56,700
 They nest out in the open, and they've got seven or eight layers of bees thick on the outside for warmth.

165
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:02,700
 And when a predator approaches, their method is to do a wave pointing their abdomens out into the air,

166
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:06,700
 so all their stingers are facing outwards, and they do it in a Mexican waveform.

167
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:11,700
 And that notifies the bees on the other side that there's a predator approaching, and they then do it too.

168
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,700
 Okay.

169
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,700
 Like the Mexican wave in football stadiums,

170
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,700
 notifies the people on the other end that there's a Mexican wave coming.

171
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,700
 Yes.

172
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,700
 But in that case, the predator is the Mexican wave.

173
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:30,700
 So this mad honey, it's from plants from the road to dendron plants.

174
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:31,700
 Is it something like that?

175
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:35,700
 Yes, it's bees that pollinate using the road to dendron plant in spring,

176
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,700
 which, and then that makes them make the mad honey.

177
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,700
 Right, but it's been known about for millennia, hasn't it?

178
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,700
 Like the Romans wrote about it, the Greeks wrote about it.

179
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:43,700
 Yeah.

180
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,700
 There was someone quite recently, a bit more recently, a married couple,

181
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:51,700
 who deliberately ate some mad honey for reasons of sexual performance.

182
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:54,700
 They'd been ringing the meningitis hotline, haven't they?

183
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:58,700
 But it's, yeah, it's said to be a sort of Niagara, isn't it?

184
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:02,700
 Yeah, so they had one teaspoon per day for a week.

185
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:07,700
 And then after a week, they decided to crank it up and had a full table spoon each.

186
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:11,700
 But unfortunately, that meant they suffered from confusion, chest pain,

187
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,700
 low blood pressure, and a slowed heartbeat.

188
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:18,700
 And they had to go to the hospital and it turned out they both had a mild heart attack.

189
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,700
 Whoa.

190
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,700
 God.

191
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,700
 Whoa.

192
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,700
 Yeah.

193
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,700
 Oh my god.

194
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,700
 No, not sexy.

195
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,700
 Okay.

196
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,700
 It could be worse.

197
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:32,700
 I read that if you have too much of it, that your body purges itself from both ends,

198
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:36,700
 and then you go intermittently blind, have a sound wave pulsing in your head,

199
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,700
 and then you'll paralyze for a day.

200
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,700
 Not sexy?

201
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:41,700
 Not sexy.

202
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:46,700
 Yeah, apparently you're suddenly seized at one point with the urge to simultaneously

203
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,700
 urinate, defecate, and vomit, and then you do all of those things.

204
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:53,700
 But then I think it's the purging process which creates the spiritual awakening.

205
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:56,700
 Have you guys heard of Dawson's bees?

206
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,700
 Dawson's bees.

207
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,700
 Dawson's bees.

208
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,700
 This is so cool.

209
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:03,700
 They are so aggressive that during their mating sessions, all the males bite each other

210
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,700
 to death.

211
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,700
 All of them.

212
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,700
 All of them.

213
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:07,700
 All of them.

214
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:08,700
 All of them.

215
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,700
 In the mating process.

216
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,700
 How does the mating happen then?

217
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,700
 Well, I think they've kind of mating and biting at the same time.

218
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,700
 But basically, all the males die.

219
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:15,700
 Not sexy.

220
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:16,700
 Not sexy.

221
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,700
 But sexual.

222
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,700
 Yeah.

223
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:19,700
 Yeah.

224
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:24,700
 So the entire generation of males is wiped out, and the only ones left behind are the females,

225
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,700
 and they just get along with each other fine.

226
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:31,700
 And then they raise the next generation of males who kill each other and leave the females

227
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,700
 to get on with it again.

228
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,700
 Wow.

229
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,700
 That's amazing.

230
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:38,700
 And, you know, it's something to take a note of, I suppose.

231
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:39,700
 Right?

232
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:40,700
 Yeah.

233
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:49,700
 I've read that a lot of honey that we buy in shops these days are not as honey-ish as they can be.

234
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:53,700
 They sort of get watered down in the process and they disguise it because it's very hard if

235
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:56,700
 you're just going through honey to be like, that's been watered down.

236
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,700
 And it's a big industry.

237
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,700
 It's like a mafia style industry.

238
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,700
 And they call it honey laundering.

239
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,700
 And they...

240
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:02,700
 Yeah.

241
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,700
 Genuinely, it's called honey laundering.

242
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,700
 And...

243
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,700
 It's so good.

244
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:06,700
 Yeah.

245
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:10,700
 Something like 75% of honey that we have in shops has been watered down.

246
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:11,700
 So it's not in its purest day.

247
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:12,700
 75%.

248
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,700
 I made that spin up.

249
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,700
 It was, yeah.

250
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,700
 It's a stat like that, kind of.

251
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,700
 Oh, yeah.

252
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,700
 There were Victorian honey launders.

253
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,700
 And they did exactly the same thing.

254
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:22,700
 And they would...

255
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:23,700
 I think it was just...

256
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,700
 They'd just use syrup or...

257
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:25,700
 Sometimes they'd just use glucose.

258
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:26,700
 They'd just pour it into a jar.

259
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:27,700
 And to...

260
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:31,700
 For added varietay, they would sprinkle in a couple of wings and legs.

261
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,700
 So you were thinking, "Ah, good. This is proper honey."

262
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:39,700
 There was someone who got in trouble for stealing honey in 2008, actually.

263
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,700
 And this was in Macedonia.

264
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:47,700
 And this was a bear who was convicted in a core of criminal damage for stealing honey.

265
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:51,700
 So the case was brought by this beekeeper and this bear had been stealing his bee constantly.

266
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,700
 Stealing his bee, stealing his honey.

267
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:54,700
 Constantly.

268
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:57,700
 And eventually he reported the bear.

269
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:01,700
 The first thing he tried was to play loud, Serbian, turbo folk music.

270
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,700
 Catherine.

271
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:06,700
 So, yeah, he took the bear to court.

272
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,700
 And the bear didn't actually turn up in court.

273
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:11,700
 And so the state had to pay the fine.

274
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,700
 It was about 1,800 pounds.

275
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:16,700
 Imagine being the cellmate who gets stuck in with the bear.

276
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:19,700
 What are you even for, mate?

277
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:25,700
 Got caught in a honey trap.

278
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:40,700
 Well, sometimes a pun is so good, you just need to sit in silence and respect it.

279
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:44,700
 Did you know the bees were sent up on Interspace in 1984?

280
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:47,700
 As they had been a few times, I think, but they were sent on a challenger flight.

281
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:51,700
 And there were 3,300 bees in space.

282
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:54,700
 They were housing this little box and it was to see how they dealt with zero gravity

283
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,700
 and whether they built a decent enough hive and stuff.

284
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:01,700
 And they did really well, actually, they built a nearly normal comb, according to NASA.

285
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:05,700
 But bees are very clean, so they don't like to excrete inside their hive.

286
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,700
 They always go out to wee.

287
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:10,700
 And in this challenger thing, they were just stuck in their hive the whole time.

288
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:16,700
 So even though they were there for a full week and they're excreting, you know, every hour, usually, they held it all in.

289
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,700
 Yeah, they sucked it up.

290
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:22,700
 They waited and then they just had an explosive time as soon as they got back to Earth, I guess.

291
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,700
 But yeah, there was no excreting.

292
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:29,700
 The NASA spokesperson said when the hive got back from space, it was as clean as a pin.

293
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:30,700
 Really?

294
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:31,700
 Yeah.

295
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:34,700
 One minute later, it was not as clean as that.

296
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:37,700
 Well, just on bee, specifically honey bee, genitalia.

297
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:42,700
 I was reading about their sex life, and Andy, yes, it is sexy.

298
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:45,700
 They, oh no, no, I've just remembered what it is.

299
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:52,700
 They have sex, and the ejaculation is so intense for them, their penis explodes.

300
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:57,700
 Nice, true. There's actually an audible pop that humans can hear.

301
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:58,700
 Whoa!

302
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,700
 What, where are you?

303
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:08,700
 You're listening in on a stethoscope of against the life.

304
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,700
 We should move on to our third fact, guys.

305
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:16,700
 Okay, it is time for our third fact of the show, and that is James Harkin.

306
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:21,700
 Okay, my fact this week is the man who invented the pink flamingo garden ornament

307
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:26,700
 dressed in matching clothes with his wife for 35 years.

308
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,700
 It's amazing.

309
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,700
 It's so weird.

310
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,700
 Is it weird, or is it sweet?

311
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,700
 Sweet, it's sweet.

312
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:36,700
 Okay, cheer for weird.

313
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,700
 Oh.

314
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:40,700
 Cheer for sweet.

315
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,700
 Extremely female cheer for sweet, wasn't it?

316
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,700
 It's so incredible.

317
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,700
 Sorry.

318
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:49,700
 Like, even when they were in different places, she would pack his suitcase

319
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:52,700
 and tell him what to wear on each day, so they felt closer to each other.

320
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:53,700
 Yeah, yeah.

321
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,700
 That wouldn't make me feel closer to my partner, of course they.

322
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:01,700
 That would make me feel like I needed to reassess the relationship.

323
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,700
 But there was an interview with this guy's wife.

324
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:06,700
 He was called Donald Fedestone, and he died in 2015.

325
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:11,700
 There was an interview with his wife, and she said that Donald proposed on their first date

326
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,700
 and they've been together almost all the time since.

327
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,700
 Wow.

328
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,700
 They didn't go apart that much.

329
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:21,700
 And they said, we find it funny when we're watching those crime shows.

330
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,700
 And they say, what was he worrying when you last saw him?

331
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:29,700
 If it was us, we could point to ourselves and say, this.

332
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:35,700
 I must be so far watching TV with them.

333
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:41,700
 Hey, by the way, we should just quickly explain the absolute cultural

334
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,700
 massiveness of this character.

335
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,700
 He created these pink flamingo ornaments.

336
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,700
 Picture that ornament in your head.

337
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,700
 That's the one that he invented.

338
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:55,700
 Well, thanks for clarifying that, Dan.

339
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:56,700
 Picture the other one.

340
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,700
 That's not the one.

341
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,700
 It was the one you thought of thirst.

342
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:04,700
 And that, so he created the pink flamingo, and it was ginormous.

343
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:10,700
 I mean, it was small, but the production line of it was ginormous.

344
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,700
 They sold a fuckload of them.

345
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,700
 There's something like 50 million out there in the world.

346
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:18,700
 And it was a casting mold that he made of a flamingo.

347
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,700
 And he'd done lots of different animals.

348
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:23,700
 And they all had mild success, but not flamingo success.

349
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,700
 Charlie, the duck was quite big.

350
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:28,700
 Yeah, the duck was bigger than the flamingo for three decades.

351
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:29,700
 What?

352
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,700
 80s that the flamingo overtook the duck.

353
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,700
 Which I can't even picture the duck.

354
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:36,700
 Just imagine that duck.

355
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:39,700
 He did that.

356
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,700
 And he based on a real duck, didn't he?

357
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:45,700
 That he bought a duck and he kept it in his sink.

358
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,700
 He built a model of this duck.

359
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,700
 Probably really unhappy looking duck.

360
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,700
 But he tried to sell.

361
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,700
 Yeah, called Charlie.

362
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,700
 And he set it up with mirrors in his words.

363
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:57,700
 So it would think it had friends.

364
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,700
 This is the best couple ever.

365
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:00,700
 This is so exciting.

366
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:04,700
 They also had, because so they had four different wardrobes,

367
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,700
 physical built wardrobes in their house.

368
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:10,700
 And in each wardrobe was the different season that they had

369
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:13,700
 of the clothing relative to the season.

370
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,700
 So it's summer time.

371
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,700
 Let's go to wardrobe number two, and they would open it.

372
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:19,700
 And there would be the matching his costume and then her costume.

373
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:22,700
 And then the next version of the matching his her costume.

374
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:27,700
 And then they had a special fifth cupboard that was specifically

375
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,700
 for the flamingo-based outfits.

376
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:30,700
 Oh.

377
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:31,700
 Was it?

378
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,700
 And they would occasionally go to the fifth cupboard and go

379
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,700
 it's flamingo day.

380
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,700
 And they would.

381
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:39,700
 And they would wear it.

382
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,700
 And just on garden ornaments.

383
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,700
 Yeah.

384
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,700
 Do you know what the first garden ornaments were?

385
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,700
 Or these were very early garden ornaments.

386
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,700
 I don't know if they were first.

387
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,700
 Like gnomes?

388
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,700
 They were like gnomes.

389
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:55,700
 They were ancient Greek statues of the god Pryapus

390
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:58,700
 with an enormous erection.

391
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,700
 Absolutely massive.

392
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:04,700
 And the basic message was, if you come in here, Pryapus will chase you.

393
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:08,700
 So it was like having a guard dog before guard dogs were in touch.

394
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:09,700
 Yeah.

395
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,700
 It's like having a guard penis, basically.

396
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:14,700
 Actually, I found that as well.

397
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:17,700
 It said it also was to promote fertility.

398
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,700
 And also to scare birds away.

399
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:23,700
 It would give them a perch more than any of you.

400
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,700
 On flamingos.

401
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:26,700
 Oh, yeah.

402
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,700
 This is amazing.

403
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:31,700
 Parent flamingos passed their colour to their children.

404
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:34,700
 So flamingos were only pink because of the things they eat.

405
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:35,700
 But they're all pink, right?

406
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:36,700
 They're all pink.

407
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,700
 They're born, they're gray.

408
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,700
 And it's because they haven't eaten any of the shrimp that have the pink pigment in

409
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:44,700
 that gives the flamingos their colour.

410
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:48,700
 So baby flamingos start getting pink as their parents feed them.

411
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:51,700
 And they turn pink and the parents start to fade.

412
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,700
 What?

413
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:53,700
 Yeah.

414
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,700
 The pink transfer.

415
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,700
 That's where you're going.

416
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,700
 Now you've had a kid, Dan.

417
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,700
 Oh.

418
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,700
 Fade in a way.

419
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:05,700
 [LAUGHTER]

420
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:08,700
 Yes, they are the ultimate metaphor for mortality.

421
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:09,700
 Amazing.

422
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:10,700
 Wow.

423
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,700
 So we've discussed this before on the TV show.

424
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:16,700
 So you know how the bird joint that looks like the knee and bends backwards.

425
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:17,700
 That's actually the ankle, right?

426
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:18,700
 Oh, yeah.

427
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,700
 And the knee is actually up right by the body.

428
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:21,700
 So you can't see the knee.

429
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:22,700
 Then the ankle bends backwards.

430
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:25,700
 And then they're standing on their tittos, basically.

431
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:26,700
 This is amazing.

432
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,700
 Baby flamingos haven't worked out yet.

433
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,700
 How to move that joint up, right?

434
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:33,700
 So they haven't worked out how to stand on the very tall legs like their parents.

435
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:37,700
 So if you look at a baby flamingo, it's got these massively long clown legs.

436
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,700
 And then there's tiny little joint up to its body.

437
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:40,700
 It's so funny.

438
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:43,700
 Its feet come out way further than it is tall.

439
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:44,700
 It's incredible.

440
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:45,700
 And then that is amazing.

441
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:48,700
 There must be a moment in the flamingo's life where it just goes...

442
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:51,700
 [LAUGHTER]

443
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,700
 They do look stupid, don't they?

444
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,700
 They don't really see fit.

445
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:58,700
 OK, let's move on to our final fact of the show.

446
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,700
 And that is Andy.

447
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:05,700
 My fact is that when Winston Churchill made his first radio address to the people of occupied France,

448
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:08,700
 he had his male French coach sitting on his lap.

449
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,700
 [LAUGHTER]

450
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:11,700
 This is true.

451
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,700
 This is from a new book about the BBC and the Second World War.

452
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,700
 It's called "Anti's War" by Edward Sturton.

453
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:18,700
 And it was October 1940.

454
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,700
 France has fallen to the Nazis.

455
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:23,700
 And Churchill had to make a rallying cry to the people of occupied France.

456
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:27,700
 He did it in French because he wanted to speak to the French in their own language.

457
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:30,700
 And he said, "Francy, it's so much. Churchill, Kiev, Nepal."

458
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:34,700
 And better than that, because he was very, very good at French.

459
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:35,700
 Or was he very good?

460
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,700
 Well, he had his French teacher sitting on his lap.

461
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:38,700
 [LAUGHTER]

462
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:41,700
 Because I read on the WinstonChurchill.org,

463
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,700
 who you think will be on his side,

464
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:47,700
 that his French was variously described on a scale from poor to excruable.

465
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:48,700
 [LAUGHTER]

466
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:49,700
 Oh.

467
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,700
 It was very controversial.

468
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,700
 His ability to speak French, I think, wasn't it?

469
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:58,700
 He was going to go, wasn't impressed at one point. And he spoke with a deliberately very English accent.

470
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,700
 Yeah.

471
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,700
 So he would say, "Marsale" instead of "Marsale."

472
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,700
 And he'd say, "Calais."

473
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,700
 Well, he deliberately mispronounced these things, didn't he?

474
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,700
 Yeah.

475
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,700
 But he was on his, what was he going to do while he was on his lap?

476
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,700
 He was just giving him extra tuition.

477
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,700
 But how?

478
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,700
 Because he could do that sitting next to him.

479
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:14,700
 No, no, no.

480
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,700
 The thing is, the room was so small they were in.

481
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,700
 I know this sounds bad, doesn't it?

482
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:21,700
 But it was a different time in the 40s.

483
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:26,700
 It was, no, it was, it was an improvised radio studio in the Cabinet War rooms.

484
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,700
 And there was one chair in the room, basically.

485
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,700
 But what is he going to do during that speech?

486
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,700
 Is it going to be whispering the words to him or what?

487
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:33,700
 I don't know.

488
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:36,700
 I guess you could point to the syllables on the page for emphasis.

489
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,700
 I'm not sure.

490
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:42,700
 I think what we're saying is it wouldn't stand up as a defence in court now, would it?

491
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:46,700
 But he ended it by saying, "Sleep well to the French."

492
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,700
 Because it was a broadcast in the evening.

493
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:51,700
 And he said, "Sleep well, the dawn will come brightly.

494
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:55,700
 It will shine on the brave and true glorious on the tombs of heroes, Viv la France."

495
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,700
 Which is very moving and stirring.

496
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:00,700
 But when he first arrived in the room to deliver the speech, he just said,

497
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,700
 "Where is my frog speech?"

498
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:05,700
 Wow.

499
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:11,700
 So this reminded me of another story where I think someone was very practical

500
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,700
 to be there with the person who was delivering this speech.

501
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,700
 This was Lord John Kerr.

502
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:21,700
 And if you don't know the name Lord John Kerr, he is the person who wrote Article 50.

503
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,700
 That's what he wrote that.

504
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:26,700
 He's not in Spain as one Kerr.

505
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:29,700
 Yeah, he's one Kerr in Spain.

506
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:32,700
 It's awesome.

507
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:38,700
 And so in 1991, John Major, when he was Prime Minister, he was having to debate the EMU,

508
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:42,700
 which is the economic and monetary union of the single currency.

509
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:45,700
 But basically, he was debating that whether or not to go with the euro, that's it.

510
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:49,700
 And he was so ill-prepared for it, he didn't know what to do.

511
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:52,700
 That much like a table like this, where it's fabric on the top,

512
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:55,700
 before the meeting started and the dignitaries came in to talk to him,

513
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:59,700
 he had John Kerr hide underneath the table.

514
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:02,700
 And as he was sort of trying to find what he was doing,

515
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:06,700
 John Kerr was writing little notes and handing them up to John Major.

516
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:09,700
 So he would look and go, "Actually, this is what I think."

517
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:12,700
 That's a practical tutor. That is incredible.

518
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:15,700
 It is absolutely incredible that, in our living memory,

519
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:18,700
 the Prime Minister had a man under a table passing a nut.

520
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:22,700
 And where did they think these notes were coming from on the other side of the table?

521
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:27,700
 John Major's magic penis is passing a nut again.

522
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:31,700
 But Winston Churchill was one of those people who...

523
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,700
 I think there are two different types of people.

524
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:36,700
 Some people go to France and they're too scared to try out their French as they might like an idiot.

525
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:41,700
 And then some people are really bad at French and they go and they just confidently roll on in there.

526
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,700
 And Churchill was definitely one of those.

527
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:47,700
 So he used to make up French words when he didn't know what the word was.

528
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:52,700
 So he said one very famous thing to De Gaulle when they were debating strategy in 1941.

529
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:57,700
 He said, "Sea vues obstaclare, j'avoue liquidare."

530
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:00,700
 Which obstaclare is not a word in French.

531
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:03,700
 But it was one of those things that he kind of got the general gist.

532
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,700
 "Sea vues obstaclare, j'avoue liquidare."

533
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,700
 And he did it in English as well.

534
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,700
 He made up English words.

535
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:16,700
 So he made up the word "paintatius" to describe places that were worthy of being painted by him.

536
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:19,700
 Just drops that in one day.

537
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:27,700
 Sheldagore once said that only through learning English was he able to understand Churchill's French.

538
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:30,700
 It was a time of sick burns the second world war.

539
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:35,700
 But De Gaulle once said, "When I am right, I get angry."

540
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:38,700
 "When Churchill gets angry, he is wrong."

541
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:41,700
 "We are angry at each other much of the time."

542
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,700
 Bang!

543
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:46,700
 This is like closest outweighs we were talking to.

544
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:50,700
 He did say that he didn't really enjoy speaking French.

545
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:53,700
 So he spoke it during the war for diplomatic reasons and chastired Sheldagore.

546
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:58,700
 And then in 1946, he went to France and he was asked a question in French.

547
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:01,700
 And he said, "No, no, I won't be speaking French."

548
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:05,700
 That was a sacrifice that had to be accepted in wartime.

549
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:09,700
 Bang! Another singer from Winston SC.

550
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,700
 But wasn't his mother French?

551
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:12,700
 Yes.

552
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,700
 So that's why he could speak it quite well.

553
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:18,700
 And his letters to his mother, they were half English and half French.

554
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:24,700
 So they had stuff like, "We arrived at Dieppe O'nu, partouc de bon cafÃ©s au lait.

555
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:29,700
 I pray La Desiernais, we went for a walk."

556
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,700
 That's pretty good.

557
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:34,700
 I have some French phrases, I wonder if you will know what they mean.

558
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:35,700
 Okay.

559
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,700
 "I've got other cats to whip."

560
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:41,700
 That's English.

561
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,700
 All right.

562
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:47,700
 Is it like I've got other things to do or...

563
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,700
 I'm going to go.

564
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:49,700
 ...other fish to fry.

565
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:50,700
 Exactly.

566
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:55,700
 Oh, can you do it in English please?

567
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:59,700
 I've got an ass full of noodles.

568
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:03,700
 I'm the phrase.

569
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:08,700
 In Russian noodles on your ear, I mean someone is like telling stories.

570
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,700
 No, this means I'm lucky.

571
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:18,700
 So, "SophÃ¨re-sheet, commenter-at-mour, I'm pooing like a dead rat."

572
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:20,700
 Is that literal?

573
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:21,700
 No.

574
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:22,700
 That means I'm bored.

575
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,700
 Oh, that's it.

576
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:28,700
 Oh, sorry, I thought you meant it actually meant that you would just have had the shit or something.

577
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:29,700
 No.

578
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:30,700
 Okay.

579
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:35,700
 Because there is one which is "Avoire la top au guiche", which is, it literally is...

580
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:38,700
 There's so many French speakers in the audience, it's awesome.

581
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:42,700
 Are there only French people or French fluent speakers in tonight?

582
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,700
 Do show out if we get this wrong.

583
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:49,700
 But I heard that literally means "Avoire la top au guiche" means to have a mole at the counter,

584
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:54,700
 which means that you really need to poo.

585
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:57,700
 A mole at the counter.

586
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,700
 It's just waiting to be served.

587
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,700
 It's a beautiful language, isn't it?

588
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:05,700
 The language of love.

589
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,700
 We're going to have to wrap up very soon.

590
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:10,700
 Do you guys have stuff before we do?

591
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:14,700
 Well, I can tell you something about radio broadcasts in the war.

592
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:15,700
 Oh, yeah.

593
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,700
 So in World War II, there were air raids in Leningrad.

594
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:23,700
 They broadcasted over the radio and also in massive loudspeakers instructions to take cover

595
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,700
 and what to do whenever there were attacks.

596
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:28,700
 And if there was going to be attacks, they told you that was happening.

597
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:29,700
 But it was all done on the radio.

598
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:33,700
 But the problem is, how do you know that the Germans haven't bombed the radio place?

599
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:34,700
 Right.

600
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:40,700
 And so, in World War II, in Leningrad, they had the sound of a metronome playing on the radio

601
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:54,700
 and the loudspeakers all over just going tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.

602
00:32:54,700 --> 00:33:00,700
 Yes, that's what a lot of people found about the experience of total war.

603
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:04,700
 OK, guys, let's wrap up. OK, that's it. That is all of our facts.

604
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,700

 We have a link to our book as well. It is out now. It's called The Book of the Year.

617
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:39,700
 We're about to give one away to a member of the audience here in Wembleden tonight who sent us in a fact.

618
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,700
 We found our favourite fact. Chazinski, I believe you have it.

619
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:45,700
 Yes, I did write it down, and I forgot to bring it out. So I'm just going to wait.

620
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:48,700
 I can't remember who this was, so you're going to have to shout.

621
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:52,700
 Unbelievable.

622
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,700
 Really?

623
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,700
 It has to have been everyone's fact.

624
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:00,700
 The slickness of the show really fell apart the last minute.

625
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:05,700
 This is about a man called Prince Harry and a woman called Meghan Markle have just got engaged.

626
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:11,700
 And Meghan Markle's ancestors were executed by Prince Harry's ancestors.

627
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:12,700
 Yeah.

628
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:15,700
 Out. Orcward. Who's was that?

629
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:18,700
 Fourth row. Fourth row. What's your name, sorry?

630
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:20,700
 It is Helen.

631
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,700
 Yeah, yeah.

632
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:26,700
 You're an at-tall for a hobbit, right? Yeah, cool.

633
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:28,700
 Call Grandpa Booker after it.

634
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:29,700
 Yeah, come and grab a book afterwards.

635
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,700
 Guys, thank you so much for being here.

636
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,700
 And by the way, we're going to be out the back there.

637
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:36,700
 If you want to buy a copy of the book, we're going to sign copies of the book.

638
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,700
 So please do come say hi.

639
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:41,700
 And we have a very special ending for this evening,

640
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,700
 because usually we go out on the played theme tune.

641
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:46,700
 But tonight, of course, we have Ash Gardner here.

642
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:51,700
 So, why not? We're going to play the song live as we go out tonight with Ash singing the actual song.

643
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:52,700
 Yeah.

644
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:58,700
 So please welcome to the stage and is the lead singer of Empress Ash Gardner, everyone.

645
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:19,700
 [APPLAUSE]

646
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:24,700
 The walls are on their way.

647
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:30,700
 And this time, there's no escape.

648
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:39,700
 They'll move from high to high, leaving nothing alive.

649
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:44,700
 To time and together, show what we can do.

650
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:49,700
 You hold on me, and I hold on to you.

651
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:54,700
 To time and together, show what we can do.

652
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:59,700
 You hold on to me, and I hold on to you.

653
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:07,700
 [APPLAUSE]

654
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:14,700
 [APPLAUSE]

655
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:17,700
 (audience applauds)
