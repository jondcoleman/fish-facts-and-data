00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.100
 In a year where much of the news was believable but THINK comes a book packed with stories that are unbelievable but true.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.100
 *Clears throat*

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.100
 Sorry.

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:20.400
 Uh, hey everyone it's Dan here. Um, thank you for tuning in once again to this episode, the penultimate episode before Christmas.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:27.100
 You're probably thinking, "What? I need to get out there. I need to stop listening to the podcast and think about what president buys someone. No, you don't."

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.700
 You know why? 'Cause you've got a book you need to buy.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.100
 It's called The Book of the Year. It's the weirdest side of 2017. Isn't that right Andy?

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:41.400
 Oh yes, that's right Dan. Uh, it's a very, very exciting book about all of the most interesting things that happened this year.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:47.800
 That's true Andy. Yeah, for example, did you guys know that 2000 bees were stolen in Beeston this year?

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.800
 That's a little British town, isn't it Anna?

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:57.200
 Yes, it is. It's a little tiny town in England called Beeston where they have lots of bees. It's ironic that that happened.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.400
 It absolutely is Anna. And, uh, James, what's your favorite factor in the book?

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:09.400
 Grave of Throats and Santa World Record for most stuntmen on fire at the same time.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:19.300
 It is a 350-page wonder book of insane knowledge from science stories to little-known facts about the bigger stories that happen this year.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:24.700
 It's in shops now. It's also online. Still for £6 on Amazon. It is the ultimate Christmas book.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:33.700
 So please do get the book and so for the last time that the four of us are going to be in the room before this Christmas episode comes out, let's all say it together, guys.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.700
 On with the show. On with the show!

00:01:36.700 --> 00:02:00.700
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast this week coming to you from Wimbledon!

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:14.700
 My name is Dan Schreiber and I am sitting here with Anna Chazinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:24.700
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:43.700
 Very good. We'll keep it in. This week, starting with my fact, my fact this week is that the telephone dialing code for Cape Canaveral, the famous rocket launch site, is 3-2-1.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.700
 Is that amazing?

00:02:45.700 --> 00:03:00.700
 This was changed in 1999 after a petition. Obviously Cape Canaveral, very famous for its connection to NASA, for rocket launching, for so on. They just said let's just have a new dialing telephone number and that's what it is now. 3-2-1.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:01.700
 So cool.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.700
 Thank you.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.700
 But do they steal it off anyone?

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.700
 I think they did actually. There's a town that's really pissed off.

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:18.700
 I think they stole it off Chicago, didn't they? It was supposed to be Chicago. Yeah. So it nearly, it could have been 1-2-3. Do you know this?

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.700
 What you mean when they were launching rockets? Yeah. So NASA, they used to do account up.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:24.700
 No.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.700
 What until and when do they go when they get to like infinity or?

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:37.700
 The original thing. And this was, in fact, originally they got their cue from the films. So in films in the 20s and 30s, in space scenes, it went 1-2-3 and then when they got to 5 or 10 or whatever.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:45.700
 They would go. But then when Fritz Lang released a film in 1929, he did 3-2-1 and the NASA borrowed from that.

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:46.700
 Oh really?

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.700
 And on count-ups instead of count-downs, the telegraph website, they did a counter.

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:58.700
 I think it was counting up to the royal wedding, the last royal wedding and it was just a counter and it's still counting up.

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.700
 And it's still counting up. You can go and see it and it's just on millions of seconds since the royal wedding happens.

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:10.700
 For what? For like, until it gets to divorce or... What are they? What's the end point?

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.700
 Nothing, there's no end point. It's just counting. It's just counting.

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.700
 It's just to help Prince William remember when his wedding anniversary is.

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:23.700
 Happy one million and 26,000 seconds, honey. Yeah, why would you need it?

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.700
 It's a flawed system. That's why I brought it up. All right.

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:33.700
 Kate Canaveral is really interesting. Do you know why it is where it is? It's obviously in Florida, on the coast of Florida.

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:43.700
 And there are two main reasons for it is positioning. And one is that when rockets take off, they can sort of steal a bunch of speed from the rotation of the earth.

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:50.700
 And the earth rotates fastest at the equator, right? Like if a ball's rotating, then the widest bit is going faster than the smallest bit.

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:57.700
 So when rockets take off, they sort of steal that speed, that acceleration as they're taking off, which really helps them.

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:03.700
 And also, they always go in line with the rotation of the earth. So they're going sort of from America towards Britain.

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:09.700
 And so that means if anything goes really badly wrong, it crashes into the sea, which doesn't hurt very many people.

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:15.700
 How can they never do that thing that they do in Formula One where you go behind someone and you get the tailwind speed?

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:18.700
 How come there's not like an initial rocket? That's a really good idea.

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:22.700
 I think now you've said it, they might do that. Is that scientific or what?

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.700
 I think we actually know one's thought of that before.

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:25.700
 Really?

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:29.700
 Or it could be the fact that each rocket costs about 100 million quid to mate.

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.700
 That's true, yeah.

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:39.700
 And do you actually know why the Russians really screwed us over in terms of this, you know, helping rockets get into space?

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:46.700
 Is that, you know, the ISS, the positioning of the ISS, is not on the equator, which is incredibly inconvenient.

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:50.700
 Because one of the things we want is for the ISS to be a stop-off point on the way to the moon.

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:58.700
 And so we'd stop off the ISS, get some food, have a picnic, refuel, have an app, and then you can jump onto the moon in future.

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:09.700
 And we can't do that because to appease the Soviet Union, we put the ISS sort of halfway between the latitude of Florida and halfway between their space station, which is way, way further north.

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:13.700
 And that actually means that the rotation effect doesn't give the acceleration to rockets that they need.

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:17.700
 I've not understood a single thing you've said in the last minute.

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:20.700
 Maybe we should talk about telephone numbers.

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:22.700
 Yeah, sure, yeah.

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:25.700
 So, Dan's telephone number is also...

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:34.700
 When they first came up with the idea of area codes and stuff like that, basically before that, you would kind of ring up an operator and say,

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.700
 "Put me through to Chicago, you know, whatever."

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:46.700
 But when they came up with a number system, there was an anti-digit dialing league who tried to stop the idea of having phone numbers, rather than phone words.

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:56.700
 And this was in America, and it was organized by a guy who, the internet calls, famed semanticist, "S.I. Hayekawa."

00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:00.700
 And I want to be a famed semanticist, that's an amazing title.

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:09.700
 He said that of this idea of giving numbers rather than words, he said, "These people are systematically trying to destroy the use of memory."

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:10.700
 Wow.

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:20.700
 He says, "They tell you to write it down, but try writing a telephone number down in a dark booth while growing for a pencil and gasping for breath."

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:21.700
 What?

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:24.700
 Where is this phone booth?

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:26.700
 In a sulphur pit or something.

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:28.700
 They were super anti-they weren't they?

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:29.700
 They were.

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:37.700
 They thought it would be dehumanizing. There was, yeah, a bunch of leagues that were set up to attack the creeping humoralism, they called it, and the cult of technology.

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:46.700
 And actually, the man who came up with the idea that phone numbers should be numbers rather than a name, because all the letters were sort of getting used up by that point, all the three letter letters.

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:52.700
 So the man who came up with the idea of changing his order numbers was at a party once, and he was approached by someone who said,

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:55.700
 "How does it feel to be the most hated man in America?"

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:56.700
 Wow.

00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:57.700
 Rough.

00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:58.700
 That is bad.

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:17.700
 So these people who were from the anti-digit dialing league, they tried to protest by phoning up operators, and rather than giving them the number as anyone else does, they said, "Operator, get me S-I-Haya-Cawa at $4 billion, $155 million, $842,301."

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:20.700
 So they said all of their phone numbers as actual numbers.

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:21.700
 Oh, that's great.

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:25.700
 And they said, "If they want digits, we'll give them digits."

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:32.700
 And hanging up the phone was invented that day.

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:36.700
 Have you guys heard of a rapper called Soldier Boy?

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:37.700
 Yep.

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:38.700
 Because I haven't.

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:39.700
 No.

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:40.700
 I do know one thing about him.

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:47.700
 So when he was a lot younger, this is in 2009, he listed a phone number at the start of his song, Kiss Me Through The Phone.

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:53.700
 He just read out a string of phone numbers, 12 digit number, and as a result of him reading out that number,

00:08:53.700 --> 00:09:02.700
 a family in Oldham, who owned that number, got bombarded with 60 phone calls every day for months,

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:05.700
 saying, "Is Soldier Boy there, please?"

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:13.700
 And the householder was a woman called Catrion Howard Smith, and she said, "We just tell them that he doesn't live in Oldham."

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:17.700
 That's very similar to Bruce Almighty. You know the film Bruce Almighty?

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:18.700
 Yeah, Jim Kerry.

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:24.700
 Yeah, exactly where there was a real phone number used in Bruce Almighty that belonged to God.

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:30.700
 And the tradition is in America, if you're making a film, the real phone numbers that you use in the film start with 555,

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:32.700
 because then it won't be taken.

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:37.700
 But they sort of contravened this rule, and so they just said a number that actually existed.

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:39.700
 And the film Bruce Almighty got in real trouble.

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:47.700
 So the number was 2762323, and a bunch of people all across America got phone calls asking to be put through to God.

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:53.700
 And these numbers included, one of the numbers put people through to a church in North Carolina,

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:58.700
 and the other went through to a pastor in Wisconsin, and saying, "Can I please get through to God?"

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:02.700
 Because you would start thinking, wouldn't you? If you were a pastor and you've got a load of phone calls for God,

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:06.700
 you might start thinking, "I don't know, I'm not God."

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:10.700
 Is this how he would tell me?

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:16.700
 No, but I read an interview with one of the guys, one of the church pastors, and he did get the calls,

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:21.700
 and they would say, "Oh, is God there?" And then he would be able to go, "Actually, yes, he is."

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:24.700
 Actually, he's everywhere.

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:26.700
 But they changed it for the DVD release.

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:30.700
 Just in case he should not just read it out now.

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:37.700
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Chazinski.

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:42.700
 My fact this week is that the world's largest honeybees make hallucinogenic honey,

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:48.700
 and you're only allowed to collect this honey if you've had a specific dream.

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:52.700
 So, just after the beginning, these are Himalayan giant honeybees,

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:58.700
 and they make what's called mad honey, and they are collected by the Kulung people of Nepal.

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:03.700
 And at the moment, there's one collector left in this little community,

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:06.700
 who's a guy called Mowley Dan. He's the last honey collector.

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:10.700
 And he's got a bunch of apprentices who come with him on the honey collecting missions,

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:15.700
 but they're not allowed to actually extract those sort of hives from the cliff face.

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:19.700
 He has to let himself, because he's the only person who's had this dream.

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:23.700
 And the dream he had was 42 years ago, so he's been doing it for a while.

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:26.700
 He jumped, he was caught in a spider web, he was saved by a monkey,

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:30.700
 and he woke up, and it became clear to him that the monkey was a spirit garden

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:32.700
 called rang camey that they believe in.

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:37.700
 And so, that means rang camey is a spirit of bees and monkeys.

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:41.700
 And so, that meant rang camey was saying, "You can still our honey, and you'll be okay."

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:48.700
 And did the rest of the people go, "That guy's clearly nuts, he'll definitely be able to go down the side of a cliff and attack a bee hive."

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:51.700
 Maybe it was that.

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:55.700
 It was his father's father's father before him, but they have this serious problem now,

00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:58.700
 because it's a real source of income, because it's quite valuable,

00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:01.700
 but no one else has had the dream, so he's got this apprentice.

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:06.700
 And this apprentice says, "I really want to collect the honey on the really dangerous cliff face,

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:09.700
 but I just haven't had the dream."

00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:11.700
 And you can't lie about the dream?

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:14.700
 Well, I know.

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:17.700
 No, what I mean is everyone here now knows about the dream.

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:19.700
 Does he not know about the dream?

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:21.700
 No, they all know about the dream, but of course you can't lie about the dream.

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:23.700
 This is a spiritual mission you've been given.

00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:25.700
 The idea is that if you collect the honey without having had the dream,

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:27.700
 then you'll be cursed forever more.

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:29.700
 Why would you lie about it then?

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:31.700
 Yeah, it's done.

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:32.700
 Yeah, it's done.

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:33.700
 Sorry.

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:36.700
 Think about what you've done, Dan.

00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:39.700
 It was a long article.

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:41.700
 I've been to a brainwash point.

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:42.700
 It's an amazing article.

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:44.700
 It was a national geographic, and I really would recommend it.

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:45.700
 It's really good.

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:47.700
 Do you know what else they do these bees?

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:48.700
 They do Mexican waves.

00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:49.700
 They nest in the open, right?

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:52.700
 They have a single flat comb on the cliff face, okay?

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:56.700
 They nest out in the open, and they've got seven or eight layers of bees thick on the outside for warmth.

00:12:56.700 --> 00:13:02.700
 And when a predator approaches, their method is to do a wave pointing their abdomens out into the air,

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:06.700
 so all their stingers are facing outwards, and they do it in a Mexican waveform.

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:11.700
 And that notifies the bees on the other side that there's a predator approaching, and they then do it too.

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:13.700
 Okay.

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:15.700
 Like the Mexican wave in football stadiums,

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:17.700
 notifies the people on the other end that there's a Mexican wave coming.

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:18.700
 Yes.

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:21.700
 But in that case, the predator is the Mexican wave.

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:30.700
 So this mad honey, it's from plants from the road to dendron plants.

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:31.700
 Is it something like that?

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:35.700
 Yes, it's bees that pollinate using the road to dendron plant in spring,

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:37.700
 which, and then that makes them make the mad honey.

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:40.700
 Right, but it's been known about for millennia, hasn't it?

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:42.700
 Like the Romans wrote about it, the Greeks wrote about it.

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:43.700
 Yeah.

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:46.700
 There was someone quite recently, a bit more recently, a married couple,

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:51.700
 who deliberately ate some mad honey for reasons of sexual performance.

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:54.700
 They'd been ringing the meningitis hotline, haven't they?

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:58.700
 But it's, yeah, it's said to be a sort of Niagara, isn't it?

00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:02.700
 Yeah, so they had one teaspoon per day for a week.

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:07.700
 And then after a week, they decided to crank it up and had a full table spoon each.

00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:11.700
 But unfortunately, that meant they suffered from confusion, chest pain,

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:13.700
 low blood pressure, and a slowed heartbeat.

00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:18.700
 And they had to go to the hospital and it turned out they both had a mild heart attack.

00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:19.700
 Whoa.

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:20.700
 God.

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:21.700
 Whoa.

00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:22.700
 Yeah.

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:23.700
 Oh my god.

00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:24.700
 No, not sexy.

00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:25.700
 Okay.

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:28.700
 It could be worse.

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:32.700
 I read that if you have too much of it, that your body purges itself from both ends,

00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:36.700
 and then you go intermittently blind, have a sound wave pulsing in your head,

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:38.700
 and then you'll paralyze for a day.

00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:40.700
 Not sexy?

00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:41.700
 Not sexy.

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:46.700
 Yeah, apparently you're suddenly seized at one point with the urge to simultaneously

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:49.700
 urinate, defecate, and vomit, and then you do all of those things.

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:53.700
 But then I think it's the purging process which creates the spiritual awakening.

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:56.700
 Have you guys heard of Dawson's bees?

00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:57.700
 Dawson's bees.

00:14:57.700 --> 00:14:58.700
 Dawson's bees.

00:14:58.700 --> 00:14:59.700
 This is so cool.

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:03.700
 They are so aggressive that during their mating sessions, all the males bite each other

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:04.700
 to death.

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:05.700
 All of them.

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:06.700
 All of them.

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:07.700
 All of them.

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:08.700
 All of them.

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:09.700
 In the mating process.

00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:10.700
 How does the mating happen then?

00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:12.700
 Well, I think they've kind of mating and biting at the same time.

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:14.700
 But basically, all the males die.

00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:15.700
 Not sexy.

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:16.700
 Not sexy.

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:17.700
 But sexual.

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:18.700
 Yeah.

00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:19.700
 Yeah.

00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:24.700
 So the entire generation of males is wiped out, and the only ones left behind are the females,

00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:26.700
 and they just get along with each other fine.

00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:31.700
 And then they raise the next generation of males who kill each other and leave the females

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:33.700
 to get on with it again.

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:34.700
 Wow.

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:35.700
 That's amazing.

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:38.700
 And, you know, it's something to take a note of, I suppose.

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:39.700
 Right?

00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:40.700
 Yeah.

00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:49.700
 I've read that a lot of honey that we buy in shops these days are not as honey-ish as they can be.

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:53.700
 They sort of get watered down in the process and they disguise it because it's very hard if

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:56.700
 you're just going through honey to be like, that's been watered down.

00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:57.700
 And it's a big industry.

00:15:57.700 --> 00:15:59.700
 It's like a mafia style industry.

00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:00.700
 And they call it honey laundering.

00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:01.700
 And they...

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:02.700
 Yeah.

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:04.700
 Genuinely, it's called honey laundering.

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:05.700
 And...

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:06.700
 It's so good.

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:06.700
 Yeah.

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:10.700
 Something like 75% of honey that we have in shops has been watered down.

00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:11.700
 So it's not in its purest day.

00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:12.700
 75%.

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:13.700
 I made that spin up.

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:14.700
 It was, yeah.

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:16.700
 It's a stat like that, kind of.

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:17.700
 Oh, yeah.

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:19.700
 There were Victorian honey launders.

00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:21.700
 And they did exactly the same thing.

00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:22.700
 And they would...

00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:23.700
 I think it was just...

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:24.700
 They'd just use syrup or...

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:25.700
 Sometimes they'd just use glucose.

00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:26.700
 They'd just pour it into a jar.

00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:27.700
 And to...

00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:31.700
 For added varietay, they would sprinkle in a couple of wings and legs.

00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:34.700
 So you were thinking, "Ah, good. This is proper honey."

00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:39.700
 There was someone who got in trouble for stealing honey in 2008, actually.

00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:40.700
 And this was in Macedonia.

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:47.700
 And this was a bear who was convicted in a core of criminal damage for stealing honey.

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:51.700
 So the case was brought by this beekeeper and this bear had been stealing his bee constantly.

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:53.700
 Stealing his bee, stealing his honey.

00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:54.700
 Constantly.

00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:57.700
 And eventually he reported the bear.

00:16:57.700 --> 00:17:01.700
 The first thing he tried was to play loud, Serbian, turbo folk music.

00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:02.700
 Catherine.

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:06.700
 So, yeah, he took the bear to court.

00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:08.700
 And the bear didn't actually turn up in court.

00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:11.700
 And so the state had to pay the fine.

00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:12.700
 It was about 1,800 pounds.

00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:16.700
 Imagine being the cellmate who gets stuck in with the bear.

00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:19.700
 What are you even for, mate?

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:25.700
 Got caught in a honey trap.

00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:40.700
 Well, sometimes a pun is so good, you just need to sit in silence and respect it.

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:44.700
 Did you know the bees were sent up on Interspace in 1984?

00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:47.700
 As they had been a few times, I think, but they were sent on a challenger flight.

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:51.700
 And there were 3,300 bees in space.

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:54.700
 They were housing this little box and it was to see how they dealt with zero gravity

00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:56.700
 and whether they built a decent enough hive and stuff.

00:17:56.700 --> 00:18:01.700
 And they did really well, actually, they built a nearly normal comb, according to NASA.

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:05.700
 But bees are very clean, so they don't like to excrete inside their hive.

00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:07.700
 They always go out to wee.

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:10.700
 And in this challenger thing, they were just stuck in their hive the whole time.

00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:16.700
 So even though they were there for a full week and they're excreting, you know, every hour, usually, they held it all in.

00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:18.700
 Yeah, they sucked it up.

00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:22.700
 They waited and then they just had an explosive time as soon as they got back to Earth, I guess.

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:24.700
 But yeah, there was no excreting.

00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:29.700
 The NASA spokesperson said when the hive got back from space, it was as clean as a pin.

00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:30.700
 Really?

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:31.700
 Yeah.

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:34.700
 One minute later, it was not as clean as that.

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:37.700
 Well, just on bee, specifically honey bee, genitalia.

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:42.700
 I was reading about their sex life, and Andy, yes, it is sexy.

00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:45.700
 They, oh no, no, I've just remembered what it is.

00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:52.700
 They have sex, and the ejaculation is so intense for them, their penis explodes.

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:57.700
 Nice, true. There's actually an audible pop that humans can hear.

00:18:57.700 --> 00:18:58.700
 Whoa!

00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:01.700
 What, where are you?

00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:08.700
 You're listening in on a stethoscope of against the life.

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:10.700
 We should move on to our third fact, guys.

00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:16.700
 Okay, it is time for our third fact of the show, and that is James Harkin.

00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:21.700
 Okay, my fact this week is the man who invented the pink flamingo garden ornament

00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:26.700
 dressed in matching clothes with his wife for 35 years.

00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:27.700
 It's amazing.

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:29.700
 It's so weird.

00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:32.700
 Is it weird, or is it sweet?

00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:33.700
 Sweet, it's sweet.

00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:36.700
 Okay, cheer for weird.

00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:37.700
 Oh.

00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:40.700
 Cheer for sweet.

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:43.700
 Extremely female cheer for sweet, wasn't it?

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:44.700
 It's so incredible.

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:45.700
 Sorry.

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:49.700
 Like, even when they were in different places, she would pack his suitcase

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:52.700
 and tell him what to wear on each day, so they felt closer to each other.

00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:53.700
 Yeah, yeah.

00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:56.700
 That wouldn't make me feel closer to my partner, of course they.

00:19:56.700 --> 00:20:01.700
 That would make me feel like I needed to reassess the relationship.

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:03.700
 But there was an interview with this guy's wife.

00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:06.700
 He was called Donald Fedestone, and he died in 2015.

00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:11.700
 There was an interview with his wife, and she said that Donald proposed on their first date

00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:14.700
 and they've been together almost all the time since.

00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:15.700
 Wow.

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:16.700
 They didn't go apart that much.

00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:21.700
 And they said, we find it funny when we're watching those crime shows.

00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:24.700
 And they say, what was he worrying when you last saw him?

00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:29.700
 If it was us, we could point to ourselves and say, this.

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:35.700
 I must be so far watching TV with them.

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:41.700
 Hey, by the way, we should just quickly explain the absolute cultural

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:43.700
 massiveness of this character.

00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:45.700
 He created these pink flamingo ornaments.

00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:47.700
 Picture that ornament in your head.

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:49.700
 That's the one that he invented.

00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:55.700
 Well, thanks for clarifying that, Dan.

00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:56.700
 Picture the other one.

00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:58.700
 That's not the one.

00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:00.700
 It was the one you thought of thirst.

00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:04.700
 And that, so he created the pink flamingo, and it was ginormous.

00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:10.700
 I mean, it was small, but the production line of it was ginormous.

00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:12.700
 They sold a fuckload of them.

00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:15.700
 There's something like 50 million out there in the world.

00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:18.700
 And it was a casting mold that he made of a flamingo.

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:20.700
 And he'd done lots of different animals.

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:23.700
 And they all had mild success, but not flamingo success.

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:25.700
 Charlie, the duck was quite big.

00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:28.700
 Yeah, the duck was bigger than the flamingo for three decades.

00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:29.700
 What?

00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:31.700
 80s that the flamingo overtook the duck.

00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:33.700
 Which I can't even picture the duck.

00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:36.700
 Just imagine that duck.

00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:39.700
 He did that.

00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:41.700
 And he based on a real duck, didn't he?

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:45.700
 That he bought a duck and he kept it in his sink.

00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:48.700
 He built a model of this duck.

00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:50.700
 Probably really unhappy looking duck.

00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:51.700
 But he tried to sell.

00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:52.700
 Yeah, called Charlie.

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:54.700
 And he set it up with mirrors in his words.

00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:57.700
 So it would think it had friends.

00:21:57.700 --> 00:21:59.700
 This is the best couple ever.

00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:00.700
 This is so exciting.

00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:04.700
 They also had, because so they had four different wardrobes,

00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:06.700
 physical built wardrobes in their house.

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:10.700
 And in each wardrobe was the different season that they had

00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:13.700
 of the clothing relative to the season.

00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:14.700
 So it's summer time.

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:16.700
 Let's go to wardrobe number two, and they would open it.

00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:19.700
 And there would be the matching his costume and then her costume.

00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:22.700
 And then the next version of the matching his her costume.

00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:27.700
 And then they had a special fifth cupboard that was specifically

00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:29.700
 for the flamingo-based outfits.

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:30.700
 Oh.

00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:31.700
 Was it?

00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:33.700
 And they would occasionally go to the fifth cupboard and go

00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:34.700
 it's flamingo day.

00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:36.700
 And they would.

00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:39.700
 And they would wear it.

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:42.700
 And just on garden ornaments.

00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:43.700
 Yeah.

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:45.700
 Do you know what the first garden ornaments were?

00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:47.700
 Or these were very early garden ornaments.

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:49.700
 I don't know if they were first.

00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:50.700
 Like gnomes?

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:51.700
 They were like gnomes.

00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:55.700
 They were ancient Greek statues of the god Pryapus

00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:58.700
 with an enormous erection.

00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:00.700
 Absolutely massive.

00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:04.700
 And the basic message was, if you come in here, Pryapus will chase you.

00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:08.700
 So it was like having a guard dog before guard dogs were in touch.

00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:09.700
 Yeah.

00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:11.700
 It's like having a guard penis, basically.

00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:14.700
 Actually, I found that as well.

00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:17.700
 It said it also was to promote fertility.

00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:20.700
 And also to scare birds away.

00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:23.700
 It would give them a perch more than any of you.

00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:25.700
 On flamingos.

00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:26.700
 Oh, yeah.

00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:27.700
 This is amazing.

00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:31.700
 Parent flamingos passed their colour to their children.

00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:34.700
 So flamingos were only pink because of the things they eat.

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:35.700
 But they're all pink, right?

00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:36.700
 They're all pink.

00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:38.700
 They're born, they're gray.

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:41.700
 And it's because they haven't eaten any of the shrimp that have the pink pigment in

00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:44.700
 that gives the flamingos their colour.

00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:48.700
 So baby flamingos start getting pink as their parents feed them.

00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:51.700
 And they turn pink and the parents start to fade.

00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:52.700
 What?

00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:53.700
 Yeah.

00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:54.700
 The pink transfer.

00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:55.700
 That's where you're going.

00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:56.700
 Now you've had a kid, Dan.

00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:57.700
 Oh.

00:23:57.700 --> 00:23:59.700
 Fade in a way.

00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:05.700
 [LAUGHTER]

00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:08.700
 Yes, they are the ultimate metaphor for mortality.

00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:09.700
 Amazing.

00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:10.700
 Wow.

00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:12.700
 So we've discussed this before on the TV show.

00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:16.700
 So you know how the bird joint that looks like the knee and bends backwards.

00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:17.700
 That's actually the ankle, right?

00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:18.700
 Oh, yeah.

00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:20.700
 And the knee is actually up right by the body.

00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:21.700
 So you can't see the knee.

00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:22.700
 Then the ankle bends backwards.

00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:25.700
 And then they're standing on their tittos, basically.

00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:26.700
 This is amazing.

00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:28.700
 Baby flamingos haven't worked out yet.

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:30.700
 How to move that joint up, right?

00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:33.700
 So they haven't worked out how to stand on the very tall legs like their parents.

00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:37.700
 So if you look at a baby flamingo, it's got these massively long clown legs.

00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:39.700
 And then there's tiny little joint up to its body.

00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:40.700
 It's so funny.

00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:43.700
 Its feet come out way further than it is tall.

00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:44.700
 It's incredible.

00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:45.700
 And then that is amazing.

00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:48.700
 There must be a moment in the flamingo's life where it just goes...

00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:51.700
 [LAUGHTER]

00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:53.700
 They do look stupid, don't they?

00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:55.700
 They don't really see fit.

00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:58.700
 OK, let's move on to our final fact of the show.

00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:00.700
 And that is Andy.

00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:05.700
 My fact is that when Winston Churchill made his first radio address to the people of occupied France,

00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:08.700
 he had his male French coach sitting on his lap.

00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:10.700
 [LAUGHTER]

00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:11.700
 This is true.

00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:14.700
 This is from a new book about the BBC and the Second World War.

00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:16.700
 It's called "Anti's War" by Edward Sturton.

00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:18.700
 And it was October 1940.

00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:20.700
 France has fallen to the Nazis.

00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:23.700
 And Churchill had to make a rallying cry to the people of occupied France.

00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:27.700
 He did it in French because he wanted to speak to the French in their own language.

00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:30.700
 And he said, "Francy, it's so much. Churchill, Kiev, Nepal."

00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:34.700
 And better than that, because he was very, very good at French.

00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:35.700
 Or was he very good?

00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:37.700
 Well, he had his French teacher sitting on his lap.

00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:38.700
 [LAUGHTER]

00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:41.700
 Because I read on the WinstonChurchill.org,

00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:43.700
 who you think will be on his side,

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:47.700
 that his French was variously described on a scale from poor to excruable.

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:48.700
 [LAUGHTER]

00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:49.700
 Oh.

00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:51.700
 It was very controversial.

00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:53.700
 His ability to speak French, I think, wasn't it?

00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:58.700
 He was going to go, wasn't impressed at one point. And he spoke with a deliberately very English accent.

00:25:58.700 --> 00:25:59.700
 Yeah.

00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:01.700
 So he would say, "Marsale" instead of "Marsale."

00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:03.700
 And he'd say, "Calais."

00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:05.700
 Well, he deliberately mispronounced these things, didn't he?

00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:06.700
 Yeah.

00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:08.700
 But he was on his, what was he going to do while he was on his lap?

00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:10.700
 He was just giving him extra tuition.

00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:11.700
 But how?

00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:13.700
 Because he could do that sitting next to him.

00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:14.700
 No, no, no.

00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:16.700
 The thing is, the room was so small they were in.

00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:18.700
 I know this sounds bad, doesn't it?

00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:21.700
 But it was a different time in the 40s.

00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:26.700
 It was, no, it was, it was an improvised radio studio in the Cabinet War rooms.

00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:28.700
 And there was one chair in the room, basically.

00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:30.700
 But what is he going to do during that speech?

00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:32.700
 Is it going to be whispering the words to him or what?

00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:33.700
 I don't know.

00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:36.700
 I guess you could point to the syllables on the page for emphasis.

00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:37.700
 I'm not sure.

00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:42.700
 I think what we're saying is it wouldn't stand up as a defence in court now, would it?

00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:46.700
 But he ended it by saying, "Sleep well to the French."

00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:48.700
 Because it was a broadcast in the evening.

00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:51.700
 And he said, "Sleep well, the dawn will come brightly.

00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:55.700
 It will shine on the brave and true glorious on the tombs of heroes, Viv la France."

00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:57.700
 Which is very moving and stirring.

00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:00.700
 But when he first arrived in the room to deliver the speech, he just said,

00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:02.700
 "Where is my frog speech?"

00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:05.700
 Wow.

00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:11.700
 So this reminded me of another story where I think someone was very practical

00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:14.700
 to be there with the person who was delivering this speech.

00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:17.700
 This was Lord John Kerr.

00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:21.700
 And if you don't know the name Lord John Kerr, he is the person who wrote Article 50.

00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:23.700
 That's what he wrote that.

00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:26.700
 He's not in Spain as one Kerr.

00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:29.700
 Yeah, he's one Kerr in Spain.

00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:32.700
 It's awesome.

00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:38.700
 And so in 1991, John Major, when he was Prime Minister, he was having to debate the EMU,

00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:42.700
 which is the economic and monetary union of the single currency.

00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:45.700
 But basically, he was debating that whether or not to go with the euro, that's it.

00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:49.700
 And he was so ill-prepared for it, he didn't know what to do.

00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:52.700
 That much like a table like this, where it's fabric on the top,

00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:55.700
 before the meeting started and the dignitaries came in to talk to him,

00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:59.700
 he had John Kerr hide underneath the table.

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:02.700
 And as he was sort of trying to find what he was doing,

00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:06.700
 John Kerr was writing little notes and handing them up to John Major.

00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:09.700
 So he would look and go, "Actually, this is what I think."

00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:12.700
 That's a practical tutor. That is incredible.

00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:15.700
 It is absolutely incredible that, in our living memory,

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:18.700
 the Prime Minister had a man under a table passing a nut.

00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:22.700
 And where did they think these notes were coming from on the other side of the table?

00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:27.700
 John Major's magic penis is passing a nut again.

00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:31.700
 But Winston Churchill was one of those people who...

00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:33.700
 I think there are two different types of people.

00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:36.700
 Some people go to France and they're too scared to try out their French as they might like an idiot.

00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:41.700
 And then some people are really bad at French and they go and they just confidently roll on in there.

00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:43.700
 And Churchill was definitely one of those.

00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:47.700
 So he used to make up French words when he didn't know what the word was.

00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:52.700
 So he said one very famous thing to De Gaulle when they were debating strategy in 1941.

00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:57.700
 He said, "Sea vues obstaclare, j'avoue liquidare."

00:28:57.700 --> 00:29:00.700
 Which obstaclare is not a word in French.

00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:03.700
 But it was one of those things that he kind of got the general gist.

00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:06.700
 "Sea vues obstaclare, j'avoue liquidare."

00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:08.700
 And he did it in English as well.

00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:10.700
 He made up English words.

00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:16.700
 So he made up the word "paintatius" to describe places that were worthy of being painted by him.

00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:19.700
 Just drops that in one day.

00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:27.700
 Sheldagore once said that only through learning English was he able to understand Churchill's French.

00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:30.700
 It was a time of sick burns the second world war.

00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:35.700
 But De Gaulle once said, "When I am right, I get angry."

00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:38.700
 "When Churchill gets angry, he is wrong."

00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:41.700
 "We are angry at each other much of the time."

00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:43.700
 Bang!

00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:46.700
 This is like closest outweighs we were talking to.

00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:50.700
 He did say that he didn't really enjoy speaking French.

00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:53.700
 So he spoke it during the war for diplomatic reasons and chastired Sheldagore.

00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:58.700
 And then in 1946, he went to France and he was asked a question in French.

00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:01.700
 And he said, "No, no, I won't be speaking French."

00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:05.700
 That was a sacrifice that had to be accepted in wartime.

00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:09.700
 Bang! Another singer from Winston SC.

00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:11.700
 But wasn't his mother French?

00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:12.700
 Yes.

00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:14.700
 So that's why he could speak it quite well.

00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:18.700
 And his letters to his mother, they were half English and half French.

00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:24.700
 So they had stuff like, "We arrived at Dieppe O'nu, partouc de bon cafés au lait.

00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:29.700
 I pray La Desiernais, we went for a walk."

00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:30.700
 That's pretty good.

00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:34.700
 I have some French phrases, I wonder if you will know what they mean.

00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:35.700
 Okay.

00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:38.700
 "I've got other cats to whip."

00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:41.700
 That's English.

00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:43.700
 All right.

00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:47.700
 Is it like I've got other things to do or...

00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:48.700
 I'm going to go.

00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:49.700
 ...other fish to fry.

00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:50.700
 Exactly.

00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:55.700
 Oh, can you do it in English please?

00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:59.700
 I've got an ass full of noodles.

00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:03.700
 I'm the phrase.

00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:08.700
 In Russian noodles on your ear, I mean someone is like telling stories.

00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:11.700
 No, this means I'm lucky.

00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:18.700
 So, "Sophère-sheet, commenter-at-mour, I'm pooing like a dead rat."

00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:20.700
 Is that literal?

00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:21.700
 No.

00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:22.700
 That means I'm bored.

00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:24.700
 Oh, that's it.

00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:28.700
 Oh, sorry, I thought you meant it actually meant that you would just have had the shit or something.

00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:29.700
 No.

00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:30.700
 Okay.

00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:35.700
 Because there is one which is "Avoire la top au guiche", which is, it literally is...

00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:38.700
 There's so many French speakers in the audience, it's awesome.

00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:42.700
 Are there only French people or French fluent speakers in tonight?

00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:44.700
 Do show out if we get this wrong.

00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:49.700
 But I heard that literally means "Avoire la top au guiche" means to have a mole at the counter,

00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:54.700
 which means that you really need to poo.

00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:57.700
 A mole at the counter.

00:31:57.700 --> 00:31:59.700
 It's just waiting to be served.

00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:01.700
 It's a beautiful language, isn't it?

00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:05.700
 The language of love.

00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:07.700
 We're going to have to wrap up very soon.

00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:10.700
 Do you guys have stuff before we do?

00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:14.700
 Well, I can tell you something about radio broadcasts in the war.

00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:15.700
 Oh, yeah.

00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:17.700
 So in World War II, there were air raids in Leningrad.

00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:23.700
 They broadcasted over the radio and also in massive loudspeakers instructions to take cover

00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:25.700
 and what to do whenever there were attacks.

00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:28.700
 And if there was going to be attacks, they told you that was happening.

00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:29.700
 But it was all done on the radio.

00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:33.700
 But the problem is, how do you know that the Germans haven't bombed the radio place?

00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:34.700
 Right.

00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:40.700
 And so, in World War II, in Leningrad, they had the sound of a metronome playing on the radio

00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:54.700
 and the loudspeakers all over just going tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.

00:32:54.700 --> 00:33:00.700
 Yes, that's what a lot of people found about the experience of total war.

00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:04.700
 OK, guys, let's wrap up. OK, that's it. That is all of our facts.

00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:06.700

 We have a link to our book as well. It is out now. It's called The Book of the Year.

00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:39.700
 We're about to give one away to a member of the audience here in Wembleden tonight who sent us in a fact.

00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:41.700
 We found our favourite fact. Chazinski, I believe you have it.

00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:45.700
 Yes, I did write it down, and I forgot to bring it out. So I'm just going to wait.

00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:48.700
 I can't remember who this was, so you're going to have to shout.

00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:52.700
 Unbelievable.

00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:54.700
 Really?

00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:57.700
 It has to have been everyone's fact.

00:33:57.700 --> 00:34:00.700
 The slickness of the show really fell apart the last minute.

00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:05.700
 This is about a man called Prince Harry and a woman called Meghan Markle have just got engaged.

00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:11.700
 And Meghan Markle's ancestors were executed by Prince Harry's ancestors.

00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:12.700
 Yeah.

00:34:12.700 --> 00:34:15.700
 Out. Orcward. Who's was that?

00:34:15.700 --> 00:34:18.700
 Fourth row. Fourth row. What's your name, sorry?

00:34:18.700 --> 00:34:20.700
 It is Helen.

00:34:20.700 --> 00:34:22.700
 Yeah, yeah.

00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:26.700
 You're an at-tall for a hobbit, right? Yeah, cool.

00:34:26.700 --> 00:34:28.700
 Call Grandpa Booker after it.

00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:29.700
 Yeah, come and grab a book afterwards.

00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:31.700
 Guys, thank you so much for being here.

00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:33.700
 And by the way, we're going to be out the back there.

00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:36.700
 If you want to buy a copy of the book, we're going to sign copies of the book.

00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:38.700
 So please do come say hi.

00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:41.700
 And we have a very special ending for this evening,

00:34:41.700 --> 00:34:43.700
 because usually we go out on the played theme tune.

00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:46.700
 But tonight, of course, we have Ash Gardner here.

00:34:46.700 --> 00:34:51.700
 So, why not? We're going to play the song live as we go out tonight with Ash singing the actual song.

00:34:51.700 --> 00:34:52.700
 Yeah.

00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:58.700
 So please welcome to the stage and is the lead singer of Empress Ash Gardner, everyone.

00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:19.700
 [APPLAUSE]

00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:24.700
 The walls are on their way.

00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:30.700
 And this time, there's no escape.

00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:39.700
 They'll move from high to high, leaving nothing alive.

00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:44.700
 To time and together, show what we can do.

00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:49.700
 You hold on me, and I hold on to you.

00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:54.700
 To time and together, show what we can do.

00:35:54.700 --> 00:35:59.700
 You hold on to me, and I hold on to you.

00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:07.700
 [APPLAUSE]

00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:14.700
 [APPLAUSE]

00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:17.700
 (audience applauds)
