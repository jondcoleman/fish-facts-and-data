00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,760
 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, where we were

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:09,480
 joined by the wonderful Sarah Pasco.

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,920
 Now there is no one I don't think in Britain who doesn't know who Sarah Pasco is and probably

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,360
 if you listen to this show around the world you'll know her as well because she has been

5
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:22,560
 on fish before, but just as a quick reminder she is an incredible stand up comedian and

6
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:28,520
 TV presenter who is a good friend of ours, she does a podcast as well, she does a show

7
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:34,560
 called Weirdo's Book Club with fellow fish alumnus Carrie Adloid, but she is on all the

8
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,880
 panel shows she's been on QI a million times, she's absolutely brilliant, we love having

9
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:44,240
 her on all of our shows, but one important thing to say about Sarah is that she is currently

10
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:49,640
 on tour, if you would like to see her show and you live somewhere in the UK there is

11
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:54,560
 an extremely good chance that she will be coming to your town in November or in the spring

12
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:58,900
 next year, and to find out the shortest amount of travel you will have to make to get to

13
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:09,240
 her shows, you must go to Sarah Pasco.co.uk/tickets her website is S-A-R-A-P-A-S-C-O-E.co.uk because

14
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,000
 that is how you spell her name.

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,920
 So go to Sarah Pasco.co.uk to get tickets for her show, but in the meantime please enjoy

16
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:33,000
 our show, on with a podcast.

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,520
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

18
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,960
 to you from the QI offices in Hobern.

19
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,760
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray, and

20
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:49,000
 Sarah Pasco, and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favourite

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,020
 facts from the last seven days, and in a particular order here we go.

22
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:57,280
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Sarah.

23
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:03,840
 My fact, and I'm underlying the word fact there, the reasons that will become clear, my fact

24
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,360
 is Saturn's wings are younger than sharks.

25
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:18,200
 So when you say fact, and you underline it, weirdly we've never had a guest underline the headline

26
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,760
 fact before, and it makes me instantly suspicious.

27
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:28,360
 Yes, well H is butter concept, and when I looked into the inverted commas proof of both

28
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,440
 of the ages, Saturn and sharks I felt like well there's lots to debate here.

29
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:37,240
 Okay, so do you stand by it or not, like if you had to bet your life on it.

30
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:41,680
 I would have to do more research probably, so let me tell you where the whole ageing of

31
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,080
 Saturn's wings comes from.

32
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,880
 So there's a Cassini spacecraft, combination of NASA, the European Space Agency, and also

33
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:54,240
 the Italian Space Agency, which means they're not in the European Space Agency, and I thought

34
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,280
 there's a sitcom.

35
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:02,040
 It's an easily deciding note, whatever our own one, our spaceship will be the shape of

36
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:08,880
 the Italian astronauts, stereotypical Italians, so you think they're low and low style.

37
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:13,160
 Yeah, and all of the other space men are eating the tubes of paste food, and they've still got

38
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:17,160
 spaghetti Pomodoro, and it's creating a big mess in the spaceship.

39
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:24,160
 All the Italian astronauts typically like to stay in the mothership, and his mind about

40
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,520
 Marianna Ouigi, they're fixing the spaceship.

41
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:37,160
 So there's a Cassini spacecraft, did analysis for a really long time of what the wings were

42
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:42,920
 composed of, the mostly ice, and the ice is made of water, which then of course I had a question

43
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:47,040
 mark, what is other ice made of, they kept calling it water ice, but then I realized I've

44
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,360
 gone too far off the fact.

45
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,360
 Okay.

46
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,360
 Come back.

47
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:55,680
 One percent of them is dust, and they've measured the rate of accumulation, how dusty

48
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,800
 they're getting, and then worked backwards from that one percent to say they can't be any

49
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:05,120
 older than a hundred years, a hundred million years I should say, and they could be as new

50
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,920
 as ten million years old.

51
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,920
 Wow.

52
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,920
 Okay.

53
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,400
 So that's from the amount of dust accumulation.

54
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:16,040
 The reason, and I'll stress this straight away, that they could be a lot older, is because

55
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:20,960
 they could be cleaning themselves, because there's a pool from the planet, which takes a lot

56
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,360
 of debris away from it.

57
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:29,520
 So basically, when Micrometeroids hit the rings of Saturn, they are either vaporised or they've

58
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,880
 pulled towards Saturn's magnetic field, which would explain why there would be less dust

59
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,720
 there than you could completely just age it.

60
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,760
 All the dust that's ever been collected by Saturn's pool hasn't stayed in the rings essentially,

61
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:44,840
 which is where aging them that way could be slightly contentious.

62
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,840
 Okay.

63
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,840
 And what about sharks?

64
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,200
 Okay, so sharks, they're saying they're claiming.

65
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:54,520
 I don't know what you've written down, that they are four hundred and fifty million years

66
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,520
 old.

67
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,520
 Yes, okay.

68
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,520
 Right, okay.

69
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:03,400
 And their evidence for this, some scales, no teeth, they've got some fossilised scales from

70
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,480
 four hundred and fifty million years old, which they're saying is that earliest fossil

71
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:11,640
 of a shark, like creature, which is not a shark, is it?

72
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,880
 That's a shark, like creature.

73
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,880
 Okay.

74
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,880
 And then no teeth.

75
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:22,400
 So, are we thinking a gummy shark, like no teeth shark?

76
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,640
 What a scary, big, scary fish, I know which one is what a shark is in lots of ways.

77
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:29,040
 But hang on Sarah, all of this, all of this smacks of a woman who submitted the fact and

78
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,040
 then researched it.

79
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,040
 Yes.

80
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,040
 Yes.

81
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,040
 You're on that?

82
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,040
 Okay.

83
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,040
 What's the accusation there, Andy?

84
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,560
 That's what she did what we asked her to do.

85
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,560
 No, because some people, it's like their actual passion, is that what you mean?

86
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,560
 No, no, no.

87
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,440
 People are like, "Oh, I wrote a book about that, that's really something."

88
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:50,040
 It's funny how honest you are, but it is like it, because you know, like a lesser research

89
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:53,200
 I might have just said, "Yeah, I'll just sort of find that."

90
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,200
 I would have done that.

91
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,200
 Yeah, I would have done that.

92
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,200
 And they would have done that.

93
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,880
 And it said, "So, the fact is that the rings are this old and sharks are this old."

94
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,880
 Yes.

95
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,880
 And one's younger than the other, and that's it.

96
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:06,040
 No, actually, what I did write down was that Cassini spacecraft, born on the 15th

97
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,840
 of October 1997, so it's a Libra.

98
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,840
 Oh, you love it.

99
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,840
 Yeah, that is good.

100
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,360
 Getting my astrology and astronomy all in the same way, all in the same explanation.

101
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:20,960
 So sharks have survived the five, yeah, the five known mass extinctions that we've had

102
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,960
 on this planet.

103
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:22,960
 Are they involved somehow?

104
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,160
 It does seem suspicious.

105
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,160
 Yeah.

106
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,160
 Always there.

107
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,160
 Yeah.

108
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,760
 I think it was after the first mass extinction that teeth suddenly became a part of their

109
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,760
 life.

110
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,760
 Yeah.

111
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,360
 Although the jaws were different in those earlier creatures.

112
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,360
 Yeah.

113
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,200
 So now they have jaws that open really widely, which mean they can swim faster and they

114
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,200
 can eat prey bigger than themselves.

115
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,200
 So that's exciting.

116
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,880
 But that's much more recent.

117
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:51,760
 We're talking 150 million years ago with those recognizable actual sharks.

118
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:56,760
 And like 10 million to 100 million with the rings of Saturn, what are you saying as the

119
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,160
 closest scale than 400 plus male-scale scales?

120
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,800
 Okay, so here's the timeline I wrote down.

121
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:08,120
 So I wrote sharks as the earliest fossil was the late Ordova vision period.

122
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,040
 So basically that would make them older than dinosaurs and older and trees.

123
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,040
 Really fun.

124
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,840
 Trees are 360 million years old, which is fun.

125
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,920
 Would they know anything about trees as in like they're not seeing trees anyway, right?

126
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,920
 Absolutely not.

127
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,920
 So that's relevant to their world.

128
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,920
 Oh, damn.

129
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,920
 You get like tree falling in there.

130
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,920
 Absolutely.

131
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,920
 So they might see a fall in there.

132
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,920
 So they'll be like that.

133
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,920
 They'll see a log.

134
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,920
 But they can't fall before they exist.

135
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,920
 That's the thing.

136
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:32,040
 If a tree falls before it exists, does it make a nose?

137
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,040
 Does it splash?

138
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,040
 It was.

139
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,600
 They famously got good hearing sharks.

140
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,880
 So that would be good distances.

141
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,880
 Or is it smell?

142
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,880
 A smell?

143
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,880
 Can they smell trees?

144
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,880
 There's a few people say, shh.

145
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,880
 And I can't see them.

146
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,880
 I can't see it.

147
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,880
 I can't see it.

148
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,880
 Don't bleed into the water.

149
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:50,960
 So we've got a mass extinction event in the Permian period.

150
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:57,000
 That's 252 million years ago or around then that 96% of marine life was wiped out.

151
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,400
 So we had bigger sharks and there is fossil records just teeth of these massive sharks.

152
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,400
 Are you saying just teeth?

153
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,160
 Earlier on it was like, oh, they don't even have teeth.

154
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,160
 Exactly.

155
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,160
 How suspicious is this?

156
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:11,280
 You always find crimes and then investigate them on this show.

157
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,440
 Do you know why they keep surviving all of these mass extinctions?

158
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,920
 It's really interesting because they're so varied as a class of creatures.

159
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,680
 So you get sharks that live on the bottom.

160
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,720
 You get sharks that live in the main water column in a higher over the ocean.

161
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,720
 You get small sharks.

162
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,720
 You get big sharks.

163
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,080
 You get sharks that are some sharks that are even mostly vegetarian.

164
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,920
 You get just sharks of every different kind.

165
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:36,600
 That's why always a few of them will fit through the keyhole of whatever life survives

166
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,600
 the mass extinction event.

167
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,600
 Which is amazing isn't it?

168
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,600
 It did go down.

169
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:44,960
 One of my tendons was the green and shark, which grows incredibly slowly, which is a really

170
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,680
 good example of what you're describing.

171
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,400
 They don't become sexually active until they're over a hundred.

172
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,400
 Yeah.

173
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,400
 Which is really inspiring.

174
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:55,240
 Here's an amazing thing about them.

175
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:59,200
 It's been estimated that they can live probably up to 500 years.

176
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,000
 There's one that's been found that definitely is around 400 years old.

177
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,200
 Now the rings of Saturn, the first observation through telescope was Galileo on 1610.

178
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:13,560
 Arguably there is a green and shark out there alive that was born before Galileo first looked

179
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,560
 at them through a telescope.

180
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:20,360
 I thought you were going to say that could have seen the rings of Saturn through that telescope

181
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,880
 unless it fell into the water.

182
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,880
 Unless they could hear it.

183
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,880
 I think that's going to happen under you.

184
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,880
 It's amazing isn't it?

185
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,880
 That's mad potentially.

186
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,880
 There's one out there that was yeah.

187
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,880
 Yeah.

188
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,880
 We've got the topic.

189
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,880
 Sharks.

190
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,880
 Yeah.

191
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,880
 Yeah.

192
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,880
 Give us a shark.

193
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,880
 That's favorite shark.

194
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,880
 I'll tell you mine.

195
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,880
 Yeah okay.

196
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,880
 Wow.

197
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,880
 Let's guess.

198
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,880
 I'm going to guess Hammerhead.

199
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,880
 No.

200
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,880
 James.

201
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,880
 Hammerhead.

202
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,880
 No.

203
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,880
 I do like Hammerheads.

204
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,880
 They're the youngest species.

205
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,880
 Apparently the newest one.

206
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,880
 Hello.

207
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,880
 Really?

208
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,880
 Well, I've had another one that's been quite new.

209
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,880
 I think it's maybe not quite as new as Hammerheads, but the walking sharks that you get off the

210
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,880
 coast of Australia.

211
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,880
 They live on the bottom.

212
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,880
 They're one of Andy's bottom sharks.

213
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,880
 Yeah.

214
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,880
 But they walk on the bottom sharks.

215
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:10,880
 It's my channel five series of the future.

216
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,880
 People who want to watch a show about animals are going to be very disciplined.

217
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:19,880
 It's very much an urban dictionary thing.

218
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,880
 No, these are like walking sharks.

219
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,880
 Yeah.

220
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,880
 And they use their fins and they walk like geckos on the bottom of the ocean.

221
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,880
 Wow.

222
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,880
 That is cool.

223
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,880
 Can they swim?

224
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,880
 They can swim, yeah, but not very well.

225
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,880
 Quite like the Thresher shark.

226
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,880
 Oh yeah.

227
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:36,880
 But it's just, it's an odd move that they use, which is, it's been described as extreme yoga.

228
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:41,160
 Basically, if they're coming up to a fish, rather than directly eat it, they'll bring their

229
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,880
 tail up back around them and slap it and stun it.

230
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,880
 Wow.

231
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,880
 Yeah.

232
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,880
 That's great.

233
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,800
 Usually a lot of them, they'll eat by opening their mouths and just swimming with their mouths

234
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,880
 open and seeing what goes in there, right?

235
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,880
 Yeah.

236
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,880
 And there's a big problem with that.

237
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,080
 A paper I read just this morning, which was that basically because of the water is more acidic

238
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,880
 and the oceans now, it's rotting their teeth.

239
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,880
 Oh.

240
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,880
 And so they have quite crumbly teeth now, sharks, compared to what they were 100 years ago.

241
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,880
 Wow.

242
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,880
 So, later people think we didn't have any sharks.

243
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,880
 There's no evidence.

244
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,880
 Yes.

245
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,880
 Yeah.

246
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,880
 They all crumbled away.

247
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,880
 Yeah.

248
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,880
 Can I give you guys my favourite shark?

249
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,880
 Yeah.

250
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,880
 It's from this morning.

251
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,880
 For the programme.

252
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,880
 For lip skull fields, it was a shark.

253
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:30,200
 No, this is a listener email from Alison Mullencamp, who sent us an email this morning on

254
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,200
 the day we recalled this.

255
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,200
 Oh yeah.

256
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,880
 Headlined "Ghost Shark Sex Teeth."

257
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,880
 Okay.

258
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,880
 This is crazy.

259
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,880
 And you opened it?

260
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,880
 Oh yeah.

261
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,880
 It's gonna be great for us.

262
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,880
 And it's awesome sharks.

263
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:43,360
 Basically, there's a thing called a ghost shark.

264
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,920
 It's also known as a spotted ratfish.

265
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,920
 I suspect it prefers to go by ghost shark.

266
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,920
 I'll take the other name back.

267
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,920
 Yeah.

268
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,920
 It was just so fast.

269
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,920
 Yeah.

270
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,920
 I'm trying to push a cool nickname on themselves.

271
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:55,920
 A spotted rat?

272
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,920
 No, it's ghost shark actually.

273
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,920
 Yeah.

274
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,440
 That's what they call me at university.

275
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,440
 So it's not a true shark, but it looks a lot like a shark, you know, and it gets called

276
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,440
 it.

277
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,240
 And it's got a thing on its forehead called the tenaculum.

278
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,480
 It's got these tiny protrusions on it, and scientists have just today published a paper

279
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:16,680
 about what this thing is and what it is is this little thing sticking out of its head has

280
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,680
 these scales on it.

281
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,680
 It turns out they're not scales.

282
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,680
 They're actual teeth.

283
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:25,000
 They're literal teeth sticking out of its head, which it uses to grip onto the female during

284
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 sex.

285
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 Okay.

286
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 It's got a head hand.

287
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 It's got a head hand, which it uses for sex grips.

288
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 And it's just a whole lot of fish.

289
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,280
 Does the female have one on her head to hit the other?

290
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,280
 No, I don't think so.

291
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,280
 Guys, well, away.

292
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,280
 She has nothing.

293
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,280
 Just a ponytail.

294
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,280
 I think she's one.

295
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,280
 Yeah.

296
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:45,440
 And so one of the scientists responsible, Carly Cohen said, "This feature flips the long-standing

297
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,640
 assumption in evolutionary biology that teeth are strictly oral structures."

298
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,640
 And they...

299
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,960
 I thought that their skin was teeth as well, though.

300
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,960
 I thought that definitely...

301
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,960
 I think it's shaped like teeth.

302
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:59,280
 But I think that teeth evolved from the skin, so it was scales around them, I've got

303
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,280
 harder and harder.

304
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,920
 Which seems to be the same as this other idea.

305
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,920
 It's just utilising.

306
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,920
 Oh, they're also good for this.

307
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:09,160
 Imagine Sabrina Carpenter's album cover, because it was really sort of anti-it, and

308
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,960
 it's been done before we've moved positive.

309
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,960
 Imagine if it had been this ghost shot.

310
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,480
 She's sort of on her knees with...

311
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,480
 Yeah.

312
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,440
 But she's sort of being held by, you know, looking up at her...

313
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,440
 But I think next album.

314
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,440
 Yeah, next one.

315
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,440
 That's true, actually.

316
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,440
 Or maybe Chapel Roan.

317
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:26,200
 I'm sort of imagining your TV program.

318
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,880
 I've imagined lots of the dancers at the beginning, because it's got this like Euro-Trash

319
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,880
 feel.

320
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,280
 And they've all got like big, big, sharp heads, and then they're all wearing chaps.

321
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,800
 So when they turn around, they turn around and you can see their bottoms.

322
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,760
 Do you remember that Super Bowl when they had the Dancing Shark?

323
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,760
 Yes.

324
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,760
 Like that, but a bit sexier.

325
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,760
 Yeah.

326
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,760
 Okay.

327
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,760
 Chat that with Chapsong.

328
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,760
 Yeah.

329
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,760
 And is it just me enjoying these dances?

330
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,400
 I mean, you just speak to camera at the beginning like, "Hi, I'm Andy, and here every

331
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,400
 week is sharp quick."

332
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:57,600
 And then it's just like a fancy castle and stuff like that.

333
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,600
 I'll do it.

334
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,600
 Yeah.

335
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,600
 I will take that job.

336
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,600
 Okay.

337
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:09,320
 It is time for fact number two, and that is my fact.

338
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:13,440
 My fact this week is that because he didn't like the name of the novel that he was adapting

339
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:18,760
 into a movie, director Ridley Scott bought the film rights to a William Burrers novel called

340
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:22,320
 Blade Runner, just so he could steal that title instead.

341
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,320
 Nice.

342
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,320
 Brilliant.

343
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,320
 Yeah.

344
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,320
 Really good.

345
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,320
 Yeah.

346
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,320
 It's quite fascinating.

347
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,720
 So I've just read Do Android's Dream of Electric Sheep, which is a book by Philip K.

348
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,720
 It's a great title.

349
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,720
 It's a great title.

350
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,720
 It's a great title.

351
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,720
 It's a solid one.

352
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,720
 That's right.

353
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,760
 It's a commercial title for a movie.

354
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:42,320
 If you don't know Philip K. Dick, he was a pretty extraordinary sci-fi writer.

355
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:47,160
 He was writing in the '50s and '60s, and he has had so many of his books that have gone

356
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,160
 to the big screen.

357
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,920
 So you might have seen Total Recall with Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Adjustment Bureau

358
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,760
 Minority Reporter Scanner, Darkly, and Blade Runner, probably the most famous of all

359
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,200
 of those, starring Harris and Ford.

360
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:04,040
 And so initially Ridley Scott was brought on to this project, and there was a screenwriter

361
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:08,920
 on it called Hampton Fancher, and Hampton Fancher decided that while he was writing it, he

362
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:13,720
 would put in the draft the name Blade Runner, which he'd seen from another book.

363
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,720
 And it was just there.

364
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,400
 And Ridley Scott, who took on the project, started reading Do Android's Dream of Electric Sheep,

365
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,400
 but didn't like it.

366
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,400
 So put it down.

367
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,520
 So he didn't end up even reading the book he made into a movie.

368
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:28,080
 He saw that title on the screenplay and said, "This is way better.

369
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,080
 Let's use that."

370
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,120
 But obviously it was connected to another book.

371
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,720
 So he literally bought the movie rights to that and used nothing but the title.

372
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,720
 So can I ask a question?

373
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,720
 Yeah.

374
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,720
 You said it was by William Burroughs.

375
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,720
 Mm-hmm.

376
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,720
 VG.

377
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,720
 Yeah.

378
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,960
 But he didn't write the original.

379
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,960
 So what's going on there?

380
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,960
 So, okay.

381
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,960
 So this is so weird.

382
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,960
 Yeah.

383
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,960
 It just gets so complicated.

384
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:50,800
 The story, the book that William Burroughs had written was called Blade Runner, the

385
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,800
 movie.

386
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:56,920
 So William Burroughs had read a different book by a guy called Alan E. Norse and that was

387
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,080
 called The Blade Runner.

388
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:04,840
 And so Burroughs' book was a treatment for a movie that he wanted to have made.

389
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:08,760
 But was his book based on Norse's book or is there a difference?

390
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,760
 Yeah, it was.

391
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,760
 It was.

392
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,760
 It was basically a movie treatment.

393
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:16,280
 So Norse's book was, the reason it's called Blade Runner is because it's about a guy

394
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,840
 who takes medical supplies across America.

395
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,960
 So literally, scalpals and smuggling them.

396
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:26,040
 Yeah, because it's basically an anti-NHS book, isn't it?

397
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:30,480
 Basically in America, if you've got money, you can't pay for your own healthcare.

398
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,480
 You have to only go for the government thing and the government thing isn't very good.

399
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:39,760
 And so you have these sort of dodgy private doctors who will do your stuff for you, but they

400
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,760
 need the scalpals.

401
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,680
 So they need the Blade Runner.

402
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,840
 And the main protagonist in that book is called Billy Gimp.

403
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:49,720
 It's just a good character name.

404
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,720
 It's a great name.

405
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,720
 It's hard to think of names for the characters, isn't it?

406
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,720
 Absolutely.

407
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,720
 You've got to say what you see.

408
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,720
 Look around you.

409
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,720
 Whatever you see first.

410
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,560
 So the thing we've all glossed over, there have been a lot of names flying about.

411
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,880
 Hampton, Fancher, Ridley Scott, none of them very likely, right?

412
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:08,200
 The original book that used the title Blade Runner was by this guy, Alan Norse, I pronounce

413
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,080
 it Nurse, and he was a trained doctor.

414
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,880
 Oh, lovely.

415
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,520
 And do you remember there was a scientist about 20 years ago?

416
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,960
 He won the Nobel Prize for Medicine.

417
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,960
 Paul Nurse.

418
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,960
 Paul Nurse.

419
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:19,960
 Paul Nurse.

420
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:20,960
 What's all these doctors called Nurse?

421
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,560
 I have tried to find a nurse whose name was Doctor, but I haven't succeeded yet.

422
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,720
 But I'll keep looking.

423
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,800
 He wrote to the name Doctor Rex, didn't he?

424
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,800
 I did, he.

425
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,800
 Yeah, yeah.

426
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,480
 He didn't really use his name because he didn't want people to know he was writing.

427
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,480
 Taffer.

428
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,480
 Yeah.

429
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:39,160
 Doctor Rex, but he mostly wrote abusive 140 character messages.

430
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,520
 So Blade Runner, I actually bought it the other night to watch.

431
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,520
 We'll film.

432
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,360
 Yeah, because I haven't seen it in years.

433
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,240
 So this is the other fascinating thing about the movie Blade Runner.

434
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,200
 There's been, since its release, seven different versions of it that have come out.

435
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:57,160
 It's constantly being revised by the director and by the production companies, so there was

436
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,880
 a director's cut that came out, which actually wasn't a director's cut because someone else

437
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,880
 put it together.

438
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,920
 Ridley Scott just gave an approval, but the official one, according to Ridley Scott, is

439
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,920
 the final cut, which doesn't have the narration.

440
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,920
 The 25th year anniversary one.

441
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:13,080
 It's the only one that he was allowed to do the cut that he actually wanted.

442
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:17,400
 And also, the story of it's quite interesting in that, so it was made by about 30 million

443
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,400
 dollars.

444
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,280
 And it made about 40 million dollars at the cinema, so it did fine.

445
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,600
 It didn't do that well.

446
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,800
 But when they re-edited it, it was amazing.

447
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,680
 And it was the first thing they brought out on DVD.

448
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,680
 I was there.

449
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,960
 And then it did so much better with a sort of slight re-editing.

450
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,960
 Ah, it was me.

451
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,520
 Yes, it wasn't popular at first, and it got some really bad reviews.

452
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,400
 One of the reviews said Blade Runner is a suspenseless thriller, which I think is

453
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,400
 to a certain extent true.

454
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,400
 It was sort of slow.

455
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,080
 Was it intentionally slow?

456
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,080
 It is quite slow.

457
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,960
 For anyone who hasn't seen it, it's about Harrison Ford who has to chase down a load of robots

458
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,880
 who are running around dressed up as humans.

459
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,880
 And he's a clear name.

460
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,480
 The main point of it, and the main point of Dick I think, and I haven't read that or seen

461
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,480
 the movie.

462
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:59,760
 I think it's like, can an android tell if they're human, and if so, how do you tell it?

463
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:05,440
 Well, this is the Boyd Kempft test, which I've got the questions of if you want me to

464
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,440
 test your robots.

465
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,440
 Have you?

466
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,440
 I was like a personality test to see if we're robots.

467
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,440
 I don't need the test.

468
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,440
 I'm well aware.

469
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,560
 But make a lot of sense of a lot of things in your life.

470
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:17,240
 In the book itself, do you know what they're called or these replicants?

471
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,880
 I thought they were called replicants.

472
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,880
 That's in the movies.

473
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,240
 Yeah, in the book they're called Andy's.

474
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,240
 Love it.

475
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,240
 The plot sickens.

476
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,240
 Stop fighting crime.

477
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,240
 So here we go.

478
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:33,840
 So some of them actually sort of a little bit upsetting.

479
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:39,320
 You have a little boy, and he shows you his butterfly collection, including his killing

480
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,320
jar.

481
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,320
 Oh, dear.

482
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,320
 Yeah.

483
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,680
 So, I mean, it doesn't have a question mark on it, but I guess it's testing.

484
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,480
 Do you have an emotional reaction to that?

485
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,480
 Okay.

486
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,480
 Here you go.

487
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,480
 We can all go round.

488
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,280
 Describe in single words only the good things that come into your mind about your mother.

489
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,280
 Killingjar.

490
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,960
 Single words.

491
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,960
 Fun.

492
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,960
 Sexy.

493
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:06,520
 I'd also like to enter the word "sexy" for don't much.

494
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:12,560
 I think when Freud says you get full marks, so this one, my brief case, nice, isn't it?

495
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:17,240
 Department issue, baby hide, 100% genuine human baby hide.

496
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,240
 Okay.

497
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,920
 So I guess, yeah, it's supposed to make you fit.

498
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,400
 So if you're upset about that, you're probably human.

499
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,400
 Yeah.

500
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,400
 I have a strong reaction.

501
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,400
 You don't just take it on face value.

502
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,320
 You have an emotional reaction.

503
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,320
 I think that's the test.

504
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:33,000
 And in the movie and in the book, they have a machine that specifically is looking directly

505
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 into your eyeball.

506
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 So it's the dilation of the piece?

507
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 Exactly.

508
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,080
 The question is answered by your body.

509
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,080
 I see.

510
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,080
 Yeah.

511
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,080
 Exactly.

512
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,840
 It is a good film and it is a good book.

513
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:44,840
 It looks great, yeah.

514
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:45,840
 Yeah.

515
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,680
 But I think they are quite ponderous.

516
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,360
 Come at me in the comments if you disagree.

517
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,600
 What's the film you like, then, that you prefer in this sort of genre?

518
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,640
 He likes Pacific Rim.

519
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,640
 What's Pacific Rim?

520
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:01,120
 Well, big monsters have started coming up through the cracks in the ocean floor from

521
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,120
 another dimension.

522
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,840
 We've got to build giant robots to fight them.

523
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,840
 Wow.

524
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,760
 Exciting at the side of Andy's bottom.

525
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:11,320
 Oh, I'm saying this in that in Pacific Rim, everyone knows who isn't a robot and we can crack

526
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:14,720
 on with the real meat in the film, which is beating the monsters, the Kaiju.

527
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,720
 Oh, I see.

528
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,720
 Do you see what I mean?

529
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,720
 Yes.

530
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,000
 Harrison Ford isn't interrogating the robots because you don't like subtlety.

531
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,080
 I'm saying I like Obviousness.

532
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,680
 There was one of the reviews of Blade Runner when it came out that said some of the scenes

533
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:31,080
 seem to have six subtexts, but no text and no context either.

534
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,080
 Wow.

535
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:36,720
 I think it's so interesting because the questions that they were asking then about what are the

536
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:41,440
 capabilities of these machines that are working alongside us, are the questions that we are

537
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,440
 continuing to ask.

538
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,360
 The only thing that's changed is the technology.

539
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,840
 We're still asking those same things, aren't we?

540
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:50,280
 Really, when I read it, it's incredibly poignant for what's going on right now in the world

541
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,280
 of AI, because extraordinary.

542
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,360
 I guess that's the thing of a good sci-fi writer like Philip K. Dick.

543
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:58,600
 It's looking forward and seeing the problems we might run into, but it's also worth saying

544
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,400
 the book is incredibly different from the movie.

545
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:05,120
 So there's an idea that you're asking the question, is Harrison Ford a replicant himself?

546
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,120
 Yeah.

547
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,840
 Harrison Ford said he wasn't, Ridley Scott said he was.

548
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,680
 So we don't even know from the filmmakers side which one is which.

549
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,920
 Which one of those two people wrote the...

550
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,920
 Neither.

551
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,880
 We need to ask the person who wrote the script.

552
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,880
 Yes, exactly.

553
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,880
 Paul Hampton fan.

554
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,880
 Yeah.

555
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:25,400
 Quite clearly a robot panicking to try to think of a human name.

556
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,520
 Have you guys seen the movie Taking Tiger Mountain?

557
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,520
 No, what happens in that?

558
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,520
 I think so.

559
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:33,880
 What happens in that is what happens in the Blade Runner, the original book, because it eventually

560
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,760
 was adapted into a movie.

561
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,480
 And that was starring Bill Paxton.

562
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:44,080
 So the novel that William Burrow's wrote, Blade Runner brackets a movie, was off the back

563
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:48,760
 of the original Alan Norse novel, Blade Runner.

564
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,760
 Yeah.

565
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,800
 And it was a pitch for it to be a screenplay and then he realised it probably wasn't going

566
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,800
 to be adapted.

567
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:57,080
 So he turned it, Burrow's turned his work into a novella.

568
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:02,080
 What that means is that he wrote the novel of the pitch, of the film, of the novel.

569
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,080
 Oh.

570
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,080
 Interesting.

571
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:10,240
 And then Philip K. Dick was asked to write the novel of the movie, Blade Runner, yes.

572
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,520
 Of the book that he wrote.

573
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,520
 Of his own book.

574
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,520
 Yeah.

575
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:17,840
 But he refused brilliant because he thought that if he did that, people would stop buying

576
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,840
 his book.

577
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,840
 Yeah.

578
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,840
 When that been amazing.

579
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:21,840
 It's so weird.

580
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,840
 It's so strange.

581
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,840
 It's just the whole...

582
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,680
 I mean, this is probably the most confusing section we've ever done for an audience.

583
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,680
 We're trying to piece these together.

584
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:30,160
 We need a big wall chart, don't we, with lines.

585
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:35,000
 Even that movie that I just mentioned, taking Tiger Mountain, which was the adaption of

586
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,360
 the Blade Runner original book.

587
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,360
 Pre-Burrow's.

588
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,360
 Yeah.

589
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:45,760
 There was a movie that was made, which was based on a art film by Albert Camus, his book

590
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,080
 called The Stranger.

591
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:49,960
 They filmed the whole thing, but they didn't do any dialogue for it because they thought

592
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,200
 they'd do that post.

593
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:56,600
 A new director came in, used all that stuff, but applied the Blade Runner.

594
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,600
 No.

595
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,600
 Who it?

596
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,480
 Well, you think of the editor, please, while you're saying these facts.

597
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,480
 It's so confusing.

598
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:08,080
 What's going to happen, James, is this section of the podcast, in years to come, there are

599
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,080
 going to be seven or eight different cuts of this section of the podcast.

600
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,360
 They'll be the harking cut, sure.

601
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,360
 But they'll be the Shriver Cut.

602
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:20,280
 But people, people quite often listen to podcasts to fall asleep, and this bit, they'll

603
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:24,960
 think, is there subconscious, chopping it into different pieces and making it confusing,

604
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,960
 so they're not really listening properly.

605
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:29,280
 That sort of makes you think, we must have enough stuff filmed by now that we can basically

606
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,280
 make everything new.

607
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,720
 Let's just use our existing stuff.

608
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:36,600
 In the future, they're going to say, do you know the famous TV show and these bottom

609
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:40,640
 sharks was actually based on a podcast?

610
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,120
 Yeah.

611
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:45,880
 And bizarrely, Andy, what you just said, with having extra footage that we can just reuse,

612
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:49,560
 that actually happened for Blade Runner the movie itself, because in the final scenes,

613
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:54,520
 they used shots from the shining that weren't used in the main movie, and included it

614
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:57,200
 as sort of background shots.

615
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,200
 So the shining is in the Blade Runner movie.

616
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,200
 Bloody hell.

617
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,200
 Yeah.

618
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,200
 It goes deep, doesn't it?

619
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,200
 It really does go deep.

620
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:08,360
 Isn't it true that the Alien World, the Blade Runner World, are one world together?

621
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:11,880
 I was hoping this, but I haven't, she's watched them all and I haven't.

622
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,880
 Interesting.

623
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:17,280
 But I think there's like one mention in the second Alien that says, yes, they're definitely

624
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,280
 the same world.

625
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,280
 That's terrific.

626
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:22,680
 Because it might be things like the same company operating across the, because in Alien,

627
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,840
 the whole thing is the wayland, you tiny corporation.

628
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,240
 And that might get a mention and played it out, I don't know.

629
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,240
 That's brilliant.

630
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:34,080
 Can I tell you a thing about William Burrows, the author who wrote, one of these, one of these

631
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,080
 things.

632
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,080
 Yeah.

633
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,280
 So he was a big generation writer, a very interesting person.

634
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,080
 I didn't really know anything about him.

635
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:45,200
 The only thing I'd vaguely heard of, which is the awful thing in his life, which is that

636
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,920
 he and his wife once had taken a huge amount of drugs, and he tried to do a William

637
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:53,280
 tell act shooting something off her head, and he missed and he shot her and he killed her.

638
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,440
 I think that's his version.

639
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,760
 He was a really strange guy.

640
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,560
 He was very eccentric.

641
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,600
 He was on, huge numbers of drugs his whole life.

642
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:07,320
 He said that he could just stare at his shoes for eight hours a day and frequently did.

643
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:11,600
 But do you know how Burrows had this lifestyle and was able to just sort of, so where his money

644
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,600
 came from?

645
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,600
 Yeah.

646
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,800
 Rich parents.

647
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,480
 He got an allowance from his parents until he was nearly 50.

648
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,480
 Right.

649
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:23,080
 And what he got an allowance from his parents until he was nearly 50 is that his grandfather,

650
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:27,400
 William Seward Burrows, the first, our William Burrows was the second.

651
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,680
 He had invented the Burrows Adding Machine.

652
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:35,080
 It was a calculator and pretty much every business in America bought one of these adding

653
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,080
 machines.

654
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,080
 It was incredibly useful.

655
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:40,400
 Is it one of those ones that you see in old movies where they can, it's like a big calculator

656
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,200
 and they go, "Pah, pah, pah, pah, pah, pah, pah, pah, pah, pah, pah."

657
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,200
 Pretty much.

658
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,200
 And it prints out.

659
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,200
 It prints out a real, yeah.

660
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,200
 Exactly.

661
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:52,280
 And it's the biggest American computing companies in the 50s and 60s.

662
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,880
 And what is this?

663
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,840
 It's a robot, a thinking machine.

664
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,840
 Oh, I see.

665
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:01,000
 And it's, it sort of allows blade runner to, right?

666
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 Yeah.

667
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 Yeah.

668
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 Yeah.

669
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 Okay.

670
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 Sure.

671
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 So Philip K. Dick took words of drugs as well.

672
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 Yeah.

673
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 He was into the same things.

674
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 And apparently, in his life, he sort of saw like a rosy mist and all these kind of, he

675
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,600
 had, he had, in his final period of his life, it was in 1974.

676
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:21,080
 He saw a fish symbol and necklace on a woman glow red.

677
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:25,320
 And he felt information suddenly just was transmitted to him.

678
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,880
 And he believed that it was from an alien species.

679
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,880
 Yeah.

680
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,400
 That's why I'm an excuse when you're staring at a woman's dress.

681
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,400
 Yeah.

682
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,400
 Sorry.

683
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,400
 There's information coming.

684
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,400
 Yeah.

685
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:42,400
 Okay.

686
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,400
 It is time for fact number three.

687
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,400
 And that is James.

688
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:48,240
 Because that most people wouldn't wear a sweater owned by Hitler.

689
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:53,120
 But they might if Mother Teresa wore it for long enough in between.

690
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,400
 So has she won this in like an eBay auction?

691
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,200
 Like how did she get her hands on this?

692
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,200
 She's bought it.

693
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,200
 Yeah.

694
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,120
 Did she dry clean it after Hitler?

695
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,760
 Has anyone cleaned it ever?

696
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:09,040
 Well, this is a study called the contagion concept in adult thinking in the United States

697
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:12,520
 by Carol Nemeroff and Paul Rosen.

698
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:15,840
 And there's lots of different things that they did with this imaginary jumper.

699
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,840
 So they had different people wear it.

700
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:22,960
 So it might be Hitler, but it might be a lover of the person you're interviewing or it

701
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:29,920
 might be someone they really admire or it might be that they rub it in dog poo or various

702
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:30,920
 different things.

703
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,920
 Yeah.

704
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:38,360
 And then they try and ameliorate the effect by giving it to a nice person or they might

705
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:43,200
 clean it with detergent or just with water or boil it or deodorize it.

706
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,200
 This is all imaginary.

707
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,200
 This is all made up.

708
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,200
 Okay.

709
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,840
 And did they ever show you a picture of the jumper?

710
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,840
 Yeah.

711
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,840
 Or have you imagined it?

712
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,840
 You imagine it.

713
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:56,640
 It's simply a question of, would you wear this jumper if this had happened to it?

714
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,600
 And then they took all of the different results of what everyone said and then generalised

715
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,200
 to the entire world.

716
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:06,840
 So, but actually they generalised to people in the US and the reason being that there's

717
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:11,120
 this kind of thing called the Law of Contagion, which is a folk belief that you get all around

718
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:16,560
 the world where if you've been in contact with an object, then people think some of your

719
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,760
 attributes go into that object.

720
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:24,680
 It happens in Papua New Guinea, it happens in Africa, it happens in medieval Europe, you

721
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:28,720
 get it quite a lot of, but this study was to see if it happened in the US as well.

722
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,880
 And what they found is the basics is that people would not wear anything that was worn

723
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:39,240
 by Hitler, but they might wear it if someone good like Mother Teresa or someone sexy had

724
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,240
 worn it in between.

725
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,240
 And they would probably...

726
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,600
 What are we saying Mother Teresa is not sexy, that's what we mean.

727
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,560
 She looks so much like Dan Sommar.

728
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:54,640
 Yeah, so Princess Diana, someone else who's sort of seeing this go into the US.

729
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,640
 Sure, absolutely.

730
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,640
 Yeah.

731
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,360
 Because at the start they interview people and said, "Who do you think is good?

732
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,360
 Who do you think is sexy?

733
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,360
 Who do you think is trustworthy?"

734
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:07,520
 And with the sort of washing and stuff like that, basically, if you wash it or if you deodorise

735
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:14,640
 it or if you air it out, people are slightly more likely to wear it, but if you boil it, then

736
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,640
 they're really more likely to do so.

737
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:20,960
 If you get Hitler's jumper and you give it a good old, very hot wash, then people are

738
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,600
 more likely to wear it after that.

739
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,600
 I think though.

740
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,600
 Yeah, this will.

741
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,600
 Is it wool?

742
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,600
 Yeah.

743
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:31,320
 Because I did try to find evidence of any of Hitler's jumpers going up for auction.

744
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,320
 Yeah.

745
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,320
 Yeah.

746
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,320
 He doesn't seem to have been a big jumper guy.

747
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,320
 No.

748
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,320
 No.

749
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,320
 There's very little whose jacket, wasn't he?

750
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,320
 Who's more jacket?

751
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,720
 Well, one of his jackets did.

752
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:46,760
 In 2016, there was a buyer who spent £600,000 at a single auction on Nazi memorabilia, including

753
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:51,240
 things like the brass canister that contained the hydrogen cyanide that Gurri killed himself

754
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,240
 with.

755
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,240
 Wow.

756
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:56,800
 I mean, quite abstract and quite gory stuff, but one of the things was £210,000 on Hitler's

757
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,800
 jacket.

758
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:58,800
 Right.

759
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,920
 This man from Argentina, who declined to give his name.

760
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,840
 That's a joke, isn't it?

761
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:04,840
 No.

762
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:05,840
 What?

763
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,840
 No.

764
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,840
 He said, I'm not going to tell you my name.

765
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,840
 I am from Argentina.

766
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:09,840
 Oh, my goodness.

767
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:10,840
 I know.

768
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,840
 So we can only speculate.

769
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:13,840
 Yeah.

770
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:14,840
 Crakey.

771
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,840
 There was a thing.

772
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,840
 This guy, Paul Rosen.

773
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:17,840
 Paul Rosen.

774
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,840
 Yeah.

775
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:22,960
 Very interesting character because he's sort of known as the leading authority on disgustingness.

776
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,680
 He spends his life studying disgusting stuff.

777
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:32,040
 And he was saying, if you were put off by the idea of Hitler, to what level would that bleed

778
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,040
 into your life?

779
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:37,680
 Because, for example, any glass of water that you drink in Europe will contain a few molecules

780
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,960
 that would have passed through Hitler.

781
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:45,760
 And so, if you found that out, does that put you off drinking like to what level are you

782
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,760
 wanting an association?

783
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:50,760
 And that's why I have my water ship, Den, from Argentina.

784
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:57,760
 Yeah, no, you're right. I mean, if you did it, sorry, just to ask.

785
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,760
 No, I think I know.

786
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,480
 No, no, I'm not sure that he's put that to the study yet.

787
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,280
 He was sort of talking about the extremes of where you could take the associations with Hitler

788
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,280
 as a contagion.

789
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,280
 And this one's done a few years ago, wasn't it the study genes?

790
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,280
 1994.

791
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:11,520
 Yeah, yeah, so I mean, I don't know how Hitler's reputation has been in America over the last

792
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,520
 few years.

793
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,520
 But how fashion has changed?

794
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,520
 Yeah, fashion has changed.

795
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,520
 How fashion has changed.

796
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,520
 You have a fashion of the same.

797
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,520
 You have a fashion of the same.

798
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,520
 You have a fashion of the same.

799
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,520
 You have a fashion of the same.

800
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:24,160
 That out, I'm sorry, but she and Adolf did not have the same characteristics.

801
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:27,360
 And so this is relevant in real life.

802
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,360
 It's not just that many things.

803
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:32,840
 So things like drinking water, so you mentioned the Hitler water thing, Den.

804
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:33,840
 Yeah.

805
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:38,760
 So Hitler never went to Singapore, but Singapore, as far as I know, I mean, his allies

806
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,760
 got there.

807
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,760
 Never mind.

808
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:46,040
 Point is, Singapore purifies water from sewage water, right?

809
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,840
 And people drink it and it's fine.

810
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,760
 I mean, it's absolutely fine, this water.

811
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,360
 It has been treated.

812
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:55,200
 It doesn't contain any contaminants, anything that you make you will.

813
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,480
 It is clean water.

814
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,960
 But in lots of other places around the world, places which don't have like the space constraints

815
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:02,960
 of Singapore, people object massively to this.

816
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,240
 And it's to do with this contagion theory.

817
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:08,480
 So that is relevant to how we don't know the idea of it.

818
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,480
 It's the idea.

819
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,400
 I mean, water effectively has been boiled.

820
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,400
 Yes.

821
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:16,400
 But our brains are just never going to keep up with something that high concept.

822
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:20,280
 We're always going to add one and one together and go, that's the sewage.

823
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,280
 Yeah.

824
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,280
 Still, yeah.

825
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,280
 What if Hitler's jumper was turned into a scarf?

826
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,320
 Obviously unravelled all the wall and made something different.

827
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,320
 Yeah.

828
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,320
 Well, does that make a big difference?

829
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,000
 It makes a little bit of a difference.

830
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:36,800
 So they asked people if it had been re-knitted, gashed, unravelled, cut up and burned.

831
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,360
 Would you wear it afterwards?

832
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,440
 And burning had the best effects.

833
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,720
 Although it's not going to look like a burnt gem.

834
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:47,320
 Yeah. If it's re-knitted, some people are more likely to a little bit, but burning and

835
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:52,640
 boiling seems to be, people will forgive any ice revolving if you do that.

836
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:57,040
 And the area of this eye-found interesting and discussed, is discussed in a rousal.

837
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,040
 Okay.

838
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,040
 Did you look into that?

839
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,040
 No.

840
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,040
 No.

841
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,040
 Andy.

842
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,040
 Too busy living it.

843
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,040
 What?

844
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,040
 I don't know what that means.

845
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:08,880
 Well, it is really, really, really interesting in human psychology.

846
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:12,280
 So it's a bi-directional psychology.

847
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,280
 Okay.

848
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,320
 So the two things co-exist, discussed in a rousal.

849
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:22,560
 I knew about this because I had read probably in Mary Roach's book Bonk about the fact that when

850
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:28,560
 women are aroused, they will do things that they consider disgusting when they're unaroused.

851
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:33,080
 And that just makes such basic sense for evolution in that section.

852
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:37,920
 What would say, would you mean, like, if I got my wife aroused?

853
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:38,920
 Yeah.

854
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:39,920
 And then I suddenly say, great.

855
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:40,920
 Take the bins out.

856
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,920
 I'm doing tests because you can't.

857
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:43,920
 No, but this is a thing.

858
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:44,920
 So I don't know if you're a wife.

859
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:45,920
 There's a really good example.

860
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,920
 Because I'll see you next time.

861
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:47,920
 So many times.

862
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:48,920
 It's cruel.

863
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:59,000
 So basically, the really common sense thing is, if you ask a woman, what do you think of the

864
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 idea of this sexual act and let's say something really quotidian, like oral sex?

865
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
 Okay.

866
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 That's quotidian.

867
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
 So I go.

868
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:12,160
 So very soberly, most people don't really like the idea of it, but when they're aroused

869
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,520
 that goes out of the window.

870
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,080
 And it only seems to happen with women.

871
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,080
 But I look into it.

872
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,320
 I've had three studies and they're all university students.

873
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:23,280
 And I worry that that's because 22-year-old students are just disgusting anyway, like the

874
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,280
 men.

875
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,080
 So they're very difficult to study.

876
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:31,120
 But what they do, they make them watch arousing videos and then they get them to do different

877
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,120
 tasks.

878
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:35,000
 And some of them are like, eat, have a bite of that biscuit and it's next to a living

879
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
 worm.

880
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 Yeah, yeah.

881
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,080
 People who have watched a physical, sort of soft-core erotica are more likely to bite the

882
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,120
 biscuit and say they didn't discuss them.

883
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,120
 Wow.

884
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,120
 It's amazing.

885
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:47,640
 And they're much more likely to touch what they're told is a bowl of used condoms.

886
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:52,200
 If they've watched this sort of soft pornography, then if they've watched a video of the Olympics,

887
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:55,960
 they just show them physical activity or sexual activity or obviously control group.

888
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:56,960
 Yeah.

889
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:01,040
 And this is men or women, or both, both, but the results seem to be showing a lot more

890
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,040
 for women.

891
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:07,080
 That's an idea for a restaurant, doesn't matter how good the food is, but you just put

892
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:11,200
 porn on the TVs all the time, and people will enjoy the food more.

893
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,200
 Yeah.

894
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:17,200
 Welcome to Andy's bottom feeders.

895
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:22,360
 Did you read about these studies that have shown that conservative people find things

896
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,960
 more disgusting than liberal people?

897
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:29,640
 And it's to such an extent that if you put a scanner on someone's head and you look

898
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:35,200
 at their brain, you can show them one single image of, say, some food with maggots in.

899
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:41,160
 And you can measure their brain activity and you can tell with a 95 to 98% accuracy whether

900
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,920
 they would vote conservative or liberal.

901
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:43,920
 Wow.

902
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:44,920
 Amazing.

903
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:45,920
 Yeah.

904
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,640
 There's lots of reasons why they think it might be the case, so obviously we don't really

905
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:55,160
 know, but it's basically conservatives are a bit more trusting of the natural reactions.

906
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:59,280
 And liberals are more likely to do something called cognitive reappraisal, which is you

907
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,280
 see something disgusting.

908
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:04,200
 But then you think, well, actually, it's just natural that maggots eat food because they're

909
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,200
 animals as well.

910
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:09,040
 And you kind of think about it yourself and come up with reasons about it rather than just

911
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,640
 trusting your initial reaction.

912
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,240
 So can we run elections based on this?

913
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:15,000
 Like, do we need to bother with all the bits of paper and the foods?

914
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,760
 Can't we just all get our heads scanned and be told, let them or whatever?

915
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,760
 Yeah.

916
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,000
 Like a sorting hat, but it's full of maggots.

917
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
 It's fair for trying.

918
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:30,120
 And it was all to get out because people saved the government billions.

919
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:34,800
 One of us here is like clear to be disgusted for the rest of us.

920
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,720
 Ooh, who could it be?

921
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,720
 I love Tories.

922
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:38,720
 Is it me?

923
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:42,480
 Is it someone from the north of England?

924
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,880
 It's not about being from the north of England.

925
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,880
 Right.

926
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:46,880
 And gender?

927
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,880
 It's not gender.

928
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:48,880
 Oh.

929
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:49,880
 Is it?

930
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:50,880
 Glass is wearing glasses.

931
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,880
 It's not glasses.

932
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:52,880
 It's like, guess who now?

933
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,360
 Is it people who like golf?

934
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,240
 It's not even like golf.

935
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,720
 It's something one of us puts in their mouth on a regular basis.

936
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:00,720
 Oh.

937
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,720
 Smoking?

938
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:02,720
 No.

939
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,720
 Being vegan.

940
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,720
 Oh.

941
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,720
 Being vegan.

942
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:09,720
 If you come off meat for a month, you are likely to catch disgust.

943
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:14,440
 So the more people cut out meat droogues, say they're doing veganery, the more their meat

944
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,440
 disgust will grow.

945
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,440
 Oh.

946
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,920
 So I mean, it's actually not, I mean, because you've been a vegan for ages.

947
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:22,200
 Well, I've been a vegetarian since I was seven and I was talking to someone recently

948
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:26,520
 and actually, when I speak to people who give up meat and come back to meat, they have such

949
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,520
 a different response.

950
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,520
 Because for me, it's like cannibalism.

951
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:32,000
 And obviously, I don't talk about this when they're eating their food and it's just a personal

952
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,520
 actually, don't say it out loud because it's not a moral judgment.

953
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,520
 Yeah.

954
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,520
 I do understand that people get to choose their own food.

955
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:42,920
 But for me, there's no difference between a beef burger and oh, yeah, this is a human

956
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,920
 charm.

957
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:44,920
 A human burger.

958
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:45,920
 Yeah, a man burger.

959
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:46,920
 Yeah.

960
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:47,920
 Yeah.

961
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,920
 Long pig.

962
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:49,920
 What's they call it?

963
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,920
 I'm just trying to keep it easy.

964
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:53,920
 You know what?

965
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:54,920
 He likes it too.

966
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:55,920
 He does this all the time.

967
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,120
 Just a lot of these words come out very, very creepy.

968
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,120
 I think that one is a miscreepy.

969
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:03,160
 I'm not afraid of saying that.

970
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:08,400
 So Paul Rosen, I mean, he's done so many studies on this and all of them are interesting.

971
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,840
 I'm just, it's so fascinating what he's done.

972
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,480
 So here's a really interesting one.

973
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,080
 This is all about food, right?

974
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:19,600
 And this is I think from 1986 and he's just been doing decades.

975
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:23,040
 He reported that most participants showed a preference for a normally shaped piece of

976
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,640
 fudge over fudge shaped like dog feces.

977
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:29,080
 Now, I would say so far, so obvious, right?

978
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:33,480
 Many were far less willing to hold fake vomit made of rubber in their mouths than a clean

979
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,160
 new rubber sink stopper.

980
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,160
 Again.

981
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,160
 Yeah.

982
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:39,400
 But yeah, I know he's telling people it's clean.

983
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,400
 That's the thing.

984
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,400
 It's the association.

985
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,400
 You do.

986
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:46,000
 If you go to any tourist shop in England, you can buy poo shapes candy.

987
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
 Hmm.

988
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
 You do.

989
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:53,240
 The first version of this in my life where my, my son, he got really obsessed with the toilet

990
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,320
 brush.

991
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,560
 And so obviously there's two things we had to do.

992
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,600
 One is I bought a brand new toilet brush with a toilet and I bought him his own toilet

993
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:03,120
 brush and it's from the same place.

994
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:07,760
 And no one's comfortable with him playing with it because it's a toilet brush and it's

995
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:11,360
 never been used in the toilet until he did, he did start using it in the toilet because

996
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,360
 he wants the reaction.

997
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:15,040
 But at the beginning, it was just Christmas and everyone was at tonight.

998
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,040
 I was weird.

999
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,960
 No, I get that completely.

1000
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:18,960
 I understand.

1001
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:19,960
 Yeah.

1002
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:20,960
 But it's just a brush.

1003
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,960
 The first ever Christmas tree was made out of toilet brushes and painted green, yeah.

1004
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,840
 So in a way, you would be a very festive.

1005
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:27,840
 Very Christmassy.

1006
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,840
 Yeah.

1007
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,840
 This year, everyone's getting one there.

1008
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,120
 We're the fun fact attached.

1009
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,120
 Yeah.

1010
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,120
 Okay.

1011
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:42,320
 It's time for our final fact of the show and that is Andy.

1012
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:45,840
 My fact is, there is a spider in Norfolk which can catch fish.

1013
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:49,960
 Do you know what the creepiest thing anyone could ever say to you?

1014
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,720
 That's what Carrie had said to me yesterday.

1015
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:54,920
 She said, Andy text me, is Sarah scared of spiders?

1016
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:55,920
 Oh, yeah.

1017
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,160
 That's a creepy thing to hear, isn't it?

1018
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,920
 I asked her not to pass that on.

1019
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:01,920
 She told me that as well.

1020
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:02,920
 She made it creepy.

1021
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:06,080
 He said, he said, not to tell you I've asked.

1022
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,080
 Oh, dear.

1023
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,080
 And you're not too scared of spiders.

1024
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,080
 I'm not scared of spiders, no?

1025
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,080
 Some people are very funny.

1026
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,080
 Yes, yes.

1027
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,080
 So I just wanted to check that out before we...

1028
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:17,600
 Are you asking just to see if we can even talk about the concept of spiders?

1029
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,600
 Yeah.

1030
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,600
 Yeah.

1031
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,600
 Okay.

1032
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:25,760
 And this is the queen of the marsh, the fenn raft spider, Norfolk, and Suffolk as well.

1033
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,360
 Sorry to any Suffolkers who are listening who thought I'd be missing you out.

1034
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,680
 And it's just a really cool spider.

1035
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,320
 It's just about the biggest in the UK, I think.

1036
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,320
 How big is it?

1037
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,320
 Show me your hand.

1038
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,320
 About that big.

1039
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,320
 Great.

1040
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,320
 It's massive.

1041
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,320
 It's broad.

1042
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,320
 Yeah, yeah.

1043
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,320
 It's broad.

1044
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,320
 It's not a big broad.

1045
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,320
 And it's another great story of reintroduction.

1046
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,760
 They got down to a very, very few left.

1047
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:48,640
 And then the people who live around there who are working conservation have restored their

1048
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,960
 habitat load and they've been breeding them up.

1049
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:56,880
 And the RSPB recently announced not so insi-winsi spider makes incredible comeback.

1050
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,640
 And they're really cool.

1051
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,440
 And they're not interested in your house.

1052
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,440
 They don't like you.

1053
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,760
 If you don't like spiders, don't worry.

1054
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,760
 They're not coming for you.

1055
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,760
 Yeah.

1056
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:09,240
 And they can basically sit on top of the water, which is the most fascinating thing if you

1057
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,560
 watch a video with them.

1058
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,560
 Fenn raft spider.

1059
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:12,560
 They are the rough.

1060
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,560
 It's extraordinary.

1061
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:17,080
 It's the hairs as now on the legs that allow them to do that, I think.

1062
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:19,760
 And that also helps them to feel vibration.

1063
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:24,240
 So if a fish is going past, they can just feel the vibration on their little hairs and go

1064
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,240
 fuck.

1065
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,160
 And they run across the water and they grab the fit.

1066
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,160
 I mean, there's sticker packs, obviously.

1067
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,920
 There's not salmon or anything that are catching.

1068
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:30,920
 But they are.

1069
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:31,920
 They're pretty cool.

1070
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:35,800
 They're slightly big relative to the size of the spider itself, you know, because the

1071
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,360
 spider can go underwater as well.

1072
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:41,880
 So it will go down on the branch of a vine or whatever that's going into the water.

1073
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:42,880
 It will just hang out there.

1074
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,720
 It can stay there for about an hour.

1075
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:49,360
 And I've seen videos of, you know, little creatures coming up and launching like a spider

1076
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:51,440
 wood and bringing it back in and consuming it.

1077
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,080
 And they're close to the same size as the spider.

1078
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:59,640
 Can we talk about Helen Smith who is the heroine of this whole story of bringing the spiders

1079
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,680
 back into the North at Bronze.

1080
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:08,560
 So she hand-reared 3,000 baby Fenn raft spiders in her own kitchen.

1081
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:12,600
 And these are the first ones that they put into the water.

1082
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:17,440
 And eventually some other charities got involved and they eventually put 30,000 in.

1083
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,280
 But she definitely started it.

1084
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:24,400
 And she would line up every single one of these spiders in an individual test tube.

1085
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,120
 Because if you put two of them in a test tube, they'd just eat each other.

1086
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:29,360
 So they had to be all kept separate.

1087
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:34,600
 And then she had to personally feed them flies for a full year so that they would grow big

1088
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:35,880
 enough to let them go.

1089
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:36,880
 30,000.

1090
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:41,640
 The 3,000 she did and then eventually it was 30,000.

1091
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:45,960
 And she had to collect the flies herself, because they eat like fruit flies.

1092
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:50,680
 There's things I want to make fun of her a lot, but I'm also really scared of her.

1093
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:54,280
 I think there's a kind of, as you don't want to make an enemy of someone with access to

1094
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:57,400
 3,000 spiders and with that kind of attention to detail.

1095
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:58,720
 That's what you should have asked her.

1096
00:43:58,720 --> 00:43:59,720
 You should have asked her.

1097
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:00,720
 You scared Helen.

1098
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:04,760
 Yeah, I'm really scared of Helen from Norfolk.

1099
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:09,360
 She had to get these fruit flies and apparently the best place to get them was from compost

1100
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:12,240
 heaps or horse dung.

1101
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:17,640
 And so she said, how aroused was she?

1102
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:23,520
 She said she had spent a lot of time with a sweep net following ponies and waiting for them

1103
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:27,920
 to poo, just so that she could get the flies when they first arrived on the poo.

1104
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:28,920
 Isn't that mad?

1105
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:35,000
 The neighbors, the people who didn't know what she was doing, all of her behaviour, do you

1106
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,320
 want to come in for a cup of tea?

1107
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:38,320
 She's here.

1108
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:39,320
 What have done?

1109
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:40,320
 So cool.

1110
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:41,320
 And you now get spider tourism.

1111
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:44,680
 People visit these nature reserves because their webs are, I mean, they are massive and

1112
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:45,680
 they're webs are massive too.

1113
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,760
 The webs are apparently the size of a normal pizza.

1114
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:48,760
 Yeah.

1115
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:49,760
 Wow.

1116
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,760
 And then, obviously, when they give birth, there's thousands and thousands more.

1117
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:53,760
 Oh, yeah.

1118
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:54,760
 Yeah.

1119
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:55,760
 So little baby ones.

1120
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:56,760
 Yeah, right.

1121
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:58,480
 Pretty good mums.

1122
00:44:58,480 --> 00:44:59,480
 The female fan runs by.

1123
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:00,480
 It's not all spiders are.

1124
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:01,480
 Not all spiders are.

1125
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:08,000
 Well, female, she has an egg sack, which is just a big bag of eggs and she carries it round

1126
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
 for three weeks in this bag.

1127
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,760
 And if it gets too cold, she will lift the bag up towards the sun.

1128
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:17,840
 And if it gets too hot, she would dunk it in the water to cool it down a bit.

1129
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:21,080
 And she goes that whole time without eating because, you know, busy.

1130
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:25,320
 And then she spins this nursery web, as it's called, the size of a pizza.

1131
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:26,600
 And suspends that above water.

1132
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:31,400
 And if you go to the north and broads to see these things, you can see these disks just off

1133
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:37,120
 the path in the water, these nursery webs, full of the spiderlings.

1134
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:38,120
 But yeah, spiders.

1135
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:40,560
 Well, these ones, just one more thing about these ones.

1136
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:43,440
 They're one of only two spiders protected in UK law.

1137
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,440
 Really?

1138
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:45,440
 Yeah.

1139
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:48,040
 The Ladybird spider is the other one.

1140
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:52,120
 It's the Wildlife and Countryside Act of 1981.

1141
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:59,040
 So if you intentionally kill, injure or take a raft spider, then you guilty of an offence.

1142
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:04,200
 And if you say that you're intending to sell one as well, that's illegal.

1143
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:05,280
 On the dark web.

1144
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,280
 Oh.

1145
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:07,280
 Oh.

1146
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:08,280
 Thank you.

1147
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:09,280
 Very, very good.

1148
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:10,280
 Thank you.

1149
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:11,280
 Very, very good.

1150
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,040
 Other animals that you are not allowed to kill in the UK, the water bite, the grasshopper,

1151
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:20,080
 the trembling sea mat, the slow worm, the glutinous snail, the small blue butterfly and

1152
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:22,800
 the large blue, basically any blue butterfly.

1153
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:26,160
 That's why we can't do almost the liberty to get me out of here in this country.

1154
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:27,160
 Yeah.

1155
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:30,560
 It's the place of Australia where we can eat everything.

1156
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,600
 Did you say the glutinous sea mat?

1157
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,120
 No, I said the glutinous snail.

1158
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:36,120
 Oh, there was a sea mat in it.

1159
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:37,120
 There's trembling on something.

1160
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:38,120
 Yeah.

1161
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:39,120
 Yeah, sea mat.

1162
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:40,120
 That's an amazing, I've never heard of that.

1163
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:41,120
 No.

1164
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:46,120
 They live in the sea around the United Kingdom and they're basically algal mats, I think,

1165
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:47,120
 tremors.

1166
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:50,160
 That kind of knock off sponge bulb square pants is what I'm hearing.

1167
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,160
 Yeah.

1168
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:52,160
 I'll give you that.

1169
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,160
 Are they just terrified the whole time?

1170
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:55,160
 They shouldn't be because they're protected.

1171
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:56,160
 Yeah.

1172
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,160
 You know, it's rising sea levels, global warming.

1173
00:46:58,160 --> 00:46:59,160
 Yeah.

1174
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:01,160
 Are there the only people that are worried?

1175
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:07,240
 I think the scared of adding these buttons, just to bring that back.

1176
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:10,760
 You know that spiders can inventimate you after they've been squished.

1177
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:11,760
 What?

1178
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:16,760
 So, this was a story from this year in California, there was a 37-year-old woman who went

1179
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:22,840
 to the emergency room because her eye was all swollen and goopy and felt like it was burning.

1180
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:27,000
 And apparently 20 minutes earlier, her husband had killed a Western and Black Widow spider

1181
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
 with a hammer.

1182
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:33,480
 It splattered in all directions and some of it went in her eye and she got invented.

1183
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:34,480
 Oh my God.

1184
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:37,480
 How closely was she looking at the spider?

1185
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:39,800
 Before we hammered it, there's so much of that story that's horrible.

1186
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:40,800
 Yeah, yes.

1187
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,320
 The hammered a spider to death.

1188
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:43,320
 It's an awful story.

1189
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:45,680
 I think what I'm saying is don't squish spiders.

1190
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:46,680
 No.

1191
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:47,680
 There's no need to.

1192
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:48,680
 No, there are friends.

1193
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:49,680
 Yeah.

1194
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,920
 Well, Black Widow spiders are not our friends.

1195
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:52,920
 I don't know.

1196
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:55,200
 But they're still important to the ecosystem.

1197
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:56,200
 Absolutely.

1198
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:57,200
 Yeah.

1199
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,200
 So am I.

1200
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:59,200
 Yeah.

1201
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:00,200
 That's a human being.

1202
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:01,200
 There's too many of us.

1203
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:02,200
 Yeah.

1204
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:05,040
 Not you personally, but in terms of the ecosystem.

1205
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,040
 No, no, that's fine.

1206
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:09,560
 But if we're going to start with anyone, Andy, we might as well, you know.

1207
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:11,840
 I feel like I have a good run.

1208
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:16,920
 I always say to my daughter, whenever the spider, I'm like spiders are our friends and they're

1209
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:17,920
 really important.

1210
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:21,840
 And I am actually terrified of spiders, so I don't really believe it when I say it.

1211
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:23,920
 I mean, I do believe it, but I'm like hiding my fear.

1212
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:26,400
 You have to show that you're not afraid of this trick.

1213
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:30,720
 Do you find that it helps you that it's helping your response to spiders that you now

1214
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:31,720
 can't?

1215
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:32,720
 Maybe.

1216
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:33,720
 I suppose so.

1217
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:35,920
 I can't show fear in front of my daughter.

1218
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:36,920
 Yeah.

1219
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:37,920
 It's a reinforced fear.

1220
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:38,920
 Yeah.

1221
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:41,640
 So actually, I think it's really good for lots of, you know, lots of people to walk when

1222
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:45,360
 they have children to then temper it, and then you go, actually, I am less panicky about

1223
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:46,360
 it.

1224
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:49,600
 And if you have to be the person that puts it safely outside, do you realize my wife does

1225
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:50,600
 that?

1226
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:51,600
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1227
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:56,480
 But that's only because you're trying to arouse her.

1228
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:57,480
 Did you do down the drain?

1229
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:00,720
 Did you get the photo I sent you recently, not long ago, for Big Spider and a little while

1230
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:01,720
 we didn't reply to?

1231
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:02,720
 Was it, well, was it mum?

1232
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:03,720
 It was a big spider.

1233
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:04,720
 On email.

1234
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:05,720
 No, it was WhatsApp.

1235
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:06,720
 Oh, yeah.

1236
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:07,720
 I don't recall.

1237
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:08,720
 How big was it?

1238
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:09,720
 It was big.

1239
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:10,720
 It was a house spider.

1240
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:12,360
 But it was a big one.

1241
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:13,360
 It was in my house.

1242
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:14,360
 It was not only in my house, Sarah.

1243
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:17,640
 It fell onto my naked shoulder as I sat in bed.

1244
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:22,800
 Andy, I've got an experience very, very, very similar where I was once cancelling a dentist

1245
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:26,040
 appointment, and I could feel a little thing of hair in my face like this.

1246
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:27,040
 Oh, no.

1247
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:29,560
 I was just brushing this hair off, because I was interested in what you were saying about

1248
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:30,560
 the hair balancing on the water.

1249
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:32,200
 I was just brushing this hair off my face.

1250
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:36,300
 So first in the morning, and then I pushed, and then I heard it hit the floor, and it

1251
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:37,300
 was so massive.

1252
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:41,400
 And there's a mirror there, and I think, if I'd actually seen it on my face, I would have

1253
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:42,400
 died.

1254
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:46,940
 If I'd actually seen it on my face, I'd just felt it there.

1255
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:50,620
 So having just got out of it, they do come on us in the night.

1256
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:51,620
 They do come on us in the night.

1257
00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:53,820
 And I did see the photo now that you say it, Andy.

1258
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:54,820
 I do remember.

1259
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:55,820
 It was bad.

1260
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:56,820
 It was bad.

1261
00:49:56,820 --> 00:49:57,820
 A glass couldn't fit over it.

1262
00:49:57,820 --> 00:49:58,820
 Well, yeah.

1263
00:49:58,820 --> 00:49:59,820
 I have very narrow necked glasses.

1264
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:00,820
 But still.

1265
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:01,820
 You should have only drank champagne.

1266
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:03,820
 I should have started with the flute.

1267
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:04,820
 I should have gone with the marion.

1268
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:05,820
 But that was my fault.

1269
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:11,740
 And it was just from a clear blue sky, from a ceiling, basically, from a ceiling.

1270
00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:12,740
 What the heck?

1271
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:13,740
 Yeah.

1272
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:14,740
 I find it.

1273
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:18,140
 So as someone who spent my teenage years in Australia, I don't.

1274
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:21,060
 They're friendly here, comparative to Australia, where they kill you.

1275
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:23,780
 So it's, I don't find them in any way scary here.

1276
00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:24,780
 There's a few.

1277
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:25,780
 There was a great incident I read about.

1278
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:27,060
 We're a guy called Matthew Stevens.

1279
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:28,780
 He was a chef.

1280
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:32,780
 And he was cleaning behind a freezer at the Quantac Gateway pub in Bridgewater when

1281
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:37,860
 suddenly he would, yeah, we've all been there.

1282
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:42,220
 And he was, he was bitten twice on his hand by what turned out to be a Brazilian wandering

1283
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:43,380
 spider.

1284
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:44,860
 And that is very dangerous.

1285
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:45,860
 Yes.

1286
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:47,580
 They come in like bananas, don't they?

1287
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:49,060
 And this is where this came from.

1288
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:52,660
 It traveled in the bananas overseas, made it to him.

1289
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:56,580
 And this is, this is how intense the spider, this kind of spider is.

1290
00:50:56,580 --> 00:51:02,020
 Once he knocked it off of him, he knocked it into an open freezer, and then he drenched

1291
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:03,860
 it in boiling water.

1292
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:05,100
 And it still was just fine.

1293
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:06,980
 Well, that's because you've got hot and cold.

1294
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:08,380
 It was just a very pleasant temperature.

1295
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:09,380
 Oh, you're right.

1296
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:12,260
 This is on a spa, it's like a lukewarm bar.

1297
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:13,260
 Yes.

1298
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:18,260
 The spider's thinking, oh, I will review the Quantac's well.

1299
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:19,260
 Yeah.

1300
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:23,500
 And so they collected the spider in the jar and they brought it to where he was at the

1301
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:24,500
 hospital.

1302
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:25,500
 Someone in the hospital.

1303
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:26,500
 Why did they do that?

1304
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:27,500
 I guess if you want to start.

1305
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:28,500
 Yeah.

1306
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:30,780
 You meant to show what bit you, because you're like, we need the anti-vener.

1307
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:31,780
 Sorry.

1308
00:51:31,780 --> 00:51:34,900
 I was recovering in hospital and they found it and brought it in here like a year ago.

1309
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:35,900
 You were there.

1310
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:36,900
 You were there.

1311
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:41,180
 The worst is when I was attacked by a bear, and I had to bring the bear into the hospital.

1312
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:43,100
 So this is why I was attacked by a bear.

1313
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:46,340
 Yeah, but so they brought it in and it was in a jar, and then someone who worked in the

1314
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:49,580
 hospital saw it and thought, oh, I should put this back out and let it back loose.

1315
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:50,580
 Oh.

1316
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:51,580
 Oh, it's in the wild.

1317
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:52,580
 Yeah.

1318
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:53,980
 And they said we probably shouldn't worry, because it was probably going to die a couple

1319
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:54,980
 of days after.

1320
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:56,580
 I think it wouldn't like it in which water.

1321
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:57,580
 Yeah.

1322
00:51:57,580 --> 00:51:58,580
 Exactly.

1323
00:51:58,580 --> 00:51:59,580
 It's the temperatures.

1324
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:00,580
 Yeah.

1325
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:01,580
 Yeah.

1326
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:07,740
 Drief, should we have a positive spide effect, as opposed to all this scary stuff?

1327
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:11,820
 Some people think, I want to say people, I mean, scientists, consider that a spide is web

1328
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:13,660
 should be considered part of its mind.

1329
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:14,660
 Right.

1330
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:15,660
 Okay.

1331
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:16,660
 This is where it is, isn't it?

1332
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:20,220
 So it's an externalisation of, not of consciousness, but of thought.

1333
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:21,220
 Is that why?

1334
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:22,220
 Yeah.

1335
00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:25,700
 Because I guess the web, if it's as far away from it feels the movement, therefore your

1336
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:26,940
 brain is registering.

1337
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:27,940
 Exactly.

1338
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:28,940
 Right.

1339
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:29,940
 And they have foresight.

1340
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:33,860
 They change their web structure based on how much they have left in their silk glands.

1341
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:36,820
 So if they're running a bit low, they'll make a simpler web.

1342
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:39,740
 So it's kind of an external brain in lots of ways.

1343
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:44,300
 So it would be like antennae going off what Dan said in terms of, or, you know, like, animals

1344
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:48,060
 where they can feel whether they're going to a space that's too small, that there's an externalisation

1345
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:49,060
 of sense, isn't it?

1346
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:50,060
 Right, whiskers.

1347
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:51,060
 Yeah, whiskers.

1348
00:52:51,060 --> 00:52:52,060
 Yeah.

1349
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:55,420
 Although they'll do market research on what's hitting their web and sticking.

1350
00:52:55,420 --> 00:52:59,900
 So if prey is hitting it and bouncing off, they'll rejig the web so it's got more sticky

1351
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:01,700
 pads on it to catch more.

1352
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:05,100
 Or if the local prey is a different size to what they're expecting, they'll change the

1353
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:06,100
 web based on that.

1354
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:07,100
 It's so cool.

1355
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:08,780
 It's really good, isn't it?

1356
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:09,780
 They are good.

1357
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:10,780
 Yeah.

1358
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:11,780
 That's right.

1359
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:16,740
 The male Asian hermit spiders become better at fighting if you cut their penises off.

1360
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:17,740
 Yeah.

1361
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:20,340
 Like what they're getting in the way, or what is it that's?

1362
00:53:20,340 --> 00:53:21,340
 No.

1363
00:53:21,340 --> 00:53:25,500
 So what, they're one of these spiders where after they've had sex, they usually remove

1364
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:28,980
 their penises and keep it inside the female's reproductive tract.

1365
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:29,980
 Oh, yeah.

1366
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:30,980
 No other male can.

1367
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:31,980
 Yeah.

1368
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:32,980
 Yeah, there's a plug.

1369
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:33,980
 Oh.

1370
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:34,980
 But they also get...

1371
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:35,980
 It's really common.

1372
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:36,980
 It's really common.

1373
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:38,980
 In nature, yes, because it's one of the best ways of sperm competition.

1374
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:39,980
 Yeah.

1375
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:44,900
 But the other thing they do to make sure that their sperm is successful is they become very,

1376
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:48,620
 very aggressive and they start fighting off any other spiders who come and try and make

1377
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:49,620
 with the female.

1378
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:54,300
 And so that means if you just cut the penis off, then they still get all these hormones

1379
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:57,380
 or whatever they are to make them really aggressive and they'll just get really, really

1380
00:53:57,380 --> 00:53:58,380
 fighting.

1381
00:53:58,380 --> 00:53:59,380
 So what are you proposing?

1382
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:02,380
 Just go proposal here.

1383
00:54:02,380 --> 00:54:05,380
 We have a lot of modifications to the British army.

1384
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:16,780
 Okay, that's it, that is all of our facts.

1385
00:54:16,780 --> 00:54:18,180
 Thank you so much for listening.

1386
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:21,180
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us about the things that we've said over

1387
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:24,180
 the course of this podcast, we can all be found online.

1388
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:26,380
 I'm on @tribaland on Instagram.

1389
00:54:26,380 --> 00:54:27,380
 James.

1390
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:29,380
 There's no such thing as James Harkin.

1391
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:30,380
 Andy?

1392
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:31,380
 Mine is Andrew Hunter M and Sarah.

1393
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:33,380
 Sarah Pasco on Instagram.

1394
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:34,380
 Yeah.

1395
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:35,380
 And you're on tour now, yeah?

1396
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:36,380
 Yes, yeah.

1397
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:37,380
 I'm on tour until March 2026.

1398
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:41,380
 So if anyone like to come, I'm going to put in some facts about spiders.

1399
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:45,380
 And Helen, you've got a free ticket if you want to go.

1400
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:49,860
 Yeah, or you can get to us as a group by emailing us on podcast@qy.com.

1401
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:52,700
 All of those emails make their way over to Andy.

1402
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:57,860
 Andy often picks out some of them to include in our bonus show that we do called Drop Us

1403
00:54:57,860 --> 00:54:58,860
 Align.

1404
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:00,380
 And that's part of a thing called Club Fish.

1405
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:04,300
 It's a very exciting private members club that we've set up that has all sorts of bonus

1406
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:06,020
 material that you can get access to.

1407
00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:08,740
 So check that out and you can check that out by going to our website.

1408
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:10,340
 No such thing as a fish.com.

1409
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:11,700
 There's also merch up there.

1410
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:14,940
 Otherwise just come back here next week because we will be back with another episode and

1411
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:15,940
 we'll see you then.

1412
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:16,940
 Goodbye.

1413
00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:26,940
