00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.760
 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, where we were

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:09.480
 joined by the wonderful Sarah Pasco.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.920
 Now there is no one I don't think in Britain who doesn't know who Sarah Pasco is and probably

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.360
 if you listen to this show around the world you'll know her as well because she has been

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:22.560
 on fish before, but just as a quick reminder she is an incredible stand up comedian and

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.520
 TV presenter who is a good friend of ours, she does a podcast as well, she does a show

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:34.560
 called Weirdo's Book Club with fellow fish alumnus Carrie Adloid, but she is on all the

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.880
 panel shows she's been on QI a million times, she's absolutely brilliant, we love having

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:44.240
 her on all of our shows, but one important thing to say about Sarah is that she is currently

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:49.640
 on tour, if you would like to see her show and you live somewhere in the UK there is

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.560
 an extremely good chance that she will be coming to your town in November or in the spring

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.900
 next year, and to find out the shortest amount of travel you will have to make to get to

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:09.240
 her shows, you must go to Sarah Pasco.co.uk/tickets her website is S-A-R-A-P-A-S-C-O-E.co.uk because

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.000
 that is how you spell her name.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.920
 So go to Sarah Pasco.co.uk to get tickets for her show, but in the meantime please enjoy

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:33.000
 our show, on with a podcast.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.520
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.960
 to you from the QI offices in Hobern.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.760
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray, and

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.000
 Sarah Pasco, and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favourite

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.020
 facts from the last seven days, and in a particular order here we go.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.280
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Sarah.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:03.840
 My fact, and I'm underlying the word fact there, the reasons that will become clear, my fact

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.360
 is Saturn's wings are younger than sharks.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:18.200
 So when you say fact, and you underline it, weirdly we've never had a guest underline the headline

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.760
 fact before, and it makes me instantly suspicious.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:28.360
 Yes, well H is butter concept, and when I looked into the inverted commas proof of both

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.440
 of the ages, Saturn and sharks I felt like well there's lots to debate here.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.240
 Okay, so do you stand by it or not, like if you had to bet your life on it.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.680
 I would have to do more research probably, so let me tell you where the whole ageing of

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.080
 Saturn's wings comes from.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.880
 So there's a Cassini spacecraft, combination of NASA, the European Space Agency, and also

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.240
 the Italian Space Agency, which means they're not in the European Space Agency, and I thought

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.280
 there's a sitcom.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:02.040
 It's an easily deciding note, whatever our own one, our spaceship will be the shape of

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:08.880
 the Italian astronauts, stereotypical Italians, so you think they're low and low style.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.160
 Yeah, and all of the other space men are eating the tubes of paste food, and they've still got

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.160
 spaghetti Pomodoro, and it's creating a big mess in the spaceship.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:24.160
 All the Italian astronauts typically like to stay in the mothership, and his mind about

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.520
 Marianna Ouigi, they're fixing the spaceship.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:37.160
 So there's a Cassini spacecraft, did analysis for a really long time of what the wings were

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:42.920
 composed of, the mostly ice, and the ice is made of water, which then of course I had a question

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.040
 mark, what is other ice made of, they kept calling it water ice, but then I realized I've

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.360
 gone too far off the fact.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.360
 Okay.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.360
 Come back.

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:55.680
 One percent of them is dust, and they've measured the rate of accumulation, how dusty

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.800
 they're getting, and then worked backwards from that one percent to say they can't be any

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:05.120
 older than a hundred years, a hundred million years I should say, and they could be as new

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.920
 as ten million years old.

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:07.920
 Wow.

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:08.920
 Okay.

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.400
 So that's from the amount of dust accumulation.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.040
 The reason, and I'll stress this straight away, that they could be a lot older, is because

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.960
 they could be cleaning themselves, because there's a pool from the planet, which takes a lot

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:22.360
 of debris away from it.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:29.520
 So basically, when Micrometeroids hit the rings of Saturn, they are either vaporised or they've

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.880
 pulled towards Saturn's magnetic field, which would explain why there would be less dust

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.720
 there than you could completely just age it.

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.760
 All the dust that's ever been collected by Saturn's pool hasn't stayed in the rings essentially,

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.840
 which is where aging them that way could be slightly contentious.

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:45.840
 Okay.

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:46.840
 And what about sharks?

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.200
 Okay, so sharks, they're saying they're claiming.

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.520
 I don't know what you've written down, that they are four hundred and fifty million years

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:55.520
 old.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:56.520
 Yes, okay.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.520
 Right, okay.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:03.400
 And their evidence for this, some scales, no teeth, they've got some fossilised scales from

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.480
 four hundred and fifty million years old, which they're saying is that earliest fossil

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:11.640
 of a shark, like creature, which is not a shark, is it?

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.880
 That's a shark, like creature.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:14.880
 Okay.

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:15.880
 And then no teeth.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:22.400
 So, are we thinking a gummy shark, like no teeth shark?

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.640
 What a scary, big, scary fish, I know which one is what a shark is in lots of ways.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:29.040
 But hang on Sarah, all of this, all of this smacks of a woman who submitted the fact and

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:30.040
 then researched it.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.040
 Yes.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.040
 Yes.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.040
 You're on that?

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.040
 Okay.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.040
 What's the accusation there, Andy?

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:39.560
 That's what she did what we asked her to do.

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.560
 No, because some people, it's like their actual passion, is that what you mean?

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:43.560
 No, no, no.

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.440
 People are like, "Oh, I wrote a book about that, that's really something."

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.040
 It's funny how honest you are, but it is like it, because you know, like a lesser research

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:53.200
 I might have just said, "Yeah, I'll just sort of find that."

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.200
 I would have done that.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.200
 Yeah, I would have done that.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.200
 And they would have done that.

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.880
 And it said, "So, the fact is that the rings are this old and sharks are this old."

00:05:58.880 --> 00:05:59.880
 Yes.

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:00.880
 And one's younger than the other, and that's it.

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:06.040
 No, actually, what I did write down was that Cassini spacecraft, born on the 15th

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.840
 of October 1997, so it's a Libra.

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:08.840
 Oh, you love it.

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:09.840
 Yeah, that is good.

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:14.360
 Getting my astrology and astronomy all in the same way, all in the same explanation.

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:20.960
 So sharks have survived the five, yeah, the five known mass extinctions that we've had

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:21.960
 on this planet.

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:22.960
 Are they involved somehow?

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.160
 It does seem suspicious.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.160
 Yeah.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:27.160
 Always there.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:28.160
 Yeah.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.760
 I think it was after the first mass extinction that teeth suddenly became a part of their

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:32.760
 life.

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:33.760
 Yeah.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.360
 Although the jaws were different in those earlier creatures.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:37.360
 Yeah.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:41.200
 So now they have jaws that open really widely, which mean they can swim faster and they

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.200
 can eat prey bigger than themselves.

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.200
 So that's exciting.

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:45.880
 But that's much more recent.

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:51.760
 We're talking 150 million years ago with those recognizable actual sharks.

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:56.760
 And like 10 million to 100 million with the rings of Saturn, what are you saying as the

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:59.160
 closest scale than 400 plus male-scale scales?

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.800
 Okay, so here's the timeline I wrote down.

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:08.120
 So I wrote sharks as the earliest fossil was the late Ordova vision period.

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:11.040
 So basically that would make them older than dinosaurs and older and trees.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.040
 Really fun.

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:14.840
 Trees are 360 million years old, which is fun.

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:17.920
 Would they know anything about trees as in like they're not seeing trees anyway, right?

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:18.920
 Absolutely not.

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:19.920
 So that's relevant to their world.

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:20.920
 Oh, damn.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:21.920
 You get like tree falling in there.

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:22.920
 Absolutely.

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:23.920
 So they might see a fall in there.

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:24.920
 So they'll be like that.

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:25.920
 They'll see a log.

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:26.920
 But they can't fall before they exist.

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:27.920
 That's the thing.

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:32.040
 If a tree falls before it exists, does it make a nose?

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:33.040
 Does it splash?

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:34.040
 It was.

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:35.600
 They famously got good hearing sharks.

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.880
 So that would be good distances.

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:38.880
 Or is it smell?

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:39.880
 A smell?

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:40.880
 Can they smell trees?

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:41.880
 There's a few people say, shh.

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:42.880
 And I can't see them.

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:43.880
 I can't see it.

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:44.880
 I can't see it.

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:45.880
 Don't bleed into the water.

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:50.960
 So we've got a mass extinction event in the Permian period.

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:57.000
 That's 252 million years ago or around then that 96% of marine life was wiped out.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.400
 So we had bigger sharks and there is fossil records just teeth of these massive sharks.

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:02.400
 Are you saying just teeth?

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:04.160
 Earlier on it was like, oh, they don't even have teeth.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.160
 Exactly.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:06.160
 How suspicious is this?

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:11.280
 You always find crimes and then investigate them on this show.

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:13.440
 Do you know why they keep surviving all of these mass extinctions?

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:18.920
 It's really interesting because they're so varied as a class of creatures.

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:21.680
 So you get sharks that live on the bottom.

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:24.720
 You get sharks that live in the main water column in a higher over the ocean.

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:25.720
 You get small sharks.

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:26.720
 You get big sharks.

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:30.080
 You get sharks that are some sharks that are even mostly vegetarian.

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:32.920
 You get just sharks of every different kind.

00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:36.600
 That's why always a few of them will fit through the keyhole of whatever life survives

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:37.600
 the mass extinction event.

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:38.600
 Which is amazing isn't it?

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:39.600
 It did go down.

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:44.960
 One of my tendons was the green and shark, which grows incredibly slowly, which is a really

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.680
 good example of what you're describing.

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:49.400
 They don't become sexually active until they're over a hundred.

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:50.400
 Yeah.

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:51.400
 Which is really inspiring.

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:55.240
 Here's an amazing thing about them.

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:59.200
 It's been estimated that they can live probably up to 500 years.

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:03.000
 There's one that's been found that definitely is around 400 years old.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.200
 Now the rings of Saturn, the first observation through telescope was Galileo on 1610.

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:13.560
 Arguably there is a green and shark out there alive that was born before Galileo first looked

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:14.560
 at them through a telescope.

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:20.360
 I thought you were going to say that could have seen the rings of Saturn through that telescope

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:21.880
 unless it fell into the water.

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:22.880
 Unless they could hear it.

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:25.880
 I think that's going to happen under you.

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:26.880
 It's amazing isn't it?

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:27.880
 That's mad potentially.

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:28.880
 There's one out there that was yeah.

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:29.880
 Yeah.

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:30.880
 We've got the topic.

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:31.880
 Sharks.

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:32.880
 Yeah.

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:33.880
 Yeah.

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:34.880
 Give us a shark.

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:35.880
 That's favorite shark.

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:36.880
 I'll tell you mine.

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:37.880
 Yeah okay.

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:38.880
 Wow.

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:39.880
 Let's guess.

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:40.880
 I'm going to guess Hammerhead.

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:41.880
 No.

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:42.880
 James.

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:43.880
 Hammerhead.

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:44.880
 No.

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:45.880
 I do like Hammerheads.

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:46.880
 They're the youngest species.

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:47.880
 Apparently the newest one.

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:48.880
 Hello.

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:49.880
 Really?

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:50.880
 Well, I've had another one that's been quite new.

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:54.880
 I think it's maybe not quite as new as Hammerheads, but the walking sharks that you get off the

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:56.880
 coast of Australia.

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:57.880
 They live on the bottom.

00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.880
 They're one of Andy's bottom sharks.

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:01.880
 Yeah.

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:03.880
 But they walk on the bottom sharks.

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:10.880
 It's my channel five series of the future.

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:13.880
 People who want to watch a show about animals are going to be very disciplined.

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:19.880
 It's very much an urban dictionary thing.

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:20.880
 No, these are like walking sharks.

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:21.880
 Yeah.

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:24.880
 And they use their fins and they walk like geckos on the bottom of the ocean.

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:25.880
 Wow.

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:26.880
 That is cool.

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:27.880
 Can they swim?

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:29.880
 They can swim, yeah, but not very well.

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:30.880
 Quite like the Thresher shark.

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:31.880
 Oh yeah.

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:36.880
 But it's just, it's an odd move that they use, which is, it's been described as extreme yoga.

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:41.160
 Basically, if they're coming up to a fish, rather than directly eat it, they'll bring their

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:43.880
 tail up back around them and slap it and stun it.

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:44.880
 Wow.

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:45.880
 Yeah.

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:46.880
 That's great.

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:50.800
 Usually a lot of them, they'll eat by opening their mouths and just swimming with their mouths

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:52.880
 open and seeing what goes in there, right?

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:53.880
 Yeah.

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:54.880
 And there's a big problem with that.

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:59.080
 A paper I read just this morning, which was that basically because of the water is more acidic

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:01.880
 and the oceans now, it's rotting their teeth.

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:02.880
 Oh.

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:06.880
 And so they have quite crumbly teeth now, sharks, compared to what they were 100 years ago.

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:07.880
 Wow.

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:09.880
 So, later people think we didn't have any sharks.

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:10.880
 There's no evidence.

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:11.880
 Yes.

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:12.880
 Yeah.

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:13.880
 They all crumbled away.

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:14.880
 Yeah.

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:15.880
 Can I give you guys my favourite shark?

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:16.880
 Yeah.

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:17.880
 It's from this morning.

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:18.880
 For the programme.

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:22.880
 For lip skull fields, it was a shark.

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:30.200
 No, this is a listener email from Alison Mullencamp, who sent us an email this morning on

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:31.200
 the day we recalled this.

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.200
 Oh yeah.

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:33.880
 Headlined "Ghost Shark Sex Teeth."

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:34.880
 Okay.

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:35.880
 This is crazy.

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:36.880
 And you opened it?

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:37.880
 Oh yeah.

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:38.880
 It's gonna be great for us.

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:39.880
 And it's awesome sharks.

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:43.360
 Basically, there's a thing called a ghost shark.

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:45.920
 It's also known as a spotted ratfish.

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:47.920
 I suspect it prefers to go by ghost shark.

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:48.920
 I'll take the other name back.

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:49.920
 Yeah.

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:50.920
 It was just so fast.

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:51.920
 Yeah.

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:54.920
 I'm trying to push a cool nickname on themselves.

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:55.920
 A spotted rat?

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:56.920
 No, it's ghost shark actually.

00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:57.920
 Yeah.

00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:00.440
 That's what they call me at university.

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:03.440
 So it's not a true shark, but it looks a lot like a shark, you know, and it gets called

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:04.440
 it.

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:06.240
 And it's got a thing on its forehead called the tenaculum.

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:11.480
 It's got these tiny protrusions on it, and scientists have just today published a paper

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:16.680
 about what this thing is and what it is is this little thing sticking out of its head has

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:17.680
 these scales on it.

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:18.680
 It turns out they're not scales.

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:19.680
 They're actual teeth.

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:25.000
 They're literal teeth sticking out of its head, which it uses to grip onto the female during

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.000
 sex.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.000
 Okay.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.000
 It's got a head hand.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
 It's got a head hand, which it uses for sex grips.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.000
 And it's just a whole lot of fish.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.280
 Does the female have one on her head to hit the other?

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:35.280
 No, I don't think so.

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:36.280
 Guys, well, away.

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:37.280
 She has nothing.

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:38.280
 Just a ponytail.

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:39.280
 I think she's one.

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:41.280
 Yeah.

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:45.440
 And so one of the scientists responsible, Carly Cohen said, "This feature flips the long-standing

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:49.640
 assumption in evolutionary biology that teeth are strictly oral structures."

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:50.640
 And they...

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:52.960
 I thought that their skin was teeth as well, though.

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:53.960
 I thought that definitely...

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:54.960
 I think it's shaped like teeth.

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:59.280
 But I think that teeth evolved from the skin, so it was scales around them, I've got

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:00.280
 harder and harder.

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:01.920
 Which seems to be the same as this other idea.

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:02.920
 It's just utilising.

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:04.920
 Oh, they're also good for this.

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:09.160
 Imagine Sabrina Carpenter's album cover, because it was really sort of anti-it, and

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:10.960
 it's been done before we've moved positive.

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:12.960
 Imagine if it had been this ghost shot.

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:15.480
 She's sort of on her knees with...

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:16.480
 Yeah.

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:18.440
 But she's sort of being held by, you know, looking up at her...

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:19.440
 But I think next album.

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:20.440
 Yeah, next one.

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:21.440
 That's true, actually.

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:22.440
 Or maybe Chapel Roan.

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:26.200
 I'm sort of imagining your TV program.

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:29.880
 I've imagined lots of the dancers at the beginning, because it's got this like Euro-Trash

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:30.880
 feel.

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:34.280
 And they've all got like big, big, sharp heads, and then they're all wearing chaps.

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:37.800
 So when they turn around, they turn around and you can see their bottoms.

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:40.760
 Do you remember that Super Bowl when they had the Dancing Shark?

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:41.760
 Yes.

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:42.760
 Like that, but a bit sexier.

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:43.760
 Yeah.

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:44.760
 Okay.

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:45.760
 Chat that with Chapsong.

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:46.760
 Yeah.

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:47.760
 And is it just me enjoying these dances?

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:51.400
 I mean, you just speak to camera at the beginning like, "Hi, I'm Andy, and here every

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:53.400
 week is sharp quick."

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:57.600
 And then it's just like a fancy castle and stuff like that.

00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:58.600
 I'll do it.

00:13:58.600 --> 00:13:59.600
 Yeah.

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:00.600
 I will take that job.

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:01.600
 Okay.

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:09.320
 It is time for fact number two, and that is my fact.

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:13.440
 My fact this week is that because he didn't like the name of the novel that he was adapting

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:18.760
 into a movie, director Ridley Scott bought the film rights to a William Burrers novel called

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:22.320
 Blade Runner, just so he could steal that title instead.

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:23.320
 Nice.

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:24.320
 Brilliant.

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:25.320
 Yeah.

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:26.320
 Really good.

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:27.320
 Yeah.

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:28.320
 It's quite fascinating.

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:30.720
 So I've just read Do Android's Dream of Electric Sheep, which is a book by Philip K.

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:31.720
 It's a great title.

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:32.720
 It's a great title.

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:33.720
 It's a great title.

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:34.720
 It's a solid one.

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:35.720
 That's right.

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:38.760
 It's a commercial title for a movie.

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:42.320
 If you don't know Philip K. Dick, he was a pretty extraordinary sci-fi writer.

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:47.160
 He was writing in the '50s and '60s, and he has had so many of his books that have gone

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:48.160
 to the big screen.

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:51.920
 So you might have seen Total Recall with Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Adjustment Bureau

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:55.760
 Minority Reporter Scanner, Darkly, and Blade Runner, probably the most famous of all

00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:58.200
 of those, starring Harris and Ford.

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:04.040
 And so initially Ridley Scott was brought on to this project, and there was a screenwriter

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:08.920
 on it called Hampton Fancher, and Hampton Fancher decided that while he was writing it, he

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:13.720
 would put in the draft the name Blade Runner, which he'd seen from another book.

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:14.720
 And it was just there.

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:19.400
 And Ridley Scott, who took on the project, started reading Do Android's Dream of Electric Sheep,

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:20.400
 but didn't like it.

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:21.400
 So put it down.

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:24.520
 So he didn't end up even reading the book he made into a movie.

00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:28.080
 He saw that title on the screenplay and said, "This is way better.

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:29.080
 Let's use that."

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:31.120
 But obviously it was connected to another book.

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:34.720
 So he literally bought the movie rights to that and used nothing but the title.

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:35.720
 So can I ask a question?

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:36.720
 Yeah.

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:37.720
 You said it was by William Burroughs.

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:38.720
 Mm-hmm.

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:39.720
 VG.

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:40.720
 Yeah.

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:41.960
 But he didn't write the original.

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:42.960
 So what's going on there?

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:43.960
 So, okay.

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:44.960
 So this is so weird.

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:45.960
 Yeah.

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:46.960
 It just gets so complicated.

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:50.800
 The story, the book that William Burroughs had written was called Blade Runner, the

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:51.800
 movie.

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:56.920
 So William Burroughs had read a different book by a guy called Alan E. Norse and that was

00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:59.080
 called The Blade Runner.

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:04.840
 And so Burroughs' book was a treatment for a movie that he wanted to have made.

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:08.760
 But was his book based on Norse's book or is there a difference?

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:09.760
 Yeah, it was.

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:10.760
 It was.

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:11.760
 It was basically a movie treatment.

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:16.280
 So Norse's book was, the reason it's called Blade Runner is because it's about a guy

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:18.840
 who takes medical supplies across America.

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:21.960
 So literally, scalpals and smuggling them.

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:26.040
 Yeah, because it's basically an anti-NHS book, isn't it?

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:30.480
 Basically in America, if you've got money, you can't pay for your own healthcare.

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:34.480
 You have to only go for the government thing and the government thing isn't very good.

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:39.760
 And so you have these sort of dodgy private doctors who will do your stuff for you, but they

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:40.760
 need the scalpals.

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:42.680
 So they need the Blade Runner.

00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:45.840
 And the main protagonist in that book is called Billy Gimp.

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:49.720
 It's just a good character name.

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:50.720
 It's a great name.

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:51.720
 It's hard to think of names for the characters, isn't it?

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:52.720
 Absolutely.

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:53.720
 You've got to say what you see.

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:54.720
 Look around you.

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:55.720
 Whatever you see first.

00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:58.560
 So the thing we've all glossed over, there have been a lot of names flying about.

00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:02.880
 Hampton, Fancher, Ridley Scott, none of them very likely, right?

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:08.200
 The original book that used the title Blade Runner was by this guy, Alan Norse, I pronounce

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:11.080
 it Nurse, and he was a trained doctor.

00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:12.880
 Oh, lovely.

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:15.520
 And do you remember there was a scientist about 20 years ago?

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:16.960
 He won the Nobel Prize for Medicine.

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:17.960
 Paul Nurse.

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:18.960
 Paul Nurse.

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:19.960
 Paul Nurse.

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:20.960
 What's all these doctors called Nurse?

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:23.560
 I have tried to find a nurse whose name was Doctor, but I haven't succeeded yet.

00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:25.720
 But I'll keep looking.

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:27.800
 He wrote to the name Doctor Rex, didn't he?

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:28.800
 I did, he.

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:29.800
 Yeah, yeah.

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:32.480
 He didn't really use his name because he didn't want people to know he was writing.

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:33.480
 Taffer.

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:34.480
 Yeah.

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:39.160
 Doctor Rex, but he mostly wrote abusive 140 character messages.

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:42.520
 So Blade Runner, I actually bought it the other night to watch.

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:43.520
 We'll film.

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:45.360
 Yeah, because I haven't seen it in years.

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:48.240
 So this is the other fascinating thing about the movie Blade Runner.

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:52.200
 There's been, since its release, seven different versions of it that have come out.

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:57.160
 It's constantly being revised by the director and by the production companies, so there was

00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:00.880
 a director's cut that came out, which actually wasn't a director's cut because someone else

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:01.880
 put it together.

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:05.920
 Ridley Scott just gave an approval, but the official one, according to Ridley Scott, is

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:07.920
 the final cut, which doesn't have the narration.

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:08.920
 The 25th year anniversary one.

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:13.080
 It's the only one that he was allowed to do the cut that he actually wanted.

00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:17.400
 And also, the story of it's quite interesting in that, so it was made by about 30 million

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:18.400
 dollars.

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:21.280
 And it made about 40 million dollars at the cinema, so it did fine.

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:22.600
 It didn't do that well.

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:24.800
 But when they re-edited it, it was amazing.

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:26.680
 And it was the first thing they brought out on DVD.

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:27.680
 I was there.

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:30.960
 And then it did so much better with a sort of slight re-editing.

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:31.960
 Ah, it was me.

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:35.520
 Yes, it wasn't popular at first, and it got some really bad reviews.

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:39.400
 One of the reviews said Blade Runner is a suspenseless thriller, which I think is

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:40.400
 to a certain extent true.

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:41.400
 It was sort of slow.

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:43.080
 Was it intentionally slow?

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:44.080
 It is quite slow.

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:47.960
 For anyone who hasn't seen it, it's about Harrison Ford who has to chase down a load of robots

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:49.880
 who are running around dressed up as humans.

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:50.880
 And he's a clear name.

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:54.480
 The main point of it, and the main point of Dick I think, and I haven't read that or seen

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:55.480
 the movie.

00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:59.760
 I think it's like, can an android tell if they're human, and if so, how do you tell it?

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:05.440
 Well, this is the Boyd Kempft test, which I've got the questions of if you want me to

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:06.440
 test your robots.

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:07.440
 Have you?

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:08.440
 I was like a personality test to see if we're robots.

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:09.440
 I don't need the test.

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:10.440
 I'm well aware.

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:13.560
 But make a lot of sense of a lot of things in your life.

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:17.240
 In the book itself, do you know what they're called or these replicants?

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:18.880
 I thought they were called replicants.

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:19.880
 That's in the movies.

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:21.240
 Yeah, in the book they're called Andy's.

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:22.240
 Love it.

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:23.240
 The plot sickens.

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:24.240
 Stop fighting crime.

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:25.240
 So here we go.

00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:33.840
 So some of them actually sort of a little bit upsetting.

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:39.320
 You have a little boy, and he shows you his butterfly collection, including his killing

00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:40.320
jar.

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:41.320
 Oh, dear.

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:42.320
 Yeah.

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:45.680
 So, I mean, it doesn't have a question mark on it, but I guess it's testing.

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:47.480
 Do you have an emotional reaction to that?

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:48.480
 Okay.

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:49.480
 Here you go.

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:50.480
 We can all go round.

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:54.280
 Describe in single words only the good things that come into your mind about your mother.

00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:55.280
 Killingjar.

00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:57.960
 Single words.

00:19:57.960 --> 00:19:58.960
 Fun.

00:19:58.960 --> 00:19:59.960
 Sexy.

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:06.520
 I'd also like to enter the word "sexy" for don't much.

00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:12.560
 I think when Freud says you get full marks, so this one, my brief case, nice, isn't it?

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:17.240
 Department issue, baby hide, 100% genuine human baby hide.

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:18.240
 Okay.

00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:19.920
 So I guess, yeah, it's supposed to make you fit.

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:22.400
 So if you're upset about that, you're probably human.

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:23.400
 Yeah.

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:24.400
 I have a strong reaction.

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:25.400
 You don't just take it on face value.

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:27.320
 You have an emotional reaction.

00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:28.320
 I think that's the test.

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:33.000
 And in the movie and in the book, they have a machine that specifically is looking directly

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.000
 into your eyeball.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.000
 So it's the dilation of the piece?

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.000
 Exactly.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.080
 The question is answered by your body.

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:39.080
 I see.

00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:40.080
 Yeah.

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:41.080
 Exactly.

00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:43.840
 It is a good film and it is a good book.

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:44.840
 It looks great, yeah.

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:45.840
 Yeah.

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:47.680
 But I think they are quite ponderous.

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:49.360
 Come at me in the comments if you disagree.

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:53.600
 What's the film you like, then, that you prefer in this sort of genre?

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:56.640
 He likes Pacific Rim.

00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:57.640
 What's Pacific Rim?

00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:01.120
 Well, big monsters have started coming up through the cracks in the ocean floor from

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:02.120
 another dimension.

00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:03.840
 We've got to build giant robots to fight them.

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:04.840
 Wow.

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:06.760
 Exciting at the side of Andy's bottom.

00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:11.320
 Oh, I'm saying this in that in Pacific Rim, everyone knows who isn't a robot and we can crack

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:14.720
 on with the real meat in the film, which is beating the monsters, the Kaiju.

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:15.720
 Oh, I see.

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:16.720
 Do you see what I mean?

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:17.720
 Yes.

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:20.000
 Harrison Ford isn't interrogating the robots because you don't like subtlety.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.080
 I'm saying I like Obviousness.

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:25.680
 There was one of the reviews of Blade Runner when it came out that said some of the scenes

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:31.080
 seem to have six subtexts, but no text and no context either.

00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:32.080
 Wow.

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:36.720
 I think it's so interesting because the questions that they were asking then about what are the

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:41.440
 capabilities of these machines that are working alongside us, are the questions that we are

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:42.440
 continuing to ask.

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:44.360
 The only thing that's changed is the technology.

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:46.840
 We're still asking those same things, aren't we?

00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:50.280
 Really, when I read it, it's incredibly poignant for what's going on right now in the world

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:51.280
 of AI, because extraordinary.

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:54.360
 I guess that's the thing of a good sci-fi writer like Philip K. Dick.

00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:58.600
 It's looking forward and seeing the problems we might run into, but it's also worth saying

00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:00.400
 the book is incredibly different from the movie.

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:05.120
 So there's an idea that you're asking the question, is Harrison Ford a replicant himself?

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:06.120
 Yeah.

00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:07.840
 Harrison Ford said he wasn't, Ridley Scott said he was.

00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:11.680
 So we don't even know from the filmmakers side which one is which.

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:13.920
 Which one of those two people wrote the...

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:14.920
 Neither.

00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:16.880
 We need to ask the person who wrote the script.

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:17.880
 Yes, exactly.

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:18.880
 Paul Hampton fan.

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:19.880
 Yeah.

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:25.400
 Quite clearly a robot panicking to try to think of a human name.

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:27.520
 Have you guys seen the movie Taking Tiger Mountain?

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:28.520
 No, what happens in that?

00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:29.520
 I think so.

00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:33.880
 What happens in that is what happens in the Blade Runner, the original book, because it eventually

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:35.760
 was adapted into a movie.

00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:37.480
 And that was starring Bill Paxton.

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:44.080
 So the novel that William Burrow's wrote, Blade Runner brackets a movie, was off the back

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:48.760
 of the original Alan Norse novel, Blade Runner.

00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:49.760
 Yeah.

00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:52.800
 And it was a pitch for it to be a screenplay and then he realised it probably wasn't going

00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:53.800
 to be adapted.

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:57.080
 So he turned it, Burrow's turned his work into a novella.

00:22:57.080 --> 00:23:02.080
 What that means is that he wrote the novel of the pitch, of the film, of the novel.

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:03.080
 Oh.

00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:04.080
 Interesting.

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:10.240
 And then Philip K. Dick was asked to write the novel of the movie, Blade Runner, yes.

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:12.520
 Of the book that he wrote.

00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:13.520
 Of his own book.

00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:14.520
 Yeah.

00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:17.840
 But he refused brilliant because he thought that if he did that, people would stop buying

00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:18.840
 his book.

00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:19.840
 Yeah.

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:20.840
 When that been amazing.

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:21.840
 It's so weird.

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:22.840
 It's so strange.

00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:23.840
 It's just the whole...

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:26.680
 I mean, this is probably the most confusing section we've ever done for an audience.

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:27.680
 We're trying to piece these together.

00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:30.160
 We need a big wall chart, don't we, with lines.

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:35.000
 Even that movie that I just mentioned, taking Tiger Mountain, which was the adaption of

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.360
 the Blade Runner original book.

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:38.360
 Pre-Burrow's.

00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:39.360
 Yeah.

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:45.760
 There was a movie that was made, which was based on a art film by Albert Camus, his book

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:47.080
 called The Stranger.

00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:49.960
 They filmed the whole thing, but they didn't do any dialogue for it because they thought

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:51.200
 they'd do that post.

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:56.600
 A new director came in, used all that stuff, but applied the Blade Runner.

00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:57.600
 No.

00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:58.600
 Who it?

00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:01.480
 Well, you think of the editor, please, while you're saying these facts.

00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:02.480
 It's so confusing.

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:08.080
 What's going to happen, James, is this section of the podcast, in years to come, there are

00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:11.080
 going to be seven or eight different cuts of this section of the podcast.

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:13.360
 They'll be the harking cut, sure.

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:15.360
 But they'll be the Shriver Cut.

00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:20.280
 But people, people quite often listen to podcasts to fall asleep, and this bit, they'll

00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:24.960
 think, is there subconscious, chopping it into different pieces and making it confusing,

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:25.960
 so they're not really listening properly.

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:29.280
 That sort of makes you think, we must have enough stuff filmed by now that we can basically

00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:30.280
 make everything new.

00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:31.720
 Let's just use our existing stuff.

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:36.600
 In the future, they're going to say, do you know the famous TV show and these bottom

00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:40.640
 sharks was actually based on a podcast?

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:42.120
 Yeah.

00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:45.880
 And bizarrely, Andy, what you just said, with having extra footage that we can just reuse,

00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:49.560
 that actually happened for Blade Runner the movie itself, because in the final scenes,

00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:54.520
 they used shots from the shining that weren't used in the main movie, and included it

00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:57.200
 as sort of background shots.

00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:59.200
 So the shining is in the Blade Runner movie.

00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:00.200
 Bloody hell.

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:01.200
 Yeah.

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:02.200
 It goes deep, doesn't it?

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:03.200
 It really does go deep.

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:08.360
 Isn't it true that the Alien World, the Blade Runner World, are one world together?

00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:11.880
 I was hoping this, but I haven't, she's watched them all and I haven't.

00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:12.880
 Interesting.

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:17.280
 But I think there's like one mention in the second Alien that says, yes, they're definitely

00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:18.280
 the same world.

00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:19.280
 That's terrific.

00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:22.680
 Because it might be things like the same company operating across the, because in Alien,

00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:24.840
 the whole thing is the wayland, you tiny corporation.

00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:27.240
 And that might get a mention and played it out, I don't know.

00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:28.240
 That's brilliant.

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:34.080
 Can I tell you a thing about William Burrows, the author who wrote, one of these, one of these

00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:35.080
 things.

00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:36.080
 Yeah.

00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:39.280
 So he was a big generation writer, a very interesting person.

00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:41.080
 I didn't really know anything about him.

00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:45.200
 The only thing I'd vaguely heard of, which is the awful thing in his life, which is that

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:48.920
 he and his wife once had taken a huge amount of drugs, and he tried to do a William

00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:53.280
 tell act shooting something off her head, and he missed and he shot her and he killed her.

00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:55.440
 I think that's his version.

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:58.760
 He was a really strange guy.

00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:00.560
 He was very eccentric.

00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:02.600
 He was on, huge numbers of drugs his whole life.

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:07.320
 He said that he could just stare at his shoes for eight hours a day and frequently did.

00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:11.600
 But do you know how Burrows had this lifestyle and was able to just sort of, so where his money

00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:12.600
 came from?

00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:13.600
 Yeah.

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:14.800
 Rich parents.

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:17.480
 He got an allowance from his parents until he was nearly 50.

00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:18.480
 Right.

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:23.080
 And what he got an allowance from his parents until he was nearly 50 is that his grandfather,

00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:27.400
 William Seward Burrows, the first, our William Burrows was the second.

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:30.680
 He had invented the Burrows Adding Machine.

00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:35.080
 It was a calculator and pretty much every business in America bought one of these adding

00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:36.080
 machines.

00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:37.080
 It was incredibly useful.

00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:40.400
 Is it one of those ones that you see in old movies where they can, it's like a big calculator

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:43.200
 and they go, "Pah, pah, pah, pah, pah, pah, pah, pah, pah, pah, pah."

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:44.200
 Pretty much.

00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:45.200
 And it prints out.

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:46.200
 It prints out a real, yeah.

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:47.200
 Exactly.

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:52.280
 And it's the biggest American computing companies in the 50s and 60s.

00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:53.880
 And what is this?

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:55.840
 It's a robot, a thinking machine.

00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:56.840
 Oh, I see.

00:26:56.840 --> 00:27:01.000
 And it's, it sort of allows blade runner to, right?

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.000
 Yeah.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:03.000
 Yeah.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.000
 Yeah.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.000
 Okay.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.000
 Sure.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.000
 So Philip K. Dick took words of drugs as well.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.000
 Yeah.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.000
 He was into the same things.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.000
 And apparently, in his life, he sort of saw like a rosy mist and all these kind of, he

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.600
 had, he had, in his final period of his life, it was in 1974.

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:21.080
 He saw a fish symbol and necklace on a woman glow red.

00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:25.320
 And he felt information suddenly just was transmitted to him.

00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:27.880
 And he believed that it was from an alien species.

00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:28.880
 Yeah.

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:31.400
 That's why I'm an excuse when you're staring at a woman's dress.

00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:32.400
 Yeah.

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:33.400
 Sorry.

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:34.400
 There's information coming.

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:35.400
 Yeah.

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:42.400
 Okay.

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:43.400
 It is time for fact number three.

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:44.400
 And that is James.

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:48.240
 Because that most people wouldn't wear a sweater owned by Hitler.

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:53.120
 But they might if Mother Teresa wore it for long enough in between.

00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:55.400
 So has she won this in like an eBay auction?

00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:57.200
 Like how did she get her hands on this?

00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:58.200
 She's bought it.

00:27:58.200 --> 00:27:59.200
 Yeah.

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:01.120
 Did she dry clean it after Hitler?

00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:02.760
 Has anyone cleaned it ever?

00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:09.040
 Well, this is a study called the contagion concept in adult thinking in the United States

00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:12.520
 by Carol Nemeroff and Paul Rosen.

00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:15.840
 And there's lots of different things that they did with this imaginary jumper.

00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:18.840
 So they had different people wear it.

00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:22.960
 So it might be Hitler, but it might be a lover of the person you're interviewing or it

00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:29.920
 might be someone they really admire or it might be that they rub it in dog poo or various

00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:30.920
 different things.

00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:31.920
 Yeah.

00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:38.360
 And then they try and ameliorate the effect by giving it to a nice person or they might

00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:43.200
 clean it with detergent or just with water or boil it or deodorize it.

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:44.200
 This is all imaginary.

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:45.200
 This is all made up.

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:46.200
 Okay.

00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:47.840
 And did they ever show you a picture of the jumper?

00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:48.840
 Yeah.

00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:49.840
 Or have you imagined it?

00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:50.840
 You imagine it.

00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:56.640
 It's simply a question of, would you wear this jumper if this had happened to it?

00:28:56.640 --> 00:29:00.600
 And then they took all of the different results of what everyone said and then generalised

00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:02.200
 to the entire world.

00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:06.840
 So, but actually they generalised to people in the US and the reason being that there's

00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:11.120
 this kind of thing called the Law of Contagion, which is a folk belief that you get all around

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:16.560
 the world where if you've been in contact with an object, then people think some of your

00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:18.760
 attributes go into that object.

00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:24.680
 It happens in Papua New Guinea, it happens in Africa, it happens in medieval Europe, you

00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:28.720
 get it quite a lot of, but this study was to see if it happened in the US as well.

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:32.880
 And what they found is the basics is that people would not wear anything that was worn

00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:39.240
 by Hitler, but they might wear it if someone good like Mother Teresa or someone sexy had

00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:41.240
 worn it in between.

00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:42.240
 And they would probably...

00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:45.600
 What are we saying Mother Teresa is not sexy, that's what we mean.

00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:48.560
 She looks so much like Dan Sommar.

00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:54.640
 Yeah, so Princess Diana, someone else who's sort of seeing this go into the US.

00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:55.640
 Sure, absolutely.

00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:56.640
 Yeah.

00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:59.360
 Because at the start they interview people and said, "Who do you think is good?

00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:00.360
 Who do you think is sexy?

00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:01.360
 Who do you think is trustworthy?"

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:07.520
 And with the sort of washing and stuff like that, basically, if you wash it or if you deodorise

00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:14.640
 it or if you air it out, people are slightly more likely to wear it, but if you boil it, then

00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:16.640
 they're really more likely to do so.

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:20.960
 If you get Hitler's jumper and you give it a good old, very hot wash, then people are

00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:22.600
 more likely to wear it after that.

00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:23.600
 I think though.

00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:24.600
 Yeah, this will.

00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:25.600
 Is it wool?

00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:26.600
 Yeah.

00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:31.320
 Because I did try to find evidence of any of Hitler's jumpers going up for auction.

00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:32.320
 Yeah.

00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:33.320
 Yeah.

00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:34.320
 He doesn't seem to have been a big jumper guy.

00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:35.320
 No.

00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:36.320
 No.

00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:37.320
 There's very little whose jacket, wasn't he?

00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:38.320
 Who's more jacket?

00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:39.720
 Well, one of his jackets did.

00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:46.760
 In 2016, there was a buyer who spent £600,000 at a single auction on Nazi memorabilia, including

00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:51.240
 things like the brass canister that contained the hydrogen cyanide that Gurri killed himself

00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:52.240
 with.

00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:53.240
 Wow.

00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:56.800
 I mean, quite abstract and quite gory stuff, but one of the things was £210,000 on Hitler's

00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:57.800
 jacket.

00:30:57.800 --> 00:30:58.800
 Right.

00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:01.920
 This man from Argentina, who declined to give his name.

00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:03.840
 That's a joke, isn't it?

00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:04.840
 No.

00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:05.840
 What?

00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:06.840
 No.

00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:07.840
 He said, I'm not going to tell you my name.

00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:08.840
 I am from Argentina.

00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:09.840
 Oh, my goodness.

00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:10.840
 I know.

00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:12.840
 So we can only speculate.

00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:13.840
 Yeah.

00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:14.840
 Crakey.

00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:15.840
 There was a thing.

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:16.840
 This guy, Paul Rosen.

00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:17.840
 Paul Rosen.

00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:18.840
 Yeah.

00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:22.960
 Very interesting character because he's sort of known as the leading authority on disgustingness.

00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:25.680
 He spends his life studying disgusting stuff.

00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:32.040
 And he was saying, if you were put off by the idea of Hitler, to what level would that bleed

00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:33.040
 into your life?

00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:37.680
 Because, for example, any glass of water that you drink in Europe will contain a few molecules

00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:39.960
 that would have passed through Hitler.

00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:45.760
 And so, if you found that out, does that put you off drinking like to what level are you

00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:46.760
 wanting an association?

00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:50.760
 And that's why I have my water ship, Den, from Argentina.

00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:57.760
 Yeah, no, you're right. I mean, if you did it, sorry, just to ask.

00:31:57.760 --> 00:31:58.760
 No, I think I know.

00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:00.480
 No, no, I'm not sure that he's put that to the study yet.

00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:04.280
 He was sort of talking about the extremes of where you could take the associations with Hitler

00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:05.280
 as a contagion.

00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:07.280
 And this one's done a few years ago, wasn't it the study genes?

00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:08.280
 1994.

00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:11.520
 Yeah, yeah, so I mean, I don't know how Hitler's reputation has been in America over the last

00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:12.520
 few years.

00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:13.520
 But how fashion has changed?

00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:14.520
 Yeah, fashion has changed.

00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:15.520
 How fashion has changed.

00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:16.520
 You have a fashion of the same.

00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:17.520
 You have a fashion of the same.

00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:18.520
 You have a fashion of the same.

00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:19.520
 You have a fashion of the same.

00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:24.160
 That out, I'm sorry, but she and Adolf did not have the same characteristics.

00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:27.360
 And so this is relevant in real life.

00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:28.360
 It's not just that many things.

00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:32.840
 So things like drinking water, so you mentioned the Hitler water thing, Den.

00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:33.840
 Yeah.

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:38.760
 So Hitler never went to Singapore, but Singapore, as far as I know, I mean, his allies

00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:39.760
 got there.

00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:40.760
 Never mind.

00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:46.040
 Point is, Singapore purifies water from sewage water, right?

00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:47.840
 And people drink it and it's fine.

00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:49.760
 I mean, it's absolutely fine, this water.

00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:51.360
 It has been treated.

00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:55.200
 It doesn't contain any contaminants, anything that you make you will.

00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:56.480
 It is clean water.

00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:59.960
 But in lots of other places around the world, places which don't have like the space constraints

00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:02.960
 of Singapore, people object massively to this.

00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:05.240
 And it's to do with this contagion theory.

00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:08.480
 So that is relevant to how we don't know the idea of it.

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:09.480
 It's the idea.

00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:11.400
 I mean, water effectively has been boiled.

00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:12.400
 Yes.

00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:16.400
 But our brains are just never going to keep up with something that high concept.

00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:20.280
 We're always going to add one and one together and go, that's the sewage.

00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:21.280
 Yeah.

00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:22.280
 Still, yeah.

00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:24.280
 What if Hitler's jumper was turned into a scarf?

00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:26.320
 Obviously unravelled all the wall and made something different.

00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:27.320
 Yeah.

00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:28.320
 Well, does that make a big difference?

00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:30.000
 It makes a little bit of a difference.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:36.800
 So they asked people if it had been re-knitted, gashed, unravelled, cut up and burned.

00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:38.360
 Would you wear it afterwards?

00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:40.440
 And burning had the best effects.

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:42.720
 Although it's not going to look like a burnt gem.

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:47.320
 Yeah. If it's re-knitted, some people are more likely to a little bit, but burning and

00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:52.640
 boiling seems to be, people will forgive any ice revolving if you do that.

00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:57.040
 And the area of this eye-found interesting and discussed, is discussed in a rousal.

00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:58.040
 Okay.

00:33:58.040 --> 00:33:59.040
 Did you look into that?

00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:00.040
 No.

00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:01.040
 No.

00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:02.040
 Andy.

00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:03.040
 Too busy living it.

00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:04.040
 What?

00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:05.040
 I don't know what that means.

00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:08.880
 Well, it is really, really, really interesting in human psychology.

00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:12.280
 So it's a bi-directional psychology.

00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:13.280
 Okay.

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:16.320
 So the two things co-exist, discussed in a rousal.

00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:22.560
 I knew about this because I had read probably in Mary Roach's book Bonk about the fact that when

00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:28.560
 women are aroused, they will do things that they consider disgusting when they're unaroused.

00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:33.080
 And that just makes such basic sense for evolution in that section.

00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:37.920
 What would say, would you mean, like, if I got my wife aroused?

00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:38.920
 Yeah.

00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:39.920
 And then I suddenly say, great.

00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:40.920
 Take the bins out.

00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:42.920
 I'm doing tests because you can't.

00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:43.920
 No, but this is a thing.

00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:44.920
 So I don't know if you're a wife.

00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:45.920
 There's a really good example.

00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:46.920
 Because I'll see you next time.

00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:47.920
 So many times.

00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:48.920
 It's cruel.

00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:59.000
 So basically, the really common sense thing is, if you ask a woman, what do you think of the

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:04.000
 idea of this sexual act and let's say something really quotidian, like oral sex?

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.000
 Okay.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.000
 That's quotidian.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.000
 So I go.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:12.160
 So very soberly, most people don't really like the idea of it, but when they're aroused

00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:13.520
 that goes out of the window.

00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:15.080
 And it only seems to happen with women.

00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:16.080
 But I look into it.

00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:18.320
 I've had three studies and they're all university students.

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:23.280
 And I worry that that's because 22-year-old students are just disgusting anyway, like the

00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:24.280
 men.

00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:26.080
 So they're very difficult to study.

00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:31.120
 But what they do, they make them watch arousing videos and then they get them to do different

00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:32.120
 tasks.

00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:35.000
 And some of them are like, eat, have a bite of that biscuit and it's next to a living

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:36.000
 worm.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.000
 Yeah, yeah.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.080
 People who have watched a physical, sort of soft-core erotica are more likely to bite the

00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:42.120
 biscuit and say they didn't discuss them.

00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:43.120
 Wow.

00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:44.120
 It's amazing.

00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:47.640
 And they're much more likely to touch what they're told is a bowl of used condoms.

00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:52.200
 If they've watched this sort of soft pornography, then if they've watched a video of the Olympics,

00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:55.960
 they just show them physical activity or sexual activity or obviously control group.

00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:56.960
 Yeah.

00:35:56.960 --> 00:36:01.040
 And this is men or women, or both, both, but the results seem to be showing a lot more

00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:02.040
 for women.

00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:07.080
 That's an idea for a restaurant, doesn't matter how good the food is, but you just put

00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:11.200
 porn on the TVs all the time, and people will enjoy the food more.

00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:12.200
 Yeah.

00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:17.200
 Welcome to Andy's bottom feeders.

00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:22.360
 Did you read about these studies that have shown that conservative people find things

00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:24.960
 more disgusting than liberal people?

00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:29.640
 And it's to such an extent that if you put a scanner on someone's head and you look

00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:35.200
 at their brain, you can show them one single image of, say, some food with maggots in.

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:41.160
 And you can measure their brain activity and you can tell with a 95 to 98% accuracy whether

00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:42.920
 they would vote conservative or liberal.

00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:43.920
 Wow.

00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:44.920
 Amazing.

00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:45.920
 Yeah.

00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:48.640
 There's lots of reasons why they think it might be the case, so obviously we don't really

00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:55.160
 know, but it's basically conservatives are a bit more trusting of the natural reactions.

00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:59.280
 And liberals are more likely to do something called cognitive reappraisal, which is you

00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:00.280
 see something disgusting.

00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:04.200
 But then you think, well, actually, it's just natural that maggots eat food because they're

00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:05.200
 animals as well.

00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:09.040
 And you kind of think about it yourself and come up with reasons about it rather than just

00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:10.640
 trusting your initial reaction.

00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:12.240
 So can we run elections based on this?

00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:15.000
 Like, do we need to bother with all the bits of paper and the foods?

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.760
 Can't we just all get our heads scanned and be told, let them or whatever?

00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:19.760
 Yeah.

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:22.000
 Like a sorting hat, but it's full of maggots.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.000
 It's fair for trying.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:30.120
 And it was all to get out because people saved the government billions.

00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:34.800
 One of us here is like clear to be disgusted for the rest of us.

00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:36.720
 Ooh, who could it be?

00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:37.720
 I love Tories.

00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:38.720
 Is it me?

00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:42.480
 Is it someone from the north of England?

00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:44.880
 It's not about being from the north of England.

00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:45.880
 Right.

00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:46.880
 And gender?

00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:47.880
 It's not gender.

00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:48.880
 Oh.

00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:49.880
 Is it?

00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:50.880
 Glass is wearing glasses.

00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:51.880
 It's not glasses.

00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:52.880
 It's like, guess who now?

00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:54.360
 Is it people who like golf?

00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:56.240
 It's not even like golf.

00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:59.720
 It's something one of us puts in their mouth on a regular basis.

00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:00.720
 Oh.

00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:01.720
 Smoking?

00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:02.720
 No.

00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:03.720
 Being vegan.

00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:04.720
 Oh.

00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:05.720
 Being vegan.

00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:09.720
 If you come off meat for a month, you are likely to catch disgust.

00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:14.440
 So the more people cut out meat droogues, say they're doing veganery, the more their meat

00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:15.440
 disgust will grow.

00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:16.440
 Oh.

00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:18.920
 So I mean, it's actually not, I mean, because you've been a vegan for ages.

00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:22.200
 Well, I've been a vegetarian since I was seven and I was talking to someone recently

00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:26.520
 and actually, when I speak to people who give up meat and come back to meat, they have such

00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:27.520
 a different response.

00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:28.520
 Because for me, it's like cannibalism.

00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:32.000
 And obviously, I don't talk about this when they're eating their food and it's just a personal

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.520
 actually, don't say it out loud because it's not a moral judgment.

00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:35.520
 Yeah.

00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:37.520
 I do understand that people get to choose their own food.

00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:42.920
 But for me, there's no difference between a beef burger and oh, yeah, this is a human

00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:43.920
 charm.

00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:44.920
 A human burger.

00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:45.920
 Yeah, a man burger.

00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:46.920
 Yeah.

00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:47.920
 Yeah.

00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:48.920
 Long pig.

00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:49.920
 What's they call it?

00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:52.920
 I'm just trying to keep it easy.

00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:53.920
 You know what?

00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:54.920
 He likes it too.

00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:55.920
 He does this all the time.

00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:58.120
 Just a lot of these words come out very, very creepy.

00:38:58.120 --> 00:39:00.120
 I think that one is a miscreepy.

00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:03.160
 I'm not afraid of saying that.

00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:08.400
 So Paul Rosen, I mean, he's done so many studies on this and all of them are interesting.

00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:10.840
 I'm just, it's so fascinating what he's done.

00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:12.480
 So here's a really interesting one.

00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:15.080
 This is all about food, right?

00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:19.600
 And this is I think from 1986 and he's just been doing decades.

00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:23.040
 He reported that most participants showed a preference for a normally shaped piece of

00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:25.640
 fudge over fudge shaped like dog feces.

00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:29.080
 Now, I would say so far, so obvious, right?

00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:33.480
 Many were far less willing to hold fake vomit made of rubber in their mouths than a clean

00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:35.160
 new rubber sink stopper.

00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:36.160
 Again.

00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:37.160
 Yeah.

00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:39.400
 But yeah, I know he's telling people it's clean.

00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:40.400
 That's the thing.

00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:41.400
 It's the association.

00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:42.400
 You do.

00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:46.000
 If you go to any tourist shop in England, you can buy poo shapes candy.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:47.000
 Hmm.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:48.000
 You do.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:53.240
 The first version of this in my life where my, my son, he got really obsessed with the toilet

00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:54.320
 brush.

00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:56.560
 And so obviously there's two things we had to do.

00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:59.600
 One is I bought a brand new toilet brush with a toilet and I bought him his own toilet

00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:03.120
 brush and it's from the same place.

00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:07.760
 And no one's comfortable with him playing with it because it's a toilet brush and it's

00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:11.360
 never been used in the toilet until he did, he did start using it in the toilet because

00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:12.360
 he wants the reaction.

00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:15.040
 But at the beginning, it was just Christmas and everyone was at tonight.

00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:16.040
 I was weird.

00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:17.960
 No, I get that completely.

00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:18.960
 I understand.

00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:19.960
 Yeah.

00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:20.960
 But it's just a brush.

00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:24.960
 The first ever Christmas tree was made out of toilet brushes and painted green, yeah.

00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:26.840
 So in a way, you would be a very festive.

00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:27.840
 Very Christmassy.

00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:28.840
 Yeah.

00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:30.840
 This year, everyone's getting one there.

00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:32.120
 We're the fun fact attached.

00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:33.120
 Yeah.

00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:34.120
 Okay.

00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:42.320
 It's time for our final fact of the show and that is Andy.

00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:45.840
 My fact is, there is a spider in Norfolk which can catch fish.

00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:49.960
 Do you know what the creepiest thing anyone could ever say to you?

00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:51.720
 That's what Carrie had said to me yesterday.

00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:54.920
 She said, Andy text me, is Sarah scared of spiders?

00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:55.920
 Oh, yeah.

00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:59.160
 That's a creepy thing to hear, isn't it?

00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:00.920
 I asked her not to pass that on.

00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:01.920
 She told me that as well.

00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:02.920
 She made it creepy.

00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:06.080
 He said, he said, not to tell you I've asked.

00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:08.080
 Oh, dear.

00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:10.080
 And you're not too scared of spiders.

00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:11.080
 I'm not scared of spiders, no?

00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:12.080
 Some people are very funny.

00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:13.080
 Yes, yes.

00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:14.080
 So I just wanted to check that out before we...

00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:17.600
 Are you asking just to see if we can even talk about the concept of spiders?

00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:18.600
 Yeah.

00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:19.600
 Yeah.

00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:20.600
 Okay.

00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:25.760
 And this is the queen of the marsh, the fenn raft spider, Norfolk, and Suffolk as well.

00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:28.360
 Sorry to any Suffolkers who are listening who thought I'd be missing you out.

00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:30.680
 And it's just a really cool spider.

00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:32.320
 It's just about the biggest in the UK, I think.

00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:33.320
 How big is it?

00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:34.320
 Show me your hand.

00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:35.320
 About that big.

00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:36.320
 Great.

00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:37.320
 It's massive.

00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:38.320
 It's broad.

00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:39.320
 Yeah, yeah.

00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:40.320
 It's broad.

00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:41.320
 It's not a big broad.

00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:43.320
 And it's another great story of reintroduction.

00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:44.760
 They got down to a very, very few left.

00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:48.640
 And then the people who live around there who are working conservation have restored their

00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:50.960
 habitat load and they've been breeding them up.

00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:56.880
 And the RSPB recently announced not so insi-winsi spider makes incredible comeback.

00:41:56.880 --> 00:41:58.640
 And they're really cool.

00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:00.440
 And they're not interested in your house.

00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:01.440
 They don't like you.

00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:02.760
 If you don't like spiders, don't worry.

00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:03.760
 They're not coming for you.

00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:04.760
 Yeah.

00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:09.240
 And they can basically sit on top of the water, which is the most fascinating thing if you

00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:10.560
 watch a video with them.

00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:11.560
 Fenn raft spider.

00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:12.560
 They are the rough.

00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:13.560
 It's extraordinary.

00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:17.080
 It's the hairs as now on the legs that allow them to do that, I think.

00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:19.760
 And that also helps them to feel vibration.

00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:24.240
 So if a fish is going past, they can just feel the vibration on their little hairs and go

00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:25.240
 fuck.

00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:27.160
 And they run across the water and they grab the fit.

00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:28.160
 I mean, there's sticker packs, obviously.

00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:29.920
 There's not salmon or anything that are catching.

00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:30.920
 But they are.

00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:31.920
 They're pretty cool.

00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:35.800
 They're slightly big relative to the size of the spider itself, you know, because the

00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:37.360
 spider can go underwater as well.

00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:41.880
 So it will go down on the branch of a vine or whatever that's going into the water.

00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:42.880
 It will just hang out there.

00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:44.720
 It can stay there for about an hour.

00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:49.360
 And I've seen videos of, you know, little creatures coming up and launching like a spider

00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:51.440
 wood and bringing it back in and consuming it.

00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:54.080
 And they're close to the same size as the spider.

00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:59.640
 Can we talk about Helen Smith who is the heroine of this whole story of bringing the spiders

00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:01.680
 back into the North at Bronze.

00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:08.560
 So she hand-reared 3,000 baby Fenn raft spiders in her own kitchen.

00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:12.600
 And these are the first ones that they put into the water.

00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:17.440
 And eventually some other charities got involved and they eventually put 30,000 in.

00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:19.280
 But she definitely started it.

00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:24.400
 And she would line up every single one of these spiders in an individual test tube.

00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:27.120
 Because if you put two of them in a test tube, they'd just eat each other.

00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:29.360
 So they had to be all kept separate.

00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:34.600
 And then she had to personally feed them flies for a full year so that they would grow big

00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:35.880
 enough to let them go.

00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:36.880
 30,000.

00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:41.640
 The 3,000 she did and then eventually it was 30,000.

00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:45.960
 And she had to collect the flies herself, because they eat like fruit flies.

00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:50.680
 There's things I want to make fun of her a lot, but I'm also really scared of her.

00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:54.280
 I think there's a kind of, as you don't want to make an enemy of someone with access to

00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:57.400
 3,000 spiders and with that kind of attention to detail.

00:43:57.400 --> 00:43:58.720
 That's what you should have asked her.

00:43:58.720 --> 00:43:59.720
 You should have asked her.

00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:00.720
 You scared Helen.

00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:04.760
 Yeah, I'm really scared of Helen from Norfolk.

00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:09.360
 She had to get these fruit flies and apparently the best place to get them was from compost

00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:12.240
 heaps or horse dung.

00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:17.640
 And so she said, how aroused was she?

00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:23.520
 She said she had spent a lot of time with a sweep net following ponies and waiting for them

00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:27.920
 to poo, just so that she could get the flies when they first arrived on the poo.

00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:28.920
 Isn't that mad?

00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:35.000
 The neighbors, the people who didn't know what she was doing, all of her behaviour, do you

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.320
 want to come in for a cup of tea?

00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:38.320
 She's here.

00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:39.320
 What have done?

00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:40.320
 So cool.

00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:41.320
 And you now get spider tourism.

00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:44.680
 People visit these nature reserves because their webs are, I mean, they are massive and

00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:45.680
 they're webs are massive too.

00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:47.760
 The webs are apparently the size of a normal pizza.

00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:48.760
 Yeah.

00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:49.760
 Wow.

00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:52.760
 And then, obviously, when they give birth, there's thousands and thousands more.

00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:53.760
 Oh, yeah.

00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:54.760
 Yeah.

00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:55.760
 So little baby ones.

00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:56.760
 Yeah, right.

00:44:56.760 --> 00:44:58.480
 Pretty good mums.

00:44:58.480 --> 00:44:59.480
 The female fan runs by.

00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:00.480
 It's not all spiders are.

00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:01.480
 Not all spiders are.

00:45:01.480 --> 00:45:08.000
 Well, female, she has an egg sack, which is just a big bag of eggs and she carries it round

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:11.000
 for three weeks in this bag.

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.760
 And if it gets too cold, she will lift the bag up towards the sun.

00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:17.840
 And if it gets too hot, she would dunk it in the water to cool it down a bit.

00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:21.080
 And she goes that whole time without eating because, you know, busy.

00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:25.320
 And then she spins this nursery web, as it's called, the size of a pizza.

00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:26.600
 And suspends that above water.

00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:31.400
 And if you go to the north and broads to see these things, you can see these disks just off

00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:37.120
 the path in the water, these nursery webs, full of the spiderlings.

00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:38.120
 But yeah, spiders.

00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:40.560
 Well, these ones, just one more thing about these ones.

00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:43.440
 They're one of only two spiders protected in UK law.

00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:44.440
 Really?

00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:45.440
 Yeah.

00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:48.040
 The Ladybird spider is the other one.

00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:52.120
 It's the Wildlife and Countryside Act of 1981.

00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:59.040
 So if you intentionally kill, injure or take a raft spider, then you guilty of an offence.

00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:04.200
 And if you say that you're intending to sell one as well, that's illegal.

00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:05.280
 On the dark web.

00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:06.280
 Oh.

00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:07.280
 Oh.

00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:08.280
 Thank you.

00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:09.280
 Very, very good.

00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:10.280
 Thank you.

00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:11.280
 Very, very good.

00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:14.040
 Other animals that you are not allowed to kill in the UK, the water bite, the grasshopper,

00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:20.080
 the trembling sea mat, the slow worm, the glutinous snail, the small blue butterfly and

00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:22.800
 the large blue, basically any blue butterfly.

00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:26.160
 That's why we can't do almost the liberty to get me out of here in this country.

00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:27.160
 Yeah.

00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:30.560
 It's the place of Australia where we can eat everything.

00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:32.600
 Did you say the glutinous sea mat?

00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:34.120
 No, I said the glutinous snail.

00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:36.120
 Oh, there was a sea mat in it.

00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:37.120
 There's trembling on something.

00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:38.120
 Yeah.

00:46:38.120 --> 00:46:39.120
 Yeah, sea mat.

00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:40.120
 That's an amazing, I've never heard of that.

00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:41.120
 No.

00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:46.120
 They live in the sea around the United Kingdom and they're basically algal mats, I think,

00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:47.120
 tremors.

00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:50.160
 That kind of knock off sponge bulb square pants is what I'm hearing.

00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:51.160
 Yeah.

00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:52.160
 I'll give you that.

00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:54.160
 Are they just terrified the whole time?

00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:55.160
 They shouldn't be because they're protected.

00:46:55.160 --> 00:46:56.160
 Yeah.

00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:58.160
 You know, it's rising sea levels, global warming.

00:46:58.160 --> 00:46:59.160
 Yeah.

00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:01.160
 Are there the only people that are worried?

00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:07.240
 I think the scared of adding these buttons, just to bring that back.

00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:10.760
 You know that spiders can inventimate you after they've been squished.

00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:11.760
 What?

00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:16.760
 So, this was a story from this year in California, there was a 37-year-old woman who went

00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:22.840
 to the emergency room because her eye was all swollen and goopy and felt like it was burning.

00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:27.000
 And apparently 20 minutes earlier, her husband had killed a Western and Black Widow spider

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:28.000
 with a hammer.

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:33.480
 It splattered in all directions and some of it went in her eye and she got invented.

00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:34.480
 Oh my God.

00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:37.480
 How closely was she looking at the spider?

00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:39.800
 Before we hammered it, there's so much of that story that's horrible.

00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:40.800
 Yeah, yes.

00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:42.320
 The hammered a spider to death.

00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:43.320
 It's an awful story.

00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:45.680
 I think what I'm saying is don't squish spiders.

00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:46.680
 No.

00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:47.680
 There's no need to.

00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:48.680
 No, there are friends.

00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:49.680
 Yeah.

00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:51.920
 Well, Black Widow spiders are not our friends.

00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:52.920
 I don't know.

00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:55.200
 But they're still important to the ecosystem.

00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:56.200
 Absolutely.

00:47:56.200 --> 00:47:57.200
 Yeah.

00:47:57.200 --> 00:47:58.200
 So am I.

00:47:58.200 --> 00:47:59.200
 Yeah.

00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:00.200
 That's a human being.

00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:01.200
 There's too many of us.

00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:02.200
 Yeah.

00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:05.040
 Not you personally, but in terms of the ecosystem.

00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:06.040
 No, no, that's fine.

00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:09.560
 But if we're going to start with anyone, Andy, we might as well, you know.

00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:11.840
 I feel like I have a good run.

00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:16.920
 I always say to my daughter, whenever the spider, I'm like spiders are our friends and they're

00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:17.920
 really important.

00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:21.840
 And I am actually terrified of spiders, so I don't really believe it when I say it.

00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:23.920
 I mean, I do believe it, but I'm like hiding my fear.

00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:26.400
 You have to show that you're not afraid of this trick.

00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:30.720
 Do you find that it helps you that it's helping your response to spiders that you now

00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:31.720
 can't?

00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:32.720
 Maybe.

00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:33.720
 I suppose so.

00:48:33.720 --> 00:48:35.920
 I can't show fear in front of my daughter.

00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:36.920
 Yeah.

00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:37.920
 It's a reinforced fear.

00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:38.920
 Yeah.

00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:41.640
 So actually, I think it's really good for lots of, you know, lots of people to walk when

00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:45.360
 they have children to then temper it, and then you go, actually, I am less panicky about

00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:46.360
 it.

00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:49.600
 And if you have to be the person that puts it safely outside, do you realize my wife does

00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:50.600
 that?

00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:51.600
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:56.480
 But that's only because you're trying to arouse her.

00:48:56.480 --> 00:48:57.480
 Did you do down the drain?

00:48:57.480 --> 00:49:00.720
 Did you get the photo I sent you recently, not long ago, for Big Spider and a little while

00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:01.720
 we didn't reply to?

00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:02.720
 Was it, well, was it mum?

00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:03.720
 It was a big spider.

00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:04.720
 On email.

00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:05.720
 No, it was WhatsApp.

00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:06.720
 Oh, yeah.

00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:07.720
 I don't recall.

00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:08.720
 How big was it?

00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:09.720
 It was big.

00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:10.720
 It was a house spider.

00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:12.360
 But it was a big one.

00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:13.360
 It was in my house.

00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:14.360
 It was not only in my house, Sarah.

00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:17.640
 It fell onto my naked shoulder as I sat in bed.

00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:22.800
 Andy, I've got an experience very, very, very similar where I was once cancelling a dentist

00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:26.040
 appointment, and I could feel a little thing of hair in my face like this.

00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:27.040
 Oh, no.

00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:29.560
 I was just brushing this hair off, because I was interested in what you were saying about

00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:30.560
 the hair balancing on the water.

00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:32.200
 I was just brushing this hair off my face.

00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:36.300
 So first in the morning, and then I pushed, and then I heard it hit the floor, and it

00:49:36.300 --> 00:49:37.300
 was so massive.

00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:41.400
 And there's a mirror there, and I think, if I'd actually seen it on my face, I would have

00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:42.400
 died.

00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:46.940
 If I'd actually seen it on my face, I'd just felt it there.

00:49:46.940 --> 00:49:50.620
 So having just got out of it, they do come on us in the night.

00:49:50.620 --> 00:49:51.620
 They do come on us in the night.

00:49:51.620 --> 00:49:53.820
 And I did see the photo now that you say it, Andy.

00:49:53.820 --> 00:49:54.820
 I do remember.

00:49:54.820 --> 00:49:55.820
 It was bad.

00:49:55.820 --> 00:49:56.820
 It was bad.

00:49:56.820 --> 00:49:57.820
 A glass couldn't fit over it.

00:49:57.820 --> 00:49:58.820
 Well, yeah.

00:49:58.820 --> 00:49:59.820
 I have very narrow necked glasses.

00:49:59.820 --> 00:50:00.820
 But still.

00:50:00.820 --> 00:50:01.820
 You should have only drank champagne.

00:50:01.820 --> 00:50:03.820
 I should have started with the flute.

00:50:03.820 --> 00:50:04.820
 I should have gone with the marion.

00:50:04.820 --> 00:50:05.820
 But that was my fault.

00:50:05.820 --> 00:50:11.740
 And it was just from a clear blue sky, from a ceiling, basically, from a ceiling.

00:50:11.740 --> 00:50:12.740
 What the heck?

00:50:12.740 --> 00:50:13.740
 Yeah.

00:50:13.740 --> 00:50:14.740
 I find it.

00:50:14.740 --> 00:50:18.140
 So as someone who spent my teenage years in Australia, I don't.

00:50:18.140 --> 00:50:21.060
 They're friendly here, comparative to Australia, where they kill you.

00:50:21.060 --> 00:50:23.780
 So it's, I don't find them in any way scary here.

00:50:23.780 --> 00:50:24.780
 There's a few.

00:50:24.780 --> 00:50:25.780
 There was a great incident I read about.

00:50:25.780 --> 00:50:27.060
 We're a guy called Matthew Stevens.

00:50:27.060 --> 00:50:28.780
 He was a chef.

00:50:28.780 --> 00:50:32.780
 And he was cleaning behind a freezer at the Quantac Gateway pub in Bridgewater when

00:50:32.780 --> 00:50:37.860
 suddenly he would, yeah, we've all been there.

00:50:37.860 --> 00:50:42.220
 And he was, he was bitten twice on his hand by what turned out to be a Brazilian wandering

00:50:42.220 --> 00:50:43.380
 spider.

00:50:43.380 --> 00:50:44.860
 And that is very dangerous.

00:50:44.860 --> 00:50:45.860
 Yes.

00:50:45.860 --> 00:50:47.580
 They come in like bananas, don't they?

00:50:47.580 --> 00:50:49.060
 And this is where this came from.

00:50:49.060 --> 00:50:52.660
 It traveled in the bananas overseas, made it to him.

00:50:52.660 --> 00:50:56.580
 And this is, this is how intense the spider, this kind of spider is.

00:50:56.580 --> 00:51:02.020
 Once he knocked it off of him, he knocked it into an open freezer, and then he drenched

00:51:02.020 --> 00:51:03.860
 it in boiling water.

00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:05.100
 And it still was just fine.

00:51:05.100 --> 00:51:06.980
 Well, that's because you've got hot and cold.

00:51:06.980 --> 00:51:08.380
 It was just a very pleasant temperature.

00:51:08.380 --> 00:51:09.380
 Oh, you're right.

00:51:09.380 --> 00:51:12.260
 This is on a spa, it's like a lukewarm bar.

00:51:12.260 --> 00:51:13.260
 Yes.

00:51:13.260 --> 00:51:18.260
 The spider's thinking, oh, I will review the Quantac's well.

00:51:18.260 --> 00:51:19.260
 Yeah.

00:51:19.260 --> 00:51:23.500
 And so they collected the spider in the jar and they brought it to where he was at the

00:51:23.500 --> 00:51:24.500
 hospital.

00:51:24.500 --> 00:51:25.500
 Someone in the hospital.

00:51:25.500 --> 00:51:26.500
 Why did they do that?

00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:27.500
 I guess if you want to start.

00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:28.500
 Yeah.

00:51:28.500 --> 00:51:30.780
 You meant to show what bit you, because you're like, we need the anti-vener.

00:51:30.780 --> 00:51:31.780
 Sorry.

00:51:31.780 --> 00:51:34.900
 I was recovering in hospital and they found it and brought it in here like a year ago.

00:51:34.900 --> 00:51:35.900
 You were there.

00:51:35.900 --> 00:51:36.900
 You were there.

00:51:36.900 --> 00:51:41.180
 The worst is when I was attacked by a bear, and I had to bring the bear into the hospital.

00:51:41.180 --> 00:51:43.100
 So this is why I was attacked by a bear.

00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:46.340
 Yeah, but so they brought it in and it was in a jar, and then someone who worked in the

00:51:46.340 --> 00:51:49.580
 hospital saw it and thought, oh, I should put this back out and let it back loose.

00:51:49.580 --> 00:51:50.580
 Oh.

00:51:50.580 --> 00:51:51.580
 Oh, it's in the wild.

00:51:51.580 --> 00:51:52.580
 Yeah.

00:51:52.580 --> 00:51:53.980
 And they said we probably shouldn't worry, because it was probably going to die a couple

00:51:53.980 --> 00:51:54.980
 of days after.

00:51:54.980 --> 00:51:56.580
 I think it wouldn't like it in which water.

00:51:56.580 --> 00:51:57.580
 Yeah.

00:51:57.580 --> 00:51:58.580
 Exactly.

00:51:58.580 --> 00:51:59.580
 It's the temperatures.

00:51:59.580 --> 00:52:00.580
 Yeah.

00:52:00.580 --> 00:52:01.580
 Yeah.

00:52:01.580 --> 00:52:07.740
 Drief, should we have a positive spide effect, as opposed to all this scary stuff?

00:52:07.740 --> 00:52:11.820
 Some people think, I want to say people, I mean, scientists, consider that a spide is web

00:52:11.820 --> 00:52:13.660
 should be considered part of its mind.

00:52:13.660 --> 00:52:14.660
 Right.

00:52:14.660 --> 00:52:15.660
 Okay.

00:52:15.660 --> 00:52:16.660
 This is where it is, isn't it?

00:52:16.660 --> 00:52:20.220
 So it's an externalisation of, not of consciousness, but of thought.

00:52:20.220 --> 00:52:21.220
 Is that why?

00:52:21.220 --> 00:52:22.220
 Yeah.

00:52:22.220 --> 00:52:25.700
 Because I guess the web, if it's as far away from it feels the movement, therefore your

00:52:25.700 --> 00:52:26.940
 brain is registering.

00:52:26.940 --> 00:52:27.940
 Exactly.

00:52:27.940 --> 00:52:28.940
 Right.

00:52:28.940 --> 00:52:29.940
 And they have foresight.

00:52:29.940 --> 00:52:33.860
 They change their web structure based on how much they have left in their silk glands.

00:52:33.860 --> 00:52:36.820
 So if they're running a bit low, they'll make a simpler web.

00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:39.740
 So it's kind of an external brain in lots of ways.

00:52:39.740 --> 00:52:44.300
 So it would be like antennae going off what Dan said in terms of, or, you know, like, animals

00:52:44.300 --> 00:52:48.060
 where they can feel whether they're going to a space that's too small, that there's an externalisation

00:52:48.060 --> 00:52:49.060
 of sense, isn't it?

00:52:49.060 --> 00:52:50.060
 Right, whiskers.

00:52:50.060 --> 00:52:51.060
 Yeah, whiskers.

00:52:51.060 --> 00:52:52.060
 Yeah.

00:52:52.060 --> 00:52:55.420
 Although they'll do market research on what's hitting their web and sticking.

00:52:55.420 --> 00:52:59.900
 So if prey is hitting it and bouncing off, they'll rejig the web so it's got more sticky

00:52:59.900 --> 00:53:01.700
 pads on it to catch more.

00:53:01.700 --> 00:53:05.100
 Or if the local prey is a different size to what they're expecting, they'll change the

00:53:05.100 --> 00:53:06.100
 web based on that.

00:53:06.100 --> 00:53:07.100
 It's so cool.

00:53:07.100 --> 00:53:08.780
 It's really good, isn't it?

00:53:08.780 --> 00:53:09.780
 They are good.

00:53:09.780 --> 00:53:10.780
 Yeah.

00:53:10.780 --> 00:53:11.780
 That's right.

00:53:11.780 --> 00:53:16.740
 The male Asian hermit spiders become better at fighting if you cut their penises off.

00:53:16.740 --> 00:53:17.740
 Yeah.

00:53:17.740 --> 00:53:20.340
 Like what they're getting in the way, or what is it that's?

00:53:20.340 --> 00:53:21.340
 No.

00:53:21.340 --> 00:53:25.500
 So what, they're one of these spiders where after they've had sex, they usually remove

00:53:25.500 --> 00:53:28.980
 their penises and keep it inside the female's reproductive tract.

00:53:28.980 --> 00:53:29.980
 Oh, yeah.

00:53:29.980 --> 00:53:30.980
 No other male can.

00:53:30.980 --> 00:53:31.980
 Yeah.

00:53:31.980 --> 00:53:32.980
 Yeah, there's a plug.

00:53:32.980 --> 00:53:33.980
 Oh.

00:53:33.980 --> 00:53:34.980
 But they also get...

00:53:34.980 --> 00:53:35.980
 It's really common.

00:53:35.980 --> 00:53:36.980
 It's really common.

00:53:36.980 --> 00:53:38.980
 In nature, yes, because it's one of the best ways of sperm competition.

00:53:38.980 --> 00:53:39.980
 Yeah.

00:53:39.980 --> 00:53:44.900
 But the other thing they do to make sure that their sperm is successful is they become very,

00:53:44.900 --> 00:53:48.620
 very aggressive and they start fighting off any other spiders who come and try and make

00:53:48.620 --> 00:53:49.620
 with the female.

00:53:49.620 --> 00:53:54.300
 And so that means if you just cut the penis off, then they still get all these hormones

00:53:54.300 --> 00:53:57.380
 or whatever they are to make them really aggressive and they'll just get really, really

00:53:57.380 --> 00:53:58.380
 fighting.

00:53:58.380 --> 00:53:59.380
 So what are you proposing?

00:53:59.380 --> 00:54:02.380
 Just go proposal here.

00:54:02.380 --> 00:54:05.380
 We have a lot of modifications to the British army.

00:54:05.380 --> 00:54:16.780
 Okay, that's it, that is all of our facts.

00:54:16.780 --> 00:54:18.180
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:54:18.180 --> 00:54:21.180
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us about the things that we've said over

00:54:21.180 --> 00:54:24.180
 the course of this podcast, we can all be found online.

00:54:24.180 --> 00:54:26.380
 I'm on @tribaland on Instagram.

00:54:26.380 --> 00:54:27.380
 James.

00:54:27.380 --> 00:54:29.380
 There's no such thing as James Harkin.

00:54:29.380 --> 00:54:30.380
 Andy?

00:54:30.380 --> 00:54:31.380
 Mine is Andrew Hunter M and Sarah.

00:54:31.380 --> 00:54:33.380
 Sarah Pasco on Instagram.

00:54:33.380 --> 00:54:34.380
 Yeah.

00:54:34.380 --> 00:54:35.380
 And you're on tour now, yeah?

00:54:35.380 --> 00:54:36.380
 Yes, yeah.

00:54:36.380 --> 00:54:37.380
 I'm on tour until March 2026.

00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:41.380
 So if anyone like to come, I'm going to put in some facts about spiders.

00:54:41.380 --> 00:54:45.380
 And Helen, you've got a free ticket if you want to go.

00:54:45.380 --> 00:54:49.860
 Yeah, or you can get to us as a group by emailing us on podcast@qy.com.

00:54:49.860 --> 00:54:52.700
 All of those emails make their way over to Andy.

00:54:52.700 --> 00:54:57.860
 Andy often picks out some of them to include in our bonus show that we do called Drop Us

00:54:57.860 --> 00:54:58.860
 Align.

00:54:58.860 --> 00:55:00.380
 And that's part of a thing called Club Fish.

00:55:00.380 --> 00:55:04.300
 It's a very exciting private members club that we've set up that has all sorts of bonus

00:55:04.300 --> 00:55:06.020
 material that you can get access to.

00:55:06.020 --> 00:55:08.740
 So check that out and you can check that out by going to our website.

00:55:08.740 --> 00:55:10.340
 No such thing as a fish.com.

00:55:10.340 --> 00:55:11.700
 There's also merch up there.

00:55:11.700 --> 00:55:14.940
 Otherwise just come back here next week because we will be back with another episode and

00:55:14.940 --> 00:55:15.940
 we'll see you then.

00:55:15.940 --> 00:55:16.940
 Goodbye.

00:55:16.940 --> 00:55:26.940
