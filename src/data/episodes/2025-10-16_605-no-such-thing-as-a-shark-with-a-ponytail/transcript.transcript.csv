00:00:00,00:00:04,"Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, where we were"
00:00:04,00:00:09,joined by the wonderful Sarah Pasco.
00:00:09,00:00:13,Now there is no one I don't think in Britain who doesn't know who Sarah Pasco is and probably
00:00:13,00:00:17,if you listen to this show around the world you'll know her as well because she has been
00:00:17,00:00:22,"on fish before, but just as a quick reminder she is an incredible stand up comedian and"
00:00:22,00:00:28,"TV presenter who is a good friend of ours, she does a podcast as well, she does a show"
00:00:28,00:00:34,"called Weirdo's Book Club with fellow fish alumnus Carrie Adloid, but she is on all the"
00:00:34,00:00:38,"panel shows she's been on QI a million times, she's absolutely brilliant, we love having"
00:00:38,00:00:44,"her on all of our shows, but one important thing to say about Sarah is that she is currently"
00:00:44,00:00:49,"on tour, if you would like to see her show and you live somewhere in the UK there is"
00:00:49,00:00:54,an extremely good chance that she will be coming to your town in November or in the spring
00:00:54,00:00:58,"next year, and to find out the shortest amount of travel you will have to make to get to"
00:00:58,00:01:09,"her shows, you must go to Sarah Pasco.co.uk/tickets her website is S-A-R-A-P-A-S-C-O-E.co.uk because"
00:01:09,00:01:11,that is how you spell her name.
00:01:11,00:01:15,"So go to Sarah Pasco.co.uk to get tickets for her show, but in the meantime please enjoy"
00:01:15,00:01:33,"our show, on with a podcast."
00:01:33,00:01:38,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming"
00:01:38,00:01:40,to you from the QI offices in Hobern.
00:01:40,00:01:44,"My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray, and"
00:01:44,00:01:49,"Sarah Pasco, and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favourite"
00:01:49,00:01:54,"facts from the last seven days, and in a particular order here we go."
00:01:54,00:01:57,"Starting with fact number one, and that is Sarah."
00:01:57,00:02:03,"My fact, and I'm underlying the word fact there, the reasons that will become clear, my fact"
00:02:03,00:02:07,is Saturn's wings are younger than sharks.
00:02:07,00:02:18,"So when you say fact, and you underline it, weirdly we've never had a guest underline the headline"
00:02:18,00:02:20,"fact before, and it makes me instantly suspicious."
00:02:20,00:02:28,"Yes, well H is butter concept, and when I looked into the inverted commas proof of both"
00:02:28,00:02:32,"of the ages, Saturn and sharks I felt like well there's lots to debate here."
00:02:32,00:02:37,"Okay, so do you stand by it or not, like if you had to bet your life on it."
00:02:37,00:02:41,"I would have to do more research probably, so let me tell you where the whole ageing of"
00:02:41,00:02:44,Saturn's wings comes from.
00:02:44,00:02:49,"So there's a Cassini spacecraft, combination of NASA, the European Space Agency, and also"
00:02:49,00:02:54,"the Italian Space Agency, which means they're not in the European Space Agency, and I thought"
00:02:54,00:02:56,there's a sitcom.
00:02:56,00:03:02,"It's an easily deciding note, whatever our own one, our spaceship will be the shape of"
00:03:02,00:03:08,"the Italian astronauts, stereotypical Italians, so you think they're low and low style."
00:03:08,00:03:13,"Yeah, and all of the other space men are eating the tubes of paste food, and they've still got"
00:03:13,00:03:17,"spaghetti Pomodoro, and it's creating a big mess in the spaceship."
00:03:17,00:03:24,"All the Italian astronauts typically like to stay in the mothership, and his mind about"
00:03:24,00:03:27,"Marianna Ouigi, they're fixing the spaceship."
00:03:27,00:03:37,"So there's a Cassini spacecraft, did analysis for a really long time of what the wings were"
00:03:37,00:03:42,"composed of, the mostly ice, and the ice is made of water, which then of course I had a question"
00:03:42,00:03:47,"mark, what is other ice made of, they kept calling it water ice, but then I realized I've"
00:03:47,00:03:48,gone too far off the fact.
00:03:48,00:03:49,Okay.
00:03:49,00:03:50,Come back.
00:03:50,00:03:55,"One percent of them is dust, and they've measured the rate of accumulation, how dusty"
00:03:55,00:03:59,"they're getting, and then worked backwards from that one percent to say they can't be any"
00:03:59,00:04:05,"older than a hundred years, a hundred million years I should say, and they could be as new"
00:04:05,00:04:06,as ten million years old.
00:04:06,00:04:07,Wow.
00:04:07,00:04:08,Okay.
00:04:08,00:04:11,So that's from the amount of dust accumulation.
00:04:11,00:04:16,"The reason, and I'll stress this straight away, that they could be a lot older, is because"
00:04:16,00:04:20,"they could be cleaning themselves, because there's a pool from the planet, which takes a lot"
00:04:20,00:04:22,of debris away from it.
00:04:22,00:04:29,"So basically, when Micrometeroids hit the rings of Saturn, they are either vaporised or they've"
00:04:29,00:04:33,"pulled towards Saturn's magnetic field, which would explain why there would be less dust"
00:04:33,00:04:35,there than you could completely just age it.
00:04:35,00:04:39,"All the dust that's ever been collected by Saturn's pool hasn't stayed in the rings essentially,"
00:04:39,00:04:44,which is where aging them that way could be slightly contentious.
00:04:44,00:04:45,Okay.
00:04:45,00:04:46,And what about sharks?
00:04:46,00:04:50,"Okay, so sharks, they're saying they're claiming."
00:04:50,00:04:54,"I don't know what you've written down, that they are four hundred and fifty million years"
00:04:54,00:04:55,old.
00:04:55,00:04:56,"Yes, okay."
00:04:56,00:04:57,"Right, okay."
00:04:57,00:05:03,"And their evidence for this, some scales, no teeth, they've got some fossilised scales from"
00:05:03,00:05:07,"four hundred and fifty million years old, which they're saying is that earliest fossil"
00:05:07,00:05:11,"of a shark, like creature, which is not a shark, is it?"
00:05:11,00:05:13,"That's a shark, like creature."
00:05:13,00:05:14,Okay.
00:05:14,00:05:15,And then no teeth.
00:05:15,00:05:22,"So, are we thinking a gummy shark, like no teeth shark?"
00:05:22,00:05:25,"What a scary, big, scary fish, I know which one is what a shark is in lots of ways."
00:05:25,00:05:29,"But hang on Sarah, all of this, all of this smacks of a woman who submitted the fact and"
00:05:29,00:05:30,then researched it.
00:05:30,00:05:31,Yes.
00:05:31,00:05:32,Yes.
00:05:32,00:05:33,You're on that?
00:05:33,00:05:34,Okay.
00:05:34,00:05:36,"What's the accusation there, Andy?"
00:05:36,00:05:39,That's what she did what we asked her to do.
00:05:39,00:05:42,"No, because some people, it's like their actual passion, is that what you mean?"
00:05:42,00:05:43,"No, no, no."
00:05:43,00:05:46,"People are like, ""Oh, I wrote a book about that, that's really something."""
00:05:46,00:05:50,"It's funny how honest you are, but it is like it, because you know, like a lesser research"
00:05:50,00:05:53,"I might have just said, ""Yeah, I'll just sort of find that."""
00:05:53,00:05:54,I would have done that.
00:05:54,00:05:55,"Yeah, I would have done that."
00:05:55,00:05:56,And they would have done that.
00:05:56,00:05:58,"And it said, ""So, the fact is that the rings are this old and sharks are this old."""
00:05:58,00:05:59,Yes.
00:05:59,00:06:00,"And one's younger than the other, and that's it."
00:06:00,00:06:06,"No, actually, what I did write down was that Cassini spacecraft, born on the 15th"
00:06:06,00:06:07,"of October 1997, so it's a Libra."
00:06:07,00:06:08,"Oh, you love it."
00:06:08,00:06:09,"Yeah, that is good."
00:06:09,00:06:14,"Getting my astrology and astronomy all in the same way, all in the same explanation."
00:06:14,00:06:20,"So sharks have survived the five, yeah, the five known mass extinctions that we've had"
00:06:20,00:06:21,on this planet.
00:06:21,00:06:22,Are they involved somehow?
00:06:22,00:06:25,It does seem suspicious.
00:06:25,00:06:26,Yeah.
00:06:26,00:06:27,Always there.
00:06:27,00:06:28,Yeah.
00:06:28,00:06:31,I think it was after the first mass extinction that teeth suddenly became a part of their
00:06:31,00:06:32,life.
00:06:32,00:06:33,Yeah.
00:06:33,00:06:36,Although the jaws were different in those earlier creatures.
00:06:36,00:06:37,Yeah.
00:06:37,00:06:41,"So now they have jaws that open really widely, which mean they can swim faster and they"
00:06:41,00:06:43,can eat prey bigger than themselves.
00:06:43,00:06:44,So that's exciting.
00:06:44,00:06:45,But that's much more recent.
00:06:45,00:06:51,We're talking 150 million years ago with those recognizable actual sharks.
00:06:51,00:06:56,"And like 10 million to 100 million with the rings of Saturn, what are you saying as the"
00:06:56,00:06:59,closest scale than 400 plus male-scale scales?
00:06:59,00:07:01,"Okay, so here's the timeline I wrote down."
00:07:01,00:07:08,So I wrote sharks as the earliest fossil was the late Ordova vision period.
00:07:08,00:07:11,So basically that would make them older than dinosaurs and older and trees.
00:07:11,00:07:12,Really fun.
00:07:12,00:07:14,"Trees are 360 million years old, which is fun."
00:07:14,00:07:17,"Would they know anything about trees as in like they're not seeing trees anyway, right?"
00:07:17,00:07:18,Absolutely not.
00:07:18,00:07:19,So that's relevant to their world.
00:07:19,00:07:20,"Oh, damn."
00:07:20,00:07:21,You get like tree falling in there.
00:07:21,00:07:22,Absolutely.
00:07:22,00:07:23,So they might see a fall in there.
00:07:23,00:07:24,So they'll be like that.
00:07:24,00:07:25,They'll see a log.
00:07:25,00:07:26,But they can't fall before they exist.
00:07:26,00:07:27,That's the thing.
00:07:27,00:07:32,"If a tree falls before it exists, does it make a nose?"
00:07:32,00:07:33,Does it splash?
00:07:33,00:07:34,It was.
00:07:34,00:07:35,They famously got good hearing sharks.
00:07:35,00:07:37,So that would be good distances.
00:07:37,00:07:38,Or is it smell?
00:07:38,00:07:39,A smell?
00:07:39,00:07:40,Can they smell trees?
00:07:40,00:07:41,"There's a few people say, shh."
00:07:41,00:07:42,And I can't see them.
00:07:42,00:07:43,I can't see it.
00:07:43,00:07:44,I can't see it.
00:07:44,00:07:45,Don't bleed into the water.
00:07:45,00:07:50,So we've got a mass extinction event in the Permian period.
00:07:50,00:07:57,That's 252 million years ago or around then that 96% of marine life was wiped out.
00:07:57,00:08:01,So we had bigger sharks and there is fossil records just teeth of these massive sharks.
00:08:01,00:08:02,Are you saying just teeth?
00:08:02,00:08:04,"Earlier on it was like, oh, they don't even have teeth."
00:08:04,00:08:05,Exactly.
00:08:05,00:08:06,How suspicious is this?
00:08:06,00:08:11,You always find crimes and then investigate them on this show.
00:08:11,00:08:13,Do you know why they keep surviving all of these mass extinctions?
00:08:13,00:08:18,It's really interesting because they're so varied as a class of creatures.
00:08:18,00:08:21,So you get sharks that live on the bottom.
00:08:21,00:08:24,You get sharks that live in the main water column in a higher over the ocean.
00:08:24,00:08:25,You get small sharks.
00:08:25,00:08:26,You get big sharks.
00:08:26,00:08:30,You get sharks that are some sharks that are even mostly vegetarian.
00:08:30,00:08:32,You get just sharks of every different kind.
00:08:32,00:08:36,That's why always a few of them will fit through the keyhole of whatever life survives
00:08:36,00:08:37,the mass extinction event.
00:08:37,00:08:38,Which is amazing isn't it?
00:08:38,00:08:39,It did go down.
00:08:39,00:08:44,"One of my tendons was the green and shark, which grows incredibly slowly, which is a really"
00:08:44,00:08:46,good example of what you're describing.
00:08:46,00:08:49,They don't become sexually active until they're over a hundred.
00:08:49,00:08:50,Yeah.
00:08:50,00:08:51,Which is really inspiring.
00:08:51,00:08:55,Here's an amazing thing about them.
00:08:55,00:08:59,It's been estimated that they can live probably up to 500 years.
00:08:59,00:09:03,There's one that's been found that definitely is around 400 years old.
00:09:03,00:09:08,"Now the rings of Saturn, the first observation through telescope was Galileo on 1610."
00:09:08,00:09:13,Arguably there is a green and shark out there alive that was born before Galileo first looked
00:09:13,00:09:14,at them through a telescope.
00:09:14,00:09:20,I thought you were going to say that could have seen the rings of Saturn through that telescope
00:09:20,00:09:21,unless it fell into the water.
00:09:21,00:09:22,Unless they could hear it.
00:09:22,00:09:25,I think that's going to happen under you.
00:09:25,00:09:26,It's amazing isn't it?
00:09:26,00:09:27,That's mad potentially.
00:09:27,00:09:28,There's one out there that was yeah.
00:09:28,00:09:29,Yeah.
00:09:29,00:09:30,We've got the topic.
00:09:30,00:09:31,Sharks.
00:09:31,00:09:32,Yeah.
00:09:32,00:09:33,Yeah.
00:09:33,00:09:34,Give us a shark.
00:09:34,00:09:35,That's favorite shark.
00:09:35,00:09:36,I'll tell you mine.
00:09:36,00:09:37,Yeah okay.
00:09:37,00:09:38,Wow.
00:09:38,00:09:39,Let's guess.
00:09:39,00:09:40,I'm going to guess Hammerhead.
00:09:40,00:09:41,No.
00:09:41,00:09:42,James.
00:09:42,00:09:43,Hammerhead.
00:09:43,00:09:44,No.
00:09:44,00:09:45,I do like Hammerheads.
00:09:45,00:09:46,They're the youngest species.
00:09:46,00:09:47,Apparently the newest one.
00:09:47,00:09:48,Hello.
00:09:48,00:09:49,Really?
00:09:49,00:09:50,"Well, I've had another one that's been quite new."
00:09:50,00:09:54,"I think it's maybe not quite as new as Hammerheads, but the walking sharks that you get off the"
00:09:54,00:09:56,coast of Australia.
00:09:56,00:09:57,They live on the bottom.
00:09:57,00:10:00,They're one of Andy's bottom sharks.
00:10:00,00:10:01,Yeah.
00:10:01,00:10:03,But they walk on the bottom sharks.
00:10:03,00:10:10,It's my channel five series of the future.
00:10:10,00:10:13,People who want to watch a show about animals are going to be very disciplined.
00:10:13,00:10:19,It's very much an urban dictionary thing.
00:10:19,00:10:20,"No, these are like walking sharks."
00:10:20,00:10:21,Yeah.
00:10:21,00:10:24,And they use their fins and they walk like geckos on the bottom of the ocean.
00:10:24,00:10:25,Wow.
00:10:25,00:10:26,That is cool.
00:10:26,00:10:27,Can they swim?
00:10:27,00:10:29,"They can swim, yeah, but not very well."
00:10:29,00:10:30,Quite like the Thresher shark.
00:10:30,00:10:31,Oh yeah.
00:10:31,00:10:36,"But it's just, it's an odd move that they use, which is, it's been described as extreme yoga."
00:10:36,00:10:41,"Basically, if they're coming up to a fish, rather than directly eat it, they'll bring their"
00:10:41,00:10:43,tail up back around them and slap it and stun it.
00:10:43,00:10:44,Wow.
00:10:44,00:10:45,Yeah.
00:10:45,00:10:46,That's great.
00:10:46,00:10:50,"Usually a lot of them, they'll eat by opening their mouths and just swimming with their mouths"
00:10:50,00:10:52,"open and seeing what goes in there, right?"
00:10:52,00:10:53,Yeah.
00:10:53,00:10:54,And there's a big problem with that.
00:10:54,00:10:59,"A paper I read just this morning, which was that basically because of the water is more acidic"
00:10:59,00:11:01,"and the oceans now, it's rotting their teeth."
00:11:01,00:11:02,Oh.
00:11:02,00:11:06,"And so they have quite crumbly teeth now, sharks, compared to what they were 100 years ago."
00:11:06,00:11:07,Wow.
00:11:07,00:11:09,"So, later people think we didn't have any sharks."
00:11:09,00:11:10,There's no evidence.
00:11:10,00:11:11,Yes.
00:11:11,00:11:12,Yeah.
00:11:12,00:11:13,They all crumbled away.
00:11:13,00:11:14,Yeah.
00:11:14,00:11:15,Can I give you guys my favourite shark?
00:11:15,00:11:16,Yeah.
00:11:16,00:11:17,It's from this morning.
00:11:17,00:11:18,For the programme.
00:11:18,00:11:22,"For lip skull fields, it was a shark."
00:11:22,00:11:30,"No, this is a listener email from Alison Mullencamp, who sent us an email this morning on"
00:11:30,00:11:31,the day we recalled this.
00:11:31,00:11:32,Oh yeah.
00:11:32,00:11:33,"Headlined ""Ghost Shark Sex Teeth."""
00:11:33,00:11:34,Okay.
00:11:34,00:11:35,This is crazy.
00:11:35,00:11:36,And you opened it?
00:11:36,00:11:37,Oh yeah.
00:11:37,00:11:38,It's gonna be great for us.
00:11:38,00:11:39,And it's awesome sharks.
00:11:39,00:11:43,"Basically, there's a thing called a ghost shark."
00:11:43,00:11:45,It's also known as a spotted ratfish.
00:11:45,00:11:47,I suspect it prefers to go by ghost shark.
00:11:47,00:11:48,I'll take the other name back.
00:11:48,00:11:49,Yeah.
00:11:49,00:11:50,It was just so fast.
00:11:50,00:11:51,Yeah.
00:11:51,00:11:54,I'm trying to push a cool nickname on themselves.
00:11:54,00:11:55,A spotted rat?
00:11:55,00:11:56,"No, it's ghost shark actually."
00:11:56,00:11:57,Yeah.
00:11:57,00:12:00,That's what they call me at university.
00:12:00,00:12:03,"So it's not a true shark, but it looks a lot like a shark, you know, and it gets called"
00:12:03,00:12:04,it.
00:12:04,00:12:06,And it's got a thing on its forehead called the tenaculum.
00:12:06,00:12:11,"It's got these tiny protrusions on it, and scientists have just today published a paper"
00:12:11,00:12:16,about what this thing is and what it is is this little thing sticking out of its head has
00:12:16,00:12:17,these scales on it.
00:12:17,00:12:18,It turns out they're not scales.
00:12:18,00:12:19,They're actual teeth.
00:12:19,00:12:25,"They're literal teeth sticking out of its head, which it uses to grip onto the female during"
00:12:25,00:12:26,sex.
00:12:26,00:12:27,Okay.
00:12:27,00:12:28,It's got a head hand.
00:12:28,00:12:31,"It's got a head hand, which it uses for sex grips."
00:12:31,00:12:32,And it's just a whole lot of fish.
00:12:32,00:12:34,Does the female have one on her head to hit the other?
00:12:34,00:12:35,"No, I don't think so."
00:12:35,00:12:36,"Guys, well, away."
00:12:36,00:12:37,She has nothing.
00:12:37,00:12:38,Just a ponytail.
00:12:38,00:12:39,I think she's one.
00:12:39,00:12:41,Yeah.
00:12:41,00:12:45,"And so one of the scientists responsible, Carly Cohen said, ""This feature flips the long-standing"
00:12:45,00:12:49,"assumption in evolutionary biology that teeth are strictly oral structures."""
00:12:49,00:12:50,And they...
00:12:50,00:12:52,"I thought that their skin was teeth as well, though."
00:12:52,00:12:53,I thought that definitely...
00:12:53,00:12:54,I think it's shaped like teeth.
00:12:54,00:12:59,"But I think that teeth evolved from the skin, so it was scales around them, I've got"
00:12:59,00:13:00,harder and harder.
00:13:00,00:13:01,Which seems to be the same as this other idea.
00:13:01,00:13:02,It's just utilising.
00:13:02,00:13:04,"Oh, they're also good for this."
00:13:04,00:13:09,"Imagine Sabrina Carpenter's album cover, because it was really sort of anti-it, and"
00:13:09,00:13:10,it's been done before we've moved positive.
00:13:10,00:13:12,Imagine if it had been this ghost shot.
00:13:12,00:13:15,She's sort of on her knees with...
00:13:15,00:13:16,Yeah.
00:13:16,00:13:18,"But she's sort of being held by, you know, looking up at her..."
00:13:18,00:13:19,But I think next album.
00:13:19,00:13:20,"Yeah, next one."
00:13:20,00:13:21,"That's true, actually."
00:13:21,00:13:22,Or maybe Chapel Roan.
00:13:22,00:13:26,I'm sort of imagining your TV program.
00:13:26,00:13:29,"I've imagined lots of the dancers at the beginning, because it's got this like Euro-Trash"
00:13:29,00:13:30,feel.
00:13:30,00:13:34,"And they've all got like big, big, sharp heads, and then they're all wearing chaps."
00:13:34,00:13:37,"So when they turn around, they turn around and you can see their bottoms."
00:13:37,00:13:40,Do you remember that Super Bowl when they had the Dancing Shark?
00:13:40,00:13:41,Yes.
00:13:41,00:13:42,"Like that, but a bit sexier."
00:13:42,00:13:43,Yeah.
00:13:43,00:13:44,Okay.
00:13:44,00:13:45,Chat that with Chapsong.
00:13:45,00:13:46,Yeah.
00:13:46,00:13:47,And is it just me enjoying these dances?
00:13:47,00:13:51,"I mean, you just speak to camera at the beginning like, ""Hi, I'm Andy, and here every"
00:13:51,00:13:53,"week is sharp quick."""
00:13:53,00:13:57,And then it's just like a fancy castle and stuff like that.
00:13:57,00:13:58,I'll do it.
00:13:58,00:13:59,Yeah.
00:13:59,00:14:00,I will take that job.
00:14:00,00:14:01,Okay.
00:14:01,00:14:09,"It is time for fact number two, and that is my fact."
00:14:09,00:14:13,My fact this week is that because he didn't like the name of the novel that he was adapting
00:14:13,00:14:18,"into a movie, director Ridley Scott bought the film rights to a William Burrers novel called"
00:14:18,00:14:22,"Blade Runner, just so he could steal that title instead."
00:14:22,00:14:23,Nice.
00:14:23,00:14:24,Brilliant.
00:14:24,00:14:25,Yeah.
00:14:25,00:14:26,Really good.
00:14:26,00:14:27,Yeah.
00:14:27,00:14:28,It's quite fascinating.
00:14:28,00:14:30,"So I've just read Do Android's Dream of Electric Sheep, which is a book by Philip K."
00:14:30,00:14:31,It's a great title.
00:14:31,00:14:32,It's a great title.
00:14:32,00:14:33,It's a great title.
00:14:33,00:14:34,It's a solid one.
00:14:34,00:14:35,That's right.
00:14:35,00:14:38,It's a commercial title for a movie.
00:14:38,00:14:42,"If you don't know Philip K. Dick, he was a pretty extraordinary sci-fi writer."
00:14:42,00:14:47,"He was writing in the '50s and '60s, and he has had so many of his books that have gone"
00:14:47,00:14:48,to the big screen.
00:14:48,00:14:51,"So you might have seen Total Recall with Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Adjustment Bureau"
00:14:51,00:14:55,"Minority Reporter Scanner, Darkly, and Blade Runner, probably the most famous of all"
00:14:55,00:14:58,"of those, starring Harris and Ford."
00:14:58,00:15:04,"And so initially Ridley Scott was brought on to this project, and there was a screenwriter"
00:15:04,00:15:08,"on it called Hampton Fancher, and Hampton Fancher decided that while he was writing it, he"
00:15:08,00:15:13,"would put in the draft the name Blade Runner, which he'd seen from another book."
00:15:13,00:15:14,And it was just there.
00:15:14,00:15:19,"And Ridley Scott, who took on the project, started reading Do Android's Dream of Electric Sheep,"
00:15:19,00:15:20,but didn't like it.
00:15:20,00:15:21,So put it down.
00:15:21,00:15:24,So he didn't end up even reading the book he made into a movie.
00:15:24,00:15:28,"He saw that title on the screenplay and said, ""This is way better."
00:15:28,00:15:29,"Let's use that."""
00:15:29,00:15:31,But obviously it was connected to another book.
00:15:31,00:15:34,So he literally bought the movie rights to that and used nothing but the title.
00:15:34,00:15:35,So can I ask a question?
00:15:35,00:15:36,Yeah.
00:15:36,00:15:37,You said it was by William Burroughs.
00:15:37,00:15:38,Mm-hmm.
00:15:38,00:15:39,VG.
00:15:39,00:15:40,Yeah.
00:15:40,00:15:41,But he didn't write the original.
00:15:41,00:15:42,So what's going on there?
00:15:42,00:15:43,"So, okay."
00:15:43,00:15:44,So this is so weird.
00:15:44,00:15:45,Yeah.
00:15:45,00:15:46,It just gets so complicated.
00:15:46,00:15:50,"The story, the book that William Burroughs had written was called Blade Runner, the"
00:15:50,00:15:51,movie.
00:15:51,00:15:56,So William Burroughs had read a different book by a guy called Alan E. Norse and that was
00:15:56,00:15:59,called The Blade Runner.
00:15:59,00:16:04,And so Burroughs' book was a treatment for a movie that he wanted to have made.
00:16:04,00:16:08,But was his book based on Norse's book or is there a difference?
00:16:08,00:16:09,"Yeah, it was."
00:16:09,00:16:10,It was.
00:16:10,00:16:11,It was basically a movie treatment.
00:16:11,00:16:16,"So Norse's book was, the reason it's called Blade Runner is because it's about a guy"
00:16:16,00:16:18,who takes medical supplies across America.
00:16:18,00:16:21,"So literally, scalpals and smuggling them."
00:16:21,00:16:26,"Yeah, because it's basically an anti-NHS book, isn't it?"
00:16:26,00:16:30,"Basically in America, if you've got money, you can't pay for your own healthcare."
00:16:30,00:16:34,You have to only go for the government thing and the government thing isn't very good.
00:16:34,00:16:39,"And so you have these sort of dodgy private doctors who will do your stuff for you, but they"
00:16:39,00:16:40,need the scalpals.
00:16:40,00:16:42,So they need the Blade Runner.
00:16:42,00:16:45,And the main protagonist in that book is called Billy Gimp.
00:16:45,00:16:49,It's just a good character name.
00:16:49,00:16:50,It's a great name.
00:16:50,00:16:51,"It's hard to think of names for the characters, isn't it?"
00:16:51,00:16:52,Absolutely.
00:16:52,00:16:53,You've got to say what you see.
00:16:53,00:16:54,Look around you.
00:16:54,00:16:55,Whatever you see first.
00:16:55,00:16:58,"So the thing we've all glossed over, there have been a lot of names flying about."
00:16:58,00:17:02,"Hampton, Fancher, Ridley Scott, none of them very likely, right?"
00:17:02,00:17:08,"The original book that used the title Blade Runner was by this guy, Alan Norse, I pronounce"
00:17:08,00:17:11,"it Nurse, and he was a trained doctor."
00:17:11,00:17:12,"Oh, lovely."
00:17:12,00:17:15,And do you remember there was a scientist about 20 years ago?
00:17:15,00:17:16,He won the Nobel Prize for Medicine.
00:17:16,00:17:17,Paul Nurse.
00:17:17,00:17:18,Paul Nurse.
00:17:18,00:17:19,Paul Nurse.
00:17:19,00:17:20,What's all these doctors called Nurse?
00:17:20,00:17:23,"I have tried to find a nurse whose name was Doctor, but I haven't succeeded yet."
00:17:23,00:17:25,But I'll keep looking.
00:17:25,00:17:27,"He wrote to the name Doctor Rex, didn't he?"
00:17:27,00:17:28,"I did, he."
00:17:28,00:17:29,"Yeah, yeah."
00:17:29,00:17:32,He didn't really use his name because he didn't want people to know he was writing.
00:17:32,00:17:33,Taffer.
00:17:33,00:17:34,Yeah.
00:17:34,00:17:39,"Doctor Rex, but he mostly wrote abusive 140 character messages."
00:17:39,00:17:42,"So Blade Runner, I actually bought it the other night to watch."
00:17:42,00:17:43,We'll film.
00:17:43,00:17:45,"Yeah, because I haven't seen it in years."
00:17:45,00:17:48,So this is the other fascinating thing about the movie Blade Runner.
00:17:48,00:17:52,"There's been, since its release, seven different versions of it that have come out."
00:17:52,00:17:57,"It's constantly being revised by the director and by the production companies, so there was"
00:17:57,00:18:00,"a director's cut that came out, which actually wasn't a director's cut because someone else"
00:18:00,00:18:01,put it together.
00:18:01,00:18:05,"Ridley Scott just gave an approval, but the official one, according to Ridley Scott, is"
00:18:05,00:18:07,"the final cut, which doesn't have the narration."
00:18:07,00:18:08,The 25th year anniversary one.
00:18:08,00:18:13,It's the only one that he was allowed to do the cut that he actually wanted.
00:18:13,00:18:17,"And also, the story of it's quite interesting in that, so it was made by about 30 million"
00:18:17,00:18:18,dollars.
00:18:18,00:18:21,"And it made about 40 million dollars at the cinema, so it did fine."
00:18:21,00:18:22,It didn't do that well.
00:18:22,00:18:24,"But when they re-edited it, it was amazing."
00:18:24,00:18:26,And it was the first thing they brought out on DVD.
00:18:26,00:18:27,I was there.
00:18:27,00:18:30,And then it did so much better with a sort of slight re-editing.
00:18:30,00:18:31,"Ah, it was me."
00:18:31,00:18:35,"Yes, it wasn't popular at first, and it got some really bad reviews."
00:18:35,00:18:39,"One of the reviews said Blade Runner is a suspenseless thriller, which I think is"
00:18:39,00:18:40,to a certain extent true.
00:18:40,00:18:41,It was sort of slow.
00:18:41,00:18:43,Was it intentionally slow?
00:18:43,00:18:44,It is quite slow.
00:18:44,00:18:47,"For anyone who hasn't seen it, it's about Harrison Ford who has to chase down a load of robots"
00:18:47,00:18:49,who are running around dressed up as humans.
00:18:49,00:18:50,And he's a clear name.
00:18:50,00:18:54,"The main point of it, and the main point of Dick I think, and I haven't read that or seen"
00:18:54,00:18:55,the movie.
00:18:55,00:18:59,"I think it's like, can an android tell if they're human, and if so, how do you tell it?"
00:18:59,00:19:05,"Well, this is the Boyd Kempft test, which I've got the questions of if you want me to"
00:19:05,00:19:06,test your robots.
00:19:06,00:19:07,Have you?
00:19:07,00:19:08,I was like a personality test to see if we're robots.
00:19:08,00:19:09,I don't need the test.
00:19:09,00:19:10,I'm well aware.
00:19:10,00:19:13,But make a lot of sense of a lot of things in your life.
00:19:13,00:19:17,"In the book itself, do you know what they're called or these replicants?"
00:19:17,00:19:18,I thought they were called replicants.
00:19:18,00:19:19,That's in the movies.
00:19:19,00:19:21,"Yeah, in the book they're called Andy's."
00:19:21,00:19:22,Love it.
00:19:22,00:19:23,The plot sickens.
00:19:23,00:19:24,Stop fighting crime.
00:19:24,00:19:25,So here we go.
00:19:25,00:19:33,So some of them actually sort of a little bit upsetting.
00:19:33,00:19:39,"You have a little boy, and he shows you his butterfly collection, including his killing"
00:19:39,00:19:40,jar.
00:19:40,00:19:41,"Oh, dear."
00:19:41,00:19:42,Yeah.
00:19:42,00:19:45,"So, I mean, it doesn't have a question mark on it, but I guess it's testing."
00:19:45,00:19:47,Do you have an emotional reaction to that?
00:19:47,00:19:48,Okay.
00:19:48,00:19:49,Here you go.
00:19:49,00:19:50,We can all go round.
00:19:50,00:19:54,Describe in single words only the good things that come into your mind about your mother.
00:19:54,00:19:55,Killingjar.
00:19:55,00:19:57,Single words.
00:19:57,00:19:58,Fun.
00:19:58,00:19:59,Sexy.
00:19:59,00:20:06,"I'd also like to enter the word ""sexy"" for don't much."
00:20:06,00:20:12,"I think when Freud says you get full marks, so this one, my brief case, nice, isn't it?"
00:20:12,00:20:17,"Department issue, baby hide, 100% genuine human baby hide."
00:20:17,00:20:18,Okay.
00:20:18,00:20:19,"So I guess, yeah, it's supposed to make you fit."
00:20:19,00:20:22,"So if you're upset about that, you're probably human."
00:20:22,00:20:23,Yeah.
00:20:23,00:20:24,I have a strong reaction.
00:20:24,00:20:25,You don't just take it on face value.
00:20:25,00:20:27,You have an emotional reaction.
00:20:27,00:20:28,I think that's the test.
00:20:28,00:20:33,"And in the movie and in the book, they have a machine that specifically is looking directly"
00:20:33,00:20:34,into your eyeball.
00:20:34,00:20:35,So it's the dilation of the piece?
00:20:35,00:20:36,Exactly.
00:20:36,00:20:38,The question is answered by your body.
00:20:38,00:20:39,I see.
00:20:39,00:20:40,Yeah.
00:20:40,00:20:41,Exactly.
00:20:41,00:20:43,It is a good film and it is a good book.
00:20:43,00:20:44,"It looks great, yeah."
00:20:44,00:20:45,Yeah.
00:20:45,00:20:47,But I think they are quite ponderous.
00:20:47,00:20:49,Come at me in the comments if you disagree.
00:20:49,00:20:53,"What's the film you like, then, that you prefer in this sort of genre?"
00:20:53,00:20:56,He likes Pacific Rim.
00:20:56,00:20:57,What's Pacific Rim?
00:20:57,00:21:01,"Well, big monsters have started coming up through the cracks in the ocean floor from"
00:21:01,00:21:02,another dimension.
00:21:02,00:21:03,We've got to build giant robots to fight them.
00:21:03,00:21:04,Wow.
00:21:04,00:21:06,Exciting at the side of Andy's bottom.
00:21:06,00:21:11,"Oh, I'm saying this in that in Pacific Rim, everyone knows who isn't a robot and we can crack"
00:21:11,00:21:14,"on with the real meat in the film, which is beating the monsters, the Kaiju."
00:21:14,00:21:15,"Oh, I see."
00:21:15,00:21:16,Do you see what I mean?
00:21:16,00:21:17,Yes.
00:21:17,00:21:20,Harrison Ford isn't interrogating the robots because you don't like subtlety.
00:21:20,00:21:22,I'm saying I like Obviousness.
00:21:22,00:21:25,There was one of the reviews of Blade Runner when it came out that said some of the scenes
00:21:25,00:21:31,"seem to have six subtexts, but no text and no context either."
00:21:31,00:21:32,Wow.
00:21:32,00:21:36,I think it's so interesting because the questions that they were asking then about what are the
00:21:36,00:21:41,"capabilities of these machines that are working alongside us, are the questions that we are"
00:21:41,00:21:42,continuing to ask.
00:21:42,00:21:44,The only thing that's changed is the technology.
00:21:44,00:21:46,"We're still asking those same things, aren't we?"
00:21:46,00:21:50,"Really, when I read it, it's incredibly poignant for what's going on right now in the world"
00:21:50,00:21:51,"of AI, because extraordinary."
00:21:51,00:21:54,I guess that's the thing of a good sci-fi writer like Philip K. Dick.
00:21:54,00:21:58,"It's looking forward and seeing the problems we might run into, but it's also worth saying"
00:21:58,00:22:00,the book is incredibly different from the movie.
00:22:00,00:22:05,"So there's an idea that you're asking the question, is Harrison Ford a replicant himself?"
00:22:05,00:22:06,Yeah.
00:22:06,00:22:07,"Harrison Ford said he wasn't, Ridley Scott said he was."
00:22:07,00:22:11,So we don't even know from the filmmakers side which one is which.
00:22:11,00:22:13,Which one of those two people wrote the...
00:22:13,00:22:14,Neither.
00:22:14,00:22:16,We need to ask the person who wrote the script.
00:22:16,00:22:17,"Yes, exactly."
00:22:17,00:22:18,Paul Hampton fan.
00:22:18,00:22:19,Yeah.
00:22:19,00:22:25,Quite clearly a robot panicking to try to think of a human name.
00:22:25,00:22:27,Have you guys seen the movie Taking Tiger Mountain?
00:22:27,00:22:28,"No, what happens in that?"
00:22:28,00:22:29,I think so.
00:22:29,00:22:33,"What happens in that is what happens in the Blade Runner, the original book, because it eventually"
00:22:33,00:22:35,was adapted into a movie.
00:22:35,00:22:37,And that was starring Bill Paxton.
00:22:37,00:22:44,"So the novel that William Burrow's wrote, Blade Runner brackets a movie, was off the back"
00:22:44,00:22:48,"of the original Alan Norse novel, Blade Runner."
00:22:48,00:22:49,Yeah.
00:22:49,00:22:52,And it was a pitch for it to be a screenplay and then he realised it probably wasn't going
00:22:52,00:22:53,to be adapted.
00:22:53,00:22:57,"So he turned it, Burrow's turned his work into a novella."
00:22:57,00:23:02,"What that means is that he wrote the novel of the pitch, of the film, of the novel."
00:23:02,00:23:03,Oh.
00:23:03,00:23:04,Interesting.
00:23:04,00:23:10,"And then Philip K. Dick was asked to write the novel of the movie, Blade Runner, yes."
00:23:10,00:23:12,Of the book that he wrote.
00:23:12,00:23:13,Of his own book.
00:23:13,00:23:14,Yeah.
00:23:14,00:23:17,"But he refused brilliant because he thought that if he did that, people would stop buying"
00:23:17,00:23:18,his book.
00:23:18,00:23:19,Yeah.
00:23:19,00:23:20,When that been amazing.
00:23:20,00:23:21,It's so weird.
00:23:21,00:23:22,It's so strange.
00:23:22,00:23:23,It's just the whole...
00:23:23,00:23:26,"I mean, this is probably the most confusing section we've ever done for an audience."
00:23:26,00:23:27,We're trying to piece these together.
00:23:27,00:23:30,"We need a big wall chart, don't we, with lines."
00:23:30,00:23:35,"Even that movie that I just mentioned, taking Tiger Mountain, which was the adaption of"
00:23:35,00:23:37,the Blade Runner original book.
00:23:37,00:23:38,Pre-Burrow's.
00:23:38,00:23:39,Yeah.
00:23:39,00:23:45,"There was a movie that was made, which was based on a art film by Albert Camus, his book"
00:23:45,00:23:47,called The Stranger.
00:23:47,00:23:49,"They filmed the whole thing, but they didn't do any dialogue for it because they thought"
00:23:49,00:23:51,they'd do that post.
00:23:51,00:23:56,"A new director came in, used all that stuff, but applied the Blade Runner."
00:23:56,00:23:57,No.
00:23:57,00:23:58,Who it?
00:23:58,00:24:01,"Well, you think of the editor, please, while you're saying these facts."
00:24:01,00:24:02,It's so confusing.
00:24:02,00:24:08,"What's going to happen, James, is this section of the podcast, in years to come, there are"
00:24:08,00:24:11,going to be seven or eight different cuts of this section of the podcast.
00:24:11,00:24:13,"They'll be the harking cut, sure."
00:24:13,00:24:15,But they'll be the Shriver Cut.
00:24:15,00:24:20,"But people, people quite often listen to podcasts to fall asleep, and this bit, they'll"
00:24:20,00:24:24,"think, is there subconscious, chopping it into different pieces and making it confusing,"
00:24:24,00:24:25,so they're not really listening properly.
00:24:25,00:24:29,"That sort of makes you think, we must have enough stuff filmed by now that we can basically"
00:24:29,00:24:30,make everything new.
00:24:30,00:24:31,Let's just use our existing stuff.
00:24:31,00:24:36,"In the future, they're going to say, do you know the famous TV show and these bottom"
00:24:36,00:24:40,sharks was actually based on a podcast?
00:24:40,00:24:42,Yeah.
00:24:42,00:24:45,"And bizarrely, Andy, what you just said, with having extra footage that we can just reuse,"
00:24:45,00:24:49,"that actually happened for Blade Runner the movie itself, because in the final scenes,"
00:24:49,00:24:54,"they used shots from the shining that weren't used in the main movie, and included it"
00:24:54,00:24:57,as sort of background shots.
00:24:57,00:24:59,So the shining is in the Blade Runner movie.
00:24:59,00:25:00,Bloody hell.
00:25:00,00:25:01,Yeah.
00:25:01,00:25:02,"It goes deep, doesn't it?"
00:25:02,00:25:03,It really does go deep.
00:25:03,00:25:08,"Isn't it true that the Alien World, the Blade Runner World, are one world together?"
00:25:08,00:25:11,"I was hoping this, but I haven't, she's watched them all and I haven't."
00:25:11,00:25:12,Interesting.
00:25:12,00:25:17,"But I think there's like one mention in the second Alien that says, yes, they're definitely"
00:25:17,00:25:18,the same world.
00:25:18,00:25:19,That's terrific.
00:25:19,00:25:22,"Because it might be things like the same company operating across the, because in Alien,"
00:25:22,00:25:24,"the whole thing is the wayland, you tiny corporation."
00:25:24,00:25:27,"And that might get a mention and played it out, I don't know."
00:25:27,00:25:28,That's brilliant.
00:25:28,00:25:34,"Can I tell you a thing about William Burrows, the author who wrote, one of these, one of these"
00:25:34,00:25:35,things.
00:25:35,00:25:36,Yeah.
00:25:36,00:25:39,"So he was a big generation writer, a very interesting person."
00:25:39,00:25:41,I didn't really know anything about him.
00:25:41,00:25:45,"The only thing I'd vaguely heard of, which is the awful thing in his life, which is that"
00:25:45,00:25:48,"he and his wife once had taken a huge amount of drugs, and he tried to do a William"
00:25:48,00:25:53,"tell act shooting something off her head, and he missed and he shot her and he killed her."
00:25:53,00:25:55,I think that's his version.
00:25:55,00:25:58,He was a really strange guy.
00:25:58,00:26:00,He was very eccentric.
00:26:00,00:26:02,"He was on, huge numbers of drugs his whole life."
00:26:02,00:26:07,He said that he could just stare at his shoes for eight hours a day and frequently did.
00:26:07,00:26:11,"But do you know how Burrows had this lifestyle and was able to just sort of, so where his money"
00:26:11,00:26:12,came from?
00:26:12,00:26:13,Yeah.
00:26:13,00:26:14,Rich parents.
00:26:14,00:26:17,He got an allowance from his parents until he was nearly 50.
00:26:17,00:26:18,Right.
00:26:18,00:26:23,"And what he got an allowance from his parents until he was nearly 50 is that his grandfather,"
00:26:23,00:26:27,"William Seward Burrows, the first, our William Burrows was the second."
00:26:27,00:26:30,He had invented the Burrows Adding Machine.
00:26:30,00:26:35,It was a calculator and pretty much every business in America bought one of these adding
00:26:35,00:26:36,machines.
00:26:36,00:26:37,It was incredibly useful.
00:26:37,00:26:40,"Is it one of those ones that you see in old movies where they can, it's like a big calculator"
00:26:40,00:26:43,"and they go, ""Pah, pah, pah, pah, pah, pah, pah, pah, pah, pah, pah."""
00:26:43,00:26:44,Pretty much.
00:26:44,00:26:45,And it prints out.
00:26:45,00:26:46,"It prints out a real, yeah."
00:26:46,00:26:47,Exactly.
00:26:47,00:26:52,And it's the biggest American computing companies in the 50s and 60s.
00:26:52,00:26:53,And what is this?
00:26:53,00:26:55,"It's a robot, a thinking machine."
00:26:55,00:26:56,"Oh, I see."
00:26:56,00:27:01,"And it's, it sort of allows blade runner to, right?"
00:27:01,00:27:02,Yeah.
00:27:02,00:27:03,Yeah.
00:27:03,00:27:04,Yeah.
00:27:04,00:27:05,Okay.
00:27:05,00:27:06,Sure.
00:27:06,00:27:07,So Philip K. Dick took words of drugs as well.
00:27:07,00:27:08,Yeah.
00:27:08,00:27:09,He was into the same things.
00:27:09,00:27:12,"And apparently, in his life, he sort of saw like a rosy mist and all these kind of, he"
00:27:12,00:27:15,"had, he had, in his final period of his life, it was in 1974."
00:27:15,00:27:21,He saw a fish symbol and necklace on a woman glow red.
00:27:21,00:27:25,And he felt information suddenly just was transmitted to him.
00:27:25,00:27:27,And he believed that it was from an alien species.
00:27:27,00:27:28,Yeah.
00:27:28,00:27:31,That's why I'm an excuse when you're staring at a woman's dress.
00:27:31,00:27:32,Yeah.
00:27:32,00:27:33,Sorry.
00:27:33,00:27:34,There's information coming.
00:27:34,00:27:35,Yeah.
00:27:35,00:27:42,Okay.
00:27:42,00:27:43,It is time for fact number three.
00:27:43,00:27:44,And that is James.
00:27:44,00:27:48,Because that most people wouldn't wear a sweater owned by Hitler.
00:27:48,00:27:53,But they might if Mother Teresa wore it for long enough in between.
00:27:53,00:27:55,So has she won this in like an eBay auction?
00:27:55,00:27:57,Like how did she get her hands on this?
00:27:57,00:27:58,She's bought it.
00:27:58,00:27:59,Yeah.
00:27:59,00:28:01,Did she dry clean it after Hitler?
00:28:01,00:28:02,Has anyone cleaned it ever?
00:28:02,00:28:09,"Well, this is a study called the contagion concept in adult thinking in the United States"
00:28:09,00:28:12,by Carol Nemeroff and Paul Rosen.
00:28:12,00:28:15,And there's lots of different things that they did with this imaginary jumper.
00:28:15,00:28:18,So they had different people wear it.
00:28:18,00:28:22,"So it might be Hitler, but it might be a lover of the person you're interviewing or it"
00:28:22,00:28:29,might be someone they really admire or it might be that they rub it in dog poo or various
00:28:29,00:28:30,different things.
00:28:30,00:28:31,Yeah.
00:28:31,00:28:38,And then they try and ameliorate the effect by giving it to a nice person or they might
00:28:38,00:28:43,clean it with detergent or just with water or boil it or deodorize it.
00:28:43,00:28:44,This is all imaginary.
00:28:44,00:28:45,This is all made up.
00:28:45,00:28:46,Okay.
00:28:46,00:28:47,And did they ever show you a picture of the jumper?
00:28:47,00:28:48,Yeah.
00:28:48,00:28:49,Or have you imagined it?
00:28:49,00:28:50,You imagine it.
00:28:50,00:28:56,"It's simply a question of, would you wear this jumper if this had happened to it?"
00:28:56,00:29:00,And then they took all of the different results of what everyone said and then generalised
00:29:00,00:29:02,to the entire world.
00:29:02,00:29:06,"So, but actually they generalised to people in the US and the reason being that there's"
00:29:06,00:29:11,"this kind of thing called the Law of Contagion, which is a folk belief that you get all around"
00:29:11,00:29:16,"the world where if you've been in contact with an object, then people think some of your"
00:29:16,00:29:18,attributes go into that object.
00:29:18,00:29:24,"It happens in Papua New Guinea, it happens in Africa, it happens in medieval Europe, you"
00:29:24,00:29:28,"get it quite a lot of, but this study was to see if it happened in the US as well."
00:29:28,00:29:32,And what they found is the basics is that people would not wear anything that was worn
00:29:32,00:29:39,"by Hitler, but they might wear it if someone good like Mother Teresa or someone sexy had"
00:29:39,00:29:41,worn it in between.
00:29:41,00:29:42,And they would probably...
00:29:42,00:29:45,"What are we saying Mother Teresa is not sexy, that's what we mean."
00:29:45,00:29:48,She looks so much like Dan Sommar.
00:29:48,00:29:54,"Yeah, so Princess Diana, someone else who's sort of seeing this go into the US."
00:29:54,00:29:55,"Sure, absolutely."
00:29:55,00:29:56,Yeah.
00:29:56,00:29:59,"Because at the start they interview people and said, ""Who do you think is good?"
00:29:59,00:30:00,Who do you think is sexy?
00:30:00,00:30:01,"Who do you think is trustworthy?"""
00:30:01,00:30:07,"And with the sort of washing and stuff like that, basically, if you wash it or if you deodorise"
00:30:07,00:30:14,"it or if you air it out, people are slightly more likely to wear it, but if you boil it, then"
00:30:14,00:30:16,they're really more likely to do so.
00:30:16,00:30:20,"If you get Hitler's jumper and you give it a good old, very hot wash, then people are"
00:30:20,00:30:22,more likely to wear it after that.
00:30:22,00:30:23,I think though.
00:30:23,00:30:24,"Yeah, this will."
00:30:24,00:30:25,Is it wool?
00:30:25,00:30:26,Yeah.
00:30:26,00:30:31,Because I did try to find evidence of any of Hitler's jumpers going up for auction.
00:30:31,00:30:32,Yeah.
00:30:32,00:30:33,Yeah.
00:30:33,00:30:34,He doesn't seem to have been a big jumper guy.
00:30:34,00:30:35,No.
00:30:35,00:30:36,No.
00:30:36,00:30:37,"There's very little whose jacket, wasn't he?"
00:30:37,00:30:38,Who's more jacket?
00:30:38,00:30:39,"Well, one of his jackets did."
00:30:39,00:30:46,"In 2016, there was a buyer who spent £600,000 at a single auction on Nazi memorabilia, including"
00:30:46,00:30:51,things like the brass canister that contained the hydrogen cyanide that Gurri killed himself
00:30:51,00:30:52,with.
00:30:52,00:30:53,Wow.
00:30:53,00:30:56,"I mean, quite abstract and quite gory stuff, but one of the things was £210,000 on Hitler's"
00:30:56,00:30:57,jacket.
00:30:57,00:30:58,Right.
00:30:58,00:31:01,"This man from Argentina, who declined to give his name."
00:31:01,00:31:03,"That's a joke, isn't it?"
00:31:03,00:31:04,No.
00:31:04,00:31:05,What?
00:31:05,00:31:06,No.
00:31:06,00:31:07,"He said, I'm not going to tell you my name."
00:31:07,00:31:08,I am from Argentina.
00:31:08,00:31:09,"Oh, my goodness."
00:31:09,00:31:10,I know.
00:31:10,00:31:12,So we can only speculate.
00:31:12,00:31:13,Yeah.
00:31:13,00:31:14,Crakey.
00:31:14,00:31:15,There was a thing.
00:31:15,00:31:16,"This guy, Paul Rosen."
00:31:16,00:31:17,Paul Rosen.
00:31:17,00:31:18,Yeah.
00:31:18,00:31:22,Very interesting character because he's sort of known as the leading authority on disgustingness.
00:31:22,00:31:25,He spends his life studying disgusting stuff.
00:31:25,00:31:32,"And he was saying, if you were put off by the idea of Hitler, to what level would that bleed"
00:31:32,00:31:33,into your life?
00:31:33,00:31:37,"Because, for example, any glass of water that you drink in Europe will contain a few molecules"
00:31:37,00:31:39,that would have passed through Hitler.
00:31:39,00:31:45,"And so, if you found that out, does that put you off drinking like to what level are you"
00:31:45,00:31:46,wanting an association?
00:31:46,00:31:50,"And that's why I have my water ship, Den, from Argentina."
00:31:50,00:31:57,"Yeah, no, you're right. I mean, if you did it, sorry, just to ask."
00:31:57,00:31:58,"No, I think I know."
00:31:58,00:32:00,"No, no, I'm not sure that he's put that to the study yet."
00:32:00,00:32:04,He was sort of talking about the extremes of where you could take the associations with Hitler
00:32:04,00:32:05,as a contagion.
00:32:05,00:32:07,"And this one's done a few years ago, wasn't it the study genes?"
00:32:07,00:32:08,1994.
00:32:08,00:32:11,"Yeah, yeah, so I mean, I don't know how Hitler's reputation has been in America over the last"
00:32:11,00:32:12,few years.
00:32:12,00:32:13,But how fashion has changed?
00:32:13,00:32:14,"Yeah, fashion has changed."
00:32:14,00:32:15,How fashion has changed.
00:32:15,00:32:16,You have a fashion of the same.
00:32:16,00:32:17,You have a fashion of the same.
00:32:17,00:32:18,You have a fashion of the same.
00:32:18,00:32:19,You have a fashion of the same.
00:32:19,00:32:24,"That out, I'm sorry, but she and Adolf did not have the same characteristics."
00:32:24,00:32:27,And so this is relevant in real life.
00:32:27,00:32:28,It's not just that many things.
00:32:28,00:32:32,"So things like drinking water, so you mentioned the Hitler water thing, Den."
00:32:32,00:32:33,Yeah.
00:32:33,00:32:38,"So Hitler never went to Singapore, but Singapore, as far as I know, I mean, his allies"
00:32:38,00:32:39,got there.
00:32:39,00:32:40,Never mind.
00:32:40,00:32:46,"Point is, Singapore purifies water from sewage water, right?"
00:32:46,00:32:47,And people drink it and it's fine.
00:32:47,00:32:49,"I mean, it's absolutely fine, this water."
00:32:49,00:32:51,It has been treated.
00:32:51,00:32:55,"It doesn't contain any contaminants, anything that you make you will."
00:32:55,00:32:56,It is clean water.
00:32:56,00:32:59,"But in lots of other places around the world, places which don't have like the space constraints"
00:32:59,00:33:02,"of Singapore, people object massively to this."
00:33:02,00:33:05,And it's to do with this contagion theory.
00:33:05,00:33:08,So that is relevant to how we don't know the idea of it.
00:33:08,00:33:09,It's the idea.
00:33:09,00:33:11,"I mean, water effectively has been boiled."
00:33:11,00:33:12,Yes.
00:33:12,00:33:16,But our brains are just never going to keep up with something that high concept.
00:33:16,00:33:20,"We're always going to add one and one together and go, that's the sewage."
00:33:20,00:33:21,Yeah.
00:33:21,00:33:22,"Still, yeah."
00:33:22,00:33:24,What if Hitler's jumper was turned into a scarf?
00:33:24,00:33:26,Obviously unravelled all the wall and made something different.
00:33:26,00:33:27,Yeah.
00:33:27,00:33:28,"Well, does that make a big difference?"
00:33:28,00:33:30,It makes a little bit of a difference.
00:33:30,00:33:36,"So they asked people if it had been re-knitted, gashed, unravelled, cut up and burned."
00:33:36,00:33:38,Would you wear it afterwards?
00:33:38,00:33:40,And burning had the best effects.
00:33:40,00:33:42,Although it's not going to look like a burnt gem.
00:33:42,00:33:47,"Yeah. If it's re-knitted, some people are more likely to a little bit, but burning and"
00:33:47,00:33:52,"boiling seems to be, people will forgive any ice revolving if you do that."
00:33:52,00:33:57,"And the area of this eye-found interesting and discussed, is discussed in a rousal."
00:33:57,00:33:58,Okay.
00:33:58,00:33:59,Did you look into that?
00:33:59,00:34:00,No.
00:34:00,00:34:01,No.
00:34:01,00:34:02,Andy.
00:34:02,00:34:03,Too busy living it.
00:34:03,00:34:04,What?
00:34:04,00:34:05,I don't know what that means.
00:34:05,00:34:08,"Well, it is really, really, really interesting in human psychology."
00:34:08,00:34:12,So it's a bi-directional psychology.
00:34:12,00:34:13,Okay.
00:34:13,00:34:16,"So the two things co-exist, discussed in a rousal."
00:34:16,00:34:22,I knew about this because I had read probably in Mary Roach's book Bonk about the fact that when
00:34:22,00:34:28,"women are aroused, they will do things that they consider disgusting when they're unaroused."
00:34:28,00:34:33,And that just makes such basic sense for evolution in that section.
00:34:33,00:34:37,"What would say, would you mean, like, if I got my wife aroused?"
00:34:37,00:34:38,Yeah.
00:34:38,00:34:39,"And then I suddenly say, great."
00:34:39,00:34:40,Take the bins out.
00:34:40,00:34:42,I'm doing tests because you can't.
00:34:42,00:34:43,"No, but this is a thing."
00:34:43,00:34:44,So I don't know if you're a wife.
00:34:44,00:34:45,There's a really good example.
00:34:45,00:34:46,Because I'll see you next time.
00:34:46,00:34:47,So many times.
00:34:47,00:34:48,It's cruel.
00:34:48,00:34:59,"So basically, the really common sense thing is, if you ask a woman, what do you think of the"
00:34:59,00:35:04,"idea of this sexual act and let's say something really quotidian, like oral sex?"
00:35:04,00:35:05,Okay.
00:35:05,00:35:06,That's quotidian.
00:35:06,00:35:07,So I go.
00:35:07,00:35:12,"So very soberly, most people don't really like the idea of it, but when they're aroused"
00:35:12,00:35:13,that goes out of the window.
00:35:13,00:35:15,And it only seems to happen with women.
00:35:15,00:35:16,But I look into it.
00:35:16,00:35:18,I've had three studies and they're all university students.
00:35:18,00:35:23,"And I worry that that's because 22-year-old students are just disgusting anyway, like the"
00:35:23,00:35:24,men.
00:35:24,00:35:26,So they're very difficult to study.
00:35:26,00:35:31,"But what they do, they make them watch arousing videos and then they get them to do different"
00:35:31,00:35:32,tasks.
00:35:32,00:35:35,"And some of them are like, eat, have a bite of that biscuit and it's next to a living"
00:35:35,00:35:36,worm.
00:35:36,00:35:37,"Yeah, yeah."
00:35:37,00:35:40,"People who have watched a physical, sort of soft-core erotica are more likely to bite the"
00:35:40,00:35:42,biscuit and say they didn't discuss them.
00:35:42,00:35:43,Wow.
00:35:43,00:35:44,It's amazing.
00:35:44,00:35:47,And they're much more likely to touch what they're told is a bowl of used condoms.
00:35:47,00:35:52,"If they've watched this sort of soft pornography, then if they've watched a video of the Olympics,"
00:35:52,00:35:55,they just show them physical activity or sexual activity or obviously control group.
00:35:55,00:35:56,Yeah.
00:35:56,00:36:01,"And this is men or women, or both, both, but the results seem to be showing a lot more"
00:36:01,00:36:02,for women.
00:36:02,00:36:07,"That's an idea for a restaurant, doesn't matter how good the food is, but you just put"
00:36:07,00:36:11,"porn on the TVs all the time, and people will enjoy the food more."
00:36:11,00:36:12,Yeah.
00:36:12,00:36:17,Welcome to Andy's bottom feeders.
00:36:17,00:36:22,Did you read about these studies that have shown that conservative people find things
00:36:22,00:36:24,more disgusting than liberal people?
00:36:24,00:36:29,And it's to such an extent that if you put a scanner on someone's head and you look
00:36:29,00:36:35,"at their brain, you can show them one single image of, say, some food with maggots in."
00:36:35,00:36:41,And you can measure their brain activity and you can tell with a 95 to 98% accuracy whether
00:36:41,00:36:42,they would vote conservative or liberal.
00:36:42,00:36:43,Wow.
00:36:43,00:36:44,Amazing.
00:36:44,00:36:45,Yeah.
00:36:45,00:36:48,"There's lots of reasons why they think it might be the case, so obviously we don't really"
00:36:48,00:36:55,"know, but it's basically conservatives are a bit more trusting of the natural reactions."
00:36:55,00:36:59,"And liberals are more likely to do something called cognitive reappraisal, which is you"
00:36:59,00:37:00,see something disgusting.
00:37:00,00:37:04,"But then you think, well, actually, it's just natural that maggots eat food because they're"
00:37:04,00:37:05,animals as well.
00:37:05,00:37:09,And you kind of think about it yourself and come up with reasons about it rather than just
00:37:09,00:37:10,trusting your initial reaction.
00:37:10,00:37:12,So can we run elections based on this?
00:37:12,00:37:15,"Like, do we need to bother with all the bits of paper and the foods?"
00:37:15,00:37:18,"Can't we just all get our heads scanned and be told, let them or whatever?"
00:37:18,00:37:19,Yeah.
00:37:19,00:37:22,"Like a sorting hat, but it's full of maggots."
00:37:22,00:37:23,It's fair for trying.
00:37:23,00:37:30,And it was all to get out because people saved the government billions.
00:37:30,00:37:34,One of us here is like clear to be disgusted for the rest of us.
00:37:34,00:37:36,"Ooh, who could it be?"
00:37:36,00:37:37,I love Tories.
00:37:37,00:37:38,Is it me?
00:37:38,00:37:42,Is it someone from the north of England?
00:37:42,00:37:44,It's not about being from the north of England.
00:37:44,00:37:45,Right.
00:37:45,00:37:46,And gender?
00:37:46,00:37:47,It's not gender.
00:37:47,00:37:48,Oh.
00:37:48,00:37:49,Is it?
00:37:49,00:37:50,Glass is wearing glasses.
00:37:50,00:37:51,It's not glasses.
00:37:51,00:37:52,"It's like, guess who now?"
00:37:52,00:37:54,Is it people who like golf?
00:37:54,00:37:56,It's not even like golf.
00:37:56,00:37:59,It's something one of us puts in their mouth on a regular basis.
00:37:59,00:38:00,Oh.
00:38:00,00:38:01,Smoking?
00:38:01,00:38:02,No.
00:38:02,00:38:03,Being vegan.
00:38:03,00:38:04,Oh.
00:38:04,00:38:05,Being vegan.
00:38:05,00:38:09,"If you come off meat for a month, you are likely to catch disgust."
00:38:09,00:38:14,"So the more people cut out meat droogues, say they're doing veganery, the more their meat"
00:38:14,00:38:15,disgust will grow.
00:38:15,00:38:16,Oh.
00:38:16,00:38:18,"So I mean, it's actually not, I mean, because you've been a vegan for ages."
00:38:18,00:38:22,"Well, I've been a vegetarian since I was seven and I was talking to someone recently"
00:38:22,00:38:26,"and actually, when I speak to people who give up meat and come back to meat, they have such"
00:38:26,00:38:27,a different response.
00:38:27,00:38:28,"Because for me, it's like cannibalism."
00:38:28,00:38:32,"And obviously, I don't talk about this when they're eating their food and it's just a personal"
00:38:32,00:38:34,"actually, don't say it out loud because it's not a moral judgment."
00:38:34,00:38:35,Yeah.
00:38:35,00:38:37,I do understand that people get to choose their own food.
00:38:37,00:38:42,"But for me, there's no difference between a beef burger and oh, yeah, this is a human"
00:38:42,00:38:43,charm.
00:38:43,00:38:44,A human burger.
00:38:44,00:38:45,"Yeah, a man burger."
00:38:45,00:38:46,Yeah.
00:38:46,00:38:47,Yeah.
00:38:47,00:38:48,Long pig.
00:38:48,00:38:49,What's they call it?
00:38:49,00:38:52,I'm just trying to keep it easy.
00:38:52,00:38:53,You know what?
00:38:53,00:38:54,He likes it too.
00:38:54,00:38:55,He does this all the time.
00:38:55,00:38:58,"Just a lot of these words come out very, very creepy."
00:38:58,00:39:00,I think that one is a miscreepy.
00:39:00,00:39:03,I'm not afraid of saying that.
00:39:03,00:39:08,"So Paul Rosen, I mean, he's done so many studies on this and all of them are interesting."
00:39:08,00:39:10,"I'm just, it's so fascinating what he's done."
00:39:10,00:39:12,So here's a really interesting one.
00:39:12,00:39:15,"This is all about food, right?"
00:39:15,00:39:19,And this is I think from 1986 and he's just been doing decades.
00:39:19,00:39:23,He reported that most participants showed a preference for a normally shaped piece of
00:39:23,00:39:25,fudge over fudge shaped like dog feces.
00:39:25,00:39:29,"Now, I would say so far, so obvious, right?"
00:39:29,00:39:33,Many were far less willing to hold fake vomit made of rubber in their mouths than a clean
00:39:33,00:39:35,new rubber sink stopper.
00:39:35,00:39:36,Again.
00:39:36,00:39:37,Yeah.
00:39:37,00:39:39,"But yeah, I know he's telling people it's clean."
00:39:39,00:39:40,That's the thing.
00:39:40,00:39:41,It's the association.
00:39:41,00:39:42,You do.
00:39:42,00:39:46,"If you go to any tourist shop in England, you can buy poo shapes candy."
00:39:46,00:39:47,Hmm.
00:39:47,00:39:48,You do.
00:39:48,00:39:53,"The first version of this in my life where my, my son, he got really obsessed with the toilet"
00:39:53,00:39:54,brush.
00:39:54,00:39:56,And so obviously there's two things we had to do.
00:39:56,00:39:59,One is I bought a brand new toilet brush with a toilet and I bought him his own toilet
00:39:59,00:40:03,brush and it's from the same place.
00:40:03,00:40:07,And no one's comfortable with him playing with it because it's a toilet brush and it's
00:40:07,00:40:11,"never been used in the toilet until he did, he did start using it in the toilet because"
00:40:11,00:40:12,he wants the reaction.
00:40:12,00:40:15,"But at the beginning, it was just Christmas and everyone was at tonight."
00:40:15,00:40:16,I was weird.
00:40:16,00:40:17,"No, I get that completely."
00:40:17,00:40:18,I understand.
00:40:18,00:40:19,Yeah.
00:40:19,00:40:20,But it's just a brush.
00:40:20,00:40:24,"The first ever Christmas tree was made out of toilet brushes and painted green, yeah."
00:40:24,00:40:26,"So in a way, you would be a very festive."
00:40:26,00:40:27,Very Christmassy.
00:40:27,00:40:28,Yeah.
00:40:28,00:40:30,"This year, everyone's getting one there."
00:40:30,00:40:32,We're the fun fact attached.
00:40:32,00:40:33,Yeah.
00:40:33,00:40:34,Okay.
00:40:34,00:40:42,It's time for our final fact of the show and that is Andy.
00:40:42,00:40:45,"My fact is, there is a spider in Norfolk which can catch fish."
00:40:45,00:40:49,Do you know what the creepiest thing anyone could ever say to you?
00:40:49,00:40:51,That's what Carrie had said to me yesterday.
00:40:51,00:40:54,"She said, Andy text me, is Sarah scared of spiders?"
00:40:54,00:40:55,"Oh, yeah."
00:40:55,00:40:59,"That's a creepy thing to hear, isn't it?"
00:40:59,00:41:00,I asked her not to pass that on.
00:41:00,00:41:01,She told me that as well.
00:41:01,00:41:02,She made it creepy.
00:41:02,00:41:06,"He said, he said, not to tell you I've asked."
00:41:06,00:41:08,"Oh, dear."
00:41:08,00:41:10,And you're not too scared of spiders.
00:41:10,00:41:11,"I'm not scared of spiders, no?"
00:41:11,00:41:12,Some people are very funny.
00:41:12,00:41:13,"Yes, yes."
00:41:13,00:41:14,So I just wanted to check that out before we...
00:41:14,00:41:17,Are you asking just to see if we can even talk about the concept of spiders?
00:41:17,00:41:18,Yeah.
00:41:18,00:41:19,Yeah.
00:41:19,00:41:20,Okay.
00:41:20,00:41:25,"And this is the queen of the marsh, the fenn raft spider, Norfolk, and Suffolk as well."
00:41:25,00:41:28,Sorry to any Suffolkers who are listening who thought I'd be missing you out.
00:41:28,00:41:30,And it's just a really cool spider.
00:41:30,00:41:32,"It's just about the biggest in the UK, I think."
00:41:32,00:41:33,How big is it?
00:41:33,00:41:34,Show me your hand.
00:41:34,00:41:35,About that big.
00:41:35,00:41:36,Great.
00:41:36,00:41:37,It's massive.
00:41:37,00:41:38,It's broad.
00:41:38,00:41:39,"Yeah, yeah."
00:41:39,00:41:40,It's broad.
00:41:40,00:41:41,It's not a big broad.
00:41:41,00:41:43,And it's another great story of reintroduction.
00:41:43,00:41:44,"They got down to a very, very few left."
00:41:44,00:41:48,And then the people who live around there who are working conservation have restored their
00:41:48,00:41:50,habitat load and they've been breeding them up.
00:41:50,00:41:56,And the RSPB recently announced not so insi-winsi spider makes incredible comeback.
00:41:56,00:41:58,And they're really cool.
00:41:58,00:42:00,And they're not interested in your house.
00:42:00,00:42:01,They don't like you.
00:42:01,00:42:02,"If you don't like spiders, don't worry."
00:42:02,00:42:03,They're not coming for you.
00:42:03,00:42:04,Yeah.
00:42:04,00:42:09,"And they can basically sit on top of the water, which is the most fascinating thing if you"
00:42:09,00:42:10,watch a video with them.
00:42:10,00:42:11,Fenn raft spider.
00:42:11,00:42:12,They are the rough.
00:42:12,00:42:13,It's extraordinary.
00:42:13,00:42:17,"It's the hairs as now on the legs that allow them to do that, I think."
00:42:17,00:42:19,And that also helps them to feel vibration.
00:42:19,00:42:24,"So if a fish is going past, they can just feel the vibration on their little hairs and go"
00:42:24,00:42:25,fuck.
00:42:25,00:42:27,And they run across the water and they grab the fit.
00:42:27,00:42:28,"I mean, there's sticker packs, obviously."
00:42:28,00:42:29,There's not salmon or anything that are catching.
00:42:29,00:42:30,But they are.
00:42:30,00:42:31,They're pretty cool.
00:42:31,00:42:35,"They're slightly big relative to the size of the spider itself, you know, because the"
00:42:35,00:42:37,spider can go underwater as well.
00:42:37,00:42:41,So it will go down on the branch of a vine or whatever that's going into the water.
00:42:41,00:42:42,It will just hang out there.
00:42:42,00:42:44,It can stay there for about an hour.
00:42:44,00:42:49,"And I've seen videos of, you know, little creatures coming up and launching like a spider"
00:42:49,00:42:51,wood and bringing it back in and consuming it.
00:42:51,00:42:54,And they're close to the same size as the spider.
00:42:54,00:42:59,Can we talk about Helen Smith who is the heroine of this whole story of bringing the spiders
00:42:59,00:43:01,back into the North at Bronze.
00:43:01,00:43:08,"So she hand-reared 3,000 baby Fenn raft spiders in her own kitchen."
00:43:08,00:43:12,And these are the first ones that they put into the water.
00:43:12,00:43:17,"And eventually some other charities got involved and they eventually put 30,000 in."
00:43:17,00:43:19,But she definitely started it.
00:43:19,00:43:24,And she would line up every single one of these spiders in an individual test tube.
00:43:24,00:43:27,"Because if you put two of them in a test tube, they'd just eat each other."
00:43:27,00:43:29,So they had to be all kept separate.
00:43:29,00:43:34,And then she had to personally feed them flies for a full year so that they would grow big
00:43:34,00:43:35,enough to let them go.
00:43:35,00:43:36,"30,000."
00:43:36,00:43:41,"The 3,000 she did and then eventually it was 30,000."
00:43:41,00:43:45,"And she had to collect the flies herself, because they eat like fruit flies."
00:43:45,00:43:50,"There's things I want to make fun of her a lot, but I'm also really scared of her."
00:43:50,00:43:54,"I think there's a kind of, as you don't want to make an enemy of someone with access to"
00:43:54,00:43:57,"3,000 spiders and with that kind of attention to detail."
00:43:57,00:43:58,That's what you should have asked her.
00:43:58,00:43:59,You should have asked her.
00:43:59,00:44:00,You scared Helen.
00:44:00,00:44:04,"Yeah, I'm really scared of Helen from Norfolk."
00:44:04,00:44:09,She had to get these fruit flies and apparently the best place to get them was from compost
00:44:09,00:44:12,heaps or horse dung.
00:44:12,00:44:17,"And so she said, how aroused was she?"
00:44:17,00:44:23,She said she had spent a lot of time with a sweep net following ponies and waiting for them
00:44:23,00:44:27,"to poo, just so that she could get the flies when they first arrived on the poo."
00:44:27,00:44:28,Isn't that mad?
00:44:28,00:44:35,"The neighbors, the people who didn't know what she was doing, all of her behaviour, do you"
00:44:35,00:44:37,want to come in for a cup of tea?
00:44:37,00:44:38,She's here.
00:44:38,00:44:39,What have done?
00:44:39,00:44:40,So cool.
00:44:40,00:44:41,And you now get spider tourism.
00:44:41,00:44:44,"People visit these nature reserves because their webs are, I mean, they are massive and"
00:44:44,00:44:45,they're webs are massive too.
00:44:45,00:44:47,The webs are apparently the size of a normal pizza.
00:44:47,00:44:48,Yeah.
00:44:48,00:44:49,Wow.
00:44:49,00:44:52,"And then, obviously, when they give birth, there's thousands and thousands more."
00:44:52,00:44:53,"Oh, yeah."
00:44:53,00:44:54,Yeah.
00:44:54,00:44:55,So little baby ones.
00:44:55,00:44:56,"Yeah, right."
00:44:56,00:44:58,Pretty good mums.
00:44:58,00:44:59,The female fan runs by.
00:44:59,00:45:00,It's not all spiders are.
00:45:00,00:45:01,Not all spiders are.
00:45:01,00:45:08,"Well, female, she has an egg sack, which is just a big bag of eggs and she carries it round"
00:45:08,00:45:11,for three weeks in this bag.
00:45:11,00:45:13,"And if it gets too cold, she will lift the bag up towards the sun."
00:45:13,00:45:17,"And if it gets too hot, she would dunk it in the water to cool it down a bit."
00:45:17,00:45:21,"And she goes that whole time without eating because, you know, busy."
00:45:21,00:45:25,"And then she spins this nursery web, as it's called, the size of a pizza."
00:45:25,00:45:26,And suspends that above water.
00:45:26,00:45:31,"And if you go to the north and broads to see these things, you can see these disks just off"
00:45:31,00:45:37,"the path in the water, these nursery webs, full of the spiderlings."
00:45:37,00:45:38,"But yeah, spiders."
00:45:38,00:45:40,"Well, these ones, just one more thing about these ones."
00:45:40,00:45:43,They're one of only two spiders protected in UK law.
00:45:43,00:45:44,Really?
00:45:44,00:45:45,Yeah.
00:45:45,00:45:48,The Ladybird spider is the other one.
00:45:48,00:45:52,It's the Wildlife and Countryside Act of 1981.
00:45:52,00:45:59,"So if you intentionally kill, injure or take a raft spider, then you guilty of an offence."
00:45:59,00:46:04,"And if you say that you're intending to sell one as well, that's illegal."
00:46:04,00:46:05,On the dark web.
00:46:05,00:46:06,Oh.
00:46:06,00:46:07,Oh.
00:46:07,00:46:08,Thank you.
00:46:08,00:46:09,"Very, very good."
00:46:09,00:46:10,Thank you.
00:46:10,00:46:11,"Very, very good."
00:46:11,00:46:14,"Other animals that you are not allowed to kill in the UK, the water bite, the grasshopper,"
00:46:14,00:46:20,"the trembling sea mat, the slow worm, the glutinous snail, the small blue butterfly and"
00:46:20,00:46:22,"the large blue, basically any blue butterfly."
00:46:22,00:46:26,That's why we can't do almost the liberty to get me out of here in this country.
00:46:26,00:46:27,Yeah.
00:46:27,00:46:30,It's the place of Australia where we can eat everything.
00:46:30,00:46:32,Did you say the glutinous sea mat?
00:46:32,00:46:34,"No, I said the glutinous snail."
00:46:34,00:46:36,"Oh, there was a sea mat in it."
00:46:36,00:46:37,There's trembling on something.
00:46:37,00:46:38,Yeah.
00:46:38,00:46:39,"Yeah, sea mat."
00:46:39,00:46:40,"That's an amazing, I've never heard of that."
00:46:40,00:46:41,No.
00:46:41,00:46:46,"They live in the sea around the United Kingdom and they're basically algal mats, I think,"
00:46:46,00:46:47,tremors.
00:46:47,00:46:50,That kind of knock off sponge bulb square pants is what I'm hearing.
00:46:50,00:46:51,Yeah.
00:46:51,00:46:52,I'll give you that.
00:46:52,00:46:54,Are they just terrified the whole time?
00:46:54,00:46:55,They shouldn't be because they're protected.
00:46:55,00:46:56,Yeah.
00:46:56,00:46:58,"You know, it's rising sea levels, global warming."
00:46:58,00:46:59,Yeah.
00:46:59,00:47:01,Are there the only people that are worried?
00:47:01,00:47:07,"I think the scared of adding these buttons, just to bring that back."
00:47:07,00:47:10,You know that spiders can inventimate you after they've been squished.
00:47:10,00:47:11,What?
00:47:11,00:47:16,"So, this was a story from this year in California, there was a 37-year-old woman who went"
00:47:16,00:47:22,to the emergency room because her eye was all swollen and goopy and felt like it was burning.
00:47:22,00:47:27,"And apparently 20 minutes earlier, her husband had killed a Western and Black Widow spider"
00:47:27,00:47:28,with a hammer.
00:47:28,00:47:33,It splattered in all directions and some of it went in her eye and she got invented.
00:47:33,00:47:34,Oh my God.
00:47:34,00:47:37,How closely was she looking at the spider?
00:47:37,00:47:39,"Before we hammered it, there's so much of that story that's horrible."
00:47:39,00:47:40,"Yeah, yes."
00:47:40,00:47:42,The hammered a spider to death.
00:47:42,00:47:43,It's an awful story.
00:47:43,00:47:45,I think what I'm saying is don't squish spiders.
00:47:45,00:47:46,No.
00:47:46,00:47:47,There's no need to.
00:47:47,00:47:48,"No, there are friends."
00:47:48,00:47:49,Yeah.
00:47:49,00:47:51,"Well, Black Widow spiders are not our friends."
00:47:51,00:47:52,I don't know.
00:47:52,00:47:55,But they're still important to the ecosystem.
00:47:55,00:47:56,Absolutely.
00:47:56,00:47:57,Yeah.
00:47:57,00:47:58,So am I.
00:47:58,00:47:59,Yeah.
00:47:59,00:48:00,That's a human being.
00:48:00,00:48:01,There's too many of us.
00:48:01,00:48:02,Yeah.
00:48:02,00:48:05,"Not you personally, but in terms of the ecosystem."
00:48:05,00:48:06,"No, no, that's fine."
00:48:06,00:48:09,"But if we're going to start with anyone, Andy, we might as well, you know."
00:48:09,00:48:11,I feel like I have a good run.
00:48:11,00:48:16,"I always say to my daughter, whenever the spider, I'm like spiders are our friends and they're"
00:48:16,00:48:17,really important.
00:48:17,00:48:21,"And I am actually terrified of spiders, so I don't really believe it when I say it."
00:48:21,00:48:23,"I mean, I do believe it, but I'm like hiding my fear."
00:48:23,00:48:26,You have to show that you're not afraid of this trick.
00:48:26,00:48:30,Do you find that it helps you that it's helping your response to spiders that you now
00:48:30,00:48:31,can't?
00:48:31,00:48:32,Maybe.
00:48:32,00:48:33,I suppose so.
00:48:33,00:48:35,I can't show fear in front of my daughter.
00:48:35,00:48:36,Yeah.
00:48:36,00:48:37,It's a reinforced fear.
00:48:37,00:48:38,Yeah.
00:48:38,00:48:41,"So actually, I think it's really good for lots of, you know, lots of people to walk when"
00:48:41,00:48:45,"they have children to then temper it, and then you go, actually, I am less panicky about"
00:48:45,00:48:46,it.
00:48:46,00:48:49,"And if you have to be the person that puts it safely outside, do you realize my wife does"
00:48:49,00:48:50,that?
00:48:50,00:48:51,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:48:51,00:48:56,But that's only because you're trying to arouse her.
00:48:56,00:48:57,Did you do down the drain?
00:48:57,00:49:00,"Did you get the photo I sent you recently, not long ago, for Big Spider and a little while"
00:49:00,00:49:01,we didn't reply to?
00:49:01,00:49:02,"Was it, well, was it mum?"
00:49:02,00:49:03,It was a big spider.
00:49:03,00:49:04,On email.
00:49:04,00:49:05,"No, it was WhatsApp."
00:49:05,00:49:06,"Oh, yeah."
00:49:06,00:49:07,I don't recall.
00:49:07,00:49:08,How big was it?
00:49:08,00:49:09,It was big.
00:49:09,00:49:10,It was a house spider.
00:49:10,00:49:12,But it was a big one.
00:49:12,00:49:13,It was in my house.
00:49:13,00:49:14,"It was not only in my house, Sarah."
00:49:14,00:49:17,It fell onto my naked shoulder as I sat in bed.
00:49:17,00:49:22,"Andy, I've got an experience very, very, very similar where I was once cancelling a dentist"
00:49:22,00:49:26,"appointment, and I could feel a little thing of hair in my face like this."
00:49:26,00:49:27,"Oh, no."
00:49:27,00:49:29,"I was just brushing this hair off, because I was interested in what you were saying about"
00:49:29,00:49:30,the hair balancing on the water.
00:49:30,00:49:32,I was just brushing this hair off my face.
00:49:32,00:49:36,"So first in the morning, and then I pushed, and then I heard it hit the floor, and it"
00:49:36,00:49:37,was so massive.
00:49:37,00:49:41,"And there's a mirror there, and I think, if I'd actually seen it on my face, I would have"
00:49:41,00:49:42,died.
00:49:42,00:49:46,"If I'd actually seen it on my face, I'd just felt it there."
00:49:46,00:49:50,"So having just got out of it, they do come on us in the night."
00:49:50,00:49:51,They do come on us in the night.
00:49:51,00:49:53,"And I did see the photo now that you say it, Andy."
00:49:53,00:49:54,I do remember.
00:49:54,00:49:55,It was bad.
00:49:55,00:49:56,It was bad.
00:49:56,00:49:57,A glass couldn't fit over it.
00:49:57,00:49:58,"Well, yeah."
00:49:58,00:49:59,I have very narrow necked glasses.
00:49:59,00:50:00,But still.
00:50:00,00:50:01,You should have only drank champagne.
00:50:01,00:50:03,I should have started with the flute.
00:50:03,00:50:04,I should have gone with the marion.
00:50:04,00:50:05,But that was my fault.
00:50:05,00:50:11,"And it was just from a clear blue sky, from a ceiling, basically, from a ceiling."
00:50:11,00:50:12,What the heck?
00:50:12,00:50:13,Yeah.
00:50:13,00:50:14,I find it.
00:50:14,00:50:18,"So as someone who spent my teenage years in Australia, I don't."
00:50:18,00:50:21,"They're friendly here, comparative to Australia, where they kill you."
00:50:21,00:50:23,"So it's, I don't find them in any way scary here."
00:50:23,00:50:24,There's a few.
00:50:24,00:50:25,There was a great incident I read about.
00:50:25,00:50:27,We're a guy called Matthew Stevens.
00:50:27,00:50:28,He was a chef.
00:50:28,00:50:32,And he was cleaning behind a freezer at the Quantac Gateway pub in Bridgewater when
00:50:32,00:50:37,"suddenly he would, yeah, we've all been there."
00:50:37,00:50:42,"And he was, he was bitten twice on his hand by what turned out to be a Brazilian wandering"
00:50:42,00:50:43,spider.
00:50:43,00:50:44,And that is very dangerous.
00:50:44,00:50:45,Yes.
00:50:45,00:50:47,"They come in like bananas, don't they?"
00:50:47,00:50:49,And this is where this came from.
00:50:49,00:50:52,"It traveled in the bananas overseas, made it to him."
00:50:52,00:50:56,"And this is, this is how intense the spider, this kind of spider is."
00:50:56,00:51:02,"Once he knocked it off of him, he knocked it into an open freezer, and then he drenched"
00:51:02,00:51:03,it in boiling water.
00:51:03,00:51:05,And it still was just fine.
00:51:05,00:51:06,"Well, that's because you've got hot and cold."
00:51:06,00:51:08,It was just a very pleasant temperature.
00:51:08,00:51:09,"Oh, you're right."
00:51:09,00:51:12,"This is on a spa, it's like a lukewarm bar."
00:51:12,00:51:13,Yes.
00:51:13,00:51:18,"The spider's thinking, oh, I will review the Quantac's well."
00:51:18,00:51:19,Yeah.
00:51:19,00:51:23,And so they collected the spider in the jar and they brought it to where he was at the
00:51:23,00:51:24,hospital.
00:51:24,00:51:25,Someone in the hospital.
00:51:25,00:51:26,Why did they do that?
00:51:26,00:51:27,I guess if you want to start.
00:51:27,00:51:28,Yeah.
00:51:28,00:51:30,"You meant to show what bit you, because you're like, we need the anti-vener."
00:51:30,00:51:31,Sorry.
00:51:31,00:51:34,I was recovering in hospital and they found it and brought it in here like a year ago.
00:51:34,00:51:35,You were there.
00:51:35,00:51:36,You were there.
00:51:36,00:51:41,"The worst is when I was attacked by a bear, and I had to bring the bear into the hospital."
00:51:41,00:51:43,So this is why I was attacked by a bear.
00:51:43,00:51:46,"Yeah, but so they brought it in and it was in a jar, and then someone who worked in the"
00:51:46,00:51:49,"hospital saw it and thought, oh, I should put this back out and let it back loose."
00:51:49,00:51:50,Oh.
00:51:50,00:51:51,"Oh, it's in the wild."
00:51:51,00:51:52,Yeah.
00:51:52,00:51:53,"And they said we probably shouldn't worry, because it was probably going to die a couple"
00:51:53,00:51:54,of days after.
00:51:54,00:51:56,I think it wouldn't like it in which water.
00:51:56,00:51:57,Yeah.
00:51:57,00:51:58,Exactly.
00:51:58,00:51:59,It's the temperatures.
00:51:59,00:52:00,Yeah.
00:52:00,00:52:01,Yeah.
00:52:01,00:52:07,"Drief, should we have a positive spide effect, as opposed to all this scary stuff?"
00:52:07,00:52:11,"Some people think, I want to say people, I mean, scientists, consider that a spide is web"
00:52:11,00:52:13,should be considered part of its mind.
00:52:13,00:52:14,Right.
00:52:14,00:52:15,Okay.
00:52:15,00:52:16,"This is where it is, isn't it?"
00:52:16,00:52:20,"So it's an externalisation of, not of consciousness, but of thought."
00:52:20,00:52:21,Is that why?
00:52:21,00:52:22,Yeah.
00:52:22,00:52:25,"Because I guess the web, if it's as far away from it feels the movement, therefore your"
00:52:25,00:52:26,brain is registering.
00:52:26,00:52:27,Exactly.
00:52:27,00:52:28,Right.
00:52:28,00:52:29,And they have foresight.
00:52:29,00:52:33,They change their web structure based on how much they have left in their silk glands.
00:52:33,00:52:36,"So if they're running a bit low, they'll make a simpler web."
00:52:36,00:52:39,So it's kind of an external brain in lots of ways.
00:52:39,00:52:44,"So it would be like antennae going off what Dan said in terms of, or, you know, like, animals"
00:52:44,00:52:48,"where they can feel whether they're going to a space that's too small, that there's an externalisation"
00:52:48,00:52:49,"of sense, isn't it?"
00:52:49,00:52:50,"Right, whiskers."
00:52:50,00:52:51,"Yeah, whiskers."
00:52:51,00:52:52,Yeah.
00:52:52,00:52:55,Although they'll do market research on what's hitting their web and sticking.
00:52:55,00:52:59,"So if prey is hitting it and bouncing off, they'll rejig the web so it's got more sticky"
00:52:59,00:53:01,pads on it to catch more.
00:53:01,00:53:05,"Or if the local prey is a different size to what they're expecting, they'll change the"
00:53:05,00:53:06,web based on that.
00:53:06,00:53:07,It's so cool.
00:53:07,00:53:08,"It's really good, isn't it?"
00:53:08,00:53:09,They are good.
00:53:09,00:53:10,Yeah.
00:53:10,00:53:11,That's right.
00:53:11,00:53:16,The male Asian hermit spiders become better at fighting if you cut their penises off.
00:53:16,00:53:17,Yeah.
00:53:17,00:53:20,"Like what they're getting in the way, or what is it that's?"
00:53:20,00:53:21,No.
00:53:21,00:53:25,"So what, they're one of these spiders where after they've had sex, they usually remove"
00:53:25,00:53:28,their penises and keep it inside the female's reproductive tract.
00:53:28,00:53:29,"Oh, yeah."
00:53:29,00:53:30,No other male can.
00:53:30,00:53:31,Yeah.
00:53:31,00:53:32,"Yeah, there's a plug."
00:53:32,00:53:33,Oh.
00:53:33,00:53:34,But they also get...
00:53:34,00:53:35,It's really common.
00:53:35,00:53:36,It's really common.
00:53:36,00:53:38,"In nature, yes, because it's one of the best ways of sperm competition."
00:53:38,00:53:39,Yeah.
00:53:39,00:53:44,"But the other thing they do to make sure that their sperm is successful is they become very,"
00:53:44,00:53:48,very aggressive and they start fighting off any other spiders who come and try and make
00:53:48,00:53:49,with the female.
00:53:49,00:53:54,"And so that means if you just cut the penis off, then they still get all these hormones"
00:53:54,00:53:57,"or whatever they are to make them really aggressive and they'll just get really, really"
00:53:57,00:53:58,fighting.
00:53:58,00:53:59,So what are you proposing?
00:53:59,00:54:02,Just go proposal here.
00:54:02,00:54:05,We have a lot of modifications to the British army.
00:54:05,00:54:16,"Okay, that's it, that is all of our facts."
00:54:16,00:54:18,Thank you so much for listening.
00:54:18,00:54:21,If you'd like to get in contact with any of us about the things that we've said over
00:54:21,00:54:24,"the course of this podcast, we can all be found online."
00:54:24,00:54:26,I'm on @tribaland on Instagram.
00:54:26,00:54:27,James.
00:54:27,00:54:29,There's no such thing as James Harkin.
00:54:29,00:54:30,Andy?
00:54:30,00:54:31,Mine is Andrew Hunter M and Sarah.
00:54:31,00:54:33,Sarah Pasco on Instagram.
00:54:33,00:54:34,Yeah.
00:54:34,00:54:35,"And you're on tour now, yeah?"
00:54:35,00:54:36,"Yes, yeah."
00:54:36,00:54:37,I'm on tour until March 2026.
00:54:37,00:54:41,"So if anyone like to come, I'm going to put in some facts about spiders."
00:54:41,00:54:45,"And Helen, you've got a free ticket if you want to go."
00:54:45,00:54:49,"Yeah, or you can get to us as a group by emailing us on podcast@qy.com."
00:54:49,00:54:52,All of those emails make their way over to Andy.
00:54:52,00:54:57,Andy often picks out some of them to include in our bonus show that we do called Drop Us
00:54:57,00:54:58,Align.
00:54:58,00:55:00,And that's part of a thing called Club Fish.
00:55:00,00:55:04,It's a very exciting private members club that we've set up that has all sorts of bonus
00:55:04,00:55:06,material that you can get access to.
00:55:06,00:55:08,So check that out and you can check that out by going to our website.
00:55:08,00:55:10,No such thing as a fish.com.
00:55:10,00:55:11,There's also merch up there.
00:55:11,00:55:14,Otherwise just come back here next week because we will be back with another episode and
00:55:14,00:55:15,we'll see you then.
00:55:15,00:55:16,Goodbye.
