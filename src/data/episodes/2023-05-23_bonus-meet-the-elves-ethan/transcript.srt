 Hi everyone, welcome to Meet the Elves which is one of our bonus bits of material for you lovely

3
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,680
 patreon and apple subscribers where we're going to meet one of the qi elves who you might not have

4
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:34,560
 heard from before and today's elf we have Ethan Ruparelia. Hello. Hi Ethan and you've come with

5
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:40,400
 a question for us which we'll stumble about and grope about to try and get the answer to

6
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,840
 and probably not really talk about it very much and talk about other stuff and then finally get

7
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,760
 the answer. It's going to be great, I'm looking forward to the sexual harassment lawsuit, it's

8
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,560
 going to be great, perfect. Okay so my question for you, I'm going to set the scene to begin with.

9
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:59,360
 Okay so we're in the northeast in the north of South Africa right in a service station toilet

10
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:09,200
 very romantic. Why might the plumbing bill be so high? Okay should I repeat the question for you?

11
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:16,560
 Yeah let's go to repeat. Okay so why might a public toilets plumbing bill in a service station

12
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,080
 in the north of South Africa be so high in the northeast? Okay so something's gone wrong in the

13
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:28,160
 toilet, like a trapped poo and then Plumber Comes fixes it but for some reason the bill is

14
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:33,600
 extortionately high. Yeah that'd be bad if that's immediately correct and that's the end of the

15
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:40,800
 episode. Ethan is it a one particular toilet? Is it more general? Good question. It has been

16
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:49,040
 observed in at least one toilet but it is symptomatic of a larger issue. Another question

17
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,080
 is this based on personal experience? No you'll have been quite young in the northeast. I would

18
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:59,360
 have been, I would have been about 10 years old at the time. Sure, using toilets. Well to be fair

19
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:05,520
 yeah have you been to South Africa? Yeah I have just recently but bizarrely it's actually nothing

20
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:12,560
 to do with the question itself. Okay okay but yeah I went there recently for one of our colleagues

21
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,360
 weddings actually. Yeah which I wasn't invited to. You guys invited to that. That's a good thing none

22
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:24,480
 of you hold grudges. You won't be hearing Jack on this podcast ever so soon. Did you find out

23
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:30,160
 about it while you were there? Not while I was there but it was this this phenomena of sorts

24
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:36,880
 beginning up a bit too much was was observed around that. Is this paranormal poo? Is this

25
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:41,040
 needing like a... It's nothing paranormal I'm afraid Dan sorry. I think this is the thoughtiest

26
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:46,080
 question we've ever had. We've only had two. There are so many of the three this is on the

27
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,480
 top spot isn't it because it's there are so many elements to it like the naughties. What was going

28
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,600
 on in the naughties? I was thinking Britpop but it's too late for Britpop. That was the 90s.

29
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:00,880
 It was just about finishing Britpop. Spice Girls. Do you know what I found the other day the Arctic

30
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:06,240
 Monkeys. Guess when their latest album was? The latest this year. This year yeah and it's awesome.

31
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:14,640
 I know but I feel like they're still out. Oh sorry the Dandy Warhols. I know. I know the Dandy

32
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,840
 Warhols. That is quite interesting. New album out this year. Okay now now I'm showing my age or lack

33
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:25,440
 of the Dandy Warhols. They were a band of the 90s and Bohemian Like You was their biggest song.

34
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:31,280
 It's a great song. I'm fully expressionless right now. The band Sum41 just announced that they're

35
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:37,200
 breaking up. I think most people went you're still together. Ironically some of them are 41.

36
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:44,880
 So okay Ethan right you've been in South Africa recently. You get mines in South Africa. Gold

37
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:53,600
 mines. Diamond mines. Gold mines. Maybe well hang on Ethan. Yeah work through. Maybe the plumbing

38
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:59,520
 accidentally hit a seam of something or it accidentally went into a mine and the plumbing

39
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:03,600
 bill would be very high because you'd have to go through the mine to get up to fix the pipe.

40
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:10,720
 It's an interesting thought. Is he generally in the right direction on that one? I'm afraid not.

41
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:17,280
 Did you set too much of a scene that we've kind of gone off piece? I will I'll get you to hone in

42
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:23,680
 one thing and we'll work from there. Okay so the north of South Africa like very north in South

43
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:29,680
 Africa what do you know about the geography of the area? It's very mountainous. Border Zimbabwe.

44
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:36,160
 Border Zimbabwe. Ethan said it in a significant way. Okay so that would be Mugabe era. That is

45
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:42,000
 correct yes. Well I'm sort of thinking if you're on the border then you must be someone coming

46
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,160
 through the border in a secret tunnel so maybe it's humans appearing out of the toilet as part of

47
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:57,200
 a ruse to... It's good. It's great. I'm afraid it's nowhere near the answer. I would focus less

48
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:03,760
 on the plumbing aspect and more about what may be causing a plumber to be called out.

49
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:09,360
 You allow this guy to write questions for you? How long has he seen him in the credits haven't you?

50
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,840
 Yeah yeah yeah. How long does he take for this? I mean you're the guys that want to

51
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:19,840
 stretch a three-minute question to in 25-minute seconds so don't blame me for this. Okay so you

52
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:25,040
 call plumbers out because your toilet's blocked. Exactly yes. There's water coming out of it.

53
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:29,680
 Yeah because it's blocked so something has blocked this toilet. That is correct. Something related

54
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:35,840
 to the fact that we're near the border with Zimbabwe. That is correct. Okay the rest of you

55
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:46,880
 can finish off from that. So maybe the material that's coming through is something like volcanic

56
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:53,040
 lava or maybe it's poisonous because then you've got hazmats, you've got radiation people so the

57
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:57,760
 plumber has to be not only a plumber but a sort of scientist who... I'm not saying there aren't

58
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:03,600
 any volcanoes in Zimbabwe but if there are I don't know about them. Well there's one specific spot

59
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,720
 in a toilet. Is the fact it's near the border. Dan said people crossing the border. Is it maybe

60
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,360
 things being smuggled across the border? Not necessarily smuggled but things are certainly

61
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:20,080
 taken across the border which contribute to this. Oh so okay is it that someone has swallowed some

62
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:26,160
 drugs or swallowed something, some contraband and they go to the toilet, they poo it out,

63
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,720
 down the toilet, that gets collected by the Zimbabweans on the other side and that's the

64
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,800
 mode of smuggling. It's a brilliant idea and actually if any law enforcement is listening

65
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:42,800
 you should probably follow up on that as lead but it is entirely legal or rather in the noughties

66
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:49,360
 it was entirely legal. So what was legal in the noughties that no longer is? That's good.

67
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,760
 That is something that's changed right Ethan. That's not a false friend. Something has definitely

68
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:58,240
 changed between the noughties. Can I ask more about your trip to South Africa? Why won't we invite?

69
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,160
 Did you guys get up to anything interesting? Because you did the wedding but you're in South

70
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:11,440
 Africa. We did. We went to the banks of the Limpopo and the Livuvu which are the Livuvu being the

71
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,320
 tributary that runs into the Limpopo and that kind of forms the natural borders between the

72
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:22,800
 countries of South Africa, Mozambique and Zimbabwe and it's really, I was reading up about the area

73
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:28,560
 as well and there is a place in the middle of this kind of intersection of the two rivers

74
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,280
 called Crooks Corner and it was a really fascinating place for smugglers because it was

75
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:40,640
 essentially a hiding spot for people to go in the area so they would go along and if you had

76
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:45,680
 an elephant poacher who was there for the ivory and they were on the South African side they could

77
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:51,440
 just go across the other side of the river and suddenly be in Mozambique territory and enforcement

78
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,600
 from South Africa would evade them and actually there was this small island in the kind of

79
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:01,520
 tri-points between the three and a lot of people would set up camp on this little island so that

80
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,240
 they could avoid capture from all three because they'd be too busy fighting over who has jurisdiction

81
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:12,080
 in the area. That's really interesting. I've got a question right back at you. Yes, go on. Just

82
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,640
 because you were talking about borders, what is the only two countries in the world that have

83
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:23,200
 a land border which it's impossible to drive between? Oh, so it's impossible to drive between.

84
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:31,520
 Yeah, no roads. No roads, just... Is it... So it would be mountainous, I guess? It's not actually,

85
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:37,200
 but think of other kinds of... Is it all river with no bridges? Not river. It's an air border.

86
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:46,080
 Yeah, I said it was a land border. Oh, sorry. Oh, what about a... In fact, all countries have an

87
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:52,000
 air border between them, don't they? What about crevasse? An unbridged crevasse between two? No, think of

88
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,880
 another geographical feature. That's hill. A bit too steep between the two, like a mountainous

89
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,480
 ridge. Not mountains, not valleys, something that's difficult to get through. Quick send.

90
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:14,320
 Bees? Bees are a big hedge. The hedge is closest so far. Oh, okay, forest. There's a forest of danger.

91
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:23,360
 A forest. Big ol' forest. A forest that's so dense and unroaded that you can't get through it.

92
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:28,560
 Yeah. Are we in the Amazon? We're very close to the Amazon. Is it right at the very narrow

93
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:36,000
 neck? Is it Panama? And... The next place you get to in South America? Nicaragua? It's not. It's

94
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,320
 Columbia. And because there is a road that goes all the way from Alaska all the way down to Tierra

95
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:48,640
 del Fuego in the south of Argentina, but there is a gap called the Darien Gap, which you can't get

96
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:53,360
 through. Wow. That's great. Anyway, what are we talking about, Ethan? Why we weren't invited?

97
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,680
 There's fucking work here. That's what we're talking about. Let's get to go. Okay, so is it smuggling

98
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:06,400
 related? Not smuggling, but it's about transporting an item over a border that is causing blockages

99
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:11,920
 in toilets, in public toilets, rather. Something that shouldn't be in a public toilet.

100
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,400
 Something you don't want to be flushing. Don't flush. You're not supposed to flush

101
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:21,360
 babies' nappies down toilets. We're heading in a better direction now. Wet wipes, wet wipes.

102
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:27,440
 Okay, so it's something that you could use in place of toilet paper, but that you shouldn't use.

103
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:35,040
 Books. Cactuses. We're heading in the right, not cactuses. Newspapers. That is actually,

104
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:40,560
 and I'll tell you why in a second, newspaper is one of the things that you are not supposed to be

105
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:46,880
 flushing. There are also two more things that you shouldn't be flushing. Okay, one of which.

106
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:53,840
 You might use instead of toilet paper. Exactly. Leaves. No. Okay. Con cups. Nope. We're in the

107
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:58,880
 right direction. Magazines, like glossy magazines. You're along the lines of something that is

108
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:07,280
 printed. Oh, Kindles. No. Local, a pamphlet that you get in the bathroom saying,

109
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:13,200
 "Please do not flush." Things not to flush down. So I will tell you, there are signs in public

110
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:22,720
 toilets in the north of South Africa, and they explicitly say, "Do not flush cloth, newspaper,

111
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:30,880
 cardboard, and one other type of paper." Oh my goodness. You're loving this. Okay.

112
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:36,400
 Wrapping paper. Let's have some sites of paper. Wrapping paper. Tracing paper.

113
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:41,840
 Tin foil. Famous kind of paper. Yeah. Well, I'm just thinking of a metaphor. I'd like to get

114
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:51,360
 home to my tin diary, pen some reflections about the day. Origami swans. Baking paper.

115
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:57,440
 No. So what were the other bits of context we had before? So it's across the border from South

116
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:02,320
 Africa, we said, was which country? Zimbabwe. And what was the time frame? Mugabe.

117
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:08,720
 Yeah. And walking. This is why Ethan, who does a lot of production on QI,

118
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:14,960
 he, you know, he has to be properly on it. He has to tell people when they're pissing around.

119
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,960
 Yeah. Yeah. He thought we could do this in three minutes.

120
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:23,360
 What did Mugabe, well, Mugabe, did he not? Did he balance that? That newspaper's not...

121
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:29,280
 Oh. Money. Paper money. Hyperinflation. There we go. There we go.

122
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,920
 Do you have money down the toilet? Don't flush money down the toilet.

123
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:37,760
 Because the old Zimbabwean dollars, especially the lower denominations, were virtually worthless.

124
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:45,040
 Yeah. Worth pennies. And actually, I very briefly remember or I heard you talk about in your 100th

125
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:50,160
 episode about having one of these Zimbabwean dollars. Yeah, I do have one. Yeah. And they

126
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:56,080
 actually ran up to a hundred trillion Zimbabwean dollars. Exactly. Do you know how much that's

127
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:00,560
 worth if you were to exchange it to US dollars? To me, it's priceless, Ethan, sure. And how much

128
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:06,720
 was the eBay listing? I bought it for my wife's birthday, I think, and I thought it was a fun

129
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:12,240
 present to buy her. So let's not say it's completely worthless. No, no, not completely.

130
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:17,360
 But there were a lot on not eBay. 40 cents. Up until 2016, it could be exchanged for US dollars,

131
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:23,600
 and it was worth 40 cents. So the Zimbabwean dollar was first introduced in 1980 to replace

132
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,320
 the Rhodesian dollar. It was kind of a one to one. And over time, there were a lot of

133
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:33,520
 political economic decisions that led to a lot of inflation. And that meant that through the

134
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:39,920
 naughties, there was a lot of redenominization of the amounts of the dollars. So as things

135
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,000
 were getting more expensive, you'd be paying ludicrous amounts of money, you know, a thousand

136
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,840
 dollars for a loaf of bread or something. And so they decided to divide them essentially to create

137
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:56,560
 a new dollar. So in 2006, they redenominated the first dollar to the second dollar by dividing

138
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:02,640
 everything by a thousand. In 2008, they did that again. But they did it by dividing by 10 billion.

139
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:10,880
 And in 2009, they did it again at a trillion to one. And so they ended up essentially having

140
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:18,960
 within the space of five years, four different types of dollar. I remember reading in one of the

141
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:25,200
 most famous types of hyperinflation was in Germany after World War One. And they had this thing where

142
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:30,720
 these numbers were so big, and like you had to go to the shops and pay 10 billion pounds for a

143
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,400
 loaf of bread or whatever. And you were dealing with all this stuff. The people had this weird

144
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:39,600
 thing that if you asked them how many kids they had, they'd say, Oh, I have got two trillion girls

145
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,320
 and three billion boys and stuff. Because they just in their head, that's what the what they were

146
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:50,160
 thinking in all the time. It's weird, isn't it? Yeah. And so I was talking to Manu, who's one

147
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:55,200
 of the other elves on the team. And she was saying she used to take trips to Zimbabwe with her family

148
00:14:55,200 --> 00:15:01,360
 and that people would go to the markets and they'd literally be carrying wheelbarrows full of cash

149
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,840
 to pay for their food. There would be stories of restaurants, you sit down for a meal and over

150
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:10,080
 the course of the meal, the owner of the restaurant would be constantly trying to change the prices

151
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:15,840
 to keep up with the inflation. Oh, my God. The value was halving every single day. So one dollar

152
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:23,280
 would be worth 50 cents by 24 hours later. Imagine that like mid meal. Your meal is suddenly

153
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:28,480
 way more expensive. James, do you remember you went to Romania and it was just you had a chance to

154
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,720
 pay for your hotel on the day when you got there. And you went now pay it when I leave. And then I

155
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:38,480
 think like Brexit happened. Yeah, it was. Yeah, it was the Brexit vote. And yeah, we went to the

156
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:44,320
 hotel on the day before and left on the day after. And we decided to pay on the way out. And the

157
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:49,680
 pound had absolutely tanked because of the Brexit vote and it cost a fortune. So your question,

158
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:54,480
 yes, were you tricking us a bit there? Like was the plumbing bill expensive? Or is it just

159
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,240
 because the stuff in it was money? Well, it's because you shouldn't be flushing money. It was

160
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:06,640
 cheaper to be using, for example, a 1000 Zimbabwe and dollar note than it would be to use a sheet

161
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:12,080
 of toilet paper. And so people were using these and flushing them down. And so you find remnants

162
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:18,240
 of that era still signs up that say, wow, no cloth, no newspaper, no Zimbabwe dollars flushing

163
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:27,440
 about the toilets. Well played. I tried to give you some hints. That was great. Banks of Limpopo.

164
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:33,680
 But obviously. Oh, was that a clue? It was it? Well, it was a bit of a clue. I'll give you a

165
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:38,800
 bit too obvious. Anyway, so this wedding, there was quite a few elves there, weren't they? There

166
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:43,600
 was you. But I want to know, because you guys did go and do sort of touristy stuff as a group

167
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,680
 of elves. And it is quite the case that when you get a group of elves together, it's kind of like

168
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:52,080
 one of our podcasts, it's just f*cking insuffable. Yeah, did everyone else at the wedding party go,

169
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:57,120
 "Oh, no, not the f*cking QILs coming to this one table." Weirdly, a long way from the other.

170
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,600
 Well, James's wedding, that's the table I was on. I was on the elf table. There was,

171
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,080
 there was like, we were separated from the rest of uh... And he wasn't invited to that wedding.

172
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:11,120
 I don't think I've met you at the time. Yeah, you guys didn't know each other.

173
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:15,040
 I think you did vote, but I couldn't come. Oh, did I? I think you, yeah, yeah, we didn't really

174
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:18,880
 know each other well by then, but you said, "That's kind of you. Jack, take note."

175
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:28,480
 But yeah, it was, it was, it was a crazy time. Actually, Stephen J Dubna of Freakonomics, who

176
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:34,480
 you guys had on for me. He was invited. He was invited. Sorry, Dan. What? Oh my gosh. Was he,

177
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:40,320
 he wasn't, was he? No, I was, he did, he did the calculation for the toilet paper and,

178
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:49,200
 and it would cost about a third as much to use a Zimbabwean $1,000 note compared to a sheet of

179
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:55,760
 toilet paper. So yeah, it's really incredible. Yeah, yeah, less absorbent though. Less absorbent.

180
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:00,960
 Much less absorbent, I would imagine. That's true. Yeah. But also less porous, so you won't have to

181
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:06,960
 fold or scrunch. I've thought this through a lot. Hey, you know, you, just another wedding you went

182
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:12,800
 to, again, was invited, but you're, is your brother? Yes. He was married and you went to one of our

183
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:17,440
 facts as we were doing the fact. To Gibraltar. You went to Gibraltar and you went across the road

184
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:24,720
 that's the runway, doubles as an airport and a main road. So weirdly scary because you have

185
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,320
 security guards on either side that kind of prevent you from crossing when they don't

186
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,800
 want you to cross. And that meant that you're waiting sometimes 10 minutes a time to just

187
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:36,400
 try and cross over to the other side, which could be you missing your flight or not.

188
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:42,480
 And so they get people to kind of chase you from behind, kind of tell you to make you cross faster

189
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:47,360
 and faster and faster. Before then another plane tries to take off a land on the runway. So it's,

190
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,800
 it's a real pressure. Imagine giving way in your car to the plane you're meant to be.

191
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:58,640
 So slowly walking along the runway. I've got to get on that. You're not going anywhere.

192
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:07,840
 Okay, let's wrap up. Thank you very much for listening to Meet the Elves. Ethan,

193
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:12,320
 thank you very much for coming on. My pleasure. Hopefully get you back on soon with an equally

194
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:17,680
 fiendish question. Can people get in touch with you anywhere on social media? Yeah. My Twitter is

195
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:24,880
 @EthanRuperalia or my Tinder profile. Just keep swiping. Keep swiping. You'll get there eventually.

196
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,840
 Okay. Well, thanks very much for listening and we'll see you again next week or in two weeks time

197
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,600
 for another bit of bonus material. Andy. Bye.

198
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,640
 Baratachi da baka!
