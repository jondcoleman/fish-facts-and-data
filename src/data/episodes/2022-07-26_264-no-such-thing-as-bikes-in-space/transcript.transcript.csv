00:00:04,00:00:07,"The song is called ""Horoi Wa Ka Sibe"""
00:00:07,00:00:11,"The song is called ""Horoi Wa Wa Wa Ka Sibe"""
00:00:11,00:00:16,"Hello and welcome to another episode of ""No Such Thing as a Fish"""
00:00:16,00:00:20,"A weekly podcast, this week coming to you live, from Bustapal!"
00:00:20,00:00:29,My name is Dan Schreiber and I am sitting here with Anna Chazinski
00:00:29,00:00:31,Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin
00:00:31,00:00:35,and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts
00:00:35,00:00:40,"from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go!"
00:00:40,00:00:43,Starting with fact number one and that's my fact this week
00:00:43,00:00:49,My fact is the 95-year-old billionaire who controls Viacom and CBS
00:00:49,00:00:54,now communicates via an iPad preloaded with audio clips
00:00:54,00:01:02,"His choices include ""Yes, No"" and ""Buck You"""
00:01:02,00:01:05,So how does this work? You're having a conversation with him
00:01:05,00:01:09,and rather than respond with his mouth then he responds by clicking a button
00:01:09,00:01:12,"He's a very old man now, he's 95 years old"
00:01:12,00:01:17,and his speaking has gone quite bad so his communication is very bad
00:01:17,00:01:22,so what they've done is they've helped him swear at people
00:01:22,00:01:25,with as much force via a button
00:01:25,00:01:29,"because he can't swallow, he has a problem with this throat"
00:01:29,00:01:33,"He is fed through a tube and he really, really likes steak and he wants to eat steak"
00:01:33,00:01:36,but they will never let him because he has this tube
00:01:36,00:01:40,and they say the only way he can get rid of his tube is if he conserves his energy
00:01:40,00:01:45,by reducing his sexual activity to once a week
00:01:45,00:01:48,And he refuses!
00:01:48,00:01:52,"Is he called Redstone? He is, he's called ""Sumner Redstone"""
00:01:52,00:01:56,"He's a very big media mogul, he has a lot of CBS and so on"
00:01:56,00:02:00,and things that are underneath that are like paramount pictures and so on
00:02:00,00:02:03,His family have a company which is the National Museum's Theodor Chain
00:02:03,00:02:05,and that's what that all sits underneath
00:02:05,00:02:08,He has a majority vote so he's the big dog really
00:02:08,00:02:10,so he's a very important guy
00:02:10,00:02:15,"and he kind of like, he's done a few things that have gone into pop culture"
00:02:15,00:02:18,Content is king is a thing he coined
00:02:18,00:02:23,That's what I mean that we're all supposed to know about
00:02:23,00:02:25,I think he would be very hurt by that comment
00:02:25,00:02:31,I don't know what he'd say
00:02:31,00:02:33,What is that?
00:02:33,00:02:36,"What is what? Content is king, you know, it's a saying"
00:02:36,00:02:39,"It's been said, it's not a very old saying"
00:02:39,00:02:43,"Sorry, you're saying he invented the non-existent catchphrase ""Content is king"""
00:02:43,00:02:46,Is this kind of shit he's been turning out? He's a billionaire
00:02:46,00:02:48,"Yeah, that's all you need to do apparently"
00:02:48,00:02:50,Just one catchphrase and you become a billionaire
00:02:50,00:02:53,"No, he's got a giant empire behind a real catchphrase"
00:02:53,00:02:56,"It's not like, nice to see you to see you, nice, is it?"
00:02:56,00:03:00,"Bringsie came out and shouted ""Content is king"""
00:03:00,00:03:03,He's not on TV yelling it
00:03:03,00:03:10,"Where is he behind the scenes? When is he saying ""Content is king"" and where it has become so famous?"
00:03:10,00:03:13,"He's saying it meetings when Bruce Forsythe's going, ""What do you think of?"""
00:03:13,00:03:14,"""We've got this great catchphrase, but I've got no show."""
00:03:14,00:03:18,"That's shit, content is king, that's when he's saying it"
00:03:18,00:03:22,"But the thing is, it's hard to know whether the fuck you, that he says, or the FU,"
00:03:22,00:03:27,"Let's stop swearing, the FU, is said as a mean thing or a nice thing"
00:03:27,00:03:31,"There was an interview with one of his advisors, a wealth advisor called Rebecca Rothstein"
00:03:31,00:03:37,"She said, ""I've only been the recipient of an FU once. I think he meant it in an endearing way."""
00:03:37,00:03:44,"It's all to do with how he presses the bus on, I suppose, to take your cue from things like that"
00:03:44,00:03:50,Was he known for being a particularly bad boss? Is this something he uses a lot this button?
00:03:50,00:03:55,"He's a big character, there's a lot of controversy in his personal life and his business life"
00:03:55,00:03:58,"It's hard to say, don't know the guy, but yeah"
00:03:58,00:04:02,"We're talking about a billionaire, I don't want to say anything livalous, right?"
00:04:02,00:04:04,"Hey, it's an asshole, what are you going to do?"
00:04:04,00:04:06,I don't know what to do
00:04:06,00:04:11,"But all my researchers on asshole billionaires, so we're in trouble"
00:04:11,00:04:16,One guy who admits that he used to be a bad boss is Bill Gates
00:04:16,00:04:21,"I think he's got a much more cuddly image now, but when he was first working at Microsoft,"
00:04:21,00:04:26,"when he was first in charge of Microsoft, Bill Gates knew everyone's car license plates"
00:04:26,00:04:31,so he could look out into the car park and see when people were arriving and leaving from their work
00:04:31,00:04:35,and he only stopped doing that when the company got so big that he could not physically remember
00:04:35,00:04:36,everyone's license plates again
00:04:36,00:04:40,If only you could come up with a system of putting letters and numbers in a big file
00:04:40,00:04:52,I was actually reading a thing in the Guardian
00:04:52,00:04:57,where they ask people to write in and say examples of bad bosses and what they've made them do
00:04:57,00:05:01,and one of them may have been a Bill Gates employee because one of these people wrote in and said
00:05:01,00:05:06,"""My boss made us all park our cars facing the same direction for neatness in the car park."""
00:05:06,00:05:12,That same boss said that all of your buttons have to be made of pearls because plastic buttons
00:05:12,00:05:16,are ugly and then some other ... I don't think this is Bill Gates
00:05:16,00:05:19,"No, I don't think that is Bill Gates, that would be like this"
00:05:19,00:05:22,"they do call him ""perly Gates"" so maybe that's why"
00:05:22,00:05:24,"There you go, yeah that's why"
00:05:24,00:05:30,There was just in this list of things to the Guardian
00:05:30,00:05:33,these are some other things people have had to deal with with bad bosses
00:05:33,00:05:36,Someone wrote in and said that they got a round ribbon email from their boss saying
00:05:36,00:05:40,"""Please can everyone do their number two's before they come into the office"
00:05:40,00:05:42,"because I don't like going into the bathrooms and having them smell bad"""
00:05:42,00:05:45,So that's some advice from a boss
00:05:45,00:05:51,Another boss banned all paper clips because once he'd accidentally clip some sensitive material
00:05:51,00:05:54,to the back of someone's appraisal which they'd read
00:05:54,00:06:01,And another boss said that all equipment in the entire office needs to be clearly labeled by Friday
00:06:01,00:06:03,otherwise disciplinary action will be taken
00:06:03,00:06:06,and that included things like every single thing by Friday
00:06:06,00:06:10,"things like chair, light switch, door, floor and ceiling"
00:06:13,00:06:16,Someone had to get a step done around
00:06:16,00:06:20,I found a thing about how to be successful at work in relation to your boss
00:06:20,00:06:24,"Okay, so if you keep a religious symbol at your desk"
00:06:24,00:06:27,your boss is less likely to ask you to act unethically
00:06:27,00:06:29,and it can be a symbol from any religion
00:06:29,00:06:31,so there was a study of this in India
00:06:31,00:06:34,and if they found that their bosses put less pressure on them
00:06:34,00:06:38,to bend the rules or to be rude to other people
00:06:38,00:06:42,and it also works if you put a virtuous quotation at the end of your email
00:06:42,00:06:45,like better to fail with honor than succeed with fraud
00:06:45,00:06:52,But when you say it's getting them you ask them to do less fraudulent things
00:06:52,00:06:52,that what you said
00:06:52,00:06:55,is it not that you just spend less time talking to them
00:06:55,00:06:56,because you don't want to talk to them
00:06:56,00:06:57,so you ask them to do less things in-
00:06:57,00:06:58,Do you have maybe-
00:06:58,00:07:01,what because they've got an enormous crucifix
00:07:01,00:07:03,a six-foot tall crucifix about this
00:07:03,00:07:05,"Larry's a bit full on, isn't he?"
00:07:05,00:07:07,"I would give that person a wide berth, definitely"
00:07:07,00:07:09,How's this for a bad boss?
00:07:09,00:07:12,I'm not sure if we mentioned before George Pullman
00:07:12,00:07:13,have we mentioned him?
00:07:13,00:07:13,He made-
00:07:13,00:07:15,"Yeah, Ben Willey-Bot."
00:07:15,00:07:15,Ben Willey-Bot made train cars.
00:07:15,00:07:17,"I know he just made train cars, didn't he?"
00:07:17,00:07:19,"Yeah, he made train cars but he was a really, he was a terrible boss"
00:07:19,00:07:24,he ran basically he built a town for all of his employees to live in
00:07:24,00:07:27,"so he had schools and churches, he changed the money"
00:07:27,00:07:30,from American dollars to paying them in Pullman money
00:07:30,00:07:34,so it was just his own currency like he was the monopoly man
00:07:34,00:07:37,and yeah so he just took over their whole life.
00:07:37,00:07:37,Whoa.
00:07:37,00:07:38,"Yeah, yeah."
00:07:38,00:07:40,And then the thing about him is he was hated so much
00:07:40,00:07:43,that his family buried him under like three feet of concrete
00:07:43,00:07:45,because they thought someone would go after his cops.
00:07:45,00:07:47,"Oh, dear."
00:07:47,00:07:49,"This is a, I've got some advice if you can."
00:07:49,00:07:52,"Oh, but just be offering some times fun,"
00:07:52,00:07:53,how many comments I'm receiving?
00:07:53,00:07:55,"Oh, I'm not sure about that."
00:07:55,00:07:58,Oh dreadful.
00:07:58,00:08:00,"It's alright, it was dead."
00:08:00,00:08:02,I wouldn't have cared.
00:08:02,00:08:03,But there is...
00:08:03,00:08:07,There are some tips if you haven't really heard about...
00:08:07,00:08:09,"I'll do you to do the hoology at my funeral, Anna."
00:08:10,00:08:12,Do we like to this guy now?
00:08:12,00:08:13,He doesn't give a shit.
00:08:13,00:08:16,Do you know one thing that does work
00:08:16,00:08:19,is sticking a pin into a doll of your boss?
00:08:19,00:08:20,Oh.
00:08:20,00:08:21,So there's genuinely reduces...
00:08:21,00:08:22,What do you mean work?
00:08:22,00:08:26,I think they don't feel the injury wherever you put that down.
00:08:26,00:08:27,Sorry.
00:08:27,00:08:29,"That would be a hell of a fact, a pair of you wouldn't."
00:08:29,00:08:30,Who do works?
00:08:30,00:08:36,"If so, sorry, it works to reduce your anger at your boss."
00:08:36,00:08:37,"Oh, coming."
00:08:37,00:08:39,"Participants in this experiment, they were asked to remember"
00:08:39,00:08:42,"very specifically and clearly, a time that their boss had humiliated"
00:08:42,00:08:44,or blamed them when it wasn't their fault.
00:08:44,00:08:48,"And then they were asked to name a voodoo doll on the screen,"
00:08:48,00:08:50,on the computer in front of them.
00:08:50,00:08:52,"And some had to name it nobody,"
00:08:52,00:08:54,and others people could name it after their boss.
00:08:54,00:08:59,"And if you got the chance to do the damage to a doll named after your boss,"
00:08:59,00:09:03,you felt a much lower sense of injustice after it was all over.
00:09:03,00:09:07,"There's alternatives, because people do, I think, regrettably do stuff where they..."
00:09:07,00:09:09,"If they don't like their boss, they sense stuff."
00:09:09,00:09:11,"I was reading in America, there's a human resources director"
00:09:11,00:09:16,who's taking legal action to find out who wants her to eat a bag of dicks.
00:09:16,00:09:23,"Now, this is a company in America that sent, on request,"
00:09:23,00:09:26,gummy-shaped little penis-ish-ish-ish-ish-ish-ish.
00:09:26,00:09:36,"Sorry, not gummy-shaped penises. You need to see a doctor about that."
00:09:36,00:09:38,What a frightening company that would be.
00:09:38,00:09:42,"But yeah, they're called dicks by mail."
00:09:42,00:09:46,And what they do is you ask them to send a package to a boss or someone
00:09:46,00:09:48,relative that you don't like.
00:09:48,00:09:48,Right.
00:09:48,00:09:53,And she's trying to sue that company now to find out who had sent that to her.
00:09:53,00:09:55,"Yeah, because she was very upset."
00:09:55,00:09:58,"The company's website, if you go to it, it's so dicks by mail."
00:09:58,00:10:02,"And it markets itself as great way to tell your friends, family, loved ones,"
00:10:02,00:10:04,or enemies to eat a bag of dicks.
00:10:04,00:10:09,I actually have a related fact.
00:10:09,00:10:10,It's about eccentric millionaires.
00:10:10,00:10:14,Do you know what John Wayne bobbits is up to these days?
00:10:14,00:10:17,"Oh, so you remember him."
00:10:17,00:10:18,He was the one whose wife...
00:10:18,00:10:19,"Yeah, chopped off his stuff."
00:10:19,00:10:20,Chopped off his gummy.
00:10:20,00:10:21,Yeah.
00:10:23,00:10:25,I'm thrown out of the car.
00:10:25,00:10:27,"Well, he is now a treasure hunter."
00:10:27,00:10:30,He's not still looking for it.
00:10:30,00:10:37,He is looking for a chest of treasure.
00:10:37,00:10:42,And this is a chest of treasure that an eccentric art dealer has hidden
00:10:42,00:10:44,in the Rocky Mountains somewhere.
00:10:44,00:10:46,He's called Forrest Fenn.
00:10:46,00:10:49,"350,000 people have tried and failed to find this treasure."
00:10:49,00:10:51,"Wow, is it worth..."
00:10:51,00:10:52,Did you say it was worth a great deal?
00:10:52,00:10:53,"I didn't, but it is."
00:10:53,00:10:54,Okay.
00:10:54,00:10:56,It's probably...
00:10:56,00:10:58,It's worth about two million dollars.
00:10:58,00:11:00,And it's like jewels and stuff like that.
00:11:00,00:11:02,And he's hidden it somewhere.
00:11:02,00:11:03,And four people have died looking for it.
00:11:03,00:11:05,"Ooh, yeah."
00:11:05,00:11:06,It's very dangerous.
00:11:06,00:11:10,"One bad boss was the guy who ran Mars, Forrest Mars Senior."
00:11:10,00:11:12,He invented the Milky Way and Eminem.
00:11:12,00:11:13,So he's quite a big deal.
00:11:13,00:11:18,"But when new managers came, he would make them sign a resignation letter"
00:11:18,00:11:19,on their first day.
00:11:19,00:11:20,What?
00:11:20,00:11:21,"Oh, and then just in case."
00:11:21,00:11:23,"And just in case so, he had it."
00:11:23,00:11:25,"In case they didn't reach their targets, he'd be able to say,"
00:11:25,00:11:28,"""Well, now you're going to give me your resignation."""
00:11:28,00:11:29,"That's pretty bad, isn't it?"
00:11:29,00:11:30,So it is bad.
00:11:30,00:11:32,"In a meeting once, he made his youngest son"
00:11:32,00:11:34,pray for the firm on his knees for an hour.
00:11:34,00:11:39,"When you said he ran Mars, I thought you meant he ran..."
00:11:39,00:11:41,"I didn't think anyone ran Mars, but no."
00:11:41,00:11:44,You mean the planet?
00:11:44,00:11:45,"Yeah, exactly."
00:11:45,00:11:46,But you mean the chocolate firm.
00:11:46,00:11:48,He says chocolate is king.
00:11:48,00:11:49,It's a catchphrase.
00:11:49,00:11:51,LAUGHTER
00:11:51,00:11:53,"OK, it is time for fact number two."
00:11:53,00:11:55,And that is Chazinski.
00:11:55,00:11:59,"My fact this week is that before scarecrow's were straw dummies,"
00:11:59,00:12:00,they were living children.
00:12:00,00:12:02,Wow.
00:12:02,00:12:05,So you're not saying every single scarecrow that you see
00:12:05,00:12:07,"used to be a living child, eh?"
00:12:07,00:12:10,And then a powerful witch came across that.
00:12:10,00:12:11,LAUGHTER
00:12:11,00:12:12,I'm not saying that.
00:12:12,00:12:13,That's how stuck in the mud came about.
00:12:13,00:12:15,"If you actually run under a scarecrow's legs,"
00:12:15,00:12:16,it turns back into a child.
00:12:16,00:12:17,That's true.
00:12:17,00:12:20,"But don't do it, because that child is angry by this point."
00:12:20,00:12:21,LAUGHTER
00:12:21,00:12:22,"No, that's not the fact."
00:12:22,00:12:23,That would be amazing.
00:12:23,00:12:27,This is the fact that the way that people scared birds away
00:12:27,00:12:28,from their farms in year-olden days
00:12:28,00:12:30,were just by employing kids to do it.
00:12:30,00:12:33,And the first use of the word scarecrow
00:12:33,00:12:36,to refer to someone that scares a bird was in 1553.
00:12:36,00:12:39,And that referred to children who had the job of doing it.
00:12:39,00:12:42,And then in 1592 came the idea of the stuffed dummy.
00:12:42,00:12:44,"But until the late 19th century,"
00:12:44,00:12:46,"and I think into the early 20th century,"
00:12:46,00:12:47,then kids were just employed to do this.
00:12:47,00:12:49,And it was quite a common job.
00:12:49,00:12:52,"You know how you got a job doing a milk ground or something,"
00:12:52,00:12:53,or working in a cafe as a kid.
00:12:53,00:12:55,The equivalent of that in the Victorian era
00:12:55,00:12:58,was standing in a field and scaring away birds.
00:12:58,00:13:01,And the reason that they stopped having children there
00:13:01,00:13:03,is because the factories started opening
00:13:03,00:13:04,and they could pay the children more.
00:13:04,00:13:06,"Mmm, yeah."
00:13:06,00:13:07,And the factories could pay the children more?
00:13:07,00:13:08,Yeah.
00:13:08,00:13:11,So the children decided to work in the factories instead.
00:13:11,00:13:12,"Well, I'm not sure they had much say in the matter."
00:13:12,00:13:13,I'm not saying.
00:13:13,00:13:15,But they worked in the factories instead.
00:13:15,00:13:18,And also the reason that the scarecrow's came in
00:13:18,00:13:19,is because of the plague.
00:13:19,00:13:21,The plague killed so many people
00:13:21,00:13:23,that there weren't enough children to go round
00:13:23,00:13:25,and so they had to make the scarecrow's instead.
00:13:25,00:13:26,"Oh, really?"
00:13:26,00:13:26,Yeah.
00:13:26,00:13:27,It wasn't a terrible gig.
00:13:27,00:13:30,I read that in the 1800s.
00:13:30,00:13:33,"If you were, for instance, a child scarecrow in Winchkem,"
00:13:33,00:13:36,you would be paid a penny per day plus a suite.
00:13:36,00:13:40,By which you mean the vegetable?
00:13:40,00:13:41,"No, a Swedish person."
00:13:41,00:13:42,We had a surplus there.
00:13:42,00:13:44,[LAUGHTER]
00:13:44,00:13:46,There's only one celebrity scarecrow
00:13:46,00:13:49,"that I've found in history, who is, you know,"
00:13:49,00:13:51,"the Thomas Hardy book, Jude the Obscure."
00:13:51,00:13:52,Yeah.
00:13:52,00:13:54,Jude the Obscure used to be a scarecrow as a child.
00:13:54,00:13:56,"Oh my god, I totally forgot that, really."
00:13:56,00:13:57,"I'd forgotten it, too."
00:13:57,00:13:58,Wow.
00:13:58,00:14:00,It's not a real celebrity.
00:14:00,00:14:01,It's not-- it's not going to trouble heat magazine
00:14:01,00:14:03,any time soon.
00:14:03,00:14:05,"I mean, I would say a bigger celebrity scarecrow"
00:14:05,00:14:07,is the scarecrow from the Wizard of Oz.
00:14:07,00:14:09,Yes.
00:14:09,00:14:09,Yes.
00:14:09,00:14:10,That's true.
00:14:10,00:14:11,So there are two.
00:14:11,00:14:13,"Well, actually, just quickly on the scarecrow"
00:14:13,00:14:16,"from the Wizard of Oz, I was reading about him today."
00:14:16,00:14:19,"And it turns out that in the original books,"
00:14:19,00:14:21,he doesn't actually lack a brain.
00:14:21,00:14:24,"In reality, when she meets him, he's only two days old"
00:14:24,00:14:26,and just really ignorant.
00:14:26,00:14:26,"Oh, yeah."
00:14:26,00:14:28,So he actually has a brain.
00:14:28,00:14:31,"And then in the movie itself, if you all remember"
00:14:31,00:14:33,"that great moment where the wizard does give him a brain,"
00:14:33,00:14:36,he suddenly recites Pythagorean Theorem.
00:14:36,00:14:40,And he states that it applies to an isosceles triangle.
00:14:40,00:14:41,That's not correct.
00:14:41,00:14:42,"No, obviously, it's a right-angle triangle."
00:14:42,00:14:45,What the fuck is he talking about?
00:14:45,00:14:49,"I mean, he's only had a brain for like 10 seconds."
00:14:49,00:14:50,I would have loved to have been in the cinema
00:14:50,00:14:54,with you as a kid watching that.
00:14:54,00:14:55,That's actually the character of the scarecrow.
00:14:55,00:14:57,So it was played by Guy called Ray Bulger
00:14:57,00:14:59,in the original Wizard of Oz.
00:14:59,00:15:02,But it was supposed to be played by a guy called Body Epson.
00:15:02,00:15:04,"And if you look this man up, Body Epson"
00:15:04,00:15:05,was-- he was six with three.
00:15:05,00:15:06,He was incredibly skinny.
00:15:06,00:15:08,And he looks exactly like a scarecrow.
00:15:08,00:15:10,His whole face is scarecrow-like.
00:15:10,00:15:13,"And so the people making the film thought, this is our guy."
00:15:13,00:15:15,"He's an actor, looks like a scarecrow."
00:15:15,00:15:17,And then they decided to cast this guy called Ray Bulger
00:15:17,00:15:18,as the Tin Man.
00:15:18,00:15:20,Little did they know that Ray Bulger
00:15:20,00:15:21,had been inspired to act when he'd
00:15:21,00:15:23,seen a production of the Wizard of Oz.
00:15:23,00:15:27,And he'd seen the scarecrow leap up through a haystack
00:15:27,00:15:28,off a trampoline.
00:15:28,00:15:30,"And seeing that scarecrow made him think,"
00:15:30,00:15:34,"one day, I must play the scarecrow in the Wizard of Oz."
00:15:34,00:15:37,"And so he was cast as the Tin Man, and he was pissed off."
00:15:37,00:15:38,He loves to be.
00:15:38,00:15:39,He insisted.
00:15:39,00:15:41,"And they said, no, no, we're not going to let you."
00:15:41,00:15:43,We've got this guy who looks like a scarecrow.
00:15:43,00:15:45,And the guy who looked like the scarecrow was practicing
00:15:45,00:15:47,the lines and was being taught the dances.
00:15:47,00:15:49,And eventually Bulger just wore them down
00:15:49,00:15:51,"and said, I will be the scarecrow."
00:15:51,00:15:53,It's my life's mission.
00:15:53,00:15:54,And he was a scarecrow.
00:15:54,00:15:57,"So that's-- if you could see inside the Tin Man,"
00:15:57,00:15:58,he looks like a scarecrow.
00:15:58,00:15:59,But do you know the Tin Man swaps?
00:15:59,00:16:00,"Yeah, the Tin Man swaps."
00:16:00,00:16:01,There's one.
00:16:01,00:16:03,"No, no, no, no, no, this is what I'm saying."
00:16:03,00:16:05,"No, no, no, what happened was they swapped."
00:16:05,00:16:07,"So they were like, OK, we're still in the movie."
00:16:07,00:16:07,This is fine.
00:16:07,00:16:09,And the guy who was the original scarecrow
00:16:09,00:16:10,was now the Tin Man.
00:16:10,00:16:13,But he got allergic to all of the paint that was put on him.
00:16:13,00:16:14,Couldn't do the job.
00:16:14,00:16:15,So he got fired.
00:16:15,00:16:16,He's not in the Wizard of Oz.
00:16:16,00:16:17,He's not there.
00:16:17,00:16:18,He lost his job.
00:16:18,00:16:20,They should have given him lion.
00:16:20,00:16:21,I don't think that's how it worked.
00:16:21,00:16:23,I don't think there was just a--
00:16:23,00:16:24,He was also allergic to cats.
00:16:24,00:16:27,[LAUGHTER]
00:16:27,00:16:31,"There are cool old words for scarecrowes, which I never knew."
00:16:31,00:16:34,"In Old English, they were called a free bogard."
00:16:34,00:16:34,Nice.
00:16:34,00:16:35,Which is a good--
00:16:35,00:16:36,"Oh, yeah."
00:16:36,00:16:37,Really?
00:16:37,00:16:38,We still call it that round here.
00:16:38,00:16:39,Yeah.
00:16:39,00:16:40,[LAUGHTER]
00:16:40,00:16:41,Polyviz.
00:16:41,00:16:43,I don't know how we're talking about it.
00:16:43,00:16:44,What the hell is this scarecrow?
00:16:44,00:16:47,"Well, let's try a couple of others, then."
00:16:47,00:16:49,Potato Bogal?
00:16:49,00:16:51,"Ah, got you there."
00:16:51,00:16:52,"Potato Bogal, which was--"
00:16:52,00:16:55,"That hasn't got here yet, that one."
00:16:55,00:16:56,Or a Tati Bogal.
00:16:56,00:16:57,I think Tati Bogal has got it.
00:16:57,00:16:58,"Potato Bogal, sorry."
00:16:58,00:17:00,"Potato Bogal, if you're from Oxbridge, obviously."
00:17:00,00:17:03,"But Tati Bogal, for the rest of us."
00:17:03,00:17:06,"I was reading that, though, in 1989,"
00:17:06,00:17:08,they were testing new scarecrow ideas.
00:17:08,00:17:09,"And there was one exciting one, which"
00:17:09,00:17:12,was a scarecrow that I think must have been laying back
00:17:12,00:17:16,"because every now and then, a propane cannon would lob it up."
00:17:16,00:17:17,"Oh, yeah."
00:17:17,00:17:19,"No, these are still sold."
00:17:19,00:17:19,And it really works.
00:17:19,00:17:21,"It really scares away the birds, because suddenly--"
00:17:21,00:17:22,Boo!
00:17:22,00:17:23,[LAUGHTER]
00:17:23,00:17:24,"Yeah, Tati goes."
00:17:24,00:17:27,I read one more bit of scarecrow technology.
00:17:27,00:17:30,"In Australia, they have AI scarecrowes."
00:17:30,00:17:32,"Although we've been in the West country for two days now,"
00:17:32,00:17:38,"and I've realized around here, AI stands for artificial insemination."
00:17:38,00:17:39,We learned that last night.
00:17:39,00:17:40,We didn't learn that last night.
00:17:40,00:17:41,We learned that last night.
00:17:41,00:17:44,[LAUGHTER]
00:17:44,00:17:46,And we mean the hard way.
00:17:46,00:17:50,[LAUGHTER]
00:17:50,00:17:53,"Yeah, they have this-- it's kind of like a box."
00:17:53,00:17:56,But what the box can do is it can recognize
00:17:56,00:17:57,what animals can come towards it.
00:17:57,00:18:00,And it can make species-dependent noises.
00:18:00,00:18:01,That's cool.
00:18:01,00:18:03,"Yeah, so they know what crows don't like,"
00:18:03,00:18:04,and they know what geese don't like.
00:18:04,00:18:05,"And all these different things, they"
00:18:05,00:18:06,can make different sounds.
00:18:06,00:18:08,And the main problem with scarecrowes
00:18:08,00:18:10,is they get used to whatever's trying to scare them.
00:18:10,00:18:12,The crows get used to it.
00:18:12,00:18:14,And so this is-- they can change it all the time.
00:18:14,00:18:17,We're going to have to move on to our next facts.
00:18:17,00:18:18,Should we move on?
00:18:18,00:18:20,"Well, I found one article in the Metro."
00:18:20,00:18:24,"It was entitled, ""Is this the world's most useless scarecrow?"""
00:18:24,00:18:26,And it was a picture of a scarecrow that was completely
00:18:26,00:18:29,covered in bird poo.
00:18:29,00:18:31,And it had a nest of five chicks tuts on his jacket.
00:18:31,00:18:35,[LAUGHTER]
00:18:35,00:18:38,"OK, it is time for fact number three."
00:18:38,00:18:40,And that is Andy.
00:18:40,00:18:44,My fact is that the first ever leisure caravan
00:18:44,00:18:46,had a man on a tricycle going ahead of it
00:18:46,00:18:49,to check that the roads were good enough.
00:18:49,00:18:53,So caravans were traditional mode of transport
00:18:53,00:18:55,for a long time before they were used for leisure.
00:18:55,00:18:58,And then I found this on a blog by a guy
00:18:58,00:19:00,"called Eugene Bern, which is a great blog."
00:19:00,00:19:01,I do recommend it.
00:19:01,00:19:03,And it was all about the guy who invented
00:19:03,00:19:05,recreational caravanning.
00:19:05,00:19:08,He was a guy called William Gordon Stables.
00:19:08,00:19:10,And he was alive in the second half of the 19th century
00:19:10,00:19:13,until 1910.
00:19:13,00:19:15,And he was a crazy guy.
00:19:15,00:19:19,He wrote for the boy's own paper to advise to boys.
00:19:19,00:19:20,And most of the things he recommended
00:19:20,00:19:22,were cold baths and hot porridge and long walks.
00:19:22,00:19:23,And he said that kind of sorts you out.
00:19:23,00:19:27,And so he wanted to have an adventure.
00:19:27,00:19:30,So he commissioned a wagon company in Bristol
00:19:30,00:19:34,to build this beautiful thing that he called the wanderer.
00:19:34,00:19:36,And it's really ornate.
00:19:36,00:19:38,It's made of mahogany.
00:19:38,00:19:40,"It had a paraffin oven, it had a bookcase,"
00:19:40,00:19:43,"velvet lined furniture, lots of musical instruments."
00:19:43,00:19:45,He kept a pistol in it as well.
00:19:45,00:19:46,I do not know why.
00:19:46,00:19:48,"And he went on adventures, but--"
00:19:48,00:19:52,"But yeah, I think he called it a land yacht."
00:19:52,00:19:54,And it was the land yacht wanderer.
00:19:54,00:19:56,And he was an interesting guy.
00:19:56,00:19:58,"The other thing, he did, he had a real passion"
00:19:58,00:20:01,"for dogs and cats, this guy, William Gordon Stables."
00:20:01,00:20:03,And he wrote a load of books in his life.
00:20:03,00:20:07,And he either wrote books about how boys could survive
00:20:07,00:20:09,"in the wild, you know, like cat camping,"
00:20:09,00:20:10,"like boys, out of style books."
00:20:10,00:20:12,All he wrote books about how to keep dogs and cats.
00:20:12,00:20:15,He wrote a book called The Domestic Cat and The Dog
00:20:15,00:20:17,from Puppey Hood to Age.
00:20:17,00:20:17,Yeah.
00:20:17,00:20:20,"And then on top of that, he wrote medical life in the Navy."
00:20:20,00:20:22,Wild adventures in wild places.
00:20:22,00:20:26,And his last book was called The Sauciest Boy in the Service.
00:20:26,00:20:27,"Oh, wow."
00:20:27,00:20:29,And I looked into that.
00:20:29,00:20:31,It's not what you think.
00:20:31,00:20:33,"The word sassy just used to mean cheeky, didn't it?"
00:20:33,00:20:34,"Oh, OK."
00:20:34,00:20:38,"I think he was Scottish as well, because he loved dogs and cats,"
00:20:38,00:20:39,and he wrote a load about them.
00:20:39,00:20:42,And he would frequently turn up at dog cat and agricultural shows
00:20:42,00:20:44,usually in full-highland dress.
00:20:44,00:20:45,Yeah.
00:20:45,00:20:47,So he's quite a character.
00:20:47,00:20:50,And his thing with the whole tricycle was that he--
00:20:50,00:20:53,so the caravan was horse-drawn.
00:20:53,00:20:56,He had two horses that were taking them forward.
00:20:56,00:21:00,They were called Captain Cornflower and Polly P. Blossom.
00:21:00,00:21:03,And they would both be going down.
00:21:03,00:21:06,But the man servant that he had on the tricycle
00:21:06,00:21:08,"who was called Foley, he was both checking"
00:21:08,00:21:11,that the road surfaces were OK for him to go on.
00:21:11,00:21:13,"But also in case anything was in the way, he would say,"
00:21:13,00:21:15,get off the road.
00:21:15,00:21:16,There's a caravan coming.
00:21:16,00:21:17,And I never went--
00:21:17,00:21:19,What's a caravan?
00:21:19,00:21:21,"Yeah, it's true, yeah."
00:21:21,00:21:22,I guess it was a new thing.
00:21:22,00:21:24,"Well, we should say it wasn't a new thing."
00:21:24,00:21:28,So the caravan had existed as a way to travel and for circuses
00:21:28,00:21:32,"and travelers for a long time, thousands of years, really."
00:21:32,00:21:36,"But the idea of using caravans for leisure, which some people"
00:21:36,00:21:37,would say is an idea that should have
00:21:37,00:21:42,"been nixed at the first, second, but he was the first person"
00:21:42,00:21:42,to do that.
00:21:42,00:21:44,And the early ones were really luxurious.
00:21:44,00:21:46,It was a thing that the upper classes did.
00:21:46,00:21:48,And they would be one of the few holidays
00:21:48,00:21:49,that you could take where you'd have running water.
00:21:49,00:21:52,They had running water in the turn of the 20th century.
00:21:52,00:21:55,"They would have libraries, full libraries."
00:21:55,00:21:57,Some of them had pianos in them.
00:21:57,00:21:59,And the pioneers of caravan in called themselves
00:21:59,00:22:01,gentlemen gypsies.
00:22:01,00:22:04,"And they were always horse-drawn, except just coming up"
00:22:04,00:22:07,to World War I. Then the motor car
00:22:07,00:22:08,had been invented by this point.
00:22:08,00:22:11,But it wasn't quite strong enough to pull most caravans.
00:22:11,00:22:15,But a few people experimented with motor cars pulling caravans.
00:22:15,00:22:18,And they were very much frowned upon as like too fast-paced.
00:22:18,00:22:20,This isn't what caravan is about.
00:22:20,00:22:23,"You can still get some really posh caravans,"
00:22:23,00:22:25,really expensive ones with lots of great stuff in.
00:22:25,00:22:28,The element palazzo is the world's most expensive caravan.
00:22:28,00:22:29,It costs about 2 million pounds.
00:22:29,00:22:31,2 million pounds.
00:22:31,00:22:31,Yep.
00:22:31,00:22:33,Go on.
00:22:33,00:22:36,"It has a rooftop terrace, underfloor heating,"
00:22:36,00:22:38,and a pop-up cocktail bar.
00:22:38,00:22:40,"Pop-up cocktail, pop-up bar."
00:22:40,00:22:44,"But really, very pleasantly, it's known as the land yacht."
00:22:44,00:22:45,Really?
00:22:45,00:22:47,He saved us the first ever one.
00:22:47,00:22:48,"It's interesting, isn't it, marketing's very clever?"
00:22:48,00:22:50,"Because if you analyse those three things,"
00:22:50,00:22:52,a rooftop terrace is just a route.
00:22:52,00:22:54,It doesn't mean you can get onto the roof.
00:22:54,00:22:57,"Underfloor heating, not super impressive, right?"
00:22:57,00:22:59,You put a radiator on the floor.
00:22:59,00:23:00,And a pop-up cocktail bar.
00:23:00,00:23:02,That's just a table.
00:23:02,00:23:05,That's just a foldable table.
00:23:05,00:23:09,I just need to go and get my 2 million pounds back.
00:23:09,00:23:12,There was a panic in 2014 about caravan holidays
00:23:12,00:23:15,and people thought that there were sleeping gas gangs
00:23:15,00:23:17,who would go around and they'd drop a sleeping gas canister
00:23:17,00:23:19,through the window of your caravan.
00:23:19,00:23:21,So then you'd be unconscious.
00:23:21,00:23:22,They'd knock you out and then they'd come in
00:23:22,00:23:25,and they'd rob your caravan of all its stuff.
00:23:25,00:23:27,"Well, they'd take the pop-up bar"
00:23:27,00:23:31,and they'd rip the radiator from under the floor.
00:23:31,00:23:36,But it seems to have been a completely fabricated thing.
00:23:36,00:23:38,So the Royal College of Anesthetists got involved.
00:23:38,00:23:42,And they said there were dozens of newspaper stories
00:23:42,00:23:44,about these sleeping gas gangs operating in France
00:23:44,00:23:47,"and Italy, I think, on, you know, innocent British tourists"
00:23:47,00:23:49,who were taking the caravan around.
00:23:49,00:23:50,And they said it is the view of the college
00:23:50,00:23:52,that it would not be possible to render someone unconscious
00:23:52,00:23:55,by blowing ether chloroform or any of the others
00:23:55,00:23:57,through the window of a motorhome without their knowledge.
00:23:57,00:24:00,Ether is extremely pungent and it would cause coughing
00:24:00,00:24:01,and sometimes vomiting.
00:24:01,00:24:03,"And it takes some time to reach unconsciousness,"
00:24:03,00:24:05,even if given by direct application
00:24:05,00:24:07,to the face on a cloth.
00:24:07,00:24:09,So they said it just doesn't happen.
00:24:09,00:24:13,If you were going to rob people and you would think
00:24:13,00:24:16,where do people store their most valuable possessions?
00:24:16,00:24:18,Should we rob a mansion?
00:24:18,00:24:19,Should we rob a castle?
00:24:19,00:24:24,"No, I think every pop over to one of those haven caravan sides."
00:24:24,00:24:26,Try and render those guys unconscious
00:24:26,00:24:28,or get a couple of bottles of cider.
00:24:28,00:24:31,"I mean, it doesn't make any sense at all."
00:24:31,00:24:35,I read just an article that was sent to the Royal Society
00:24:35,00:24:39,in 1957 and it was about the history of the caravan
00:24:39,00:24:43,and it was done by the head of the caravan society.
00:24:43,00:24:47,"And he was talking about the fact that they had their caravans,"
00:24:47,00:24:49,but people were really against caravans for a little while.
00:24:49,00:24:52,He said conservative elements that feel their own interest
00:24:52,00:24:56,threatened and fear it have accused followers of caravans
00:24:56,00:25:00,of every sin from leaving litter and stealing chickens
00:25:00,00:25:04,to sexual promiscuity and spying.
00:25:04,00:25:06,Spying?
00:25:06,00:25:07,"All right, 007."
00:25:07,00:25:10,This isn't going to be your most glamorous gig yet.
00:25:10,00:25:13,"OK, it is time for our final fact of the show."
00:25:13,00:25:15,And that is James.
00:25:15,00:25:18,"OK, my fact this week is that the gravity on Mars's smallest moon"
00:25:18,00:25:21,"is so weak that if you built a ramp on it,"
00:25:21,00:25:24,you could ride your bike into space.
00:25:24,00:25:26,So you escape the--
00:25:26,00:25:28,"You escape, yeah, you're going to escape velocity"
00:25:28,00:25:30,and you can fly into space.
00:25:30,00:25:33,You wouldn't really want to ride a bike there
00:25:33,00:25:35,because you probably wouldn't be able to ride
00:25:35,00:25:37,because you need gravity to ride bikes.
00:25:37,00:25:39,So you can kind of-- they've done experiments
00:25:39,00:25:41,where they have bikes which kind of--
00:25:41,00:25:44,they're built to make it look like there's no gravity
00:25:44,00:25:45,to make you feel like there's no gravity.
00:25:45,00:25:47,"And they found that people can balance,"
00:25:47,00:25:49,but they can't turn and they can't use the brakes.
00:25:49,00:25:51,On Mars.
00:25:51,00:25:55,That's in any kind of anti-gravity situation.
00:25:55,00:25:56,We haven't-- not on Mars.
00:25:56,00:25:59,We haven't got people to Mars just for the sake
00:25:59,00:26:01,of doing this bike experiment.
00:26:01,00:26:03,I'm going to cover up that with me.
00:26:03,00:26:04,"And also, this isn't Mars."
00:26:04,00:26:09,"This is the smallest moon, which is called Demos."
00:26:09,00:26:10,"Demos, Demos."
00:26:10,00:26:14,And it is one 50 million times as big as the moon.
00:26:14,00:26:16,"So really, really small."
00:26:16,00:26:19,"It's radius is about four miles, so you could run a marathon"
00:26:19,00:26:21,round its equator and have the finishing line
00:26:21,00:26:24,pretty much where the starting line was.
00:26:24,00:26:27,"And because it's so small, the gravity is really weak."
00:26:27,00:26:31,So I would weigh about the same as a teaspoon of salt.
00:26:31,00:26:33,"Just on bikes not going into space,"
00:26:33,00:26:36,"actually, there was a plan that we were going to send bikes"
00:26:36,00:26:39,"with one of the Apollo missions, because yeah,"
00:26:39,00:26:42,the lunar buggy wasn't going to be ready in time.
00:26:42,00:26:45,Apollo 15 actually tested out bikes
00:26:45,00:26:46,that they could take to the moon.
00:26:46,00:26:51,"This is electric bikes, as opposed to pedaling bikes,"
00:26:51,00:26:52,although that was suggested as well.
00:26:52,00:26:54,"You couldn't pedal in a space suit, though, presumably."
00:26:54,00:26:55,"Presumably, yes."
00:26:55,00:26:58,Although someone did do a tandem quadra bike
00:26:58,00:27:00,that they wanted to send up there as well.
00:27:00,00:27:01,And they actually got close to the testing.
00:27:01,00:27:03,They actually brought them up into a vomit rocket
00:27:03,00:27:06,so that they could experience what it was like to pedal a bike
00:27:06,00:27:09,"while plummeting back to the Earth and experiencing one,"
00:27:09,00:27:13,"what is it, one 16th or one 6th of the Earth's gravity?"
00:27:13,00:27:13,Yeah.
00:27:13,00:27:14,Wait.
00:27:14,00:27:16,So I think they thought that maybe they
00:27:16,00:27:18,wouldn't have time to get the vehicles ready.
00:27:18,00:27:19,And so they'd have to send bikes instead.
00:27:19,00:27:21,"Because if you were going into space and they said,"
00:27:21,00:27:23,"I'm sorry, we haven't had time to rig up the stuff we"
00:27:23,00:27:25,"meant to, do you mind bringing your bicycle?"
00:27:25,00:27:27,I would just say--
00:27:27,00:27:29,I don't think I'm going to do this mission down the out.
00:27:29,00:27:30,That's true.
00:27:30,00:27:33,I don't think you guys have thought enough about this.
00:27:33,00:27:36,"Well, so imagine if they got there with Neil Armstrong"
00:27:36,00:27:39,and he just hits a rock and leaps off into it.
00:27:39,00:27:41,"We've lost Neil, he's--"
00:27:41,00:27:44,"You know, you could run off the surface of this moon as well,"
00:27:44,00:27:45,if you wanted to.
00:27:45,00:27:49,So you just have to reach a speed of about 12.5 miles an hour.
00:27:49,00:27:51,"So if we were all stuck there, that's kind of the maximum"
00:27:51,00:27:54,that a kind of fit person could sprint.
00:27:54,00:27:56,So the fit ones could get off it.
00:27:56,00:27:58,And then the really unfit ones would
00:27:58,00:27:59,be stuck on the moon.
00:27:59,00:28:00,"Yeah, but neither is ideal."
00:28:00,00:28:03,"I mean, both of you are all going to die of solar radiation"
00:28:03,00:28:04,and exposure and--
00:28:04,00:28:05,Yeah.
00:28:05,00:28:07,"It's not a dream world for anyone, no?"
00:28:07,00:28:12,"Gravity is different places on Earth, which I didn't know."
00:28:12,00:28:14,So this is about gravity being different in different places.
00:28:14,00:28:18,So there's a place which has got the lowest gravity
00:28:18,00:28:21,is just south of Sri Lanka in the Indian Ocean.
00:28:21,00:28:25,But there is a fact that Peru's gravity is also extremely
00:28:25,00:28:26,"low, there's an area of Peru."
00:28:26,00:28:30,"And the Arctic's gravity, I think, is quite high."
00:28:30,00:28:34,"So if you fell from exactly 100 meters all over the Earth,"
00:28:34,00:28:36,they've done simulations on this.
00:28:36,00:28:38,They have not tested it for real.
00:28:38,00:28:40,"If you would drop from 100 meters high all over the Earth,"
00:28:40,00:28:44,you would hit the surface in Peru 16 milliseconds later
00:28:44,00:28:46,"than in the Arctic, because the gravity is different."
00:28:46,00:28:49,"I mean, it's not much different, isn't it?"
00:28:49,00:28:52,A bit more of your life would flash before your eyes.
00:28:52,00:28:55,Because there's a moon of Uranus called Miranda.
00:28:55,00:29:00,And it has an 11 mile high cliff on it called Verona Rupees.
00:29:00,00:29:03,"And the peak is so high, and the gravity is so low"
00:29:03,00:29:06,"that if you fell off it, you would fall for 12 minutes"
00:29:06,00:29:08,before hitting the ground.
00:29:08,00:29:10,"That's a lot of life flashing before your eyes, isn't it?"
00:29:10,00:29:13,"There is an app you can get, which is called High Jump,"
00:29:13,00:29:15,which can tell you how high you would be able to jump
00:29:15,00:29:19,on various different planets and moons of our solar system.
00:29:19,00:29:20,What a vital app.
00:29:20,00:29:22,Yeah.
00:29:22,00:29:25,This is made by astronomers Stuart Lowe and Chris North.
00:29:25,00:29:28,"And so they tell you, for example, if you jumped on the moon,"
00:29:28,00:29:30,"you could jump three meters, 10 feet off the ground."
00:29:30,00:29:32,You'd be in the air for about four seconds.
00:29:32,00:29:35,"On Mars, it would be three feet for two seconds."
00:29:35,00:29:39,"But the sixth largest moon of Saturn,"
00:29:39,00:29:41,"you could jump, if you did your average jump,"
00:29:41,00:29:44,you would go up 42.6 meters.
00:29:44,00:29:46,And you would float back down and you would land
00:29:46,00:29:48,with the same force that you did if you did the jump on Earth.
00:29:48,00:29:50,So it wouldn't crush you.
00:29:50,00:29:53,And it would take roughly a full minute to go up and down
00:29:53,00:29:54,with that jump.
00:29:54,00:29:59,"Well, I think, to be honest, I think this moon, Dimas,"
00:29:59,00:30:01,is pretty much the exact perfect one
00:30:01,00:30:03,if you want to jump as high as you possibly can.
00:30:03,00:30:06,"Because if the gravity was any less there,"
00:30:06,00:30:07,then you would just float away.
00:30:07,00:30:09,But you can just about not.
00:30:09,00:30:12,But do you know the story of how Mars's moons were discovered?
00:30:12,00:30:13,No.
00:30:13,00:30:16,"So they were discovered by a guy called Asaf Hall,"
00:30:16,00:30:18,which is a very weird name.
00:30:18,00:30:19,But this was in 1876.
00:30:19,00:30:22,And he really thought that Mars probably
00:30:22,00:30:26,"had a couple of moons, which it does, or some moons."
00:30:26,00:30:27,And so he had this telescope.
00:30:27,00:30:30,"And he wanted-- he was looking through this telescope,"
00:30:30,00:30:32,looking closer and closer to Mars.
00:30:32,00:30:34,And so the thing about the Mars and moons
00:30:34,00:30:36,is they're very close to the planet itself.
00:30:36,00:30:38,And he got really close to this telescope.
00:30:38,00:30:40,And the glare from Mars was getting too much.
00:30:40,00:30:43,"And he was like, no, there clearly aren't any moons there."
00:30:43,00:30:45,And he went home away from his observatory.
00:30:45,00:30:47,"And he went home to his wife, who was a woman"
00:30:47,00:30:49,called Angeline Stickney.
00:30:49,00:30:52,"And he said, no moon can possibly exist here."
00:30:52,00:30:54,"The thing about Angeline, his wife,"
00:30:54,00:30:57,is that she had been his mass teacher at university.
00:30:57,00:30:59,And she was very good at calculations like this.
00:30:59,00:31:01,"And while he'd been there looking for the moon,"
00:31:01,00:31:05,she'd done the calculations of how close a moon could be
00:31:05,00:31:07,"to Mars and said, no, I've worked it out."
00:31:07,00:31:09,It's going to be closer than anyone thinks
00:31:09,00:31:09,is possible.
00:31:09,00:31:11,Go back and look again.
00:31:11,00:31:13,And there was a thing then that women didn't really
00:31:13,00:31:14,look through telescopes.
00:31:14,00:31:16,Like men were around to operate telescopes.
00:31:16,00:31:18,Women could do the calculation stuff.
00:31:18,00:31:20,"So he went back, because she said, I really think it's there."
00:31:20,00:31:23,And then he found the two Martian moons.
00:31:23,00:31:25,So she used to do his calculations.
00:31:25,00:31:28,So she calculated the orbits of the moons around Mars
00:31:28,00:31:29,and did lots of stuff for him.
00:31:29,00:31:33,"And then eventually said to him, do you mind?"
00:31:33,00:31:34,Because I'm doing a lot of this work.
00:31:34,00:31:37,If you pay me the salary that I might get if I work for you.
00:31:37,00:31:38,"And he said, no."
00:31:38,00:31:40,And so she stopped doing it for him.
00:31:40,00:31:40,Wow.
00:31:40,00:31:43,"Amazing person, fair enough."
00:31:43,00:31:46,"And even before that, a Kepler said"
00:31:46,00:31:48,that there were two moons of Mars.
00:31:48,00:31:50,"He said, Earth had got one moon."
00:31:50,00:31:51,And Jupiter had four moons.
00:31:51,00:31:53,And so it just makes logical sense
00:31:53,00:31:57,that the planet in between must have two.
00:31:57,00:31:57,He was right.
00:31:57,00:31:59,"Well, he was right."
00:31:59,00:32:02,"Apart from the fact that Jupiter has a lot more than that,"
00:32:02,00:32:06,and the logic is completely spurious.
00:32:06,00:32:08,"Mind you, people were predicting it left right and center."
00:32:08,00:32:12,"So Jonathan Swift, in Gulliver's Travels in 1726--"
00:32:12,00:32:14,so 150 years before they were discovered--
00:32:14,00:32:16,"said, like-- so in Gulliver's Travels,"
00:32:16,00:32:18,"if you've read it, the La Pusions--"
00:32:18,00:32:20,not to be confused with the La Pusions--
00:32:20,00:32:21,the La Pusions said they discovered
00:32:21,00:32:23,that Mars has two satellites.
00:32:23,00:32:24,And then he described them.
00:32:24,00:32:27,"And he said, the inner one orbits within 10 hours."
00:32:27,00:32:28,So it's orbit last 10 hours.
00:32:28,00:32:30,The outer one's orbit is 21 hours.
00:32:30,00:32:32,"And actually, it's eight hours and 30."
00:32:32,00:32:34,So pretty damn close.
00:32:34,00:32:36,This is 150 years before they were discovered.
00:32:36,00:32:38,"He said, I reckon it's got two moons."
00:32:38,00:32:38,That's pretty good.
00:32:38,00:32:39,Yeah.
00:32:39,00:32:41,So we're talking about Mars.
00:32:41,00:32:45,"And there's a prospect of going to Mars, possibly."
00:32:45,00:32:46,So a bit.
00:32:46,00:32:48,So I was looking at some of the problems of it.
00:32:48,00:32:50,And the really interesting thing is that it
00:32:50,00:32:52,would be a much longer mission than anyone
00:32:52,00:32:53,has done in space before.
00:32:53,00:32:56,You need to do about three years in space to get to Mars.
00:32:56,00:33:00,So already being in space causes problems.
00:33:00,00:33:04,So your skeleton is constantly adapted to gravity.
00:33:04,00:33:07,"And so without it, calcium gets into the bloodstream,"
00:33:07,00:33:08,which gives you kidney stones.
00:33:08,00:33:12,And it also causes constipation and psychotic depression.
00:33:12,00:33:14,So this medical students remember this
00:33:14,00:33:20,"as bones, stones, abdominal groans, and psychic moans."
00:33:20,00:33:23,"But there's another problem, which is being a microgravity."
00:33:23,00:33:26,It moves where your brain is in your head.
00:33:26,00:33:28,So microgravity makes astronauts brain squish
00:33:28,00:33:32,upwards and squash at the top of their skulls.
00:33:32,00:33:33,And what that does is that puts pressure
00:33:33,00:33:36,"on two particular lobes, the frontal and parietal lobes,"
00:33:36,00:33:39,"which control movement and higher executive function,"
00:33:39,00:33:41,which is essential for planning things
00:33:41,00:33:42,and remembering details.
00:33:42,00:33:45,"So you would end up not being able to do anything,"
00:33:45,00:33:46,or plan anything.
00:33:46,00:33:48,And also those regions of the brain
00:33:48,00:33:51,are associated with pro-social behavior.
00:33:51,00:33:53,So they think that you'd end up making a lot of hurtful
00:33:53,00:33:57,and inappropriate comments to other astronauts.
00:33:57,00:33:58,But they all would be.
00:33:58,00:33:59,Yeah.
00:33:59,00:34:00,Here's a weird thing.
00:34:00,00:34:02,I don't have the science behind this.
00:34:02,00:34:04,They've worked out recently through tests
00:34:04,00:34:05,that they've done with astronauts
00:34:05,00:34:07,who've been up at the ISS recently.
00:34:07,00:34:09,"When you go up, let's say the three of you"
00:34:09,00:34:12,"who don't wear glasses will Andy, you do."
00:34:12,00:34:13,But you two don't.
00:34:13,00:34:15,"Your eyes, something happens to it"
00:34:15,00:34:17,where it means you might suddenly need glasses
00:34:17,00:34:18,for close reading.
00:34:18,00:34:21,"Whereas my eyes, and Andy's eyes, he's wearing contacts,"
00:34:21,00:34:23,we suddenly will have better vision.
00:34:23,00:34:25,And I'll be able to take my glasses off.
00:34:25,00:34:25,Yeah.
00:34:25,00:34:26,Wow.
00:34:26,00:34:27,Very weird.
00:34:27,00:34:28,It's a thing that happens with the eyeball
00:34:28,00:34:31,and the way something at the back to store it.
00:34:31,00:34:32,So that would be another problem.
00:34:32,00:34:34,Space truly is the home of real nerds.
00:34:34,00:34:36,[LAUGHTER]
00:34:36,00:34:38,"OK, that is it."
00:34:38,00:34:39,That is all of our facts.
