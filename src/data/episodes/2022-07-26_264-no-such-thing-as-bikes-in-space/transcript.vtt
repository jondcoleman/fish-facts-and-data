00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.420
 The song is called "Horoi Wa Wa Ka Sibe"

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.440
 The song is called "Horoi Wa Ka Sibe"

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.520
 The song is called "Horoi Wa Wa Wa Ka Sibe"

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:16.080
 Hello and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish"

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.920
 A weekly podcast, this week coming to you live, from Bustapal!

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:29.020
 My name is Dan Schreiber and I am sitting here with Anna Chazinski

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.600
 Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.420
 and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.140
 from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go!

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.100
 Starting with fact number one and that's my fact this week

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:49.020
 My fact is the 95-year-old billionaire who controls Viacom and CBS

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.080
 now communicates via an iPad preloaded with audio clips

00:00:54.080 --> 00:01:02.460
 His choices include "Yes, No" and "Buck You"

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.880
 So how does this work? You're having a conversation with him

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.700
 and rather than respond with his mouth then he responds by clicking a button

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.260
 He's a very old man now, he's 95 years old

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.740
 and his speaking has gone quite bad so his communication is very bad

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.400
 so what they've done is they've helped him swear at people

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.400
 with as much force via a button

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.400
 because he can't swallow, he has a problem with this throat

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.640
 He is fed through a tube and he really, really likes steak and he wants to eat steak

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.000
 but they will never let him because he has this tube

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.040
 and they say the only way he can get rid of his tube is if he conserves his energy

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.240
 by reducing his sexual activity to once a week

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.360
 And he refuses!

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.360
 Is he called Redstone? He is, he's called "Sumner Redstone"

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.840
 He's a very big media mogul, he has a lot of CBS and so on

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.040
 and things that are underneath that are like paramount pictures and so on

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.920
 His family have a company which is the National Museum's Theodor Chain

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.560
 and that's what that all sits underneath

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.840
 He has a majority vote so he's the big dog really

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.640
 so he's a very important guy

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.000
 and he kind of like, he's done a few things that have gone into pop culture

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.520
 Content is king is a thing he coined

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.320
 That's what I mean that we're all supposed to know about

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.760
 I think he would be very hurt by that comment

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.760
 I don't know what he'd say

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.400
 What is that?

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.920
 What is what? Content is king, you know, it's a saying

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.520
 It's been said, it's not a very old saying

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.920
 Sorry, you're saying he invented the non-existent catchphrase "Content is king"

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.640
 Is this kind of shit he's been turning out? He's a billionaire

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.000
 Yeah, that's all you need to do apparently

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 Just one catchphrase and you become a billionaire

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.600
 No, he's got a giant empire behind a real catchphrase

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.600
 It's not like, nice to see you to see you, nice, is it?

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.800
 Bringsie came out and shouted "Content is king"

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.400
 He's not on TV yelling it

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:10.680
 Where is he behind the scenes? When is he saying "Content is king" and where it has become so famous?

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.000
 He's saying it meetings when Bruce Forsythe's going, "What do you think of?"

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.840
 "We've got this great catchphrase, but I've got no show."

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.440
 That's shit, content is king, that's when he's saying it

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.920
 But the thing is, it's hard to know whether the fuck you, that he says, or the FU,

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.160
 Let's stop swearing, the FU, is said as a mean thing or a nice thing

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.480
 There was an interview with one of his advisors, a wealth advisor called Rebecca Rothstein

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:37.640
 She said, "I've only been the recipient of an FU once. I think he meant it in an endearing way."

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:44.120
 It's all to do with how he presses the bus on, I suppose, to take your cue from things like that

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:50.520
 Was he known for being a particularly bad boss? Is this something he uses a lot this button?

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:55.800
 He's a big character, there's a lot of controversy in his personal life and his business life

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.520
 It's hard to say, don't know the guy, but yeah

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.360
 We're talking about a billionaire, I don't want to say anything livalous, right?

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.760
 Hey, it's an asshole, what are you going to do?

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.840
 I don't know what to do

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.800
 But all my researchers on asshole billionaires, so we're in trouble

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.760
 One guy who admits that he used to be a bad boss is Bill Gates

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.880
 I think he's got a much more cuddly image now, but when he was first working at Microsoft,

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.200
 when he was first in charge of Microsoft, Bill Gates knew everyone's car license plates

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:31.240
 so he could look out into the car park and see when people were arriving and leaving from their work

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.400
 and he only stopped doing that when the company got so big that he could not physically remember

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.920
 everyone's license plates again

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.600
 If only you could come up with a system of putting letters and numbers in a big file

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:52.920
 I was actually reading a thing in the Guardian

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.480
 where they ask people to write in and say examples of bad bosses and what they've made them do

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.320
 and one of them may have been a Bill Gates employee because one of these people wrote in and said

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:06.920
 "My boss made us all park our cars facing the same direction for neatness in the car park."

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:12.120
 That same boss said that all of your buttons have to be made of pearls because plastic buttons

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.840
 are ugly and then some other ... I don't think this is Bill Gates

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.800
 No, I don't think that is Bill Gates, that would be like this

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.360
 they do call him "perly Gates" so maybe that's why

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.360
 There you go, yeah that's why

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:30.040
 There was just in this list of things to the Guardian

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:33.320
 these are some other things people have had to deal with with bad bosses

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.600
 Someone wrote in and said that they got a round ribbon email from their boss saying

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.280
 "Please can everyone do their number two's before they come into the office

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.680
 because I don't like going into the bathrooms and having them smell bad"

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.640
 So that's some advice from a boss

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:51.160
 Another boss banned all paper clips because once he'd accidentally clip some sensitive material

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.040
 to the back of someone's appraisal which they'd read

00:05:54.040 --> 00:06:01.320
 And another boss said that all equipment in the entire office needs to be clearly labeled by Friday

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.800
 otherwise disciplinary action will be taken

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.760
 and that included things like every single thing by Friday

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:10.840
 things like chair, light switch, door, floor and ceiling

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.200
 Someone had to get a step done around

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:20.920
 I found a thing about how to be successful at work in relation to your boss

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:24.920
 Okay, so if you keep a religious symbol at your desk

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:27.960
 your boss is less likely to ask you to act unethically

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.400
 and it can be a symbol from any religion

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.560
 so there was a study of this in India

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.760
 and if they found that their bosses put less pressure on them

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:38.280
 to bend the rules or to be rude to other people

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:42.600
 and it also works if you put a virtuous quotation at the end of your email

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.960
 like better to fail with honor than succeed with fraud

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:52.120
 But when you say it's getting them you ask them to do less fraudulent things

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:52.840
 that what you said

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.080
 is it not that you just spend less time talking to them

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:56.120
 because you don't want to talk to them

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:57.640
 so you ask them to do less things in-

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:58.600
 Do you have maybe-

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.720
 what because they've got an enormous crucifix

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:03.320
 a six-foot tall crucifix about this

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:05.480
 Larry's a bit full on, isn't he?

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.560
 I would give that person a wide berth, definitely

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.960
 How's this for a bad boss?

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:12.200
 I'm not sure if we mentioned before George Pullman

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:13.400
 have we mentioned him?

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:13.880
 He made-

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:15.240
 Yeah, Ben Willey-Bot.

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:15.880
 Ben Willey-Bot made train cars.

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:17.320
 I know he just made train cars, didn't he?

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:19.960
 Yeah, he made train cars but he was a really, he was a terrible boss

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:24.440
 he ran basically he built a town for all of his employees to live in

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:27.880
 so he had schools and churches, he changed the money

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.920
 from American dollars to paying them in Pullman money

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:34.040
 so it was just his own currency like he was the monopoly man

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:37.080
 and yeah so he just took over their whole life.

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:37.560
 Whoa.

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:38.200
 Yeah, yeah.

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:40.920
 And then the thing about him is he was hated so much

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:43.640
 that his family buried him under like three feet of concrete

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:45.800
 because they thought someone would go after his cops.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.080
 Oh, dear.

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:49.480
 This is a, I've got some advice if you can.

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:52.440
 Oh, but just be offering some times fun,

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:53.960
 how many comments I'm receiving?

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:55.800
 Oh, I'm not sure about that.

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:58.520
 Oh dreadful.

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.920
 It's alright, it was dead.

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:02.040
 I wouldn't have cared.

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:03.720
 But there is...

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:07.480
 There are some tips if you haven't really heard about...

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:09.320
 I'll do you to do the hoology at my funeral, Anna.

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.280
 Do we like to this guy now?

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:13.160
 He doesn't give a shit.

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:16.120
 Do you know one thing that does work

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:19.880
 is sticking a pin into a doll of your boss?

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:20.680
 Oh.

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:21.880
 So there's genuinely reduces...

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:22.600
 What do you mean work?

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:26.440
 I think they don't feel the injury wherever you put that down.

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:27.480
 Sorry.

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.480
 That would be a hell of a fact, a pair of you wouldn't.

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:30.200
 Who do works?

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:36.440
 If so, sorry, it works to reduce your anger at your boss.

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:37.080
 Oh, coming.

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:39.560
 Participants in this experiment, they were asked to remember

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:42.600
 very specifically and clearly, a time that their boss had humiliated

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:44.840
 or blamed them when it wasn't their fault.

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:48.040
 And then they were asked to name a voodoo doll on the screen,

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:50.120
 on the computer in front of them.

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:52.200
 And some had to name it nobody,

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.360
 and others people could name it after their boss.

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:59.560
 And if you got the chance to do the damage to a doll named after your boss,

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:03.000
 you felt a much lower sense of injustice after it was all over.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000
 There's alternatives, because people do, I think, regrettably do stuff where they...

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.240
 If they don't like their boss, they sense stuff.

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:11.960
 I was reading in America, there's a human resources director

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:16.680
 who's taking legal action to find out who wants her to eat a bag of dicks.

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:23.400
 Now, this is a company in America that sent, on request,

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:26.520
 gummy-shaped little penis-ish-ish-ish-ish-ish-ish.

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:36.280
 Sorry, not gummy-shaped penises. You need to see a doctor about that.

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:38.520
 What a frightening company that would be.

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:42.920
 But yeah, they're called dicks by mail.

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:46.600
 And what they do is you ask them to send a package to a boss or someone

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:48.040
 relative that you don't like.

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:48.840
 Right.

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:53.000
 And she's trying to sue that company now to find out who had sent that to her.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.240
 Yeah, because she was very upset.

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:58.520
 The company's website, if you go to it, it's so dicks by mail.

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:02.280
 And it markets itself as great way to tell your friends, family, loved ones,

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:04.280
 or enemies to eat a bag of dicks.

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:09.160
 I actually have a related fact.

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:10.840
 It's about eccentric millionaires.

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:14.440
 Do you know what John Wayne bobbits is up to these days?

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:17.000
 Oh, so you remember him.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.200
 He was the one whose wife...

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.560
 Yeah, chopped off his stuff.

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:20.920
 Chopped off his gummy.

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:21.720
 Yeah.

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:25.080
 I'm thrown out of the car.

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:27.640
 Well, he is now a treasure hunter.

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:30.120
 He's not still looking for it.

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:37.880
 He is looking for a chest of treasure.

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:42.760
 And this is a chest of treasure that an eccentric art dealer has hidden

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:44.520
 in the Rocky Mountains somewhere.

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:46.360
 He's called Forrest Fenn.

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:49.640
 350,000 people have tried and failed to find this treasure.

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:51.000
 Wow, is it worth...

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.520
 Did you say it was worth a great deal?

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:53.720
 I didn't, but it is.

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:54.920
 Okay.

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:56.280
 It's probably...

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:58.360
 It's worth about two million dollars.

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:00.680
 And it's like jewels and stuff like that.

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:02.040
 And he's hidden it somewhere.

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:03.960
 And four people have died looking for it.

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:05.160
 Ooh, yeah.

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:06.120
 It's very dangerous.

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:10.360
 One bad boss was the guy who ran Mars, Forrest Mars Senior.

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:12.280
 He invented the Milky Way and Eminem.

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:13.960
 So he's quite a big deal.

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:18.440
 But when new managers came, he would make them sign a resignation letter

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:19.400
 on their first day.

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:20.600
 What?

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:21.800
 Oh, and then just in case.

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:23.560
 And just in case so, he had it.

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:25.720
 In case they didn't reach their targets, he'd be able to say,

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:28.360
 "Well, now you're going to give me your resignation."

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:29.480
 That's pretty bad, isn't it?

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:30.280
 So it is bad.

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:32.200
 In a meeting once, he made his youngest son

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:34.200
 pray for the firm on his knees for an hour.

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:39.800
 When you said he ran Mars, I thought you meant he ran...

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:41.800
 I didn't think anyone ran Mars, but no.

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:44.040
 You mean the planet?

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:45.240
 Yeah, exactly.

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:46.840
 But you mean the chocolate firm.

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:48.840
 He says chocolate is king.

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:49.640
 It's a catchphrase.

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:51.400
 LAUGHTER

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:53.960
 OK, it is time for fact number two.

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:55.960
 And that is Chazinski.

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:59.400
 My fact this week is that before scarecrow's were straw dummies,

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:00.600
 they were living children.

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:02.760
 Wow.

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:05.800
 So you're not saying every single scarecrow that you see

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:07.400
 used to be a living child, eh?

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:10.280
 And then a powerful witch came across that.

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:11.560
 LAUGHTER

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:12.440
 I'm not saying that.

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:13.800
 That's how stuck in the mud came about.

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:15.480
 If you actually run under a scarecrow's legs,

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:16.840
 it turns back into a child.

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:17.960
 That's true.

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:20.360
 But don't do it, because that child is angry by this point.

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:21.400
 LAUGHTER

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:22.600
 No, that's not the fact.

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:23.960
 That would be amazing.

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:27.000
 This is the fact that the way that people scared birds away

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.760
 from their farms in year-olden days

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:30.520
 were just by employing kids to do it.

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:33.000
 And the first use of the word scarecrow

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.520
 to refer to someone that scares a bird was in 1553.

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:39.400
 And that referred to children who had the job of doing it.

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:42.840
 And then in 1592 came the idea of the stuffed dummy.

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:44.600
 But until the late 19th century,

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:46.200
 and I think into the early 20th century,

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:47.960
 then kids were just employed to do this.

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:49.080
 And it was quite a common job.

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:52.200
 You know how you got a job doing a milk ground or something,

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:53.720
 or working in a cafe as a kid.

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:55.560
 The equivalent of that in the Victorian era

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:58.520
 was standing in a field and scaring away birds.

00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:01.400
 And the reason that they stopped having children there

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:03.240
 is because the factories started opening

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:04.600
 and they could pay the children more.

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:06.600
 Mmm, yeah.

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:07.960
 And the factories could pay the children more?

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:08.840
 Yeah.

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:11.000
 So the children decided to work in the factories instead.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.440
 Well, I'm not sure they had much say in the matter.

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:13.640
 I'm not saying.

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:15.080
 But they worked in the factories instead.

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:18.200
 And also the reason that the scarecrow's came in

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:19.640
 is because of the plague.

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:21.240
 The plague killed so many people

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:23.000
 that there weren't enough children to go round

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.080
 and so they had to make the scarecrow's instead.

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:26.040
 Oh, really?

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:26.680
 Yeah.

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:27.960
 It wasn't a terrible gig.

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:30.200
 I read that in the 1800s.

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:33.400
 If you were, for instance, a child scarecrow in Winchkem,

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:36.840
 you would be paid a penny per day plus a suite.

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:40.280
 By which you mean the vegetable?

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:41.480
 No, a Swedish person.

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:42.600
 We had a surplus there.

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:44.760
 [LAUGHTER]

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:46.520
 There's only one celebrity scarecrow

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:49.800
 that I've found in history, who is, you know,

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:51.640
 the Thomas Hardy book, Jude the Obscure.

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:52.200
 Yeah.

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:54.640
 Jude the Obscure used to be a scarecrow as a child.

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:56.800
 Oh my god, I totally forgot that, really.

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:57.960
 I'd forgotten it, too.

00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:58.760
 Wow.

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:00.440
 It's not a real celebrity.

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:01.960
 It's not-- it's not going to trouble heat magazine

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:03.280
 any time soon.

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:05.480
 I mean, I would say a bigger celebrity scarecrow

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:07.880
 is the scarecrow from the Wizard of Oz.

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:09.160
 Yes.

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:09.840
 Yes.

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:10.840
 That's true.

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:11.800
 So there are two.

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:13.840
 Well, actually, just quickly on the scarecrow

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:16.880
 from the Wizard of Oz, I was reading about him today.

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:19.480
 And it turns out that in the original books,

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:21.560
 he doesn't actually lack a brain.

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:24.560
 In reality, when she meets him, he's only two days old

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:26.440
 and just really ignorant.

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:26.960
 Oh, yeah.

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:28.120
 So he actually has a brain.

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:31.320
 And then in the movie itself, if you all remember

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:33.880
 that great moment where the wizard does give him a brain,

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:36.280
 he suddenly recites Pythagorean Theorem.

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:40.640
 And he states that it applies to an isosceles triangle.

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:41.480
 That's not correct.

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:42.880
 No, obviously, it's a right-angle triangle.

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:45.720
 What the fuck is he talking about?

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:49.000
 I mean, he's only had a brain for like 10 seconds.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.600
 I would have loved to have been in the cinema

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:54.040
 with you as a kid watching that.

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:55.440
 That's actually the character of the scarecrow.

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:57.720
 So it was played by Guy called Ray Bulger

00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:59.680
 in the original Wizard of Oz.

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:02.200
 But it was supposed to be played by a guy called Body Epson.

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:04.360
 And if you look this man up, Body Epson

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:05.760
 was-- he was six with three.

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:06.920
 He was incredibly skinny.

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:08.880
 And he looks exactly like a scarecrow.

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:10.680
 His whole face is scarecrow-like.

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:13.160
 And so the people making the film thought, this is our guy.

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:15.320
 He's an actor, looks like a scarecrow.

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:17.520
 And then they decided to cast this guy called Ray Bulger

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:18.720
 as the Tin Man.

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:20.280
 Little did they know that Ray Bulger

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:21.840
 had been inspired to act when he'd

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:23.920
 seen a production of the Wizard of Oz.

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:27.560
 And he'd seen the scarecrow leap up through a haystack

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:28.760
 off a trampoline.

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:30.800
 And seeing that scarecrow made him think,

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:34.280
 one day, I must play the scarecrow in the Wizard of Oz.

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:37.400
 And so he was cast as the Tin Man, and he was pissed off.

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:38.400
 He loves to be.

00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:39.480
 He insisted.

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:41.280
 And they said, no, no, we're not going to let you.

00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:43.200
 We've got this guy who looks like a scarecrow.

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:45.640
 And the guy who looked like the scarecrow was practicing

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:47.560
 the lines and was being taught the dances.

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:49.960
 And eventually Bulger just wore them down

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:51.720
 and said, I will be the scarecrow.

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:53.200
 It's my life's mission.

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:54.320
 And he was a scarecrow.

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:57.160
 So that's-- if you could see inside the Tin Man,

00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:58.520
 he looks like a scarecrow.

00:15:58.520 --> 00:15:59.920
 But do you know the Tin Man swaps?

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:00.560
 Yeah, the Tin Man swaps.

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:01.240
 There's one.

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:03.640
 No, no, no, no, no, this is what I'm saying.

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:05.480
 No, no, no, what happened was they swapped.

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:07.000
 So they were like, OK, we're still in the movie.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:07.800
 This is fine.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.640
 And the guy who was the original scarecrow

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:10.840
 was now the Tin Man.

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:13.400
 But he got allergic to all of the paint that was put on him.

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:14.200
 Couldn't do the job.

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:15.200
 So he got fired.

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:16.640
 He's not in the Wizard of Oz.

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:17.720
 He's not there.

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:18.480
 He lost his job.

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:20.560
 They should have given him lion.

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:21.880
 I don't think that's how it worked.

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:23.160
 I don't think there was just a--

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:24.480
 He was also allergic to cats.

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:27.240
 [LAUGHTER]

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:31.600
 There are cool old words for scarecrowes, which I never knew.

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:34.120
 In Old English, they were called a free bogard.

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:34.840
 Nice.

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:35.600
 Which is a good--

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:36.560
 Oh, yeah.

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:37.060
 Really?

00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:38.320
 We still call it that round here.

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:39.320
 Yeah.

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:40.560
 [LAUGHTER]

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:41.080
 Polyviz.

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:43.440
 I don't know how we're talking about it.

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:44.600
 What the hell is this scarecrow?

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:47.200
 Well, let's try a couple of others, then.

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:49.720
 Potato Bogal?

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:51.520
 Ah, got you there.

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:52.600
 Potato Bogal, which was--

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:55.640
 That hasn't got here yet, that one.

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:56.600
 Or a Tati Bogal.

00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:57.920
 I think Tati Bogal has got it.

00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:58.720
 Potato Bogal, sorry.

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:00.800
 Potato Bogal, if you're from Oxbridge, obviously.

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:03.480
 But Tati Bogal, for the rest of us.

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:06.040
 I was reading that, though, in 1989,

00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:08.080
 they were testing new scarecrow ideas.

00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:09.840
 And there was one exciting one, which

00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:12.920
 was a scarecrow that I think must have been laying back

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:16.800
 because every now and then, a propane cannon would lob it up.

00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:17.320
 Oh, yeah.

00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:19.080
 No, these are still sold.

00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:19.800
 And it really works.

00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:21.520
 It really scares away the birds, because suddenly--

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:22.320
 Boo!

00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:23.080
 [LAUGHTER]

00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:24.840
 Yeah, Tati goes.

00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:27.720
 I read one more bit of scarecrow technology.

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:30.680
 In Australia, they have AI scarecrowes.

00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:32.680
 Although we've been in the West country for two days now,

00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:38.000
 and I've realized around here, AI stands for artificial insemination.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.040
 We learned that last night.

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:40.240
 We didn't learn that last night.

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:41.560
 We learned that last night.

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:44.880
 [LAUGHTER]

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:46.320
 And we mean the hard way.

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:50.720
 [LAUGHTER]

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:53.760
 Yeah, they have this-- it's kind of like a box.

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:56.080
 But what the box can do is it can recognize

00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:57.840
 what animals can come towards it.

00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:00.680
 And it can make species-dependent noises.

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:01.320
 That's cool.

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:03.240
 Yeah, so they know what crows don't like,

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:04.640
 and they know what geese don't like.

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:05.440
 And all these different things, they

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:06.800
 can make different sounds.

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:08.600
 And the main problem with scarecrowes

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:10.720
 is they get used to whatever's trying to scare them.

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:12.240
 The crows get used to it.

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:14.480
 And so this is-- they can change it all the time.

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:17.360
 We're going to have to move on to our next facts.

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:18.000
 Should we move on?

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.800
 Well, I found one article in the Metro.

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:24.480
 It was entitled, "Is this the world's most useless scarecrow?"

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:26.840
 And it was a picture of a scarecrow that was completely

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:29.120
 covered in bird poo.

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:31.920
 And it had a nest of five chicks tuts on his jacket.

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:35.920
 [LAUGHTER]

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:38.960
 OK, it is time for fact number three.

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:40.920
 And that is Andy.

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:44.080
 My fact is that the first ever leisure caravan

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:46.520
 had a man on a tricycle going ahead of it

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:49.480
 to check that the roads were good enough.

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:53.760
 So caravans were traditional mode of transport

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:55.920
 for a long time before they were used for leisure.

00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:58.200
 And then I found this on a blog by a guy

00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:00.240
 called Eugene Bern, which is a great blog.

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:01.320
 I do recommend it.

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:03.600
 And it was all about the guy who invented

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:05.440
 recreational caravanning.

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:08.080
 He was a guy called William Gordon Stables.

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:10.920
 And he was alive in the second half of the 19th century

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:13.280
 until 1910.

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:15.240
 And he was a crazy guy.

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:19.200
 He wrote for the boy's own paper to advise to boys.

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:20.520
 And most of the things he recommended

00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:22.520
 were cold baths and hot porridge and long walks.

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:23.960
 And he said that kind of sorts you out.

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:27.120
 And so he wanted to have an adventure.

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:30.400
 So he commissioned a wagon company in Bristol

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:34.560
 to build this beautiful thing that he called the wanderer.

00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:36.720
 And it's really ornate.

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:38.440
 It's made of mahogany.

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:40.360
 It had a paraffin oven, it had a bookcase,

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:43.600
 velvet lined furniture, lots of musical instruments.

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:45.120
 He kept a pistol in it as well.

00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:46.160
 I do not know why.

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:48.840
 And he went on adventures, but--

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:52.600
 But yeah, I think he called it a land yacht.

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:54.800
 And it was the land yacht wanderer.

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:56.560
 And he was an interesting guy.

00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:58.400
 The other thing, he did, he had a real passion

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:01.600
 for dogs and cats, this guy, William Gordon Stables.

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:03.480
 And he wrote a load of books in his life.

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:07.200
 And he either wrote books about how boys could survive

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:09.400
 in the wild, you know, like cat camping,

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:10.640
 like boys, out of style books.

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:12.640
 All he wrote books about how to keep dogs and cats.

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:15.320
 He wrote a book called The Domestic Cat and The Dog

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:17.120
 from Puppey Hood to Age.

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:17.600
 Yeah.

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:20.520
 And then on top of that, he wrote medical life in the Navy.

00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:22.840
 Wild adventures in wild places.

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:26.080
 And his last book was called The Sauciest Boy in the Service.

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:27.920
 Oh, wow.

00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:29.160
 And I looked into that.

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:31.000
 It's not what you think.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.480
 The word sassy just used to mean cheeky, didn't it?

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:34.160
 Oh, OK.

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:38.520
 I think he was Scottish as well, because he loved dogs and cats,

00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:39.600
 and he wrote a load about them.

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:42.760
 And he would frequently turn up at dog cat and agricultural shows

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:44.880
 usually in full-highland dress.

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:45.680
 Yeah.

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:47.160
 So he's quite a character.

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:50.520
 And his thing with the whole tricycle was that he--

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:53.320
 so the caravan was horse-drawn.

00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:56.920
 He had two horses that were taking them forward.

00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:00.480
 They were called Captain Cornflower and Polly P. Blossom.

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:03.360
 And they would both be going down.

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:06.320
 But the man servant that he had on the tricycle

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:08.600
 who was called Foley, he was both checking

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:11.280
 that the road surfaces were OK for him to go on.

00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:13.920
 But also in case anything was in the way, he would say,

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:15.080
 get off the road.

00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:16.520
 There's a caravan coming.

00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:17.680
 And I never went--

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:19.920
 What's a caravan?

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:21.160
 Yeah, it's true, yeah.

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:22.560
 I guess it was a new thing.

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:24.360
 Well, we should say it wasn't a new thing.

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:28.840
 So the caravan had existed as a way to travel and for circuses

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:32.480
 and travelers for a long time, thousands of years, really.

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:36.080
 But the idea of using caravans for leisure, which some people

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:37.720
 would say is an idea that should have

00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:42.080
 been nixed at the first, second, but he was the first person

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:42.760
 to do that.

00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:44.360
 And the early ones were really luxurious.

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:46.040
 It was a thing that the upper classes did.

00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:48.000
 And they would be one of the few holidays

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.400
 that you could take where you'd have running water.

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:52.640
 They had running water in the turn of the 20th century.

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:55.000
 They would have libraries, full libraries.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000
 Some of them had pianos in them.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.280
 And the pioneers of caravan in called themselves

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:01.040
 gentlemen gypsies.

00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:04.920
 And they were always horse-drawn, except just coming up

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:07.400
 to World War I. Then the motor car

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:08.960
 had been invented by this point.

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:11.480
 But it wasn't quite strong enough to pull most caravans.

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:15.480
 But a few people experimented with motor cars pulling caravans.

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:18.680
 And they were very much frowned upon as like too fast-paced.

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:20.760
 This isn't what caravan is about.

00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:23.040
 You can still get some really posh caravans,

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:25.200
 really expensive ones with lots of great stuff in.

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:28.520
 The element palazzo is the world's most expensive caravan.

00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:29.880
 It costs about 2 million pounds.

00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:31.200
 2 million pounds.

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:31.720
 Yep.

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:33.720
 Go on.

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:36.800
 It has a rooftop terrace, underfloor heating,

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:38.400
 and a pop-up cocktail bar.

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:40.880
 Pop-up cocktail, pop-up bar.

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:44.520
 But really, very pleasantly, it's known as the land yacht.

00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:45.360
 Really?

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:47.160
 He saved us the first ever one.

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:48.960
 It's interesting, isn't it, marketing's very clever?

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:50.480
 Because if you analyse those three things,

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:52.240
 a rooftop terrace is just a route.

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:54.480
 It doesn't mean you can get onto the roof.

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:57.560
 Underfloor heating, not super impressive, right?

00:22:57.560 --> 00:22:59.120
 You put a radiator on the floor.

00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:00.920
 And a pop-up cocktail bar.

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:02.560
 That's just a table.

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:05.280
 That's just a foldable table.

00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:09.040
 I just need to go and get my 2 million pounds back.

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:12.760
 There was a panic in 2014 about caravan holidays

00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:15.280
 and people thought that there were sleeping gas gangs

00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:17.960
 who would go around and they'd drop a sleeping gas canister

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:19.880
 through the window of your caravan.

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:21.320
 So then you'd be unconscious.

00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:22.680
 They'd knock you out and then they'd come in

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:25.400
 and they'd rob your caravan of all its stuff.

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:27.400
 Well, they'd take the pop-up bar

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:31.600
 and they'd rip the radiator from under the floor.

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:36.240
 But it seems to have been a completely fabricated thing.

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:38.800
 So the Royal College of Anesthetists got involved.

00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:42.640
 And they said there were dozens of newspaper stories

00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:44.400
 about these sleeping gas gangs operating in France

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:47.320
 and Italy, I think, on, you know, innocent British tourists

00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:49.120
 who were taking the caravan around.

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:50.680
 And they said it is the view of the college

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:52.760
 that it would not be possible to render someone unconscious

00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:55.520
 by blowing ether chloroform or any of the others

00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:57.560
 through the window of a motorhome without their knowledge.

00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:00.560
 Ether is extremely pungent and it would cause coughing

00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:01.800
 and sometimes vomiting.

00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:03.800
 And it takes some time to reach unconsciousness,

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:05.440
 even if given by direct application

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:07.120
 to the face on a cloth.

00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:09.520
 So they said it just doesn't happen.

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:13.080
 If you were going to rob people and you would think

00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:16.880
 where do people store their most valuable possessions?

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:18.520
 Should we rob a mansion?

00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:19.960
 Should we rob a castle?

00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:24.720
 No, I think every pop over to one of those haven caravan sides.

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:26.720
 Try and render those guys unconscious

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:28.640
 or get a couple of bottles of cider.

00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:31.240
 I mean, it doesn't make any sense at all.

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:35.200
 I read just an article that was sent to the Royal Society

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:39.440
 in 1957 and it was about the history of the caravan

00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:43.240
 and it was done by the head of the caravan society.

00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:47.080
 And he was talking about the fact that they had their caravans,

00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:49.480
 but people were really against caravans for a little while.

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:52.440
 He said conservative elements that feel their own interest

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:56.280
 threatened and fear it have accused followers of caravans

00:24:56.280 --> 00:25:00.640
 of every sin from leaving litter and stealing chickens

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:04.360
 to sexual promiscuity and spying.

00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:06.560
 Spying?

00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:07.400
 All right, 007.

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:10.480
 This isn't going to be your most glamorous gig yet.

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:13.360
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show.

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:15.040
 And that is James.

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:18.760
 OK, my fact this week is that the gravity on Mars's smallest moon

00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:21.720
 is so weak that if you built a ramp on it,

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:24.320
 you could ride your bike into space.

00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:26.320
 So you escape the--

00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:28.640
 You escape, yeah, you're going to escape velocity

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:30.920
 and you can fly into space.

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:33.120
 You wouldn't really want to ride a bike there

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:35.120
 because you probably wouldn't be able to ride

00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:37.680
 because you need gravity to ride bikes.

00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:39.800
 So you can kind of-- they've done experiments

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:41.920
 where they have bikes which kind of--

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:44.160
 they're built to make it look like there's no gravity

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:45.840
 to make you feel like there's no gravity.

00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:47.480
 And they found that people can balance,

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:49.840
 but they can't turn and they can't use the brakes.

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:51.040
 On Mars.

00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:55.040
 That's in any kind of anti-gravity situation.

00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:56.880
 We haven't-- not on Mars.

00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:59.360
 We haven't got people to Mars just for the sake

00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:01.080
 of doing this bike experiment.

00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:03.280
 I'm going to cover up that with me.

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:04.480
 And also, this isn't Mars.

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:09.000
 This is the smallest moon, which is called Demos.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.480
 Demos, Demos.

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:14.720
 And it is one 50 million times as big as the moon.

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:16.760
 So really, really small.

00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:19.840
 It's radius is about four miles, so you could run a marathon

00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:21.640
 round its equator and have the finishing line

00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:24.400
 pretty much where the starting line was.

00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:27.120
 And because it's so small, the gravity is really weak.

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:31.520
 So I would weigh about the same as a teaspoon of salt.

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:33.960
 Just on bikes not going into space,

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:36.800
 actually, there was a plan that we were going to send bikes

00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:39.200
 with one of the Apollo missions, because yeah,

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:42.080
 the lunar buggy wasn't going to be ready in time.

00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:45.040
 Apollo 15 actually tested out bikes

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:46.960
 that they could take to the moon.

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:51.120
 This is electric bikes, as opposed to pedaling bikes,

00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:52.680
 although that was suggested as well.

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:54.520
 You couldn't pedal in a space suit, though, presumably.

00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:55.400
 Presumably, yes.

00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:58.160
 Although someone did do a tandem quadra bike

00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:00.120
 that they wanted to send up there as well.

00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:01.760
 And they actually got close to the testing.

00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:03.880
 They actually brought them up into a vomit rocket

00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:06.840
 so that they could experience what it was like to pedal a bike

00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:09.800
 while plummeting back to the Earth and experiencing one,

00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:13.320
 what is it, one 16th or one 6th of the Earth's gravity?

00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:13.840
 Yeah.

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:14.840
 Wait.

00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:16.840
 So I think they thought that maybe they

00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:18.240
 wouldn't have time to get the vehicles ready.

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:19.800
 And so they'd have to send bikes instead.

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:21.360
 Because if you were going into space and they said,

00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:23.240
 I'm sorry, we haven't had time to rig up the stuff we

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:25.320
 meant to, do you mind bringing your bicycle?

00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:27.240
 I would just say--

00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:29.760
 I don't think I'm going to do this mission down the out.

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:30.480
 That's true.

00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:33.640
 I don't think you guys have thought enough about this.

00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:36.360
 Well, so imagine if they got there with Neil Armstrong

00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:39.400
 and he just hits a rock and leaps off into it.

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:41.680
 We've lost Neil, he's--

00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:44.760
 You know, you could run off the surface of this moon as well,

00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:45.880
 if you wanted to.

00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:49.080
 So you just have to reach a speed of about 12.5 miles an hour.

00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:51.920
 So if we were all stuck there, that's kind of the maximum

00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:54.320
 that a kind of fit person could sprint.

00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:56.400
 So the fit ones could get off it.

00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:58.000
 And then the really unfit ones would

00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.720
 be stuck on the moon.

00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:00.800
 Yeah, but neither is ideal.

00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:03.600
 I mean, both of you are all going to die of solar radiation

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:04.920
 and exposure and--

00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:05.440
 Yeah.

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:07.840
 It's not a dream world for anyone, no?

00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:12.800
 Gravity is different places on Earth, which I didn't know.

00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:14.720
 So this is about gravity being different in different places.

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:18.800
 So there's a place which has got the lowest gravity

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:21.400
 is just south of Sri Lanka in the Indian Ocean.

00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:25.880
 But there is a fact that Peru's gravity is also extremely

00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:26.960
 low, there's an area of Peru.

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:30.520
 And the Arctic's gravity, I think, is quite high.

00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:34.960
 So if you fell from exactly 100 meters all over the Earth,

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:36.240
 they've done simulations on this.

00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:38.680
 They have not tested it for real.

00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:40.560
 If you would drop from 100 meters high all over the Earth,

00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:44.160
 you would hit the surface in Peru 16 milliseconds later

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:46.760
 than in the Arctic, because the gravity is different.

00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:49.160
 I mean, it's not much different, isn't it?

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:52.440
 A bit more of your life would flash before your eyes.

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:55.720
 Because there's a moon of Uranus called Miranda.

00:28:55.720 --> 00:29:00.640
 And it has an 11 mile high cliff on it called Verona Rupees.

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:03.400
 And the peak is so high, and the gravity is so low

00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:06.520
 that if you fell off it, you would fall for 12 minutes

00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:08.480
 before hitting the ground.

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:10.880
 That's a lot of life flashing before your eyes, isn't it?

00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:13.120
 There is an app you can get, which is called High Jump,

00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:15.680
 which can tell you how high you would be able to jump

00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:19.800
 on various different planets and moons of our solar system.

00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:20.840
 What a vital app.

00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:22.320
 Yeah.

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:25.160
 This is made by astronomers Stuart Lowe and Chris North.

00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:28.440
 And so they tell you, for example, if you jumped on the moon,

00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:30.720
 you could jump three meters, 10 feet off the ground.

00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:32.720
 You'd be in the air for about four seconds.

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:35.840
 On Mars, it would be three feet for two seconds.

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:39.240
 But the sixth largest moon of Saturn,

00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:41.440
 you could jump, if you did your average jump,

00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:44.320
 you would go up 42.6 meters.

00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:46.320
 And you would float back down and you would land

00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:48.920
 with the same force that you did if you did the jump on Earth.

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:50.600
 So it wouldn't crush you.

00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:53.360
 And it would take roughly a full minute to go up and down

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:54.520
 with that jump.

00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:59.080
 Well, I think, to be honest, I think this moon, Dimas,

00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:01.760
 is pretty much the exact perfect one

00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:03.640
 if you want to jump as high as you possibly can.

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:06.040
 Because if the gravity was any less there,

00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:07.680
 then you would just float away.

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:09.520
 But you can just about not.

00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:12.800
 But do you know the story of how Mars's moons were discovered?

00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:13.800
 No.

00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:16.960
 So they were discovered by a guy called Asaf Hall,

00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:18.200
 which is a very weird name.

00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:19.960
 But this was in 1876.

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:22.600
 And he really thought that Mars probably

00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:26.120
 had a couple of moons, which it does, or some moons.

00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:27.360
 And so he had this telescope.

00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:30.120
 And he wanted-- he was looking through this telescope,

00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:32.160
 looking closer and closer to Mars.

00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:34.160
 And so the thing about the Mars and moons

00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:36.880
 is they're very close to the planet itself.

00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:38.520
 And he got really close to this telescope.

00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:40.480
 And the glare from Mars was getting too much.

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:43.120
 And he was like, no, there clearly aren't any moons there.

00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:45.800
 And he went home away from his observatory.

00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:47.600
 And he went home to his wife, who was a woman

00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:49.760
 called Angeline Stickney.

00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:52.400
 And he said, no moon can possibly exist here.

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:54.120
 The thing about Angeline, his wife,

00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:57.400
 is that she had been his mass teacher at university.

00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:59.840
 And she was very good at calculations like this.

00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:01.520
 And while he'd been there looking for the moon,

00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:05.040
 she'd done the calculations of how close a moon could be

00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:07.640
 to Mars and said, no, I've worked it out.

00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:09.160
 It's going to be closer than anyone thinks

00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:09.760
 is possible.

00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:11.120
 Go back and look again.

00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:13.400
 And there was a thing then that women didn't really

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:14.480
 look through telescopes.

00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:16.240
 Like men were around to operate telescopes.

00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:18.080
 Women could do the calculation stuff.

00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:20.880
 So he went back, because she said, I really think it's there.

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:23.200
 And then he found the two Martian moons.

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:25.120
 So she used to do his calculations.

00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:28.000
 So she calculated the orbits of the moons around Mars

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.800
 and did lots of stuff for him.

00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:33.080
 And then eventually said to him, do you mind?

00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:34.720
 Because I'm doing a lot of this work.

00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:37.680
 If you pay me the salary that I might get if I work for you.

00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:38.520
 And he said, no.

00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:40.000
 And so she stopped doing it for him.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:40.840
 Wow.

00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:43.720
 Amazing person, fair enough.

00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:46.400
 And even before that, a Kepler said

00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:48.360
 that there were two moons of Mars.

00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:50.360
 He said, Earth had got one moon.

00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:51.840
 And Jupiter had four moons.

00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:53.480
 And so it just makes logical sense

00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:57.200
 that the planet in between must have two.

00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:57.880
 He was right.

00:31:57.880 --> 00:31:59.200
 Well, he was right.

00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:02.480
 Apart from the fact that Jupiter has a lot more than that,

00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:06.520
 and the logic is completely spurious.

00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:08.720
 Mind you, people were predicting it left right and center.

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:12.640
 So Jonathan Swift, in Gulliver's Travels in 1726--

00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:14.760
 so 150 years before they were discovered--

00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:16.400
 said, like-- so in Gulliver's Travels,

00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:18.240
 if you've read it, the La Pusions--

00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:20.000
 not to be confused with the La Pusions--

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.600
 the La Pusions said they discovered

00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:23.560
 that Mars has two satellites.

00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:24.720
 And then he described them.

00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:27.600
 And he said, the inner one orbits within 10 hours.

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:28.560
 So it's orbit last 10 hours.

00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:30.680
 The outer one's orbit is 21 hours.

00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:32.760
 And actually, it's eight hours and 30.

00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:34.520
 So pretty damn close.

00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:36.560
 This is 150 years before they were discovered.

00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:38.120
 He said, I reckon it's got two moons.

00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:38.720
 That's pretty good.

00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:39.880
 Yeah.

00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:41.320
 So we're talking about Mars.

00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:45.240
 And there's a prospect of going to Mars, possibly.

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:46.320
 So a bit.

00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:48.000
 So I was looking at some of the problems of it.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.960
 And the really interesting thing is that it

00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:52.800
 would be a much longer mission than anyone

00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:53.720
 has done in space before.

00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:56.760
 You need to do about three years in space to get to Mars.

00:32:56.760 --> 00:33:00.600
 So already being in space causes problems.

00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:04.480
 So your skeleton is constantly adapted to gravity.

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:07.160
 And so without it, calcium gets into the bloodstream,

00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:08.880
 which gives you kidney stones.

00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:12.120
 And it also causes constipation and psychotic depression.

00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:14.400
 So this medical students remember this

00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:20.120
 as bones, stones, abdominal groans, and psychic moans.

00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:23.720
 But there's another problem, which is being a microgravity.

00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:26.320
 It moves where your brain is in your head.

00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:28.760
 So microgravity makes astronauts brain squish

00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:32.040
 upwards and squash at the top of their skulls.

00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:33.520
 And what that does is that puts pressure

00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:36.360
 on two particular lobes, the frontal and parietal lobes,

00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:39.720
 which control movement and higher executive function,

00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:41.360
 which is essential for planning things

00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:42.720
 and remembering details.

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:45.880
 So you would end up not being able to do anything,

00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:46.680
 or plan anything.

00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:48.840
 And also those regions of the brain

00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:51.040
 are associated with pro-social behavior.

00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:53.040
 So they think that you'd end up making a lot of hurtful

00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:57.560
 and inappropriate comments to other astronauts.

00:33:57.560 --> 00:33:58.360
 But they all would be.

00:33:58.360 --> 00:33:59.200
 Yeah.

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:00.160
 Here's a weird thing.

00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:02.400
 I don't have the science behind this.

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:04.400
 They've worked out recently through tests

00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:05.600
 that they've done with astronauts

00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:07.400
 who've been up at the ISS recently.

00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:09.440
 When you go up, let's say the three of you

00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:12.040
 who don't wear glasses will Andy, you do.

00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:13.920
 But you two don't.

00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:15.520
 Your eyes, something happens to it

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:17.640
 where it means you might suddenly need glasses

00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:18.560
 for close reading.

00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:21.400
 Whereas my eyes, and Andy's eyes, he's wearing contacts,

00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:23.360
 we suddenly will have better vision.

00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:25.120
 And I'll be able to take my glasses off.

00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:25.960
 Yeah.

00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:26.480
 Wow.

00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:27.000
 Very weird.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:28.800
 It's a thing that happens with the eyeball

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:31.000
 and the way something at the back to store it.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.360
 So that would be another problem.

00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:34.360
 Space truly is the home of real nerds.

00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:36.480
 [LAUGHTER]

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:38.040
 OK, that is it.

00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:39.080
 That is all of our facts.

00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:40.560
 Thank you so much for listening.
