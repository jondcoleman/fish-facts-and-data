00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.220
 Howdy everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Thing as a Fish. I have a couple

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.420
 of very important announcements to say. In fact, we have them because Andy's here as

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.300
 well. Hello. Hello Andy. But yes, we have a couple of very important announcements to

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:21.140
 make. The first one is that today's episode has a very special guest and that guest is

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:27.460
 Ella Alshamahi. Now, regular listeners of No Such Thing as a Fish will know who Ella is.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:34.880
 She is an explorer, a paleoanthropologist, evolutionary biologist, general smart cookie

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.560
 and very good friend of ours. And we love having her on the show. It's always an absolute

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:44.000
 riot when she comes on. And the important thing to tell you about that is that she has

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.160
 a new series out. It is called Human and it is on the BBC iPlayer right now if you're

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.560
 in the UK. But if you're not in the UK, fear not. Because if you're in the USA, it will

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:03.420
 be on PBS from Wednesday the 17th of September, which is actually a couple of days ago. So

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.900
 if you go to the PBS app, you will be able to find that in the US. And believe it or

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:13.420
 not is also coming to Australia, India and Scandinavia soon. That show is called Human.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.860
 It's all about the history of Homo sapiens. It's absolutely fantastic just as Ella is

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:24.060
 herself. Yeah, it's great. We're lucky to have had her time, frankly. And our second

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:31.140
 exciting announcement is that we are doing a live show at Cheltenham, the Cheltenham

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.000
 Literary Festival. Oh, yeah, it's going to be posh. It's going to be wordy. We're going

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.040
 to be talking book book stuff with big word. No, it's going to be great. We're going to

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.080
 be doing the show at Cheltenham on the 16th of October. Our special guest is going to

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.280
 be Rachel Paris, who's absolutely terrific. It's an 8pm ticket to selling fast. So if

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.700
 you live within a 200 mile radius of Cheltenham, this is your chance to see us this year. We

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:00.580
 would love to see you. So just get your tickets and no such thing as a fish.com/live. If you

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.540
 live more than 200 miles away, there are such things as aeroplanes and Bristol Airport is

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.980
 just a short drive away. So take on some of this show. No, honestly, it's going to be

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:13.460
 a great show. We're really looking forward to it. And like Andy says, tickets are available

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:18.380
 at no such thing as a fish.com. Anyway, please sit back, relax and enjoy this week's episode

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.240
 of no such things as a fish with Ella Alshamahi. Okay, on with the podcast.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:43.960
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast coming

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:48.720
 to you from the QI offices in Hoburn. My name is Dan Treiber. I am sitting here with

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.020
 James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray, and Ella Alshamahi. And once again, we have gathered

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.900
 around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days. And in no

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:04.180
 particular order here we go. Starting with fact number one, and that is Ella. So my fact

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:09.940
 this week is that 50,000 years ago, humans the size of penguins hunted elephants the

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:15.920
 size of cows. Pretty cute. It's cute. The past is cuter than I was led to believe. How

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:22.760
 tall are you? You're quite he's two penguins. Yeah, you are about to hunt an elephant the

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:28.520
 size of a cow. No way. You couldn't hunt a cow the size of a cow. cows are big. I'm

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.400
 scary. That's scary. If I get to a field, we're off topic already. But if you get to

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.960
 a field with a cow in, you've got to take care. But I think if you're an ancient hominid,

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:41.520
 then sometimes you just have to go for these things. Yeah, fear isn't in your vocabulary.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.440
 You don't have a vocabulary. You're an ancient hominid. What are they what are they hunting

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.940
 with? So they're hunting with different kinds of tools. This is those of you haven't worked

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:56.180
 it out. It's homophoresiensis who we nickname the hobbit. They're these miniature humans.

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.820
 There are different species. They live on this one island and they lived lived on this

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:06.960
 one island in Indonesia called Flores. And when they were discovered, I remember being

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:13.280
 a student at the time. It was like just it was a bombshell. It was a bombshell of discovery.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.920
 Because basically they were arguing that these tiny humans were human. And you've got to

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:23.080
 imagine they are like literally three and a half feet. So that's one meter tall. Like

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:29.840
 the size of a three year old. Yeah, a small penguin. And what is even more fantastical

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.900
 is that they were on this island with giant Komodo dragons standard, giant rats, giant

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.740
 Marabu carnivorous storks that are taller than me. So like, you know, six foot, et cetera,

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:45.580
 et cetera. And then obviously these miniature elephant called stegodons.

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.260
 So they and the elephants are the only small things on that. It's really weird how it's

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.500
 an island to either make things very big or very small island dwarfism. Yeah.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.980
 So why do other things get big on islands? Is it because there's no predators and they

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:03.240
 can. So the theory with island dwarfism is the large animals get small because they have

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:08.600
 fewer resources. And small animals get large because they have fewer predators. And it's

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:14.320
 called island dwarfism, sometimes island gigantism, depending on your position. It's the same.

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.240
 It's the same biological phenomenon that we think is happening. So cool. But to see it

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:25.040
 with humans is wild. So I was trying to picture what height a penguin is because there's lots

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:29.660
 of different sizes. Yeah, that's right. So if you want to picture it at home as a possible

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:35.340
 equivalent, picture an Ewok from Star Wars, picture a goblin from the movie Labyrinth.

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:41.900
 Any real things? Yes. Professor Flitwick from Harry Potter, if you're familiar. Well, can

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:46.140
 you can you work out the thread that I'm doing here? They all play by the same person. Warwick

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:51.200
 Davis. Warwick Davis is three foot seven. Is he Warwick or Warwick? I think he's Warwick.

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:56.860
 What did I say? Warwick. And also, is it Professor Flitwick or Flitic? Because there's a place

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:03.020
 called Flitic. It is Flitwick, but Warwick. I can see why we've got confused. Let's all

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:08.460
 calm down. Well, okay. So it's the same height as Warwick Davis. He's three foot seven. And

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:12.900
 that's roughly the same height. I'm just saying it's a teeny bit taller than the hobbit. Well,

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:17.980
 1.1 meter. Yeah, it's like it's like one. Yeah, it's not much. One inch. Yeah, it's very

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:21.440
 tight. I mean, if you're three and a half feet, I'm sorry, one inch is a big deal. That's

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.600
 true. Sure. Sure. But I thought there were penguins back in the day that were as tall

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:31.280
 as Kylie Minogue is now. So she's, what, five foot? She's five and a bit. Yeah. Okay. Five

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:36.720
 two maybe. So I'm sure that's right, isn't it? So that these little guys are yours. That's

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:40.360
 interesting. She's five two. Yeah. Don't hold me to that, but she's about five. You're

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:45.520
 the Australian in the family. Do you cover a lot of this in your new series? Yeah, we

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:51.060
 were looking at Ewoks. Okay. So this series human that's, it's going out right now on

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:56.700
 BBC iPlayer, also Americans, if you're listening, it goes on on PBS. One of the interesting

00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:01.540
 things that was happening is that I was so aware of all the politics that goes on behind

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:06.140
 the scenes with these new discoveries, but it doesn't necessarily make the cut of, of

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:09.980
 you know, a landmark science series. So for example, one of the things that happened when

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:17.320
 they first announced these, these hobbit species is that there were like showdowns in anthropology

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:23.460
 conferences, like people screaming at each other because there was absolute disbelief.

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:27.200
 These are massive names in paleoanthropology. As in how did we miss, how could you miss

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:32.320
 this in the fossil record? Like this is not a new species of human. This is just a homo sapien

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:37.320
 with microcephaly. And when you say new species of human, I'm sorry to be dense, but it could

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:42.740
 be just a small one of us homo sapiens. Yeah. Yeah. So, so the thing that we think now is

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:47.020
 that it's a different species of human, just like a Neanderthal or, you know, one of these

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:50.940
 other species of human. However, when they first announced it, it was so shocking to

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:56.300
 people that there was a human with a brain the size of a chimpanzee, a brain the size

00:07:56.300 --> 00:08:01.260
 of orange. The size of a chimpanzee's brain. There we go. Thank you very much. Thank you.

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:08.600
 Weirdly, Kylie Minogue has a brain the size of a full chimpanzee. Yeah. All right. Yeah.

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:12.840
 People couldn't fathom the idea that these humans were able to walk upright while making

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:19.680
 stone tools, were possibly using fire, but had brains the size of grapefruits or oranges.

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:24.200
 And so they were just, they were showdowns. Like people would, I remember being at one

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:29.000
 conference in America where these big professors were screaming at each other. Really? Can I

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.980
 ask a question? Is it now everyone agrees that it's a new species or are there still

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:38.500
 some outliers who say now it's wrong? No, it's pretty much everybody accepts. I mean,

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:43.740
 I'm sure there are a few, but they've found too many examples of it from very different

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:48.620
 time periods. This also wasn't the only showdown, by the way. Because when it, when this started

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:51.660
 happening, one of the scientists who's part of the discovery in New Zealand are called

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:56.940
 Brent Allaway. He started going on tour talking about this and the word hobbit started being

00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:03.940
 used immediately and he effectively got a cease and desist from Tolkien's estate. Yeah.

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:08.960
 Saying you cannot call this hobbit. This is our trademark word because the word pushes,

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:12.280
 they might have been joke pushes, but to call it homo hobbitous. Yeah. Right. Right. Like

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:15.720
 that was part of, you can't stop scientists from calling things what they want.

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:19.120
 That's what people were saying. Things crazy thing. No, but Hobbit hit like, so Brent

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:22.520
 Allaway was saying, this is a word that's in the dictionary now. Like it's gone beyond

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:26.980
 this bit of fiction. Also Dickens use the word hobbit because hobbit was an existing

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:31.380
 word. I didn't know that. Well, he didn't use it for an animal, but it was for like

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:36.380
 weight of barley if you were selling it. It was a unit of measurement. Yeah. Cause Tolkien

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:44.380
 was a bit hack like that. Wasn't he? Say that again? Who's it? Sam? What's he called?

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:49.860
 Samwise Gamgee. Gamgee is the name of a dressing for first aid or something. Like he got lots

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:53.800
 of his words from like unusual English words. Yeah. And I think there's even folklore where

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:58.600
 Hobbit is connected to a creature as well. Okay. Even further back. So it's not like

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:03.640
 he invented it, but yeah, he had to stop calling it that. So actually we've run into that problem.

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:09.360
 Really? Yeah. So we have to be careful in how we use the word hobbit. If it's a purely

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:15.000
 marketing exercise, it's, it's, we've got to be really careful. Wow. Well, we're a podcast.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:24.300
 So hobbit, hobbit, hobbit, hobbit. That's crazy. Yeah. Yeah. And I feel really conflicted

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:29.020
 about it because I was brought up in Birmingham right next to some of the oratory and a bunch

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:32.740
 of other kind of buildings where, which Tolkien based, as I think there's all this love for

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:41.940
 Tolkien. Come on. A lot of Mordor was based on. Yeah. Literally. All right, all right.

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:45.640
 I think it's a good case. So like big feet, they do have big feet, right? The flores.

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:51.880
 Yes. Relative to their, relative to their legs. So if you looked at their feet on their

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:54.600
 own, you wouldn't necessarily think, oh, those are massive feet. But when you understand

00:10:54.600 --> 00:11:00.360
 that the legs are really short, you're like, okay, relatively those feet. So they live

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:07.840
 underground. These ones are all found in a cave. They might have been sheltering maybe

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:14.060
 not skilled rock throwers. Hobbits are in the book. Are they? Hobbits are. Yeah. And

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:19.900
 these guys, they use stone tools. Yeah. There we go. The archaeologist in me is dying right

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:25.940
 now. The idea that like stone tools and lithics are just throwing objects. Are they resilient

00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:32.860
 against dark magic? You're a lot. Were they friends with the elves? Are any of you guys

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:37.740
 going to bring up the local legend? No. Okay, go on. You say it because I've spoken loads.

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:43.200
 No, are they still around? Because look, it's a small and densely occupied island. Yeah.

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:49.480
 But there have been strange rumors of little things in the underground with big feet. Small

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:54.040
 man with big feet. There's a professor called Gregory fourth. He studied them for about

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:59.280
 40 years. And a few of the local people, he the Leo people he'd spoken to said they'd

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:05.440
 seen one of these things more than one more than one. Yeah. And over to my cryptid colleague.

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:09.620
 Well, yeah, he wrote this book between ape and human and he says the Leo people constantly

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:13.140
 say yes, these what you're describing are still out there. 30 different people have

00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:18.540
 said that that they're still out there. But you obviously probably think not. And so do

00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:26.220
 I just for the record. He's pointing at me. The scientist in the room destroying all joy.

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:33.900
 Okay, so when they first announced the discovery of the hobbit, this folklore was talked about

00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:39.600
 a lot, a lot, a lot, because people were basically saying, look, the description. And what was

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:46.960
 it? It was something like this, the small big feet, resistant to dark magic. Love a

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:52.560
 second breakfast. You could chuck the hell out of a rock. No, I mean, it matches the

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:56.560
 description basically to what they're saying with height and a type of human that are not

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:57.560
 like us.

00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:03.520
 Take our question, Ella, did humans, homo sapiens and florensis ever hang out together?

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:08.560
 Okay, so there's two things. One is, with regards to that legend, people were basically

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:12.900
 saying, look, is it possible that them still living on the island feels far fetched, but

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:17.480
 it's it's oral tradition being passed on over some generations. When they first discovered

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:22.520
 the hobbit or homo florensis, they did think that they died out about 17,000 years ago.

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:27.500
 So 17,000 years ago, some long time. But is that really unfathomable to think that an

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:32.400
 oral tradition would be passed down as possible. But now they think, but then they redid the

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:37.560
 dates and they actually think that a homo florensis died out around 50,000 years ago. So it does

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:43.320
 become a bit more far fetched. However, we truthfully don't know how long oral tradition

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:49.480
 and memory is retained within human communities. 50,000 years is that's a stretch, but we

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:50.480
 truthfully have no single data point.

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:53.040
 And there were humans living there around that time.

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:57.340
 So yeah, for around 50,000 years, we think we turned up. So if you if you look at the

00:13:57.340 --> 00:14:01.820
 actual archaeological layers, you've got loads of the hobbit. And then basically there's

00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:06.140
 this massive volcanic eruption, the hobbits and their stone tools disappear. And then

00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:12.180
 on top of that, we turn up. So you can argue that they went extinct and then we turned

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:16.460
 up. I think it's more accurate to say they were on their last leg. And then we turned

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:17.460
 up.

00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:21.140
 Yeah, I read that there was maybe a problem that volcanoes might cause climate change.

00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:24.780
 They had to move to the edge of the island. And when you move to the edge of the island,

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:30.080
 you're going to come across seafaring homo sapiens. And then they might kill you off.

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:33.980
 The final blow came from humans, but like you say, of course, we don't know.

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:38.080
 But it feels powerfully convenient, doesn't it? Like the way homo sapiens turns up everywhere

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:42.820
 and all other large mammals die mysteriously, very shortly, like the ground slots in South

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:47.120
 America and the giant kangaroos in Australia, like it's yeah, that whole narrative is really

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:52.620
 contested within paleo. But I just find it really, it's a pattern. So it's every single

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:56.660
 case, yes, individually, every single data point you can take apart and you can go, well,

00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:59.880
 technically, there's not enough evidence, but then as a collective whole when you look

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:04.620
 at the planet and you see that that is just a pattern, we turn up low and behold, everything

00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:07.700
 else disappears. You kind of go, Oh, come on, guys, like, okay,

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:10.060
 we just might be just really bad luck.

00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:16.700
 Yeah, yeah, Norman Bates is just a normal motel owner and people haven't keep going missing.

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:22.360
 No, it's not his fault. He's just going to fix something with an axe work trip. Oh, no,

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:29.080
 killed another. So you saying that they're still here? Is that what you're saying?

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:34.440
 Do you think, Ella, there are more potential human species out there that we haven't found

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:37.600
 in the fossil record? Oh, yeah, we were like having massive discussions

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:43.760
 in in the series about what number to give, because I was like, there was more than the

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:47.420
 magnificent seven. Are there a few already found that are waiting

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:51.940
 for approval? Yeah, waiting for approval. I love that. I don't know what you think goes

00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:56.780
 on in paleoanthropology like this at the Natural History Museum. There's a man who sits there

00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:59.380
 and you come to him and you present the case that there's a new species.

00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:04.700
 He stamps the bone. Yeah, approved. But yeah, I reckon that I reckon already

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:07.540
 that's an underestimate. I think what you need to do is go to a

00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:13.020
 part of the world and then work out when humans arrive there and then look in the fossil record

00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:15.840
 at that exact moment. And then that's how we find them.

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:22.120
 Yes, great shout. How small could we get? Like, why are they not people the size of

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:26.440
 wasps? Is there no evolutionary advantage to us getting really small?

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:30.840
 Can I ask another question that's related to Andy's question? When you look in the

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:38.200
 fossil record, you get the lizards and then you get enormous dinosaurs and then you get

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:42.520
 sloths and you get enormous sloths and all these animals have enormous versions of them

00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:44.820
 from history. But why are they not enormous humans?

00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:48.640
 Do you know what? You sound like my comments section of all of my social media.

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:52.540
 Hello, what about what about Giants, Ellie? Keep talking about hobbits. What about Giants?

00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:55.980
 Why don't you come with Giants? Why are the government holding this from us?

00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:59.420
 Like, you know how trees can only get so high before gravity stops them?

00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:03.260
 Do we have a height limit as hominids? See, if I had to hazard a guess, I know

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:06.580
 you guys aren't taking this seriously, but... Excuse me.

00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:12.020
 You might find this hilarious. I think the brain is so expensive and our

00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:16.880
 brain is already way too expensive. Like, our kids are basically born premature.

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:21.560
 Right. Let's be honest, because our brains are too big. So I think if you start looking

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:25.700
 at giant humans, that brain would just be so expensive and every take up too much energy

00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:28.480
 and nightmare for childbirth, blah, blah, blah, just don't think.

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:33.760
 I'm not sure how expensive my brain is. I feel like that was a discount deal my parents got.

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:43.820
 Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is my fact. My fact this week is that there

00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:50.100
 is a hugely popular subgenre of science fiction novels called "Mondayn Sci-Fi".

00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:52.920
 Very good. Some of us might think, "Golf sci-fi is mundane".

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:58.760
 Well, we've... Yeah. Listener, something happened in the break just now.

00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:04.840
 "Mondayn Sci-Fi". This is a sci-fi genre for people who don't like aliens or interstellar travel,

00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:10.600
 time travel, all the things that are not as it were realistic. "Mondayn Sci-Fi" brings you back

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:15.400
 to what is the near future? A lot of people will be saying for whatever books I'm about to say,

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:21.160
 "That's not mundane sci-fi. That's hard sci-fi". So there's a little bit of gray area between what

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:26.600
 qualifies for each subgenre. Say like the Martian. Andy, where's the Martian? So we make it to Mars,

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:29.640
 which is possible. You get stuck there. How do you survive on Mars?

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:31.400
 So does that count as mundane? Yeah.

00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:33.880
 Does it? Even though humans can't go to Mars yet?

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:36.360
 Because it's a very achievable near future thing.

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:41.320
 So it's not like, you know, I bought a new alarm clock. Like that far in the future,

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:45.080
 it's much further than that. Yeah, no. It's trying to take existing technologies

00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:47.320
 and enhance them too. It's plausible.

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:52.200
 It's plausible. Whereas you can't just say, "I whacked on warp drive and went over to Alpha Centauri

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:57.480
 for the fatigue" or whatever. So hold on. This community, do they police each other and themselves?

00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:01.880
 No, but everything has subgenres, right? So if you go into a sci-fi and fantasy shop,

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:06.040
 it's easier to be going, "I'm going to head to the hard sci-fi section or I'm going to have, you

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:10.440
 know, there's anthropology science fiction that you can go to." It's just a way of bracketing

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:13.800
 certain science fiction books together in the way that you would romantic fiction or

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:19.160
 Jurassic Park might be another example of mundane sci-fi, a very achievable thing that is

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:22.360
 actually happening now where we're taking DNA and we're trying to learn.

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:29.640
 No, no, but it's not loopy. Yeah, then like it is the idea of using DNA to get dinosaurs is loopy,

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:33.400
 right? It's about where the line is. But it's still science fiction,

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:36.760
 isn't it? So it's not like saying that the science is definitely going to work. It's still

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:42.040
 science fiction. The word mundane used to mean, and I still use it this way,

00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:46.200
 anything that's in the universe is mundane and anything that's outside the universe is extra

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:52.600
 mundane. Lovely. And it was like used in religious settings. So like we live on the mundane earth,

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:57.400
 but heaven, where God is, that's in the extra mundane. And that's the original use of that word.

00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:59.880
 Because Mundus is the earth. For the earth in Latin, yeah.

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:06.280
 Like Contramundum against the earth is precisely. Yeah. In my opinion, anything that's mundane

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:10.520
 should be on the earth and anything that's like Andy Weir's The Martian should be extra mundane

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:14.200
 because it's off the earth. That's good. That's a sub-sub genre within the mundane genre.

00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:19.320
 Do you think this conversation is getting mundane? Extra mundane. Well, here's a good

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:24.840
 fact to Lobbyn, just going back to the last fact about the height of penguins. So Jurassic Park,

00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:29.240
 Michael Crichton, the writer of Jurassic Park. Yeah. Janelle Tolly was?

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:34.440
 Five two. He was six foot nine. Okay. Imagine, it's like, oh, the writer of Jurassic Park is

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:39.240
 going to come in and in walks a fucking dinosaur. Like the guy is the height. Two and a half penguins.

00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:44.040
 Do you know how women like men who are tall, you know, there's this like thing about,

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:49.000
 it's like caused a problem on the dating apps because it now means that like women are just

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.320
 skewing really tall, whereas if you met people in real life, blah, blah, blah. So what I love

00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:57.400
 about this is a bunch of us tall women started going around pointing out that leave the tall

00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:01.960
 men alone because they will die younger. Because statistically they will die younger.

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:07.080
 They keep banging their heads on somebody. So the thinking is...

00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:12.040
 Is it because the gravity collapses their heads into their body?

00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:13.160
 Asteroids hit them first.

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:22.040
 You're basically, there's just more of you for blood circulation and all the rest.

00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:25.320
 More of your cells that can get cancer. Yeah. And it's just more of it.

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:30.440
 But it is wild because like basically tall men have been told their whole lives that they're

00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:35.240
 better and you've seen all the statistics on, they earn more, they this, that and the other.

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:38.920
 And actually they do die younger. Like the plot points...

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:40.360
 What height though? What height?

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:41.880
 It's just a gradual process.

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:43.480
 Oh, okay. And all...

00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:48.040
 Everything over six to you tend to end up being shagged to death by women who adore tall men.

00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:49.000
 Yeah, it's a problem.

00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:55.640
 This mundane sci-fi thing, I think it was written in 2004 as a class of sci-fi writers doing a

00:21:55.640 --> 00:22:00.360
 sort of thought experiment really, because they were sick of really escapist sci-fi.

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:03.960
 They said this doesn't reflect the actual, you know, interests and problems and

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:07.960
 fascinating stuff that you do get in civilization these days.

00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:12.280
 So Jeff Reiman was the only person who put his name to it, he's the only person named on it.

00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:16.920
 So it's not totally serious, but it did really annoy a lot of people at the time.

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:21.160
 Because you'll be amazed here that sci-fi fans get irritated about classification

00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:23.000
 and genre and all of this stuff.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:28.920
 So there's hard SF, which is like where it's mostly about the science bit of the science fiction.

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:33.880
 And arguably Jurassic Park and the Martian sit in between mundane and hard sci-fi.

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:37.000
 Yeah, there's soft SF, which is much more about the human, you know.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:41.880
 So even though Dune is kind of about, you know, it's a long time ago and the galaxy far, far away

00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:44.520
 and all that, it is sort of soft because there's a lot of political stuff.

00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:48.920
 Is that NSFW, where it's not science fiction for work?

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:51.400
 Actually, lots of it these days.

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:52.360
 Oh yeah.

00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:58.840
 But lots of science fiction fans say that sci-fi, they call it skiffy rather dismissively,

00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:01.720
 they say that's not proper science fiction because that's not based in science.

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:04.600
 So Star Wars is not sci-fi, it's just fantasy.

00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:06.040
 They call what they like SF.

00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:07.880
 But then people say, what do you like reading?

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:09.720
 And they say SF and they say, oh, do you mean sci-fi?

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:10.280
 They say, no.

00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:12.680
 And they say, oh, I like sci-fi too.

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:14.840
 And they're like, no, no, no, not sci-fi.

00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:15.560
 I like SF.

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:18.120
 It's a big world out there.

00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:20.600
 All I'll say is, Andy, is you deal with the emails.

00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:21.640
 I know.

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:22.920
 I write mundane sci-fi.

00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:24.680
 My first two books are mundane sci-fi.

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:26.680
 I would agree with the first half of that.

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:27.160
 Thank you.

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:28.840
 Thank you so much.

00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:33.800
 The idea of sci-fi, we have the books are out there, very important.

00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:37.480
 Scientists read sci-fi because it does help them think differently about the future.

00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:41.400
 And quite often, as we know from Isaac Asimov books and Arthur C Clarke,

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:44.200
 a lot of the predictions of inventions have been made.

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:46.120
 And that's not a prediction like a premonition.

00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:48.200
 People read those books and go, I want to make that.

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:52.600
 So companies actually hire sci-fi writers to write specific things for them

00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:55.800
 so that there might be inventions that can inspire their workers.

00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:57.800
 There's a bunch of companies that do this.

00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:02.760
 Hershey's, the chocolate company, hire sci-fi writers to write sci-fi based on.

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:07.960
 So then Hershey reads this sci-fi and they think, oh, maybe we could make a chocolate

00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:09.160
 that orbits the Earth.

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:10.600
 Yes, exactly.

00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:11.480
 That would work on me.

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:14.680
 No, I don't think that would work on you three as well.

00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:19.720
 Like, if you hired in a science fiction writer to describe what the future of this

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:22.200
 podcast looks like, I can see you guys being quite a bit.

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:25.720
 I see the actual future and it's four of us heads in jars.

00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:29.240
 Just blathering on about some facts or other.

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:29.720
 Yeah.

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:31.240
 But they do it and even armies do it.

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:34.200
 So the French army, they have a red team and that is,

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:39.160
 they've hired six sci-fi writers to try and picture what future warfare will be like.

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:41.000
 I'm not just making this up.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.440
 This is a real thing.

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:45.000
 It's simply about a way of generating ideas, isn't it?

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:45.400
 Absolutely.

00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:48.200
 So they have a team of five or six science fiction writers.

00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:50.920
 They might be defunct now, but in 2019, they certainly did.

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:53.800
 It's a small budget compared with the latest bit of military hardware.

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:55.000
 You may as well give it a go.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:55.880
 I completely buy it.

00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:58.760
 Are they getting the best sci-fi writers to do these jobs?

00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:00.840
 Or are they getting people who can't sell their books?

00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:01.720
 Well, that's the question.

00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:03.320
 What is a good sci-fi writer?

00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:07.480
 Because you can be, you can have a lot of books, but they could all be terrible,

00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:09.160
 but they're published.

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:13.080
 You might just have one or two crisp early career ones though, which are terrific.

00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:15.560
 And even though your fiction has moved in a different direction,

00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:18.760
 those two remain very much present.

00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:20.040
 Yeah, yeah.

00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:22.440
 I really admire science fiction writers though, who just go for it.

00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:25.240
 Like there's a guy, Andy said, thank you, silently.

00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:29.080
 There's a guy called Lionel Fanthorpe.

00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:31.160
 He's 90 years old.

00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:31.720
 Fanthorpe?

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:33.000
 Yeah, he's still alive.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.520
 He's a retired British priest.

00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:39.000
 He's also worked as a lecturer, a teacher, a television presenter and a dental technician.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:46.360
 And he has written over 180 sci-fi stories and novels, 89 of which he wrote in a three-year period.

00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:50.760
 So he was averaging 158 pages every 12 days.

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:53.560
 And he was part of a company that was called Badger Books.

00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:57.560
 And they were just, you know, those classic sci-fi covers where it's really illustrated,

00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:01.000
 RT, it might be like an alien pointing a laser gun.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:06.040
 They would have those covers commissioned and in some cases already attached to other books.

00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:08.680
 And they would just take that cover and go, write that.

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:09.320
 I like it.

00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:12.200
 I like that because it's hard to come up with ideas, isn't it?

00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:13.000
 It is.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:13.560
 Is it?

00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:13.880
 Yeah.

00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:21.160
 Anyway, so some of the words in sci-fi, absolute bog standard sci-fi words,

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:24.600
 were used for other things in the past.

00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:31.400
 Okay, so the word starship was used in the 17th century to describe a Southern constellation

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:34.520
 of stars, the Argo constellation.

00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:39.720
 So can you guess what the word blaster meant in the 16th century?

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:44.360
 I think that's a young man like out on the tiles.

00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:45.080
 He's a blaster.

00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:46.040
 He's a blaster.

00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:47.320
 Yeah, no, it's not that.

00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:49.320
 So it's a bad case of diarrhea.

00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:50.200
 It's not that either.

00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:52.040
 It was someone who plays the trumpet.

00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:53.000
 Oh, nice.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:53.720
 It was a blaster.

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:54.280
 Okay.

00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:58.120
 Do you know what a trek he was in 19th century South Africa?

00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:03.800
 So it's not someone just walking like a tour guide walker?

00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:04.600
 Pretty close.

00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:05.960
 Tracking animals?

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:07.560
 No, it's Dan's closer.

00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:10.440
 It was a group of people who were on a trek.

00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:12.040
 You would call the whole group a trekky.

00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:12.280
 Okay.

00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:13.160
 So it's plural.

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:14.280
 What's the singular?

00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:15.400
 Well, a trekker.

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:15.960
 A trekker.

00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:16.840
 I guess.

00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:20.520
 And in the 19th century, do you know what Ant-Man meant?

00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:20.760
 No.

00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:22.200
 Can you guess?

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:24.040
 Was it like pest control?

00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:25.640
 Someone who would literally come to your house?

00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:26.600
 The Ant-Man.

00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:27.640
 The Ant-Man's here.

00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:28.040
 It was.

00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:29.800
 It had two meanings in the 19th century.

00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:35.160
 It was a person who destroys ants' nests or a person who specializes in the study of ants.

00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:36.200
 Right.

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:38.360
 And I'm sure that led to some hilarious mix-ups.

00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:41.400
 And in the other direction, the word vape,

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:43.800
 which now means to smokey cigarettes,

00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:47.240
 it originally meant to vaporize someone with a weapon.

00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:47.480
 Oh.

00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:50.600
 And that was used in sci-fi in the early 20th century.

00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:51.320
 Great.

00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:55.240
 And do you know that the word monobrow was first used in science fiction?

00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:55.880
 Was it?

00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:56.120
 Yeah.

00:27:57.320 --> 00:28:00.280
 And it was used 10 years after Frida Kahlo died.

00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:06.280
 So no one could have called Frida Kahlo a monobrow in her lifetime because the word didn't exist.

00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:08.040
 We just did Frida Kahlo on a previous episode.

00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:08.840
 That's why I brought it up.

00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:10.280
 And I can't believe we didn't know that.

00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:13.240
 We were just saying monobrow the whole way through and she wouldn't have known the word monobrow.

00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:13.880
 She wouldn't have known that word.

00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:14.440
 That's crazy.

00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:15.080
 That's incredible.

00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:15.560
 Makes you think.

00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:16.840
 Yeah.

00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:17.560
 What does it make you think?

00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:18.120
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:19.160
 It's funny, isn't it?

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:20.680
 You know, sometimes you don't know your legacy.

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:21.320
 Yeah.

00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:21.720
 Yeah.

00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:26.680
 So you two, Ella and James, you said you don't read fiction.

00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:27.720
 Not really.

00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:29.160
 I mean, I have read some.

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:30.120
 Yeah.

00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:35.240
 But do you think that reading a science fiction text is any different to reading a

00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:38.120
 standard fiction text like literary fiction?

00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:41.160
 Do you think the quality of the reading you do will change at all between those?

00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:45.960
 I feel like probably if I read like some Russian literature,

00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:47.800
 I feel like I concentrate more.

00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:48.280
 Okay.

00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:48.680
 Okay.

00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:49.080
 Exactly.

00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:53.640
 And if I'm reading like I have read Andy Weir's stuff and I feel like I just flick through it a little bit.

00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:56.280
 So this was a study that was done in 2017.

00:28:56.280 --> 00:29:01.880
 It was a scientific journal and they presented 150 people, a 1000 word piece of text.

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:04.840
 One was someone going into a diner in a small town,

00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:09.160
 you know, like a sort of standard bit of Americana modern fiction.

00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:12.520
 And the other was a guy going into a space station galley.

00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:15.160
 And you know, there's all sorts of weird stuff going on and weird aliens.

00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:22.520
 And what they found at the time was that people who were given the sci-fi text put way less effort

00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:24.600
 into reading way less concentration.

00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:30.440
 But the authors of that study did a separate follow-up two years later and they found they were wrong.

00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:36.120
 So they then did a better control and experiment where they gave people exactly the same text.

00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:40.200
 And text one started with my daughter is standing behind the bar polishing a wineglass

00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:44.120
 against a white cloth and the alternate version just had one word different.

00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:46.120
 I said my alien.

00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:47.080
 It said my robot.

00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:47.560
 My robot.

00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:50.440
 But apart from that, it was exactly the same.

00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:55.880
 And people read it with exactly the same concentration and empathy and all the levels of that.

00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:57.320
 So what does what are we saying here?

00:29:57.320 --> 00:30:02.360
 I think people read pulpy sci-fi less well by unholstered my laser gun.

00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:05.160
 But if it was a really well written sci-fi book,

00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:08.680
 like someone who might have written two sci-fi books earlier in their career,

00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:10.360
 then you would pay attention to that one.

00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:11.080
 You'd hope so.

00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:11.560
 Yeah.

00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:12.360
 Yeah.

00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:15.720
 That also just sounds like potentially an obvious interpretation of that is that

00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:17.880
 they broke our sci-fi the first time around.

00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:19.000
 Maybe. Yeah. Yeah.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.880
 Maybe it was, you know, like it's not even schlock.

00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:24.600
 Yeah. What James is saying is just that they didn't write very well.

00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:25.880
 Are we still talking about Andy's books here?

00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:35.640
 Okay.

00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:38.680
 It is time for fact number three and that is James.

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:39.000
 Okay.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:44.440
 My fact this week is that 18th century Austrians preserved their dead by shoving twigs up their bum.

00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:45.640
 Wow.

00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:50.360
 So you'd put it up your bum in the hope that it would.

00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:52.280
 Not your own bum.

00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:53.560
 Not your own bum.

00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:54.920
 It was the bum of the dead.

00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:55.960
 The bum of the dead.

00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:57.720
 The bum of the dead.

00:30:57.720 --> 00:31:00.600
 That was the ancient Egyptian book we all wanted to read, wasn't it?

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:02.280
 The bum of the dead.

00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:08.040
 Yeah. So this is a study from this year in the journal Frontiers in Medicine.

00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:12.920
 And they analysed a mummy in an Austrian village, which is quite well known.

00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:17.960
 And it was of a priest and it had supposedly done some miracles and stuff.

00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:22.440
 But one of the things about it is it hadn't decayed very much this body and they wanted to know why.

00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:28.680
 And so they did a CT scan and they found that the abdomen contained quite a lot of wood chips,

00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:32.760
 twigs, fabric, zinc chloride, they said was in it.

00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:35.000
 But zinc chloride wasn't invented at that time.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.880
 So I think it must be just like some rocks that had zinc in them.

00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:42.280
 And that had stopped the inside of the body from rotting,

00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:46.120
 which had managed to keep the body relatively intact.

00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:49.640
 And it seems that we don't really know why they did that.

00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:54.200
 But what it might have been is that they wanted to move the body from one place to another.

00:31:54.200 --> 00:32:00.120
 And in quite a lot of places around the world, they would try and embalm or preserve a body

00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:02.680
 a little bit so that you can get it to the burial ground first.

00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:04.120
 And that might have been what happened here.

00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:05.800
 So yeah, we don't really know.

00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:08.280
 It was drawing him from the inside out, basically.

00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:12.520
 Yeah, like quite often the first thing to go will be your internal fluids will start

00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:13.880
 rotting away on the inside.

00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:16.280
 And that's what will help rot away the whole body.

00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:17.400
 So it's basically a plug?

00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:18.040
 It's a what, sorry?

00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:18.600
 It's a plug.

00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:20.040
 It's a plug, yeah.

00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:21.400
 I thought it was absorbing though.

00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:22.840
 I thought it was like putting your phone in rice.

00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:24.840
 It is a bit like that, yeah.

00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:28.040
 It's a bit like taxidermy, I would say, that kind of thing.

00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:28.360
 Yeah.

00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:31.320
 You know, taking the animal and taking the insides out and shoving stuff up there.

00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:32.920
 Yeah, you're putting the rice in the phone, actually.

00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:34.280
 Exactly, that's the difference.

00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:40.120
 This place where they found the mummy is just over an hour's drive from where all of my family

00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:41.480
 live in Austria.

00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:42.360
 This is quite possible.

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:44.440
 There's a lot of shribers in the ground with twigs up their ass.

00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:47.480
 I'm very excited by that.

00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:53.320
 Talking about famously preserved Austrians, you know, Otsi, you know, they did a DNA,

00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:55.800
 they did some DNA on him a while back.

00:32:55.800 --> 00:33:02.760
 And obviously he was accidentally preserved, but they discovered that he had 19 living male relatives

00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:04.920
 in Austria today.

00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:10.520
 But in the articles, they always explained that his descendants have not been notified.

00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:12.920
 And so maybe you're one of the descendants.

00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:14.920
 Did he have an unusually small brain?

00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:23.320
 That's a heck of a Jeremy Kyle show where they've done the DNA test on the Iceman.

00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:29.000
 I think that would be so cool as a TV show to go to all these people and say this is your relative.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:29.880
 Absolutely, yeah.

00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:31.720
 Is there an inheritance that you're dishing out?

00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:34.040
 Like, well, it'd just be the seeds from his stomach.

00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:39.320
 Otsi's leather sandals are finally coming home.

00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:41.720
 Why haven't they notified them?

00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:43.560
 I would want to know, wouldn't you want to know?

00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:44.040
 Absolutely.

00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:44.440
 Of course.

00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:45.720
 Yeah, I'm game.

00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:50.760
 But Ella, like preserving bodies and stuff, you must touch on that in your work occasionally.

00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:58.200
 So not particularly, because I don't really, I only wake up for bone, not for any soft tissue.

00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:02.840
 I haven't done that for every time a woman had told me that.

00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:07.800
 No, but okay.

00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:15.240
 But I do find this really, really interesting because you often come across accidental preservation

00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:19.960
 in the kind of stuff that we do, because you'll be at the back of a cave and, you know, or

00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:24.280
 some of my favorite stories are like, you get somewhere and you think you're the first person

00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:27.000
 to enter into that particular cave or onto that rock.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.520
 And you're like, nah, crap, because basically the ancestors already got there and it's like

00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:35.160
 their burial ground and they will have like embalmed or, I remember being really intrigued

00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:40.600
 because I think so often people think that mummification is an Egyptian thing.

00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:46.040
 But actually, all these cultures around the world have their own mummification process.

00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:49.640
 And for me, the interesting thing about that is they're clearly using local materials.

00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:56.440
 So for example, in Yemen, they have a local mummy culture and they used raisins and camel fat.

00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:59.320
 And as an Arab, I'm like, that sounds kind of quite tasty.

00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:01.560
 No, that sounds yum.

00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:02.520
 There's some of that.

00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:03.560
 That's stuffing, isn't it?

00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:07.880
 It's basically that I remember reading somewhere that it was,

00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:13.160
 they described the Yemeni culture as artisanal mummification and artisanal mummification.

00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:13.960
 Yeah.

00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:14.760
 What period is this?

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:18.920
 Like, as in, are the ancient Egyptians our first example or does it go way further back?

00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:24.280
 I think the first culture we found it happening really in widespread way is the Chincharo people.

00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:25.400
 That's Latin America.

00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:26.840
 Yeah, Chile and Peru.

00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:29.480
 That's a thousand years before the Egyptians thought of it.

00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:33.560
 I think everyone got mummified because in Egypt, it was just the nobles, right?

00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:33.880
 Yeah.

00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:40.200
 And the Chincharo, they had a, well, see if this is as appealing as raisins and camel fat.

00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:41.640
 You get your organs removed.

00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:45.320
 Then they'd be replaced with a paste made of ash, water and sea lion blood.

00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:46.520
 Oh.

00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:46.920
 Yeah.

00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:47.320
 Wow.

00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:51.800
 And then that same paste is used to make a mask and the model of your sexual organs.

00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:55.960
 And then you're painted black, polished until you're shiny and given a wig.

00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:56.280
 Okay.

00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:59.320
 What state are you in for the genital bit?

00:35:59.320 --> 00:35:59.720
 You're not feeling good.

00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:00.040
 You're not feeling good.

00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:01.240
 You're talking phone or off-picture?

00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:05.240
 I've seen some of those mummies for sure.

00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:08.600
 I think they had them in Bolton Museum, I think, for a while at least.

00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:09.640
 Really?

00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:14.520
 And they were quite big in the early 20th century, weren't they?

00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:18.920
 There was one in Paris that was really famous and there's quite a lot of famous works were based on it.

00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:23.560
 Like, definitely Monk's The Scream was based on, he saw this mummy and thought,

00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:24.840
 "I'm going to paint something like that."

00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:31.640
 But the oldest, actual preserved body we have is from Portugal, 8,000 years old.

00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:35.800
 But again, we think that they just preserved it so they could move it to another burial ground

00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:37.720
 and then something happened and yeah.

00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:38.680
 Yeah, wow.

00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:41.560
 So I was in Edinburgh the other day and I went for a quick drive

00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:45.080
 out to what is quite a famous chapel called Roslyn Chapel.

00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:46.360
 Oh, Jesus Christ.

00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:46.840
 It's a temple.

00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:47.640
 From the Da Vinci Code.

00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:48.520
 From the Da Vinci Code.

00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:51.160
 It's supposedly they were protecting the bloodline of Christ.

00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:53.720
 It's where the Da Vinci Code culminates in as a thing.

00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:55.160
 So while we were waiting to-

00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:55.880
 That I read.

00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:57.320
 I'm not going to lie, that I read.

00:36:57.320 --> 00:37:03.720
 I thought it was good, don't judge me.

00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:05.480
 Yeah, yeah, it's not bad.

00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:07.000
 But so we were waiting to go in there.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:10.520
 We went to a cafe that's across the road and it was called Dolly's Cafe.

00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:17.000
 We start noticing lots of sheep imagery and then on the wall are photos of a black and white sheep

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.440
 and it is Dolly the sheep.

00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:21.400
 And because it Roslyn Institute right next to it

00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:22.040
 were the ones who-

00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:23.880
 Oh, I didn't know that they were related.

00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:24.200
 Yeah.

00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:26.840
 So we bumped into a few people and one person told me,

00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:28.120
 so this is some gossip.

00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:33.800
 Apparently when Dolly was getting a bit iller and so on and later in age,

00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:35.800
 they had someone on standby, a taxidermist,

00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:38.120
 because the idea was they were going to immediately do taxidermy

00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:41.000
 and take Dolly to one of the museums in Edinburgh.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:41.480
 Right.

00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:44.680
 And then they went on holiday and while they were away,

00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:47.400
 somewhere in Corfu or wherever, Dolly died.

00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:50.200
 And there was a huge scramble to find a local taxidermist

00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:52.280
 to immediately get to Dolly before it was too late

00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:54.120
 and they just managed to do it.

00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:56.520
 Now, this is gossip, you know, I haven't seen.

00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:57.160
 I've tried-

00:37:57.160 --> 00:37:58.440
 And pretty hot gossip at that.

00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:03.960
 We are going to be on the front pages of all the newspapers with this.

00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:06.360
 We've been trying to go a bit more viral recently, haven't we?

00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:08.040
 And this is the kind of stuff you're talking about.

00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:14.280
 Dan, if you're not going there and immediately opening another identical cafe over the road.

00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:15.800
 You're doing it wrong.

00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:19.320
 Brilliant.

00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:23.480
 Here was an interesting thing to do with the Titanic that I've never heard before,

00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:26.200
 which is that if you were first class on the Titanic,

00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:30.360
 that actually mattered after the boat had sunk and you had died.

00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:34.120
 So a boat was chartered to retrieve all of the bodies

00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:35.720
 and they found way more than they expected.

00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:37.080
 They found over 300.

00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:40.120
 Now, the idea was you were only allowed to bring them back

00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:43.160
 if they were embalmed because health and safety regulations.

00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:43.640
 Okay.

00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:46.280
 Unfortunately, they didn't expect to find that many people.

00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:48.920
 So they only had limited amounts of embalming fluid.

00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:49.480
 Oh, no.

00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:52.120
 So the first class passengers largely got priority

00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:54.360
 and the others had to be left back into the ocean.

00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:56.600
 It's something you don't think about when you're bucking tickets.

00:38:56.600 --> 00:39:01.080
 Because you see the prices and it's like first class, I can't do that.

00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:02.760
 Maybe premium economy.

00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:05.880
 Do I get any kind of twigs up my ass if I do that or what?

00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:13.400
 Wow, that's really, oh man.

00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:13.720
 Yeah.

00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:16.040
 But how did they tell that passengers were first class

00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:17.320
 based on them floating?

00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:18.040
 Responds.

00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:19.000
 It's the responds.

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.040
 Identified them.

00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:21.160
 They identified them.

00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:22.520
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:23.160
 Wow.

00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:23.960
 Wowie.

00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:24.360
 Madness.

00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:29.960
 Can I lift the mood a bit by talking about Pope Pius XII?

00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:30.840
 Oh, yes, please.

00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:32.200
 Right.

00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:35.000
 So the Vatican has its own embalmer.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:36.280
 Okay.

00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:37.560
 I imagine it's not a full-time gig.

00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:39.160
 But it's...

00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:40.120
 Do they embalm people?

00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:41.000
 They embalm the Pope.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:41.960
 Did you guys know that?

00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:43.160
 I assumed that they did.

00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:43.640
 Yeah.

00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:48.040
 I've been to the vaults in Vatican and I can't remember a few.

00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:49.480
 So they're not on display permanently.

00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:50.760
 They don't enjoy the permanent collection.

00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:51.320
 But I think there is a...

00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:52.760
 He's not quite mad of two sards.

00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:53.320
 It's not.

00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:54.760
 It's...

00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:55.160
 Oh, dear.

00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:56.760
 It's good technique though.

00:39:56.760 --> 00:39:57.960
 They're quite animatronic as well.

00:39:57.960 --> 00:40:01.240
 They can bless you as you walk by.

00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:04.680
 So I think it's for public mourning

00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:07.080
 so the Pope might be on display for a few days after their death.

00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:08.440
 And this doesn't happen.

00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:10.760
 I don't know if it still happened with the recent Pope

00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:11.640
 after he passed away, but...

00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:15.800
 So it used to happen that there would be a raised beer

00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:17.400
 and people would walk by and all of that stuff.

00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:20.280
 But in 1958, Pope Pius XII died.

00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:24.040
 And he had his own personal doctor in life

00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:26.280
 called Riccardo Galliazzillisi.

00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:28.520
 And he was not a good posthumous doctor.

00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:32.760
 So point one, he gave photos of the dead Pope to two magazines.

00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:34.760
 Not cool.

00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:35.480
 Yeah, what's this?

00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:37.240
 '58, 1958.

00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:41.000
 He tried to publish a diary of the Pope's last four days

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:42.440
 to kind of get some copy out of it.

00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:44.280
 He also announced,

00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:45.720
 "I'm going to be doing something a little bit different

00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:47.320
 with this Pope's embalming guys."

00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:50.360
 He said, "I'm not going to be removing his organs,"

00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:53.000
 which was the traditional way of embalming someone after death.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.880
 He said, "I'm going to embody his holiness

00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:58.440
 in the same way that Christ himself was preserved,

00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:01.560
 the traditional way using oils and resins."

00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:03.240
 Okay.

00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:06.440
 Now, unfortunately, this did not work.

00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:08.440
 They basically didn't drain any bodily fluids.

00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:09.640
 They didn't keep the body cold.

00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:11.160
 It was extremely hot at the time.

00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:13.800
 They were working in Castel Gandolfo, which is the Pope's...

00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:15.480
 Oh, Gandolfo, no, never mind.

00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:17.960
 That's his summer residence in Italy.

00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:19.000
 Summer residence, exactly.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:20.600
 So it's near the Vatican, but it's not...

00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:21.640
 It's incredibly hot.

00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:25.160
 And they just put the body in a bag with some herbs and spices.

00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:27.240
 And they said this was...

00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:28.520
 Was it 11 herbs and spices?

00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:29.000
 We don't know.

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:30.280
 But they...

00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:31.320
 And no raisins, I'm assuming.

00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:33.400
 They claimed this was aromatic osmosis.

00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:35.480
 It made things go really wrong.

00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:36.520
 So when the Pope was on display,

00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:39.640
 he turned either green or black, the sources vary.

00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:41.880
 But the Swiss guards who were standing guard

00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:43.640
 around the coffer, they started fainting.

00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:45.400
 And they had to change shift every 15 minutes.

00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:45.800
 Wow.

00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:48.760
 Like, it was an absolute disaster.

00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:51.000
 I mean, the doctor Gaby Atselisi was sacked.

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:54.120
 I mean, I would hope so.

00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:55.640
 It was an absolute disaster.

00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:55.960
 Yeah.

00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:56.840
 What was he thinking?

00:41:56.840 --> 00:41:57.480
 I don't know.

00:41:57.480 --> 00:41:59.720
 I mean, traditional method.

00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:00.120
 Yeah.

00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:02.440
 We talked about natural preservation earlier.

00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:05.160
 In Xinjiang, in China,

00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:07.800
 you get a few of these preserved people

00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:09.240
 because it's so dry there

00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:10.440
 and the sand is so salty.

00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:12.200
 It's like a desert in central China.

00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:16.600
 And there's one mummy there, the princess of Zhiyuahe.

00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:19.400
 And she still has her eyelashes, a hat,

00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:21.320
 and her natural hair streaming out.

00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:22.280
 Wow.

00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:24.040
 Because she's been so well preserved.

00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:24.680
 Wow.

00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:26.200
 So she's in the desert?

00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:28.520
 She's basically well in the cave in the desert, really.

00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:31.720
 But it's so dry that bacteria can't really live there.

00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:33.640
 And so they can't eat up her body.

00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:36.920
 She was buried with a cheese around her neck

00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:39.080
 and a wooden penis on her stomach.

00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:40.440
 That's all you need.

00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:41.640
 That's all you need in the afterlife.

00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:42.360
 That's a party at the afterlife.

00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:42.680
 Let's go.

00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:45.480
 Any wine?

00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:46.200
 No, no.

00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:49.480
 But I do have...

00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:50.920
 A wooden penis.

00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:52.200
 It's going to have a quiet night in tonight

00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:54.040
 with some cheese and a wooden penis.

00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:55.400
 And that'll be me.

00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:57.960
 The article that I read said that the cheese

00:42:57.960 --> 00:42:59.720
 was for sustenance in the afterlife,

00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:02.200
 but no one knows why she had the wooden penis on her stomach.

00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:02.920
 Oh, wow.

00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:03.480
 That is heavy.

00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:04.120
 Good Lord.

00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:05.720
 But you know, I think as an anthropologist,

00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:08.120
 this is what I find really, really fascinating

00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:10.920
 is the different reasons why so many cultures

00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:13.160
 around the world would mummify.

00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:14.680
 So the ancient Egyptians,

00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:16.200
 it's the idea that you need a body.

00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:16.840
 You need a body.

00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:19.720
 So therefore we've got to preserve the body.

00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:22.200
 You've got some Latin American cultures

00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:24.920
 where it's more the idea that they're still with you.

00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:26.760
 And so they get brought out in festivals

00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:28.360
 because they're still part of the community.

00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:30.040
 They're still active within the community.

00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:32.280
 The soul hasn't necessarily gone anywhere.

00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:34.600
 Other cultures, I'm thinking like, for example,

00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:36.840
 in Muslim culture, you don't preserve,

00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:39.400
 you don't, you bury, you don't even cremate

00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:43.080
 because the idea is that the body feels after death.

00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:46.040
 But then you've got Hindu culture

00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:49.000
 where you cremate so that the soul may be released.

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:50.760
 Sorry, I just find this absolutely fascinating.

00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:51.800
 And I think it's partly because we live

00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:53.640
 in a much more homogenous society today.

00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:56.200
 So it's like, oh, the body, where is imagine that,

00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:58.200
 like every community you would turn up to,

00:43:58.200 --> 00:44:00.520
 they would have a different interpretation

00:44:00.520 --> 00:44:03.480
 of what the body and soul are doing in the afterlife

00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:05.400
 and how important the body is

00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:07.880
 and that relationship between the body and soul is.

00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:10.200
 And what about like the obvious question

00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:13.480
 is things like Neanderthals and their hobbits and stuff,

00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:14.840
 what did they do with their dead?

00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:17.880
 The Neanderthals, did they, I think,

00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:20.520
 they buried them and put like gifts there and stuff

00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:21.320
 or is that really contentious?

00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:23.080
 So it is contentious.

00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:26.440
 I think some of them, I find it really hard to interpret

00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:29.640
 some of those caves where you find a Neanderthal.

00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:31.160
 I mean, I'm sorry, if you put in a Neanderthal

00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:34.200
 and there's lots of like palms and talons of other animals,

00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:37.240
 I'm sorry, guys, what is that other than grave offerings?

00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:39.720
 - Ritual, yeah. - It's really hard to interpret.

00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:41.800
 But it is, it's not like it's very common,

00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:43.560
 but the most famous example of it,

00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:46.520
 or the first really famous example was in Iraq,

00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:48.120
 in Shannadar cave.

00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:49.800
 And they thought what they were finding

00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:51.720
 was flowers being put on the grave

00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:53.480
 because they were finding pollen.

00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:55.080
 And it was like, it was, you know,

00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:56.680
 they were described as the flower people.

00:44:56.680 --> 00:44:57.640
 It was the first time people were like,

00:44:57.640 --> 00:44:58.520
 maybe Neanderthals are,

00:44:58.520 --> 00:44:59.880
 well, it's the first serious time people were like,

00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:01.880
 Neanderthals might have been emotional

00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:03.160
 and might have, you know,

00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:05.800
 had a sense of the afterlife and blah, blah, blah.

00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:09.640
 And then they were like, actually, it might just be rodents.

00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:11.880
 Rodents might have just come in

00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:14.440
 and basically brought pollen with them

00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:16.680
 and be ruining an archaeological site.

00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:20.680
 And it's like this beautiful kind of poetic story

00:45:20.680 --> 00:45:22.520
 that had been presented to the public.

00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:24.280
 And then another bunch of scientists were like,

00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:25.960
 actually, we think it's just rodents.

00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:28.440
 Is that a problem like in your industry

00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:31.160
 where you just get enticed by a good start?

00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:33.160
 Not you, but people just get enticed by it.

00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:33.880
 Absolutely.

00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:35.960
 So I actually worked on that in that cave.

00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:38.360
 And I have to say, you could see those animal burrows.

00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:39.400
 It was really, really clear.

00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:41.400
 But it's still not, I would say,

00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:43.720
 it's still not conclusive one side or the other.

00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:45.800
 What if it was trained microelephants

00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:48.440
 who were mourning in their own way

00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:49.640
 by bringing in the flowers?

00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:51.720
 Is that brilliant sci-fi brain working again?

00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:53.000
 Sorry to think outside the box here.

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.720
 Sorry, the French army are calling me again.

00:45:56.440 --> 00:45:57.560
 (laughing)

00:45:57.560 --> 00:45:59.960
 If you could only be buried with a--

00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:00.760
 What's in your life?

00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:04.600
 Which cheese are you choosing to be buried with?

00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:07.320
 Along with your, to go with your wooden penis.

00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:08.200
 For the afterlife.

00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:10.520
 Yeah, you can get one cheese and a wooden penis.

00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:11.800
 But what's the cheese?

00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:14.360
 For me, it has to be Lancashire, like where I'm from.

00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:15.160
 Lovely.

00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:19.320
 Nice crumbly Lancashire reminds me of my body crumbling away.

00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:20.360
 That's really nice.

00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:22.440
 And the archaeologist will be able to have some fun with that.

00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:24.360
 You know, they'll be like, he was probably from Lancashire.

00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:24.920
 Yeah.

00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:26.920
 I think probably a lot of Lancashires

00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:27.960
 might have been buried with cheese,

00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:29.560
 or it could have been my springing them.

00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:31.720
 My slice of cheese.

00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:35.000
 You Andy, obviously you wouldn't have asked this question

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:36.600
 if you didn't have your own hilarious answer.

00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:40.040
 Probably a reasonably soft cheese,

00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:41.720
 but nothing too adventurous, you know.

00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:43.640
 For the afterlife.

00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:45.320
 Which penis would you like to be buried with?

00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:48.760
 Take the XL.

00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:51.800
 I had the theory that she was actually holding a bottle of wine

00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:53.400
 and it was like Indiana Jones,

00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:55.960
 where someone was trying to take the wine

00:46:55.960 --> 00:46:57.480
 but thought they'd be booby trapped.

00:46:57.480 --> 00:46:59.000
 Have we got anything around here?

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:01.320
 We got that Gladys, give us.

00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:02.280
 Come on.

00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:02.680
 Yeah.

00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:02.840
 Yeah.

00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:05.000
 Okay, well, we've all got theories.

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:14.600
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,

00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:16.840
 and that is Andy.

00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:19.320
 My fact is, halfway through the summer,

00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:22.840
 wasps switch from liking ham to liking jam.

00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:26.360
 This is brilliant.

00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:27.720
 And when did they start liking lamb?

00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:30.040
 Oh, lamb.

00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:32.920
 It goes ham, it goes ham, jam, lamb, spam.

00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:37.480
 Well, basically wasps are just written by Dr. Seuss,

00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:38.040
 it turns out.

00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:42.120
 Like they're just, so this has been a terrific year for wasps,

00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:42.760
 we should say.

00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:43.240
 Is it?

00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:43.960
 We should say.

00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:48.680
 It's been warm and dry, good conditions for wasps,

00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:49.800
 and also great year for butterflies,

00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:50.760
 but we're not talking about them.

00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:54.040
 So wasps have a very different kind of food choice,

00:47:54.040 --> 00:47:55.320
 depending on what time of year it is.

00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:57.720
 So in the early part of the summer,

00:47:57.720 --> 00:48:00.360
 what they're trying to do is feed their larvae,

00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:03.240
 and wasp larvae are all carnivorous, right?

00:48:03.240 --> 00:48:05.000
 So wasps will be looking for ham.

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:07.720
 If you're at a picnic and you've got some meat out,

00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:09.960
 wasps will be going drawn to the smell of that,

00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:13.480
 and they'll take bits off it and back to their brood.

00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:15.640
 And then halfway through the summer,

00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:18.520
 the larvae pupate, they go into the pupa,

00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:19.800
 they don't need food anymore,

00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:20.440
 they're dealt with.

00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:22.040
 So the worker wasps think,

00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:23.480
 well, I'm going to turn to feeding myself.

00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:26.680
 And wasps, they have that tiny waste,

00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:28.760
 you know, they've got an incredibly divided body,

00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:30.520
 they can only really have a liquid diet,

00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:32.120
 and that's when they will go for jam,

00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:34.120
 or lemonade or whatever it is.

00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:36.440
 So you can tell what time of summer it is,

00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:40.200
 simply by putting out a sausage and some jam,

00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:41.240
 and seeing which the wasps go.

00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:42.280
 Do you have a date?

00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:44.440
 Because some people like this will go out

00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:45.720
 towards the end of the summer,

00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:47.160
 people will be going on picnics,

00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:50.520
 they need to know whether to bring the sausage rolls out there.

00:48:50.520 --> 00:48:53.240
 I think by the time this goes out,

00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:55.080
 what most wasps are going to be on the jam.

00:48:55.080 --> 00:48:56.440
 So you'll be safer with the ham.

00:48:56.440 --> 00:49:01.000
 But UCL, the scientists at UCL are doing a survey,

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:02.040
 there's an online survey,

00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:03.800
 if you Google wasp ham jam survey,

00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:04.840
 you'll probably find it.

00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:05.880
 What's the survey?

00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:07.640
 They're trying to find out,

00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:11.480
 like, have you been out recently at a picnic and noticed what?

00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:12.920
 So this is new science,

00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:15.000
 they're still asking for people to send in.

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:16.200
 Yeah, contributions are being welcomed.

00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:18.120
 This is a citizen science thing, basically.

00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:19.000
 And I tried to fill it in,

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:21.720
 because recently I was out with a piece of sponge cake,

00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:23.400
 and the wasps were absolutely bananas for it.

00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:25.080
 But unfortunately, I didn't bring my sausage,

00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:27.000
 so my contribution is useless to science.

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:30.840
 What I love about this is the idea that you wake up from a coma,

00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:32.440
 and instead of being like, "What's the date?"

00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:35.320
 You're like, "Are the wasps after the ham?"

00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:38.680
 But isn't that great to know that if that did happen,

00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:40.120
 you can work that out?

00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:41.480
 Yeah, that's really cool.

00:49:41.480 --> 00:49:43.320
 There was a bit of advice as well that I read,

00:49:43.320 --> 00:49:45.000
 that if you are out eating,

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.640
 let's say the four of us are out having a picnic,

00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:50.600
 and I'm making plates for us with whatever food,

00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:51.880
 I'll make the four plates for us,

00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:53.560
 you should always make a fifth plate,

00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:54.760
 in case there are wasps around.

00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:55.400
 An offering.

00:49:55.400 --> 00:49:56.520
 An offering plate.

00:49:56.520 --> 00:49:58.680
 Sorry, how do the wasps know to go for that one,

00:49:58.680 --> 00:49:59.560
 and not the four plates?

00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:02.120
 So there you go, make four to begin with,

00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:04.360
 and then if a wasp lands in it and starts eating yours,

00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:06.600
 basically a wasp will return to the same plate.

00:50:06.600 --> 00:50:08.680
 So you've just got to go, "Okay, that's your plate now,"

00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:09.640
 and you put it aside.

00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:12.600
 So they tend to return to where they started eating.

00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:14.440
 So then they won't bother you, put their plate over there,

00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:15.000
 and get on with them.

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:16.280
 I went camping this weekend,

00:50:16.280 --> 00:50:19.720
 and the wasps around me only went for my wine.

00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:21.960
 So I wonder what type of year that was.

00:50:21.960 --> 00:50:23.240
 That feels like sugar.

00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:25.480
 Unless you were having delicious meat wine,

00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:28.360
 it feels like that's a late summer thing for them.

00:50:28.360 --> 00:50:30.280
 What's interesting about that is,

00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:33.480
 there are also some people wasps go after them more.

00:50:33.480 --> 00:50:34.360
 Yes.

00:50:34.360 --> 00:50:37.080
 Then like, I'm one of, like, but wasps will tend to,

00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:40.520
 not always, but there are some people who clearly,

00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:43.080
 you know, there'll be four people having a picnic,

00:50:43.080 --> 00:50:45.000
 and they're going after one person.

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:48.280
 I wonder if some people have, like, a more meaty odor.

00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:50.600
 No, I wonder.

00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:51.640
 You're a jammy.

00:50:51.640 --> 00:50:52.040
 Yeah.

00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:53.880
 I dumped too much perfume on myself this morning,

00:50:53.880 --> 00:50:55.240
 and I was, like, in my head.

00:50:55.240 --> 00:50:57.960
 I'm just like, "Is that the kind of thing that, you know,

00:50:57.960 --> 00:50:59.960
 would be, like, that's what we're going for?"

00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:02.360
 Because they're not, they're certainly not trying to eat you.

00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:02.600
 No.

00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:05.000
 They don't eat live animals, basically.

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:06.600
 Are you wearing sausage from Chanel?

00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:12.040
 Yeah.

00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:16.200
 Yeah, but they, do they not go for live, like, insects and stuff?

00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:18.280
 Because I thought, like, the whole point of wasps

00:51:18.280 --> 00:51:22.200
 is they bury their eggs in animals, don't they?

00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:22.600
 This is the thing.

00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:25.000
 There are so many species that you can't be,

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:26.600
 you can't really be general about all wasps.

00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:28.920
 Like, some wasps, the classic wasps that we have,

00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:30.760
 the yellow jackets, no.

00:51:30.760 --> 00:51:33.320
 They go for carrion and a bunch of wasps

00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:35.400
 and strip a rat to the bone in a few hours.

00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:36.360
 They can really do it.

00:51:36.360 --> 00:51:36.760
 I know.

00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:39.560
 But yeah, you're right.

00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:41.400
 Loads of them go for live.

00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:43.640
 And basically, the difference between a bee and a wasp

00:51:43.640 --> 00:51:44.840
 is that a bee is veggie.

00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:47.160
 So, I just want to give a shout out to the scientists

00:51:47.160 --> 00:51:49.720
 behind this research from UCL, the Ham Jam Survey,

00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:51.240
 because she's called Sirian Sumner,

00:51:51.240 --> 00:51:52.360
 Professor Sirian Sumner.

00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:55.560
 She's written a book called Endless Forms,

00:51:55.560 --> 00:51:56.600
 which is all about wasps.

00:51:56.600 --> 00:51:58.680
 And the first, I'd say, two chapters are predominantly

00:51:58.680 --> 00:52:02.520
 slagging off bees and saying, "Everyone loves bees, don't they?

00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:04.040
 Oh, they're so cute."

00:52:04.040 --> 00:52:06.840
 And people, basically, people search how to save the bees

00:52:06.840 --> 00:52:08.280
 and how to destroy the wasps.

00:52:08.280 --> 00:52:10.840
 Like, people, like, and she's just sticking up for the wasps.

00:52:10.840 --> 00:52:13.000
 She says bees are just wasps that have forgotten

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:15.160
 how to hunt devastating.

00:52:15.160 --> 00:52:15.560
 Oh, my God, that's amazing.

00:52:15.560 --> 00:52:16.840
 Bees are veggie.

00:52:16.840 --> 00:52:17.800
 Bees are fluffy.

00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:18.760
 They do honey.

00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:21.960
 And actually, wasps are incredibly useful

00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:23.080
 in all sorts of ways.

00:52:23.080 --> 00:52:25.160
 They deal with tons and tons of pests

00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:26.440
 in your garden every year.

00:52:26.440 --> 00:52:28.680
 Yeah, we'd be overrun with pests if it wasn't for wasps.

00:52:28.680 --> 00:52:30.040
 But they are pests themselves, so...

00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:33.480
 Well, you know, we're getting into it.

00:52:33.480 --> 00:52:34.680
 Take it up with Professor Sumner.

00:52:34.680 --> 00:52:35.960
 But that's really interesting.

00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:37.560
 Our book is unbelievably good,

00:52:37.560 --> 00:52:40.200
 all about the sheer variety of wasps

00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:41.720
 that she think that hornets.

00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:43.000
 I think she's pro.

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:45.560
 She's pro anything wasp bees.

00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:46.760
 I don't think that's not a bee.

00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:47.320
 Yeah.

00:52:47.320 --> 00:52:50.600
 The thing with the wasp wasp thing is really interesting.

00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:52.440
 So, basically, you're saying that they end up

00:52:52.440 --> 00:52:54.280
 with a liquid diet because they've got these tiny wasps.

00:52:54.280 --> 00:52:54.920
 Yeah.

00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:56.680
 So, when I first looked into the difference

00:52:56.680 --> 00:53:01.160
 between wasps and bees, I did think that's a little bit

00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:02.680
 like Neanderthals and Homo sapiens.

00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:05.240
 Because we have wasps.

00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:06.600
 Neanderthals don't have wasps.

00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:08.600
 Neanderthals' ribcage just keeps going out.

00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:09.640
 So, it's like us after Christmas.

00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:10.680
 Like, it just keeps going.

00:53:10.680 --> 00:53:11.240
 Wow.

00:53:11.240 --> 00:53:12.280
 We have wasps.

00:53:12.280 --> 00:53:12.920
 Yeah.

00:53:12.920 --> 00:53:14.760
 And then we're not particularly hairy.

00:53:14.760 --> 00:53:16.200
 Now, we don't really know what Neanderthals are,

00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:18.200
 but I guess Hollywood would tell you that they're hairy.

00:53:18.200 --> 00:53:21.720
 But yeah, I was just laughing that we are the wasps

00:53:21.720 --> 00:53:23.400
 of the equation.

00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:23.560
 Yes.

00:53:23.560 --> 00:53:26.280
 So, our wasps are the ribcage stops and then the...

00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:26.440
 No.

00:53:26.440 --> 00:53:29.800
 So, if you look at a ribcage on Homo sapiens,

00:53:29.800 --> 00:53:31.880
 the bottom ribs go in.

00:53:31.880 --> 00:53:34.440
 Like, think of an image of a skeleton.

00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:36.680
 The ribs go in at the end at the bottom.

00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:38.760
 Whereas on Neanderthals, they just keep going out.

00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:39.960
 So, they technically...

00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:41.640
 Yeah. So, they don't have wasps.

00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:42.120
 Interesting.

00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:44.200
 So, does that make them less flexible?

00:53:44.200 --> 00:53:46.280
 I mean, it makes them stockier.

00:53:46.280 --> 00:53:46.600
 Okay.

00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:47.400
 It makes them stockier.

00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:47.960
 So, like...

00:53:47.960 --> 00:53:49.720
 There'd be a good prop forward.

00:53:49.720 --> 00:53:50.040
 Right.

00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:52.280
 And Homo sapiens would be a good...

00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:52.680
 Winger.

00:53:52.680 --> 00:53:55.960
 What's interesting is actually the first TV show I ever...

00:53:55.960 --> 00:53:59.160
 Listener, he did not understand.

00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:03.560
 I think I know enough about football to understand.

00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:12.120
 What's brilliant about that is the first TV show I ever did was...

00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:14.200
 It's called Neanderthals Meet Your Ancestors,

00:54:14.200 --> 00:54:16.680
 but it's actual original title for the first godness,

00:54:16.680 --> 00:54:19.080
 how many years was Neanderthal Fight Club?

00:54:19.080 --> 00:54:21.880
 And it's because the whole premise was who would win

00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:24.120
 in a fight between the Neanderthals and the Homo sapiens,

00:54:24.120 --> 00:54:26.040
 because the Neanderthals are so stocky.

00:54:26.040 --> 00:54:28.760
 So, they were describing as like Joe Frazier and Muhammad Ali,

00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:31.480
 which, by the way, that went like people were talking about it

00:54:31.480 --> 00:54:32.360
 in pitches all the time.

00:54:32.360 --> 00:54:35.240
 And I was like, I should probably Google who the hell is Neanderthal.

00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:38.680
 There's no idea what boxing is about.

00:54:38.680 --> 00:54:42.840
 But yeah, that stockiness, that does change how you stand,

00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:44.760
 how you hold yourself.

00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:46.360
 And who would win in a fight?

00:54:46.360 --> 00:54:52.200
 We decided that it would be equal, because the Neanderthals would be...

00:54:52.200 --> 00:55:02.600
 The Neanderthals would be kind of just like heavy set, blah blah blah, but then the agility of the Homo sapiens would be like light on their feet, like Muhammad Ali.

00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:04.600
 We have tested this in a global sense.

00:55:04.600 --> 00:55:06.360
 The results are in.

00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:12.200
 But just the waist thing, the benefit of that wasp's narrow waist,

00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:14.920
 which bees don't have, stupid bees,

00:55:14.920 --> 00:55:21.400
 is that it makes wasps very agile in terms of moving the lower half around.

00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:23.880
 So originally wasps didn't have stings.

00:55:23.880 --> 00:55:27.800
 They had ovipositors, egg-laying tubes.

00:55:27.800 --> 00:55:30.840
 And those have to be flexible, they have to be able to move and shift,

00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:35.800
 because you might be laying an egg on a live host organism, that kind of thing.

00:55:35.800 --> 00:55:38.920
 So the wasps back end can move around.

00:55:38.920 --> 00:55:43.400
 Their stings are very flexible and pointable, and that's a big advantage for them.

00:55:43.400 --> 00:55:47.640
 And that's why only female wasps sting you, right?

00:55:47.640 --> 00:55:50.920
 Because the sting is a egg-laying organ.

00:55:50.920 --> 00:55:51.480
 Really?

00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:58.920
 But new research, they found males that can sting with their genitals, or kind of.

00:55:58.920 --> 00:56:00.920
 So these are potter wasps.

00:56:00.920 --> 00:56:02.040
 Potter?

00:56:02.040 --> 00:56:03.720
 Potter, yeah, like Harry.

00:56:03.720 --> 00:56:07.720
 And they've evolved sharp spines on their genitals.

00:56:07.720 --> 00:56:13.960
 And when they're swallowed by a frog, they'll use their genitals to kind of stab the mouth of the frog,

00:56:13.960 --> 00:56:15.240
 so that it lets them go.

00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:20.600
 This is the first evidence that we have of the defensive role of male genitalia

00:56:20.600 --> 00:56:22.200
 in the whole animal kingdom.

00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:22.680
 Wow!

00:56:22.680 --> 00:56:28.360
 So they're the only animals that we know of that are using their penises as a defense mechanism.

00:56:28.360 --> 00:56:30.200
 Wow, wow.

00:56:30.200 --> 00:56:31.160
 And that's huge.

00:56:31.160 --> 00:56:32.920
 Apparently, I don't know if it's huge.

00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:39.320
 Apparently, this has been anecdote from people out in the fields,

00:56:39.320 --> 00:56:40.760
 talking about that they could do this.

00:56:40.760 --> 00:56:44.280
 And one person who had been saying it for years was Schmidt.

00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:45.240
 Justin Schmidt.

00:56:45.240 --> 00:56:46.280
 Schmidt pain index.

00:56:46.280 --> 00:56:48.280
 I believe so, unless it's a different Schmidt, but he wrote...

00:56:48.280 --> 00:56:49.640
 How did Justin Schmidt...

00:56:49.640 --> 00:56:51.720
 Ella doesn't know who Justin Schmidt is, I don't think.

00:56:51.720 --> 00:56:52.520
 Who is Schmidt?

00:56:52.520 --> 00:56:55.080
 And possibly one or two of our listeners might not know.

00:56:55.080 --> 00:56:57.720
 Yeah, we were actually like, he's an old friend, sorry.

00:56:57.720 --> 00:57:03.640
 Justin Schmidt was a guy who decided to find out where on the body was the most painful to be stung

00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:04.760
 and by what?

00:57:04.760 --> 00:57:06.440
 Insects and animals and so on.

00:57:06.440 --> 00:57:09.160
 And so he had the Schmidt index.

00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:13.560
 He was the one who found out how bad the tarantula hawk sting is,

00:57:13.560 --> 00:57:15.480
 which is the worst kind of wasp sting.

00:57:16.040 --> 00:57:20.280
 It was actually someone who he worked with who got stung by the tarantula hawk

00:57:20.280 --> 00:57:25.240
 and he said that the pain was so great, he crawled into a ditch and bawled his eyes out.

00:57:25.240 --> 00:57:25.560
 Wow.

00:57:25.560 --> 00:57:30.600
 He wrote really poetic descriptions, didn't he?

00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:32.520
 His papers are just outstanding.

00:57:32.520 --> 00:57:35.160
 Bullet and someone is pouring lava into your ear.

00:57:35.160 --> 00:57:38.280
 You know, all of these amazing descriptions of what it's like being stung by these things.

00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:40.600
 The most dangerous wasp, in my opinion.

00:57:40.600 --> 00:57:41.080
 Come on.

00:57:41.080 --> 00:57:46.840
 The mud dauber, so the mud dauber is sometimes called the pipe organ dauber

00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:53.160
 and they make nests out of clay and they're like, they're shaped a bit like pipe organs,

00:57:53.160 --> 00:57:56.040
 so they're kind of cylindrical, long cylindrical things.

00:57:56.040 --> 00:58:00.200
 But they have a bit of a habit of making them inside aeroplanes

00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:06.200
 and the nests have caused the crashing of at least three planes causing the death of 200 people.

00:58:06.200 --> 00:58:07.160
 Oh my god.

00:58:07.160 --> 00:58:08.120
 By these wasps.

00:58:08.120 --> 00:58:08.600
 Really?

00:58:08.600 --> 00:58:08.920
 Yeah.

00:58:08.920 --> 00:58:10.600
 Oh my god.

00:58:10.600 --> 00:58:11.000
 Wow.

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:13.880
 You've got to check your plane for wasp nests.

00:58:13.880 --> 00:58:14.600
 Yeah.

00:58:14.600 --> 00:58:16.200
 Yeah, I'm not, I'm not blaming the wasps.

00:58:16.200 --> 00:58:19.160
 They didn't know what they were doing, I have to say, but you know.

00:58:19.160 --> 00:58:22.200
 Interesting, because like the captain will have the door closed, right?

00:58:22.200 --> 00:58:23.960
 So are they coming through cracks?

00:58:23.960 --> 00:58:24.840
 What are they coming through?

00:58:24.840 --> 00:58:27.640
 Because that's the only person you need to affect to make the plane crash.

00:58:27.640 --> 00:58:28.200
 No, no, sorry.

00:58:28.200 --> 00:58:31.480
 They're building nests in the engines which cause the engines to fail.

00:58:31.480 --> 00:58:33.160
 Oh, they're not stinging them to death.

00:58:33.160 --> 00:58:34.120
 They're not stinging them to death.

00:58:34.120 --> 00:58:34.840
 What's going on?

00:58:34.840 --> 00:58:37.240
 Oh, there was like snakes on a plane.

00:58:37.240 --> 00:58:39.240
 That's what wasps in the cabin.

00:58:39.240 --> 00:58:39.640
 Wow.

00:58:39.880 --> 00:58:41.080
 Sorry.

00:58:41.080 --> 00:58:42.840
 You just check out the passenger in 3B.

00:58:42.840 --> 00:58:44.680
 I think he's a million wasps.

00:58:44.680 --> 00:58:45.320
 I'm not sure.

00:58:45.320 --> 00:58:47.560
 I thought he was 3Bs.

00:58:47.560 --> 00:58:54.280
 Ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately we're out of fish and chicken.

00:58:54.280 --> 00:58:56.760
 Today's meal will be sausage or jam.

00:58:56.760 --> 00:58:59.080
 No.

00:58:59.080 --> 00:59:07.160
 Okay, that's it.

00:59:07.160 --> 00:59:08.200
 That is all of our facts.

00:59:08.200 --> 00:59:09.560
