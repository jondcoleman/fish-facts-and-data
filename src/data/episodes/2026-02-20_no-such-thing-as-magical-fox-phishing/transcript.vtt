00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640
 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Things A Fish, where we were

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:10.860
 joined by our good friend, the New Zealand comedian Ray O'Leary. Now we've known Ray

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.280
 for a long time now. He is such a good friend. It's so good to get him on the main

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.840
 podcast. You might remember he did the Edinburgh Showcase that we did as was

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.240
 the end of last year, but he is on the full show today and I'm absolutely

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.920
 certain you're gonna love it because oh my gosh we have such a good time doing

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.760
 this show. Once you have finished listening to it then I reckon you're gonna

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.240
 want to go and buy tickets to see his show. His stand-up is really where he

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.320
 absolutely thrives. He's got a brilliant delivery and his jokes are so funny.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.000
 Of all the people I went to see last year, definitely he's my favourite. And so

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.240
 if you are listening to this, when the show goes out and you are in Edinburgh,

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.440
 Newcastle Glasgow, Norwich, Southampton, Edinburgh,

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.680
 Leeds Liverpool Birmingham, London, Bristol or Sheffield, then go to the internet

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.160
 and search for Ray O'Leary. If you go to his Instagram then you will find details

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.560
 for tickets in his bio. Oh you could just search Google for Ray O'Leary tickets and

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.640
 you'll find them there and I highly recommend it. If you'd like to listen to the

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.760
 Excel version of this show where we find out what Dan has in common with

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.920
 Jean-Jacques Russo and believe me you didn't want it in the normal version but

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.200
 big fans of Dan are going to want to hear it and go to patreon.com/nosythingsaffish

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.360
 and there is all sorts of stuff there, not just Excel shows but merch and

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.240
 all sorts of bonus material or just a place to sign up and learn more about fish.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.520
 Anyway, let's get on with it. This week's show with Ray O'Leary on with the podcast.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:59.280
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:05.200
 from the QI offices in Hobern. My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.240
 James Harkin and Ray O'Leary and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:16.880
 four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go. Starting with

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:25.680
 fact number one and that is Ray. My fact this week is that a 30-second lullaby written in 1963 has made

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:32.080
 more than $70 million in royalties. That lullaby is killing in the name of my rage.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:40.720
 Some that l always go to bed and that lullaby.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:47.600
 Okay, that's a lot of royalties. The reason it's made so much money is because it's become

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:53.280
 a theme song for a TV show. It's become a theme song for the American quiz show Gipady

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:59.040
 because the song was written by the creator of the show who I guess needed a theme song.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:05.600
 It got himself to do it and now paid himself $70 million. He got paid every time it was on.

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:11.680
 Yes, every time it was on and the show is like 230 episodes a year or something and he gets paid

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.960
 every time. syndicated globally as well and there's all the different UK and other countries.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:22.800
 Stephen Fry hosts the UK and Australian ones. The thing is about this lullaby is as far as I'm

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.680
 concerned it's exactly the same as another lullaby which is I'm a little teapot.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:34.720
 Oh really? So one that goes tip me over, pull me out.

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.520
 To me, I've always heard it and I honestly always thought they must have just used

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.400
 I'm a little teapot because it was out of copyright. But actually he claimed to have written it.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.800
 Well, I would say that I'm a little teapot is not a lullaby. I certainly wouldn't think

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.960
 that to a child I was trying to get to sleep. I think that's more of a high-pup fight song

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:58.480
 that kind of thing. What does it? It was the eight-mile of its day.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.720
 But actually, I mean, there were movements involved when you want a child to sleep.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.360
 You don't want them doing movement. Yeah. But that was written by a couple of school teachers.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:12.640
 Really? I think it was in like the 30s or 40s. So in theory, it would have been in copyright

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.800
 when he and this guy who was called, what was he called? Merv Griffin.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:20.960
 Merv Griffin. When Merv Griffin wrote his in theory they could have sued him but I think

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:24.880
 because they were just school teachers, they weren't like, you know. I didn't know that.

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:30.400
 Was it Merv Griffin? He not only created Jeopardy, he created Willa Fortune. He was also the host

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.120
 of a lot of TV shows. He was in movies. He was a sort of business empire onto himself.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:42.480
 And he was like the rich at Usman of America. Yeah, he was. But I do have a bone to pick with old Merv.

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:48.400
 Oh, yeah. Of course. Yeah, he says creator of Jeopardy. He absolutely was not. It was his wife.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:54.000
 Oh, yeah. His wife, Julian Wright. She was sitting on an airplane and this is in interviews with

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.320
 Merv Griffin where he says, and this will explain the format of Jeopardy in case anyone's not really

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:03.360
 seeing it. His wife was mulling over a game show ideas and said there's not enough successful question

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:08.400
 and answer shows. Those used to be big. They weren't really on TV. And then she said, what happens

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:14.000
 if you swap the answer in question in the format? So what if you were given the answer and you had

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.680
 to come up with the question. So the question is, how does it work, right? You're a fan, right? Yeah,

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.800
 yeah. So what you get given is I think it's called sometimes the clue, but it's meant to be in the

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:31.600
 phrase of an answer. So it'll be this city is the biggest in the UK and home to 9 million people

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:39.680
 or something like that. And then you would say, what is Western Superman? I do not know enough about

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:49.040
 British geography. What is London? The examples she gave on the plane was she said 5,280. The question

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:55.040
 was, how many feet are in a mile? She also said 79 Whistful Vista. The answer was, is that where

00:05:55.040 --> 00:06:00.880
 Fibre and Molly McGee live? And that was just friends of theirs. Oh, that's a tricky one. There doesn't

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:05.920
 talk about that. I think the thing is though with Jeopardy is like those kind of things wouldn't

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:10.960
 quite work. Because if you say the number of feet in a mile, there's a number of different questions

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:17.200
 that could be in that answer. Whereas if it's a clue rather than an answer. So it has to be, you can't

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:22.400
 say these are weird sea things. And I say, what are oysters? Because there are loads of weird

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:26.160
 things. It could be a colour hug. Exactly. Okay. Okay. Because I've always found it incredibly

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:30.800
 confusing. I've never seen an episode. I've always found the idea quite baffling. And also if you don't

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:36.880
 say what is or who is or whatever, you don't get the point. Give me a break. Give me a break.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:40.160
 It's got to be real. What is the slogan for Kit Kat?

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:49.280
 Close enough. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Do they have this show in New Zealand?

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:54.720
 No, I illegally watch it on YouTube every day. Don't tell anyone. My profession is, but yeah,

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:59.200
 I find it fascinating. And also you'll write about what move Griffin said about how he came up with

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:04.080
 the show. Well, I was just sitting there, my wife had a nightmare. The shame of being single,

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:12.800
 I'm half as efficient, you know. Well, he was like a big deal. And he was an actor. And I think he

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:18.960
 was friends with Doris Day, who might have discovered him. I think he was working in a nightclub

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:23.680
 and Doris Day walked past and said, why do you should do a screen test for Warner Brothers for who

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:30.080
 I'm working. And he did that and he got put in a couple of movies. And I think he probably thought he

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:36.160
 was going to be Doris Day's leading man because they were such good friends, but he was very short.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:41.040
 He could have been like her love interest who eventually loses the girl, but he was never going

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:46.240
 to be a leading man really. So he thought he was going into either the hot met, but he was assigned

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:56.000
 with like a hunchback number two. He was a poor bearer at Ronald Reagan's funeral. Maybe through

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.840
 acting connections, I don't know, or maybe after he became a very big deal. No, you're right.

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:07.680
 Unless they all were. Yeah, I don't know. And he's the man behind the soul. I've got a lovely bunch

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:13.280
 of coconut. He was the original singer of the one who made it the big song that it became.

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:17.920
 Yeah, that's crazy. Yeah, so not behind it. Sorry, the one of the the singers who made it big.

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:22.320
 And the other thing about him, just last thing on him personally that I found fascinating was

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:28.720
 he also created, as you said, I think James wheel of fortune to another incredibly big game show.

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:34.160
 And of course, we know that the theme tune for that show was written by Alan Thickey,

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:38.960
 father of Robin Thickey. I've read the podcast. I've read the podcast. I've got that. Yes.

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:46.000
 Do you know Robin Thickey? I know Robin Thickey. Oh, yes, it's no common miscurses.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:52.320
 On this podcast, he will always be Robin Thickey. He gets furious people mispronounce his name.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:58.000
 Robin, because it makes him sound thick if you call him Robin Thickey. He's very clever, man.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:05.120
 He also had a chat show, very famously, Murf. He interviewed an estimated 25,000 people.

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:10.960
 And he said that his best interview was with Austin Wells, because Austin Wells was very guided

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:16.480
 individual. He didn't really say anything about his personal life. But just before the show,

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:20.960
 Austin Wells said, you know, these wonderful gossipy things that you've always wanted to ask about

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:26.960
 my past. And Murf says, yeah, yeah, but I'm not allowed to ask those. Am I? And Austin Wells says,

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:31.760
 well, tonight you are, I'm feeling very expansive. And he did the interview and he asked him all these

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:36.880
 questions that he wouldn't answer in the past. And Austin Wells went home and died two hours later.

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:43.840
 So his like, this is my last chance to get it out. Wow. Holy moly. But he did, yeah, he died of natural

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:55.360
 causes as a person. Murf and Murf. We mentioned Wheeler Fortune earlier. There is a person

00:09:55.360 --> 00:10:01.680
 on that show called Vanna White, who has a Guinness World Record. Okay. Can you guess what it is?

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:09.760
 Vanna White. What was Vanna White? Vanna White was a, she was quite a glamorous lady, glamorous

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:16.080
 assistant. Oh, it was something like most air was on TV. Okay. So she is the person who turns the

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:22.320
 answers around because Wheeler Fortune is like Hangman, right? So you've got a word there and you say,

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:26.480
 can I have an X? Yes, you can. And they'll turn the X. Oh, but there might not be that letter there.

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:30.400
 It is not in the phrase you understand. I can tell you. So it's this person's job, but she now has a

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:41.200
 World Record. And she's done something 3,721,446 times as of the night of February 2015.

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:46.320
 Was it touching letters? Well, records, touching letters.

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:49.680
 Because, hey, Santa's got that record. Have you done that?

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:59.840
 Has she collapsed? Correct. Yeah. So whenever they get one of the letters, right,

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:04.400
 she turns it round as she claps. That's always counted the claps. Wow, with some of those

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:15.200
 and she appeared in all but 10 of the 6151 episodes up until Guinness made this record.

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:20.720
 And she clapped in all of them and she had a World Record. And the reason that they had a hostess

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:25.840
 on their atoll is because they did, they were going to motorise the board, which is what you would do.

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:31.360
 It's like, can I have an L? And the L just turns round. But they couldn't finish making the motor.

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:34.000
 And so they had to hire someone to actually turn the pictures.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.360
 Just on computers doing this kind of stuff. So,

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:42.560
 Japanese famously faced Watson in 2011. Super computer.

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:48.240
 Yeah. Yeah. And Watson won beat two humans who were playing alongside it.

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:51.520
 It's a three-player game. And one of them was like the best.

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:57.680
 They were both the top champions. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter, who I think both

00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:02.640
 hold records in the Jupiter universe. Really? I didn't know there was a Japanese universe.

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:12.800
 The JCU. Never checked it out. There's a website called J Archive. And it's a fan-made website.

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:18.000
 And it's a record of every question ever asked. How much dollar values were waged and whatnot? Who won?

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.960
 Pitches of the people who played. Every like word that was said on an episode, all categorized there.

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:26.880
 And Alex Trebek, one of the longtime hosts of the show, found out about it.

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:29.680
 And he said, "Come on people, get a life."

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:34.160
 What is the pay signal on the P2?

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:45.760
 Okay, it is time for fact number two. And that is my fact.

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:52.000
 My fact this week is that every year in Japan, thousands of receptionists apply to compete against

00:12:52.000 --> 00:13:02.320
 each other in the all-Japan phone answering championship. This is amazing. This is a competition

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:10.000
 exclusively for office workers, mostly receptionists. And every year, literally thousands and thousands

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:16.640
 apply so that they could go to a competition where they sit on stage and they are judged on how well

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:22.080
 they receive a phone call and deal with questions. And it lasts three minutes long for each of them.

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:27.360
 And then they hang up. And then a decision is made on how great they performed. And they're given

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:33.840
 things like a problem. It's called each year. A new problem is created. And they are given

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:39.200
 the same problem for all competitors. Yeah, it is. But you would not be able to you must be kept away

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:43.600
 from otherwise you see what the problem is. I think they tell you before you go on because there's

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:53.040
 like, so the 2025 one was for a theoretical beef tongue restaurant in Sendai City, which has the

00:13:53.040 --> 00:14:00.160
 slogan, "Bringing smiles to customers faces through beef tongue." And basically, you get all the

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:04.800
 menus and all the different places it could deliver beef tugs to. And then someone will reg up, go,

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:10.000
 excuse me, do you have any pork tugs? Do you have to like answer that? I'm a vegetarian. What do you

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:15.040
 have for me? And you're told what's going to be asked as well? You're told the problem. So there's

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:20.880
 no, there's no plot twists or anything like that. You're even given a role in their 2025 one. You are

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:26.640
 Yun Katakura. You are an employee responsible for operating the online shop and handling inquiries

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:34.480
 about beef tongue. But you have to do it with a straight face. I think it's like a lot of it's like

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:40.400
 how polite you are. It's how clear you are. It sounds like there's a lot of quite formal etiquette

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:45.680
 as well. And in terms of how you answer the phone, you're meant to answer on the first or the second

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:50.160
 ring. If you only get to it on the third ring, that's an apology straight away. If you pick it up

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:55.520
 straight away and you're too keen on the beef tongue. I think it's very precise. If you're in a

00:14:55.520 --> 00:15:01.600
 phone answering competition, you're waiting for the third ring. That's crazy. That's the bad boy.

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:11.440
 I think you're talking general Japanese etiquettes. Apparently it's judged out of 100 points.

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:16.480
 I got this from a translation of a site that talks about the 2025 competition. So yeah,

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:21.520
 it's judged on six different criteria. First impression. So you're the first line that you say.

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:26.480
 Hello. Did you deal with that? Criterion number two, basic call handling skills, which is 20 points,

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:32.320
 voice volume, speaking speed, natural intonation, clear voice production and pronunciation. That's

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:38.000
 what that one is. Oh, well, it's important. Yeah. Then there's communication skills. There's provision

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:45.440
 of information and service. Final impression. Bye. Let's just let's just try it. Let's just try

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:53.680
 with you. Yes. Ringling. Hello. Sorry. That was a bit quick. It's keen. And also in Japan, they don't say

00:15:53.680 --> 00:16:01.840
 hello. We need you to do the full voice. In Japan, you answer the phone, mochi-mochi. Of course.

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:12.880
 And do you know why that is? It's because they speak Japanese. Well, that is undoubtedly true,

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:20.480
 but it doesn't mean hello. It means it's short for a moushi again, muscle, which means I am going to

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:26.000
 talk. And it's because in polite Japanese society, especially if you're speaking to someone who is

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.800
 more important than you, you wouldn't say hello. You had to announce the fact that you want to talk

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:37.040
 before you do, which is tough because then you are talking. So usually we say mochi-mochi before you say

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:42.640
 mochi-mochi. Can I ask you a question? It's the can I ask you a question in Japanese?

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:47.840
 I'm asking a question. No, no, exactly. But there's another theory, according to a folklorist

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:56.000
 called Uekasal. Apparently, mochi-mochi is impossible to say if you are a magic fox.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:06.880
 The life of the magic fox just gets harder and harder. There's a thing called the backimono fox,

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:13.040
 and this fox is like a trickster in folklore. And one thing that it does is it can learn to speak like

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:19.600
 and imitate a human, but it can say lots of the words, but it can't say mochi-mochi. And so according

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:24.080
 to this folklorist, one of the reasons people say mochi-mochi is because then if they say that,

00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:30.480
 they know that you're not a magic fox. Shibulath, right? Shibulath. Yeah, exactly. And as a result,

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:37.520
 magic fox crime stats are down way down. Especially when it comes to like fishing, like trying

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:43.120
 to get your bank details on the phone. They just don't do it. A lot of younger Japanese people,

00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:46.400
 and I think this is a global thing as well, I'm becoming more nervous about answering the phone.

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:53.520
 This is a thing. There's a study in the UK that found that a quarter of people aged 18 to 34

00:17:53.520 --> 00:18:00.240
 never answer the phone. I would never answer the phone. Really? I don't. I do. I like it.

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:06.800
 I spend the wheel. Who's this? Yeah, but it's always some spam, isn't it?

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:13.440
 It's often someone with a really good offer for me actually. And that's why Andy's living in the

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:23.120
 basement of this building. Another magic fox got me. But there's this other thing that is

00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:26.960
 happening now, especially when younger people aren't answering the phone, they'll answer it,

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:31.040
 but they won't say anything because they're waiting for it. I did that as well. Do you?

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:36.960
 Because you can kind of hear the click. And also what happens often is they won't say anything.

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:43.120
 And then as soon as you talk, then the automatic voice comes in and it says, hello, I've got a great

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:56.800
 deal for you. 50,000 kilos of beef tock. Yes. Yes. Yes. Have you guys experienced this other thing?

00:18:56.800 --> 00:19:02.720
 And this has only been recently launched. Yelp, the sort of phone people, the company launched

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:06.880
 this thing recently. You can have a proper conversation with an AI voice that answers your phone.

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:16.960
 So I'm in the process of I'm getting my hob removed. And sorry. I'm trying to have my hob ripped out

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:23.440
 at the moment. I can't believe you should have to work today. That's why you're on a limping up the

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:29.840
 system. And I phoned up this company trying to get a quote. And I had a whole conversation with a

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:36.080
 robot that was doing a quote for me, like saying what's the size of it and what shape it is. But as

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:42.000
 in I had a proper yeah, I found it very upsetting and horrible. Sometimes I that's how I feel when we're

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:51.760
 doing this podcast. You know that you're not talking to a proper intelligence. But yeah,

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:57.200
 could you tell it was an AI? I could have good intonations, good production of speech, good whatever

00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:01.200
 that. Well, it did. But weirdly, I could tell. Oh, yeah. I said, it sounded like a person, but there

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:05.600
 was just a slight sort of filter over the whole call that maybe realized it was a machine talking.

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:11.200
 It's really weird because the final criteria, the sixth criteria of this whole thing is actually

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:16.720
 sort of an overall evaluation. So it sort of almost doesn't matter what happened between one

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:20.400
 and five. They could have given you high marks. But then they're like, now that I think about it,

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:25.840
 I wasn't so much impressed with these certain moments. And you can get points for it even if you

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:29.760
 didn't get anything resolved in the call, but it sounded like a nice chat. You get points for that.

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:36.400
 You can also get points for excellent silence. Just for like, wow, you were brilliant with the

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:48.640
 silence there. Yeah. Points for everyone. I looked it up and I think it was the 2015 winner.

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:55.440
 Was a was a was a she practiced to win this competition. She practiced for three minute conversations

00:20:55.440 --> 00:21:02.320
 for two hours a day over a period of four months. Wow. That's a very patient partner.

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:09.040
 That's amazing. Well, it's it is thousands who apply, but it's only about 60 to 80 that make it to

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:14.640
 the actual stage. I guess is there an audience? Is there a big audience apart from the judges?

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:18.960
 I've seen a video, but I've only seen it off the stage. I couldn't quite tell because it's the

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:23.920
 show is 60 to 80 people doing the same three minute conversation. I can imagine that wouldn't be very

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:29.040
 varied, basically. Yeah. I did read that one of the recent winners answered the phone and conducted

00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:34.000
 the conversation in a very traditional and formal style, which is what got to the points with the

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.560
 judges, although you wouldn't maybe naturally have a conversation like that. If you were answering

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:43.040
 the phone and in a normal Japanese business, basically, they're all sorts of, apparently there are

00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:49.360
 at least 60 books in Japan available exclusively on phone etiquette. It's a real thing. Yeah. Yeah.

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:53.360
 Obviously, it's a country with a huge amount of etiquette in all sorts of areas, but yeah,

00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:59.520
 it's fascinating. General reception. I was trying to find out some more things about general

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:04.880
 receptionists and receptionism. Okay. Got it. Okay. Most successful receptionist of all time.

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:15.200
 Okay. Good question. Is it the receptionist from the apprentice TV show in the UK who literally,

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:19.680
 well, they they have this whole pretence of them being in the ballroom and you're fired and stuff,

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:24.240
 and then they go out and then supposedly Alan Sugar decides what's going to happen. And then

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:28.720
 they cut to someone who doesn't even seem to be in the same building, picking up a phone and going,

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:33.120
 yes, Lord Sugar, I'll send them in now and then put it and then they cut to the ballroom and they're

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:40.960
 all ed. So that just feels like like a good job. Yeah. That's really good. No, the queen.

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:47.280
 Choose a receptionist. Oh, the current queen consort. Oh, come on, come on, come on, stop that.

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:51.840
 This is started out as a receptionist. I mean, it's a natural career progression, isn't it?

00:22:51.840 --> 00:23:01.920
 I'll be promoted. You're made queen. Did she? Yeah. Obviously, a very posh company in their

00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:06.800
 reception and I think she was sacked for turning up late. But I found out, interesting fact, Charles

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:14.480
 and Camilla had the same gynecologist when they were born. Charles had a gynecologist. I

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:20.640
 suppose Charles and Camilla's mothers were both assisted by the same. Charles has no gynecologist.

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:33.040
 He had his hub removed it. Oh my gosh. Here is an accidental receptionist. In

00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:40.240
 Reykjavik in 2015, there was a security guard in the Prime Minister's office who went away from

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:44.720
 the office for the day, but normally what you do is you put your mobile phone number into the

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:49.520
 system and then if anyone phones the Prime Minister, then it would come through to you and you can

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:55.680
 sort of take messages and whatever. Anyway, someone put the wrong number in and a woman who lived in

00:23:55.680 --> 00:24:04.400
 Reykjavik to start getting phone calls for the Prime Minister of Iceland. That's such a prank.

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:11.280
 If you can arrange that for someone, that is amazing. What happened? What did you do? Nothing. It was

00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:15.760
 just for like one day or so until they all came back in the office and she said it's been no bother.

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:23.200
 This is Inge Björg Sigurvins.ir. It's been no bother. I am a citizen of this country and I am ready

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:29.680
 to help. But it should be like pageant. Pouching through calls from world leaders and things.

00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:36.000
 I really like this, which is ELO Electric Light Orchestra. It's one of my favorite bands. So

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.160
 their debut album came out in 1971. It's called Electric Light Orchestra, out here in the UK.

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:47.040
 Released in America in March of 1972 with the title No Answer. And that's because the record

00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:51.760
 exec in America said to someone in the office, "Can you call England and find out what the debut

00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:57.280
 album is called?" They called. No one picked up. They wrote in the notes, no answer. The execs

00:24:57.280 --> 00:25:03.440
 all had. And thought, "Great title." And that became the title of the album. It was just self-titled.

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:15.200
 ELO. Is that because someone rang up the office and they went, "Ello"?

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:18.880
 Okay, it is time for fact number three. And that is James.

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:24.720
 Okay, my fact this week is that philosopher Jean Jacques Rousseau, one of the most important figures

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:32.240
 of the Enlightenment, father of European political thought, and one of the inspirations behind

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:37.440
 the French Revolution, would run around Paris with his bum out hoping someone would spank him.

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:45.600
 Did that start the French Revolution? We have to stop this guy. Off with his bum.

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:54.400
 So yeah, Jean Jacques Rousseau, unbelievably famous in his time, one of the most important

00:25:54.400 --> 00:26:00.640
 thinkers of the age. And it turned out that he had a pretty difficult childhood and it stuck him

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:06.240
 with some fetishes. And one of them was that he loved being spanked. And just before he died,

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:12.160
 he had a book called Confessions, which was very autobiographical, but it was like it was

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:18.560
 what's an all. And he said that he would go around Paris, winning the Mahous style, hoping that

00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:22.640
 someone would spank him. And then what happened was sometimes he got the ship beat out of him.

00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:28.000
 Did he? Yeah, like a group of people who didn't think much of that kind of thing would grab

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.240
 hold of him and start kicking him, and he'd have to escape? I think that's fair. Yeah.

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:39.120
 He was hanging around in alleys, hoping for, I presume, what would be quite a rare result

00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:43.040
 with someone to administer a spanking. I mean, it sort of... I'd be in a publisher right here and now.

00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:49.680
 It feels like a behaviour that would be looked down upon these days. Yeah, you probably couldn't

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:56.720
 even do that anymore, because of Woke. It does feel like famous philosopher pervert, which is a

00:26:56.720 --> 00:27:05.200
 smaller headline, but it's striking that he confessed it. Yeah. His confessions were really sort of like,

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:11.200
 I'm going to admit everything now. Yeah. But his confessions, he wrote what is largely

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:17.280
 seen as the first autobiography. It's often said to be the first autobiography, and he would go

00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:21.920
 around to parties and he would read extracts of his confessions. So he titled it Confessions,

00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:28.400
 I believe. Confessions of a smack addict. I think that was the... Yeah. It's so funny that he

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:33.840
 was moaning people in alleyway. Do you think they looked down in alleyways? Inside that alleyway,

00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:46.560
 is there a smaller, narrower alleyway? Oh, my God. But yes, he did publish the first,

00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:50.800
 what is considered the first autobiography, the Confessions, and he discussed some of his least

00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:57.200
 glamorous moments, which included that he abandoned five of his children, and that he once stole a

00:27:57.200 --> 00:28:04.240
 ribbon. So those two were sort of on equal to... Yeah. But the ribbon that he did, I think, accuse

00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:10.000
 he said that it made in another serve and had stolen and given it to him, and that's how he came across

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:15.760
 it. He was... He's an interesting cookie, isn't he? He's kind of... Because a lot of... Right, just for

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:20.640
 context, this is what Dan says about some of the worst people you've ever heard of. He was a character.

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:28.000
 He was a character. Because he... Check the ripper, a little strong cookie. He's Marmite. He's Marmite.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:40.640
 So he was from Geneva, and his father was also from Geneva, but he had this sort of idea that he

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:46.880
 was from some incredible Patricia family, very important he felt he was. He was a watchmaker,

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:53.840
 but he married above his station, and he thought he was so up a class that he always brandished a

00:28:53.840 --> 00:29:00.800
 sword wherever he went. That was not allowed in Geneva at the time. Okay. So he got kicked out of Geneva,

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:06.480
 and the whole family got kicked out. Oh gosh. And eventually Rousseau was sent to live with a

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:13.200
 Calvinist minister and his daughter, and it was the daughter, Mamoiselle Lambertier, who used to

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:18.080
 treat him like he was her child, and she would spank him when he'd done something naughty. And then in

00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:24.000
 the end, he would just do things naughty deliberately so that he got spanked. Yeah. And that's how he ended

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:30.800
 up with this. It's so... Because his most famous quote is, "Man is born free, but everywhere he is in

00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:36.400
 chains." And I assume that chains would be to be bad, but now maybe he was quite a good way,

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:41.840
 but everywhere he is in chains and hopefully a whirlpool. Man has been a very, very naughty boy.

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:49.680
 He also believed that there was this idea of the natural man, and that civilization was actually a

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:54.400
 complete con job that made everyone miserable. I mean it was a very... We would all be really happy if

00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:58.480
 we were just left to live our own lives, and we wouldn't have to go to work every day and go on the

00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:04.560
 tube. Yeah. But basically he just thought anything that was an invention of modern society was bad.

00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:08.960
 And that's why he thought... And so it's really weird that he was a great writer about childhood

00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:14.000
 considering that he abandoned all of his children to an orphanage, but he kind of overturned a

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:19.280
 previous very prevailing view that children are naturally evil and naturally fallen, you know,

00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:24.160
 born with original sin. He was saying no children are naturally wonderful and should just be left

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:31.920
 alone, which is not a recipe for good adults. So, you read a lot about philosophers, because he had

00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:36.400
 a particular interest of yours. Yes, a little bit, a little bit. We didn't get him as much,

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:40.080
 and so this was interesting reading up on him. Did you rate him as a philosopher?

00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:46.720
 Yeah, no, yes, definitely. The influence he's had is crazy, and his development on the social

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:51.840
 contract theory and his ideas about democracy. I mean it almost seems quite now looking back at a guy

00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:57.200
 who's writing him, "I think democracy would be a good idea." But at the time it was like divine

00:30:57.200 --> 00:31:03.440
 writer kings, this idea that the government didn't have to be responsible to its people. So he was

00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:08.960
 groundbreaking, I think, for the time, for sure. But I didn't realise just how crazy his life was.

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:14.480
 I learned that his mother, Suzanne, she had to go to a church hearing, I think they had sort of

00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:20.560
 a religious, I don't know, police or system in Geneva at the time. And she had to go to a church

00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:27.440
 hearing for going to the street theatre disguised as a peasant woman, so she could gaze upon

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:35.280
 invents and caress in whom she fancied despite him being married. It apparently theater was illegal

00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:41.200
 at the time. So the Geneva non-Calvinists shared to account for herself. He didn't know that.

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:47.360
 He didn't like theatre either, Jean-Jacques. So Volta introduced a theatre to Geneva,

00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:51.360
 at which point Rousseau wrote to him, "You have ruined Geneva. I hate you."

00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:54.960
 He once pissed in his neighbour's kettle.

00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:56.320
 Did he?

00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:58.960
 Yeah, that's in his confessions. I don't know if he wrote that out.

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:05.760
 My turn, his neighbour picks up the box, goes to the index in the back, looks like it would have been mentioned.

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:06.560
 That's nice.

00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:08.320
 Flocking his cup of tea.

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:21.600
 He didn't like gender equality. He was very much of the idea that men are in charge and women are not.

00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:28.000
 And there was another philosopher called Olymp de Gouge, who was a French activist and playwright.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:33.360
 And she really liked Rousseau's philosophy in general, but she really critiqued his idea that women

00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:39.920
 shouldn't have as much role in society. And she said, "If a woman has a right to mount the scaffold,

00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:43.440
 she must equally have the right to mount the speaker's platform."

00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:47.040
 And then two years later, she was executed.

00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:49.280
 So, for inter-revolution?

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:51.040
 In the reign of Tera.

00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:57.120
 Oh, yeah, for just for political writings, which was a little bit frowned upon at the time.

00:32:57.120 --> 00:33:01.360
 Mary Wollstonecraft as well, all sort of vindication of the rights of a woman.

00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:07.280
 She and Mary Shelley's mum, and she and he had big beef, because again, all part of his,

00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:12.080
 I think his theory that the natural is perfect. He then wrote, "Oh, well, actually, you know,

00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:17.520
 it's women's nature to give care, and that's therefore all they should be taught to do."

00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:22.480
 It was a very aggressive theory, even at the time, and Wollstonecraft argued back pretty stiffly.

00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:26.800
 But Rousseau inspired the journey that produced Frankenstein.

00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:27.200
 Really?

00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:31.600
 Yeah, so you know, Mary Shelley and Byron and Percy Shelley went to Lake Geneva.

00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:34.960
 They went to Lake Geneva in 1816.

00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:38.960
 They were following in the footsteps of one of his novels, which was called "Juley",

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:42.000
 and it sat at the east end of Lake Geneva, and they were going on a bit of,

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:46.000
 I don't know what the term is, where you said, "Well, you said really well. Yeah, come on."

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.880
 They were following that, and so that's why they ended up there.

00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:49.680
 Oh, cool.

00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:51.520
 I didn't know that. That's fantastic.

00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:57.600
 Rousseau's dad back to being a watchmaker. He said, "Just a random burn from his father,

00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:02.880
 Mr. Rousseau said, "A Geneva watchmaker is a man who can be introduced anywhere.

00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:06.240
 A perisian watchmaker is only fit to talk about watches."

00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:10.720
 So this has a hard-core burn amongst the watchmaking community,

00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:13.200
 1700s, Geneva.

00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:19.120
 I've never, I wouldn't associate France with watchmaking, probably for that reason, right?

00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:21.680
 Swiss watchmaking, of course.

00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:22.320
 Yes.

00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:26.080
 A French cuckoo clockmaker is only fit to talk about cuckoo clocks.

00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:28.320
 Swiss cuckoo clockmaker.

00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:30.560
 French tubular omega.

00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:34.000
 (Laughter)

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:44.560
 Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show, and that is Andy.

00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:48.720
 My fact is, "Rays Flirt" by Belly Flopping.

00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:50.080
 I told you they're in confidence.

00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:53.200
 (Laughter)

00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:54.240
 Like a mantra, right?

00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:55.200
 Like a mantra, right?

00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:58.880
 They're all sorts of, I think they're 11 different species of

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:04.880
 modular ray, which are the great big diamond-shaped rays that you get

00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:08.240
 with a mouth at one end and a tail at the other and two enormous lovely wings in between.

00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:15.360
 And some of the species, specifically monk's devil ray, but I think a few of them do it,

00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:19.040
 they do these incredible ballet displays out of the water.

00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:23.360
 They gather in big groups and then they just launch themselves out and they go about two meters

00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:26.560
 into the air. And these are huge animals as well, like they're big.

00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:30.800
 And they land with this great big splash and they do it for hours at a time.

00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:36.480
 And while I say flirt, scientists are reasonably confident it's communication.

00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:41.520
 And it might be a way of luring more rays to your ray mating event.

00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:43.440
 Okay, I'm sorry, Ray.

00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:44.320
 Is that what you call it, Ray?

00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:45.840
 (Laughter)

00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:48.720
 It's often quite a solo, I don't know if these guys are.

00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:49.600
 What do they have in the night?

00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:52.400
 (Laughter)

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:54.000
 There are hundreds of them in there.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:54.800
 I'm sorry.

00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:59.680
 (Laughter)

00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:03.360
 So it might be flirting, basically, it might be hunting, but it seems to be communicating.

00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:04.320
 They're not sure.

00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:07.600
 The mating habits of rays come on.

00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:08.560
 Come on.

00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:09.920
 Have you heard of the man-to-train?

00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:12.160
 No.

00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:14.240
 This is man-to-rays.

00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:16.160
 There's a real replacement man-to-bus.

00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:17.120
 I'm afraid today.

00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:20.960
 (Laughter)

00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:26.240
 This is a way of courting that happens amongst man-to-rays where a female will swim up front

00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:30.880
 and she'll be followed by a train of male man-to-swimming behind her.

00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:31.840
 Like a conger?

00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:33.280
 Yeah, exactly like a conger.

00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:35.440
 And it's called it the conger reel.

00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:36.640
 That would have been a clever...

00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:38.480
 Yes, it would have been confusing.

00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:40.240
 It would have been very confusing, yeah.

00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:42.880
 And the idea is that they just follow.

00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:45.760
 And it can last a very long time, sometimes several weeks,

00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:48.720
 where they're just following and then they'll sleep and then follow and so on.

00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:52.320
 On what this weekend, I saw a conger of caterpillars.

00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:52.880
 Did you?

00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:55.680
 There must have been 30 if there was two.

00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:56.640
 And there was two.

00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:58.000
 That was fantastic.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.760
 It was in the carpark in Spain.

00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:03.360
 And they were just walking like...

00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:05.360
 As to nose, as to nose, as to nose.

00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:06.720
 And they were all just wandering along.

00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:09.920
 And I googled it and apparently they're looking for mating grounds

00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:11.440
 or food or something.

00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:14.240
 But they always go in this sort of conger line.

00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:15.120
 Were they heading...

00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:16.560
 Were they near the edge of the carpark?

00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:17.920
 No, they all know.

00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:18.560
 Oh, yeah.

00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:19.200
 Oh, stuff.

00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:22.400
 I just love the thought of you, Ron Holliday, in Spain.

00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:24.960
 And everyone's going, "Oh, he's James, he's eyes on the carpark."

00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:26.000
 Like, it's a cat.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.200
 It's a cat.

00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:28.960
 Just behind the caterpillars.

00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:33.680
 Oh, dear.

00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:34.640
 I'm going to watch Colo.

00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:35.440
 That is cool.

00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:36.640
 See this line on the road?

00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:37.120
 Yeah.

00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:40.160
 What it is, and the closer you get, the more you realise that it sees carpilling.

00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:40.640
 Yeah.

00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:43.040
 Well, this, I mean, this sounds like a pretty amazing thing to witness.

00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:44.240
 And scientists do watch it.

00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:45.840
 The story I read, yeah.

00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:52.320
 The man to raise, where 20 rays were following the main lady who's called Big Bertha.

00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:55.920
 They named, they, I think, the name all the rays.

00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:57.760
 Because there's Miles Ray.

00:37:57.760 --> 00:38:00.960
 They said she was being closely followed by Miles Ray.

00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:03.440
 We thought that he was the one for her later on.

00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:06.800
 When we checked out the footage, we found out Lightning Ray had pursued her on his own.

00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:10.080
 I've got thinking of a few new nicknames for myself.

00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:13.360
 Have you guys could start calling me Lightning Ray?

00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:16.720
 Yeah, so yeah, that's what they do.

00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:20.560
 And they just, they've battled it out, or whoever lasts till the end.

00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:22.880
 I'd also recommend to anyone listening to this.

00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:26.720
 It is not a smart fluting strategy to follow a woman for weeks at a time.

00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:28.960
 The group of your friends.

00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:36.240
 There was, in 2024, there was a Ray who managed to successfully mate on their own.

00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:40.640
 And there was a female stingray living with a load of male sharks.

00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:43.120
 And she became pregnant.

00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:48.400
 And what a lot of people thought is maybe she'd been impregnated by the sharks.

00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:50.880
 Because she had like bite marks on the side of her.

00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:54.640
 And that's quite often sharks will bite when they're mating to kind of get a grip.

00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:59.760
 But I think generally speaking, what we think has happened now is that she

00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:02.480
 got pregnant through pathogenesis.

00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:08.560
 So females have, they have their egg cells, but they also have another thing in

00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:10.000
 their body called polar bodies.

00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:12.240
 And these contain genes as well.

00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:15.680
 And if there are no males around, then the polar bodies can get into the eggs

00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:17.520
 and they can then turn into...

00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:18.480
 Oh, wow.

00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:19.440
 The virgin birth.

00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:20.480
 It's virgin birth.

00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:22.240
 It's even crazier in a way.

00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:25.040
 There are some rays, but it sounds like it's not this one.

00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:29.120
 Because otherwise, it might have been mentioned that can sort of hold and incubate

00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:30.880
 the sperm that they collect.

00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:33.200
 And that can be held for quite some time.

00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:34.720
 Critic female choice.

00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:36.000
 Yeah, exactly.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:37.600
 Yeah, that's what I would have thought it was.

00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:38.480
 But clearly...

00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:39.440
 Yeah, well, I don't know.

00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:44.960
 Like, the scientists are still not certain, but they think it's this kind of polar body thing.

00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:47.120
 Raised in general, I said there are...

00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:49.840
 What did I say? I said 11 species of mobular ray.

00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:52.400
 And they're known as the mobulids, which is a great name.

00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:54.480
 So three of those species are manta rays.

00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:56.800
 And the other rate are devil rays, right?

00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:58.480
 Sorry, right.

00:39:58.480 --> 00:39:59.280
 I had no shame.

00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:00.480
 Good, no shame.

00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:04.000
 But they've been recategorised a lot lately.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.400
 And I think the last time we talked about them was about eight years ago.

00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:10.320
 They had just been all shaken up and redistributed and rearranged.

00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:11.120
 Oh, yeah.

00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:12.720
 Scientifically, it's a new...

00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:13.760
 Because there's a new effect.

00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:15.120
 There's no such thing as a ray.

00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:16.480
 Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:21.920
 And so the newest manta ray was discovered in 2025 last year.

00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:23.280
 We're still just going to...

00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:25.040
 These things are massive as well.

00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:27.920
 And it was by a scientist called Andrea Marshall.

00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:33.440
 The Atlantic manta ray is the third species of manta ray that we now know about.

00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:39.120
 And back in 2009, she had observed it and thought it was a bit fishy.

00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:45.200
 Anyway, and it's taken until now to prove it, right?

00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:50.080
 And to sort of demonstrate it and sort of do the analysis to show that it's a separate species.

00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:54.000
 The amazing thing was, in 2009, she and her colleagues had also first described

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:55.680
 the second species of manta ray.

00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:57.440
 I just think it's amazing.

00:40:57.440 --> 00:41:01.040
 And the reason it's so hard to scientifically describe them

00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:03.520
 is that what do you need to describe in these species?

00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:06.800
 You need to know that it's not the same as an old species.

00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:09.680
 Yep, but what's the way of proving it is what I mean?

00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:11.280
 Oh, genetic testing.

00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:13.120
 Yes, but what do you need to do genetic testing?

00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:15.200
 Some genetic material.

00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:15.920
 You need a body.

00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:18.320
 Right.

00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:21.120
 And these things, they're really hard to study.

00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:22.640
 A, because when they die, they sink.

00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:24.720
 Dimer.

00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:28.240
 And secondly, they're made of cartilage, not bone, which decomposes faster.

00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:28.960
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:31.280
 So it's bloody hard to get hold of a sample.

00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:35.280
 They're still quite mysterious. They're still quite strange alien things.

00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:37.840
 And it just takes a very long time to find one that's washed up.

00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:38.080
 Right.

00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:40.000
 And get it to a scientist in time, that kind of thing.

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:40.480
 So yeah.

00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:45.600
 Can I quickly point out, you did do a fact, no such thing as a ray

00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:47.920
 on the show ages ago.

00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:51.440
 And I think that applies right here, right now.

00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:53.120
 Aren't I right?

00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:54.480
 Matthew.

00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:58.320
 I've been called to that.

00:41:58.320 --> 00:41:59.040
 Oh no.

00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:00.080
 You're not a real ray.

00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:01.040
 No, that is true.

00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:01.920
 That is a ray.

00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:03.200
 That's ray charlatan.

00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:06.240
 That's true.

00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:06.960
 It's a, it's a neck.

00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:07.600
 It's a neck day.

00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:09.440
 You know, he's called Ray.

00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:10.240
 It's real nice Matthews.

00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:12.560
 He's called Ray because he sounds like Ray Romano.

00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:14.000
 That's what one of his friends thought at school.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.440
 From everybody loves Raymond.

00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:17.520
 And they'd all just started calling me Ray.

00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:19.040
 And that's how it's called on.

00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:20.960
 And I'm no one's genetically tested me here.

00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:25.360
 No one's noticed that I'm not a genetically different species to Ray Romano.

00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:30.800
 You know that Ray Romano really hated the name of that show?

00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:32.640
 Everybody loves Raymond.

00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:38.000
 And he hated it so much that he kept saying to the producers we need to change this title.

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:42.720
 And they made a deal with him apparently that if they made it into a top 10 show,

00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:43.760
 they will change the name.

00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:47.760
 And then they did it for a few years, became more and more successful.

00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:49.600
 Eventually, they cracked the top 10.

00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:52.320
 He went into the producers and said, right, we've got a deal.

00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:53.680
 It's time to change the name.

00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:54.800
 And they said, well, we can't change it.

00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:55.840
 Now it's a top 10 show.

00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:59.520
 Oh man, that's so funny.

00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:00.160
 That's great.

00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:01.280
 Everyone loves Raymond.

00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:02.400
 Ray hated that name.

00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:04.640
 Here's another one.

00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:05.680
 Ray Parker, Jr.

00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:06.560
 You heard of him?

00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:07.360
 Ghostbusters.

00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:08.720
 Right, the song Ghostbusters.

00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:09.200
 Yes.

00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:11.200
 Turns out, revealed in an interview recently,

00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:12.640
 he is afraid of ghosts.

00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:18.480
 You're busting myth off today, today.

00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:19.440
 I trusted him.

00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:23.440
 And he used to be a solo artist called Radio.

00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:24.480
 That's a cool nickname.

00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:26.720
 That is a cool name, yeah.

00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:29.040
 They can be huge, Ray's.

00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:32.400
 They can be 17 feet long.

00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:34.160
 A giant devil ray.

00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:36.160
 I mean, that's really, really big.

00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:37.440
 Is that, and because

00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:40.080
 is there wingspan bigger than their length?

00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:41.600
 They're usually about the same, I think.

00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:42.880
 They're legs wet.

00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:45.040
 They're like, yeah, they're diamonds.

00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:45.760
 Yeah, yes.

00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:50.320
 But a mentorate 10 feet long needs to eat about,

00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:54.320
 well, I suppose, any mentorate needs to eat about 12% of its body weight

00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:55.360
 every week, right?

00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:56.400
 Every week.

00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:57.120
 That's not much.

00:43:57.120 --> 00:43:58.960
 I don't fully know, like, what do we have to eat?

00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:01.920
 Well, let's say you weigh 100 kilos, it'll be less than that,

00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:04.800
 but so that'd be 12 kilos worth of food a week,

00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:07.360
 which is less than two kilos per day.

00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:10.000
 Two kilos feels like a lot.

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.640
 I'm thinking of my chocolate cereal in the morning.

00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:13.920
 I'm thinking of my...

00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:17.840
 If you buy a steak, it would be like 250 grams, right?

00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:18.400
 Yeah, that's good.

00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:19.200
 So that is a fair bit.

00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:23.200
 So you would have to eat eight steaks every day.

00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:23.680
 Okay.

00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:24.640
 Okay, so that is a fair bit.

00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:27.680
 I'm thinking of 10 kg of potatoes, plus a little bit more.

00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:29.120
 Right.

00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:31.760
 We all have our ways to visualize it.

00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:35.840
 Well, that was on men2brayadvocates.com.

00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:36.240
 Oh, yeah.

00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:37.360
 It was just a cracking website.

00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:38.880
 You may have found it in the course of your research.

00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:40.320
 I'm on the devil rise education.

00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:44.960
 No, no, no, no, no, no.

00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:45.440
 I love it.

00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:46.240
 Thank you.

00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:47.920
 But they can only eat plankton.

00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:49.520
 They can't eat 250 grams steak.

00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:50.640
 They zoo plankton.

00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:52.560
 You know, tiny, tiny things in the water.

00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:55.520
 And men2brayadvocates.com calculated

00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:57.760
 that a 10-foot ray would need to eat

00:44:57.760 --> 00:44:59.520
 how many pieces of plankton a week?

00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:01.840
 This is a guessing game.

00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:02.000
 Yeah.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:03.680
 10 million.

00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:03.840
 10 million.

00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:04.640
 T-pot, short.

00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:05.120
 Oh, great.

00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:06.080
 Okay. 10 million.

00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:08.560
 What, 1.2 feet of plankton?

00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:12.640
 I mean, okay, because you've done it in a different seat.

00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:13.920
 You know, and that's fine.

00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:15.920
 Oh, I see.

00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:16.400
 Yeah.

00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:17.040
 Very clever.

00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:17.920
 Very clever.

00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:21.920
 So you can just explain that for the rest of the journey.

00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:23.680
 [LAUGHTER]

00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:25.280
 Damn, pass.

00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:26.000
 Okay.

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:26.640
 [LAUGHTER]

00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:28.800
 James is closest because he answered in the unit

00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:30.720
 that I was expecting people to answer in.

00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:32.320
 [LAUGHTER]

00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:33.120
 You say 10 million.

00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:33.680
 10 million.

00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:36.400
 19.2 million.

00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:37.680
 19 million, 200,000.

00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:39.440
 That's a lot of magnitude.

00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:41.280
 Yeah, I could be right, depending on him.

00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:45.040
 We do need to check the math on rays first,

00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:46.400
 before we award those to change.

00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:47.200
 It's a plankton.

00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:49.440
 But they have to keep swimming forward as they eat,

00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:50.880
 because they're a thing called

00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:52.800
 obligate ram ventilators.

00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:55.680
 They can't go through them, and they take the air out of it.

00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:56.640
 Exactly, yeah.

00:45:56.640 --> 00:45:57.200
 They have to keep--

00:45:57.200 --> 00:45:58.080
 So you've got to just--

00:45:58.080 --> 00:45:59.680
 Some ancient sharks will do this.

00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:01.680
 You just have to keep moving forwards otherwise you die.

00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:02.240
 Yeah.

00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:02.960
 It's quite cool.

00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:03.920
 I think that's quite a good--

00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:04.720
 It's quite a--

00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:06.000
 It's good metaphor for life.

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:06.480
 Yeah.

00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:07.680
 If you stand still.

00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:09.920
 The reason I thought dolphins is they sleep

00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:12.400
 half-brain at a time, so that they can still swim.

00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:14.720
 I don't think that's to do with the breathing, though.

00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:16.960
 I think that might be more to hide from predators.

00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:17.360
 Yeah.

00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:18.960
 Because dolphins have to surface, obviously.

00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:20.640
 But so how do you raise sleep?

00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:22.240
 Don't know.

00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:23.040
 Right?

00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:25.680
 [LAUGHTER]

00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:28.560
 Can't comfortably, but after going through every social faux

00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:29.440
 power I may think to you.

00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:32.720
 [LAUGHTER]

00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:34.640
 One quick thing on belly-flopping.

00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:36.880
 Oh, yeah.

00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:40.000
 Have you ever heard the idea that if you belly-flop

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:43.680
 from a very high position, and then land on water,

00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:45.440
 it's just as bad as landing on concrete?

00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:46.280
 I haven't heard it yet.

00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:46.760
 Yeah, yeah.

00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:48.320
 Do you think it's true?

00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:50.320
 Oh, well, thank you.

00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:51.960
 I can-- yes.

00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:55.200
 I keep seeing videos now of people diving

00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:57.840
 from very high heights in a belly-flop position,

00:46:57.840 --> 00:47:00.400
 and landing in the kind of--

00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:01.520
 So you think no?

00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:02.160
 I think no.

00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:05.760
 And I know this room, I suppose you'd say that.

00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:07.800
 If you throw something before you land,

00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:09.360
 it breaks the tension of the water.

00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:11.360
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's true.

00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:14.760
 My feeling as the answer is no, but it still hurts a lot.

00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:15.960
 I think that's fair.

00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:17.560
 I think that's probably right.

00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:19.280
 Mythbusters, our friends at Mythbusters,

00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:23.600
 they did some tests and threw two big pig carcasses

00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:25.560
 out of a helicopter.

00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:28.160
 And they x-rayed it, and they found that the pavement drop

00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:31.200
 resulted in 17 fractures, a shattered pelvis,

00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:35.040
 and a decapitation, while the water drop yielded seven

00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:37.240
 fractures and a broken neck.

00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:38.080
 Oh, yes.

00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:40.120
 So neither of them's good for you, but definitely

00:47:40.120 --> 00:48:00.480
 hitting the pavement is more of an impact.

00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:04.520
 One last thing from me, January 15th, 1990,

00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:07.800
 Lottie Stevens was out on a boat in New Caledonia

00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:09.840
 when his boat capsized.

00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:14.240
 And according to the story, as reported by Radio Vanuatu,

00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:19.720
 he was drifting for four days before a giant stingray came

00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:22.400
 and gave him a ride back to land.

00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:23.400
 Yeah.

00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:24.400
 What's going on?

00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:26.760
 They're living some avatars, right there.

00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:29.080
 Ray, you're not the face of Vanuatu at the moment.

00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:30.400
 Yeah, I have the face of Vanuatu.

00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:31.400
 What do you mean?

00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:33.760
 Because I found this guy floating at sea.

00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:38.880
 [LAUGHTER]

00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:40.800
 Are you really connected to Vanuatu?

00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:44.600
 Yeah, I did have tourism campaign for Vanuatu last year.

00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:47.160
 You could meet Lottie Stevens, because I'd love to know more.

00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:53.240
 The stingray carried him for 450 miles back to shore.

00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:58.600
 It took 13 days of being carried on the back of the stingray

00:48:58.600 --> 00:48:59.920
 before they got home.

00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:01.280
 This is so wonderful.

00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:04.640
 We didn't emphasize that part of the tourism campaign.

00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:06.960
 You're swimming out as far as you like, don't you?

00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:09.040
 [LAUGHTER]

00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:11.000
 There's stuff out there that'll bring you back.

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:12.520
 She'll bring me back.

00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:14.080

00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:19.200

00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:20.640

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:50.840
 I'll probably be there.

00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:52.800
 And that's in February of--

00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:54.160
 Yeah, February march this year, yes.

00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:54.840
 In the UK.

00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:56.440
 Yes, and then Australia the rest of the year.
