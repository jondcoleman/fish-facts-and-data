00:00:00,00:00:04,"Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Things A Fish, where we were"
00:00:04,00:00:10,"joined by our good friend, the New Zealand comedian Ray O'Leary. Now we've known Ray"
00:00:10,00:00:15,for a long time now. He is such a good friend. It's so good to get him on the main
00:00:15,00:00:19,podcast. You might remember he did the Edinburgh Showcase that we did as was
00:00:19,00:00:24,"the end of last year, but he is on the full show today and I'm absolutely"
00:00:24,00:00:27,certain you're gonna love it because oh my gosh we have such a good time doing
00:00:27,00:00:31,this show. Once you have finished listening to it then I reckon you're gonna
00:00:31,00:00:36,want to go and buy tickets to see his show. His stand-up is really where he
00:00:36,00:00:40,absolutely thrives. He's got a brilliant delivery and his jokes are so funny.
00:00:40,00:00:44,"Of all the people I went to see last year, definitely he's my favourite. And so"
00:00:44,00:00:48,"if you are listening to this, when the show goes out and you are in Edinburgh,"
00:00:48,00:00:51,"Newcastle Glasgow, Norwich, Southampton, Edinburgh,"
00:00:51,00:00:57,"Leeds Liverpool Birmingham, London, Bristol or Sheffield, then go to the internet"
00:00:57,00:01:02,and search for Ray O'Leary. If you go to his Instagram then you will find details
00:01:02,00:01:06,for tickets in his bio. Oh you could just search Google for Ray O'Leary tickets and
00:01:06,00:01:10,you'll find them there and I highly recommend it. If you'd like to listen to the
00:01:10,00:01:15,Excel version of this show where we find out what Dan has in common with
00:01:15,00:01:19,Jean-Jacques Russo and believe me you didn't want it in the normal version but
00:01:19,00:01:25,big fans of Dan are going to want to hear it and go to patreon.com/nosythingsaffish
00:01:25,00:01:29,"and there is all sorts of stuff there, not just Excel shows but merch and"
00:01:29,00:01:34,all sorts of bonus material or just a place to sign up and learn more about fish.
00:01:34,00:01:39,"Anyway, let's get on with it. This week's show with Ray O'Leary on with the podcast."
00:01:39,00:01:59,"Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast coming to you"
00:01:59,00:02:05,"from the QI offices in Hobern. My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,"
00:02:05,00:02:10,James Harkin and Ray O'Leary and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our
00:02:10,00:02:16,four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go. Starting with
00:02:16,00:02:25,fact number one and that is Ray. My fact this week is that a 30-second lullaby written in 1963 has made
00:02:25,00:02:32,more than $70 million in royalties. That lullaby is killing in the name of my rage.
00:02:32,00:02:40,Some that l always go to bed and that lullaby.
00:02:40,00:02:47,"Okay, that's a lot of royalties. The reason it's made so much money is because it's become"
00:02:47,00:02:53,a theme song for a TV show. It's become a theme song for the American quiz show Gipady
00:02:53,00:02:59,because the song was written by the creator of the show who I guess needed a theme song.
00:02:59,00:03:05,It got himself to do it and now paid himself $70 million. He got paid every time it was on.
00:03:05,00:03:11,"Yes, every time it was on and the show is like 230 episodes a year or something and he gets paid"
00:03:11,00:03:16,every time. syndicated globally as well and there's all the different UK and other countries.
00:03:16,00:03:22,Stephen Fry hosts the UK and Australian ones. The thing is about this lullaby is as far as I'm
00:03:22,00:03:27,concerned it's exactly the same as another lullaby which is I'm a little teapot.
00:03:27,00:03:34,"Oh really? So one that goes tip me over, pull me out."
00:03:34,00:03:39,"To me, I've always heard it and I honestly always thought they must have just used"
00:03:39,00:03:44,I'm a little teapot because it was out of copyright. But actually he claimed to have written it.
00:03:44,00:03:48,"Well, I would say that I'm a little teapot is not a lullaby. I certainly wouldn't think"
00:03:48,00:03:52,that to a child I was trying to get to sleep. I think that's more of a high-pup fight song
00:03:52,00:03:58,that kind of thing. What does it? It was the eight-mile of its day.
00:03:58,00:04:02,"But actually, I mean, there were movements involved when you want a child to sleep."
00:04:02,00:04:07,You don't want them doing movement. Yeah. But that was written by a couple of school teachers.
00:04:07,00:04:12,"Really? I think it was in like the 30s or 40s. So in theory, it would have been in copyright"
00:04:12,00:04:16,"when he and this guy who was called, what was he called? Merv Griffin."
00:04:16,00:04:20,Merv Griffin. When Merv Griffin wrote his in theory they could have sued him but I think
00:04:20,00:04:24,"because they were just school teachers, they weren't like, you know. I didn't know that."
00:04:24,00:04:30,"Was it Merv Griffin? He not only created Jeopardy, he created Willa Fortune. He was also the host"
00:04:30,00:04:35,of a lot of TV shows. He was in movies. He was a sort of business empire onto himself.
00:04:35,00:04:42,"And he was like the rich at Usman of America. Yeah, he was. But I do have a bone to pick with old Merv."
00:04:42,00:04:48,"Oh, yeah. Of course. Yeah, he says creator of Jeopardy. He absolutely was not. It was his wife."
00:04:48,00:04:54,"Oh, yeah. His wife, Julian Wright. She was sitting on an airplane and this is in interviews with"
00:04:54,00:04:58,"Merv Griffin where he says, and this will explain the format of Jeopardy in case anyone's not really"
00:04:58,00:05:03,seeing it. His wife was mulling over a game show ideas and said there's not enough successful question
00:05:03,00:05:08,"and answer shows. Those used to be big. They weren't really on TV. And then she said, what happens"
00:05:08,00:05:14,if you swap the answer in question in the format? So what if you were given the answer and you had
00:05:14,00:05:19,"to come up with the question. So the question is, how does it work, right? You're a fan, right? Yeah,"
00:05:19,00:05:24,"yeah. So what you get given is I think it's called sometimes the clue, but it's meant to be in the"
00:05:24,00:05:31,phrase of an answer. So it'll be this city is the biggest in the UK and home to 9 million people
00:05:31,00:05:39,"or something like that. And then you would say, what is Western Superman? I do not know enough about"
00:05:39,00:05:49,"British geography. What is London? The examples she gave on the plane was she said 5,280. The question"
00:05:49,00:05:55,"was, how many feet are in a mile? She also said 79 Whistful Vista. The answer was, is that where"
00:05:55,00:06:00,"Fibre and Molly McGee live? And that was just friends of theirs. Oh, that's a tricky one. There doesn't"
00:06:00,00:06:05,talk about that. I think the thing is though with Jeopardy is like those kind of things wouldn't
00:06:05,00:06:10,"quite work. Because if you say the number of feet in a mile, there's a number of different questions"
00:06:10,00:06:17,"that could be in that answer. Whereas if it's a clue rather than an answer. So it has to be, you can't"
00:06:17,00:06:22,"say these are weird sea things. And I say, what are oysters? Because there are loads of weird"
00:06:22,00:06:26,things. It could be a colour hug. Exactly. Okay. Okay. Because I've always found it incredibly
00:06:26,00:06:30,confusing. I've never seen an episode. I've always found the idea quite baffling. And also if you don't
00:06:30,00:06:36,"say what is or who is or whatever, you don't get the point. Give me a break. Give me a break."
00:06:36,00:06:40,It's got to be real. What is the slogan for Kit Kat?
00:06:40,00:06:49,Close enough. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Do they have this show in New Zealand?
00:06:49,00:06:54,"No, I illegally watch it on YouTube every day. Don't tell anyone. My profession is, but yeah,"
00:06:54,00:06:59,I find it fascinating. And also you'll write about what move Griffin said about how he came up with
00:06:59,00:07:04,"the show. Well, I was just sitting there, my wife had a nightmare. The shame of being single,"
00:07:04,00:07:12,"I'm half as efficient, you know. Well, he was like a big deal. And he was an actor. And I think he"
00:07:12,00:07:18,"was friends with Doris Day, who might have discovered him. I think he was working in a nightclub"
00:07:18,00:07:23,"and Doris Day walked past and said, why do you should do a screen test for Warner Brothers for who"
00:07:23,00:07:30,I'm working. And he did that and he got put in a couple of movies. And I think he probably thought he
00:07:30,00:07:36,"was going to be Doris Day's leading man because they were such good friends, but he was very short."
00:07:36,00:07:41,"He could have been like her love interest who eventually loses the girl, but he was never going"
00:07:41,00:07:46,"to be a leading man really. So he thought he was going into either the hot met, but he was assigned"
00:07:46,00:07:56,with like a hunchback number two. He was a poor bearer at Ronald Reagan's funeral. Maybe through
00:07:56,00:08:01,"acting connections, I don't know, or maybe after he became a very big deal. No, you're right."
00:08:01,00:08:07,"Unless they all were. Yeah, I don't know. And he's the man behind the soul. I've got a lovely bunch"
00:08:07,00:08:13,of coconut. He was the original singer of the one who made it the big song that it became.
00:08:13,00:08:17,"Yeah, that's crazy. Yeah, so not behind it. Sorry, the one of the the singers who made it big."
00:08:17,00:08:22,"And the other thing about him, just last thing on him personally that I found fascinating was"
00:08:22,00:08:28,"he also created, as you said, I think James wheel of fortune to another incredibly big game show."
00:08:28,00:08:34,"And of course, we know that the theme tune for that show was written by Alan Thickey,"
00:08:34,00:08:38,father of Robin Thickey. I've read the podcast. I've read the podcast. I've got that. Yes.
00:08:39,00:08:46,"Do you know Robin Thickey? I know Robin Thickey. Oh, yes, it's no common miscurses."
00:08:46,00:08:52,"On this podcast, he will always be Robin Thickey. He gets furious people mispronounce his name."
00:08:52,00:08:58,"Robin, because it makes him sound thick if you call him Robin Thickey. He's very clever, man."
00:08:58,00:09:05,"He also had a chat show, very famously, Murf. He interviewed an estimated 25,000 people."
00:09:05,00:09:10,"And he said that his best interview was with Austin Wells, because Austin Wells was very guided"
00:09:10,00:09:16,"individual. He didn't really say anything about his personal life. But just before the show,"
00:09:16,00:09:20,"Austin Wells said, you know, these wonderful gossipy things that you've always wanted to ask about"
00:09:20,00:09:26,"my past. And Murf says, yeah, yeah, but I'm not allowed to ask those. Am I? And Austin Wells says,"
00:09:26,00:09:31,"well, tonight you are, I'm feeling very expansive. And he did the interview and he asked him all these"
00:09:31,00:09:36,questions that he wouldn't answer in the past. And Austin Wells went home and died two hours later.
00:09:36,00:09:43,"So his like, this is my last chance to get it out. Wow. Holy moly. But he did, yeah, he died of natural"
00:09:43,00:09:55,causes as a person. Murf and Murf. We mentioned Wheeler Fortune earlier. There is a person
00:09:55,00:10:01,"on that show called Vanna White, who has a Guinness World Record. Okay. Can you guess what it is?"
00:10:01,00:10:09,"Vanna White. What was Vanna White? Vanna White was a, she was quite a glamorous lady, glamorous"
00:10:09,00:10:16,"assistant. Oh, it was something like most air was on TV. Okay. So she is the person who turns the"
00:10:16,00:10:22,"answers around because Wheeler Fortune is like Hangman, right? So you've got a word there and you say,"
00:10:22,00:10:26,"can I have an X? Yes, you can. And they'll turn the X. Oh, but there might not be that letter there."
00:10:26,00:10:30,"It is not in the phrase you understand. I can tell you. So it's this person's job, but she now has a"
00:10:30,00:10:41,"World Record. And she's done something 3,721,446 times as of the night of February 2015."
00:10:41,00:10:46,"Was it touching letters? Well, records, touching letters."
00:10:46,00:10:49,"Because, hey, Santa's got that record. Have you done that?"
00:10:49,00:10:59,"Has she collapsed? Correct. Yeah. So whenever they get one of the letters, right,"
00:10:59,00:11:04,"she turns it round as she claps. That's always counted the claps. Wow, with some of those"
00:11:04,00:11:15,and she appeared in all but 10 of the 6151 episodes up until Guinness made this record.
00:11:15,00:11:20,And she clapped in all of them and she had a World Record. And the reason that they had a hostess
00:11:20,00:11:25,"on their atoll is because they did, they were going to motorise the board, which is what you would do."
00:11:25,00:11:31,"It's like, can I have an L? And the L just turns round. But they couldn't finish making the motor."
00:11:31,00:11:34,And so they had to hire someone to actually turn the pictures.
00:11:34,00:11:37,"Just on computers doing this kind of stuff. So,"
00:11:37,00:11:42,Japanese famously faced Watson in 2011. Super computer.
00:11:42,00:11:48,Yeah. Yeah. And Watson won beat two humans who were playing alongside it.
00:11:48,00:11:51,It's a three-player game. And one of them was like the best.
00:11:51,00:11:57,"They were both the top champions. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter, who I think both"
00:11:57,00:12:02,hold records in the Jupiter universe. Really? I didn't know there was a Japanese universe.
00:12:02,00:12:12,The JCU. Never checked it out. There's a website called J Archive. And it's a fan-made website.
00:12:12,00:12:18,And it's a record of every question ever asked. How much dollar values were waged and whatnot? Who won?
00:12:18,00:12:22,"Pitches of the people who played. Every like word that was said on an episode, all categorized there."
00:12:22,00:12:26,"And Alex Trebek, one of the longtime hosts of the show, found out about it."
00:12:26,00:12:29,"And he said, ""Come on people, get a life."""
00:12:29,00:12:34,What is the pay signal on the P2?
00:12:34,00:12:45,"Okay, it is time for fact number two. And that is my fact."
00:12:45,00:12:52,"My fact this week is that every year in Japan, thousands of receptionists apply to compete against"
00:12:52,00:13:02,each other in the all-Japan phone answering championship. This is amazing. This is a competition
00:13:02,00:13:10,"exclusively for office workers, mostly receptionists. And every year, literally thousands and thousands"
00:13:10,00:13:16,apply so that they could go to a competition where they sit on stage and they are judged on how well
00:13:16,00:13:22,they receive a phone call and deal with questions. And it lasts three minutes long for each of them.
00:13:22,00:13:27,And then they hang up. And then a decision is made on how great they performed. And they're given
00:13:27,00:13:33,things like a problem. It's called each year. A new problem is created. And they are given
00:13:33,00:13:39,"the same problem for all competitors. Yeah, it is. But you would not be able to you must be kept away"
00:13:39,00:13:43,from otherwise you see what the problem is. I think they tell you before you go on because there's
00:13:43,00:13:53,"like, so the 2025 one was for a theoretical beef tongue restaurant in Sendai City, which has the"
00:13:53,00:14:00,"slogan, ""Bringing smiles to customers faces through beef tongue."" And basically, you get all the"
00:14:00,00:14:04,"menus and all the different places it could deliver beef tugs to. And then someone will reg up, go,"
00:14:04,00:14:10,"excuse me, do you have any pork tugs? Do you have to like answer that? I'm a vegetarian. What do you"
00:14:10,00:14:15,have for me? And you're told what's going to be asked as well? You're told the problem. So there's
00:14:15,00:14:20,"no, there's no plot twists or anything like that. You're even given a role in their 2025 one. You are"
00:14:20,00:14:26,Yun Katakura. You are an employee responsible for operating the online shop and handling inquiries
00:14:26,00:14:34,about beef tongue. But you have to do it with a straight face. I think it's like a lot of it's like
00:14:34,00:14:40,how polite you are. It's how clear you are. It sounds like there's a lot of quite formal etiquette
00:14:40,00:14:45,"as well. And in terms of how you answer the phone, you're meant to answer on the first or the second"
00:14:45,00:14:50,"ring. If you only get to it on the third ring, that's an apology straight away. If you pick it up"
00:14:50,00:14:55,straight away and you're too keen on the beef tongue. I think it's very precise. If you're in a
00:14:55,00:15:01,"phone answering competition, you're waiting for the third ring. That's crazy. That's the bad boy."
00:15:01,00:15:11,I think you're talking general Japanese etiquettes. Apparently it's judged out of 100 points.
00:15:11,00:15:16,"I got this from a translation of a site that talks about the 2025 competition. So yeah,"
00:15:16,00:15:21,it's judged on six different criteria. First impression. So you're the first line that you say.
00:15:21,00:15:26,"Hello. Did you deal with that? Criterion number two, basic call handling skills, which is 20 points,"
00:15:26,00:15:32,"voice volume, speaking speed, natural intonation, clear voice production and pronunciation. That's"
00:15:32,00:15:38,"what that one is. Oh, well, it's important. Yeah. Then there's communication skills. There's provision"
00:15:38,00:15:45,of information and service. Final impression. Bye. Let's just let's just try it. Let's just try
00:15:45,00:15:53,"with you. Yes. Ringling. Hello. Sorry. That was a bit quick. It's keen. And also in Japan, they don't say"
00:15:53,00:16:01,"hello. We need you to do the full voice. In Japan, you answer the phone, mochi-mochi. Of course."
00:16:01,00:16:12,"And do you know why that is? It's because they speak Japanese. Well, that is undoubtedly true,"
00:16:12,00:16:20,"but it doesn't mean hello. It means it's short for a moushi again, muscle, which means I am going to"
00:16:20,00:16:26,"talk. And it's because in polite Japanese society, especially if you're speaking to someone who is"
00:16:26,00:16:30,"more important than you, you wouldn't say hello. You had to announce the fact that you want to talk"
00:16:30,00:16:37,"before you do, which is tough because then you are talking. So usually we say mochi-mochi before you say"
00:16:37,00:16:42,mochi-mochi. Can I ask you a question? It's the can I ask you a question in Japanese?
00:16:42,00:16:47,"I'm asking a question. No, no, exactly. But there's another theory, according to a folklorist"
00:16:47,00:16:56,"called Uekasal. Apparently, mochi-mochi is impossible to say if you are a magic fox."
00:16:56,00:17:06,"The life of the magic fox just gets harder and harder. There's a thing called the backimono fox,"
00:17:06,00:17:13,and this fox is like a trickster in folklore. And one thing that it does is it can learn to speak like
00:17:13,00:17:19,"and imitate a human, but it can say lots of the words, but it can't say mochi-mochi. And so according"
00:17:19,00:17:24,"to this folklorist, one of the reasons people say mochi-mochi is because then if they say that,"
00:17:24,00:17:30,"they know that you're not a magic fox. Shibulath, right? Shibulath. Yeah, exactly. And as a result,"
00:17:30,00:17:37,"magic fox crime stats are down way down. Especially when it comes to like fishing, like trying"
00:17:37,00:17:43,"to get your bank details on the phone. They just don't do it. A lot of younger Japanese people,"
00:17:43,00:17:46,"and I think this is a global thing as well, I'm becoming more nervous about answering the phone."
00:17:46,00:17:53,This is a thing. There's a study in the UK that found that a quarter of people aged 18 to 34
00:17:53,00:18:00,never answer the phone. I would never answer the phone. Really? I don't. I do. I like it.
00:18:00,00:18:06,"I spend the wheel. Who's this? Yeah, but it's always some spam, isn't it?"
00:18:06,00:18:13,It's often someone with a really good offer for me actually. And that's why Andy's living in the
00:18:13,00:18:23,basement of this building. Another magic fox got me. But there's this other thing that is
00:18:23,00:18:26,"happening now, especially when younger people aren't answering the phone, they'll answer it,"
00:18:26,00:18:31,but they won't say anything because they're waiting for it. I did that as well. Do you?
00:18:31,00:18:36,Because you can kind of hear the click. And also what happens often is they won't say anything.
00:18:36,00:18:43,"And then as soon as you talk, then the automatic voice comes in and it says, hello, I've got a great"
00:18:43,00:18:56,"deal for you. 50,000 kilos of beef tock. Yes. Yes. Yes. Have you guys experienced this other thing?"
00:18:56,00:19:02,"And this has only been recently launched. Yelp, the sort of phone people, the company launched"
00:19:02,00:19:06,this thing recently. You can have a proper conversation with an AI voice that answers your phone.
00:19:06,00:19:16,So I'm in the process of I'm getting my hob removed. And sorry. I'm trying to have my hob ripped out
00:19:16,00:19:23,at the moment. I can't believe you should have to work today. That's why you're on a limping up the
00:19:23,00:19:29,system. And I phoned up this company trying to get a quote. And I had a whole conversation with a
00:19:29,00:19:36,"robot that was doing a quote for me, like saying what's the size of it and what shape it is. But as"
00:19:36,00:19:42,"in I had a proper yeah, I found it very upsetting and horrible. Sometimes I that's how I feel when we're"
00:19:42,00:19:51,"doing this podcast. You know that you're not talking to a proper intelligence. But yeah,"
00:19:51,00:19:57,"could you tell it was an AI? I could have good intonations, good production of speech, good whatever"
00:19:57,00:20:01,"that. Well, it did. But weirdly, I could tell. Oh, yeah. I said, it sounded like a person, but there"
00:20:01,00:20:05,was just a slight sort of filter over the whole call that maybe realized it was a machine talking.
00:20:05,00:20:11,"It's really weird because the final criteria, the sixth criteria of this whole thing is actually"
00:20:11,00:20:16,sort of an overall evaluation. So it sort of almost doesn't matter what happened between one
00:20:16,00:20:20,"and five. They could have given you high marks. But then they're like, now that I think about it,"
00:20:20,00:20:25,I wasn't so much impressed with these certain moments. And you can get points for it even if you
00:20:25,00:20:29,"didn't get anything resolved in the call, but it sounded like a nice chat. You get points for that."
00:20:29,00:20:36,"You can also get points for excellent silence. Just for like, wow, you were brilliant with the"
00:20:36,00:20:48,silence there. Yeah. Points for everyone. I looked it up and I think it was the 2015 winner.
00:20:49,00:20:55,Was a was a was a she practiced to win this competition. She practiced for three minute conversations
00:20:55,00:21:02,for two hours a day over a period of four months. Wow. That's a very patient partner.
00:21:02,00:21:09,"That's amazing. Well, it's it is thousands who apply, but it's only about 60 to 80 that make it to"
00:21:09,00:21:14,the actual stage. I guess is there an audience? Is there a big audience apart from the judges?
00:21:14,00:21:18,"I've seen a video, but I've only seen it off the stage. I couldn't quite tell because it's the"
00:21:18,00:21:23,show is 60 to 80 people doing the same three minute conversation. I can imagine that wouldn't be very
00:21:23,00:21:29,"varied, basically. Yeah. I did read that one of the recent winners answered the phone and conducted"
00:21:29,00:21:34,"the conversation in a very traditional and formal style, which is what got to the points with the"
00:21:34,00:21:38,"judges, although you wouldn't maybe naturally have a conversation like that. If you were answering"
00:21:38,00:21:43,"the phone and in a normal Japanese business, basically, they're all sorts of, apparently there are"
00:21:43,00:21:49,at least 60 books in Japan available exclusively on phone etiquette. It's a real thing. Yeah. Yeah.
00:21:49,00:21:53,"Obviously, it's a country with a huge amount of etiquette in all sorts of areas, but yeah,"
00:21:53,00:21:59,it's fascinating. General reception. I was trying to find out some more things about general
00:21:59,00:22:04,receptionists and receptionism. Okay. Got it. Okay. Most successful receptionist of all time.
00:22:06,00:22:15,"Okay. Good question. Is it the receptionist from the apprentice TV show in the UK who literally,"
00:22:15,00:22:19,"well, they they have this whole pretence of them being in the ballroom and you're fired and stuff,"
00:22:19,00:22:24,and then they go out and then supposedly Alan Sugar decides what's going to happen. And then
00:22:24,00:22:28,"they cut to someone who doesn't even seem to be in the same building, picking up a phone and going,"
00:22:28,00:22:33,"yes, Lord Sugar, I'll send them in now and then put it and then they cut to the ballroom and they're"
00:22:33,00:22:40,"all ed. So that just feels like like a good job. Yeah. That's really good. No, the queen."
00:22:40,00:22:47,"Choose a receptionist. Oh, the current queen consort. Oh, come on, come on, come on, stop that."
00:22:47,00:22:51,"This is started out as a receptionist. I mean, it's a natural career progression, isn't it?"
00:22:51,00:23:01,"I'll be promoted. You're made queen. Did she? Yeah. Obviously, a very posh company in their"
00:23:01,00:23:06,"reception and I think she was sacked for turning up late. But I found out, interesting fact, Charles"
00:23:06,00:23:14,and Camilla had the same gynecologist when they were born. Charles had a gynecologist. I
00:23:14,00:23:20,suppose Charles and Camilla's mothers were both assisted by the same. Charles has no gynecologist.
00:23:20,00:23:33,He had his hub removed it. Oh my gosh. Here is an accidental receptionist. In
00:23:33,00:23:40,"Reykjavik in 2015, there was a security guard in the Prime Minister's office who went away from"
00:23:40,00:23:44,"the office for the day, but normally what you do is you put your mobile phone number into the"
00:23:44,00:23:49,"system and then if anyone phones the Prime Minister, then it would come through to you and you can"
00:23:49,00:23:55,"sort of take messages and whatever. Anyway, someone put the wrong number in and a woman who lived in"
00:23:55,00:24:04,Reykjavik to start getting phone calls for the Prime Minister of Iceland. That's such a prank.
00:24:04,00:24:11,"If you can arrange that for someone, that is amazing. What happened? What did you do? Nothing. It was"
00:24:11,00:24:15,just for like one day or so until they all came back in the office and she said it's been no bother.
00:24:15,00:24:23,This is Inge Björg Sigurvins.ir. It's been no bother. I am a citizen of this country and I am ready
00:24:23,00:24:29,to help. But it should be like pageant. Pouching through calls from world leaders and things.
00:24:29,00:24:36,"I really like this, which is ELO Electric Light Orchestra. It's one of my favorite bands. So"
00:24:36,00:24:40,"their debut album came out in 1971. It's called Electric Light Orchestra, out here in the UK."
00:24:40,00:24:47,Released in America in March of 1972 with the title No Answer. And that's because the record
00:24:47,00:24:51,"exec in America said to someone in the office, ""Can you call England and find out what the debut"
00:24:51,00:24:57,"album is called?"" They called. No one picked up. They wrote in the notes, no answer. The execs"
00:24:57,00:25:03,"all had. And thought, ""Great title."" And that became the title of the album. It was just self-titled."
00:25:03,00:25:15,"ELO. Is that because someone rang up the office and they went, ""Ello""?"
00:25:15,00:25:18,"Okay, it is time for fact number three. And that is James."
00:25:18,00:25:24,"Okay, my fact this week is that philosopher Jean Jacques Rousseau, one of the most important figures"
00:25:24,00:25:32,"of the Enlightenment, father of European political thought, and one of the inspirations behind"
00:25:32,00:25:37,"the French Revolution, would run around Paris with his bum out hoping someone would spank him."
00:25:37,00:25:45,Did that start the French Revolution? We have to stop this guy. Off with his bum.
00:25:45,00:25:54,"So yeah, Jean Jacques Rousseau, unbelievably famous in his time, one of the most important"
00:25:54,00:26:00,thinkers of the age. And it turned out that he had a pretty difficult childhood and it stuck him
00:26:00,00:26:06,"with some fetishes. And one of them was that he loved being spanked. And just before he died,"
00:26:06,00:26:12,"he had a book called Confessions, which was very autobiographical, but it was like it was"
00:26:12,00:26:18,"what's an all. And he said that he would go around Paris, winning the Mahous style, hoping that"
00:26:18,00:26:22,someone would spank him. And then what happened was sometimes he got the ship beat out of him.
00:26:22,00:26:28,"Did he? Yeah, like a group of people who didn't think much of that kind of thing would grab"
00:26:28,00:26:32,"hold of him and start kicking him, and he'd have to escape? I think that's fair. Yeah."
00:26:32,00:26:39,"He was hanging around in alleys, hoping for, I presume, what would be quite a rare result"
00:26:39,00:26:43,"with someone to administer a spanking. I mean, it sort of... I'd be in a publisher right here and now."
00:26:43,00:26:49,"It feels like a behaviour that would be looked down upon these days. Yeah, you probably couldn't"
00:26:49,00:26:56,"even do that anymore, because of Woke. It does feel like famous philosopher pervert, which is a"
00:26:56,00:27:05,"smaller headline, but it's striking that he confessed it. Yeah. His confessions were really sort of like,"
00:27:05,00:27:11,"I'm going to admit everything now. Yeah. But his confessions, he wrote what is largely"
00:27:11,00:27:17,"seen as the first autobiography. It's often said to be the first autobiography, and he would go"
00:27:17,00:27:21,"around to parties and he would read extracts of his confessions. So he titled it Confessions,"
00:27:21,00:27:28,I believe. Confessions of a smack addict. I think that was the... Yeah. It's so funny that he
00:27:28,00:27:33,"was moaning people in alleyway. Do you think they looked down in alleyways? Inside that alleyway,"
00:27:33,00:27:46,"is there a smaller, narrower alleyway? Oh, my God. But yes, he did publish the first,"
00:27:46,00:27:50,"what is considered the first autobiography, the Confessions, and he discussed some of his least"
00:27:50,00:27:57,"glamorous moments, which included that he abandoned five of his children, and that he once stole a"
00:27:57,00:28:04,"ribbon. So those two were sort of on equal to... Yeah. But the ribbon that he did, I think, accuse"
00:28:04,00:28:10,"he said that it made in another serve and had stolen and given it to him, and that's how he came across"
00:28:10,00:28:15,"it. He was... He's an interesting cookie, isn't he? He's kind of... Because a lot of... Right, just for"
00:28:15,00:28:20,"context, this is what Dan says about some of the worst people you've ever heard of. He was a character."
00:28:20,00:28:28,"He was a character. Because he... Check the ripper, a little strong cookie. He's Marmite. He's Marmite."
00:28:28,00:28:40,"So he was from Geneva, and his father was also from Geneva, but he had this sort of idea that he"
00:28:40,00:28:46,"was from some incredible Patricia family, very important he felt he was. He was a watchmaker,"
00:28:46,00:28:53,"but he married above his station, and he thought he was so up a class that he always brandished a"
00:28:53,00:29:00,"sword wherever he went. That was not allowed in Geneva at the time. Okay. So he got kicked out of Geneva,"
00:29:00,00:29:06,and the whole family got kicked out. Oh gosh. And eventually Rousseau was sent to live with a
00:29:06,00:29:13,"Calvinist minister and his daughter, and it was the daughter, Mamoiselle Lambertier, who used to"
00:29:13,00:29:18,"treat him like he was her child, and she would spank him when he'd done something naughty. And then in"
00:29:18,00:29:24,"the end, he would just do things naughty deliberately so that he got spanked. Yeah. And that's how he ended"
00:29:24,00:29:30,"up with this. It's so... Because his most famous quote is, ""Man is born free, but everywhere he is in"
00:29:30,00:29:36,"chains."" And I assume that chains would be to be bad, but now maybe he was quite a good way,"
00:29:36,00:29:41,"but everywhere he is in chains and hopefully a whirlpool. Man has been a very, very naughty boy."
00:29:41,00:29:49,"He also believed that there was this idea of the natural man, and that civilization was actually a"
00:29:49,00:29:54,complete con job that made everyone miserable. I mean it was a very... We would all be really happy if
00:29:54,00:29:58,"we were just left to live our own lives, and we wouldn't have to go to work every day and go on the"
00:29:58,00:30:04,tube. Yeah. But basically he just thought anything that was an invention of modern society was bad.
00:30:04,00:30:08,And that's why he thought... And so it's really weird that he was a great writer about childhood
00:30:08,00:30:14,"considering that he abandoned all of his children to an orphanage, but he kind of overturned a"
00:30:14,00:30:19,"previous very prevailing view that children are naturally evil and naturally fallen, you know,"
00:30:19,00:30:24,born with original sin. He was saying no children are naturally wonderful and should just be left
00:30:24,00:30:31,"alone, which is not a recipe for good adults. So, you read a lot about philosophers, because he had"
00:30:31,00:30:36,"a particular interest of yours. Yes, a little bit, a little bit. We didn't get him as much,"
00:30:36,00:30:40,and so this was interesting reading up on him. Did you rate him as a philosopher?
00:30:40,00:30:46,"Yeah, no, yes, definitely. The influence he's had is crazy, and his development on the social"
00:30:46,00:30:51,contract theory and his ideas about democracy. I mean it almost seems quite now looking back at a guy
00:30:51,00:30:57,"who's writing him, ""I think democracy would be a good idea."" But at the time it was like divine"
00:30:57,00:31:03,"writer kings, this idea that the government didn't have to be responsible to its people. So he was"
00:31:03,00:31:08,"groundbreaking, I think, for the time, for sure. But I didn't realise just how crazy his life was."
00:31:08,00:31:14,"I learned that his mother, Suzanne, she had to go to a church hearing, I think they had sort of"
00:31:14,00:31:20,"a religious, I don't know, police or system in Geneva at the time. And she had to go to a church"
00:31:20,00:31:27,"hearing for going to the street theatre disguised as a peasant woman, so she could gaze upon"
00:31:27,00:31:35,invents and caress in whom she fancied despite him being married. It apparently theater was illegal
00:31:35,00:31:41,at the time. So the Geneva non-Calvinists shared to account for herself. He didn't know that.
00:31:41,00:31:47,"He didn't like theatre either, Jean-Jacques. So Volta introduced a theatre to Geneva,"
00:31:47,00:31:51,"at which point Rousseau wrote to him, ""You have ruined Geneva. I hate you."""
00:31:51,00:31:54,He once pissed in his neighbour's kettle.
00:31:54,00:31:56,Did he?
00:31:56,00:31:58,"Yeah, that's in his confessions. I don't know if he wrote that out."
00:31:58,00:32:05,"My turn, his neighbour picks up the box, goes to the index in the back, looks like it would have been mentioned."
00:32:05,00:32:06,That's nice.
00:32:06,00:32:08,Flocking his cup of tea.
00:32:13,00:32:21,He didn't like gender equality. He was very much of the idea that men are in charge and women are not.
00:32:21,00:32:28,"And there was another philosopher called Olymp de Gouge, who was a French activist and playwright."
00:32:28,00:32:33,"And she really liked Rousseau's philosophy in general, but she really critiqued his idea that women"
00:32:33,00:32:39,"shouldn't have as much role in society. And she said, ""If a woman has a right to mount the scaffold,"
00:32:39,00:32:43,"she must equally have the right to mount the speaker's platform."""
00:32:43,00:32:47,"And then two years later, she was executed."
00:32:47,00:32:49,"So, for inter-revolution?"
00:32:49,00:32:51,In the reign of Tera.
00:32:51,00:32:57,"Oh, yeah, for just for political writings, which was a little bit frowned upon at the time."
00:32:57,00:33:01,"Mary Wollstonecraft as well, all sort of vindication of the rights of a woman."
00:33:01,00:33:07,"She and Mary Shelley's mum, and she and he had big beef, because again, all part of his,"
00:33:07,00:33:12,"I think his theory that the natural is perfect. He then wrote, ""Oh, well, actually, you know,"
00:33:12,00:33:17,"it's women's nature to give care, and that's therefore all they should be taught to do."""
00:33:17,00:33:22,"It was a very aggressive theory, even at the time, and Wollstonecraft argued back pretty stiffly."
00:33:22,00:33:26,But Rousseau inspired the journey that produced Frankenstein.
00:33:26,00:33:27,Really?
00:33:27,00:33:31,"Yeah, so you know, Mary Shelley and Byron and Percy Shelley went to Lake Geneva."
00:33:31,00:33:34,They went to Lake Geneva in 1816.
00:33:34,00:33:38,"They were following in the footsteps of one of his novels, which was called ""Juley"","
00:33:38,00:33:42,"and it sat at the east end of Lake Geneva, and they were going on a bit of,"
00:33:42,00:33:46,"I don't know what the term is, where you said, ""Well, you said really well. Yeah, come on."""
00:33:46,00:33:48,"They were following that, and so that's why they ended up there."
00:33:48,00:33:49,"Oh, cool."
00:33:49,00:33:51,I didn't know that. That's fantastic.
00:33:51,00:33:57,"Rousseau's dad back to being a watchmaker. He said, ""Just a random burn from his father,"
00:33:57,00:34:02,"Mr. Rousseau said, ""A Geneva watchmaker is a man who can be introduced anywhere."
00:34:02,00:34:06,"A perisian watchmaker is only fit to talk about watches."""
00:34:06,00:34:10,"So this has a hard-core burn amongst the watchmaking community,"
00:34:10,00:34:13,"1700s, Geneva."
00:34:13,00:34:19,"I've never, I wouldn't associate France with watchmaking, probably for that reason, right?"
00:34:19,00:34:21,"Swiss watchmaking, of course."
00:34:21,00:34:22,Yes.
00:34:22,00:34:26,A French cuckoo clockmaker is only fit to talk about cuckoo clocks.
00:34:26,00:34:28,Swiss cuckoo clockmaker.
00:34:28,00:34:30,French tubular omega.
00:34:30,00:34:34,(Laughter)
00:34:34,00:34:44,"Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show, and that is Andy."
00:34:44,00:34:48,"My fact is, ""Rays Flirt"" by Belly Flopping."
00:34:48,00:34:50,I told you they're in confidence.
00:34:50,00:34:53,(Laughter)
00:34:53,00:34:54,"Like a mantra, right?"
00:34:54,00:34:55,"Like a mantra, right?"
00:34:55,00:34:58,"They're all sorts of, I think they're 11 different species of"
00:34:59,00:35:04,"modular ray, which are the great big diamond-shaped rays that you get"
00:35:04,00:35:08,with a mouth at one end and a tail at the other and two enormous lovely wings in between.
00:35:08,00:35:15,"And some of the species, specifically monk's devil ray, but I think a few of them do it,"
00:35:15,00:35:19,they do these incredible ballet displays out of the water.
00:35:19,00:35:23,They gather in big groups and then they just launch themselves out and they go about two meters
00:35:23,00:35:26,"into the air. And these are huge animals as well, like they're big."
00:35:27,00:35:30,And they land with this great big splash and they do it for hours at a time.
00:35:30,00:35:36,"And while I say flirt, scientists are reasonably confident it's communication."
00:35:36,00:35:41,And it might be a way of luring more rays to your ray mating event.
00:35:41,00:35:43,"Okay, I'm sorry, Ray."
00:35:43,00:35:44,"Is that what you call it, Ray?"
00:35:44,00:35:45,(Laughter)
00:35:45,00:35:48,"It's often quite a solo, I don't know if these guys are."
00:35:48,00:35:49,What do they have in the night?
00:35:49,00:35:52,(Laughter)
00:35:52,00:35:54,There are hundreds of them in there.
00:35:54,00:35:54,I'm sorry.
00:35:54,00:35:59,(Laughter)
00:35:59,00:36:03,"So it might be flirting, basically, it might be hunting, but it seems to be communicating."
00:36:03,00:36:04,They're not sure.
00:36:04,00:36:07,The mating habits of rays come on.
00:36:07,00:36:08,Come on.
00:36:08,00:36:09,Have you heard of the man-to-train?
00:36:09,00:36:12,No.
00:36:12,00:36:14,This is man-to-rays.
00:36:14,00:36:16,There's a real replacement man-to-bus.
00:36:16,00:36:17,I'm afraid today.
00:36:17,00:36:20,(Laughter)
00:36:20,00:36:26,This is a way of courting that happens amongst man-to-rays where a female will swim up front
00:36:26,00:36:30,and she'll be followed by a train of male man-to-swimming behind her.
00:36:30,00:36:31,Like a conger?
00:36:31,00:36:33,"Yeah, exactly like a conger."
00:36:33,00:36:35,And it's called it the conger reel.
00:36:35,00:36:36,That would have been a clever...
00:36:36,00:36:38,"Yes, it would have been confusing."
00:36:38,00:36:40,"It would have been very confusing, yeah."
00:36:40,00:36:42,And the idea is that they just follow.
00:36:42,00:36:45,"And it can last a very long time, sometimes several weeks,"
00:36:45,00:36:48,where they're just following and then they'll sleep and then follow and so on.
00:36:48,00:36:52,"On what this weekend, I saw a conger of caterpillars."
00:36:52,00:36:52,Did you?
00:36:52,00:36:55,There must have been 30 if there was two.
00:36:55,00:36:56,And there was two.
00:36:56,00:36:58,That was fantastic.
00:36:58,00:36:59,It was in the carpark in Spain.
00:36:59,00:37:03,And they were just walking like...
00:37:03,00:37:05,"As to nose, as to nose, as to nose."
00:37:05,00:37:06,And they were all just wandering along.
00:37:06,00:37:09,And I googled it and apparently they're looking for mating grounds
00:37:09,00:37:11,or food or something.
00:37:11,00:37:14,But they always go in this sort of conger line.
00:37:14,00:37:15,Were they heading...
00:37:15,00:37:16,Were they near the edge of the carpark?
00:37:16,00:37:17,"No, they all know."
00:37:17,00:37:18,"Oh, yeah."
00:37:18,00:37:19,"Oh, stuff."
00:37:19,00:37:22,"I just love the thought of you, Ron Holliday, in Spain."
00:37:22,00:37:24,"And everyone's going, ""Oh, he's James, he's eyes on the carpark."""
00:37:24,00:37:26,"Like, it's a cat."
00:37:26,00:37:27,It's a cat.
00:37:27,00:37:28,Just behind the caterpillars.
00:37:28,00:37:33,"Oh, dear."
00:37:33,00:37:34,I'm going to watch Colo.
00:37:34,00:37:35,That is cool.
00:37:35,00:37:36,See this line on the road?
00:37:36,00:37:37,Yeah.
00:37:37,00:37:40,"What it is, and the closer you get, the more you realise that it sees carpilling."
00:37:40,00:37:40,Yeah.
00:37:40,00:37:43,"Well, this, I mean, this sounds like a pretty amazing thing to witness."
00:37:43,00:37:44,And scientists do watch it.
00:37:44,00:37:45,"The story I read, yeah."
00:37:45,00:37:52,"The man to raise, where 20 rays were following the main lady who's called Big Bertha."
00:37:52,00:37:55,"They named, they, I think, the name all the rays."
00:37:55,00:37:57,Because there's Miles Ray.
00:37:57,00:38:00,They said she was being closely followed by Miles Ray.
00:38:00,00:38:03,We thought that he was the one for her later on.
00:38:03,00:38:06,"When we checked out the footage, we found out Lightning Ray had pursued her on his own."
00:38:06,00:38:10,I've got thinking of a few new nicknames for myself.
00:38:10,00:38:13,Have you guys could start calling me Lightning Ray?
00:38:15,00:38:16,"Yeah, so yeah, that's what they do."
00:38:16,00:38:20,"And they just, they've battled it out, or whoever lasts till the end."
00:38:20,00:38:22,I'd also recommend to anyone listening to this.
00:38:22,00:38:26,It is not a smart fluting strategy to follow a woman for weeks at a time.
00:38:26,00:38:28,The group of your friends.
00:38:28,00:38:36,"There was, in 2024, there was a Ray who managed to successfully mate on their own."
00:38:36,00:38:40,And there was a female stingray living with a load of male sharks.
00:38:40,00:38:43,And she became pregnant.
00:38:43,00:38:48,And what a lot of people thought is maybe she'd been impregnated by the sharks.
00:38:48,00:38:50,Because she had like bite marks on the side of her.
00:38:50,00:38:54,And that's quite often sharks will bite when they're mating to kind of get a grip.
00:38:54,00:38:59,"But I think generally speaking, what we think has happened now is that she"
00:38:59,00:39:02,got pregnant through pathogenesis.
00:39:02,00:39:08,"So females have, they have their egg cells, but they also have another thing in"
00:39:08,00:39:10,their body called polar bodies.
00:39:10,00:39:12,And these contain genes as well.
00:39:12,00:39:15,"And if there are no males around, then the polar bodies can get into the eggs"
00:39:15,00:39:17,and they can then turn into...
00:39:17,00:39:18,"Oh, wow."
00:39:18,00:39:19,The virgin birth.
00:39:19,00:39:20,It's virgin birth.
00:39:20,00:39:22,It's even crazier in a way.
00:39:22,00:39:25,"There are some rays, but it sounds like it's not this one."
00:39:25,00:39:29,"Because otherwise, it might have been mentioned that can sort of hold and incubate"
00:39:29,00:39:30,the sperm that they collect.
00:39:30,00:39:33,And that can be held for quite some time.
00:39:33,00:39:34,Critic female choice.
00:39:34,00:39:36,"Yeah, exactly."
00:39:36,00:39:37,"Yeah, that's what I would have thought it was."
00:39:37,00:39:38,But clearly...
00:39:38,00:39:39,"Yeah, well, I don't know."
00:39:39,00:39:44,"Like, the scientists are still not certain, but they think it's this kind of polar body thing."
00:39:44,00:39:47,"Raised in general, I said there are..."
00:39:47,00:39:49,What did I say? I said 11 species of mobular ray.
00:39:49,00:39:52,"And they're known as the mobulids, which is a great name."
00:39:52,00:39:54,So three of those species are manta rays.
00:39:54,00:39:56,"And the other rate are devil rays, right?"
00:39:56,00:39:58,"Sorry, right."
00:39:58,00:39:59,I had no shame.
00:39:59,00:40:00,"Good, no shame."
00:40:00,00:40:04,But they've been recategorised a lot lately.
00:40:04,00:40:06,And I think the last time we talked about them was about eight years ago.
00:40:06,00:40:10,They had just been all shaken up and redistributed and rearranged.
00:40:10,00:40:11,"Oh, yeah."
00:40:11,00:40:12,"Scientifically, it's a new..."
00:40:12,00:40:13,Because there's a new effect.
00:40:13,00:40:15,There's no such thing as a ray.
00:40:15,00:40:16,"Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:40:16,00:40:21,And so the newest manta ray was discovered in 2025 last year.
00:40:21,00:40:23,We're still just going to...
00:40:23,00:40:25,These things are massive as well.
00:40:25,00:40:27,And it was by a scientist called Andrea Marshall.
00:40:27,00:40:33,The Atlantic manta ray is the third species of manta ray that we now know about.
00:40:34,00:40:39,"And back in 2009, she had observed it and thought it was a bit fishy."
00:40:39,00:40:45,"Anyway, and it's taken until now to prove it, right?"
00:40:45,00:40:50,And to sort of demonstrate it and sort of do the analysis to show that it's a separate species.
00:40:50,00:40:54,"The amazing thing was, in 2009, she and her colleagues had also first described"
00:40:54,00:40:55,the second species of manta ray.
00:40:55,00:40:57,I just think it's amazing.
00:40:57,00:41:01,And the reason it's so hard to scientifically describe them
00:41:01,00:41:03,is that what do you need to describe in these species?
00:41:03,00:41:06,You need to know that it's not the same as an old species.
00:41:06,00:41:09,"Yep, but what's the way of proving it is what I mean?"
00:41:09,00:41:11,"Oh, genetic testing."
00:41:11,00:41:13,"Yes, but what do you need to do genetic testing?"
00:41:13,00:41:15,Some genetic material.
00:41:15,00:41:15,You need a body.
00:41:15,00:41:18,Right.
00:41:18,00:41:21,"And these things, they're really hard to study."
00:41:21,00:41:22,"A, because when they die, they sink."
00:41:22,00:41:24,Dimer.
00:41:24,00:41:28,"And secondly, they're made of cartilage, not bone, which decomposes faster."
00:41:28,00:41:28,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:41:28,00:41:31,So it's bloody hard to get hold of a sample.
00:41:31,00:41:35,They're still quite mysterious. They're still quite strange alien things.
00:41:35,00:41:37,And it just takes a very long time to find one that's washed up.
00:41:37,00:41:38,Right.
00:41:38,00:41:40,"And get it to a scientist in time, that kind of thing."
00:41:40,00:41:40,So yeah.
00:41:40,00:41:45,"Can I quickly point out, you did do a fact, no such thing as a ray"
00:41:45,00:41:47,on the show ages ago.
00:41:47,00:41:51,"And I think that applies right here, right now."
00:41:51,00:41:53,Aren't I right?
00:41:53,00:41:54,Matthew.
00:41:54,00:41:58,I've been called to that.
00:41:58,00:41:59,Oh no.
00:41:59,00:42:00,You're not a real ray.
00:42:00,00:42:01,"No, that is true."
00:42:01,00:42:01,That is a ray.
00:42:01,00:42:03,That's ray charlatan.
00:42:03,00:42:06,That's true.
00:42:06,00:42:06,"It's a, it's a neck."
00:42:06,00:42:07,It's a neck day.
00:42:07,00:42:09,"You know, he's called Ray."
00:42:09,00:42:10,It's real nice Matthews.
00:42:10,00:42:12,He's called Ray because he sounds like Ray Romano.
00:42:12,00:42:14,That's what one of his friends thought at school.
00:42:14,00:42:15,From everybody loves Raymond.
00:42:15,00:42:17,And they'd all just started calling me Ray.
00:42:17,00:42:19,And that's how it's called on.
00:42:19,00:42:20,And I'm no one's genetically tested me here.
00:42:20,00:42:25,No one's noticed that I'm not a genetically different species to Ray Romano.
00:42:26,00:42:30,You know that Ray Romano really hated the name of that show?
00:42:30,00:42:32,Everybody loves Raymond.
00:42:32,00:42:38,And he hated it so much that he kept saying to the producers we need to change this title.
00:42:38,00:42:42,"And they made a deal with him apparently that if they made it into a top 10 show,"
00:42:42,00:42:43,they will change the name.
00:42:43,00:42:47,"And then they did it for a few years, became more and more successful."
00:42:47,00:42:49,"Eventually, they cracked the top 10."
00:42:49,00:42:52,"He went into the producers and said, right, we've got a deal."
00:42:52,00:42:53,It's time to change the name.
00:42:53,00:42:54,"And they said, well, we can't change it."
00:42:54,00:42:55,Now it's a top 10 show.
00:42:56,00:42:59,"Oh man, that's so funny."
00:42:59,00:43:00,That's great.
00:43:00,00:43:01,Everyone loves Raymond.
00:43:01,00:43:02,Ray hated that name.
00:43:02,00:43:04,Here's another one.
00:43:04,00:43:05,"Ray Parker, Jr."
00:43:05,00:43:06,You heard of him?
00:43:06,00:43:07,Ghostbusters.
00:43:07,00:43:08,"Right, the song Ghostbusters."
00:43:08,00:43:09,Yes.
00:43:09,00:43:11,"Turns out, revealed in an interview recently,"
00:43:11,00:43:12,he is afraid of ghosts.
00:43:12,00:43:18,"You're busting myth off today, today."
00:43:18,00:43:19,I trusted him.
00:43:19,00:43:23,And he used to be a solo artist called Radio.
00:43:23,00:43:24,That's a cool nickname.
00:43:24,00:43:26,"That is a cool name, yeah."
00:43:26,00:43:29,"They can be huge, Ray's."
00:43:29,00:43:32,They can be 17 feet long.
00:43:32,00:43:34,A giant devil ray.
00:43:34,00:43:36,"I mean, that's really, really big."
00:43:36,00:43:37,"Is that, and because"
00:43:37,00:43:40,is there wingspan bigger than their length?
00:43:40,00:43:41,"They're usually about the same, I think."
00:43:41,00:43:42,They're legs wet.
00:43:42,00:43:45,"They're like, yeah, they're diamonds."
00:43:45,00:43:45,"Yeah, yes."
00:43:45,00:43:50,"But a mentorate 10 feet long needs to eat about,"
00:43:50,00:43:54,"well, I suppose, any mentorate needs to eat about 12% of its body weight"
00:43:54,00:43:55,"every week, right?"
00:43:55,00:43:56,Every week.
00:43:56,00:43:57,That's not much.
00:43:57,00:43:58,"I don't fully know, like, what do we have to eat?"
00:43:58,00:44:01,"Well, let's say you weigh 100 kilos, it'll be less than that,"
00:44:01,00:44:04,"but so that'd be 12 kilos worth of food a week,"
00:44:04,00:44:07,which is less than two kilos per day.
00:44:07,00:44:10,Two kilos feels like a lot.
00:44:10,00:44:12,I'm thinking of my chocolate cereal in the morning.
00:44:12,00:44:13,I'm thinking of my...
00:44:13,00:44:17,"If you buy a steak, it would be like 250 grams, right?"
00:44:17,00:44:18,"Yeah, that's good."
00:44:18,00:44:19,So that is a fair bit.
00:44:19,00:44:23,So you would have to eat eight steaks every day.
00:44:23,00:44:23,Okay.
00:44:23,00:44:24,"Okay, so that is a fair bit."
00:44:24,00:44:27,"I'm thinking of 10 kg of potatoes, plus a little bit more."
00:44:27,00:44:29,Right.
00:44:29,00:44:31,We all have our ways to visualize it.
00:44:31,00:44:35,"Well, that was on men2brayadvocates.com."
00:44:35,00:44:36,"Oh, yeah."
00:44:36,00:44:37,It was just a cracking website.
00:44:37,00:44:38,You may have found it in the course of your research.
00:44:38,00:44:40,I'm on the devil rise education.
00:44:40,00:44:44,"No, no, no, no, no, no."
00:44:44,00:44:45,I love it.
00:44:45,00:44:46,Thank you.
00:44:46,00:44:47,But they can only eat plankton.
00:44:47,00:44:49,They can't eat 250 grams steak.
00:44:49,00:44:50,They zoo plankton.
00:44:50,00:44:52,"You know, tiny, tiny things in the water."
00:44:52,00:44:55,And men2brayadvocates.com calculated
00:44:55,00:44:57,that a 10-foot ray would need to eat
00:44:57,00:44:59,how many pieces of plankton a week?
00:44:59,00:45:01,This is a guessing game.
00:45:01,00:45:02,Yeah.
00:45:02,00:45:03,10 million.
00:45:03,00:45:03,10 million.
00:45:03,00:45:04,"T-pot, short."
00:45:04,00:45:05,"Oh, great."
00:45:05,00:45:06,Okay. 10 million.
00:45:06,00:45:08,"What, 1.2 feet of plankton?"
00:45:08,00:45:12,"I mean, okay, because you've done it in a different seat."
00:45:12,00:45:13,"You know, and that's fine."
00:45:13,00:45:15,"Oh, I see."
00:45:15,00:45:16,Yeah.
00:45:16,00:45:17,Very clever.
00:45:17,00:45:17,Very clever.
00:45:17,00:45:21,So you can just explain that for the rest of the journey.
00:45:21,00:45:23,[LAUGHTER]
00:45:23,00:45:25,"Damn, pass."
00:45:25,00:45:26,Okay.
00:45:26,00:45:26,[LAUGHTER]
00:45:26,00:45:28,James is closest because he answered in the unit
00:45:28,00:45:30,that I was expecting people to answer in.
00:45:30,00:45:32,[LAUGHTER]
00:45:32,00:45:33,You say 10 million.
00:45:33,00:45:33,10 million.
00:45:33,00:45:36,19.2 million.
00:45:36,00:45:37,"19 million, 200,000."
00:45:37,00:45:39,That's a lot of magnitude.
00:45:39,00:45:41,"Yeah, I could be right, depending on him."
00:45:41,00:45:45,"We do need to check the math on rays first,"
00:45:45,00:45:46,before we award those to change.
00:45:46,00:45:47,It's a plankton.
00:45:47,00:45:49,"But they have to keep swimming forward as they eat,"
00:45:49,00:45:50,because they're a thing called
00:45:50,00:45:52,obligate ram ventilators.
00:45:52,00:45:55,"They can't go through them, and they take the air out of it."
00:45:55,00:45:56,"Exactly, yeah."
00:45:56,00:45:57,They have to keep--
00:45:57,00:45:58,So you've got to just--
00:45:58,00:45:59,Some ancient sharks will do this.
00:45:59,00:46:01,You just have to keep moving forwards otherwise you die.
00:46:01,00:46:02,Yeah.
00:46:02,00:46:02,It's quite cool.
00:46:02,00:46:03,I think that's quite a good--
00:46:03,00:46:04,It's quite a--
00:46:04,00:46:06,It's good metaphor for life.
00:46:06,00:46:06,Yeah.
00:46:06,00:46:07,If you stand still.
00:46:07,00:46:09,The reason I thought dolphins is they sleep
00:46:09,00:46:12,"half-brain at a time, so that they can still swim."
00:46:12,00:46:14,"I don't think that's to do with the breathing, though."
00:46:14,00:46:16,I think that might be more to hide from predators.
00:46:16,00:46:17,Yeah.
00:46:17,00:46:18,"Because dolphins have to surface, obviously."
00:46:18,00:46:20,But so how do you raise sleep?
00:46:20,00:46:22,Don't know.
00:46:22,00:46:23,Right?
00:46:23,00:46:25,[LAUGHTER]
00:46:25,00:46:28,"Can't comfortably, but after going through every social faux"
00:46:28,00:46:29,power I may think to you.
00:46:29,00:46:32,[LAUGHTER]
00:46:32,00:46:34,One quick thing on belly-flopping.
00:46:34,00:46:36,"Oh, yeah."
00:46:36,00:46:40,Have you ever heard the idea that if you belly-flop
00:46:40,00:46:43,"from a very high position, and then land on water,"
00:46:43,00:46:45,it's just as bad as landing on concrete?
00:46:45,00:46:46,I haven't heard it yet.
00:46:46,00:46:46,"Yeah, yeah."
00:46:46,00:46:48,Do you think it's true?
00:46:48,00:46:50,"Oh, well, thank you."
00:46:50,00:46:51,I can-- yes.
00:46:51,00:46:55,I keep seeing videos now of people diving
00:46:55,00:46:57,"from very high heights in a belly-flop position,"
00:46:57,00:47:00,and landing in the kind of--
00:47:00,00:47:01,So you think no?
00:47:01,00:47:02,I think no.
00:47:02,00:47:05,"And I know this room, I suppose you'd say that."
00:47:05,00:47:07,"If you throw something before you land,"
00:47:07,00:47:09,it breaks the tension of the water.
00:47:09,00:47:11,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's true."
00:47:11,00:47:14,"My feeling as the answer is no, but it still hurts a lot."
00:47:14,00:47:15,I think that's fair.
00:47:15,00:47:17,I think that's probably right.
00:47:17,00:47:19,"Mythbusters, our friends at Mythbusters,"
00:47:19,00:47:23,they did some tests and threw two big pig carcasses
00:47:23,00:47:25,out of a helicopter.
00:47:25,00:47:28,"And they x-rayed it, and they found that the pavement drop"
00:47:28,00:47:31,"resulted in 17 fractures, a shattered pelvis,"
00:47:31,00:47:35,"and a decapitation, while the water drop yielded seven"
00:47:35,00:47:37,fractures and a broken neck.
00:47:37,00:47:38,"Oh, yes."
00:47:38,00:47:40,"So neither of them's good for you, but definitely"
00:47:40,00:48:00,hitting the pavement is more of an impact.
00:48:00,00:48:04,"One last thing from me, January 15th, 1990,"
00:48:04,00:48:07,Lottie Stevens was out on a boat in New Caledonia
00:48:07,00:48:09,when his boat capsized.
00:48:09,00:48:14,"And according to the story, as reported by Radio Vanuatu,"
00:48:14,00:48:19,he was drifting for four days before a giant stingray came
00:48:19,00:48:22,and gave him a ride back to land.
00:48:22,00:48:23,Yeah.
00:48:23,00:48:24,What's going on?
00:48:24,00:48:26,"They're living some avatars, right there."
00:48:26,00:48:29,"Ray, you're not the face of Vanuatu at the moment."
00:48:29,00:48:30,"Yeah, I have the face of Vanuatu."
00:48:30,00:48:31,What do you mean?
00:48:31,00:48:33,Because I found this guy floating at sea.
00:48:33,00:48:38,[LAUGHTER]
00:48:38,00:48:40,Are you really connected to Vanuatu?
00:48:40,00:48:44,"Yeah, I did have tourism campaign for Vanuatu last year."
00:48:44,00:48:47,"You could meet Lottie Stevens, because I'd love to know more."
00:48:47,00:48:53,The stingray carried him for 450 miles back to shore.
00:48:53,00:48:58,It took 13 days of being carried on the back of the stingray
00:48:58,00:48:59,before they got home.
00:48:59,00:49:01,This is so wonderful.
00:49:01,00:49:04,We didn't emphasize that part of the tourism campaign.
00:49:04,00:49:06,"You're swimming out as far as you like, don't you?"
00:49:06,00:49:09,[LAUGHTER]
00:49:09,00:49:11,There's stuff out there that'll bring you back.
00:49:11,00:49:12,She'll bring me back.
00:49:12,00:49:14,[LAUGHTER]
