00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,640
 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Things A Fish, where we were

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:10,860
 joined by our good friend, the New Zealand comedian Ray O'Leary. Now we've known Ray

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:15,280
 for a long time now. He is such a good friend. It's so good to get him on the main

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,840
 podcast. You might remember he did the Edinburgh Showcase that we did as was

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,240
 the end of last year, but he is on the full show today and I'm absolutely

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,920
 certain you're gonna love it because oh my gosh we have such a good time doing

7
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,760
 this show. Once you have finished listening to it then I reckon you're gonna

8
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,240
 want to go and buy tickets to see his show. His stand-up is really where he

9
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,320
 absolutely thrives. He's got a brilliant delivery and his jokes are so funny.

10
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,000
 Of all the people I went to see last year, definitely he's my favourite. And so

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,240
 if you are listening to this, when the show goes out and you are in Edinburgh,

12
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,440
 Newcastle Glasgow, Norwich, Southampton, Edinburgh,

13
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:57,680
 Leeds Liverpool Birmingham, London, Bristol or Sheffield, then go to the internet

14
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,160
 and search for Ray O'Leary. If you go to his Instagram then you will find details

15
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,560
 for tickets in his bio. Oh you could just search Google for Ray O'Leary tickets and

16
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,640
 you'll find them there and I highly recommend it. If you'd like to listen to the

17
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,760
 Excel version of this show where we find out what Dan has in common with

18
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,920
 Jean-Jacques Russo and believe me you didn't want it in the normal version but

19
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,200
 big fans of Dan are going to want to hear it and go to patreon.com/nosythingsaffish

20
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,360
 and there is all sorts of stuff there, not just Excel shows but merch and

21
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,240
 all sorts of bonus material or just a place to sign up and learn more about fish.

22
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:39,520
 Anyway, let's get on with it. This week's show with Ray O'Leary on with the podcast.

23
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:59,280
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

24
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:05,200
 from the QI offices in Hobern. My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,

25
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,240
 James Harkin and Ray O'Leary and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our

26
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:16,880
 four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go. Starting with

27
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:25,680
 fact number one and that is Ray. My fact this week is that a 30-second lullaby written in 1963 has made

28
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:32,080
 more than $70 million in royalties. That lullaby is killing in the name of my rage.

29
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:40,720
 Some that l always go to bed and that lullaby.

30
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:47,600
 Okay, that's a lot of royalties. The reason it's made so much money is because it's become

31
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:53,280
 a theme song for a TV show. It's become a theme song for the American quiz show Gipady

32
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:59,040
 because the song was written by the creator of the show who I guess needed a theme song.

33
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:05,600
 It got himself to do it and now paid himself $70 million. He got paid every time it was on.

34
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:11,680
 Yes, every time it was on and the show is like 230 episodes a year or something and he gets paid

35
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,960
 every time. syndicated globally as well and there's all the different UK and other countries.

36
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:22,800
 Stephen Fry hosts the UK and Australian ones. The thing is about this lullaby is as far as I'm

37
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,680
 concerned it's exactly the same as another lullaby which is I'm a little teapot.

38
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:34,720
 Oh really? So one that goes tip me over, pull me out.

39
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,520
 To me, I've always heard it and I honestly always thought they must have just used

40
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:44,400
 I'm a little teapot because it was out of copyright. But actually he claimed to have written it.

41
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,800
 Well, I would say that I'm a little teapot is not a lullaby. I certainly wouldn't think

42
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,960
 that to a child I was trying to get to sleep. I think that's more of a high-pup fight song

43
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:58,480
 that kind of thing. What does it? It was the eight-mile of its day.

44
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,720
 But actually, I mean, there were movements involved when you want a child to sleep.

45
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,360
 You don't want them doing movement. Yeah. But that was written by a couple of school teachers.

46
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,640
 Really? I think it was in like the 30s or 40s. So in theory, it would have been in copyright

47
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,800
 when he and this guy who was called, what was he called? Merv Griffin.

48
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:20,960
 Merv Griffin. When Merv Griffin wrote his in theory they could have sued him but I think

49
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:24,880
 because they were just school teachers, they weren't like, you know. I didn't know that.

50
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:30,400
 Was it Merv Griffin? He not only created Jeopardy, he created Willa Fortune. He was also the host

51
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,120
 of a lot of TV shows. He was in movies. He was a sort of business empire onto himself.

52
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:42,480
 And he was like the rich at Usman of America. Yeah, he was. But I do have a bone to pick with old Merv.

53
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:48,400
 Oh, yeah. Of course. Yeah, he says creator of Jeopardy. He absolutely was not. It was his wife.

54
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:54,000
 Oh, yeah. His wife, Julian Wright. She was sitting on an airplane and this is in interviews with

55
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,320
 Merv Griffin where he says, and this will explain the format of Jeopardy in case anyone's not really

56
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,360
 seeing it. His wife was mulling over a game show ideas and said there's not enough successful question

57
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,400
 and answer shows. Those used to be big. They weren't really on TV. And then she said, what happens

58
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:14,000
 if you swap the answer in question in the format? So what if you were given the answer and you had

59
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,680
 to come up with the question. So the question is, how does it work, right? You're a fan, right? Yeah,

60
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,800
 yeah. So what you get given is I think it's called sometimes the clue, but it's meant to be in the

61
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:31,600
 phrase of an answer. So it'll be this city is the biggest in the UK and home to 9 million people

62
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:39,680
 or something like that. And then you would say, what is Western Superman? I do not know enough about

63
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:49,040
 British geography. What is London? The examples she gave on the plane was she said 5,280. The question

64
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:55,040
 was, how many feet are in a mile? She also said 79 Whistful Vista. The answer was, is that where

65
00:05:55,040 --> 00:06:00,880
 Fibre and Molly McGee live? And that was just friends of theirs. Oh, that's a tricky one. There doesn't

66
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:05,920
 talk about that. I think the thing is though with Jeopardy is like those kind of things wouldn't

67
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:10,960
 quite work. Because if you say the number of feet in a mile, there's a number of different questions

68
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:17,200
 that could be in that answer. Whereas if it's a clue rather than an answer. So it has to be, you can't

69
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:22,400
 say these are weird sea things. And I say, what are oysters? Because there are loads of weird

70
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,160
 things. It could be a colour hug. Exactly. Okay. Okay. Because I've always found it incredibly

71
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,800
 confusing. I've never seen an episode. I've always found the idea quite baffling. And also if you don't

72
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:36,880
 say what is or who is or whatever, you don't get the point. Give me a break. Give me a break.

73
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,160
 It's got to be real. What is the slogan for Kit Kat?

74
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:49,280
 Close enough. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Do they have this show in New Zealand?

75
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:54,720
 No, I illegally watch it on YouTube every day. Don't tell anyone. My profession is, but yeah,

76
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,200
 I find it fascinating. And also you'll write about what move Griffin said about how he came up with

77
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:04,080
 the show. Well, I was just sitting there, my wife had a nightmare. The shame of being single,

78
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:12,800
 I'm half as efficient, you know. Well, he was like a big deal. And he was an actor. And I think he

79
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:18,960
 was friends with Doris Day, who might have discovered him. I think he was working in a nightclub

80
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,680
 and Doris Day walked past and said, why do you should do a screen test for Warner Brothers for who

81
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:30,080
 I'm working. And he did that and he got put in a couple of movies. And I think he probably thought he

82
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:36,160
 was going to be Doris Day's leading man because they were such good friends, but he was very short.

83
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:41,040
 He could have been like her love interest who eventually loses the girl, but he was never going

84
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:46,240
 to be a leading man really. So he thought he was going into either the hot met, but he was assigned

85
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:56,000
 with like a hunchback number two. He was a poor bearer at Ronald Reagan's funeral. Maybe through

86
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,840
 acting connections, I don't know, or maybe after he became a very big deal. No, you're right.

87
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:07,680
 Unless they all were. Yeah, I don't know. And he's the man behind the soul. I've got a lovely bunch

88
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:13,280
 of coconut. He was the original singer of the one who made it the big song that it became.

89
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,920
 Yeah, that's crazy. Yeah, so not behind it. Sorry, the one of the the singers who made it big.

90
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:22,320
 And the other thing about him, just last thing on him personally that I found fascinating was

91
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:28,720
 he also created, as you said, I think James wheel of fortune to another incredibly big game show.

92
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:34,160
 And of course, we know that the theme tune for that show was written by Alan Thickey,

93
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:38,960
 father of Robin Thickey. I've read the podcast. I've read the podcast. I've got that. Yes.

94
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:46,000
 Do you know Robin Thickey? I know Robin Thickey. Oh, yes, it's no common miscurses.

95
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,320
 On this podcast, he will always be Robin Thickey. He gets furious people mispronounce his name.

96
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:58,000
 Robin, because it makes him sound thick if you call him Robin Thickey. He's very clever, man.

97
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:05,120
 He also had a chat show, very famously, Murf. He interviewed an estimated 25,000 people.

98
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:10,960
 And he said that his best interview was with Austin Wells, because Austin Wells was very guided

99
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:16,480
 individual. He didn't really say anything about his personal life. But just before the show,

100
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,960
 Austin Wells said, you know, these wonderful gossipy things that you've always wanted to ask about

101
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:26,960
 my past. And Murf says, yeah, yeah, but I'm not allowed to ask those. Am I? And Austin Wells says,

102
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:31,760
 well, tonight you are, I'm feeling very expansive. And he did the interview and he asked him all these

103
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:36,880
 questions that he wouldn't answer in the past. And Austin Wells went home and died two hours later.

104
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:43,840
 So his like, this is my last chance to get it out. Wow. Holy moly. But he did, yeah, he died of natural

105
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:55,360
 causes as a person. Murf and Murf. We mentioned Wheeler Fortune earlier. There is a person

106
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:01,680
 on that show called Vanna White, who has a Guinness World Record. Okay. Can you guess what it is?

107
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:09,760
 Vanna White. What was Vanna White? Vanna White was a, she was quite a glamorous lady, glamorous

108
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:16,080
 assistant. Oh, it was something like most air was on TV. Okay. So she is the person who turns the

109
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:22,320
 answers around because Wheeler Fortune is like Hangman, right? So you've got a word there and you say,

110
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,480
 can I have an X? Yes, you can. And they'll turn the X. Oh, but there might not be that letter there.

111
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,400
 It is not in the phrase you understand. I can tell you. So it's this person's job, but she now has a

112
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:41,200
 World Record. And she's done something 3,721,446 times as of the night of February 2015.

113
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,320
 Was it touching letters? Well, records, touching letters.

114
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,680
 Because, hey, Santa's got that record. Have you done that?

115
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:59,840
 Has she collapsed? Correct. Yeah. So whenever they get one of the letters, right,

116
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:04,400
 she turns it round as she claps. That's always counted the claps. Wow, with some of those

117
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:15,200
 and she appeared in all but 10 of the 6151 episodes up until Guinness made this record.

118
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:20,720
 And she clapped in all of them and she had a World Record. And the reason that they had a hostess

119
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,840
 on their atoll is because they did, they were going to motorise the board, which is what you would do.

120
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:31,360
 It's like, can I have an L? And the L just turns round. But they couldn't finish making the motor.

121
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,000
 And so they had to hire someone to actually turn the pictures.

122
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,360
 Just on computers doing this kind of stuff. So,

123
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,560
 Japanese famously faced Watson in 2011. Super computer.

124
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:48,240
 Yeah. Yeah. And Watson won beat two humans who were playing alongside it.

125
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,520
 It's a three-player game. And one of them was like the best.

126
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:57,680
 They were both the top champions. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter, who I think both

127
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:02,640
 hold records in the Jupiter universe. Really? I didn't know there was a Japanese universe.

128
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:12,800
 The JCU. Never checked it out. There's a website called J Archive. And it's a fan-made website.

129
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:18,000
 And it's a record of every question ever asked. How much dollar values were waged and whatnot? Who won?

130
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,960
 Pitches of the people who played. Every like word that was said on an episode, all categorized there.

131
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:26,880
 And Alex Trebek, one of the longtime hosts of the show, found out about it.

132
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,680
 And he said, "Come on people, get a life."

133
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:34,160
 What is the pay signal on the P2?

134
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:45,760
 Okay, it is time for fact number two. And that is my fact.

135
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:52,000
 My fact this week is that every year in Japan, thousands of receptionists apply to compete against

136
00:12:52,000 --> 00:13:02,320
 each other in the all-Japan phone answering championship. This is amazing. This is a competition

137
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:10,000
 exclusively for office workers, mostly receptionists. And every year, literally thousands and thousands

138
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:16,640
 apply so that they could go to a competition where they sit on stage and they are judged on how well

139
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:22,080
 they receive a phone call and deal with questions. And it lasts three minutes long for each of them.

140
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:27,360
 And then they hang up. And then a decision is made on how great they performed. And they're given

141
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:33,840
 things like a problem. It's called each year. A new problem is created. And they are given

142
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:39,200
 the same problem for all competitors. Yeah, it is. But you would not be able to you must be kept away

143
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:43,600
 from otherwise you see what the problem is. I think they tell you before you go on because there's

144
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:53,040
 like, so the 2025 one was for a theoretical beef tongue restaurant in Sendai City, which has the

145
00:13:53,040 --> 00:14:00,160
 slogan, "Bringing smiles to customers faces through beef tongue." And basically, you get all the

146
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,800
 menus and all the different places it could deliver beef tugs to. And then someone will reg up, go,

147
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:10,000
 excuse me, do you have any pork tugs? Do you have to like answer that? I'm a vegetarian. What do you

148
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,040
 have for me? And you're told what's going to be asked as well? You're told the problem. So there's

149
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:20,880
 no, there's no plot twists or anything like that. You're even given a role in their 2025 one. You are

150
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:26,640
 Yun Katakura. You are an employee responsible for operating the online shop and handling inquiries

151
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:34,480
 about beef tongue. But you have to do it with a straight face. I think it's like a lot of it's like

152
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:40,400
 how polite you are. It's how clear you are. It sounds like there's a lot of quite formal etiquette

153
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:45,680
 as well. And in terms of how you answer the phone, you're meant to answer on the first or the second

154
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:50,160
 ring. If you only get to it on the third ring, that's an apology straight away. If you pick it up

155
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:55,520
 straight away and you're too keen on the beef tongue. I think it's very precise. If you're in a

156
00:14:55,520 --> 00:15:01,600
 phone answering competition, you're waiting for the third ring. That's crazy. That's the bad boy.

157
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:11,440
 I think you're talking general Japanese etiquettes. Apparently it's judged out of 100 points.

158
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,480
 I got this from a translation of a site that talks about the 2025 competition. So yeah,

159
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:21,520
 it's judged on six different criteria. First impression. So you're the first line that you say.

160
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:26,480
 Hello. Did you deal with that? Criterion number two, basic call handling skills, which is 20 points,

161
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:32,320
 voice volume, speaking speed, natural intonation, clear voice production and pronunciation. That's

162
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:38,000
 what that one is. Oh, well, it's important. Yeah. Then there's communication skills. There's provision

163
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:45,440
 of information and service. Final impression. Bye. Let's just let's just try it. Let's just try

164
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:53,680
 with you. Yes. Ringling. Hello. Sorry. That was a bit quick. It's keen. And also in Japan, they don't say

165
00:15:53,680 --> 00:16:01,840
 hello. We need you to do the full voice. In Japan, you answer the phone, mochi-mochi. Of course.

166
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:12,880
 And do you know why that is? It's because they speak Japanese. Well, that is undoubtedly true,

167
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:20,480
 but it doesn't mean hello. It means it's short for a moushi again, muscle, which means I am going to

168
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:26,000
 talk. And it's because in polite Japanese society, especially if you're speaking to someone who is

169
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,800
 more important than you, you wouldn't say hello. You had to announce the fact that you want to talk

170
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:37,040
 before you do, which is tough because then you are talking. So usually we say mochi-mochi before you say

171
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:42,640
 mochi-mochi. Can I ask you a question? It's the can I ask you a question in Japanese?

172
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:47,840
 I'm asking a question. No, no, exactly. But there's another theory, according to a folklorist

173
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:56,000
 called Uekasal. Apparently, mochi-mochi is impossible to say if you are a magic fox.

174
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:06,880
 The life of the magic fox just gets harder and harder. There's a thing called the backimono fox,

175
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:13,040
 and this fox is like a trickster in folklore. And one thing that it does is it can learn to speak like

176
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:19,600
 and imitate a human, but it can say lots of the words, but it can't say mochi-mochi. And so according

177
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:24,080
 to this folklorist, one of the reasons people say mochi-mochi is because then if they say that,

178
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:30,480
 they know that you're not a magic fox. Shibulath, right? Shibulath. Yeah, exactly. And as a result,

179
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:37,520
 magic fox crime stats are down way down. Especially when it comes to like fishing, like trying

180
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:43,120
 to get your bank details on the phone. They just don't do it. A lot of younger Japanese people,

181
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,400
 and I think this is a global thing as well, I'm becoming more nervous about answering the phone.

182
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:53,520
 This is a thing. There's a study in the UK that found that a quarter of people aged 18 to 34

183
00:17:53,520 --> 00:18:00,240
 never answer the phone. I would never answer the phone. Really? I don't. I do. I like it.

184
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:06,800
 I spend the wheel. Who's this? Yeah, but it's always some spam, isn't it?

185
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:13,440
 It's often someone with a really good offer for me actually. And that's why Andy's living in the

186
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:23,120
 basement of this building. Another magic fox got me. But there's this other thing that is

187
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,960
 happening now, especially when younger people aren't answering the phone, they'll answer it,

188
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,040
 but they won't say anything because they're waiting for it. I did that as well. Do you?

189
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:36,960
 Because you can kind of hear the click. And also what happens often is they won't say anything.

190
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:43,120
 And then as soon as you talk, then the automatic voice comes in and it says, hello, I've got a great

191
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:56,800
 deal for you. 50,000 kilos of beef tock. Yes. Yes. Yes. Have you guys experienced this other thing?

192
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:02,720
 And this has only been recently launched. Yelp, the sort of phone people, the company launched

193
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,880
 this thing recently. You can have a proper conversation with an AI voice that answers your phone.

194
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:16,960
 So I'm in the process of I'm getting my hob removed. And sorry. I'm trying to have my hob ripped out

195
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:23,440
 at the moment. I can't believe you should have to work today. That's why you're on a limping up the

196
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:29,840
 system. And I phoned up this company trying to get a quote. And I had a whole conversation with a

197
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:36,080
 robot that was doing a quote for me, like saying what's the size of it and what shape it is. But as

198
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:42,000
 in I had a proper yeah, I found it very upsetting and horrible. Sometimes I that's how I feel when we're

199
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:51,760
 doing this podcast. You know that you're not talking to a proper intelligence. But yeah,

200
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:57,200
 could you tell it was an AI? I could have good intonations, good production of speech, good whatever

201
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,200
 that. Well, it did. But weirdly, I could tell. Oh, yeah. I said, it sounded like a person, but there

202
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,600
 was just a slight sort of filter over the whole call that maybe realized it was a machine talking.

203
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:11,200
 It's really weird because the final criteria, the sixth criteria of this whole thing is actually

204
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:16,720
 sort of an overall evaluation. So it sort of almost doesn't matter what happened between one

205
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,400
 and five. They could have given you high marks. But then they're like, now that I think about it,

206
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:25,840
 I wasn't so much impressed with these certain moments. And you can get points for it even if you

207
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,760
 didn't get anything resolved in the call, but it sounded like a nice chat. You get points for that.

208
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:36,400
 You can also get points for excellent silence. Just for like, wow, you were brilliant with the

209
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:48,640
 silence there. Yeah. Points for everyone. I looked it up and I think it was the 2015 winner.

210
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:55,440
 Was a was a was a she practiced to win this competition. She practiced for three minute conversations

211
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:02,320
 for two hours a day over a period of four months. Wow. That's a very patient partner.

212
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:09,040
 That's amazing. Well, it's it is thousands who apply, but it's only about 60 to 80 that make it to

213
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:14,640
 the actual stage. I guess is there an audience? Is there a big audience apart from the judges?

214
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,960
 I've seen a video, but I've only seen it off the stage. I couldn't quite tell because it's the

215
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:23,920
 show is 60 to 80 people doing the same three minute conversation. I can imagine that wouldn't be very

216
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:29,040
 varied, basically. Yeah. I did read that one of the recent winners answered the phone and conducted

217
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:34,000
 the conversation in a very traditional and formal style, which is what got to the points with the

218
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,560
 judges, although you wouldn't maybe naturally have a conversation like that. If you were answering

219
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:43,040
 the phone and in a normal Japanese business, basically, they're all sorts of, apparently there are

220
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:49,360
 at least 60 books in Japan available exclusively on phone etiquette. It's a real thing. Yeah. Yeah.

221
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,360
 Obviously, it's a country with a huge amount of etiquette in all sorts of areas, but yeah,

222
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:59,520
 it's fascinating. General reception. I was trying to find out some more things about general

223
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:04,880
 receptionists and receptionism. Okay. Got it. Okay. Most successful receptionist of all time.

224
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:15,200
 Okay. Good question. Is it the receptionist from the apprentice TV show in the UK who literally,

225
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,680
 well, they they have this whole pretence of them being in the ballroom and you're fired and stuff,

226
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:24,240
 and then they go out and then supposedly Alan Sugar decides what's going to happen. And then

227
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,720
 they cut to someone who doesn't even seem to be in the same building, picking up a phone and going,

228
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:33,120
 yes, Lord Sugar, I'll send them in now and then put it and then they cut to the ballroom and they're

229
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:40,960
 all ed. So that just feels like like a good job. Yeah. That's really good. No, the queen.

230
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:47,280
 Choose a receptionist. Oh, the current queen consort. Oh, come on, come on, come on, stop that.

231
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:51,840
 This is started out as a receptionist. I mean, it's a natural career progression, isn't it?

232
00:22:51,840 --> 00:23:01,920
 I'll be promoted. You're made queen. Did she? Yeah. Obviously, a very posh company in their

233
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:06,800
 reception and I think she was sacked for turning up late. But I found out, interesting fact, Charles

234
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:14,480
 and Camilla had the same gynecologist when they were born. Charles had a gynecologist. I

235
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:20,640
 suppose Charles and Camilla's mothers were both assisted by the same. Charles has no gynecologist.

236
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:33,040
 He had his hub removed it. Oh my gosh. Here is an accidental receptionist. In

237
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:40,240
 Reykjavik in 2015, there was a security guard in the Prime Minister's office who went away from

238
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,720
 the office for the day, but normally what you do is you put your mobile phone number into the

239
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:49,520
 system and then if anyone phones the Prime Minister, then it would come through to you and you can

240
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:55,680
 sort of take messages and whatever. Anyway, someone put the wrong number in and a woman who lived in

241
00:23:55,680 --> 00:24:04,400
 Reykjavik to start getting phone calls for the Prime Minister of Iceland. That's such a prank.

242
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:11,280
 If you can arrange that for someone, that is amazing. What happened? What did you do? Nothing. It was

243
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:15,760
 just for like one day or so until they all came back in the office and she said it's been no bother.

244
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:23,200
 This is Inge Björg Sigurvins.ir. It's been no bother. I am a citizen of this country and I am ready

245
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:29,680
 to help. But it should be like pageant. Pouching through calls from world leaders and things.

246
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:36,000
 I really like this, which is ELO Electric Light Orchestra. It's one of my favorite bands. So

247
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,160
 their debut album came out in 1971. It's called Electric Light Orchestra, out here in the UK.

248
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:47,040
 Released in America in March of 1972 with the title No Answer. And that's because the record

249
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:51,760
 exec in America said to someone in the office, "Can you call England and find out what the debut

250
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:57,280
 album is called?" They called. No one picked up. They wrote in the notes, no answer. The execs

251
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:03,440
 all had. And thought, "Great title." And that became the title of the album. It was just self-titled.

252
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:15,200
 ELO. Is that because someone rang up the office and they went, "Ello"?

253
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,880
 Okay, it is time for fact number three. And that is James.

254
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:24,720
 Okay, my fact this week is that philosopher Jean Jacques Rousseau, one of the most important figures

255
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:32,240
 of the Enlightenment, father of European political thought, and one of the inspirations behind

256
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:37,440
 the French Revolution, would run around Paris with his bum out hoping someone would spank him.

257
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:45,600
 Did that start the French Revolution? We have to stop this guy. Off with his bum.

258
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:54,400
 So yeah, Jean Jacques Rousseau, unbelievably famous in his time, one of the most important

259
00:25:54,400 --> 00:26:00,640
 thinkers of the age. And it turned out that he had a pretty difficult childhood and it stuck him

260
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:06,240
 with some fetishes. And one of them was that he loved being spanked. And just before he died,

261
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:12,160
 he had a book called Confessions, which was very autobiographical, but it was like it was

262
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:18,560
 what's an all. And he said that he would go around Paris, winning the Mahous style, hoping that

263
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:22,640
 someone would spank him. And then what happened was sometimes he got the ship beat out of him.

264
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:28,000
 Did he? Yeah, like a group of people who didn't think much of that kind of thing would grab

265
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,240
 hold of him and start kicking him, and he'd have to escape? I think that's fair. Yeah.

266
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:39,120
 He was hanging around in alleys, hoping for, I presume, what would be quite a rare result

267
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:43,040
 with someone to administer a spanking. I mean, it sort of... I'd be in a publisher right here and now.

268
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:49,680
 It feels like a behaviour that would be looked down upon these days. Yeah, you probably couldn't

269
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:56,720
 even do that anymore, because of Woke. It does feel like famous philosopher pervert, which is a

270
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:05,200
 smaller headline, but it's striking that he confessed it. Yeah. His confessions were really sort of like,

271
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:11,200
 I'm going to admit everything now. Yeah. But his confessions, he wrote what is largely

272
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:17,280
 seen as the first autobiography. It's often said to be the first autobiography, and he would go

273
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:21,920
 around to parties and he would read extracts of his confessions. So he titled it Confessions,

274
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:28,400
 I believe. Confessions of a smack addict. I think that was the... Yeah. It's so funny that he

275
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:33,840
 was moaning people in alleyway. Do you think they looked down in alleyways? Inside that alleyway,

276
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:46,560
 is there a smaller, narrower alleyway? Oh, my God. But yes, he did publish the first,

277
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:50,800
 what is considered the first autobiography, the Confessions, and he discussed some of his least

278
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:57,200
 glamorous moments, which included that he abandoned five of his children, and that he once stole a

279
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:04,240
 ribbon. So those two were sort of on equal to... Yeah. But the ribbon that he did, I think, accuse

280
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:10,000
 he said that it made in another serve and had stolen and given it to him, and that's how he came across

281
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,760
 it. He was... He's an interesting cookie, isn't he? He's kind of... Because a lot of... Right, just for

282
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:20,640
 context, this is what Dan says about some of the worst people you've ever heard of. He was a character.

283
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:28,000
 He was a character. Because he... Check the ripper, a little strong cookie. He's Marmite. He's Marmite.

284
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:40,640
 So he was from Geneva, and his father was also from Geneva, but he had this sort of idea that he

285
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:46,880
 was from some incredible Patricia family, very important he felt he was. He was a watchmaker,

286
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:53,840
 but he married above his station, and he thought he was so up a class that he always brandished a

287
00:28:53,840 --> 00:29:00,800
 sword wherever he went. That was not allowed in Geneva at the time. Okay. So he got kicked out of Geneva,

288
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:06,480
 and the whole family got kicked out. Oh gosh. And eventually Rousseau was sent to live with a

289
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:13,200
 Calvinist minister and his daughter, and it was the daughter, Mamoiselle Lambertier, who used to

290
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:18,080
 treat him like he was her child, and she would spank him when he'd done something naughty. And then in

291
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:24,000
 the end, he would just do things naughty deliberately so that he got spanked. Yeah. And that's how he ended

292
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:30,800
 up with this. It's so... Because his most famous quote is, "Man is born free, but everywhere he is in

293
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:36,400
 chains." And I assume that chains would be to be bad, but now maybe he was quite a good way,

294
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:41,840
 but everywhere he is in chains and hopefully a whirlpool. Man has been a very, very naughty boy.

295
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:49,680
 He also believed that there was this idea of the natural man, and that civilization was actually a

296
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:54,400
 complete con job that made everyone miserable. I mean it was a very... We would all be really happy if

297
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:58,480
 we were just left to live our own lives, and we wouldn't have to go to work every day and go on the

298
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:04,560
 tube. Yeah. But basically he just thought anything that was an invention of modern society was bad.

299
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:08,960
 And that's why he thought... And so it's really weird that he was a great writer about childhood

300
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:14,000
 considering that he abandoned all of his children to an orphanage, but he kind of overturned a

301
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:19,280
 previous very prevailing view that children are naturally evil and naturally fallen, you know,

302
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:24,160
 born with original sin. He was saying no children are naturally wonderful and should just be left

303
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:31,920
 alone, which is not a recipe for good adults. So, you read a lot about philosophers, because he had

304
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:36,400
 a particular interest of yours. Yes, a little bit, a little bit. We didn't get him as much,

305
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:40,080
 and so this was interesting reading up on him. Did you rate him as a philosopher?

306
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:46,720
 Yeah, no, yes, definitely. The influence he's had is crazy, and his development on the social

307
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:51,840
 contract theory and his ideas about democracy. I mean it almost seems quite now looking back at a guy

308
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:57,200
 who's writing him, "I think democracy would be a good idea." But at the time it was like divine

309
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:03,440
 writer kings, this idea that the government didn't have to be responsible to its people. So he was

310
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:08,960
 groundbreaking, I think, for the time, for sure. But I didn't realise just how crazy his life was.

311
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:14,480
 I learned that his mother, Suzanne, she had to go to a church hearing, I think they had sort of

312
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:20,560
 a religious, I don't know, police or system in Geneva at the time. And she had to go to a church

313
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:27,440
 hearing for going to the street theatre disguised as a peasant woman, so she could gaze upon

314
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:35,280
 invents and caress in whom she fancied despite him being married. It apparently theater was illegal

315
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:41,200
 at the time. So the Geneva non-Calvinists shared to account for herself. He didn't know that.

316
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:47,360
 He didn't like theatre either, Jean-Jacques. So Volta introduced a theatre to Geneva,

317
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:51,360
 at which point Rousseau wrote to him, "You have ruined Geneva. I hate you."

318
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,960
 He once pissed in his neighbour's kettle.

319
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,320
 Did he?

320
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,960
 Yeah, that's in his confessions. I don't know if he wrote that out.

321
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:05,760
 My turn, his neighbour picks up the box, goes to the index in the back, looks like it would have been mentioned.

322
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,560
 That's nice.

323
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,320
 Flocking his cup of tea.

324
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:21,600
 He didn't like gender equality. He was very much of the idea that men are in charge and women are not.

325
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:28,000
 And there was another philosopher called Olymp de Gouge, who was a French activist and playwright.

326
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,360
 And she really liked Rousseau's philosophy in general, but she really critiqued his idea that women

327
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:39,920
 shouldn't have as much role in society. And she said, "If a woman has a right to mount the scaffold,

328
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:43,440
 she must equally have the right to mount the speaker's platform."

329
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,040
 And then two years later, she was executed.

330
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,280
 So, for inter-revolution?

331
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,040
 In the reign of Tera.

332
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:57,120
 Oh, yeah, for just for political writings, which was a little bit frowned upon at the time.

333
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:01,360
 Mary Wollstonecraft as well, all sort of vindication of the rights of a woman.

334
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:07,280
 She and Mary Shelley's mum, and she and he had big beef, because again, all part of his,

335
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:12,080
 I think his theory that the natural is perfect. He then wrote, "Oh, well, actually, you know,

336
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:17,520
 it's women's nature to give care, and that's therefore all they should be taught to do."

337
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:22,480
 It was a very aggressive theory, even at the time, and Wollstonecraft argued back pretty stiffly.

338
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:26,800
 But Rousseau inspired the journey that produced Frankenstein.

339
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,200
 Really?

340
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:31,600
 Yeah, so you know, Mary Shelley and Byron and Percy Shelley went to Lake Geneva.

341
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,960
 They went to Lake Geneva in 1816.

342
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,960
 They were following in the footsteps of one of his novels, which was called "Juley",

343
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,000
 and it sat at the east end of Lake Geneva, and they were going on a bit of,

344
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 I don't know what the term is, where you said, "Well, you said really well. Yeah, come on."

345
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,880
 They were following that, and so that's why they ended up there.

346
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,680
 Oh, cool.

347
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,520
 I didn't know that. That's fantastic.

348
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:57,600
 Rousseau's dad back to being a watchmaker. He said, "Just a random burn from his father,

349
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:02,880
 Mr. Rousseau said, "A Geneva watchmaker is a man who can be introduced anywhere.

350
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,240
 A perisian watchmaker is only fit to talk about watches."

351
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:10,720
 So this has a hard-core burn amongst the watchmaking community,

352
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:13,200
 1700s, Geneva.

353
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:19,120
 I've never, I wouldn't associate France with watchmaking, probably for that reason, right?

354
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,680
 Swiss watchmaking, of course.

355
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:22,320
 Yes.

356
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,080
 A French cuckoo clockmaker is only fit to talk about cuckoo clocks.

357
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,320
 Swiss cuckoo clockmaker.

358
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,560
 French tubular omega.

359
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:34,000
 (Laughter)

360
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:44,560
 Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show, and that is Andy.

361
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:48,720
 My fact is, "Rays Flirt" by Belly Flopping.

362
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,080
 I told you they're in confidence.

363
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:53,200
 (Laughter)

364
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,240
 Like a mantra, right?

365
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,200
 Like a mantra, right?

366
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:58,880
 They're all sorts of, I think they're 11 different species of

367
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:04,880
 modular ray, which are the great big diamond-shaped rays that you get

368
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,240
 with a mouth at one end and a tail at the other and two enormous lovely wings in between.

369
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:15,360
 And some of the species, specifically monk's devil ray, but I think a few of them do it,

370
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:19,040
 they do these incredible ballet displays out of the water.

371
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:23,360
 They gather in big groups and then they just launch themselves out and they go about two meters

372
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:26,560
 into the air. And these are huge animals as well, like they're big.

373
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,800
 And they land with this great big splash and they do it for hours at a time.

374
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:36,480
 And while I say flirt, scientists are reasonably confident it's communication.

375
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:41,520
 And it might be a way of luring more rays to your ray mating event.

376
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,440
 Okay, I'm sorry, Ray.

377
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,320
 Is that what you call it, Ray?

378
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,840
 (Laughter)

379
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:48,720
 It's often quite a solo, I don't know if these guys are.

380
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,600
 What do they have in the night?

381
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:52,400
 (Laughter)

382
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,000
 There are hundreds of them in there.

383
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:54,800
 I'm sorry.

384
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:59,680
 (Laughter)

385
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:03,360
 So it might be flirting, basically, it might be hunting, but it seems to be communicating.

386
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,320
 They're not sure.

387
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,600
 The mating habits of rays come on.

388
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,560
 Come on.

389
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,920
 Have you heard of the man-to-train?

390
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,160
 No.

391
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,240
 This is man-to-rays.

392
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,160
 There's a real replacement man-to-bus.

393
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,120
 I'm afraid today.

394
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:20,960
 (Laughter)

395
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:26,240
 This is a way of courting that happens amongst man-to-rays where a female will swim up front

396
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:30,880
 and she'll be followed by a train of male man-to-swimming behind her.

397
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:31,840
 Like a conger?

398
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,280
 Yeah, exactly like a conger.

399
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,440
 And it's called it the conger reel.

400
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,640
 That would have been a clever...

401
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,480
 Yes, it would have been confusing.

402
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,240
 It would have been very confusing, yeah.

403
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,880
 And the idea is that they just follow.

404
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,760
 And it can last a very long time, sometimes several weeks,

405
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,720
 where they're just following and then they'll sleep and then follow and so on.

406
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,320
 On what this weekend, I saw a conger of caterpillars.

407
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:52,880
 Did you?

408
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,680
 There must have been 30 if there was two.

409
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,640
 And there was two.

410
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,000
 That was fantastic.

411
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,760
 It was in the carpark in Spain.

412
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,360
 And they were just walking like...

413
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,360
 As to nose, as to nose, as to nose.

414
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,720
 And they were all just wandering along.

415
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,920
 And I googled it and apparently they're looking for mating grounds

416
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,440
 or food or something.

417
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,240
 But they always go in this sort of conger line.

418
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,120
 Were they heading...

419
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,560
 Were they near the edge of the carpark?

420
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,920
 No, they all know.

421
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:18,560
 Oh, yeah.

422
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,200
 Oh, stuff.

423
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:22,400
 I just love the thought of you, Ron Holliday, in Spain.

424
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,960
 And everyone's going, "Oh, he's James, he's eyes on the carpark."

425
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,000
 Like, it's a cat.

426
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,200
 It's a cat.

427
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,960
 Just behind the caterpillars.

428
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:33,680
 Oh, dear.

429
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,640
 I'm going to watch Colo.

430
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:35,440
 That is cool.

431
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,640
 See this line on the road?

432
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,120
 Yeah.

433
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:40,160
 What it is, and the closer you get, the more you realise that it sees carpilling.

434
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:40,640
 Yeah.

435
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,040
 Well, this, I mean, this sounds like a pretty amazing thing to witness.

436
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,240
 And scientists do watch it.

437
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,840
 The story I read, yeah.

438
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:52,320
 The man to raise, where 20 rays were following the main lady who's called Big Bertha.

439
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,920
 They named, they, I think, the name all the rays.

440
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,760
 Because there's Miles Ray.

441
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,960
 They said she was being closely followed by Miles Ray.

442
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,440
 We thought that he was the one for her later on.

443
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,800
 When we checked out the footage, we found out Lightning Ray had pursued her on his own.

444
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:10,080
 I've got thinking of a few new nicknames for myself.

445
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:13,360
 Have you guys could start calling me Lightning Ray?

446
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,720
 Yeah, so yeah, that's what they do.

447
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:20,560
 And they just, they've battled it out, or whoever lasts till the end.

448
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,880
 I'd also recommend to anyone listening to this.

449
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,720
 It is not a smart fluting strategy to follow a woman for weeks at a time.

450
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,960
 The group of your friends.

451
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:36,240
 There was, in 2024, there was a Ray who managed to successfully mate on their own.

452
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:40,640
 And there was a female stingray living with a load of male sharks.

453
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,120
 And she became pregnant.

454
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:48,400
 And what a lot of people thought is maybe she'd been impregnated by the sharks.

455
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,880
 Because she had like bite marks on the side of her.

456
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,640
 And that's quite often sharks will bite when they're mating to kind of get a grip.

457
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:59,760
 But I think generally speaking, what we think has happened now is that she

458
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,480
 got pregnant through pathogenesis.

459
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:08,560
 So females have, they have their egg cells, but they also have another thing in

460
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,000
 their body called polar bodies.

461
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,240
 And these contain genes as well.

462
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:15,680
 And if there are no males around, then the polar bodies can get into the eggs

463
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,520
 and they can then turn into...

464
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,480
 Oh, wow.

465
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,440
 The virgin birth.

466
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,480
 It's virgin birth.

467
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,240
 It's even crazier in a way.

468
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:25,040
 There are some rays, but it sounds like it's not this one.

469
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:29,120
 Because otherwise, it might have been mentioned that can sort of hold and incubate

470
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,880
 the sperm that they collect.

471
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,200
 And that can be held for quite some time.

472
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,720
 Critic female choice.

473
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,000
 Yeah, exactly.

474
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,600
 Yeah, that's what I would have thought it was.

475
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,480
 But clearly...

476
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,440
 Yeah, well, I don't know.

477
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:44,960
 Like, the scientists are still not certain, but they think it's this kind of polar body thing.

478
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,120
 Raised in general, I said there are...

479
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,840
 What did I say? I said 11 species of mobular ray.

480
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:52,400
 And they're known as the mobulids, which is a great name.

481
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,480
 So three of those species are manta rays.

482
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,800
 And the other rate are devil rays, right?

483
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,480
 Sorry, right.

484
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,280
 I had no shame.

485
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,480
 Good, no shame.

486
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:04,000
 But they've been recategorised a lot lately.

487
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,400
 And I think the last time we talked about them was about eight years ago.

488
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,320
 They had just been all shaken up and redistributed and rearranged.

489
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,120
 Oh, yeah.

490
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,720
 Scientifically, it's a new...

491
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,760
 Because there's a new effect.

492
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,120
 There's no such thing as a ray.

493
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,480
 Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.

494
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:21,920
 And so the newest manta ray was discovered in 2025 last year.

495
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,280
 We're still just going to...

496
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,040
 These things are massive as well.

497
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,920
 And it was by a scientist called Andrea Marshall.

498
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:33,440
 The Atlantic manta ray is the third species of manta ray that we now know about.

499
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:39,120
 And back in 2009, she had observed it and thought it was a bit fishy.

500
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:45,200
 Anyway, and it's taken until now to prove it, right?

501
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:50,080
 And to sort of demonstrate it and sort of do the analysis to show that it's a separate species.

502
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:54,000
 The amazing thing was, in 2009, she and her colleagues had also first described

503
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,680
 the second species of manta ray.

504
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,440
 I just think it's amazing.

505
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:01,040
 And the reason it's so hard to scientifically describe them

506
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,520
 is that what do you need to describe in these species?

507
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,800
 You need to know that it's not the same as an old species.

508
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,680
 Yep, but what's the way of proving it is what I mean?

509
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,280
 Oh, genetic testing.

510
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,120
 Yes, but what do you need to do genetic testing?

511
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:15,200
 Some genetic material.

512
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:15,920
 You need a body.

513
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,320
 Right.

514
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:21,120
 And these things, they're really hard to study.

515
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,640
 A, because when they die, they sink.

516
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,720
 Dimer.

517
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:28,240
 And secondly, they're made of cartilage, not bone, which decomposes faster.

518
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:28,960
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

519
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,280
 So it's bloody hard to get hold of a sample.

520
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:35,280
 They're still quite mysterious. They're still quite strange alien things.

521
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,840
 And it just takes a very long time to find one that's washed up.

522
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:38,080
 Right.

523
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,000
 And get it to a scientist in time, that kind of thing.

524
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:40,480
 So yeah.

525
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:45,600
 Can I quickly point out, you did do a fact, no such thing as a ray

526
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,920
 on the show ages ago.

527
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:51,440
 And I think that applies right here, right now.

528
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,120
 Aren't I right?

529
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,480
 Matthew.

530
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:58,320
 I've been called to that.

531
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,040
 Oh no.

532
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,080
 You're not a real ray.

533
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,040
 No, that is true.

534
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:01,920
 That is a ray.

535
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,200
 That's ray charlatan.

536
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,240
 That's true.

537
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:06,960
 It's a, it's a neck.

538
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:07,600
 It's a neck day.

539
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,440
 You know, he's called Ray.

540
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,240
 It's real nice Matthews.

541
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,560
 He's called Ray because he sounds like Ray Romano.

542
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,000
 That's what one of his friends thought at school.

543
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,440
 From everybody loves Raymond.

544
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,520
 And they'd all just started calling me Ray.

545
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,040
 And that's how it's called on.

546
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,960
 And I'm no one's genetically tested me here.

547
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:25,360
 No one's noticed that I'm not a genetically different species to Ray Romano.

548
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:30,800
 You know that Ray Romano really hated the name of that show?

549
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,640
 Everybody loves Raymond.

550
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:38,000
 And he hated it so much that he kept saying to the producers we need to change this title.

551
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,720
 And they made a deal with him apparently that if they made it into a top 10 show,

552
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:43,760
 they will change the name.

553
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:47,760
 And then they did it for a few years, became more and more successful.

554
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,600
 Eventually, they cracked the top 10.

555
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:52,320
 He went into the producers and said, right, we've got a deal.

556
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,680
 It's time to change the name.

557
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:54,800
 And they said, well, we can't change it.

558
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:55,840
 Now it's a top 10 show.

559
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,520
 Oh man, that's so funny.

560
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,160
 That's great.

561
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,280
 Everyone loves Raymond.

562
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,400
 Ray hated that name.

563
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,640
 Here's another one.

564
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:05,680
 Ray Parker, Jr.

565
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:06,560
 You heard of him?

566
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:07,360
 Ghostbusters.

567
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,720
 Right, the song Ghostbusters.

568
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:09,200
 Yes.

569
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,200
 Turns out, revealed in an interview recently,

570
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,640
 he is afraid of ghosts.

571
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:18,480
 You're busting myth off today, today.

572
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:19,440
 I trusted him.

573
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:23,440
 And he used to be a solo artist called Radio.

574
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,480
 That's a cool nickname.

575
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,720
 That is a cool name, yeah.

576
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:29,040
 They can be huge, Ray's.

577
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:32,400
 They can be 17 feet long.

578
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,160
 A giant devil ray.

579
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:36,160
 I mean, that's really, really big.

580
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,440
 Is that, and because

581
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:40,080
 is there wingspan bigger than their length?

582
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,600
 They're usually about the same, I think.

583
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:42,880
 They're legs wet.

584
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,040
 They're like, yeah, they're diamonds.

585
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:45,760
 Yeah, yes.

586
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:50,320
 But a mentorate 10 feet long needs to eat about,

587
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:54,320
 well, I suppose, any mentorate needs to eat about 12% of its body weight

588
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:55,360
 every week, right?

589
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:56,400
 Every week.

590
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,120
 That's not much.

591
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:58,960
 I don't fully know, like, what do we have to eat?

592
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:01,920
 Well, let's say you weigh 100 kilos, it'll be less than that,

593
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,800
 but so that'd be 12 kilos worth of food a week,

594
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,360
 which is less than two kilos per day.

595
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:10,000
 Two kilos feels like a lot.

596
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,640
 I'm thinking of my chocolate cereal in the morning.

597
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:13,920
 I'm thinking of my...

598
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:17,840
 If you buy a steak, it would be like 250 grams, right?

599
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:18,400
 Yeah, that's good.

600
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:19,200
 So that is a fair bit.

601
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:23,200
 So you would have to eat eight steaks every day.

602
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:23,680
 Okay.

603
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:24,640
 Okay, so that is a fair bit.

604
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:27,680
 I'm thinking of 10 kg of potatoes, plus a little bit more.

605
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,120
 Right.

606
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:31,760
 We all have our ways to visualize it.

607
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:35,840
 Well, that was on men2brayadvocates.com.

608
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:36,240
 Oh, yeah.

609
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,360
 It was just a cracking website.

610
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:38,880
 You may have found it in the course of your research.

611
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,320
 I'm on the devil rise education.

612
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:44,960
 No, no, no, no, no, no.

613
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:45,440
 I love it.

614
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:46,240
 Thank you.

615
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,920
 But they can only eat plankton.

616
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,520
 They can't eat 250 grams steak.

617
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,640
 They zoo plankton.

618
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,560
 You know, tiny, tiny things in the water.

619
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:55,520
 And men2brayadvocates.com calculated

620
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,760
 that a 10-foot ray would need to eat

621
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,520
 how many pieces of plankton a week?

622
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,840
 This is a guessing game.

623
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:02,000
 Yeah.

624
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,680
 10 million.

625
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:03,840
 10 million.

626
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:04,640
 T-pot, short.

627
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:05,120
 Oh, great.

628
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:06,080
 Okay. 10 million.

629
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:08,560
 What, 1.2 feet of plankton?

630
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:12,640
 I mean, okay, because you've done it in a different seat.

631
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:13,920
 You know, and that's fine.

632
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,920
 Oh, I see.

633
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:16,400
 Yeah.

634
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:17,040
 Very clever.

635
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:17,920
 Very clever.

636
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:21,920
 So you can just explain that for the rest of the journey.

637
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,680
 [LAUGHTER]

638
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,280
 Damn, pass.

639
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:26,000
 Okay.

640
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:26,640
 [LAUGHTER]

641
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,800
 James is closest because he answered in the unit

642
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,720
 that I was expecting people to answer in.

643
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,320
 [LAUGHTER]

644
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:33,120
 You say 10 million.

645
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:33,680
 10 million.

646
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:36,400
 19.2 million.

647
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,680
 19 million, 200,000.

648
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,440
 That's a lot of magnitude.

649
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,280
 Yeah, I could be right, depending on him.

650
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:45,040
 We do need to check the math on rays first,

651
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:46,400
 before we award those to change.

652
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:47,200
 It's a plankton.

653
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,440
 But they have to keep swimming forward as they eat,

654
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:50,880
 because they're a thing called

655
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,800
 obligate ram ventilators.

656
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,680
 They can't go through them, and they take the air out of it.

657
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:56,640
 Exactly, yeah.

658
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:57,200
 They have to keep--

659
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,080
 So you've got to just--

660
00:45:58,080 --> 00:45:59,680
 Some ancient sharks will do this.

661
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:01,680
 You just have to keep moving forwards otherwise you die.

662
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:02,240
 Yeah.

663
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:02,960
 It's quite cool.

664
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:03,920
 I think that's quite a good--

665
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:04,720
 It's quite a--

666
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,000
 It's good metaphor for life.

667
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:06,480
 Yeah.

668
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:07,680
 If you stand still.

669
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,920
 The reason I thought dolphins is they sleep

670
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:12,400
 half-brain at a time, so that they can still swim.

671
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,720
 I don't think that's to do with the breathing, though.

672
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:16,960
 I think that might be more to hide from predators.

673
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:17,360
 Yeah.

674
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:18,960
 Because dolphins have to surface, obviously.

675
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,640
 But so how do you raise sleep?

676
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,240
 Don't know.

677
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:23,040
 Right?

678
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,680
 [LAUGHTER]

679
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,560
 Can't comfortably, but after going through every social faux

680
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:29,440
 power I may think to you.

681
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:32,720
 [LAUGHTER]

682
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:34,640
 One quick thing on belly-flopping.

683
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:36,880
 Oh, yeah.

684
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:40,000
 Have you ever heard the idea that if you belly-flop

685
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,680
 from a very high position, and then land on water,

686
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:45,440
 it's just as bad as landing on concrete?

687
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:46,280
 I haven't heard it yet.

688
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:46,760
 Yeah, yeah.

689
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:48,320
 Do you think it's true?

690
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:50,320
 Oh, well, thank you.

691
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:51,960
 I can-- yes.

692
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:55,200
 I keep seeing videos now of people diving

693
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,840
 from very high heights in a belly-flop position,

694
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:00,400
 and landing in the kind of--

695
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,520
 So you think no?

696
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:02,160
 I think no.

697
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:05,760
 And I know this room, I suppose you'd say that.

698
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,800
 If you throw something before you land,

699
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:09,360
 it breaks the tension of the water.

700
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:11,360
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's true.

701
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:14,760
 My feeling as the answer is no, but it still hurts a lot.

702
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:15,960
 I think that's fair.

703
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:17,560
 I think that's probably right.

704
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:19,280
 Mythbusters, our friends at Mythbusters,

705
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:23,600
 they did some tests and threw two big pig carcasses

706
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:25,560
 out of a helicopter.

707
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:28,160
 And they x-rayed it, and they found that the pavement drop

708
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:31,200
 resulted in 17 fractures, a shattered pelvis,

709
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:35,040
 and a decapitation, while the water drop yielded seven

710
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:37,240
 fractures and a broken neck.

711
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:38,080
 Oh, yes.

712
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:40,120
 So neither of them's good for you, but definitely

713
00:47:40,120 --> 00:48:00,480
 hitting the pavement is more of an impact.

714
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:04,520
 One last thing from me, January 15th, 1990,

715
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:07,800
 Lottie Stevens was out on a boat in New Caledonia

716
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,840
 when his boat capsized.

717
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:14,240
 And according to the story, as reported by Radio Vanuatu,

718
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:19,720
 he was drifting for four days before a giant stingray came

719
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:22,400
 and gave him a ride back to land.

720
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,400
 Yeah.

721
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,400
 What's going on?

722
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,760
 They're living some avatars, right there.

723
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:29,080
 Ray, you're not the face of Vanuatu at the moment.

724
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:30,400
 Yeah, I have the face of Vanuatu.

725
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:31,400
 What do you mean?

726
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:33,760
 Because I found this guy floating at sea.

727
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:38,880
 [LAUGHTER]

728
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:40,800
 Are you really connected to Vanuatu?

729
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:44,600
 Yeah, I did have tourism campaign for Vanuatu last year.

730
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:47,160
 You could meet Lottie Stevens, because I'd love to know more.

731
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:53,240
 The stingray carried him for 450 miles back to shore.

732
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:58,600
 It took 13 days of being carried on the back of the stingray

733
00:48:58,600 --> 00:48:59,920
 before they got home.

734
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,280
 This is so wonderful.

735
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:04,640
 We didn't emphasize that part of the tourism campaign.

736
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,960
 You're swimming out as far as you like, don't you?

737
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:09,040
 [LAUGHTER]

738
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:11,000
 There's stuff out there that'll bring you back.

739
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,520
 She'll bring me back.

740
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:14,080

742
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:20,640
 OK, that is it.

743
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:22,000
 That is all of our facts.

744

 My Instagram is no such thing as James Harkin, Andy.

751
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:37,840
 My name is @AndruhunterM, and Ray.

752

 @RaileryComedy.

753
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:39,840
 Oh, nice.

754
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:42,800
 And Ray, so you're on tour in the UK right now.

755
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:46,120
 Yes, getting all over the beautiful British Isles in Ireland.

756
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:50,000
 And maybe Barcelona, but yes, there's a city nearby.

757
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:50,840
 I'll probably be there.

758
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:52,800
 And that's in February of--

759
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,160
 Yeah, February march this year, yes.

760
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:54,840
 In the UK.

761
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:56,440
 Yes, and then Australia the rest of the year.

762
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:57,000
 OK, cool.

763
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,040
 Check it out online, everyone.

764
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:01,280
 Go find the date, Sea of Rae is coming to a town near you.

765
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:03,320
 Or should I say, Matthew?

766
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:08,360
