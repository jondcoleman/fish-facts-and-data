00:00:00,00:00:18,"Hey everyone, welcome to the very first episode of Little Fish."
00:00:18,00:00:22,This is the show where instead of talking about our four favorite facts from the last seven
00:00:22,00:00:28,"days, we have gone through the podcast at qi.com inbox and selected your best facts."
00:00:28,00:00:29,We're going to be doing this every Monday.
00:00:29,00:00:34,"So if you want to join and be part of this extra special Monday bonus episode, just send"
00:00:34,00:00:38,in your best facts and we'll be reading them out each week.
00:00:38,00:00:39,So let's get into it.
00:00:39,00:00:41,I'm sat here with James Harkin and Andrew Hunter Murray.
00:00:41,00:00:42,Hello.
00:00:42,00:00:44,"And in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:44,00:00:45,This is from Daveli.
00:00:45,00:00:50,It's about an executive leaving a job at McDonald's UK after 18 months in post.
00:00:50,00:00:51,Okay.
00:00:51,00:00:58,And the reason it's a great fact is because her name is Zoe Hamburger.
00:00:58,00:01:01,"In fact, she was promoted within the McDonald's trucker."
00:01:01,00:01:04,She's gone off to run McDonald's Netherlands.
00:01:04,00:01:06,She said Hamburger has been my name my entire life.
00:01:06,00:01:10,"So as you can imagine, it has always made people do a bit of a double take."
00:01:10,00:01:12,I've never heard of anyone else with that.
00:01:12,00:01:13,I know.
00:01:13,00:01:15,There's a comedian called Neil Hamburger.
00:01:15,00:01:16,Is it his real name?
00:01:16,00:01:17,No.
00:01:17,00:01:18,That feels like it's not nice.
00:01:18,00:01:21,It's not called Neil.
00:01:21,00:01:26,"I found a report on this from the Metro, which I just want to read a line from it."
00:01:26,00:01:33,"Despite her name being the beefy snack item, that is the best thing of our journalism"
00:01:33,00:01:34,isn't it?
00:01:34,00:01:35,"There's a name for it, I think."
00:01:35,00:01:36,Second mentions.
00:01:36,00:01:40,Second mentions where it's like a duck across the road.
00:01:40,00:01:41,The waddling.
00:01:41,00:01:45,The foul.
00:01:45,00:01:47,"Despite her name being the beefy snack item, she said her fate."
00:01:47,00:01:51,The favourite menu McDonald's item is the double cheeseburger.
00:01:51,00:01:52,Believe it or not.
00:01:52,00:01:53,I do believe it.
00:01:53,00:01:55,I absolutely believe it.
00:01:55,00:01:56,Anyway.
00:01:56,00:01:57,Yeah.
00:01:57,00:01:58,"Oh, that's really good."
00:01:58,00:01:59,I do.
00:01:59,00:02:02,So I guess her relatives or her ancestors came from Hamburg.
00:02:02,00:02:03,Exactly.
00:02:03,00:02:04,That's what it is.
00:02:04,00:02:05,We don't really have names like it.
00:02:05,00:02:06,Do we?
00:02:06,00:02:07,We don't have sort of like Tony Scalcer.
00:02:07,00:02:08,Do we?
00:02:08,00:02:09,"Oh, we do."
00:02:09,00:02:10,Yeah.
00:02:10,00:02:11,"No, we absolutely do."
00:02:11,00:02:12,Like Michael Bolton.
00:02:12,00:02:13,"Oh, yeah."
00:02:13,00:02:16,But that's not because his real name is Bolton.
00:02:16,00:02:17,He changed his name.
00:02:17,00:02:18,What?
00:02:18,00:02:21,Michael Bolton's real name is Michael Bolton.
00:02:21,00:02:22,That's it.
00:02:22,00:02:23,Yeah.
00:02:23,00:02:24,There's been a news Bolton.
00:02:24,00:02:25,Is that it?
00:02:25,00:02:26,Yeah.
00:02:26,00:02:27,He changed it.
00:02:27,00:02:28,He changed it.
00:02:28,00:02:31,But there are many people whose surname is the name of a town.
00:02:31,00:02:32,Yes.
00:02:32,00:02:33,Jack London.
00:02:33,00:02:34,"Sydney, Swini."
00:02:34,00:02:35,Swini's not a place.
00:02:35,00:02:36,There are the Sydney's.
00:02:36,00:02:37,And you can put in.
00:02:37,00:02:38,"Yeah, but it's a first."
00:02:38,00:02:45,But her relatives were in that 1970s cup show.
00:02:45,00:02:50,"I'm struggling to think of many UK plays of Jack London, you're absolutely right."
00:02:50,00:02:52,The Earl of Bristol.
00:02:52,00:02:55,Of course.
00:02:55,00:02:58,I'm just actually struggling to think of place names at the moment.
00:02:58,00:03:03,But 100% there are some surnames where it's where you came from.
00:03:03,00:03:09,"Like someone in English, Harris English, the golfer for instance, Sarah Brighton."
00:03:09,00:03:10,She's a person.
00:03:10,00:03:11,"Oh, okay."
00:03:11,00:03:12,Isn't she?
00:03:12,00:03:13,Sarah Brightman.
00:03:13,00:03:14,Okay.
00:03:14,00:03:15,"Okay, Dan."
00:03:15,00:03:16,Keep going.
00:03:16,00:03:17,Sorry.
00:03:17,00:03:18,Maybe you will get one.
00:03:18,00:03:19,Brooklyn Beckham.
00:03:19,00:03:20,Oh god.
00:03:20,00:03:21,Oh god.
00:03:21,00:03:28,"Anyway, just a little extra report on this from BM magazine, which actually stands for Business"
00:03:28,00:03:29,Matters.
00:03:29,00:03:32,"And not as I thought, bowel movement, um, you get that."
00:03:32,00:03:33,You get that on charts.
00:03:33,00:03:36,Hospital charts and things will say BM 3PM or whatever.
00:03:36,00:03:37,BM.
00:03:37,00:03:41,"It's a very regular publication that line, isn't it?"
00:03:41,00:03:44,Really worrying if you haven't had an issue for two or three days of BM magazine.
00:03:44,00:03:48,"And you need to buy prunes, prunes, prunes quarterly."
00:03:48,00:03:55,"Um, but just they found a lovely extra detail, which is just hamburger has been succeeded"
00:03:55,00:04:00,"as chief, as UK chief restaurant officer by Patrick Gerber, who takes over responsibility"
00:04:00,00:04:03,for restaurant operations across the country.
00:04:03,00:04:07,It is good that Gerber has no responsibility for the operations in France as his surname
00:04:07,00:04:11,in French means to vomit or to puke in a slang context.
00:04:11,00:04:12,Interesting.
00:04:12,00:04:13,How good is that?
00:04:13,00:04:15,"That's BM magazine, delivery of the goods there."
00:04:15,00:04:16,That's really good.
00:04:16,00:04:17,Here's another thing about Gerber.
00:04:17,00:04:22,"I think I might have to cut this because I might be wrong, but I think it's a baby food company"
00:04:22,00:04:23,Gerber or an old one.
00:04:23,00:04:24,They might not be around anymore.
00:04:24,00:04:25,Right.
00:04:25,00:04:33,And there was a famous thing where they issued some baby food in a country where everyone
00:04:33,00:04:37,"in that country, if you ever saw a picture on a packet of food that you would think that's"
00:04:37,00:04:42,what's inside the food and the baby food had a picture of a baby on it and everyone
00:04:42,00:04:46,said that the country thought that this baby food was actually food made of babies.
00:04:46,00:04:47,That's very good.
00:04:47,00:04:48,I think.
00:04:48,00:04:49,That's very what I used ago.
00:04:49,00:04:53,I bought a bike for my son for Christmas and it had a picture of a baby riding the bike
00:04:53,00:04:54,on the front.
00:04:54,00:04:57,And on the box it did say baby not included.
00:04:57,00:04:58,Yeah.
00:04:58,00:04:59,It's funny.
00:04:59,00:05:01,"Should we move on to our next slide, James?"
00:05:01,00:05:02,You got something?
00:05:02,00:05:03,OK.
00:05:03,00:05:08,"This one is from Wayne Height, H-O-I-T. It looks like although it looks like a misspelling"
00:05:08,00:05:09,of halt.
00:05:09,00:05:12,It's Height.
00:05:12,00:05:15,Wayne says spiral staircases are not spirals.
00:05:15,00:05:16,Okay.
00:05:16,00:05:17,Okay.
00:05:17,00:05:18,Point of information.
00:05:18,00:05:19,Yeah.
00:05:19,00:05:20,Sure they are.
00:05:20,00:05:24,"Well, he says that although they are cold spiral, they are actually helical."
00:05:24,00:05:25,They are helixes.
00:05:25,00:05:30,A real spiral twists with an increasing or decreasing radius.
00:05:30,00:05:36,"For example, a spiral on or he doesn't say this, but for instance on a snail shell, you"
00:05:36,00:05:37,know.
00:05:37,00:05:42,"Kind of goes out like that, but a staircase always has the same radius."
00:05:42,00:05:45,Like it's not getting wider as you go up.
00:05:45,00:05:46,No.
00:05:46,00:05:47,Is it?
00:05:47,00:05:50,It's always going to be about the same width at the bottom as it is at the top.
00:05:50,00:05:51,Right.
00:05:51,00:05:56,"And if you, a helix is basically something, a line which you draw around a cylinder."
00:05:56,00:05:58,Right.
00:05:58,00:06:02,"And he says, I guess they're called spiral because unfortunately most people have no idea"
00:06:02,00:06:03,what a helix is.
00:06:03,00:06:06,"But I think people know what, like double helix."
00:06:06,00:06:07,They're famous.
00:06:07,00:06:08,Yeah.
00:06:08,00:06:09,DNA fame.
00:06:09,00:06:14,So are there any actually spiral staircases where the building gets wider and wider and wider?
00:06:14,00:06:20,"Well, here's the, here's the interesting or probably not very interesting point."
00:06:20,00:06:23,Some people say that a helix is a type of spiral.
00:06:23,00:06:26,"Other people say, no, they're completely different things."
00:06:26,00:06:31,And there doesn't seem to be an international body that decides on what a spiral in a helix
00:06:31,00:06:32,is.
00:06:32,00:06:33,Wow.
00:06:33,00:06:36,"I think we have run this on QI actually many, maybe in the age series."
00:06:36,00:06:40,I think we might have done it on their helixes.
00:06:40,00:06:45,"But yeah, we, we have discussed it before and almost come to blows in the QI office."
00:06:45,00:06:46,"James, you're the mathematician."
00:06:46,00:06:49,"I think out of the three of us, you get to make the call."
00:06:49,00:06:54,"I actually, you know at QI, we have a much better mathematician than I am, who's Will Bowen."
00:06:54,00:06:59,And I think he landed on the side of a helix and spiral being different.
00:06:59,00:07:01,So I think that's why we ran with it.
00:07:01,00:07:05,But the other thing that we found when we were researching that was a place called Shator
00:07:05,00:07:07,du Shambore in France.
00:07:07,00:07:11,"And they have a double helix staircase, okay."
00:07:11,00:07:18,"So it's two helixes, two separate, separate staircases, and what that means is, you can go"
00:07:18,00:07:22,up one staircase while someone else is coming down the other staircase.
00:07:22,00:07:25,"So you don't use up any more space because it's still on the same cylinder, but actually"
00:07:25,00:07:31,"two people can go and according to the people who run that house, that stately home, it"
00:07:31,00:07:36,"was designed by Leonardo da Vinci, although we're not quite sure if it belongs."
00:07:36,00:07:39,Wouldn't it be great if you met the love of your life while you were going down and she was
00:07:39,00:07:40,coming up?
00:07:40,00:07:42,"What do you, you don't meet her?"
00:07:42,00:07:45,"Oh, you would never, that's the point about this, that's the whole point of this staircase"
00:07:45,00:07:46,"is, isn't it?"
00:07:46,00:07:49,There's one helix going up on the other one coming down.
00:07:49,00:07:50,You'd never meet.
00:07:50,00:07:51,You'd never meet.
00:07:51,00:07:52,You wake up.
00:07:52,00:07:53,It was all a dream.
00:07:53,00:07:54,Your whole life down.
00:07:54,00:07:55,Your lovely wife and your family.
00:07:55,00:07:56,Oh my God.
00:07:56,00:07:57,They're not tunnels though.
00:07:57,00:07:58,You can see each other going down the steps and going up.
00:07:58,00:07:59,You can't.
00:07:59,00:08:00,"You can't, okay."
00:08:00,00:08:05,Remember there was some Duke or something who had a lot of tunnels made in his house so
00:08:05,00:08:07,that he never saw his staff.
00:08:07,00:08:08,Yes.
00:08:08,00:08:09,I remember that.
00:08:09,00:08:10,He was nicknamed the tunneling Duke.
00:08:10,00:08:14,"It's a good, it's a good, had a bad nickname, isn't it?"
00:08:14,00:08:19,"I've always wanted to go to Cambridge, there's a very specific pub that serves a double helix"
00:08:19,00:08:21,beer or ale.
00:08:21,00:08:22,"Oh, is it a spread eagle?"
00:08:22,00:08:23,"Yeah, it must be."
00:08:23,00:08:28,"It's because it's where the two of them came in, Watson and Crick announced that they'd"
00:08:28,00:08:29,found the secret to life.
00:08:29,00:08:31,Imagine walking into a pub.
00:08:31,00:08:36,"Imagine I walk into the bow of my arms in Bolton and I just walk in and I go, ""I've discovered"
00:08:36,00:08:38,"the secret of life."""
00:08:38,00:08:43,"People would, I mean, they'd give me short shrift anyway, but also it's pronounced Bolton,"
00:08:43,00:08:44,by the way.
00:08:44,00:08:46,Shall we move on to another fact?
00:08:46,00:08:47,All right.
00:08:47,00:08:50,This comes from Charlie Wakefield.
00:08:50,00:08:51,Can I just say Wakefield in Yorkshire?
00:08:51,00:08:52,"Well, there we go."
00:08:52,00:08:53,Great.
00:08:53,00:08:54,There we go.
00:08:54,00:08:55,"Oh, damn."
00:08:55,00:08:58,That was right there for you and James snuck in there and got it.
00:08:58,00:09:01,"I am a fellow TV person who's been working in development for over a decade, so I've"
00:09:01,00:09:05,"discovered hundreds of fish were the facts, but there's one that has always stayed with"
00:09:05,00:09:06,me.
00:09:06,00:09:10,"Astronauts, in space, still get morning wood."
00:09:10,00:09:14,"Sadly, I found this years and years ago in a paper by NASA, I think, but clearly I was"
00:09:14,00:09:18,much better researcher back in the day because I've been unable to find it again.
00:09:18,00:09:24,And they all have that problem as a gal.
00:09:24,00:09:26,"That's NASA's suppressing the truth, isn't it?"
00:09:26,00:09:29,"No, I mean, there is stuff that you can see out there."
00:09:29,00:09:33,This is an interesting thing that they actually have to work on because we're planning voyages
00:09:33,00:09:34,to Mars and so on.
00:09:34,00:09:36,And what does it do to you?
00:09:36,00:09:39,"Hang on, don't astronauts go through the 17 mornings a day because you're spinning around"
00:09:39,00:09:40,the world.
00:09:40,00:09:41,Really fast.
00:09:41,00:09:42,That's a good idea.
00:09:42,00:09:43,I can fight.
00:09:43,00:09:44,Yeah.
00:09:44,00:09:45,Quickly hide.
00:09:45,00:09:46,Yeah.
00:09:46,00:09:50,"So, basically, there's lots of things that they're looking into."
00:09:50,00:09:55,"For example, cosmic rays, what happens to your body and microgravity."
00:09:55,00:09:59,"So when you're in the ISS, from what I've been reading, it says that the blood will often"
00:09:59,00:10:01,travel sort of to where your chest area.
00:10:01,00:10:06,So you don't have much blood down in that area to begin with.
00:10:06,00:10:11,So would you be getting a sort of random morning wood is the question.
00:10:11,00:10:15,"And because we don't know if anyone's had sex up there, we don't know if anyone has had"
00:10:15,00:10:16,a little fiddle up there.
00:10:16,00:10:17,We don't know what's been going on up there.
00:10:17,00:10:21,"There is a rumor that a couple ones up there, isn't there?"
00:10:21,00:10:22,Yeah.
00:10:22,00:10:23,Exactly.
00:10:23,00:10:29,"So, you don't get an erection when your penis is the lowest part of your body."
00:10:29,00:10:35,It's not like the blood rushes down there with no vasculatory system to push it around.
00:10:35,00:10:36,Yeah.
00:10:36,00:10:38,"You know, it's like gravity shouldn't make that much of a difference, okay?"
00:10:38,00:10:39,I see.
00:10:39,00:10:44,"I don't think they think it's a massive influence, but they think it has some influence."
00:10:44,00:10:45,Right.
00:10:45,00:10:46,Yeah.
00:10:46,00:10:47,Is that why your penis is so far down?
00:10:47,00:10:50,Do you think as we evolve our penis is going to get lower and lower and lower?
00:10:50,00:10:51,Absolutely.
00:10:51,00:10:54,And just use the gravity to get the blood down there.
00:10:54,00:10:55,Absolutely.
00:10:55,00:10:58,"Yeah, the end up being one of our toes."
00:10:58,00:11:02,So I was trying to find if there was any evidence of an astronaut having mentioned this.
00:11:02,00:11:08,And I did manage to find one astronaut Mike Malayne in 2014 in an interview with Men's
00:11:08,00:11:13,Health said a couple of times I would wake up from sleep periods and I had a boner that
00:11:13,00:11:15,could have drilled through kryptonite.
00:11:15,00:11:16,Wow.
00:11:16,00:11:17,That's an astronaut.
00:11:17,00:11:22,That's a lot of superman fires.
00:11:22,00:11:24,"Very confident astronauts, aren't they?"
00:11:24,00:11:25,That's stunning.
00:11:25,00:11:26,Yeah.
00:11:26,00:11:27,So that's the one.
00:11:27,00:11:28,That's the one.
00:11:28,00:11:29,Maybe that's what you read.
00:11:29,00:11:33,"I think it's like, basically, Superman is in a cage, which is made of kryptonite."
00:11:33,00:11:34,Yeah.
00:11:34,00:11:35,I think that even happens in the latest one.
00:11:35,00:11:36,"Oh, really?"
00:11:36,00:11:37,That came out this year.
00:11:37,00:11:44,But what you need is this guy to drill through kryptonite cage to free him.
00:11:44,00:11:45,Yeah.
00:11:45,00:11:46,Mike Malayne.
00:11:46,00:11:49,Human bore.
00:11:49,00:11:59,Which is better than the human born nickname than I have.
00:11:59,00:12:00,I promise you this is a coincidence.
00:12:00,00:12:06,But my next one is by Lindy Hardstaff.
00:12:06,00:12:11,"And Lindy says, my fight is you can hear a reflezier flower bloom before you can smell"
00:12:11,00:12:13,it.
00:12:13,00:12:18,So you know the reflezier is the big corpse flower that you get in Southeast Asia and
00:12:18,00:12:23,"any kind of flowers once every few years, maybe, but apparently the petals are so big and"
00:12:23,00:12:29,thick and leathery that each one makes an audible thwack noise as they crack open.
00:12:29,00:12:34,"And Lindy Hardstaff discovered this when doing an overnight shift, monitoring a blooming"
00:12:34,00:12:40,"event at the bog, Bogor, not Bogna, how you're shooting Bogor, Botanic Gardens in 2012."
00:12:40,00:12:41,I've never heard of Bogor.
00:12:41,00:12:42,That's so cool.
00:12:42,00:12:48,"I was nearly, I nearly got to see one of those flowers blooming when we were on tour in"
00:12:48,00:12:49,Melbourne.
00:12:49,00:12:50,Oh.
00:12:50,00:12:55,"There was a, there was a museum and it was about a two hour drive out of Melbourne, I think."
00:12:55,00:13:00,"And it had one on display, one of these amazing corpse flowers that opens up once every ten"
00:13:00,00:13:01,years or whatever it is.
00:13:01,00:13:03,And it was just flowering that day.
00:13:03,00:13:04,How long did you miss it by?
00:13:04,00:13:05,"Oh, I could have got to it."
00:13:05,00:13:06,"Oh, so you, okay."
00:13:06,00:13:08,I comfortably could have got to it.
00:13:08,00:13:09,I tried this not to.
00:13:09,00:13:10,"Oh, wow."
00:13:10,00:13:11,I was busy.
00:13:11,00:13:12,I was in Melbourne with my friend.
00:13:12,00:13:19,That reminds me of the world laziness championships that I was supposed to go to this year and decided
00:13:19,00:13:20,that the weather wasn't very good.
00:13:20,00:13:23,"So I'd go the next day and when I got there, it had finished."
00:13:23,00:13:25,Everyone would stood up by the time you got there.
00:13:25,00:13:26,Yeah.
00:13:26,00:13:27,Are you serious?
00:13:27,00:13:28,I can't tell if you're serious.
00:13:28,00:13:29,That really happened.
00:13:29,00:13:30,Yeah.
00:13:30,00:13:31,"It's, who could lay down the longest?"
00:13:31,00:13:32,Is this Montenegro?
00:13:32,00:13:33,It's a Montenegro.
00:13:33,00:13:35,It's called the world lazy citizen competition.
00:13:35,00:13:38,"And I missed the end of it because I couldn't be bothered leaving, but the weather was bad."
00:13:38,00:13:39,That's so good.
00:13:39,00:13:42,"The lead way, I feel like you should have won the competition."
00:13:42,00:13:46,I feel like I'm going to write to the organizers and ask for a special award.
00:13:46,00:13:47,Yeah.
00:13:47,00:13:48,That's good.
00:13:48,00:13:52,Someone travelled all the way over from the UK only to miss it out of laziness.
00:13:52,00:13:55,"Well, I'm quite annoyed because I did email them saying, ""Can I come along?"""
00:13:55,00:13:56,"And they said, ""Yes."""
00:13:56,00:13:59,And I told them what they had come and they didn't email me to say it had finished.
00:13:59,00:14:00,"What were you expecting, James?"
00:14:00,00:14:02,What were you expecting from the world laziness people?
00:14:02,00:14:03,A roar-hour drive.
00:14:03,00:14:04,A roar-hour drive.
00:14:04,00:14:06,A roar-hour drive.
00:14:06,00:14:07,Into the mountains.
00:14:07,00:14:08,You couldn't be bothered to reply.
00:14:08,00:14:09,That's all.
00:14:09,00:14:15,"So go to a church once, that you drove out of your way, forced to Palina to come with you, too."
00:14:15,00:14:20,"I went, there are two rugby union themed churches in France."
00:14:20,00:14:24,And I'd been to one of them and the other one was only a three and a half hour drive away.
00:14:24,00:14:26,"And when we got there, it was closed."
00:14:26,00:14:27,Yeah.
00:14:27,00:14:28,Unbelievable question.
00:14:28,00:14:30,A rugby union themed church.
00:14:30,00:14:31,Yeah.
00:14:31,00:14:32,What's that?
00:14:32,00:14:38,It's a small chapel where people who are rugby union fans can go and they put like some
00:14:38,00:14:41,other shirts there and pray for their team to do well.
00:14:41,00:14:42,"Oh, okay."
00:14:42,00:14:46,And also actually one of the stained glass windows is themed on rugby union as well.
00:14:46,00:14:49,And the priest throws the community away from backwards into your mouth.
00:14:49,00:14:50,Very good.
00:14:50,00:14:51,Yep.
00:14:51,00:14:58,And when you go and get the way for everyone puts their head in between the person in front slags.
00:14:58,00:15:00,"Are you having been back, presumably?"
00:15:00,00:15:01,"No, I can't imagine I ever will."
00:15:01,00:15:02,"Ah, it's such a shame."
00:15:02,00:15:03,I had that same experience.
00:15:03,00:15:08,I went down to Yovl Junction train station to go see your haunted buffet.
00:15:08,00:15:12,And supposedly the sausages levitate and so on.
00:15:12,00:15:13,I did.
00:15:13,00:15:14,And I went on a Sunday.
00:15:14,00:15:15,It was my only chance.
00:15:15,00:15:18,And I had to explain to Finneller and the kids like Daddy's going to go off.
00:15:18,00:15:19,I've got to do this thing.
00:15:19,00:15:20,Long journey.
00:15:20,00:15:21,I was in London.
00:15:21,00:15:22,Got there.
00:15:22,00:15:23,London to Yovl.
00:15:23,00:15:24,Yeah.
00:15:24,00:15:25,Did you know where Yovl was at the time?
00:15:25,00:15:26,"Oh, I did have a brief look at it."
00:15:26,00:15:27,Yeah.
00:15:27,00:15:28,Yeah.
00:15:28,00:15:29,It's a distance.
00:15:29,00:15:30,It's a distance.
00:15:30,00:15:31,"Anyway, Cap, I wish I couldn't get in."
00:15:31,00:15:32,Look through the windows.
00:15:32,00:15:33,Couldn't see anything.
00:15:33,00:15:34,You imagine if you'd look through the windows.
00:15:34,00:15:40,"You could see a levitating sausage, you couldn't get any further towards it."
00:15:40,00:15:41,Yeah.
00:15:41,00:15:42,Maybe that would have been worse.
00:15:42,00:15:43,Yeah.
00:15:43,00:15:44,The sausages weren't even out.
00:15:44,00:15:45,Two levitate.
00:15:45,00:15:46,Okay.
00:15:46,00:15:47,Andy.
00:15:47,00:15:48,Okay.
00:15:48,00:15:50,Here's one from David Morgan from Sydney.
00:15:50,00:15:54,"This is about Sir Henry Parks, premier of New South Wales in the 19th century."
00:15:54,00:15:55,Oh.
00:15:55,00:15:58,Australia's father of federation who got the ball rolling on the six British colonies
00:15:58,00:16:00,"in Australia, joining together to form a country."
00:16:00,00:16:02,So he campaigned for this.
00:16:02,00:16:03,Right.
00:16:03,00:16:07,That's not that's sort of person.
00:16:07,00:16:08,That's the business end of his life.
00:16:08,00:16:13,"But David Morgan is writing to tell us that he was also in the Australian parlance, a mad"
00:16:13,00:16:14,keen router.
00:16:14,00:16:16,"Oh, no."
00:16:16,00:16:21,"He was married three times, fathering 12 children with the first Lady Parks."
00:16:21,00:16:25,"And after a 22-year gap, five more with the second Lady Parks."
00:16:25,00:16:26,Wow.
00:16:26,00:16:27,17 children.
00:16:27,00:16:28,17.
00:16:28,00:16:31,The first three were born out of wedlock while the first Lady Parks was still alive.
00:16:31,00:16:32,She had been his housemate.
00:16:32,00:16:35,Dinner in the 1890s when Parks was nearly 80.
00:16:35,00:16:39,"The editor of the Sydney Morning Herald innocently remarked, ""These oysters are good."""
00:16:39,00:16:43,"Parks replied, ""I don't need these adventitious aides."
00:16:43,00:16:46,"Lady Parks and I, until quite recently, have been in the habit of having connections 17"
00:16:46,00:16:48,or 18 times every night.
00:16:48,00:16:51,"And we now have connection 10 or 11 times daily."""
00:16:51,00:16:52,Partly recreation.
00:16:52,00:16:53,[LAUGHTER]
00:16:53,00:16:54,Super.
00:16:54,00:16:59,Conor was very quiet though the editor for the rest of the dinner.
00:16:59,00:17:03,Next later made a splendid speech full of elevated thought and moving language.
00:17:03,00:17:04,There you go.
00:17:04,00:17:11,"I've got to say, all cultures around the world, I completely appreciate and I think people"
00:17:11,00:17:14,"should be able to do whatever they want, whatever they're from and I would never take"
00:17:14,00:17:19,the piss out of anyone or say that anyone around the world is wrong in any way for what
00:17:19,00:17:20,they do.
00:17:20,00:17:24,But the word root to mean have sex does not sit well with me.
00:17:24,00:17:25,"Oh, really?"
00:17:25,00:17:26,Interesting.
00:17:26,00:17:29,"Well, maybe you'd like what Parks did as his first job because I did a little bit of"
00:17:29,00:17:30,extra digging on him.
00:17:30,00:17:36,"He was born in Warwickshire actually in England and his first job was as a bone-turner, which"
00:17:36,00:17:42,is kind of someone who I think shizzles and chips and shakes bone and ivory.
00:17:42,00:17:44,I think it's that.
00:17:44,00:17:47,Did you use root in UK to mean sex?
00:17:47,00:17:49,"No, that would not mean that."
00:17:49,00:17:50,It would not mean it here.
00:17:50,00:17:52,"Okay, so a rooter is something you use to connect to the internet."
00:17:52,00:17:53,Yes.
00:17:53,00:17:55,Or Joe roots the English cricketer.
00:17:55,00:17:56,"Right, okay."
00:17:56,00:18:01,"Okay, so who has never scored a century in Australia at time of recording?"
00:18:01,00:18:05,"He's busy, isn't he?"
00:18:05,00:18:08,"Probably so many misunderstandings, whenever he says his name anywhere."
00:18:08,00:18:09,Yeah.
00:18:09,00:18:10,"James, when we're good at you?"
00:18:10,00:18:13,"James, yes, that's the name of the person who wrote in."
00:18:13,00:18:17,"They didn't put their surname just James and they wrote, ""Long time, listen, a first"
00:18:17,00:18:18,time caller.
00:18:18,00:18:20,Hopefully you haven't heard this back before.
00:18:20,00:18:28,"The last piece of Nazi architecture in Berlin is a 12,650 ton concrete cylinder."""
00:18:28,00:18:29,Nice.
00:18:29,00:18:39,"Okay, so this is the Schwurbelastungschupper, meaning heavy load-exerting body and it was used"
00:18:39,00:18:44,to test whether the ground would be strong enough for all the amazing projects that they wanted
00:18:44,00:18:46,to build in Berlin.
00:18:46,00:18:53,So they wanted to do like a big arch to celebrate the glorious victory in World War II and they
00:18:53,00:18:57,thought we could only do this arch if we have strong enough ground.
00:18:57,00:19:01,"So they built this big cylinder that was really, really heavy to see if the ground was strong"
00:19:01,00:19:07,enough to hold it and it turns out that Berlin is a massive swamp and really you couldn't
00:19:07,00:19:10,"put a big arch there, but then they also couldn't move it because it was too big."
00:19:10,00:19:12,"No, I'm still there."
00:19:12,00:19:13,So they...
00:19:13,00:19:16,That's bad planning in two ways.
00:19:16,00:19:20,Firstly you should know that you're on a swamp and secondly you should not put anything
00:19:20,00:19:22,in without having a plan to take it out again.
00:19:22,00:19:29,I think nobody accuses the Nazis of being 100% in their plans.
00:19:29,00:19:31,They've had one or two flubs in their time.
00:19:31,00:19:32,"Yeah, true, yeah."
00:19:32,00:19:34,A second Russia.
00:19:34,00:19:38,"But yeah, and the thing is that they've never been able to get rid of it because it's"
00:19:38,00:19:42,so big but it's also next to a load of train tracks and apartment buildings so they can't
00:19:42,00:19:43,blow it up.
00:19:43,00:19:44,"Oh, wow."
00:19:44,00:19:46,So it's kind of just stuck there as a memory.
00:19:46,00:19:48,"Yeah, 12,000 tons cylinder."
00:19:48,00:19:51,"12,650 tons concrete cylinder."
00:19:51,00:19:52,That feels big.
00:19:52,00:19:53,It does count it.
00:19:53,00:19:57,I think it's empty on the inside because I think you can go and visit it and have a look
00:19:57,00:19:58,inside.
00:19:58,00:19:59,Wow.
00:19:59,00:20:00,You should do a podcast there.
00:20:00,00:20:01,That.
00:20:01,00:20:02,Do you think the acoustics will be...
00:20:02,00:20:03,That's going to be echoey though.
00:20:03,00:20:04,I think...
00:20:04,00:20:11,"Yes, that's the reason why we shouldn't go and do a podcast in the last piece of Nazi architecture."
00:20:11,00:20:12,Obviously...
00:20:12,00:20:14,"Obviously, reasons of taste."
00:20:14,00:20:16,"Obviously, reasons of taste."
00:20:16,00:20:19,Do you remember the last time we played...
00:20:19,00:20:24,"Well, the only time we played Berlin was in that big hall and it was used as a rock and roll"
00:20:24,00:20:25,hall.
00:20:25,00:20:26,Yes.
00:20:26,00:20:29,They hadn't had anyone do a speaking gig in there.
00:20:29,00:20:32,"So like all the chairs were set up and I was talking to the guy and saying, ""So sound"
00:20:32,00:20:33,"guy or something."""
00:20:33,00:20:34,Yeah.
00:20:34,00:20:35,So you don't do...
00:20:35,00:20:36,What?
00:20:36,00:20:37,We're a new concept here.
00:20:37,00:20:38,As a speaking thing.
00:20:38,00:20:39,"As opposed to a gig and you went, ""Yeah."""
00:20:39,00:20:42,"And I said, ""So what wins the last time you had someone do a talk here?"""
00:20:42,00:20:44,"And you went, ""Gurbles?"""
00:20:44,00:20:47,I remember that.
00:20:47,00:20:48,"We followed ""Gurbles."""
00:20:48,00:20:49,"Yeah, I love that."
00:20:49,00:20:50,Why is it so silent?
00:20:50,00:20:51,I don't love that.
00:20:51,00:20:52,Sorry.
00:20:52,00:20:53,I love that.
00:20:53,00:20:54,Oh gosh.
00:20:54,00:20:56,I've got one last one.
00:20:56,00:20:57,Okay.
00:20:57,00:20:58,Yeah.
00:20:58,00:20:59,"This is from Josh Smith, who..."
00:20:59,00:21:06,I don't know why I picked this as my last factory now because it's quite of a truce.
00:21:06,00:21:10,It's about steam-exploded donkey bone powder.
00:21:10,00:21:11,Oh.
00:21:11,00:21:14,This is just a mad thing that you can make donkeys into.
00:21:14,00:21:17,"Basically, donkey bone is about a tenth of the donkey, but most people don't use it for"
00:21:17,00:21:18,"anything, right?"
00:21:18,00:21:19,Okay.
00:21:19,00:21:20,A tenth of a donkey is bone.
00:21:20,00:21:21,Really?
00:21:21,00:21:22,Yeah.
00:21:22,00:21:23,"That's a pretty amazing fact, isn't it?"
00:21:23,00:21:24,It's about 50%.
00:21:24,00:21:25,It's about 50%.
00:21:25,00:21:28,If they're in space and it's not.
00:21:28,00:21:29,How much of us are bone?
00:21:29,00:21:31,"Oh, probably about 10%."
00:21:31,00:21:32,Really?
00:21:32,00:21:33,I don't know.
00:21:33,00:21:34,Amazing.
00:21:34,00:21:35,I don't know.
00:21:35,00:21:36,You're right.
00:21:36,00:21:38,I feel like mine's less than 10%.
00:21:38,00:21:39,No.
00:21:39,00:21:40,Do you?
00:21:40,00:21:41,"I do think that, yeah."
00:21:41,00:21:42,Maybe a bit of that.
00:21:42,00:21:43,"Maybe a bit of that, yeah."
00:21:43,00:21:46,"I think, like, let's round up my weight to 100 kilos, I don't weigh 100 kilos, but let's"
00:21:46,00:21:47,round it up.
00:21:47,00:21:51,"If I take all my bones out, are they going to be too heavy to take us, have them luggage"
00:21:51,00:21:52,on Ryanair?
00:21:52,00:21:53,Oh.
00:21:53,00:21:54,That is a very...
00:21:54,00:21:56,Let's test it out.
00:21:56,00:21:57,I think we have to.
00:21:57,00:21:58,Yeah.
00:21:58,00:21:59,Don't write in.
00:21:59,00:22:00,I don't know what the level of Ryanair...
00:22:00,00:22:01,Welcome to Mythbusters.
00:22:01,00:22:02,"Well, we are going..."
00:22:02,00:22:04,We haven't checked the stuff.
00:22:04,00:22:09,We've just taken out almost all his bones and now we're at Gatwick.
00:22:09,00:22:13,James' will reading is going to be amazing.
00:22:13,00:22:22,"And my bones, I leave too, along with two tickets to Lanzarote to visit the other rugby union"
00:22:22,00:22:26,based chapel in France.
00:22:26,00:22:30,So ends the will of the human ball.
00:22:30,00:22:34,"So basically, anyway, yeah, 10% of donkey is bone and it's good stuff."
00:22:34,00:22:37,"There's a lot of good stuff in there, nutritious, but it's very hard to get to because every"
00:22:37,00:22:38,den is very strong.
00:22:38,00:22:40,There's a donkey around there.
00:22:40,00:22:41,All sorts of reasons.
00:22:41,00:22:45,"This is why you were fired as a taskmaster, Charlie Dryder."
00:22:45,00:22:53,Do you pull on this donkey and you've got 30 minutes to do it?
00:22:53,00:22:57,"But basically, to use it, you know, if you are going to kill an animal, you may as well"
00:22:57,00:22:58,use absolutely everything it has.
00:22:58,00:22:59,"Oh, yeah."
00:22:59,00:23:01,"It's, you know, it's an important thing to do."
00:23:01,00:23:03,You need to crush it to a powder.
00:23:03,00:23:08,"And one thing you can do is do steam explosion, where you basically use high pressure steam"
00:23:08,00:23:12,"to kind of reduce it to a powder, you sort of blast it."
00:23:12,00:23:15,"This is a Chinese study because Charlie gets through a lot of donkeys, as I think we did"
00:23:15,00:23:16,in the podcast a few months ago.
00:23:16,00:23:17,Didn't we?
00:23:17,00:23:18,"Yeah, they're running out."
00:23:18,00:23:19,"Right, they're running out."
00:23:19,00:23:21,"In fact, they're using up everyone else's donkeys and they're running out of them."
00:23:21,00:23:22,There's a problem.
00:23:22,00:23:23,Wow.
00:23:23,00:23:27,"Not helped by the use of steam exploded donkey bone powder, but it turns out that when"
00:23:27,00:23:33,"you bake cookies using steam exploded donkey bone powder instead of flour, they're rated"
00:23:33,00:23:39,"very highly by participants, like people tasting these cookies, which are one third donkey"
00:23:39,00:23:41,"bone powder instead of flour, say, oh, that's delicious."
00:23:41,00:23:42,Really?
00:23:42,00:23:43,Yeah.
00:23:43,00:23:47,"And does it maybe contain like, well, marrow stuff, so it might be okay for you."
00:23:47,00:23:51,"It might, it might, I mean, it sounds like in terms of flavor, odour and overall acceptability."
00:23:51,00:23:56,"This was a Chinese study, so it might be culturally specific, but turns out that might be what"
00:23:56,00:24:02,you're missing in your next bake is a little bit of the old steam exploded donkey bone powder.
00:24:02,00:24:03,"Give that a miss, I think."
00:24:03,00:24:04,Okay.
00:24:04,00:24:05,"Thanks, though."
00:24:05,00:24:06,Yeah.
00:24:06,00:24:07,Okay.
00:24:07,00:24:12,"Before we wrap up this first episode of Little Fish, we are now going to do something that"
00:24:12,00:24:15,"is going to be appearing at the end of every single episode, which is, if you were part"
00:24:15,00:24:21,"of the friend of the podcast here on Club Fish, as part of your membership, you are going"
00:24:21,00:24:27,"to become the custodian of one of the facts, one of the headline facts from the 600 plus"
00:24:27,00:24:30,episodes of no such thing as a fish.
00:24:30,00:24:33,And we will give you a shout out to let you know what your fact is.
00:24:33,00:24:40,And we'll also be sending you a digital certificate to acknowledge it in writing forever on.
00:24:40,00:24:41,You can put it on the wall.
00:24:41,00:24:42,You can do whatever you want.
00:24:42,00:24:44,"And this is an honor that cannot be stripped away, right?"
00:24:44,00:24:45,This isn't like a...
00:24:45,00:24:46,I don't know.
00:24:46,00:24:52,"I think if you do something really bad, like really, really bad, if you're a knight of the"
00:24:52,00:24:56,"realm, and you do something really awful, they can take it off you."
00:24:56,00:24:57,Okay.
00:24:57,00:25:00,This digital certificate is now your moral compass.
00:25:00,00:25:06,"You need to behave like a person with a digital certificate would, which is a good person,"
00:25:06,00:25:07,a good human.
00:25:07,00:25:10,I don't want the police like knocking down someone's dark as they've done some terrible
00:25:10,00:25:11,deed.
00:25:11,00:25:18,I think the police see on the wall as a custodian of episode 453 of no six things of fish.
00:25:18,00:25:19,That's the last thing we need.
00:25:19,00:25:22,"We'll then ask us questions, and they'll see how does this go all the way to the top of"
00:25:22,00:25:23,most of things of fish.
00:25:23,00:25:24,"Yeah, yeah."
00:25:24,00:25:25,Yeah.
00:25:25,00:25:29,"I think we should say as well, a little bit of the theory behind it, which is that these"
00:25:29,00:25:31,"facts, they're endangered."
00:25:31,00:25:32,Some of them.
00:25:32,00:25:33,They need support.
00:25:33,00:25:34,Yeah.
00:25:34,00:25:35,Many of them are true.
00:25:35,00:25:36,Some of them.
00:25:36,00:25:37,Yep.
00:25:37,00:25:48,"Oh, Dan's James isn't out of the truth."
00:25:48,00:25:51,"Imagine if the police are trying to arrest a murderer, they bang down the door, they open"
00:25:51,00:25:56,"the door, they look on the wall, they go, oh, did you know that the largest ridiculous railway"
00:25:56,00:26:01,"in Swaziland is called Derek, and then while they're doing that, someone's run away."
00:26:01,00:26:02,Okay.
00:26:02,00:26:07,"So use us as a decoy, do what you want with it."
00:26:07,00:26:09,It's a lovely certificate.
00:26:09,00:26:13,"And so yeah, why don't we, because we haven't actually launched the tiers yet, why not give"
00:26:13,00:26:19,"ourselves an honorary fact each that we will be the custodians of, and we should say please"
00:26:19,00:26:23,"join Club Fisher at the front of the podcast, too, because if nobody has joined front of"
00:26:23,00:26:25,"the podcast, we're going to have to do that again."
00:26:25,00:26:26,That's great.
00:26:26,00:26:28,And we're going to look really stupid.
00:26:28,00:26:33,"Okay, so the way we're going to do it is we're going to be allocating members in sequence"
00:26:33,00:26:35,in a very particular order.
00:26:35,00:26:41,So the first fact is now going to be allocated to Mr. James Harkin.
00:26:41,00:26:42,Thank you.
00:26:42,00:26:43,"James, please read us your facts."
00:26:43,00:26:46,"Sorry, I have first, I'd like to say a few words."
00:26:46,00:26:51,"I have an alibi for that night of the third, I was okay."
00:26:51,00:26:57,"So I am a custodian of fact number one in episode number one of nosy things a fish, which"
00:26:57,00:27:02,was that the large Hadron Collider had to be turned off because a bird dropped a bit of
00:27:02,00:27:03,forget into it.
00:27:03,00:27:04,It's stunning.
00:27:04,00:27:07,And what did I eat just before we came on air today?
00:27:07,00:27:08,A forget.
00:27:08,00:27:09,A bird.
00:27:09,00:27:11,Large Hadron.
00:27:11,00:27:18,"So yeah, I'm really honoured to be the custodian of that."
00:27:18,00:27:21,I promise to look after it well.
00:27:21,00:27:22,I feel.
00:27:22,00:27:27,"It feels good because it's a fact that can't be proven wrong, because it's a historical"
00:27:27,00:27:28,fact.
00:27:28,00:27:32,"It's happened, unless someone goes back in time, of course."
00:27:32,00:27:36,But you would need some sort of enormous physical laboratory to go back in time.
00:27:36,00:27:37,It's impossible.
00:27:37,00:27:39,"Okay, so that's James, congratulations James."
00:27:39,00:27:44,That's a very exciting fact and your digital certificate is on its way.
00:27:44,00:27:45,All right.
00:27:45,00:27:49,"So Anna's not with us today, but obviously Anna is getting her own fact and the second"
00:27:49,00:27:52,fact of the show was her fact.
00:27:52,00:27:58,"So for Anna, we will be allocating what is almost the classic fact of no such thing as a"
00:27:58,00:27:59,fish.
00:27:59,00:28:03,We're that it's the second one that we think is a classic almost like the first one was
00:28:03,00:28:04,a bit rubbish.
00:28:04,00:28:05,Hmm.
00:28:05,00:28:06,It's like a Star Wars films in that respect.
00:28:06,00:28:07,Yeah.
00:28:07,00:28:08,Carry on.
00:28:08,00:28:09,Yeah.
00:28:09,00:28:12,We want to be custodian of that first fact.
00:28:12,00:28:15,So this was Anna's fact for the last month of his life.
00:28:15,00:28:19,US President James Garfield ate everything through his anus.
00:28:19,00:28:20,Oh.
00:28:20,00:28:21,What a fact.
00:28:21,00:28:22,And Anna.
00:28:22,00:28:23,What a fact.
00:28:23,00:28:24,Your digital certificate.
00:28:24,00:28:25,We'll be on its way.
00:28:25,00:28:26,Done.
00:28:26,00:28:27,What about you?
00:28:27,00:28:28,Are you going to get a fact from this?
00:28:28,00:28:33,"I am going to get a fact, but if we're going to go sequential, we should assign each of our"
00:28:33,00:28:35,"own facts, I think, for this first episode to each other."
00:28:35,00:28:41,"So Andy, you're your next and your fact comes from James Harkin."
00:28:41,00:28:42,Yeah.
00:28:42,00:28:47,Didn't manage to get a fact into the episode one of no such thing as a fish.
00:28:47,00:28:48,Try for best.
00:28:48,00:28:52,"Oh, welcome."
00:28:52,00:28:54,James just had two good facts.
00:28:54,00:28:56,"This one, I think it's because it was a Franken show, right?"
00:28:56,00:28:57,It wasn't deliberate.
00:28:57,00:28:58,It wasn't deliberate.
00:28:58,00:28:59,"It wasn't deliberate, right?"
00:28:59,00:29:00,Ah.
00:29:00,00:29:01,Hard to say.
00:29:01,00:29:02,"So, yeah."
00:29:02,00:29:03,It's a good point.
00:29:03,00:29:07,"Like, we made a few shows and then in the edit, we edited again."
00:29:07,00:29:08,It was a pilot.
00:29:08,00:29:11,"Like, that episode was never meant to go out, but I'll happily take one of James's facts."
00:29:11,00:29:12,All right.
00:29:12,00:29:13,So what is it?
00:29:13,00:29:14,It's that.
00:29:14,00:29:16,"In 2013, six people in the USA named their child Mushroom."
00:29:16,00:29:17,Very nice.
00:29:17,00:29:18,Good fact.
00:29:18,00:29:20,"I wouldn't want to be associated with that fact anymore, actually."
00:29:20,00:29:21,Exactly.
00:29:21,00:29:22,Yeah.
00:29:22,00:29:24,"Did you hate mushrooms as much then as you did, as you do now?"
00:29:24,00:29:25,"It's been a whole life thing, though."
00:29:25,00:29:26,Right.
00:29:26,00:29:27,Yeah.
00:29:27,00:29:30,"For as young as I remember being, I did not like mushrooms."
00:29:30,00:29:33,"Maybe if you'd been named mushroom, you wouldn't now have that phobia."
00:29:33,00:29:37,"I probably would hate it more, because I can imagine the bullying I would have had a number"
00:29:37,00:29:40,"of people saying you're a fun guy, which you are."
00:29:40,00:29:44,"Yeah, but I feel like I would have become less and less fun over the years as people"
00:29:44,00:29:46,made that joke to me.
00:29:46,00:29:47,That's true.
00:29:47,00:29:48,Yeah.
00:29:48,00:29:49,That's understandable.
00:29:49,00:29:50,Yeah.
00:29:50,00:29:51,Okay.
00:29:51,00:29:53,"Well, those six people in the USA who were named Mushroom will now be 12."
00:29:53,00:29:54,"Oh, yeah."
00:29:54,00:29:55,Yes.
00:29:55,00:29:56,Years old.
00:29:56,00:29:57,"I mean, there would have doubled in size."
00:29:57,00:29:58,"Oh, no."
00:29:58,00:30:01,They may reproduce with spools.
00:30:01,00:30:02,We don't know.
00:30:02,00:30:07,"That's actually the age that a lot of people who come to our shows who are like kids, that's"
00:30:07,00:30:10,"when they start listening, usually around 12, isn't it?"
00:30:10,00:30:11,Yeah.
00:30:11,00:30:16,"Well, if you're in the USA and you are named Mushroom and you were born in 2013, do write"
00:30:16,00:30:17,in to podcast@goi.com.
00:30:17,00:30:23,"I wonder if it's gone up over the years, whether or not it'll be a popular name, but now you"
00:30:23,00:30:24,think so.
00:30:24,00:30:25,Yeah.
00:30:25,00:30:26,It's a nice popular name in the States.
00:30:26,00:30:27,Yeah.
00:30:27,00:30:28,Okay.
00:30:28,00:30:29,"Well, they go Andy."
00:30:29,00:30:30,Thank you very much.
00:30:30,00:30:31,You're official custodian.
00:30:31,00:30:32,I love it.
00:30:32,00:30:33,Of the mushroom fact.
00:30:33,00:30:37,Probably in a few years there will be lots of people named Mushroom after the cloud.
00:30:37,00:30:38,"Go, go."
00:30:38,00:30:39,All right.
00:30:39,00:30:41,Shall we assign mine?
00:30:41,00:30:46,"So my fact, this was the fourth fact of the very first episode is that Philippa"
00:30:46,00:30:52,"Langley, who found Richard III's bones with an amateur, but nonetheless saw him at a car"
00:30:52,00:30:56,"park beneath a huge R, and the bones were beneath there."
00:30:56,00:30:58,Could have done with an edit.
00:30:58,00:30:59,Yeah.
00:30:59,00:31:04,Apologies for anyone who is custodian of dance facts because we won't be able to fit them
00:31:04,00:31:07,on the certificate.
00:31:07,00:31:12,"I think at the time when I was typing up these episodes, I hadn't yet found my scrupulous"
00:31:12,00:31:15,methodology of writing the headline facts up in a really concise way.
