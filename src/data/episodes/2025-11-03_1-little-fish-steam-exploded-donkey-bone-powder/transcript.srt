00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,260
 Hey everyone, welcome to the very first episode of Little Fish.

2
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:22,320
 This is the show where instead of talking about our four favorite facts from the last seven

3
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:28,140
 days, we have gone through the podcast at qi.com inbox and selected your best facts.

4
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,820
 We're going to be doing this every Monday.

5
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:34,740
 So if you want to join and be part of this extra special Monday bonus episode, just send

6
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:38,180
 in your best facts and we'll be reading them out each week.

7
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:39,180
 So let's get into it.

8
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:41,300
 I'm sat here with James Harkin and Andrew Hunter Murray.

9
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,300
 Hello.

10
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,380
 And in no particular order, here we go.

11
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:45,380
 This is from Daveli.

12
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:50,300
 It's about an executive leaving a job at McDonald's UK after 18 months in post.

13
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,300
 Okay.

14
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:58,740
 And the reason it's a great fact is because her name is Zoe Hamburger.

15
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:01,980
 In fact, she was promoted within the McDonald's trucker.

16
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,420
 She's gone off to run McDonald's Netherlands.

17
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:06,980
 She said Hamburger has been my name my entire life.

18
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:10,480
 So as you can imagine, it has always made people do a bit of a double take.

19
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,020
 I've never heard of anyone else with that.

20
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:13,020
 I know.

21
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,020
 There's a comedian called Neil Hamburger.

22
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:16,020
 Is it his real name?

23
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,020
 No.

24
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:18,020
 That feels like it's not nice.

25
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:21,300
 It's not called Neil.

26
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:26,620
 I found a report on this from the Metro, which I just want to read a line from it.

27
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:33,380
 Despite her name being the beefy snack item, that is the best thing of our journalism

28
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:34,380
 isn't it?

29
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,380
 There's a name for it, I think.

30
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:36,380
 Second mentions.

31
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:40,500
 Second mentions where it's like a duck across the road.

32
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,500
 The waddling.

33
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:45,700
 The foul.

34
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,980
 Despite her name being the beefy snack item, she said her fate.

35
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:51,220
 The favourite menu McDonald's item is the double cheeseburger.

36
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:52,220
 Believe it or not.

37
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:53,220
 I do believe it.

38
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,140
 I absolutely believe it.

39
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,140
 Anyway.

40
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:57,140
 Yeah.

41
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,620
 Oh, that's really good.

42
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,620
 I do.

43
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,620
 So I guess her relatives or her ancestors came from Hamburg.

44
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,620
 Exactly.

45
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:04,620
 That's what it is.

46
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:05,620
 We don't really have names like it.

47
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:06,620
 Do we?

48
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:07,620
 We don't have sort of like Tony Scalcer.

49
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:08,620
 Do we?

50
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:09,620
 Oh, we do.

51
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:10,620
 Yeah.

52
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,620
 No, we absolutely do.

53
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:12,620
 Like Michael Bolton.

54
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:13,620
 Oh, yeah.

55
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,940
 But that's not because his real name is Bolton.

56
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:17,940
 He changed his name.

57
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:18,940
 What?

58
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:21,060
 Michael Bolton's real name is Michael Bolton.

59
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,060
 That's it.

60
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,060
 Yeah.

61
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,060
 There's been a news Bolton.

62
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,060
 Is that it?

63
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,060
 Yeah.

64
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,060
 He changed it.

65
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,060
 He changed it.

66
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:31,900
 But there are many people whose surname is the name of a town.

67
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:32,900
 Yes.

68
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:33,900
 Jack London.

69
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,900
 Sydney, Swini.

70
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:35,900
 Swini's not a place.

71
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:36,900
 There are the Sydney's.

72
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:37,900
 And you can put in.

73
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:38,900
 Yeah, but it's a first.

74
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:45,380
 But her relatives were in that 1970s cup show.

75
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:50,940
 I'm struggling to think of many UK plays of Jack London, you're absolutely right.

76
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,740
 The Earl of Bristol.

77
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:55,300
 Of course.

78
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,900
 I'm just actually struggling to think of place names at the moment.

79
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:03,940
 But 100% there are some surnames where it's where you came from.

80
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:09,540
 Like someone in English, Harris English, the golfer for instance, Sarah Brighton.

81
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:10,540
 She's a person.

82
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:11,540
 Oh, okay.

83
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:12,540
 Isn't she?

84
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:13,540
 Sarah Brightman.

85
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:14,540
 Okay.

86
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:15,540
 Okay, Dan.

87
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:16,540
 Keep going.

88
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:17,540
 Sorry.

89
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:18,540
 Maybe you will get one.

90
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,540
 Brooklyn Beckham.

91
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,540
 Oh god.

92
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:21,540
 Oh god.

93
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:28,100
 Anyway, just a little extra report on this from BM magazine, which actually stands for Business

94
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,100
 Matters.

95
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:32,060
 And not as I thought, bowel movement, um, you get that.

96
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,060
 You get that on charts.

97
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:36,420
 Hospital charts and things will say BM 3PM or whatever.

98
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:37,420
 BM.

99
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:41,460
 It's a very regular publication that line, isn't it?

100
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:44,500
 Really worrying if you haven't had an issue for two or three days of BM magazine.

101
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:48,300
 And you need to buy prunes, prunes, prunes quarterly.

102
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:55,260
 Um, but just they found a lovely extra detail, which is just hamburger has been succeeded

103
00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:00,820
 as chief, as UK chief restaurant officer by Patrick Gerber, who takes over responsibility

104
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:03,340
 for restaurant operations across the country.

105
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:07,900
 It is good that Gerber has no responsibility for the operations in France as his surname

106
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:11,100
 in French means to vomit or to puke in a slang context.

107
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,100
 Interesting.

108
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,100
 How good is that?

109
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,100
 That's BM magazine, delivery of the goods there.

110
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,100
 That's really good.

111
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,100
 Here's another thing about Gerber.

112
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:22,060
 I think I might have to cut this because I might be wrong, but I think it's a baby food company

113
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,580
 Gerber or an old one.

114
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:24,900
 They might not be around anymore.

115
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:25,900
 Right.

116
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:33,460
 And there was a famous thing where they issued some baby food in a country where everyone

117
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:37,540
 in that country, if you ever saw a picture on a packet of food that you would think that's

118
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:42,260
 what's inside the food and the baby food had a picture of a baby on it and everyone

119
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:46,900
 said that the country thought that this baby food was actually food made of babies.

120
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:47,900
 That's very good.

121
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:48,900
 I think.

122
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:49,900
 That's very what I used ago.

123
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:53,780
 I bought a bike for my son for Christmas and it had a picture of a baby riding the bike

124
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:54,780
 on the front.

125
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,740
 And on the box it did say baby not included.

126
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:58,740
 Yeah.

127
00:04:58,740 --> 00:04:59,740
 It's funny.

128
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,740
 Should we move on to our next slide, James?

129
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:02,740
 You got something?

130
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:03,740
 OK.

131
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:08,300
 This one is from Wayne Height, H-O-I-T. It looks like although it looks like a misspelling

132
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,300
 of halt.

133
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:12,860
 It's Height.

134
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,900
 Wayne says spiral staircases are not spirals.

135
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:16,900
 Okay.

136
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:17,900
 Okay.

137
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:18,900
 Point of information.

138
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:19,900
 Yeah.

139
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:20,900
 Sure they are.

140
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:24,740
 Well, he says that although they are cold spiral, they are actually helical.

141
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:25,740
 They are helixes.

142
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:30,380
 A real spiral twists with an increasing or decreasing radius.

143
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:36,220
 For example, a spiral on or he doesn't say this, but for instance on a snail shell, you

144
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,220
 know.

145
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:42,900
 Kind of goes out like that, but a staircase always has the same radius.

146
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,300
 Like it's not getting wider as you go up.

147
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,300
 No.

148
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,300
 Is it?

149
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:50,220
 It's always going to be about the same width at the bottom as it is at the top.

150
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,220
 Right.

151
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:56,660
 And if you, a helix is basically something, a line which you draw around a cylinder.

152
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,780
 Right.

153
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:02,460
 And he says, I guess they're called spiral because unfortunately most people have no idea

154
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,780
 what a helix is.

155
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,740
 But I think people know what, like double helix.

156
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:07,740
 They're famous.

157
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:08,740
 Yeah.

158
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:09,740
 DNA fame.

159
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:14,340
 So are there any actually spiral staircases where the building gets wider and wider and wider?

160
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:20,380
 Well, here's the, here's the interesting or probably not very interesting point.

161
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,820
 Some people say that a helix is a type of spiral.

162
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:26,940
 Other people say, no, they're completely different things.

163
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:31,220
 And there doesn't seem to be an international body that decides on what a spiral in a helix

164
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,220
 is.

165
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,220
 Wow.

166
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:36,860
 I think we have run this on QI actually many, maybe in the age series.

167
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:40,060
 I think we might have done it on their helixes.

168
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:45,220
 But yeah, we, we have discussed it before and almost come to blows in the QI office.

169
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:46,980
 James, you're the mathematician.

170
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:49,060
 I think out of the three of us, you get to make the call.

171
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:54,860
 I actually, you know at QI, we have a much better mathematician than I am, who's Will Bowen.

172
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:59,060
 And I think he landed on the side of a helix and spiral being different.

173
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,460
 So I think that's why we ran with it.

174
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:05,740
 But the other thing that we found when we were researching that was a place called Shator

175
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,860
 du Shambore in France.

176
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:11,940
 And they have a double helix staircase, okay.

177
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:18,020
 So it's two helixes, two separate, separate staircases, and what that means is, you can go

178
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:22,060
 up one staircase while someone else is coming down the other staircase.

179
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:25,980
 So you don't use up any more space because it's still on the same cylinder, but actually

180
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:31,420
 two people can go and according to the people who run that house, that stately home, it

181
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:36,020
 was designed by Leonardo da Vinci, although we're not quite sure if it belongs.

182
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:39,540
 Wouldn't it be great if you met the love of your life while you were going down and she was

183
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,540
 coming up?

184
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,540
 What do you, you don't meet her?

185
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:45,740
 Oh, you would never, that's the point about this, that's the whole point of this staircase

186
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:46,740
 is, isn't it?

187
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:49,620
 There's one helix going up on the other one coming down.

188
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:50,620
 You'd never meet.

189
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,620
 You'd never meet.

190
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:52,620
 You wake up.

191
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:53,620
 It was all a dream.

192
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,620
 Your whole life down.

193
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:55,620
 Your lovely wife and your family.

194
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,620
 Oh my God.

195
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:57,620
 They're not tunnels though.

196
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:58,620
 You can see each other going down the steps and going up.

197
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,620
 You can't.

198
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,620
 You can't, okay.

199
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:05,740
 Remember there was some Duke or something who had a lot of tunnels made in his house so

200
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,420
 that he never saw his staff.

201
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,420
 Yes.

202
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,420
 I remember that.

203
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,420
 He was nicknamed the tunneling Duke.

204
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:14,820
 It's a good, it's a good, had a bad nickname, isn't it?

205
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:19,860
 I've always wanted to go to Cambridge, there's a very specific pub that serves a double helix

206
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,100
 beer or ale.

207
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,900
 Oh, is it a spread eagle?

208
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:23,900
 Yeah, it must be.

209
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:28,140
 It's because it's where the two of them came in, Watson and Crick announced that they'd

210
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,900
 found the secret to life.

211
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,460
 Imagine walking into a pub.

212
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:36,260
 Imagine I walk into the bow of my arms in Bolton and I just walk in and I go, "I've discovered

213
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,780
 the secret of life."

214
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:43,860
 People would, I mean, they'd give me short shrift anyway, but also it's pronounced Bolton,

215
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:44,860
 by the way.

216
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,980
 Shall we move on to another fact?

217
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:47,980
 All right.

218
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:50,180
 This comes from Charlie Wakefield.

219
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,340
 Can I just say Wakefield in Yorkshire?

220
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,340
 Well, there we go.

221
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,340
 Great.

222
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,340
 There we go.

223
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,340
 Oh, damn.

224
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:58,220
 That was right there for you and James snuck in there and got it.

225
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:01,700
 I am a fellow TV person who's been working in development for over a decade, so I've

226
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:05,460
 discovered hundreds of fish were the facts, but there's one that has always stayed with

227
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,460
 me.

228
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:10,300
 Astronauts, in space, still get morning wood.

229
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:14,860
 Sadly, I found this years and years ago in a paper by NASA, I think, but clearly I was

230
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:18,700
 much better researcher back in the day because I've been unable to find it again.

231
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:24,700
 And they all have that problem as a gal.

232
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,460
 That's NASA's suppressing the truth, isn't it?

233
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:29,540
 No, I mean, there is stuff that you can see out there.

234
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:33,060
 This is an interesting thing that they actually have to work on because we're planning voyages

235
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,780
 to Mars and so on.

236
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,260
 And what does it do to you?

237
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:39,900
 Hang on, don't astronauts go through the 17 mornings a day because you're spinning around

238
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:40,900
 the world.

239
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:41,900
 Really fast.

240
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:42,900
 That's a good idea.

241
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:43,900
 I can fight.

242
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:44,900
 Yeah.

243
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:45,900
 Quickly hide.

244
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:46,900
 Yeah.

245
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:50,460
 So, basically, there's lots of things that they're looking into.

246
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:55,500
 For example, cosmic rays, what happens to your body and microgravity.

247
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:59,880
 So when you're in the ISS, from what I've been reading, it says that the blood will often

248
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,980
 travel sort of to where your chest area.

249
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:06,020
 So you don't have much blood down in that area to begin with.

250
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:11,100
 So would you be getting a sort of random morning wood is the question.

251
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:15,020
 And because we don't know if anyone's had sex up there, we don't know if anyone has had

252
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,020
 a little fiddle up there.

253
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,980
 We don't know what's been going on up there.

254
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:21,860
 There is a rumor that a couple ones up there, isn't there?

255
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:22,860
 Yeah.

256
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:23,860
 Exactly.

257
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:29,580
 So, you don't get an erection when your penis is the lowest part of your body.

258
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:35,060
 It's not like the blood rushes down there with no vasculatory system to push it around.

259
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,060
 Yeah.

260
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,620
 You know, it's like gravity shouldn't make that much of a difference, okay?

261
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:39,620
 I see.

262
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:44,060
 I don't think they think it's a massive influence, but they think it has some influence.

263
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,060
 Right.

264
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,060
 Yeah.

265
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,060
 Is that why your penis is so far down?

266
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:50,300
 Do you think as we evolve our penis is going to get lower and lower and lower?

267
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,300
 Absolutely.

268
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:54,380
 And just use the gravity to get the blood down there.

269
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,380
 Absolutely.

270
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:58,900
 Yeah, the end up being one of our toes.

271
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:02,300
 So I was trying to find if there was any evidence of an astronaut having mentioned this.

272
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:08,020
 And I did manage to find one astronaut Mike Malayne in 2014 in an interview with Men's

273
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:13,740
 Health said a couple of times I would wake up from sleep periods and I had a boner that

274
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,660
 could have drilled through kryptonite.

275
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:16,660
 Wow.

276
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:17,660
 That's an astronaut.

277
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:22,300
 That's a lot of superman fires.

278
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,740
 Very confident astronauts, aren't they?

279
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:25,740
 That's stunning.

280
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:26,740
 Yeah.

281
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,740
 So that's the one.

282
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:28,740
 That's the one.

283
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:29,740
 Maybe that's what you read.

284
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:33,540
 I think it's like, basically, Superman is in a cage, which is made of kryptonite.

285
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:34,540
 Yeah.

286
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:35,740
 I think that even happens in the latest one.

287
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:36,740
 Oh, really?

288
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:37,740
 That came out this year.

289
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:44,340
 But what you need is this guy to drill through kryptonite cage to free him.

290
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,340
 Yeah.

291
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,340
 Mike Malayne.

292
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:49,180
 Human bore.

293
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:59,020
 Which is better than the human born nickname than I have.

294
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,900
 I promise you this is a coincidence.

295
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:06,380
 But my next one is by Lindy Hardstaff.

296
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:11,940
 And Lindy says, my fight is you can hear a reflezier flower bloom before you can smell

297
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,820
 it.

298
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:18,420
 So you know the reflezier is the big corpse flower that you get in Southeast Asia and

299
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:23,500
 any kind of flowers once every few years, maybe, but apparently the petals are so big and

300
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:29,500
 thick and leathery that each one makes an audible thwack noise as they crack open.

301
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:34,140
 And Lindy Hardstaff discovered this when doing an overnight shift, monitoring a blooming

302
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:40,100
 event at the bog, Bogor, not Bogna, how you're shooting Bogor, Botanic Gardens in 2012.

303
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,620
 I've never heard of Bogor.

304
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:42,620
 That's so cool.

305
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:48,460
 I was nearly, I nearly got to see one of those flowers blooming when we were on tour in

306
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:49,460
 Melbourne.

307
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:50,460
 Oh.

308
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:55,260
 There was a, there was a museum and it was about a two hour drive out of Melbourne, I think.

309
00:12:55,260 --> 00:13:00,340
 And it had one on display, one of these amazing corpse flowers that opens up once every ten

310
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:01,660
 years or whatever it is.

311
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,060
 And it was just flowering that day.

312
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,260
 How long did you miss it by?

313
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,940
 Oh, I could have got to it.

314
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:06,940
 Oh, so you, okay.

315
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,100
 I comfortably could have got to it.

316
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,100
 I tried this not to.

317
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,100
 Oh, wow.

318
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,100
 I was busy.

319
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,100
 I was in Melbourne with my friend.

320
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:19,340
 That reminds me of the world laziness championships that I was supposed to go to this year and decided

321
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,500
 that the weather wasn't very good.

322
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,220
 So I'd go the next day and when I got there, it had finished.

323
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,140
 Everyone would stood up by the time you got there.

324
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,140
 Yeah.

325
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,140
 Are you serious?

326
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,140
 I can't tell if you're serious.

327
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,140
 That really happened.

328
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,140
 Yeah.

329
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,140
 It's, who could lay down the longest?

330
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,140
 Is this Montenegro?

331
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,140
 It's a Montenegro.

332
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,300
 It's called the world lazy citizen competition.

333
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:38,980
 And I missed the end of it because I couldn't be bothered leaving, but the weather was bad.

334
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:39,980
 That's so good.

335
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:42,620
 The lead way, I feel like you should have won the competition.

336
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:46,460
 I feel like I'm going to write to the organizers and ask for a special award.

337
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:47,460
 Yeah.

338
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,460
 That's good.

339
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:52,100
 Someone travelled all the way over from the UK only to miss it out of laziness.

340
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:55,260
 Well, I'm quite annoyed because I did email them saying, "Can I come along?"

341
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,260
 And they said, "Yes."

342
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:59,220
 And I told them what they had come and they didn't email me to say it had finished.

343
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,620
 What were you expecting, James?

344
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,580
 What were you expecting from the world laziness people?

345
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,580
 A roar-hour drive.

346
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:04,580
 A roar-hour drive.

347
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,060
 A roar-hour drive.

348
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,060
 Into the mountains.

349
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,860
 You couldn't be bothered to reply.

350
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:09,860
 That's all.

351
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:15,900
 So go to a church once, that you drove out of your way, forced to Palina to come with you, too.

352
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:20,900
 I went, there are two rugby union themed churches in France.

353
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:24,820
 And I'd been to one of them and the other one was only a three and a half hour drive away.

354
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,900
 And when we got there, it was closed.

355
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:27,900
 Yeah.

356
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:28,900
 Unbelievable question.

357
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,940
 A rugby union themed church.

358
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:31,940
 Yeah.

359
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:32,940
 What's that?

360
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:38,580
 It's a small chapel where people who are rugby union fans can go and they put like some

361
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:41,420
 other shirts there and pray for their team to do well.

362
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,420
 Oh, okay.

363
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:46,340
 And also actually one of the stained glass windows is themed on rugby union as well.

364
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:49,900
 And the priest throws the community away from backwards into your mouth.

365
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:50,900
 Very good.

366
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:51,900
 Yep.

367
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:58,260
 And when you go and get the way for everyone puts their head in between the person in front slags.

368
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,140
 Are you having been back, presumably?

369
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,900
 No, I can't imagine I ever will.

370
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:02,900
 Ah, it's such a shame.

371
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:03,900
 I had that same experience.

372
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:08,420
 I went down to Yovl Junction train station to go see your haunted buffet.

373
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:12,460
 And supposedly the sausages levitate and so on.

374
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:13,460
 I did.

375
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,460
 And I went on a Sunday.

376
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,460
 It was my only chance.

377
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:18,020
 And I had to explain to Finneller and the kids like Daddy's going to go off.

378
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,780
 I've got to do this thing.

379
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:20,780
 Long journey.

380
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:21,780
 I was in London.

381
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:22,780
 Got there.

382
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:23,780
 London to Yovl.

383
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:24,780
 Yeah.

384
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:25,780
 Did you know where Yovl was at the time?

385
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:26,780
 Oh, I did have a brief look at it.

386
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:27,780
 Yeah.

387
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:28,780
 Yeah.

388
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:29,780
 It's a distance.

389
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:30,780
 It's a distance.

390
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:31,780
 Anyway, Cap, I wish I couldn't get in.

391
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:32,780
 Look through the windows.

392
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:33,780
 Couldn't see anything.

393
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:34,780
 You imagine if you'd look through the windows.

394
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:40,420
 You could see a levitating sausage, you couldn't get any further towards it.

395
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,420
 Yeah.

396
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:42,420
 Maybe that would have been worse.

397
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,420
 Yeah.

398
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:44,420
 The sausages weren't even out.

399
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:45,420
 Two levitate.

400
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,420
 Okay.

401
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,420
 Andy.

402
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,420
 Okay.

403
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,020
 Here's one from David Morgan from Sydney.

404
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:54,300
 This is about Sir Henry Parks, premier of New South Wales in the 19th century.

405
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,300
 Oh.

406
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:58,740
 Australia's father of federation who got the ball rolling on the six British colonies

407
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,740
 in Australia, joining together to form a country.

408
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,060
 So he campaigned for this.

409
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,060
 Right.

410
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:07,660
 That's not that's sort of person.

411
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:08,900
 That's the business end of his life.

412
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:13,260
 But David Morgan is writing to tell us that he was also in the Australian parlance, a mad

413
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,300
 keen router.

414
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,380
 Oh, no.

415
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:21,420
 He was married three times, fathering 12 children with the first Lady Parks.

416
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:25,140
 And after a 22-year gap, five more with the second Lady Parks.

417
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,140
 Wow.

418
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,140
 17 children.

419
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,140
 17.

420
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:31,220
 The first three were born out of wedlock while the first Lady Parks was still alive.

421
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,460
 She had been his housemate.

422
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:35,060
 Dinner in the 1890s when Parks was nearly 80.

423
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:39,940
 The editor of the Sydney Morning Herald innocently remarked, "These oysters are good."

424
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:43,460
 Parks replied, "I don't need these adventitious aides.

425
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:46,860
 Lady Parks and I, until quite recently, have been in the habit of having connections 17

426
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,820
 or 18 times every night.

427
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:51,300
 And we now have connection 10 or 11 times daily."

428
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,300
 Partly recreation.

429
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,300
 [LAUGHTER]

430
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,300
 Super.

431
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:59,780
 Conor was very quiet though the editor for the rest of the dinner.

432
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:03,980
 Next later made a splendid speech full of elevated thought and moving language.

433
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:04,980
 There you go.

434
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:11,340
 I've got to say, all cultures around the world, I completely appreciate and I think people

435
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:14,780
 should be able to do whatever they want, whatever they're from and I would never take

436
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:19,220
 the piss out of anyone or say that anyone around the world is wrong in any way for what

437
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,220
 they do.

438
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:24,060
 But the word root to mean have sex does not sit well with me.

439
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,060
 Oh, really?

440
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,060
 Interesting.

441
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:29,340
 Well, maybe you'd like what Parks did as his first job because I did a little bit of

442
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,340
 extra digging on him.

443
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:36,340
 He was born in Warwickshire actually in England and his first job was as a bone-turner, which

444
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:42,220
 is kind of someone who I think shizzles and chips and shakes bone and ivory.

445
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:44,220
 I think it's that.

446
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:47,340
 Did you use root in UK to mean sex?

447
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,020
 No, that would not mean that.

448
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,020
 It would not mean it here.

449
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:52,860
 Okay, so a rooter is something you use to connect to the internet.

450
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:53,860
 Yes.

451
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,860
 Or Joe roots the English cricketer.

452
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:56,860
 Right, okay.

453
00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:01,140
 Okay, so who has never scored a century in Australia at time of recording?

454
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:05,140
 He's busy, isn't he?

455
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:08,780
 Probably so many misunderstandings, whenever he says his name anywhere.

456
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:09,780
 Yeah.

457
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:10,980
 James, when we're good at you?

458
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:13,780
 James, yes, that's the name of the person who wrote in.

459
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:17,620
 They didn't put their surname just James and they wrote, "Long time, listen, a first

460
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:18,620
 time caller.

461
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,420
 Hopefully you haven't heard this back before.

462
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:28,140
 The last piece of Nazi architecture in Berlin is a 12,650 ton concrete cylinder."

463
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,140
 Nice.

464
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:39,620
 Okay, so this is the Schwurbelastungschupper, meaning heavy load-exerting body and it was used

465
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:44,220
 to test whether the ground would be strong enough for all the amazing projects that they wanted

466
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,020
 to build in Berlin.

467
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:53,040
 So they wanted to do like a big arch to celebrate the glorious victory in World War II and they

468
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:57,140
 thought we could only do this arch if we have strong enough ground.

469
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:01,140
 So they built this big cylinder that was really, really heavy to see if the ground was strong

470
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:07,380
 enough to hold it and it turns out that Berlin is a massive swamp and really you couldn't

471
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:10,980
 put a big arch there, but then they also couldn't move it because it was too big.

472
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,580
 No, I'm still there.

473
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:13,580
 So they...

474
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:16,140
 That's bad planning in two ways.

475
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:20,220
 Firstly you should know that you're on a swamp and secondly you should not put anything

476
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,220
 in without having a plan to take it out again.

477
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:29,500
 I think nobody accuses the Nazis of being 100% in their plans.

478
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,500
 They've had one or two flubs in their time.

479
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,500
 Yeah, true, yeah.

480
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,860
 A second Russia.

481
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:38,300
 But yeah, and the thing is that they've never been able to get rid of it because it's

482
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:42,860
 so big but it's also next to a load of train tracks and apartment buildings so they can't

483
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:43,860
 blow it up.

484
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:44,860
 Oh, wow.

485
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:46,620
 So it's kind of just stuck there as a memory.

486
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,820
 Yeah, 12,000 tons cylinder.

487
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,820
 12,650 tons concrete cylinder.

488
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:52,820
 That feels big.

489
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:53,820
 It does count it.

490
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:57,700
 I think it's empty on the inside because I think you can go and visit it and have a look

491
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:58,700
 inside.

492
00:19:58,700 --> 00:19:59,700
 Wow.

493
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,700
 You should do a podcast there.

494
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,700
 That.

495
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,700
 Do you think the acoustics will be...

496
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,700
 That's going to be echoey though.

497
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:04,700
 I think...

498
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:11,180
 Yes, that's the reason why we shouldn't go and do a podcast in the last piece of Nazi architecture.

499
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,180
 Obviously...

500
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,740
 Obviously, reasons of taste.

501
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,980
 Obviously, reasons of taste.

502
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,140
 Do you remember the last time we played...

503
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:24,460
 Well, the only time we played Berlin was in that big hall and it was used as a rock and roll

504
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:25,460
 hall.

505
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,460
 Yes.

506
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:29,420
 They hadn't had anyone do a speaking gig in there.

507
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:32,700
 So like all the chairs were set up and I was talking to the guy and saying, "So sound

508
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,700
 guy or something."

509
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:34,700
 Yeah.

510
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,700
 So you don't do...

511
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,700
 What?

512
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,700
 We're a new concept here.

513
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,700
 As a speaking thing.

514
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,700
 As opposed to a gig and you went, "Yeah."

515
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,820
 And I said, "So what wins the last time you had someone do a talk here?"

516
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:44,820
 And you went, "Gurbles?"

517
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:47,020
 I remember that.

518
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,700
 We followed "Gurbles."

519
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:49,700
 Yeah, I love that.

520
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:50,700
 Why is it so silent?

521
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,700
 I don't love that.

522
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,700
 Sorry.

523
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:53,700
 I love that.

524
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:54,700
 Oh gosh.

525
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,700
 I've got one last one.

526
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:57,700
 Okay.

527
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:58,700
 Yeah.

528
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,700
 This is from Josh Smith, who...

529
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:06,740
 I don't know why I picked this as my last factory now because it's quite of a truce.

530
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:10,220
 It's about steam-exploded donkey bone powder.

531
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,220
 Oh.

532
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:14,220
 This is just a mad thing that you can make donkeys into.

533
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:17,860
 Basically, donkey bone is about a tenth of the donkey, but most people don't use it for

534
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:18,860
 anything, right?

535
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:19,860
 Okay.

536
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:20,860
 A tenth of a donkey is bone.

537
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:21,860
 Really?

538
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:22,860
 Yeah.

539
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:23,860
 That's a pretty amazing fact, isn't it?

540
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:24,860
 It's about 50%.

541
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:25,860
 It's about 50%.

542
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:28,460
 If they're in space and it's not.

543
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:29,460
 How much of us are bone?

544
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:31,260
 Oh, probably about 10%.

545
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,260
 Really?

546
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:33,260
 I don't know.

547
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,260
 Amazing.

548
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,260
 I don't know.

549
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,260
 You're right.

550
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:38,740
 I feel like mine's less than 10%.

551
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:39,740
 No.

552
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:40,740
 Do you?

553
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:41,740
 I do think that, yeah.

554
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:42,740
 Maybe a bit of that.

555
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:43,740
 Maybe a bit of that, yeah.

556
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:46,740
 I think, like, let's round up my weight to 100 kilos, I don't weigh 100 kilos, but let's

557
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:47,740
 round it up.

558
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:51,780
 If I take all my bones out, are they going to be too heavy to take us, have them luggage

559
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:52,780
 on Ryanair?

560
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:53,780
 Oh.

561
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:54,780
 That is a very...

562
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,780
 Let's test it out.

563
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:57,780
 I think we have to.

564
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:58,780
 Yeah.

565
00:21:58,780 --> 00:21:59,780
 Don't write in.

566
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:00,780
 I don't know what the level of Ryanair...

567
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:01,780
 Welcome to Mythbusters.

568
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:02,780
 Well, we are going...

569
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,780
 We haven't checked the stuff.

570
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:09,220
 We've just taken out almost all his bones and now we're at Gatwick.

571
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:13,020
 James' will reading is going to be amazing.

572
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:22,660
 And my bones, I leave too, along with two tickets to Lanzarote to visit the other rugby union

573
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:26,740
 based chapel in France.

574
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:30,860
 So ends the will of the human ball.

575
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:34,180
 So basically, anyway, yeah, 10% of donkey is bone and it's good stuff.

576
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:37,100
 There's a lot of good stuff in there, nutritious, but it's very hard to get to because every

577
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,100
 den is very strong.

578
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,100
 There's a donkey around there.

579
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,180
 All sorts of reasons.

580
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:45,540
 This is why you were fired as a taskmaster, Charlie Dryder.

581
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:53,980
 Do you pull on this donkey and you've got 30 minutes to do it?

582
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:57,060
 But basically, to use it, you know, if you are going to kill an animal, you may as well

583
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,860
 use absolutely everything it has.

584
00:22:58,860 --> 00:22:59,860
 Oh, yeah.

585
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:01,460
 It's, you know, it's an important thing to do.

586
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:03,220
 You need to crush it to a powder.

587
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:08,980
 And one thing you can do is do steam explosion, where you basically use high pressure steam

588
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:12,060
 to kind of reduce it to a powder, you sort of blast it.

589
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:15,740
 This is a Chinese study because Charlie gets through a lot of donkeys, as I think we did

590
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:16,740
 in the podcast a few months ago.

591
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:17,740
 Didn't we?

592
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:18,740
 Yeah, they're running out.

593
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:19,740
 Right, they're running out.

594
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,740
 In fact, they're using up everyone else's donkeys and they're running out of them.

595
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:22,740
 There's a problem.

596
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:23,740
 Wow.

597
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:27,060
 Not helped by the use of steam exploded donkey bone powder, but it turns out that when

598
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:33,780
 you bake cookies using steam exploded donkey bone powder instead of flour, they're rated

599
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:39,020
 very highly by participants, like people tasting these cookies, which are one third donkey

600
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:41,980
 bone powder instead of flour, say, oh, that's delicious.

601
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:42,980
 Really?

602
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:43,980
 Yeah.

603
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:47,140
 And does it maybe contain like, well, marrow stuff, so it might be okay for you.

604
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:51,900
 It might, it might, I mean, it sounds like in terms of flavor, odour and overall acceptability.

605
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:56,500
 This was a Chinese study, so it might be culturally specific, but turns out that might be what

606
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:02,500
 you're missing in your next bake is a little bit of the old steam exploded donkey bone powder.

607
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,500
 Give that a miss, I think.

608
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,500
 Okay.

609
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,500
 Thanks, though.

610
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,500
 Yeah.

611
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,500
 Okay.

612
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:12,180
 Before we wrap up this first episode of Little Fish, we are now going to do something that

613
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:15,900
 is going to be appearing at the end of every single episode, which is, if you were part

614
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:21,540
 of the friend of the podcast here on Club Fish, as part of your membership, you are going

615
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:27,380
 to become the custodian of one of the facts, one of the headline facts from the 600 plus

616
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:30,100
 episodes of no such thing as a fish.

617
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:33,700
 And we will give you a shout out to let you know what your fact is.

618
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:40,020
 And we'll also be sending you a digital certificate to acknowledge it in writing forever on.

619
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,700
 You can put it on the wall.

620
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:42,700
 You can do whatever you want.

621
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,980
 And this is an honor that cannot be stripped away, right?

622
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:45,980
 This isn't like a...

623
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:46,980
 I don't know.

624
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:52,500
 I think if you do something really bad, like really, really bad, if you're a knight of the

625
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:56,180
 realm, and you do something really awful, they can take it off you.

626
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,180
 Okay.

627
00:24:57,180 --> 00:25:00,340
 This digital certificate is now your moral compass.

628
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:06,260
 You need to behave like a person with a digital certificate would, which is a good person,

629
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:07,260
 a good human.

630
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:10,820
 I don't want the police like knocking down someone's dark as they've done some terrible

631
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:11,820
 deed.

632
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:18,060
 I think the police see on the wall as a custodian of episode 453 of no six things of fish.

633
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,060
 That's the last thing we need.

634
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:22,820
 We'll then ask us questions, and they'll see how does this go all the way to the top of

635
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:23,820
 most of things of fish.

636
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:24,820
 Yeah, yeah.

637
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:25,820
 Yeah.

638
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:29,020
 I think we should say as well, a little bit of the theory behind it, which is that these

639
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:31,500
 facts, they're endangered.

640
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,500
 Some of them.

641
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,500
 They need support.

642
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,500
 Yeah.

643
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,500
 Many of them are true.

644
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,500
 Some of them.

645
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,500
 Yep.

646
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:48,140
 Oh, Dan's James isn't out of the truth.

647
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:51,340
 Imagine if the police are trying to arrest a murderer, they bang down the door, they open

648
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:56,220
 the door, they look on the wall, they go, oh, did you know that the largest ridiculous railway

649
00:25:56,220 --> 00:26:01,980
 in Swaziland is called Derek, and then while they're doing that, someone's run away.

650
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:02,980
 Okay.

651
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:07,940
 So use us as a decoy, do what you want with it.

652
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,340
 It's a lovely certificate.

653
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:13,860
 And so yeah, why don't we, because we haven't actually launched the tiers yet, why not give

654
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:19,340
 ourselves an honorary fact each that we will be the custodians of, and we should say please

655
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:23,660
 join Club Fisher at the front of the podcast, too, because if nobody has joined front of

656
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,740
 the podcast, we're going to have to do that again.

657
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:26,740
 That's great.

658
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:28,460
 And we're going to look really stupid.

659
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:33,420
 Okay, so the way we're going to do it is we're going to be allocating members in sequence

660
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:35,420
 in a very particular order.

661
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:41,140
 So the first fact is now going to be allocated to Mr. James Harkin.

662
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:42,140
 Thank you.

663
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,140
 James, please read us your facts.

664
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:46,640
 Sorry, I have first, I'd like to say a few words.

665
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:51,540
 I have an alibi for that night of the third, I was okay.

666
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:57,940
 So I am a custodian of fact number one in episode number one of nosy things a fish, which

667
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:02,580
 was that the large Hadron Collider had to be turned off because a bird dropped a bit of

668
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:03,820
 forget into it.

669
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:04,820
 It's stunning.

670
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:07,620
 And what did I eat just before we came on air today?

671
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:08,620
 A forget.

672
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:09,620
 A bird.

673
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:11,620
 Large Hadron.

674
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:18,900
 So yeah, I'm really honoured to be the custodian of that.

675
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:21,100
 I promise to look after it well.

676
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,100
 I feel.

677
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:27,680
 It feels good because it's a fact that can't be proven wrong, because it's a historical

678
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,680
 fact.

679
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:32,300
 It's happened, unless someone goes back in time, of course.

680
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:36,260
 But you would need some sort of enormous physical laboratory to go back in time.

681
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:37,260
 It's impossible.

682
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:39,900
 Okay, so that's James, congratulations James.

683
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:44,420
 That's a very exciting fact and your digital certificate is on its way.

684
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:45,420
 All right.

685
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:49,860
 So Anna's not with us today, but obviously Anna is getting her own fact and the second

686
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:52,140
 fact of the show was her fact.

687
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:58,980
 So for Anna, we will be allocating what is almost the classic fact of no such thing as a

688
00:27:58,980 --> 00:27:59,980
 fish.

689
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:03,260
 We're that it's the second one that we think is a classic almost like the first one was

690
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:04,260
 a bit rubbish.

691
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:05,260
 Hmm.

692
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:06,620
 It's like a Star Wars films in that respect.

693
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:07,620
 Yeah.

694
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:08,620
 Carry on.

695
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:09,620
 Yeah.

696
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:12,120
 We want to be custodian of that first fact.

697
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:15,220
 So this was Anna's fact for the last month of his life.

698
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:19,460
 US President James Garfield ate everything through his anus.

699
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:20,460
 Oh.

700
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:21,460
 What a fact.

701
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:22,460
 And Anna.

702
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:23,460
 What a fact.

703
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:24,460
 Your digital certificate.

704
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,460
 We'll be on its way.

705
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:26,460
 Done.

706
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,460
 What about you?

707
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,980
 Are you going to get a fact from this?

708
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:33,060
 I am going to get a fact, but if we're going to go sequential, we should assign each of our

709
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:35,420
 own facts, I think, for this first episode to each other.

710
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:41,420
 So Andy, you're your next and your fact comes from James Harkin.

711
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,420
 Yeah.

712
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:47,360
 Didn't manage to get a fact into the episode one of no such thing as a fish.

713
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,360
 Try for best.

714
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:52,520
 Oh, welcome.

715
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,280
 James just had two good facts.

716
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,280
 This one, I think it's because it was a Franken show, right?

717
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,280
 It wasn't deliberate.

718
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,280
 It wasn't deliberate.

719
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,800
 It wasn't deliberate, right?

720
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,800
 Ah.

721
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,800
 Hard to say.

722
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:02,800
 So, yeah.

723
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,800
 It's a good point.

724
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:07,320
 Like, we made a few shows and then in the edit, we edited again.

725
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,320
 It was a pilot.

726
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,440
 Like, that episode was never meant to go out, but I'll happily take one of James's facts.

727
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,440
 All right.

728
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,440
 So what is it?

729
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,440
 It's that.

730
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,000
 In 2013, six people in the USA named their child Mushroom.

731
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 Very nice.

732
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 Good fact.

733
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,160
 I wouldn't want to be associated with that fact anymore, actually.

734
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,160
 Exactly.

735
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,160
 Yeah.

736
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,440
 Did you hate mushrooms as much then as you did, as you do now?

737
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,800
 It's been a whole life thing, though.

738
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,800
 Right.

739
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,800
 Yeah.

740
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,800
 For as young as I remember being, I did not like mushrooms.

741
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,840
 Maybe if you'd been named mushroom, you wouldn't now have that phobia.

742
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,840
 I probably would hate it more, because I can imagine the bullying I would have had a number

743
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,840
 of people saying you're a fun guy, which you are.

744
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:44,840
 Yeah, but I feel like I would have become less and less fun over the years as people

745
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,160
 made that joke to me.

746
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,160
 That's true.

747
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,160
 Yeah.

748
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,160
 That's understandable.

749
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,160
 Yeah.

750
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,160
 Okay.

751
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,120
 Well, those six people in the USA who were named Mushroom will now be 12.

752
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,120
 Oh, yeah.

753
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,120
 Yes.

754
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,120
 Years old.

755
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,120
 I mean, there would have doubled in size.

756
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,120
 Oh, no.

757
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:01,400
 They may reproduce with spools.

758
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,400
 We don't know.

759
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:07,960
 That's actually the age that a lot of people who come to our shows who are like kids, that's

760
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:10,440
 when they start listening, usually around 12, isn't it?

761
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,440
 Yeah.

762
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:16,640
 Well, if you're in the USA and you are named Mushroom and you were born in 2013, do write

763
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,640
 in to podcast@goi.com.

764
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:23,600
 I wonder if it's gone up over the years, whether or not it'll be a popular name, but now you

765
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,600
 think so.

766
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,600
 Yeah.

767
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,600
 It's a nice popular name in the States.

768
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,600
 Yeah.

769
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,600
 Okay.

770
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,600
 Well, they go Andy.

771
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,600
 Thank you very much.

772
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,600
 You're official custodian.

773
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,600
 I love it.

774
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,600
 Of the mushroom fact.

775
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,600
 Probably in a few years there will be lots of people named Mushroom after the cloud.

776
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,600
 Go, go.

777
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,600
 All right.

778
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,160
 Shall we assign mine?

779
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:46,520
 So my fact, this was the fourth fact of the very first episode is that Philippa

780
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:52,880
 Langley, who found Richard III's bones with an amateur, but nonetheless saw him at a car

781
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:56,920
 park beneath a huge R, and the bones were beneath there.

782
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,880
 Could have done with an edit.

783
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,880
 Yeah.

784
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:04,000
 Apologies for anyone who is custodian of dance facts because we won't be able to fit them

785
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,080
 on the certificate.

786
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:12,280
 I think at the time when I was typing up these episodes, I hadn't yet found my scrupulous

787
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:15,600
 methodology of writing the headline facts up in a really concise way.

788
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,240
 I don't think I would have said it like that.

789
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:20,040
 I think you might have said it like that.

790
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:25,080
 Well, okay, well, that's how it goes.

791
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,560
 We're going to be doing this every week.

792
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,720
 So join Friend of the Podcast.

793
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,880
 You will become the official custodian of one of our facts.

794
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:35,400
 And as of next week, we'll be going from episode two onwards.

795
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,400
 Yes.

796
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:43,240
 So if you want to find out how to do that and how to claim your fact, then just go to patreon.com/nosuchthingsaffish.

797
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:46,320
 And even if you don't join at the Friend of the Podcast, there are two other tiers available.

798
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:51,600

799
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:55,080
 every fortnight or little videos of us doing very, very stupid stuff.

800
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,680
 It's all so much fun and we're very excited to be making it.

 so much for listening podcast@ky.com.

804
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,600
 Andy goes through all the emails.

805
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,200
 He's going to be cherry picking the best of them and we're going to bring more of them

806
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,200
 next Monday.

807
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,000
 Until then, goodbye.

808
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 [Music]

809
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
