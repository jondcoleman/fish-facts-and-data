00:00:10,00:00:25,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast."
00:00:25,00:00:28,This week coming to you live from Oslo!
00:00:28,00:00:34,[APPLAUSE]
00:00:34,00:00:36,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:36,00:00:40,"I am sitting here with Anna Chazinski, Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin."
00:00:40,00:00:45,And once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.
00:00:45,00:00:48,"And in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:48,00:00:50,"Starting with you, Andy."
00:00:50,00:00:57,My fact is that there was once an Olympic sport where you had to dive into a pool and then glide along for a minute.
00:00:57,00:01:02,It was scrapped because the main factor was how heavy you were.
00:01:02,00:01:05,[LAUGHTER]
00:01:05,00:01:12,"Don't you think though, like, the main factor in the running race is how fast you are, so why is it not fair to have a how heavy you are?"
00:01:12,00:01:14,Completely. It's completely fair.
00:01:14,00:01:18,You can train to be heavy in the same way you can train to run fast really.
00:01:18,00:01:22,"I guess so. You could see the winner coming along before the game even starts, right?"
00:01:22,00:01:29,"No, he's got guard. Well, this was a thing called the plunge for distance, was the official name of it."
00:01:29,00:01:34,"So basically, you dived in, you weren't allowed to move, you weren't allowed to swim at all."
00:01:34,00:01:36,You had to keep your head under the surface of the water.
00:01:36,00:01:42,"And then you were timed, and they saw how far you would get in either 60 seconds or until you put your head up above the water."
00:01:42,00:01:46,"Another thing is, it's not a great spectator spot, is it?"
00:01:46,00:01:51,It got called competitive floating.
00:01:51,00:01:53,[LAUGHTER]
00:01:53,00:01:57,It's the least spectatory sport imaginable.
00:01:57,00:02:01,It happened once in St. Louis in 1904.
00:02:01,00:02:04,There were lots of reviews at the time which were pretty negative.
00:02:04,00:02:11,People sent the competitors merely throw themselves heavily in the water and float along like icebergs in the shipping lanes.
00:02:11,00:02:16,And this was in St. Louis in 1904.
00:02:16,00:02:17,"Yeah, that's right."
00:02:17,00:02:21,"Yeah, okay. So there was lots of great things that happened in that Olympics."
00:02:21,00:02:26,"In the water polo, the Americans said that instead of having a fully inflated bowl,"
00:02:26,00:02:31,"you could have it slightly unflated, if that's a word."
00:02:31,00:02:37,"But actually, to score a goal, you had to hold the bowl underwater in the net rather than throwing it."
00:02:37,00:02:43,And the Germans thought that this was complete nonsense. They called it soft water polo and refused to compete.
00:02:43,00:02:48,Two of the winning American water polo team were dead six months later.
00:02:48,00:02:57,And they think it might have been because the matches took place in the lagoon that was used as a sump for the animal and vegetable waste from all the other exhibits.
00:02:57,00:02:58,[LAUGHTER]
00:02:58,00:03:00,"Oh, God."
00:03:00,00:03:02,[LAUGHTER]
00:03:02,00:03:09,"And the Germans, they brought their own diving board for the diving competition that was made out of a special coconut matting."
00:03:09,00:03:16,"And they insisted that all the scoring be on the acrobatics you did in the air, and it didn't matter how you entered the water."
00:03:16,00:03:17,[LAUGHTER]
00:03:17,00:03:20,"Yeah, there was a massive controversy, wasn't it, in the diving."
00:03:20,00:03:25,"And this was what was called the fancy diving, which is what used to be the name for the high dive, basically."
00:03:25,00:03:33,"And yeah, I think the person who won was an American, and the guy who had made the trophy to present to the winner was German."
00:03:33,00:03:36,And he refused to hand over the trophy because he was so outraged.
00:03:36,00:03:37,[LAUGHTER]
00:03:37,00:03:41,Because this is bullshit. He just landed well. The stuff in the air was useless.
00:03:41,00:03:47,It was a very interesting Olympics. It was only 12 countries competed in the 1904 Olympics.
00:03:47,00:03:51,And it largely was because no one wanted to go to St. Louis.
00:03:51,00:03:57,"They just saw it. It's too far away. It's inaccessible. But the Americans said, ""Okay, we'll just put more people in."""
00:03:57,00:04:02,So 81% of the people who competed in the 1904 Olympics were Americans.
00:04:02,00:04:03,[LAUGHTER]
00:04:03,00:04:08,So there were 630 athletes in total. 523 were Americans.
00:04:08,00:04:12,They won 239 medals.
00:04:12,00:04:17,Still a record to this day of most medals won by a single nation in the Olympics.
00:04:17,00:04:21,"I think the runner-up was Germany who got 13, right?"
00:04:21,00:04:29,"But this is a thing. This is a controversy. In fact, even in Norway, so the USA..."
00:04:29,00:04:33,"That's where we are, if the listeners haven't realised."
00:04:33,00:04:42,So the USA fielded athletes who were immigrants from Europe who hadn't actually become US citizens yet.
00:04:42,00:04:45,So they really weren't. They shouldn't have been competing for the USA.
00:04:45,00:04:49,And the Norwegians were still annoyed about this in 2012.
00:04:49,00:04:50,[LAUGHTER]
00:04:50,00:04:54,There was still officially requesting that the results were changed.
00:04:54,00:04:55,[LAUGHTER]
00:04:55,00:05:00,108 years after these Olympics.
00:05:00,00:05:04,We've got a right historical wrongs where we can.
00:05:04,00:05:07,[APPLAUSE]
00:05:07,00:05:11,You know James U is saying that I think you said the Germans brought their own dive boards.
00:05:11,00:05:16,"Well, actually, generally people did bring their own dive boards to diving competitions."
00:05:16,00:05:20,"So this was until the 1960s, basically."
00:05:20,00:05:23,"So the diving board that we know today, which is the really springy one,"
00:05:23,00:05:26,and you know when you see them dive and I always think it's going to snap because it bends so much.
00:05:26,00:05:29,And that was invented by a guy called Raymond Rude.
00:05:29,00:05:32,And he sort of tried it out. I know it's a good name.
00:05:32,00:05:36,He tried it out in a neighbor's garden for a few years and it worked.
00:05:36,00:05:39,And so he brought it to the Olympics in 1960.
00:05:39,00:05:41,"Before that, divers were just bringing their own boards."
00:05:41,00:05:45,And then they'd get there and they'd sometimes do some swaps and they'd try out each other's boards to see which ones they liked.
00:05:45,00:05:52,And there was only when he brought his and everyone requested his to the extent that he had to like telegram back or whatever to send some more over.
00:05:52,00:05:55,"Because it was so in demand that people were like, should we just use this one?"
00:05:55,00:05:57,Did they bring the ladders as well?
00:05:57,00:05:58,Or was it just the...
00:05:58,00:06:01,I don't think you need a special ladder so much.
00:06:01,00:06:02,"Well, I think..."
00:06:02,00:06:03,To get up.
00:06:03,00:06:05,"You know, I agree you need a ladder."
00:06:05,00:06:07,Yeah.
00:06:07,00:06:12,And then you're also very good at the high jump.
00:06:12,00:06:14,"Well, that might be."
00:06:14,00:06:19,What an event that would be where you do the pole vault onto it and then dive off it.
00:06:19,00:06:23,Do you know how they make those... those aluminium boards?
00:06:23,00:06:28,"It's very cool. So they're made of aircraft grade aluminium, which I didn't know."
00:06:28,00:06:33,And they take a massive cylinder of aluminium and they heat it to a very high temperature.
00:06:33,00:06:37,And then they squeeze it through a massive press with thousands of tons of pressure on it.
00:06:37,00:06:40,"So it's like pushing it through a toothpaste tube, basically."
00:06:40,00:06:41,"Oh, cool."
00:06:41,00:06:44,Just sort of very hot aluminium toothpaste.
00:06:44,00:06:47,"Well, the first one was made of a plane wing."
00:06:47,00:06:48,In fact...
00:06:48,00:06:49,Sorry?
00:06:49,00:06:51,The first one was made of an aeroplane wing.
00:06:51,00:06:52,I heard penguin.
00:06:52,00:06:54,I heard penguin as well.
00:06:54,00:06:56,Yeah.
00:06:56,00:06:59,"I mean, their wings are kind of flat, aren't they?"
00:06:59,00:07:02,They're almost like diving pods.
00:07:02,00:07:05,"Quite bouncy, blubbery quality if you get them in their own season."
00:07:05,00:07:08,And here are the Antarctica team.
00:07:08,00:07:12,"Sorry, an aeroplane wing."
00:07:12,00:07:13,Wow.
00:07:13,00:07:14,An aeroplane wing.
00:07:14,00:07:15,"Yeah, yeah."
00:07:15,00:07:16,That's cool.
00:07:16,00:07:18,Somehow less funny than a penguin.
00:07:18,00:07:20,I know.
00:07:20,00:07:22,"That's a long diving board, though."
00:07:22,00:07:24,I think you sort of cut it up.
00:07:24,00:07:25,Okay.
00:07:25,00:07:30,You don't want to be tired by the time you've got to the end of the diving board.
00:07:30,00:07:34,"Ideally, you want somewhere between a penguin wing and an aeroplane wing, don't you?"
00:07:34,00:07:37,That's the official measurement.
00:07:37,00:07:39,There was just another Olympic thing.
00:07:39,00:07:43,"So in 1896, in the first Olympics, there was the herdling."
00:07:43,00:07:48,And there was a massive difference between the American team who could run and then jump over the hurdles.
00:07:48,00:07:54,"And the Greek team who would run up to the hurdles stop, jump over and then start running again."
00:07:54,00:07:56,Who won?
00:07:56,00:08:00,So many things.
00:08:00,00:08:02,Was that part of their rules?
00:08:02,00:08:04,Because they can't have thought that was the best way to do it.
00:08:04,00:08:06,"Well, no one would ever really done it before."
00:08:06,00:08:10,It was a first Olympics.
00:08:10,00:08:11,Wow.
00:08:11,00:08:14,No wonder the Greek Empire fell in the end.
00:08:14,00:08:17,Wouldn't be your instinct.
00:08:17,00:08:19,Just on diving.
00:08:19,00:08:24,"So in Norway, the Norwegians like to dive, and specifically one particular kind of diving,"
00:08:24,00:08:26,called I think it's a dead thing.
00:08:26,00:08:27,Is this a thing?
00:08:27,00:08:28,Yeah.
00:08:28,00:08:29,It's insane.
00:08:29,00:08:34,"So this is, I think the translation is death diving, or death thing, basically."
00:08:34,00:08:36,And it's an annual thing.
00:08:36,00:08:40,"And essentially, it's a belly flop from 10 meters high."
00:08:40,00:08:42,And so you get on this diving boat.
00:08:42,00:08:44,Has anyone ever been to one of the competitions?
00:08:44,00:08:45,Yeah.
00:08:45,00:08:46,Quite a few people.
00:08:46,00:08:49,"Well, it sounds insane."
00:08:49,00:08:53,"So I was watching a lot of videos of this today, but basically these Norwegian people go up 10 meters high,"
00:08:53,00:08:55,and then you have to three yourself off.
00:08:55,00:08:58,And you basically do as many impressive things in the air as you can.
00:08:58,00:09:02,"And then you're judged largely on how quickly you scrunch up at the end,"
00:09:02,00:09:06,and kind of avoid literally splitting your body open.
00:09:06,00:09:10,"But it's really funny to watch, because the commentary is just these two guys."
00:09:10,00:09:17,"They were just constantly going, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, god."
00:09:17,00:09:19,It's insane.
00:09:19,00:09:23,So there is a dive which is theoretically possible.
00:09:23,00:09:26,There's a pair of mathematicians in the University of Australia.
00:09:26,00:09:31,"They've come up with a dive, because you know, you have all these different twists and solace holes in terms of all this stuff."
00:09:31,00:09:36,"So they've calculated a dive that they insist must be possible,"
00:09:36,00:09:41,which is you have to do one and a half summer solace and five twists.
00:09:41,00:09:46,And that's in 1.5 seconds between time and fall and thing.
00:09:46,00:09:49,"And so they say they've simulated it, and they say it's possible."
00:09:49,00:09:54,"And any diver that has been asked has said, no, we can't do that."
00:09:54,00:09:57,And it is done by mathematicians rather.
00:09:57,00:09:59,By a mechanical scientist.
00:09:59,00:10:02,It feels like they've just found the perfect sphere.
00:10:02,00:10:06,"They've no air resistance and just, I don't know."
00:10:06,00:10:16,But I so desperately want to see a queue of scrawny pasty mathematicians being forced onto a diving board to prove they're working.
00:10:16,00:10:19,And we're going to have to move on in a second to our next fact.
00:10:19,00:10:21,"Oh, just a couple more Olympic things maybe."
00:10:21,00:10:22,Yeah.
00:10:22,00:10:30,"So at the first ever Winter Olympics in 1924, seven people who won medals were dead."
00:10:30,00:10:36,Is that what the event where you had to go under the snow for as long as possible?
00:10:36,00:10:40,"No, the medals went to people who had achieved great things in mountaineering."
00:10:40,00:10:45,"And so the British expedition to Everest in 1921, despite the fact that a lot of people had died."
00:10:45,00:10:49,Just one will mad Olympic sport that doesn't exist anymore.
00:10:49,00:10:52,"In 1908 in the Olympics, this was in London."
00:10:52,00:10:56,"In fact, dueling was a demonstration sport there."
00:10:56,00:11:01,"And it was really great. So it used a real gun, but it was wax pellets."
00:11:01,00:11:04,"So theoretically, they weren't supposed to kill you."
00:11:04,00:11:07,They did travel at 87 meters a second.
00:11:07,00:11:09,So they're going quite fast.
00:11:09,00:11:13,"And then they splat you, expand with a splat like an incredibly dangerous paintball."
00:11:13,00:11:15,"And yet, they wore some protection."
00:11:15,00:11:18,So they protected their extremities and they wore big head protection.
00:11:18,00:11:20,"Otherwise, it would kill them."
00:11:20,00:11:22,And the winner.
00:11:22,00:11:25,So they also wore this big black cloak all over themselves.
00:11:25,00:11:29,"And on the cloak, in chalk, they had drawn out where all the vital organs are."
00:11:29,00:11:31,And then they did the duel.
00:11:31,00:11:35,"And the winner was the person who hit closest, because it made a mark."
00:11:35,00:11:37,Hit closest to the most important vital organ.
00:11:37,00:11:39,That's amazing.
00:11:39,00:11:40,So good.
00:11:40,00:11:42,And I was reading an old newspaper report of it.
00:11:42,00:11:46,"And there was one pistolman who I'm going to assume was a Brit who said,"
00:11:46,00:11:50,"apparently he announced his intention to forego the head protection,"
00:11:50,00:11:56,preferring to rely on the gentlemanly oner code that it was bad form to aim for the head.
00:11:56,00:12:02,"Just on a similar thing, in 1924, in the fencing competition,"
00:12:02,00:12:08,the French judge and the Hungarian judge really fell out and decided to have their own duel.
00:12:08,00:12:14,"That November, after the games, they met on the Yugoslav Italian border"
00:12:14,00:12:18,and jouled for over an hour until both men were seriously injured
00:12:18,00:12:21,and the abay people had to stop the contest.
00:12:21,00:12:22,Wow.
00:12:22,00:12:24,"OK, it is time for fact number two."
00:12:24,00:12:26,And that is Chazinski.
00:12:26,00:12:29,"My fact this week is that at Polapark in Norway,"
00:12:29,00:12:35,you're told not to wear wool clothes in case the wolves confuse you with a sheep.
00:12:35,00:12:41,"So this is something that's a danger, apparently."
00:12:41,00:12:44,"This is Polapark, which has anyone been?"
00:12:44,00:12:46,It sounds amazing.
00:12:46,00:12:50,"OK, so for those of you who haven't, it's this 300-acre wildlife park."
00:12:50,00:12:54,And one of their main attractions is this wolf population that they've got there
00:12:54,00:12:58,and I was reading an article by someone who'd been and visited.
00:12:58,00:13:01,"And she said, she did meet the wolves, so you get to meet them there,"
00:13:01,00:13:03,"sort of tame and friendly, you're told."
00:13:03,00:13:07,"But at the same time, the main wildlife keeper says,"
00:13:07,00:13:08,you've got to be quite careful.
00:13:08,00:13:13,"So for instance, they showed lots of interest in anyone who was sick, limping or weak."
00:13:13,00:13:16,[LAUGHTER]
00:13:16,00:13:19,"You're told when you meet them to kneel down, not sit,"
00:13:19,00:13:21,so you can make a very quick escape.
00:13:21,00:13:24,If suddenly they turn on you and you're told to remove all your wool clothing.
00:13:24,00:13:27,"Otherwise, so I wrote to actually the main wildlife keeper,"
00:13:27,00:13:30,"who's a guy called Stig Slesen, to check up on this with him."
00:13:30,00:13:32,"And I said, is this true that you can't?"
00:13:32,00:13:34,"And he said, yes, people are told not to wear wool."
00:13:34,00:13:38,"Otherwise, you might have naked people running around after meeting the wolves."
00:13:38,00:13:39,[LAUGHTER]
00:13:39,00:13:42,Is that sheepy smell? They can't resist it.
00:13:42,00:13:45,There are a lot of things that they say you can't do if you're going there.
00:13:45,00:13:49,"So you can't wear fur, you can't wear gloves, hats, earrings."
00:13:49,00:13:52,You can't be pregnant. You can't be under 18.
00:13:52,00:13:54,"And if they knock you over, you just have to lay there."
00:13:54,00:13:56,You can't move.
00:13:56,00:13:58,Why? Because they might eat you.
00:13:58,00:13:59,[LAUGHTER]
00:13:59,00:14:00,But I assume. I assume.
00:14:00,00:14:03,"But if they've knocked you over, they've got you right where they want you."
00:14:03,00:14:05,Yeah. So you just have to--
00:14:05,00:14:08,A wolf is a kind of animal that chases after its prey.
00:14:08,00:14:10,"So if it knocks you over a new panic and you run away,"
00:14:10,00:14:12,then it might chase after you.
00:14:12,00:14:13,Yeah.
00:14:13,00:14:15,But how far into the process of it eating you?
00:14:15,00:14:17,If it does start to do that.
00:14:17,00:14:18,Yeah.
00:14:18,00:14:21,"Can you deploy plan B, whatever that is?"
00:14:21,00:14:22,[LAUGHTER]
00:14:22,00:14:26,"Well, sucks when plan B is trying to outrun a very fast animal."
00:14:26,00:14:28,With neither of your legs left.
00:14:28,00:14:31,[LAUGHTER]
00:14:31,00:14:35,There was just one more weird thing that the wildlife keeper said to me in his email.
00:14:35,00:14:39,"He said, another thing that we ask people not to do when they meet the wolves"
00:14:39,00:14:42,is related to the fact that wolves have very strong senses
00:14:42,00:14:44,and they have a very strong sense of smell.
00:14:44,00:14:48,So we don't encourage people to have sex before meeting our wolves.
00:14:48,00:14:52,"What? Wait. Do you mean, you don't mean ever, though?"
00:14:52,00:14:53,[LAUGHTER]
00:14:53,00:14:56,Bring another virgin for the wolves.
00:14:56,00:14:59,[LAUGHTER]
00:14:59,00:15:01,He didn't specify.
00:15:01,00:15:04,Okay. So obviously wolves are a little controversial here
00:15:04,00:15:06,"because some parts of Norway have a wolf taxi,"
00:15:06,00:15:10,which is for children going to school in areas where there are wolves.
00:15:10,00:15:11,Right. Okay.
00:15:11,00:15:15,But the rewilding is a big thing.
00:15:15,00:15:18,And the way that you can rewild a wolf is really cool.
00:15:18,00:15:24,So step one is to watch the wolves in shifts to know when they're going to mate.
00:15:24,00:15:27,"This is your, well, you need to what, you need to have..."
00:15:27,00:15:30,"Where are they? Sorry, are they in a zoo or something when you watch them?"
00:15:30,00:15:32,You need zoo wolves to mate.
00:15:32,00:15:35,"So you then calculate, because I think they're pregnant for about 63 days."
00:15:35,00:15:38,There are thereabouts. Yeah.
00:15:38,00:15:39,[LAUGHTER]
00:15:39,00:15:43,"And then you search for a wild pack, which has recently had puppies."
00:15:43,00:15:45,And you track them down.
00:15:45,00:15:48,"Hopefully they've got collazons, so you know what they are."
00:15:48,00:15:54,"And then you need to carry the new puppies to the pack that you found in backpacks, adorable."
00:15:54,00:15:55,[LAUGHTER]
00:15:55,00:16:00,And you need to get to the wolf's den and you need to go in.
00:16:00,00:16:04,And then you need to take your new zoo puppies and roll them around
00:16:04,00:16:08,in the urine and the feces of the existing wild puppies.
00:16:08,00:16:09,Right.
00:16:09,00:16:12,"And you also, and you sort of mix them up so they smell completely alike."
00:16:12,00:16:14,And then you retreat.
00:16:14,00:16:15,"Wow, yeah."
00:16:15,00:16:18,And then you leave the puppies behind and then you hope that they blend in.
00:16:18,00:16:19,[LAUGHTER]
00:16:19,00:16:20,Yeah.
00:16:20,00:16:21,Isn't that weird?
00:16:21,00:16:24,"Imagine if you, though, were visiting the park and you quickly needed a piece."
00:16:24,00:16:28,"You went into a cave, had a quick was, and then they shoved their faces into that."
00:16:28,00:16:30,You're now mummy.
00:16:30,00:16:32,[LAUGHTER]
00:16:32,00:16:34,How it works?
00:16:34,00:16:36,"It doesn't work, that's it."
00:16:36,00:16:37,Hang on.
00:16:37,00:16:39,"I thought, was that what you were saying?"
00:16:39,00:16:42,"I don't think my urine helps anything, though."
00:16:42,00:16:43,[LAUGHTER]
00:16:43,00:16:45,OK.
00:16:45,00:16:50,So the rewilding of wolves and birds especially around Europe is quite big at the moment.
00:16:50,00:16:52,You have quite a lot in France.
00:16:52,00:16:56,You have quite a lot in Germany and Switzerland that weren't there even 20 years ago.
00:16:56,00:17:00,I was speaking to my friend from Latvia and I was asking him if they have them in Latvia.
00:17:00,00:17:02,"And I said, do you have any wolves there?"
00:17:02,00:17:04,"And he said, oh, yeah, we've got loads of wolves now."
00:17:04,00:17:05,"I said, do you have any bears?"
00:17:05,00:17:07,"And he said, we have one bear."
00:17:07,00:17:09,Although sometimes he goes over to Lithuania.
00:17:09,00:17:12,[LAUGHTER]
00:17:12,00:17:14,So they have 0.5 bears.
00:17:14,00:17:15,[LAUGHTER]
00:17:15,00:17:17,Bears are now extinct in Latvia.
00:17:17,00:17:18,"Oh, no, sorry."
00:17:18,00:17:20,[LAUGHTER]
00:17:20,00:17:21,Great news.
00:17:21,00:17:23,So they're choosing to be controversial here.
00:17:23,00:17:27,"There's no way it's split, apparently."
00:17:27,00:17:31,We agreed on this over whether wolves are bad guys or good guys.
00:17:31,00:17:32,[LAUGHTER]
00:17:32,00:17:33,"Yeah, OK."
00:17:33,00:17:36,"So half of you are going to leave, after I've said this."
00:17:36,00:17:42,"But in 2009, one man personally offered a reward of 50,000 Norwegian Kroner"
00:17:42,00:17:45,for information leading to a person who'd illegally killed a wolf.
00:17:45,00:17:46,So someone's killed a wolf.
00:17:46,00:17:47,"He said, here's his reward."
00:17:47,00:17:50,"And in response to that, he was completely--"
00:17:50,00:17:51,so he was vandalized.
00:17:51,00:17:54,"There was rubbish stuffed in his driveway, like huge piles of garbage."
00:17:54,00:17:57,All of his outbuildings and his fences were vandalized.
00:17:57,00:17:59,"And one night, he was out of town."
00:17:59,00:18:02,And his wife woke up to a loud buzzing noise to find a group of people
00:18:02,00:18:05,encircling the house marching around at waving chainsaws.
00:18:05,00:18:07,[LAUGHTER]
00:18:07,00:18:11,"Well, that's because he didn't make his house out of straw rob twigs, right?"
00:18:11,00:18:14,[LAUGHTER]
00:18:14,00:18:19,There were licenses given out in Norway to shoot 16 wild wolves.
00:18:19,00:18:21,The government decided on a call.
00:18:21,00:18:25,"And more than 11,000 hunters applied for them."
00:18:25,00:18:26,[LAUGHTER]
00:18:26,00:18:28,"11,000."
00:18:28,00:18:31,"But we were very into shooting wolves for a long time, weren't we?"
00:18:31,00:18:32,Back when we had them.
00:18:32,00:18:33,Before we did the podcast.
00:18:33,00:18:36,[LAUGHTER]
00:18:36,00:18:38,"It was out on a shoot that we thought, you know,"
00:18:38,00:18:39,we should do a podcast.
00:18:39,00:18:41,[LAUGHTER]
00:18:41,00:18:43,Do you know I'm just speaking about it?
00:18:43,00:18:45,"Sorry, could you just-- what were you talking about there?"
00:18:45,00:18:48,"Yeah, so we were big into hunting wolves."
00:18:48,00:18:52,"So they are always the archetypal bad guy, the wolf rather than the bear,"
00:18:52,00:18:54,which is much more likely to kill you.
00:18:54,00:18:56,And England had a serious wolf problem.
00:18:56,00:18:57,It would kill lots of people sheep.
00:18:57,00:19:00,"And eventually, everyone got so pissed off about it that in the 13th century,"
00:19:00,00:19:06,"in 1281, King Edward I commissioned a guy called Peter the mighty hunter Corbit."
00:19:06,00:19:08,[LAUGHTER]
00:19:08,00:19:11,Andrew Hunter Murray would be so much better if you had the mighty as well.
00:19:11,00:19:12,[LAUGHTER]
00:19:12,00:19:14,That's a good point.
00:19:14,00:19:16,I will consider it.
00:19:16,00:19:19,"You've got to earn a middle name like that, I think."
00:19:19,00:19:20,And he definitely did.
00:19:20,00:19:23,So he was told to exterminate all the wolves in England.
00:19:23,00:19:24,And he did it.
00:19:24,00:19:27,"So apparently, by 1290, all the wolves were exterminated."
00:19:27,00:19:29,He'd earned his nickname.
00:19:29,00:19:31,England was rid of all the wolves.
00:19:31,00:19:32,That was what was reported.
00:19:32,00:19:36,There were no more deaths of livestock by wolves anymore.
00:19:36,00:19:39,And he was known from then on as the unimplied.
00:19:39,00:19:41,[LAUGHTER]
00:19:44,00:19:49,There are some monkeys which have started domesticating wolves we think.
00:19:49,00:19:50,[LAUGHTER]
00:19:50,00:19:53,So this is really exciting.
00:19:53,00:19:56,"This is like dogs 2.0, basically."
00:19:56,00:20:00,"There are bits of Ethiopia, where there are Ethiopian wolves,"
00:20:00,00:20:03,"which are particular species, and Galada monkeys."
00:20:03,00:20:05,And they're getting on really well.
00:20:05,00:20:10,And the wolves don't eat the baby monkeys when they're hanging around together.
00:20:10,00:20:12,And the Galadas don't object to the wolves.
00:20:12,00:20:15,So this is very similar to the way that humans domesticated wolves
00:20:15,00:20:16,in the first place.
00:20:16,00:20:19,"And they will just sit next to each other for a couple of hours at a time,"
00:20:19,00:20:20,just ignoring each other.
00:20:20,00:20:23,So they seem to be deliberately hanging out together.
00:20:23,00:20:24,OK.
00:20:24,00:20:25,But hey.
00:20:25,00:20:28,"So when we're traveling from one city to another,"
00:20:28,00:20:30,and you're just sat there ignoring me?
00:20:30,00:20:32,"I'm, I'm domesticating you."
00:20:32,00:20:35,[LAUGHTER]
00:20:35,00:20:39,[APPLAUSE]
00:20:39,00:20:44,"No, but anyway, the wolves seem to find it easier to catch rodents"
00:20:44,00:20:46,when they're hanging around with the monkeys.
00:20:46,00:20:47,And we don't know why.
00:20:47,00:20:48,OK.
00:20:48,00:20:50,So it might be there's a food reward in it for them.
00:20:50,00:20:52,And so that will be the next big thing.
00:20:52,00:20:54,[LAUGHTER]
00:20:54,00:20:57,Big thing in what?
00:20:57,00:21:00,"In evolution, they're going to be the new humans and dogs."
00:21:00,00:21:01,Is what you're saying?
00:21:01,00:21:04,I'm trying to pitch it as the new humans and dogs.
00:21:04,00:21:05,Yeah.
00:21:05,00:21:06,It works.
00:21:06,00:21:08,Wolves do team up with other creatures for hunting.
00:21:08,00:21:11,"So there was a great headline in the Washington Post,"
00:21:11,00:21:14,which was wolves and hyenas hunt together.
00:21:14,00:21:17,Prove Middle East peace process is possible.
00:21:17,00:21:22,[LAUGHTER]
00:21:22,00:21:23,OK.
00:21:23,00:21:25,It is time for fact number three.
00:21:25,00:21:26,And that is my fact.
00:21:26,00:21:28,"My fact this week is that this year,"
00:21:28,00:21:31,Doctors in Vietnam saved the man's life
00:21:31,00:21:35,by pumping 15 cans of beer into his body.
00:21:35,00:21:39,[APPLAUSE]
00:21:39,00:21:41,"If I didn't have to do that in no way,"
00:21:41,00:21:43,you'd have to mortgage your house.
00:21:43,00:21:46,[LAUGHTER]
00:21:46,00:21:49,So this was a guy who very sadly was dying
00:21:49,00:21:50,from alcohol poisoning.
00:21:50,00:21:53,"He was, yeah, so not so funny now, is it?"
00:21:53,00:21:55,[LAUGHTER]
00:21:55,00:21:57,48 years old and he fell unconscious.
00:21:57,00:22:00,They took him to the hospital and he had huge levels
00:22:00,00:22:01,of methanol in him.
00:22:01,00:22:04,He had more than a thousand times what would be
00:22:04,00:22:05,the recommended limit.
00:22:05,00:22:06,[LAUGHTER]
00:22:06,00:22:09,"And so, yeah, so basically what they had to do is"
00:22:09,00:22:12,they had to administer more cans of beer into him
00:22:12,00:22:14,because the idea was that they needed to slow down
00:22:14,00:22:17,the metabolizing process that his liver was doing.
00:22:17,00:22:18,Yeah.
00:22:18,00:22:20,And by slowing it down and by putting in total
00:22:20,00:22:22,"these 15 cans of one an hour,"
00:22:22,00:22:24,they managed to slow it enough that they could fix him.
00:22:24,00:22:25,Yeah.
00:22:25,00:22:27,So what it is is that the beer contains ethanol.
00:22:27,00:22:29,And your body always does the ethanol
00:22:29,00:22:31,before it does the methanol.
00:22:31,00:22:33,"So you put all this beer in, it's dealing with the ethanol"
00:22:33,00:22:35,and it gives you a bit of time to get the methanol out.
00:22:35,00:22:38,"But they do still need to suck the methanol out, didn't they?"
00:22:38,00:22:41,"Otherwise, you just got rid of all the ethanol you've pumped in"
00:22:41,00:22:43,and then the methanol comes back.
00:22:43,00:22:46,How do you suck methanol out of someone?
00:22:46,00:22:48,Does it gather somewhere in your body?
00:22:48,00:22:50,"Yeah, it's through dialysis."
00:22:50,00:22:51,Okay.
00:22:51,00:22:52,Yeah.
00:22:52,00:22:54,[LAUGHTER]
00:22:54,00:22:55,So the kidney?
00:22:55,00:22:56,Yes.
00:22:56,00:22:57,"Yeah, cool."
00:22:57,00:23:00,Sometimes it's just questions and answers.
00:23:00,00:23:02,[LAUGHTER]
00:23:02,00:23:04,"But he survived, so it's a good ending to that."
00:23:04,00:23:05,That's a good story.
00:23:05,00:23:06,It's great.
00:23:06,00:23:08,But don't try it on any old illness.
00:23:08,00:23:10,"I'm not sure we're recommending it, are we?"
00:23:10,00:23:11,No.
00:23:11,00:23:13,"Oh, well, some people recommended it."
00:23:13,00:23:14,"Oh, okay, yes we are."
00:23:14,00:23:15,[LAUGHTER]
00:23:15,00:23:17,But there are lots of medicines
00:23:17,00:23:19,"which used to be just pure alcohol, basically."
00:23:19,00:23:21,"So in the 19th century,"
00:23:21,00:23:25,Lydia E. Pinkham's vegetable compound for female complaints.
00:23:25,00:23:26,[LAUGHTER]
00:23:26,00:23:30,"It said it was herbal and it was entirely alcohol, basically."
00:23:30,00:23:32,And it was aimed at women.
00:23:32,00:23:34,"The slogan was, ""Only a woman can understand"
00:23:34,00:23:35,"another woman's ills."""
00:23:35,00:23:36,Right?
00:23:36,00:23:39,"And women were encouraged to write to Lydia Pinkham,"
00:23:39,00:23:42,"who was the woman on the bottle, you know, for personal advice."
00:23:42,00:23:46,"And Lydia Pinkham had a very large number of typists who just replied for her,"
00:23:46,00:23:50,recommending that these women take higher doses of Mrs. Pinkham's
00:23:50,00:23:51,vegetable compound.
00:23:51,00:23:55,They kept this going for 20 years after Lydia Pinkham died.
00:23:55,00:23:56,Wow.
00:23:56,00:23:57,Really?
00:23:57,00:24:00,"Yeah, eventually I thought she's been replied to these letters for a very long time."
00:24:00,00:24:01,[LAUGHTER]
00:24:01,00:24:02,Yeah.
00:24:02,00:24:05,"It is effective, though, alcohol, in a lot of ways."
00:24:05,00:24:06,It's probably the most--
00:24:06,00:24:07,[LAUGHTER]
00:24:07,00:24:08,Medicinally.
00:24:08,00:24:10,[APPLAUSE]
00:24:10,00:24:13,"And not for easing social situations, just in medicine."
00:24:13,00:24:17,But I think it's probably the most effective medicine that existed in humanity
00:24:17,00:24:21,for many thousand years in terms of its sterilizing qualities.
00:24:21,00:24:22,Right?
00:24:22,00:24:24,"So amazing sterilizing, if you've got a wound, purifying water."
00:24:24,00:24:29,"So the death rates in the 19th century, if people hadn't been able to drink beer instead of"
00:24:29,00:24:32,"water, tap water in most places would have been much higher."
00:24:32,00:24:33,It's a relaxant.
00:24:33,00:24:36,And so there have been all these studies as well.
00:24:36,00:24:39,"And I might get in trouble for saying this, but it's genuinely,"
00:24:39,00:24:41,if you look rigorously at the research.
00:24:41,00:24:46,So there's a guy who looked at hundreds of studies into the effects of moderate drinking.
00:24:46,00:24:50,"And once you've controlled for all factors, so once you've controlled for, like,"
00:24:50,00:24:56,"social factors, economic factors, age, weight, stuff like that, even once you've eradicated"
00:24:56,00:25:03,"those, you'll increase mortality if you are a heavy drinker or an abstainer is higher"
00:25:03,00:25:04,than if you're a moderate drinker.
00:25:04,00:25:11,"So if you're an abstainer, you have 51% higher mortality rate or risk than if you're a moderate drinker."
00:25:11,00:25:14,And moderate is two glasses of wine a day.
00:25:14,00:25:16,[APPLAUSE]
00:25:16,00:25:20,"So, and how many of you had so far tonight, Ella?"
00:25:20,00:25:21,Right.
00:25:21,00:25:23,I got very big glasses.
00:25:23,00:25:26,I think it's weird to recommend to daily allowance.
00:25:26,00:25:27,It's half of that.
00:25:27,00:25:28,And yes.
00:25:28,00:25:31,"Just on the medical thing about how it was really important over history,"
00:25:31,00:25:36,one really weird thing is that the ancient Nubians used to make beer.
00:25:36,00:25:39,"And as part of their beer, they made this thing called tetracycline."
00:25:39,00:25:41,It was just kind of an off-product of it.
00:25:41,00:25:44,And this actually is one of our greatest antibiotics.
00:25:44,00:25:47,Which was only invented in the modern day in the 1940s.
00:25:47,00:25:51,And so what loads of archaeologists have found is these bodies
00:25:51,00:25:54,with this amazing modern antibiotic in it.
00:25:54,00:25:56,"And they're like, where the hell has this come from?"
00:25:56,00:26:00,They said it was the equivalent of seeing an Egyptian mummy wearing Rayban sunglasses.
00:26:00,00:26:01,[LAUGHTER]
00:26:01,00:26:04,But it came from their beer.
00:26:04,00:26:05,Yeah.
00:26:05,00:26:06,That's very cool.
00:26:06,00:26:07,"Yeah, incredible."
00:26:07,00:26:08,See?
00:26:08,00:26:09,That's very cool.
00:26:09,00:26:13,And used to get prescriptions for alcohol sometimes during the days of prohibition.
00:26:13,00:26:17,"So if you were willing to pay $6 for a prescription,"
00:26:17,00:26:20,you would get a pint of alcohol in America when it was banned.
00:26:20,00:26:23,And one of the people who did this was Winston Churchill.
00:26:23,00:26:24,Right.
00:26:24,00:26:26,So he was in America in 1931.
00:26:26,00:26:28,He looked the wrong way when he was crossing the road.
00:26:28,00:26:30,And he was hit by a car.
00:26:30,00:26:32,And he had some complications.
00:26:32,00:26:34,"And he had months of medical problems, he was really in pain."
00:26:34,00:26:36,And so he got a doctor to write him a prescription.
00:26:36,00:26:40,"And the doctor wrote, ""The post-accident convalescence of Winston Churchill"
00:26:40,00:26:44,"necessitates the use of alcoholic spirits, especially at meal times."""
00:26:44,00:26:46,[LAUGHTER]
00:26:46,00:26:47,Good.
00:26:47,00:26:49,But not beer.
00:26:49,00:26:51,You couldn't risk my beer.
00:26:51,00:26:52,Right.
00:26:52,00:26:53,There was this bizarre controversy.
00:26:53,00:26:56,So people were really anti-beer from medicinal reasons.
00:26:56,00:27:00,"And there was a guy called, he was the attorney general in America called Mitchell Palmer."
00:27:00,00:27:03,And he was under a lot of pressure from Brewers.
00:27:03,00:27:06,"So he said, fine, give sick people beer if it helps them."
00:27:06,00:27:08,Which it often would to relax you.
00:27:08,00:27:11,"And he said, you could prescribe it at any time."
00:27:11,00:27:16,"And he said, commercial drug stores should be able to sell it from kind of soda fountains."
00:27:16,00:27:21,So there was almost a time where pharmacies across America had a beer fountain during prohibition.
00:27:21,00:27:23,[LAUGHTER]
00:27:23,00:27:27,And then all those bloody abolitionists got involved and said that he couldn't do it.
00:27:27,00:27:29,And he was kicked out.
00:27:29,00:27:31,And then prescribing beer at all was banned.
00:27:31,00:27:32,Wow.
00:27:32,00:27:34,But they do it today still in American hospitals.
00:27:34,00:27:39,"It's from an article that I read where someone was visiting a friend and the food came in,"
00:27:39,00:27:41,which was just the classic lunch they get.
00:27:41,00:27:43,But on the tray was a can of Budweiser.
00:27:43,00:27:47,"And it's because certain patients, if they're going, let's say through withdrawal,"
00:27:47,00:27:51,that's not helpful in their situation to be suddenly cut off from alcohol.
00:27:51,00:27:54,So this same patient was given it for breakfast as well.
00:27:54,00:27:57,"So it would be sort of, you know, eggs and Budweiser for breakfast."
00:27:57,00:27:58,[LAUGHTER]
00:27:58,00:27:59,And that goes on still.
00:27:59,00:28:01,It's not necessarily seen as a bad thing.
00:28:01,00:28:03,Mariah Carey had it.
00:28:03,00:28:06,Not a person who gets a lot of airtime in this podcast.
00:28:06,00:28:07,[LAUGHTER]
00:28:07,00:28:14,"She was actually investigated by the police, by the LA Department of Children and Family Services,"
00:28:14,00:28:19,because TMZ reported that she had been drinking beer while she was breastfeeding.
00:28:19,00:28:21,She had newborn twins.
00:28:21,00:28:22,And she said the nurse told me to do it.
00:28:22,00:28:26,And the nurse had told her that Guinness can help breastfeeders.
00:28:26,00:28:28,So it loosens up your milk and stuff.
00:28:28,00:28:30,"And actually, I was talking to our boss about this the other day."
00:28:30,00:28:31,She was always told that.
00:28:31,00:28:32,And she always did it.
00:28:32,00:28:36,"She used to be told, in the past, it was always said that you should drink Guinness, I think."
00:28:36,00:28:37,Yeah.
00:28:37,00:28:39,"Oh, breastfeeding or not breastfeeding, really?"
00:28:39,00:28:40,[LAUGHTER]
00:28:40,00:28:42,That might have been when we were in Ireland a few weeks ago.
00:28:42,00:28:43,"Yeah, I said that."
00:28:43,00:28:44,We're going to have to move on soon.
00:28:44,00:28:50,"Oh, one alcohol you might not want to drink when breastfeeding or otherwise is an Icelandic alcohol"
00:28:50,00:28:52,made from a whale's testicle.
00:28:52,00:28:54,[LAUGHTER]
00:28:54,00:28:59,"The guy who made it said, we smoke the testicle by the old Icelandic way with dried sheep shit."
00:28:59,00:29:02,[LAUGHTER]
00:29:02,00:29:07,And this method gives the beer a really unique smoke flavour.
00:29:07,00:29:09,[LAUGHTER]
00:29:09,00:29:10,Fancy some of that?
00:29:10,00:29:11,Unique.
00:29:11,00:29:12,[LAUGHTER]
00:29:12,00:29:13,"OK, what about this?"
00:29:13,00:29:15,There's a beer made from elephant dung.
00:29:15,00:29:20,And they use coffee beans that pass through an elephant's digestive system to make the beer.
00:29:20,00:29:24,"And instead of talking about an aftertaste, they talk about an afterglow."
00:29:24,00:29:26,[LAUGHTER]
00:29:26,00:29:31,And there is a new whiskey that has been made flavoured with the anal secretions of beavers.
00:29:31,00:29:32,[LAUGHTER]
00:29:32,00:29:38,"And on the website it says, the sack excretion exhibits bright and fruit qualities."
00:29:38,00:29:39,[LAUGHTER]
00:29:39,00:29:43,And rich leathery notes along with a creamy vanilla aroma.
00:29:43,00:29:45,[LAUGHTER]
00:29:45,00:29:46,Mmm.
00:29:46,00:29:52,"You don't want creamy, anyone, anal secretions, if you're having to consume them, I don't think."
00:29:52,00:29:54,[LAUGHTER]
00:29:54,00:29:59,"I've got one more prescription that was dished out just because this was about, you know, prescribing beer effectively."
00:29:59,00:30:05,Cambridge University have just published a load of their patient records from the 1590s to the 1630s.
00:30:05,00:30:08,"And it's got thousands and thousands, they've got 80,000 case notes."
00:30:08,00:30:13,"But they're incredibly hard to read because obviously the writing is extremely, you know,"
00:30:13,00:30:15,it's just very different to our writing today.
00:30:15,00:30:17,But they've finally put up a batch online.
00:30:17,00:30:26,And the prescriptions include things like the broth of the testicles of a bore pig beaten to a powder and quite a lot of pigeons.
00:30:26,00:30:31,So one thing that occurs frequently is pigeon slippers.
00:30:31,00:30:35,"A doxil will frequently prescribe, you put a pigeon on each foot."
00:30:35,00:30:36,[LAUGHTER]
00:30:36,00:30:38,"And you just, a dead pigeon."
00:30:38,00:30:39,"Oh, a dead pigeon."
00:30:39,00:30:42,"And you just cut it open, pop it on your feet, walk around."
00:30:42,00:30:43,[LAUGHTER]
00:30:43,00:30:45,And what is that supposed to help?
00:30:45,00:30:47,I can't remember what it was actually helping.
00:30:47,00:30:48,[LAUGHTER]
00:30:48,00:30:51,"I mean, oh, it doesn't help the pigeon very much."
00:30:51,00:30:54,"And some, some, like, they vary the prescription."
00:30:54,00:30:56,There's one prescription which says a pigeon on each foot.
00:30:56,00:30:59,One says a pigeon on the neck and to each foot.
00:30:59,00:31:02,And the other one just says half a pigeon to each foot.
00:31:02,00:31:03,[LAUGHTER]
00:31:03,00:31:05,It's not like when you split a paracetamol in half.
00:31:05,00:31:07,It's like the headaches not that bad.
00:31:07,00:31:09,I'll just do the half pigeon today.
00:31:09,00:31:10,Yeah.
00:31:10,00:31:11,[LAUGHTER]
00:31:11,00:31:15,They did use to-- I don't even know what I'm saying this-- but--
00:31:15,00:31:16,Let's say--
00:31:16,00:31:18,Because I think this is what it might be.
00:31:18,00:31:21,"They used to use, I think, the anus of a pigeon"
00:31:21,00:31:24,"to suck stuff out of bubos for the plague,"
00:31:24,00:31:26,because it has quite good suction.
00:31:26,00:31:27,[LAUGHTER]
00:31:27,00:31:28,Yes.
00:31:28,00:31:30,I thought it was snake bites as well.
00:31:30,00:31:31,It was.
00:31:31,00:31:32,"I think-- Oh, OK."
00:31:32,00:31:36,"Pliny recommended take a pigeon, shove its anus on your bite,"
00:31:36,00:31:37,and it will suck it out.
00:31:37,00:31:38,It turns out it doesn't.
00:31:38,00:31:40,And then you just die looking like an idiot
00:31:40,00:31:41,who would help a pigeon.
00:31:41,00:31:44,[LAUGHTER]
00:31:44,00:31:45,But it wasn't.
00:31:45,00:31:46,"It was for everything, the pigeon thing."
00:31:46,00:31:47,It wasn't just for plague.
00:31:47,00:31:48,It was everything.
00:31:48,00:31:49,Some of your peeps did it at one point.
00:31:49,00:31:50,"I was white, did I think?"
00:31:50,00:31:52,But what I know is it was a last result.
00:31:52,00:31:54,"So if someone brought in the pigeon,"
00:31:54,00:31:58,you knew that that you were on your way out.
00:31:58,00:31:59,I was reading a saw.
00:31:59,00:32:00,"So it was like, I'm dorked."
00:32:00,00:32:01,It was her father's bedside.
00:32:01,00:32:03,And he was really sick.
00:32:03,00:32:05,And he saw the nurse bring in the pigeon.
00:32:05,00:32:06,"And he went, ah, I see."
00:32:06,00:32:08,[LAUGHTER]
00:32:08,00:32:10,The thing that has never worked.
00:32:10,00:32:12,[LAUGHTER]
00:32:12,00:32:13,Thank you.
00:32:13,00:32:16,[LAUGHTER]
00:32:16,00:32:17,OK.
00:32:17,00:32:19,It is time for our final fact of the show.
00:32:19,00:32:21,And that is James.
00:32:21,00:32:22,OK.
00:32:22,00:32:25,My fact this week is that if you put a bunch of millipedes
00:32:25,00:32:29,"in a nightclub, all the genitals will glow in different colors."
00:32:29,00:32:36,[APPLAUSE]
00:32:36,00:32:39,"By the way, if you've not been to a nightclub with James,"
00:32:39,00:32:41,it is fucking awesome.
00:32:41,00:32:42,[LAUGHTER]
00:32:42,00:32:44,"If you go to a nightclub with a millipede,"
00:32:44,00:32:45,it's like put your left foot in.
00:32:45,00:32:46,And your left foot in.
00:32:46,00:32:47,And your left foot in.
00:32:47,00:32:48,And your left foot in.
00:32:48,00:32:50,[LAUGHTER]
00:32:50,00:32:52,What nightclub are you going to?
00:32:52,00:32:54,[LAUGHTER]
00:32:54,00:32:55,The under eight.
00:32:55,00:32:58,[LAUGHTER]
00:32:58,00:33:01,That was the last time I was in a nightclub.
00:33:01,00:33:04,What if you're happy if you know it or not?
00:33:04,00:33:07,"Let's get some row row your boat up there, DJ."
00:33:07,00:33:10,[LAUGHTER]
00:33:10,00:33:13,"Well, you give this fact some respect, please."
00:33:13,00:33:14,[LAUGHTER]
00:33:14,00:33:15,What's the-- why--
00:33:15,00:33:16,"Sorry, this was the--"
00:33:16,00:33:20,"OK, so these are flat-backed millipedes"
00:33:20,00:33:23,in the genus pseudo polydespus specifically.
00:33:23,00:33:27,"And they all look almost identical, regardless of their species,"
00:33:27,00:33:30,because they're just like two centimetre long little brown things.
00:33:30,00:33:38,But scientists have found out that if you shine ultraviolet light
00:33:38,00:33:41,"on their genitals, then it's like a disco."
00:33:41,00:33:42,[LAUGHTER]
00:33:42,00:33:43,Cool.
00:33:43,00:33:46,It's all these greens and blues and some of them
00:33:46,00:33:48,are shiny and others and stuff like that.
00:33:48,00:33:51,"And this is like a really good way of telling the different species,"
00:33:51,00:33:54,because before you would have to probably kill one and get the DNA
00:33:54,00:33:56,to see whether it was a different species.
00:33:56,00:33:57,Wow.
00:33:57,00:33:58,"So if you're having a nightclub and you think,"
00:33:58,00:34:01,what is that sort of middle-aged nerd in the corner doing
00:34:01,00:34:05,with what looks like a bag of insects?
00:34:05,00:34:07,"I'm going to stick with a mirror ball, I think,"
00:34:07,00:34:12,to decorate my desks rather than a rotating ceiling full of millipede dicks.
00:34:12,00:34:15,[LAUGHTER]
00:34:15,00:34:17,Do we know why this happens?
00:34:17,00:34:18,So you can tell species--
00:34:18,00:34:19,Is it so they can tell each other?
00:34:19,00:34:23,"Yeah, we actually don't know why, which is sad."
00:34:23,00:34:27,"Yeah, all we know is that it's still a mystery."
00:34:27,00:34:30,But millipedes are basically blind.
00:34:30,00:34:32,"Yeah, so they wouldn't be able to see--"
00:34:32,00:34:33,They wouldn't get to enjoy it.
00:34:33,00:34:36,"They wouldn't get to enjoy it, probably ever."
00:34:36,00:34:38,I don't know how great they look.
00:34:38,00:34:39,What is that?
00:34:39,00:34:40,"Yeah, very sad."
00:34:40,00:34:42,Is it males and females?
00:34:42,00:34:44,I think it is just males.
00:34:44,00:34:45,OK.
00:34:45,00:34:48,There has been this.
00:34:48,00:34:50,And now I think it's both.
00:34:50,00:34:53,And now I think it's just females.
00:34:53,00:34:56,That'll lead it so nicely.
00:34:56,00:34:59,There has been this incredible explosion over the last 20 years
00:34:59,00:35:03,of people discovering that basically all animals glow fluorescent.
00:35:03,00:35:04,Right?
00:35:04,00:35:05,It's so bizarre.
00:35:05,00:35:07,And it's weird that they never discovered it before.
00:35:07,00:35:10,"So for instance, just this year, or I think maybe last year,"
00:35:10,00:35:13,"a scientist accidentally discovered that flying squirrels,"
00:35:13,00:35:15,"you know, North American flying squirrels,"
00:35:15,00:35:17,glow pink under UV light.
00:35:17,00:35:19,And that was just-- he was out in the forest.
00:35:19,00:35:21,"It was a guy called John Martin, a forestry professor."
00:35:21,00:35:24,And he was shining a UV light up to look for light chin
00:35:24,00:35:28,and fungi and some frogs that glow under UV light.
00:35:28,00:35:30,And you notice that all the flying squirrels
00:35:30,00:35:32,were glowing pink.
00:35:32,00:35:34,"And again, we don't know why."
00:35:34,00:35:36,I think maybe it's to blend in with stuff like light chin
00:35:36,00:35:38,so that predators can't see them.
00:35:38,00:35:40,Maybe it shows you're healthy for a mate.
00:35:40,00:35:42,But how have we not shot UV lights?
00:35:42,00:35:45,"Well, the thing is humans, we can't see UV light."
00:35:45,00:35:48,So this has just been a complete mystery for us for so long.
00:35:48,00:35:50,There is a way to be able to see UV lights.
00:35:50,00:35:54,"If you have your cataracts removed, some people--"
00:35:54,00:35:56,"if you have cataracts surgery, some people"
00:35:56,00:35:57,can see ultraviolet light.
00:35:57,00:35:59,"And Monet had this, for instance."
00:35:59,00:36:00,Right.
00:36:00,00:36:02,So it is possible that Monet would have been able
00:36:02,00:36:04,to see these genitals of the millipedes.
00:36:04,00:36:06,[LAUGHTER]
00:36:06,00:36:09,"I should add, it is very fun to go to a nightclub with James."
00:36:09,00:36:12,But you do have to go and get your cataracts removed before you go.
00:36:12,00:36:14,It's a bit less fun that bit.
00:36:14,00:36:15,Yeah.
00:36:15,00:36:18,"So they think that after he had the lens out of his eye,"
00:36:18,00:36:20,he painted slightly different paintings.
00:36:20,00:36:23,"Yeah, his paintings were a little bit more towards the purple side"
00:36:23,00:36:24,of the spectrum.
00:36:24,00:36:25,For that reason.
00:36:25,00:36:26,Very cool.
00:36:26,00:36:29,"Some scientists have started making animals fluorescent as well,"
00:36:29,00:36:30,which is very exciting.
00:36:30,00:36:32,"So at Imperial College of London,"
00:36:32,00:36:36,they've started deliberately making mosquitoes with fluorescent testicles.
00:36:36,00:36:38,And it's just males again.
00:36:38,00:36:42,"And there's a really good reason for this, which is that."
00:36:42,00:36:44,So they were genetically modified.
00:36:44,00:36:47,So there's a glowing protein which only expresses itself in their testicles.
00:36:47,00:36:51,"And the reason this is useful is you can identify males and females very early,"
00:36:51,00:36:55,so you can release sterile males into the world at large
00:36:55,00:36:58,without accidentally releasing any female mosquitoes.
00:36:58,00:37:01,Because female mosquitoes are the ones who spread malaria.
00:37:01,00:37:03,That's why it's important.
00:37:03,00:37:05,"But when you said there's a really good reason for this,"
00:37:05,00:37:08,it did just sound like your professor had walked into the lab.
00:37:08,00:37:12,Then why the hell are those mosquitoes balls glowing?
00:37:12,00:37:15,There's a very good reason for this.
00:37:15,00:37:18,Just on things glowing.
00:37:18,00:37:21,There's a deep sea worm called Tomopterus.
00:37:21,00:37:23,"And it's transparent, which is very useful,"
00:37:23,00:37:26,because it means it's much harder to see it if you're a predator.
00:37:26,00:37:30,And it can also make a part of its body glow on command
00:37:30,00:37:33,and then release that part as a decoy.
00:37:33,00:37:35,"Oh, cool."
00:37:35,00:37:36,Cool.
00:37:36,00:37:37,Wow.
00:37:37,00:37:39,But then it's lost part of its body.
00:37:39,00:37:40,Yeah.
00:37:40,00:37:42,They can only do it so many times.
00:37:42,00:37:44,That's very true.
00:37:44,00:37:45,Yeah.
00:37:45,00:37:48,"Once you're getting down to making your head glow,"
00:37:48,00:37:50,"you're in real, real trouble."
00:37:50,00:37:52,"That is really cool, though."
00:37:52,00:37:56,"There's a chameleon at which, if you put it under UV lights,"
00:37:56,00:37:59,we'll glow in the dark and like a little blue glow.
00:37:59,00:38:02,And it's actually the bones that are glowing.
00:38:02,00:38:04,And you can see them under the skin.
00:38:04,00:38:05,Whoa.
00:38:05,00:38:06,This is amazing.
00:38:06,00:38:08,"And again, we don't know why it happens."
00:38:08,00:38:11,"But it's basically, you know, like if you go to a Halloween party"
00:38:11,00:38:15,"as a skeleton, and all you can see is the glowing bones."
00:38:15,00:38:16,Yeah.
00:38:16,00:38:17,These chameleons are like that.
00:38:17,00:38:19,"Or maybe, so maybe if a predator comes,"
00:38:19,00:38:21,"they go, oh, someone's already eaten that one."
00:38:21,00:38:23,[LAUGHTER]
00:38:23,00:38:27,[APPLAUSE]
00:38:27,00:38:29,We're going to have to wrap up very shortly.
00:38:29,00:38:34,Do you know how animals that eat bananas tell if a banana's ripe?
00:38:34,00:38:36,Best before dates.
00:38:36,00:38:37,Yeah.
00:38:37,00:38:38,"No, the color, I would say."
00:38:38,00:38:39,Yeah.
00:38:39,00:38:44,"So if it's blue, if a banana looks blue to most animals"
00:38:44,00:38:47,"that eat you like insects and stuff, then it is ripe."
00:38:47,00:38:49,"So if you shine a UV light on a banana,"
00:38:49,00:38:51,then it glows blue if it's ripened.
00:38:51,00:38:53,And that's if the chlorophyll is degraded.
00:38:53,00:38:55,"So when it's green and unripe, that's all that chlorophyll"
00:38:55,00:38:57,as the chlorophyll degrades.
00:38:57,00:38:59,Then it glows blue in UV.
00:38:59,00:39:02,"So should you shine a UV light at the supermarket on bananas,"
00:39:02,00:39:05,if you want to really know whether they're ripe or not?
00:39:05,00:39:07,"I think so, but do you have to get them to turn the lights off"
00:39:07,00:39:09,and tell if you do that?
00:39:09,00:39:10,"Right, everybody."
00:39:10,00:39:12,"Right, I'm picking my bananas."
00:39:12,00:39:15,"Turn all the lights off, please."
00:39:15,00:39:19,You've got to have a good relationship with the store manager.
00:39:19,00:39:25,Is it true that here in Norway you have UV passports?
00:39:25,00:39:26,"Oh, yeah."
00:39:26,00:39:27,That's very cool.
00:39:27,00:39:28,I think they might be the only passports.
00:39:28,00:39:32,You put UV light and it has a northern lights effect over it.
00:39:32,00:39:34,"Yeah, did any of you not know that?"
00:39:34,00:39:36,And you can go home and see it.
00:39:36,00:39:37,"Yeah, it is cool."
00:39:37,00:39:38,They're not the only ones actually.
00:39:38,00:39:39,Canada has it too.
00:39:39,00:39:40,A few more.
00:39:40,00:39:41,But I think maybe the first.
00:39:41,00:39:42,"Yeah, let's go with that."
00:39:42,00:39:43,Let's go with that.
00:39:43,00:39:50,So there was a scientist called Sean Davis.
00:39:50,00:39:55,And he wanted to put bacteria into a rat and see how it passed
00:39:55,00:39:56,through the body.
00:39:56,00:39:59,But he didn't really know how to do that because it's quite difficult
00:39:59,00:40:02,to get the stool samples and work out how many bacteria there are.
00:40:02,00:40:05,"So he genetically engineered the bacteria to glow in the dark,"
00:40:05,00:40:08,"which meant that these rats, whenever they had a poo,"
00:40:08,00:40:09,it glowed in the dark.
00:40:09,00:40:11,Who doesn't want that?
00:40:11,00:40:16,What is not useful unless you keep your poo somewhere?
00:40:16,00:40:18,Where did I leave that poo?
00:40:18,00:40:27,And it's very unhelpful if you're trying to hide a poo on a dark night.
00:40:27,00:40:30,And this feeds directly into Anna's experience.
00:40:30,00:40:35,Yes.
00:40:35,00:40:38,And he's turned off the lights because I need to choose my bananas.
00:40:38,00:40:46,"Wait, what are you doing in the corner?"
00:40:46,00:40:48,"Okay, that is it."
00:40:48,00:40:49,That is all of our facts.
