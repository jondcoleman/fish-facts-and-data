00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:25,440
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast.

3
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,800
 This week coming to you live from Oslo!

4
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,800
 [APPLAUSE]

5
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,800
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

6
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,800
 I am sitting here with Anna Chazinski, Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin.

7
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,800
 And once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

8
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,800
 And in no particular order, here we go.

9
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,800
 Starting with you, Andy.

10
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:57,800
 My fact is that there was once an Olympic sport where you had to dive into a pool and then glide along for a minute.

11
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,800
 It was scrapped because the main factor was how heavy you were.

12
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,800
 [LAUGHTER]

13
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:12,800
 Don't you think though, like, the main factor in the running race is how fast you are, so why is it not fair to have a how heavy you are?

14
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,800
 Completely. It's completely fair.

15
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,800
 You can train to be heavy in the same way you can train to run fast really.

16
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,800
 I guess so. You could see the winner coming along before the game even starts, right?

17
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:29,800
 No, he's got guard. Well, this was a thing called the plunge for distance, was the official name of it.

18
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:34,800
 So basically, you dived in, you weren't allowed to move, you weren't allowed to swim at all.

19
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,800
 You had to keep your head under the surface of the water.

20
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:42,800
 And then you were timed, and they saw how far you would get in either 60 seconds or until you put your head up above the water.

21
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,800
 Another thing is, it's not a great spectator spot, is it?

22
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:51,800
 It got called competitive floating.

23
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,800
 [LAUGHTER]

24
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,800
 It's the least spectatory sport imaginable.

25
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,800
 It happened once in St. Louis in 1904.

26
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,800
 There were lots of reviews at the time which were pretty negative.

27
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:11,800
 People sent the competitors merely throw themselves heavily in the water and float along like icebergs in the shipping lanes.

28
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:16,800
 And this was in St. Louis in 1904.

29
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,800
 Yeah, that's right.

30
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,800
 Yeah, okay. So there was lots of great things that happened in that Olympics.

31
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:26,800
 In the water polo, the Americans said that instead of having a fully inflated bowl,

32
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,800
 you could have it slightly unflated, if that's a word.

33
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:37,800
 But actually, to score a goal, you had to hold the bowl underwater in the net rather than throwing it.

34
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:43,800
 And the Germans thought that this was complete nonsense. They called it soft water polo and refused to compete.

35
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,800
 Two of the winning American water polo team were dead six months later.

36
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:57,800
 And they think it might have been because the matches took place in the lagoon that was used as a sump for the animal and vegetable waste from all the other exhibits.

37
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,800
 [LAUGHTER]

38
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,800
 Oh, God.

39
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,800
 [LAUGHTER]

40
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:09,800
 And the Germans, they brought their own diving board for the diving competition that was made out of a special coconut matting.

41
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:16,800
 And they insisted that all the scoring be on the acrobatics you did in the air, and it didn't matter how you entered the water.

42
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,800
 [LAUGHTER]

43
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,800
 Yeah, there was a massive controversy, wasn't it, in the diving.

44
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,800
 And this was what was called the fancy diving, which is what used to be the name for the high dive, basically.

45
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:33,800
 And yeah, I think the person who won was an American, and the guy who had made the trophy to present to the winner was German.

46
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,800
 And he refused to hand over the trophy because he was so outraged.

47
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,800
 [LAUGHTER]

48
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,800
 Because this is bullshit. He just landed well. The stuff in the air was useless.

49
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:47,800
 It was a very interesting Olympics. It was only 12 countries competed in the 1904 Olympics.

50
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,800
 And it largely was because no one wanted to go to St. Louis.

51
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:57,800
 They just saw it. It's too far away. It's inaccessible. But the Americans said, "Okay, we'll just put more people in."

52
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:02,800
 So 81% of the people who competed in the 1904 Olympics were Americans.

53
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,800
 [LAUGHTER]

54
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:08,800
 So there were 630 athletes in total. 523 were Americans.

55
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,800
 They won 239 medals.

56
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:17,800
 Still a record to this day of most medals won by a single nation in the Olympics.

57
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,800
 I think the runner-up was Germany who got 13, right?

58
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:29,800
 But this is a thing. This is a controversy. In fact, even in Norway, so the USA...

59
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,800
 That's where we are, if the listeners haven't realised.

60
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:42,800
 So the USA fielded athletes who were immigrants from Europe who hadn't actually become US citizens yet.

61
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,800
 So they really weren't. They shouldn't have been competing for the USA.

62
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,800
 And the Norwegians were still annoyed about this in 2012.

63
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,800
 [LAUGHTER]

64
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,800
 There was still officially requesting that the results were changed.

65
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,800
 [LAUGHTER]

66
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,800
 108 years after these Olympics.

67
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,800
 We've got a right historical wrongs where we can.

68
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,800
 [APPLAUSE]

69
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,800
 You know James U is saying that I think you said the Germans brought their own dive boards.

70
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:16,800
 Well, actually, generally people did bring their own dive boards to diving competitions.

71
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,800
 So this was until the 1960s, basically.

72
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,800
 So the diving board that we know today, which is the really springy one,

73
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,800
 and you know when you see them dive and I always think it's going to snap because it bends so much.

74
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,800
 And that was invented by a guy called Raymond Rude.

75
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,800
 And he sort of tried it out. I know it's a good name.

76
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,800
 He tried it out in a neighbor's garden for a few years and it worked.

77
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,800
 And so he brought it to the Olympics in 1960.

78
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,800
 Before that, divers were just bringing their own boards.

79
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,800
 And then they'd get there and they'd sometimes do some swaps and they'd try out each other's boards to see which ones they liked.

80
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:52,800
 And there was only when he brought his and everyone requested his to the extent that he had to like telegram back or whatever to send some more over.

81
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,800
 Because it was so in demand that people were like, should we just use this one?

82
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,800
 Did they bring the ladders as well?

83
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,800
 Or was it just the...

84
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,800
 I don't think you need a special ladder so much.

85
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,800
 Well, I think...

86
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,800
 To get up.

87
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,800
 You know, I agree you need a ladder.

88
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,800
 Yeah.

89
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,800
 And then you're also very good at the high jump.

90
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,800
 Well, that might be.

91
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,800
 What an event that would be where you do the pole vault onto it and then dive off it.

92
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,800
 Do you know how they make those... those aluminium boards?

93
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,800
 It's very cool. So they're made of aircraft grade aluminium, which I didn't know.

94
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,800
 And they take a massive cylinder of aluminium and they heat it to a very high temperature.

95
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,800
 And then they squeeze it through a massive press with thousands of tons of pressure on it.

96
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,800
 So it's like pushing it through a toothpaste tube, basically.

97
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,800
 Oh, cool.

98
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,800
 Just sort of very hot aluminium toothpaste.

99
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,800
 Well, the first one was made of a plane wing.

100
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,800
 In fact...

101
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,800
 Sorry?

102
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,800
 The first one was made of an aeroplane wing.

103
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,800
 I heard penguin.

104
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,800
 I heard penguin as well.

105
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,800
 Yeah.

106
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,800
 I mean, their wings are kind of flat, aren't they?

107
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,800
 They're almost like diving pods.

108
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,800
 Quite bouncy, blubbery quality if you get them in their own season.

109
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,800
 And here are the Antarctica team.

110
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,800
 Sorry, an aeroplane wing.

111
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,800
 Wow.

112
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,800
 An aeroplane wing.

113
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,800
 Yeah, yeah.

114
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,800
 That's cool.

115
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,800
 Somehow less funny than a penguin.

116
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,800
 I know.

117
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,800
 That's a long diving board, though.

118
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,800
 I think you sort of cut it up.

119
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,800
 Okay.

120
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,800
 You don't want to be tired by the time you've got to the end of the diving board.

121
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,800
 Ideally, you want somewhere between a penguin wing and an aeroplane wing, don't you?

122
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,800
 That's the official measurement.

123
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,800
 There was just another Olympic thing.

124
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,800
 So in 1896, in the first Olympics, there was the herdling.

125
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:48,800
 And there was a massive difference between the American team who could run and then jump over the hurdles.

126
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:54,800
 And the Greek team who would run up to the hurdles stop, jump over and then start running again.

127
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,800
 Who won?

128
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,800
 So many things.

129
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,800
 Was that part of their rules?

130
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,800
 Because they can't have thought that was the best way to do it.

131
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,800
 Well, no one would ever really done it before.

132
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,800
 It was a first Olympics.

133
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,800
 Wow.

134
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,800
 No wonder the Greek Empire fell in the end.

135
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,800
 Wouldn't be your instinct.

136
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,800
 Just on diving.

137
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:24,800
 So in Norway, the Norwegians like to dive, and specifically one particular kind of diving,

138
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,800
 called I think it's a dead thing.

139
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,800
 Is this a thing?

140
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,800
 Yeah.

141
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,800
 It's insane.

142
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:34,800
 So this is, I think the translation is death diving, or death thing, basically.

143
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,800
 And it's an annual thing.

144
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,800
 And essentially, it's a belly flop from 10 meters high.

145
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,800
 And so you get on this diving boat.

146
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,800
 Has anyone ever been to one of the competitions?

147
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,800
 Yeah.

148
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,800
 Quite a few people.

149
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,800
 Well, it sounds insane.

150
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,800
 So I was watching a lot of videos of this today, but basically these Norwegian people go up 10 meters high,

151
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,800
 and then you have to three yourself off.

152
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,800
 And you basically do as many impressive things in the air as you can.

153
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,800
 And then you're judged largely on how quickly you scrunch up at the end,

154
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,800
 and kind of avoid literally splitting your body open.

155
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,800
 But it's really funny to watch, because the commentary is just these two guys.

156
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:17,800
 They were just constantly going, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, god.

157
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,800
 It's insane.

158
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,800
 So there is a dive which is theoretically possible.

159
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,800
 There's a pair of mathematicians in the University of Australia.

160
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,800
 They've come up with a dive, because you know, you have all these different twists and solace holes in terms of all this stuff.

161
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:36,800
 So they've calculated a dive that they insist must be possible,

162
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,800
 which is you have to do one and a half summer solace and five twists.

163
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:46,800
 And that's in 1.5 seconds between time and fall and thing.

164
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,800
 And so they say they've simulated it, and they say it's possible.

165
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:54,800
 And any diver that has been asked has said, no, we can't do that.

166
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,800
 And it is done by mathematicians rather.

167
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,800
 By a mechanical scientist.

168
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,800
 It feels like they've just found the perfect sphere.

169
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,800
 They've no air resistance and just, I don't know.

170
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:16,800
 But I so desperately want to see a queue of scrawny pasty mathematicians being forced onto a diving board to prove they're working.

171
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,800
 And we're going to have to move on in a second to our next fact.

172
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,800
 Oh, just a couple more Olympic things maybe.

173
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,800
 Yeah.

174
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:30,800
 So at the first ever Winter Olympics in 1924, seven people who won medals were dead.

175
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:36,800
 Is that what the event where you had to go under the snow for as long as possible?

176
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,800
 No, the medals went to people who had achieved great things in mountaineering.

177
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,800
 And so the British expedition to Everest in 1921, despite the fact that a lot of people had died.

178
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:49,800
 Just one will mad Olympic sport that doesn't exist anymore.

179
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,800
 In 1908 in the Olympics, this was in London.

180
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,800
 In fact, dueling was a demonstration sport there.

181
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,800
 And it was really great. So it used a real gun, but it was wax pellets.

182
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,800
 So theoretically, they weren't supposed to kill you.

183
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,800
 They did travel at 87 meters a second.

184
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,800
 So they're going quite fast.

185
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:13,800
 And then they splat you, expand with a splat like an incredibly dangerous paintball.

186
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,800
 And yet, they wore some protection.

187
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,800
 So they protected their extremities and they wore big head protection.

188
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,800
 Otherwise, it would kill them.

189
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,800
 And the winner.

190
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,800
 So they also wore this big black cloak all over themselves.

191
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,800
 And on the cloak, in chalk, they had drawn out where all the vital organs are.

192
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,800
 And then they did the duel.

193
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,800
 And the winner was the person who hit closest, because it made a mark.

194
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,800
 Hit closest to the most important vital organ.

195
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,800
 That's amazing.

196
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,800
 So good.

197
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,800
 And I was reading an old newspaper report of it.

198
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,800
 And there was one pistolman who I'm going to assume was a Brit who said,

199
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,800
 apparently he announced his intention to forego the head protection,

200
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:56,800
 preferring to rely on the gentlemanly oner code that it was bad form to aim for the head.

201
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:02,800
 Just on a similar thing, in 1924, in the fencing competition,

202
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:08,800
 the French judge and the Hungarian judge really fell out and decided to have their own duel.

203
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:14,800
 That November, after the games, they met on the Yugoslav Italian border

204
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,800
 and jouled for over an hour until both men were seriously injured

205
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,800
 and the abay people had to stop the contest.

206
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,800
 Wow.

207
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,800
 OK, it is time for fact number two.

208
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,800
 And that is Chazinski.

209
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,800
 My fact this week is that at Polapark in Norway,

210
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:35,800
 you're told not to wear wool clothes in case the wolves confuse you with a sheep.

211
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:41,800
 So this is something that's a danger, apparently.

212
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,800
 This is Polapark, which has anyone been?

213
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,800
 It sounds amazing.

214
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,800
 OK, so for those of you who haven't, it's this 300-acre wildlife park.

215
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,800
 And one of their main attractions is this wolf population that they've got there

216
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,800
 and I was reading an article by someone who'd been and visited.

217
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,800
 And she said, she did meet the wolves, so you get to meet them there,

218
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,800
 sort of tame and friendly, you're told.

219
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:07,800
 But at the same time, the main wildlife keeper says,

220
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,800
 you've got to be quite careful.

221
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,800
 So for instance, they showed lots of interest in anyone who was sick, limping or weak.

222
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,800
 [LAUGHTER]

223
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,800
 You're told when you meet them to kneel down, not sit,

224
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,800
 so you can make a very quick escape.

225
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,800
 If suddenly they turn on you and you're told to remove all your wool clothing.

226
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,800
 Otherwise, so I wrote to actually the main wildlife keeper,

227
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,800
 who's a guy called Stig Slesen, to check up on this with him.

228
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,800
 And I said, is this true that you can't?

229
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,800
 And he said, yes, people are told not to wear wool.

230
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,800
 Otherwise, you might have naked people running around after meeting the wolves.

231
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,800
 [LAUGHTER]

232
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,800
 Is that sheepy smell? They can't resist it.

233
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,800
 There are a lot of things that they say you can't do if you're going there.

234
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:49,800
 So you can't wear fur, you can't wear gloves, hats, earrings.

235
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,800
 You can't be pregnant. You can't be under 18.

236
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,800
 And if they knock you over, you just have to lay there.

237
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,800
 You can't move.

238
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,800
 Why? Because they might eat you.

239
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,800
 [LAUGHTER]

240
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,800
 But I assume. I assume.

241
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,800
 But if they've knocked you over, they've got you right where they want you.

242
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,800
 Yeah. So you just have to--

243
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,800
 A wolf is a kind of animal that chases after its prey.

244
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,800
 So if it knocks you over a new panic and you run away,

245
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,800
 then it might chase after you.

246
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,800
 Yeah.

247
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,800
 But how far into the process of it eating you?

248
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,800
 If it does start to do that.

249
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,800
 Yeah.

250
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,800
 Can you deploy plan B, whatever that is?

251
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,800
 [LAUGHTER]

252
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,800
 Well, sucks when plan B is trying to outrun a very fast animal.

253
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,800
 With neither of your legs left.

254
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,800
 [LAUGHTER]

255
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:35,800
 There was just one more weird thing that the wildlife keeper said to me in his email.

256
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:39,800
 He said, another thing that we ask people not to do when they meet the wolves

257
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,800
 is related to the fact that wolves have very strong senses

258
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,800
 and they have a very strong sense of smell.

259
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,800
 So we don't encourage people to have sex before meeting our wolves.

260
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,800
 What? Wait. Do you mean, you don't mean ever, though?

261
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,800
 [LAUGHTER]

262
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,800
 Bring another virgin for the wolves.

263
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,800
 [LAUGHTER]

264
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,800
 He didn't specify.

265
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,800
 Okay. So obviously wolves are a little controversial here

266
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,800
 because some parts of Norway have a wolf taxi,

267
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,800
 which is for children going to school in areas where there are wolves.

268
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,800
 Right. Okay.

269
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:15,800
 But the rewilding is a big thing.

270
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,800
 And the way that you can rewild a wolf is really cool.

271
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:24,800
 So step one is to watch the wolves in shifts to know when they're going to mate.

272
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,800
 This is your, well, you need to what, you need to have...

273
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,800
 Where are they? Sorry, are they in a zoo or something when you watch them?

274
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,800
 You need zoo wolves to mate.

275
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,800
 So you then calculate, because I think they're pregnant for about 63 days.

276
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,800
 There are thereabouts. Yeah.

277
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,800
 [LAUGHTER]

278
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:43,800
 And then you search for a wild pack, which has recently had puppies.

279
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,800
 And you track them down.

280
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,800
 Hopefully they've got collazons, so you know what they are.

281
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:54,800
 And then you need to carry the new puppies to the pack that you found in backpacks, adorable.

282
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,800
 [LAUGHTER]

283
00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:00,800
 And you need to get to the wolf's den and you need to go in.

284
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,800
 And then you need to take your new zoo puppies and roll them around

285
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,800
 in the urine and the feces of the existing wild puppies.

286
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,800
 Right.

287
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,800
 And you also, and you sort of mix them up so they smell completely alike.

288
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,800
 And then you retreat.

289
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,800
 Wow, yeah.

290
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,800
 And then you leave the puppies behind and then you hope that they blend in.

291
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,800
 [LAUGHTER]

292
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,800
 Yeah.

293
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,800
 Isn't that weird?

294
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,800
 Imagine if you, though, were visiting the park and you quickly needed a piece.

295
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,800
 You went into a cave, had a quick was, and then they shoved their faces into that.

296
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,800
 You're now mummy.

297
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,800
 [LAUGHTER]

298
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,800
 How it works?

299
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,800
 It doesn't work, that's it.

300
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,800
 Hang on.

301
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,800
 I thought, was that what you were saying?

302
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,800
 I don't think my urine helps anything, though.

303
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,800
 [LAUGHTER]

304
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,800
 OK.

305
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:50,800
 So the rewilding of wolves and birds especially around Europe is quite big at the moment.

306
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,800
 You have quite a lot in France.

307
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,800
 You have quite a lot in Germany and Switzerland that weren't there even 20 years ago.

308
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,800
 I was speaking to my friend from Latvia and I was asking him if they have them in Latvia.

309
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,800
 And I said, do you have any wolves there?

310
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,800
 And he said, oh, yeah, we've got loads of wolves now.

311
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,800
 I said, do you have any bears?

312
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,800
 And he said, we have one bear.

313
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,800
 Although sometimes he goes over to Lithuania.

314
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,800
 [LAUGHTER]

315
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,800
 So they have 0.5 bears.

316
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,800
 [LAUGHTER]

317
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,800
 Bears are now extinct in Latvia.

318
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,800
 Oh, no, sorry.

319
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,800
 [LAUGHTER]

320
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,800
 Great news.

321
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,800
 So they're choosing to be controversial here.

322
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:27,800
 There's no way it's split, apparently.

323
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:31,800
 We agreed on this over whether wolves are bad guys or good guys.

324
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,800
 [LAUGHTER]

325
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,800
 Yeah, OK.

326
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,800
 So half of you are going to leave, after I've said this.

327
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:42,800
 But in 2009, one man personally offered a reward of 50,000 Norwegian Kroner

328
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,800
 for information leading to a person who'd illegally killed a wolf.

329
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,800
 So someone's killed a wolf.

330
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,800
 He said, here's his reward.

331
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,800
 And in response to that, he was completely--

332
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,800
 so he was vandalized.

333
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,800
 There was rubbish stuffed in his driveway, like huge piles of garbage.

334
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,800
 All of his outbuildings and his fences were vandalized.

335
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,800
 And one night, he was out of town.

336
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,800
 And his wife woke up to a loud buzzing noise to find a group of people

337
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,800
 encircling the house marching around at waving chainsaws.

338
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,800
 [LAUGHTER]

339
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:11,800
 Well, that's because he didn't make his house out of straw rob twigs, right?

340
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,800
 [LAUGHTER]

341
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:19,800
 There were licenses given out in Norway to shoot 16 wild wolves.

342
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,800
 The government decided on a call.

343
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:25,800
 And more than 11,000 hunters applied for them.

344
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,800
 [LAUGHTER]

345
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,800
 11,000.

346
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,800
 But we were very into shooting wolves for a long time, weren't we?

347
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,800
 Back when we had them.

348
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,800
 Before we did the podcast.

349
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,800
 [LAUGHTER]

350
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,800
 It was out on a shoot that we thought, you know,

351
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,800
 we should do a podcast.

352
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,800
 [LAUGHTER]

353
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,800
 Do you know I'm just speaking about it?

354
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,800
 Sorry, could you just-- what were you talking about there?

355
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,800
 Yeah, so we were big into hunting wolves.

356
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:52,800
 So they are always the archetypal bad guy, the wolf rather than the bear,

357
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,800
 which is much more likely to kill you.

358
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,800
 And England had a serious wolf problem.

359
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,800
 It would kill lots of people sheep.

360
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,800
 And eventually, everyone got so pissed off about it that in the 13th century,

361
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:06,800
 in 1281, King Edward I commissioned a guy called Peter the mighty hunter Corbit.

362
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,800
 [LAUGHTER]

363
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,800
 Andrew Hunter Murray would be so much better if you had the mighty as well.

364
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,800
 [LAUGHTER]

365
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,800
 That's a good point.

366
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,800
 I will consider it.

367
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,800
 You've got to earn a middle name like that, I think.

368
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,800
 And he definitely did.

369
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,800
 So he was told to exterminate all the wolves in England.

370
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,800
 And he did it.

371
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,800
 So apparently, by 1290, all the wolves were exterminated.

372
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,800
 He'd earned his nickname.

373
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,800
 England was rid of all the wolves.

374
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,800
 That was what was reported.

375
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:36,800
 There were no more deaths of livestock by wolves anymore.

376
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,800
 And he was known from then on as the unimplied.

377
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,800
 [LAUGHTER]

378
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:49,800
 There are some monkeys which have started domesticating wolves we think.

379
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,800
 [LAUGHTER]

380
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,800
 So this is really exciting.

381
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,800
 This is like dogs 2.0, basically.

382
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:00,800
 There are bits of Ethiopia, where there are Ethiopian wolves,

383
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,800
 which are particular species, and Galada monkeys.

384
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,800
 And they're getting on really well.

385
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:10,800
 And the wolves don't eat the baby monkeys when they're hanging around together.

386
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,800
 And the Galadas don't object to the wolves.

387
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,800
 So this is very similar to the way that humans domesticated wolves

388
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,800
 in the first place.

389
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,800
 And they will just sit next to each other for a couple of hours at a time,

390
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,800
 just ignoring each other.

391
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,800
 So they seem to be deliberately hanging out together.

392
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,800
 OK.

393
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,800
 But hey.

394
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,800
 So when we're traveling from one city to another,

395
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,800
 and you're just sat there ignoring me?

396
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,800
 I'm, I'm domesticating you.

397
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,800
 [LAUGHTER]

398
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:39,800
 [APPLAUSE]

399
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:44,800
 No, but anyway, the wolves seem to find it easier to catch rodents

400
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,800
 when they're hanging around with the monkeys.

401
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,800
 And we don't know why.

402
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,800
 OK.

403
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,800
 So it might be there's a food reward in it for them.

404
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,800
 And so that will be the next big thing.

405
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,800
 [LAUGHTER]

406
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,800
 Big thing in what?

407
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,800
 In evolution, they're going to be the new humans and dogs.

408
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,800
 Is what you're saying?

409
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,800
 I'm trying to pitch it as the new humans and dogs.

410
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,800
 Yeah.

411
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,800
 It works.

412
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,800
 Wolves do team up with other creatures for hunting.

413
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,800
 So there was a great headline in the Washington Post,

414
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,800
 which was wolves and hyenas hunt together.

415
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,800
 Prove Middle East peace process is possible.

416
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:22,800
 [LAUGHTER]

417
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,800
 OK.

418
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,800
 It is time for fact number three.

419
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,800
 And that is my fact.

420
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,800
 My fact this week is that this year,

421
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,800
 Doctors in Vietnam saved the man's life

422
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:35,800
 by pumping 15 cans of beer into his body.

423
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:39,800
 [APPLAUSE]

424
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,800
 If I didn't have to do that in no way,

425
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,800
 you'd have to mortgage your house.

426
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,800
 [LAUGHTER]

427
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,800
 So this was a guy who very sadly was dying

428
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,800
 from alcohol poisoning.

429
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,800
 He was, yeah, so not so funny now, is it?

430
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,800
 [LAUGHTER]

431
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,800
 48 years old and he fell unconscious.

432
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,800
 They took him to the hospital and he had huge levels

433
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,800
 of methanol in him.

434
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,800
 He had more than a thousand times what would be

435
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,800
 the recommended limit.

436
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,800
 [LAUGHTER]

437
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,800
 And so, yeah, so basically what they had to do is

438
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,800
 they had to administer more cans of beer into him

439
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,800
 because the idea was that they needed to slow down

440
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,800
 the metabolizing process that his liver was doing.

441
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,800
 Yeah.

442
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,800
 And by slowing it down and by putting in total

443
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,800
 these 15 cans of one an hour,

444
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,800
 they managed to slow it enough that they could fix him.

445
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,800
 Yeah.

446
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,800
 So what it is is that the beer contains ethanol.

447
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,800
 And your body always does the ethanol

448
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,800
 before it does the methanol.

449
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,800
 So you put all this beer in, it's dealing with the ethanol

450
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,800
 and it gives you a bit of time to get the methanol out.

451
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,800
 But they do still need to suck the methanol out, didn't they?

452
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,800
 Otherwise, you just got rid of all the ethanol you've pumped in

453
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,800
 and then the methanol comes back.

454
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,800
 How do you suck methanol out of someone?

455
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,800
 Does it gather somewhere in your body?

456
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,800
 Yeah, it's through dialysis.

457
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,800
 Okay.

458
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,800
 Yeah.

459
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,800
 [LAUGHTER]

460
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,800
 So the kidney?

461
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,800
 Yes.

462
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,800
 Yeah, cool.

463
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,800
 Sometimes it's just questions and answers.

464
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,800
 [LAUGHTER]

465
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,800
 But he survived, so it's a good ending to that.

466
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,800
 That's a good story.

467
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,800
 It's great.

468
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,800
 But don't try it on any old illness.

469
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,800
 I'm not sure we're recommending it, are we?

470
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,800
 No.

471
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,800
 Oh, well, some people recommended it.

472
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,800
 Oh, okay, yes we are.

473
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,800
 [LAUGHTER]

474
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,800
 But there are lots of medicines

475
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,800
 which used to be just pure alcohol, basically.

476
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,800
 So in the 19th century,

477
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:25,800
 Lydia E. Pinkham's vegetable compound for female complaints.

478
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,800
 [LAUGHTER]

479
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:30,800
 It said it was herbal and it was entirely alcohol, basically.

480
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,800
 And it was aimed at women.

481
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,800
 The slogan was, "Only a woman can understand

482
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,800
 another woman's ills."

483
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,800
 Right?

484
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,800
 And women were encouraged to write to Lydia Pinkham,

485
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,800
 who was the woman on the bottle, you know, for personal advice.

486
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:46,800
 And Lydia Pinkham had a very large number of typists who just replied for her,

487
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:50,800
 recommending that these women take higher doses of Mrs. Pinkham's

488
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,800
 vegetable compound.

489
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:55,800
 They kept this going for 20 years after Lydia Pinkham died.

490
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,800
 Wow.

491
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,800
 Really?

492
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,800
 Yeah, eventually I thought she's been replied to these letters for a very long time.

493
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,800
 [LAUGHTER]

494
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,800
 Yeah.

495
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,800
 It is effective, though, alcohol, in a lot of ways.

496
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,800
 It's probably the most--

497
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,800
 [LAUGHTER]

498
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,800
 Medicinally.

499
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,800
 [APPLAUSE]

500
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,800
 And not for easing social situations, just in medicine.

501
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:17,800
 But I think it's probably the most effective medicine that existed in humanity

502
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:21,800
 for many thousand years in terms of its sterilizing qualities.

503
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,800
 Right?

504
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,800
 So amazing sterilizing, if you've got a wound, purifying water.

505
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:29,800
 So the death rates in the 19th century, if people hadn't been able to drink beer instead of

506
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,800
 water, tap water in most places would have been much higher.

507
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,800
 It's a relaxant.

508
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,800
 And so there have been all these studies as well.

509
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,800
 And I might get in trouble for saying this, but it's genuinely,

510
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,800
 if you look rigorously at the research.

511
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:46,800
 So there's a guy who looked at hundreds of studies into the effects of moderate drinking.

512
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:50,800
 And once you've controlled for all factors, so once you've controlled for, like,

513
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:56,800
 social factors, economic factors, age, weight, stuff like that, even once you've eradicated

514
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:03,800
 those, you'll increase mortality if you are a heavy drinker or an abstainer is higher

515
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,800
 than if you're a moderate drinker.

516
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:11,800
 So if you're an abstainer, you have 51% higher mortality rate or risk than if you're a moderate drinker.

517
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,800
 And moderate is two glasses of wine a day.

518
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,800
 [APPLAUSE]

519
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:20,800
 So, and how many of you had so far tonight, Ella?

520
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,800
 Right.

521
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,800
 I got very big glasses.

522
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,800
 I think it's weird to recommend to daily allowance.

523
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,800
 It's half of that.

524
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,800
 And yes.

525
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,800
 Just on the medical thing about how it was really important over history,

526
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:36,800
 one really weird thing is that the ancient Nubians used to make beer.

527
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,800
 And as part of their beer, they made this thing called tetracycline.

528
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,800
 It was just kind of an off-product of it.

529
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,800
 And this actually is one of our greatest antibiotics.

530
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,800
 Which was only invented in the modern day in the 1940s.

531
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:51,800
 And so what loads of archaeologists have found is these bodies

532
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,800
 with this amazing modern antibiotic in it.

533
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,800
 And they're like, where the hell has this come from?

534
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:00,800
 They said it was the equivalent of seeing an Egyptian mummy wearing Rayban sunglasses.

535
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,800
 [LAUGHTER]

536
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,800
 But it came from their beer.

537
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,800
 Yeah.

538
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,800
 That's very cool.

539
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,800
 Yeah, incredible.

540
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,800
 See?

541
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,800
 That's very cool.

542
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:13,800
 And used to get prescriptions for alcohol sometimes during the days of prohibition.

543
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:17,800
 So if you were willing to pay $6 for a prescription,

544
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,800
 you would get a pint of alcohol in America when it was banned.

545
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,800
 And one of the people who did this was Winston Churchill.

546
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,800
 Right.

547
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,800
 So he was in America in 1931.

548
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,800
 He looked the wrong way when he was crossing the road.

549
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,800
 And he was hit by a car.

550
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,800
 And he had some complications.

551
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,800
 And he had months of medical problems, he was really in pain.

552
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,800
 And so he got a doctor to write him a prescription.

553
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:40,800
 And the doctor wrote, "The post-accident convalescence of Winston Churchill

554
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:44,800
 necessitates the use of alcoholic spirits, especially at meal times."

555
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,800
 [LAUGHTER]

556
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,800
 Good.

557
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,800
 But not beer.

558
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,800
 You couldn't risk my beer.

559
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,800
 Right.

560
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,800
 There was this bizarre controversy.

561
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,800
 So people were really anti-beer from medicinal reasons.

562
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:00,800
 And there was a guy called, he was the attorney general in America called Mitchell Palmer.

563
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,800
 And he was under a lot of pressure from Brewers.

564
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,800
 So he said, fine, give sick people beer if it helps them.

565
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,800
 Which it often would to relax you.

566
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:11,800
 And he said, you could prescribe it at any time.

567
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:16,800
 And he said, commercial drug stores should be able to sell it from kind of soda fountains.

568
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:21,800
 So there was almost a time where pharmacies across America had a beer fountain during prohibition.

569
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,800
 [LAUGHTER]

570
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:27,800
 And then all those bloody abolitionists got involved and said that he couldn't do it.

571
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,800
 And he was kicked out.

572
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,800
 And then prescribing beer at all was banned.

573
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,800
 Wow.

574
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,800
 But they do it today still in American hospitals.

575
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:39,800
 It's from an article that I read where someone was visiting a friend and the food came in,

576
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,800
 which was just the classic lunch they get.

577
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,800
 But on the tray was a can of Budweiser.

578
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:47,800
 And it's because certain patients, if they're going, let's say through withdrawal,

579
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:51,800
 that's not helpful in their situation to be suddenly cut off from alcohol.

580
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,800
 So this same patient was given it for breakfast as well.

581
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,800
 So it would be sort of, you know, eggs and Budweiser for breakfast.

582
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,800
 [LAUGHTER]

583
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,800
 And that goes on still.

584
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,800
 It's not necessarily seen as a bad thing.

585
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,800
 Mariah Carey had it.

586
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,800
 Not a person who gets a lot of airtime in this podcast.

587
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,800
 [LAUGHTER]

588
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:14,800
 She was actually investigated by the police, by the LA Department of Children and Family Services,

589
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:19,800
 because TMZ reported that she had been drinking beer while she was breastfeeding.

590
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,800
 She had newborn twins.

591
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,800
 And she said the nurse told me to do it.

592
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:26,800
 And the nurse had told her that Guinness can help breastfeeders.

593
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,800
 So it loosens up your milk and stuff.

594
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,800
 And actually, I was talking to our boss about this the other day.

595
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,800
 She was always told that.

596
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,800
 And she always did it.

597
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:36,800
 She used to be told, in the past, it was always said that you should drink Guinness, I think.

598
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,800
 Yeah.

599
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,800
 Oh, breastfeeding or not breastfeeding, really?

600
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,800
 [LAUGHTER]

601
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,800
 That might have been when we were in Ireland a few weeks ago.

602
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,800
 Yeah, I said that.

603
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,800
 We're going to have to move on soon.

604
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:50,800
 Oh, one alcohol you might not want to drink when breastfeeding or otherwise is an Icelandic alcohol

605
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,800
 made from a whale's testicle.

606
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,800
 [LAUGHTER]

607
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:59,800
 The guy who made it said, we smoke the testicle by the old Icelandic way with dried sheep shit.

608
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:02,800
 [LAUGHTER]

609
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:07,800
 And this method gives the beer a really unique smoke flavour.

610
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,800
 [LAUGHTER]

611
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,800
 Fancy some of that?

612
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,800
 Unique.

613
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,800
 [LAUGHTER]

614
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,800
 OK, what about this?

615
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,800
 There's a beer made from elephant dung.

616
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:20,800
 And they use coffee beans that pass through an elephant's digestive system to make the beer.

617
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:24,800
 And instead of talking about an aftertaste, they talk about an afterglow.

618
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,800
 [LAUGHTER]

619
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:31,800
 And there is a new whiskey that has been made flavoured with the anal secretions of beavers.

620
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,800
 [LAUGHTER]

621
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:38,800
 And on the website it says, the sack excretion exhibits bright and fruit qualities.

622
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,800
 [LAUGHTER]

623
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:43,800
 And rich leathery notes along with a creamy vanilla aroma.

624
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,800
 [LAUGHTER]

625
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,800
 Mmm.

626
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:52,800
 You don't want creamy, anyone, anal secretions, if you're having to consume them, I don't think.

627
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,800
 [LAUGHTER]

628
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:59,800
 I've got one more prescription that was dished out just because this was about, you know, prescribing beer effectively.

629
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:05,800
 Cambridge University have just published a load of their patient records from the 1590s to the 1630s.

630
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,800
 And it's got thousands and thousands, they've got 80,000 case notes.

631
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:13,800
 But they're incredibly hard to read because obviously the writing is extremely, you know,

632
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,800
 it's just very different to our writing today.

633
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,800
 But they've finally put up a batch online.

634
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:26,800
 And the prescriptions include things like the broth of the testicles of a bore pig beaten to a powder and quite a lot of pigeons.

635
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:31,800
 So one thing that occurs frequently is pigeon slippers.

636
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:35,800
 A doxil will frequently prescribe, you put a pigeon on each foot.

637
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,800
 [LAUGHTER]

638
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,800
 And you just, a dead pigeon.

639
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,800
 Oh, a dead pigeon.

640
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,800
 And you just cut it open, pop it on your feet, walk around.

641
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,800
 [LAUGHTER]

642
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,800
 And what is that supposed to help?

643
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,800
 I can't remember what it was actually helping.

644
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,800
 [LAUGHTER]

645
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,800
 I mean, oh, it doesn't help the pigeon very much.

646
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,800
 And some, some, like, they vary the prescription.

647
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,800
 There's one prescription which says a pigeon on each foot.

648
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,800
 One says a pigeon on the neck and to each foot.

649
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,800
 And the other one just says half a pigeon to each foot.

650
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,800
 [LAUGHTER]

651
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,800
 It's not like when you split a paracetamol in half.

652
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,800
 It's like the headaches not that bad.

653
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,800
 I'll just do the half pigeon today.

654
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,800
 Yeah.

655
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,800
 [LAUGHTER]

656
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:15,800
 They did use to-- I don't even know what I'm saying this-- but--

657
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,800
 Let's say--

658
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,800
 Because I think this is what it might be.

659
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:21,800
 They used to use, I think, the anus of a pigeon

660
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:24,800
 to suck stuff out of bubos for the plague,

661
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,800
 because it has quite good suction.

662
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,800
 [LAUGHTER]

663
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,800
 Yes.

664
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,800
 I thought it was snake bites as well.

665
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,800
 It was.

666
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,800
 I think-- Oh, OK.

667
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:36,800
 Pliny recommended take a pigeon, shove its anus on your bite,

668
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,800
 and it will suck it out.

669
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,800
 It turns out it doesn't.

670
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,800
 And then you just die looking like an idiot

671
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,800
 who would help a pigeon.

672
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,800
 [LAUGHTER]

673
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,800
 But it wasn't.

674
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,800
 It was for everything, the pigeon thing.

675
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,800
 It wasn't just for plague.

676
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,800
 It was everything.

677
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,800
 Some of your peeps did it at one point.

678
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:50,800
 I was white, did I think?

679
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,800
 But what I know is it was a last result.

680
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,800
 So if someone brought in the pigeon,

681
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:58,800
 you knew that that you were on your way out.

682
00:31:58,800 --> 00:31:59,800
 I was reading a saw.

683
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,800
 So it was like, I'm dorked.

684
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,800
 It was her father's bedside.

685
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,800
 And he was really sick.

686
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,800
 And he saw the nurse bring in the pigeon.

687
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,800
 And he went, ah, I see.

688
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,800
 [LAUGHTER]

689
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,800
 The thing that has never worked.

690
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,800
 [LAUGHTER]

691
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,800
 Thank you.

692
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,800
 [LAUGHTER]

693
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,800
 OK.

694
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,800
 It is time for our final fact of the show.

695
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,800
 And that is James.

696
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:22,800
 OK.

697
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,800
 My fact this week is that if you put a bunch of millipedes

698
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:29,800
 in a nightclub, all the genitals will glow in different colors.

699
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:36,800
 [APPLAUSE]

700
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,800
 By the way, if you've not been to a nightclub with James,

701
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,800
 it is fucking awesome.

702
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,800
 [LAUGHTER]

703
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,800
 If you go to a nightclub with a millipede,

704
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,800
 it's like put your left foot in.

705
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,800
 And your left foot in.

706
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,800
 And your left foot in.

707
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,800
 And your left foot in.

708
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,800
 [LAUGHTER]

709
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,800
 What nightclub are you going to?

710
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,800
 [LAUGHTER]

711
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,800
 The under eight.

712
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,800
 [LAUGHTER]

713
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,800
 That was the last time I was in a nightclub.

714
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,800
 What if you're happy if you know it or not?

715
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,800
 Let's get some row row your boat up there, DJ.

716
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,800
 [LAUGHTER]

717
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,800
 Well, you give this fact some respect, please.

718
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:14,800
 [LAUGHTER]

719
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,800
 What's the-- why--

720
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:16,800
 Sorry, this was the--

721
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:20,800
 OK, so these are flat-backed millipedes

722
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,800
 in the genus pseudo polydespus specifically.

723
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:27,800
 And they all look almost identical, regardless of their species,

724
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,800
 because they're just like two centimetre long little brown things.

725
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:38,800
 But scientists have found out that if you shine ultraviolet light

726
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,800
 on their genitals, then it's like a disco.

727
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:42,800
 [LAUGHTER]

728
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,800
 Cool.

729
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,800
 It's all these greens and blues and some of them

730
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,800
 are shiny and others and stuff like that.

731
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,800
 And this is like a really good way of telling the different species,

732
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,800
 because before you would have to probably kill one and get the DNA

733
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,800
 to see whether it was a different species.

734
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,800
 Wow.

735
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:58,800
 So if you're having a nightclub and you think,

736
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,800
 what is that sort of middle-aged nerd in the corner doing

737
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:05,800
 with what looks like a bag of insects?

738
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,800
 I'm going to stick with a mirror ball, I think,

739
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:12,800
 to decorate my desks rather than a rotating ceiling full of millipede dicks.

740
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,800
 [LAUGHTER]

741
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,800
 Do we know why this happens?

742
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,800
 So you can tell species--

743
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,800
 Is it so they can tell each other?

744
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:23,800
 Yeah, we actually don't know why, which is sad.

745
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:27,800
 Yeah, all we know is that it's still a mystery.

746
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,800
 But millipedes are basically blind.

747
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,800
 Yeah, so they wouldn't be able to see--

748
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,800
 They wouldn't get to enjoy it.

749
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,800
 They wouldn't get to enjoy it, probably ever.

750
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,800
 I don't know how great they look.

751
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,800
 What is that?

752
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,800
 Yeah, very sad.

753
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,800
 Is it males and females?

754
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,800
 I think it is just males.

755
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,800
 OK.

756
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,800
 There has been this.

757
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,800
 And now I think it's both.

758
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,800
 And now I think it's just females.

759
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,800
 That'll lead it so nicely.

760
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,800
 There has been this incredible explosion over the last 20 years

761
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:03,800
 of people discovering that basically all animals glow fluorescent.

762
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,800
 Right?

763
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,800
 It's so bizarre.

764
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,800
 And it's weird that they never discovered it before.

765
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,800
 So for instance, just this year, or I think maybe last year,

766
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,800
 a scientist accidentally discovered that flying squirrels,

767
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,800
 you know, North American flying squirrels,

768
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,800
 glow pink under UV light.

769
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,800
 And that was just-- he was out in the forest.

770
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,800
 It was a guy called John Martin, a forestry professor.

771
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,800
 And he was shining a UV light up to look for light chin

772
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,800
 and fungi and some frogs that glow under UV light.

773
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,800
 And you notice that all the flying squirrels

774
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,800
 were glowing pink.

775
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,800
 And again, we don't know why.

776
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,800
 I think maybe it's to blend in with stuff like light chin

777
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,800
 so that predators can't see them.

778
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,800
 Maybe it shows you're healthy for a mate.

779
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,800
 But how have we not shot UV lights?

780
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,800
 Well, the thing is humans, we can't see UV light.

781
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,800
 So this has just been a complete mystery for us for so long.

782
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,800
 There is a way to be able to see UV lights.

783
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,800
 If you have your cataracts removed, some people--

784
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,800
 if you have cataracts surgery, some people

785
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,800
 can see ultraviolet light.

786
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,800
 And Monet had this, for instance.

787
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,800
 Right.

788
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,800
 So it is possible that Monet would have been able

789
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,800
 to see these genitals of the millipedes.

790
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,800
 [LAUGHTER]

791
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,800
 I should add, it is very fun to go to a nightclub with James.

792
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,800
 But you do have to go and get your cataracts removed before you go.

793
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,800
 It's a bit less fun that bit.

794
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,800
 Yeah.

795
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,800
 So they think that after he had the lens out of his eye,

796
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,800
 he painted slightly different paintings.

797
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,800
 Yeah, his paintings were a little bit more towards the purple side

798
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,800
 of the spectrum.

799
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,800
 For that reason.

800
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,800
 Very cool.

801
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,800
 Some scientists have started making animals fluorescent as well,

802
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,800
 which is very exciting.

803
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,800
 So at Imperial College of London,

804
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:36,800
 they've started deliberately making mosquitoes with fluorescent testicles.

805
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,800
 And it's just males again.

806
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,800
 And there's a really good reason for this, which is that.

807
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,800
 So they were genetically modified.

808
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,800
 So there's a glowing protein which only expresses itself in their testicles.

809
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:51,800
 And the reason this is useful is you can identify males and females very early,

810
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:55,800
 so you can release sterile males into the world at large

811
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,800
 without accidentally releasing any female mosquitoes.

812
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,800
 Because female mosquitoes are the ones who spread malaria.

813
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,800
 That's why it's important.

814
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,800
 But when you said there's a really good reason for this,

815
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,800
 it did just sound like your professor had walked into the lab.

816
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,800
 Then why the hell are those mosquitoes balls glowing?

817
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,800
 There's a very good reason for this.

818
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,800
 Just on things glowing.

819
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,800
 There's a deep sea worm called Tomopterus.

820
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,800
 And it's transparent, which is very useful,

821
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,800
 because it means it's much harder to see it if you're a predator.

822
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,800
 And it can also make a part of its body glow on command

823
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,800
 and then release that part as a decoy.

824
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,800
 Oh, cool.

825
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:36,800
 Cool.

826
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,800
 Wow.

827
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,800
 But then it's lost part of its body.

828
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,800
 Yeah.

829
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,800
 They can only do it so many times.

830
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,800
 That's very true.

831
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,800
 Yeah.

832
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,800
 Once you're getting down to making your head glow,

833
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,800
 you're in real, real trouble.

834
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,800
 That is really cool, though.

835
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,800
 There's a chameleon at which, if you put it under UV lights,

836
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,800
 we'll glow in the dark and like a little blue glow.

837
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,800
 And it's actually the bones that are glowing.

838
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,800
 And you can see them under the skin.

839
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,800
 Whoa.

840
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,800
 This is amazing.

841
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,800
 And again, we don't know why it happens.

842
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,800
 But it's basically, you know, like if you go to a Halloween party

843
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:15,800
 as a skeleton, and all you can see is the glowing bones.

844
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,800
 Yeah.

845
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,800
 These chameleons are like that.

846
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,800
 Or maybe, so maybe if a predator comes,

847
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,800
 they go, oh, someone's already eaten that one.

848
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,800
 [LAUGHTER]

849
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:27,800
 [APPLAUSE]

850
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,800
 We're going to have to wrap up very shortly.

851
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:34,800
 Do you know how animals that eat bananas tell if a banana's ripe?

852
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,800
 Best before dates.

853
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,800
 Yeah.

854
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,800
 No, the color, I would say.

855
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,800
 Yeah.

856
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:44,800
 So if it's blue, if a banana looks blue to most animals

857
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,800
 that eat you like insects and stuff, then it is ripe.

858
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,800
 So if you shine a UV light on a banana,

859
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,800
 then it glows blue if it's ripened.

860
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,800
 And that's if the chlorophyll is degraded.

861
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,800
 So when it's green and unripe, that's all that chlorophyll

862
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,800
 as the chlorophyll degrades.

863
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,800
 Then it glows blue in UV.

864
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,800
 So should you shine a UV light at the supermarket on bananas,

865
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,800
 if you want to really know whether they're ripe or not?

866
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,800
 I think so, but do you have to get them to turn the lights off

867
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,800
 and tell if you do that?

868
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,800
 Right, everybody.

869
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,800
 Right, I'm picking my bananas.

870
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,800
 Turn all the lights off, please.

871
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:19,800
 You've got to have a good relationship with the store manager.

872
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:25,800
 Is it true that here in Norway you have UV passports?

873
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:26,800
 Oh, yeah.

874
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,800
 That's very cool.

875
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,800
 I think they might be the only passports.

876
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,800
 You put UV light and it has a northern lights effect over it.

877
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,800
 Yeah, did any of you not know that?

878
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,800
 And you can go home and see it.

879
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,800
 Yeah, it is cool.

880
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:38,800
 They're not the only ones actually.

881
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,800
 Canada has it too.

882
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,800
 A few more.

883
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,800
 But I think maybe the first.

884
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,800
 Yeah, let's go with that.

885
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,800
 Let's go with that.

886
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:50,800
 So there was a scientist called Sean Davis.

887
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:55,800
 And he wanted to put bacteria into a rat and see how it passed

888
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,800
 through the body.

889
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,800
 But he didn't really know how to do that because it's quite difficult

890
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:02,800
 to get the stool samples and work out how many bacteria there are.

891
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,800
 So he genetically engineered the bacteria to glow in the dark,

892
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,800
 which meant that these rats, whenever they had a poo,

893
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,800
 it glowed in the dark.

894
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,800
 Who doesn't want that?

895
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:16,800
 What is not useful unless you keep your poo somewhere?

896
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,800
 Where did I leave that poo?

897
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:27,800
 And it's very unhelpful if you're trying to hide a poo on a dark night.

898
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,800
 And this feeds directly into Anna's experience.

899
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:35,800
 Yes.

900
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,800
 And he's turned off the lights because I need to choose my bananas.

901
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:46,800
 Wait, what are you doing in the corner?

902
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,800
 Okay, that is it.

903
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,800
 That is all of our facts.

904
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,800
