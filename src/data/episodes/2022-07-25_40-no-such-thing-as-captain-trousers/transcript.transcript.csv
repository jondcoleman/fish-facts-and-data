00:00:00,00:00:04,We run it on QI a few years ago. Yeah. Which was there's no such thing as a fish.
00:00:04,00:00:09,"No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life."
00:00:09,00:00:12,"He says it right there, first paragraph. No such thing as a fish."
00:00:12,00:00:24,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you"
00:00:24,00:00:28,from the QI offices in Covenant Garden. My name is Dan Schreiber. I'm sitting here with
00:00:28,00:00:33,Anna Chazinski and Miller and Andy Murray and once again we have gathered around the microphones
00:00:33,00:00:38,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in a particular order here we go.
00:00:38,00:00:47,"Starting with you, Andy. My fact is that in 18th century France, tooth pullers were entertainers"
00:00:47,00:00:53,who performed in front of cheering crowds. So one of them had the party trick of pulling teeth out
00:00:53,00:00:58,of a patient with one hand while firing a pistol with the other and all the while he had his head
00:00:58,00:01:03,in a sack. Why was he shooting? I don't get the gun shooting bit. It's just as a touch of
00:01:03,00:01:10,flamboyant. Exactly. Yeah. It was entertainment. Yeah. It's got a really painful tooth. Great.
00:01:10,00:01:16,"Well, I've got to show on at 8 p.m. You can make it. There was one guy who did that in the late 1800s"
00:01:16,00:01:20,who was called Edgar Parker. He might be the person you're talking about. Okay.
00:01:20,00:01:24,He's a Edgar Parker and he changed his name by Deadpool to painless Parker. That's really cool.
00:01:24,00:01:31,Okay. Yeah. James IV of Scotland was a keen amateur dentist. A keen amateur sounds a bit like he
00:01:31,00:01:36,"wasn't good at being even an amateur. Yeah. It's quite really hard. Yeah. Don't give up, son."
00:01:36,00:01:43,Don't give up. You will wonder. You could make amateur. Glorious day. Well Peter the Great
00:01:43,00:01:49,did that as well. He practiced it on his noble dentistry. So if you had a tooth ache and Peter the
00:01:49,00:01:52,"Great was around, you had to keep it to yourself. Otherwise you'd say, come on, get in the chair."
00:01:52,00:01:57,"No one is easier. Yeah. Oh, what was that? You got a sore tooth? No, no, it's headache."
00:01:57,00:02:00,It's headache. It's headache. It's headache. I have something for that. I'll just get my hammer.
00:02:00,00:02:06,Just get my brain sore and he kept all the extracted teeth in a little bag. He was very proud of it.
00:02:06,00:02:11,And it's now in the the Kunstkamera at the museum in St Peter's book. There's a bunch of fairies
00:02:11,00:02:16,planning a heist at the same level though. Yes. Mark Zuckerberg's dad is a dentist and his website
00:02:16,00:02:21,advertises or used to advertise. We cater for cowards and he's he's specifically targets people
00:02:21,00:02:26,"who have dentist. That's a really good idea, because they're quite anti-anxious and we don't need it"
00:02:26,00:02:30,"but some people get so freaked out by the dentist. His website should say, we pulled teeth out of"
00:02:30,00:02:38,your Facebook. So I read that the Egyptians used to use toothpaste way before toothbrushes were
00:02:38,00:02:43,"invented. Yeah. But it doesn't sound very nice. It was things like ox hooves, ashes, burnt eggshells"
00:02:43,00:02:50,"and pumice. Oh yeah, lovely. Sounds penis. That's what you're saying. A punist. Worst chasturbine ever."
00:02:50,00:02:58,Oh excuse for infidelity. I lost my toothbrush darling. The bummer happened to be here.
00:02:58,00:03:05,"So the Egyptians used to use the gross toothpaste 5,000 years before the toothbrushes were invented."
00:03:05,00:03:10,The toothbrush was maybe the bristles from a pig's neck. Bristles from a pig's neck?
00:03:10,00:03:14,"Damn, like better than the penis is the age of the dentist. That's true, it's definitely an improvement."
00:03:16,00:03:21,"In 2013, a man escaped from prison in Sweden to go to the dentist. He went to the dentist,"
00:03:21,00:03:24,he had the affected tooth pulled out and then he reported himself to the police and they took him
00:03:24,00:03:29,back to prison. He got a day added to his sentence as punishment. That's fantastic. Yeah.
00:03:29,00:03:36,Did he book? You've got one phone call. You should have known really where he was going.
00:03:36,00:03:42,"Yeah, on the 27th. Next one. Yeah, that's fine. 3 p.m. Okay, cool. I might be a bit sweaty"
00:03:42,00:03:50,"in the shovel one hour. I just want you to know that. What I'm here, do you have large sums of cash"
00:03:50,00:03:57,"on the premises? Just because your fact was about, obviously, funny sort of entertainment in"
00:03:57,00:04:05,"centuries past and freak shows. There was a guy, Joseph Pujon or Pujon, who in the 19th century"
00:04:05,00:04:13,"made his living by farting and his living was, yeah, yeah, what standard was he? Was he what? Yes,"
00:04:13,00:04:17,"he was a putter main. There's a whole film about him. He was incredible. Yes, there is. The matter"
00:04:17,00:04:23,"of a good fact. Yeah, he could suck air in through his bottom and then do tunes? He retired from"
00:04:23,00:04:29,"his farting career to become a baker after the first. Oh no, I wouldn't need his pie. I do want"
00:04:29,00:04:35,"to have success when he was in that. So he went from breaking winter, breaking bread. Oh, just a joke"
00:04:35,00:04:42,"for you. He claimed that the farts also did not smell. He memorably said, my parents ruined themselves"
00:04:42,00:04:49,sending my rectum. Who is this man? Who's that mean? He was a French cabaret entertainer.
00:04:49,00:04:54,"Well, cabaret's really improved. His parents have spent an enormous amount of money making sure"
00:04:54,00:05:01,that his farts did not smell bad. Like a cent like a centred candle. Can you use yourself as an air
00:05:01,00:05:07,"freshener, do you think? High and self-help to people who are bad. Every 15 minutes who just releases"
00:05:07,00:05:16,"another waft of lavender into the room. Okay, time for fact number two. And that is Anna."
00:05:16,00:05:22,"My fact this week is that in the First World War, the Romanian army issued an order that only"
00:05:22,00:05:30,officers above the rank of major had the right to wear eyeshadow in battle. There are so many
00:05:30,00:05:36,"elements in that. The rank of major, then wearing eyeshadow and then in battle, simply outside battle,"
00:05:36,00:05:41,"all bets were off. Yeah, outside battle, you can do what you want. You're worth socks on your nose."
00:05:41,00:05:44,"That's the army, isn't it? Outside battle. We don't care what you do. Have a good time."
00:05:44,00:05:49,"No, but I still are right. I think Neil Vonage is okay. But again, in the US Army New Regulations,"
00:05:49,00:05:55,"there's recently been a ban on men wearing nail polish. Who's doing that? In China and Japan, a few"
00:05:55,00:06:00,"thousand years ago, everyone painted the nails. I just think you did. Maybe there's a, that's a"
00:06:00,00:06:04,niche little kind of tribute group to ancient China that exists in the US Army that I mean to crack
00:06:04,00:06:10,"down on. The Romans is to painting the nails with blood. It'd go weird brown almost immediately,"
00:06:10,00:06:14,wouldn't it? Yeah. We'd like you to reapply our fresh supply. Yeah. That was the only reason
00:06:14,00:06:19,they were saying murderers actually. Because they can tell who was murdering because everyone
00:06:19,00:06:23,"blood on their hands. In those days, you've got blood on your hands, wasn't a bad thing. It was just"
00:06:23,00:06:28,"a statement of fact about everyone looking at you blood on your hands. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah,"
00:06:28,00:06:33,"superdrug, two, three, four. Smudge a little bit. Actually, it's also on your knife."
00:06:33,00:06:40,"But that's where we get cosmetics from, is Roman Times. They had Cosmety, who were slaves,"
00:06:40,00:06:44,whose job was to apply makeup and perfume to their mistress and help out with the toilet.
00:06:44,00:06:48,"So that's where we get the web from. Cosmety. Look, cool. Do you know where we've got the word"
00:06:48,00:06:51,"makeup from? We've seen all the adverts from Max Factor, the makeup of makeup artists."
00:06:51,00:06:55,"Yeah. Isn't that a guy called Max Factor? Yes. So his name was Max Emilian in fact Doritz,"
00:06:55,00:06:59,"he's from Poland, and he coined makeup as a noun from to make up your face as a verb,"
00:06:59,00:07:04,and he was the first one turning into a noun. He was the first person. Max Factor. And that is why
00:07:04,00:07:07,it's extremely hard to research makeup if you're looking for what people were wearing in the
00:07:07,00:07:13,"olden times as a brand new bloody word, and there's no real, all the equivalent for it. Except for"
00:07:13,00:07:17,on your hands. Turns out some of history's biggest murderers were actually just height of fashion.
00:07:17,00:07:23,"Ancient Romans, who were bold, would disguise it by painting their heads."
00:07:23,00:07:29,"Weirdly, when it rains, it sort of seems to be gross. It's like the cranes, yeah."
00:07:29,00:07:34,My favorite fact that I've read about the whole thing of like just what you're allowed to wear
00:07:34,00:07:39,and wore and so on is that hygiene and clothing was quite a big thing. I always wanted the soldiers
00:07:39,00:07:44,"to have clean clothes. So apparently, any time you saw a battlefield, there would always be huge"
00:07:44,00:07:50,clothing lines just behind where they were stationed of people drying their clothes for them and
00:07:50,00:07:54,"getting them clean. Yeah, so anywhere that an army moved behind them was almost a laundry pack."
00:07:54,00:07:59,"What's that? Yeah, that came along. Yeah. Where were you in the war? Were you on the front line?"
00:07:59,00:08:05,"No, I was really on the washing line. Speaking of effeminate, did you see those pictures of North"
00:08:05,00:08:11,"Korean soldiers, female soldiers who were stilettos when they're on parade? Yeah, I was trying to look"
00:08:11,00:08:15,"taller, like cats, and they can also have a look big. Maybe. Well, that's why we have the"
00:08:15,00:08:20,"best guns, isn't it? We don't even talk. It's a fool, it's a fool, incredibly stupid enemies of"
00:08:20,00:08:24,"the crowd. I think that they get a bear as a couple. God, British have really long heads."
00:08:24,00:08:31,They've got massive skulls. So I find the bear skin is quite weird that they still exist. Do you
00:08:31,00:08:37,know how many bears it takes to make one of those hats? Or how many hats per bear? You can probably get
00:08:37,00:08:42,10 hats from a bear. You think 10 hats from a bear? It's one hat. It's quite big. I will bear. Does that
00:08:42,00:08:47,"hat include the head of the bear? Or is it just the skin? Yeah, that's what they've got underneath"
00:08:47,00:08:53,"the hat. Is this roaring head? That's the last line of defense. Yeah, is the bear. Take off the hat."
00:08:53,00:09:01,"You unleash the bear at the right moment. So one bear, one hat per bear. Yep, and so every year we"
00:09:01,00:09:05,"need a hundred new ones, and so a hundred bears were killing a year in order to... That's terrible."
00:09:05,00:09:11,You just needed the guy. Just cut a tiny square out of this bear skin. Throw the rest away.
00:09:11,00:09:16,"Be sure we can make 9 or 10 more hats out of this single bear skin. No, no, no, no, we want only the"
00:09:16,00:09:21,finest of back hair from the bear. Do you know what one bear one hat? It's small of the back. That's it.
00:09:21,00:09:25,"Do you remember because I went, I went bear trekking in Greece a few months ago. Yeah. Did you see any bears?"
00:09:25,00:09:31,Of course not. They're all in Buckingham Palace. That's what you want to go. Just go and watch the
00:09:31,00:09:34,"changing the gods. Just go on bear trekking there, yeah. We saw lots of tracks where we didn't see any of the"
00:09:34,00:09:39,wild. I wanted a really cool makeup fact. Did you know that Dave Myers from the Hairy Bikers started
00:09:39,00:09:43,"his career as a makeup artist? Did he? Yeah, especially as in prosthetics. He watched the BBC. That's"
00:09:43,00:09:48,"where we met Sly King, the other Hairy Biker. He was a locations manager and first AD on films,"
00:09:48,00:09:52,"including Harry Potter, and they met on the induction of a Catherine Cooks and Drama. Can you guess what"
00:09:52,00:10:02,Samuel Peep's bought his wife to improve her looks? Was it his cheese? No. Was your guess? It's not
00:10:02,00:10:07,"nice. I tell you that much. Oh, a snake. No. It was puppy urine. Why did you get her a puppy?"
00:10:07,00:10:12,"You got plenty of urine, that's true. That's true. Upon up with some little discontent with my wife"
00:10:12,00:10:18,upon her saying that she had got and used some puppy dog water being put upon it by great desire
00:10:18,00:10:23,"of my aunt White who had the mind to get some for her ugly face. Oh, it's a charm, right? It's"
00:10:23,00:10:29,"around the recipe darling, look what I've got here. So ugly, puppy urine will improve your face right now."
00:10:29,00:10:34,I'm not going near you until you've covered yourself in dog weed. It's quite possibly the worst
00:10:34,00:10:41,"on the recipe. So looking into military dress, drab is a colour. So drab comes from in the 19th"
00:10:41,00:10:44,"century when the British I mean on the stop in colourful and we started worrying camouflage,"
00:10:44,00:10:47,we started worrying about dull brown colour. It was drab and everyone dressed up in drab.
00:10:47,00:10:51,"That is fantastic. I can legitimately say to my girlfriend, you're looking very drab to the"
00:10:51,00:10:55,"idea and she can't be offended by that. Would you say to her, you're looking very red tonight or very"
00:10:55,00:10:59,"blue tonight? I can see your outfit. Sorry, that's what I mean. Okay, darling."
00:10:59,00:11:07,"Okay, time to move on to fact number three and that is Anne. My fact is that the most borrowed"
00:11:07,00:11:13,children's author from British libraries doesn't exist. How does she not exist? It's not a real person.
00:11:14,00:11:21,Okay. What? What's her name? Daisy Meadows. But she's syndicate. Sort of. She's a front for this group.
00:11:21,00:11:25,So it's a series of books called Rainbow Magic. They're crazy popular. They're over 150 of them.
00:11:25,00:11:30,They saw there were 20 million copies and it's a company called Working Partners who created
00:11:30,00:11:34,the book. They make it by committee. Nobody owns any of the ideas any of the characters. They have
00:11:34,00:11:38,"a bunch of writers who write the books. They're basically loads of them, basically a mini series. You get"
00:11:38,00:11:43,the pets series of the school fairies. There was one I read about called the pop star fairies
00:11:43,00:11:47,"and they all have names. The kids are recognized as Jesse, president Jesse Jay, Adele, the singing"
00:11:47,00:11:53,"fairy, Miley the Silas fairy. But there is seven in the series and four of them are, do you guys"
00:11:53,00:11:57,"know this balance? So if you think of a band that have a Vanessa, a Frankie, a Rochelle and a Una."
00:11:57,00:12:01,"There's Saturdays. Right, there are five people in the Saturdays. Molly's the other one. Molly's"
00:12:01,00:12:06,the other one. So she's not in the pop star fairies. Let's just take a moment and shall we? Yep.
00:12:06,00:12:10,And see what just happened there. I just know there's a Molly in the Saturdays. There's a Molly
00:12:10,00:12:15,"in that phrase. Don't you Molly from the Saturdays. Yes. But it's very pop culture. Do they,"
00:12:15,00:12:20,are they directly doing that? Yeah. So the characters look very similar. I don't know what they look
00:12:20,00:12:24,like because I haven't actually read the full series myself. But I did notice they. Do you research
00:12:24,00:12:30,them? I'm really sorry. They didn't read all 200 books. But so they have things like they brought
00:12:30,00:12:35,"Elizabeth the Jubilee fairy. Okay. They have paints the royal wedding fairy. More cynically,"
00:12:35,00:12:41,they brought out Alexandra the royal baby fairy in May 2013. Prince George was born in July 2013.
00:12:41,00:12:45,And I'm pretty sure Alexander was the running favorite if it had been a girl. So it's like an
00:12:45,00:12:51,"alternative timeline now. Maybe fairies have different pregnancy gestation periods. Yeah,"
00:12:51,00:12:55,maybe they only go for six months. I think it's ever been documented. So these have become
00:12:55,00:13:00,quite popular collaborative writing. It's it's a thing now. There's another one called Erin Hunter.
00:13:00,00:13:05,And the reason she's called Erin Hunter is because so that so the series is pitched at the same
00:13:05,00:13:08,kind of people who like the Brian Jack Redwell series. And the reason she's called that is because
00:13:08,00:13:13,Hunter would be close to Jack in libraries so that people who were browsing Redwell. But this happens
00:13:13,00:13:18,again. I think Lee Child who does very well and with his books he pictures it's a pen name and he
00:13:18,00:13:23,picked it because child is between Christy and Chandler. So he thought people would be browsing
00:13:23,00:13:27,"that section and they would be like, Hey, who's this new guy? Okay, right. There's a new app called"
00:13:27,00:13:32,"InkVite. Have you guys heard of this? No. Yeah, my friends don't do apps but it's where you can do"
00:13:32,00:13:37,"collaborative fiction yourself. So it's kind of like a more pretentious game of consequences, I think,"
00:13:37,00:13:42,where you can invite up to four people and you're allowed to write I think 280 words of your novel
00:13:42,00:13:46,and then you pass it on to the next person and they write them in the past. I think you're even more
00:13:46,00:13:51,"fun rather than more pretentious. Yeah, no, it does aren't actually quite fun. I said collaborative books"
00:13:51,00:13:55,that I really like. I've been obsessed with them since I've arrived in this country. I haven't read
00:13:55,00:13:59,"them yet. Was it too very high? No, but sweet valley high. It also obviously fits into this category."
00:13:59,00:14:04,"So no, this is not one single author but Mills and Boone. You love Mills and Vic? I love the concept"
00:14:04,00:14:09,"of them. I just love the turn around. No, I really, I'd love to write one one day. I'd love to write a"
00:14:09,00:14:13,science fiction one and I know that they don't have or I thought they didn't have their own science
00:14:13,00:14:18,fiction arm. They do. They do. There's a science fiction paranormal arm. There's amazing titles.
00:14:18,00:14:23,"They do this thing, by the way, where they, if someone in a paranormal one visits a dinosaur and"
00:14:23,00:14:28,"has an erotic moment with a dinosaur, they don't consider it bestiality because all the animals"
00:14:28,00:14:34,"and crypto animals in it are intelligent. They're just like us. They're consenting. Yeah, so taken"
00:14:34,00:14:39,"by T-Rex. Hang on, it's still like, oh. Hang on, I remember seeing these book covers. They did"
00:14:39,00:14:43,"around the world got like dinosaur erotica. Was that Mills and Boone? That was, that was Danny"
00:14:43,00:14:51,mailing them. That's my novel. I've got a birthday coming up. Hint hint. I've got taken by T-Rex.
00:14:51,00:14:58,"The rest are two rude Frankenstein's bitch. That's not rude, that's lazy. That's lazy, lazy writing."
00:14:58,00:15:06,Milked by aliens. That's not even a sexy thing. That's just farming. This one's the oddest.
00:15:06,00:15:13,"Come for big foot. But here's the thing. So Mills and Boone, why I'm fascinated by it is that"
00:15:13,00:15:19,no same book stays on the shelf for longer than three months. They pulp it straight after. Wow.
00:15:19,00:15:26,So they have a huge turnaround and in 2008 they were saying every 6.6 seconds someone bought
00:15:26,00:15:32,a Mills and Boone book. The same guy. It was dad. He was standing at the till with a bigger and bigger
00:15:32,00:15:37,"pile next to him. No, I've got to have another one. I've picked this one already. You can read them"
00:15:37,00:15:43,very quickly to be fair. They are quite for three quarters of all romance novels that are bought
00:15:43,00:15:48,into this country. I like how we're calling these romance taken by a T-Rex. I've headed back to
00:15:48,00:15:55,the romance anyway. Did you hear that brilliant thing about what they do with pulp mousen bins?
00:15:55,00:16:01,"Yeah, that's a key why question. The M6 of the M8 tool road is made up for pulp mousen bins."
00:16:01,00:16:06,"So when you drive down, you're driving over all those. Fantastic. They use the foundations in the"
00:16:06,00:16:10,"foundations to stabilise it. That's why it's always a bit of a turn on when you're driving,"
00:16:10,00:16:13,"driving down the M6. Probably only for down. Yeah, turn them and turn on."
00:16:16,00:16:22,So I was looking at libraries and the Tarzan books were banned from some libraries in America in
00:16:22,00:16:27,the 1950s because Tarzan and Jane were living in sin. Wow. Yeah. What's the great fact you told me
00:16:27,00:16:32,"about Tarzan, Hannah? It's that, oh yeah, the guy who wrote Tarzan is the great grandfather of"
00:16:32,00:16:38,"Wes Anderson. Oh yeah, true. A good rice furrow. Yes. So I was just looking at other, or I stumbled"
00:16:38,00:16:42,upon other stuff that's been banned for amusing reasons. And do you guys remember a couple of years
00:16:42,00:16:49,ago when dictionaries were removed from classrooms in California? No. No. A parent complained that
00:16:49,00:16:55,a child stumbled across in the Mary Webster dictionary the phrase oral sex. So the district spokes
00:16:55,00:16:59,women Betty Cadmus told a newspaper that the books were immediately pulled off the shelves and
00:16:59,00:17:03,temporarily housed off location to make sure that children didn't get their hands on it. And I really
00:17:03,00:17:09,"like it. It wasn't me that spotted this stunning irony. It was a blogger who's Dennis Barron,"
00:17:09,00:17:13,"who's a professor of linguistics, pointed out that her name was Betty Cadmus, who was issuing the"
00:17:13,00:17:19,statements. Cadmus was the Phoenician who brought writing to the ancient Greeks. Wow. And she's
00:17:19,00:17:25,"good away. In it away. Right. It's nice, isn't it? So good. In the 1960s, in public libraries,"
00:17:25,00:17:30,"you used to have things which were called block books, which were wooden blocks on the shelves."
00:17:30,00:17:36,"And that was in place of any books that librarians thought were riskate or obscene or, you know,"
00:17:36,00:17:40,"like top shelf. Well, what you had to do basically, you had to take the block to the counter,"
00:17:40,00:17:44,"and then they would get the book out from under the desk and give it to you. Was it to shame people,"
00:17:44,00:17:48,because you feel really dodgy when someone had to go beneath the counter to get something to do?
00:17:48,00:17:52,"Driving at the front desk was just an armful of wooden blocks. I'd like all these, please."
00:17:52,00:17:58,"Granny behind you giving you a really disapproving state. It's Tarzan, come on. Do you guys know what the"
00:17:58,00:18:03,most banned book in 2013 was? I think this was in America. What's the time trying to ban the killer
00:18:03,00:18:10,walking bird again? I don't know. That was banned though. Was it atheism for sexy people?
00:18:10,00:18:14,"Was it Billy Goat? This is just another excuse to slip in a fact, but Billy Goat's"
00:18:14,00:18:18,gruff was banned in Oregon because it was deemed too violent for children to be in a children's
00:18:18,00:18:25,"library. Oh, but I'd take it. It wasn't that. It was Captain Underpants by Dan Pilke."
00:18:25,00:18:30,That's an outrage. It's one of the great works of literature of the 20th century. Fantastic
00:18:30,00:18:36,kids books. I've never heard of them. They're very popular. There were about a headmaster who gets
00:18:36,00:18:43,"hypnotized into thinking that he's Captain Underpants and any time a certain key word goes off,"
00:18:43,00:18:48,he suddenly becomes Captain Underpants and runs around with a cape and his underpants and does
00:18:48,00:18:52,adventures and it's all in his head. I really thought you were going to say any time a certain
00:18:52,00:18:57,"key word goes on, he whips his underpants off. He's saying he's a head teacher. I just sort of see"
00:18:57,00:19:01,"why he's books with bands. If he's Captain Underpants, does he wear his trousers over his underpants,"
00:19:01,00:19:06,"like the opposite of Superman, who famously wears his underpants over his trousers? But Superman's"
00:19:06,00:19:12,"not called Captain trousers. That's where my clever analogy breaks down, unfortunately."
00:19:12,00:19:18,"Also, another band book. I was very surprised by this. Where's Wally? Got banned for quite a long time."
00:19:18,00:19:23,"Why is it so frustrating? Because it's too hard. It's called Where's Waldo, but someone noticed,"
00:19:23,00:19:28,"so in the Americas, where's Waldo, someone noticed that in one of the drawings that on a beach,"
00:19:28,00:19:32,"there was a topless lady laying on the beach. A drool and a topless woman. Yeah, and you could,"
00:19:32,00:19:37,"I mean, she was laying on her stomach, lifting up, so it was kind of more side boob. Well, it's obscene,"
00:19:37,00:19:41,"and I've discussed it. Well, I reckon the person that found her was probably a genius at finding"
00:19:41,00:19:45,"Wally. You can find boob on the page. Yeah, well, I'm sure he's fantastic at finding oral sex and"
00:19:45,00:19:51,"addiction, or as well. Some people are just desperate to be offended. I really like this. In the"
00:19:51,00:19:56,"second world war, some authorities, some local authorities established, they put collections of"
00:19:56,00:20:02,"books in air raid shelters, so there was a tube station at Bethel Green, and it had 4,000 books in it,"
00:20:02,00:20:07,"and 6,000 people would turn up every night in the shelters, and they'd have a library available to them."
00:20:07,00:20:11,"And they were really, really sort of intellectual books, as well, like Bertram Russell, and Chopin Howe,"
00:20:11,00:20:17,"and all kinds of... Oh, I see that the people with low brown taste don't deserve to be entertained"
00:20:17,00:20:22,"in air raids. No, I'm just saying it's, you know, a very impressive thinking of people sheltering"
00:20:22,00:20:26,"from air raids, and also reading some of the great works. But, you know, I'd be so pissed off,"
00:20:26,00:20:30,"you're terrified, you just need something easy to distract you, and all you've got is great works"
00:20:30,00:20:35,of philosophy. Exactly. I would have preferred books with the titles like How to Survive an Air
00:20:35,00:20:42,"Raid, and How to Survive Being Trapped in a Small Tunnel with a group of other very, very scared"
00:20:42,00:20:47,"humans. Some very escapist, though, as it's more sort of in the brutal realism tradition."
00:20:47,00:20:53,"Okay, well, when we're fighting over the last rat in the tunnel and you're quoting deep philosophy"
00:20:53,00:21:00,"to me. And Dan's munching away on his rodent, who's having the better time? Because I read 101"
00:21:00,00:21:06,ways to cook a rodent. The first of a mobile library was Horse Drawn. That's really nice.
00:21:06,00:21:11,"It's so cool. And they still have in bits of, I think North Africa, they have a camel mobile library."
00:21:11,00:21:15,"They travel around from town to town, and they have school books, and they do have all kinds of"
00:21:15,00:21:20,"educational things. I just think that's incredible. Wow. And then when they stay for a few days,"
00:21:20,00:21:23,and then they go off across the desert again. Seeking out the next air raid shelter. That would have
00:21:23,00:21:26,"been cool. If you've gone to an air raid shelter, and they were just loads of camels, they're waiting for you."
00:21:26,00:21:32,"Dan would be trying to eat them. Yeah, they can. There are some places where it might be in the UK where"
00:21:32,00:21:36,"you can get books in the National Health Service if you're depressed. Oh, I thought you meant books"
00:21:36,00:21:39,"about the national health. So you actually mean you can get them prescribed. Yeah, but you can get"
00:21:39,00:21:43,"books by books. Well, I can't like birch and rustle. I'm not sure what kind of life I'm not going to lie."
00:21:43,00:21:54,"Wound quarter rising for dummies. Okay, time for the final fact of this show. And that's my fact."
00:21:54,00:22:00,My fact this week is that it would cost $850 quadrillion to build the Death Star.
00:22:00,00:22:08,"And you're probably wondering how I. Yes, I know this. I discovered this fact. There's a website"
00:22:08,00:22:12,"that you can go on online called We the People, which is set up by the White House, specifically for"
00:22:12,00:22:18,people who want to ask a question to Barack Obama. And the idea is that you put it up as a petition and
00:22:18,00:22:23,"if enough people sign it, the White House has to officially reply. And one of the questions was a"
00:22:23,00:22:29,response to secure resources and funding and begin construction of a Death Star by 2016.
00:22:29,00:22:35,"And the response, who is a fantastic response, they said, we can't do this. We agree that we share"
00:22:35,00:22:40,"your desire for job creation, a strong national defense, but it's just not on the horizon. One being"
00:22:40,00:22:46,that it would cost $850 quadrillion to the administration does not support blowing up planets.
00:22:46,00:22:51,"Which is really what the White House administration character, how much have we cost them to build?"
00:22:51,00:22:54,"Actually, no, it was someone else said they said it. They provided a link."
00:22:54,00:22:59,"You just find out. I was under 100. We can. Yeah, it's kind of a point. Is this feasible?"
00:22:59,00:23:06,"Yeah, it's not. And also, it would take years and years to gather all the material that you would need."
00:23:06,00:23:11,"I think it said it would take 8333,315 years to make."
00:23:11,00:23:14,"Well, I'll be dead by then, by getting off steel."
00:23:14,00:23:16,To get enough steel to actually make it.
00:23:16,00:23:20,"On petitions, you know this recent innovation in the British government, which is that the government"
00:23:20,00:23:26,"has an e-petitions website and anything that gets 100,000 signatures is passed to a business committee"
00:23:26,00:23:31,in the House of Commons for possible debate. This has generated quite a lot of amazing petitions
00:23:31,00:23:38,"like ban, bowl, football players from Liverpool Football Club. Royal Baby to be given Lion King"
00:23:38,00:23:47,"welcome. Isn't that good? Yeah. What is that held up on the end of a cliff? Yeah, by Rafiki."
00:23:47,00:23:54,"Do you know what's really cool is this Weaver People site? It's actually in terms of research,"
00:23:54,00:23:58,really fantastic place to find stuff out. So one of the petitions was asking the White House if they
00:23:58,00:24:02,"could release the recipe for the honey ale home brewed at the White House. I'll just quickly,"
00:24:02,00:24:07,"just very quickly tell you about it, which is so President Obama bought a home brewing kit for"
00:24:07,00:24:12,his kitchen in the White House. And then they had the chefs and they had all the people who worked
00:24:12,00:24:17,"there, who do brew their own beer, come and sort of create this ultimate kind of recipe that"
00:24:17,00:24:23,they could then use. And now they stick to this one recipe and it's the White House's official
00:24:23,00:24:28,honey ale brewing beer that they all drink there. It's the first as well. I've learned from this
00:24:28,00:24:33,article. It's the first evidence that there's been beer brewed in the White House. So they have in
00:24:33,00:24:38,"the past have known that George Washington used to do whiskey, but that wasn't in the White House."
00:24:38,00:24:44,"That Jefferson used to make wine, but again that was, maybe that wasn't the White House, but this"
00:24:44,00:24:48,definitely the first beer in the White House. So President Obama has given the White House a beer.
00:24:49,00:24:55,"I at least he brought them something here. I don't mean that I quite like him. And lastly,"
00:24:55,00:25:01,"what's really nice is the ingredients for the beer is all unique, but honey particularly because"
00:25:01,00:25:06,"they use honey that they tap from the first ever beehive that the White House has had, which is on"
00:25:06,00:25:13,"the South Lawn. Oh honey, their own beer. So it's their own beehive to create the honey for their own"
00:25:13,00:25:18,"home brewed honey ale. A bunch of kind of rural hippies really aren't they? Yeah and if it takes off,"
00:25:18,00:25:22,they might leave this whole government nonsense. They might just go into beer brewing. That is what
00:25:22,00:25:26,"the Republicans want them to do. Yeah, we want smaller government and we want more home brewed honey ale."
00:25:26,00:25:33,"Obama, don't get as wrong, we like your beer. Do you end up in my favourite Star Wars fact?"
00:25:33,00:25:38,"Go on. Oh yeah. It's that in sync, the band, just in Timberlake's band, made a cameo in Star Wars"
00:25:38,00:25:42,"episode two Attack of the Clones, but they were cut out at the final version. Yeah, thank God."
00:25:42,00:25:46,"Another thing I love about Star Wars is Dave Pros, who was Star Fader's body. Dave Pros,"
00:25:46,00:25:50,also the Green Cross cult man. He gave him an interview a few days ago where he said that that was his
00:25:50,00:25:55,"best role of his life, was not being Vader, being the goodie and saving lives. He just ruined Darth Vader"
00:25:55,00:25:58,for a lot of captivated and terrified children now. I'm worried for him to say. Now I think he's a
00:25:58,00:26:04,little goodie too. She's car safety. Darth Vader never crossed the road between two cars. You'll
00:26:04,00:26:08,notice that in all the films. No matter what he might do. He did cross road safe. Never does it once.
00:26:08,00:26:14,"David Prouse has the best title of an autobiography. For me, I think it's called Straight from the"
00:26:14,00:26:20,"Forces mouth. That is very good. Kind of. He doesn't talk in Star Wars. Well, he's not known for his"
00:26:20,00:26:23,thought. He's going to have the voice of Darth Vader. He did think he was going to have it. He was convinced
00:26:23,00:26:28,that he was going to have it and then they revealed that actually we don't really want a West Country
00:26:28,00:26:32,"accent for this mask. Just scary, but there is a video kicking back of him doing the voice. I've"
00:26:32,00:26:37,"seen it. It's brilliant. I actually came up with what I thought was a better title for his book,"
00:26:37,00:26:42,which is the Empire Strikes Hardback. That is very good. They have changed it for people back.
00:26:43,00:26:48,Star Trek invented the touchscreen. Did it? Did it. Star Trek had Captain Kirk
00:26:48,00:26:55,"used to ride with his little touchscreen pen thing on a touchscreen. I mean, it's not like on set."
00:26:55,00:27:00,"They had this new touchscreen. They invented. Guys, should we patent this now or should we continue"
00:27:00,00:27:05,"with the series? That is true. It is substantially harder to invent an iPad than it is to say,"
00:27:05,00:27:09,I've got a magic device that lets me do it. It's all to anyone. Like J.K. Rowling invented the
00:27:09,00:27:16,"invisibility cloak. I think we should invent something right now. Invisibility cloak does exist now,"
00:27:16,00:27:20,"doesn't it? It does. It's like reflective stuff as well. Yeah, you can see it, see on the issue."
00:27:20,00:27:24,"I thought you couldn't. It doesn't. You can put it over your handle, your head they've tried it,"
00:27:24,00:27:28,and it doesn't tamper with anything around it. You can't. You can see the background behind it.
00:27:28,00:27:31,"Anyway, that's been invented. A hoverboard's been invented, which is apparently a thing for"
00:27:31,00:27:35,"going back to the future, which is another thing. I saw a footage of it the other day. It looks amazing."
00:27:35,00:27:39,"It does look fun. It does look really cool. I mean, it looks very beta. It looks very"
00:27:40,00:27:44,"early stages, but it is working. That's fantastic. There's a great blog about Star Trek inventions."
00:27:44,00:27:48,"Years ago it came out, so I'm sure most people, if they know Star Trek, know this, but someone did"
00:27:48,00:27:56,"a list of all the things that Star Trek didn't invent. Including cup holders on the ship,"
00:27:56,00:28:02,"always out of the cup in the head. Seat belts. They think a seat belt, they're always flying around"
00:28:02,00:28:08,"the Star Trek when they're attacked. On Star Trek, inventing touch screens. The first touch screen"
00:28:08,00:28:13,"in real life was invented in 1888, and it was invented by this person called Alicia Gray,"
00:28:13,00:28:18,"and it was like a kind of fax machine, so it used this electric pen to transmit an electric signal"
00:28:18,00:28:22,"across wires, and it meant you could draw a picture, and then someone at the other end, in 1888,"
00:28:22,00:28:26,"could see the picture that you drawn, and this was used for things that needed signatures."
00:28:26,00:28:30,"So it was used quite commonly in hospitals and banks and stuff. You'd be like, oh, you need me to"
00:28:30,00:28:33,"sign that. I'm sorry, I'm not here, but I'll just sign that over the phone. That's amazing."
00:28:33,00:28:39,"That is amazing. We still can't do that. Well, we don't anymore. Do we lose it? So we've lost"
00:28:39,00:28:43,"technology. I mean, I don't know, I've never been able to sign over the telephone. Me neither."
00:28:43,00:28:48,"But you can't key in your pencil. We can't do that in 1800. It's faxing, isn't it? No, no, no,"
00:28:48,00:28:54,it's like life faxing. It's like draw something. I don't believe that. Me either. That's so excited
00:28:54,00:28:59,"there. It's a real thing. I suppose it sends an electric signal of a device moving over paper,"
00:28:59,00:29:04,"doesn't it? Yeah, but we just, we don't have that. Are we? Using a, like, sure, I've got it somewhere,"
00:29:04,00:29:11,Google Docs. Check your draw. Alex has probably gone in the station recovered. He's been telling us
00:29:11,00:29:16,to use it for years. Can I tell you my favorite Star Trek fact? This will be my last Star Trek fact.
00:29:16,00:29:22,"It's that Spock was originally going to be Martian. He was going to be from Mars. Wow. Yeah,"
00:29:22,00:29:27,but he didn't end up being Martian because the other writers kind of laughed the idea out of the
00:29:27,00:29:32,"room because they said by the time the series was nearing the end of its first series or a few series,"
00:29:32,00:29:38,we would be on Mars. No. No one would be. It would just not be believable. That's so funny. Yeah. That's
00:29:38,00:29:41,great. So they made him from. I like it a bit. They thought wouldn't be believable with the
00:29:41,00:29:47,holostar Trek. Yeah. Something about space that I learned recently. I'm reading Commander Chris
00:29:47,00:29:52,"Hadfield's book at the moment. I former captain of the International Space Station. He, when he was"
00:29:52,00:29:57,"out on his first ever spacewalk and he was trying to fix something on the International Space Station,"
00:29:57,00:30:02,"had a huge pain in his eye, which forced tears out of his eye, and he was saying that it ended up"
00:30:02,00:30:08,sending him blind because tears don't function like normal tears in space. They don't fall. They
00:30:08,00:30:14,instead build up as a huge blob over your eye. So he was suddenly blind completely in one of his eyes
00:30:14,00:30:18,because this huge body of water was sitting in front of it. And it got so big that it eventually
00:30:18,00:30:24,passed over the bridge of his nose to his other eye. So suddenly he's out in space and he's trying
00:30:24,00:30:30,to fix the International Space Station. And he completely blind. Literally blinded by his tears.
00:30:30,00:30:34,"But he has made a double bubble, right? Which is something you're always trying to do when you're"
00:30:34,00:30:41,"playing bubbles. This is very inconvenient. Bad news, NASA, and some good news. The news were"
00:30:41,00:30:47,eight-year-old me. But apparently what would happen is naturally the tears would get so big that
00:30:47,00:30:52,it couldn't hold it anymore. And it would flood space. It would flood all of space with
00:30:52,00:30:57,"people on this. But you'd still have to be seeing through a kind of, as if you were looking through"
00:30:57,00:31:03,"goggles, I guess. So I was looking at other things that people have valued fictional things. They valued"
00:31:03,00:31:09,"Mr. Burns's manner, which is worth $127 million. And that has to include things like a bottomless"
00:31:09,00:31:14,pit which he has. So let's see how many references a Simpsons fan listening can get. Bottomless
00:31:14,00:31:18,pit are room containing a thousand monkeys banging on a thousand typewriters and a robotic Richard Simmons.
00:31:20,00:31:25,"Wayne Manon would be 105 million. But also, is that good? Yeah, it knows. It's affordable."
00:31:25,00:31:31,With our affections. But they made a real Simpsons house in 1997. They ran a competition
00:31:31,00:31:38,"for someone to win the Simpsons house. And the winner had a choice of either taking him $75,000"
