1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,720
 We run it on QI a few years ago. Yeah. Which was there's no such thing as a fish.

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:09,920
 No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life.

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,640
 He says it right there, first paragraph. No such thing as a fish.

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:24,160
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

5
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,320
 from the QI offices in Covenant Garden. My name is Dan Schreiber. I'm sitting here with

6
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,280
 Anna Chazinski and Miller and Andy Murray and once again we have gathered around the microphones

7
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,320
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in a particular order here we go.

8
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:47,280
 Starting with you, Andy. My fact is that in 18th century France, tooth pullers were entertainers

9
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:53,680
 who performed in front of cheering crowds. So one of them had the party trick of pulling teeth out

10
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,240
 of a patient with one hand while firing a pistol with the other and all the while he had his head

11
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:03,680
 in a sack. Why was he shooting? I don't get the gun shooting bit. It's just as a touch of

12
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:10,080
 flamboyant. Exactly. Yeah. It was entertainment. Yeah. It's got a really painful tooth. Great.

13
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:16,880
 Well, I've got to show on at 8 p.m. You can make it. There was one guy who did that in the late 1800s

14
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,000
 who was called Edgar Parker. He might be the person you're talking about. Okay.

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,640
 He's a Edgar Parker and he changed his name by Deadpool to painless Parker. That's really cool.

16
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:31,680
 Okay. Yeah. James IV of Scotland was a keen amateur dentist. A keen amateur sounds a bit like he

17
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,880
 wasn't good at being even an amateur. Yeah. It's quite really hard. Yeah. Don't give up, son.

18
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:43,840
 Don't give up. You will wonder. You could make amateur. Glorious day. Well Peter the Great

19
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:49,120
 did that as well. He practiced it on his noble dentistry. So if you had a tooth ache and Peter the

20
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:52,800
 Great was around, you had to keep it to yourself. Otherwise you'd say, come on, get in the chair.

21
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:57,040
 No one is easier. Yeah. Oh, what was that? You got a sore tooth? No, no, it's headache.

22
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,880
 It's headache. It's headache. It's headache. I have something for that. I'll just get my hammer.

23
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:06,480
 Just get my brain sore and he kept all the extracted teeth in a little bag. He was very proud of it.

24
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:11,120
 And it's now in the the Kunstkamera at the museum in St Peter's book. There's a bunch of fairies

25
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,880
 planning a heist at the same level though. Yes. Mark Zuckerberg's dad is a dentist and his website

26
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:21,840
 advertises or used to advertise. We cater for cowards and he's he's specifically targets people

27
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,880
 who have dentist. That's a really good idea, because they're quite anti-anxious and we don't need it

28
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,560
 but some people get so freaked out by the dentist. His website should say, we pulled teeth out of

29
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:38,400
 your Facebook. So I read that the Egyptians used to use toothpaste way before toothbrushes were

30
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,120
 invented. Yeah. But it doesn't sound very nice. It was things like ox hooves, ashes, burnt eggshells

31
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:50,560
 and pumice. Oh yeah, lovely. Sounds penis. That's what you're saying. A punist. Worst chasturbine ever.

32
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:58,160
 Oh excuse for infidelity. I lost my toothbrush darling. The bummer happened to be here.

33
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:05,680
 So the Egyptians used to use the gross toothpaste 5,000 years before the toothbrushes were invented.

34
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,080
 The toothbrush was maybe the bristles from a pig's neck. Bristles from a pig's neck?

35
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,800
 Damn, like better than the penis is the age of the dentist. That's true, it's definitely an improvement.

36
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:21,680
 In 2013, a man escaped from prison in Sweden to go to the dentist. He went to the dentist,

37
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,960
 he had the affected tooth pulled out and then he reported himself to the police and they took him

38
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:29,520
 back to prison. He got a day added to his sentence as punishment. That's fantastic. Yeah.

39
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:36,480
 Did he book? You've got one phone call. You should have known really where he was going.

40
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:42,400
 Yeah, on the 27th. Next one. Yeah, that's fine. 3 p.m. Okay, cool. I might be a bit sweaty

41
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:50,400
 in the shovel one hour. I just want you to know that. What I'm here, do you have large sums of cash

42
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:57,840
 on the premises? Just because your fact was about, obviously, funny sort of entertainment in

43
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:05,840
 centuries past and freak shows. There was a guy, Joseph Pujon or Pujon, who in the 19th century

44
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:13,440
 made his living by farting and his living was, yeah, yeah, what standard was he? Was he what? Yes,

45
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,520
 he was a putter main. There's a whole film about him. He was incredible. Yes, there is. The matter

46
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:23,760
 of a good fact. Yeah, he could suck air in through his bottom and then do tunes? He retired from

47
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:29,040
 his farting career to become a baker after the first. Oh no, I wouldn't need his pie. I do want

48
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:35,840
 to have success when he was in that. So he went from breaking winter, breaking bread. Oh, just a joke

49
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:42,320
 for you. He claimed that the farts also did not smell. He memorably said, my parents ruined themselves

50
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:49,040
 sending my rectum. Who is this man? Who's that mean? He was a French cabaret entertainer.

51
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:54,400
 Well, cabaret's really improved. His parents have spent an enormous amount of money making sure

52
00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:01,280
 that his farts did not smell bad. Like a cent like a centred candle. Can you use yourself as an air

53
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:07,040
 freshener, do you think? High and self-help to people who are bad. Every 15 minutes who just releases

54
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:16,560
 another waft of lavender into the room. Okay, time for fact number two. And that is Anna.

55
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:22,240
 My fact this week is that in the First World War, the Romanian army issued an order that only

56
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:30,720
 officers above the rank of major had the right to wear eyeshadow in battle. There are so many

57
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:36,320
 elements in that. The rank of major, then wearing eyeshadow and then in battle, simply outside battle,

58
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:41,200
 all bets were off. Yeah, outside battle, you can do what you want. You're worth socks on your nose.

59
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,480
 That's the army, isn't it? Outside battle. We don't care what you do. Have a good time.

60
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:49,680
 No, but I still are right. I think Neil Vonage is okay. But again, in the US Army New Regulations,

61
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:55,440
 there's recently been a ban on men wearing nail polish. Who's doing that? In China and Japan, a few

62
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,080
 thousand years ago, everyone painted the nails. I just think you did. Maybe there's a, that's a

63
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,720
 niche little kind of tribute group to ancient China that exists in the US Army that I mean to crack

64
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:10,320
 down on. The Romans is to painting the nails with blood. It'd go weird brown almost immediately,

65
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:14,480
 wouldn't it? Yeah. We'd like you to reapply our fresh supply. Yeah. That was the only reason

66
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:19,680
 they were saying murderers actually. Because they can tell who was murdering because everyone

67
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,680
 blood on their hands. In those days, you've got blood on your hands, wasn't a bad thing. It was just

68
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,880
 a statement of fact about everyone looking at you blood on your hands. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah,

69
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,200
 superdrug, two, three, four. Smudge a little bit. Actually, it's also on your knife.

70
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:40,160
 But that's where we get cosmetics from, is Roman Times. They had Cosmety, who were slaves,

71
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,160
 whose job was to apply makeup and perfume to their mistress and help out with the toilet.

72
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,000
 So that's where we get the web from. Cosmety. Look, cool. Do you know where we've got the word

73
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,680
 makeup from? We've seen all the adverts from Max Factor, the makeup of makeup artists.

74
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,840
 Yeah. Isn't that a guy called Max Factor? Yes. So his name was Max Emilian in fact Doritz,

75
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,920
 he's from Poland, and he coined makeup as a noun from to make up your face as a verb,

76
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:04,080
 and he was the first one turning into a noun. He was the first person. Max Factor. And that is why

77
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,760
 it's extremely hard to research makeup if you're looking for what people were wearing in the

78
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:13,520
 olden times as a brand new bloody word, and there's no real, all the equivalent for it. Except for

79
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,920
 on your hands. Turns out some of history's biggest murderers were actually just height of fashion.

80
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:23,680
 Ancient Romans, who were bold, would disguise it by painting their heads.

81
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:29,680
 Weirdly, when it rains, it sort of seems to be gross. It's like the cranes, yeah.

82
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,560
 My favorite fact that I've read about the whole thing of like just what you're allowed to wear

83
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,360
 and wore and so on is that hygiene and clothing was quite a big thing. I always wanted the soldiers

84
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,800
 to have clean clothes. So apparently, any time you saw a battlefield, there would always be huge

85
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:50,480
 clothing lines just behind where they were stationed of people drying their clothes for them and

86
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:54,880
 getting them clean. Yeah, so anywhere that an army moved behind them was almost a laundry pack.

87
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:59,120
 What's that? Yeah, that came along. Yeah. Where were you in the war? Were you on the front line?

88
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:05,920
 No, I was really on the washing line. Speaking of effeminate, did you see those pictures of North

89
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:11,040
 Korean soldiers, female soldiers who were stilettos when they're on parade? Yeah, I was trying to look

90
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:15,440
 taller, like cats, and they can also have a look big. Maybe. Well, that's why we have the

91
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:20,240
 best guns, isn't it? We don't even talk. It's a fool, it's a fool, incredibly stupid enemies of

92
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,640
 the crowd. I think that they get a bear as a couple. God, British have really long heads.

93
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:31,680
 They've got massive skulls. So I find the bear skin is quite weird that they still exist. Do you

94
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:37,120
 know how many bears it takes to make one of those hats? Or how many hats per bear? You can probably get

95
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:42,880
 10 hats from a bear. You think 10 hats from a bear? It's one hat. It's quite big. I will bear. Does that

96
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,280
 hat include the head of the bear? Or is it just the skin? Yeah, that's what they've got underneath

97
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:53,760
 the hat. Is this roaring head? That's the last line of defense. Yeah, is the bear. Take off the hat.

98
00:08:53,760 --> 00:09:01,440
 You unleash the bear at the right moment. So one bear, one hat per bear. Yep, and so every year we

99
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,520
 need a hundred new ones, and so a hundred bears were killing a year in order to... That's terrible.

100
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:11,520
 You just needed the guy. Just cut a tiny square out of this bear skin. Throw the rest away.

101
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:16,640
 Be sure we can make 9 or 10 more hats out of this single bear skin. No, no, no, no, we want only the

102
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,680
 finest of back hair from the bear. Do you know what one bear one hat? It's small of the back. That's it.

103
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,760
 Do you remember because I went, I went bear trekking in Greece a few months ago. Yeah. Did you see any bears?

104
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:31,280
 Of course not. They're all in Buckingham Palace. That's what you want to go. Just go and watch the

105
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:34,720
 changing the gods. Just go on bear trekking there, yeah. We saw lots of tracks where we didn't see any of the

106
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,600
 wild. I wanted a really cool makeup fact. Did you know that Dave Myers from the Hairy Bikers started

107
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,760
 his career as a makeup artist? Did he? Yeah, especially as in prosthetics. He watched the BBC. That's

108
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:48,320
 where we met Sly King, the other Hairy Biker. He was a locations manager and first AD on films,

109
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,560
 including Harry Potter, and they met on the induction of a Catherine Cooks and Drama. Can you guess what

110
00:09:52,560 --> 00:10:02,000
 Samuel Peep's bought his wife to improve her looks? Was it his cheese? No. Was your guess? It's not

111
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,760
 nice. I tell you that much. Oh, a snake. No. It was puppy urine. Why did you get her a puppy?

112
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:12,400
 You got plenty of urine, that's true. That's true. Upon up with some little discontent with my wife

113
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:18,240
 upon her saying that she had got and used some puppy dog water being put upon it by great desire

114
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,360
 of my aunt White who had the mind to get some for her ugly face. Oh, it's a charm, right? It's

115
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:29,520
 around the recipe darling, look what I've got here. So ugly, puppy urine will improve your face right now.

116
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:34,800
 I'm not going near you until you've covered yourself in dog weed. It's quite possibly the worst

117
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:41,360
 on the recipe. So looking into military dress, drab is a colour. So drab comes from in the 19th

118
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,480
 century when the British I mean on the stop in colourful and we started worrying camouflage,

119
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,840
 we started worrying about dull brown colour. It was drab and everyone dressed up in drab.

120
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:51,200
 That is fantastic. I can legitimately say to my girlfriend, you're looking very drab to the

121
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,280
 idea and she can't be offended by that. Would you say to her, you're looking very red tonight or very

122
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:59,760
 blue tonight? I can see your outfit. Sorry, that's what I mean. Okay, darling.

123
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:07,280
 Okay, time to move on to fact number three and that is Anne. My fact is that the most borrowed

124
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:13,360
 children's author from British libraries doesn't exist. How does she not exist? It's not a real person.

125
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:21,040
 Okay. What? What's her name? Daisy Meadows. But she's syndicate. Sort of. She's a front for this group.

126
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,920
 So it's a series of books called Rainbow Magic. They're crazy popular. They're over 150 of them.

127
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,400
 They saw there were 20 million copies and it's a company called Working Partners who created

128
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:34,000
 the book. They make it by committee. Nobody owns any of the ideas any of the characters. They have

129
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,160
 a bunch of writers who write the books. They're basically loads of them, basically a mini series. You get

130
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:43,680
 the pets series of the school fairies. There was one I read about called the pop star fairies

131
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,760
 and they all have names. The kids are recognized as Jesse, president Jesse Jay, Adele, the singing

132
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:53,520
 fairy, Miley the Silas fairy. But there is seven in the series and four of them are, do you guys

133
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:57,520
 know this balance? So if you think of a band that have a Vanessa, a Frankie, a Rochelle and a Una.

134
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:01,920
 There's Saturdays. Right, there are five people in the Saturdays. Molly's the other one. Molly's

135
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,240
 the other one. So she's not in the pop star fairies. Let's just take a moment and shall we? Yep.

136
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,320
 And see what just happened there. I just know there's a Molly in the Saturdays. There's a Molly

137
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:15,120
 in that phrase. Don't you Molly from the Saturdays. Yes. But it's very pop culture. Do they,

138
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:20,400
 are they directly doing that? Yeah. So the characters look very similar. I don't know what they look

139
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:24,960
 like because I haven't actually read the full series myself. But I did notice they. Do you research

140
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:30,960
 them? I'm really sorry. They didn't read all 200 books. But so they have things like they brought

141
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:35,920
 Elizabeth the Jubilee fairy. Okay. They have paints the royal wedding fairy. More cynically,

142
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:41,840
 they brought out Alexandra the royal baby fairy in May 2013. Prince George was born in July 2013.

143
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:45,440
 And I'm pretty sure Alexander was the running favorite if it had been a girl. So it's like an

144
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:51,200
 alternative timeline now. Maybe fairies have different pregnancy gestation periods. Yeah,

145
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,200
 maybe they only go for six months. I think it's ever been documented. So these have become

146
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:00,000
 quite popular collaborative writing. It's it's a thing now. There's another one called Erin Hunter.

147
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,440
 And the reason she's called Erin Hunter is because so that so the series is pitched at the same

148
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,960
 kind of people who like the Brian Jack Redwell series. And the reason she's called that is because

149
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:13,760
 Hunter would be close to Jack in libraries so that people who were browsing Redwell. But this happens

150
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:18,640
 again. I think Lee Child who does very well and with his books he pictures it's a pen name and he

151
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:23,040
 picked it because child is between Christy and Chandler. So he thought people would be browsing

152
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,520
 that section and they would be like, Hey, who's this new guy? Okay, right. There's a new app called

153
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:32,320
 InkVite. Have you guys heard of this? No. Yeah, my friends don't do apps but it's where you can do

154
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:37,760
 collaborative fiction yourself. So it's kind of like a more pretentious game of consequences, I think,

155
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:42,560
 where you can invite up to four people and you're allowed to write I think 280 words of your novel

156
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,080
 and then you pass it on to the next person and they write them in the past. I think you're even more

157
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:51,440
 fun rather than more pretentious. Yeah, no, it does aren't actually quite fun. I said collaborative books

158
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,120
 that I really like. I've been obsessed with them since I've arrived in this country. I haven't read

159
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,760
 them yet. Was it too very high? No, but sweet valley high. It also obviously fits into this category.

160
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:04,160
 So no, this is not one single author but Mills and Boone. You love Mills and Vic? I love the concept

161
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:09,040
 of them. I just love the turn around. No, I really, I'd love to write one one day. I'd love to write a

162
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:13,520
 science fiction one and I know that they don't have or I thought they didn't have their own science

163
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:18,880
 fiction arm. They do. They do. There's a science fiction paranormal arm. There's amazing titles.

164
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:23,120
 They do this thing, by the way, where they, if someone in a paranormal one visits a dinosaur and

165
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:28,080
 has an erotic moment with a dinosaur, they don't consider it bestiality because all the animals

166
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:34,800
 and crypto animals in it are intelligent. They're just like us. They're consenting. Yeah, so taken

167
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:39,440
 by T-Rex. Hang on, it's still like, oh. Hang on, I remember seeing these book covers. They did

168
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,440
 around the world got like dinosaur erotica. Was that Mills and Boone? That was, that was Danny

169
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:51,360
 mailing them. That's my novel. I've got a birthday coming up. Hint hint. I've got taken by T-Rex.

170
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:58,240
 The rest are two rude Frankenstein's bitch. That's not rude, that's lazy. That's lazy, lazy writing.

171
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:06,880
 Milked by aliens. That's not even a sexy thing. That's just farming. This one's the oddest.

172
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:13,840
 Come for big foot. But here's the thing. So Mills and Boone, why I'm fascinated by it is that

173
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:19,520
 no same book stays on the shelf for longer than three months. They pulp it straight after. Wow.

174
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:26,960
 So they have a huge turnaround and in 2008 they were saying every 6.6 seconds someone bought

175
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:32,720
 a Mills and Boone book. The same guy. It was dad. He was standing at the till with a bigger and bigger

176
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:37,040
 pile next to him. No, I've got to have another one. I've picked this one already. You can read them

177
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:43,680
 very quickly to be fair. They are quite for three quarters of all romance novels that are bought

178
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:48,960
 into this country. I like how we're calling these romance taken by a T-Rex. I've headed back to

179
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:55,520
 the romance anyway. Did you hear that brilliant thing about what they do with pulp mousen bins?

180
00:15:55,520 --> 00:16:01,360
 Yeah, that's a key why question. The M6 of the M8 tool road is made up for pulp mousen bins.

181
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:06,320
 So when you drive down, you're driving over all those. Fantastic. They use the foundations in the

182
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,320
 foundations to stabilise it. That's why it's always a bit of a turn on when you're driving,

183
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,920
 driving down the M6. Probably only for down. Yeah, turn them and turn on.

184
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:22,160
 So I was looking at libraries and the Tarzan books were banned from some libraries in America in

185
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:27,280
 the 1950s because Tarzan and Jane were living in sin. Wow. Yeah. What's the great fact you told me

186
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:32,560
 about Tarzan, Hannah? It's that, oh yeah, the guy who wrote Tarzan is the great grandfather of

187
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:38,400
 Wes Anderson. Oh yeah, true. A good rice furrow. Yes. So I was just looking at other, or I stumbled

188
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:42,800
 upon other stuff that's been banned for amusing reasons. And do you guys remember a couple of years

189
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:49,840
 ago when dictionaries were removed from classrooms in California? No. No. A parent complained that

190
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:55,280
 a child stumbled across in the Mary Webster dictionary the phrase oral sex. So the district spokes

191
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:59,440
 women Betty Cadmus told a newspaper that the books were immediately pulled off the shelves and

192
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,680
 temporarily housed off location to make sure that children didn't get their hands on it. And I really

193
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:09,200
 like it. It wasn't me that spotted this stunning irony. It was a blogger who's Dennis Barron,

194
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:13,440
 who's a professor of linguistics, pointed out that her name was Betty Cadmus, who was issuing the

195
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:19,760
 statements. Cadmus was the Phoenician who brought writing to the ancient Greeks. Wow. And she's

196
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:25,840
 good away. In it away. Right. It's nice, isn't it? So good. In the 1960s, in public libraries,

197
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:30,720
 you used to have things which were called block books, which were wooden blocks on the shelves.

198
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:36,000
 And that was in place of any books that librarians thought were riskate or obscene or, you know,

199
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,240
 like top shelf. Well, what you had to do basically, you had to take the block to the counter,

200
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,480
 and then they would get the book out from under the desk and give it to you. Was it to shame people,

201
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,240
 because you feel really dodgy when someone had to go beneath the counter to get something to do?

202
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,000
 Driving at the front desk was just an armful of wooden blocks. I'd like all these, please.

203
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:58,320
 Granny behind you giving you a really disapproving state. It's Tarzan, come on. Do you guys know what the

204
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:03,280
 most banned book in 2013 was? I think this was in America. What's the time trying to ban the killer

205
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:10,720
 walking bird again? I don't know. That was banned though. Was it atheism for sexy people?

206
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,080
 Was it Billy Goat? This is just another excuse to slip in a fact, but Billy Goat's

207
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,160
 gruff was banned in Oregon because it was deemed too violent for children to be in a children's

208
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:25,120
 library. Oh, but I'd take it. It wasn't that. It was Captain Underpants by Dan Pilke.

209
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:30,080
 That's an outrage. It's one of the great works of literature of the 20th century. Fantastic

210
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:36,720
 kids books. I've never heard of them. They're very popular. There were about a headmaster who gets

211
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:43,680
 hypnotized into thinking that he's Captain Underpants and any time a certain key word goes off,

212
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:48,080
 he suddenly becomes Captain Underpants and runs around with a cape and his underpants and does

213
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:52,880
 adventures and it's all in his head. I really thought you were going to say any time a certain

214
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,600
 key word goes on, he whips his underpants off. He's saying he's a head teacher. I just sort of see

215
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,920
 why he's books with bands. If he's Captain Underpants, does he wear his trousers over his underpants,

216
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:06,080
 like the opposite of Superman, who famously wears his underpants over his trousers? But Superman's

217
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:12,080
 not called Captain trousers. That's where my clever analogy breaks down, unfortunately.

218
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:18,640
 Also, another band book. I was very surprised by this. Where's Wally? Got banned for quite a long time.

219
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:23,840
 Why is it so frustrating? Because it's too hard. It's called Where's Waldo, but someone noticed,

220
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:28,480
 so in the Americas, where's Waldo, someone noticed that in one of the drawings that on a beach,

221
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,720
 there was a topless lady laying on the beach. A drool and a topless woman. Yeah, and you could,

222
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:37,440
 I mean, she was laying on her stomach, lifting up, so it was kind of more side boob. Well, it's obscene,

223
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,360
 and I've discussed it. Well, I reckon the person that found her was probably a genius at finding

224
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:45,360
 Wally. You can find boob on the page. Yeah, well, I'm sure he's fantastic at finding oral sex and

225
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:51,280
 addiction, or as well. Some people are just desperate to be offended. I really like this. In the

226
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:56,720
 second world war, some authorities, some local authorities established, they put collections of

227
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:02,240
 books in air raid shelters, so there was a tube station at Bethel Green, and it had 4,000 books in it,

228
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:07,200
 and 6,000 people would turn up every night in the shelters, and they'd have a library available to them.

229
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,680
 And they were really, really sort of intellectual books, as well, like Bertram Russell, and Chopin Howe,

230
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:17,280
 and all kinds of... Oh, I see that the people with low brown taste don't deserve to be entertained

231
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:22,800
 in air raids. No, I'm just saying it's, you know, a very impressive thinking of people sheltering

232
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:26,000
 from air raids, and also reading some of the great works. But, you know, I'd be so pissed off,

233
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,560
 you're terrified, you just need something easy to distract you, and all you've got is great works

234
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:35,280
 of philosophy. Exactly. I would have preferred books with the titles like How to Survive an Air

235
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:42,240
 Raid, and How to Survive Being Trapped in a Small Tunnel with a group of other very, very scared

236
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:47,440
 humans. Some very escapist, though, as it's more sort of in the brutal realism tradition.

237
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:53,520
 Okay, well, when we're fighting over the last rat in the tunnel and you're quoting deep philosophy

238
00:20:53,520 --> 00:21:00,000
 to me. And Dan's munching away on his rodent, who's having the better time? Because I read 101

239
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:06,160
 ways to cook a rodent. The first of a mobile library was Horse Drawn. That's really nice.

240
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:11,680
 It's so cool. And they still have in bits of, I think North Africa, they have a camel mobile library.

241
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:15,840
 They travel around from town to town, and they have school books, and they do have all kinds of

242
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:20,080
 educational things. I just think that's incredible. Wow. And then when they stay for a few days,

243
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,680
 and then they go off across the desert again. Seeking out the next air raid shelter. That would have

244
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,960
 been cool. If you've gone to an air raid shelter, and they were just loads of camels, they're waiting for you.

245
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:32,240
 Dan would be trying to eat them. Yeah, they can. There are some places where it might be in the UK where

246
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,160
 you can get books in the National Health Service if you're depressed. Oh, I thought you meant books

247
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:39,600
 about the national health. So you actually mean you can get them prescribed. Yeah, but you can get

248
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,760
 books by books. Well, I can't like birch and rustle. I'm not sure what kind of life I'm not going to lie.

249
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:54,080
 Wound quarter rising for dummies. Okay, time for the final fact of this show. And that's my fact.

250
00:21:54,080 --> 00:22:00,960
 My fact this week is that it would cost $850 quadrillion to build the Death Star.

251
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:08,080
 And you're probably wondering how I. Yes, I know this. I discovered this fact. There's a website

252
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:12,560
 that you can go on online called We the People, which is set up by the White House, specifically for

253
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:18,320
 people who want to ask a question to Barack Obama. And the idea is that you put it up as a petition and

254
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:23,680
 if enough people sign it, the White House has to officially reply. And one of the questions was a

255
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:29,120
 response to secure resources and funding and begin construction of a Death Star by 2016.

256
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:35,280
 And the response, who is a fantastic response, they said, we can't do this. We agree that we share

257
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:40,800
 your desire for job creation, a strong national defense, but it's just not on the horizon. One being

258
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:46,400
 that it would cost $850 quadrillion to the administration does not support blowing up planets.

259
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:51,440
 Which is really what the White House administration character, how much have we cost them to build?

260
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,880
 Actually, no, it was someone else said they said it. They provided a link.

261
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:59,200
 You just find out. I was under 100. We can. Yeah, it's kind of a point. Is this feasible?

262
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:06,560
 Yeah, it's not. And also, it would take years and years to gather all the material that you would need.

263
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:11,600
 I think it said it would take 8333,315 years to make.

264
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,240
 Well, I'll be dead by then, by getting off steel.

265
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,000
 To get enough steel to actually make it.

266
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,240
 On petitions, you know this recent innovation in the British government, which is that the government

267
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:26,240
 has an e-petitions website and anything that gets 100,000 signatures is passed to a business committee

268
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:31,440
 in the House of Commons for possible debate. This has generated quite a lot of amazing petitions

269
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:38,080
 like ban, bowl, football players from Liverpool Football Club. Royal Baby to be given Lion King

270
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:47,600
 welcome. Isn't that good? Yeah. What is that held up on the end of a cliff? Yeah, by Rafiki.

271
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:54,080
 Do you know what's really cool is this Weaver People site? It's actually in terms of research,

272
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:58,960
 really fantastic place to find stuff out. So one of the petitions was asking the White House if they

273
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,960
 could release the recipe for the honey ale home brewed at the White House. I'll just quickly,

274
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:07,360
 just very quickly tell you about it, which is so President Obama bought a home brewing kit for

275
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:12,160
 his kitchen in the White House. And then they had the chefs and they had all the people who worked

276
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:17,920
 there, who do brew their own beer, come and sort of create this ultimate kind of recipe that

277
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:23,040
 they could then use. And now they stick to this one recipe and it's the White House's official

278
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:28,320
 honey ale brewing beer that they all drink there. It's the first as well. I've learned from this

279
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:33,680
 article. It's the first evidence that there's been beer brewed in the White House. So they have in

280
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:38,640
 the past have known that George Washington used to do whiskey, but that wasn't in the White House.

281
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:44,000
 That Jefferson used to make wine, but again that was, maybe that wasn't the White House, but this

282
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,080
 definitely the first beer in the White House. So President Obama has given the White House a beer.

283
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:55,440
 I at least he brought them something here. I don't mean that I quite like him. And lastly,

284
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:01,760
 what's really nice is the ingredients for the beer is all unique, but honey particularly because

285
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:06,880
 they use honey that they tap from the first ever beehive that the White House has had, which is on

286
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:13,360
 the South Lawn. Oh honey, their own beer. So it's their own beehive to create the honey for their own

287
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:18,000
 home brewed honey ale. A bunch of kind of rural hippies really aren't they? Yeah and if it takes off,

288
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,080
 they might leave this whole government nonsense. They might just go into beer brewing. That is what

289
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:26,960
 the Republicans want them to do. Yeah, we want smaller government and we want more home brewed honey ale.

290
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:33,600
 Obama, don't get as wrong, we like your beer. Do you end up in my favourite Star Wars fact?

291
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:38,720
 Go on. Oh yeah. It's that in sync, the band, just in Timberlake's band, made a cameo in Star Wars

292
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,240
 episode two Attack of the Clones, but they were cut out at the final version. Yeah, thank God.

293
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,960
 Another thing I love about Star Wars is Dave Pros, who was Star Fader's body. Dave Pros,

294
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,160
 also the Green Cross cult man. He gave him an interview a few days ago where he said that that was his

295
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:55,280
 best role of his life, was not being Vader, being the goodie and saving lives. He just ruined Darth Vader

296
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:58,960
 for a lot of captivated and terrified children now. I'm worried for him to say. Now I think he's a

297
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:04,000
 little goodie too. She's car safety. Darth Vader never crossed the road between two cars. You'll

298
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,960
 notice that in all the films. No matter what he might do. He did cross road safe. Never does it once.

299
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:14,160
 David Prouse has the best title of an autobiography. For me, I think it's called Straight from the

300
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:20,720
 Forces mouth. That is very good. Kind of. He doesn't talk in Star Wars. Well, he's not known for his

301
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,840
 thought. He's going to have the voice of Darth Vader. He did think he was going to have it. He was convinced

302
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:28,080
 that he was going to have it and then they revealed that actually we don't really want a West Country

303
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:32,720
 accent for this mask. Just scary, but there is a video kicking back of him doing the voice. I've

304
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:37,120
 seen it. It's brilliant. I actually came up with what I thought was a better title for his book,

305
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:42,640
 which is the Empire Strikes Hardback. That is very good. They have changed it for people back.

306
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:48,720
 Star Trek invented the touchscreen. Did it? Did it. Star Trek had Captain Kirk

307
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:55,200
 used to ride with his little touchscreen pen thing on a touchscreen. I mean, it's not like on set.

308
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:00,560
 They had this new touchscreen. They invented. Guys, should we patent this now or should we continue

309
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:05,760
 with the series? That is true. It is substantially harder to invent an iPad than it is to say,

310
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,840
 I've got a magic device that lets me do it. It's all to anyone. Like J.K. Rowling invented the

311
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:16,240
 invisibility cloak. I think we should invent something right now. Invisibility cloak does exist now,

312
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,640
 doesn't it? It does. It's like reflective stuff as well. Yeah, you can see it, see on the issue.

313
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,880
 I thought you couldn't. It doesn't. You can put it over your handle, your head they've tried it,

314
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,800
 and it doesn't tamper with anything around it. You can't. You can see the background behind it.

315
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,840
 Anyway, that's been invented. A hoverboard's been invented, which is apparently a thing for

316
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,520
 going back to the future, which is another thing. I saw a footage of it the other day. It looks amazing.

317
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:39,520
 It does look fun. It does look really cool. I mean, it looks very beta. It looks very

318
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,560
 early stages, but it is working. That's fantastic. There's a great blog about Star Trek inventions.

319
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:48,960
 Years ago it came out, so I'm sure most people, if they know Star Trek, know this, but someone did

320
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:56,320
 a list of all the things that Star Trek didn't invent. Including cup holders on the ship,

321
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:02,080
 always out of the cup in the head. Seat belts. They think a seat belt, they're always flying around

322
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:08,160
 the Star Trek when they're attacked. On Star Trek, inventing touch screens. The first touch screen

323
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:13,520
 in real life was invented in 1888, and it was invented by this person called Alicia Gray,

324
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:18,080
 and it was like a kind of fax machine, so it used this electric pen to transmit an electric signal

325
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:22,480
 across wires, and it meant you could draw a picture, and then someone at the other end, in 1888,

326
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,160
 could see the picture that you drawn, and this was used for things that needed signatures.

327
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:30,720
 So it was used quite commonly in hospitals and banks and stuff. You'd be like, oh, you need me to

328
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,680
 sign that. I'm sorry, I'm not here, but I'll just sign that over the phone. That's amazing.

329
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:39,280
 That is amazing. We still can't do that. Well, we don't anymore. Do we lose it? So we've lost

330
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:43,840
 technology. I mean, I don't know, I've never been able to sign over the telephone. Me neither.

331
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:48,720
 But you can't key in your pencil. We can't do that in 1800. It's faxing, isn't it? No, no, no,

332
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:54,560
 it's like life faxing. It's like draw something. I don't believe that. Me either. That's so excited

333
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:59,440
 there. It's a real thing. I suppose it sends an electric signal of a device moving over paper,

334
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:04,800
 doesn't it? Yeah, but we just, we don't have that. Are we? Using a, like, sure, I've got it somewhere,

335
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:11,200
 Google Docs. Check your draw. Alex has probably gone in the station recovered. He's been telling us

336
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:16,080
 to use it for years. Can I tell you my favorite Star Trek fact? This will be my last Star Trek fact.

337
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:22,880
 It's that Spock was originally going to be Martian. He was going to be from Mars. Wow. Yeah,

338
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:27,840
 but he didn't end up being Martian because the other writers kind of laughed the idea out of the

339
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:32,880
 room because they said by the time the series was nearing the end of its first series or a few series,

340
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:38,160
 we would be on Mars. No. No one would be. It would just not be believable. That's so funny. Yeah. That's

341
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:41,520
 great. So they made him from. I like it a bit. They thought wouldn't be believable with the

342
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:47,600
 holostar Trek. Yeah. Something about space that I learned recently. I'm reading Commander Chris

343
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:52,320
 Hadfield's book at the moment. I former captain of the International Space Station. He, when he was

344
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:57,120
 out on his first ever spacewalk and he was trying to fix something on the International Space Station,

345
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:02,560
 had a huge pain in his eye, which forced tears out of his eye, and he was saying that it ended up

346
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:08,240
 sending him blind because tears don't function like normal tears in space. They don't fall. They

347
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:14,480
 instead build up as a huge blob over your eye. So he was suddenly blind completely in one of his eyes

348
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,960
 because this huge body of water was sitting in front of it. And it got so big that it eventually

349
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:24,880
 passed over the bridge of his nose to his other eye. So suddenly he's out in space and he's trying

350
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:30,880
 to fix the International Space Station. And he completely blind. Literally blinded by his tears.

351
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,000
 But he has made a double bubble, right? Which is something you're always trying to do when you're

352
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:41,680
 playing bubbles. This is very inconvenient. Bad news, NASA, and some good news. The news were

353
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:47,200
 eight-year-old me. But apparently what would happen is naturally the tears would get so big that

354
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:52,080
 it couldn't hold it anymore. And it would flood space. It would flood all of space with

355
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:57,200
 people on this. But you'd still have to be seeing through a kind of, as if you were looking through

356
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:03,280
 goggles, I guess. So I was looking at other things that people have valued fictional things. They valued

357
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:09,680
 Mr. Burns's manner, which is worth $127 million. And that has to include things like a bottomless

358
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:14,400
 pit which he has. So let's see how many references a Simpsons fan listening can get. Bottomless

359
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:18,800
 pit are room containing a thousand monkeys banging on a thousand typewriters and a robotic Richard Simmons.

360
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:25,120
 Wayne Manon would be 105 million. But also, is that good? Yeah, it knows. It's affordable.

361
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:31,360
 With our affections. But they made a real Simpsons house in 1997. They ran a competition

362
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:38,000
 for someone to win the Simpsons house. And the winner had a choice of either taking him $75,000

363
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,760
 or, beginning to live in the Simpsons house, which have been totally re-created to look exactly

364
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:46,720
 like it inside and out. But if they chose the house option, they would contractually

365
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:52,560
 obliged as soon as they took their prize to repaint it so like a normal house again. So the person who

366
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:57,440
 wanted took the 75 grand. I thought you were going to say the contract was every day when they got

367
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:02,800
 home. They had to re-create the intro title sequence, which would eventually get very annoying.

368
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,800
 They have to paint themselves yellow. They have to paint themselves yellow. They should be

369
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:10,160
 killed during a couple of their fingers as well. Yes. Yeah. Do they do that? Oh yeah, of course, sorry.

370
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,800
 Famous opening sequence of the Simpsons. Well, they all cut off their own fingers. Yeah.

371
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:23,440
 Okay, that's it. That's all of our facts. Thanks so much for listening. If you want to get in contact
