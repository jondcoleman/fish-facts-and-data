00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.440
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish Presents International Fact-Ball.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:11.880
 This is a only football podcast out there on the net that makes absolutely no mention of football whatsoever,

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.840
 brought to you by the QILs in association with Visitingland.com.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.320
 My name is Dan, I'm sitting here with James Andy and Anna,

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.400
 and it's time for our match, which is Nigeria versus Bosnia.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.480
 And I start with Nigeria.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:26.880
 As the whistle, let's go.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.320
 Nigeria has the twin capital of the world.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.360
 What? What does that mean?

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.360
 It's a town called Igbo Aura.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.880
 It's got a population of about 60,000, I think,

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.840
 and one in six births there are twins.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.440
 -One in six. -One in six.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.800
 The European average being one in 1,000, that's a pretty hefty twin rate.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:43.600
 So, you know why?

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.800
 They claim it's, oh, some people claim it's because of their diet,

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.080
 but there's no real evidence for that, so I think it's probably genetic.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.560
 Oh, yeah, they say it's Yams, isn't it?

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.360
 Nigeria is the world's largest producer of Yams,

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.560
 also of Casava and Calpis.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.680
 Yeah, in fact, Yams are so popular in Nigeria

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.320
 that they have on their version of Sesame Street,

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.800
 which is called Sesame Square.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:04.800
 The Cookie Monster.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.320
 Cookie Monster has a different name, and he eats Yams.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.160
 But they also have a character, which is really nice, I think.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.880
 It's a character who has HIV.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:13.920
 -Oh, wow. -That is nice.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.880
 It is nice, because, I mean, it's obviously a problem,

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.000
 and it's a character that educates children about the disease,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.560
 so they're not afraid of people who have it, you know.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.920
 -Well, it's really good. -Okay, I found this fact courtesy of Mark Mason,

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.360
 actually, who's a friend of us.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.640
 One in six black people in the world is from Nigeria.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:30.840
 It's a massive country.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.840
 A population is 168 million.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:33.800
 -Wow. -Isn't that amazing?

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.520
 -Yes, that isn't amazing. -Yeah, it's really, really massive population.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:37.800
 -That's very exciting. -I know.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.840
 The brawl broke out in the Nigerian parliament last year.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.040
 It was about the re-election candidacy of Good Luck, Jonathan,

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.600
 and it's so great, it's in their house of representatives,

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.600
 and they just start having a big punch-up.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.840
 And so, everyone, all the politicians that are getting together

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.640
 and a politician tears another one's shirt, people are hitting each other.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.000
 There's a woman who just poaks this guy in the face repeatedly.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.320
 There's another politician who picks up a chair above his head,

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.640
 and then does that thing where he's like, "I think I've gone too far."

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.240
 So he just suspends this chair above his head really awkwardly for about five minutes.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.200
 -Wow, like WWE wrestling. -It's kind of like that.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.840
 -That sounds amazing. -He's got a really awesome name as well, hasn't he?

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.200
 -I like your name, you know. -An amazing name.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.120
 His family's trade was canoe-making.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.880
 -Oh, really? -Really? -Yeah, cool.

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.720
 He studied zoology at university, though, so he didn't go into the family business.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.760
 -Okay. -Just speaking of nice names,

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.760
 I discovered it, and I'd never heard of this before,

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.920
 but Nigeria actually have the second largest movie industry in the world,

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.720
 behind Bollywood, and so this is the name that I love.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.320
 -Nollywood. -It's Nollywood.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.840
 -That's great. -Yeah, and it's massive.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:35.800
 They're really, really massive.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.920
 But just to quickly go down the name road very quickly,

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.840
 an actor, a very famous Nigerian actor,

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.960
 recently took a lot of stick for the fact that he named his kids both Hollywood

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.160
 and Nollywood.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.960
 He had to release a statement in the end because he was getting so much hassle

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.840
 from everyone in the media about the fact that he named his kids.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.280
 He said that there was nothing wrong with giving his bundles of joy.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.920
 The names King Praise, Michelle Victor,

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.880
 Tokawar, Jessobo, Laioloa, Hollywood,

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.800
 and Queen Grace, Michelle, Victoria,

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.360
 Paculia, Chimera, Jessica Mera,

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.800
 Ompolo, Nollywood.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.720
 It's typical of the press to fix eight on the word Nollywood or Hollywood

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.040
 when there were other names like Paculia.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.080
 -Yeah, there were. -It's like eight other names in each name.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.320
 To pick on, but they didn't they didn't go for it.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.840
 Nollywood is really interesting.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.200
 Nollywood makes so much money and so many films.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.920
 They make over 2,400 films per year.

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.400
 Their budgets are only 10 to 15 grand,

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:35.160
 and the piracy levels there are such that there's 10 illegal copies to every legit copy.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.920
 So they'll pick up within the hundreds of thousands for each movie.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.200
 There are some titles.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.360
 "Tare my brachets if you can."

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.120
 "Bumbum Soup" and "Mama Insurance."

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.240
 I love.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.880
 -Chicken madness. -Chicken madness is great.

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.880
 -What is "Bumbum Soup" about?

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.640
 -I have not been able to clarify because I don't want the search term in my Google history.

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:03.880
 I read that Nigeria had the oldest man ever to live.

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:09.160
 And I think it's incredibly dubious because the age he supposedly lived to was 160.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.440
 -Yes, I think that might be dubious. -I don't know how it's dubious.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.680
 His name was Paaki and Paaki lived to 160.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.640
 And he realized while he was 160 that he didn't have a single photograph of himself,

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.160
 he decided to call the photographer and said, "Can you come over and take a photo of me?"

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.600
 And while the photographer was on his way over, Paaki died.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:29.560
 -No. -Yeah.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.000
 Before we got his chances.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.480
 And his grandkids wanted the photo to still happen,

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.680
 so they put him on a chair and they had the photographer take a picture.

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.200
 His grandkids who were presumably like 110 years old.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.960
 -Oh, yeah, good boy. -Yeah.

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.520
 I'm not sure about Paaki's story. That's a very good point.

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:49.400
 While we're on Nigeria, we should probably talk about Nigerian 4-9 email scam.

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.600
 Because they're so good and creative.

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.960
 We covered this a bit on QI.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.360
 Basically, hey, they're not Nigerian properly.

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.600
 The people who introduced them to Nigeria were probably British scammers.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.280
 In 1914, the British ambassador to Spain warned Nigerian colonial officers

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.920
 about these pan and paper letter scams saying, "By the way, there's a great fortune here.

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.080
 Do you want to get in on this? If you pay me a little bit of money,

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.920
 I'll give you all a huge sum."

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:14.520
 And then we gave them the scam.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:15.320
 Yeah, yeah.

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.880
 They took it and ran with it very enthusiastically.

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.480
 I think the vessels coming in soon.

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.560
 Because we're definitely nearing half-time.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.520
 Anyone got any last second facts they want to throw in?

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:25.320
 Yes, yeah.

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.160
 In the Nigerian Navy, there are 20 ships.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.360
 All of whose names mean hippopotamus in various local languages.

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.160
 -Oh, wow. -That's not good.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.040
 Okay, there's the halftime whistle.

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.120
 That means it's time for our halftime show.

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.520
 Got you by visitingland.com.

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.920
 And this comes in the form of a QI quiz.

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.200
 We've got three questions for you.

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:47.080
 Which the answers will be revealed at the end of our podcast.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.320
 Okay, so question number one, James, what do you got?

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:53.720
 Okay, my question is, in 1348, sensing weakness,

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.360
 the Scots invaded Northern England.

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.920
 Why did their invasion not go according to plan?

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:04.520
 Andy, question number two.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.520
 My question is, what line to the entire south and east coast of England

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.360
 in the summer of 1976?

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.080
 Anna, third question.

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.680
 Which English writer made the first known reference to potato chips?

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.600
 Okay, that's good.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:19.960
 All right, so there's the three questions.

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.640
 If you want to find out the answers to those,

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:24.120
 you better stay tuned to the end of our podcast

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:25.560
 and we'll reveal them there.

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.000
 But now it's time to go back to the match.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.080
 And it's the second half and Bosnia.

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:30.360
 All right.

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.520
 You like this, Dan? You like your national anthem?

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.600
 I do, lovely. You know what the national anthem of Bosnia

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:35.400
 and Herz governor is?

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:36.200
 I do not know.

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.240
 It is called the national anthem of Bosnia and Herz governor.

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.680
 Nice, fantastic.

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.040
 Do you think that has anything to do with the fact

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:44.120
 that they're so confused about their language?

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:48.120
 So they speak Serbian, Bosnian, and Croatian,

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.960
 which are the same language.

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.840
 But for political reasons, it's very controversial.

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.080
 James has got a vulcan roots.

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:57.240
 Most people acknowledge that if you speak one of them,

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.920
 you can completely understand the others.

00:06:58.920 --> 00:06:59.560
 That's true.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.320
 They're like dialects of the same language.

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:02.600
 Virtually identical.

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:02.920
 Yep.

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:04.280
 You can tell one from the other.

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:06.360
 There are slightly different words, but yeah, they are.

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:07.720
 So like on cigarette packets,

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.480
 if you look at a cigarette packet in Bosnia,

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:12.760
 you have the same warning, just three lines of it

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:13.800
 because they've got to do it.

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.880
 There's three different languages, yeah.

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:17.080
 I've got a football fact.

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:17.960
 I'm going to throw in.

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:19.560
 I know we don't do football.

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:20.120
 Yeah.

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:23.000
 It's the fact that the questions that come up in the press conferences

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.760
 when they've been going to this year's World Cup

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:27.480
 is inevitably will your players be allowed

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:29.640
 to be drinking and have sex?

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:33.000
 And a number of the coaches who get asked these questions

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 have actually openly said, no, no sex as a sex band going on.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.040
 And I like the Bosnian coaches answer to this question.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:41.400
 He has put a sex band on.

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:44.120
 He said they can find another solution.

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.720
 They can even masturbate if they want.

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:51.080
 And then there was a sense of he kind of regretted saying that out loud afterwards

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:52.600
 because that's not a thing he's saying.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:54.120
 Usually the referees are wanker.

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:00.360
 Since you did mention, this is worth mentioning, I'd still on football,

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:01.720
 but it's not international football.

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:04.760
 There's a goalkeeper, an amateur goalkeeper in Bosnia.

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:05.960
 And you have to bear in mind for this,

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:07.880
 that a ball-con tradition is like a big ceremony

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:10.440
 like weddings and births is to fire off guns,

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:11.720
 especially in moral areas.

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:12.760
 So in...

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:14.120
 Yeah, 8K-47s.

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:14.920
 8K-47s.

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:19.720
 Yeah, like, what a wedding. There was an amateur football game going on

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:22.440
 on the outskirts of Sarajevo, I think it was last year.

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:27.000
 And the keeper, Dusko Kertelitsa, suddenly it got a headache

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.520
 and he assumed it was because.

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:30.840
 He thought he'd bashed his head into the side of the goalposts.

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:32.840
 So he played the full 90-minute match.

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:35.800
 At the end of the match, it became apparent that he'd been shot in the head,

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:36.840
 right, in the start of the match.

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:37.800
 And he continued to play.

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:40.040
 He felt a pain in his arm had to be rushed to hospital,

00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:42.920
 where they found a 9mm bullet lodged in his brain.

00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:44.600
 Oh my god.

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:47.160
 So he would be there going, "I think I'm having a hard attack.

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:49.640
 I've got this numbness down my arm."

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.080
 No, no, no, don't worry.

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.120
 It's much better.

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:54.040
 In the bed next door, there's a guy saying,

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:55.560
 "I think I've been shot in the head.

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:57.080
 Are you sure you're having a hard attack?"

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:59.320
 But this is too much football.

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:02.040
 I'm pulling us over to another sport.

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:05.000
 How many Macedos in Bosnia and Bullfights are killed?

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.840
 Per year. None.

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:07.960
 That's it. The answer is none.

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:10.280
 Because there are no Macedos in Bosnia and Bullfights.

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:11.640
 The fights aren't between bulls.

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:16.440
 And it's not one is the Matador and has to go to the other bull.

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:18.600
 How do they get the bulls to fight each other?

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:22.280
 It's like a bull whisperer going, "I can't just call you a asshole."

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:26.360
 I think there's a pitch, which is a rough area.

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:29.240
 And then they each pull are trying to chase their opponents away.

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:32.280
 It's just encouraging their natural instincts to be dominant, basically.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.920
 Are the bulls allowed to have sex a night before a fighter?

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:36.920
 I have not found data.

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:38.760
 Also, none of the bulls are killed because they just back down

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:41.000
 when they're losing a fight badly.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.800
 So, fatalities are very rare.

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:45.800
 Really? Yeah. That is good.

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:48.760
 It's still bullfighting.

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:51.240
 It's still bullfighting, but it's unusual bullfighting.

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:52.520
 It should call it bullfighting.

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:59.160
 Sarajevo, when I think of Sarajevo, I think of a big incident.

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.720
 What's the first thing that comes to mind for you, Sarajevo?

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:03.160
 The shooting of Archtune.

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:08.120
 The ice skating with Toval and Dean.

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:09.800
 The Belera, that was in Sarajevo.

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:11.640
 Okay, right. But did you know that...

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:14.360
 So, Archtune for an unknown, obviously, assassinated there,

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:16.760
 but there was a previous assassination attempt on him.

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:18.280
 Was it to do with ice skating?

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:19.960
 Someone threw an ice skate at him.

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:23.960
 No, someone threw a lip bomb at his car.

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:28.280
 He saw it coming, and he battered it away with his hand.

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:30.760
 And it exploded in the street.

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:32.600
 Wow, and that's how volleyball was invented.

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:37.480
 In fact, for the first 30 years, volleyball was only played with lip bombs.

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:38.440
 That's ridiculous.

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:44.760
 Is the guy who threw it, Cabrinovic, to avoid capture after doing that.

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:47.160
 He saw a design eye capsule and threw himself into the river.

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.080
 But at the time, the river was 10 centimeters deep.

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:51.080
 And so, within seconds, he was pulled out by police man.

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:56.120
 We are actually approaching the end of the match.

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:58.680
 So, if I will quickly get in, injury time.

00:10:58.680 --> 00:10:59.880
 Okay, here's something.

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:02.920
 Police chiefs in Bosnia have spent £70,000

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:06.520
 buying 1,300 pairs of new shoes and boots for their officers

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:10.360
 from an outfitters that only supplies footwear for bodies to wearing coffins.

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:12.360
 Wow.

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:14.600
 Yeah, and the police aren't very happy about this.

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:17.240
 Officers complain that the shoes that were never meant to be walked in

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:19.560
 fell apart after just a few hours on the beat.

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:23.160
 Of course, that's lovely.

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:23.800
 We're not.

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:24.440
 Anyone else?

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:25.960
 I have an extremely quick fact.

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:26.200
 Yeah.

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:27.800
 So, at the 1984 Winter Olympics,

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:30.120
 it took place in Sarajevo at the opening ceremony.

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:31.880
 They raised the Olympic flag upside down.

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:33.320
 Oh.

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:34.040
 I'll court it.

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:34.840
 Yeah.

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:35.640
 I'll court it.

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:38.040
 Oh, my days.

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:39.160
 That is the other than that.

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:39.960
 You can't believe it.

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:40.680
 So, quick.

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:41.720
 Put a great one.

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:44.280
 Before we find out who won today's match,

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:46.520
 though, we are going to quickly find out the answers

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:49.880
 to that visitingland.com quiz that we did earlier.

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:54.280
 And the answers and questions and the answers are, James.

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:57.720
 Okay, in 1348, the Scots invaded Northern England,

00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:01.800
 sensing weakness because England was suffering from the plague.

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:03.960
 The Scots arrived, caught the plague,

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:06.440
 went back and killed half of their own population.

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:09.480
 Oh, my God, it's an own goal.

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:10.680
 After you hold England.

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:12.280
 They should not have visited England.

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:13.720
 But you should.

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:16.360
 Andy, question number two.

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:20.440
 My question was what lined the south and east coasts of England

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:21.960
 in the summer of 1976?

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:23.880
 And the answer is Ladybirds.

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:27.000
 It's called the Ladybird Explosion of 1976.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.560
 There was just the perfect conditions for them the year before,

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:32.120
 and then billions and billions rose out of the ground

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:34.280
 all across the country and moved south looking for food.

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:37.880
 And 400 miles of tideline consisted of little but solid Ladybirds.

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:39.000
 Wow. Yeah.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:39.880
 That's great.

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:41.320
 Okay, Anna, last question.

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:44.680
 Yeah, my question was which English writer made the first known reference

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:45.480
 to potato chips?

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:47.880
 And it was Dickens in a tale of two cities.

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:50.280
 He mentioned husky chips of potato fried

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:52.280
 with some reluctant drops of oil.

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:53.480
 Wow.

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:54.680
 Here you go.

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:57.640
 All right, so that's all the answers to our quiz questions.

00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:59.160
 If you got them right, congratulations.

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:00.600
 There are no prizes.

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:02.840
 However, if you do want a prize of some sort,

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:04.440
 you can head over to Visitingland.com.

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:05.720
 Where they're running a competition

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:07.800
 where you could go into win some QI goodies,

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:12.600
 including a book which would be personally signed to you by Andy Murray

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:14.440
 with any dedication that you want.

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:15.080
 Literally anything.

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:16.040
 I will write anything.

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:16.680
 He will write anything.

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:19.080
 There's also hats and t-shirts and so on.

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:21.240
 Anyway, we need to find out who won today's match.

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:23.640
 So who do you think did best today?

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:25.240
 I love the Nollywood stuff.

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:26.440
 So I would say Nigeria.

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:27.640
 Yeah, I like Nigeria as well.

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:29.080
 All right, Nigeria, well done.

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:32.600
 You make it through to the next round of the International Factible

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:33.560
 Competition.

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:36.760
 If you want to ask any of us on this podcast about the things

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:39.080
 we were talking about, maybe just the winner,

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:41.240
 we can be reached on our Twitter handles.

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:42.440
 I'm on @Sriberland.

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:42.920
 James.

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:43.800
 @egshaped.

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:44.520
 Andy.

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:45.640
 @andruhunterm.

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:46.680
 And Anna.

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:49.480
 You can get me on @quikipedia, the QI Twitter feed.

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:53.400
 But you can also join the #GetAnnerOnTwitter campaign,

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:56.200
 which is picking up a lot of energy in this office.

00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:00.040
 OK, that's it for this match.

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:01.560
 If you want to join us again tomorrow,

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:02.520
 we're going to be doing this again

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:06.520
 with another bout of two giants in the world of Factible.

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:07.640
 And it is, James.

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:08.760
 Definitely giants.

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:11.160
 It's the USA versus Russia.

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:11.960
 Oh.

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:12.760
 Oh, my days.

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:13.960
 That will be a good one.

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:15.080
 OK, all right.

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:16.680
 We'll see you again tomorrow for that match.

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:17.640
 Thanks for listening, everyone.
