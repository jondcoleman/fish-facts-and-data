00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.760
 - We run it on QI a few years ago.

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:02.600
 - Yeah.

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.600
 - Which was, there's no such thing as a fish.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:05.720
 - And it's not such thing as a fish.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.320
 - No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.120
 of Underwater Life.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.560
 It says it right now, first paragraph.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:12.800
 No such thing as a fish.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.380
 (upbeat music)

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:21.760
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.360
 of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.800
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:27.920
 My name is Dan Triber.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.520
 I'm sitting here with three other elves,

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.240
 James Harkin, Alex Bell, and Anichezinski.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.120
 And once again, we've gathered around the microphone

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.560
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.440
 And here we go, in no particular order.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.280
 Here they are.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.260
 (upbeat music)

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:42.880
 Okay, back number one, Alex.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.640
 - Okay, when he was bored, Calvin Coolidge

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.960
 used to ring a bell to summon his bodyguards

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.440
 and then hide from them under the oval office desk.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.720
 (laughing)

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:52.560
 - Really?

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:53.400
 - Yep.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.240
 - Just as a joke.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.720
 But I mean, presumably after the first time you've done that.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.280
 Or did they have to be like parents?

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.120
 - It's too bad.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:00.960
 - It's too bad for your child.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.120
 - Oh, where does it be?

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.120
 Oh no!

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:03.960
 - Probably.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.320
 - Yeah, I wouldn't have much trust in them

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.120
 if they were continually fooled by it every time.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.960
 - That would be the worst of it.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.920
 - You would fire your secret service straight away.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.640
 You'd be like, seriously, this is the second time you're done.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:14.480
 - Yeah.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.160
 - Well, actually speaking of firing people and hiding,

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.720
 I found a completely sort of slightly related fact

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.720
 as well, secondary fact.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.680
 - Herbert Hoover had a really strict privacy policy

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.240
 to the point where whenever he or his wife were on the approach,

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.600
 the White House staff would signal to each other

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.640
 using the bell system in the White House

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.280
 and then hide in a cupboard or behind bushes

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.080
 or something like that,

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.760
 because he hated seeing his stuff

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.640
 and really liked his privacy.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.400
 And they risked being fired if they were seen.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.720
 So anytime he came into a room,

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:43.840
 they would sort of have to scramble around

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:44.680
 and try and hide somewhere.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:45.640
 They also used to doing this

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.920
 that when Harry Truman took over the presidency,

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:48.920
 moved into the White House, yes.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.800
 - He was like, "Where are all my stuff?"

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.240
 Herbert Hoover invented Hoover Ball, didn't he?

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.240
 Which was--

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.280
 - Is it as soon as he gets the ball

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.600
 or the other player's hide and cover it?

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.760
 So he just gets the ball right to the ball line?

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:01.600
 - Yeah.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.840
 - Even hides under a desk, yes.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:03.680
 - This is when we find them.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.040
 - That's Cool Ridge Ball.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.720
 - No, it was actually invented by his doctor to keep him fit.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.320
 And it's a cross between according to the government website,

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.000
 tennis, volleyball, and medicine ball.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 Which do you guys know what that is?

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 - Medicine ball, yeah.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.760
 It's a big ball that you use for exercise.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:18.920
 - Yeah. - That big and everything.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.160
 So it's basically like volleyball

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.200
 with a unbelievably heavy ball about the weight

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.520
 of a newborn baby

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.200
 and you throw it over the net.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.320
 Calvin Coolidge liked to eat breakfast in bed

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.440
 while having his head rubbed with Vaseline.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.040
 - Was he bald?

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.080
 'Cause that is a recipe for greasy hair.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.920
 - No, no, that's really bad.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.600
 - You know the guy who invented Vaseline?

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.640
 He was, I forgot his name,

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.000
 cheeseburger or something like that.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.200
 He thought that Vaseline was like a big sort of cure all

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.920
 and he used to eat it every single day

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.400
 and he used to rub it on his body all the time

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.880
 'cause he thought it would cure him of all illness.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.320
 - And did it?

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.400
 - Well, he's dead.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.240
 - Okay.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.720
 So it didn't make him live forever.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.680
 - Yeah, okay, so it wasn't an elixir.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.560
 I can understand why he does that.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.240
 I once went on a date and I couldn't find any hair gel

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.120
 and my hair was really all over the shop.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.960
 - If this is something about Mary's story,

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.080
 can I stop you there?

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.920
 - I put tiger balm in my hair

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.680
 and my god, that was the most intense sensation

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.520
 I've ever had.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.400
 It was like putting chilies all over my head.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.360
 It was just like on fire

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.440
 and my head stunk like hell.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.320
 I got in the train and everyone was like,

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:25.160
 what is that?

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.560
 - Was that a successful date?

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.240
 - It was 'cause in the end, I had to admit it.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.720
 I was like, by the way, the reason my head smells like this

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.560
 is because I did tiger balm over my head

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.280
 and she said, I really like smell.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.000
 - It is quite a nice smell and if you have a cold,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.720
 it's quite so maybe if she was a bit blocked up.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:39.560
 - Exactly.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:40.400
 - You would have really helped her out.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.240
 - Exactly, my sinuses were, I can credit all that.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.320
 My point is though, is that maybe the Vaseline on his head

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.800
 while he's eating kind of gives a slight kind of

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:47.840
 like putting Tabasco on your face?

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.240
 - Maybe that's how he managed to get Mrs. Coolidge.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.080
 She was like, oh really?

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.960
 - Yeah, it was a smell of Vaseline.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.440
 - Have you thought of tiger balm?

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.400
 - There is a thing called the Coolidge effect.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.240
 Do you know that?

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.080
 - No.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.080
 - The idea is that male animals prefer to have sex

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.880
 with females they've never seen before

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.720
 than females that they have seen before

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:04.920
 and it's called the Coolidge effects

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.760
 and it's named after Calvin Coolidge.

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:07.760
 - Why?

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.640
 - It's a story about him and his wife

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.560
 who were being shown around the farm

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.560
 and they got to a chicken yard

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.760
 and Mrs. Coolidge noticed that the male chicken

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.240
 was having sex a lot and she said to the guy,

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.600
 does he do that a lot?

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.600
 And he said, oh yeah, he has sex about 12 times a day

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.760
 and she goes, well, you should tell that to my husband.

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.640
 So then the guy went to Calvin Coolidge

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.200
 and he said, oh, this chicken has sex 12 times a day

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.000
 and your wife told me to tell you about it

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.760
 and he said, oh, is it the same chicken every time

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:36.600
 that you have sex with?

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.200
 And this guy said, no, it's a different chicken every time

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.920
 and said, well, tell that to my wife then.

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.040
 - Just a chicken farm and named it then.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.360
 - It was named after that anecdote

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.120
 which I guess probably didn't even happen.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.960
 - Yeah.

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:47.800
 - But just to make this clear,

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:48.960
 that is a really cruel thing he said.

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.760
 So he did basically say the only reason

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.280
 he wants to keep having sex is 'cause it's not

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:53.560
 with my wife every time.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.440
 He's saying, if I was to have sex 12 times a day,

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:57.680
 it wouldn't be with you.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:58.520
 - Yeah.

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.120
 - To be fair, is a pretty soggy move on her part.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.960
 - That was the way it goes.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.040
 - No one comes across well in that anecdote at all

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.280
 apart from the chicken.

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.560
 (laughing)

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.440
 - Do you know, I only found something the other day,

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.240
 a weird number of presidents of one Grammy Awards

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.440
 for spoken word albums.

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:14.280
 - Really?

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.760
 - So I stumbled upon this 'cause Hillary Clinton

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.160
 did a spoken word album which was

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.680
 some kind of, you know,

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.680
 telling us how we should live better album in the '90s.

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.320
 Obama's won two Grammys for spoken words.

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:26.160
 - Oh, really spoken words.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.800
 - Oh, they are well spoken.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:28.800
 - Yeah.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.080
 (laughing)

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.920
 - True.

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.600
 - Clinton's got won, both the Clinton's got won Jimmy Carter.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:34.440
 - To be a president.

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.280
 - You have to be well spoken though, don't you?

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.080
 You have to be good at doing speeches, so.

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.920
 - Yeah.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:39.760
 - Not that surprised me.

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:40.600
 - It makes total sense.

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:41.440
 - Yeah.

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:42.680
 - I wonder who didn't get one.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.760
 - Well, George Bush certainly didn't.

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:45.600
 - Did he not?

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:46.440
 - Yet.

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.120
 - So, is there any night just full of presidents,

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.320
 just waiting the best spoken word?

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:53.920
 We've got Clinton, Obama.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.320
 - I think the presidents are the only ones

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.680
 who are asked to make audio tapes.

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.840
 - It would be like, the winner is Calvin Coolidge.

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.680
 Has anyone seen Calvin Coolidge?

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.880
 (laughing)

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.360
 - I want to talk about hide and seek

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:07.280
 'cause we were talking about hide and seek.

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:08.120
 - Oh yeah, yeah.

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.040
 - Coolidge playing hide and seek.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.440
 So, you know how refrigerators

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.160
 have got this magnetic seal that keeps them closed?

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.000
 - Yeah.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.160
 - Because of hide and seek.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.600
 In 1958, the decade up to 1958,

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.720
 a load of kids have been killed playing hide and seek

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.720
 and hidden inside refrigerators.

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.680
 And so, the new law was brought in saying

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.920
 that they had to be capable of being opened

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.880
 with a 15 pound push from inside.

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:33.080
 And as soon as that law came in,

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:35.240
 they had to come up with a way of making sure

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.920
 they stayed closed, but we're able to be open

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:38.760
 from the inside.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:39.600
 - And that shouldn't mind.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.480
 - Should a kid push, because previous to that,

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:42.840
 would it lock and then--

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.040
 - Well, they used to have latches on them.

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:45.960
 - So the kid would be stuck inside.

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:46.800
 - Yeah.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:47.640
 - Okay.

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:50.200
 - That's interesting, because I only found out recently

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.400
 that in back to the future, the time machine

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.520
 was originally supposed to be a fridge.

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.800
 And the reason it was changed was because of a fear

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.240
 that kids would start trying to imitate them

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.120
 and locking themselves in fridges.

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:01.960
 - Oh.

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:02.800
 - Yeah.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:03.800
 - Should we wrap up on this one or this one?

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:04.800
 - No, go, go, go, go, it.

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.480
 - I was just looking at things,

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:08.440
 well, hobbies of presidents, which quite good

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:09.640
 and related to hide and seek.

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:13.240
 So, Woodrow Wilson made his secret service staff,

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:16.040
 paint his golf balls black and wintered, didn't he,

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:18.120
 so that he could still see them in the snow.

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.320
 But, in more humorous news,

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:22.440
 one of Einstein's favorite hobbies was sailing,

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:25.120
 and he loved to sail even though he couldn't swim

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.880
 and refuse to wear a life jacket.

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.360
 And, at one point in his life,

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.160
 he had to be pulled from the water by a teenager

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:31.520
 who heard him crying out for help

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.120
 and pulled Einstein out of the water.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:34.120
 And the teenager just disappeared,

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.480
 so no one knows who that teenager was,

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:38.480
 but Einstein's life saved by a teenager.

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.080
 But, bizarrely, this year,

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.640
 there's a fish called Einstein in black pool,

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:43.800
 and it got a bladder infection,

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:45.280
 which meant that it stopped being able to swim

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:46.680
 and just sank to the bottom.

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:48.520
 And so, the guy in black pool has designed

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:49.960
 a tiny fish life jacket,

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:51.960
 which the fish now uses to swim in.

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.200
 So, unlike Einstein,

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:57.080
 this poor Einstein fish has been forced into a life jacket

00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:58.560
 and given the chance to swim again.

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.400
 I just think that's a really weird mirroring

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.280
 of the real Einstein's life.

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:04.840
 (upbeat music)

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:06.640
 - Okay, time for fact number two.

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:07.600
 And that's my facts.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:10.120
 My fact this week is that until 2011,

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:13.360
 the sun was only in theory a sphere,

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.520
 but it's now confirmed to be a sphere.

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:16.920
 - Oh yeah, how have you confirmed that?

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:17.920
 - NASA confirmed it.

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:18.760
 - Oh, did they?

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:19.600
 - Yes.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:20.440
 - How did they do that?

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:21.280
 - So, NASA, basically,

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:22.320
 and this was a headline that appeared

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:26.520
 on NASA's official website on February the 6th, 2011.

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:29.520
 It said, "It's official, the sun is a sphere."

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:32.480
 And the idea was that NASA had two twin stereo probes.

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:33.640
 They were called stereo,

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:35.640
 and they went to either side of the sun

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:37.360
 and took the first 3D photo.

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.400
 Basically, they got to the dark side of the sun,

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:40.240
 as it were.

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:41.640
 They got to the side that we never see.

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:43.840
 - Yeah, it's not dark as such, though.

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:47.480
 - But just in terms of a badly chosen words,

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:49.040
 it's the dark side of the sun.

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:50.400
 - That would have been amazing if they got to the other side

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:51.880
 and it turned out to be dark.

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:52.880
 - Yeah, it would be amazing.

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:55.040
 Or flat, or hologram, something awesome.

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:56.160
 But anyway, I just find that amazing.

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.600
 I find that we've gone all this time

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:00.840
 and just assuming that scientists agree that it's a sphere.

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.360
 And it's probably a bit tongue in cheek,

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:06.200
 but I just like that is how far scientists do actually go.

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:07.040
 - Might not be.

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:07.880
 - Might not be.

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:08.720
 - That's what they say.

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.840
 - It is amazingly spherical, the sun.

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:12.560
 - Yeah, they don't understand why this is the case.

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:14.080
 It was discovered only in 2012.

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:17.240
 It's the most perfect sphere in nature by quite a long way.

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:19.360
 And I think it's the second most perfect sphere

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.240
 in the universe that we know of.

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:22.720
 - What's the first?

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:24.720
 - The first are the silicon balls

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:27.120
 that have been used as a replacement for the kilogram.

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:29.320
 So one incredible thing is that if you scale the sun

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:30.760
 to the size of a beach ball,

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:32.040
 it's bold, the biggest dip in it

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:34.120
 would be less than the width of a human hair.

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:36.720
 But even so, the biggest dip on the sun.

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:39.880
 So the biggest difference between it's smallest diameter

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:41.840
 and it's biggest is 10 kilometers.

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:43.880
 And if my mass is right,

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:45.520
 if you blew up this perfect sphere

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:48.000
 that we've created to the size of the sun,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.360
 then the biggest dip in it would be about 120 centimeters.

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:56.280
 - I know you always wanted to have a Guinness Book of Record done.

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:57.120
 - Yes.

00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:59.960
 - One that you can't have is the record

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:02.880
 for longest time spent staring at the sun,

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.920
 because the Guinness Book of Records specifically

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:07.040
 refuses to accept entries for that one.

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:07.880
 - Ah.

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:08.960
 - Why, because it's too dangerous?

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:10.680
 - Because it's too dangerous.

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:13.160
 Isaac Newton used to do experiments

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:16.160
 where he would look at the sun for as long as possible.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:18.080
 And he did it one time for so long

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.640
 that he had to shut himself up in a darkened room

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:21.840
 and wait for his sight to return.

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:24.360
 And it took three days for his sight to return.

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:26.320
 - Not so smart, he's scientist.

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:27.520
 Not so smart.

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:30.400
 - In 1999, when there was no clips,

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.440
 a lot of people were looking at the sun then.

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:35.720
 And when people obviously damaged their eyesight

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:37.560
 and they went to a hospital afterwards,

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:40.120
 the doctors could tell exactly when they looked at the sun

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:43.480
 by looking at the impression on the retinas.

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:46.000
 So it was like a halfway through the eclipse,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.760
 it would have the half sickle of the sun.

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:48.760
 - Wow.

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:50.080
 - That's so cool.

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:50.920
 - That's extraordinary.

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:52.560
 - Although I don't know how anyone's eyes got damaged then,

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:54.720
 because I remember it and it was so cloudy.

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:58.240
 - So the original fact that we had here was how we didn't know

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:00.800
 for sure that the sun was a sphere.

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:03.320
 But people were pretty certain about it.

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:06.800
 So Galileo, for instance, he could see the sunspots

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:08.680
 going round the back and coming back again.

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:10.640
 And so he postulated that it must be a sphere.

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:13.800
 And there are lots of other reasons why we were pretty certain

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:15.720
 it was a sphere.

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:17.080
 But not 100%.

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:18.000
 - Yes, exactly.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.280
 - I wrote a headline, which you guys are gonna hate.

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:23.120
 - But.

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:24.640
 - So the people listening to this podcast,

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:26.440
 they must hear Dan about to say something

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:28.960
 and then those are all groaning and wonder why we do it.

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:31.600
 And it's, you know what, it's the luck on his face.

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:33.920
 As soon as he's about to say something ridiculous,

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:35.400
 he has this luck as if to say,

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:38.440
 "I'm a naughty boy, you guys are all good, shout out me."

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:39.280
 Anyway, go on.

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:43.480
 - Okay, so the world almost ended in 2012.

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:46.520
 But we survived by a week.

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:47.520
 This is what happened.

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:52.520
 The sun had a ginormous solar flare in 2012 around July.

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:56.080
 And it shot out into one particular bit of space.

00:11:56.080 --> 00:12:00.920
 We were a week away from the end of the path of where it went out to.

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:02.880
 And scientists have said that if we were in the path,

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:04.200
 if we were a week ahead in time,

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:07.000
 or if it happened a week later and we were in that path,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.160
 the size of the solar flare

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:11.840
 would have knocked us basically back to the dark ages.

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:14.200
 It was literally, we were that close to destruction.

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:15.600
 - What, and if we'd just been a bit further ahead

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:17.000
 in our rotation around the sun?

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.320
 - Yes, we would have been in its path.

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:20.560
 So it's just, we just happened to not be in its path.

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:21.400
 - Wow.

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:22.400
 - I am slightly terrified of the sun

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:25.120
 because there is this massive risk of coronal mass ejections

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:27.000
 just wiping out all technology on the planet,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.600
 which is just horrible at it.

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:31.560
 There was a massive solar storm in 1859,

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:35.920
 which is the storm that has had the biggest effect on Earth,

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:37.360
 since records began on this.

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:41.160
 And the biggest piece of technological infrastructure

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:43.360
 that existed at that point was the telegraph network.

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:46.640
 And it basically, all across Europe and US,

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:47.680
 it basically shut down.

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:49.280
 Everyone unplugged their machines,

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:51.080
 but there were sparks flying off all the pylons.

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:53.600
 And even if you turned off the transmitters,

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:56.000
 they were still sending and receiving messages.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.160
 And all right, we're seen all over the world.

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:01.360
 And in places like the Rocky Mountains,

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:03.440
 it was so bright that the gold mine

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:05.040
 has actually got up and started making breakfast

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:06.320
 'cause they thought it was daytime.

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:07.160
 - Wow.

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:08.400
 - Wow, really.

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:11.520
 - Yeah, Lloyd's of London, the insurance people.

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:14.680
 In 2013, they did a study using the data

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:18.960
 from 1859 to work out how much it would cost

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:20.000
 if that kind of thing happened today.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.320
 And they estimated that in the US,

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:23.600
 it could cost up to $3 trillion worth of damage,

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:25.160
 even if it was just that strong.

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:26.880
 So it could go so much worse than that.

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:27.720
 - Very scary.

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:28.560
 - Yeah.

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:30.160
 - You were just saying about these guys

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:31.520
 who woke up in the middle of the night

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:33.040
 because they saw the corona.

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:35.760
 - Earlier this week, there was an earthquake in California.

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:38.480
 It was in the Napa Valley where they made wine.

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:41.880
 And enough people around there have these,

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:45.320
 you know, these exercise bands that are attached

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:47.720
 to the internet and it can tell how many steps

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:49.680
 you've done every day and how your heart rates doing

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:50.680
 and such like that.

00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:53.080
 And they could work out who would woken up

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:55.920
 at the same time as this earthquake went off.

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:58.360
 And they found out that more than half of the people

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:00.840
 who woke up during the earthquake stayed up

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:01.600
 for the rest of the night,

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:03.480
 even though it went off at 3 a.m.

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:04.320
 - Oh, really?

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:05.320
 - Yeah, that's a great thing.

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:06.160
 - Yeah, that's a great thing.

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:07.520
 - Just a way that you can take information

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:09.640
 that was for another thing and then work out

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:11.520
 how humans react to something.

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:12.520
 - Yeah.

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:14.400
 - You mentioned California and the sun.

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:17.360
 So, relatedly, there's a big solar plant in California

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:18.960
 and when birds fly over the top of it,

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:21.400
 often they catch fire because the sun's crazy,

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:23.880
 so concentrated, so then they've called them streamers,

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:25.680
 the guys who work there and these birds fly through

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:28.880
 and cat ignites to spontaneously combust mid-flight.

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:29.720
 - Wow.

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:30.560
 - And set on fire.

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:31.400
 It's really sad.

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:32.240
 - Yeah, it's very sad.

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:33.880
 They've got to freak out mid-flight.

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:35.640
 Like, that's never happened before.

00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:36.480
 - Yeah.

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:37.760
 - You're on fire.

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:38.600
 - Oh, thank you.

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:39.800
 No, no, you're on fire.

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:40.640
 - You're on fire.

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:41.640
 - Literally.

00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:43.760
 (upbeat music)

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:45.400
 - Okay, time for fact number three.

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:47.840
 And that is Chazzynstee.

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:50.200
 - Yeah, my, in fact, is that there are some birds nest

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:52.200
 that contain over a hundred rooms

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:54.560
 and are so heavy that they cause trees to fall down.

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:55.400
 - What?

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:56.760
 - Yeah, so these are really cool.

00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:58.760
 This is my new favorite creature, I think,

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:00.600
 the sociable weaver bird,

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:02.280
 which you find in Southern Africa

00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:04.520
 and South Africa, Botswana, places like that.

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:06.400
 And they are really sociable,

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:08.440
 so they build these gigantic nests

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:11.240
 where up to 400 birds will live in one nest

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:13.160
 and they have loads and loads of different chambers.

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:14.520
 And they're incredibly efficient

00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:15.920
 for a bunch of different reasons,

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:18.520
 but they do weigh an enormous amount.

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:19.360
 And so--

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:20.680
 - Trees will collapse.

00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:22.320
 - Yeah, trees are tree-recently collapsed

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:25.920
 under their weight, so they can weigh almost 1,000 kilograms,

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:28.840
 which I think is about as much as 12 adult men.

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:30.760
 So if you stick 12 adult men in a tree,

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:34.080
 it's likely sometimes the branch is gonna break and it did.

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:35.600
 The desert where most of these birds live

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:37.160
 is obviously very hot in the daytime

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:38.440
 and gets very cold at night.

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:41.760
 And it's insulated so that if you go right into the middle

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:43.840
 of this nest where they all roost together,

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:45.600
 then it's much warmer at night,

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:48.000
 like more than 10 degrees warmer than it is in the daytime.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.520
 And then in the daytime, if you hang out

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:50.600
 in the outside chambers,

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:52.920
 it's more than 10 degrees cooler than it is in the daytime

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:54.000
 'cause it's so well-shaded.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:54.840
 - Wow.

00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:56.040
 - Do they have different rooms for different things?

00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:57.520
 Or do they have their own rooms and stuff?

00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:59.040
 - They all-- the pairs have their own rooms,

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:01.760
 so each room will be a pair and sometimes they're offspring

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:04.440
 and then in the center will be where they all sleep together.

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:05.280
 - It's like a hotel.

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:06.600
 - It really is, it's incredible.

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:07.440
 It is like--

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:08.280
 - Wow.

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:09.280
 - And it's not just that.

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:12.520
 - Is it the other birds live in there as well?

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:13.360
 - Yes.

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:14.760
 - I saw a list of some of the other birds

00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:18.240
 who live there, they include the familiar chat.

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:20.520
 (laughing)

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:24.640
 The ashy tit and the rosy faced love bird.

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:25.920
 - Oh.

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:27.480
 But yeah, they do, they let other birds live in them,

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:29.800
 which I think is also great of these guys.

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:31.040
 When they've got a spare room going,

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:31.960
 they say to their mates,

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:34.040
 "Hey, you can be asked to build a nest, don't worry."

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:35.040
 - So they're like a hostel.

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:35.880
 - Yeah.

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:36.720
 - It's like Airbnb.

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:37.560
 - Yeah exactly.

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:38.880
 - Badgers do that as well, don't they?

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:39.720
 - Today.

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:41.640
 - Yeah, 'cause badgers have sort of like a very similar

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:43.040
 to a rabbit hole, but it's,

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:44.720
 'cause rabbits only let rabbits in,

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:46.160
 but badgers are like, if they see a rabbit,

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:47.600
 they'll be like, "Come on in mate, show us."

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:49.040
 Yeah, yeah, and they let them live with them, yeah.

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:51.520
 - Are you sure this isn't a watershed down?

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:55.080
 Or might be windin' the willows of the birds, yeah.

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:57.660
 Badger, they all wear tweed, right?

00:16:57.660 --> 00:16:59.280
 - Prairie dogs, we've done on QI as well,

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:01.800
 quite sensibly, and they're quite similar to these birds,

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:03.000
 and I also like them for it, aren't they?

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.640
 'Cause they have enormous burrows, prairie towns,

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:06.440
 I think they're called.

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:08.320
 So they're smaller than they used to be,

00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:09.480
 'cause they're now more in danger.

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:12.840
 But in 1900, a prairie town was found

00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:15.880
 that took up 25,000 square miles and housed

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:17.720
 400 million prairie dogs.

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:18.880
 But that's how many?

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:19.880
 - 400 million.

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:21.560
 - 400 million.

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:22.840
 (laughing)

00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:24.280
 - Are you hearing the number?

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:25.880
 - That's like the population of America, isn't it?

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:26.720
 - Yeah.

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:27.560
 - So you've got--

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:28.560
 - You've got prairie dogs in America, then, yeah.

00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:30.040
 - That's amazing.

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:31.560
 In one house.

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:33.000
 (laughing)

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.880
 - It's in a book called Prairie Conservation,

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:37.440
 preserving North America's most.

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:39.160
 - Why do they need to go out of service?

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:40.000
 (laughing)

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.000
 - They need to go out of service.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.240
 - They need it in every single house.

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:43.240
 - They're doing good.

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:44.760
 (laughing)

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:46.760
 - But they let other animals live in their homes as well,

00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:48.200
 so you get burrowing out.

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:49.360
 - How is the ready room?

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:50.600
 (laughing)

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:52.000
 - Come on out, squeeze in.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.440
 - Let's go back to Nests.

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:54.280
 - Yeah, sure.

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:55.120
 - That was about Nests.

00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:56.440
 - You were talking about the temperature of the Nests,

00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:57.280
 how it flops you with?

00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:58.120
 - Yes.

00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:00.040
 - I found something great thing about temperature and Nests.

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:02.120
 The sex of an alligator and some other reptiles,

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:03.400
 like lizards and turtles,

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:06.920
 is determined by how warm the nest is that they're laden.

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:10.560
 So for alligators, if the egg is kept in a nest,

00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:13.600
 it turns out female, and if it's 34 degrees,

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:14.520
 it turns out male.

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:15.360
 - Really?

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:16.200
 - Yeah.

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:21.080
 - So in 2009, some researchers found a geofalcon nest

00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:26.080
 in the Arctic, and they did some radio carbon dating on it,

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:30.520
 and they found that it'd been in use for 2,500 years.

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:33.640
 So people have been living there since the Roman era,

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:35.360
 or birds have been living there for the second time.

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:37.160
 (laughing)

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:39.720
 - First just outside and get out of my house.

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:42.360
 - Wow, that's incredible.

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:44.200
 - Yeah, Dan, you've been away at the Edinburgh Festival.

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:45.040
 - Yes.

00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:46.200
 - While you're away, Gregg Jenna came in,

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:48.000
 who was in one of our earlier podcasts.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.280
 He's a historian from Horrible Histories,

00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:53.520
 and we were talking about a human nest.

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:57.280
 It was like a mattress inside a cave somewhere in Africa.

00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:02.040
 So this mattress was in use for 77,000 years.

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:02.880
 - Wow.

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:05.720
 - So many 7,000 years, I imagine how long that is.

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:08.320
 Like 2,000 years was like when Jesus was around.

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:09.480
 - When Jesus was around.

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:11.440
 - It was 77,000 years.

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:12.280
 - Is it still in use?

00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:13.120
 - It's mattress.

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:13.960
 - Oh, no.

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:14.800
 - Okay.

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:16.200
 - I mean, we should keep the tradition going.

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:17.040
 - That's true actually.

00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:18.040
 - Yeah, why do we stop?

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:21.280
 - They used moss, and they would put it in this corner of a cave.

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:24.240
 And then they'd use it for a while, for a while, for a while,

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:27.040
 and then they would burn it and put more moss on top,

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:29.120
 and then they would burn it and put more moss on top.

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:30.480
 And this moss was particularly good,

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:33.320
 because it would stop insects from being able to live there.

00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:34.720
 So it was a really good place to sleep.

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:37.520
 - But also, so you're saying it's the exact same bed,

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:38.360
 effectively?

00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:40.960
 - Because they just kept adding different bits of the mattress on top.

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:42.200
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, wow.

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:43.680
 - And they almost never changed the bedding.

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:44.520
 We did ask about it.

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:46.760
 It was only about every 2,000 years or something

00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:48.960
 that they bothered even changing the moss.

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:53.120
 - Just on the subject of mattresses, I was reminded,

00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:54.960
 there's a trap door at the bottom of the blue whale

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:57.520
 and the natural history is even London.

00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:01.800
 When they opened it up, they discovered a mattress in there.

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:04.600
 And it was basically a time capsule inside the blue whale,

00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:06.080
 because it was when they were building it,

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:08.080
 where all the workmen would sneak in.

00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:10.160
 So they found a bunch of magazines and newspapers

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:13.640
 and empty wrappers, but also a mattress,

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:15.880
 because apparently horny curators,

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:17.880
 that used to be a top location.

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:20.080
 - I can't believe they went to that sort of trouble.

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:20.920
 - Think about it.

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:23.520
 If you're someone who works at the Natural History Museum,

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:25.480
 you're already quite a big dork.

00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:29.560
 And so the idea of sex inside a blue whale, yes please.

00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:32.560
 I mean, even I think that that's the best possible location.

00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:33.320
 - The problem with the mattress.

00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:34.760
 - I don't know why they need a trap door,

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:37.800
 because a blue whale's vagina is large enough to walk through.

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:38.800
 - That's such a good point.

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:39.840
 - Maybe it's a male blue whale.

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:40.680
 - Yeah.

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:41.520
 - Oh, that's probably it.

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:43.840
 - I was just gonna talk really quickly about the weaver birds,

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:46.080
 just because they often now build their nests

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:47.720
 on telegraph poles and pylons.

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:48.920
 So you'd recognize their nests.

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:51.280
 And anyway, this often causes power outages.

00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:53.320
 So I was looking at animals that cause power outages

00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:56.360
 and squirrels are always cutting off electricity.

00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:59.400
 So there are some electricity companies that say that

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:01.640
 two-thirds of their electricity outages

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:03.680
 just come from squirrels chewing through wire

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:06.920
 or like linking up circuits by jumping from one bit to another.

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:09.200
 And they've shut down the Nasdaq twice.

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:13.520
 I think an estimated $20 million worth of shares

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:15.240
 were not traded in that time.

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:16.080
 - $20 million.

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:19.200
 - Okay, guys, numbers can be big.

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:20.200
 Let's get over that.

00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:25.640
 - Time for the final fact of the show, James.

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:29.200
 - Okay, my fact is the worst baseball team in South Korea

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:32.280
 has replaced its supporters with robots.

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:35.320
 So these guys are called the Hanwai Eagles.

00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:38.840
 They've lost more than 400 games in the last five years.

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:41.320
 They came bottom of the league in the last two years

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:43.760
 and their opposition have started calling them

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:46.840
 the Hanwai chickens because they don't put up any kind of fight.

00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:50.280
 What they do is they have these screens around the pitch

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:52.640
 and you can, using your computer or your phone,

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:55.520
 you can put your photo on the screens

00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:57.960
 and you can make the screens do Mexican waves

00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:00.160
 or do cheers or chants or whatever.

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:01.320
 I just think that's quite a--

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:02.160
 - That is cool.

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:04.520
 - That's so sad, isn't it, though?

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:06.400
 - I mean, so the players, and it's the idea

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:08.640
 that the players are supposed to feel rejuvenated

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:10.480
 at the site of automated things

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:13.120
 which are being forced mechanically to cheer them on.

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:15.400
 - Yeah, I think it's solving like that.

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:16.240
 - Yeah.

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:17.400
 - I think it's a bit demoralizing.

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:19.320
 - It's solving the wrong problem.

00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:21.440
 Like it's, the problem is the bad team,

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:24.200
 not that the fans are booing because they suck so much.

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:25.800
 It's like, do you know what we got to solve about this?

00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:27.240
 Our fans, they're the problem.

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:29.600
 - Let's invest all our money in futuristic robots.

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:32.800
 - Let's invest all our money to cheer as we lose

00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:34.280
 again and again and again.

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:36.840
 - Okay, so here's another way of using your fans,

00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:37.880
 maybe a slightly better way.

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:39.480
 You guys don't like the robot thing.

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:40.320
 - I like the robot thing.

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:42.320
 I just think it's not solving an issue.

00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:45.520
 - Well, the Washington Bullets had this superfan

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:47.520
 called Robin Ficker.

00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:50.200
 And what they would do with him is they'd let him sit

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:53.400
 behind the opposing coach's bench

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:55.600
 and they would give him a megaphone

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:57.520
 and he would make fun of the opposing team

00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:59.360
 by shouting at them.

00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:02.480
 So he would make fun of the coach's outfits

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:04.720
 or when the Chicago Bulls came to play,

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:07.000
 he read the sex passages of the Bulls'

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.760
 coach's autobiography.

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:10.840
 - That's him, Jeremy and the game.

00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:13.200
 - Wow, he's distracting.

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:15.800
 - I was looking up robots and death.

00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:18.000
 And I found out that Jeremy Clarkson

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.280
 was really killed by a robot was.

00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:23.080
 Apparently one of the robots was fighting another robot

00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:26.080
 and a circular blade came loose and zoomed across the studio

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:27.600
 and there you had it on film

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:28.800
 and they played it back in slow motion

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:31.240
 and it went across his head two inches above his scalp.

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:32.480
 - Whoa, sorry, yeah.

00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:33.760
 - We actually know who the first person

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:34.760
 would be killed by a robot.

00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:36.200
 And his name was--

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:37.720
 - Robbie Williams. - Robbie Williams.

00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:38.560
 - Yeah.

00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:39.400
 - How was he killed by robot?

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:42.600
 It was in a-- - He was in a calf factory

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:44.760
 or something like that and he was in fog factory

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:47.080
 and he was hit by a protruding arm

00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:48.800
 and he was killed by that.

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:51.000
 - So it was like, 'cause it was an arm,

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.080
 kind of was a robot.

00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:52.920
 - Yeah.

00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:55.160
 - Well, it was a big mechanical device.

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:57.120
 It was for moving car parts from one end

00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:58.200
 to the factory together

00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:00.120
 and it just, he got hit on the head really hard to it.

00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:01.320
 The second guy who got killed by robot,

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:02.680
 definitely got killed by a robot.

00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:05.960
 His name was Kenji Rada and that was two years later

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:08.840
 and he got pushed into a grinding machine by a robot arm.

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:10.080
 - Ooh. - Yeah.

00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:12.200
 - Like was it a malicious intent?

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:13.680
 - So there's never been a malicious intent.

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:15.680
 There is an innate human fear of robots.

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:18.600
 The first use of the word robot was in a plague

00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:20.440
 by Czech playwright Carol Kappett

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:22.240
 called Rosam's Universal Robots

00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:24.400
 and it was about robots trying to take over and kill people.

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:26.520
 - 9% of Americans, when surveyed,

00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:28.880
 admit that they will have sex with a robot.

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:31.200
 - I would have sex with a robot.

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:32.960
 - So was that book called Sex and Robots,

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:35.760
 which it's a guy who's a huge computer scientist

00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:37.960
 and chess champion saying that he thinks

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:39.760
 will have sex with robots within 50 years?

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:40.840
 - Well, he's one of the 9%.

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:42.000
 - Yeah, definitely.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.520
 - They did have the first kissing robots in 2008.

00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:46.640
 They were made in Taiwan

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:49.120
 and they performed as the stars in Phantom of the Opera.

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:52.120
 They did an all robots cast for Phantom of the Opera

00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:53.480
 and these two robots kiss

00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:55.360
 and it's the worst kiss you've ever seen.

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:56.320
 Their heads come together

00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:57.640
 and then they pause for 10 seconds

00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:58.680
 and their heads pull apart.

00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:00.360
 It's like at a 12 year old's disco.

00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:01.560
 - Empathetic robots are a thing

00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:02.680
 that just been experimented with

00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:05.320
 and they've sort of are claiming they've invented

00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:07.240
 where their robots that respond

00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:08.560
 to your own facial expressions

00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:10.360
 with matching facial expressions

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:12.400
 and they're preparing, why are you smiling?

00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:13.640
 - It's really creepily.

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:14.480
 - Sorry.

00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:15.760
 - Okay, I'm gonna start looking at you.

00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:17.880
 So they've come up with empathetic robots now

00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:20.640
 who's faces top of everybody.

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:22.200
 They've come up with empathetic robots

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:24.680
 who's faces mirror the facial expressions that humans have

00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:26.200
 in the hope that they can care

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:28.640
 for lonely humans in future

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:32.520
 but again, a bit like the fake cheering crowds in career.

00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:34.240
 It seems like a sad thing if you need a robot

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:36.520
 to fake empathetic facial expressions

00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:37.600
 in order to feel okay.

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:39.760
 - Our buddy, Leven Skyra,

00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:42.680
 who was on this podcast a few episodes ago,

00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:44.680
 just actually took part in the opposite version

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:45.520
 of what we're talking about,

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:48.000
 which was the World Robot Football Cup.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.000
 - Oh yeah.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.000
 - And he went out to Brazil, I think.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.240
 It was in Brazil. - Yeah, it wasn't Brazilian.

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:56.080
 - And so it was robots playing against each other

00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:58.280
 at football and Leven was saying

00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:00.960
 that they've projected that within 50 years,

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:03.360
 a robot football team will be able to beat

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:04.520
 a human football team.

00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:06.800
 - Within two months they'll be able to beat Man United.

00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:07.800
 (laughing)

00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:09.280
 Did you see, so if you've seen this,

00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:10.120
 - No, I haven't.

00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:12.040
 - So we're recording this on Wednesday,

00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:14.800
 but on Tuesday, Man United played against MK Duns

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:17.560
 who are lower in the third tier of English football

00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:19.120
 and they lost four nil.

00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:19.960
 - Whoa.

00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:21.720
 - And there was a great thing on Twitter.

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:24.360
 There was a girl who'd got a free bet

00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:26.280
 from an online betting site

00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:29.280
 and she put two pound 50 on Man United to win four nil.

00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:32.800
 But it accidentally put two pound 50 on MK Duns

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:35.760
 to win four nil at 500 to one.

00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:36.600
 - Wow.

00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:37.440
 - Wow.

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:39.440
 - And she was like, "Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God,

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:41.120
 "I've won over a thousand pounds."

00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:41.960
 - That's great.

00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:44.080
 - Anyway, let's talk about, oh, we'd like to talk about.

00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:45.600
 - I was gonna talk about sports fans

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:47.840
 since we're on sports now.

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:50.680
 So I was looking at generally sports fans,

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:52.480
 one of them using things I like that's happened

00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:55.040
 in the past is that during baseball matches

00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:56.760
 until about a hundred years ago,

00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:58.760
 'cause the stadium was smaller.

00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:01.040
 If you hit the ball out of the stadium,

00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:02.640
 it would fall into the long grass

00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:04.960
 and the game had to stop for five minutes

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:07.080
 and everyone, the fans and the players

00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:09.520
 had to spend five minutes searching for the ball

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:11.000
 because they wouldn't have lots of spare balls.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.600
 I think now in baseball balls just get lost

00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:14.480
 and that's it, they have, they bring spare.

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:15.560
 - People take them, don't they?

00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:16.400
 - Yeah.

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:17.240
 - What do you get to, if it comes out and you catch it,

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:18.080
 it's your ball.

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:18.920
 - Yeah.

00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:19.760
 - That's how it works.

00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:20.760
 - It's another thing about old baseball games

00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:23.800
 where they didn't have as many umpires in those days.

00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:25.760
 And some of the umpires were allowed to,

00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:27.880
 if they weren't quite sure about a decision,

00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:30.080
 they're allowed to consult the audience,

00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:31.280
 consult the crowd.

00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:32.320
 - I can't want to be a millionaire.

00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:33.320
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:34.840
 And see what the crowd thought

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:37.840
 and then use their ideas if they couldn't really work it out.

00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:41.160
 - 92% of the audience thinks that that was a home run.

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:43.640
 - God, must have sucked when you were playing away games.

00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:44.480
 - Yeah.

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:45.640
 - If you plainly made it and you just missed it,

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:46.480
 did you make it?

00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:47.320
 - No.

00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:48.840
 - Definitely not.

00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:51.040
 - So I think the angriest any sports fans

00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:53.080
 have ever been and James will know about this

00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:54.800
 and it must be during the Heidi game.

00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:56.720
 - Is that the Kevin Courage game?

00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:57.560
 (laughs)

00:27:57.560 --> 00:27:58.560
 - Heidi goes Seeky.

00:27:58.560 --> 00:27:59.400
 - Yeah.

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:01.280
 - I don't think I know about the Heidi game.

00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:02.120
 - It's so good.

00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:04.800
 And it is frequently voted the most exciting game

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:06.200
 for American football of all time.

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:08.400
 It was Oakland Raiders versus New York Jets.

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:09.520
 And it was really close.

00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:11.760
 The New York Jets were just ahead of the Oakland Raiders,

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:13.000
 but it was obviously a really thrilling match.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.800
 It had about three minutes left.

00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:16.480
 And suddenly at the very last minute,

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:18.040
 the Oakland Raiders overtook the New York Jets

00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:19.560
 and they won and it was a massive title

00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:21.000
 and it was a massive deal.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.880
 And NBC, the network that was broadcasting it,

00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:26.920
 as it had overrun by a couple of minutes past its three hours,

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:28.880
 switched over automatically to show Heidi

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:30.680
 for all the kids on the other channel.

00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:32.240
 Now, they didn't want to do this.

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:34.920
 The NBC executive saw that it was a really thrilling match

00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:36.800
 and we're like, we've got to obviously keep this on the airwaves.

00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:38.640
 So they tried to call the studio to say,

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:40.040
 obviously keep the match on, guys.

00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:40.880
 Look at this.

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:41.800
 This is the biggest match ever.

00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:44.840
 But so many people, so many angry fans

00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:46.760
 were trying to call the studio to say,

00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:48.720
 I can't believe you're going to switch over to Heidi.

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:49.560
 It's outrageous.

00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:50.840
 I want to watch the rest of the match.

00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:53.000
 That their phone lines broke down and the executives

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.760
 couldn't get through to the studio to say, keep it on.

00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:59.160
 So in the great irony of fan complaints,

00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:02.000
 they caused Heidi to overtake the match

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.680
 by calling breaking the phone lines and Heidi came on.

00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:07.200
 And then NBC managed to irritate people further,

00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:10.200
 I think, by during this episode of Heidi,

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:11.920
 there was a really touching scene

00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:15.600
 where Heidi's disabled sister, I think, learns to walk

00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:17.200
 and they thought, what can we do to remedy this?

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:18.760
 So they flashed up the score suddenly

00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:21.280
 for the fans in the middle of high school.

00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:25.600
 All these little kids suddenly tearing up at this scene.

00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:28.600
 And they say it sounds like an homestay to Fergie, bro.

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:32.080
 My favorite baseball player, just before we finish,

00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:35.280
 is Joe Sprintz, OK?

00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:39.320
 And one of his rivals, another baseball catcher,

00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:41.240
 had caught a ball that had been dropped

00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:42.760
 from the top of a building.

00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:45.960
 And he got a world record for the highest catch

00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:47.720
 from a high point.

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:50.600
 So he decided that he wanted to beat this record.

00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:55.240
 And so he got a friend to go up into a blimp.

00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:56.560
 And someone was going to drop the ball

00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:58.520
 from the top of this hot air balloon.

00:29:58.520 --> 00:29:59.720
 And he was going to catch it.

00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:00.400
 Oh, my God.

00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:01.200
 OK.

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:03.360
 He caught it in the way that baseball players do

00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:05.920
 with his mitt directly above his face.

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:07.360
 The ball hit his mitt.

00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:08.720
 The mitt hit his face.

00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:12.560
 And he fractured his jaw and lost five teeth.

00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:14.600
 And apparently, he dropped the ball.

00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:16.040
 Oh!

00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:18.560
 And someone alongside him just went, "Stop hitting yourself!"

00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:20.400
 "Stop hitting yourself!"

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:24.080
 OK, that's it for this episode.

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:24.920
