00:00:00,00:00:01,- We run it on QI a few years ago.
00:00:01,00:00:02,- Yeah.
00:00:02,00:00:04,"- Which was, there's no such thing as a fish."
00:00:04,00:00:05,- And it's not such thing as a fish.
00:00:05,00:00:08,"- No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary"
00:00:08,00:00:10,of Underwater Life.
00:00:10,00:00:11,"It says it right now, first paragraph."
00:00:11,00:00:12,No such thing as a fish.
00:00:12,00:00:15,(upbeat music)
00:00:15,00:00:21,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:00:21,00:00:24,"of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast"
00:00:24,00:00:26,coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.
00:00:26,00:00:27,My name is Dan Triber.
00:00:27,00:00:29,"I'm sitting here with three other elves,"
00:00:29,00:00:32,"James Harkin, Alex Bell, and Anichezinski."
00:00:32,00:00:34,"And once again, we've gathered around the microphone"
00:00:34,00:00:36,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.
00:00:36,00:00:38,"And here we go, in no particular order."
00:00:38,00:00:39,Here they are.
00:00:39,00:00:41,(upbeat music)
00:00:41,00:00:42,"Okay, back number one, Alex."
00:00:42,00:00:45,"- Okay, when he was bored, Calvin Coolidge"
00:00:45,00:00:47,used to ring a bell to summon his bodyguards
00:00:47,00:00:50,and then hide from them under the oval office desk.
00:00:50,00:00:51,(laughing)
00:00:51,00:00:52,- Really?
00:00:52,00:00:53,- Yep.
00:00:53,00:00:54,- Just as a joke.
00:00:54,00:00:57,"But I mean, presumably after the first time you've done that."
00:00:57,00:00:59,Or did they have to be like parents?
00:00:59,00:01:00,- It's too bad.
00:01:00,00:01:00,- It's too bad for your child.
00:01:00,00:01:02,"- Oh, where does it be?"
00:01:02,00:01:03,Oh no!
00:01:03,00:01:03,- Probably.
00:01:03,00:01:05,"- Yeah, I wouldn't have much trust in them"
00:01:05,00:01:08,if they were continually fooled by it every time.
00:01:08,00:01:08,- That would be the worst of it.
00:01:08,00:01:10,- You would fire your secret service straight away.
00:01:10,00:01:13,"You'd be like, seriously, this is the second time you're done."
00:01:13,00:01:14,- Yeah.
00:01:14,00:01:16,"- Well, actually speaking of firing people and hiding,"
00:01:16,00:01:18,I found a completely sort of slightly related fact
00:01:18,00:01:19,"as well, secondary fact."
00:01:19,00:01:22,- Herbert Hoover had a really strict privacy policy
00:01:22,00:01:26,"to the point where whenever he or his wife were on the approach,"
00:01:26,00:01:28,the White House staff would signal to each other
00:01:28,00:01:30,using the bell system in the White House
00:01:30,00:01:33,and then hide in a cupboard or behind bushes
00:01:33,00:01:34,"or something like that,"
00:01:34,00:01:36,because he hated seeing his stuff
00:01:36,00:01:38,and really liked his privacy.
00:01:38,00:01:40,And they risked being fired if they were seen.
00:01:40,00:01:42,"So anytime he came into a room,"
00:01:42,00:01:43,they would sort of have to scramble around
00:01:43,00:01:44,and try and hide somewhere.
00:01:44,00:01:45,They also used to doing this
00:01:45,00:01:47,"that when Harry Truman took over the presidency,"
00:01:47,00:01:48,"moved into the White House, yes."
00:01:48,00:01:50,"- He was like, ""Where are all my stuff?"""
00:01:50,00:01:54,"Herbert Hoover invented Hoover Ball, didn't he?"
00:01:54,00:01:55,Which was--
00:01:55,00:01:57,- Is it as soon as he gets the ball
00:01:57,00:01:58,or the other player's hide and cover it?
00:01:58,00:02:00,So he just gets the ball right to the ball line?
00:02:00,00:02:01,- Yeah.
00:02:01,00:02:02,"- Even hides under a desk, yes."
00:02:02,00:02:03,- This is when we find them.
00:02:03,00:02:05,- That's Cool Ridge Ball.
00:02:05,00:02:07,"- No, it was actually invented by his doctor to keep him fit."
00:02:07,00:02:10,"And it's a cross between according to the government website,"
00:02:10,00:02:13,"tennis, volleyball, and medicine ball."
00:02:13,00:02:14,Which do you guys know what that is?
00:02:14,00:02:15,"- Medicine ball, yeah."
00:02:15,00:02:17,It's a big ball that you use for exercise.
00:02:17,00:02:18,- Yeah. - That big and everything.
00:02:18,00:02:20,So it's basically like volleyball
00:02:20,00:02:22,with a unbelievably heavy ball about the weight
00:02:22,00:02:23,of a newborn baby
00:02:23,00:02:25,and you throw it over the net.
00:02:25,00:02:27,Calvin Coolidge liked to eat breakfast in bed
00:02:27,00:02:29,while having his head rubbed with Vaseline.
00:02:29,00:02:32,- Was he bald?
00:02:32,00:02:34,'Cause that is a recipe for greasy hair.
00:02:34,00:02:34,"- No, no, that's really bad."
00:02:34,00:02:36,- You know the guy who invented Vaseline?
00:02:36,00:02:38,"He was, I forgot his name,"
00:02:38,00:02:41,cheeseburger or something like that.
00:02:41,00:02:44,He thought that Vaseline was like a big sort of cure all
00:02:44,00:02:45,and he used to eat it every single day
00:02:45,00:02:48,and he used to rub it on his body all the time
00:02:48,00:02:50,'cause he thought it would cure him of all illness.
00:02:50,00:02:52,- And did it?
00:02:52,00:02:53,"- Well, he's dead."
00:02:53,00:02:54,- Okay.
00:02:54,00:02:55,So it didn't make him live forever.
00:02:55,00:02:57,"- Yeah, okay, so it wasn't an elixir."
00:02:57,00:02:59,I can understand why he does that.
00:02:59,00:03:03,I once went on a date and I couldn't find any hair gel
00:03:03,00:03:05,and my hair was really all over the shop.
00:03:05,00:03:06,"- If this is something about Mary's story,"
00:03:06,00:03:09,can I stop you there?
00:03:09,00:03:11,- I put tiger balm in my hair
00:03:11,00:03:14,"and my god, that was the most intense sensation"
00:03:14,00:03:15,I've ever had.
00:03:15,00:03:17,It was like putting chilies all over my head.
00:03:17,00:03:19,It was just like on fire
00:03:19,00:03:22,and my head stunk like hell.
00:03:22,00:03:24,"I got in the train and everyone was like,"
00:03:24,00:03:25,what is that?
00:03:25,00:03:26,- Was that a successful date?
00:03:26,00:03:28,"- It was 'cause in the end, I had to admit it."
00:03:28,00:03:31,"I was like, by the way, the reason my head smells like this"
00:03:31,00:03:33,is because I did tiger balm over my head
00:03:33,00:03:35,"and she said, I really like smell."
00:03:35,00:03:37,"- It is quite a nice smell and if you have a cold,"
00:03:37,00:03:38,it's quite so maybe if she was a bit blocked up.
00:03:38,00:03:39,- Exactly.
00:03:39,00:03:40,- You would have really helped her out.
00:03:40,00:03:42,"- Exactly, my sinuses were, I can credit all that."
00:03:42,00:03:44,"My point is though, is that maybe the Vaseline on his head"
00:03:44,00:03:46,while he's eating kind of gives a slight kind of
00:03:46,00:03:47,like putting Tabasco on your face?
00:03:47,00:03:50,- Maybe that's how he managed to get Mrs. Coolidge.
00:03:50,00:03:51,"She was like, oh really?"
00:03:51,00:03:52,"- Yeah, it was a smell of Vaseline."
00:03:52,00:03:54,- Have you thought of tiger balm?
00:03:54,00:03:56,- There is a thing called the Coolidge effect.
00:03:56,00:03:57,Do you know that?
00:03:57,00:03:58,- No.
00:03:58,00:04:00,- The idea is that male animals prefer to have sex
00:04:00,00:04:01,with females they've never seen before
00:04:01,00:04:03,than females that they have seen before
00:04:03,00:04:04,and it's called the Coolidge effects
00:04:04,00:04:06,and it's named after Calvin Coolidge.
00:04:06,00:04:07,- Why?
00:04:07,00:04:11,- It's a story about him and his wife
00:04:11,00:04:13,who were being shown around the farm
00:04:13,00:04:15,and they got to a chicken yard
00:04:15,00:04:18,and Mrs. Coolidge noticed that the male chicken
00:04:18,00:04:21,"was having sex a lot and she said to the guy,"
00:04:21,00:04:22,does he do that a lot?
00:04:22,00:04:25,"And he said, oh yeah, he has sex about 12 times a day"
00:04:25,00:04:27,"and she goes, well, you should tell that to my husband."
00:04:27,00:04:29,So then the guy went to Calvin Coolidge
00:04:29,00:04:32,"and he said, oh, this chicken has sex 12 times a day"
00:04:32,00:04:34,and your wife told me to tell you about it
00:04:34,00:04:35,"and he said, oh, is it the same chicken every time"
00:04:35,00:04:36,that you have sex with?
00:04:36,00:04:39,"And this guy said, no, it's a different chicken every time"
00:04:39,00:04:40,"and said, well, tell that to my wife then."
00:04:40,00:04:43,- Just a chicken farm and named it then.
00:04:43,00:04:44,- It was named after that anecdote
00:04:44,00:04:46,which I guess probably didn't even happen.
00:04:46,00:04:46,- Yeah.
00:04:46,00:04:47,"- But just to make this clear,"
00:04:47,00:04:48,that is a really cruel thing he said.
00:04:48,00:04:50,So he did basically say the only reason
00:04:50,00:04:52,he wants to keep having sex is 'cause it's not
00:04:52,00:04:53,with my wife every time.
00:04:53,00:04:56,"He's saying, if I was to have sex 12 times a day,"
00:04:56,00:04:57,it wouldn't be with you.
00:04:57,00:04:58,- Yeah.
00:04:58,00:05:00,"- To be fair, is a pretty soggy move on her part."
00:05:00,00:05:00,- That was the way it goes.
00:05:00,00:05:03,- No one comes across well in that anecdote at all
00:05:03,00:05:04,apart from the chicken.
00:05:04,00:05:06,(laughing)
00:05:06,00:05:08,"- Do you know, I only found something the other day,"
00:05:08,00:05:11,a weird number of presidents of one Grammy Awards
00:05:11,00:05:13,for spoken word albums.
00:05:13,00:05:14,- Really?
00:05:14,00:05:15,- So I stumbled upon this 'cause Hillary Clinton
00:05:15,00:05:17,did a spoken word album which was
00:05:17,00:05:19,"some kind of, you know,"
00:05:19,00:05:22,telling us how we should live better album in the '90s.
00:05:22,00:05:25,Obama's won two Grammys for spoken words.
00:05:25,00:05:26,"- Oh, really spoken words."
00:05:26,00:05:27,"- Oh, they are well spoken."
00:05:27,00:05:28,- Yeah.
00:05:28,00:05:30,(laughing)
00:05:30,00:05:30,- True.
00:05:30,00:05:33,"- Clinton's got won, both the Clinton's got won Jimmy Carter."
00:05:33,00:05:34,- To be a president.
00:05:34,00:05:36,"- You have to be well spoken though, don't you?"
00:05:36,00:05:38,"You have to be good at doing speeches, so."
00:05:38,00:05:38,- Yeah.
00:05:38,00:05:39,- Not that surprised me.
00:05:39,00:05:40,- It makes total sense.
00:05:40,00:05:41,- Yeah.
00:05:41,00:05:42,- I wonder who didn't get one.
00:05:42,00:05:44,"- Well, George Bush certainly didn't."
00:05:44,00:05:45,- Did he not?
00:05:45,00:05:46,- Yet.
00:05:46,00:05:50,"- So, is there any night just full of presidents,"
00:05:50,00:05:52,just waiting the best spoken word?
00:05:52,00:05:53,"We've got Clinton, Obama."
00:05:53,00:05:55,- I think the presidents are the only ones
00:05:55,00:05:57,who are asked to make audio tapes.
00:05:57,00:06:00,"- It would be like, the winner is Calvin Coolidge."
00:06:00,00:06:02,Has anyone seen Calvin Coolidge?
00:06:02,00:06:04,(laughing)
00:06:04,00:06:06,- I want to talk about hide and seek
00:06:06,00:06:07,'cause we were talking about hide and seek.
00:06:07,00:06:08,"- Oh yeah, yeah."
00:06:08,00:06:10,- Coolidge playing hide and seek.
00:06:10,00:06:12,"So, you know how refrigerators"
00:06:12,00:06:15,have got this magnetic seal that keeps them closed?
00:06:15,00:06:16,- Yeah.
00:06:16,00:06:17,- Because of hide and seek.
00:06:17,00:06:20,"In 1958, the decade up to 1958,"
00:06:20,00:06:22,a load of kids have been killed playing hide and seek
00:06:22,00:06:24,and hidden inside refrigerators.
00:06:24,00:06:26,"And so, the new law was brought in saying"
00:06:26,00:06:28,that they had to be capable of being opened
00:06:28,00:06:31,with a 15 pound push from inside.
00:06:31,00:06:33,"And as soon as that law came in,"
00:06:33,00:06:35,they had to come up with a way of making sure
00:06:35,00:06:37,"they stayed closed, but we're able to be open"
00:06:37,00:06:38,from the inside.
00:06:38,00:06:39,- And that shouldn't mind.
00:06:39,00:06:41,"- Should a kid push, because previous to that,"
00:06:41,00:06:42,would it lock and then--
00:06:42,00:06:44,"- Well, they used to have latches on them."
00:06:44,00:06:45,- So the kid would be stuck inside.
00:06:45,00:06:46,- Yeah.
00:06:46,00:06:47,- Okay.
00:06:47,00:06:50,"- That's interesting, because I only found out recently"
00:06:50,00:06:53,"that in back to the future, the time machine"
00:06:53,00:06:55,was originally supposed to be a fridge.
00:06:55,00:06:57,And the reason it was changed was because of a fear
00:06:57,00:06:59,that kids would start trying to imitate them
00:06:59,00:07:01,and locking themselves in fridges.
00:07:01,00:07:01,- Oh.
00:07:01,00:07:02,- Yeah.
00:07:02,00:07:03,- Should we wrap up on this one or this one?
00:07:03,00:07:04,"- No, go, go, go, go, it."
00:07:04,00:07:06,"- I was just looking at things,"
00:07:06,00:07:08,"well, hobbies of presidents, which quite good"
00:07:08,00:07:09,and related to hide and seek.
00:07:09,00:07:13,"So, Woodrow Wilson made his secret service staff,"
00:07:13,00:07:16,"paint his golf balls black and wintered, didn't he,"
00:07:16,00:07:18,so that he could still see them in the snow.
00:07:18,00:07:20,"But, in more humorous news,"
00:07:20,00:07:22,"one of Einstein's favorite hobbies was sailing,"
00:07:22,00:07:25,and he loved to sail even though he couldn't swim
00:07:25,00:07:26,and refuse to wear a life jacket.
00:07:26,00:07:28,"And, at one point in his life,"
00:07:28,00:07:30,he had to be pulled from the water by a teenager
00:07:30,00:07:31,who heard him crying out for help
00:07:31,00:07:33,and pulled Einstein out of the water.
00:07:33,00:07:34,"And the teenager just disappeared,"
00:07:34,00:07:35,"so no one knows who that teenager was,"
00:07:35,00:07:38,but Einstein's life saved by a teenager.
00:07:38,00:07:40,"But, bizarrely, this year,"
00:07:40,00:07:42,"there's a fish called Einstein in black pool,"
00:07:42,00:07:43,"and it got a bladder infection,"
00:07:43,00:07:45,which meant that it stopped being able to swim
00:07:45,00:07:46,and just sank to the bottom.
00:07:46,00:07:48,"And so, the guy in black pool has designed"
00:07:48,00:07:49,"a tiny fish life jacket,"
00:07:49,00:07:51,which the fish now uses to swim in.
00:07:51,00:07:54,"So, unlike Einstein,"
00:07:54,00:07:57,this poor Einstein fish has been forced into a life jacket
00:07:57,00:07:58,and given the chance to swim again.
00:07:58,00:08:00,I just think that's a really weird mirroring
00:08:00,00:08:02,of the real Einstein's life.
00:08:02,00:08:04,(upbeat music)
00:08:04,00:08:06,"- Okay, time for fact number two."
00:08:06,00:08:07,And that's my facts.
00:08:07,00:08:10,"My fact this week is that until 2011,"
00:08:10,00:08:13,"the sun was only in theory a sphere,"
00:08:13,00:08:15,but it's now confirmed to be a sphere.
00:08:15,00:08:16,"- Oh yeah, how have you confirmed that?"
00:08:16,00:08:17,- NASA confirmed it.
00:08:17,00:08:18,"- Oh, did they?"
00:08:18,00:08:19,- Yes.
00:08:19,00:08:20,- How did they do that?
00:08:20,00:08:21,"- So, NASA, basically,"
00:08:21,00:08:22,and this was a headline that appeared
00:08:22,00:08:26,"on NASA's official website on February the 6th, 2011."
00:08:26,00:08:29,"It said, ""It's official, the sun is a sphere."""
00:08:29,00:08:32,And the idea was that NASA had two twin stereo probes.
00:08:32,00:08:33,"They were called stereo,"
00:08:33,00:08:35,and they went to either side of the sun
00:08:35,00:08:37,and took the first 3D photo.
00:08:37,00:08:39,"Basically, they got to the dark side of the sun,"
00:08:39,00:08:40,as it were.
00:08:40,00:08:41,They got to the side that we never see.
00:08:41,00:08:43,"- Yeah, it's not dark as such, though."
00:08:43,00:08:47,"- But just in terms of a badly chosen words,"
00:08:47,00:08:49,it's the dark side of the sun.
00:08:49,00:08:50,- That would have been amazing if they got to the other side
00:08:50,00:08:51,and it turned out to be dark.
00:08:51,00:08:52,"- Yeah, it would be amazing."
00:08:52,00:08:55,"Or flat, or hologram, something awesome."
00:08:55,00:08:56,"But anyway, I just find that amazing."
00:08:56,00:08:57,I find that we've gone all this time
00:08:57,00:09:00,and just assuming that scientists agree that it's a sphere.
00:09:00,00:09:02,"And it's probably a bit tongue in cheek,"
00:09:02,00:09:06,but I just like that is how far scientists do actually go.
00:09:06,00:09:07,- Might not be.
00:09:07,00:09:07,- Might not be.
00:09:07,00:09:08,- That's what they say.
00:09:08,00:09:10,"- It is amazingly spherical, the sun."
00:09:10,00:09:12,"- Yeah, they don't understand why this is the case."
00:09:12,00:09:14,It was discovered only in 2012.
00:09:14,00:09:17,It's the most perfect sphere in nature by quite a long way.
00:09:17,00:09:19,And I think it's the second most perfect sphere
00:09:19,00:09:21,in the universe that we know of.
00:09:21,00:09:22,- What's the first?
00:09:22,00:09:24,- The first are the silicon balls
00:09:24,00:09:27,that have been used as a replacement for the kilogram.
00:09:27,00:09:29,So one incredible thing is that if you scale the sun
00:09:29,00:09:30,"to the size of a beach ball,"
00:09:30,00:09:32,"it's bold, the biggest dip in it"
00:09:32,00:09:34,would be less than the width of a human hair.
00:09:34,00:09:36,"But even so, the biggest dip on the sun."
00:09:36,00:09:39,So the biggest difference between it's smallest diameter
00:09:39,00:09:41,and it's biggest is 10 kilometers.
00:09:41,00:09:43,"And if my mass is right,"
00:09:43,00:09:45,if you blew up this perfect sphere
00:09:45,00:09:48,"that we've created to the size of the sun,"
00:09:48,00:09:52,then the biggest dip in it would be about 120 centimeters.
00:09:52,00:09:56,- I know you always wanted to have a Guinness Book of Record done.
00:09:56,00:09:57,- Yes.
00:09:57,00:09:59,- One that you can't have is the record
00:09:59,00:10:02,"for longest time spent staring at the sun,"
00:10:02,00:10:04,because the Guinness Book of Records specifically
00:10:04,00:10:07,refuses to accept entries for that one.
00:10:07,00:10:07,- Ah.
00:10:07,00:10:08,"- Why, because it's too dangerous?"
00:10:08,00:10:10,- Because it's too dangerous.
00:10:10,00:10:13,Isaac Newton used to do experiments
00:10:13,00:10:16,where he would look at the sun for as long as possible.
00:10:16,00:10:18,And he did it one time for so long
00:10:18,00:10:20,that he had to shut himself up in a darkened room
00:10:20,00:10:21,and wait for his sight to return.
00:10:21,00:10:24,And it took three days for his sight to return.
00:10:24,00:10:26,"- Not so smart, he's scientist."
00:10:26,00:10:27,Not so smart.
00:10:27,00:10:30,"- In 1999, when there was no clips,"
00:10:30,00:10:32,a lot of people were looking at the sun then.
00:10:32,00:10:35,And when people obviously damaged their eyesight
00:10:35,00:10:37,"and they went to a hospital afterwards,"
00:10:37,00:10:40,the doctors could tell exactly when they looked at the sun
00:10:40,00:10:43,by looking at the impression on the retinas.
00:10:43,00:10:46,"So it was like a halfway through the eclipse,"
00:10:46,00:10:47,it would have the half sickle of the sun.
00:10:47,00:10:48,- Wow.
00:10:48,00:10:50,- That's so cool.
00:10:50,00:10:50,- That's extraordinary.
00:10:50,00:10:52,"- Although I don't know how anyone's eyes got damaged then,"
00:10:52,00:10:54,because I remember it and it was so cloudy.
00:10:54,00:10:58,- So the original fact that we had here was how we didn't know
00:10:58,00:11:00,for sure that the sun was a sphere.
00:11:00,00:11:03,But people were pretty certain about it.
00:11:03,00:11:06,"So Galileo, for instance, he could see the sunspots"
00:11:06,00:11:08,going round the back and coming back again.
00:11:08,00:11:10,And so he postulated that it must be a sphere.
00:11:10,00:11:13,And there are lots of other reasons why we were pretty certain
00:11:13,00:11:15,it was a sphere.
00:11:15,00:11:17,But not 100%.
00:11:17,00:11:18,"- Yes, exactly."
00:11:18,00:11:22,"- I wrote a headline, which you guys are gonna hate."
00:11:22,00:11:23,- But.
00:11:23,00:11:24,"- So the people listening to this podcast,"
00:11:24,00:11:26,they must hear Dan about to say something
00:11:26,00:11:28,and then those are all groaning and wonder why we do it.
00:11:28,00:11:31,"And it's, you know what, it's the luck on his face."
00:11:31,00:11:33,"As soon as he's about to say something ridiculous,"
00:11:33,00:11:35,"he has this luck as if to say,"
00:11:35,00:11:38,"""I'm a naughty boy, you guys are all good, shout out me."""
00:11:38,00:11:39,"Anyway, go on."
00:11:39,00:11:43,"- Okay, so the world almost ended in 2012."
00:11:43,00:11:46,But we survived by a week.
00:11:46,00:11:47,This is what happened.
00:11:47,00:11:52,The sun had a ginormous solar flare in 2012 around July.
00:11:52,00:11:56,And it shot out into one particular bit of space.
00:11:56,00:12:00,We were a week away from the end of the path of where it went out to.
00:12:00,00:12:02,"And scientists have said that if we were in the path,"
00:12:02,00:12:04,"if we were a week ahead in time,"
00:12:04,00:12:07,"or if it happened a week later and we were in that path,"
00:12:07,00:12:09,the size of the solar flare
00:12:09,00:12:11,would have knocked us basically back to the dark ages.
00:12:11,00:12:14,"It was literally, we were that close to destruction."
00:12:14,00:12:15,"- What, and if we'd just been a bit further ahead"
00:12:15,00:12:17,in our rotation around the sun?
00:12:17,00:12:18,"- Yes, we would have been in its path."
00:12:18,00:12:20,"So it's just, we just happened to not be in its path."
00:12:20,00:12:21,- Wow.
00:12:21,00:12:22,- I am slightly terrified of the sun
00:12:22,00:12:25,because there is this massive risk of coronal mass ejections
00:12:25,00:12:27,"just wiping out all technology on the planet,"
00:12:27,00:12:28,which is just horrible at it.
00:12:28,00:12:31,"There was a massive solar storm in 1859,"
00:12:31,00:12:35,"which is the storm that has had the biggest effect on Earth,"
00:12:35,00:12:37,since records began on this.
00:12:37,00:12:41,And the biggest piece of technological infrastructure
00:12:41,00:12:43,that existed at that point was the telegraph network.
00:12:43,00:12:46,"And it basically, all across Europe and US,"
00:12:46,00:12:47,it basically shut down.
00:12:47,00:12:49,"Everyone unplugged their machines,"
00:12:49,00:12:51,but there were sparks flying off all the pylons.
00:12:51,00:12:53,"And even if you turned off the transmitters,"
00:12:53,00:12:56,they were still sending and receiving messages.
00:12:56,00:12:59,"And all right, we're seen all over the world."
00:12:59,00:13:01,"And in places like the Rocky Mountains,"
00:13:01,00:13:03,it was so bright that the gold mine
00:13:03,00:13:05,has actually got up and started making breakfast
00:13:05,00:13:06,'cause they thought it was daytime.
00:13:06,00:13:07,- Wow.
00:13:07,00:13:08,"- Wow, really."
00:13:08,00:13:11,"- Yeah, Lloyd's of London, the insurance people."
00:13:11,00:13:14,"In 2013, they did a study using the data"
00:13:14,00:13:18,from 1859 to work out how much it would cost
00:13:18,00:13:20,if that kind of thing happened today.
00:13:20,00:13:21,"And they estimated that in the US,"
00:13:21,00:13:23,"it could cost up to $3 trillion worth of damage,"
00:13:23,00:13:25,even if it was just that strong.
00:13:25,00:13:26,So it could go so much worse than that.
00:13:26,00:13:27,- Very scary.
00:13:27,00:13:28,- Yeah.
00:13:28,00:13:30,- You were just saying about these guys
00:13:30,00:13:31,who woke up in the middle of the night
00:13:31,00:13:33,because they saw the corona.
00:13:33,00:13:35,"- Earlier this week, there was an earthquake in California."
00:13:35,00:13:38,It was in the Napa Valley where they made wine.
00:13:38,00:13:41,"And enough people around there have these,"
00:13:41,00:13:45,"you know, these exercise bands that are attached"
00:13:45,00:13:47,to the internet and it can tell how many steps
00:13:47,00:13:49,you've done every day and how your heart rates doing
00:13:49,00:13:50,and such like that.
00:13:50,00:13:53,And they could work out who would woken up
00:13:53,00:13:55,at the same time as this earthquake went off.
00:13:55,00:13:58,And they found out that more than half of the people
00:13:58,00:14:00,who woke up during the earthquake stayed up
00:14:00,00:14:01,"for the rest of the night,"
00:14:01,00:14:03,even though it went off at 3 a.m.
00:14:03,00:14:04,"- Oh, really?"
00:14:04,00:14:05,"- Yeah, that's a great thing."
00:14:05,00:14:06,"- Yeah, that's a great thing."
00:14:06,00:14:07,- Just a way that you can take information
00:14:07,00:14:09,that was for another thing and then work out
00:14:09,00:14:11,how humans react to something.
00:14:11,00:14:12,- Yeah.
00:14:12,00:14:14,- You mentioned California and the sun.
00:14:14,00:14:17,"So, relatedly, there's a big solar plant in California"
00:14:17,00:14:18,"and when birds fly over the top of it,"
00:14:18,00:14:21,"often they catch fire because the sun's crazy,"
00:14:21,00:14:23,"so concentrated, so then they've called them streamers,"
00:14:23,00:14:25,the guys who work there and these birds fly through
00:14:25,00:14:28,and cat ignites to spontaneously combust mid-flight.
00:14:28,00:14:29,- Wow.
00:14:29,00:14:30,- And set on fire.
00:14:30,00:14:31,It's really sad.
00:14:31,00:14:32,"- Yeah, it's very sad."
00:14:32,00:14:33,They've got to freak out mid-flight.
00:14:33,00:14:35,"Like, that's never happened before."
00:14:35,00:14:36,- Yeah.
00:14:36,00:14:37,- You're on fire.
00:14:37,00:14:38,"- Oh, thank you."
00:14:38,00:14:39,"No, no, you're on fire."
00:14:39,00:14:40,- You're on fire.
00:14:40,00:14:41,- Literally.
00:14:41,00:14:43,(upbeat music)
00:14:43,00:14:45,"- Okay, time for fact number three."
00:14:45,00:14:47,And that is Chazzynstee.
00:14:47,00:14:50,"- Yeah, my, in fact, is that there are some birds nest"
00:14:50,00:14:52,that contain over a hundred rooms
00:14:52,00:14:54,and are so heavy that they cause trees to fall down.
00:14:54,00:14:55,- What?
00:14:55,00:14:56,"- Yeah, so these are really cool."
00:14:56,00:14:58,"This is my new favorite creature, I think,"
00:14:58,00:15:00,"the sociable weaver bird,"
00:15:00,00:15:02,which you find in Southern Africa
00:15:02,00:15:04,"and South Africa, Botswana, places like that."
00:15:04,00:15:06,"And they are really sociable,"
00:15:06,00:15:08,so they build these gigantic nests
00:15:08,00:15:11,where up to 400 birds will live in one nest
00:15:11,00:15:13,and they have loads and loads of different chambers.
00:15:13,00:15:14,And they're incredibly efficient
00:15:14,00:15:15,"for a bunch of different reasons,"
00:15:15,00:15:18,but they do weigh an enormous amount.
00:15:18,00:15:19,And so--
00:15:19,00:15:20,- Trees will collapse.
00:15:20,00:15:22,"- Yeah, trees are tree-recently collapsed"
00:15:22,00:15:25,"under their weight, so they can weigh almost 1,000 kilograms,"
00:15:25,00:15:28,which I think is about as much as 12 adult men.
00:15:28,00:15:30,"So if you stick 12 adult men in a tree,"
00:15:30,00:15:34,it's likely sometimes the branch is gonna break and it did.
00:15:34,00:15:35,The desert where most of these birds live
00:15:35,00:15:37,is obviously very hot in the daytime
00:15:37,00:15:38,and gets very cold at night.
00:15:38,00:15:41,And it's insulated so that if you go right into the middle
00:15:41,00:15:43,"of this nest where they all roost together,"
00:15:43,00:15:45,"then it's much warmer at night,"
00:15:45,00:15:48,like more than 10 degrees warmer than it is in the daytime.
00:15:48,00:15:49,"And then in the daytime, if you hang out"
00:15:49,00:15:50,"in the outside chambers,"
00:15:50,00:15:52,it's more than 10 degrees cooler than it is in the daytime
00:15:52,00:15:54,'cause it's so well-shaded.
00:15:54,00:15:54,- Wow.
00:15:54,00:15:56,- Do they have different rooms for different things?
00:15:56,00:15:57,Or do they have their own rooms and stuff?
00:15:57,00:15:59,"- They all-- the pairs have their own rooms,"
00:15:59,00:16:01,so each room will be a pair and sometimes they're offspring
00:16:01,00:16:04,and then in the center will be where they all sleep together.
00:16:04,00:16:05,- It's like a hotel.
00:16:05,00:16:06,"- It really is, it's incredible."
00:16:06,00:16:07,It is like--
00:16:07,00:16:08,- Wow.
00:16:08,00:16:09,- And it's not just that.
00:16:09,00:16:12,- Is it the other birds live in there as well?
00:16:12,00:16:13,- Yes.
00:16:13,00:16:14,- I saw a list of some of the other birds
00:16:14,00:16:18,"who live there, they include the familiar chat."
00:16:18,00:16:20,(laughing)
00:16:20,00:16:24,The ashy tit and the rosy faced love bird.
00:16:24,00:16:25,- Oh.
00:16:25,00:16:27,"But yeah, they do, they let other birds live in them,"
00:16:27,00:16:29,which I think is also great of these guys.
00:16:29,00:16:31,"When they've got a spare room going,"
00:16:31,00:16:31,"they say to their mates,"
00:16:31,00:16:34,"""Hey, you can be asked to build a nest, don't worry."""
00:16:34,00:16:35,- So they're like a hostel.
00:16:35,00:16:35,- Yeah.
00:16:35,00:16:36,- It's like Airbnb.
00:16:36,00:16:37,- Yeah exactly.
00:16:37,00:16:38,"- Badgers do that as well, don't they?"
00:16:38,00:16:39,- Today.
00:16:39,00:16:41,"- Yeah, 'cause badgers have sort of like a very similar"
00:16:41,00:16:43,"to a rabbit hole, but it's,"
00:16:43,00:16:44,"'cause rabbits only let rabbits in,"
00:16:44,00:16:46,"but badgers are like, if they see a rabbit,"
00:16:46,00:16:47,"they'll be like, ""Come on in mate, show us."""
00:16:47,00:16:49,"Yeah, yeah, and they let them live with them, yeah."
00:16:49,00:16:51,- Are you sure this isn't a watershed down?
00:16:51,00:16:55,"Or might be windin' the willows of the birds, yeah."
00:16:55,00:16:57,"Badger, they all wear tweed, right?"
00:16:57,00:16:59,"- Prairie dogs, we've done on QI as well,"
00:16:59,00:17:01,"quite sensibly, and they're quite similar to these birds,"
00:17:01,00:17:03,"and I also like them for it, aren't they?"
00:17:03,00:17:05,"'Cause they have enormous burrows, prairie towns,"
00:17:05,00:17:06,I think they're called.
00:17:06,00:17:08,"So they're smaller than they used to be,"
00:17:08,00:17:09,'cause they're now more in danger.
00:17:09,00:17:12,"But in 1900, a prairie town was found"
00:17:12,00:17:15,"that took up 25,000 square miles and housed"
00:17:15,00:17:17,400 million prairie dogs.
00:17:17,00:17:18,But that's how many?
00:17:18,00:17:19,- 400 million.
00:17:19,00:17:21,- 400 million.
00:17:21,00:17:22,(laughing)
00:17:22,00:17:24,- Are you hearing the number?
00:17:24,00:17:25,"- That's like the population of America, isn't it?"
00:17:25,00:17:26,- Yeah.
00:17:26,00:17:27,- So you've got--
00:17:27,00:17:28,"- You've got prairie dogs in America, then, yeah."
00:17:28,00:17:30,- That's amazing.
00:17:30,00:17:31,In one house.
00:17:31,00:17:33,(laughing)
00:17:33,00:17:35,"- It's in a book called Prairie Conservation,"
00:17:35,00:17:37,preserving North America's most.
00:17:37,00:17:39,- Why do they need to go out of service?
00:17:39,00:17:40,(laughing)
00:17:40,00:17:41,- They need to go out of service.
00:17:41,00:17:42,- They need it in every single house.
00:17:42,00:17:43,- They're doing good.
00:17:43,00:17:44,(laughing)
00:17:44,00:17:46,"- But they let other animals live in their homes as well,"
00:17:46,00:17:48,so you get burrowing out.
00:17:48,00:17:49,- How is the ready room?
00:17:49,00:17:50,(laughing)
00:17:50,00:17:52,"- Come on out, squeeze in."
00:17:52,00:17:53,- Let's go back to Nests.
00:17:53,00:17:54,"- Yeah, sure."
00:17:54,00:17:55,- That was about Nests.
00:17:55,00:17:56,"- You were talking about the temperature of the Nests,"
00:17:56,00:17:57,how it flops you with?
00:17:57,00:17:58,- Yes.
00:17:58,00:18:00,- I found something great thing about temperature and Nests.
00:18:00,00:18:02,"The sex of an alligator and some other reptiles,"
00:18:02,00:18:03,"like lizards and turtles,"
00:18:03,00:18:06,is determined by how warm the nest is that they're laden.
00:18:06,00:18:10,"So for alligators, if the egg is kept in a nest,"
00:18:10,00:18:13,"it turns out female, and if it's 34 degrees,"
00:18:13,00:18:14,it turns out male.
00:18:14,00:18:15,- Really?
00:18:15,00:18:16,- Yeah.
00:18:16,00:18:21,"- So in 2009, some researchers found a geofalcon nest"
00:18:21,00:18:26,"in the Arctic, and they did some radio carbon dating on it,"
00:18:26,00:18:30,"and they found that it'd been in use for 2,500 years."
00:18:30,00:18:33,"So people have been living there since the Roman era,"
00:18:33,00:18:35,or birds have been living there for the second time.
00:18:35,00:18:37,(laughing)
00:18:37,00:18:39,- First just outside and get out of my house.
00:18:40,00:18:42,"- Wow, that's incredible."
00:18:42,00:18:44,"- Yeah, Dan, you've been away at the Edinburgh Festival."
00:18:44,00:18:45,- Yes.
00:18:45,00:18:46,"- While you're away, Gregg Jenna came in,"
00:18:46,00:18:48,who was in one of our earlier podcasts.
00:18:48,00:18:50,"He's a historian from Horrible Histories,"
00:18:50,00:18:53,and we were talking about a human nest.
00:18:53,00:18:57,It was like a mattress inside a cave somewhere in Africa.
00:18:57,00:19:02,"So this mattress was in use for 77,000 years."
00:19:02,00:19:02,- Wow.
00:19:02,00:19:05,"- So many 7,000 years, I imagine how long that is."
00:19:05,00:19:08,"Like 2,000 years was like when Jesus was around."
00:19:08,00:19:09,- When Jesus was around.
00:19:09,00:19:11,"- It was 77,000 years."
00:19:11,00:19:12,- Is it still in use?
00:19:12,00:19:13,- It's mattress.
00:19:13,00:19:13,"- Oh, no."
00:19:13,00:19:14,- Okay.
00:19:14,00:19:16,"- I mean, we should keep the tradition going."
00:19:16,00:19:17,- That's true actually.
00:19:17,00:19:18,"- Yeah, why do we stop?"
00:19:18,00:19:21,"- They used moss, and they would put it in this corner of a cave."
00:19:21,00:19:24,"And then they'd use it for a while, for a while, for a while,"
00:19:24,00:19:27,"and then they would burn it and put more moss on top,"
00:19:27,00:19:29,and then they would burn it and put more moss on top.
00:19:29,00:19:30,"And this moss was particularly good,"
00:19:30,00:19:33,because it would stop insects from being able to live there.
00:19:33,00:19:34,So it was a really good place to sleep.
00:19:34,00:19:37,"- But also, so you're saying it's the exact same bed,"
00:19:37,00:19:38,effectively?
00:19:38,00:19:40,- Because they just kept adding different bits of the mattress on top.
00:19:40,00:19:42,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, wow."
00:19:42,00:19:43,- And they almost never changed the bedding.
00:19:43,00:19:44,We did ask about it.
00:19:44,00:19:46,"It was only about every 2,000 years or something"
00:19:46,00:19:48,that they bothered even changing the moss.
00:19:48,00:19:53,"- Just on the subject of mattresses, I was reminded,"
00:19:53,00:19:54,there's a trap door at the bottom of the blue whale
00:19:54,00:19:57,and the natural history is even London.
00:19:57,00:20:01,"When they opened it up, they discovered a mattress in there."
00:20:01,00:20:04,"And it was basically a time capsule inside the blue whale,"
00:20:04,00:20:06,"because it was when they were building it,"
00:20:06,00:20:08,where all the workmen would sneak in.
00:20:08,00:20:10,So they found a bunch of magazines and newspapers
00:20:10,00:20:13,"and empty wrappers, but also a mattress,"
00:20:13,00:20:15,"because apparently horny curators,"
00:20:15,00:20:17,that used to be a top location.
00:20:17,00:20:20,- I can't believe they went to that sort of trouble.
00:20:20,00:20:20,- Think about it.
00:20:20,00:20:23,"If you're someone who works at the Natural History Museum,"
00:20:23,00:20:25,you're already quite a big dork.
00:20:25,00:20:29,"And so the idea of sex inside a blue whale, yes please."
00:20:29,00:20:32,"I mean, even I think that that's the best possible location."
00:20:32,00:20:33,- The problem with the mattress.
00:20:33,00:20:34,"- I don't know why they need a trap door,"
00:20:34,00:20:37,because a blue whale's vagina is large enough to walk through.
00:20:37,00:20:38,- That's such a good point.
00:20:38,00:20:39,- Maybe it's a male blue whale.
00:20:39,00:20:40,- Yeah.
00:20:40,00:20:41,"- Oh, that's probably it."
00:20:41,00:20:43,"- I was just gonna talk really quickly about the weaver birds,"
00:20:43,00:20:46,just because they often now build their nests
00:20:46,00:20:47,on telegraph poles and pylons.
00:20:47,00:20:48,So you'd recognize their nests.
00:20:48,00:20:51,"And anyway, this often causes power outages."
00:20:51,00:20:53,So I was looking at animals that cause power outages
00:20:53,00:20:56,and squirrels are always cutting off electricity.
00:20:56,00:20:59,So there are some electricity companies that say that
00:20:59,00:21:01,two-thirds of their electricity outages
00:21:01,00:21:03,just come from squirrels chewing through wire
00:21:03,00:21:06,or like linking up circuits by jumping from one bit to another.
00:21:06,00:21:09,And they've shut down the Nasdaq twice.
00:21:09,00:21:13,I think an estimated $20 million worth of shares
00:21:13,00:21:15,were not traded in that time.
00:21:15,00:21:16,- $20 million.
00:21:16,00:21:19,"- Okay, guys, numbers can be big."
00:21:19,00:21:20,Let's get over that.
00:21:20,00:21:25,"- Time for the final fact of the show, James."
00:21:25,00:21:29,"- Okay, my fact is the worst baseball team in South Korea"
00:21:29,00:21:32,has replaced its supporters with robots.
00:21:32,00:21:35,So these guys are called the Hanwai Eagles.
00:21:35,00:21:38,They've lost more than 400 games in the last five years.
00:21:38,00:21:41,They came bottom of the league in the last two years
00:21:41,00:21:43,and their opposition have started calling them
00:21:43,00:21:46,the Hanwai chickens because they don't put up any kind of fight.
00:21:46,00:21:50,What they do is they have these screens around the pitch
00:21:50,00:21:52,"and you can, using your computer or your phone,"
00:21:52,00:21:55,you can put your photo on the screens
00:21:55,00:21:57,and you can make the screens do Mexican waves
00:21:57,00:22:00,or do cheers or chants or whatever.
00:22:00,00:22:01,I just think that's quite a--
00:22:01,00:22:02,- That is cool.
00:22:02,00:22:04,"- That's so sad, isn't it, though?"
00:22:04,00:22:06,"- I mean, so the players, and it's the idea"
00:22:06,00:22:08,that the players are supposed to feel rejuvenated
00:22:08,00:22:10,at the site of automated things
00:22:10,00:22:13,which are being forced mechanically to cheer them on.
00:22:13,00:22:15,"- Yeah, I think it's solving like that."
00:22:15,00:22:16,- Yeah.
00:22:16,00:22:17,- I think it's a bit demoralizing.
00:22:17,00:22:19,- It's solving the wrong problem.
00:22:19,00:22:21,"Like it's, the problem is the bad team,"
00:22:21,00:22:24,not that the fans are booing because they suck so much.
00:22:24,00:22:25,"It's like, do you know what we got to solve about this?"
00:22:25,00:22:27,"Our fans, they're the problem."
00:22:27,00:22:29,- Let's invest all our money in futuristic robots.
00:22:29,00:22:32,- Let's invest all our money to cheer as we lose
00:22:32,00:22:34,again and again and again.
00:22:34,00:22:36,"- Okay, so here's another way of using your fans,"
00:22:36,00:22:37,maybe a slightly better way.
00:22:37,00:22:39,You guys don't like the robot thing.
00:22:39,00:22:40,- I like the robot thing.
00:22:40,00:22:42,I just think it's not solving an issue.
00:22:42,00:22:45,"- Well, the Washington Bullets had this superfan"
00:22:45,00:22:47,called Robin Ficker.
00:22:47,00:22:50,And what they would do with him is they'd let him sit
00:22:50,00:22:53,behind the opposing coach's bench
00:22:53,00:22:55,and they would give him a megaphone
00:22:55,00:22:57,and he would make fun of the opposing team
00:22:57,00:22:59,by shouting at them.
00:22:59,00:23:02,So he would make fun of the coach's outfits
00:23:02,00:23:04,"or when the Chicago Bulls came to play,"
00:23:04,00:23:07,he read the sex passages of the Bulls'
00:23:07,00:23:08,coach's autobiography.
00:23:08,00:23:10,"- That's him, Jeremy and the game."
00:23:10,00:23:13,"- Wow, he's distracting."
00:23:13,00:23:15,- I was looking up robots and death.
00:23:15,00:23:18,And I found out that Jeremy Clarkson
00:23:18,00:23:20,was really killed by a robot was.
00:23:20,00:23:23,Apparently one of the robots was fighting another robot
00:23:23,00:23:26,and a circular blade came loose and zoomed across the studio
00:23:26,00:23:27,and there you had it on film
00:23:27,00:23:28,and they played it back in slow motion
00:23:28,00:23:31,and it went across his head two inches above his scalp.
00:23:31,00:23:32,"- Whoa, sorry, yeah."
00:23:32,00:23:33,- We actually know who the first person
00:23:33,00:23:34,would be killed by a robot.
00:23:34,00:23:36,And his name was--
00:23:36,00:23:37,- Robbie Williams. - Robbie Williams.
00:23:37,00:23:38,- Yeah.
00:23:38,00:23:39,- How was he killed by robot?
00:23:39,00:23:42,It was in a-- - He was in a calf factory
00:23:42,00:23:44,or something like that and he was in fog factory
00:23:44,00:23:47,and he was hit by a protruding arm
00:23:47,00:23:48,and he was killed by that.
00:23:48,00:23:51,"- So it was like, 'cause it was an arm,"
00:23:51,00:23:52,kind of was a robot.
00:23:52,00:23:52,- Yeah.
00:23:52,00:23:55,"- Well, it was a big mechanical device."
00:23:55,00:23:57,It was for moving car parts from one end
00:23:57,00:23:58,to the factory together
00:23:58,00:24:00,"and it just, he got hit on the head really hard to it."
00:24:00,00:24:01,"The second guy who got killed by robot,"
00:24:01,00:24:02,definitely got killed by a robot.
00:24:02,00:24:05,His name was Kenji Rada and that was two years later
00:24:05,00:24:08,and he got pushed into a grinding machine by a robot arm.
00:24:08,00:24:10,- Ooh. - Yeah.
00:24:10,00:24:12,- Like was it a malicious intent?
00:24:12,00:24:13,- So there's never been a malicious intent.
00:24:13,00:24:15,There is an innate human fear of robots.
00:24:15,00:24:18,The first use of the word robot was in a plague
00:24:18,00:24:20,by Czech playwright Carol Kappett
00:24:20,00:24:22,called Rosam's Universal Robots
00:24:22,00:24:24,and it was about robots trying to take over and kill people.
00:24:24,00:24:26,"- 9% of Americans, when surveyed,"
00:24:26,00:24:28,admit that they will have sex with a robot.
00:24:28,00:24:31,- I would have sex with a robot.
00:24:31,00:24:32,"- So was that book called Sex and Robots,"
00:24:32,00:24:35,which it's a guy who's a huge computer scientist
00:24:35,00:24:37,and chess champion saying that he thinks
00:24:37,00:24:39,will have sex with robots within 50 years?
00:24:39,00:24:40,"- Well, he's one of the 9%."
00:24:40,00:24:42,"- Yeah, definitely."
00:24:42,00:24:45,- They did have the first kissing robots in 2008.
00:24:45,00:24:46,They were made in Taiwan
00:24:46,00:24:49,and they performed as the stars in Phantom of the Opera.
00:24:49,00:24:52,They did an all robots cast for Phantom of the Opera
00:24:52,00:24:53,and these two robots kiss
00:24:53,00:24:55,and it's the worst kiss you've ever seen.
00:24:55,00:24:56,Their heads come together
00:24:56,00:24:57,and then they pause for 10 seconds
00:24:57,00:24:58,and their heads pull apart.
00:24:58,00:25:00,It's like at a 12 year old's disco.
00:25:00,00:25:01,- Empathetic robots are a thing
00:25:01,00:25:02,that just been experimented with
00:25:02,00:25:05,and they've sort of are claiming they've invented
00:25:05,00:25:07,where their robots that respond
00:25:07,00:25:08,to your own facial expressions
00:25:08,00:25:10,with matching facial expressions
00:25:10,00:25:12,"and they're preparing, why are you smiling?"
00:25:12,00:25:13,- It's really creepily.
00:25:13,00:25:14,- Sorry.
00:25:14,00:25:15,"- Okay, I'm gonna start looking at you."
00:25:15,00:25:17,So they've come up with empathetic robots now
00:25:17,00:25:20,who's faces top of everybody.
00:25:20,00:25:22,They've come up with empathetic robots
00:25:22,00:25:24,who's faces mirror the facial expressions that humans have
00:25:24,00:25:26,in the hope that they can care
00:25:26,00:25:28,for lonely humans in future
00:25:28,00:25:32,"but again, a bit like the fake cheering crowds in career."
00:25:32,00:25:34,It seems like a sad thing if you need a robot
00:25:34,00:25:36,to fake empathetic facial expressions
00:25:36,00:25:37,in order to feel okay.
00:25:37,00:25:39,"- Our buddy, Leven Skyra,"
00:25:39,00:25:42,"who was on this podcast a few episodes ago,"
00:25:42,00:25:44,just actually took part in the opposite version
00:25:44,00:25:45,"of what we're talking about,"
00:25:45,00:25:48,which was the World Robot Football Cup.
00:25:48,00:25:49,- Oh yeah.
00:25:49,00:25:52,"- And he went out to Brazil, I think."
00:25:52,00:25:53,"It was in Brazil. - Yeah, it wasn't Brazilian."
00:25:53,00:25:56,- And so it was robots playing against each other
00:25:56,00:25:58,at football and Leven was saying
00:25:58,00:26:00,"that they've projected that within 50 years,"
00:26:00,00:26:03,a robot football team will be able to beat
00:26:03,00:26:04,a human football team.
00:26:04,00:26:06,- Within two months they'll be able to beat Man United.
00:26:06,00:26:07,(laughing)
00:26:07,00:26:09,"Did you see, so if you've seen this,"
00:26:09,00:26:10,"- No, I haven't."
00:26:10,00:26:12,"- So we're recording this on Wednesday,"
00:26:12,00:26:14,"but on Tuesday, Man United played against MK Duns"
00:26:14,00:26:17,who are lower in the third tier of English football
00:26:17,00:26:19,and they lost four nil.
00:26:19,00:26:19,- Whoa.
00:26:19,00:26:21,- And there was a great thing on Twitter.
00:26:21,00:26:24,There was a girl who'd got a free bet
00:26:24,00:26:26,from an online betting site
00:26:26,00:26:29,and she put two pound 50 on Man United to win four nil.
00:26:29,00:26:32,But it accidentally put two pound 50 on MK Duns
00:26:32,00:26:35,to win four nil at 500 to one.
00:26:35,00:26:36,- Wow.
00:26:36,00:26:37,- Wow.
00:26:37,00:26:39,"- And she was like, ""Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God,"
00:26:39,00:26:41,"""I've won over a thousand pounds."""
00:26:41,00:26:41,- That's great.
00:26:41,00:26:44,"- Anyway, let's talk about, oh, we'd like to talk about."
00:26:44,00:26:45,- I was gonna talk about sports fans
00:26:45,00:26:47,since we're on sports now.
00:26:47,00:26:50,"So I was looking at generally sports fans,"
00:26:50,00:26:52,one of them using things I like that's happened
00:26:52,00:26:55,in the past is that during baseball matches
00:26:55,00:26:56,"until about a hundred years ago,"
00:26:56,00:26:58,'cause the stadium was smaller.
00:26:58,00:27:01,"If you hit the ball out of the stadium,"
00:27:01,00:27:02,it would fall into the long grass
00:27:02,00:27:04,and the game had to stop for five minutes
00:27:04,00:27:07,"and everyone, the fans and the players"
00:27:07,00:27:09,had to spend five minutes searching for the ball
00:27:09,00:27:11,because they wouldn't have lots of spare balls.
00:27:11,00:27:12,I think now in baseball balls just get lost
00:27:12,00:27:14,"and that's it, they have, they bring spare."
00:27:14,00:27:15,"- People take them, don't they?"
00:27:15,00:27:16,- Yeah.
00:27:16,00:27:17,"- What do you get to, if it comes out and you catch it,"
00:27:17,00:27:18,it's your ball.
00:27:18,00:27:18,- Yeah.
00:27:18,00:27:19,- That's how it works.
00:27:19,00:27:20,- It's another thing about old baseball games
00:27:20,00:27:23,where they didn't have as many umpires in those days.
00:27:23,00:27:25,"And some of the umpires were allowed to,"
00:27:25,00:27:27,"if they weren't quite sure about a decision,"
00:27:27,00:27:30,"they're allowed to consult the audience,"
00:27:30,00:27:31,consult the crowd.
00:27:31,00:27:32,- I can't want to be a millionaire.
00:27:32,00:27:33,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:27:33,00:27:34,And see what the crowd thought
00:27:34,00:27:37,and then use their ideas if they couldn't really work it out.
00:27:37,00:27:41,- 92% of the audience thinks that that was a home run.
00:27:41,00:27:43,"- God, must have sucked when you were playing away games."
00:27:43,00:27:44,- Yeah.
00:27:44,00:27:45,"- If you plainly made it and you just missed it,"
00:27:45,00:27:46,did you make it?
00:27:46,00:27:47,- No.
00:27:47,00:27:48,- Definitely not.
00:27:48,00:27:51,- So I think the angriest any sports fans
00:27:51,00:27:53,have ever been and James will know about this
00:27:53,00:27:54,and it must be during the Heidi game.
00:27:54,00:27:56,- Is that the Kevin Courage game?
00:27:56,00:27:57,(laughs)
00:27:57,00:27:58,- Heidi goes Seeky.
00:27:58,00:27:59,- Yeah.
00:27:59,00:28:01,- I don't think I know about the Heidi game.
00:28:01,00:28:02,- It's so good.
00:28:02,00:28:04,And it is frequently voted the most exciting game
00:28:04,00:28:06,for American football of all time.
00:28:06,00:28:08,It was Oakland Raiders versus New York Jets.
00:28:08,00:28:09,And it was really close.
00:28:09,00:28:11,"The New York Jets were just ahead of the Oakland Raiders,"
00:28:11,00:28:13,but it was obviously a really thrilling match.
00:28:13,00:28:14,It had about three minutes left.
00:28:14,00:28:16,"And suddenly at the very last minute,"
00:28:16,00:28:18,the Oakland Raiders overtook the New York Jets
00:28:18,00:28:19,and they won and it was a massive title
00:28:19,00:28:21,and it was a massive deal.
00:28:21,00:28:23,"And NBC, the network that was broadcasting it,"
00:28:23,00:28:26,"as it had overrun by a couple of minutes past its three hours,"
00:28:26,00:28:28,switched over automatically to show Heidi
00:28:28,00:28:30,for all the kids on the other channel.
00:28:30,00:28:32,"Now, they didn't want to do this."
00:28:32,00:28:34,The NBC executive saw that it was a really thrilling match
00:28:34,00:28:36,"and we're like, we've got to obviously keep this on the airwaves."
00:28:36,00:28:38,"So they tried to call the studio to say,"
00:28:38,00:28:40,"obviously keep the match on, guys."
00:28:40,00:28:40,Look at this.
00:28:40,00:28:41,This is the biggest match ever.
00:28:41,00:28:44,"But so many people, so many angry fans"
00:28:44,00:28:46,"were trying to call the studio to say,"
00:28:46,00:28:48,I can't believe you're going to switch over to Heidi.
00:28:48,00:28:49,It's outrageous.
00:28:49,00:28:50,I want to watch the rest of the match.
00:28:50,00:28:53,That their phone lines broke down and the executives
00:28:53,00:28:55,"couldn't get through to the studio to say, keep it on."
00:28:55,00:28:59,"So in the great irony of fan complaints,"
00:28:59,00:29:02,they caused Heidi to overtake the match
00:29:02,00:29:04,by calling breaking the phone lines and Heidi came on.
00:29:04,00:29:07,"And then NBC managed to irritate people further,"
00:29:07,00:29:10,"I think, by during this episode of Heidi,"
00:29:10,00:29:11,there was a really touching scene
00:29:11,00:29:15,"where Heidi's disabled sister, I think, learns to walk"
00:29:15,00:29:17,"and they thought, what can we do to remedy this?"
00:29:17,00:29:18,So they flashed up the score suddenly
00:29:18,00:29:21,for the fans in the middle of high school.
00:29:21,00:29:25,All these little kids suddenly tearing up at this scene.
00:29:25,00:29:28,"And they say it sounds like an homestay to Fergie, bro."
00:29:28,00:29:32,"My favorite baseball player, just before we finish,"
00:29:32,00:29:35,"is Joe Sprintz, OK?"
00:29:35,00:29:39,"And one of his rivals, another baseball catcher,"
00:29:39,00:29:41,had caught a ball that had been dropped
00:29:41,00:29:42,from the top of a building.
00:29:42,00:29:45,And he got a world record for the highest catch
00:29:45,00:29:47,from a high point.
00:29:47,00:29:50,So he decided that he wanted to beat this record.
00:29:50,00:29:55,And so he got a friend to go up into a blimp.
00:29:55,00:29:56,And someone was going to drop the ball
00:29:56,00:29:58,from the top of this hot air balloon.
00:29:58,00:29:59,And he was going to catch it.
00:29:59,00:30:00,"Oh, my God."
00:30:00,00:30:01,OK.
00:30:01,00:30:03,He caught it in the way that baseball players do
00:30:03,00:30:05,with his mitt directly above his face.
00:30:05,00:30:07,The ball hit his mitt.
00:30:07,00:30:08,The mitt hit his face.
00:30:08,00:30:12,And he fractured his jaw and lost five teeth.
00:30:12,00:30:14,"And apparently, he dropped the ball."
00:30:14,00:30:16,Oh!
00:30:16,00:30:18,"And someone alongside him just went, ""Stop hitting yourself!"""
00:30:18,00:30:20,"""Stop hitting yourself!"""
00:30:20,00:30:24,"OK, that's it for this episode."
