1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,760
 - We run it on QI a few years ago.

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:02,600
 - Yeah.

3
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,600
 - Which was, there's no such thing as a fish.

4
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:05,720
 - And it's not such thing as a fish.

5
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:08,320
 - No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary

6
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,120
 of Underwater Life.

7
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,560
 It says it right now, first paragraph.

8
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:12,800
 No such thing as a fish.

9
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,380
 (upbeat music)

10
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:21,760
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,360
 of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast

12
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,800
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

13
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,920
 My name is Dan Triber.

14
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,520
 I'm sitting here with three other elves,

15
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32,240
 James Harkin, Alex Bell, and Anichezinski.

16
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,120
 And once again, we've gathered around the microphone

17
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,560
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

18
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,440
 And here we go, in no particular order.

19
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,280
 Here they are.

20
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,260
 (upbeat music)

21
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:42,880
 Okay, back number one, Alex.

22
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,640
 - Okay, when he was bored, Calvin Coolidge

23
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,960
 used to ring a bell to summon his bodyguards

24
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,440
 and then hide from them under the oval office desk.

25
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,720
 (laughing)

26
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,560
 - Really?

27
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,400
 - Yep.

28
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,240
 - Just as a joke.

29
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,720
 But I mean, presumably after the first time you've done that.

30
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,280
 Or did they have to be like parents?

31
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,120
 - It's too bad.

32
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:00,960
 - It's too bad for your child.

33
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,120
 - Oh, where does it be?

34
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,120
 Oh no!

35
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:03,960
 - Probably.

36
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,320
 - Yeah, I wouldn't have much trust in them

37
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:08,120
 if they were continually fooled by it every time.

38
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:08,960
 - That would be the worst of it.

39
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,920
 - You would fire your secret service straight away.

40
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,640
 You'd be like, seriously, this is the second time you're done.

41
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,480
 - Yeah.

42
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,160
 - Well, actually speaking of firing people and hiding,

43
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,720
 I found a completely sort of slightly related fact

44
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,720
 as well, secondary fact.

45
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,680
 - Herbert Hoover had a really strict privacy policy

46
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,240
 to the point where whenever he or his wife were on the approach,

47
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,600
 the White House staff would signal to each other

48
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,640
 using the bell system in the White House

49
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,280
 and then hide in a cupboard or behind bushes

50
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,080
 or something like that,

51
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,760
 because he hated seeing his stuff

52
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,640
 and really liked his privacy.

53
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,400
 And they risked being fired if they were seen.

54
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,720
 So anytime he came into a room,

55
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,840
 they would sort of have to scramble around

56
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,680
 and try and hide somewhere.

57
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,640
 They also used to doing this

58
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,920
 that when Harry Truman took over the presidency,

59
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,920
 moved into the White House, yes.

60
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,800
 - He was like, "Where are all my stuff?"

61
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,240
 Herbert Hoover invented Hoover Ball, didn't he?

62
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,240
 Which was--

63
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,280
 - Is it as soon as he gets the ball

64
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,600
 or the other player's hide and cover it?

65
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,760
 So he just gets the ball right to the ball line?

66
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,600
 - Yeah.

67
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,840
 - Even hides under a desk, yes.

68
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,680
 - This is when we find them.

69
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,040
 - That's Cool Ridge Ball.

70
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,720
 - No, it was actually invented by his doctor to keep him fit.

71
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,320
 And it's a cross between according to the government website,

72
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,000
 tennis, volleyball, and medicine ball.

73
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 Which do you guys know what that is?

74
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 - Medicine ball, yeah.

75
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,760
 It's a big ball that you use for exercise.

76
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,920
 - Yeah. - That big and everything.

77
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,160
 So it's basically like volleyball

78
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,200
 with a unbelievably heavy ball about the weight

79
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,520
 of a newborn baby

80
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,200
 and you throw it over the net.

81
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,320
 Calvin Coolidge liked to eat breakfast in bed

82
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,440
 while having his head rubbed with Vaseline.

83
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,040
 - Was he bald?

84
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,080
 'Cause that is a recipe for greasy hair.

85
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:34,920
 - No, no, that's really bad.

86
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,600
 - You know the guy who invented Vaseline?

87
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,640
 He was, I forgot his name,

88
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,000
 cheeseburger or something like that.

89
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,200
 He thought that Vaseline was like a big sort of cure all

90
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,920
 and he used to eat it every single day

91
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,400
 and he used to rub it on his body all the time

92
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,880
 'cause he thought it would cure him of all illness.

93
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,320
 - And did it?

94
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,400
 - Well, he's dead.

95
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,240
 - Okay.

96
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,720
 So it didn't make him live forever.

97
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,680
 - Yeah, okay, so it wasn't an elixir.

98
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,560
 I can understand why he does that.

99
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,240
 I once went on a date and I couldn't find any hair gel

100
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,120
 and my hair was really all over the shop.

101
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,960
 - If this is something about Mary's story,

102
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,080
 can I stop you there?

103
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,920
 - I put tiger balm in my hair

104
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,680
 and my god, that was the most intense sensation

105
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,520
 I've ever had.

106
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,400
 It was like putting chilies all over my head.

107
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,360
 It was just like on fire

108
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,440
 and my head stunk like hell.

109
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,320
 I got in the train and everyone was like,

110
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,160
 what is that?

111
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,560
 - Was that a successful date?

112
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,240
 - It was 'cause in the end, I had to admit it.

113
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,720
 I was like, by the way, the reason my head smells like this

114
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,560
 is because I did tiger balm over my head

115
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,280
 and she said, I really like smell.

116
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,000
 - It is quite a nice smell and if you have a cold,

117
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,720
 it's quite so maybe if she was a bit blocked up.

118
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,560
 - Exactly.

119
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,400
 - You would have really helped her out.

120
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,240
 - Exactly, my sinuses were, I can credit all that.

121
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,320
 My point is though, is that maybe the Vaseline on his head

122
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,800
 while he's eating kind of gives a slight kind of

123
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,840
 like putting Tabasco on your face?

124
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,240
 - Maybe that's how he managed to get Mrs. Coolidge.

125
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,080
 She was like, oh really?

126
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,960
 - Yeah, it was a smell of Vaseline.

127
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,440
 - Have you thought of tiger balm?

128
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,400
 - There is a thing called the Coolidge effect.

129
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,240
 Do you know that?

130
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,080
 - No.

131
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,080
 - The idea is that male animals prefer to have sex

132
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,880
 with females they've never seen before

133
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,720
 than females that they have seen before

134
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,920
 and it's called the Coolidge effects

135
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,760
 and it's named after Calvin Coolidge.

136
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,760
 - Why?

137
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,640
 - It's a story about him and his wife

138
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,560
 who were being shown around the farm

139
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,560
 and they got to a chicken yard

140
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,760
 and Mrs. Coolidge noticed that the male chicken

141
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,240
 was having sex a lot and she said to the guy,

142
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,600
 does he do that a lot?

143
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,600
 And he said, oh yeah, he has sex about 12 times a day

144
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,760
 and she goes, well, you should tell that to my husband.

145
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,640
 So then the guy went to Calvin Coolidge

146
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,200
 and he said, oh, this chicken has sex 12 times a day

147
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,000
 and your wife told me to tell you about it

148
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,760
 and he said, oh, is it the same chicken every time

149
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,600
 that you have sex with?

150
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,200
 And this guy said, no, it's a different chicken every time

151
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,920
 and said, well, tell that to my wife then.

152
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,040
 - Just a chicken farm and named it then.

153
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,360
 - It was named after that anecdote

154
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,120
 which I guess probably didn't even happen.

155
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,960
 - Yeah.

156
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,800
 - But just to make this clear,

157
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,960
 that is a really cruel thing he said.

158
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,760
 So he did basically say the only reason

159
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,280
 he wants to keep having sex is 'cause it's not

160
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,560
 with my wife every time.

161
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,440
 He's saying, if I was to have sex 12 times a day,

162
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,680
 it wouldn't be with you.

163
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,520
 - Yeah.

164
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,120
 - To be fair, is a pretty soggy move on her part.

165
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:00,960
 - That was the way it goes.

166
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,040
 - No one comes across well in that anecdote at all

167
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,280
 apart from the chicken.

168
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,560
 (laughing)

169
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,440
 - Do you know, I only found something the other day,

170
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,240
 a weird number of presidents of one Grammy Awards

171
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,440
 for spoken word albums.

172
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,280
 - Really?

173
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,760
 - So I stumbled upon this 'cause Hillary Clinton

174
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,160
 did a spoken word album which was

175
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,680
 some kind of, you know,

176
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,680
 telling us how we should live better album in the '90s.

177
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,320
 Obama's won two Grammys for spoken words.

178
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,160
 - Oh, really spoken words.

179
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,800
 - Oh, they are well spoken.

180
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,800
 - Yeah.

181
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,080
 (laughing)

182
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:30,920
 - True.

183
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,600
 - Clinton's got won, both the Clinton's got won Jimmy Carter.

184
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,440
 - To be a president.

185
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,280
 - You have to be well spoken though, don't you?

186
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,080
 You have to be good at doing speeches, so.

187
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:38,920
 - Yeah.

188
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,760
 - Not that surprised me.

189
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,600
 - It makes total sense.

190
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,440
 - Yeah.

191
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,680
 - I wonder who didn't get one.

192
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,760
 - Well, George Bush certainly didn't.

193
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,600
 - Did he not?

194
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,440
 - Yet.

195
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:50,120
 - So, is there any night just full of presidents,

196
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,320
 just waiting the best spoken word?

197
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,920
 We've got Clinton, Obama.

198
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,320
 - I think the presidents are the only ones

199
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,680
 who are asked to make audio tapes.

200
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,840
 - It would be like, the winner is Calvin Coolidge.

201
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,680
 Has anyone seen Calvin Coolidge?

202
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,880
 (laughing)

203
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,360
 - I want to talk about hide and seek

204
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,280
 'cause we were talking about hide and seek.

205
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,120
 - Oh yeah, yeah.

206
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,040
 - Coolidge playing hide and seek.

207
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,440
 So, you know how refrigerators

208
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,160
 have got this magnetic seal that keeps them closed?

209
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,000
 - Yeah.

210
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,160
 - Because of hide and seek.

211
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,600
 In 1958, the decade up to 1958,

212
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,720
 a load of kids have been killed playing hide and seek

213
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,720
 and hidden inside refrigerators.

214
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,680
 And so, the new law was brought in saying

215
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,920
 that they had to be capable of being opened

216
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,880
 with a 15 pound push from inside.

217
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,080
 And as soon as that law came in,

218
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,240
 they had to come up with a way of making sure

219
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,920
 they stayed closed, but we're able to be open

220
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,760
 from the inside.

221
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,600
 - And that shouldn't mind.

222
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,480
 - Should a kid push, because previous to that,

223
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,840
 would it lock and then--

224
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,040
 - Well, they used to have latches on them.

225
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,960
 - So the kid would be stuck inside.

226
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,800
 - Yeah.

227
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,640
 - Okay.

228
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,200
 - That's interesting, because I only found out recently

229
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,400
 that in back to the future, the time machine

230
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,520
 was originally supposed to be a fridge.

231
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,800
 And the reason it was changed was because of a fear

232
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,240
 that kids would start trying to imitate them

233
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,120
 and locking themselves in fridges.

234
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:01,960
 - Oh.

235
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,800
 - Yeah.

236
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,800
 - Should we wrap up on this one or this one?

237
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,800
 - No, go, go, go, go, it.

238
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,480
 - I was just looking at things,

239
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,440
 well, hobbies of presidents, which quite good

240
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,640
 and related to hide and seek.

241
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:13,240
 So, Woodrow Wilson made his secret service staff,

242
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,040
 paint his golf balls black and wintered, didn't he,

243
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,120
 so that he could still see them in the snow.

244
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,320
 But, in more humorous news,

245
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,440
 one of Einstein's favorite hobbies was sailing,

246
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,120
 and he loved to sail even though he couldn't swim

247
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,880
 and refuse to wear a life jacket.

248
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,360
 And, at one point in his life,

249
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,160
 he had to be pulled from the water by a teenager

250
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,520
 who heard him crying out for help

251
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,120
 and pulled Einstein out of the water.

252
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,120
 And the teenager just disappeared,

253
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,480
 so no one knows who that teenager was,

254
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,480
 but Einstein's life saved by a teenager.

255
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,080
 But, bizarrely, this year,

256
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,640
 there's a fish called Einstein in black pool,

257
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,800
 and it got a bladder infection,

258
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,280
 which meant that it stopped being able to swim

259
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,680
 and just sank to the bottom.

260
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,520
 And so, the guy in black pool has designed

261
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,960
 a tiny fish life jacket,

262
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,960
 which the fish now uses to swim in.

263
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,200
 So, unlike Einstein,

264
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,080
 this poor Einstein fish has been forced into a life jacket

265
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,560
 and given the chance to swim again.

266
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,400
 I just think that's a really weird mirroring

267
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,280
 of the real Einstein's life.

268
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,840
 (upbeat music)

269
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,640
 - Okay, time for fact number two.

270
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,600
 And that's my facts.

271
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,120
 My fact this week is that until 2011,

272
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,360
 the sun was only in theory a sphere,

273
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,520
 but it's now confirmed to be a sphere.

274
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,920
 - Oh yeah, how have you confirmed that?

275
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,920
 - NASA confirmed it.

276
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,760
 - Oh, did they?

277
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,600
 - Yes.

278
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,440
 - How did they do that?

279
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,280
 - So, NASA, basically,

280
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,320
 and this was a headline that appeared

281
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:26,520
 on NASA's official website on February the 6th, 2011.

282
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,520
 It said, "It's official, the sun is a sphere."

283
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,480
 And the idea was that NASA had two twin stereo probes.

284
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,640
 They were called stereo,

285
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,640
 and they went to either side of the sun

286
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,360
 and took the first 3D photo.

287
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,400
 Basically, they got to the dark side of the sun,

288
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,240
 as it were.

289
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,640
 They got to the side that we never see.

290
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,840
 - Yeah, it's not dark as such, though.

291
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:47,480
 - But just in terms of a badly chosen words,

292
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,040
 it's the dark side of the sun.

293
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,400
 - That would have been amazing if they got to the other side

294
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,880
 and it turned out to be dark.

295
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,880
 - Yeah, it would be amazing.

296
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,040
 Or flat, or hologram, something awesome.

297
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,160
 But anyway, I just find that amazing.

298
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,600
 I find that we've gone all this time

299
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,840
 and just assuming that scientists agree that it's a sphere.

300
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,360
 And it's probably a bit tongue in cheek,

301
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:06,200
 but I just like that is how far scientists do actually go.

302
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,040
 - Might not be.

303
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:07,880
 - Might not be.

304
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,720
 - That's what they say.

305
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,840
 - It is amazingly spherical, the sun.

306
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,560
 - Yeah, they don't understand why this is the case.

307
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,080
 It was discovered only in 2012.

308
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,240
 It's the most perfect sphere in nature by quite a long way.

309
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,360
 And I think it's the second most perfect sphere

310
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,240
 in the universe that we know of.

311
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,720
 - What's the first?

312
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,720
 - The first are the silicon balls

313
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,120
 that have been used as a replacement for the kilogram.

314
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,320
 So one incredible thing is that if you scale the sun

315
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,760
 to the size of a beach ball,

316
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,040
 it's bold, the biggest dip in it

317
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,120
 would be less than the width of a human hair.

318
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,720
 But even so, the biggest dip on the sun.

319
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,880
 So the biggest difference between it's smallest diameter

320
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,840
 and it's biggest is 10 kilometers.

321
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,880
 And if my mass is right,

322
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,520
 if you blew up this perfect sphere

323
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,000
 that we've created to the size of the sun,

324
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,360
 then the biggest dip in it would be about 120 centimeters.

325
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:56,280
 - I know you always wanted to have a Guinness Book of Record done.

326
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,120
 - Yes.

327
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,960
 - One that you can't have is the record

328
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,880
 for longest time spent staring at the sun,

329
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,920
 because the Guinness Book of Records specifically

330
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,040
 refuses to accept entries for that one.

331
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:07,880
 - Ah.

332
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,960
 - Why, because it's too dangerous?

333
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,680
 - Because it's too dangerous.

334
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,160
 Isaac Newton used to do experiments

335
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:16,160
 where he would look at the sun for as long as possible.

336
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,080
 And he did it one time for so long

337
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,640
 that he had to shut himself up in a darkened room

338
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,840
 and wait for his sight to return.

339
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,360
 And it took three days for his sight to return.

340
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,320
 - Not so smart, he's scientist.

341
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,520
 Not so smart.

342
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,400
 - In 1999, when there was no clips,

343
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,440
 a lot of people were looking at the sun then.

344
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:35,720
 And when people obviously damaged their eyesight

345
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,560
 and they went to a hospital afterwards,

346
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,120
 the doctors could tell exactly when they looked at the sun

347
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:43,480
 by looking at the impression on the retinas.

348
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,000
 So it was like a halfway through the eclipse,

349
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,760
 it would have the half sickle of the sun.

350
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,760
 - Wow.

351
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,080
 - That's so cool.

352
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:50,920
 - That's extraordinary.

353
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,560
 - Although I don't know how anyone's eyes got damaged then,

354
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,720
 because I remember it and it was so cloudy.

355
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,240
 - So the original fact that we had here was how we didn't know

356
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,800
 for sure that the sun was a sphere.

357
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,320
 But people were pretty certain about it.

358
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,800
 So Galileo, for instance, he could see the sunspots

359
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,680
 going round the back and coming back again.

360
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,640
 And so he postulated that it must be a sphere.

361
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,800
 And there are lots of other reasons why we were pretty certain

362
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,720
 it was a sphere.

363
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,080
 But not 100%.

364
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,000
 - Yes, exactly.

365
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,280
 - I wrote a headline, which you guys are gonna hate.

366
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,120
 - But.

367
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,640
 - So the people listening to this podcast,

368
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,440
 they must hear Dan about to say something

369
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,960
 and then those are all groaning and wonder why we do it.

370
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,600
 And it's, you know what, it's the luck on his face.

371
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,920
 As soon as he's about to say something ridiculous,

372
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,400
 he has this luck as if to say,

373
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,440
 "I'm a naughty boy, you guys are all good, shout out me."

374
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,280
 Anyway, go on.

375
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:43,480
 - Okay, so the world almost ended in 2012.

376
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:46,520
 But we survived by a week.

377
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,520
 This is what happened.

378
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:52,520
 The sun had a ginormous solar flare in 2012 around July.

379
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:56,080
 And it shot out into one particular bit of space.

380
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:00,920
 We were a week away from the end of the path of where it went out to.

381
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,880
 And scientists have said that if we were in the path,

382
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,200
 if we were a week ahead in time,

383
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,000
 or if it happened a week later and we were in that path,

384
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,160
 the size of the solar flare

385
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,840
 would have knocked us basically back to the dark ages.

386
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,200
 It was literally, we were that close to destruction.

387
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,600
 - What, and if we'd just been a bit further ahead

388
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,000
 in our rotation around the sun?

389
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,320
 - Yes, we would have been in its path.

390
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,560
 So it's just, we just happened to not be in its path.

391
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,400
 - Wow.

392
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,400
 - I am slightly terrified of the sun

393
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,120
 because there is this massive risk of coronal mass ejections

394
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,000
 just wiping out all technology on the planet,

395
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,600
 which is just horrible at it.

396
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,560
 There was a massive solar storm in 1859,

397
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:35,920
 which is the storm that has had the biggest effect on Earth,

398
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,360
 since records began on this.

399
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,160
 And the biggest piece of technological infrastructure

400
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,360
 that existed at that point was the telegraph network.

401
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,640
 And it basically, all across Europe and US,

402
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,680
 it basically shut down.

403
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,280
 Everyone unplugged their machines,

404
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,080
 but there were sparks flying off all the pylons.

405
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,600
 And even if you turned off the transmitters,

406
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,000
 they were still sending and receiving messages.

407
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,160
 And all right, we're seen all over the world.

408
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,360
 And in places like the Rocky Mountains,

409
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,440
 it was so bright that the gold mine

410
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,040
 has actually got up and started making breakfast

411
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,320
 'cause they thought it was daytime.

412
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,160
 - Wow.

413
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,400
 - Wow, really.

414
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,520
 - Yeah, Lloyd's of London, the insurance people.

415
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:14,680
 In 2013, they did a study using the data

416
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:18,960
 from 1859 to work out how much it would cost

417
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,000
 if that kind of thing happened today.

418
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,320
 And they estimated that in the US,

419
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,600
 it could cost up to $3 trillion worth of damage,

420
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,160
 even if it was just that strong.

421
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,880
 So it could go so much worse than that.

422
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,720
 - Very scary.

423
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,560
 - Yeah.

424
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,160
 - You were just saying about these guys

425
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,520
 who woke up in the middle of the night

426
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,040
 because they saw the corona.

427
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,760
 - Earlier this week, there was an earthquake in California.

428
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,480
 It was in the Napa Valley where they made wine.

429
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,880
 And enough people around there have these,

430
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:45,320
 you know, these exercise bands that are attached

431
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,720
 to the internet and it can tell how many steps

432
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,680
 you've done every day and how your heart rates doing

433
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,680
 and such like that.

434
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:53,080
 And they could work out who would woken up

435
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,920
 at the same time as this earthquake went off.

436
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,360
 And they found out that more than half of the people

437
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,840
 who woke up during the earthquake stayed up

438
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,600
 for the rest of the night,

439
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,480
 even though it went off at 3 a.m.

440
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,320
 - Oh, really?

441
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,320
 - Yeah, that's a great thing.

442
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,160
 - Yeah, that's a great thing.

443
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,520
 - Just a way that you can take information

444
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,640
 that was for another thing and then work out

445
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,520
 how humans react to something.

446
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,520
 - Yeah.

447
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,400
 - You mentioned California and the sun.

448
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,360
 So, relatedly, there's a big solar plant in California

449
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,960
 and when birds fly over the top of it,

450
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,400
 often they catch fire because the sun's crazy,

451
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,880
 so concentrated, so then they've called them streamers,

452
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,680
 the guys who work there and these birds fly through

453
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,880
 and cat ignites to spontaneously combust mid-flight.

454
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,720
 - Wow.

455
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,560
 - And set on fire.

456
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,400
 It's really sad.

457
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,240
 - Yeah, it's very sad.

458
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,880
 They've got to freak out mid-flight.

459
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,640
 Like, that's never happened before.

460
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,480
 - Yeah.

461
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,760
 - You're on fire.

462
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,600
 - Oh, thank you.

463
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,800
 No, no, you're on fire.

464
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,640
 - You're on fire.

465
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,640
 - Literally.

466
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,760
 (upbeat music)

467
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,400
 - Okay, time for fact number three.

468
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,840
 And that is Chazzynstee.

469
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,200
 - Yeah, my, in fact, is that there are some birds nest

470
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,200
 that contain over a hundred rooms

471
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,560
 and are so heavy that they cause trees to fall down.

472
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,400
 - What?

473
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,760
 - Yeah, so these are really cool.

474
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,760
 This is my new favorite creature, I think,

475
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,600
 the sociable weaver bird,

476
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,280
 which you find in Southern Africa

477
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,520
 and South Africa, Botswana, places like that.

478
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,400
 And they are really sociable,

479
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,440
 so they build these gigantic nests

480
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,240
 where up to 400 birds will live in one nest

481
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,160
 and they have loads and loads of different chambers.

482
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,520
 And they're incredibly efficient

483
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,920
 for a bunch of different reasons,

484
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,520
 but they do weigh an enormous amount.

485
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,360
 And so--

486
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,680
 - Trees will collapse.

487
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,320
 - Yeah, trees are tree-recently collapsed

488
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,920
 under their weight, so they can weigh almost 1,000 kilograms,

489
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,840
 which I think is about as much as 12 adult men.

490
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,760
 So if you stick 12 adult men in a tree,

491
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:34,080
 it's likely sometimes the branch is gonna break and it did.

492
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,600
 The desert where most of these birds live

493
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,160
 is obviously very hot in the daytime

494
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,440
 and gets very cold at night.

495
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:41,760
 And it's insulated so that if you go right into the middle

496
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,840
 of this nest where they all roost together,

497
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,600
 then it's much warmer at night,

498
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,000
 like more than 10 degrees warmer than it is in the daytime.

499
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,520
 And then in the daytime, if you hang out

500
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,600
 in the outside chambers,

501
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,920
 it's more than 10 degrees cooler than it is in the daytime

502
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,000
 'cause it's so well-shaded.

503
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,840
 - Wow.

504
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,040
 - Do they have different rooms for different things?

505
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,520
 Or do they have their own rooms and stuff?

506
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,040
 - They all-- the pairs have their own rooms,

507
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,760
 so each room will be a pair and sometimes they're offspring

508
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,440
 and then in the center will be where they all sleep together.

509
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,280
 - It's like a hotel.

510
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,600
 - It really is, it's incredible.

511
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,440
 It is like--

512
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,280
 - Wow.

513
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,280
 - And it's not just that.

514
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:12,520
 - Is it the other birds live in there as well?

515
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,360
 - Yes.

516
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,760
 - I saw a list of some of the other birds

517
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:18,240
 who live there, they include the familiar chat.

518
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,520
 (laughing)

519
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:24,640
 The ashy tit and the rosy faced love bird.

520
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,920
 - Oh.

521
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,480
 But yeah, they do, they let other birds live in them,

522
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,800
 which I think is also great of these guys.

523
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,040
 When they've got a spare room going,

524
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:31,960
 they say to their mates,

525
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,040
 "Hey, you can be asked to build a nest, don't worry."

526
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,040
 - So they're like a hostel.

527
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:35,880
 - Yeah.

528
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:36,720
 - It's like Airbnb.

529
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,560
 - Yeah exactly.

530
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,880
 - Badgers do that as well, don't they?

531
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,720
 - Today.

532
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,640
 - Yeah, 'cause badgers have sort of like a very similar

533
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,040
 to a rabbit hole, but it's,

534
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,720
 'cause rabbits only let rabbits in,

535
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,160
 but badgers are like, if they see a rabbit,

536
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,600
 they'll be like, "Come on in mate, show us."

537
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,040
 Yeah, yeah, and they let them live with them, yeah.

538
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,520
 - Are you sure this isn't a watershed down?

539
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:55,080
 Or might be windin' the willows of the birds, yeah.

540
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,660
 Badger, they all wear tweed, right?

541
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,280
 - Prairie dogs, we've done on QI as well,

542
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,800
 quite sensibly, and they're quite similar to these birds,

543
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,000
 and I also like them for it, aren't they?

544
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,640
 'Cause they have enormous burrows, prairie towns,

545
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,440
 I think they're called.

546
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,320
 So they're smaller than they used to be,

547
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,480
 'cause they're now more in danger.

548
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,840
 But in 1900, a prairie town was found

549
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,880
 that took up 25,000 square miles and housed

550
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,720
 400 million prairie dogs.

551
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,880
 But that's how many?

552
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,880
 - 400 million.

553
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,560
 - 400 million.

554
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,840
 (laughing)

555
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,280
 - Are you hearing the number?

556
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,880
 - That's like the population of America, isn't it?

557
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,720
 - Yeah.

558
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,560
 - So you've got--

559
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,560
 - You've got prairie dogs in America, then, yeah.

560
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,040
 - That's amazing.

561
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,560
 In one house.

562
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,000
 (laughing)

563
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,880
 - It's in a book called Prairie Conservation,

564
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,440
 preserving North America's most.

565
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,160
 - Why do they need to go out of service?

566
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,000
 (laughing)

567
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 - They need to go out of service.

568
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,240
 - They need it in every single house.

569
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,240
 - They're doing good.

570
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,760
 (laughing)

571
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,760
 - But they let other animals live in their homes as well,

572
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,200
 so you get burrowing out.

573
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,360
 - How is the ready room?

574
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,600
 (laughing)

575
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,000
 - Come on out, squeeze in.

576
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,440
 - Let's go back to Nests.

577
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,280
 - Yeah, sure.

578
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,120
 - That was about Nests.

579
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,440
 - You were talking about the temperature of the Nests,

580
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,280
 how it flops you with?

581
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,120
 - Yes.

582
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,040
 - I found something great thing about temperature and Nests.

583
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,120
 The sex of an alligator and some other reptiles,

584
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,400
 like lizards and turtles,

585
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,920
 is determined by how warm the nest is that they're laden.

586
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:10,560
 So for alligators, if the egg is kept in a nest,

587
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,600
 it turns out female, and if it's 34 degrees,

588
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,520
 it turns out male.

589
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,360
 - Really?

590
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,200
 - Yeah.

591
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:21,080
 - So in 2009, some researchers found a geofalcon nest

592
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:26,080
 in the Arctic, and they did some radio carbon dating on it,

593
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:30,520
 and they found that it'd been in use for 2,500 years.

594
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:33,640
 So people have been living there since the Roman era,

595
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,360
 or birds have been living there for the second time.

596
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,160
 (laughing)

597
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,720
 - First just outside and get out of my house.

598
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,360
 - Wow, that's incredible.

599
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,200
 - Yeah, Dan, you've been away at the Edinburgh Festival.

600
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,040
 - Yes.

601
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,200
 - While you're away, Gregg Jenna came in,

602
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,000
 who was in one of our earlier podcasts.

603
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,280
 He's a historian from Horrible Histories,

604
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:53,520
 and we were talking about a human nest.

605
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,280
 It was like a mattress inside a cave somewhere in Africa.

606
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:02,040
 So this mattress was in use for 77,000 years.

607
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:02,880
 - Wow.

608
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,720
 - So many 7,000 years, I imagine how long that is.

609
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,320
 Like 2,000 years was like when Jesus was around.

610
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,480
 - When Jesus was around.

611
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,440
 - It was 77,000 years.

612
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,280
 - Is it still in use?

613
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,120
 - It's mattress.

614
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:13,960
 - Oh, no.

615
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:14,800
 - Okay.

616
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,200
 - I mean, we should keep the tradition going.

617
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,040
 - That's true actually.

618
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,040
 - Yeah, why do we stop?

619
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:21,280
 - They used moss, and they would put it in this corner of a cave.

620
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,240
 And then they'd use it for a while, for a while, for a while,

621
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,040
 and then they would burn it and put more moss on top,

622
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,120
 and then they would burn it and put more moss on top.

623
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,480
 And this moss was particularly good,

624
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,320
 because it would stop insects from being able to live there.

625
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,720
 So it was a really good place to sleep.

626
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,520
 - But also, so you're saying it's the exact same bed,

627
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,360
 effectively?

628
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,960
 - Because they just kept adding different bits of the mattress on top.

629
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,200
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, wow.

630
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,680
 - And they almost never changed the bedding.

631
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,520
 We did ask about it.

632
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,760
 It was only about every 2,000 years or something

633
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,960
 that they bothered even changing the moss.

634
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,120
 - Just on the subject of mattresses, I was reminded,

635
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,960
 there's a trap door at the bottom of the blue whale

636
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,520
 and the natural history is even London.

637
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,800
 When they opened it up, they discovered a mattress in there.

638
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,600
 And it was basically a time capsule inside the blue whale,

639
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,080
 because it was when they were building it,

640
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,080
 where all the workmen would sneak in.

641
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,160
 So they found a bunch of magazines and newspapers

642
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,640
 and empty wrappers, but also a mattress,

643
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,880
 because apparently horny curators,

644
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,880
 that used to be a top location.

645
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,080
 - I can't believe they went to that sort of trouble.

646
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:20,920
 - Think about it.

647
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,520
 If you're someone who works at the Natural History Museum,

648
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,480
 you're already quite a big dork.

649
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:29,560
 And so the idea of sex inside a blue whale, yes please.

650
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,560
 I mean, even I think that that's the best possible location.

651
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,320
 - The problem with the mattress.

652
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,760
 - I don't know why they need a trap door,

653
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,800
 because a blue whale's vagina is large enough to walk through.

654
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,800
 - That's such a good point.

655
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,840
 - Maybe it's a male blue whale.

656
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,680
 - Yeah.

657
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,520
 - Oh, that's probably it.

658
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,840
 - I was just gonna talk really quickly about the weaver birds,

659
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,080
 just because they often now build their nests

660
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,720
 on telegraph poles and pylons.

661
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,920
 So you'd recognize their nests.

662
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:51,280
 And anyway, this often causes power outages.

663
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,320
 So I was looking at animals that cause power outages

664
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:56,360
 and squirrels are always cutting off electricity.

665
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:59,400
 So there are some electricity companies that say that

666
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,640
 two-thirds of their electricity outages

667
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,680
 just come from squirrels chewing through wire

668
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,920
 or like linking up circuits by jumping from one bit to another.

669
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,200
 And they've shut down the Nasdaq twice.

670
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,520
 I think an estimated $20 million worth of shares

671
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,240
 were not traded in that time.

672
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,080
 - $20 million.

673
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,200
 - Okay, guys, numbers can be big.

674
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,200
 Let's get over that.

675
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:25,640
 - Time for the final fact of the show, James.

676
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:29,200
 - Okay, my fact is the worst baseball team in South Korea

677
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,280
 has replaced its supporters with robots.

678
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:35,320
 So these guys are called the Hanwai Eagles.

679
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:38,840
 They've lost more than 400 games in the last five years.

680
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,320
 They came bottom of the league in the last two years

681
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,760
 and their opposition have started calling them

682
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,840
 the Hanwai chickens because they don't put up any kind of fight.

683
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:50,280
 What they do is they have these screens around the pitch

684
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,640
 and you can, using your computer or your phone,

685
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,520
 you can put your photo on the screens

686
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,960
 and you can make the screens do Mexican waves

687
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,160
 or do cheers or chants or whatever.

688
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,320
 I just think that's quite a--

689
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,160
 - That is cool.

690
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,520
 - That's so sad, isn't it, though?

691
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,400
 - I mean, so the players, and it's the idea

692
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,640
 that the players are supposed to feel rejuvenated

693
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,480
 at the site of automated things

694
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,120
 which are being forced mechanically to cheer them on.

695
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,400
 - Yeah, I think it's solving like that.

696
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,240
 - Yeah.

697
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,400
 - I think it's a bit demoralizing.

698
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,320
 - It's solving the wrong problem.

699
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,440
 Like it's, the problem is the bad team,

700
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,200
 not that the fans are booing because they suck so much.

701
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,800
 It's like, do you know what we got to solve about this?

702
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,240
 Our fans, they're the problem.

703
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,600
 - Let's invest all our money in futuristic robots.

704
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,800
 - Let's invest all our money to cheer as we lose

705
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,280
 again and again and again.

706
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,840
 - Okay, so here's another way of using your fans,

707
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,880
 maybe a slightly better way.

708
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,480
 You guys don't like the robot thing.

709
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,320
 - I like the robot thing.

710
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,320
 I just think it's not solving an issue.

711
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,520
 - Well, the Washington Bullets had this superfan

712
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,520
 called Robin Ficker.

713
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,200
 And what they would do with him is they'd let him sit

714
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,400
 behind the opposing coach's bench

715
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,600
 and they would give him a megaphone

716
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,520
 and he would make fun of the opposing team

717
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,360
 by shouting at them.

718
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,480
 So he would make fun of the coach's outfits

719
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,720
 or when the Chicago Bulls came to play,

720
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,000
 he read the sex passages of the Bulls'

721
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,760
 coach's autobiography.

722
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,840
 - That's him, Jeremy and the game.

723
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:13,200
 - Wow, he's distracting.

724
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,800
 - I was looking up robots and death.

725
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,000
 And I found out that Jeremy Clarkson

726
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,280
 was really killed by a robot was.

727
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:23,080
 Apparently one of the robots was fighting another robot

728
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:26,080
 and a circular blade came loose and zoomed across the studio

729
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,600
 and there you had it on film

730
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,800
 and they played it back in slow motion

731
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,240
 and it went across his head two inches above his scalp.

732
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,480
 - Whoa, sorry, yeah.

733
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,760
 - We actually know who the first person

734
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,760
 would be killed by a robot.

735
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,200
 And his name was--

736
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,720
 - Robbie Williams. - Robbie Williams.

737
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,560
 - Yeah.

738
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,400
 - How was he killed by robot?

739
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,600
 It was in a-- - He was in a calf factory

740
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,760
 or something like that and he was in fog factory

741
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,080
 and he was hit by a protruding arm

742
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,800
 and he was killed by that.

743
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,000
 - So it was like, 'cause it was an arm,

744
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,080
 kind of was a robot.

745
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:52,920
 - Yeah.

746
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,160
 - Well, it was a big mechanical device.

747
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,120
 It was for moving car parts from one end

748
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,200
 to the factory together

749
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,120
 and it just, he got hit on the head really hard to it.

750
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,320
 The second guy who got killed by robot,

751
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,680
 definitely got killed by a robot.

752
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:05,960
 His name was Kenji Rada and that was two years later

753
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,840
 and he got pushed into a grinding machine by a robot arm.

754
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,080
 - Ooh. - Yeah.

755
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,200
 - Like was it a malicious intent?

756
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,680
 - So there's never been a malicious intent.

757
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,680
 There is an innate human fear of robots.

758
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:18,600
 The first use of the word robot was in a plague

759
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,440
 by Czech playwright Carol Kappett

760
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,240
 called Rosam's Universal Robots

761
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,400
 and it was about robots trying to take over and kill people.

762
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,520
 - 9% of Americans, when surveyed,

763
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,880
 admit that they will have sex with a robot.

764
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,200
 - I would have sex with a robot.

765
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,960
 - So was that book called Sex and Robots,

766
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,760
 which it's a guy who's a huge computer scientist

767
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,960
 and chess champion saying that he thinks

768
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,760
 will have sex with robots within 50 years?

769
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,840
 - Well, he's one of the 9%.

770
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,000
 - Yeah, definitely.

771
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,520
 - They did have the first kissing robots in 2008.

772
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,640
 They were made in Taiwan

773
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,120
 and they performed as the stars in Phantom of the Opera.

774
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,120
 They did an all robots cast for Phantom of the Opera

775
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,480
 and these two robots kiss

776
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,360
 and it's the worst kiss you've ever seen.

777
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,320
 Their heads come together

778
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,640
 and then they pause for 10 seconds

779
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,680
 and their heads pull apart.

780
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,360
 It's like at a 12 year old's disco.

781
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,560
 - Empathetic robots are a thing

782
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,680
 that just been experimented with

783
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:05,320
 and they've sort of are claiming they've invented

784
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,240
 where their robots that respond

785
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,560
 to your own facial expressions

786
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,360
 with matching facial expressions

787
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,400
 and they're preparing, why are you smiling?

788
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,640
 - It's really creepily.

789
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,480
 - Sorry.

790
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,760
 - Okay, I'm gonna start looking at you.

791
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,880
 So they've come up with empathetic robots now

792
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,640
 who's faces top of everybody.

793
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,200
 They've come up with empathetic robots

794
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,680
 who's faces mirror the facial expressions that humans have

795
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,200
 in the hope that they can care

796
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,640
 for lonely humans in future

797
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,520
 but again, a bit like the fake cheering crowds in career.

798
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,240
 It seems like a sad thing if you need a robot

799
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,520
 to fake empathetic facial expressions

800
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,600
 in order to feel okay.

801
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,760
 - Our buddy, Leven Skyra,

802
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,680
 who was on this podcast a few episodes ago,

803
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,680
 just actually took part in the opposite version

804
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,520
 of what we're talking about,

805
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,000
 which was the World Robot Football Cup.

806
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 - Oh yeah.

807
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 - And he went out to Brazil, I think.

808
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,240
 It was in Brazil. - Yeah, it wasn't Brazilian.

809
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:56,080
 - And so it was robots playing against each other

810
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,280
 at football and Leven was saying

811
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,960
 that they've projected that within 50 years,

812
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,360
 a robot football team will be able to beat

813
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,520
 a human football team.

814
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,800
 - Within two months they'll be able to beat Man United.

815
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,800
 (laughing)

816
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,280
 Did you see, so if you've seen this,

817
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,120
 - No, I haven't.

818
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,040
 - So we're recording this on Wednesday,

819
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,800
 but on Tuesday, Man United played against MK Duns

820
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,560
 who are lower in the third tier of English football

821
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,120
 and they lost four nil.

822
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:19,960
 - Whoa.

823
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,720
 - And there was a great thing on Twitter.

824
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,360
 There was a girl who'd got a free bet

825
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,280
 from an online betting site

826
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:29,280
 and she put two pound 50 on Man United to win four nil.

827
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:32,800
 But it accidentally put two pound 50 on MK Duns

828
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,760
 to win four nil at 500 to one.

829
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,600
 - Wow.

830
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,440
 - Wow.

831
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,440
 - And she was like, "Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God,

832
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,120
 "I've won over a thousand pounds."

833
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:41,960
 - That's great.

834
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,080
 - Anyway, let's talk about, oh, we'd like to talk about.

835
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,600
 - I was gonna talk about sports fans

836
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,840
 since we're on sports now.

837
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,680
 So I was looking at generally sports fans,

838
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,480
 one of them using things I like that's happened

839
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,040
 in the past is that during baseball matches

840
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,760
 until about a hundred years ago,

841
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,760
 'cause the stadium was smaller.

842
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:01,040
 If you hit the ball out of the stadium,

843
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,640
 it would fall into the long grass

844
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,960
 and the game had to stop for five minutes

845
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,080
 and everyone, the fans and the players

846
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,520
 had to spend five minutes searching for the ball

847
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,000
 because they wouldn't have lots of spare balls.

848
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,600
 I think now in baseball balls just get lost

849
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,480
 and that's it, they have, they bring spare.

850
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,560
 - People take them, don't they?

851
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,400
 - Yeah.

852
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,240
 - What do you get to, if it comes out and you catch it,

853
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,080
 it's your ball.

854
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:18,920
 - Yeah.

855
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,760
 - That's how it works.

856
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:20,760
 - It's another thing about old baseball games

857
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:23,800
 where they didn't have as many umpires in those days.

858
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,760
 And some of the umpires were allowed to,

859
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,880
 if they weren't quite sure about a decision,

860
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,080
 they're allowed to consult the audience,

861
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,280
 consult the crowd.

862
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,320
 - I can't want to be a millionaire.

863
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,320
 - Yeah, exactly.

864
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,840
 And see what the crowd thought

865
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:37,840
 and then use their ideas if they couldn't really work it out.

866
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:41,160
 - 92% of the audience thinks that that was a home run.

867
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,640
 - God, must have sucked when you were playing away games.

868
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,480
 - Yeah.

869
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,640
 - If you plainly made it and you just missed it,

870
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,480
 did you make it?

871
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,320
 - No.

872
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,840
 - Definitely not.

873
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:51,040
 - So I think the angriest any sports fans

874
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,080
 have ever been and James will know about this

875
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,800
 and it must be during the Heidi game.

876
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,720
 - Is that the Kevin Courage game?

877
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,560
 (laughs)

878
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,560
 - Heidi goes Seeky.

879
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,400
 - Yeah.

880
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,280
 - I don't think I know about the Heidi game.

881
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,120
 - It's so good.

882
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,800
 And it is frequently voted the most exciting game

883
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,200
 for American football of all time.

884
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,400
 It was Oakland Raiders versus New York Jets.

885
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,520
 And it was really close.

886
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,760
 The New York Jets were just ahead of the Oakland Raiders,

887
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,000
 but it was obviously a really thrilling match.

888
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,800
 It had about three minutes left.

889
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,480
 And suddenly at the very last minute,

890
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,040
 the Oakland Raiders overtook the New York Jets

891
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,560
 and they won and it was a massive title

892
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,000
 and it was a massive deal.

893
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,880
 And NBC, the network that was broadcasting it,

894
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:26,920
 as it had overrun by a couple of minutes past its three hours,

895
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,880
 switched over automatically to show Heidi

896
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,680
 for all the kids on the other channel.

897
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,240
 Now, they didn't want to do this.

898
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,920
 The NBC executive saw that it was a really thrilling match

899
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,800
 and we're like, we've got to obviously keep this on the airwaves.

900
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,640
 So they tried to call the studio to say,

901
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,040
 obviously keep the match on, guys.

902
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:40,880
 Look at this.

903
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,800
 This is the biggest match ever.

904
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,840
 But so many people, so many angry fans

905
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,760
 were trying to call the studio to say,

906
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,720
 I can't believe you're going to switch over to Heidi.

907
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,560
 It's outrageous.

908
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,840
 I want to watch the rest of the match.

909
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,000
 That their phone lines broke down and the executives

910
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,760
 couldn't get through to the studio to say, keep it on.

911
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:59,160
 So in the great irony of fan complaints,

912
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:02,000
 they caused Heidi to overtake the match

913
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,680
 by calling breaking the phone lines and Heidi came on.

914
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:07,200
 And then NBC managed to irritate people further,

915
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,200
 I think, by during this episode of Heidi,

916
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,920
 there was a really touching scene

917
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:15,600
 where Heidi's disabled sister, I think, learns to walk

918
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,200
 and they thought, what can we do to remedy this?

919
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,760
 So they flashed up the score suddenly

920
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,280
 for the fans in the middle of high school.

921
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:25,600
 All these little kids suddenly tearing up at this scene.

922
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,600
 And they say it sounds like an homestay to Fergie, bro.

923
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:32,080
 My favorite baseball player, just before we finish,

924
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:35,280
 is Joe Sprintz, OK?

925
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:39,320
 And one of his rivals, another baseball catcher,

926
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,240
 had caught a ball that had been dropped

927
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,760
 from the top of a building.

928
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:45,960
 And he got a world record for the highest catch

929
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,720
 from a high point.

930
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,600
 So he decided that he wanted to beat this record.

931
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:55,240
 And so he got a friend to go up into a blimp.

932
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,560
 And someone was going to drop the ball

933
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,520
 from the top of this hot air balloon.

934
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,720
 And he was going to catch it.

935
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,400
 Oh, my God.

936
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,200
 OK.

937
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,360
 He caught it in the way that baseball players do

938
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,920
 with his mitt directly above his face.

939
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,360
 The ball hit his mitt.

940
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,720
 The mitt hit his face.

941
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,560
 And he fractured his jaw and lost five teeth.

942
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,600
 And apparently, he dropped the ball.

943
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,040
 Oh!

944
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,560
 And someone alongside him just went, "Stop hitting yourself!"

945
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,400
 "Stop hitting yourself!"

946
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:24,080
 OK, that's it for this episode.
