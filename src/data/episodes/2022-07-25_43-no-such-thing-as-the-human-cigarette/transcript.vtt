00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:14.080
 - Hello and welcome to another edition of No Such Thing

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.800
 as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.000
 from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.200
 My name's Andy and I'm sitting here

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.920
 with three of the regular elves,

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.000
 James Harkin, Alex Bell, and Anna Tajinsky.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.960
 And we've gathered our favorite facts from the last seven days

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.600
 and we're now going to talk about them

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.640
 in no particular order.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.040
 (upbeat music)

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.160
 First fact is Alex.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.920
 - Okay, my fact is cows have friends and they get sad

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.040
 when you separate them.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.960
 - Oh.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.360
 - How are they cow friends?

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.160
 - Yeah, so basically Northampton University did a study.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.640
 So cows are her animals obviously.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:52.640
 - Pascine.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.600
 (laughing)

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.600
 - Yeah, so they live in a herd but they get separated a lot

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.240
 because they need to be milk, they need to be taken

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.800
 into the vets, et cetera.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.800
 And Northampton University did a study where they looked

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.440
 at cows when they're in a field and monitored all their behavior

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.160
 to see which cows hung out with which other cows.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.320
 And then they separated them out into different combinations.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.760
 So sometimes they'd be removed from the herd in pairs

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.800
 and sometimes they'd be with a cow they'd never hung out

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.240
 with before or sometimes they'd be with their best friend.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.080
 (laughing)

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.080
 - I don't know how we could work to that.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.320
 - Bracelets, but they wear bracelets.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.320
 - Yeah.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.440
 And sometimes they were on their own

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.080
 and each time their heart rates

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.240
 and cortisol levels were monitored

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.480
 and from that apparently we can work out

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.240
 whether cows get stressed or not.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.440
 - And cortisol we should say is the stress hormone,

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:37.800
 is that right? - Right, yeah.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.080
 - Apparently there's quite a high level of stress

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.520
 with integrating into a new herd.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.920
 So if you take a cow and you put it into--

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.960
 - I was gonna say how stressful can it be being a cow?

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.280
 - Well, very.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.360
 - If you don't know what your demise is going to be,

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.000
 I would say very, but they don't.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.960
 - Given how little is going on in their lives,

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.560
 I think any change is pretty stressful.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.280
 I mean, if you're moving how from one field to the other,

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.320
 that's probably groundbreaking to them.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.160
 (laughing)

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.080
 You think about it then?

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.360
 - Yeah, so it's hard to tell if that counts as a friend.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.600
 - Yeah, we're kind of anthropomorphizing them, aren't we?

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.560
 - Yeah, I think elephants always feel like they're the ones

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.680
 that we're most justified anthropomorphizing

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.640
 'cause they only have a weirdly human attitude

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.000
 towards their dead, don't they?

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.840
 - They mourn, don't they?

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.160
 - Yeah, they mourn their dead

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.960
 and they bury them sometimes with leaves and earth

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.320
 and they'll come back to visit where the elephant died,

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.160
 the family member died.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.240
 - The thing about elephant graveyards is that a myth

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.960
 or is that real? - That is a myth, yeah.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.200
 - Yeah, so that's the idea that the elephants will go

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.200
 to a certain place to die and then you'll find lots of bones

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.240
 there because it's a special place for elephants.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.320
 - But you'd feel terrible if you were an elephant

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.000
 and everyone else said, "Hey, come on,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.200
 we're going to the elephant graveyard."

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.040
 And you said, "Why?"

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.360
 And they said, "No reason."

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.800
 (laughing)

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.840
 - That's like the cartoon, "The Daily Mash of the Turkey,"

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.720
 which is saying just before Christmas,

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.440
 it's a bubble speech bubble coming out of the turkeys

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.200
 mouth saying, "Hey guys, so are you doing any of the new year?"

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.040
 I agree.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.600
 (laughing)

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:00.440
 - Feel sad.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.280
 - But elephants, something really weird about elephants

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.360
 or on it is if you show them on piece of ivory

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.280
 and then a piece of wood, they get much more agitated

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.520
 by the ivory and if you show them an elephant skull

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.880
 and then the skull of another large animal,

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.560
 like a hippo skull, they're much more agitated

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.760
 by the elephant skull.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:14.600
 - Really?

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.680
 - Elephant skulls are quite scary though, aren't they?

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.680
 'Cause they have like a big hole, yes.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:19.520
 - That is true.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.360
 - The idea is that's where Cyclops myth might have come from.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.440
 'Cause it looks like there's a massive eye hole

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.320
 in the middle, but actually it's where the trunk comes out from.

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.040
 - Cows skulls only have, they only have bottom teeth.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.440
 So we have two sets of teeth, obviously,

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.760
 is in the top teeth and bottom teeth.

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:35.760
 They only have bottom teeth.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.000
 Where the top teeth should be,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.840
 there's just a sort of long area of bone.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.680
 So they grind up what they eat with teeth, yeah.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:43.880
 - Cows don't have upper teeth.

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.560
 - So I was basically, I was looking into

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.680
 how the digestive system of a cow,

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.480
 so they're ruminants, which means that they basically

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.480
 ferment the grass first.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.040
 So they pick up the grass by,

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.800
 they actually curl their tongues round the grass

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.080
 instead of ripping it up with their teeth,

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.200
 which I thought it was really interesting.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.760
 Then they chew it, then it goes down into their stomach

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.320
 and sits there for a while and ferments for a bit.

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.400
 So they get nutrients out and then they regurgitate it

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.800
 back into their mouths and chew it some more,

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.760
 which is the ruminating, but, and that's cods now.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.400
 So that's where chewing the cod comes from

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.680
 and then they sort of get again.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.160
 - Winding your tongue around the rate of grass

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.480
 is quite sexy, isn't it?

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.280
 (laughing)

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.960
 - I've never seen a woman before yourself.

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:22.080
 - You know, I've never seen a woman doing that.

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:23.560
 - I need to go on more picnics.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.840
 (laughing)

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.760
 - I bet cows tie cherries and knots as a final.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:29.760
 - Oh yeah.

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:30.880
 - And that's what I was thinking of.

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:31.720
 - What's that?

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:32.960
 - You know, when you tie a cherry and a knot

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.400
 with your tongue and then that kind of shows that you're--

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.720
 - Yeah, cherry stock.

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.400
 - That sounds incredibly difficult.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.240
 I don't think it was that good.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.080
 - It's not that hard.

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.920
 - My brother can do it.

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:41.760
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.120
 - It's not that hard as well.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.560
 - Once you learn how to do it, it's pretty easy.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.280
 And you're a babe back then, then.

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:47.120
 (laughing)

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.960
 - I can also pick up blades of grass with my tongue.

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.600
 (laughing)

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.520
 - And another animal which has friends is sharks.

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.520
 If you can believe sharks have friends.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.120
 - I don't believe that.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.640
 - Oh, okay, some scientists analyzed a group

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.400
 of a particular species of sharks,

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.240
 which swim around together.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.960
 And they couldn't work out if they were swimming together

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.040
 because there were just food sources,

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.800
 which were close to each other,

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.320
 or the home ranges were in the same place.

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.000
 But they discovered that actually some shark

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.440
 preferred the company of certain other sharks

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.200
 and actively avoided other ones,

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.480
 even though they were all in the same area

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:21.440
 of their territories overlap.

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.960
 So they concluded these sharks basically have friends.

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.280
 - So that's what it should be.

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.360
 - It could be that they have friends,

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.600
 or it could be that they just have enemies

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:30.920
 and they're hanging around these other guys

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:32.080
 'cause they're not enemies.

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.160
 - What's the definition of an enemy or a friend?

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.200
 - True. - Yeah.

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.560
 - This is quite interesting.

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.280
 They're like, why would animals have friends?

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.200
 And there must be an evolutionary reason for it.

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:45.000
 And I read two possible explanations I'd never heard before.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.160
 So one of them was the enemy's enemy thing.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.760
 And evidence for that is in dolphins,

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:53.000
 who there were two dolphins who had avoided each other.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.680
 So they didn't particularly like each other.

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.480
 And then as soon as another dolphin came along,

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:57.600
 that wasn't part of their group

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.640
 and that was effectively an enemy to both of them,

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:01.480
 those first two dolphins started hanging out

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.080
 with each other became bestist buddies.

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.680
 'Cause suddenly they unite against their common enemy.

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.760
 - So what I feel is happening with this podcast actually

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.400
 and then you got and you were all ganging up

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:10.400
 on me and being horrible.

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.240
 - Shut up Alex.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:12.240
 - Okay, I'm sorry.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.600
 - The other good explanation I thought about

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.040
 why animals are friends to be attracted to the opposite sex.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:19.840
 So they studied McCax and there was a McCax

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.560
 who was super attractive for like really good physical build,

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.800
 et cetera, but he wasn't very good at making friends

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.280
 with other males and women stopped shacking him.

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.560
 So same as with humans I guess, if someone's unpopular.

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:32.440
 - Again, we need to say female McCax.

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.000
 (all laughing)

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.120
 - I think just going back to the dolphins for a second,

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.600
 they hang out in pods, I think, to feed though, don't they?

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.920
 Because they swim around in a circle

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:47.080
 making bubbles and trapping fish in those bubbles

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:47.880
 so that they can eat them.

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:50.840
 So that's kind of a useful reason for having friends.

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.160
 - Yes, yes.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.960
 - I think the smallest unit of dolphins is two or three males

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.960
 and they club up to guard the females basically

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.760
 that they perceive as being theirs.

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:02.760
 And then several of those little units

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:06.120
 will group together to steal females from other males.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.440
 But sometimes two of those, even larger units,

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:11.160
 will club up a format kind of coalition,

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.120
 even though normally they're rivals.

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:13.960
 - Wow.

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:14.760
 - Then there must come an awkward moment

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:16.800
 where the dolphins decide which one of them actually gets

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.360
 to copulate with the female.

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:21.720
 - Well, dolphins have a very varied sex life.

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:23.160
 - So they can all do it, you're saying?

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:26.160
 - Yeah, they have, they have blowhole sex.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.760
 And they have, they have all kinds of sex.

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:29.600
 Blowhole jobs.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:31.480
 (all laughing)

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:34.920
 Okay, there is one other sign that could be an indicator

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.080
 that animals are friends with each other,

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:38.280
 which is they measure the levels of oxytocin

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:40.760
 inside them, which is known in humans as the love hormone.

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:42.680
 And if you have it, you are more inclined

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.680
 to trust other people and love them.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:47.080
 And they tested, this is interspecies friendships.

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:48.320
 So that's very exciting.

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:49.640
 - Oh, like test Disney film friendships.

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:50.720
 - Yeah, exactly, yeah.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.480
 And they tested a terrier and a goat,

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:53.800
 which were both young males.

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:56.480
 And they were used to playing and having play fights

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:57.920
 and sort of playfully nipping each other

00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:59.320
 and rolling around and this stuff.

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:00.840
 And so they played for 15 minutes.

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:03.080
 And then after that, they measured the levels

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:05.800
 of oxytocin, the amount of oxytocin of the dog

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:09.640
 had increased by 48%, which they said suggested

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:11.440
 the dog was quite attached to the goat.

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:12.480
 (all laughing)

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:16.720
 However, the goats increase in oxytocin was 210%.

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.600
 And the authors of this said,

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:19.920
 we essentially found that the goat

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:21.560
 might have been in love with the dog.

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:22.720
 (all laughing)

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:24.480
 Which is a tragic, unrequited thing.

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:26.120
 (all laughing)

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:27.360
 It's so great.

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:28.720
 - Now that's sad.

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:29.720
 - Yeah.

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:30.560
 - Yeah.

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:32.520
 So animal friendship is most people thought

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:34.680
 that animals with big brains are more like to make friends.

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:36.320
 And they found that fruit bats can make friends as well.

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:37.560
 And they have tiny brains.

00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:38.440
 So that's quite confusing.

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:40.920
 But they found this because things like

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:42.920
 there was a pregnant fruit bat.

00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:45.280
 And they found that she was being groomed and hugged

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:48.000
 repeatedly by another bat who was unrelated to her,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.080
 another female bat.

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:50.320
 And then when she gave birth,

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:53.760
 then the other female bat who'd been grooming her

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:56.800
 and a third female fan-t her with their wings

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:57.760
 to keep her cool.

00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:58.600
 - Wow.

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.080
 - Just being nice to each other for no reason.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.360
 - I do have bats can fan each other with their wings.

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:03.840
 That's amazing in itself, I think.

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:04.680
 - Yeah, that is quite cool.

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:06.280
 - Now I wish I had wings.

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:08.920
 - Yeah, because that's a primary useful wings, isn't it?

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:11.160
 That's the best thing you can use if you keep yourself cool.

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:13.120
 (all laughing)

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:13.960
 - Wow.

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:14.960
 - You give it a try as well.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:15.800
 - I love it.

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:17.880
 - I love it if James is a bird just sitting there

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:19.400
 and I'm just going up to him James.

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:22.240
 Why don't you have a, oh, you can do that with them too.

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:27.080
 - D.H. Lawrence had a cow called Susan.

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:27.920
 - Degrees.

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:29.360
 - Yeah, which he loved and wrote so a lot about.

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:32.120
 And there's one other celebrity cow that I found.

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:35.200
 Elmpharm Olly, also known as the Sky Queen,

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:38.160
 was the first cow to fly an aeroplane to fly in an aeroplane.

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:41.080
 (all laughing)

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:41.920
 The Sky Queen was the first.

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:44.520
 - She struggled with landing for a while.

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:46.440
 She was at the controls.

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:48.000
 - That's how I got over the moon, right?

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.680
 (all laughing)

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:52.960
 - Yeah, so she was the first cow to fly in an aeroplane.

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:56.200
 It was in 1930 at the International Air Exposition in Missouri.

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:58.640
 A man called El's Worth Bunts became the first man

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.080
 to milk a cow mid-flight.

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:01.920
 Which he did in that flight.

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:06.520
 He parachuted calm some milk down to the spectators below.

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:09.120
 - That is the stupid one, brilliant thing.

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.120
 That's fantastic.

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:10.960
 - Right.

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:13.440
 - Another thing that, sorry, another thing that...

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:14.280
 - Oh my God.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:18.800
 - If that was intentional, then you're fired from the podcast.

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:23.040
 - Another thing that affects cow lactation is slow songs.

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:25.880
 Apparently if you play slow ballads to a cow,

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:27.240
 then their lactation increases.

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:29.840
 But if you play fast, clubby songs to a cow,

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:32.720
 I think it was described as Euro Club Classics.

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:34.040
 There's no effect on lactation at all.

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:35.800
 - What the Euro Club Classics are.

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:36.640
 - Yeah.

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:38.400
 - I fall 65, probably that one.

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:41.000
 - I'm a new, DVD, DVD, DVD.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:41.840
 (all laughing)

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:42.840
 Thank you very much.

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:45.420
 (upbeat music)

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:47.920
 - Okay, time for fact number two,

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:50.520
 which this week is James Harkin.

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:54.320
 - Okay, my fact is that it's illegal to take a selfie

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:57.520
 with a tiger in New York City.

00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:58.360
 - What?

00:10:58.360 --> 00:10:59.200
 - A big question.

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.360
 (all laughing)

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:01.880
 - Well, it kind of speaks for itself, really.

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:03.480
 This is a new law that's come in.

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:05.560
 And it prohibits direct contact

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:08.360
 between members of the public and big cats.

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:11.560
 So it's like with traveling circuses or that kind of thing.

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:14.000
 And really, it's that you're not allowed any photos,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.280
 but obviously the press have put it forward

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:17.800
 as no tiger selfies.

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:20.160
 Because apparently tiger selfies are a thing

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:21.960
 on our dating websites.

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:23.160
 - Yes, to make...

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:24.680
 I've just realized someone's told me about this.

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:27.120
 And to make men look extra manly, apparently,

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:29.400
 they photograph themselves next to big...

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:30.400
 - It's completely animal.

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:32.720
 - It's simultaneously manly and cuddly.

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:34.520
 Because you're cuddling a tiger, but it's a tiger.

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:36.000
 - Oh, no, Alex, we've done it, haven't you?

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.360
 - I have a, I haven't seen it.

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:40.120
 I have visited the blog, which I found this morning

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:41.640
 called Tinder Guys with Tigers.

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:43.200
 - But actually, thinking about it now,

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:45.160
 if you're next to a tiger,

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:47.720
 the tiger is big and manly and well, not manly,

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:50.560
 but big and powerful, and next to him,

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:52.560
 you're just going to look less powerful.

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:54.120
 So you want to be next to a really weak,

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:55.360
 like a hamster or something.

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:56.600
 - There's lots of baby tiger photos.

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:57.440
 - Ah, there.

00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:59.240
 - Or maybe women will be very disappointed

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:00.560
 on the eventual dates,

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:03.000
 'cause they assumed that it was the tiger in the photo.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.720
 (laughing)

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:07.840
 Well, this is the technique that was surely first

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:09.760
 patented by Vladimir Putin.

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:10.600
 - Oh, yeah.

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.840
 - Who has photos taken with every wild animal.

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:14.480
 - But they're many dead, aren't they?

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:15.840
 - No, there's a lot of the wild animals.

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:17.000
 - He does some hunting ones,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.560
 but it's genuinely Putin swimming with dolphins on the internet.

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:21.880
 - Dolphins who are previously enemies ganged off him again.

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:24.000
 (laughing)

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.720
 - He's trying to ban blow-hole sex.

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.840
 (laughing)

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:33.760
 - That's that I have, right there.

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:37.200
 - I was looking into history of selfies,

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:38.960
 'cause it seems quite like a modern thing.

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:40.160
 So I had a look.

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:45.160
 The earliest photograph of a person in American history

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:47.080
 is actually a selfie.

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:49.400
 It was taken by a guy called Robert Cornelius,

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:51.120
 and he took it in 1839.

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:52.240
 He was a lampmaker,

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:54.120
 and he was responsible for developing a process

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:57.320
 called Daggeropty, which was a short-lived photographic process

00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:59.960
 of some sort, which is probably during the 1840s.

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:01.760
 The process was so slow that he was actually able

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:03.680
 to set up the camera and then run into shot

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:04.640
 for about a minute or so,

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:07.360
 and then close the lens cap, which is quite, quite more--

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:09.080
 - And the photos were called Daggeroptyps,

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:10.920
 whether that was it.

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:12.440
 - Wikipedia describes the photo,

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:15.040
 which you can go and see as an off-center portrait

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:17.800
 of a man with crossed arms and tautled hair.

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:19.240
 So I reckon it would be pretty well on Instagram,

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:20.840
 'cause that's pretty close to the mark.

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:23.200
 For the first selfie, that's pretty well done.

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:24.040
 - Yeah.

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:26.680
 - Do we think that was the first self-portrait?

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:28.680
 No, 'cause people have been drawing themselves for years,

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:31.040
 but I had a look into what the first ever,

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:34.680
 there's a collection of lines in a cave,

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:39.680
 which may be a drawing of a face, 27,000 years old.

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:42.720
 - We're kind of assuming this is the same person who drew it,

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:44.160
 though, if we're saying it's a selfie.

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:46.600
 - Exactly, yeah, it's open to debate.

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:48.000
 - There are a few lines next to it

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.600
 that look a bit like a tiger.

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:50.920
 (laughing)

00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:52.960
 - 19th century portraits are fun.

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:55.240
 We talked about the headless photos.

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:57.000
 - Headless photos, so.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.880
 - So, yeah, Victorions like to photograph themselves

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:01.800
 headless, I think, and carrying their heads

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.120
 or with their heads and their laps.

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:05.680
 They managed to doctor photos from a really early time.

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:08.560
 So you get portraits from the 1850s and '60s

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:09.400
 with their head and their--

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:10.240
 - They were necessarily doctors.

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:11.680
 They were like illusions.

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:13.320
 - They actually didn't cut heads.

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:15.520
 - The photo was so prestigious back then

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:17.360
 that you would have your own head cut off

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:18.720
 to have a photo made of you

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:20.000
 so that it would look better.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:20.840
 - No, it only worked.

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:22.960
 - A lot of them would be, like, it's hard to describe,

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:24.400
 but there would be illusions.

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:26.360
 So you'd have two people in the photo,

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:28.760
 and one person would be sort of on the end of a table

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:29.840
 with their head resting on it

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:32.160
 and the rest of their body sort of out of shot.

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:34.680
 And then another person would be organized in a way

00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:36.160
 that you didn't look like their head was there

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:37.840
 and when you line up, it looked like their head was not

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:38.680
 where it's supposed to be.

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:40.240
 - Oh, that's very good.

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:42.320
 And have you heard of, have you heard of snap shooting,

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:44.040
 which was a game that people played?

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:44.880
 - No.

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:46.280
 - This is in the very early days of handheld cameras.

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:47.120
 It's so much fun.

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:48.640
 You had to escape while someone else tried

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:49.800
 to take a photo of you.

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:51.280
 - Oh, it's not cool.

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:52.360
 - That's quite good.

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:54.640
 - It's a bit like laser quest.

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:56.120
 - Yeah, but it's laser quest.

00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:57.600
 Well, you don't know the results for three days

00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:59.600
 until you've had the photos developed.

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:00.600
 - It sounds like a fun game.

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:03.320
 - This is really interesting, I thought.

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:07.640
 So, after National Geographic published its first wildlife

00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:10.120
 photographs in 1906 in the magazine,

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:13.200
 and two of the National Geographic Society board members

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:16.720
 resigned in disgust, 'cause wildlife photos.

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:18.800
 - They said it was becoming a mere picture book

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:20.920
 and that wasn't what the National Geographic was all about.

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:21.960
 - Wow.

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:22.800
 - Yeah.

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:23.640
 - A few more selfie things.

00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:26.400
 You know these selfie stick, yes, of course.

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:29.560
 There's a thing called a selfie stick, do you know what that is?

00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:30.760
 - A selfie stick.

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:33.720
 - Well, a selfie, I know, to my shame,

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:35.240
 is a selfie of your own bottom.

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:36.080
 - Yes.

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:37.760
 - So is a stick to take a photo of your own bottom?

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:38.600
 - That's right.

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:39.760
 - A self-colonist could be cute.

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:41.800
 (all laughing)

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:43.080
 - No, it's not that.

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:44.840
 - The article I read said,

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:47.360
 it's curiously out of stock at the moment,

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:49.280
 but is ostensibly a real product.

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:50.760
 So I'm not sure if it's even real.

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:51.600
 - Okay.

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:53.240
 - But the idea is that you hold it,

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:54.720
 and then it takes a picture of your bum,

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:56.960
 and then you can send it to people, presumably.

00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:58.200
 You want to see that kind of thing?

00:15:58.200 --> 00:15:59.520
 - Oh, Brave New World.

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:01.200
 (all laughing)

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:04.080
 - The Statue of Liberty is taking one continuous long selfie.

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:05.680
 I found this on Reddit today.

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:10.120
 There's her hand, which is holding up the torch.

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:11.280
 There's a camera video camera,

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:13.720
 which you can stream a live feed from online,

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:15.040
 and it's pointing down to her face,

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:16.040
 so she's taking one.

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:16.880
 - Wow.

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:17.720
 - That is great.

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:18.560
 - That is really good.

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:19.400
 - That's such a good fact.

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:20.240
 - Yeah.

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:21.320
 - Vain as women in the world.

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:22.160
 (all laughing)

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:23.320
 - Does anyone have more?

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:25.680
 - Some stuff about things illegal in New York.

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:26.520
 - Oh, yeah.

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:28.560
 - Okay, so it's strangely,

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:31.320
 it's illegal to honk your horn in New York City,

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:32.960
 unless it's an emergency.

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:34.680
 - So that's another still accuracy then,

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:36.560
 because anytime there's an establishing shot of New York,

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:37.400
 there's a soundtrack,

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:38.320
 there's lots of lots of hallways.

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:39.560
 - No, no, no, no, that's not true.

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:40.960
 - It's just that everyone's breaking the law.

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:43.080
 - All right, there's a constant state of emergency.

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:46.160
 (all laughing)

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:48.520
 It's also illegal for three or more people

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:49.920
 to dance in New York City.

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:50.760
 - What?

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:52.400
 - This is the rave laws that they have there.

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:53.920
 So what constitutes a rave?

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:55.200
 - Also in the same place.

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:57.240
 - Yeah, you can have a book in the appointment with the city.

00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:58.080
 - Can I dance now?

00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:00.320
 - But what do you mean in the same place?

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:03.080
 - It's okay if you're in your own home, actually.

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:06.200
 But it's gonna be the people in your home have to be yourself.

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:09.000
 People who live there are bona fide guests.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.120
 It's legal in churches.

00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:14.440
 And weirdly, it's also legal in premises licensed

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:16.840
 as retail cigarette dealers.

00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:18.360
 - The cigarette buying dance, yeah.

00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:20.200
 (all laughing)

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:22.720
 - So if you're in a bar and three of you are dancing?

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:24.640
 - You need a dancing license.

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:25.760
 - You need a dancing license.

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:27.680
 - All so the bar might have a dancing license.

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:29.640
 - Yeah, all the white constitutes an illegal rave.

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:33.280
 And also, pinball machines are illegal in a lot of America,

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:35.000
 but in New York until the 70s.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.160
 - Wow.

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:38.120
 - It was because it was kind of gambling.

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:40.960
 And in the 1940s, Mayor Lagadia smashed up

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:43.200
 a load of pinball machines in front of the press

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:44.880
 and threw them in the sea.

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:46.520
 - He threw the press into the sea.

00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:48.640
 (all laughing)

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:51.080
 - Recently, the Mayor of Riga drove a tank

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:54.480
 over an illegally parked car to make a point.

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:56.560
 Although he had illegally parked the car himself.

00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:59.680
 So it wasn't just a random illegal parked car.

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:01.120
 - Well, it was the point he was making

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:02.440
 that look at my big tank.

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:04.440
 (all laughing)

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:05.520
 - Yeah, clearly.

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:06.360
 - That's true.

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:08.320
 - Literally, it was parked properly.

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:10.320
 - Big issues in Latvia.

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:11.160
 - What were we talking about?

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:12.120
 Hey, we're talking about it now.

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:13.560
 So it's worked.

00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:15.880
 - Yeah, actually, guys, I'm double parked out there.

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:17.000
 So I'm just gonna have to go

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.640
 before the bear of Riga get laid.

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:21.400
 (upbeat music)

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:26.240
 - All right, time for fact number three, which is Anna.

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:27.640
 - Yep, my fact this week is that

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:29.800
 Morgh refrigerators in Turkey

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:32.040
 are equipped with motion sensors, alarms,

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:34.320
 and handles that open them from the inside

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:36.320
 in case anyone in there wakes up.

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:38.480
 - Perfectly, perfectly sensible precaution.

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:39.320
 - I think so.

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:40.160
 - Does it happen?

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:41.000
 Ever?

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.040
 - I don't think there's been any instances,

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:45.040
 certainly not in that place of it happening.

00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:48.200
 But I think there's a widespread paranoia

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:49.160
 in that area of Turkey.

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:51.040
 It's in Malatia in Turkey.

00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:53.560
 And they have, yeah, so they've got like door handles

00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:54.400
 on the inside.

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:57.160
 There are sensors all around the inside compartment,

00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:59.560
 so that if anything touches the walls,

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:01.680
 then automatically the drawer comes open.

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:03.440
 So the corpse is free to leave.

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:06.480
 - But corpses move around a little bit, don't they?

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:08.160
 - Because of escaping gases,

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:09.920
 and I think eventually Riga wants to leave.

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:11.360
 - Absolutely, but not very much.

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:13.200
 - And also when they become zombies.

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:14.040
 - Yes.

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:15.040
 - That is a concern.

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:17.400
 - In which case, why have we built easy access?

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:18.720
 - Yes, it's easy access.

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:19.880
 - More compartments.

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:20.720
 - That's true.

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:22.160
 If the zombie apocalypse happens,

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:23.840
 these are gonna be the first guys out, aren't they?

00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:26.160
 - Yeah, and they'll let all the others out.

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:27.920
 - In the 19th century,

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:30.520
 there was no reliable indicator for death.

00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:32.920
 People did not know that it was your heartbeat.

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:34.240
 - But that's still kind of true

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:36.200
 because it could be brain activity.

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:38.240
 - That's true.

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:41.520
 - So I think actually there is a slight kind of argument

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:44.080
 about how you can actually say that someone's dead,

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:44.920
 whether it's the heartbeat,

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:46.760
 whether it's the brain activity or whether it's...

00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:47.600
 - Yeah.

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:48.440
 - It's almost like we know so much now

00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:50.720
 that we've blurred the boundary that we originally set.

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:51.560
 - Yeah.

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:52.840
 - Well, they just didn't have a boundary at all.

00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:53.920
 - They knew nothing at all of it,

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:57.400
 and they had competitions to enter

00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:59.440
 where you would be given 1,500 francs

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:02.120
 if you worked out an easy and reliable sign of death.

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:03.600
 The winner was the heartbeat,

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:05.360
 and it was the man Eugene Bouchou,

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:07.920
 who invented the stethoscope,

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:10.440
 and Eugene Bouchou sounds like

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:12.200
 what you might hear down a stethoscope as well.

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:14.240
 (all laughing)

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:15.080
 - But it was fantastic,

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:17.240
 and he got a lot of criticism for being so impetuous

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:19.080
 as to say that you could bury someone

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:22.240
 only two minutes after ascertaining that they were dead.

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:23.960
 Everyone else said, "No, no, no, no, you should wait,"

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:25.280
 and it took years.

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:27.560
 - Did you say that he invented the stethoscope, sorry?

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:28.400
 - Sorry, he didn't.

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:29.240
 - Ah, yeah.

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:31.480
 Because the stethoscope was invented by a guy

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:35.280
 who was embarrassed when he had to take the heartbeat

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:37.760
 of a particularly booksome lady, wasn't it?

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:39.120
 And the way that he used to do it

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:42.440
 was you would put your head right down next to someone's chest,

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:45.840
 and he was embarrassed to kind of go into the breast area.

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:47.160
 - So he left her alone.

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:49.200
 "Excuse me while I go and invent something."

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:51.560
 (all laughing)

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:52.640
 - I might be wrong about this,

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:54.600
 but I think he did it with a rolled-up newspaper

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:55.440
 or something, and thought,

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:56.960
 "Well, this works quite well,

00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:58.840
 and now I'm gonna make something even better."

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:00.200
 I might be wrong about the last bit.

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:01.040
 - I'm not sure.

00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:04.000
 - The other ideas suggested for the prize included,

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.800
 sticking a thermometer into the stomach

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:07.520
 to see if you were cold enough to be buried.

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:09.760
 - To the rectum, would be good.

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:11.600
 - I don't think anyone suggested that for this.

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:12.760
 - Because you've got two different ways.

00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:15.080
 One, the shock of having something up your bum,

00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:16.560
 and two, the temperature.

00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:17.400
 - Yes, yeah.

00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:20.120
 - Okay, well, they're not actually still taking

00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:22.720
 submissions, but I will pass it on.

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:24.160
 - Well, that?

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:27.000
 - They also had attaching pinces to the nipples

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.680
 of the brisium corpse.

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:30.160
 Scott, just burning the patient's arm

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:33.000
 with boiling water and seeing what happened.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.200
 Putting a multitude of leeches near the bottom,

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:38.480
 or sticking it to my wife.

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:40.680
 - Or sticking a very long needle with a flag at one end,

00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:42.120
 into the heart.

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:43.360
 And if the patient was alive,

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:45.480
 and there was any movement, the flag would wave a bit.

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:46.320
 - What?

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:47.560
 - And not for long.

00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:49.600
 - And then when he died, it would come down to half mass,

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:50.440
 doesn't it?

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:53.440
 - One doctor said that the patient's tongue

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:55.680
 should be rhythmically pulled for three hours.

00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:59.680
 - We should say, a lot of this is from a fantastic book

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:01.920
 by John Bonderson called "Berry Delive,"

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:04.560
 and it has a huge amount of unbelievably interesting

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:07.720
 information about this cultural fear over the centuries.

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:09.920
 - Since you mentioned putting stuff up the anus.

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:11.200
 In the late 18th century,

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:14.120
 doctors William Hawes and Thomas Cogan decided

00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:17.120
 the best treatment for someone who seemed dead

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:19.920
 after drowning was a tobacco enema.

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:22.960
 And so they used to shove things up your anus, didn't they?

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:24.440
 And that had like a dual purpose

00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:26.480
 of testing if someone was dead.

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:28.600
 - By giving you a nice hit of tobacco.

00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:30.120
 - Exactly.

00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:32.640
 And it was thought that, first of all,

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:34.680
 they would warm up the drowned person

00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:36.400
 by pumping tobacco up their bum.

00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:38.640
 And second, it was stimulate their respiration again.

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:41.600
 And it got a lot more popular when they started doing it

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:43.120
 with bellows, so they were a kid.

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:44.840
 So before this, they were just doing it

00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:46.760
 with their mouth to the barn.

00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:49.840
 - No, mouth to arse resuscitation.

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:52.000
 - Yeah, it was mouth to bone resuscitation,

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.000
 which is problematic.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.600
 'Cause a lot of people had died of illnesses,

00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:57.480
 which involve quite a lot of fecal matter being infected.

00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:59.240
 So quite a few people who tried this,

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:01.240
 doctors who tried this ended up dying themselves.

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:03.160
 - To be fair, they were supposed to blow, not suck.

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:04.960
 - Yeah, exactly, yeah, they did it wrong.

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:07.600
 - But then once that doctor's died, presumably,

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:09.320
 another doctor will come along and say,

00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:10.800
 "My god, this patient has died.

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:11.640
 I must resuscitate it."

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:13.440
 This is an awful chamber reaction.

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:15.120
 If you've just stuck tobacco up someone's ass,

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:16.560
 then you're going to suck instead of blow

00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:18.920
 because you've basically made a human cigarette.

00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:21.080
 - A human cigarette?

00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:23.160
 - It's going to be the sequel to the human's entity.

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:25.360
 - They used to hang those tobacco enema bellows

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:27.720
 up by the River Thames, where you would have life

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:32.720
 built today or life rings, they would just have as standard.

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:35.080
 - Have you guys heard of the Totenhaus?

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:35.920
 - No.

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:38.240
 - So these were literally that means house of the dead.

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:40.480
 Obviously that's their 19th century Germany,

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:41.320
 they're very popular.

00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:42.760
 These were basically large halls,

00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:45.480
 which are sometimes very lavish and are nearly decorated,

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:47.800
 in which bodies were kept for several days

00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:49.120
 to ensure that they were really dead.

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:50.480
 I think this is a pretty grim job.

00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:51.840
 If you were an attendant at this hall,

00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:54.400
 you had possibly had 12 hour shifts,

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:55.920
 waiting for any signs of life,

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:57.920
 terrifying, horrible job.

00:23:57.920 --> 00:23:59.600
 - But quite easy actually.

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:00.680
 - So what's a call?

00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:02.800
 - Not a lot of times at which anyone actually wakes up,

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:03.560
 I guess.

00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:06.160
 - Yeah, but if you missed that one time then, yeah.

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:08.560
 - If you fell asleep at like one, five minute window.

00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:10.120
 - When that zombie apocalypse happened,

00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:11.880
 they all came and I'm like,

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:12.880
 Jeff, what were you doing?

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:14.800
 You were supposed to be watching them.

00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:16.360
 - It just woke up as an empty hall and you're like,

00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:17.200
 oh, shit.

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:20.760
 - Yeah, the Paris Marg actually,

00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:23.680
 was around the turn of the 20th century,

00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:27.120
 it was arguably the most popular tourist destination

00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:29.360
 in Paris and that's at a time when

00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:31.360
 the Eiffel Tower was built as well.

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:34.960
 They were getting up to 40,000 visitors in a single day.

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:37.240
 - Did you start with mentalist items as well?

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:38.800
 They were in some weird tourist attractions.

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:40.960
 - Last week I was in Portugal and anyone who follows me

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:42.040
 on Twitter will know this already,

00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:45.080
 but I went to a bone chapel.

00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:49.320
 It was in Evora, which is the town in the middle of Portugal.

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:52.480
 And it was made by the monks and they took all of the bodies

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:56.440
 out of the town and then sort of put them on the walls

00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:57.720
 in like some kind of weird...

00:24:57.720 --> 00:24:58.560
 - Tiling.

00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:00.280
 - Yeah, it's like tiling, yeah.

00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:01.120
 - Wow.

00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:02.320
 - So it decorates the whole chapel.

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:04.240
 - The best thing about it was I took a photo of it

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:06.920
 and put it on Facebook and Facebook recognized the skulls

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:09.600
 and tried to make me tag with them as my friends,

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:11.280
 because they were people.

00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:12.120
 - That's crazy.

00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:13.520
 - So they've just got real skeletons?

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:14.920
 - Yeah, real skeletons, yeah.

00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:15.920
 - Hanging up.

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:17.520
 - And they have actual dead bodies as well,

00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:19.440
 but when we were there, the dead bodies

00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:22.000
 would be taken down for restoration.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.040
 (laughing)

00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:24.880
 - Yeah.

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:26.640
 - But it was supposed to be a place where you would go

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:29.320
 when you would think about your mortality and whatever.

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:31.080
 - So you know a memento moris?

00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:31.920
 - No.

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:34.280
 - Well, there are kind of things that remind us

00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:35.640
 that you're going to die, basically,

00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:39.480
 and that all this is temporary and all flesh is dust

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:40.240
 and all of this stuff.

00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:42.320
 So it's just something to remind you.

00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:44.840
 So in lots of many of the Renaissance pictures,

00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:48.120
 there's a skull there, just to point out you're gonna die.

00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:49.920
 (laughing)

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:51.400
 - Just like watching countdown.

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:52.240
 - Oh, can you hear that?

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:55.200
 - The memento mori and countdown could be the big clock.

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:56.480
 - Oh, that's crazy.

00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:57.960
 - Dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude.

00:25:57.960 --> 00:25:58.800
 - Dom.

00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:01.360
 (laughing)

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:02.200
 - Dom.

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:04.960
 (laughing)

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:06.640
 - Oh, basically, as well as a memento mori,

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:09.720
 there's also a memento vivare, which is a really nice thing.

00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:11.160
 It's a reminder that you are alive

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:12.360
 and to take pleasure in life.

00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:14.920
 And you don't really hear much about it.

00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:17.560
 - So there was a thread of people who worked in morturies

00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:19.480
 comparing their experiences.

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:22.200
 And there was someone who'd had a job in a mortuary

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:24.160
 and they got in someone who'd died,

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:25.440
 who'd been a hand model.

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:26.760
 And he said it was really weird,

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:27.960
 'cause he went into the service,

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:29.320
 the funeral service that they were having

00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:31.560
 and they have lots of photographs up all over the place.

00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:33.160
 And almost all of the photographs

00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:34.800
 were just of this person's hand.

00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:37.040
 (laughing)

00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:38.800
 - So it was a funeral of that character

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:39.800
 from the Adam's family.

00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:41.200
 (laughing)

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:42.960
 - That's a thing.

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:45.200
 - There was another one where a clown had died

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:47.760
 and the person was buried in full clown costume.

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:48.960
 The whole family were clowns.

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:50.240
 All the friends were clowns

00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:51.400
 and at the family's request,

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:54.160
 the funeral directors had to dress up as clowns as well.

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:58.000
 - Didn't the shoes not fit in the coffin?

00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.440
 - They put him in the coffin

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:00.880
 and all the sides fell out of it.

00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:02.600
 (laughing)

00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:05.200
 (upbeat music)

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:08.000
 - Okay, and the final fact is my fact this week

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.080
 and it is that Henry VIII had two official cradle rockers

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:14.840
 who were paid three pounds a year each to rock his cradle.

00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:17.560
 I should stress, this is when he was a baby.

00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:20.960
 - I had a great image in my head before you told me that.

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:22.200
 - Three pounds a year would have been a lot

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:23.600
 in those days, presumably.

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:26.160
 - It would have been more, but not a huge amount.

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:29.280
 - And also my question is, did they go in shifts

00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:32.640
 or did they need two people to rock one cradle?

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:35.120
 - Well, his cradle was massive.

00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:37.280
 It was five feet long and two feet wide

00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:38.320
 and this is the rocking one as well.

00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:39.720
 This isn't just a crib for a baby.

00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:41.920
 This is an actual rocking cradle.

00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:43.240
 Suspended from a wooden canvas

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:45.000
 covered with crimson cloth of gold

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.040
 and trimmed with ermine and it was ridiculous.

00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:50.520
 - Nice, it was Henry VIII, he went in.

00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:53.160
 - Well, not at the time, it was just a small baby at the time.

00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:54.880
 - His daughter, was it married the first time,

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:56.400
 even she had four cradle rockers?

00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:57.240
 - Four.

00:27:57.240 --> 00:27:58.160
 - Yeah, and she had two cribs as well.

00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:00.880
 She had an everyday cradle, which was silver and gold,

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:02.600
 I think, and then a cradle of estate

00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:04.760
 for special occasions for receiving visitors.

00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:08.160
 - The current queen has 733 cradle rockers.

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:09.240
 (laughing)

00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:11.320
 Just goes up every time because they want to outdo

00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:13.360
 to take this one.

00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:17.360
 - Ever the sixth was given a baby replicate of a court

00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:19.520
 when he was not yet one year old, he had a chamberlain,

00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:21.520
 a vice chamberlain, a steward, a cofferer,

00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:22.760
 lots of other stuff.

00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:25.400
 - They were, they weren't other babies.

00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:26.920
 (laughing)

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:28.480
 - That's a fantastic idea.

00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:29.320
 - Brilliant.

00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:32.960
 - Yeah, that's the most adorable thing I can think of.

00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:34.880
 (laughing)

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:37.520
 They're all dressed as what is a little Thomas Kramma baby

00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:39.120
 and there's a Walsby baby.

00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:40.240
 - That's how I imagine.

00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:41.720
 - Little CBB's is wrong.

00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:43.800
 (laughing)

00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:47.320
 - No, so when Henry VIII's first son was born,

00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:50.680
 he Henry appointed him 40 staff immediately,

00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:53.760
 including a baker and a keeper of the cellar for some reason.

00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:55.760
 - It would be brilliant if they were babies as well,

00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:56.600
 wasn't it?

00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:59.040
 - I just love this idea of just community of babies

00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:00.120
 looking up to you like a tiny bit.

00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:01.760
 - Yeah, maybe a miniature bocky and palace.

00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:05.560
 - This is the Muppet Babies of the Tudor Court, I don't like it.

00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:07.280
 - They didn't call themselves Tudor, did they?

00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:08.120
 Didn't like that.

00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:09.120
 - No, what is that?

00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:12.920
 - It reminded them of their Welsh background Tudor

00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:13.960
 and they didn't like that.

00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:16.800
 Henry VIII referred to himself as the embodiment

00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:19.760
 of the union of the families of Lancaster in York,

00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:20.760
 rather than Tudor.

00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:21.600
 - Tudor snappier, isn't it?

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:22.440
 - It is snappier.

00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:24.920
 It was like 100, 200, 200 years afterwards

00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:27.040
 when it became more common.

00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:30.400
 - Moving down the line, Queen Victoria.

00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:32.880
 Well, she sounds like she had a phobia of babies.

00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:35.520
 She described them as rather disgusting.

00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:37.480
 She described her own babies as frog-like

00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:39.320
 and frightful, went undressed.

00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:41.600
 And she had nine.

00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:43.440
 - I know, I know, I know, I know.

00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:44.280
 - Yes, you know.

00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:45.280
 - She's got a punishment.

00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:46.120
 - Yeah.

00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:47.640
 - She, when she was a baby,

00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:52.440
 her father described her as plump as a partridge

00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:54.520
 and more a pocket hercules and a pocket venus.

00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:56.200
 I think she was quite a fat baby.

00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:59.360
 - Hercules supposedly killed two snakes in his crib.

00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:00.200
 - Oh yeah.

00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:01.040
 - What did he do?

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:03.840
 - I heard some vengeful goddess release them

00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:04.680
 towards them, didn't he?

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:05.520
 And he smashed them together.

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:07.400
 - Is that where the rattle was invented?

00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:08.240
 - Yes.

00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:09.080
 - He killed the snake.

00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:10.200
 - So they were rattle snakes.

00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:11.040
 - So they were rattle snakes.

00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:12.520
 - And then he turned around and used them as rattle.

00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:13.360
 - And someone was like,

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:14.920
 if I take out the snake aspect of this,

00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:16.120
 it would make a great toy.

00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:18.080
 - But Queen Victoria, named Victoria,

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:18.920
 very controversial.

00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:20.600
 Victoria wasn't really a name in Britain at the time.

00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:21.760
 Was it?

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:22.920
 Not a girl's name.

00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:24.640
 And she was named after a mother who was German.

00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:27.080
 Got a lot of politicians and men at court

00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:28.200
 tried to make her change her name

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:29.760
 when she was going to exceed to the throne.

00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:30.600
 - What too?

00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:31.600
 - Some more conventional.

00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:33.800
 So I think Elizabeth was suggested originally.

00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:37.360
 - When the queen gave birth to Prince Charles,

00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:39.520
 Prince Philip was playing squash at the time.

00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:40.360
 - That was easy.

00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:41.200
 - Yep.

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:42.040
 - Did he leave the game?

00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:43.480
 - No, the queen was a name of the 30 hours.

00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:44.680
 But he played squash.

00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:46.160
 - That's a lot of game of squash.

00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:47.680
 - He must have been tired at the end of that.

00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:48.520
 - He is.

00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:50.480
 - Someone was taking care of it.

00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:51.320
 - Well he just comes together.

00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:52.960
 I'm exhausted.

00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:53.800
 What a day it's been.

00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:54.640
 How was your day?

00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:57.520
 - Do you know swaddling?

00:30:57.520 --> 00:30:58.360
 - Yeah.

00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:00.520
 - Which is where you just restrict babies very tightly

00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:02.200
 in their movements for the first few months of their life.

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:03.600
 It's incredible that this happened

00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:05.920
 and that we still happens around the world, I think.

00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:06.760
 - Yeah.

00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:08.600
 - Does it simulate woman environment, is that right?

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:09.720
 - I don't know.

00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:11.360
 And this used to happen.

00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:13.600
 Babies who were in their swaddling clothes

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:17.640
 would sometimes be hung up from a nail on the wall

00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:19.640
 which was to give their carrots,

00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:21.480
 so you'd just sort of loop a bit of the swaddling

00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:22.400
 over a nail on the wall.

00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:25.080
 And the baby would just be entertained by its surroundings.

00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:27.200
 This is according to the Victoria and Albert Museum.

00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:28.320
 To give their carrots a rest

00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:31.440
 and to entertain them with the surrounding environment.

00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:32.280
 - Like a boy.

00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:34.880
 - It's a really funny idea, like a wall mounted baby.

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:37.200
 - It'd be good if you had like sex tubulets

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:38.800
 and they were just hanging up around the hole.

00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:40.600
 - Yeah, or you could put them like plaster ducks,

00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:42.680
 you could put them going up in a diagonal line.

00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:44.400
 (laughing)

00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:45.240
 - It was phased out.

00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:47.400
 I think it was widely perceived as being bad

00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:49.200
 for the baby's health.

00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:50.040
 - Obviously.

00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:55.800
 - Cradles and cots.

00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:58.080
 The first, in fact, actually I was looking into cradles

00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:00.280
 and cots on my side accidentally looking into prams,

00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:04.080
 but the first pram was invented in 1733

00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:05.560
 and it was made to be pulled along.

00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:07.600
 So it was like a small pram and it had a harness.

00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:09.440
 So it could be pulled along by a goat or a dog.

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:11.040
 (laughing)

00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:11.880
 - That's adorable.

00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:13.880
 I imagine the mini Henry VIII baby

00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:15.680
 being pulled along by a dog.

00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:17.480
 - A dog and the goats who are best friends.

00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:18.800
 - Oh, god.

00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:20.120
 - It just needs film lines to tell.

00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:22.280
 (laughing)

00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:24.160
 - Pram is short for prambulator.

00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:25.000
 - Yeah.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.320
 - But there was no one walking, I guess.

00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:27.160
 - That's true.

00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:28.360
 - It was being pulled by an animal.

00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:30.480
 - Well, the dog and the goat would have been walking to it.

00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:31.320
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:32.880
 - Walking into our hearts.

00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:33.720
 (laughing)

00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:34.560
 - Jesus.

00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:36.120
 - They called the first prams,

00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:37.680
 that when prams started becoming popular

00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:38.960
 in the mid 19th century,

00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:40.400
 I think they were called male carts

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:42.160
 'cause they were based on design for male carts

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:44.760
 when you just push like big packages along.

00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:46.680
 - And 'cause female babies weren't loud in them.

00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:49.000
 (laughing)

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.120
 - I read that.

00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:52.760
 There's one book I've read this in and I can't find it verified,

00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:55.120
 but children's cots were initially used to be bassinets,

00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:56.280
 which would just sit on the floor.

00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:58.680
 And then they were raised off the floor due to a perception

00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:01.840
 that there were noxious fumes that existed below knee level

00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:04.680
 and explosive vapors that existed near the ceiling

00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:08.520
 and that the middle air of a room was the healthy air you had to breathe.

00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:09.800
 - Technically, isn't that true?

00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:11.240
 Because oxygen is flowerable,

00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:13.480
 so we need a top and calm dioxide is.

00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:16.400
 - It's the gas in the room just moves around too much

00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:17.240
 to use infection.

00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:18.080
 - Yeah, I know.

00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:18.920
 - If it was a very still room.

00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:20.400
 - We're onto the right idea

00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:23.640
 and we're killing our babies by leaving them on the floor.

00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:25.440
 It's very unusual putting babies in cradles,

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:27.080
 having them sleeping cradles and cots and stuff

00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:27.960
 in most parts of the world.

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:29.320
 It's really weird that we do that.

00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:30.160
 - So.

00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:31.240
 - Yeah, like vast majority of countries,

00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:33.360
 I think it's pretty much unheard of and babies just sleep

00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:34.280
 with their parents.

00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:37.560
 - Parents used to not really worry about washing their babies too much either.

00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:38.400
 - Oh yeah.

00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:41.720
 - Mothers in medieval times would dry nappies rather than wash them

00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:43.840
 and in the book I was reading about this,

00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:44.680
 a history of childhood.

00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:46.840
 This was because of the healing powers of urine.

00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:47.680
 - Right.

00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:50.000
 - And in bits of France,

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.800
 people thought that if you washed a child's head,

00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:53.720
 you would make it simple-minded.

00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:57.280
 And if you cut its nails and hair before it was a year and a day old,

00:33:57.280 --> 00:34:00.480
 it would be respectively mute and a thief.

00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:02.920
 - Being mute is good if you're a thief because you make less noise.

00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:04.720
 - It's a really good point.

00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:05.560
 - Okay, here's a thing.

00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:08.160
 That's what we might as well make sure it's safe as well.

00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:09.160
 - Please make sure it's safe.

00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:10.520
 - Okay, cut its nails then.

00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:12.280
 (laughing)

00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:14.080
 - Yeah, extraordinary.

00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:17.240
 - Can I just do one thing about an unusual job that I read today?

00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:19.280
 Okay, so I was reading a book early on.

00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:21.240
 It's called Sex on Earth.

00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:22.080
 - Sex and Earth.

00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:22.920
 - What is that?

00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:24.520
 - I think it's a big phrase.

00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:25.360
 - Sorry.

00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:28.000
 - They were talking about the way that horses have sex

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.600
 specifically in stud.

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:35.000
 So they have, a stallion will come in and have sex with a female horse.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.320
 And they were explaining how this happens.

00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:41.320
 And there is a guy who's one and only job is to hold the base

00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:45.560
 of the stallion's penis while it is in the mare's vagina.

00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:50.600
 And his job is to feel for the tell-tale throbbing of ejaculation

00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:52.360
 so that he knows when it's finished.

00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:53.200
 - Oh my goodness.

00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:54.600
 - Why does he need to know that?

00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:57.640
 - It's so they can stop the act.

00:34:57.640 --> 00:35:00.560
 - But surely it stops anyway in nature.

00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:03.920
 - That much of a hurry that we need to write the usual bits over.

00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:04.960
 - I was going to say it's a brilliant book.

00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:06.480
 It's by Jules Howard.

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:07.640
 It's absolutely real.

00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:09.560
 - But that's presumably why in nature,

00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:12.600
 you see a lot of skeletons of horses which have just died

00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:14.640
 because they didn't know when to stop having sex.

00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:21.640
 - Imagine how the stallion feels during all that.

00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:23.360
 In Paris, I presume.

00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:24.200
 - I don't know.

00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:26.280
 - I would if a horse turned up.

00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:27.280
 - That's it.

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:30.520
 - Hold it in the face, you can hear this in his face.

00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:32.400
 - Did you just say I'm a stallion in bed?

00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:34.640
 - No, I said there's a stallion in bed.

00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:40.160
 - Okay, that's all of our facts.

00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:41.560
