1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,600
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:14,080
 - Hello and welcome to another edition of No Such Thing

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,800
 as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,000
 from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,200
 My name's Andy and I'm sitting here

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,920
 with three of the regular elves,

7
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,000
 James Harkin, Alex Bell, and Anna Tajinsky.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,960
 And we've gathered our favorite facts from the last seven days

9
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,600
 and we're now going to talk about them

10
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,640
 in no particular order.

11
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,040
 (upbeat music)

12
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,160
 First fact is Alex.

13
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,920
 - Okay, my fact is cows have friends and they get sad

14
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,040
 when you separate them.

15
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,960
 - Oh.

16
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,360
 - How are they cow friends?

17
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,160
 - Yeah, so basically Northampton University did a study.

18
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,640
 So cows are her animals obviously.

19
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,640
 - Pascine.

20
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,600
 (laughing)

21
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,600
 - Yeah, so they live in a herd but they get separated a lot

22
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,240
 because they need to be milk, they need to be taken

23
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,800
 into the vets, et cetera.

24
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,800
 And Northampton University did a study where they looked

25
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,440
 at cows when they're in a field and monitored all their behavior

26
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,160
 to see which cows hung out with which other cows.

27
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:10,320
 And then they separated them out into different combinations.

28
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,760
 So sometimes they'd be removed from the herd in pairs

29
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,800
 and sometimes they'd be with a cow they'd never hung out

30
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,240
 with before or sometimes they'd be with their best friend.

31
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,080
 (laughing)

32
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,080
 - I don't know how we could work to that.

33
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,320
 - Bracelets, but they wear bracelets.

34
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,320
 - Yeah.

35
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,440
 And sometimes they were on their own

36
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,080
 and each time their heart rates

37
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,240
 and cortisol levels were monitored

38
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,480
 and from that apparently we can work out

39
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,240
 whether cows get stressed or not.

40
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,440
 - And cortisol we should say is the stress hormone,

41
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,800
 is that right? - Right, yeah.

42
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,080
 - Apparently there's quite a high level of stress

43
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,520
 with integrating into a new herd.

44
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,920
 So if you take a cow and you put it into--

45
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,960
 - I was gonna say how stressful can it be being a cow?

46
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,280
 - Well, very.

47
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,360
 - If you don't know what your demise is going to be,

48
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,000
 I would say very, but they don't.

49
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,960
 - Given how little is going on in their lives,

50
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,560
 I think any change is pretty stressful.

51
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,280
 I mean, if you're moving how from one field to the other,

52
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,320
 that's probably groundbreaking to them.

53
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,160
 (laughing)

54
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,080
 You think about it then?

55
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,360
 - Yeah, so it's hard to tell if that counts as a friend.

56
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,600
 - Yeah, we're kind of anthropomorphizing them, aren't we?

57
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,560
 - Yeah, I think elephants always feel like they're the ones

58
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,680
 that we're most justified anthropomorphizing

59
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,640
 'cause they only have a weirdly human attitude

60
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,000
 towards their dead, don't they?

61
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,840
 - They mourn, don't they?

62
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,160
 - Yeah, they mourn their dead

63
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,960
 and they bury them sometimes with leaves and earth

64
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,320
 and they'll come back to visit where the elephant died,

65
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,160
 the family member died.

66
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,240
 - The thing about elephant graveyards is that a myth

67
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,960
 or is that real? - That is a myth, yeah.

68
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,200
 - Yeah, so that's the idea that the elephants will go

69
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,200
 to a certain place to die and then you'll find lots of bones

70
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,240
 there because it's a special place for elephants.

71
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,320
 - But you'd feel terrible if you were an elephant

72
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,000
 and everyone else said, "Hey, come on,

73
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,200
 we're going to the elephant graveyard."

74
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,040
 And you said, "Why?"

75
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,360
 And they said, "No reason."

76
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,800
 (laughing)

77
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,840
 - That's like the cartoon, "The Daily Mash of the Turkey,"

78
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,720
 which is saying just before Christmas,

79
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,440
 it's a bubble speech bubble coming out of the turkeys

80
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,200
 mouth saying, "Hey guys, so are you doing any of the new year?"

81
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,040
 I agree.

82
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,600
 (laughing)

83
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,440
 - Feel sad.

84
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,280
 - But elephants, something really weird about elephants

85
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,360
 or on it is if you show them on piece of ivory

86
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,280
 and then a piece of wood, they get much more agitated

87
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,520
 by the ivory and if you show them an elephant skull

88
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,880
 and then the skull of another large animal,

89
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,560
 like a hippo skull, they're much more agitated

90
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,760
 by the elephant skull.

91
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,600
 - Really?

92
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,680
 - Elephant skulls are quite scary though, aren't they?

93
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,680
 'Cause they have like a big hole, yes.

94
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,520
 - That is true.

95
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:23,360
 - The idea is that's where Cyclops myth might have come from.

96
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,440
 'Cause it looks like there's a massive eye hole

97
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,320
 in the middle, but actually it's where the trunk comes out from.

98
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,040
 - Cows skulls only have, they only have bottom teeth.

99
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,440
 So we have two sets of teeth, obviously,

100
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,760
 is in the top teeth and bottom teeth.

101
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,760
 They only have bottom teeth.

102
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,000
 Where the top teeth should be,

103
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,840
 there's just a sort of long area of bone.

104
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,680
 So they grind up what they eat with teeth, yeah.

105
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,880
 - Cows don't have upper teeth.

106
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,560
 - So I was basically, I was looking into

107
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,680
 how the digestive system of a cow,

108
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,480
 so they're ruminants, which means that they basically

109
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,480
 ferment the grass first.

110
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,040
 So they pick up the grass by,

111
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,800
 they actually curl their tongues round the grass

112
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,080
 instead of ripping it up with their teeth,

113
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,200
 which I thought it was really interesting.

114
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,760
 Then they chew it, then it goes down into their stomach

115
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,320
 and sits there for a while and ferments for a bit.

116
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,400
 So they get nutrients out and then they regurgitate it

117
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,800
 back into their mouths and chew it some more,

118
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,760
 which is the ruminating, but, and that's cods now.

119
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,400
 So that's where chewing the cod comes from

120
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,680
 and then they sort of get again.

121
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,160
 - Winding your tongue around the rate of grass

122
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,480
 is quite sexy, isn't it?

123
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,280
 (laughing)

124
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,960
 - I've never seen a woman before yourself.

125
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,080
 - You know, I've never seen a woman doing that.

126
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,560
 - I need to go on more picnics.

127
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,840
 (laughing)

128
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,760
 - I bet cows tie cherries and knots as a final.

129
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,760
 - Oh yeah.

130
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,880
 - And that's what I was thinking of.

131
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,720
 - What's that?

132
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,960
 - You know, when you tie a cherry and a knot

133
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,400
 with your tongue and then that kind of shows that you're--

134
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,720
 - Yeah, cherry stock.

135
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,400
 - That sounds incredibly difficult.

136
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,240
 I don't think it was that good.

137
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,080
 - It's not that hard.

138
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:40,920
 - My brother can do it.

139
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,760
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

140
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,120
 - It's not that hard as well.

141
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,560
 - Once you learn how to do it, it's pretty easy.

142
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,280
 And you're a babe back then, then.

143
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,120
 (laughing)

144
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,960
 - I can also pick up blades of grass with my tongue.

145
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,600
 (laughing)

146
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,520
 - And another animal which has friends is sharks.

147
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,520
 If you can believe sharks have friends.

148
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,120
 - I don't believe that.

149
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,640
 - Oh, okay, some scientists analyzed a group

150
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,400
 of a particular species of sharks,

151
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,240
 which swim around together.

152
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,960
 And they couldn't work out if they were swimming together

153
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,040
 because there were just food sources,

154
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,800
 which were close to each other,

155
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,320
 or the home ranges were in the same place.

156
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,000
 But they discovered that actually some shark

157
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,440
 preferred the company of certain other sharks

158
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,200
 and actively avoided other ones,

159
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,480
 even though they were all in the same area

160
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,440
 of their territories overlap.

161
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,960
 So they concluded these sharks basically have friends.

162
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,280
 - So that's what it should be.

163
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,360
 - It could be that they have friends,

164
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,600
 or it could be that they just have enemies

165
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,920
 and they're hanging around these other guys

166
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,080
 'cause they're not enemies.

167
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,160
 - What's the definition of an enemy or a friend?

168
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,200
 - True. - Yeah.

169
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,560
 - This is quite interesting.

170
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,280
 They're like, why would animals have friends?

171
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,200
 And there must be an evolutionary reason for it.

172
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:45,000
 And I read two possible explanations I'd never heard before.

173
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,160
 So one of them was the enemy's enemy thing.

174
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,760
 And evidence for that is in dolphins,

175
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:53,000
 who there were two dolphins who had avoided each other.

176
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,680
 So they didn't particularly like each other.

177
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,480
 And then as soon as another dolphin came along,

178
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,600
 that wasn't part of their group

179
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,640
 and that was effectively an enemy to both of them,

180
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,480
 those first two dolphins started hanging out

181
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,080
 with each other became bestist buddies.

182
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,680
 'Cause suddenly they unite against their common enemy.

183
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,760
 - So what I feel is happening with this podcast actually

184
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,400
 and then you got and you were all ganging up

185
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,400
 on me and being horrible.

186
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,240
 - Shut up Alex.

187
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,240
 - Okay, I'm sorry.

188
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,600
 - The other good explanation I thought about

189
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,040
 why animals are friends to be attracted to the opposite sex.

190
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,840
 So they studied McCax and there was a McCax

191
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,560
 who was super attractive for like really good physical build,

192
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,800
 et cetera, but he wasn't very good at making friends

193
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,280
 with other males and women stopped shacking him.

194
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,560
 So same as with humans I guess, if someone's unpopular.

195
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,440
 - Again, we need to say female McCax.

196
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,000
 (all laughing)

197
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,120
 - I think just going back to the dolphins for a second,

198
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,600
 they hang out in pods, I think, to feed though, don't they?

199
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,920
 Because they swim around in a circle

200
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:47,080
 making bubbles and trapping fish in those bubbles

201
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:47,880
 so that they can eat them.

202
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,840
 So that's kind of a useful reason for having friends.

203
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,160
 - Yes, yes.

204
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,960
 - I think the smallest unit of dolphins is two or three males

205
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,960
 and they club up to guard the females basically

206
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,760
 that they perceive as being theirs.

207
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,760
 And then several of those little units

208
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:06,120
 will group together to steal females from other males.

209
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,440
 But sometimes two of those, even larger units,

210
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,160
 will club up a format kind of coalition,

211
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,120
 even though normally they're rivals.

212
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,960
 - Wow.

213
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,760
 - Then there must come an awkward moment

214
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,800
 where the dolphins decide which one of them actually gets

215
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,360
 to copulate with the female.

216
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,720
 - Well, dolphins have a very varied sex life.

217
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,160
 - So they can all do it, you're saying?

218
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,160
 - Yeah, they have, they have blowhole sex.

219
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,760
 And they have, they have all kinds of sex.

220
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,600
 Blowhole jobs.

221
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,480
 (all laughing)

222
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,920
 Okay, there is one other sign that could be an indicator

223
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,080
 that animals are friends with each other,

224
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,280
 which is they measure the levels of oxytocin

225
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,760
 inside them, which is known in humans as the love hormone.

226
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,680
 And if you have it, you are more inclined

227
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,680
 to trust other people and love them.

228
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,080
 And they tested, this is interspecies friendships.

229
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,320
 So that's very exciting.

230
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,640
 - Oh, like test Disney film friendships.

231
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,720
 - Yeah, exactly, yeah.

232
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,480
 And they tested a terrier and a goat,

233
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,800
 which were both young males.

234
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,480
 And they were used to playing and having play fights

235
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,920
 and sort of playfully nipping each other

236
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,320
 and rolling around and this stuff.

237
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,840
 And so they played for 15 minutes.

238
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,080
 And then after that, they measured the levels

239
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,800
 of oxytocin, the amount of oxytocin of the dog

240
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,640
 had increased by 48%, which they said suggested

241
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,440
 the dog was quite attached to the goat.

242
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,480
 (all laughing)

243
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:16,720
 However, the goats increase in oxytocin was 210%.

244
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,600
 And the authors of this said,

245
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,920
 we essentially found that the goat

246
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,560
 might have been in love with the dog.

247
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,720
 (all laughing)

248
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,480
 Which is a tragic, unrequited thing.

249
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,120
 (all laughing)

250
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,360
 It's so great.

251
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,720
 - Now that's sad.

252
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,720
 - Yeah.

253
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,560
 - Yeah.

254
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,520
 So animal friendship is most people thought

255
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,680
 that animals with big brains are more like to make friends.

256
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,320
 And they found that fruit bats can make friends as well.

257
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,560
 And they have tiny brains.

258
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,440
 So that's quite confusing.

259
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,920
 But they found this because things like

260
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,920
 there was a pregnant fruit bat.

261
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,280
 And they found that she was being groomed and hugged

262
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,000
 repeatedly by another bat who was unrelated to her,

263
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,080
 another female bat.

264
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,320
 And then when she gave birth,

265
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,760
 then the other female bat who'd been grooming her

266
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,800
 and a third female fan-t her with their wings

267
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,760
 to keep her cool.

268
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,600
 - Wow.

269
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,080
 - Just being nice to each other for no reason.

270
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,360
 - I do have bats can fan each other with their wings.

271
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,840
 That's amazing in itself, I think.

272
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,680
 - Yeah, that is quite cool.

273
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,280
 - Now I wish I had wings.

274
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,920
 - Yeah, because that's a primary useful wings, isn't it?

275
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,160
 That's the best thing you can use if you keep yourself cool.

276
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,120
 (all laughing)

277
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,960
 - Wow.

278
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,960
 - You give it a try as well.

279
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,800
 - I love it.

280
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,880
 - I love it if James is a bird just sitting there

281
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,400
 and I'm just going up to him James.

282
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,240
 Why don't you have a, oh, you can do that with them too.

283
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:27,080
 - D.H. Lawrence had a cow called Susan.

284
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:27,920
 - Degrees.

285
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,360
 - Yeah, which he loved and wrote so a lot about.

286
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,120
 And there's one other celebrity cow that I found.

287
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,200
 Elmpharm Olly, also known as the Sky Queen,

288
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,160
 was the first cow to fly an aeroplane to fly in an aeroplane.

289
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,080
 (all laughing)

290
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,920
 The Sky Queen was the first.

291
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,520
 - She struggled with landing for a while.

292
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,440
 She was at the controls.

293
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,000
 - That's how I got over the moon, right?

294
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,680
 (all laughing)

295
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,960
 - Yeah, so she was the first cow to fly in an aeroplane.

296
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:56,200
 It was in 1930 at the International Air Exposition in Missouri.

297
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,640
 A man called El's Worth Bunts became the first man

298
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,080
 to milk a cow mid-flight.

299
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,920
 Which he did in that flight.

300
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,520
 He parachuted calm some milk down to the spectators below.

301
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,120
 - That is the stupid one, brilliant thing.

302
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,120
 That's fantastic.

303
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:10,960
 - Right.

304
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,440
 - Another thing that, sorry, another thing that...

305
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,280
 - Oh my God.

306
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:18,800
 - If that was intentional, then you're fired from the podcast.

307
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,040
 - Another thing that affects cow lactation is slow songs.

308
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,880
 Apparently if you play slow ballads to a cow,

309
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,240
 then their lactation increases.

310
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,840
 But if you play fast, clubby songs to a cow,

311
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,720
 I think it was described as Euro Club Classics.

312
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,040
 There's no effect on lactation at all.

313
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,800
 - What the Euro Club Classics are.

314
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,640
 - Yeah.

315
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,400
 - I fall 65, probably that one.

316
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,000
 - I'm a new, DVD, DVD, DVD.

317
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,840
 (all laughing)

318
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,840
 Thank you very much.

319
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,420
 (upbeat music)

320
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,920
 - Okay, time for fact number two,

321
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,520
 which this week is James Harkin.

322
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:54,320
 - Okay, my fact is that it's illegal to take a selfie

323
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,520
 with a tiger in New York City.

324
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,360
 - What?

325
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,200
 - A big question.

326
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,360
 (all laughing)

327
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,880
 - Well, it kind of speaks for itself, really.

328
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,480
 This is a new law that's come in.

329
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,560
 And it prohibits direct contact

330
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,360
 between members of the public and big cats.

331
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,560
 So it's like with traveling circuses or that kind of thing.

332
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:14,000
 And really, it's that you're not allowed any photos,

333
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,280
 but obviously the press have put it forward

334
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,800
 as no tiger selfies.

335
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,160
 Because apparently tiger selfies are a thing

336
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,960
 on our dating websites.

337
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,160
 - Yes, to make...

338
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,680
 I've just realized someone's told me about this.

339
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,120
 And to make men look extra manly, apparently,

340
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,400
 they photograph themselves next to big...

341
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,400
 - It's completely animal.

342
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,720
 - It's simultaneously manly and cuddly.

343
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,520
 Because you're cuddling a tiger, but it's a tiger.

344
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,000
 - Oh, no, Alex, we've done it, haven't you?

345
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,360
 - I have a, I haven't seen it.

346
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,120
 I have visited the blog, which I found this morning

347
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,640
 called Tinder Guys with Tigers.

348
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,200
 - But actually, thinking about it now,

349
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,160
 if you're next to a tiger,

350
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,720
 the tiger is big and manly and well, not manly,

351
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,560
 but big and powerful, and next to him,

352
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,560
 you're just going to look less powerful.

353
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,120
 So you want to be next to a really weak,

354
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,360
 like a hamster or something.

355
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,600
 - There's lots of baby tiger photos.

356
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,440
 - Ah, there.

357
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,240
 - Or maybe women will be very disappointed

358
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,560
 on the eventual dates,

359
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,000
 'cause they assumed that it was the tiger in the photo.

360
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,720
 (laughing)

361
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,840
 Well, this is the technique that was surely first

362
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,760
 patented by Vladimir Putin.

363
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,600
 - Oh, yeah.

364
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,840
 - Who has photos taken with every wild animal.

365
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,480
 - But they're many dead, aren't they?

366
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,840
 - No, there's a lot of the wild animals.

367
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,000
 - He does some hunting ones,

368
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,560
 but it's genuinely Putin swimming with dolphins on the internet.

369
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,880
 - Dolphins who are previously enemies ganged off him again.

370
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,000
 (laughing)

371
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,720
 - He's trying to ban blow-hole sex.

372
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,840
 (laughing)

373
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:33,760
 - That's that I have, right there.

374
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,200
 - I was looking into history of selfies,

375
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,960
 'cause it seems quite like a modern thing.

376
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,160
 So I had a look.

377
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:45,160
 The earliest photograph of a person in American history

378
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,080
 is actually a selfie.

379
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,400
 It was taken by a guy called Robert Cornelius,

380
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,120
 and he took it in 1839.

381
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,240
 He was a lampmaker,

382
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,120
 and he was responsible for developing a process

383
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,320
 called Daggeropty, which was a short-lived photographic process

384
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,960
 of some sort, which is probably during the 1840s.

385
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,760
 The process was so slow that he was actually able

386
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,680
 to set up the camera and then run into shot

387
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,640
 for about a minute or so,

388
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,360
 and then close the lens cap, which is quite, quite more--

389
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,080
 - And the photos were called Daggeroptyps,

390
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,920
 whether that was it.

391
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,440
 - Wikipedia describes the photo,

392
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,040
 which you can go and see as an off-center portrait

393
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,800
 of a man with crossed arms and tautled hair.

394
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,240
 So I reckon it would be pretty well on Instagram,

395
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,840
 'cause that's pretty close to the mark.

396
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,200
 For the first selfie, that's pretty well done.

397
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,040
 - Yeah.

398
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,680
 - Do we think that was the first self-portrait?

399
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,680
 No, 'cause people have been drawing themselves for years,

400
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,040
 but I had a look into what the first ever,

401
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,680
 there's a collection of lines in a cave,

402
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:39,680
 which may be a drawing of a face, 27,000 years old.

403
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,720
 - We're kind of assuming this is the same person who drew it,

404
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,160
 though, if we're saying it's a selfie.

405
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,600
 - Exactly, yeah, it's open to debate.

406
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,000
 - There are a few lines next to it

407
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,600
 that look a bit like a tiger.

408
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,920
 (laughing)

409
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,960
 - 19th century portraits are fun.

410
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,240
 We talked about the headless photos.

411
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,000
 - Headless photos, so.

412
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,880
 - So, yeah, Victorions like to photograph themselves

413
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,800
 headless, I think, and carrying their heads

414
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,120
 or with their heads and their laps.

415
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,680
 They managed to doctor photos from a really early time.

416
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,560
 So you get portraits from the 1850s and '60s

417
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,400
 with their head and their--

418
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,240
 - They were necessarily doctors.

419
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,680
 They were like illusions.

420
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,320
 - They actually didn't cut heads.

421
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,520
 - The photo was so prestigious back then

422
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,360
 that you would have your own head cut off

423
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,720
 to have a photo made of you

424
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,000
 so that it would look better.

425
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,840
 - No, it only worked.

426
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,960
 - A lot of them would be, like, it's hard to describe,

427
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,400
 but there would be illusions.

428
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,360
 So you'd have two people in the photo,

429
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,760
 and one person would be sort of on the end of a table

430
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,840
 with their head resting on it

431
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,160
 and the rest of their body sort of out of shot.

432
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,680
 And then another person would be organized in a way

433
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,160
 that you didn't look like their head was there

434
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,840
 and when you line up, it looked like their head was not

435
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,680
 where it's supposed to be.

436
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,240
 - Oh, that's very good.

437
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,320
 And have you heard of, have you heard of snap shooting,

438
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,040
 which was a game that people played?

439
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:44,880
 - No.

440
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,280
 - This is in the very early days of handheld cameras.

441
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,120
 It's so much fun.

442
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,640
 You had to escape while someone else tried

443
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,800
 to take a photo of you.

444
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,280
 - Oh, it's not cool.

445
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,360
 - That's quite good.

446
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,640
 - It's a bit like laser quest.

447
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,120
 - Yeah, but it's laser quest.

448
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,600
 Well, you don't know the results for three days

449
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,600
 until you've had the photos developed.

450
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,600
 - It sounds like a fun game.

451
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,320
 - This is really interesting, I thought.

452
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:07,640
 So, after National Geographic published its first wildlife

453
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,120
 photographs in 1906 in the magazine,

454
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:13,200
 and two of the National Geographic Society board members

455
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,720
 resigned in disgust, 'cause wildlife photos.

456
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,800
 - They said it was becoming a mere picture book

457
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,920
 and that wasn't what the National Geographic was all about.

458
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,960
 - Wow.

459
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,800
 - Yeah.

460
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,640
 - A few more selfie things.

461
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,400
 You know these selfie stick, yes, of course.

462
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,560
 There's a thing called a selfie stick, do you know what that is?

463
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,760
 - A selfie stick.

464
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,720
 - Well, a selfie, I know, to my shame,

465
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,240
 is a selfie of your own bottom.

466
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,080
 - Yes.

467
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,760
 - So is a stick to take a photo of your own bottom?

468
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,600
 - That's right.

469
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,760
 - A self-colonist could be cute.

470
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,800
 (all laughing)

471
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,080
 - No, it's not that.

472
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,840
 - The article I read said,

473
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,360
 it's curiously out of stock at the moment,

474
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,280
 but is ostensibly a real product.

475
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,760
 So I'm not sure if it's even real.

476
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,600
 - Okay.

477
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,240
 - But the idea is that you hold it,

478
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,720
 and then it takes a picture of your bum,

479
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,960
 and then you can send it to people, presumably.

480
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,200
 You want to see that kind of thing?

481
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,520
 - Oh, Brave New World.

482
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,200
 (all laughing)

483
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,080
 - The Statue of Liberty is taking one continuous long selfie.

484
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,680
 I found this on Reddit today.

485
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:10,120
 There's her hand, which is holding up the torch.

486
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,280
 There's a camera video camera,

487
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,720
 which you can stream a live feed from online,

488
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,040
 and it's pointing down to her face,

489
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,040
 so she's taking one.

490
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:16,880
 - Wow.

491
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,720
 - That is great.

492
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,560
 - That is really good.

493
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,400
 - That's such a good fact.

494
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,240
 - Yeah.

495
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,320
 - Vain as women in the world.

496
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,160
 (all laughing)

497
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,320
 - Does anyone have more?

498
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,680
 - Some stuff about things illegal in New York.

499
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,520
 - Oh, yeah.

500
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,560
 - Okay, so it's strangely,

501
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,320
 it's illegal to honk your horn in New York City,

502
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,960
 unless it's an emergency.

503
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,680
 - So that's another still accuracy then,

504
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,560
 because anytime there's an establishing shot of New York,

505
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,400
 there's a soundtrack,

506
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,320
 there's lots of lots of hallways.

507
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,560
 - No, no, no, no, that's not true.

508
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,960
 - It's just that everyone's breaking the law.

509
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,080
 - All right, there's a constant state of emergency.

510
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:46,160
 (all laughing)

511
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,520
 It's also illegal for three or more people

512
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,920
 to dance in New York City.

513
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,760
 - What?

514
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,400
 - This is the rave laws that they have there.

515
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,920
 So what constitutes a rave?

516
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,200
 - Also in the same place.

517
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,240
 - Yeah, you can have a book in the appointment with the city.

518
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,080
 - Can I dance now?

519
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,320
 - But what do you mean in the same place?

520
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,080
 - It's okay if you're in your own home, actually.

521
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:06,200
 But it's gonna be the people in your home have to be yourself.

522
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,000
 People who live there are bona fide guests.

523
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,120
 It's legal in churches.

524
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,440
 And weirdly, it's also legal in premises licensed

525
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,840
 as retail cigarette dealers.

526
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,360
 - The cigarette buying dance, yeah.

527
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,200
 (all laughing)

528
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,720
 - So if you're in a bar and three of you are dancing?

529
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,640
 - You need a dancing license.

530
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,760
 - You need a dancing license.

531
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,680
 - All so the bar might have a dancing license.

532
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,640
 - Yeah, all the white constitutes an illegal rave.

533
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:33,280
 And also, pinball machines are illegal in a lot of America,

534
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,000
 but in New York until the 70s.

535
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,160
 - Wow.

536
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,120
 - It was because it was kind of gambling.

537
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,960
 And in the 1940s, Mayor Lagadia smashed up

538
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,200
 a load of pinball machines in front of the press

539
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,880
 and threw them in the sea.

540
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,520
 - He threw the press into the sea.

541
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,640
 (all laughing)

542
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,080
 - Recently, the Mayor of Riga drove a tank

543
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:54,480
 over an illegally parked car to make a point.

544
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,560
 Although he had illegally parked the car himself.

545
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:59,680
 So it wasn't just a random illegal parked car.

546
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,120
 - Well, it was the point he was making

547
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,440
 that look at my big tank.

548
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,440
 (all laughing)

549
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,520
 - Yeah, clearly.

550
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,360
 - That's true.

551
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,320
 - Literally, it was parked properly.

552
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,320
 - Big issues in Latvia.

553
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,160
 - What were we talking about?

554
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,120
 Hey, we're talking about it now.

555
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,560
 So it's worked.

556
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,880
 - Yeah, actually, guys, I'm double parked out there.

557
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,000
 So I'm just gonna have to go

558
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,640
 before the bear of Riga get laid.

559
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,400
 (upbeat music)

560
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:26,240
 - All right, time for fact number three, which is Anna.

561
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,640
 - Yep, my fact this week is that

562
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,800
 Morgh refrigerators in Turkey

563
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,040
 are equipped with motion sensors, alarms,

564
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,320
 and handles that open them from the inside

565
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,320
 in case anyone in there wakes up.

566
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,480
 - Perfectly, perfectly sensible precaution.

567
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,320
 - I think so.

568
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,160
 - Does it happen?

569
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,000
 Ever?

570
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,040
 - I don't think there's been any instances,

571
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,040
 certainly not in that place of it happening.

572
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,200
 But I think there's a widespread paranoia

573
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,160
 in that area of Turkey.

574
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,040
 It's in Malatia in Turkey.

575
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,560
 And they have, yeah, so they've got like door handles

576
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,400
 on the inside.

577
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,160
 There are sensors all around the inside compartment,

578
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,560
 so that if anything touches the walls,

579
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,680
 then automatically the drawer comes open.

580
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,440
 So the corpse is free to leave.

581
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,480
 - But corpses move around a little bit, don't they?

582
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,160
 - Because of escaping gases,

583
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,920
 and I think eventually Riga wants to leave.

584
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,360
 - Absolutely, but not very much.

585
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,200
 - And also when they become zombies.

586
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,040
 - Yes.

587
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,040
 - That is a concern.

588
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,400
 - In which case, why have we built easy access?

589
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,720
 - Yes, it's easy access.

590
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,880
 - More compartments.

591
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,720
 - That's true.

592
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,160
 If the zombie apocalypse happens,

593
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,840
 these are gonna be the first guys out, aren't they?

594
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,160
 - Yeah, and they'll let all the others out.

595
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,920
 - In the 19th century,

596
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,520
 there was no reliable indicator for death.

597
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,920
 People did not know that it was your heartbeat.

598
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,240
 - But that's still kind of true

599
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,200
 because it could be brain activity.

600
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,240
 - That's true.

601
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,520
 - So I think actually there is a slight kind of argument

602
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,080
 about how you can actually say that someone's dead,

603
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:44,920
 whether it's the heartbeat,

604
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,760
 whether it's the brain activity or whether it's...

605
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,600
 - Yeah.

606
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,440
 - It's almost like we know so much now

607
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,720
 that we've blurred the boundary that we originally set.

608
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,560
 - Yeah.

609
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,840
 - Well, they just didn't have a boundary at all.

610
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:53,920
 - They knew nothing at all of it,

611
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:57,400
 and they had competitions to enter

612
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,440
 where you would be given 1,500 francs

613
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,120
 if you worked out an easy and reliable sign of death.

614
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,600
 The winner was the heartbeat,

615
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,360
 and it was the man Eugene Bouchou,

616
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,920
 who invented the stethoscope,

617
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,440
 and Eugene Bouchou sounds like

618
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,200
 what you might hear down a stethoscope as well.

619
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,240
 (all laughing)

620
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,080
 - But it was fantastic,

621
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,240
 and he got a lot of criticism for being so impetuous

622
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,080
 as to say that you could bury someone

623
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:22,240
 only two minutes after ascertaining that they were dead.

624
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,960
 Everyone else said, "No, no, no, no, you should wait,"

625
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,280
 and it took years.

626
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,560
 - Did you say that he invented the stethoscope, sorry?

627
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,400
 - Sorry, he didn't.

628
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,240
 - Ah, yeah.

629
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,480
 Because the stethoscope was invented by a guy

630
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:35,280
 who was embarrassed when he had to take the heartbeat

631
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,760
 of a particularly booksome lady, wasn't it?

632
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,120
 And the way that he used to do it

633
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,440
 was you would put your head right down next to someone's chest,

634
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:45,840
 and he was embarrassed to kind of go into the breast area.

635
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,160
 - So he left her alone.

636
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,200
 "Excuse me while I go and invent something."

637
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,560
 (all laughing)

638
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,640
 - I might be wrong about this,

639
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,600
 but I think he did it with a rolled-up newspaper

640
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,440
 or something, and thought,

641
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,960
 "Well, this works quite well,

642
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,840
 and now I'm gonna make something even better."

643
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,200
 I might be wrong about the last bit.

644
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,040
 - I'm not sure.

645
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:04,000
 - The other ideas suggested for the prize included,

646
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,800
 sticking a thermometer into the stomach

647
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,520
 to see if you were cold enough to be buried.

648
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,760
 - To the rectum, would be good.

649
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,600
 - I don't think anyone suggested that for this.

650
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,760
 - Because you've got two different ways.

651
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:15,080
 One, the shock of having something up your bum,

652
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,560
 and two, the temperature.

653
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,400
 - Yes, yeah.

654
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,120
 - Okay, well, they're not actually still taking

655
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,720
 submissions, but I will pass it on.

656
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,160
 - Well, that?

657
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:27,000
 - They also had attaching pinces to the nipples

658
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,680
 of the brisium corpse.

659
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,160
 Scott, just burning the patient's arm

660
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,000
 with boiling water and seeing what happened.

661
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,200
 Putting a multitude of leeches near the bottom,

662
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,480
 or sticking it to my wife.

663
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,680
 - Or sticking a very long needle with a flag at one end,

664
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,120
 into the heart.

665
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,360
 And if the patient was alive,

666
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,480
 and there was any movement, the flag would wave a bit.

667
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,320
 - What?

668
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,560
 - And not for long.

669
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,600
 - And then when he died, it would come down to half mass,

670
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,440
 doesn't it?

671
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:53,440
 - One doctor said that the patient's tongue

672
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,680
 should be rhythmically pulled for three hours.

673
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:59,680
 - We should say, a lot of this is from a fantastic book

674
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,920
 by John Bonderson called "Berry Delive,"

675
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,560
 and it has a huge amount of unbelievably interesting

676
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:07,720
 information about this cultural fear over the centuries.

677
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,920
 - Since you mentioned putting stuff up the anus.

678
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,200
 In the late 18th century,

679
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,120
 doctors William Hawes and Thomas Cogan decided

680
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:17,120
 the best treatment for someone who seemed dead

681
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,920
 after drowning was a tobacco enema.

682
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,960
 And so they used to shove things up your anus, didn't they?

683
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,440
 And that had like a dual purpose

684
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,480
 of testing if someone was dead.

685
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,600
 - By giving you a nice hit of tobacco.

686
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,120
 - Exactly.

687
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,640
 And it was thought that, first of all,

688
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,680
 they would warm up the drowned person

689
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,400
 by pumping tobacco up their bum.

690
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,640
 And second, it was stimulate their respiration again.

691
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,600
 And it got a lot more popular when they started doing it

692
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,120
 with bellows, so they were a kid.

693
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,840
 So before this, they were just doing it

694
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,760
 with their mouth to the barn.

695
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:49,840
 - No, mouth to arse resuscitation.

696
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,000
 - Yeah, it was mouth to bone resuscitation,

697
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 which is problematic.

698
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,600
 'Cause a lot of people had died of illnesses,

699
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,480
 which involve quite a lot of fecal matter being infected.

700
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,240
 So quite a few people who tried this,

701
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,240
 doctors who tried this ended up dying themselves.

702
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,160
 - To be fair, they were supposed to blow, not suck.

703
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,960
 - Yeah, exactly, yeah, they did it wrong.

704
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,600
 - But then once that doctor's died, presumably,

705
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,320
 another doctor will come along and say,

706
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,800
 "My god, this patient has died.

707
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,640
 I must resuscitate it."

708
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,440
 This is an awful chamber reaction.

709
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,120
 If you've just stuck tobacco up someone's ass,

710
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,560
 then you're going to suck instead of blow

711
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,920
 because you've basically made a human cigarette.

712
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,080
 - A human cigarette?

713
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,160
 - It's going to be the sequel to the human's entity.

714
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,360
 - They used to hang those tobacco enema bellows

715
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,720
 up by the River Thames, where you would have life

716
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:32,720
 built today or life rings, they would just have as standard.

717
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,080
 - Have you guys heard of the Totenhaus?

718
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:35,920
 - No.

719
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,240
 - So these were literally that means house of the dead.

720
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,480
 Obviously that's their 19th century Germany,

721
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,320
 they're very popular.

722
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,760
 These were basically large halls,

723
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:45,480
 which are sometimes very lavish and are nearly decorated,

724
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,800
 in which bodies were kept for several days

725
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,120
 to ensure that they were really dead.

726
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,480
 I think this is a pretty grim job.

727
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,840
 If you were an attendant at this hall,

728
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,400
 you had possibly had 12 hour shifts,

729
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,920
 waiting for any signs of life,

730
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,920
 terrifying, horrible job.

731
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,600
 - But quite easy actually.

732
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,680
 - So what's a call?

733
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,800
 - Not a lot of times at which anyone actually wakes up,

734
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,560
 I guess.

735
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:06,160
 - Yeah, but if you missed that one time then, yeah.

736
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,560
 - If you fell asleep at like one, five minute window.

737
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,120
 - When that zombie apocalypse happened,

738
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,880
 they all came and I'm like,

739
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,880
 Jeff, what were you doing?

740
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,800
 You were supposed to be watching them.

741
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,360
 - It just woke up as an empty hall and you're like,

742
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,200
 oh, shit.

743
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,760
 - Yeah, the Paris Marg actually,

744
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,680
 was around the turn of the 20th century,

745
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:27,120
 it was arguably the most popular tourist destination

746
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,360
 in Paris and that's at a time when

747
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,360
 the Eiffel Tower was built as well.

748
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,960
 They were getting up to 40,000 visitors in a single day.

749
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,240
 - Did you start with mentalist items as well?

750
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,800
 They were in some weird tourist attractions.

751
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,960
 - Last week I was in Portugal and anyone who follows me

752
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,040
 on Twitter will know this already,

753
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:45,080
 but I went to a bone chapel.

754
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:49,320
 It was in Evora, which is the town in the middle of Portugal.

755
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,480
 And it was made by the monks and they took all of the bodies

756
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,440
 out of the town and then sort of put them on the walls

757
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,720
 in like some kind of weird...

758
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,560
 - Tiling.

759
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,280
 - Yeah, it's like tiling, yeah.

760
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,120
 - Wow.

761
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,320
 - So it decorates the whole chapel.

762
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,240
 - The best thing about it was I took a photo of it

763
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,920
 and put it on Facebook and Facebook recognized the skulls

764
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,600
 and tried to make me tag with them as my friends,

765
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,280
 because they were people.

766
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,120
 - That's crazy.

767
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,520
 - So they've just got real skeletons?

768
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,920
 - Yeah, real skeletons, yeah.

769
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,920
 - Hanging up.

770
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,520
 - And they have actual dead bodies as well,

771
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,440
 but when we were there, the dead bodies

772
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,000
 would be taken down for restoration.

773
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,040
 (laughing)

774
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:24,880
 - Yeah.

775
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,640
 - But it was supposed to be a place where you would go

776
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,320
 when you would think about your mortality and whatever.

777
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,080
 - So you know a memento moris?

778
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:31,920
 - No.

779
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,280
 - Well, there are kind of things that remind us

780
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,640
 that you're going to die, basically,

781
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:39,480
 and that all this is temporary and all flesh is dust

782
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,240
 and all of this stuff.

783
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,320
 So it's just something to remind you.

784
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,840
 So in lots of many of the Renaissance pictures,

785
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:48,120
 there's a skull there, just to point out you're gonna die.

786
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,920
 (laughing)

787
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,400
 - Just like watching countdown.

788
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,240
 - Oh, can you hear that?

789
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,200
 - The memento mori and countdown could be the big clock.

790
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,480
 - Oh, that's crazy.

791
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,960
 - Dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude.

792
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:58,800
 - Dom.

793
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,360
 (laughing)

794
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,200
 - Dom.

795
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,960
 (laughing)

796
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,640
 - Oh, basically, as well as a memento mori,

797
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,720
 there's also a memento vivare, which is a really nice thing.

798
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,160
 It's a reminder that you are alive

799
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,360
 and to take pleasure in life.

800
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,920
 And you don't really hear much about it.

801
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:17,560
 - So there was a thread of people who worked in morturies

802
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,480
 comparing their experiences.

803
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:22,200
 And there was someone who'd had a job in a mortuary

804
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,160
 and they got in someone who'd died,

805
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,440
 who'd been a hand model.

806
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,760
 And he said it was really weird,

807
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,960
 'cause he went into the service,

808
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,320
 the funeral service that they were having

809
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,560
 and they have lots of photographs up all over the place.

810
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,160
 And almost all of the photographs

811
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,800
 were just of this person's hand.

812
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:37,040
 (laughing)

813
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,800
 - So it was a funeral of that character

814
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,800
 from the Adam's family.

815
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,200
 (laughing)

816
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,960
 - That's a thing.

817
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,200
 - There was another one where a clown had died

818
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,760
 and the person was buried in full clown costume.

819
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,960
 The whole family were clowns.

820
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,240
 All the friends were clowns

821
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,400
 and at the family's request,

822
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,160
 the funeral directors had to dress up as clowns as well.

823
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:58,000
 - Didn't the shoes not fit in the coffin?

824
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,440
 - They put him in the coffin

825
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,880
 and all the sides fell out of it.

826
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,600
 (laughing)

827
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:05,200
 (upbeat music)

828
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,000
 - Okay, and the final fact is my fact this week

829
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,080
 and it is that Henry VIII had two official cradle rockers

830
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,840
 who were paid three pounds a year each to rock his cradle.

831
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:17,560
 I should stress, this is when he was a baby.

832
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:20,960
 - I had a great image in my head before you told me that.

833
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,200
 - Three pounds a year would have been a lot

834
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,600
 in those days, presumably.

835
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,160
 - It would have been more, but not a huge amount.

836
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:29,280
 - And also my question is, did they go in shifts

837
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:32,640
 or did they need two people to rock one cradle?

838
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,120
 - Well, his cradle was massive.

839
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,280
 It was five feet long and two feet wide

840
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,320
 and this is the rocking one as well.

841
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,720
 This isn't just a crib for a baby.

842
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,920
 This is an actual rocking cradle.

843
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,240
 Suspended from a wooden canvas

844
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,000
 covered with crimson cloth of gold

845
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,040
 and trimmed with ermine and it was ridiculous.

846
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,520
 - Nice, it was Henry VIII, he went in.

847
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:53,160
 - Well, not at the time, it was just a small baby at the time.

848
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,880
 - His daughter, was it married the first time,

849
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,400
 even she had four cradle rockers?

850
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,240
 - Four.

851
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,160
 - Yeah, and she had two cribs as well.

852
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,880
 She had an everyday cradle, which was silver and gold,

853
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,600
 I think, and then a cradle of estate

854
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,760
 for special occasions for receiving visitors.

855
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:08,160
 - The current queen has 733 cradle rockers.

856
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,240
 (laughing)

857
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,320
 Just goes up every time because they want to outdo

858
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,360
 to take this one.

859
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:17,360
 - Ever the sixth was given a baby replicate of a court

860
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,520
 when he was not yet one year old, he had a chamberlain,

861
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,520
 a vice chamberlain, a steward, a cofferer,

862
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,760
 lots of other stuff.

863
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:25,400
 - They were, they weren't other babies.

864
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,920
 (laughing)

865
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,480
 - That's a fantastic idea.

866
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,320
 - Brilliant.

867
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:32,960
 - Yeah, that's the most adorable thing I can think of.

868
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,880
 (laughing)

869
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,520
 They're all dressed as what is a little Thomas Kramma baby

870
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,120
 and there's a Walsby baby.

871
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,240
 - That's how I imagine.

872
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,720
 - Little CBB's is wrong.

873
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,800
 (laughing)

874
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:47,320
 - No, so when Henry VIII's first son was born,

875
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:50,680
 he Henry appointed him 40 staff immediately,

876
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:53,760
 including a baker and a keeper of the cellar for some reason.

877
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,760
 - It would be brilliant if they were babies as well,

878
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,600
 wasn't it?

879
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,040
 - I just love this idea of just community of babies

880
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,120
 looking up to you like a tiny bit.

881
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,760
 - Yeah, maybe a miniature bocky and palace.

882
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,560
 - This is the Muppet Babies of the Tudor Court, I don't like it.

883
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,280
 - They didn't call themselves Tudor, did they?

884
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,120
 Didn't like that.

885
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,120
 - No, what is that?

886
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,920
 - It reminded them of their Welsh background Tudor

887
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,960
 and they didn't like that.

888
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,800
 Henry VIII referred to himself as the embodiment

889
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,760
 of the union of the families of Lancaster in York,

890
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,760
 rather than Tudor.

891
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,600
 - Tudor snappier, isn't it?

892
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,440
 - It is snappier.

893
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,920
 It was like 100, 200, 200 years afterwards

894
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:27,040
 when it became more common.

895
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:30,400
 - Moving down the line, Queen Victoria.

896
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,880
 Well, she sounds like she had a phobia of babies.

897
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,520
 She described them as rather disgusting.

898
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,480
 She described her own babies as frog-like

899
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,320
 and frightful, went undressed.

900
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,600
 And she had nine.

901
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,440
 - I know, I know, I know, I know.

902
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,280
 - Yes, you know.

903
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,280
 - She's got a punishment.

904
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,120
 - Yeah.

905
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,640
 - She, when she was a baby,

906
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:52,440
 her father described her as plump as a partridge

907
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,520
 and more a pocket hercules and a pocket venus.

908
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,200
 I think she was quite a fat baby.

909
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,360
 - Hercules supposedly killed two snakes in his crib.

910
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,200
 - Oh yeah.

911
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,040
 - What did he do?

912
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,840
 - I heard some vengeful goddess release them

913
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,680
 towards them, didn't he?

914
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,520
 And he smashed them together.

915
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,400
 - Is that where the rattle was invented?

916
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,240
 - Yes.

917
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,080
 - He killed the snake.

918
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,200
 - So they were rattle snakes.

919
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,040
 - So they were rattle snakes.

920
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,520
 - And then he turned around and used them as rattle.

921
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,360
 - And someone was like,

922
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,920
 if I take out the snake aspect of this,

923
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,120
 it would make a great toy.

924
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:18,080
 - But Queen Victoria, named Victoria,

925
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:18,920
 very controversial.

926
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,600
 Victoria wasn't really a name in Britain at the time.

927
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,760
 Was it?

928
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,920
 Not a girl's name.

929
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,640
 And she was named after a mother who was German.

930
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,080
 Got a lot of politicians and men at court

931
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,200
 tried to make her change her name

932
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,760
 when she was going to exceed to the throne.

933
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,600
 - What too?

934
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,600
 - Some more conventional.

935
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,800
 So I think Elizabeth was suggested originally.

936
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:37,360
 - When the queen gave birth to Prince Charles,

937
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,520
 Prince Philip was playing squash at the time.

938
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,360
 - That was easy.

939
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,200
 - Yep.

940
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,040
 - Did he leave the game?

941
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,480
 - No, the queen was a name of the 30 hours.

942
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,680
 But he played squash.

943
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,160
 - That's a lot of game of squash.

944
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,680
 - He must have been tired at the end of that.

945
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,520
 - He is.

946
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,480
 - Someone was taking care of it.

947
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,320
 - Well he just comes together.

948
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,960
 I'm exhausted.

949
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:53,800
 What a day it's been.

950
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,640
 How was your day?

951
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,520
 - Do you know swaddling?

952
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,360
 - Yeah.

953
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,520
 - Which is where you just restrict babies very tightly

954
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,200
 in their movements for the first few months of their life.

955
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,600
 It's incredible that this happened

956
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,920
 and that we still happens around the world, I think.

957
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:06,760
 - Yeah.

958
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,600
 - Does it simulate woman environment, is that right?

959
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,720
 - I don't know.

960
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,360
 And this used to happen.

961
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,600
 Babies who were in their swaddling clothes

962
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:17,640
 would sometimes be hung up from a nail on the wall

963
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,640
 which was to give their carrots,

964
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,480
 so you'd just sort of loop a bit of the swaddling

965
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,400
 over a nail on the wall.

966
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:25,080
 And the baby would just be entertained by its surroundings.

967
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,200
 This is according to the Victoria and Albert Museum.

968
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,320
 To give their carrots a rest

969
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,440
 and to entertain them with the surrounding environment.

970
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,280
 - Like a boy.

971
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,880
 - It's a really funny idea, like a wall mounted baby.

972
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,200
 - It'd be good if you had like sex tubulets

973
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,800
 and they were just hanging up around the hole.

974
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,600
 - Yeah, or you could put them like plaster ducks,

975
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,680
 you could put them going up in a diagonal line.

976
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,400
 (laughing)

977
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,240
 - It was phased out.

978
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,400
 I think it was widely perceived as being bad

979
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,200
 for the baby's health.

980
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,040
 - Obviously.

981
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:55,800
 - Cradles and cots.

982
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,080
 The first, in fact, actually I was looking into cradles

983
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,280
 and cots on my side accidentally looking into prams,

984
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:04,080
 but the first pram was invented in 1733

985
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,560
 and it was made to be pulled along.

986
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,600
 So it was like a small pram and it had a harness.

987
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,440
 So it could be pulled along by a goat or a dog.

988
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,040
 (laughing)

989
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:11,880
 - That's adorable.

990
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,880
 I imagine the mini Henry VIII baby

991
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,680
 being pulled along by a dog.

992
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,480
 - A dog and the goats who are best friends.

993
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,800
 - Oh, god.

994
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,120
 - It just needs film lines to tell.

995
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,280
 (laughing)

996
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,160
 - Pram is short for prambulator.

997
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,000
 - Yeah.

998
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,320
 - But there was no one walking, I guess.

999
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,160
 - That's true.

1000
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,360
 - It was being pulled by an animal.

1001
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,480
 - Well, the dog and the goat would have been walking to it.

1002
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,320
 - Yeah, yeah.

1003
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,880
 - Walking into our hearts.

1004
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,720
 (laughing)

1005
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,560
 - Jesus.

1006
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,120
 - They called the first prams,

1007
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,680
 that when prams started becoming popular

1008
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,960
 in the mid 19th century,

1009
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,400
 I think they were called male carts

1010
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,160
 'cause they were based on design for male carts

1011
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,760
 when you just push like big packages along.

1012
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,680
 - And 'cause female babies weren't loud in them.

1013
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:49,000
 (laughing)

1014
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,120
 - I read that.

1015
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,760
 There's one book I've read this in and I can't find it verified,

1016
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:55,120
 but children's cots were initially used to be bassinets,

1017
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,280
 which would just sit on the floor.

1018
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,680
 And then they were raised off the floor due to a perception

1019
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:01,840
 that there were noxious fumes that existed below knee level

1020
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,680
 and explosive vapors that existed near the ceiling

1021
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:08,520
 and that the middle air of a room was the healthy air you had to breathe.

1022
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,800
 - Technically, isn't that true?

1023
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,240
 Because oxygen is flowerable,

1024
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,480
 so we need a top and calm dioxide is.

1025
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:16,400
 - It's the gas in the room just moves around too much

1026
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,240
 to use infection.

1027
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,080
 - Yeah, I know.

1028
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,920
 - If it was a very still room.

1029
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,400
 - We're onto the right idea

1030
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,640
 and we're killing our babies by leaving them on the floor.

1031
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,440
 It's very unusual putting babies in cradles,

1032
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,080
 having them sleeping cradles and cots and stuff

1033
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:27,960
 in most parts of the world.

1034
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,320
 It's really weird that we do that.

1035
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,160
 - So.

1036
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,240
 - Yeah, like vast majority of countries,

1037
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,360
 I think it's pretty much unheard of and babies just sleep

1038
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,280
 with their parents.

1039
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:37,560
 - Parents used to not really worry about washing their babies too much either.

1040
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,400
 - Oh yeah.

1041
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:41,720
 - Mothers in medieval times would dry nappies rather than wash them

1042
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,840
 and in the book I was reading about this,

1043
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:44,680
 a history of childhood.

1044
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,840
 This was because of the healing powers of urine.

1045
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:47,680
 - Right.

1046
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:50,000
 - And in bits of France,

1047
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,800
 people thought that if you washed a child's head,

1048
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,720
 you would make it simple-minded.

1049
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:57,280
 And if you cut its nails and hair before it was a year and a day old,

1050
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:00,480
 it would be respectively mute and a thief.

1051
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,920
 - Being mute is good if you're a thief because you make less noise.

1052
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,720
 - It's a really good point.

1053
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,560
 - Okay, here's a thing.

1054
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:08,160
 That's what we might as well make sure it's safe as well.

1055
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,160
 - Please make sure it's safe.

1056
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,520
 - Okay, cut its nails then.

1057
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,280
 (laughing)

1058
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,080
 - Yeah, extraordinary.

1059
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:17,240
 - Can I just do one thing about an unusual job that I read today?

1060
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:19,280
 Okay, so I was reading a book early on.

1061
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,240
 It's called Sex on Earth.

1062
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,080
 - Sex and Earth.

1063
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:22,920
 - What is that?

1064
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,520
 - I think it's a big phrase.

1065
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,360
 - Sorry.

1066
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:28,000
 - They were talking about the way that horses have sex

1067
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,600
 specifically in stud.

1068
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:35,000
 So they have, a stallion will come in and have sex with a female horse.

1069
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,320
 And they were explaining how this happens.

1070
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:41,320
 And there is a guy who's one and only job is to hold the base

1071
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:45,560
 of the stallion's penis while it is in the mare's vagina.

1072
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:50,600
 And his job is to feel for the tell-tale throbbing of ejaculation

1073
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,360
 so that he knows when it's finished.

1074
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,200
 - Oh my goodness.

1075
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,600
 - Why does he need to know that?

1076
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,640
 - It's so they can stop the act.

1077
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:00,560
 - But surely it stops anyway in nature.

1078
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,920
 - That much of a hurry that we need to write the usual bits over.

1079
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:04,960
 - I was going to say it's a brilliant book.

1080
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,480
 It's by Jules Howard.

1081
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,640
 It's absolutely real.

1082
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,560
 - But that's presumably why in nature,

1083
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:12,600
 you see a lot of skeletons of horses which have just died

1084
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,640
 because they didn't know when to stop having sex.

1085
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:21,640
 - Imagine how the stallion feels during all that.

1086
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,360
 In Paris, I presume.

1087
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,200
 - I don't know.

1088
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,280
 - I would if a horse turned up.

1089
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,280
 - That's it.

1090
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,520
 - Hold it in the face, you can hear this in his face.

1091
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,400
 - Did you just say I'm a stallion in bed?

1092
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,640
 - No, I said there's a stallion in bed.

1093
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:40,160
 - Okay, that's all of our facts.

1094
