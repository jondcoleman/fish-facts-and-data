00:00:02,00:00:14,- Hello and welcome to another edition of No Such Thing
00:00:14,00:00:15,"as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming"
00:00:15,00:00:18,from the QI offices in Covent Garden.
00:00:18,00:00:19,My name's Andy and I'm sitting here
00:00:19,00:00:20,"with three of the regular elves,"
00:00:20,00:00:24,"James Harkin, Alex Bell, and Anna Tajinsky."
00:00:24,00:00:26,And we've gathered our favorite facts from the last seven days
00:00:26,00:00:28,and we're now going to talk about them
00:00:28,00:00:30,in no particular order.
00:00:30,00:00:34,(upbeat music)
00:00:34,00:00:37,First fact is Alex.
00:00:37,00:00:40,"- Okay, my fact is cows have friends and they get sad"
00:00:40,00:00:42,when you separate them.
00:00:42,00:00:43,- Oh.
00:00:43,00:00:45,- How are they cow friends?
00:00:45,00:00:49,"- Yeah, so basically Northampton University did a study."
00:00:49,00:00:51,So cows are her animals obviously.
00:00:51,00:00:52,- Pascine.
00:00:52,00:00:53,(laughing)
00:00:53,00:00:55,"- Yeah, so they live in a herd but they get separated a lot"
00:00:55,00:00:57,"because they need to be milk, they need to be taken"
00:00:57,00:00:58,"into the vets, et cetera."
00:00:58,00:01:01,And Northampton University did a study where they looked
00:01:01,00:01:04,at cows when they're in a field and monitored all their behavior
00:01:04,00:01:07,to see which cows hung out with which other cows.
00:01:07,00:01:10,And then they separated them out into different combinations.
00:01:10,00:01:12,So sometimes they'd be removed from the herd in pairs
00:01:12,00:01:15,and sometimes they'd be with a cow they'd never hung out
00:01:15,00:01:18,with before or sometimes they'd be with their best friend.
00:01:18,00:01:19,(laughing)
00:01:19,00:01:20,- I don't know how we could work to that.
00:01:20,00:01:21,"- Bracelets, but they wear bracelets."
00:01:21,00:01:22,- Yeah.
00:01:22,00:01:24,And sometimes they were on their own
00:01:24,00:01:27,and each time their heart rates
00:01:27,00:01:29,and cortisol levels were monitored
00:01:29,00:01:32,and from that apparently we can work out
00:01:32,00:01:34,whether cows get stressed or not.
00:01:34,00:01:36,"- And cortisol we should say is the stress hormone,"
00:01:36,00:01:37,"is that right? - Right, yeah."
00:01:37,00:01:39,- Apparently there's quite a high level of stress
00:01:39,00:01:41,with integrating into a new herd.
00:01:41,00:01:42,So if you take a cow and you put it into--
00:01:42,00:01:45,- I was gonna say how stressful can it be being a cow?
00:01:45,00:01:47,"- Well, very."
00:01:47,00:01:50,"- If you don't know what your demise is going to be,"
00:01:50,00:01:53,"I would say very, but they don't."
00:01:53,00:01:54,"- Given how little is going on in their lives,"
00:01:54,00:01:56,I think any change is pretty stressful.
00:01:56,00:01:58,"I mean, if you're moving how from one field to the other,"
00:01:58,00:02:00,that's probably groundbreaking to them.
00:02:00,00:02:01,(laughing)
00:02:01,00:02:02,You think about it then?
00:02:02,00:02:04,"- Yeah, so it's hard to tell if that counts as a friend."
00:02:04,00:02:06,"- Yeah, we're kind of anthropomorphizing them, aren't we?"
00:02:06,00:02:09,"- Yeah, I think elephants always feel like they're the ones"
00:02:09,00:02:11,that we're most justified anthropomorphizing
00:02:11,00:02:14,'cause they only have a weirdly human attitude
00:02:14,00:02:16,"towards their dead, don't they?"
00:02:16,00:02:16,"- They mourn, don't they?"
00:02:16,00:02:18,"- Yeah, they mourn their dead"
00:02:18,00:02:20,and they bury them sometimes with leaves and earth
00:02:20,00:02:24,"and they'll come back to visit where the elephant died,"
00:02:24,00:02:25,the family member died.
00:02:25,00:02:27,- The thing about elephant graveyards is that a myth
00:02:27,00:02:28,"or is that real? - That is a myth, yeah."
00:02:28,00:02:32,"- Yeah, so that's the idea that the elephants will go"
00:02:32,00:02:35,to a certain place to die and then you'll find lots of bones
00:02:35,00:02:37,there because it's a special place for elephants.
00:02:37,00:02:39,- But you'd feel terrible if you were an elephant
00:02:39,00:02:41,"and everyone else said, ""Hey, come on,"
00:02:41,00:02:42,"we're going to the elephant graveyard."""
00:02:42,00:02:43,"And you said, ""Why?"""
00:02:43,00:02:44,"And they said, ""No reason."""
00:02:44,00:02:46,(laughing)
00:02:46,00:02:50,"- That's like the cartoon, ""The Daily Mash of the Turkey,"""
00:02:50,00:02:52,"which is saying just before Christmas,"
00:02:52,00:02:54,it's a bubble speech bubble coming out of the turkeys
00:02:54,00:02:57,"mouth saying, ""Hey guys, so are you doing any of the new year?"""
00:02:57,00:02:58,I agree.
00:02:58,00:02:59,(laughing)
00:02:59,00:03:00,- Feel sad.
00:03:00,00:03:02,"- But elephants, something really weird about elephants"
00:03:02,00:03:05,or on it is if you show them on piece of ivory
00:03:05,00:03:07,"and then a piece of wood, they get much more agitated"
00:03:07,00:03:09,by the ivory and if you show them an elephant skull
00:03:09,00:03:10,"and then the skull of another large animal,"
00:03:10,00:03:12,"like a hippo skull, they're much more agitated"
00:03:12,00:03:13,by the elephant skull.
00:03:13,00:03:14,- Really?
00:03:14,00:03:16,"- Elephant skulls are quite scary though, aren't they?"
00:03:16,00:03:18,"'Cause they have like a big hole, yes."
00:03:18,00:03:19,- That is true.
00:03:19,00:03:23,- The idea is that's where Cyclops myth might have come from.
00:03:23,00:03:25,'Cause it looks like there's a massive eye hole
00:03:25,00:03:28,"in the middle, but actually it's where the trunk comes out from."
00:03:28,00:03:31,"- Cows skulls only have, they only have bottom teeth."
00:03:31,00:03:33,"So we have two sets of teeth, obviously,"
00:03:33,00:03:34,is in the top teeth and bottom teeth.
00:03:34,00:03:35,They only have bottom teeth.
00:03:35,00:03:37,"Where the top teeth should be,"
00:03:37,00:03:39,there's just a sort of long area of bone.
00:03:39,00:03:42,"So they grind up what they eat with teeth, yeah."
00:03:42,00:03:43,- Cows don't have upper teeth.
00:03:43,00:03:45,"- So I was basically, I was looking into"
00:03:45,00:03:47,"how the digestive system of a cow,"
00:03:47,00:03:50,"so they're ruminants, which means that they basically"
00:03:50,00:03:52,ferment the grass first.
00:03:52,00:03:54,"So they pick up the grass by,"
00:03:54,00:03:55,they actually curl their tongues round the grass
00:03:55,00:03:57,"instead of ripping it up with their teeth,"
00:03:57,00:03:58,which I thought it was really interesting.
00:03:58,00:04:00,"Then they chew it, then it goes down into their stomach"
00:04:00,00:04:02,and sits there for a while and ferments for a bit.
00:04:02,00:04:04,So they get nutrients out and then they regurgitate it
00:04:04,00:04:06,"back into their mouths and chew it some more,"
00:04:06,00:04:08,"which is the ruminating, but, and that's cods now."
00:04:08,00:04:10,So that's where chewing the cod comes from
00:04:10,00:04:11,and then they sort of get again.
00:04:11,00:04:13,- Winding your tongue around the rate of grass
00:04:13,00:04:14,"is quite sexy, isn't it?"
00:04:14,00:04:16,(laughing)
00:04:16,00:04:18,- I've never seen a woman before yourself.
00:04:18,00:04:22,"- You know, I've never seen a woman doing that."
00:04:22,00:04:23,- I need to go on more picnics.
00:04:23,00:04:25,(laughing)
00:04:25,00:04:28,- I bet cows tie cherries and knots as a final.
00:04:28,00:04:29,- Oh yeah.
00:04:29,00:04:30,- And that's what I was thinking of.
00:04:30,00:04:31,- What's that?
00:04:31,00:04:32,"- You know, when you tie a cherry and a knot"
00:04:32,00:04:35,with your tongue and then that kind of shows that you're--
00:04:35,00:04:36,"- Yeah, cherry stock."
00:04:36,00:04:38,- That sounds incredibly difficult.
00:04:38,00:04:39,I don't think it was that good.
00:04:39,00:04:40,- It's not that hard.
00:04:40,00:04:40,- My brother can do it.
00:04:40,00:04:41,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:04:41,00:04:43,- It's not that hard as well.
00:04:43,00:04:44,"- Once you learn how to do it, it's pretty easy."
00:04:44,00:04:46,"And you're a babe back then, then."
00:04:46,00:04:47,(laughing)
00:04:47,00:04:48,- I can also pick up blades of grass with my tongue.
00:04:48,00:04:50,(laughing)
00:04:50,00:04:53,- And another animal which has friends is sharks.
00:04:53,00:04:55,If you can believe sharks have friends.
00:04:55,00:04:57,- I don't believe that.
00:04:57,00:05:00,"- Oh, okay, some scientists analyzed a group"
00:05:00,00:05:02,"of a particular species of sharks,"
00:05:02,00:05:04,which swim around together.
00:05:04,00:05:05,And they couldn't work out if they were swimming together
00:05:05,00:05:08,"because there were just food sources,"
00:05:08,00:05:08,"which were close to each other,"
00:05:08,00:05:11,or the home ranges were in the same place.
00:05:11,00:05:13,But they discovered that actually some shark
00:05:13,00:05:15,preferred the company of certain other sharks
00:05:15,00:05:18,"and actively avoided other ones,"
00:05:18,00:05:20,even though they were all in the same area
00:05:20,00:05:21,of their territories overlap.
00:05:21,00:05:23,So they concluded these sharks basically have friends.
00:05:23,00:05:25,- So that's what it should be.
00:05:25,00:05:27,"- It could be that they have friends,"
00:05:27,00:05:29,or it could be that they just have enemies
00:05:29,00:05:30,and they're hanging around these other guys
00:05:30,00:05:32,'cause they're not enemies.
00:05:32,00:05:35,- What's the definition of an enemy or a friend?
00:05:35,00:05:36,- True. - Yeah.
00:05:36,00:05:37,- This is quite interesting.
00:05:37,00:05:39,"They're like, why would animals have friends?"
00:05:39,00:05:41,And there must be an evolutionary reason for it.
00:05:41,00:05:45,And I read two possible explanations I'd never heard before.
00:05:45,00:05:47,So one of them was the enemy's enemy thing.
00:05:47,00:05:49,"And evidence for that is in dolphins,"
00:05:49,00:05:53,who there were two dolphins who had avoided each other.
00:05:53,00:05:54,So they didn't particularly like each other.
00:05:54,00:05:56,"And then as soon as another dolphin came along,"
00:05:56,00:05:57,that wasn't part of their group
00:05:57,00:05:59,"and that was effectively an enemy to both of them,"
00:05:59,00:06:01,those first two dolphins started hanging out
00:06:01,00:06:03,with each other became bestist buddies.
00:06:03,00:06:05,'Cause suddenly they unite against their common enemy.
00:06:05,00:06:07,- So what I feel is happening with this podcast actually
00:06:07,00:06:09,and then you got and you were all ganging up
00:06:09,00:06:10,on me and being horrible.
00:06:10,00:06:11,- Shut up Alex.
00:06:11,00:06:12,"- Okay, I'm sorry."
00:06:12,00:06:14,- The other good explanation I thought about
00:06:14,00:06:17,why animals are friends to be attracted to the opposite sex.
00:06:17,00:06:19,So they studied McCax and there was a McCax
00:06:19,00:06:22,"who was super attractive for like really good physical build,"
00:06:22,00:06:24,"et cetera, but he wasn't very good at making friends"
00:06:24,00:06:27,with other males and women stopped shacking him.
00:06:27,00:06:29,"So same as with humans I guess, if someone's unpopular."
00:06:29,00:06:32,"- Again, we need to say female McCax."
00:06:32,00:06:35,(all laughing)
00:06:35,00:06:38,"- I think just going back to the dolphins for a second,"
00:06:38,00:06:41,"they hang out in pods, I think, to feed though, don't they?"
00:06:41,00:06:43,Because they swim around in a circle
00:06:43,00:06:47,making bubbles and trapping fish in those bubbles
00:06:47,00:06:47,so that they can eat them.
00:06:47,00:06:50,So that's kind of a useful reason for having friends.
00:06:50,00:06:52,"- Yes, yes."
00:06:52,00:06:55,- I think the smallest unit of dolphins is two or three males
00:06:55,00:06:58,and they club up to guard the females basically
00:06:58,00:07:00,that they perceive as being theirs.
00:07:00,00:07:02,And then several of those little units
00:07:02,00:07:06,will group together to steal females from other males.
00:07:06,00:07:08,"But sometimes two of those, even larger units,"
00:07:08,00:07:11,"will club up a format kind of coalition,"
00:07:11,00:07:13,even though normally they're rivals.
00:07:13,00:07:13,- Wow.
00:07:13,00:07:14,- Then there must come an awkward moment
00:07:14,00:07:16,where the dolphins decide which one of them actually gets
00:07:16,00:07:18,to copulate with the female.
00:07:18,00:07:21,"- Well, dolphins have a very varied sex life."
00:07:21,00:07:23,"- So they can all do it, you're saying?"
00:07:23,00:07:26,"- Yeah, they have, they have blowhole sex."
00:07:26,00:07:28,"And they have, they have all kinds of sex."
00:07:28,00:07:29,Blowhole jobs.
00:07:29,00:07:31,(all laughing)
00:07:31,00:07:34,"Okay, there is one other sign that could be an indicator"
00:07:34,00:07:36,"that animals are friends with each other,"
00:07:36,00:07:38,which is they measure the levels of oxytocin
00:07:38,00:07:40,"inside them, which is known in humans as the love hormone."
00:07:40,00:07:42,"And if you have it, you are more inclined"
00:07:42,00:07:44,to trust other people and love them.
00:07:44,00:07:47,"And they tested, this is interspecies friendships."
00:07:47,00:07:48,So that's very exciting.
00:07:48,00:07:49,"- Oh, like test Disney film friendships."
00:07:49,00:07:50,"- Yeah, exactly, yeah."
00:07:50,00:07:52,"And they tested a terrier and a goat,"
00:07:52,00:07:53,which were both young males.
00:07:53,00:07:56,And they were used to playing and having play fights
00:07:56,00:07:57,and sort of playfully nipping each other
00:07:57,00:07:59,and rolling around and this stuff.
00:07:59,00:08:00,And so they played for 15 minutes.
00:08:00,00:08:03,"And then after that, they measured the levels"
00:08:03,00:08:05,"of oxytocin, the amount of oxytocin of the dog"
00:08:05,00:08:09,"had increased by 48%, which they said suggested"
00:08:09,00:08:11,the dog was quite attached to the goat.
00:08:11,00:08:12,(all laughing)
00:08:12,00:08:16,"However, the goats increase in oxytocin was 210%."
00:08:16,00:08:18,"And the authors of this said,"
00:08:18,00:08:19,we essentially found that the goat
00:08:19,00:08:21,might have been in love with the dog.
00:08:21,00:08:22,(all laughing)
00:08:22,00:08:24,"Which is a tragic, unrequited thing."
00:08:24,00:08:26,(all laughing)
00:08:26,00:08:27,It's so great.
00:08:27,00:08:28,- Now that's sad.
00:08:28,00:08:29,- Yeah.
00:08:29,00:08:30,- Yeah.
00:08:30,00:08:32,So animal friendship is most people thought
00:08:32,00:08:34,that animals with big brains are more like to make friends.
00:08:34,00:08:36,And they found that fruit bats can make friends as well.
00:08:36,00:08:37,And they have tiny brains.
00:08:37,00:08:38,So that's quite confusing.
00:08:38,00:08:40,But they found this because things like
00:08:40,00:08:42,there was a pregnant fruit bat.
00:08:42,00:08:45,And they found that she was being groomed and hugged
00:08:45,00:08:48,"repeatedly by another bat who was unrelated to her,"
00:08:48,00:08:49,another female bat.
00:08:49,00:08:50,"And then when she gave birth,"
00:08:50,00:08:53,then the other female bat who'd been grooming her
00:08:53,00:08:56,and a third female fan-t her with their wings
00:08:56,00:08:57,to keep her cool.
00:08:57,00:08:58,- Wow.
00:08:58,00:09:00,- Just being nice to each other for no reason.
00:09:00,00:09:02,- I do have bats can fan each other with their wings.
00:09:02,00:09:03,"That's amazing in itself, I think."
00:09:03,00:09:04,"- Yeah, that is quite cool."
00:09:04,00:09:06,- Now I wish I had wings.
00:09:06,00:09:08,"- Yeah, because that's a primary useful wings, isn't it?"
00:09:08,00:09:11,That's the best thing you can use if you keep yourself cool.
00:09:11,00:09:13,(all laughing)
00:09:13,00:09:13,- Wow.
00:09:13,00:09:14,- You give it a try as well.
00:09:14,00:09:15,- I love it.
00:09:15,00:09:17,- I love it if James is a bird just sitting there
00:09:17,00:09:19,and I'm just going up to him James.
00:09:19,00:09:22,"Why don't you have a, oh, you can do that with them too."
00:09:22,00:09:27,- D.H. Lawrence had a cow called Susan.
00:09:27,00:09:27,- Degrees.
00:09:27,00:09:29,"- Yeah, which he loved and wrote so a lot about."
00:09:29,00:09:32,And there's one other celebrity cow that I found.
00:09:32,00:09:35,"Elmpharm Olly, also known as the Sky Queen,"
00:09:35,00:09:38,was the first cow to fly an aeroplane to fly in an aeroplane.
00:09:38,00:09:41,(all laughing)
00:09:41,00:09:41,The Sky Queen was the first.
00:09:41,00:09:44,- She struggled with landing for a while.
00:09:44,00:09:46,She was at the controls.
00:09:46,00:09:48,"- That's how I got over the moon, right?"
00:09:48,00:09:50,(all laughing)
00:09:50,00:09:52,"- Yeah, so she was the first cow to fly in an aeroplane."
00:09:52,00:09:56,It was in 1930 at the International Air Exposition in Missouri.
00:09:56,00:09:58,A man called El's Worth Bunts became the first man
00:09:58,00:10:00,to milk a cow mid-flight.
00:10:00,00:10:01,Which he did in that flight.
00:10:01,00:10:06,He parachuted calm some milk down to the spectators below.
00:10:06,00:10:09,"- That is the stupid one, brilliant thing."
00:10:09,00:10:10,That's fantastic.
00:10:10,00:10:10,- Right.
00:10:10,00:10:13,"- Another thing that, sorry, another thing that..."
00:10:13,00:10:14,- Oh my God.
00:10:14,00:10:18,"- If that was intentional, then you're fired from the podcast."
00:10:18,00:10:23,- Another thing that affects cow lactation is slow songs.
00:10:23,00:10:25,"Apparently if you play slow ballads to a cow,"
00:10:25,00:10:27,then their lactation increases.
00:10:27,00:10:29,"But if you play fast, clubby songs to a cow,"
00:10:29,00:10:32,I think it was described as Euro Club Classics.
00:10:32,00:10:34,There's no effect on lactation at all.
00:10:34,00:10:35,- What the Euro Club Classics are.
00:10:35,00:10:36,- Yeah.
00:10:36,00:10:38,"- I fall 65, probably that one."
00:10:38,00:10:41,"- I'm a new, DVD, DVD, DVD."
00:10:41,00:10:41,(all laughing)
00:10:41,00:10:42,Thank you very much.
00:10:42,00:10:45,(upbeat music)
00:10:45,00:10:47,"- Okay, time for fact number two,"
00:10:47,00:10:50,which this week is James Harkin.
00:10:50,00:10:54,"- Okay, my fact is that it's illegal to take a selfie"
00:10:54,00:10:57,with a tiger in New York City.
00:10:57,00:10:58,- What?
00:10:58,00:10:59,- A big question.
00:10:59,00:11:00,(all laughing)
00:11:00,00:11:01,"- Well, it kind of speaks for itself, really."
00:11:01,00:11:03,This is a new law that's come in.
00:11:03,00:11:05,And it prohibits direct contact
00:11:05,00:11:08,between members of the public and big cats.
00:11:08,00:11:11,So it's like with traveling circuses or that kind of thing.
00:11:11,00:11:14,"And really, it's that you're not allowed any photos,"
00:11:14,00:11:16,but obviously the press have put it forward
00:11:16,00:11:17,as no tiger selfies.
00:11:17,00:11:20,Because apparently tiger selfies are a thing
00:11:20,00:11:21,on our dating websites.
00:11:21,00:11:23,"- Yes, to make..."
00:11:23,00:11:24,I've just realized someone's told me about this.
00:11:24,00:11:27,"And to make men look extra manly, apparently,"
00:11:27,00:11:29,they photograph themselves next to big...
00:11:29,00:11:30,- It's completely animal.
00:11:30,00:11:32,- It's simultaneously manly and cuddly.
00:11:32,00:11:34,"Because you're cuddling a tiger, but it's a tiger."
00:11:34,00:11:36,"- Oh, no, Alex, we've done it, haven't you?"
00:11:36,00:11:38,"- I have a, I haven't seen it."
00:11:38,00:11:40,"I have visited the blog, which I found this morning"
00:11:40,00:11:41,called Tinder Guys with Tigers.
00:11:41,00:11:43,"- But actually, thinking about it now,"
00:11:43,00:11:45,"if you're next to a tiger,"
00:11:45,00:11:47,"the tiger is big and manly and well, not manly,"
00:11:47,00:11:50,"but big and powerful, and next to him,"
00:11:50,00:11:52,you're just going to look less powerful.
00:11:52,00:11:54,"So you want to be next to a really weak,"
00:11:54,00:11:55,like a hamster or something.
00:11:55,00:11:56,- There's lots of baby tiger photos.
00:11:56,00:11:57,"- Ah, there."
00:11:57,00:11:59,- Or maybe women will be very disappointed
00:11:59,00:12:00,"on the eventual dates,"
00:12:00,00:12:03,'cause they assumed that it was the tiger in the photo.
00:12:03,00:12:05,(laughing)
00:12:05,00:12:07,"Well, this is the technique that was surely first"
00:12:07,00:12:09,patented by Vladimir Putin.
00:12:09,00:12:10,"- Oh, yeah."
00:12:10,00:12:12,- Who has photos taken with every wild animal.
00:12:12,00:12:14,"- But they're many dead, aren't they?"
00:12:14,00:12:15,"- No, there's a lot of the wild animals."
00:12:15,00:12:17,"- He does some hunting ones,"
00:12:17,00:12:19,but it's genuinely Putin swimming with dolphins on the internet.
00:12:19,00:12:21,- Dolphins who are previously enemies ganged off him again.
00:12:21,00:12:24,(laughing)
00:12:26,00:12:27,- He's trying to ban blow-hole sex.
00:12:27,00:12:29,(laughing)
00:12:29,00:12:33,"- That's that I have, right there."
00:12:33,00:12:37,"- I was looking into history of selfies,"
00:12:37,00:12:38,'cause it seems quite like a modern thing.
00:12:38,00:12:40,So I had a look.
00:12:40,00:12:45,The earliest photograph of a person in American history
00:12:45,00:12:47,is actually a selfie.
00:12:47,00:12:49,"It was taken by a guy called Robert Cornelius,"
00:12:49,00:12:51,and he took it in 1839.
00:12:51,00:12:52,"He was a lampmaker,"
00:12:52,00:12:54,and he was responsible for developing a process
00:12:54,00:12:57,"called Daggeropty, which was a short-lived photographic process"
00:12:57,00:12:59,"of some sort, which is probably during the 1840s."
00:12:59,00:13:01,The process was so slow that he was actually able
00:13:01,00:13:03,to set up the camera and then run into shot
00:13:03,00:13:04,"for about a minute or so,"
00:13:04,00:13:07,"and then close the lens cap, which is quite, quite more--"
00:13:07,00:13:09,"- And the photos were called Daggeroptyps,"
00:13:09,00:13:10,whether that was it.
00:13:10,00:13:12,"- Wikipedia describes the photo,"
00:13:12,00:13:15,which you can go and see as an off-center portrait
00:13:15,00:13:17,of a man with crossed arms and tautled hair.
00:13:17,00:13:19,"So I reckon it would be pretty well on Instagram,"
00:13:19,00:13:20,'cause that's pretty close to the mark.
00:13:20,00:13:23,"For the first selfie, that's pretty well done."
00:13:23,00:13:24,- Yeah.
00:13:24,00:13:26,- Do we think that was the first self-portrait?
00:13:26,00:13:28,"No, 'cause people have been drawing themselves for years,"
00:13:28,00:13:31,"but I had a look into what the first ever,"
00:13:31,00:13:34,"there's a collection of lines in a cave,"
00:13:34,00:13:39,"which may be a drawing of a face, 27,000 years old."
00:13:39,00:13:42,"- We're kind of assuming this is the same person who drew it,"
00:13:42,00:13:44,"though, if we're saying it's a selfie."
00:13:44,00:13:46,"- Exactly, yeah, it's open to debate."
00:13:46,00:13:48,- There are a few lines next to it
00:13:48,00:13:49,that look a bit like a tiger.
00:13:49,00:13:50,(laughing)
00:13:50,00:13:52,- 19th century portraits are fun.
00:13:52,00:13:55,We talked about the headless photos.
00:13:55,00:13:57,"- Headless photos, so."
00:13:57,00:13:59,"- So, yeah, Victorions like to photograph themselves"
00:13:59,00:14:01,"headless, I think, and carrying their heads"
00:14:01,00:14:03,or with their heads and their laps.
00:14:03,00:14:05,They managed to doctor photos from a really early time.
00:14:05,00:14:08,So you get portraits from the 1850s and '60s
00:14:08,00:14:09,with their head and their--
00:14:09,00:14:10,- They were necessarily doctors.
00:14:10,00:14:11,They were like illusions.
00:14:11,00:14:13,- They actually didn't cut heads.
00:14:13,00:14:15,- The photo was so prestigious back then
00:14:15,00:14:17,that you would have your own head cut off
00:14:17,00:14:18,to have a photo made of you
00:14:18,00:14:20,so that it would look better.
00:14:20,00:14:20,"- No, it only worked."
00:14:20,00:14:22,"- A lot of them would be, like, it's hard to describe,"
00:14:22,00:14:24,but there would be illusions.
00:14:24,00:14:26,"So you'd have two people in the photo,"
00:14:26,00:14:28,and one person would be sort of on the end of a table
00:14:28,00:14:29,with their head resting on it
00:14:29,00:14:32,and the rest of their body sort of out of shot.
00:14:32,00:14:34,And then another person would be organized in a way
00:14:34,00:14:36,that you didn't look like their head was there
00:14:36,00:14:37,"and when you line up, it looked like their head was not"
00:14:37,00:14:38,where it's supposed to be.
00:14:38,00:14:40,"- Oh, that's very good."
00:14:40,00:14:42,"And have you heard of, have you heard of snap shooting,"
00:14:42,00:14:44,which was a game that people played?
00:14:44,00:14:44,- No.
00:14:44,00:14:46,- This is in the very early days of handheld cameras.
00:14:46,00:14:47,It's so much fun.
00:14:47,00:14:48,You had to escape while someone else tried
00:14:48,00:14:49,to take a photo of you.
00:14:49,00:14:51,"- Oh, it's not cool."
00:14:51,00:14:52,- That's quite good.
00:14:52,00:14:54,- It's a bit like laser quest.
00:14:54,00:14:56,"- Yeah, but it's laser quest."
00:14:56,00:14:57,"Well, you don't know the results for three days"
00:14:57,00:14:59,until you've had the photos developed.
00:14:59,00:15:00,- It sounds like a fun game.
00:15:00,00:15:03,"- This is really interesting, I thought."
00:15:03,00:15:07,"So, after National Geographic published its first wildlife"
00:15:07,00:15:10,"photographs in 1906 in the magazine,"
00:15:10,00:15:13,and two of the National Geographic Society board members
00:15:13,00:15:16,"resigned in disgust, 'cause wildlife photos."
00:15:16,00:15:18,- They said it was becoming a mere picture book
00:15:18,00:15:20,and that wasn't what the National Geographic was all about.
00:15:20,00:15:21,- Wow.
00:15:21,00:15:22,- Yeah.
00:15:22,00:15:23,- A few more selfie things.
00:15:23,00:15:26,"You know these selfie stick, yes, of course."
00:15:26,00:15:29,"There's a thing called a selfie stick, do you know what that is?"
00:15:29,00:15:30,- A selfie stick.
00:15:30,00:15:33,"- Well, a selfie, I know, to my shame,"
00:15:33,00:15:35,is a selfie of your own bottom.
00:15:35,00:15:36,- Yes.
00:15:36,00:15:37,- So is a stick to take a photo of your own bottom?
00:15:37,00:15:38,- That's right.
00:15:38,00:15:39,- A self-colonist could be cute.
00:15:39,00:15:41,(all laughing)
00:15:41,00:15:43,"- No, it's not that."
00:15:43,00:15:44,"- The article I read said,"
00:15:44,00:15:47,"it's curiously out of stock at the moment,"
00:15:47,00:15:49,but is ostensibly a real product.
00:15:49,00:15:50,So I'm not sure if it's even real.
00:15:50,00:15:51,- Okay.
00:15:51,00:15:53,"- But the idea is that you hold it,"
00:15:53,00:15:54,"and then it takes a picture of your bum,"
00:15:54,00:15:56,"and then you can send it to people, presumably."
00:15:56,00:15:58,You want to see that kind of thing?
00:15:58,00:15:59,"- Oh, Brave New World."
00:15:59,00:16:01,(all laughing)
00:16:01,00:16:04,- The Statue of Liberty is taking one continuous long selfie.
00:16:04,00:16:05,I found this on Reddit today.
00:16:05,00:16:10,"There's her hand, which is holding up the torch."
00:16:10,00:16:11,"There's a camera video camera,"
00:16:11,00:16:13,"which you can stream a live feed from online,"
00:16:13,00:16:15,"and it's pointing down to her face,"
00:16:15,00:16:16,so she's taking one.
00:16:16,00:16:16,- Wow.
00:16:16,00:16:17,- That is great.
00:16:17,00:16:18,- That is really good.
00:16:18,00:16:19,- That's such a good fact.
00:16:19,00:16:20,- Yeah.
00:16:20,00:16:21,- Vain as women in the world.
00:16:21,00:16:22,(all laughing)
00:16:22,00:16:23,- Does anyone have more?
00:16:23,00:16:25,- Some stuff about things illegal in New York.
00:16:25,00:16:26,"- Oh, yeah."
00:16:26,00:16:28,"- Okay, so it's strangely,"
00:16:28,00:16:31,"it's illegal to honk your horn in New York City,"
00:16:31,00:16:32,unless it's an emergency.
00:16:32,00:16:34,"- So that's another still accuracy then,"
00:16:34,00:16:36,"because anytime there's an establishing shot of New York,"
00:16:36,00:16:37,"there's a soundtrack,"
00:16:37,00:16:38,there's lots of lots of hallways.
00:16:38,00:16:39,"- No, no, no, no, that's not true."
00:16:39,00:16:40,- It's just that everyone's breaking the law.
00:16:40,00:16:43,"- All right, there's a constant state of emergency."
00:16:43,00:16:46,(all laughing)
00:16:46,00:16:48,It's also illegal for three or more people
00:16:48,00:16:49,to dance in New York City.
00:16:49,00:16:50,- What?
00:16:50,00:16:52,- This is the rave laws that they have there.
00:16:52,00:16:53,So what constitutes a rave?
00:16:53,00:16:55,- Also in the same place.
00:16:55,00:16:57,"- Yeah, you can have a book in the appointment with the city."
00:16:57,00:16:58,- Can I dance now?
00:16:58,00:17:00,- But what do you mean in the same place?
00:17:00,00:17:03,"- It's okay if you're in your own home, actually."
00:17:03,00:17:06,But it's gonna be the people in your home have to be yourself.
00:17:06,00:17:09,People who live there are bona fide guests.
00:17:09,00:17:11,It's legal in churches.
00:17:11,00:17:14,"And weirdly, it's also legal in premises licensed"
00:17:14,00:17:16,as retail cigarette dealers.
00:17:16,00:17:18,"- The cigarette buying dance, yeah."
00:17:18,00:17:20,(all laughing)
00:17:20,00:17:22,- So if you're in a bar and three of you are dancing?
00:17:22,00:17:24,- You need a dancing license.
00:17:24,00:17:25,- You need a dancing license.
00:17:25,00:17:27,- All so the bar might have a dancing license.
00:17:27,00:17:29,"- Yeah, all the white constitutes an illegal rave."
00:17:29,00:17:33,"And also, pinball machines are illegal in a lot of America,"
00:17:33,00:17:35,but in New York until the 70s.
00:17:35,00:17:36,- Wow.
00:17:36,00:17:38,- It was because it was kind of gambling.
00:17:38,00:17:40,"And in the 1940s, Mayor Lagadia smashed up"
00:17:40,00:17:43,a load of pinball machines in front of the press
00:17:43,00:17:44,and threw them in the sea.
00:17:44,00:17:46,- He threw the press into the sea.
00:17:46,00:17:48,(all laughing)
00:17:48,00:17:51,"- Recently, the Mayor of Riga drove a tank"
00:17:51,00:17:54,over an illegally parked car to make a point.
00:17:54,00:17:56,Although he had illegally parked the car himself.
00:17:56,00:17:59,So it wasn't just a random illegal parked car.
00:17:59,00:18:01,"- Well, it was the point he was making"
00:18:01,00:18:02,that look at my big tank.
00:18:02,00:18:04,(all laughing)
00:18:04,00:18:05,"- Yeah, clearly."
00:18:05,00:18:06,- That's true.
00:18:06,00:18:08,"- Literally, it was parked properly."
00:18:08,00:18:10,- Big issues in Latvia.
00:18:10,00:18:11,- What were we talking about?
00:18:11,00:18:12,"Hey, we're talking about it now."
00:18:12,00:18:13,So it's worked.
00:18:13,00:18:15,"- Yeah, actually, guys, I'm double parked out there."
00:18:15,00:18:17,So I'm just gonna have to go
00:18:17,00:18:18,before the bear of Riga get laid.
00:18:18,00:18:21,(upbeat music)
00:18:21,00:18:26,"- All right, time for fact number three, which is Anna."
00:18:26,00:18:27,"- Yep, my fact this week is that"
00:18:27,00:18:29,Morgh refrigerators in Turkey
00:18:29,00:18:32,"are equipped with motion sensors, alarms,"
00:18:32,00:18:34,and handles that open them from the inside
00:18:34,00:18:36,in case anyone in there wakes up.
00:18:36,00:18:38,"- Perfectly, perfectly sensible precaution."
00:18:38,00:18:39,- I think so.
00:18:39,00:18:40,- Does it happen?
00:18:40,00:18:41,Ever?
00:18:41,00:18:43,"- I don't think there's been any instances,"
00:18:43,00:18:45,certainly not in that place of it happening.
00:18:45,00:18:48,But I think there's a widespread paranoia
00:18:48,00:18:49,in that area of Turkey.
00:18:49,00:18:51,It's in Malatia in Turkey.
00:18:51,00:18:53,"And they have, yeah, so they've got like door handles"
00:18:53,00:18:54,on the inside.
00:18:54,00:18:57,"There are sensors all around the inside compartment,"
00:18:57,00:18:59,"so that if anything touches the walls,"
00:18:59,00:19:01,then automatically the drawer comes open.
00:19:01,00:19:03,So the corpse is free to leave.
00:19:03,00:19:06,"- But corpses move around a little bit, don't they?"
00:19:06,00:19:08,"- Because of escaping gases,"
00:19:08,00:19:09,and I think eventually Riga wants to leave.
00:19:09,00:19:11,"- Absolutely, but not very much."
00:19:11,00:19:13,- And also when they become zombies.
00:19:13,00:19:14,- Yes.
00:19:14,00:19:15,- That is a concern.
00:19:15,00:19:17,"- In which case, why have we built easy access?"
00:19:17,00:19:18,"- Yes, it's easy access."
00:19:18,00:19:19,- More compartments.
00:19:19,00:19:20,- That's true.
00:19:20,00:19:22,"If the zombie apocalypse happens,"
00:19:22,00:19:23,"these are gonna be the first guys out, aren't they?"
00:19:23,00:19:26,"- Yeah, and they'll let all the others out."
00:19:26,00:19:27,"- In the 19th century,"
00:19:27,00:19:30,there was no reliable indicator for death.
00:19:30,00:19:32,People did not know that it was your heartbeat.
00:19:32,00:19:34,- But that's still kind of true
00:19:34,00:19:36,because it could be brain activity.
00:19:36,00:19:38,- That's true.
00:19:38,00:19:41,- So I think actually there is a slight kind of argument
00:19:41,00:19:44,"about how you can actually say that someone's dead,"
00:19:44,00:19:44,"whether it's the heartbeat,"
00:19:44,00:19:46,whether it's the brain activity or whether it's...
00:19:46,00:19:47,- Yeah.
00:19:47,00:19:48,- It's almost like we know so much now
00:19:48,00:19:50,that we've blurred the boundary that we originally set.
00:19:50,00:19:51,- Yeah.
00:19:51,00:19:52,"- Well, they just didn't have a boundary at all."
00:19:52,00:19:53,"- They knew nothing at all of it,"
00:19:53,00:19:57,and they had competitions to enter
00:19:57,00:19:59,"where you would be given 1,500 francs"
00:19:59,00:20:02,if you worked out an easy and reliable sign of death.
00:20:02,00:20:03,"The winner was the heartbeat,"
00:20:03,00:20:05,"and it was the man Eugene Bouchou,"
00:20:05,00:20:07,"who invented the stethoscope,"
00:20:07,00:20:10,and Eugene Bouchou sounds like
00:20:10,00:20:12,what you might hear down a stethoscope as well.
00:20:12,00:20:14,(all laughing)
00:20:14,00:20:15,"- But it was fantastic,"
00:20:15,00:20:17,and he got a lot of criticism for being so impetuous
00:20:17,00:20:19,as to say that you could bury someone
00:20:19,00:20:22,only two minutes after ascertaining that they were dead.
00:20:22,00:20:23,"Everyone else said, ""No, no, no, no, you should wait,"""
00:20:23,00:20:25,and it took years.
00:20:25,00:20:27,"- Did you say that he invented the stethoscope, sorry?"
00:20:27,00:20:28,"- Sorry, he didn't."
00:20:28,00:20:29,"- Ah, yeah."
00:20:29,00:20:31,Because the stethoscope was invented by a guy
00:20:31,00:20:35,who was embarrassed when he had to take the heartbeat
00:20:35,00:20:37,"of a particularly booksome lady, wasn't it?"
00:20:37,00:20:39,And the way that he used to do it
00:20:39,00:20:42,"was you would put your head right down next to someone's chest,"
00:20:42,00:20:45,and he was embarrassed to kind of go into the breast area.
00:20:45,00:20:47,- So he left her alone.
00:20:47,00:20:49,"""Excuse me while I go and invent something."""
00:20:49,00:20:51,(all laughing)
00:20:51,00:20:52,"- I might be wrong about this,"
00:20:52,00:20:54,but I think he did it with a rolled-up newspaper
00:20:54,00:20:55,"or something, and thought,"
00:20:55,00:20:56,"""Well, this works quite well,"
00:20:56,00:20:58,"and now I'm gonna make something even better."""
00:20:58,00:21:00,I might be wrong about the last bit.
00:21:00,00:21:01,- I'm not sure.
00:21:01,00:21:04,"- The other ideas suggested for the prize included,"
00:21:04,00:21:05,sticking a thermometer into the stomach
00:21:05,00:21:07,to see if you were cold enough to be buried.
00:21:07,00:21:09,"- To the rectum, would be good."
00:21:09,00:21:11,- I don't think anyone suggested that for this.
00:21:11,00:21:12,- Because you've got two different ways.
00:21:12,00:21:15,"One, the shock of having something up your bum,"
00:21:15,00:21:16,"and two, the temperature."
00:21:16,00:21:17,"- Yes, yeah."
00:21:17,00:21:20,"- Okay, well, they're not actually still taking"
00:21:20,00:21:22,"submissions, but I will pass it on."
00:21:22,00:21:24,"- Well, that?"
00:21:24,00:21:27,- They also had attaching pinces to the nipples
00:21:27,00:21:28,of the brisium corpse.
00:21:28,00:21:30,"Scott, just burning the patient's arm"
00:21:30,00:21:33,with boiling water and seeing what happened.
00:21:33,00:21:36,"Putting a multitude of leeches near the bottom,"
00:21:36,00:21:38,or sticking it to my wife.
00:21:38,00:21:40,"- Or sticking a very long needle with a flag at one end,"
00:21:40,00:21:42,into the heart.
00:21:42,00:21:43,"And if the patient was alive,"
00:21:43,00:21:45,"and there was any movement, the flag would wave a bit."
00:21:45,00:21:46,- What?
00:21:46,00:21:47,- And not for long.
00:21:47,00:21:49,"- And then when he died, it would come down to half mass,"
00:21:49,00:21:50,doesn't it?
00:21:50,00:21:53,- One doctor said that the patient's tongue
00:21:53,00:21:55,should be rhythmically pulled for three hours.
00:21:55,00:21:59,"- We should say, a lot of this is from a fantastic book"
00:21:59,00:22:01,"by John Bonderson called ""Berry Delive,"""
00:22:01,00:22:04,and it has a huge amount of unbelievably interesting
00:22:04,00:22:07,information about this cultural fear over the centuries.
00:22:07,00:22:09,- Since you mentioned putting stuff up the anus.
00:22:09,00:22:11,"In the late 18th century,"
00:22:11,00:22:14,doctors William Hawes and Thomas Cogan decided
00:22:14,00:22:17,the best treatment for someone who seemed dead
00:22:17,00:22:19,after drowning was a tobacco enema.
00:22:19,00:22:22,"And so they used to shove things up your anus, didn't they?"
00:22:22,00:22:24,And that had like a dual purpose
00:22:24,00:22:26,of testing if someone was dead.
00:22:26,00:22:28,- By giving you a nice hit of tobacco.
00:22:28,00:22:30,- Exactly.
00:22:30,00:22:32,"And it was thought that, first of all,"
00:22:32,00:22:34,they would warm up the drowned person
00:22:34,00:22:36,by pumping tobacco up their bum.
00:22:36,00:22:38,"And second, it was stimulate their respiration again."
00:22:38,00:22:41,And it got a lot more popular when they started doing it
00:22:41,00:22:43,"with bellows, so they were a kid."
00:22:43,00:22:44,"So before this, they were just doing it"
00:22:44,00:22:46,with their mouth to the barn.
00:22:46,00:22:49,"- No, mouth to arse resuscitation."
00:22:49,00:22:52,"- Yeah, it was mouth to bone resuscitation,"
00:22:52,00:22:53,which is problematic.
00:22:53,00:22:54,"'Cause a lot of people had died of illnesses,"
00:22:54,00:22:57,which involve quite a lot of fecal matter being infected.
00:22:57,00:22:59,"So quite a few people who tried this,"
00:22:59,00:23:01,doctors who tried this ended up dying themselves.
00:23:01,00:23:03,"- To be fair, they were supposed to blow, not suck."
00:23:03,00:23:04,"- Yeah, exactly, yeah, they did it wrong."
00:23:04,00:23:07,"- But then once that doctor's died, presumably,"
00:23:07,00:23:09,"another doctor will come along and say,"
00:23:09,00:23:10,"""My god, this patient has died."
00:23:10,00:23:11,"I must resuscitate it."""
00:23:11,00:23:13,This is an awful chamber reaction.
00:23:13,00:23:15,"If you've just stuck tobacco up someone's ass,"
00:23:15,00:23:16,then you're going to suck instead of blow
00:23:16,00:23:18,because you've basically made a human cigarette.
00:23:18,00:23:21,- A human cigarette?
00:23:21,00:23:23,- It's going to be the sequel to the human's entity.
00:23:23,00:23:25,- They used to hang those tobacco enema bellows
00:23:25,00:23:27,"up by the River Thames, where you would have life"
00:23:27,00:23:32,"built today or life rings, they would just have as standard."
00:23:32,00:23:35,- Have you guys heard of the Totenhaus?
00:23:35,00:23:35,- No.
00:23:35,00:23:38,- So these were literally that means house of the dead.
00:23:38,00:23:40,"Obviously that's their 19th century Germany,"
00:23:40,00:23:41,they're very popular.
00:23:41,00:23:42,"These were basically large halls,"
00:23:42,00:23:45,"which are sometimes very lavish and are nearly decorated,"
00:23:45,00:23:47,in which bodies were kept for several days
00:23:47,00:23:49,to ensure that they were really dead.
00:23:49,00:23:50,I think this is a pretty grim job.
00:23:50,00:23:51,"If you were an attendant at this hall,"
00:23:51,00:23:54,"you had possibly had 12 hour shifts,"
00:23:54,00:23:55,"waiting for any signs of life,"
00:23:55,00:23:57,"terrifying, horrible job."
00:23:57,00:23:59,- But quite easy actually.
00:23:59,00:24:00,- So what's a call?
00:24:00,00:24:02,"- Not a lot of times at which anyone actually wakes up,"
00:24:02,00:24:03,I guess.
00:24:03,00:24:06,"- Yeah, but if you missed that one time then, yeah."
00:24:06,00:24:08,"- If you fell asleep at like one, five minute window."
00:24:08,00:24:10,"- When that zombie apocalypse happened,"
00:24:10,00:24:11,"they all came and I'm like,"
00:24:11,00:24:12,"Jeff, what were you doing?"
00:24:12,00:24:14,You were supposed to be watching them.
00:24:14,00:24:16,"- It just woke up as an empty hall and you're like,"
00:24:16,00:24:17,"oh, shit."
00:24:17,00:24:20,"- Yeah, the Paris Marg actually,"
00:24:20,00:24:23,"was around the turn of the 20th century,"
00:24:23,00:24:27,it was arguably the most popular tourist destination
00:24:27,00:24:29,in Paris and that's at a time when
00:24:29,00:24:31,the Eiffel Tower was built as well.
00:24:31,00:24:34,"They were getting up to 40,000 visitors in a single day."
00:24:34,00:24:37,- Did you start with mentalist items as well?
00:24:37,00:24:38,They were in some weird tourist attractions.
00:24:38,00:24:40,- Last week I was in Portugal and anyone who follows me
00:24:40,00:24:42,"on Twitter will know this already,"
00:24:42,00:24:45,but I went to a bone chapel.
00:24:45,00:24:49,"It was in Evora, which is the town in the middle of Portugal."
00:24:49,00:24:52,And it was made by the monks and they took all of the bodies
00:24:52,00:24:56,out of the town and then sort of put them on the walls
00:24:56,00:24:57,in like some kind of weird...
00:24:57,00:24:58,- Tiling.
00:24:58,00:25:00,"- Yeah, it's like tiling, yeah."
00:25:00,00:25:01,- Wow.
00:25:01,00:25:02,- So it decorates the whole chapel.
00:25:02,00:25:04,- The best thing about it was I took a photo of it
00:25:04,00:25:06,and put it on Facebook and Facebook recognized the skulls
00:25:06,00:25:09,"and tried to make me tag with them as my friends,"
00:25:09,00:25:11,because they were people.
00:25:11,00:25:12,- That's crazy.
00:25:12,00:25:13,- So they've just got real skeletons?
00:25:13,00:25:14,"- Yeah, real skeletons, yeah."
00:25:14,00:25:15,- Hanging up.
00:25:15,00:25:17,"- And they have actual dead bodies as well,"
00:25:17,00:25:19,"but when we were there, the dead bodies"
00:25:19,00:25:22,would be taken down for restoration.
00:25:22,00:25:24,(laughing)
00:25:24,00:25:24,- Yeah.
00:25:24,00:25:26,- But it was supposed to be a place where you would go
00:25:26,00:25:29,when you would think about your mortality and whatever.
00:25:29,00:25:31,- So you know a memento moris?
00:25:31,00:25:31,- No.
00:25:31,00:25:34,"- Well, there are kind of things that remind us"
00:25:34,00:25:35,"that you're going to die, basically,"
00:25:35,00:25:39,and that all this is temporary and all flesh is dust
00:25:39,00:25:40,and all of this stuff.
00:25:40,00:25:42,So it's just something to remind you.
00:25:42,00:25:44,"So in lots of many of the Renaissance pictures,"
00:25:44,00:25:48,"there's a skull there, just to point out you're gonna die."
00:25:48,00:25:49,(laughing)
00:25:49,00:25:51,- Just like watching countdown.
00:25:51,00:25:52,"- Oh, can you hear that?"
00:25:52,00:25:55,- The memento mori and countdown could be the big clock.
00:25:55,00:25:56,"- Oh, that's crazy."
00:25:56,00:25:57,"- Dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude."
00:25:57,00:25:58,- Dom.
00:25:58,00:26:01,(laughing)
00:26:01,00:26:02,- Dom.
00:26:02,00:26:04,(laughing)
00:26:04,00:26:06,"- Oh, basically, as well as a memento mori,"
00:26:06,00:26:09,"there's also a memento vivare, which is a really nice thing."
00:26:09,00:26:11,It's a reminder that you are alive
00:26:11,00:26:12,and to take pleasure in life.
00:26:12,00:26:14,And you don't really hear much about it.
00:26:14,00:26:17,- So there was a thread of people who worked in morturies
00:26:17,00:26:19,comparing their experiences.
00:26:19,00:26:22,And there was someone who'd had a job in a mortuary
00:26:22,00:26:24,"and they got in someone who'd died,"
00:26:24,00:26:25,who'd been a hand model.
00:26:25,00:26:26,"And he said it was really weird,"
00:26:26,00:26:27,"'cause he went into the service,"
00:26:27,00:26:29,the funeral service that they were having
00:26:29,00:26:31,and they have lots of photographs up all over the place.
00:26:31,00:26:33,And almost all of the photographs
00:26:33,00:26:34,were just of this person's hand.
00:26:34,00:26:37,(laughing)
00:26:37,00:26:38,- So it was a funeral of that character
00:26:38,00:26:39,from the Adam's family.
00:26:39,00:26:41,(laughing)
00:26:41,00:26:42,- That's a thing.
00:26:42,00:26:45,- There was another one where a clown had died
00:26:45,00:26:47,and the person was buried in full clown costume.
00:26:47,00:26:48,The whole family were clowns.
00:26:48,00:26:50,All the friends were clowns
00:26:50,00:26:51,"and at the family's request,"
00:26:51,00:26:54,the funeral directors had to dress up as clowns as well.
00:26:54,00:26:58,- Didn't the shoes not fit in the coffin?
00:26:58,00:26:59,- They put him in the coffin
00:26:59,00:27:00,and all the sides fell out of it.
00:27:00,00:27:02,(laughing)
00:27:02,00:27:05,(upbeat music)
00:27:05,00:27:08,"- Okay, and the final fact is my fact this week"
00:27:08,00:27:12,and it is that Henry VIII had two official cradle rockers
00:27:12,00:27:14,who were paid three pounds a year each to rock his cradle.
00:27:14,00:27:17,"I should stress, this is when he was a baby."
00:27:17,00:27:20,- I had a great image in my head before you told me that.
00:27:20,00:27:22,- Three pounds a year would have been a lot
00:27:22,00:27:23,"in those days, presumably."
00:27:23,00:27:26,"- It would have been more, but not a huge amount."
00:27:26,00:27:29,"- And also my question is, did they go in shifts"
00:27:29,00:27:32,or did they need two people to rock one cradle?
00:27:32,00:27:35,"- Well, his cradle was massive."
00:27:35,00:27:37,It was five feet long and two feet wide
00:27:37,00:27:38,and this is the rocking one as well.
00:27:38,00:27:39,This isn't just a crib for a baby.
00:27:39,00:27:41,This is an actual rocking cradle.
00:27:41,00:27:43,Suspended from a wooden canvas
00:27:43,00:27:45,covered with crimson cloth of gold
00:27:45,00:27:48,and trimmed with ermine and it was ridiculous.
00:27:48,00:27:50,"- Nice, it was Henry VIII, he went in."
00:27:50,00:27:53,"- Well, not at the time, it was just a small baby at the time."
00:27:53,00:27:54,"- His daughter, was it married the first time,"
00:27:54,00:27:56,even she had four cradle rockers?
00:27:56,00:27:57,- Four.
00:27:57,00:27:58,"- Yeah, and she had two cribs as well."
00:27:58,00:28:00,"She had an everyday cradle, which was silver and gold,"
00:28:00,00:28:02,"I think, and then a cradle of estate"
00:28:02,00:28:04,for special occasions for receiving visitors.
00:28:04,00:28:08,- The current queen has 733 cradle rockers.
00:28:08,00:28:09,(laughing)
00:28:09,00:28:11,Just goes up every time because they want to outdo
00:28:11,00:28:13,to take this one.
00:28:13,00:28:17,- Ever the sixth was given a baby replicate of a court
00:28:17,00:28:19,"when he was not yet one year old, he had a chamberlain,"
00:28:19,00:28:21,"a vice chamberlain, a steward, a cofferer,"
00:28:21,00:28:22,lots of other stuff.
00:28:22,00:28:25,"- They were, they weren't other babies."
00:28:25,00:28:26,(laughing)
00:28:26,00:28:28,- That's a fantastic idea.
00:28:28,00:28:29,- Brilliant.
00:28:29,00:28:32,"- Yeah, that's the most adorable thing I can think of."
00:28:32,00:28:34,(laughing)
00:28:34,00:28:37,They're all dressed as what is a little Thomas Kramma baby
00:28:37,00:28:39,and there's a Walsby baby.
00:28:39,00:28:40,- That's how I imagine.
00:28:40,00:28:41,- Little CBB's is wrong.
00:28:41,00:28:43,(laughing)
00:28:43,00:28:47,"- No, so when Henry VIII's first son was born,"
00:28:47,00:28:50,"he Henry appointed him 40 staff immediately,"
00:28:50,00:28:53,including a baker and a keeper of the cellar for some reason.
00:28:53,00:28:55,"- It would be brilliant if they were babies as well,"
00:28:55,00:28:56,wasn't it?
00:28:56,00:28:59,- I just love this idea of just community of babies
00:28:59,00:29:00,looking up to you like a tiny bit.
00:29:00,00:29:01,"- Yeah, maybe a miniature bocky and palace."
00:29:01,00:29:05,"- This is the Muppet Babies of the Tudor Court, I don't like it."
00:29:05,00:29:07,"- They didn't call themselves Tudor, did they?"
00:29:07,00:29:08,Didn't like that.
00:29:08,00:29:09,"- No, what is that?"
00:29:09,00:29:12,- It reminded them of their Welsh background Tudor
00:29:12,00:29:13,and they didn't like that.
00:29:13,00:29:16,Henry VIII referred to himself as the embodiment
00:29:16,00:29:19,"of the union of the families of Lancaster in York,"
00:29:19,00:29:20,rather than Tudor.
00:29:20,00:29:21,"- Tudor snappier, isn't it?"
00:29:21,00:29:22,- It is snappier.
00:29:22,00:29:24,"It was like 100, 200, 200 years afterwards"
00:29:24,00:29:27,when it became more common.
00:29:27,00:29:30,"- Moving down the line, Queen Victoria."
00:29:30,00:29:32,"Well, she sounds like she had a phobia of babies."
00:29:32,00:29:35,She described them as rather disgusting.
00:29:35,00:29:37,She described her own babies as frog-like
00:29:37,00:29:39,"and frightful, went undressed."
00:29:39,00:29:41,And she had nine.
00:29:41,00:29:43,"- I know, I know, I know, I know."
00:29:43,00:29:44,"- Yes, you know."
00:29:44,00:29:45,- She's got a punishment.
00:29:45,00:29:46,- Yeah.
00:29:46,00:29:47,"- She, when she was a baby,"
00:29:47,00:29:52,her father described her as plump as a partridge
00:29:52,00:29:54,and more a pocket hercules and a pocket venus.
00:29:54,00:29:56,I think she was quite a fat baby.
00:29:56,00:29:59,- Hercules supposedly killed two snakes in his crib.
00:29:59,00:30:00,- Oh yeah.
00:30:00,00:30:01,- What did he do?
00:30:01,00:30:03,- I heard some vengeful goddess release them
00:30:03,00:30:04,"towards them, didn't he?"
00:30:04,00:30:05,And he smashed them together.
00:30:05,00:30:07,- Is that where the rattle was invented?
00:30:07,00:30:08,- Yes.
00:30:08,00:30:09,- He killed the snake.
00:30:09,00:30:10,- So they were rattle snakes.
00:30:10,00:30:11,- So they were rattle snakes.
00:30:11,00:30:12,- And then he turned around and used them as rattle.
00:30:12,00:30:13,"- And someone was like,"
00:30:13,00:30:14,"if I take out the snake aspect of this,"
00:30:14,00:30:16,it would make a great toy.
00:30:16,00:30:18,"- But Queen Victoria, named Victoria,"
00:30:18,00:30:18,very controversial.
00:30:18,00:30:20,Victoria wasn't really a name in Britain at the time.
00:30:20,00:30:21,Was it?
00:30:21,00:30:22,Not a girl's name.
00:30:22,00:30:24,And she was named after a mother who was German.
00:30:24,00:30:27,Got a lot of politicians and men at court
00:30:27,00:30:28,tried to make her change her name
00:30:28,00:30:29,when she was going to exceed to the throne.
00:30:29,00:30:30,- What too?
00:30:30,00:30:31,- Some more conventional.
00:30:31,00:30:33,So I think Elizabeth was suggested originally.
00:30:33,00:30:37,"- When the queen gave birth to Prince Charles,"
00:30:37,00:30:39,Prince Philip was playing squash at the time.
00:30:39,00:30:40,- That was easy.
00:30:40,00:30:41,- Yep.
00:30:41,00:30:42,- Did he leave the game?
00:30:42,00:30:43,"- No, the queen was a name of the 30 hours."
00:30:43,00:30:44,But he played squash.
00:30:44,00:30:46,- That's a lot of game of squash.
00:30:46,00:30:47,- He must have been tired at the end of that.
00:30:47,00:30:48,- He is.
00:30:48,00:30:50,- Someone was taking care of it.
00:30:50,00:30:51,- Well he just comes together.
00:30:51,00:30:52,I'm exhausted.
00:30:52,00:30:53,What a day it's been.
00:30:53,00:30:54,How was your day?
00:30:54,00:30:57,- Do you know swaddling?
00:30:57,00:30:58,- Yeah.
00:30:58,00:31:00,- Which is where you just restrict babies very tightly
00:31:00,00:31:02,in their movements for the first few months of their life.
00:31:02,00:31:03,It's incredible that this happened
00:31:03,00:31:05,"and that we still happens around the world, I think."
00:31:05,00:31:06,- Yeah.
00:31:06,00:31:08,"- Does it simulate woman environment, is that right?"
00:31:08,00:31:09,- I don't know.
00:31:09,00:31:11,And this used to happen.
00:31:11,00:31:13,Babies who were in their swaddling clothes
00:31:13,00:31:17,would sometimes be hung up from a nail on the wall
00:31:17,00:31:19,"which was to give their carrots,"
00:31:19,00:31:21,so you'd just sort of loop a bit of the swaddling
00:31:21,00:31:22,over a nail on the wall.
00:31:22,00:31:25,And the baby would just be entertained by its surroundings.
00:31:25,00:31:27,This is according to the Victoria and Albert Museum.
00:31:27,00:31:28,To give their carrots a rest
00:31:28,00:31:31,and to entertain them with the surrounding environment.
00:31:31,00:31:32,- Like a boy.
00:31:32,00:31:34,"- It's a really funny idea, like a wall mounted baby."
00:31:34,00:31:37,- It'd be good if you had like sex tubulets
00:31:37,00:31:38,and they were just hanging up around the hole.
00:31:38,00:31:40,"- Yeah, or you could put them like plaster ducks,"
00:31:40,00:31:42,you could put them going up in a diagonal line.
00:31:42,00:31:44,(laughing)
00:31:44,00:31:45,- It was phased out.
00:31:45,00:31:47,I think it was widely perceived as being bad
00:31:47,00:31:49,for the baby's health.
00:31:49,00:31:50,- Obviously.
00:31:50,00:31:55,- Cradles and cots.
00:31:55,00:31:58,"The first, in fact, actually I was looking into cradles"
00:31:58,00:32:00,"and cots on my side accidentally looking into prams,"
00:32:00,00:32:04,but the first pram was invented in 1733
00:32:04,00:32:05,and it was made to be pulled along.
00:32:05,00:32:07,So it was like a small pram and it had a harness.
00:32:07,00:32:09,So it could be pulled along by a goat or a dog.
00:32:09,00:32:11,(laughing)
00:32:11,00:32:11,- That's adorable.
00:32:11,00:32:13,I imagine the mini Henry VIII baby
00:32:13,00:32:15,being pulled along by a dog.
00:32:15,00:32:17,- A dog and the goats who are best friends.
00:32:17,00:32:18,"- Oh, god."
00:32:18,00:32:20,- It just needs film lines to tell.
00:32:20,00:32:22,(laughing)
00:32:22,00:32:24,- Pram is short for prambulator.
00:32:24,00:32:25,- Yeah.
00:32:25,00:32:26,"- But there was no one walking, I guess."
00:32:26,00:32:27,- That's true.
00:32:27,00:32:28,- It was being pulled by an animal.
00:32:28,00:32:30,"- Well, the dog and the goat would have been walking to it."
00:32:30,00:32:31,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:32:31,00:32:32,- Walking into our hearts.
00:32:32,00:32:33,(laughing)
00:32:33,00:32:34,- Jesus.
00:32:34,00:32:36,"- They called the first prams,"
00:32:36,00:32:37,that when prams started becoming popular
00:32:37,00:32:38,"in the mid 19th century,"
00:32:38,00:32:40,I think they were called male carts
00:32:40,00:32:42,'cause they were based on design for male carts
00:32:42,00:32:44,when you just push like big packages along.
00:32:44,00:32:46,- And 'cause female babies weren't loud in them.
00:32:46,00:32:49,(laughing)
00:32:49,00:32:50,- I read that.
00:32:50,00:32:52,"There's one book I've read this in and I can't find it verified,"
00:32:52,00:32:55,"but children's cots were initially used to be bassinets,"
00:32:55,00:32:56,which would just sit on the floor.
00:32:56,00:32:58,And then they were raised off the floor due to a perception
00:32:58,00:33:01,that there were noxious fumes that existed below knee level
00:33:01,00:33:04,and explosive vapors that existed near the ceiling
00:33:04,00:33:08,and that the middle air of a room was the healthy air you had to breathe.
00:33:08,00:33:09,"- Technically, isn't that true?"
00:33:09,00:33:11,"Because oxygen is flowerable,"
00:33:11,00:33:13,so we need a top and calm dioxide is.
00:33:13,00:33:16,- It's the gas in the room just moves around too much
00:33:16,00:33:17,to use infection.
00:33:17,00:33:18,"- Yeah, I know."
00:33:18,00:33:18,- If it was a very still room.
00:33:18,00:33:20,- We're onto the right idea
00:33:20,00:33:23,and we're killing our babies by leaving them on the floor.
00:33:23,00:33:25,"It's very unusual putting babies in cradles,"
00:33:25,00:33:27,having them sleeping cradles and cots and stuff
00:33:27,00:33:27,in most parts of the world.
00:33:27,00:33:29,It's really weird that we do that.
00:33:29,00:33:30,- So.
00:33:30,00:33:31,"- Yeah, like vast majority of countries,"
00:33:31,00:33:33,I think it's pretty much unheard of and babies just sleep
00:33:33,00:33:34,with their parents.
00:33:34,00:33:37,- Parents used to not really worry about washing their babies too much either.
00:33:37,00:33:38,- Oh yeah.
00:33:38,00:33:41,- Mothers in medieval times would dry nappies rather than wash them
00:33:41,00:33:43,"and in the book I was reading about this,"
00:33:43,00:33:44,a history of childhood.
00:33:44,00:33:46,This was because of the healing powers of urine.
00:33:46,00:33:47,- Right.
00:33:47,00:33:50,"- And in bits of France,"
00:33:50,00:33:51,"people thought that if you washed a child's head,"
00:33:51,00:33:53,you would make it simple-minded.
00:33:53,00:33:57,"And if you cut its nails and hair before it was a year and a day old,"
00:33:57,00:34:00,it would be respectively mute and a thief.
00:34:00,00:34:02,- Being mute is good if you're a thief because you make less noise.
00:34:02,00:34:04,- It's a really good point.
00:34:04,00:34:05,"- Okay, here's a thing."
00:34:05,00:34:08,That's what we might as well make sure it's safe as well.
00:34:08,00:34:09,- Please make sure it's safe.
00:34:09,00:34:10,"- Okay, cut its nails then."
00:34:10,00:34:12,(laughing)
00:34:12,00:34:14,"- Yeah, extraordinary."
00:34:14,00:34:17,- Can I just do one thing about an unusual job that I read today?
00:34:17,00:34:19,"Okay, so I was reading a book early on."
00:34:19,00:34:21,It's called Sex on Earth.
00:34:21,00:34:22,- Sex and Earth.
00:34:22,00:34:22,- What is that?
00:34:22,00:34:24,- I think it's a big phrase.
00:34:24,00:34:25,- Sorry.
00:34:25,00:34:28,- They were talking about the way that horses have sex
00:34:28,00:34:29,specifically in stud.
00:34:29,00:34:35,"So they have, a stallion will come in and have sex with a female horse."
00:34:35,00:34:37,And they were explaining how this happens.
00:34:37,00:34:41,And there is a guy who's one and only job is to hold the base
00:34:41,00:34:45,of the stallion's penis while it is in the mare's vagina.
00:34:45,00:34:50,And his job is to feel for the tell-tale throbbing of ejaculation
00:34:50,00:34:52,so that he knows when it's finished.
00:34:52,00:34:53,- Oh my goodness.
00:34:53,00:34:54,- Why does he need to know that?
00:34:54,00:34:57,- It's so they can stop the act.
00:34:57,00:35:00,- But surely it stops anyway in nature.
00:35:00,00:35:03,- That much of a hurry that we need to write the usual bits over.
00:35:03,00:35:04,- I was going to say it's a brilliant book.
00:35:04,00:35:06,It's by Jules Howard.
00:35:06,00:35:07,It's absolutely real.
00:35:07,00:35:09,"- But that's presumably why in nature,"
00:35:09,00:35:12,you see a lot of skeletons of horses which have just died
00:35:12,00:35:14,because they didn't know when to stop having sex.
00:35:14,00:35:21,- Imagine how the stallion feels during all that.
00:35:21,00:35:23,"In Paris, I presume."
00:35:23,00:35:24,- I don't know.
00:35:24,00:35:26,- I would if a horse turned up.
00:35:26,00:35:27,- That's it.
00:35:27,00:35:30,"- Hold it in the face, you can hear this in his face."
00:35:30,00:35:32,- Did you just say I'm a stallion in bed?
