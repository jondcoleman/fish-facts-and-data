00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,920
 *starts playing*

2
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:21,200
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

3
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,400
 to you from the QI offices in Covenant Garden.

4
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:29,320
 My name is Dan Schreiber and I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, Anna Chazinski and

5
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:34,000
 Alex Bell and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,400
 facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go.

7
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,480
 Starting with fact number one and that is Chazinski.

8
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,520
 Yep, my fact this week is that the inventor of the Venn diagram also invented a machine

9
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,800
 that automatically bowls cricket balls.

10
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:56,680
 Yeah, you can see how the two cross over because the Venn diagram is circular and while

11
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,920
 there are circles in it, right, and the cricket balls are circular I suppose.

12
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,920
 Yeah.

13
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,920
 So I think that's where you got the inspiration.

14
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,000
 So does that mean that you could draw a Venn diagram of cricket related inventions involving

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,560
 balls in one circle and Venn diagrams in another circle and then in the middle you've got

16
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,880
 this guy who invented both.

17
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:19,680
 So that's not a Venn diagram because you've just fallen into the biggest Venn diagram

18
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,800
 trap that the internet ever creates which is that really annoying thing where it has,

19
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:28,480
 as you've just said, this thing plus this thing equals John Venn, but that's not what a Venn

20
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,480
 diagram is.

21
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,480
 Is that a Eulith diagram?

22
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,480
 No, it's nothing.

23
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,720
 It's just a thing the internet makes up.

24
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,720
 Okay.

25
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,520
 Do I really have to explain Venn diagrams?

26
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,520
 Yes, please.

27
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:44,920
 So I guess as much as you've got two circles and one circle is a set.

28
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,800
 So a category and there's a bunch of stuff in that category.

29
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:51,720
 Let's say animals and then you've got another circle which is another set.

30
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,360
 Things called Barney.

31
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,360
 Yes.

32
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,360
 Exactly.

33
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,560
 And then you have this is difficult because I don't know if accounting Barney the dinosaur

34
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,360
 has an actual animal.

35
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:05,800
 I think we need a third Venn diagram circle which is fictional soft creatures.

36
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,800
 All fictional and real animals are ever created.

37
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,800
 There we go.

38
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,800
 Then you can get Barney in the middle.

39
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,360
 So the thing in the middle has to belong to those categories.

40
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,680
 So if you all think to work, John Venn would have to be a type of cricket ball or whatever

41
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,840
 and a type of Venn diagram, neither of which is.

42
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,920
 Okay, so what about inventors of things that are round to do with round things and inventors

43
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,960
 of things that do with cricket and he invented both because cricket balls are round and

44
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,960
 Venn diagrams are round.

45
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,040
 Oh no, but they're not just with cricket, are they?

46
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,040
 We've really got sidetracks.

47
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,000
 It's amazing that John Venn worked it out.

48
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 It's amazing.

49
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 Love it.

50
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 He didn't call them Venn diagrams.

51
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 No.

52
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 No.

53
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,600
 So they are a subcategory of Euler diagrams.

54
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,360
 Things where you're representing information in circles but they don't have to be linked.

55
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:51,600
 And then Venn diagrams are Eulerian circles but where there is an intersection between the

56
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,600
 two.

57
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,600
 They're Euler diagrams, aren't they?

58
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,600
 I don't know.

59
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,600
 I also his name was Euler.

60
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,600
 Yeah, you're probably right actually.

61
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,280
 But yeah, it is the thing that people confuse as well.

62
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,280
 I think the difference is that the Venn diagram, if you imagine the three intersecting things,

63
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,360
 it can include empty sections.

64
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:11,960
 So let's say you've got two circles and one of them is mammals and another one is birds

65
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,320
 and they're intersecting.

66
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,120
 You have to have that middle intersection even though there's no such things a bird that's

67
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,120
 also a mammal.

68
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,120
 Okay.

69
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,120
 Okay.

70
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,640
 So he is said to have invented this diagram in 1881.

71
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:27,960
 That is the date that's put on the first time that he came up with the concept.

72
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:32,360
 So I was looking into 1881 just to see what other scientific inventions happened that year

73
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,840
 and it was an amazing year.

74
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,840
 Really.

75
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,840
 A lot of things happened.

76
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,480
 So Charles Darwin published his final scientific book, which was called the formation

77
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,120
 of vegetable mold through the actions of worms.

78
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,120
 Yeah.

79
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,640
 It's not exactly under the Deadly Hallows, is it?

80
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:51,560
 The first modern cesarean section was performed in 1881.

81
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,560
 Was it?

82
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,560
 Yeah.

83
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:59,400
 Alexander Fleming was born in 1881 and then lastly, Carlos Finley, who was a Cuban doctor,

84
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,840
 was the first to propose that yellow fever was transmitted by mosquitoes rather than direct

85
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,840
 human contact.

86
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,840
 Oh.

87
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,840
 That's a huge moment.

88
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,840
 Yeah.

89
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,840
 That resulted in a lot of lives saved.

90
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,840
 That's cool.

91
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,840
 Imagine being a journalist in that year.

92
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:15,760
 Yeah, a tiny baby who's been born in Hawaii and then penicillin.

93
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,720
 There are lots of really nice tributes to Venn, John Venn.

94
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,440
 So in the Cambridge College where he taught, there's a stained glass window which is a Venn

95
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,440
 diagram.

96
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:28,640
 He's got three circles of overlapping stained glass and in the middle is much darker.

97
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:32,120
 So it's kind of half double glazed and then half single glazed.

98
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,560
 And then a bit of it's triple glazed because there are three circles.

99
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,560
 Wow.

100
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,560
 That would must be really warm.

101
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,560
 Yeah.

102
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,560
 That's...

103
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,400
 So yeah, do you know what college he went to?

104
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,400
 Was it Gonville & Keese?

105
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,200
 Yeah, he went to Gonville & Keese and he did a couple of other things in his life.

106
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,880
 So first of all, I should explain.

107
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:51,800
 He did invent the odd thing and one of them was this automatic bowling machine for cricket

108
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,800
 balls.

109
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,380
 And the weird thing about this was that he invented it and the Australian cricket team

110
00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:00,880
 had come to visit Britain and they visited Cambridge where he was at the time and he whipped

111
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,880
 it out.

112
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,720
 He was asked to get out of his cricket bowling machine to entertain them and it automatically

113
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,080
 bowled out Australia's best batsman four times running.

114
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,080
 Wow.

115
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:12,120
 So that was the glory days of English cricket.

116
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,420
 But another thing he did, which I love, it's almost about the only other sort of thing that

117
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:21,480
 goes down in his biography, aside from with mathematical stuff, is that he, with his son,

118
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:26,560
 compiled a book that was a biographical list of all known students, graduates and holders

119
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,440
 of office ever to go to the University of Cambridge from the beginning of history up until...

120
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,680
 Well, he only got to 1751 before he died.

121
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:40,480
 So that was 136,000 biographies of people that he wrote.

122
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,280
 What a dull look.

123
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:47,440
 It's not how did he find out those little biographies of all of these people, it was incredible.

124
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,440
 School reports?

125
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,440
 Yeah, I guess so.

126
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,040
 They must have had some sort of records.

127
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,200
 I mean, if anyone's going to have records, it's going to be like a really old university

128
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,040
 that has had like a consistent way of doing things for years and years.

129
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,120
 I think they obviously had something otherwise it was just him and his son made it up.

130
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,120
 Why would you wreck it?

131
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,120
 Mike Smith did.

132
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:08,120
 Do you know something else that has a Venn diagram on it, "Intribute" is, if you live in

133
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:12,520
 Clapham in London, or you've ever been to Clapham, there's Venn Street, which you might

134
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,480
 know has got Venn Street records on it, which I really like.

135
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:20,680
 And that's named after, not John Venn, after his grandfather, who happened to be the reverent

136
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,520
 and erected in Clapham.

137
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:27,640
 And it does so the sign for Venn Street also has a Venn diagram on it, "Intribute to the

138
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:47,640
 Rectors grandson who invented the diagram."

139
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:56,680
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is my fact, my fact this week is that if

140
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:02,080
 you want to increase capacity on a cruise ship, you just simply have to cut it in half and

141
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,340
 add a whole new chunk of ship.

142
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,340
 That's done.

143
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,340
 It's so weird.

144
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,840
 I've seen an amazing video of it.

145
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,280
 What they do is they take these cruise ships and they dock them and they just literally

146
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,280
 slice down the middle.

147
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:18,000
 It's obviously a spot where the original design says, "If you ever need to cut this into two,

148
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 this is where it happens."

149
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,800
 Is it like a sort of scissors symbol in a docked life or around the ship?

150
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,440
 And so they cut it in half and they separate it.

151
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:30,680
 And then they just insert the chunk that they would like to go inside and push as if it's

152
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:36,800
 a meat to a ship sandwich, close it up, and then it's ready to go and it's fully functioning.

153
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,800
 It's extraordinary.

154
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,880
 The first problem I have with this is that all the rims in a hotel are cruise ship are

155
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,880
 numbered.

156
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:46,160
 So you're going to get room like 17, 18, 18B, 18C, is it because otherwise you're not going

157
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,160
 to make any sense.

158
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,720
 I bet they just renumber the rooms.

159
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,760
 Yeah, you can just take the numbers off, can't you?

160
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,760
 Probably.

161
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,760
 I'm sure they make removable numbers.

162
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,360
 You do have to unscrew them, but they've got people to do that.

163
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,160
 In many ways, this is the smallest part of the operate.

164
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:04,800
 Yes, but they rename the ship usually when they change it as well.

165
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,800
 Queen Mary.

166
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:14,320
 You've got to come up with sort of your fits.

167
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:18,520
 So yeah, I mean, this was done with a ship, which was called the Silver Spirit.

168
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,520
 That's one example.

169
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,120
 And they extended it when it cut it in half.

170
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,120
 They put in a 49 feet chunk into the middle of it.

171
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,640
 And the subject of cruise ships and slicing massive sections out of things, Disney owned

172
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,680
 a lot of cruise liners.

173
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,480
 And they also have an island in the Bahamas.

174
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,960
 They bought it and it's one of their destinations to their cruise ships.

175
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:38,960
 But it's sort of, you know, like a very shallow sandy island with a lot of shallow kind of

176
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,960
 beach around it.

177
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:43,120
 So it's too, you can't get the cruise ship anywhere near to it.

178
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,720
 It's not like a sort of a steep kind of, you know, cliff into the sea.

179
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,760
 So what they did was they basically cut out an underwater parking space for their cruise

180
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,760
 ships.

181
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:54,240
 They just dug a massive trench that goes up towards the island, so the cruise ship

182
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,640
 can just sort of reverse into it and go right through the island.

183
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,720
 And so if you look at it on Google Earth, there's just a kind of a rectangular, dark patch

184
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,720
 of ocean right next to it.

185
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,720
 It's amazing.

186
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,720
 It's so cool.

187
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,720
 I'll post a picture on my Twitter feed.

188
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,800
 I found a cruise ship for Dan.

189
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,800
 Wow.

190
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,720
 Because we've been thinking of sending you away for a while.

191
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,720
 Thank you.

192
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:16,640
 So if you guys heard of conspiracy cruises, Dan's nodding, but he's not allowed to talk about

193
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,640
 it.

194
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,640
 Never heard of it.

195
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,160
 These are, I can't believe this exists.

196
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,400
 Go to their website.

197
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:30,960
 It promises to deliver to anyone who's interested the truth about all these things.

198
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,640
 And it lists the truths that it'll deliver.

199
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:37,720
 So it's the truth about global warming, fracking, HIV, vaccinations, then it gets weird

200
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,720
 and weirder.

201
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,680
 So fluoridation for bid and archaeology, JFK, September 11th.

202
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,680
 Yeah.

203
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,880
 You're welcome onto the ship by Captain Elvis Presley.

204
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,000
 What is they telling the truth about Star Wars agenda?

205
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 Do you know what that is?

206
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,480
 That's to do with the, not the movies.

207
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,640
 It was a present bush.

208
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,080
 I think he was talking about it a lot.

209
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,920
 The idea of having satellites that were able to shoot down through the atmosphere.

210
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,440
 Presently militarizing space.

211
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,440
 Yes, exactly.

212
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,440
 Got it.

213
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,440
 OK.

214
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,440
 Oh god.

215
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:13,320
 Imagine booking for the real truth about who Luke's father really was.

216
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,720
 Dressed to see true fear.

217
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,960
 I think that person would get along perfectly well with everyone else.

218
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:21,640
 The good news is that you don't have to have any vaccinations before you go on one of these

219
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,640
 crickets.

220
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:27,880
 It sounds so weird.

221
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,880
 Where does it go?

222
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,880
 So it goes all over the place.

223
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,880
 They go to various places.

224
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,880
 For me to try and go.

225
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,880
 So one place it doesn't go?

226
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,640
 They're not crazy.

227
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,720
 It costs $3,000.

228
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,720
 These people don't have this money.

229
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:45,240
 A popular mechanics journalist went on it because he said he read about it and thought

230
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,840
 it would be really fun and thought, you know, you could go with some other

231
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,920
 kind of jokers and discuss stuff and said it was terrifying.

232
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:54,360
 So everyone's really serious there has taken it very seriously.

233
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,880
 He ended up being chased out of various conference rooms.

234
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,200
 So I think they suspected him of something going to flee down corridors from people chasing

235
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,400
 him and shutting himself in his room.

236
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:07,440
 You know, as well as conspiracy cruises, they have 80s music cruises.

237
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,440
 Oh, yeah.

238
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:13,520
 So they have whole cruises where just musical stars from the 80s perform.

239
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:18,560
 So there was a great write-up of one which mostly focused on Tony Hadley of Spandau Ballet.

240
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,360
 And he said, I saw an advert in the paper last year for music cruises.

241
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,360
 I couldn't believe it.

242
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:26,640
 There was Huey Lewis in the news, Pat Beneter, Crosby Stills in Nash and Alfibo.

243
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,320
 I phoned my manager and asked, why am I not singing at sea?

244
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:33,320
 He said, don't worry, Tony, I'm already on it.

245
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,720
 This does happen a lot now, not just for 80s stars.

246
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:39,840
 So the band Weezer have Weezer crews and they invite a lot of bands on.

247
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:44,160
 There's a comedy cruise as well. It was just a bunch of comedians would go off on this cruise

248
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,160
 and they were the entertainment.

249
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,160
 That sounds like hell on earth.

250
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,160
 Yeah, it really does.

251
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,280
 I throw myself in.

252
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:53,320
 Actually, speaking of comedians, there's a really good story about a cruise ship comedian

253
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,320
 from 1991.

254
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,200
 Have you guys heard of MTS Oceanus, which sank in '91?

255
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,200
 No.

256
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,200
 No.

257
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,720
 So this was a huge cruise ship.

258
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:06,880
 It sank and the captain and his crew were the first people off the ship when it sank

259
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,880
 straight away.

260
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:08,880
 Bad form.

261
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,240
 They didn't even make an announcement over the Tanoi, say.

262
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,240
 Oh, really?

263
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,240
 That's a real faux pas.

264
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,240
 Yeah.

265
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,440
 So they basically, the passengers heard this explosion on the ship.

266
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,760
 Nothing happened for ages.

267
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,920
 So they went to check where the captain was supposed to be and he was gone.

268
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,680
 He left the ship unmanned and all his crew had gone.

269
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:30,080
 And the only person left to save them was the ship entertainer called Moss Hills.

270
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,240
 And he's saved everyone on the ship.

271
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:34,920
 This is a great story where he rescued for 571 people.

272
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:39,480
 So first of all, he worked out how to use the ship's radio to phone a Mayday thing to say

273
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,480
 we're in trouble.

274
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,480
 You're comedian.

275
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,480
 He's got microphone experience.

276
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,480
 Is this thing on?

277
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:49,960
 You have been on a cruise and there's a massive explosion.

278
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,960
 Maybe it was.

279
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,960
 He just performed some comedy.

280
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:56,200
 And the people at the other end thought, God, we better save those poor passengers.

281
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:00,080
 But yeah, these helicopters came and lifeboats were used to rescue them.

282
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,960
 And he rounded everyone up and got them onto the lifeboats and organised it.

283
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:06,760
 And he and his wife and his fellow deputy entertainer were the last people off the ship.

284
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,760
 Do you know what happened?

285
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,760
 So I was looking up ship launching ceremonies.

286
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,760
 Oh yeah.

287
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,680
 And these things happen with cruise ships as well.

288
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:16,680
 The first water to touch the ship is caught, sealed in a bottle and then displayed in

289
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,680
 the captain's office.

290
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,680
 How?

291
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,680
 Do you catch?

292
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,680
 I don't know.

293
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,680
 What a great point.

294
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,480
 What if you try to collect the water and there's a fish in it?

295
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,280
 Do you think you'd tip the fish out or do you then, because that would be quite a good

296
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,280
 outcome, wouldn't it?

297
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,040
 Because at least you don't have this tedious bottle of water in your captain's office.

298
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,160
 The dead fish.

299
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,160
 Lovely little memento.

300
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,160
 The environmental damage.

301
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,960
 Your massive cruise ship does the ocean.

302
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,960
 Okay, fine.

303
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,960
 I'm looking on the bright side, are we?

304
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,960
 Just, you mentioned ceremonies.

305
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,960
 Yeah.

306
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,960
 I didn't know about the line crossing ceremony.

307
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,320
 Do you guys know about this?

308
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,320
 No.

309
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,320
 This happens on all ships.

310
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:51,720
 So when you turn a really inappropriate joke on a cruise ship and then we're like, no, mate.

311
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,000
 No, this is the line crossing ceremony is not that.

312
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,800
 It is when you cross the equator.

313
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,800
 But this is the thing that happens.

314
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,120
 A lot of cruise ships are due to this ceremony.

315
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,720
 And in the Navy they do this ceremony.

316
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,840
 And in also like in merchant, maybe they do this ceremony.

317
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:06,480
 And it's been happening since at least the early 1800s.

318
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,480
 And Darwin had it done to him, for instance.

319
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,200
 So on the beagle, it's really funny to read his diary from there, because he really looked

320
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,200
 down on it.

321
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:17,000
 And it was like, come on, I'm a bloody scientist, I'm not down for all this kind of banter.

322
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,480
 It was an initiation thing where he had to do lots of, as he described it, extremely

323
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,240
 disagreeable and unpleasant things.

324
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,880
 So there was a lot of simulating sex acts in the olden days and stuff, I think.

325
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:26,880
 Really?

326
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,880
 Yeah.

327
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,240
 And what you were told to do is, well, first of all, you get kind of, well, what happened

328
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,000
 to Darwin is he got buttoned down in the hatchways in the dark until he was super hot.

329
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,120
 And then you get dragged up by the crew.

330
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,200
 And you have to go to the court of Neptune.

331
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,840
 So it's basically, you have to go to Neptune and be accused of your crime and you're known

332
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:48,040
 as a polywag, until you've passed the equator successfully.

333
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,560
 And then you become, you know, a seasoned traveler.

334
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,520
 And yeah, so Darwin was trapped down and then dragged up onto the deck.

335
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,800
 And then he had buckets of water thrown over him.

336
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,800
 He was blindfolded.

337
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:02,200
 He was made a stand on a plank above this huge bath of water and then they tipped him in.

338
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,280
 And what, and he thought it was the actual sea because he was blindfolded.

339
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,280
 Oh, probably, yeah.

340
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,280
 I'm not talking about that.

341
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,280
 That's a funny trick to play.

342
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,280
 That is funny.

343
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,280
 Yeah.

344
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:14,400
 And on walking the plank, there's an Norwegian cruise ship, which has a walk the plank

345
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,400
 experience.

346
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,400
 Oh.

347
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,640
 They make you walk the plank.

348
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:21,760
 Well, I think you volunteered to walk your foot along a net and it's an eight-foot-long

349
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,080
 plank, but you do it wearing a safety harness.

350
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,080
 Oh, okay.

351
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,080
 Yeah.

352
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:33,080
 And then you go to the side of the ship and you drop.

353
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:40,320
 Okay, it's time for fact number three and that is Alex.

354
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:45,160
 My fact this week is that Steven Magan, Michael Parkinson, Aiman Holmes and Sheree Blair

355
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,600
 have all been dropped from the TV program.

356
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,800
 Who do you think you are?

357
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,400
 Because their ancestry is too boring.

358
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,960
 Are they, were they dropped mid-program?

359
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,960
 They were dropped.

360
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,960
 Yeah, pretty much.

361
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,520
 They signed up to do it because the program approached you and say, "Would you like to do

362
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,520
 the program?"

363
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,520
 And you sign up and say, "Yes."

364
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,520
 And agree to do all of the things.

365
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,800
 And then they start researching.

366
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,200
 And then at some point, they went back to these people being like, "Achee, you know what?

367
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,680
 Let's leave it."

368
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,680
 Because it's going to be rubbish.

369
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:12,440
 The good news is that their full story has made a new series called, "Who cares?"

370
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:17,440
 It was very funny because it sounds like they have to be quite diplomatic when they

371
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,440
 tell them.

372
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:23,040
 So with Sheree Blair, one of the producers said, "We spent hours locked in rooms with

373
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,920
 Sheree's publicist secretary manager, personal assistant."

374
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:30,640
 Eventually, we had to say, "You are very interesting, but we don't have a show."

375
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:38,200
 But it's amazing because Sheree Blair is a booth and she is a descendant of John Wilk's

376
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,720
 booth as in it's her...

377
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,720
 John Wilk's booth?

378
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,120
 Yeah, who killed Abraham Lincoln.

379
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,120
 Wow.

380
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,440
 Yeah, so it's not a direct descendant.

381
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:48,760
 It's John Wilk Booth's uncle was Sheree Blair's direct ancestor.

382
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,680
 And surely there was enough in there alone.

383
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,680
 He was really disappointed, wasn't he?

384
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,680
 It is kind of sad.

385
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,680
 All these people were, in fact.

386
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,680
 I think she was disappointed.

387
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,480
 I think Michael Parkinson might have said he was really sad as well.

388
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,480
 He said he was gutted.

389
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,400
 He said it's the one show that he would have been happy to have.

390
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,400
 The one show?

391
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:09,440
 No, it was the only show that of all the celebrity-based programs that he actively wanted to take

392
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,440
 part in.

393
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,440
 Not even Parkinson.

394
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,440
 He didn't even draw that.

395
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,440
 Jesus.

396
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:16,800
 Stephen Mangan's is really funny because they found out that all of his ancestors were

397
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,400
 from the same place in Ireland and the same very small place in Ireland.

398
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,420
 He's mother and father grew up in adjacent villages on the west coast of Ireland, but they

399
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:28,440
 never met until they both happened to come to London and then meet each other there.

400
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:32,480
 I think that's so interesting that your whole family can be from one tiny spot.

401
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,480
 Yeah.

402
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,480
 Yeah.

403
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:39,200
 I would love to see a program done on Japan's emperor, you know, the imperial family in

404
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:46,080
 Japan, because they have a family tree that's traced back so far that it goes into mythological

405
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,080
 characters.

406
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:52,560
 At that point, I would say you've lost the trace, yeah, but they believe it in Japan.

407
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:56,960
 So it's a part of the official family tree and it goes into effectively, you know, people

408
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,960
 who were up on clouds and-

409
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,960
 But where's the crossover point?

410
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,560
 That must be across the point.

411
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,800
 Yeah, we know where it is.

412
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,800
 Where it is.

413
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,800
 Person, person, god.

414
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,800
 Yeah.

415
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:13,240
 660 to 585 BC was the life of Jimu who was an emperor and it's from there and his wife

416
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:19,080
 Isu Kiori, they both have family trees that disappear off into mythology with amazing

417
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,680
 cloud-flying emperors.

418
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:25,640
 I like the fact that you say it traces back so far that it goes into mythology as if you

419
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:29,560
 actually think that if you go back far enough in history, you will come to mythological

420
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,880
 creatures.

421
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:35,280
 It'd be great to be the kids of the like, well, my father is a thunder throwing god

422
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,280
 and my mother is from Suffolk.

423
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,400
 And how do they meet?

424
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:45,120
 And there's also the Guinness Book of World Records actually acknowledges the longest lineage

425
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,040
 of a family tree that is traceable.

426
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,040
 Oh, yeah.

427
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:53,240
 Yeah, it's called the Lurie lineage that's the Lurie family.

428
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:57,680
 And it includes people like Sigmund Freud and Martin Boober, I don't know who that is.

429
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:01,400
 St. Freud, one of the most famous bands in history, and Martin Boober.

430
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,560
 Every son just wants to suckle on his mother's boobs.

431
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:08,840
 Oh, my god, this is crazy.

432
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:14,440
 The Lurie lineage traces back to Jaheel Lurie a 13th century rabbi in breast.

433
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,440
 In breastlet?

434
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,440
 In breastlet?

435
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,440
 Wow.

436
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,440
 Freud is just steeped in.

437
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,440
 And with boobies.

438
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,440
 Yeah.

439
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:24,560
 Well, though, of course, when you trace stuff back far enough, as we said before, then you

440
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:29,040
 know, you all unite around the same person, like we're all related to Martin Boober.

441
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,520
 Are we all boobers at the end of the day?

442
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,280
 There is, there was a lot of this mythology stuff in the past, wasn't there?

443
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:39,320
 And there was a theory that the British royals were descended from Brutus.

444
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,320
 Was there?

445
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,120
 Yeah, but Brutus ended all day to back to the fall of Troy.

446
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,120
 Okay.

447
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,120
 That was the thing.

448
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,520
 There was a Brutus who, the Roman Brutus was descended, and not the Caesar Brutus,

449
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:52,840
 there was an earlier, more mythological Brutus, was descended from the people who left

450
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:57,760
 Troy, the Trojans, when they left after the fall of the city, and that, through Brutus,

451
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:02,080
 that's how it descended to the English monarchs in the 15th and 16th centuries.

452
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,320
 Yeah, that was the myth.

453
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:09,360
 Well, Shari Blair is related to Brutus, Junius Brutus Booth, the father of John Wilkes Booth,

454
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,080
 who was named after Brutus, yeah, from the play.

455
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,080
 How many?

456
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:18,440
 And he was a very famous actor, and what's very interesting about him is that he also attempted

457
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,960
 to assassinate a president.

458
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,280
 A Trojans assassinated president?

459
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,600
 Well, he sent a letter to President Andrew Jackson.

460
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:30,680
 He demanded that he pardon two pirates, and he, and he, there was a threat of assassination

461
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:33,120
 if he didn't, and he got caught for it.

462
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,120
 Yeah, isn't that weird?

463
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,440
 His dad was a dancer, yeah.

464
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,440
 Wow.

465
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:39,760
 Well, like father, like son, you know, you know what you grow up with, you're often influenced

466
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,560
 by it, aren't you?

467
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,160
 Just on Shari Blair's family, Tony Booth was her dad.

468
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,160
 Yeah.

469
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,560
 Not a difficult one to trace back, obviously, but he was a famous actor.

470
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,960
 Well, you have the discovery, Steve.

471
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,400
 You can't believe he didn't find out the Tony Booth thing, guys, that's right there.

472
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,400
 He was an actor.

473
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,400
 He was famous.

474
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,400
 He was an intellect.

475
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,240
 It was part, and there is other things.

476
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,760
 He clearly had bit parts in EastEnders and Emadale, and he played the same character in both,

477
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,960
 which is a tramp who acts as a spiritual guide to one of the characters.

478
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,960
 Cool.

479
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,960
 Presumably the people who made, which was Emadale in EastEnders.

480
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,960
 Yeah.

481
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:15,520
 Presumably the people who made, say, EastEnders sought the tramp, giving spiritual advice to

482
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,800
 one of the characters in Emadale and thought, we've got to get this tramp.

483
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,800
 Yeah.

484
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:23,200
 But do you know what other films he did, Tony Booth, which I didn't know?

485
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,200
 No.

486
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,200
 And it's just such a weird idea.

487
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,200
 It's saucy films, isn't it?

488
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,200
 It's such saucy films.

489
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:32,200
 We did the Confessions of Series, which was in the '70s, and it was like Confessions

490
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:37,120
 of a Window Cleaner, which embarrassingly was the top grossing British film of 1974.

491
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,120
 Yes.

492
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,440
 And it's sort of comedy sex films.

493
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,600
 Yeah, a lot of boobers in there.

494
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,600
 A lot of boobers.

495
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,600
 A lot of boobers.

496
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,600
 Yeah.

497
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,600
 He was in all of these Confessions of a Driving Instructor, and the plot is, as you would

498
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,920
 predict, a window cleaner goes around shagging lots of housewives.

499
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,920
 That's true.

500
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,920
 That's true.

501
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,920
 And that would be three things and stuff.

502
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,240
 But he's on the other side of the window.

503
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,240
 That's the tragedy of the window cleaner, isn't it?

504
00:21:55,240 --> 00:22:00,240
 Yeah, but he can drill a hole because they have, um, drills, famously window cleaners.

505
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,240
 Yeah.

506
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,240
 You're welcome with those.

507
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,240
 Just clean, or shall I do the drilling service, too.

508
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,240
 Yeah, I could do with some air.

509
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:14,240
 The last mechanism is broken, so yeah, drill through it, thanks.

510
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:22,480
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is Andy.

511
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:28,200
 My fact is that Wombats can kill predators by crushing them with their bottoms.

512
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,200
 So it does require quite a lot of setup.

513
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,200
 This, um, prank.

514
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,600
 I'm going to call it, prank?

515
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,600
 Defense mechanism.

516
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,600
 Yeah.

517
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,600
 I wouldn't say prank.

518
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,600
 OK, fair enough.

519
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,880
 So there's an essay in the London Review of Books, a baritacle, Catherine Rundle, which

520
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:43,560
 is all about Wombats, and it's full of very interesting facts about them.

521
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,440
 So Wombats have burrows.

522
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,760
 They dig lots of burrows, actually.

523
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,320
 And they have very, very hard bottoms.

524
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:54,400
 So we've mentioned before that sometimes they will plug the ground with their bumps when

525
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,400
 their predators are out.

526
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,400
 And the predators won't be able to...

527
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,400
 Like a door.

528
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,840
 Yeah, like a carpet pass, yeah.

529
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:05,320
 And so it turns out also that the scientists have found shattered fox skulls inside Wombat

530
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,320
 burrows.

531
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:11,600
 So if a fox follows a Wombat into its burrow, the Wombat will crush the fox's head against

532
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,680
 the wall of its own burrow and kill it.

533
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,680
 Oh, yeah.

534
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,680
 It's very, very hard.

535
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,680
 Very hard to go.

536
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,680
 Yeah.

537
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:20,160
 Well, the roof, yeah, and apparently with dingos, they'll just slam them up against

538
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,160
 the roof.

539
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,160
 Incredible, pranks.

540
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,160
 I'd like to...

541
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:28,160
 Harry Hill do the voiceovers, and you've been crushed.

542
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:31,560
 They're so good with their bumps, though, because they can...

543
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:35,200
 Like, it's classic QI factors that they Wombats have cubic feces.

544
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,200
 And then I didn't even know this.

545
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,200
 They stack that.

546
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,200
 They stack their poo.

547
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,240
 And it's supposed to be scientists think it might be some sort of like, status symbol

548
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:44,440
 to sort of put your poo in a high tower, which you can't do, because they're square.

549
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,440
 Because they're square, yeah.

550
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:49,120
 So they do up to 80 to 100 a day, or per night, rather.

551
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,120
 And they...

552
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,680
 They're for display purposes, effectively.

553
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:56,160
 So they don't want them rolling off rocks when they put them up on a rock for it to be seen.

554
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,160
 Well, it's...

555
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,160
 Yeah, it's to mark territory, isn't it?

556
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,160
 Yeah.

557
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,160
 To attract people.

558
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:03,280
 But it's a bit rough on the baby Wombats, because Wombats, obviously, are my soupies.

559
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:07,680
 And as we've said in a previous podcast, the baby's face backwards in the pouch.

560
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,880
 And so what this means is, they're always pooing.

561
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:15,140
 And the baby Wombats face is usually poking out of its thing, the pouch just below its

562
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,140
 ass.

563
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:18,140
 And it's just shoved in this pool all the time.

564
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:19,140
 Yeah.

565
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:20,140
 That's not true.

566
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,140
 That's not true.

567
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,140
 There's that baby you've got shit in your face.

568
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:23,140
 AC to 100 times a day.

569
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,140
 The head is just poking out, isn't it?

570
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:25,140
 Yeah.

571
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,140
 Behind the back of the mother.

572
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:27,140
 Yeah.

573
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:32,220
 But the weird thing is that they don't have cubic anuses that have square anuses to produce

574
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,220
 the cubic poo.

575
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:34,220
 There's a mystery.

576
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:36,700
 It's not really a mystery, because we know how they make it.

577
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:37,700
 Oh, we do know how they make it.

578
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:38,700
 We do know how they make it.

579
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:39,700
 So it's in the...

580
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:42,700
 It takes them 14 to 18 days to digest food.

581
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,100
 It's very, very long.

582
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:48,100
 So by the time it gets out of them, it's really compact.

583
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,220
 And it's had all the nutrition taken out of it.

584
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:52,140
 You know, it's very efficiently done.

585
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:57,220
 And they have ridges in the first bit of their intestine, which shapes the food as it's

586
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:59,460
 being digested into these cubic shapes.

587
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:04,700
 And then they have also have special bones in the bottoms to keep the poo in the cubic shape.

588
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,700
 Wow.

589
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,700
 Yeah.

590
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:07,700
 It's like an inbuilt cookie cutter.

591
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:08,700
 It is.

592
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:09,700
 It's holding the...

593
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:10,700
 It genuinely is.

594
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,700
 In December, they do Christmas trees as well.

595
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:17,380
 It would be great if they could vary it like a balloon magician.

596
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:18,380
 What should we do?

597
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:20,900
 Not come into your children's parties.

598
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:24,380
 Well, she's booked the one bag again.

599
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:26,660
 Well, I like about one bag says.

600
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:31,180
 You can see pictures of them where when the young one bag that's in the pouch is almost

601
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:34,820
 mature enough to leave, it's probably poking its head out and it grazes, so it'll be eating

602
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:36,700
 grass out of the back.

603
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,340
 And the mother will eat grass out of the front.

604
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:41,940
 And it just looks like it's a two-headed ball bag.

605
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:42,940
 That's incredible.

606
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:43,940
 Wow.

607
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:44,940
 Amazing.

608
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:46,940
 You must have seen them, Dan, because you...

609
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:47,940
 You're Australian.

610
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:48,940
 Yeah.

611
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:49,940
 I've seen them in captivity.

612
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:50,940
 They're so beautiful.

613
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:51,940
 They're my favourite animal, I have to say.

614
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:53,340
 I saw one for the first time this year.

615
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:54,340
 Yeah, really.

616
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:55,340
 Amazing.

617
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,340
 Oh, when we went to Oz, yeah, it's the course.

618
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:57,340
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

619
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:59,940
 And Australian zoos, apparently, they have the second highest danger rating.

620
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:02,180
 So the only things that beat them are lions and bears.

621
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:05,580
 And then as a zookeeper, the next thing you've got to be terrified of is the one bag.

622
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:06,580
 When we talk.

623
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:08,180
 For a large guinea pig, it's quite weird.

624
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,180
 Yeah.

625
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:10,180
 And they run so fast as well.

626
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,180
 Yeah.

627
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:13,180
 They can run as fast as you say in bolt.

628
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:14,180
 I mean, faster, faster.

629
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,180
 For longer.

630
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:16,180
 Yeah.

631
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:19,260
 They can run at 25 miles an hour, and his top speed is about 27.

632
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,260
 Yeah.

633
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:26,820
 But your same bolt can run at 27 miles an hour, give or take, for about what, nine seconds.

634
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:29,980
 One bats can run at 25 miles an hour for 90 seconds.

635
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:31,980
 So if they were trying to catch him, they would.

636
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:36,580
 We don't know whether or not you same bolt could keep that up for longer.

637
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:37,580
 That's just what he...

638
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:38,580
 That's where he has to stop.

639
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,900
 No one's ever put him on a longer track.

640
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:43,060
 He's done a 200 metre, but that's a different discipline.

641
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,740
 He's running a different pace there.

642
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:45,740
 That's a good point.

643
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:46,740
 If he reaches a...

644
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:49,780
 If we just said, just keep going when you get to the end.

645
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:53,380
 Are you saying you think he could run at that speed for a kilometre?

646
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:56,380
 Well, a minute and a half would be, because that's what a one-back can do.

647
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,380
 Yeah.

648
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:59,580
 I'd be curious to know what his deceleration was.

649
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:00,580
 Would you...

650
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:03,020
 What you think he might just be choosing to run 200 metres a bit slower?

651
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:05,500
 Because never mind, often, anyway.

652
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:11,740
 I was hoping that we'd glossed over my theory, but no, thank you for bringing that back up.

653
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:12,740
 Yeah.

654
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:17,020
 I was looking up other animals that use their arses in interesting ways.

655
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:18,020
 Cool.

656
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:21,340
 There's a type of caterpillar called the Skipper Caterpillar, which does the thing called

657
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:23,140
 "scat firing".

658
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:28,700
 So it's able to launch its poo out of its back end, kind of a high speed.

659
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,700
 It was...

660
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:33,740
 I think it's trying to think it was genetically evolved as a way of just getting or

661
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:35,700
 put away from you, just seeing if I hide you in reasons.

662
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:36,700
 Yeah.

663
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:39,500
 But it's also pretty good for shooting like wasps that come to an issue.

664
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,500
 Wow.

665
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,500
 Isn't that great?

666
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,500
 Yeah.

667
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,780
 It's like a paintball gun or something.

668
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:47,020
 Like a clay pigeon shooting, kind of thing.

669
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:48,020
 Yeah.

670
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:49,020
 Wow, imagine.

671
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:50,020
 Who wasps shooting?

672
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:55,340
 We had evolved to be able to shoot pigeons with poo as they approached us.

673
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,340
 Yeah.

674
00:27:56,340 --> 00:28:00,660
 I think clothing would have evolved differently to allow you easy access to a weapon.

675
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:01,660
 Yeah.

676
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:02,660
 Yeah.

677
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:03,660
 But it's amazing how it works.

678
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:08,060
 So poo comes out in pellets and so they come out and then they get sort of stored inside

679
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:13,740
 a special launch pad, an anal kind of launch pad, and then it pumps up the blood pressure.

680
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:19,460
 Like, you know, when like in a computer game, like, yeah, and then, and then kind of like launches

681
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:20,460
 it like a catapult.

682
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:21,460
 Wow.

683
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:22,460
 Oh, what?

684
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:24,460
 So they poo inside themselves and then...

685
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,460
 Yeah, pretty much.

686
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:26,460
 ...store it up for the launch.

687
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:29,300
 ...into the, like, the, what's it called, like, into the chamber?

688
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,300
 Yeah.

689
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,300
 So you've got a false bottom.

690
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,300
 Or you've got a second bottom.

691
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,300
 Exactly.

692
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:34,300
 A second bottom inside your first bottom.

693
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,300
 Yeah.

694
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,300
 Because the first...

695
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,300
 They're all magicians.

696
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,300
 Wow.

697
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,300
 That's extraordinary.

698
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,300
 That's incredible.

699
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,300
 That's really amazing.

700
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,300
 So there was a...

701
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,300
 I'd rather like this.

702
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:46,860
 So there used to be a giant wombat, which were weighed three tons.

703
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:51,780
 It was about the size of a rhino and it lived until really recently.

704
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:56,420
 So we think it only died out around the time that humans first reached Australasia.

705
00:28:56,420 --> 00:29:00,380
 So there's a big question about who killed the giant wombat and whether it was us, basically.

706
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:01,380
 Okay.

707
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,380
 Sounds like it was us.

708
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,380
 Yeah.

709
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:05,140
 It does sound like it was us, but maybe it was environmental.

710
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:07,940
 Maybe it was, you know, climate factors or something like it was probably us.

711
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:10,380
 It was probably us who killed all the giant wombat's.

712
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:14,300
 But they were alive until about 50,000 years ago.

713
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:16,540
 So it's really recent that we had these things.

714
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:17,540
 As big as rhinos.

715
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:18,540
 As big as rhinos.

716
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:19,540
 Imagine that.

717
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:20,540
 That's crazy.

718
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:23,740
 And their hindquarters were very developed for their size.

719
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,740
 So they had, like, like, super anuses.

720
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:26,740
 Oh, man.

721
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:29,980
 You could build a pyramid out of the squares coming out of that.

722
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:30,980
 Wow.

723
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:31,980
 Yeah.

724
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:36,860
 So they were saying, what if a marsupial had evolved into a horse-like creature?

725
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:37,860
 How would that have affected?

726
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:42,620
 It was just a discussion for them saying, wouldn't it have been cool if we could have domesticated

727
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:46,300
 the giant wombat and used that in equestrian ways?

728
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,300
 Yes.

729
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,300
 So they are very hard to domesticate.

730
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,300
 And also if you're wrong.

731
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:51,300
 That might be extinct by 50,000 years.

732
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:56,940
 So Iraq and we be overrun with them and living underground and it would be a nine now.

733
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:00,180
 Riding them presumably you'd have to face backwards because of the pouch thing, which I think

734
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:01,180
 would be quite difficult.

735
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:02,700
 You're proposing that you get into the pouch.

736
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:03,700
 I see.

737
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:04,700
 That's how you'd ride it, right?

738
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:05,700
 You get on it.

739
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:06,700
 You get on top of it.

740
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:07,700
 Do you think?

741
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:08,700
 Yeah.

742
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:09,700
 What if it had a baby jumping in the pouch?

743
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:10,700
 Yeah.

744
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:11,700
 That's a good point.

745
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,900
 Also, we've established you'd just be having that shit all over your face all the time.

746
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:14,900
 It's not ideal.

747
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:15,900
 Yeah.

748
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:20,380
 Is there an animal living currently that has a pouch big enough that a human could sit inside

749
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:21,380
 it of living, though?

750
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:22,380
 Yeah.

751
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:24,340
 I mean, the kangaroos probably got the biggest pouch.

752
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,340
 Yeah.

753
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:26,340
 Even quite large kangaroos.

754
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:27,940
 You can't fit a baby in there.

755
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:29,940
 You can fit a baby into a kangaroo's pouch.

756
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:30,940
 Yeah.

757
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:32,740
 They're gross and disgusting and you wouldn't want to do it.

758
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:34,980
 We're talking about just, you know, theoretical theoretical.

759
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:35,980
 You have a baby.

760
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:36,980
 I have a baby.

761
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:37,980
 That's all right.

762
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:40,020
 You could definitely fit a human baby into a kangaroo's pouch.

763
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,020
 I don't think so.

764
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:45,980
 The largest kangaroos that go into pouches are definitely the size of human babies.

765
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:46,980
 Actually, you're right.

766
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:47,980
 Babies are small, aren't they?

767
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:48,980
 No, you're right.

768
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:49,980
 Joey's can be massive.

769
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:50,980
 Yeah.

770
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:51,980
 Joey's can be massive.

771
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:52,980
 They stay in their for ages.

772
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:53,980
 You're right.

773
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:54,980
 Either way, I'm calling social services before you get a chance to try it out.

774
00:30:54,980 --> 00:31:01,980
 Okay.

775
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:02,980
 That's it.

776
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:03,980
 That is all of our facts.

777
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:04,980

797
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:46,020
 It's an awesome place.

798
