00:00:00,00:00:15,*starts playing*
00:00:15,00:00:21,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming"
00:00:21,00:00:24,to you from the QI offices in Covenant Garden.
00:00:24,00:00:29,"My name is Dan Schreiber and I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, Anna Chazinski and"
00:00:29,00:00:34,Alex Bell and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite
00:00:34,00:00:39,facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go.
00:00:39,00:00:42,Starting with fact number one and that is Chazinski.
00:00:42,00:00:47,"Yep, my fact this week is that the inventor of the Venn diagram also invented a machine"
00:00:47,00:00:49,that automatically bowls cricket balls.
00:00:49,00:00:56,"Yeah, you can see how the two cross over because the Venn diagram is circular and while"
00:00:56,00:00:59,"there are circles in it, right, and the cricket balls are circular I suppose."
00:00:59,00:01:00,Yeah.
00:01:00,00:01:01,So I think that's where you got the inspiration.
00:01:01,00:01:07,So does that mean that you could draw a Venn diagram of cricket related inventions involving
00:01:07,00:01:12,balls in one circle and Venn diagrams in another circle and then in the middle you've got
00:01:12,00:01:13,this guy who invented both.
00:01:13,00:01:19,So that's not a Venn diagram because you've just fallen into the biggest Venn diagram
00:01:19,00:01:23,"trap that the internet ever creates which is that really annoying thing where it has,"
00:01:23,00:01:28,"as you've just said, this thing plus this thing equals John Venn, but that's not what a Venn"
00:01:28,00:01:29,diagram is.
00:01:29,00:01:30,Is that a Eulith diagram?
00:01:30,00:01:31,"No, it's nothing."
00:01:31,00:01:33,It's just a thing the internet makes up.
00:01:33,00:01:34,Okay.
00:01:34,00:01:36,Do I really have to explain Venn diagrams?
00:01:36,00:01:37,"Yes, please."
00:01:37,00:01:44,So I guess as much as you've got two circles and one circle is a set.
00:01:44,00:01:46,So a category and there's a bunch of stuff in that category.
00:01:46,00:01:51,Let's say animals and then you've got another circle which is another set.
00:01:51,00:01:53,Things called Barney.
00:01:53,00:01:54,Yes.
00:01:54,00:01:55,Exactly.
00:01:55,00:01:58,And then you have this is difficult because I don't know if accounting Barney the dinosaur
00:01:58,00:02:00,has an actual animal.
00:02:00,00:02:05,I think we need a third Venn diagram circle which is fictional soft creatures.
00:02:05,00:02:08,All fictional and real animals are ever created.
00:02:08,00:02:09,There we go.
00:02:09,00:02:10,Then you can get Barney in the middle.
00:02:10,00:02:13,So the thing in the middle has to belong to those categories.
00:02:13,00:02:17,"So if you all think to work, John Venn would have to be a type of cricket ball or whatever"
00:02:17,00:02:19,"and a type of Venn diagram, neither of which is."
00:02:19,00:02:23,"Okay, so what about inventors of things that are round to do with round things and inventors"
00:02:23,00:02:27,of things that do with cricket and he invented both because cricket balls are round and
00:02:27,00:02:28,Venn diagrams are round.
00:02:28,00:02:31,"Oh no, but they're not just with cricket, are they?"
00:02:31,00:02:32,We've really got sidetracks.
00:02:32,00:02:34,It's amazing that John Venn worked it out.
00:02:34,00:02:35,It's amazing.
00:02:35,00:02:36,Love it.
00:02:36,00:02:38,He didn't call them Venn diagrams.
00:02:38,00:02:39,No.
00:02:39,00:02:40,No.
00:02:40,00:02:42,So they are a subcategory of Euler diagrams.
00:02:42,00:02:46,Things where you're representing information in circles but they don't have to be linked.
00:02:46,00:02:51,And then Venn diagrams are Eulerian circles but where there is an intersection between the
00:02:51,00:02:52,two.
00:02:52,00:02:53,"They're Euler diagrams, aren't they?"
00:02:53,00:02:54,I don't know.
00:02:54,00:02:55,I also his name was Euler.
00:02:55,00:02:56,"Yeah, you're probably right actually."
00:02:56,00:02:59,"But yeah, it is the thing that people confuse as well."
00:02:59,00:03:04,"I think the difference is that the Venn diagram, if you imagine the three intersecting things,"
00:03:04,00:03:06,it can include empty sections.
00:03:06,00:03:11,So let's say you've got two circles and one of them is mammals and another one is birds
00:03:11,00:03:13,and they're intersecting.
00:03:13,00:03:16,You have to have that middle intersection even though there's no such things a bird that's
00:03:16,00:03:17,also a mammal.
00:03:17,00:03:18,Okay.
00:03:18,00:03:19,Okay.
00:03:19,00:03:23,So he is said to have invented this diagram in 1881.
00:03:23,00:03:27,That is the date that's put on the first time that he came up with the concept.
00:03:27,00:03:32,So I was looking into 1881 just to see what other scientific inventions happened that year
00:03:32,00:03:33,and it was an amazing year.
00:03:33,00:03:34,Really.
00:03:34,00:03:35,A lot of things happened.
00:03:35,00:03:40,"So Charles Darwin published his final scientific book, which was called the formation"
00:03:40,00:03:43,of vegetable mold through the actions of worms.
00:03:43,00:03:46,Yeah.
00:03:46,00:03:47,"It's not exactly under the Deadly Hallows, is it?"
00:03:47,00:03:51,The first modern cesarean section was performed in 1881.
00:03:51,00:03:52,Was it?
00:03:52,00:03:53,Yeah.
00:03:53,00:03:59,"Alexander Fleming was born in 1881 and then lastly, Carlos Finley, who was a Cuban doctor,"
00:03:59,00:04:03,was the first to propose that yellow fever was transmitted by mosquitoes rather than direct
00:04:03,00:04:04,human contact.
00:04:04,00:04:05,Oh.
00:04:05,00:04:06,That's a huge moment.
00:04:06,00:04:07,Yeah.
00:04:07,00:04:08,That resulted in a lot of lives saved.
00:04:08,00:04:09,That's cool.
00:04:09,00:04:10,Imagine being a journalist in that year.
00:04:10,00:04:15,"Yeah, a tiny baby who's been born in Hawaii and then penicillin."
00:04:15,00:04:18,"There are lots of really nice tributes to Venn, John Venn."
00:04:18,00:04:23,"So in the Cambridge College where he taught, there's a stained glass window which is a Venn"
00:04:23,00:04:24,diagram.
00:04:24,00:04:28,He's got three circles of overlapping stained glass and in the middle is much darker.
00:04:28,00:04:32,So it's kind of half double glazed and then half single glazed.
00:04:32,00:04:34,And then a bit of it's triple glazed because there are three circles.
00:04:34,00:04:35,Wow.
00:04:35,00:04:36,That would must be really warm.
00:04:36,00:04:37,Yeah.
00:04:37,00:04:38,That's...
00:04:38,00:04:40,"So yeah, do you know what college he went to?"
00:04:40,00:04:41,Was it Gonville & Keese?
00:04:41,00:04:45,"Yeah, he went to Gonville & Keese and he did a couple of other things in his life."
00:04:45,00:04:46,"So first of all, I should explain."
00:04:46,00:04:51,He did invent the odd thing and one of them was this automatic bowling machine for cricket
00:04:51,00:04:52,balls.
00:04:52,00:04:56,And the weird thing about this was that he invented it and the Australian cricket team
00:04:56,00:05:00,had come to visit Britain and they visited Cambridge where he was at the time and he whipped
00:05:00,00:05:01,it out.
00:05:01,00:05:04,He was asked to get out of his cricket bowling machine to entertain them and it automatically
00:05:04,00:05:08,bowled out Australia's best batsman four times running.
00:05:08,00:05:09,Wow.
00:05:09,00:05:12,So that was the glory days of English cricket.
00:05:12,00:05:16,"But another thing he did, which I love, it's almost about the only other sort of thing that"
00:05:16,00:05:21,"goes down in his biography, aside from with mathematical stuff, is that he, with his son,"
00:05:21,00:05:26,"compiled a book that was a biographical list of all known students, graduates and holders"
00:05:26,00:05:31,of office ever to go to the University of Cambridge from the beginning of history up until...
00:05:31,00:05:34,"Well, he only got to 1751 before he died."
00:05:34,00:05:40,"So that was 136,000 biographies of people that he wrote."
00:05:40,00:05:42,What a dull look.
00:05:42,00:05:47,"It's not how did he find out those little biographies of all of these people, it was incredible."
00:05:47,00:05:48,School reports?
00:05:48,00:05:49,"Yeah, I guess so."
00:05:49,00:05:51,They must have had some sort of records.
00:05:51,00:05:54,"I mean, if anyone's going to have records, it's going to be like a really old university"
00:05:54,00:05:57,that has had like a consistent way of doing things for years and years.
00:05:57,00:06:00,I think they obviously had something otherwise it was just him and his son made it up.
00:06:00,00:06:01,Why would you wreck it?
00:06:01,00:06:02,Mike Smith did.
00:06:02,00:06:08,"Do you know something else that has a Venn diagram on it, ""Intribute"" is, if you live in"
00:06:08,00:06:12,"Clapham in London, or you've ever been to Clapham, there's Venn Street, which you might"
00:06:12,00:06:15,"know has got Venn Street records on it, which I really like."
00:06:15,00:06:20,"And that's named after, not John Venn, after his grandfather, who happened to be the reverent"
00:06:20,00:06:22,and erected in Clapham.
00:06:22,00:06:27,"And it does so the sign for Venn Street also has a Venn diagram on it, ""Intribute to the"
00:06:27,00:06:47,"Rectors grandson who invented the diagram."""
00:06:47,00:06:56,"Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is my fact, my fact this week is that if"
00:06:56,00:07:02,"you want to increase capacity on a cruise ship, you just simply have to cut it in half and"
00:07:02,00:07:04,add a whole new chunk of ship.
00:07:04,00:07:05,That's done.
00:07:05,00:07:06,It's so weird.
00:07:06,00:07:07,I've seen an amazing video of it.
00:07:07,00:07:12,What they do is they take these cruise ships and they dock them and they just literally
00:07:12,00:07:14,slice down the middle.
00:07:14,00:07:18,"It's obviously a spot where the original design says, ""If you ever need to cut this into two,"
00:07:18,00:07:19,"this is where it happens."""
00:07:19,00:07:22,Is it like a sort of scissors symbol in a docked life or around the ship?
00:07:22,00:07:25,And so they cut it in half and they separate it.
00:07:25,00:07:30,And then they just insert the chunk that they would like to go inside and push as if it's
00:07:30,00:07:36,"a meat to a ship sandwich, close it up, and then it's ready to go and it's fully functioning."
00:07:36,00:07:37,It's extraordinary.
00:07:37,00:07:40,The first problem I have with this is that all the rims in a hotel are cruise ship are
00:07:40,00:07:41,numbered.
00:07:41,00:07:46,"So you're going to get room like 17, 18, 18B, 18C, is it because otherwise you're not going"
00:07:46,00:07:47,to make any sense.
00:07:47,00:07:48,I bet they just renumber the rooms.
00:07:48,00:07:50,"Yeah, you can just take the numbers off, can't you?"
00:07:50,00:07:51,Probably.
00:07:51,00:07:52,I'm sure they make removable numbers.
00:07:52,00:07:55,"You do have to unscrew them, but they've got people to do that."
00:07:55,00:07:58,"In many ways, this is the smallest part of the operate."
00:07:58,00:08:04,"Yes, but they rename the ship usually when they change it as well."
00:08:04,00:08:05,Queen Mary.
00:08:05,00:08:14,You've got to come up with sort of your fits.
00:08:14,00:08:18,"So yeah, I mean, this was done with a ship, which was called the Silver Spirit."
00:08:18,00:08:19,That's one example.
00:08:19,00:08:21,And they extended it when it cut it in half.
00:08:21,00:08:25,They put in a 49 feet chunk into the middle of it.
00:08:25,00:08:29,"And the subject of cruise ships and slicing massive sections out of things, Disney owned"
00:08:29,00:08:30,a lot of cruise liners.
00:08:30,00:08:32,And they also have an island in the Bahamas.
00:08:32,00:08:34,They bought it and it's one of their destinations to their cruise ships.
00:08:34,00:08:38,"But it's sort of, you know, like a very shallow sandy island with a lot of shallow kind of"
00:08:38,00:08:39,beach around it.
00:08:39,00:08:43,"So it's too, you can't get the cruise ship anywhere near to it."
00:08:43,00:08:45,"It's not like a sort of a steep kind of, you know, cliff into the sea."
00:08:45,00:08:49,So what they did was they basically cut out an underwater parking space for their cruise
00:08:49,00:08:50,ships.
00:08:50,00:08:54,"They just dug a massive trench that goes up towards the island, so the cruise ship"
00:08:54,00:08:56,can just sort of reverse into it and go right through the island.
00:08:56,00:09:00,"And so if you look at it on Google Earth, there's just a kind of a rectangular, dark patch"
00:09:00,00:09:01,of ocean right next to it.
00:09:01,00:09:02,It's amazing.
00:09:02,00:09:03,It's so cool.
00:09:03,00:09:04,I'll post a picture on my Twitter feed.
00:09:04,00:09:06,I found a cruise ship for Dan.
00:09:06,00:09:07,Wow.
00:09:07,00:09:09,Because we've been thinking of sending you away for a while.
00:09:09,00:09:10,Thank you.
00:09:10,00:09:16,"So if you guys heard of conspiracy cruises, Dan's nodding, but he's not allowed to talk about"
00:09:16,00:09:17,it.
00:09:17,00:09:20,Never heard of it.
00:09:20,00:09:25,"These are, I can't believe this exists."
00:09:25,00:09:26,Go to their website.
00:09:26,00:09:30,It promises to deliver to anyone who's interested the truth about all these things.
00:09:30,00:09:32,And it lists the truths that it'll deliver.
00:09:32,00:09:37,"So it's the truth about global warming, fracking, HIV, vaccinations, then it gets weird"
00:09:37,00:09:38,and weirder.
00:09:38,00:09:42,"So fluoridation for bid and archaeology, JFK, September 11th."
00:09:42,00:09:43,Yeah.
00:09:43,00:09:48,You're welcome onto the ship by Captain Elvis Presley.
00:09:48,00:09:52,What is they telling the truth about Star Wars agenda?
00:09:52,00:09:53,Do you know what that is?
00:09:53,00:09:55,"That's to do with the, not the movies."
00:09:55,00:09:56,It was a present bush.
00:09:56,00:09:58,I think he was talking about it a lot.
00:09:58,00:10:02,The idea of having satellites that were able to shoot down through the atmosphere.
00:10:02,00:10:04,Presently militarizing space.
00:10:04,00:10:05,"Yes, exactly."
00:10:05,00:10:06,Got it.
00:10:06,00:10:07,OK.
00:10:07,00:10:08,Oh god.
00:10:08,00:10:13,Imagine booking for the real truth about who Luke's father really was.
00:10:13,00:10:14,Dressed to see true fear.
00:10:14,00:10:17,I think that person would get along perfectly well with everyone else.
00:10:17,00:10:21,The good news is that you don't have to have any vaccinations before you go on one of these
00:10:21,00:10:22,crickets.
00:10:22,00:10:27,It sounds so weird.
00:10:27,00:10:28,Where does it go?
00:10:28,00:10:29,So it goes all over the place.
00:10:29,00:10:30,They go to various places.
00:10:30,00:10:31,For me to try and go.
00:10:31,00:10:34,So one place it doesn't go?
00:10:34,00:10:36,They're not crazy.
00:10:36,00:10:38,"It costs $3,000."
00:10:38,00:10:41,These people don't have this money.
00:10:41,00:10:45,A popular mechanics journalist went on it because he said he read about it and thought
00:10:45,00:10:47,"it would be really fun and thought, you know, you could go with some other"
00:10:47,00:10:50,kind of jokers and discuss stuff and said it was terrifying.
00:10:50,00:10:54,So everyone's really serious there has taken it very seriously.
00:10:54,00:10:56,He ended up being chased out of various conference rooms.
00:10:56,00:11:01,So I think they suspected him of something going to flee down corridors from people chasing
00:11:01,00:11:03,him and shutting himself in his room.
00:11:03,00:11:07,"You know, as well as conspiracy cruises, they have 80s music cruises."
00:11:07,00:11:08,"Oh, yeah."
00:11:08,00:11:13,So they have whole cruises where just musical stars from the 80s perform.
00:11:13,00:11:18,So there was a great write-up of one which mostly focused on Tony Hadley of Spandau Ballet.
00:11:18,00:11:21,"And he said, I saw an advert in the paper last year for music cruises."
00:11:21,00:11:22,I couldn't believe it.
00:11:22,00:11:26,"There was Huey Lewis in the news, Pat Beneter, Crosby Stills in Nash and Alfibo."
00:11:26,00:11:29,"I phoned my manager and asked, why am I not singing at sea?"
00:11:29,00:11:33,"He said, don't worry, Tony, I'm already on it."
00:11:33,00:11:35,"This does happen a lot now, not just for 80s stars."
00:11:35,00:11:39,So the band Weezer have Weezer crews and they invite a lot of bands on.
00:11:39,00:11:44,There's a comedy cruise as well. It was just a bunch of comedians would go off on this cruise
00:11:44,00:11:45,and they were the entertainment.
00:11:45,00:11:47,That sounds like hell on earth.
00:11:47,00:11:48,"Yeah, it really does."
00:11:48,00:11:49,I throw myself in.
00:11:49,00:11:53,"Actually, speaking of comedians, there's a really good story about a cruise ship comedian"
00:11:53,00:11:54,from 1991.
00:11:54,00:11:58,"Have you guys heard of MTS Oceanus, which sank in '91?"
00:11:58,00:11:59,No.
00:11:59,00:12:00,No.
00:12:00,00:12:01,So this was a huge cruise ship.
00:12:01,00:12:06,It sank and the captain and his crew were the first people off the ship when it sank
00:12:06,00:12:07,straight away.
00:12:07,00:12:08,Bad form.
00:12:08,00:12:12,"They didn't even make an announcement over the Tanoi, say."
00:12:12,00:12:13,"Oh, really?"
00:12:13,00:12:14,That's a real faux pas.
00:12:14,00:12:15,Yeah.
00:12:15,00:12:18,"So they basically, the passengers heard this explosion on the ship."
00:12:18,00:12:19,Nothing happened for ages.
00:12:19,00:12:22,So they went to check where the captain was supposed to be and he was gone.
00:12:22,00:12:25,He left the ship unmanned and all his crew had gone.
00:12:25,00:12:30,And the only person left to save them was the ship entertainer called Moss Hills.
00:12:30,00:12:31,And he's saved everyone on the ship.
00:12:31,00:12:34,This is a great story where he rescued for 571 people.
00:12:34,00:12:39,"So first of all, he worked out how to use the ship's radio to phone a Mayday thing to say"
00:12:39,00:12:40,we're in trouble.
00:12:40,00:12:41,You're comedian.
00:12:41,00:12:42,He's got microphone experience.
00:12:42,00:12:43,Is this thing on?
00:12:43,00:12:49,You have been on a cruise and there's a massive explosion.
00:12:49,00:12:50,Maybe it was.
00:12:50,00:12:51,He just performed some comedy.
00:12:51,00:12:56,"And the people at the other end thought, God, we better save those poor passengers."
00:12:56,00:13:00,"But yeah, these helicopters came and lifeboats were used to rescue them."
00:13:00,00:13:02,And he rounded everyone up and got them onto the lifeboats and organised it.
00:13:02,00:13:06,And he and his wife and his fellow deputy entertainer were the last people off the ship.
00:13:06,00:13:07,Do you know what happened?
00:13:07,00:13:09,So I was looking up ship launching ceremonies.
00:13:09,00:13:10,Oh yeah.
00:13:10,00:13:12,And these things happen with cruise ships as well.
00:13:12,00:13:16,"The first water to touch the ship is caught, sealed in a bottle and then displayed in"
00:13:16,00:13:17,the captain's office.
00:13:17,00:13:18,How?
00:13:18,00:13:19,Do you catch?
00:13:19,00:13:20,I don't know.
00:13:20,00:13:21,What a great point.
00:13:21,00:13:24,What if you try to collect the water and there's a fish in it?
00:13:24,00:13:27,"Do you think you'd tip the fish out or do you then, because that would be quite a good"
00:13:27,00:13:28,"outcome, wouldn't it?"
00:13:28,00:13:31,Because at least you don't have this tedious bottle of water in your captain's office.
00:13:31,00:13:33,The dead fish.
00:13:33,00:13:35,Lovely little memento.
00:13:35,00:13:36,The environmental damage.
00:13:36,00:13:37,Your massive cruise ship does the ocean.
00:13:37,00:13:38,"Okay, fine."
00:13:38,00:13:40,"I'm looking on the bright side, are we?"
00:13:40,00:13:41,"Just, you mentioned ceremonies."
00:13:41,00:13:42,Yeah.
00:13:42,00:13:43,I didn't know about the line crossing ceremony.
00:13:43,00:13:45,Do you guys know about this?
00:13:45,00:13:46,No.
00:13:46,00:13:47,This happens on all ships.
00:13:47,00:13:51,"So when you turn a really inappropriate joke on a cruise ship and then we're like, no, mate."
00:13:51,00:13:54,"No, this is the line crossing ceremony is not that."
00:13:54,00:13:55,It is when you cross the equator.
00:13:55,00:13:56,But this is the thing that happens.
00:13:56,00:13:59,A lot of cruise ships are due to this ceremony.
00:13:59,00:14:00,And in the Navy they do this ceremony.
00:14:00,00:14:02,"And in also like in merchant, maybe they do this ceremony."
00:14:02,00:14:06,And it's been happening since at least the early 1800s.
00:14:06,00:14:08,"And Darwin had it done to him, for instance."
00:14:08,00:14:12,"So on the beagle, it's really funny to read his diary from there, because he really looked"
00:14:12,00:14:13,down on it.
00:14:13,00:14:17,"And it was like, come on, I'm a bloody scientist, I'm not down for all this kind of banter."
00:14:17,00:14:20,"It was an initiation thing where he had to do lots of, as he described it, extremely"
00:14:20,00:14:22,disagreeable and unpleasant things.
00:14:22,00:14:25,"So there was a lot of simulating sex acts in the olden days and stuff, I think."
00:14:25,00:14:26,Really?
00:14:26,00:14:27,Yeah.
00:14:27,00:14:30,"And what you were told to do is, well, first of all, you get kind of, well, what happened"
00:14:30,00:14:34,to Darwin is he got buttoned down in the hatchways in the dark until he was super hot.
00:14:34,00:14:37,And then you get dragged up by the crew.
00:14:37,00:14:40,And you have to go to the court of Neptune.
00:14:40,00:14:43,"So it's basically, you have to go to Neptune and be accused of your crime and you're known"
00:14:43,00:14:48,"as a polywag, until you've passed the equator successfully."
00:14:48,00:14:50,"And then you become, you know, a seasoned traveler."
00:14:50,00:14:54,"And yeah, so Darwin was trapped down and then dragged up onto the deck."
00:14:54,00:14:56,And then he had buckets of water thrown over him.
00:14:56,00:14:57,He was blindfolded.
00:14:57,00:15:02,He was made a stand on a plank above this huge bath of water and then they tipped him in.
00:15:02,00:15:05,"And what, and he thought it was the actual sea because he was blindfolded."
00:15:05,00:15:06,"Oh, probably, yeah."
00:15:06,00:15:07,I'm not talking about that.
00:15:07,00:15:09,That's a funny trick to play.
00:15:09,00:15:10,That is funny.
00:15:10,00:15:11,Yeah.
00:15:11,00:15:14,"And on walking the plank, there's an Norwegian cruise ship, which has a walk the plank"
00:15:14,00:15:15,experience.
00:15:15,00:15:16,Oh.
00:15:16,00:15:17,They make you walk the plank.
00:15:17,00:15:21,"Well, I think you volunteered to walk your foot along a net and it's an eight-foot-long"
00:15:21,00:15:24,"plank, but you do it wearing a safety harness."
00:15:24,00:15:25,"Oh, okay."
00:15:25,00:15:26,Yeah.
00:15:26,00:15:33,And then you go to the side of the ship and you drop.
00:15:33,00:15:40,"Okay, it's time for fact number three and that is Alex."
00:15:40,00:15:45,"My fact this week is that Steven Magan, Michael Parkinson, Aiman Holmes and Sheree Blair"
00:15:45,00:15:47,have all been dropped from the TV program.
00:15:47,00:15:48,Who do you think you are?
00:15:48,00:15:51,Because their ancestry is too boring.
00:15:51,00:15:53,"Are they, were they dropped mid-program?"
00:15:53,00:15:54,They were dropped.
00:15:54,00:15:55,"Yeah, pretty much."
00:15:55,00:15:58,"They signed up to do it because the program approached you and say, ""Would you like to do"
00:15:58,00:15:59,"the program?"""
00:15:59,00:16:00,"And you sign up and say, ""Yes."""
00:16:00,00:16:01,And agree to do all of the things.
00:16:01,00:16:02,And then they start researching.
00:16:02,00:16:06,"And then at some point, they went back to these people being like, ""Achee, you know what?"
00:16:06,00:16:07,"Let's leave it."""
00:16:07,00:16:08,Because it's going to be rubbish.
00:16:08,00:16:12,"The good news is that their full story has made a new series called, ""Who cares?"""
00:16:12,00:16:17,It was very funny because it sounds like they have to be quite diplomatic when they
00:16:17,00:16:18,tell them.
00:16:18,00:16:23,"So with Sheree Blair, one of the producers said, ""We spent hours locked in rooms with"
00:16:23,00:16:25,"Sheree's publicist secretary manager, personal assistant."""
00:16:25,00:16:30,"Eventually, we had to say, ""You are very interesting, but we don't have a show."""
00:16:30,00:16:38,But it's amazing because Sheree Blair is a booth and she is a descendant of John Wilk's
00:16:38,00:16:39,booth as in it's her...
00:16:39,00:16:40,John Wilk's booth?
00:16:40,00:16:42,"Yeah, who killed Abraham Lincoln."
00:16:42,00:16:43,Wow.
00:16:43,00:16:44,"Yeah, so it's not a direct descendant."
00:16:44,00:16:48,It's John Wilk Booth's uncle was Sheree Blair's direct ancestor.
00:16:48,00:16:51,And surely there was enough in there alone.
00:16:51,00:16:53,"He was really disappointed, wasn't he?"
00:16:53,00:16:54,It is kind of sad.
00:16:54,00:16:55,"All these people were, in fact."
00:16:55,00:16:56,I think she was disappointed.
00:16:56,00:16:59,I think Michael Parkinson might have said he was really sad as well.
00:16:59,00:17:00,He said he was gutted.
00:17:00,00:17:02,He said it's the one show that he would have been happy to have.
00:17:02,00:17:03,The one show?
00:17:03,00:17:09,"No, it was the only show that of all the celebrity-based programs that he actively wanted to take"
00:17:09,00:17:10,part in.
00:17:10,00:17:11,Not even Parkinson.
00:17:11,00:17:12,He didn't even draw that.
00:17:12,00:17:13,Jesus.
00:17:13,00:17:16,Stephen Mangan's is really funny because they found out that all of his ancestors were
00:17:16,00:17:20,from the same place in Ireland and the same very small place in Ireland.
00:17:20,00:17:24,"He's mother and father grew up in adjacent villages on the west coast of Ireland, but they"
00:17:24,00:17:28,never met until they both happened to come to London and then meet each other there.
00:17:28,00:17:32,I think that's so interesting that your whole family can be from one tiny spot.
00:17:32,00:17:33,Yeah.
00:17:33,00:17:34,Yeah.
00:17:34,00:17:39,"I would love to see a program done on Japan's emperor, you know, the imperial family in"
00:17:39,00:17:46,"Japan, because they have a family tree that's traced back so far that it goes into mythological"
00:17:46,00:17:47,characters.
00:17:47,00:17:52,"At that point, I would say you've lost the trace, yeah, but they believe it in Japan."
00:17:52,00:17:56,"So it's a part of the official family tree and it goes into effectively, you know, people"
00:17:56,00:17:58,who were up on clouds and-
00:17:58,00:17:59,But where's the crossover point?
00:17:59,00:18:01,That must be across the point.
00:18:01,00:18:02,"Yeah, we know where it is."
00:18:02,00:18:03,Where it is.
00:18:03,00:18:04,"Person, person, god."
00:18:04,00:18:05,Yeah.
00:18:05,00:18:13,660 to 585 BC was the life of Jimu who was an emperor and it's from there and his wife
00:18:13,00:18:19,"Isu Kiori, they both have family trees that disappear off into mythology with amazing"
00:18:19,00:18:20,cloud-flying emperors.
00:18:20,00:18:25,I like the fact that you say it traces back so far that it goes into mythology as if you
00:18:25,00:18:29,"actually think that if you go back far enough in history, you will come to mythological"
00:18:29,00:18:30,creatures.
00:18:30,00:18:35,"It'd be great to be the kids of the like, well, my father is a thunder throwing god"
00:18:35,00:18:37,and my mother is from Suffolk.
00:18:37,00:18:40,And how do they meet?
00:18:40,00:18:45,And there's also the Guinness Book of World Records actually acknowledges the longest lineage
00:18:45,00:18:47,of a family tree that is traceable.
00:18:47,00:18:48,"Oh, yeah."
00:18:48,00:18:53,"Yeah, it's called the Lurie lineage that's the Lurie family."
00:18:53,00:18:57,"And it includes people like Sigmund Freud and Martin Boober, I don't know who that is."
00:18:57,00:19:01,"St. Freud, one of the most famous bands in history, and Martin Boober."
00:19:01,00:19:04,Every son just wants to suckle on his mother's boobs.
00:19:04,00:19:08,"Oh, my god, this is crazy."
00:19:08,00:19:14,The Lurie lineage traces back to Jaheel Lurie a 13th century rabbi in breast.
00:19:14,00:19:15,In breastlet?
00:19:15,00:19:16,In breastlet?
00:19:16,00:19:17,Wow.
00:19:17,00:19:18,Freud is just steeped in.
00:19:18,00:19:19,And with boobies.
00:19:19,00:19:20,Yeah.
00:19:20,00:19:24,"Well, though, of course, when you trace stuff back far enough, as we said before, then you"
00:19:24,00:19:29,"know, you all unite around the same person, like we're all related to Martin Boober."
00:19:29,00:19:31,Are we all boobers at the end of the day?
00:19:31,00:19:34,"There is, there was a lot of this mythology stuff in the past, wasn't there?"
00:19:34,00:19:39,And there was a theory that the British royals were descended from Brutus.
00:19:39,00:19:40,Was there?
00:19:40,00:19:43,"Yeah, but Brutus ended all day to back to the fall of Troy."
00:19:43,00:19:44,Okay.
00:19:44,00:19:45,That was the thing.
00:19:45,00:19:48,"There was a Brutus who, the Roman Brutus was descended, and not the Caesar Brutus,"
00:19:48,00:19:52,"there was an earlier, more mythological Brutus, was descended from the people who left"
00:19:52,00:19:57,"Troy, the Trojans, when they left after the fall of the city, and that, through Brutus,"
00:19:57,00:20:02,that's how it descended to the English monarchs in the 15th and 16th centuries.
00:20:02,00:20:03,"Yeah, that was the myth."
00:20:03,00:20:09,"Well, Shari Blair is related to Brutus, Junius Brutus Booth, the father of John Wilkes Booth,"
00:20:09,00:20:13,"who was named after Brutus, yeah, from the play."
00:20:13,00:20:14,How many?
00:20:14,00:20:18,"And he was a very famous actor, and what's very interesting about him is that he also attempted"
00:20:18,00:20:19,to assassinate a president.
00:20:19,00:20:21,A Trojans assassinated president?
00:20:21,00:20:24,"Well, he sent a letter to President Andrew Jackson."
00:20:24,00:20:30,"He demanded that he pardon two pirates, and he, and he, there was a threat of assassination"
00:20:30,00:20:33,"if he didn't, and he got caught for it."
00:20:33,00:20:34,"Yeah, isn't that weird?"
00:20:34,00:20:35,"His dad was a dancer, yeah."
00:20:35,00:20:36,Wow.
00:20:36,00:20:39,"Well, like father, like son, you know, you know what you grow up with, you're often influenced"
00:20:39,00:20:41,"by it, aren't you?"
00:20:41,00:20:44,"Just on Shari Blair's family, Tony Booth was her dad."
00:20:44,00:20:45,Yeah.
00:20:45,00:20:48,"Not a difficult one to trace back, obviously, but he was a famous actor."
00:20:48,00:20:50,"Well, you have the discovery, Steve."
00:20:50,00:20:55,"You can't believe he didn't find out the Tony Booth thing, guys, that's right there."
00:20:55,00:20:56,He was an actor.
00:20:56,00:20:57,He was famous.
00:20:57,00:20:58,He was an intellect.
00:20:58,00:21:00,"It was part, and there is other things."
00:21:00,00:21:03,"He clearly had bit parts in EastEnders and Emadale, and he played the same character in both,"
00:21:03,00:21:06,which is a tramp who acts as a spiritual guide to one of the characters.
00:21:06,00:21:07,Cool.
00:21:07,00:21:10,"Presumably the people who made, which was Emadale in EastEnders."
00:21:10,00:21:11,Yeah.
00:21:11,00:21:15,"Presumably the people who made, say, EastEnders sought the tramp, giving spiritual advice to"
00:21:15,00:21:18,"one of the characters in Emadale and thought, we've got to get this tramp."
00:21:18,00:21:19,Yeah.
00:21:19,00:21:23,"But do you know what other films he did, Tony Booth, which I didn't know?"
00:21:23,00:21:24,No.
00:21:24,00:21:25,And it's just such a weird idea.
00:21:25,00:21:26,"It's saucy films, isn't it?"
00:21:26,00:21:27,It's such saucy films.
00:21:27,00:21:32,"We did the Confessions of Series, which was in the '70s, and it was like Confessions"
00:21:32,00:21:37,"of a Window Cleaner, which embarrassingly was the top grossing British film of 1974."
00:21:37,00:21:38,Yes.
00:21:38,00:21:39,And it's sort of comedy sex films.
00:21:39,00:21:40,"Yeah, a lot of boobers in there."
00:21:40,00:21:41,A lot of boobers.
00:21:41,00:21:42,A lot of boobers.
00:21:42,00:21:43,Yeah.
00:21:43,00:21:46,"He was in all of these Confessions of a Driving Instructor, and the plot is, as you would"
00:21:46,00:21:48,"predict, a window cleaner goes around shagging lots of housewives."
00:21:48,00:21:49,That's true.
00:21:49,00:21:50,That's true.
00:21:50,00:21:51,And that would be three things and stuff.
00:21:51,00:21:53,But he's on the other side of the window.
00:21:53,00:21:55,"That's the tragedy of the window cleaner, isn't it?"
00:21:55,00:22:00,"Yeah, but he can drill a hole because they have, um, drills, famously window cleaners."
00:22:00,00:22:01,Yeah.
00:22:01,00:22:02,You're welcome with those.
00:22:02,00:22:06,"Just clean, or shall I do the drilling service, too."
00:22:06,00:22:07,"Yeah, I could do with some air."
00:22:07,00:22:14,"The last mechanism is broken, so yeah, drill through it, thanks."
00:22:14,00:22:22,"OK, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is Andy."
00:22:22,00:22:28,My fact is that Wombats can kill predators by crushing them with their bottoms.
00:22:28,00:22:30,So it does require quite a lot of setup.
00:22:30,00:22:31,"This, um, prank."
00:22:31,00:22:32,"I'm going to call it, prank?"
00:22:32,00:22:33,Defense mechanism.
00:22:33,00:22:34,Yeah.
00:22:34,00:22:35,I wouldn't say prank.
00:22:35,00:22:36,"OK, fair enough."
00:22:36,00:22:39,"So there's an essay in the London Review of Books, a baritacle, Catherine Rundle, which"
00:22:39,00:22:43,"is all about Wombats, and it's full of very interesting facts about them."
00:22:43,00:22:45,So Wombats have burrows.
00:22:45,00:22:47,"They dig lots of burrows, actually."
00:22:47,00:22:50,"And they have very, very hard bottoms."
00:22:50,00:22:54,So we've mentioned before that sometimes they will plug the ground with their bumps when
00:22:54,00:22:55,their predators are out.
00:22:55,00:22:56,And the predators won't be able to...
00:22:56,00:22:57,Like a door.
00:22:57,00:22:58,"Yeah, like a carpet pass, yeah."
00:22:58,00:23:05,And so it turns out also that the scientists have found shattered fox skulls inside Wombat
00:23:05,00:23:06,burrows.
00:23:06,00:23:11,"So if a fox follows a Wombat into its burrow, the Wombat will crush the fox's head against"
00:23:11,00:23:13,the wall of its own burrow and kill it.
00:23:13,00:23:14,"Oh, yeah."
00:23:14,00:23:15,"It's very, very hard."
00:23:15,00:23:16,Very hard to go.
00:23:16,00:23:17,Yeah.
00:23:17,00:23:20,"Well, the roof, yeah, and apparently with dingos, they'll just slam them up against"
00:23:20,00:23:21,the roof.
00:23:21,00:23:22,"Incredible, pranks."
00:23:22,00:23:23,I'd like to...
00:23:23,00:23:28,"Harry Hill do the voiceovers, and you've been crushed."
00:23:28,00:23:31,"They're so good with their bumps, though, because they can..."
00:23:31,00:23:35,"Like, it's classic QI factors that they Wombats have cubic feces."
00:23:35,00:23:36,And then I didn't even know this.
00:23:36,00:23:37,They stack that.
00:23:37,00:23:38,They stack their poo.
00:23:38,00:23:41,"And it's supposed to be scientists think it might be some sort of like, status symbol"
00:23:41,00:23:44,"to sort of put your poo in a high tower, which you can't do, because they're square."
00:23:44,00:23:45,"Because they're square, yeah."
00:23:45,00:23:49,"So they do up to 80 to 100 a day, or per night, rather."
00:23:49,00:23:50,And they...
00:23:50,00:23:52,"They're for display purposes, effectively."
00:23:52,00:23:56,So they don't want them rolling off rocks when they put them up on a rock for it to be seen.
00:23:56,00:23:57,"Well, it's..."
00:23:57,00:23:58,"Yeah, it's to mark territory, isn't it?"
00:23:58,00:23:59,Yeah.
00:23:59,00:24:00,To attract people.
00:24:00,00:24:03,"But it's a bit rough on the baby Wombats, because Wombats, obviously, are my soupies."
00:24:03,00:24:07,"And as we've said in a previous podcast, the baby's face backwards in the pouch."
00:24:07,00:24:10,"And so what this means is, they're always pooing."
00:24:10,00:24:15,"And the baby Wombats face is usually poking out of its thing, the pouch just below its"
00:24:15,00:24:16,ass.
00:24:16,00:24:18,And it's just shoved in this pool all the time.
00:24:18,00:24:19,Yeah.
00:24:19,00:24:20,That's not true.
00:24:20,00:24:21,That's not true.
00:24:21,00:24:22,There's that baby you've got shit in your face.
00:24:22,00:24:23,AC to 100 times a day.
00:24:23,00:24:24,"The head is just poking out, isn't it?"
00:24:24,00:24:25,Yeah.
00:24:25,00:24:26,Behind the back of the mother.
00:24:26,00:24:27,Yeah.
00:24:27,00:24:32,But the weird thing is that they don't have cubic anuses that have square anuses to produce
00:24:32,00:24:33,the cubic poo.
00:24:33,00:24:34,There's a mystery.
00:24:34,00:24:36,"It's not really a mystery, because we know how they make it."
00:24:36,00:24:37,"Oh, we do know how they make it."
00:24:37,00:24:38,We do know how they make it.
00:24:38,00:24:39,So it's in the...
00:24:39,00:24:42,It takes them 14 to 18 days to digest food.
00:24:42,00:24:44,"It's very, very long."
00:24:44,00:24:48,"So by the time it gets out of them, it's really compact."
00:24:48,00:24:50,And it's had all the nutrition taken out of it.
00:24:50,00:24:52,"You know, it's very efficiently done."
00:24:52,00:24:57,"And they have ridges in the first bit of their intestine, which shapes the food as it's"
00:24:57,00:24:59,being digested into these cubic shapes.
00:24:59,00:25:04,And then they have also have special bones in the bottoms to keep the poo in the cubic shape.
00:25:04,00:25:05,Wow.
00:25:05,00:25:06,Yeah.
00:25:06,00:25:07,It's like an inbuilt cookie cutter.
00:25:07,00:25:08,It is.
00:25:08,00:25:09,It's holding the...
00:25:09,00:25:10,It genuinely is.
00:25:10,00:25:12,"In December, they do Christmas trees as well."
00:25:12,00:25:17,It would be great if they could vary it like a balloon magician.
00:25:17,00:25:18,What should we do?
00:25:18,00:25:20,Not come into your children's parties.
00:25:20,00:25:24,"Well, she's booked the one bag again."
00:25:24,00:25:26,"Well, I like about one bag says."
00:25:26,00:25:31,You can see pictures of them where when the young one bag that's in the pouch is almost
00:25:31,00:25:34,"mature enough to leave, it's probably poking its head out and it grazes, so it'll be eating"
00:25:34,00:25:36,grass out of the back.
00:25:36,00:25:38,And the mother will eat grass out of the front.
00:25:38,00:25:41,And it just looks like it's a two-headed ball bag.
00:25:41,00:25:42,That's incredible.
00:25:42,00:25:43,Wow.
00:25:43,00:25:44,Amazing.
00:25:44,00:25:46,"You must have seen them, Dan, because you..."
00:25:46,00:25:47,You're Australian.
00:25:47,00:25:48,Yeah.
00:25:48,00:25:49,I've seen them in captivity.
00:25:49,00:25:50,They're so beautiful.
00:25:50,00:25:51,"They're my favourite animal, I have to say."
00:25:51,00:25:53,I saw one for the first time this year.
00:25:53,00:25:54,"Yeah, really."
00:25:54,00:25:55,Amazing.
00:25:55,00:25:56,"Oh, when we went to Oz, yeah, it's the course."
00:25:56,00:25:57,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:25:57,00:25:59,"And Australian zoos, apparently, they have the second highest danger rating."
00:25:59,00:26:02,So the only things that beat them are lions and bears.
00:26:02,00:26:05,"And then as a zookeeper, the next thing you've got to be terrified of is the one bag."
00:26:05,00:26:06,When we talk.
00:26:06,00:26:08,"For a large guinea pig, it's quite weird."
00:26:08,00:26:09,Yeah.
00:26:09,00:26:10,And they run so fast as well.
00:26:10,00:26:11,Yeah.
00:26:11,00:26:13,They can run as fast as you say in bolt.
00:26:13,00:26:14,"I mean, faster, faster."
00:26:14,00:26:15,For longer.
00:26:15,00:26:16,Yeah.
00:26:16,00:26:19,"They can run at 25 miles an hour, and his top speed is about 27."
00:26:19,00:26:20,Yeah.
00:26:20,00:26:26,"But your same bolt can run at 27 miles an hour, give or take, for about what, nine seconds."
00:26:26,00:26:29,One bats can run at 25 miles an hour for 90 seconds.
00:26:29,00:26:31,"So if they were trying to catch him, they would."
00:26:31,00:26:36,We don't know whether or not you same bolt could keep that up for longer.
00:26:36,00:26:37,That's just what he...
00:26:37,00:26:38,That's where he has to stop.
00:26:38,00:26:40,No one's ever put him on a longer track.
00:26:40,00:26:43,"He's done a 200 metre, but that's a different discipline."
00:26:43,00:26:44,He's running a different pace there.
00:26:44,00:26:45,That's a good point.
00:26:45,00:26:46,If he reaches a...
00:26:46,00:26:49,"If we just said, just keep going when you get to the end."
00:26:49,00:26:53,Are you saying you think he could run at that speed for a kilometre?
00:26:53,00:26:56,"Well, a minute and a half would be, because that's what a one-back can do."
00:26:56,00:26:57,Yeah.
00:26:57,00:26:59,I'd be curious to know what his deceleration was.
00:26:59,00:27:00,Would you...
00:27:00,00:27:03,What you think he might just be choosing to run 200 metres a bit slower?
00:27:03,00:27:05,"Because never mind, often, anyway."
00:27:05,00:27:11,"I was hoping that we'd glossed over my theory, but no, thank you for bringing that back up."
00:27:11,00:27:12,Yeah.
00:27:12,00:27:17,I was looking up other animals that use their arses in interesting ways.
00:27:17,00:27:18,Cool.
00:27:18,00:27:21,"There's a type of caterpillar called the Skipper Caterpillar, which does the thing called"
00:27:21,00:27:23,"""scat firing""."
00:27:23,00:27:28,"So it's able to launch its poo out of its back end, kind of a high speed."
00:27:28,00:27:29,It was...
00:27:29,00:27:33,I think it's trying to think it was genetically evolved as a way of just getting or
00:27:33,00:27:35,"put away from you, just seeing if I hide you in reasons."
00:27:35,00:27:36,Yeah.
00:27:36,00:27:39,But it's also pretty good for shooting like wasps that come to an issue.
00:27:39,00:27:40,Wow.
00:27:40,00:27:41,Isn't that great?
00:27:41,00:27:42,Yeah.
00:27:42,00:27:44,It's like a paintball gun or something.
00:27:44,00:27:47,"Like a clay pigeon shooting, kind of thing."
00:27:47,00:27:48,Yeah.
00:27:48,00:27:49,"Wow, imagine."
00:27:49,00:27:50,Who wasps shooting?
00:27:50,00:27:55,We had evolved to be able to shoot pigeons with poo as they approached us.
00:27:55,00:27:56,Yeah.
00:27:56,00:28:00,I think clothing would have evolved differently to allow you easy access to a weapon.
00:28:00,00:28:01,Yeah.
00:28:01,00:28:02,Yeah.
00:28:02,00:28:03,But it's amazing how it works.
00:28:03,00:28:08,So poo comes out in pellets and so they come out and then they get sort of stored inside
00:28:08,00:28:13,"a special launch pad, an anal kind of launch pad, and then it pumps up the blood pressure."
00:28:13,00:28:19,"Like, you know, when like in a computer game, like, yeah, and then, and then kind of like launches"
00:28:19,00:28:20,it like a catapult.
00:28:20,00:28:21,Wow.
00:28:21,00:28:22,"Oh, what?"
00:28:22,00:28:24,So they poo inside themselves and then...
00:28:24,00:28:25,"Yeah, pretty much."
00:28:25,00:28:26,...store it up for the launch.
00:28:26,00:28:29,"...into the, like, the, what's it called, like, into the chamber?"
00:28:29,00:28:30,Yeah.
00:28:30,00:28:31,So you've got a false bottom.
00:28:31,00:28:32,Or you've got a second bottom.
00:28:32,00:28:33,Exactly.
00:28:33,00:28:34,A second bottom inside your first bottom.
00:28:34,00:28:35,Yeah.
00:28:35,00:28:36,Because the first...
00:28:36,00:28:37,They're all magicians.
00:28:37,00:28:38,Wow.
00:28:38,00:28:39,That's extraordinary.
00:28:39,00:28:40,That's incredible.
00:28:40,00:28:41,That's really amazing.
00:28:41,00:28:42,So there was a...
00:28:42,00:28:43,I'd rather like this.
00:28:43,00:28:46,"So there used to be a giant wombat, which were weighed three tons."
00:28:46,00:28:51,It was about the size of a rhino and it lived until really recently.
00:28:51,00:28:56,So we think it only died out around the time that humans first reached Australasia.
00:28:56,00:29:00,"So there's a big question about who killed the giant wombat and whether it was us, basically."
00:29:00,00:29:01,Okay.
00:29:01,00:29:02,Sounds like it was us.
00:29:02,00:29:03,Yeah.
00:29:03,00:29:05,"It does sound like it was us, but maybe it was environmental."
00:29:05,00:29:07,"Maybe it was, you know, climate factors or something like it was probably us."
00:29:07,00:29:10,It was probably us who killed all the giant wombat's.
00:29:10,00:29:14,"But they were alive until about 50,000 years ago."
00:29:14,00:29:16,So it's really recent that we had these things.
00:29:16,00:29:17,As big as rhinos.
00:29:17,00:29:18,As big as rhinos.
00:29:18,00:29:19,Imagine that.
00:29:19,00:29:20,That's crazy.
00:29:20,00:29:23,And their hindquarters were very developed for their size.
00:29:23,00:29:25,"So they had, like, like, super anuses."
00:29:25,00:29:26,"Oh, man."
00:29:26,00:29:29,You could build a pyramid out of the squares coming out of that.
00:29:29,00:29:30,Wow.
00:29:30,00:29:31,Yeah.
00:29:31,00:29:36,"So they were saying, what if a marsupial had evolved into a horse-like creature?"
00:29:36,00:29:37,How would that have affected?
00:29:37,00:29:42,"It was just a discussion for them saying, wouldn't it have been cool if we could have domesticated"
00:29:42,00:29:46,the giant wombat and used that in equestrian ways?
00:29:46,00:29:47,Yes.
00:29:47,00:29:48,So they are very hard to domesticate.
00:29:48,00:29:49,And also if you're wrong.
00:29:49,00:29:51,"That might be extinct by 50,000 years."
00:29:51,00:29:56,So Iraq and we be overrun with them and living underground and it would be a nine now.
00:29:56,00:30:00,"Riding them presumably you'd have to face backwards because of the pouch thing, which I think"
00:30:00,00:30:01,would be quite difficult.
00:30:01,00:30:02,You're proposing that you get into the pouch.
00:30:02,00:30:03,I see.
00:30:03,00:30:04,"That's how you'd ride it, right?"
00:30:04,00:30:05,You get on it.
00:30:05,00:30:06,You get on top of it.
00:30:06,00:30:07,Do you think?
00:30:07,00:30:08,Yeah.
00:30:08,00:30:09,What if it had a baby jumping in the pouch?
00:30:09,00:30:10,Yeah.
00:30:10,00:30:11,That's a good point.
00:30:11,00:30:13,"Also, we've established you'd just be having that shit all over your face all the time."
00:30:13,00:30:14,It's not ideal.
00:30:14,00:30:15,Yeah.
00:30:15,00:30:20,Is there an animal living currently that has a pouch big enough that a human could sit inside
00:30:20,00:30:21,"it of living, though?"
00:30:21,00:30:22,Yeah.
00:30:22,00:30:24,"I mean, the kangaroos probably got the biggest pouch."
00:30:24,00:30:25,Yeah.
00:30:25,00:30:26,Even quite large kangaroos.
00:30:26,00:30:27,You can't fit a baby in there.
00:30:27,00:30:29,You can fit a baby into a kangaroo's pouch.
00:30:29,00:30:30,Yeah.
00:30:30,00:30:32,They're gross and disgusting and you wouldn't want to do it.
00:30:32,00:30:34,"We're talking about just, you know, theoretical theoretical."
00:30:34,00:30:35,You have a baby.
00:30:35,00:30:36,I have a baby.
00:30:36,00:30:37,That's all right.
00:30:37,00:30:40,You could definitely fit a human baby into a kangaroo's pouch.
00:30:40,00:30:41,I don't think so.
00:30:41,00:30:45,The largest kangaroos that go into pouches are definitely the size of human babies.
00:30:45,00:30:46,"Actually, you're right."
00:30:46,00:30:47,"Babies are small, aren't they?"
00:30:47,00:30:48,"No, you're right."
