 Hello and welcome to another working-from-home episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.320
 coming to you from four undisclosed locations in the UK.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.680
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin,

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.280
 and Anna Tajinsky, and once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:38.360
 four favorite facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:44.600
 Starting this week with my fact, my fact is sand dunes are brilliant at social distancing.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.600
 Mmm.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.600
 Oh yeah.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.600
 Topical.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.600
 Very topical.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.600
 So, they're safe.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.880
 Sand dunes are inanimate objects.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:53.880
 Okay.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.080
 So, I would suggest that if they're two metres apart, they will always remain two metres

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.320
 apart as they're not moving, are they?

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.960
 They sand dunes do move.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.200
 They constantly are travelling through the desert.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:10.160
 They are a body that falls over on itself and travels.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.160
 Okay.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.240
 So, yeah, sand dunes are constantly shifting, and that's why when deserts encroach on places,

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.040
 you've got these giant waves of sand dunes that head towards you.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.640
 It's like an army, but scientists in Cambridge University have sort of simulated, they've

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.040
 built an experiment whereby they've been able to study the movement of sand dunes, and

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.000
 they've discovered that basically they do communicate with each other in, you know, inverted

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.200
 commas communicate with each other by sending signals to not encroach on their patch, so

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.640
 they don't collide.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.680
 We still fully don't understand why it is.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:43.760
 I mean, it's pretty extraordinary.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.600
 The latest theory that they've come up with is it's much like if you're in a boat and

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.120
 there's the wake of the boat pushing the water back behind you, it's pushing the sand

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.880
 June behind it to keep it at a regular distance.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.600
 Although we should say, because otherwise I think people will be confused, but when you say

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.200
 collide, and it's a mystery whether they don't crash into each other, obviously the main

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.280
 reason they don't crash into each other is because they're moved by winds and air currents,

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.360
 and so you don't get one moving in one direction and another moving in the opposite direction

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.440
 and then galloping towards each other very often.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.120
 So when we say crashing into each other, it's almost always one sneaking up on the other

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.640
 or, you know, how calm one of them just go a bit faster than the other, and it does seem

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.840
 to be, doesn't it, that the one in front, effectively slows down the one behind it?

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:27.840
 Exactly.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.640
 And it's worth saying that there are different speeds, though, to sand dunes.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.200
 So a big sand-dune is much slower than a small of sand-dune, and when I say much slower,

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.680
 I do realise we're talking by centimetres per year.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:44.040
 But they do travel at different speeds, and even the smaller ones will respect a distance

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.120
 gradually as some kind of communication sort of.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.120
 Okay.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.120
 Again, it's all theories.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.040
 You're saying, like, a little guy will go really, really fast until it gets a certain distance

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.720
 away from the big guy, and then it'll go, "Okay, now I'm going to respect the distance,

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.040
 and I'm just going to slow down to your pace."

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.040
 Exactly.

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.360
 And then they move at the same pace.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.360
 Okay.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.520
 It's not going to crop up as a plotline in the first and the furious films anytime soon, basically.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.840
 The slow and the very, very placid.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.440
 They do kind of go to sleep, though, each night, and wake up each morning.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.640
 Again, this is a metaphor.

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:23.520
 Because of that, there's a big, big temperature change, obviously, they're mostly in beachy

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.400
 and deserty environments, and especially in the deserty environments, it's way warm

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.560
 in the day, then at night.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:37.560
 And that big temperature difference stirs the sand quite a lot, and at noon, the sand-dune

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.200
 kind of wakes up, and the little winds are generated by the temperature difference and

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.640
 the greasing temperature, and they move the surface around.

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.760
 And that can be another thing that moves the dunes a few metres a year.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.600
 So is it possible to tell the time if you're in the desert by looking at sand-dune or not?

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.480
 I mean, I think you'd look at the colour of the sky, it's completely dark.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.560
 I think we know what time it is.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.480
 That's the most amazing nomad skill you could have.

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.480
 That'd be really good.

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.920
 I was reading the other day that if you're on a mountain and you want to know how high

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:13.160
 it is, you can tell it by getting a bottle of Coca-Cola and putting some mentos in it.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.840
 You know that trick that they often do in America where you kind of put your mento mint in

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.320
 there and then suddenly it sloshes up.

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.840
 If you're on a mountain and you have those two things, you can put the mento inside the

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.000
 Coke and the amount that it sloshes up, it can tell you the height of the mountain.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 That's okay.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 That's so cool.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.800
 It's to do with the air pressure, I think.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.800
 It's amazing that Edmund Hillary ever made it to the top of Everest without his Coke

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:37.800
 mintos.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:45.680
 Do you need to have quite a big boss or presumably because is it the more it goes up the higher

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.720
 you are, or is it an inverse relationship?

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:54.220
 Well, here's the problem, I didn't really read that, but it's so if we were going to go

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.940
 on a hiking expedition next week, I'm going to have to do a bit more research.

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.940
 I guess the air pressure?

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:00.940
 It's air pressure.

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:01.940
 Yeah.

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:02.940
 So, yeah.

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.920
 Wouldn't your Coke freeze at a soda and height, though?

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.040
 Would it freeze if you're on top of Mount Everest, which is the highest mountain?

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.040
 Maybe.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.040
 What's how are they drinking?

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.880
 Maybe they're taking out one of those thermoses that you carried soup in on a school trip

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:15.880
 when you were young.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:16.880
 Exactly.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.400
 I can't believe you had soup in a thermos on your school trips whenever an outside sandwich

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:21.400
 is.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.000
 Andy, actually, an incredibly traumatising childhood memory I don't want to talk about.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.200
 It was the worst thing ever.

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.200
 It's incredibly embarrassing.

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.360
 It always spilled everywhere on the coach.

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.120
 No one would want to say next to me, "God, I hate my mother."

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.200
 What was she thinking?

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:41.760
 This experiment, we didn't quite go into it then, I think, right?

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:49.360
 So, basically, what they had was like a big, perspex circular tank with two walls, so

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:54.200
 the sand dunes could go around the circumference of the circle, right, and they could kind of chase

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.200
 each other.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:01.160
 But the guy who did it was called Carol Batchick and he works in Cambridge University.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:06.080
 And the reason that he did this experiment is he was just looking at one sand dune going

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.440
 around his thing and he's thinking, "This is boring."

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:15.680
 It's like taking ages to get any kind of data.

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:20.240
 And so, what I'm going to do is I'm going to double my capacity and put two sand dunes

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.240
 in and then I could get twice as much data.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:24.560
 I'm just going to do that.

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:28.880
 And then when he did that, it started a new experiment that he hadn't intended to do.

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:33.620
 But what's really interesting is it's pretty much impossible to actually make a sand dune in

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:34.620
 the lab.

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:37.480
 For years and years, they said it was impossible.

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:43.280
 This experiment gives an idea of what a sand dune might do, but of course, the difference

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:49.520
 between that and an actual massive meters and meters high sand dune could be quite different.

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:55.680
 And so, in Mongolia, in 2007, they got a bulldozer and flattened a whole lot of the desert

00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:01.440
 and they set up an experiment to see a sand dune being made from scratch.

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:02.440
 Wow.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:07.660
 But show me, even the longest PhDs don't quite last long enough to genuinely want to sand

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:10.200
 dune form from nothing and then move, do they?

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:12.400
 Or do they just sit in the desert for decades?

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:15.200
 They just sat there for decades, yeah.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.000
 They passed it on to their children, actually.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.000
 Wow.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.960
 It's like a sourdough starter.

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:26.480
 Well, not unfortunately, just as it happens, what they learned was exactly what everyone

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:30.120
 thought would happen according to the experiments they did in the lab.

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:33.680
 So they did all these experiments and it turned out that what happened was exactly what

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.720
 everyone thought was going to happen, which-

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:36.720
 That's annoying.

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:40.760
 Is it annoying in a way, but in another way, at least they've proven their theories are

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:41.760
 correct?

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:42.760
 Yeah.

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:43.760
 Yeah.

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:47.640
 Did you know the second highest sand dune in Europe is in Wales?

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:48.640
 Is it?

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:55.600
 That place, which is nicknamed the South Wales Sahara, it's 800 acres of sand.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.680
 And the dune's got up to 200 feet tall, which is actually-

00:07:58.680 --> 00:07:59.680
 That's massive.

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:00.680
 Yeah, yeah.

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:03.280
 It's so sandy there that Lawrence of Arabia was partly filmed there.

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:04.280
 Really?

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:07.080
 It was a stand-in for Arabia, yeah.

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:08.560
 The tallest ones in France, isn't it?

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:09.560
 I think I've been to it.

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:10.560
 Yeah.

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:11.560
 Have you?

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:12.560
 Yeah.

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:13.560
 The tallest one in Europe.

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:15.720
 I actually have been to the tallest one in the world as well.

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:16.720
 Wow.

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.520
 That's in Peru, I think.

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:21.120
 And I've stand-boded on it as well.

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:22.120
 Cool.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:23.120
 How do you do it?

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:24.360
 How do you go about that?

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:29.320
 You pay money and they give you, they take you on a dune buggy and they do lots of tricks

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:33.000
 over the sand dunes and then they take you to the top of one of the biggest ones and

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:39.400
 they put you on what is less like a snowboard and more like a tea tray and they tell you

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:44.240
 just to go to the bottom and to make sure that you talk everything because I didn't stand

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:48.800
 up on it, I kind of like body-bodied down it and they tell you to hide all your limbs otherwise

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.320
 they'll get chopped off and stuff.

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:55.320
 It's like, sir, what environment are you going through?

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:57.560
 That's what they said.

00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:01.280
 They said like, if you don't tuck your arms in then you'll probably lose them.

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:02.280
 Wow.

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:07.200
 I know you remember tea trays because your mum probably gave you one so that you're often

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:09.960
 in tea on all these cool trips.

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:14.120
 Actually, sand duneing, what are you calling it, sandboarding?

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:16.240
 Sandboarding can be quite dangerous.

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:18.720
 Well, that's what they said.

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:25.600
 How many, what kind of injuries and you lose your arms and legs, I told you.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:28.640
 You can, obviously, by fine that when you get to the bottom of the sand dune then all

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:33.680
 your limbs have chopped off, but you can find this is incredibly rare.

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:38.480
 They didn't know it could happen until 2013 but you can just fall into one.

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:42.160
 So, do you read this extraordinary story?

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:47.680
 No, obviously not, otherwise I wouldn't have gone sandboarding.

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:52.160
 This oven in 2013 is in a place called Mount Bulldy which is on the side of Lake Michigan

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:55.120
 in Indiana and it's a huge sand dune.

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:59.800
 It's a 126 feet tall and it swallowed a boy.

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:04.120
 I'm just going to say right now, just so everyone's not traumatised, the boy ended up

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:05.120
 okay.

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:10.160
 But, he was running up at the top of the sand dune with his mate and his dad to then run

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:15.320
 down it or do James' trick and suddenly he disappeared and his dad looked around and

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:19.080
 he'd gone and his friend said he just fell into the sand and got swallowed.

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:24.040
 I mean, you would, even if you're not done, you would immediately think Mongolian death

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.440
 worm, wouldn't you?

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:31.880
 So, that was the conclusion they all jumped to and they spent weeks looking into that to

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:32.880
 no avail.

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:38.080
 No, this is amazing, bizarrely by chance there was a geologist who was walking by and she

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:42.720
 saw dozens of people on the side of this sand dune just digging away in the sand saying,

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:45.360
 this just swallowed a small boy, we need to get him out.

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:49.360
 And one of the people, they heard the boys say from deep within the dune, "Help me, I'm

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:50.360
 scared."

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:54.360
 And this geologist was like, that is rubbish, that's totally impossible and she just walked

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:55.360
 on, went home.

00:10:55.360 --> 00:11:00.040
 Even though she heard the child, she didn't, no, no, no, she didn't hear the child, she

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:05.040
 just got told by the people digging, she thought, no, that kid's just playing hide and seek.

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:10.240
 Anyway, it turned out they saw these tiny little holes in the sand that kind of went through

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:13.920
 and it seemed that they were leading towards some massive cavity underneath it which she

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:18.440
 just dropped into and then I got immediately covered up and they excavated and excavated

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:23.440
 after three and a half hours, they managed to find him hidden in a cavity in the sand dune

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:31.920
 12 feet underground and he was unconscious and like really cold and he spent a couple of weeks

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:37.680
 in hospital and amazingly recovered but they had no idea why sand dune shouldn't swallow

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:42.320
 anyone up and this geologist hated herself so much for not believing it had happened

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:43.320
 at the time.

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:49.040
 She's then led this amazing study, she's called Erin Argyllan and she's found out that it's

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:54.640
 from hollowed out trees so the sand dune is galloped along as they do and it's galloped

00:11:54.640 --> 00:12:00.520
 over these old trees have rotted then from the inside and been encrusted with fungus

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:05.800
 so it's just got these tubes so it's got these weird channels leading down from it but they

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:10.120
 don't, you can't see the openings in the in the surface so it looks like nothing.

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:12.120
 Wow, that's really cool.

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:13.120
 Don't sound awful.

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:18.560
 There's another thing that they might swallow apart from six-year-old boys which is there

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:26.120
 was a city built in Tunisia for Star Wars and not the original Star Wars films, I'm talking

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:31.560
 episode one, The Phantom Menace, the true original but in 2013 there were lots of news reports

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:35.320
 and I haven't annoyingly, I haven't found what happened after these reports but it's

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:39.560
 reported that that location city built for The Phantom Menace which is called Moss Esper

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:45.160
 in the movie was about to be buried by a giant crescent-shaped sand dune and this was really

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:49.920
 good news actually, not only because it removed evidence of the Phantom Menace from the

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:59.520
 city else, also because it was hard for scientists to measure sand dune movement because it's

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:03.520
 very hard to find a fixed measurement point because it's a nightmare when you're in

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:07.000
 the desert you think oh well is this moved 50 meters or has it not moved at all?

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.480
 We don't know because there's nothing else here apart from more sand but this was obviously

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:12.200
 very useful because it was fixed in the ground.

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:17.560
 And they could kind of look at where it is and compare it to the movie and say okay on

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:23.120
 this date it was in front of this part of Star Wars in the first and then it was here but

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:26.960
 they would have to watch The Phantom Menace though to do that.

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:28.840
 That's true and no scientist has been found.

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:30.800
 Yeah that's a PhD but you really don't want to do.

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:36.800
 I'd rather stand in the Mongolian desert for 20 years.

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:42.120
 One of the famous things about sand dunes is that they make this singing noise and Marco Polo

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:47.160
 wrote about it in the 13th century he said that he heard eerie sounds coming from the sand dunes

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:52.080
 around him and that the logical conclusion was that he must be in the presence of evil

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:53.080
 spirits.

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:54.080
 Wow cool.

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:57.040
 But it has to be really specific sand doesn't it?

00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:00.160
 You can't get on any old sand dune there aren't actually many in the world that do it

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:04.600
 but it's got to be a very fine type of sand and I think it's the same sort of mechanism

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:09.480
 that you get on some beaches where the sand really squeaks and I've never really had this

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:15.200
 before because in Britain we have beaches that I love but that are objectively quite crappy.

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:19.080
 So I'd never seen it before until I went to visit Bruni Island off the coast of Tasmania

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:23.680
 at Christmas and there every time you put your foot down it sort of shrieks at you like

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:25.680
 it's hurt you feel kind of bad for it.

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:30.440
 Yeah it is weird creaky floorboard sounds isn't it as you're walking along so you can't

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:34.760
 sneak up on someone on a beach it's actually a very good mechanism to throw.

00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:40.920
 That's why you moved here isn't it down because you just kept getting caught in Australia.

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:45.780
 We've been giving sand dunes very mixed messages in this country lately because we've been

00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:51.860
 trying to get them to stop moving for years and building fences around them and people sometimes

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:56.920
 cover them in oil which is very unpleasant which should like ways them down and we plant

00:14:56.920 --> 00:15:00.280
 lots of vegetation on them so if you go to the coast you'll see vegetation planted and

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:03.700
 suddenly conservationists have turned around and said oh hold on, sand dunes are supposed

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:04.700
 to move.

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:10.820
 This is like kind of nailing a horse to the floor and so now we're talking which is and they

00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:15.320
 don't do that because horses are supposed to move and so now we're trying to get sand dunes

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:20.240
 moving again and the national lottery is given 4 million pounds to get sand dunes moving

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:21.240
 again.

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:22.240
 Wow.

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:27.920
 They've set up a new app haven't they the couch to five metres.

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:34.600
 Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is James.

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:39.360
 Okay my fat this week is that according to a recent publication people from the north

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:44.240
 of England are more than twice as likely to be naturally funny than people from the south

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:46.840
 of England.

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:50.400
 Sounds like a very scientific publication who conducted this.

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:52.020
 Oh I didn't write that down.

00:15:52.020 --> 00:16:03.300
 I probably was it nature or I can't remember it was the b-no it was the comic for b-no but

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:07.500
 who knows comedy better than the people who write the b-no that's what I want to know.

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:08.500
 Absolutely.

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:09.500
 Absolutely.

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:11.060
 So what were the details of the study?

00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:14.420
 They were scant.

00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:20.740
 It was the analysis of famous British comedians carried out by statistician Dr Jeff Ellis and

00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:26.180
 he looked at all the different comedians and what their particular attributes are and

00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:31.260
 then he surveyed people to say how funny do you think these people are and I think thanks

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:35.940
 to the fact that Peter K comes from the north of England and people like Peter K when

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:40.660
 we came at the top and you guys are all not as funny.

00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:41.660
 Yeah.

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:45.540
 Didn't he also say that a gem in eyes are more naturally funny than Leo's?

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:47.780
 I didn't read that bit because I'm not a gem in eye.

00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:52.100
 I only cherry picks the bits that specifically said good things about me.

00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:53.100
 Ah okay.

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:57.420
 I think there's a study to also say that and can I just say as a Leo from the south of England

00:16:57.420 --> 00:17:01.980
 I'm just honoured to be here.

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:05.260
 People who are born in a city are supposed to be funny and you were born in London.

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:06.260
 I was.

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:09.900
 Is that again is that a causing to apparently professional statistician Jeff Ellis who

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:13.500
 must be questioning where his career's gone right now?

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:20.140
 The Bino is pretty dry these days if they're having to resort to statistical analysis.

00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:22.820
 We should quickly say there'll be a lot of international listeners who might not know

00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:24.260
 what the Bino is.

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:30.660
 This is the longest running comic in the UK and it is famous for having created Dennis

00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:36.820
 the Menace, the British one, not the American one and there has a sort of sister publication

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:41.580
 called Dandy that has desperate Dan and so a lot of iconic British characters came out

00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:42.580
 of this.

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:48.380
 It was named after you walking along a beach, wasn't it?

00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:52.180
 Depraved Dan was the character's original name.

00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:59.140
 Deported Dan after Daniel and I was caught.

00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:03.020
 You mentioned desperate Dan in the very olden days so it feels right that we're correcting

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:04.020
 the balance now.

00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:07.060
 I think he had to give our beating cow pie didn't he?

00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:08.060
 Oh yeah.

00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:13.780
 We all have a friend who used to work on the Bino until quite recently.

00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:14.780
 Really?

00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:19.380
 Matthew Heighton, comedian, excellent comedian, I should say, also from the north of England

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:20.900
 very funny guy.

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:26.300
 He used to work for the Bino and he's still part of the Bino WhatsApp group where everyone

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:31.220
 sends each other messages about the Bino and I asked him if they had any facts and so do

00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:34.340
 you want to hear some facts from the Bino WhatsApp group?

00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:40.380
 So the Bino offices in London are on Fleet Street and it is where people believe that

00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:46.500
 Swini Todd was supposedly had his barbershop and so they get loads of tours of people who

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:51.700
 want to see the kind of dodgy, murdery parts of London always go to the Bino offices and

00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:52.700
 have a look around.

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:56.380
 They don't go into the offices, they go into like the alleys next to the office because

00:18:56.380 --> 00:18:57.380
 that's amazing.

00:18:57.380 --> 00:18:58.380
 Swini Todd supposedly feels.

00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:01.660
 They're one of the biggest pranksters of all time, Swini Todd.

00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:06.580
 Well, he didn't have cow pies but he did have people pies, didn't he, I guess.

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:11.420
 Yeah, probably the inspiration for desperate Dan, who knows.

00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:15.740
 I found out in my Bino research, niche fact that definitely international listeners weren't

00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:21.740
 care about, which is the breed of dog that Nasha is because if you look at Nasha, he's just

00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:26.620
 sort of like a big frizzy lump of black with some legs sticking out and he's actually

00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:33.220
 a very rare breed. He's an Abyssinian wirehead of tri-pound and he's a very rare breed of dog

00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:37.260
 from the mountains of Eastern Africa, according to the Bino website.

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:41.460
 They're world famous for their thick black coats which are as strong and tangled as barbed

00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:46.620
 wire, which is weird because barbed wire actually when it's erected is not tangled at all.

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:48.020
 But they're also famous for their strong.

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:49.020
 The bar bits are.

00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:50.020
 Yeah.

00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:51.020
 I suppose bits of it are.

00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:52.020
 You're right, the bar bits are, aren't they?

00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:53.020
 Sorry, Anna.

00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:54.260
 Are you just being silly?

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:55.580
 This isn't a real kind of dog, is it?

00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:59.340
 Of course it is, they're also famous for their strong teeth that can chew through concrete

00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:00.340
 and smash bricks.

00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:06.340
 Did you know that Nasha can speak real people words, but only on Halloween.

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:07.340
 Oh.

00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:10.540
 Again, well, this breed of dog is particularly famous for that.

00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:13.380
 They are extremely rare now.

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:17.660
 The American Dennis Menace, we've mentioned before, the beautiful coincidence that they both

00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:19.300
 appeared at the same time.

00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:24.660
 These two characters with the same name and both wear red and black costume.

00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:29.780
 And American Dennis the Menace, I was looking into how he came about his origin story.

00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:34.900
 And he was actually inspired by, this is the story that's told in 1950 when the artist

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:40.660
 Ketchum was drawing, his wife came in to interrupt him to say that their own four-year-old son,

00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:46.500
 Dennis, had just demolished their bedroom by putting fecal matter that he'd found in his

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:50.740
 underpants all over the room and declared him a menace.

00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:54.420
 And so he thought, oh, that sounds like a good character name.

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:59.860
 So he went healthy clean up the shit off the walls and then created Dennis the Menace.

00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:04.540
 Because there was a song a few years before both of these characters came along that was

00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:07.820
 quite popular called Dennis the Menace from Venice.

00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:11.420
 And most people think that the reason that they came at the same time is because they were

00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:14.900
 both inspired by this song, which had become popular.

00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:18.180
 But the poo on the wall story is quite persuasive, so it might do that.

00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:21.420
 The poo on the wall story also features in the music called song, doesn't it?

00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:24.300
 So I think it might take the same trajectory.

00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:28.380
 I think the creators of the British version of Dennis said that he was inspired by that

00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:30.060
 musical song.

00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:33.460
 And actually, I looked up the lyrics to this song, although I can't find the melody

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:35.420
 and I really want it.

00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:39.940
 Dennis the Menace from Venice is a gay gondolier with gold rings in his ears.

00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:42.580
 And he's a massive player.

00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:48.180
 So the whole song is about how he's this gondolier who seduces other men's wives down the canals

00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:49.180
 of Venice.

00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:53.100
 And the nine in the evening, he dines with a blonde at 10, he has got a brunette.

00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:57.260
 At midnight, you'll find him with some ginger gal, and he teaches them all how to pet.

00:21:57.260 --> 00:22:03.380
 Well, it's a bit like mumbo number five, doesn't it?

00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:09.700
 Another song which originally ended up with the protagonist smearing his poo on over the

00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:10.700
 walls.

00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:16.500
 Mumbo number two, they had to rename it in the name.

00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:20.620
 There was, it's obviously a lot of the humour in the Bino is really lavatorial, and there

00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:28.020
 was a plan in 2017 to do a Bino takeover at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.

00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:33.140
 And what they wanted to do was amend the, they've got a cast of Michelangelo's David there,

00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:37.340
 and they wanted to tweak it so that it would fart as people pass by.

00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:41.660
 And I can't find any evidence that it happened because there was fury in the museum that there

00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:45.220
 was going to be, there was actually genuinely irritating to people.

00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:49.660
 And one, there was a memo doing the rounds about the plans, and somebody replied and inside

00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:54.060
 it from the museum said, "Frankly, some of the things in the memo are disgusting while it's

00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:59.740
 important to encourage children to visit farting statues are not the way to do it."

00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:10.780
 So Bino launched in 1938, and there's not many copies left of the original issue, but

00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:15.540
 by weird coincidence, I saw one the other day, a friend of mine, yeah, called Oli Driscoll.

00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:20.660
 He's a cameraman for, he works on movies like the latest Jurassic Park movies and touching

00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:23.300
 the void and the fast and furious movies.

00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:29.180
 Back in 1999, he bought the Bino first issue for 6,000 pounds.

00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:34.380
 And as far as he knows, it's the only issue that has the toy, that it came with the free

00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:35.900
 toy, which was a mask.

00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:39.420
 Oh my God, he has, you know the guy who has that.

00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:44.580
 Yeah, he hasn't shown it to me, yeah, and he hasn't in mint condition and he's up for selling

00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:45.580
 it.

00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:48.500
 So if anyone wants to buy a very expensive comic book magazine, he's got it for sale.

00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:52.460
 Dan, I'm really interested because I read a bit about that thing and it said that it came,

00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:57.340
 it said the toy that it came with, it called it a woopie mask, and I obviously only know

00:23:57.340 --> 00:24:03.780
 the woopie cushion, but presumably this is not a mask where someone has to sit on your

00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:04.780
 face.

00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:09.340
 I don't know, I think maybe woopie, is it possible?

00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:11.340
 Woopie had a different meaning to it back then.

00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:12.340
 I think it didn't far.

00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:15.660
 I've seen a picture and I can't see where they would have got the farting mechanism into

00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:16.660
 it.

00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:17.660
 It's very flat.

00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:18.660
 Glasses.

00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:19.660
 Yeah.

00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:21.460
 Do you know what the oldest comic strip in the world is about?

00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:22.460
 No.

00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:26.620
 This is what's established recently is the oldest of Weston comic book.

00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:30.580
 And by comic book, it's like something that's mass-produced and it has speech bubbles and

00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:32.620
 it released every week, every couple of weeks.

00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:37.500
 It's called Looking Glass and it ran for three editions and it was the adventures of

00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:40.660
 a coat being worn by different people.

00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:44.740
 Is it about that there's a go-goal story about the coat, isn't there?

00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:45.740
 The overcoat.

00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:46.740
 All the great thing.

00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:47.740
 Yeah, the other coat.

00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:48.740
 The other coat.

00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:49.740
 It was not based on a go-goal story.

00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:50.740
 It was pre-that.

00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:51.740
 It was 1825.

00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:52.740
 Wow.

00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:54.900
 Maybe go-goal based his story on the comic.

00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:56.420
 On his dream of a coat.

00:24:56.420 --> 00:25:01.020
 I just can't imagine two people had the same idea about doing a story about an overcoat.

00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:02.020
 You're right.

00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:03.220
 Well, we don't know this one was an overcoat.

00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:04.220
 It might have been an undercoat.

00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:05.220
 No.

00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:06.220
 It was just a coat.

00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:07.220
 What is an undercoat?

00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:08.220
 I don't know.

00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:10.940
 It's just something I made up that would be the opposite of an overcoat.

00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:15.140
 Anyway, it was, it had a character's like Billy the Bullie and Ranting Dan.

00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:17.140
 And this was, you know, 200 years ago.

00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:22.140
 Dan, you're getting an absolute pasting in it.

00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:28.140
 Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is Anna.

00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:34.460
 My fact this week is that in 1943, German troops who were rescuing Mussolini had to seize

00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:39.420
 control of a tourist, finicular railway, so they could ride a cable car to the top of

00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:41.580
 the hill and pick him up.

00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:42.580
 So cool.

00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:45.220
 What an awkward journey in that finicular railway cable car.

00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:50.260
 It must have been with the two elderly tourists and the 20 Nazi goons who refused to budge

00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:51.260
 and get out of it.

00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:55.060
 No, we paid for our ride and we will damn well take it.

00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:58.300
 So what was he doing at the top of the hill on that?

00:25:58.300 --> 00:25:59.300
 That's a good question.

00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:00.780
 He was just hanging out there.

00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:02.900
 So I didn't know this had happened.

00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:07.460
 But when Mussolini was deposed by his own people because they finally realised that he was

00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:14.980
 shit in every way in 1943, he was a reservoir's own council and they sort of took him prisoner

00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:18.580
 and they moved him around to a lot of different places and then eventually they plopped him

00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:25.260
 at the top of the Grand Saso d'Italia which has a lot of very high mountains in the Appanines.

00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:31.460
 And it's only reachable by cable car and Hitler was a fan of Mussolini, heard about this,

00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:35.020
 asked out where he was and ordered this rescue operation.

00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:40.340
 And so in order to rescue the plan was send some troops there and pick him up.

00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:45.340
 And so the other had to seize this cable car just because they go quite slowly cable cars

00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:46.340
 at the best of times.

00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:50.940
 And I reckon in 1943 very slowly, imagine the rush and the frenzy.

00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:51.940
 Yeah.

00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:56.940
 So it's a finicular cable car which is where they have the two counterbalances.

00:26:56.940 --> 00:27:00.780
 So they'll have two cable cars, one on one side and one on the other.

00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:03.420
 But it was a crazy operation, this Mussolini rescue.

00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:10.380
 It was part cable car based and mostly glider based and so the plan was for these ten tiny

00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:15.220
 little glider planes to land on the top of this mountain which they'd sort of done some

00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:18.620
 reconnaissance on and thought they'd seen a big meadow they could land on which turned

00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:21.300
 out to be a massive rocky field.

00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:27.620
 So they all crash landed, some of them were quite badly injured, ran in to pick up Mussolini.

00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:31.540
 And one of the SS commandos apparently vomited inside his glider which made it very unpleasant

00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:34.600
 to shovel in for the rest of them.

00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:39.000
 They were so flimsy these tiny little gliders and the pilots were so nervous about it because

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.880
 of that that one of the pilots in one he couldn't see out the window because it was really

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:48.700
 blurry so he got a knife out and he just jammed a hole in the fuselage so he could look

00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:53.580
 out and then pushed a bit the fuselage out so he could look out with a plane.

00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:54.580
 And then they picked him up.

00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:59.660
 They sort of and they sort of gave him up quite sort of okay take him that's fine like no

00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:03.620
 bullets were fired it was a and Mussolini requested that as well.

00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:08.140
 He said please no one no one shoots and yeah it was quite a peaceful operation.

00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:10.620
 And they didn't get him out by the finicular did they?

00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:14.860
 He no they were there was an idea to get him out by a finicular so they were planning

00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:19.480
 to land a plane at the bottom of the finicular that he could just board but the plane crash

00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:24.540
 landed and lost a wheel on landing so instead they got him out by a small light aircraft

00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:29.300
 from the top of the mountain and they got it okay which also sounds crazy and your wife

00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:34.660
 the pilot so maybe she could say how unstable this is but they were terrified about leaving

00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:38.620
 because it was a really light aircraft and it was overcrowded to the extent that Mussolini

00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:42.780
 was six foot four massive guy sat in the passenger seat and then the guy who was in charge

00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:47.560
 of the operation captain scores any was wedged in the luggage compartment behind an underneath

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:54.380
 seat and way too heavy so it like career down this hill bonked down this hill which wasn't

00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:59.400
 the kind of surface they wanted and then did a nose dive off the edge of a precipice

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:04.460
 and they only survived because the pilot realized that he'd have to leave it in freefall for

00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:09.920
 a while so in order to get up the requisite speed he could then pull the plane up and start

00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:10.920
 flying it away.

00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:15.000
 Mussolini was bad dude I think we can all agree.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:21.320
 He was also a British spy for some time yeah he was hired by the British in 1917 and he

00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:26.780
 was given a wage by MI5 to help keep Italy fighting in the war because in the first war they

00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:31.720
 were on the same side as the British and that was about £6,000 a week so you know he owes

00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:33.680
 a lot of his early success to MI5.

00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:35.440
 That's a huge amount of money.

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:38.680
 Yeah I said modern day that much was that much at the time.

00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:39.680
 Modern day that much.

00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:43.640
 Yeah it was £100 a weekly wage at the time which is about £6,000 now.

00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:44.640
 Okay.

00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:51.000
 You have to buy a secondhand car or well you know what £6,000 you don't even eat it.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:56.000
 You can buy the first edition of the Beno for that back in 1999.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.000
 Terrible news.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.480
 Italy has dropped out of the war but I did secure this.

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:05.880
 Check out my whirpy mask guys.

00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:09.800
 I think we've briefly mentioned before that his son Romano was a jazz musician.

00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:10.800
 Yes.

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:12.920
 And a famous jazz musician more or less in his own right.

00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:17.680
 I just wanted to add on I found a memorial article about him in the Atlantic and the headline

00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:20.440
 was he made the refrains run on time.

00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:21.440
 Oh nice.

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:22.440
 I'm funniculous.

00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:23.440
 Yeah.

00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:24.440
 Yeah.

00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:25.440
 Oh great.

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:28.320
 I made a list of all the funniculars I've been on as part of my research.

00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:29.320
 Great.

00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:30.320
 How many?

00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:31.320
 And I've been on.

00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:35.080
 Well only six is not enough but one of them was closed when I visited it so it would

00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:36.080
 have been seven.

00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:40.280
 So can you just quickly re-explain for maybe some of the audience listening to this show

00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:44.440
 who might not understand what a funnicula is, what it is?

00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:45.960
 Sorry to do that.

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:47.680
 We obviously all know.

00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:54.960
 So it's a little railway which is the normally they're designed to go up and down very, very

00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:55.960
 steep hills.

00:30:55.960 --> 00:31:01.960
 So if you've got a very steep mountain side, it's a great way of getting up and down there

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:05.840
 with not too much without going round and round the houses.

00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:07.680
 So it's a direct line.

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:11.160
 And usually one car is ascending while the other is descending.

00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:12.160
 So there are two.

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:16.760
 And sometimes there's just one line and the cars are going towards each other and they're

00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:20.000
 about to hit each other and then just at the very middle of the line, the line branches

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.200
 off into two and they go around each other and then use the same line again.

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:24.600
 That's a very efficient way of doing it.

00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:29.320
 And the reason they're really useful is because you're using the weight of one of your

00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:31.120
 trains to pull the other one up.

00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:36.680
 So as one is descending, it's pulling the other one up so you need a lot less energy.

00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:39.960
 That's the crucial thing about them is the counterbalancing and they still use a little

00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:43.960
 motor so they still need to be able to pull themselves up the hill but it's so much

00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:44.960
 counterbalancing.

00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:49.280
 So they're using basically the potential energy of one to pull up the other one.

00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:55.720
 But like Anna says, you do need some, it's not a completely perfect system of amateur

00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:56.720
 motion.

00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:59.800
 So you need a little leg up.

00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:04.520
 Apparently sometimes you can make them move just by having enough people in the cabin.

00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:08.880
 If you crush enough slightly overweight people in, it can just weigh it's way down.

00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:12.200
 So that's an insulting moment when you step into a funicular.

00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:14.920
 And finally they're like, thank God we've got them.

00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:15.920
 OK.

00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:21.320
 It's like I was once in television studios in London and there was a lot of people in the

00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:24.640
 lift and I needed to get in the lift as well.

00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:29.920
 And I got in and as soon as I walked in it started beeping and said, sorry, too much weight

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:30.920
 in this lift.

00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:34.760
 So I had to walk out and get the stairs while everyone else got the lift.

00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:36.560
 Yeah, that's all good.

00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:38.720
 That's very unfair, but it's just because you were the last one in.

00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:42.960
 It's only really insulting if you get in and the guy who's running a lift has alright

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:46.280
 people, you six people are going to have to be a little afraid.

00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:47.880
 I was once on an aeroplane.

00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:52.320
 I don't know if I've said this before, but I got an aeroplane and I think it was in Hawaii

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:53.320
 or somewhere.

00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:58.800
 It was somewhere where it's a small aeroplane and they made the move to counterbalance the

00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:04.560
 weight of the plane and said, excuse me Sarah, can you, can you set over the wings?

00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:09.520
 I'm not particularly overweight, man, you know, it's like, Andy, I want to know the

00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:13.680
 last time you went into a lift that there was a man running it, or all the lifts.

00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:18.840
 I only go into a lift which has an operative.

00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:22.600
 Yeah, it would have been longer ago than the last time I was in a finicular, which was in

00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:23.600
 Hastings last year.

00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:27.120
 You know, when you said you've been in six finiculars, does that include going up and going

00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:28.120
 down as separate ones?

00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:37.480
 Oh, okay, if we don't know, I've been in 12 finiculars.

00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:39.200
 I find them kind of weirdly lovely.

00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:44.120
 Again, I'm a bit of a finicular obsessive, not that much, because I've only been in 12/6,

00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:45.120
 but...

00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:47.880
 Furnicular and moss, they're your two loves, aren't they, Andy?

00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:48.880
 Pretty sad, isn't it?

00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:56.360
 If you imagine a finicular overgrown with moss, and that would be my dream.

00:33:56.360 --> 00:34:02.480
 But they are very cool, and I find them quite weird, because obviously they're only usual

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:04.880
 in very hilly or mountainous places.

00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:08.840
 And so you get loads of them in seaside resorts, like Scarborough has five.

00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:09.840
 Really?

00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:12.400
 Yeah, or it has had five at various different points.

00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:13.400
 Hastings has two.

00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:16.120
 Do you guys know the song about finiculars?

00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:17.120
 No.

00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:18.400
 Really famous one.

00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:22.720
 Furnicular, from the 1880s.

00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:23.720
 Are you cool?

00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:24.720
 Are you cool?

00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:25.720
 No.

00:34:25.720 --> 00:34:27.720
 You would know it.

00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:29.960
 If you heard it, you would know it for sure.

00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:37.600
 It's like a really famous Italian song that like...

00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:39.840
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:46.320
 Furnicular, finicular, finicular, finicular, finicular, finicular, finicular, finicular, so it's really,

00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:48.480
 really famous in the 1880s.

00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:54.400
 And Richard Strauss was on holiday in Italy, and he heard this song, and he thought, because

00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:57.280
 it's such an absolute banger of a tune, isn't it?

00:34:57.280 --> 00:35:02.640
 He thought that this must be like a really old, like, classical Italian song, and so he put

00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:07.440
 it in one of his compositions, and then the guy who actually wrote it, who was living in

00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:10.960
 Italy, heard this, and he was like, "That's my song.

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:11.960
 What's going on?"

00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:19.520
 And so he sued Richard Strauss for the money for his song, and he won as well, and as far

00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:24.680
 as I can see, it's like one of the oldest examples of someone suing for someone stealing

00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:25.680
 their songs.

00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:26.680
 Wow.

00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:27.680
 Isn't that cool?

00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:28.680
 That's amazing.

00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:31.400
 Jim Ireland has one cable car.

00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:32.400
 Just a one.

00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:33.400
 Just a one.

00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:35.600
 Just a one cable car.

00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:41.800
 It takes people from Cork to Dursy Island, which is just off the coast of Cork, and it's

00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:47.840
 the only way of getting to the island, and there was outcry a few years ago, when it was

00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:51.880
 announced that no longer was the cable car allowed to be used to transport cows.

00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:57.480
 This is actually a serious problem, because a lot of the Dursy Island industry, which

00:35:57.480 --> 00:36:01.200
 admittedly is quite small, I think it only now has two permanent residents.

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:06.400
 A lot of the industry is quite cow-based, quite cattle-based, and the cable car is tiny.

00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:08.080
 It can fit one cow.

00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:15.080
 So when they were moving cows over, the farmers, you just were moving the cows across.

00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:18.960
 The farmers would have to put them one at a time, and this one cable car, there were great

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:24.200
 pictures of them just embarking, and then would they have to sometimes put the cow across,

00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:30.000
 but then send some call and back, and then put a chicken back in and send that back.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:34.680
 There were so many awkward trial runs where the chicken was dead, the cow was dead and

00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:35.680
 they could only block them.

00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:36.680
 That's so amazing.

00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:37.680
 It's just one thing.

00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:38.680
 It's really cool.

00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:39.680
 Surely you could squeeze it.

00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:41.200
 You could go and lie on top of the cow.

00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:42.720
 Man, it's pretty small.

00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:48.520
 You could maybe squeeze in an Italian fascist, but that's not true.

00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:52.680
 I've got a new favourite cable car as a result of researching this fact.

00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:53.680
 It's a cable car.

00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:56.640
 I want to know what your old favourite cable car was.

00:36:56.640 --> 00:37:00.760
 My old favourite one was the one I got in Hong Kong, which took you across mountain ranges

00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:06.240
 to go to Ocean Park, which we used to get most of my childhood, astonishing cable car.

00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:11.640
 But that's been superseded by a mountain cable car in South Germany, which takes you to

00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:14.240
 the top of a mountain called the Wank.

00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:15.240
 I've been there.

00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:16.240
 You've been to the Wank?

00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:17.240
 Of course.

00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:20.520
 So you've been on the Wank Barn?

00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:21.520
 I have been.

00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:25.680
 I have watched ski jumping at the Wank mountain.

00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:31.280
 And I've watched Andreas Wank, the ski jumper, jumping at the Wank mountain.

00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:32.760
 I think it's right.

00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:35.480
 It's next to Garmish Heart and Care, can I think?

00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:36.480
 Yes, that's correct.

00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:40.840
 So, yeah, so to get to the top of it, if you want to take the quick way, you get the

00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:45.040
 Wank Barn and the Wank Barn leads you to the top and there's a Wank house at the top

00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:46.040
 as well.

00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:50.800
 And I just say, then, the Wank Barn sounds like the disgusting sequel to the song "Love

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:51.800
 Shack."

00:37:51.800 --> 00:38:02.320
 It's a little no place where you can get together with yourself.

00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:04.120
 Yeah, so yeah.

00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:08.960
 And also, if you go regularly, you can get a Wank pass, which gets you a sort of year-round

00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:11.200
 permit to get the cable car.

00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:12.200
 Wow.

00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:14.640
 It's a pretty rough place to clean, isn't it?

00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:17.840
 That is cool cleaning stuff.

00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:24.000
 Coincidentally, I'm banned from all six of the funiculars I've been on, but not the other

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.000
 six.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:35.280
 OK, it's time for our final factor, the show and that is Andy.

00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:39.800
 My effect is that, in medieval Germany, bad musicians were tied to an instrument called

00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:41.280
 the flute of shame.

00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:47.760
 That doesn't sound like much of a, I mean, was it a massive flute or...

00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:50.400
 It was, it was a flute.

00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:52.360
 I think everyone knew it was the flute of shame.

00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:53.360
 OK.

00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:54.960
 And that's, as always, that's where the shame comes from.

00:38:54.960 --> 00:39:02.160
 And so it's called the Shandflood, or Shandflood, and so this is, it was a metal device with

00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:04.960
 a collar at the neck, so it was clamped onto you.

00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:11.080
 And your fingers would supposedly be clamped at the keys, not really a flute, more of a clarinet.

00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:16.840
 I've written, I've written flournet in my notes, which I like, but that's just a mistake.

00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:20.480
 So there are a couple of these things only in existence.

00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:23.920
 One of them is in the Medieval Crime Museum in Rothenburg, and in other words, in the Amsterdam

00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:25.440
 Torch Museum.

00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:31.240
 And so there's a, I couldn't quite work out if these things, you know, were real or if

00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:39.360
 they were Victorian reproductions, but I did find a paper in the journal Torture, which

00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:44.280
 is all about other, it's about other shaming instruments.

00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:50.400
 And there were definitely things like the neck violin, which could be attached to you.

00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:55.480
 And you might be put in the, in a pillory, you know, you might be tied up somewhere with

00:39:55.480 --> 00:40:00.040
 this wooden violin, again, attached to your neck by a kind of iron band.

00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:01.040
 I saw a picture of that.

00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:04.240
 It doesn't, to me, it didn't look like a violin at all.

00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:07.480
 I think they just called it that because it goes on your neck, didn't they?

00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:08.480
 Exactly.

00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:12.360
 And then there are so much definitely to look like violins.

00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:13.360
 Oh, okay.

00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:16.320
 Because if this one does look like a flute, that's why it confused me.

00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:17.320
 Yes.

00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:18.320
 Or clarinet, you know.

00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:19.320
 Or clarinet.

00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:20.320
 Or clarinet, you know.

00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:21.320
 It's one of larynx.

00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:22.840
 Do you have to play it while you're in it?

00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:24.640
 I mean, accounts vary.

00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:28.400
 Some people say you'd be sort of put on and walked around a bit, and you'd have to,

00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:30.280
 you know, go, yeah, I am a crap musician.

00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:31.280
 But.

00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:34.400
 Oh, it is the perfect instrument for feeling sorry for yourself as well, the violin.

00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:35.520
 So that's quite a piece.

00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:36.520
 Yes.

00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:41.080
 So I asked Greg Jenner about this, whether he thought this was a real thing or not.

00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:48.400
 And he asked Dr. Eleanor Jeneger, who is at Going Medieval on Twitter, who's a medieval historian.

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:50.080
 And she isn't sure.

00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:54.720
 She thinks that it might be one of those inventions that were, as she puts it, retrofitted, as

00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:58.600
 in just like a Victorian, more of a Victorian idea.

00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:04.040
 On the German Wikipedia, it says, in recent times, the shan flute is often presented as

00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:09.080
 a punishment for bad musicians, but like the neck violin, which also resembles musical instrument,

00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:13.440
 it served to punish various minor violations of the legal system.

00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:18.360
 So not for musicians, but just a more general kind of punishment like the stocks kind of thing.

00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:21.000
 So I guess we just don't really know, do we?

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.000
 It's kind of.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:23.000
 Yeah.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:28.520
 So the violin definitely seems to be a thing, but not necessarily for musicians, perhaps,

00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:29.520
 no, no.

00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:33.080
 It seems to make more sense that they'd be used to punish an actual crime, but they did

00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:34.960
 use to make punishments fitting with the crime.

00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:41.000
 So maybe if you've stolen a violin or beaten up a violinist, you know, it's, it's waiting

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:45.800
 for a long time if you make a massive metal flute for someone to steal a flute, isn't it?

00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:47.840
 It's like, surely it'll happen eventually.

00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:48.840
 What do they steal?

00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:49.840
 Are they stolen some bread?

00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:50.840
 Okay.

00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:55.720
 Have we got a massive bit of metal, still waiting on the flute?

00:41:55.720 --> 00:42:01.160
 Not only did they have the neck violin, but I saw as well that in one of these museums,

00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:05.360
 the crime museum in Rotterdam, that they got a double neck violin.

00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:09.160
 And the idea of the double neck violin was, according to the little caption that goes

00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:13.800
 with the, with the item is that it was for arguing couples and they would have to walk around

00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:17.240
 with them on, sometimes with bells attached, ringing.

00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:20.840
 The idea was that they would walk in shame until they resolved their argument.

00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:25.440
 So it was just a quick way of making them actually talk to each other and shaming themselves

00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:28.080
 into an understanding of their points.

00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:30.640
 And why is there a violin hanging between them?

00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:33.360
 It just seems like they're totally a relevant part of that set up.

00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:34.360
 What's romantic?

00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:37.720
 Oh, so when they make up, they can do a little serenade.

00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:38.720
 Yeah, exactly.

00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:41.640
 It's like when someone comes to your table, where you're having dinner and plays a song for

00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:42.640
 you.

00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:44.960
 Fair enough.

00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:48.480
 So just on flutes, is it flutist or flautist?

00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:49.480
 Flutist.

00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:50.480
 Okay.

00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:51.800
 One vote for flautist.

00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:53.480
 It seems to be that in America, it's flutist.

00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:59.560
 Although one of the greatest ever players, Julius Baker, he has said it should be flutition.

00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:00.560
 Mmm.

00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:01.560
 Like a beauty.

00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:05.280
 It tells us that one of the flutes are flutist.

00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:06.280
 I've always said flautist.

00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:07.280
 I thought that was the...

00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:09.480
 I think it is the standard in the UK, definitely.

00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:10.480
 I do.

00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:11.480
 Me too.

00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:12.480
 I think that's because we're British.

00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:13.480
 Dan?

00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:14.480
 Yeah.

00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:15.480
 I'm not a good one to ask.

00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:17.640
 I only just found out through James that I've been saying "peanest" wrong this whole

00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:18.640
 time.

00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:19.640
 That it's a "peanest".

00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:20.640
 Okay.

00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:24.120
 But flutes are four times as old as farming.

00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:25.120
 Okay.

00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:26.120
 Yeah.

00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:29.520
 People were just eating flutes for the first 30,000 years.

00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:30.520
 They...

00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:34.320
 They found these bones with holes in them, didn't they?

00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:40.600
 And the holes are the correct distance apart to make you think that they must be a flutist.

00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:41.600
 Mmm.

00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:43.760
 I'm a little bit unconvinced by it, I must say.

00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:44.760
 But that is like...

00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:51.840
 Well, so there's one which I think they more convinced by, which is 35,000 years old.

00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:54.840
 And there's one which is a bit of a borderline case, and that's the one I'm betting on, which

00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:57.160
 is 43,000 years old.

00:43:57.160 --> 00:44:01.360
 It could be unbelievably good luck that there are these holes in it, or it could be there

00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:06.800
 a lot of bones with some of them must have holes in it in the right spaces.

00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:12.720
 But the 43,000-year-old one is the leg bone of a cave bear, which is an incredibly epic thing

00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:13.720
 to make.

00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:14.720
 I know.

00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:18.520
 I mentioned the combination of skills that you need to be a flute player in 43,000 years

00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:19.520
 ago.

00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:22.560
 You need to be able to kill a bear, but also to have the finesse.

00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:23.560
 Yeah.

00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:24.560
 Did you play?

00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:25.560
 That is incredible.

00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:30.080
 We can safely say that the coolest guy in an orchestra, or girl, which is not a difficult

00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:37.560
 thing to be, I know, but it's definitely the person who's playing the bear's limb.

00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:43.560
 In 1969, there was an Australian park ranger, and he heard the sound of a flute playing

00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:48.520
 in the park, and it turned out that it was a bird called the Liabird, and the Liabird

00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:55.320
 can copy people's noises, and you know, you sometimes see them on like a nature documentaries

00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:59.120
 where they're making the sound of drills or something like that or mobile phones because

00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:00.360
 they've copied them.

00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:06.200
 So he heard this bird that was singing a tune that sounded just like a flute, and he did

00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:10.840
 some research, and he found that 30 years earlier, there was a flute player who'd lived near

00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:15.640
 the park with a pet Liabird, and he used to play the flute to this bird, and then he let

00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:18.360
 the bird go free into the forest.

00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:23.520
 And what he surmises is that that bird then taught the song to all the other Liabirds,

00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:30.000
 and so what we're hearing now in the, or in 1969, in the forest was like a recording of

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:33.800
 a 1930s song that that guy had played on his flute.

00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:39.760
 And it was that song about the Dennis the Menace from Venice, wasn't it?

00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:43.360
 We should make full orchestra's out of birds to save us having to carve all these instruments

00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:44.680
 out of bear limbs.

00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:47.520
 We could just train up Liabirds to play everything.

00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:54.520
 Or like Beyoncé should release her next album, Purely Unburished.

00:45:54.520 --> 00:46:00.860
 Okay, just one thing going back to medieval punishment very quickly, in medieval Ireland,

00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:07.880
 the punishment for masturbation was penance of 120 days, so you had to do your Hail Mary's

00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:13.600
 and our fathers and stuff for 120 days, and for a priest it was a penance of a full year

00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:16.360
 every time you masturbated you had to do that.

00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:26.880
 And that is according to the penitential of Cmeneanus, which is the penitential of Cmeneanus.

00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:33.760
 There was a guy called Cmeneanus, and he wrote that these rules about, so I'm getting a bit

00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:41.160
 of interference, what was he called, James, so he was called, he was also sometimes called

00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:48.320
 just Cmenean, if you didn't call me Fred.

00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:51.640
 If you wanted to Latinise his name, it was Cmeneanus.

00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:59.800
 Well, I bet he didn't want to Latinise his name very much.

00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:06.640
 Okay, that is it, that is all of our facts, thank you so much for listening.
