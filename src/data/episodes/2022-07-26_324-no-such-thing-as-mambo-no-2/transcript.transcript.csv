00:00:14,00:00:20,"Hello and welcome to another working-from-home episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast"
00:00:20,00:00:24,coming to you from four undisclosed locations in the UK.
00:00:24,00:00:28,"My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin,"
00:00:28,00:00:32,"and Anna Tajinsky, and once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our"
00:00:32,00:00:38,"four favorite facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:38,00:00:44,"Starting this week with my fact, my fact is sand dunes are brilliant at social distancing."
00:00:44,00:00:45,Mmm.
00:00:45,00:00:46,Oh yeah.
00:00:46,00:00:47,Topical.
00:00:47,00:00:48,Very topical.
00:00:48,00:00:49,"So, they're safe."
00:00:49,00:00:52,Sand dunes are inanimate objects.
00:00:52,00:00:53,Okay.
00:00:53,00:00:58,"So, I would suggest that if they're two metres apart, they will always remain two metres"
00:00:58,00:01:01,"apart as they're not moving, are they?"
00:01:01,00:01:02,They sand dunes do move.
00:01:02,00:01:05,They constantly are travelling through the desert.
00:01:05,00:01:10,They are a body that falls over on itself and travels.
00:01:10,00:01:11,Okay.
00:01:11,00:01:15,"So, yeah, sand dunes are constantly shifting, and that's why when deserts encroach on places,"
00:01:15,00:01:19,you've got these giant waves of sand dunes that head towards you.
00:01:19,00:01:24,"It's like an army, but scientists in Cambridge University have sort of simulated, they've"
00:01:24,00:01:29,"built an experiment whereby they've been able to study the movement of sand dunes, and"
00:01:29,00:01:34,"they've discovered that basically they do communicate with each other in, you know, inverted"
00:01:34,00:01:39,"commas communicate with each other by sending signals to not encroach on their patch, so"
00:01:39,00:01:40,they don't collide.
00:01:40,00:01:42,We still fully don't understand why it is.
00:01:42,00:01:43,"I mean, it's pretty extraordinary."
00:01:43,00:01:47,The latest theory that they've come up with is it's much like if you're in a boat and
00:01:47,00:01:52,"there's the wake of the boat pushing the water back behind you, it's pushing the sand"
00:01:52,00:01:54,June behind it to keep it at a regular distance.
00:01:54,00:01:57,"Although we should say, because otherwise I think people will be confused, but when you say"
00:01:57,00:02:01,"collide, and it's a mystery whether they don't crash into each other, obviously the main"
00:02:01,00:02:05,"reason they don't crash into each other is because they're moved by winds and air currents,"
00:02:05,00:02:09,and so you don't get one moving in one direction and another moving in the opposite direction
00:02:09,00:02:11,and then galloping towards each other very often.
00:02:11,00:02:16,"So when we say crashing into each other, it's almost always one sneaking up on the other"
00:02:16,00:02:20,"or, you know, how calm one of them just go a bit faster than the other, and it does seem"
00:02:20,00:02:26,"to be, doesn't it, that the one in front, effectively slows down the one behind it?"
00:02:26,00:02:27,Exactly.
00:02:27,00:02:30,"And it's worth saying that there are different speeds, though, to sand dunes."
00:02:30,00:02:35,"So a big sand-dune is much slower than a small of sand-dune, and when I say much slower,"
00:02:35,00:02:38,I do realise we're talking by centimetres per year.
00:02:38,00:02:44,"But they do travel at different speeds, and even the smaller ones will respect a distance"
00:02:44,00:02:47,gradually as some kind of communication sort of.
00:02:47,00:02:48,Okay.
00:02:48,00:02:49,"Again, it's all theories."
00:02:49,00:02:53,"You're saying, like, a little guy will go really, really fast until it gets a certain distance"
00:02:53,00:02:56,"away from the big guy, and then it'll go, ""Okay, now I'm going to respect the distance,"
00:02:56,00:02:59,"and I'm just going to slow down to your pace."""
00:02:59,00:03:00,Exactly.
00:03:00,00:03:01,And then they move at the same pace.
00:03:01,00:03:02,Okay.
00:03:02,00:03:07,"It's not going to crop up as a plotline in the first and the furious films anytime soon, basically."
00:03:07,00:03:09,"The slow and the very, very placid."
00:03:09,00:03:14,"They do kind of go to sleep, though, each night, and wake up each morning."
00:03:14,00:03:16,"Again, this is a metaphor."
00:03:16,00:03:23,"Because of that, there's a big, big temperature change, obviously, they're mostly in beachy"
00:03:23,00:03:27,"and deserty environments, and especially in the deserty environments, it's way warm"
00:03:27,00:03:29,"in the day, then at night."
00:03:29,00:03:37,"And that big temperature difference stirs the sand quite a lot, and at noon, the sand-dune"
00:03:37,00:03:42,"kind of wakes up, and the little winds are generated by the temperature difference and"
00:03:42,00:03:44,"the greasing temperature, and they move the surface around."
00:03:44,00:03:48,And that can be another thing that moves the dunes a few metres a year.
00:03:48,00:03:53,So is it possible to tell the time if you're in the desert by looking at sand-dune or not?
00:03:53,00:03:58,"I mean, I think you'd look at the colour of the sky, it's completely dark."
00:03:58,00:04:00,I think we know what time it is.
00:04:00,00:04:03,That's the most amazing nomad skill you could have.
00:04:03,00:04:04,That'd be really good.
00:04:04,00:04:07,I was reading the other day that if you're on a mountain and you want to know how high
00:04:07,00:04:13,"it is, you can tell it by getting a bottle of Coca-Cola and putting some mentos in it."
00:04:13,00:04:17,You know that trick that they often do in America where you kind of put your mento mint in
00:04:17,00:04:20,there and then suddenly it sloshes up.
00:04:20,00:04:24,"If you're on a mountain and you have those two things, you can put the mento inside the"
00:04:24,00:04:29,"Coke and the amount that it sloshes up, it can tell you the height of the mountain."
00:04:29,00:04:30,That's okay.
00:04:30,00:04:31,That's so cool.
00:04:31,00:04:32,"It's to do with the air pressure, I think."
00:04:32,00:04:36,It's amazing that Edmund Hillary ever made it to the top of Everest without his Coke
00:04:36,00:04:37,mintos.
00:04:37,00:04:45,Do you need to have quite a big boss or presumably because is it the more it goes up the higher
00:04:45,00:04:48,"you are, or is it an inverse relationship?"
00:04:48,00:04:54,"Well, here's the problem, I didn't really read that, but it's so if we were going to go"
00:04:54,00:04:57,"on a hiking expedition next week, I'm going to have to do a bit more research."
00:04:57,00:04:59,I guess the air pressure?
00:04:59,00:05:00,It's air pressure.
00:05:00,00:05:01,Yeah.
00:05:01,00:05:02,"So, yeah."
00:05:02,00:05:06,"Wouldn't your Coke freeze at a soda and height, though?"
00:05:06,00:05:10,"Would it freeze if you're on top of Mount Everest, which is the highest mountain?"
00:05:10,00:05:11,Maybe.
00:05:11,00:05:12,What's how are they drinking?
00:05:12,00:05:14,Maybe they're taking out one of those thermoses that you carried soup in on a school trip
00:05:14,00:05:15,when you were young.
00:05:15,00:05:16,Exactly.
00:05:16,00:05:20,I can't believe you had soup in a thermos on your school trips whenever an outside sandwich
00:05:20,00:05:21,is.
00:05:21,00:05:25,"Andy, actually, an incredibly traumatising childhood memory I don't want to talk about."
00:05:25,00:05:26,It was the worst thing ever.
00:05:26,00:05:27,It's incredibly embarrassing.
00:05:27,00:05:29,It always spilled everywhere on the coach.
00:05:29,00:05:32,"No one would want to say next to me, ""God, I hate my mother."""
00:05:32,00:05:33,What was she thinking?
00:05:33,00:05:41,"This experiment, we didn't quite go into it then, I think, right?"
00:05:41,00:05:49,"So, basically, what they had was like a big, perspex circular tank with two walls, so"
00:05:49,00:05:54,"the sand dunes could go around the circumference of the circle, right, and they could kind of chase"
00:05:54,00:05:55,each other.
00:05:55,00:06:01,But the guy who did it was called Carol Batchick and he works in Cambridge University.
00:06:01,00:06:06,And the reason that he did this experiment is he was just looking at one sand dune going
00:06:06,00:06:09,"around his thing and he's thinking, ""This is boring."""
00:06:09,00:06:15,It's like taking ages to get any kind of data.
00:06:15,00:06:20,"And so, what I'm going to do is I'm going to double my capacity and put two sand dunes"
00:06:20,00:06:23,in and then I could get twice as much data.
00:06:23,00:06:24,I'm just going to do that.
00:06:24,00:06:28,"And then when he did that, it started a new experiment that he hadn't intended to do."
00:06:28,00:06:33,But what's really interesting is it's pretty much impossible to actually make a sand dune in
00:06:33,00:06:34,the lab.
00:06:34,00:06:37,"For years and years, they said it was impossible."
00:06:37,00:06:43,"This experiment gives an idea of what a sand dune might do, but of course, the difference"
00:06:43,00:06:49,between that and an actual massive meters and meters high sand dune could be quite different.
00:06:49,00:06:55,"And so, in Mongolia, in 2007, they got a bulldozer and flattened a whole lot of the desert"
00:06:55,00:07:01,and they set up an experiment to see a sand dune being made from scratch.
00:07:01,00:07:02,Wow.
00:07:02,00:07:07,"But show me, even the longest PhDs don't quite last long enough to genuinely want to sand"
00:07:07,00:07:10,"dune form from nothing and then move, do they?"
00:07:10,00:07:12,Or do they just sit in the desert for decades?
00:07:12,00:07:15,"They just sat there for decades, yeah."
00:07:15,00:07:17,"They passed it on to their children, actually."
00:07:17,00:07:18,Wow.
00:07:18,00:07:19,It's like a sourdough starter.
00:07:19,00:07:26,"Well, not unfortunately, just as it happens, what they learned was exactly what everyone"
00:07:26,00:07:30,thought would happen according to the experiments they did in the lab.
00:07:30,00:07:33,So they did all these experiments and it turned out that what happened was exactly what
00:07:33,00:07:35,"everyone thought was going to happen, which-"
00:07:35,00:07:36,That's annoying.
00:07:36,00:07:40,"Is it annoying in a way, but in another way, at least they've proven their theories are"
00:07:40,00:07:41,correct?
00:07:41,00:07:42,Yeah.
00:07:42,00:07:43,Yeah.
00:07:43,00:07:47,Did you know the second highest sand dune in Europe is in Wales?
00:07:47,00:07:48,Is it?
00:07:48,00:07:55,"That place, which is nicknamed the South Wales Sahara, it's 800 acres of sand."
00:07:55,00:07:58,"And the dune's got up to 200 feet tall, which is actually-"
00:07:58,00:07:59,That's massive.
00:07:59,00:08:00,"Yeah, yeah."
00:08:00,00:08:03,It's so sandy there that Lawrence of Arabia was partly filmed there.
00:08:03,00:08:04,Really?
00:08:04,00:08:07,"It was a stand-in for Arabia, yeah."
00:08:07,00:08:08,"The tallest ones in France, isn't it?"
00:08:08,00:08:09,I think I've been to it.
00:08:09,00:08:10,Yeah.
00:08:10,00:08:11,Have you?
00:08:11,00:08:12,Yeah.
00:08:12,00:08:13,The tallest one in Europe.
00:08:13,00:08:15,I actually have been to the tallest one in the world as well.
00:08:15,00:08:16,Wow.
00:08:16,00:08:18,"That's in Peru, I think."
00:08:18,00:08:21,And I've stand-boded on it as well.
00:08:21,00:08:22,Cool.
00:08:22,00:08:23,How do you do it?
00:08:23,00:08:24,How do you go about that?
00:08:24,00:08:29,"You pay money and they give you, they take you on a dune buggy and they do lots of tricks"
00:08:29,00:08:33,over the sand dunes and then they take you to the top of one of the biggest ones and
00:08:33,00:08:39,they put you on what is less like a snowboard and more like a tea tray and they tell you
00:08:39,00:08:44,just to go to the bottom and to make sure that you talk everything because I didn't stand
00:08:44,00:08:48,"up on it, I kind of like body-bodied down it and they tell you to hide all your limbs otherwise"
00:08:48,00:08:50,they'll get chopped off and stuff.
00:08:50,00:08:55,"It's like, sir, what environment are you going through?"
00:08:55,00:08:57,That's what they said.
00:08:57,00:09:01,"They said like, if you don't tuck your arms in then you'll probably lose them."
00:09:01,00:09:02,Wow.
00:09:02,00:09:07,I know you remember tea trays because your mum probably gave you one so that you're often
00:09:07,00:09:09,in tea on all these cool trips.
00:09:09,00:09:14,"Actually, sand duneing, what are you calling it, sandboarding?"
00:09:14,00:09:16,Sandboarding can be quite dangerous.
00:09:16,00:09:18,"Well, that's what they said."
00:09:18,00:09:25,"How many, what kind of injuries and you lose your arms and legs, I told you."
00:09:25,00:09:28,"You can, obviously, by fine that when you get to the bottom of the sand dune then all"
00:09:28,00:09:33,"your limbs have chopped off, but you can find this is incredibly rare."
00:09:33,00:09:38,They didn't know it could happen until 2013 but you can just fall into one.
00:09:38,00:09:42,"So, do you read this extraordinary story?"
00:09:42,00:09:47,"No, obviously not, otherwise I wouldn't have gone sandboarding."
00:09:47,00:09:52,This oven in 2013 is in a place called Mount Bulldy which is on the side of Lake Michigan
00:09:52,00:09:55,in Indiana and it's a huge sand dune.
00:09:55,00:09:59,It's a 126 feet tall and it swallowed a boy.
00:09:59,00:10:04,"I'm just going to say right now, just so everyone's not traumatised, the boy ended up"
00:10:04,00:10:05,okay.
00:10:05,00:10:10,"But, he was running up at the top of the sand dune with his mate and his dad to then run"
00:10:10,00:10:15,down it or do James' trick and suddenly he disappeared and his dad looked around and
00:10:15,00:10:19,he'd gone and his friend said he just fell into the sand and got swallowed.
00:10:19,00:10:24,"I mean, you would, even if you're not done, you would immediately think Mongolian death"
00:10:24,00:10:25,"worm, wouldn't you?"
00:10:25,00:10:31,"So, that was the conclusion they all jumped to and they spent weeks looking into that to"
00:10:31,00:10:32,no avail.
00:10:32,00:10:38,"No, this is amazing, bizarrely by chance there was a geologist who was walking by and she"
00:10:38,00:10:42,"saw dozens of people on the side of this sand dune just digging away in the sand saying,"
00:10:42,00:10:45,"this just swallowed a small boy, we need to get him out."
00:10:45,00:10:49,"And one of the people, they heard the boys say from deep within the dune, ""Help me, I'm"
00:10:49,00:10:50,"scared."""
00:10:50,00:10:54,"And this geologist was like, that is rubbish, that's totally impossible and she just walked"
00:10:54,00:10:55,"on, went home."
00:10:55,00:11:00,"Even though she heard the child, she didn't, no, no, no, she didn't hear the child, she"
00:11:00,00:11:05,"just got told by the people digging, she thought, no, that kid's just playing hide and seek."
00:11:05,00:11:10,"Anyway, it turned out they saw these tiny little holes in the sand that kind of went through"
00:11:10,00:11:13,and it seemed that they were leading towards some massive cavity underneath it which she
00:11:13,00:11:18,just dropped into and then I got immediately covered up and they excavated and excavated
00:11:18,00:11:23,"after three and a half hours, they managed to find him hidden in a cavity in the sand dune"
00:11:23,00:11:31,12 feet underground and he was unconscious and like really cold and he spent a couple of weeks
00:11:31,00:11:37,in hospital and amazingly recovered but they had no idea why sand dune shouldn't swallow
00:11:37,00:11:42,anyone up and this geologist hated herself so much for not believing it had happened
00:11:42,00:11:43,at the time.
00:11:43,00:11:49,"She's then led this amazing study, she's called Erin Argyllan and she's found out that it's"
00:11:49,00:11:54,from hollowed out trees so the sand dune is galloped along as they do and it's galloped
00:11:54,00:12:00,over these old trees have rotted then from the inside and been encrusted with fungus
00:12:00,00:12:05,so it's just got these tubes so it's got these weird channels leading down from it but they
00:12:05,00:12:10,"don't, you can't see the openings in the in the surface so it looks like nothing."
00:12:10,00:12:12,"Wow, that's really cool."
00:12:12,00:12:13,Don't sound awful.
00:12:13,00:12:18,There's another thing that they might swallow apart from six-year-old boys which is there
00:12:18,00:12:26,"was a city built in Tunisia for Star Wars and not the original Star Wars films, I'm talking"
00:12:26,00:12:31,"episode one, The Phantom Menace, the true original but in 2013 there were lots of news reports"
00:12:31,00:12:35,"and I haven't annoyingly, I haven't found what happened after these reports but it's"
00:12:35,00:12:39,reported that that location city built for The Phantom Menace which is called Moss Esper
00:12:39,00:12:45,in the movie was about to be buried by a giant crescent-shaped sand dune and this was really
00:12:45,00:12:49,"good news actually, not only because it removed evidence of the Phantom Menace from the"
00:12:49,00:12:59,"city else, also because it was hard for scientists to measure sand dune movement because it's"
00:12:59,00:13:03,very hard to find a fixed measurement point because it's a nightmare when you're in
00:13:03,00:13:07,the desert you think oh well is this moved 50 meters or has it not moved at all?
00:13:07,00:13:10,We don't know because there's nothing else here apart from more sand but this was obviously
00:13:10,00:13:12,very useful because it was fixed in the ground.
00:13:12,00:13:17,And they could kind of look at where it is and compare it to the movie and say okay on
00:13:17,00:13:23,this date it was in front of this part of Star Wars in the first and then it was here but
00:13:23,00:13:26,they would have to watch The Phantom Menace though to do that.
00:13:26,00:13:28,That's true and no scientist has been found.
00:13:28,00:13:30,Yeah that's a PhD but you really don't want to do.
00:13:30,00:13:36,I'd rather stand in the Mongolian desert for 20 years.
00:13:36,00:13:42,One of the famous things about sand dunes is that they make this singing noise and Marco Polo
00:13:42,00:13:47,wrote about it in the 13th century he said that he heard eerie sounds coming from the sand dunes
00:13:47,00:13:52,around him and that the logical conclusion was that he must be in the presence of evil
00:13:52,00:13:53,spirits.
00:13:53,00:13:54,Wow cool.
00:13:54,00:13:57,But it has to be really specific sand doesn't it?
00:13:57,00:14:00,You can't get on any old sand dune there aren't actually many in the world that do it
00:14:00,00:14:04,but it's got to be a very fine type of sand and I think it's the same sort of mechanism
00:14:04,00:14:09,that you get on some beaches where the sand really squeaks and I've never really had this
00:14:09,00:14:15,before because in Britain we have beaches that I love but that are objectively quite crappy.
00:14:15,00:14:19,So I'd never seen it before until I went to visit Bruni Island off the coast of Tasmania
00:14:19,00:14:23,at Christmas and there every time you put your foot down it sort of shrieks at you like
00:14:23,00:14:25,it's hurt you feel kind of bad for it.
00:14:25,00:14:30,Yeah it is weird creaky floorboard sounds isn't it as you're walking along so you can't
00:14:30,00:14:34,sneak up on someone on a beach it's actually a very good mechanism to throw.
00:14:34,00:14:40,That's why you moved here isn't it down because you just kept getting caught in Australia.
00:14:40,00:14:45,We've been giving sand dunes very mixed messages in this country lately because we've been
00:14:45,00:14:51,trying to get them to stop moving for years and building fences around them and people sometimes
00:14:51,00:14:56,cover them in oil which is very unpleasant which should like ways them down and we plant
00:14:56,00:15:00,lots of vegetation on them so if you go to the coast you'll see vegetation planted and
00:15:00,00:15:03,"suddenly conservationists have turned around and said oh hold on, sand dunes are supposed"
00:15:03,00:15:04,to move.
00:15:04,00:15:10,This is like kind of nailing a horse to the floor and so now we're talking which is and they
00:15:10,00:15:15,don't do that because horses are supposed to move and so now we're trying to get sand dunes
00:15:15,00:15:20,moving again and the national lottery is given 4 million pounds to get sand dunes moving
00:15:20,00:15:21,again.
00:15:21,00:15:22,Wow.
00:15:22,00:15:27,They've set up a new app haven't they the couch to five metres.
00:15:27,00:15:34,"Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is James."
00:15:34,00:15:39,Okay my fat this week is that according to a recent publication people from the north
00:15:39,00:15:44,of England are more than twice as likely to be naturally funny than people from the south
00:15:44,00:15:46,of England.
00:15:46,00:15:50,Sounds like a very scientific publication who conducted this.
00:15:50,00:15:52,Oh I didn't write that down.
00:15:52,00:16:03,I probably was it nature or I can't remember it was the b-no it was the comic for b-no but
00:16:03,00:16:07,who knows comedy better than the people who write the b-no that's what I want to know.
00:16:07,00:16:08,Absolutely.
00:16:08,00:16:09,Absolutely.
00:16:09,00:16:11,So what were the details of the study?
00:16:11,00:16:14,They were scant.
00:16:14,00:16:20,It was the analysis of famous British comedians carried out by statistician Dr Jeff Ellis and
00:16:20,00:16:26,he looked at all the different comedians and what their particular attributes are and
00:16:26,00:16:31,then he surveyed people to say how funny do you think these people are and I think thanks
00:16:31,00:16:35,to the fact that Peter K comes from the north of England and people like Peter K when
00:16:35,00:16:40,we came at the top and you guys are all not as funny.
00:16:40,00:16:41,Yeah.
00:16:41,00:16:45,Didn't he also say that a gem in eyes are more naturally funny than Leo's?
00:16:45,00:16:47,I didn't read that bit because I'm not a gem in eye.
00:16:47,00:16:52,I only cherry picks the bits that specifically said good things about me.
00:16:52,00:16:53,Ah okay.
00:16:53,00:16:57,I think there's a study to also say that and can I just say as a Leo from the south of England
00:16:57,00:17:01,I'm just honoured to be here.
00:17:01,00:17:05,People who are born in a city are supposed to be funny and you were born in London.
00:17:05,00:17:06,I was.
00:17:06,00:17:09,Is that again is that a causing to apparently professional statistician Jeff Ellis who
00:17:09,00:17:13,must be questioning where his career's gone right now?
00:17:13,00:17:20,The Bino is pretty dry these days if they're having to resort to statistical analysis.
00:17:20,00:17:22,We should quickly say there'll be a lot of international listeners who might not know
00:17:22,00:17:24,what the Bino is.
00:17:24,00:17:30,This is the longest running comic in the UK and it is famous for having created Dennis
00:17:30,00:17:36,"the Menace, the British one, not the American one and there has a sort of sister publication"
00:17:36,00:17:41,called Dandy that has desperate Dan and so a lot of iconic British characters came out
00:17:41,00:17:42,of this.
00:17:42,00:17:48,"It was named after you walking along a beach, wasn't it?"
00:17:48,00:17:52,Depraved Dan was the character's original name.
00:17:52,00:17:59,Deported Dan after Daniel and I was caught.
00:17:59,00:18:03,You mentioned desperate Dan in the very olden days so it feels right that we're correcting
00:18:03,00:18:04,the balance now.
00:18:04,00:18:07,I think he had to give our beating cow pie didn't he?
00:18:07,00:18:08,Oh yeah.
00:18:08,00:18:13,We all have a friend who used to work on the Bino until quite recently.
00:18:13,00:18:14,Really?
00:18:14,00:18:19,"Matthew Heighton, comedian, excellent comedian, I should say, also from the north of England"
00:18:19,00:18:20,very funny guy.
00:18:20,00:18:26,He used to work for the Bino and he's still part of the Bino WhatsApp group where everyone
00:18:26,00:18:31,sends each other messages about the Bino and I asked him if they had any facts and so do
00:18:31,00:18:34,you want to hear some facts from the Bino WhatsApp group?
00:18:34,00:18:40,So the Bino offices in London are on Fleet Street and it is where people believe that
00:18:40,00:18:46,Swini Todd was supposedly had his barbershop and so they get loads of tours of people who
00:18:46,00:18:51,"want to see the kind of dodgy, murdery parts of London always go to the Bino offices and"
00:18:51,00:18:52,have a look around.
00:18:52,00:18:56,"They don't go into the offices, they go into like the alleys next to the office because"
00:18:56,00:18:57,that's amazing.
00:18:57,00:18:58,Swini Todd supposedly feels.
00:18:58,00:19:01,"They're one of the biggest pranksters of all time, Swini Todd."
00:19:01,00:19:06,"Well, he didn't have cow pies but he did have people pies, didn't he, I guess."
00:19:06,00:19:11,"Yeah, probably the inspiration for desperate Dan, who knows."
00:19:11,00:19:15,"I found out in my Bino research, niche fact that definitely international listeners weren't"
00:19:15,00:19:21,"care about, which is the breed of dog that Nasha is because if you look at Nasha, he's just"
00:19:21,00:19:26,sort of like a big frizzy lump of black with some legs sticking out and he's actually
00:19:26,00:19:33,a very rare breed. He's an Abyssinian wirehead of tri-pound and he's a very rare breed of dog
00:19:33,00:19:37,"from the mountains of Eastern Africa, according to the Bino website."
00:19:37,00:19:41,They're world famous for their thick black coats which are as strong and tangled as barbed
00:19:41,00:19:46,"wire, which is weird because barbed wire actually when it's erected is not tangled at all."
00:19:46,00:19:48,But they're also famous for their strong.
00:19:48,00:19:49,The bar bits are.
00:19:49,00:19:50,Yeah.
00:19:50,00:19:51,I suppose bits of it are.
00:19:51,00:19:52,"You're right, the bar bits are, aren't they?"
00:19:52,00:19:53,"Sorry, Anna."
00:19:53,00:19:54,Are you just being silly?
00:19:54,00:19:55,"This isn't a real kind of dog, is it?"
00:19:55,00:19:59,"Of course it is, they're also famous for their strong teeth that can chew through concrete"
00:19:59,00:20:00,and smash bricks.
00:20:00,00:20:06,"Did you know that Nasha can speak real people words, but only on Halloween."
00:20:06,00:20:07,Oh.
00:20:07,00:20:10,"Again, well, this breed of dog is particularly famous for that."
00:20:10,00:20:13,They are extremely rare now.
00:20:13,00:20:17,"The American Dennis Menace, we've mentioned before, the beautiful coincidence that they both"
00:20:17,00:20:19,appeared at the same time.
00:20:19,00:20:24,These two characters with the same name and both wear red and black costume.
00:20:24,00:20:29,"And American Dennis the Menace, I was looking into how he came about his origin story."
00:20:29,00:20:34,"And he was actually inspired by, this is the story that's told in 1950 when the artist"
00:20:34,00:20:40,"Ketchum was drawing, his wife came in to interrupt him to say that their own four-year-old son,"
00:20:40,00:20:46,"Dennis, had just demolished their bedroom by putting fecal matter that he'd found in his"
00:20:46,00:20:50,underpants all over the room and declared him a menace.
00:20:50,00:20:54,"And so he thought, oh, that sounds like a good character name."
00:20:54,00:20:59,So he went healthy clean up the shit off the walls and then created Dennis the Menace.
00:20:59,00:21:04,Because there was a song a few years before both of these characters came along that was
00:21:04,00:21:07,quite popular called Dennis the Menace from Venice.
00:21:07,00:21:11,And most people think that the reason that they came at the same time is because they were
00:21:11,00:21:14,"both inspired by this song, which had become popular."
00:21:14,00:21:18,"But the poo on the wall story is quite persuasive, so it might do that."
00:21:18,00:21:21,"The poo on the wall story also features in the music called song, doesn't it?"
00:21:21,00:21:24,So I think it might take the same trajectory.
00:21:24,00:21:28,I think the creators of the British version of Dennis said that he was inspired by that
00:21:28,00:21:30,musical song.
00:21:30,00:21:33,"And actually, I looked up the lyrics to this song, although I can't find the melody"
00:21:33,00:21:35,and I really want it.
00:21:35,00:21:39,Dennis the Menace from Venice is a gay gondolier with gold rings in his ears.
00:21:39,00:21:42,And he's a massive player.
00:21:42,00:21:48,So the whole song is about how he's this gondolier who seduces other men's wives down the canals
00:21:48,00:21:49,of Venice.
00:21:49,00:21:53,"And the nine in the evening, he dines with a blonde at 10, he has got a brunette."
00:21:53,00:21:57,"At midnight, you'll find him with some ginger gal, and he teaches them all how to pet."
00:21:57,00:22:03,"Well, it's a bit like mumbo number five, doesn't it?"
00:22:03,00:22:09,Another song which originally ended up with the protagonist smearing his poo on over the
00:22:09,00:22:10,walls.
00:22:10,00:22:16,"Mumbo number two, they had to rename it in the name."
00:22:16,00:22:20,"There was, it's obviously a lot of the humour in the Bino is really lavatorial, and there"
00:22:20,00:22:28,was a plan in 2017 to do a Bino takeover at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.
00:22:28,00:22:33,"And what they wanted to do was amend the, they've got a cast of Michelangelo's David there,"
00:22:33,00:22:37,and they wanted to tweak it so that it would fart as people pass by.
00:22:37,00:22:41,And I can't find any evidence that it happened because there was fury in the museum that there
00:22:41,00:22:45,"was going to be, there was actually genuinely irritating to people."
00:22:45,00:22:49,"And one, there was a memo doing the rounds about the plans, and somebody replied and inside"
00:22:49,00:22:54,"it from the museum said, ""Frankly, some of the things in the memo are disgusting while it's"
00:22:54,00:22:59,"important to encourage children to visit farting statues are not the way to do it."""
00:22:59,00:23:10,"So Bino launched in 1938, and there's not many copies left of the original issue, but"
00:23:10,00:23:15,"by weird coincidence, I saw one the other day, a friend of mine, yeah, called Oli Driscoll."
00:23:15,00:23:20,"He's a cameraman for, he works on movies like the latest Jurassic Park movies and touching"
00:23:20,00:23:23,the void and the fast and furious movies.
00:23:23,00:23:29,"Back in 1999, he bought the Bino first issue for 6,000 pounds."
00:23:29,00:23:34,"And as far as he knows, it's the only issue that has the toy, that it came with the free"
00:23:34,00:23:35,"toy, which was a mask."
00:23:35,00:23:39,"Oh my God, he has, you know the guy who has that."
00:23:39,00:23:44,"Yeah, he hasn't shown it to me, yeah, and he hasn't in mint condition and he's up for selling"
00:23:44,00:23:45,it.
00:23:45,00:23:48,"So if anyone wants to buy a very expensive comic book magazine, he's got it for sale."
00:23:48,00:23:52,"Dan, I'm really interested because I read a bit about that thing and it said that it came,"
00:23:52,00:23:57,"it said the toy that it came with, it called it a woopie mask, and I obviously only know"
00:23:57,00:24:03,"the woopie cushion, but presumably this is not a mask where someone has to sit on your"
00:24:03,00:24:04,face.
00:24:04,00:24:09,"I don't know, I think maybe woopie, is it possible?"
00:24:09,00:24:11,Woopie had a different meaning to it back then.
00:24:11,00:24:12,I think it didn't far.
00:24:12,00:24:15,I've seen a picture and I can't see where they would have got the farting mechanism into
00:24:15,00:24:16,it.
00:24:16,00:24:17,It's very flat.
00:24:17,00:24:18,Glasses.
00:24:18,00:24:19,Yeah.
00:24:19,00:24:21,Do you know what the oldest comic strip in the world is about?
00:24:21,00:24:22,No.
00:24:22,00:24:26,This is what's established recently is the oldest of Weston comic book.
00:24:26,00:24:30,"And by comic book, it's like something that's mass-produced and it has speech bubbles and"
00:24:30,00:24:32,"it released every week, every couple of weeks."
00:24:32,00:24:37,It's called Looking Glass and it ran for three editions and it was the adventures of
00:24:37,00:24:40,a coat being worn by different people.
00:24:40,00:24:44,"Is it about that there's a go-goal story about the coat, isn't there?"
00:24:44,00:24:45,The overcoat.
00:24:45,00:24:46,All the great thing.
00:24:46,00:24:47,"Yeah, the other coat."
00:24:47,00:24:48,The other coat.
00:24:48,00:24:49,It was not based on a go-goal story.
00:24:49,00:24:50,It was pre-that.
00:24:50,00:24:51,It was 1825.
00:24:51,00:24:52,Wow.
00:24:52,00:24:54,Maybe go-goal based his story on the comic.
00:24:54,00:24:56,On his dream of a coat.
00:24:56,00:25:01,I just can't imagine two people had the same idea about doing a story about an overcoat.
00:25:01,00:25:02,You're right.
00:25:02,00:25:03,"Well, we don't know this one was an overcoat."
00:25:03,00:25:04,It might have been an undercoat.
00:25:04,00:25:05,No.
00:25:05,00:25:06,It was just a coat.
00:25:06,00:25:07,What is an undercoat?
00:25:07,00:25:08,I don't know.
00:25:08,00:25:10,It's just something I made up that would be the opposite of an overcoat.
00:25:10,00:25:15,"Anyway, it was, it had a character's like Billy the Bullie and Ranting Dan."
00:25:15,00:25:17,"And this was, you know, 200 years ago."
00:25:17,00:25:22,"Dan, you're getting an absolute pasting in it."
00:25:22,00:25:28,"Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is Anna."
00:25:28,00:25:34,"My fact this week is that in 1943, German troops who were rescuing Mussolini had to seize"
00:25:34,00:25:39,"control of a tourist, finicular railway, so they could ride a cable car to the top of"
00:25:39,00:25:41,the hill and pick him up.
00:25:41,00:25:42,So cool.
00:25:42,00:25:45,What an awkward journey in that finicular railway cable car.
00:25:45,00:25:50,It must have been with the two elderly tourists and the 20 Nazi goons who refused to budge
00:25:50,00:25:51,and get out of it.
00:25:51,00:25:55,"No, we paid for our ride and we will damn well take it."
00:25:55,00:25:58,So what was he doing at the top of the hill on that?
00:25:58,00:25:59,That's a good question.
00:25:59,00:26:00,He was just hanging out there.
00:26:00,00:26:02,So I didn't know this had happened.
00:26:02,00:26:07,But when Mussolini was deposed by his own people because they finally realised that he was
00:26:07,00:26:14,"shit in every way in 1943, he was a reservoir's own council and they sort of took him prisoner"
00:26:14,00:26:18,and they moved him around to a lot of different places and then eventually they plopped him
00:26:18,00:26:25,at the top of the Grand Saso d'Italia which has a lot of very high mountains in the Appanines.
00:26:25,00:26:31,"And it's only reachable by cable car and Hitler was a fan of Mussolini, heard about this,"
00:26:31,00:26:35,asked out where he was and ordered this rescue operation.
00:26:35,00:26:40,And so in order to rescue the plan was send some troops there and pick him up.
00:26:40,00:26:45,And so the other had to seize this cable car just because they go quite slowly cable cars
00:26:45,00:26:46,at the best of times.
00:26:46,00:26:50,"And I reckon in 1943 very slowly, imagine the rush and the frenzy."
00:26:50,00:26:51,Yeah.
00:26:51,00:26:56,So it's a finicular cable car which is where they have the two counterbalances.
00:26:56,00:27:00,"So they'll have two cable cars, one on one side and one on the other."
00:27:00,00:27:03,"But it was a crazy operation, this Mussolini rescue."
00:27:03,00:27:10,It was part cable car based and mostly glider based and so the plan was for these ten tiny
00:27:10,00:27:15,little glider planes to land on the top of this mountain which they'd sort of done some
00:27:15,00:27:18,reconnaissance on and thought they'd seen a big meadow they could land on which turned
00:27:18,00:27:21,out to be a massive rocky field.
00:27:21,00:27:27,"So they all crash landed, some of them were quite badly injured, ran in to pick up Mussolini."
00:27:27,00:27:31,And one of the SS commandos apparently vomited inside his glider which made it very unpleasant
00:27:31,00:27:34,to shovel in for the rest of them.
00:27:34,00:27:39,They were so flimsy these tiny little gliders and the pilots were so nervous about it because
00:27:39,00:27:42,of that that one of the pilots in one he couldn't see out the window because it was really
00:27:42,00:27:48,blurry so he got a knife out and he just jammed a hole in the fuselage so he could look
00:27:48,00:27:53,out and then pushed a bit the fuselage out so he could look out with a plane.
00:27:53,00:27:54,And then they picked him up.
00:27:54,00:27:59,They sort of and they sort of gave him up quite sort of okay take him that's fine like no
00:27:59,00:28:03,bullets were fired it was a and Mussolini requested that as well.
00:28:03,00:28:08,He said please no one no one shoots and yeah it was quite a peaceful operation.
00:28:08,00:28:10,And they didn't get him out by the finicular did they?
00:28:10,00:28:14,He no they were there was an idea to get him out by a finicular so they were planning
00:28:14,00:28:19,to land a plane at the bottom of the finicular that he could just board but the plane crash
00:28:19,00:28:24,landed and lost a wheel on landing so instead they got him out by a small light aircraft
00:28:24,00:28:29,from the top of the mountain and they got it okay which also sounds crazy and your wife
00:28:29,00:28:34,the pilot so maybe she could say how unstable this is but they were terrified about leaving
00:28:34,00:28:38,because it was a really light aircraft and it was overcrowded to the extent that Mussolini
00:28:38,00:28:42,was six foot four massive guy sat in the passenger seat and then the guy who was in charge
00:28:42,00:28:47,of the operation captain scores any was wedged in the luggage compartment behind an underneath
00:28:47,00:28:54,seat and way too heavy so it like career down this hill bonked down this hill which wasn't
00:28:54,00:28:59,the kind of surface they wanted and then did a nose dive off the edge of a precipice
00:28:59,00:29:04,and they only survived because the pilot realized that he'd have to leave it in freefall for
00:29:04,00:29:09,a while so in order to get up the requisite speed he could then pull the plane up and start
00:29:09,00:29:10,flying it away.
00:29:10,00:29:15,Mussolini was bad dude I think we can all agree.
00:29:15,00:29:21,He was also a British spy for some time yeah he was hired by the British in 1917 and he
00:29:21,00:29:26,was given a wage by MI5 to help keep Italy fighting in the war because in the first war they
00:29:26,00:29:31,"were on the same side as the British and that was about £6,000 a week so you know he owes"
00:29:31,00:29:33,a lot of his early success to MI5.
00:29:33,00:29:35,That's a huge amount of money.
00:29:35,00:29:38,Yeah I said modern day that much was that much at the time.
00:29:38,00:29:39,Modern day that much.
00:29:39,00:29:43,"Yeah it was £100 a weekly wage at the time which is about £6,000 now."
00:29:43,00:29:44,Okay.
00:29:44,00:29:51,"You have to buy a secondhand car or well you know what £6,000 you don't even eat it."
00:29:51,00:29:56,You can buy the first edition of the Beno for that back in 1999.
00:29:56,00:29:57,Terrible news.
00:29:57,00:30:00,Italy has dropped out of the war but I did secure this.
00:30:00,00:30:05,Check out my whirpy mask guys.
00:30:05,00:30:09,I think we've briefly mentioned before that his son Romano was a jazz musician.
00:30:09,00:30:10,Yes.
00:30:10,00:30:12,And a famous jazz musician more or less in his own right.
00:30:12,00:30:17,I just wanted to add on I found a memorial article about him in the Atlantic and the headline
00:30:17,00:30:20,was he made the refrains run on time.
00:30:20,00:30:21,Oh nice.
00:30:21,00:30:22,I'm funniculous.
00:30:22,00:30:23,Yeah.
00:30:23,00:30:24,Yeah.
00:30:24,00:30:25,Oh great.
00:30:25,00:30:28,I made a list of all the funniculars I've been on as part of my research.
00:30:28,00:30:29,Great.
00:30:29,00:30:30,How many?
00:30:30,00:30:31,And I've been on.
00:30:31,00:30:35,Well only six is not enough but one of them was closed when I visited it so it would
00:30:35,00:30:36,have been seven.
00:30:36,00:30:40,So can you just quickly re-explain for maybe some of the audience listening to this show
00:30:40,00:30:44,"who might not understand what a funnicula is, what it is?"
00:30:44,00:30:45,Sorry to do that.
00:30:45,00:30:47,We obviously all know.
00:30:47,00:30:54,"So it's a little railway which is the normally they're designed to go up and down very, very"
00:30:54,00:30:55,steep hills.
00:30:55,00:31:01,"So if you've got a very steep mountain side, it's a great way of getting up and down there"
00:31:01,00:31:05,with not too much without going round and round the houses.
00:31:05,00:31:07,So it's a direct line.
00:31:07,00:31:11,And usually one car is ascending while the other is descending.
00:31:11,00:31:12,So there are two.
00:31:12,00:31:16,And sometimes there's just one line and the cars are going towards each other and they're
00:31:16,00:31:20,"about to hit each other and then just at the very middle of the line, the line branches"
00:31:20,00:31:23,off into two and they go around each other and then use the same line again.
00:31:23,00:31:24,That's a very efficient way of doing it.
00:31:24,00:31:29,And the reason they're really useful is because you're using the weight of one of your
00:31:29,00:31:31,trains to pull the other one up.
00:31:31,00:31:36,"So as one is descending, it's pulling the other one up so you need a lot less energy."
00:31:36,00:31:39,That's the crucial thing about them is the counterbalancing and they still use a little
00:31:39,00:31:43,motor so they still need to be able to pull themselves up the hill but it's so much
00:31:43,00:31:44,counterbalancing.
00:31:44,00:31:49,So they're using basically the potential energy of one to pull up the other one.
00:31:49,00:31:55,"But like Anna says, you do need some, it's not a completely perfect system of amateur"
00:31:55,00:31:56,motion.
00:31:56,00:31:59,So you need a little leg up.
00:31:59,00:32:04,Apparently sometimes you can make them move just by having enough people in the cabin.
00:32:04,00:32:08,"If you crush enough slightly overweight people in, it can just weigh it's way down."
00:32:08,00:32:12,So that's an insulting moment when you step into a funicular.
00:32:12,00:32:14,"And finally they're like, thank God we've got them."
00:32:14,00:32:15,OK.
00:32:15,00:32:21,It's like I was once in television studios in London and there was a lot of people in the
00:32:21,00:32:24,lift and I needed to get in the lift as well.
00:32:24,00:32:29,"And I got in and as soon as I walked in it started beeping and said, sorry, too much weight"
00:32:29,00:32:30,in this lift.
00:32:30,00:32:34,So I had to walk out and get the stairs while everyone else got the lift.
00:32:34,00:32:36,"Yeah, that's all good."
00:32:36,00:32:38,"That's very unfair, but it's just because you were the last one in."
00:32:38,00:32:42,It's only really insulting if you get in and the guy who's running a lift has alright
00:32:42,00:32:46,"people, you six people are going to have to be a little afraid."
00:32:46,00:32:47,I was once on an aeroplane.
00:32:47,00:32:52,"I don't know if I've said this before, but I got an aeroplane and I think it was in Hawaii"
00:32:52,00:32:53,or somewhere.
00:32:53,00:32:58,It was somewhere where it's a small aeroplane and they made the move to counterbalance the
00:32:58,00:33:04,"weight of the plane and said, excuse me Sarah, can you, can you set over the wings?"
00:33:04,00:33:09,"I'm not particularly overweight, man, you know, it's like, Andy, I want to know the"
00:33:09,00:33:13,"last time you went into a lift that there was a man running it, or all the lifts."
00:33:13,00:33:18,I only go into a lift which has an operative.
00:33:18,00:33:22,"Yeah, it would have been longer ago than the last time I was in a finicular, which was in"
00:33:22,00:33:23,Hastings last year.
00:33:23,00:33:27,"You know, when you said you've been in six finiculars, does that include going up and going"
00:33:27,00:33:28,down as separate ones?
00:33:28,00:33:37,"Oh, okay, if we don't know, I've been in 12 finiculars."
00:33:37,00:33:39,I find them kind of weirdly lovely.
00:33:39,00:33:44,"Again, I'm a bit of a finicular obsessive, not that much, because I've only been in 12/6,"
00:33:44,00:33:45,but...
00:33:45,00:33:47,"Furnicular and moss, they're your two loves, aren't they, Andy?"
00:33:47,00:33:48,"Pretty sad, isn't it?"
00:33:48,00:33:56,"If you imagine a finicular overgrown with moss, and that would be my dream."
00:33:56,00:34:02,"But they are very cool, and I find them quite weird, because obviously they're only usual"
00:34:02,00:34:04,in very hilly or mountainous places.
00:34:04,00:34:08,"And so you get loads of them in seaside resorts, like Scarborough has five."
00:34:08,00:34:09,Really?
00:34:09,00:34:12,"Yeah, or it has had five at various different points."
00:34:12,00:34:13,Hastings has two.
00:34:13,00:34:16,Do you guys know the song about finiculars?
00:34:16,00:34:17,No.
00:34:17,00:34:18,Really famous one.
00:34:18,00:34:22,"Furnicular, from the 1880s."
00:34:22,00:34:23,Are you cool?
00:34:23,00:34:24,Are you cool?
00:34:24,00:34:25,No.
00:34:25,00:34:27,You would know it.
00:34:27,00:34:29,"If you heard it, you would know it for sure."
00:34:29,00:34:37,It's like a really famous Italian song that like...
00:34:37,00:34:39,"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:34:39,00:34:46,"Furnicular, finicular, finicular, finicular, finicular, finicular, finicular, finicular, so it's really,"
00:34:46,00:34:48,really famous in the 1880s.
00:34:48,00:34:54,"And Richard Strauss was on holiday in Italy, and he heard this song, and he thought, because"
00:34:54,00:34:57,"it's such an absolute banger of a tune, isn't it?"
00:34:57,00:35:02,"He thought that this must be like a really old, like, classical Italian song, and so he put"
00:35:02,00:35:07,"it in one of his compositions, and then the guy who actually wrote it, who was living in"
00:35:07,00:35:10,"Italy, heard this, and he was like, ""That's my song."
00:35:10,00:35:11,"What's going on?"""
00:35:11,00:35:19,"And so he sued Richard Strauss for the money for his song, and he won as well, and as far"
00:35:19,00:35:24,"as I can see, it's like one of the oldest examples of someone suing for someone stealing"
00:35:24,00:35:25,their songs.
00:35:25,00:35:26,Wow.
00:35:26,00:35:27,Isn't that cool?
00:35:27,00:35:28,That's amazing.
00:35:28,00:35:31,Jim Ireland has one cable car.
00:35:31,00:35:32,Just a one.
00:35:32,00:35:33,Just a one.
00:35:33,00:35:35,Just a one cable car.
00:35:35,00:35:41,"It takes people from Cork to Dursy Island, which is just off the coast of Cork, and it's"
00:35:41,00:35:47,"the only way of getting to the island, and there was outcry a few years ago, when it was"
00:35:47,00:35:51,announced that no longer was the cable car allowed to be used to transport cows.
00:35:51,00:35:57,"This is actually a serious problem, because a lot of the Dursy Island industry, which"
00:35:57,00:36:01,"admittedly is quite small, I think it only now has two permanent residents."
00:36:01,00:36:06,"A lot of the industry is quite cow-based, quite cattle-based, and the cable car is tiny."
00:36:06,00:36:08,It can fit one cow.
00:36:08,00:36:15,"So when they were moving cows over, the farmers, you just were moving the cows across."
00:36:15,00:36:18,"The farmers would have to put them one at a time, and this one cable car, there were great"
00:36:18,00:36:24,"pictures of them just embarking, and then would they have to sometimes put the cow across,"
00:36:24,00:36:30,"but then send some call and back, and then put a chicken back in and send that back."
00:36:30,00:36:34,"There were so many awkward trial runs where the chicken was dead, the cow was dead and"
00:36:34,00:36:35,they could only block them.
00:36:35,00:36:36,That's so amazing.
00:36:36,00:36:37,It's just one thing.
00:36:37,00:36:38,It's really cool.
00:36:38,00:36:39,Surely you could squeeze it.
00:36:39,00:36:41,You could go and lie on top of the cow.
00:36:41,00:36:42,"Man, it's pretty small."
00:36:42,00:36:48,"You could maybe squeeze in an Italian fascist, but that's not true."
00:36:48,00:36:52,I've got a new favourite cable car as a result of researching this fact.
00:36:52,00:36:53,It's a cable car.
00:36:53,00:36:56,I want to know what your old favourite cable car was.
00:36:56,00:37:00,"My old favourite one was the one I got in Hong Kong, which took you across mountain ranges"
00:37:00,00:37:06,"to go to Ocean Park, which we used to get most of my childhood, astonishing cable car."
00:37:06,00:37:11,"But that's been superseded by a mountain cable car in South Germany, which takes you to"
00:37:11,00:37:14,the top of a mountain called the Wank.
00:37:14,00:37:15,I've been there.
00:37:15,00:37:16,You've been to the Wank?
00:37:16,00:37:17,Of course.
00:37:17,00:37:20,So you've been on the Wank Barn?
00:37:20,00:37:21,I have been.
00:37:21,00:37:25,I have watched ski jumping at the Wank mountain.
00:37:25,00:37:31,"And I've watched Andreas Wank, the ski jumper, jumping at the Wank mountain."
00:37:31,00:37:32,I think it's right.
00:37:32,00:37:35,"It's next to Garmish Heart and Care, can I think?"
00:37:35,00:37:36,"Yes, that's correct."
00:37:36,00:37:40,"So, yeah, so to get to the top of it, if you want to take the quick way, you get the"
00:37:40,00:37:45,Wank Barn and the Wank Barn leads you to the top and there's a Wank house at the top
00:37:45,00:37:46,as well.
00:37:46,00:37:50,"And I just say, then, the Wank Barn sounds like the disgusting sequel to the song ""Love"
00:37:50,00:37:51,"Shack."""
00:37:51,00:38:02,It's a little no place where you can get together with yourself.
00:38:02,00:38:04,"Yeah, so yeah."
00:38:04,00:38:08,"And also, if you go regularly, you can get a Wank pass, which gets you a sort of year-round"
00:38:08,00:38:11,permit to get the cable car.
00:38:11,00:38:12,Wow.
00:38:12,00:38:14,"It's a pretty rough place to clean, isn't it?"
00:38:14,00:38:17,That is cool cleaning stuff.
00:38:17,00:38:24,"Coincidentally, I'm banned from all six of the funiculars I've been on, but not the other"
00:38:24,00:38:25,six.
00:38:25,00:38:35,"OK, it's time for our final factor, the show and that is Andy."
00:38:35,00:38:39,"My effect is that, in medieval Germany, bad musicians were tied to an instrument called"
00:38:39,00:38:41,the flute of shame.
00:38:41,00:38:47,"That doesn't sound like much of a, I mean, was it a massive flute or..."
00:38:47,00:38:50,"It was, it was a flute."
00:38:50,00:38:52,I think everyone knew it was the flute of shame.
00:38:52,00:38:53,OK.
00:38:53,00:38:54,"And that's, as always, that's where the shame comes from."
00:38:54,00:39:02,"And so it's called the Shandflood, or Shandflood, and so this is, it was a metal device with"
00:39:02,00:39:04,"a collar at the neck, so it was clamped onto you."
00:39:04,00:39:11,"And your fingers would supposedly be clamped at the keys, not really a flute, more of a clarinet."
00:39:11,00:39:16,"I've written, I've written flournet in my notes, which I like, but that's just a mistake."
00:39:16,00:39:20,So there are a couple of these things only in existence.
00:39:20,00:39:23,"One of them is in the Medieval Crime Museum in Rothenburg, and in other words, in the Amsterdam"
00:39:23,00:39:25,Torch Museum.
00:39:25,00:39:31,"And so there's a, I couldn't quite work out if these things, you know, were real or if"
00:39:31,00:39:39,"they were Victorian reproductions, but I did find a paper in the journal Torture, which"
00:39:39,00:39:44,"is all about other, it's about other shaming instruments."
00:39:44,00:39:50,"And there were definitely things like the neck violin, which could be attached to you."
00:39:50,00:39:55,"And you might be put in the, in a pillory, you know, you might be tied up somewhere with"
00:39:55,00:40:00,"this wooden violin, again, attached to your neck by a kind of iron band."
00:40:00,00:40:01,I saw a picture of that.
00:40:01,00:40:04,"It doesn't, to me, it didn't look like a violin at all."
00:40:04,00:40:07,"I think they just called it that because it goes on your neck, didn't they?"
00:40:07,00:40:08,Exactly.
00:40:08,00:40:12,And then there are so much definitely to look like violins.
00:40:12,00:40:13,"Oh, okay."
00:40:13,00:40:16,"Because if this one does look like a flute, that's why it confused me."
00:40:16,00:40:17,Yes.
00:40:17,00:40:18,"Or clarinet, you know."
00:40:18,00:40:19,Or clarinet.
00:40:19,00:40:20,"Or clarinet, you know."
00:40:20,00:40:21,It's one of larynx.
00:40:21,00:40:22,Do you have to play it while you're in it?
00:40:22,00:40:24,"I mean, accounts vary."
00:40:24,00:40:28,"Some people say you'd be sort of put on and walked around a bit, and you'd have to,"
00:40:28,00:40:30,"you know, go, yeah, I am a crap musician."
00:40:30,00:40:31,But.
00:40:31,00:40:34,"Oh, it is the perfect instrument for feeling sorry for yourself as well, the violin."
00:40:34,00:40:35,So that's quite a piece.
00:40:35,00:40:36,Yes.
00:40:36,00:40:41,"So I asked Greg Jenner about this, whether he thought this was a real thing or not."
00:40:41,00:40:48,"And he asked Dr. Eleanor Jeneger, who is at Going Medieval on Twitter, who's a medieval historian."
00:40:48,00:40:50,And she isn't sure.
00:40:50,00:40:54,"She thinks that it might be one of those inventions that were, as she puts it, retrofitted, as"
00:40:54,00:40:58,"in just like a Victorian, more of a Victorian idea."
00:40:58,00:41:04,"On the German Wikipedia, it says, in recent times, the shan flute is often presented as"
00:41:04,00:41:09,"a punishment for bad musicians, but like the neck violin, which also resembles musical instrument,"
00:41:09,00:41:13,it served to punish various minor violations of the legal system.
00:41:13,00:41:18,"So not for musicians, but just a more general kind of punishment like the stocks kind of thing."
00:41:18,00:41:21,"So I guess we just don't really know, do we?"
00:41:21,00:41:22,It's kind of.
00:41:22,00:41:23,Yeah.
00:41:23,00:41:28,"So the violin definitely seems to be a thing, but not necessarily for musicians, perhaps,"
00:41:28,00:41:29,"no, no."
00:41:29,00:41:33,"It seems to make more sense that they'd be used to punish an actual crime, but they did"
00:41:33,00:41:34,use to make punishments fitting with the crime.
00:41:34,00:41:41,"So maybe if you've stolen a violin or beaten up a violinist, you know, it's, it's waiting"
00:41:41,00:41:45,"for a long time if you make a massive metal flute for someone to steal a flute, isn't it?"
00:41:45,00:41:47,"It's like, surely it'll happen eventually."
00:41:47,00:41:48,What do they steal?
00:41:48,00:41:49,Are they stolen some bread?
00:41:49,00:41:50,Okay.
00:41:50,00:41:55,"Have we got a massive bit of metal, still waiting on the flute?"
00:41:55,00:42:01,"Not only did they have the neck violin, but I saw as well that in one of these museums,"
00:42:01,00:42:05,"the crime museum in Rotterdam, that they got a double neck violin."
00:42:05,00:42:09,"And the idea of the double neck violin was, according to the little caption that goes"
00:42:09,00:42:13,"with the, with the item is that it was for arguing couples and they would have to walk around"
00:42:13,00:42:17,"with them on, sometimes with bells attached, ringing."
00:42:17,00:42:20,The idea was that they would walk in shame until they resolved their argument.
00:42:20,00:42:25,So it was just a quick way of making them actually talk to each other and shaming themselves
00:42:25,00:42:28,into an understanding of their points.
00:42:28,00:42:30,And why is there a violin hanging between them?
00:42:30,00:42:33,It just seems like they're totally a relevant part of that set up.
00:42:33,00:42:34,What's romantic?
00:42:34,00:42:37,"Oh, so when they make up, they can do a little serenade."
00:42:37,00:42:38,"Yeah, exactly."
00:42:38,00:42:41,"It's like when someone comes to your table, where you're having dinner and plays a song for"
00:42:41,00:42:42,you.
00:42:42,00:42:44,Fair enough.
00:42:44,00:42:48,"So just on flutes, is it flutist or flautist?"
00:42:48,00:42:49,Flutist.
00:42:49,00:42:50,Okay.
00:42:50,00:42:51,One vote for flautist.
00:42:51,00:42:53,"It seems to be that in America, it's flutist."
00:42:53,00:42:59,"Although one of the greatest ever players, Julius Baker, he has said it should be flutition."
00:42:59,00:43:00,Mmm.
00:43:00,00:43:01,Like a beauty.
00:43:01,00:43:05,It tells us that one of the flutes are flutist.
00:43:05,00:43:06,I've always said flautist.
00:43:06,00:43:07,I thought that was the...
00:43:07,00:43:09,"I think it is the standard in the UK, definitely."
00:43:09,00:43:10,I do.
00:43:10,00:43:11,Me too.
00:43:11,00:43:12,I think that's because we're British.
00:43:12,00:43:13,Dan?
00:43:13,00:43:14,Yeah.
00:43:14,00:43:15,I'm not a good one to ask.
00:43:15,00:43:17,"I only just found out through James that I've been saying ""peanest"" wrong this whole"
00:43:17,00:43:18,time.
00:43:18,00:43:19,"That it's a ""peanest""."
00:43:19,00:43:20,Okay.
00:43:20,00:43:24,But flutes are four times as old as farming.
00:43:24,00:43:25,Okay.
00:43:25,00:43:26,Yeah.
00:43:26,00:43:29,"People were just eating flutes for the first 30,000 years."
00:43:29,00:43:30,They...
00:43:30,00:43:34,"They found these bones with holes in them, didn't they?"
00:43:34,00:43:40,And the holes are the correct distance apart to make you think that they must be a flutist.
00:43:40,00:43:41,Mmm.
00:43:41,00:43:43,"I'm a little bit unconvinced by it, I must say."
00:43:43,00:43:44,But that is like...
00:43:44,00:43:51,"Well, so there's one which I think they more convinced by, which is 35,000 years old."
00:43:51,00:43:54,"And there's one which is a bit of a borderline case, and that's the one I'm betting on, which"
00:43:54,00:43:57,"is 43,000 years old."
00:43:57,00:44:01,"It could be unbelievably good luck that there are these holes in it, or it could be there"
00:44:01,00:44:06,a lot of bones with some of them must have holes in it in the right spaces.
00:44:06,00:44:12,"But the 43,000-year-old one is the leg bone of a cave bear, which is an incredibly epic thing"
00:44:12,00:44:13,to make.
00:44:13,00:44:14,I know.
00:44:14,00:44:18,"I mentioned the combination of skills that you need to be a flute player in 43,000 years"
00:44:18,00:44:19,ago.
00:44:19,00:44:22,"You need to be able to kill a bear, but also to have the finesse."
00:44:22,00:44:23,Yeah.
00:44:23,00:44:24,Did you play?
00:44:24,00:44:25,That is incredible.
00:44:25,00:44:30,"We can safely say that the coolest guy in an orchestra, or girl, which is not a difficult"
00:44:30,00:44:37,"thing to be, I know, but it's definitely the person who's playing the bear's limb."
00:44:37,00:44:43,"In 1969, there was an Australian park ranger, and he heard the sound of a flute playing"
00:44:43,00:44:48,"in the park, and it turned out that it was a bird called the Liabird, and the Liabird"
00:44:48,00:44:55,"can copy people's noises, and you know, you sometimes see them on like a nature documentaries"
00:44:55,00:44:59,where they're making the sound of drills or something like that or mobile phones because
00:44:59,00:45:00,they've copied them.
00:45:00,00:45:06,"So he heard this bird that was singing a tune that sounded just like a flute, and he did"
00:45:06,00:45:10,"some research, and he found that 30 years earlier, there was a flute player who'd lived near"
00:45:10,00:45:15,"the park with a pet Liabird, and he used to play the flute to this bird, and then he let"
00:45:15,00:45:18,the bird go free into the forest.
00:45:18,00:45:23,"And what he surmises is that that bird then taught the song to all the other Liabirds,"
00:45:23,00:45:30,"and so what we're hearing now in the, or in 1969, in the forest was like a recording of"
00:45:30,00:45:33,a 1930s song that that guy had played on his flute.
00:45:33,00:45:39,"And it was that song about the Dennis the Menace from Venice, wasn't it?"
00:45:39,00:45:43,We should make full orchestra's out of birds to save us having to carve all these instruments
00:45:43,00:45:44,out of bear limbs.
00:45:44,00:45:47,We could just train up Liabirds to play everything.
00:45:47,00:45:54,"Or like Beyoncé should release her next album, Purely Unburished."
00:45:54,00:46:00,"Okay, just one thing going back to medieval punishment very quickly, in medieval Ireland,"
00:46:00,00:46:07,"the punishment for masturbation was penance of 120 days, so you had to do your Hail Mary's"
00:46:07,00:46:13,"and our fathers and stuff for 120 days, and for a priest it was a penance of a full year"
00:46:13,00:46:16,every time you masturbated you had to do that.
00:46:16,00:46:26,"And that is according to the penitential of Cmeneanus, which is the penitential of Cmeneanus."
00:46:26,00:46:33,"There was a guy called Cmeneanus, and he wrote that these rules about, so I'm getting a bit"
00:46:33,00:46:41,"of interference, what was he called, James, so he was called, he was also sometimes called"
00:46:41,00:46:48,"just Cmenean, if you didn't call me Fred."
00:46:48,00:46:51,"If you wanted to Latinise his name, it was Cmeneanus."
00:46:51,00:46:59,"Well, I bet he didn't want to Latinise his name very much."
00:46:59,00:47:06,"Okay, that is it, that is all of our facts, thank you so much for listening."
