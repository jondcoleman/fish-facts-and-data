00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.440
 (phone ringing)

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:05.240
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.740
 (lively music)

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:18.200
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.000
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.260
 this week coming to you live from Manchester!

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.260
 (audience cheering)

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.620
 (audience cheering)

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:36.560
 - My name is Dan Schreiber and I'm sitting here

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.260
 with Anich Zinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.840
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.580
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.440
 and in a particular order, here we go.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.720
 Starting with you, James Harkin.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.540
 - Okay, my fact this week is that the first loop,

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.980
 the loop roller coaster closed

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.660
 because so many riders were passing out.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.140
 (laughing)

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.660
 - Oh, that's the end of the show!

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.860
 (laughing)

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.700
 - They were passing out, they were passing out.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.900
 This was, so it was on Coney Island, it was in 1901

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.540
 and what it was, it was a loop, the loop.

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.980
 I don't know if you would notice this today,

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.980
 if you look at a loop, the loop, they're not circular,

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.180
 they're kind of like elliptical things.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.900
 And the reason is, if you have a circular loop, the loop,

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.260
 it basically kills you.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:23.260
 (laughing)

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.260
 Really?

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.980
 - Yeah, this one, it's called the Coney Flip Flap

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.560
 and it was giving people, it was,

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:30.560
 (laughing)

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.140
 it's that rude in Manchester.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.220
 - No!

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.180
 - So the Coney Flip Flap produced 12 G's

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:38.700
 of gravitational force.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.940
 - How, how, what is that?

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.380
 - That's, I think, that's a lot.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.940
 - It's about 9G, it's like the maximum

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.180
 that like air jet pilots, fighter pilots ever go up to?

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.180
 - Oh my god, exactly.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.420
 So the biggest, the craziest roller coaster today,

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:53.780
 I think is 6G.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.020
 And this was 12 G.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.020
 I mean, it just, basically, you went on it

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.660
 and more often than not, you passed out

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.820
 or you got wet plash or whatever.

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.660
 And they made more money charging spectators

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.580
 to watch the frighten riders.

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.860
 (laughing)

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.620
 - You just put on someone you don't like.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.620
 Oh no, I've bought you the ticket, go on mate,

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:15.860
 you take it.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:16.700
 I'll see you in a bit.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.260
 - That is so funny, right?

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.820
 - I actually read, and I've only just noticed,

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.460
 this is the case, looking at the year in my notes.

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.740
 But there was a roller coaster in France in 1846

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.260
 that did have a loop, but it was just a cart on a track.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.500
 But it went fast enough to have a loop there.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:34.700
 And there were lots of reports about it,

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.420
 but people who operated like fairgrounds

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.500
 or the equivalent then were prone to exaggeration.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.060
 So first of all, all the new stories at the time

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.500
 reported it as going at 150 miles per hour,

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.060
 which is as fast as the fastest roller coaster today.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.780
 So that's impressive.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.980
 They tested it at the time using sound bags, eggs, and monkeys.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.980
 And, but yeah, apparently they had loops up to 12 meters high,

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.900
 I read in a book called The Incredible Screen Machine,

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.140
 but the book also points out that the makers were prone

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.980
 to massive exaggeration.

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.420
 They could snap riders next.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:10.260
 - That is bad.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.420
 - It put people off.

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:12.260
 (laughing)

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.180
 - You don't want the photo to be going off

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.420
 just at that moment that you're next up to you.

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.100
 (laughing)

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.700
 - You get barrism as the least of your worries at that moment.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:21.980
 (laughing)

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.780
 - And those, I think the French ones,

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.500
 it was just, it was a one person loop the loop.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.140
 So it was just you in the sled.

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.740
 You go down the thing, loop the loop, your neck breaks,

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:32.900
 and then the next person comes in.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.780
 - The next person still gets on.

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.260
 (laughing)

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:37.060
 - This is a really cool thing.

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.620
 Okay, so Coney Island, they had a load of roller coasters

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.980
 and one of the first ever ones, I think it was called

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.020
 the Switchback, and it was founded by a women's underwear

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.180
 magnet called Lamarca's Thompson.

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.020
 - Yeah.

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.100
 - And it was a moral mission, 'cause Coney Island was full

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:55.100
 of alcohol and other immoral attractions.

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.460
 - I really struggled not to say the word prostitutes there,

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:59.300
 didn't I, but.

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.820
 (laughing)

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.340
 - It's crazy you avoided it though.

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.420
 (laughing)

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.780
 - And he made a roller coaster, but the thing about it was,

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.260
 it went at 10 miles an hour, which is not especially first,

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:12.980
 and it had to be hand pushed.

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.980
 So, you would get, workers would push it to the top

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.420
 of the first hill, everyone gets on, it then goes down

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.820
 to the big slide and then slides along a bit and then stops,

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.020
 everyone gets off, workers have to push it to the top

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.380
 of the next hill, everyone gets back on again.

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:26.420
 - Oh wow.

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.420
 - Did you say it was an underwear magnet though?

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:29.260
 - Yeah.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:30.700
 - And it was a moral mission, 'cause I would have thought

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:32.260
 that actually, saying about roller coasters,

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.100
 it was an extremely good way to advertise your underwear,

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.940
 isn't it?

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.980
 Because the way it works off when it's on display.

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.820
 - So, I don't think I've, I don't think I've,

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.300
 I think I missed that one at Thorpe Park, isn't it?

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.620
 (laughing)

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:45.620
 - What?

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.100
 Where have you been taken?

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.380
 - I just, my mum used to dangle me out the window

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.900
 by my ankles and then tell me we were two people.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:52.900
 - Yeah.

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.980
 This guy, Lamarcus Thompson is his name.

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:55.980
 He was the inventor of it.

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.900
 And as Andy's saying, it was about morals,

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.100
 but specifically, he invented it to stop people

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.380
 from being tempted by Satan, specifically.

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.060
 So, he was worried that Satan would get people,

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:08.500
 and he thought this roller coaster

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:09.860
 would bring them back to Jesus.

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.740
 That was genuinely the idea behind the invention

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.660
 of the Coney Island roller coasters.

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:15.500
 - That's cool.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.500
 So, another licentious kind of theme park.

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.020
 This one hasn't actually opened yet.

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.500
 There was, there were hoping to open it this year in Brazil,

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.780
 but they haven't opened it because of the political problems

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:28.420
 there and the financial problems,

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:30.860
 but it is a sex themed amusement park

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:32.460
 called Enrotica Land.

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.340
 Okay, it had penis shaped dodgyms.

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.820
 - Oh, but one should be a penis shape

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:39.860
 and one should be a vagina shape, right?

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.220
 So, when you crash, it's like, oh, that's sexy.

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:44.020
 (audience laughing)

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.340
 Is that sexy?

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:49.700
 - James, "Aderotica Land," everything is sexy.

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:51.620
 - And the locals were really worried

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:53.980
 and they thought that maybe, like all of the people

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:55.860
 going to this theme park would just end up having sex

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.180
 all the time.

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:00.500
 But the guy who was behind the project, Moro Marata,

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.660
 said that no one would be having sex in this theme park.

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:05.420
 But if attendees do want to take things

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:08.620
 to another level, they can go to a nearby motel,

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:09.820
 which we will operate.

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:11.500
 (audience laughing)

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.340
 - You know, the king of roller coasters,

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:16.460
 the great lord of roller coaster design

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:18.020
 is a guy called Ron Tumor.

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.340
 He died a couple of years ago, I think in 2011,

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:23.180
 but he couldn't go on roller coasters himself.

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:26.460
 So he got extreme motion sickness,

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:27.820
 but he's the person who's pioneered

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:29.900
 every roller coaster design, you know,

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:33.180
 any kind of spin, loop, the loops, all that kind of stuff.

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:35.780
 And he himself said, riding roller coasters

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:38.060
 never really appealed to me.

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:40.580
 I rode once or twice and that was enough for me

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:42.900
 to get a general idea of what it felt like.

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:43.740
 - Wow.

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:45.780
 - And then he designed like 93 roller coasters.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.460
 And he also designed a heat shield

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:49.380
 for the Apollo spacecraft missions.

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:50.220
 - No.

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:51.060
 - Yeah, sure did.

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:52.060
 - Wow, wow.

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:54.540
 - Have you heard of a guy called Richard Rodriguez?

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:55.740
 - No. - He's so cool.

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:57.380
 So he has spent his whole life,

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:01.140
 pretty much on roller coasters, i.e. in 2007,

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:04.260
 he spent 17 consecutive days and nights

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.660
 in blackpool on a roller coaster.

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:09.980
 - 17 days, he slept on there, he ate on there.

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:11.420
 He took a five minute break every hour,

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:13.620
 just a shower or go to the Lou.

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:16.100
 - Well throw up, presumably.

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:18.500
 - But he's been doing this since 1977.

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:19.340
 - Wow.

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:20.900
 - And he keeps on breaking his own record.

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:23.300
 In 1977, he did four days in Coney Island.

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:25.580
 And he trained himself by sticking his head out

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:27.620
 of a car window for hours on end.

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:29.420
 (laughing)

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:30.260
 Like a dog.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.340
 - Do you know what the oldest

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:34.100
 operating roller coaster is?

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:35.900
 The oldest continually operating one.

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:36.740
 - No.

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:38.020
 - Is, and the only reason I mention this

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:39.700
 is that I used to live in Melbourne

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:42.540
 and I went on this with my mum and we went on it

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:44.340
 and we came off and said that is the most painful,

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:46.660
 uncomfortable experience of either of our lives.

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:47.780
 And it's because it's a roller coaster

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:49.020
 that's over a hundred years old

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:50.620
 and no one's ever done anything to it.

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:52.140
 It's in Luna Park in Melbourne.

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:52.980
 - Oh yeah.

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:54.300
 - And it's been continuously running

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:56.420
 since I think about 1905.

00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:58.100
 But it's a horrible experience.

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:00.220
 - Is it because your skirt was at the entire time?

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:01.900
 (laughing)

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:03.500
 - In a few years ago, thought park,

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:06.420
 they asked the public for donations of their own urine

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:07.900
 to help make an authentic smell

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:10.740
 for their new horror movie themed ride.

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:13.460
 (laughing)

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:15.700
 And if you have strong feelings about that,

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:17.260
 you can just send your own donation

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:18.540
 to the park management.

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:20.220
 (laughing)

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:21.700
 - Would they just gonna spray it in the air

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:22.700
 to give it a sense?

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:23.540
 - I don't know.

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:25.020
 - I think it was a publicity stunt, to be honest.

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:26.900
 - There must be rules about that.

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:28.620
 - Although who would write the rules?

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:29.780
 (laughing)

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:30.780
 - I would think of past that.

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:31.780
 - Yeah.

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:32.780
 - Is somewhere going.

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:34.420
 - I know it seems really far-fetched,

00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:35.580
 but I just want to write this rule

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:38.020
 'cause I reckon just possibly someone's gonna ask

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:40.220
 for the public urine from all the coasters.

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:41.860
 I know it seems niche, I don't know why,

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:43.660
 can we put it in the big rule book.

00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:45.460
 Is there a big rule book?

00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:46.300
 - Yes.

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:47.660
 (laughing)

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:50.100
 - And so just going back to this loop, the loop.

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:50.940
 - Yeah.

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:52.220
 - So it was, did I say 12G?

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:53.460
 I think it was 12G.

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:56.300
 And that is pretty much as much as you can manage

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:58.660
 as a human, or that's what people thought.

00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:00.980
 But then there was a guy called John Stapp,

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:03.980
 who decided to make himself a sled,

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:06.020
 which basically went really, really, really fast

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:07.700
 and then just stopped.

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:10.100
 And he wanted to see how much G-Force,

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:12.180
 the human body, will be able to stand.

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:14.420
 And this was important, it was in the 1940s,

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:16.460
 it was important because new airplanes were coming

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:18.100
 and they needed to know what people would do.

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:19.780
 And they thought that actually most people

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:23.620
 would maybe kind of die around sort of 12 to 15,

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:24.580
 something like that.

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:27.620
 But he managed to do 46.2G.

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:28.460
 - No.

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:29.300
 - Whoa.

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:34.620
 For one instant, his body weighed 7,700 pounds.

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:35.460
 - Whoa.

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:36.300
 - What?

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:37.140
 - Yeah.

00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:37.980
 - Wow.

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:39.300
 - Do you know how you do it, though,

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:42.700
 if you ever do need to withstand huge amounts of gravity?

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:43.540
 - I know.

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:47.620
 - You, so I was reading this in a article

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:49.460
 about how jet pilots prepare for it,

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:51.700
 and the way they get prepared is they're put in this chamber

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:54.100
 at the end of a really long arm

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:55.540
 that's spinning round and round,

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:57.260
 and they're trained on how to deal with it.

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:58.740
 And what you do is,

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:01.740
 you have to strain like you're doing a poo,

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:03.380
 and you make sort of a hick sound.

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:05.220
 So you've got to sort of,

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:06.860
 and that prevents the blood from flowing away

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:07.860
 from the brain too far.

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:09.660
 So it means you can remain conscious longer.

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:12.460
 And the guys who can tolerate lots and lots of G-Force

00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:14.060
 are called G-monsters.

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:14.900
 - Oh, cool.

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:16.380
 (laughing)

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:19.260
 I've seen that contraption.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.340
 So they sit at the end, they spin round and round.

00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:23.820
 I've seen it, I've seen Brian Bleser do it.

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:26.340
 Was he straining?

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:31.340
 - Well, no, he was training to be an astronaut in Russia,

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:34.900
 'cause they said they were gonna send him up to space.

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:36.820
 There's footage you can see if you wanna see it,

00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:38.340
 it's on YouTube, he gets into it,

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:40.620
 and he's saying, I've been built, I've been up Everest,

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:42.740
 I'm built to last in this thing.

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:44.780
 I have a body and lungs bigger than anyone else.

00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:45.620
 I'm amazing.

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:47.740
 And he sits inside, and it starts,

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:49.460
 and immediately he's just there going,

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:51.700
 (laughing)

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:53.860
 It's the funniest thing I've ever seen.

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:56.140
 It's just a terrifying blessing.

00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:58.300
 Going at G-Force and astronaut, let's go.

00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:00.580
 I go, (laughing)

00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:02.300
 - But that's actually also what he looks like

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:03.780
 when he's straining on the toilet.

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:05.620
 (laughing)

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:07.060
 - Should we move on to our next facts?

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:09.180
 Time to go on to fact number two,

00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:11.340
 and that is Andrew Hunter Murray.

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:14.820
 My fact is that America has a national grocery bag

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:16.860
 packing competition.

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:19.580
 - And this is a huge deal in America.

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:21.300
 They get crowds cheering and gathering

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:23.820
 of people film it, and it's just people

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:27.460
 who work at checkout till packing groceries into a bag.

00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:28.300
 - That's it.

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:30.740
 - And is it to see the fastest person to do it,

00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:32.580
 or the most groceries packed in a bag?

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:35.780
 - The criteria are so strict, I love it.

00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:39.500
 So you all get the same stuff like you and your fellow competitors.

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:41.620
 So we would all get the same items,

00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:44.220
 but they vary hugely in terms of weight.

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:46.700
 Some of them are fragile, some of them are very dense,

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:49.780
 and the criteria you get marked on is speed,

00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:53.940
 but also bag building technique, style, weight distribution

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:56.580
 between bags, attitude, and appearance.

00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:57.420
 - Attitude.

00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:59.340
 (laughing)

00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:00.820
 - But they're really strict.

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:03.820
 So one person finished really, really fast,

00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:06.580
 but his bags weighed 17 and 21 pounds.

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:09.620
 And the woman who won, her bags weighed 19 and 19 pounds.

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:10.460
 She got it dead on.

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:11.620
 - Wow.

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:13.980
 - And did she know the weight of the object's pride

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:14.820
 of putting it in?

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:16.140
 - No, no, no, no, you're just picking her up.

00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:17.940
 - Wow, you're just feeling it, smelling it.

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:19.460
 - Oh, yeah, yeah, it's so good.

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:22.460
 You don't need to smell it, so look how heavy it is.

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:23.820
 - But that would be attitude.

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:24.980
 That would get you attitude, boy.

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:26.340
 - That's about 12 kilos.

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:28.780
 (laughing)

00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:30.420
 - I would draw coins for attitude

00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:33.660
 if someone snipped my shopping all the way over here.

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:37.700
 - I was shocked in, I lived for three months in Kosovo

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:39.140
 'cause my grandmother was living there,

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:40.860
 and there was our local grocery store,

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:42.540
 which took an hour each time,

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:44.580
 even if you were buying like six items,

00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:46.980
 'cause they didn't have any price tags on each item.

00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:49.340
 So the person at the counter would pick it up

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:51.660
 and stare at it for ages, and never spoke out loud,

00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:52.980
 but I could see they were going,

00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:58.340
 "If I were a can of baked beans, how much would I be?"

00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:00.780
 And really thought about it, and then slowly packed.

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:03.620
 So I feel like that's good attitude.

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:04.460
 - Yeah.

00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:08.260
 - So there's one contestant from each state in America.

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.500
 There are 50 competitors out there.

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:13.700
 If there are two really good backpackers in your state,

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:15.380
 then they have to have a bag off.

00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:17.700
 That's true.

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:20.300
 - And they call themselves bag fleets.

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:21.300
 - Oh, like athletes?

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:22.900
 - Yeah. - Bag fleets.

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:25.540
 - It doesn't quite work, does it, as wordplay?

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:28.780
 - If you win your store, where you work,

00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:31.740
 your home store gets a gold plated cash register.

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:32.980
 - How useful.

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:35.980
 (audience laughing)

00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:38.540
 - Oh my god.

00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:40.140
 - It doesn't have a story, I don't know.

00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:42.060
 - It's quite good if robbers come into the store,

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:43.340
 and they ask for all the money from the till,

00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:45.140
 you're like, stupid robbers.

00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:47.140
 (audience laughing)

00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:49.340
 - But the Washington state competition

00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:52.820
 has a guy who is called a bago whisperer.

00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:56.540
 - Again, doesn't quite work, doesn't it?

00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:58.780
 - But he's a store manager and he's coached

00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:01.060
 a couple at least of successive champions.

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:01.900
 - Yeah.

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:03.620
 - He's not as impressive as being a horse whisper

00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:05.220
 'cause horses don't speak English,

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:07.300
 and so it's really amazing that you could communicate

00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:08.820
 with the horse, communicating with someone

00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:09.900
 who banks shopping.

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:13.620
 I mean, I find that quite easy when I'm in the shop.

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:18.140
 Put it in the bag, look, look how she is actually

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:19.580
 putting it in the bag now.

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:22.580
 (audience laughing)

00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:26.220
 - As well, so the really elite ones are called bag fleets,

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:27.860
 but actually they're all called baggers,

00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:28.700
 aren't they?

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:30.860
 They all call themselves baggers if they do this job.

00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:32.540
 And I went on to Urban Dictionary

00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:34.700
 to find out any other meanings of the word bago.

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:37.180
 (audience laughing)

00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:38.500
 - Go on.

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:39.340
 - No, just.

00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:44.540
 A flamboyant member of the Tea Party in America

00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:46.500
 is known as a baga.

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:48.620
 It's a derivative of the word tea baga,

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:50.620
 and it describes the costumes.

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:52.140
 (audience laughing)

00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:55.140
 It describes the costumes with tea bags

00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:57.460
 that the members were.

00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:00.540
 But it does also say, sometimes it is used as a derogatory name

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:03.060
 because it also depicts a unique sexual act.

00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:04.420
 (audience laughing)

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:06.420
 And you can fill in the rest yourself.

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:07.380
 (audience laughing)

00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:11.620
 - Did you know the first time that you could bag your own stuff

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:12.860
 was in 1916?

00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:15.580
 So this is the first self-service grocery store.

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:19.260
 So before 1916, you had to go into a shop with your shopping list

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.060
 and you had to give it to the person who worked in the shop

00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:23.180
 and say, go and do my shopping for me.

00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:24.620
 And then you waited for them to bring it to you,

00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:25.780
 which was really time consuming

00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:27.620
 and you needed lots of clerks to go and do it.

00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:31.100
 So in 1916, the first self-service shop was set up

00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:32.700
 what we would call just a shop.

00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:34.540
 And it was called Piggly Wiggly.

00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:36.100
 (audience laughing)

00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:36.940
 Intenacy.

00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:38.940
 And no one ever knew why he called it that.

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:40.940
 The founder was someone called Clarence Saunders

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:43.420
 and he launched this shop with a beauty contest

00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:46.460
 and he gave free flowers and balloons to all the kids who came

00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:49.460
 and he'd never explained why he called it Piggly Wiggly.

00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:51.100
 - He did once.

00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:53.020
 - Was this why he said he just thought it was a funny word

00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:54.020
 and he would talk about it.

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:56.220
 - He got asked, yeah, why is it called Piggly Wiggly?

00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:59.500
 And he said, so people will ask that very question.

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:02.260
 (audience laughing)

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:05.060
 - Sorry, so you're saying 1916 for that

00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:06.940
 because I was reading in 1929,

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:09.660
 was in America the invention of the grocery bag

00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:12.260
 as a paper bag.

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:15.420
 And it was a guy who invented it called Walter Dominaire

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:17.340
 and he woke up in the middle of the night.

00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:19.900
 He had a vision in the middle of the night

00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:22.180
 and he woke up and he went, oh, bags.

00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:25.060
 And because he had it, he had it.

00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:26.740
 - By the way, he kind of does this.

00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:27.580
 - Yeah.

00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:30.260
 - And then he's getting, I've got nothing to breathe into.

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:33.260
 (audience laughing)

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.620
 - Yeah, good boy.

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:38.180
 So he woke up, he went, he went bags

00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:40.580
 and he woke his wife up and he said,

00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:43.780
 bags and she, they had a shop, a grocery shop.

00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:46.420
 And he went down with his wife early in the morning

00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:50.980
 and his thought he had was to have these a brown paper bag

00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:54.740
 and to punch holes in both sides to put the strings in.

00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:55.660
 And so they did that.

00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:57.700
 They put strings in so that it was handles

00:16:57.700 --> 00:16:59.940
 and then that day they started selling them

00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:01.660
 and people went nuts for it.

00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:04.980
 They sold them incidentally very sort of full circle

00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:06.340
 for five cents, you know.

00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:09.740
 So it was, you bought it for what we've now returned to.

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:10.580
 - Oh wow.

00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:11.420
 - Yeah.

00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:13.060
 So he sold them, everyone went crazy.

00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:15.220
 They were buying more bags and they were the actual stuff

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:17.780
 in the grocery store and then they ran out of bags.

00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:20.460
 They bought more bags and then she sat there

00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:24.180
 customizing all the bags with magazines and newspapers.

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:26.700
 So she cut out pictures that she thought were really nice

00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:28.780
 and she stuck them to the side of each bag

00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:30.100
 and just sold that.

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:31.780
 And then he filed it as a patent

00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:33.740
 and he became a multi-millionaire

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:35.020
 over the next couple of years

00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:37.700
 and they were the largest manufacturer of grocery bags

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:39.220
 in America for a very long time.

00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:40.340
 I think I've made that bit up.

00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:43.420
 But they were, that feels right, doesn't it?

00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:45.300
 So that, yeah, just quickly.

00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:48.660
 Do you know what people had before they had shopping bags?

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:50.740
 This is so cool.

00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:53.140
 Before you had a shopping bag, some people,

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:56.980
 not everybody, but a lot of people had cornucopias.

00:17:56.980 --> 00:17:58.580
 So you know in sort of old paintings,

00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:00.460
 you have these horns of plenty

00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:03.580
 and it's full of fruit and lobster and white grape

00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:04.420
 and everything.

00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:05.420
 People would take...

00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:06.420
 Like a big horn.

00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:08.140
 Like a big horn, it was wicker

00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:11.140
 and you would take your horn of plenty to the shops.

00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:12.180
 Oh, wow.

00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:13.180
 How cool is that?

00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:14.980
 Why don't we all have horns of plenty?

00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:17.940
 Why have we been cheated from our birthright?

00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:20.620
 I think we could, we could have a new business, couldn't we?

00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:21.620
 Yes.

00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:23.860
 According to Dan, this other guy made billions.

00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:24.860
 Yeah.

00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:26.860
 If we start making horns of plenty for life,

00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:31.220
 would you buy a horn of plenty?

00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:35.140
 I think if you come up with any business idea,

00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:37.940
 starting with the phrase, according to Dan,

00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:40.420
 you need to be really careful.

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:42.540
 Plastic bags, when they started,

00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:44.900
 this, the marketing was so confident

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:46.620
 that it was going to change the world.

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:48.860
 This is from the Baker Light Corporation,

00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:51.900
 who were the first people to put out plastic bags.

00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:54.460
 They said, and this was literally their PR,

00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:57.500
 that this bag had transcended the old tax...

00:18:57.500 --> 00:18:58.580
 How do I say that? Taxonomy?

00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:00.300
 Taxonomy. Taxonomy, thank you.

00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:03.580
 Had, boys, goods have an added point.

00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:06.780
 Had transcended the old taxonomy of animal mineral...

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:09.260
 I said, really close.

00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:12.540
 So what's it again? Taxonomy. Taxonomy.

00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:16.660
 Taxonomy. I mean, soft pedal it.

00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:19.260
 Taxonomy. Yeah.

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:23.500
 They said it had transcended the old taxonomy of animal...

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:25.820
 CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:33.580
 That's going to be awkward to wear it with that massive cheer.

00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:37.420
 I guess the people of Manchester just really love taxonomy.

00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:44.060
 Darling, did Manchester invent taxonomy?

00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:50.820
 Come on, Dad, you've got to get to the end of this.

00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:52.100
 We've lost it.

00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:54.500
 This will better be fucking good, Dad.

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:56.340
 Jesus.

00:19:56.340 --> 00:20:01.380
 The Baker Light Company said that it had transcended the old taxonomy of animal...

00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:04.500
 CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:06.940
 ..of animal mineral and vegetable,

00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:12.540
 and now we had a fourth kingdom whose boundaries are unlimited.

00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:15.740
 That is cool. Yeah.

00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:17.940
 OK, it is time...

00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:21.020
 For fact, number three, and that is my fact,

00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:26.020
 is one of the things you need to know in order to become a British citizen

00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:30.020
 is who introduced shampoo to the UK.

00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:32.660
 Oh. It's an actual thing that you get asked.

00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:34.100
 And who was it?

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:35.500
 Well, his name is...

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:37.980
 Sheslow, get out.

00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:42.060
 His name is Shakedeen Muhammad.

00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:46.700
 He was a Bengali, Anglo-Indian traveler, inventor.

00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:49.700
 He opened the very first curry house in the UK.

00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:51.900
 It was in London.

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:56.940
 But he also opened up these amazing things called the shampoo baths of the UK.

00:20:56.940 --> 00:20:58.980
 There was shampooing baths where you would go in.

00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:02.100
 And it was basically a massage, and it was all sorts of oils,

00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:03.620
 and it was like a spa.

00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:04.820
 It was a bathing spa.

00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:10.300
 And weirdly, that is a question that you get asked when you're sitting down

00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:13.220
 to work out if you're allowed into the UK as a citizen.

00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:15.020
 Have you seen the list of questions?

00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:17.540
 Yeah. I mean, they're unbelievably hard, aren't they?

00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:20.420
 Literally, no one would be able to get any of these answers.

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:21.220
 Yeah.

00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:26.540
 It's like, you have to know what year was the battle of the boy just off the top of your head?

00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:29.700
 Who's 16-80?

00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:30.900
 Get out.

00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:33.060
 16-80.

00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:34.940
 I don't know when it was.

00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:37.180
 You get out.

00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:40.380
 I know you're going to have to carry the show from this point onwards.

00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:43.060
 In the previous version, it was worse in the past.

00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:46.780
 In the previous versions of the test, you needed to know 49 different websites

00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:54.860
 and 36 telephone numbers, including the phone number for the National Academic Recognition Information Centre.

00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:58.140
 You still need to know that there are still five telephone numbers on it,

00:21:58.140 --> 00:22:01.140
 so they have paired it down, but you still need to know the phone numbers

00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:03.300
 for their House of Commons.

00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:06.500
 The Welsh Assembly, and the Scottish Parliament,

00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:09.100
 but weirdly, in the five telephone numbers that you need to know,

00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:12.540
 999 is not there.

00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:18.060
 Hello, is that my MP? There's the burglar in my house.

00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:20.580
 What like, and what are you going to do about it?

00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:25.500
 Oh, fine. I'll ring the Welsh Assembly, if that's possible.

00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:29.740
 I read one question that's in it. Apparently, it used to have this question.

00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:33.060
 Suppose you spill someone's pint in the pub.

00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:34.660
 What usually happens next?

00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:37.220
 Bunch up.

00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:38.820
 I rather think that that depends.

00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:42.220
 The answer in London will be very different from the answer in Manchester, I think.

00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:44.700
 What happens in Manchester?

00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:48.100
 Well, why don't you try it tonight?

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:51.340
 Is it a quaint local custom that if you're a newcomer to the city,

00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:53.420
 you have to spill as many people's pint as possible?

00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:55.580
 Yeah, that's right. Okay, great.

00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:59.100
 Any stuff on shampoo, maybe? Yeah, sure.

00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:04.780
 This is just interesting. The word shampoo is kind of an Indian, a Hindi word,

00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:08.340
 and it comes from "shampna" meaning "to need",

00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:10.980
 and it comes from the same word as "chapati".

00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:13.460
 No way. Just an interesting thing.

00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:17.340
 I got completely distracted and I started looking at how people's hair

00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:19.100
 and how animals clean themselves,

00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:22.900
 because if you don't shampoo, eventually your hair gets back into a kind of balance.

00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:25.340
 Well, actually, I tried that.

00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:27.700
 Oh, yeah. Yeah, for QI, right?

00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:31.180
 Yeah, for QI, I tried going six months without washing my hair.

00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:35.140
 I remember that, and it does not work.

00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:37.620
 And his wife was not.

00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:42.260
 Well, this was before I was married. Actually, I was single, actually.

00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:43.500
 Oh, okay. Yeah.

00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:45.980
 Actually, around the same time, I read something else,

00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:49.860
 which was that if you put an onion in your shoe and walk around,

00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:53.220
 then by the end of the day, you'll be able to taste it in your mouth,

00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:55.620
 and that doesn't work either.

00:23:55.620 --> 00:23:56.620
 Wow.

00:23:56.620 --> 00:24:00.060
 But it does probably explain why I was single.

00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:03.340
 Okay, there's so many reasons.

00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:08.220
 So when a fly cleans itself, right? It combs itself.

00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:10.820
 It sort of combs its body and it's got hairs sticking out of it.

00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:13.420
 When they clean themselves, the particles that have gathered on them

00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:17.860
 are catapulted off the hairs at 1,000G.

00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:19.220
 What? No.

00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:21.420
 Well, it's 1,000 times the acceleration of gravity.

00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:22.900
 Is that G? It is, yeah.

00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:25.260
 Probably missed time to zero or two.

00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:28.900
 But do you know how cicadas keep themselves clean?

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:30.260
 This is so cool.

00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:34.260
 They have, on their bodies, tiny, tiny nanoscale pin cushions

00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:38.380
 that mean that when a bacteria bumps into them, the bacteria explodes.

00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:39.900
 Wow.

00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:42.100
 And what that cleans them through the explosion?

00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:44.820
 Well, it doesn't clean them. It just means they don't have a bacteria on them anymore.

00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:47.180
 That is so cool.

00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:49.380
 Not if you're a bacteria. Sure.

00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:51.900
 Yeah, no one ever speaks off of the bacteria.

00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:53.380
 It was on the cicada side.

00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:56.140
 Actually, the reason we need to wash our hair,

00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:57.580
 I think, is quite interesting.

00:24:57.580 --> 00:25:01.980
 It's that we have all these sebaceous glands and they create oil into our scalp

00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:05.100
 and so it gets really oily and gross, and it's to waterproof.

00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:08.660
 So our scalp is quite waterproof. Our face also has quite a lot of them.

00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:10.100
 So that's quite waterproof.

00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:13.660
 But we don't have any of these glands on the palms of our hands,

00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:14.860
 or the soles of our feet.

00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:18.700
 So if you grow hair on the palms of your hands, or the soles of your feet,

00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:21.940
 you don't need to wash it as a consolation.

00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:24.540
 I have hair on my feet. I've got like a hobbit feet.

00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:31.620
 So the soles of your feet. No, the soles of your feet are hairy.

00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:33.820
 Hang on, are we quibbling over what soles mean?

00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:34.980
 I think so. Yeah.

00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:37.060
 The bottom bit. Okay, no, yeah, yeah.

00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:39.060
 Oh, my god.

00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:44.900
 Okay, we should move on to our final fact.

00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:47.020
 Do you guys ready to go to the final fact?

00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:53.500
 Okay, it's time for a final fact of the show and that is Chazinsky.

00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:58.460
 Yes, my fact is that if your metabolism was as fast as a hummingbirds,

00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:03.460
 you'd need to drink a can of coke every minute to stay alive.

00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:04.380
 Wow.

00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:09.820
 It's this hummingbirds have the most incredible metabolisms that we can't imagine.

00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:13.900
 So they've processed sugars so fast that they need to drink one,

00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:15.980
 12 ounce can of fizzy drink.

00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:18.140
 No, no, the equivalent of.

00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:20.300
 Sorry. Yeah.

00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:25.580
 We're just seeing a poor hummingbird get back to its nest with a 16 pack of coke.

00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:29.420
 Then quarter of an hour later, I'll back to the bloody shops.

00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:33.980
 But that is if we had to have the equivalent to survive,

00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:39.420
 then we'd be eating or drinking 202,000 calories a day.

00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:41.260
 We'd have to eat to stay alive.

00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:44.460
 So they have to visit 2,000 flowers a day. It's a lot.

00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:48.380
 Yeah, I read that I read 1,500 flowers on them, obviously,

00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:52.060
 another website every day. And what I liked about that is it's approximately

00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:54.540
 the same number as there are Greg's in the UK.

00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:57.580
 The human flower.

00:26:57.580 --> 00:27:05.180
 But what I worked out is with all the calories that they get and everything like that.

00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:09.180
 If you were a hummingbird, it's the equivalent of going to every Greg's in the UK

00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:11.740
 and eating half a steak bake in everyone.

00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:15.900
 Coincidentally, I've never managed more than half of a steak bake.

00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:18.780
 Yeah. Am I a hummingbird?

00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:20.140
 No. Wow.

00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:22.300
 I mean, hummingbird hearts are so cool.

00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:26.700
 They beat ten times a second, and that's quite slow for a hummingbird,

00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:29.900
 despite being the size of a rubber on the end of a pencil.

00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:31.660
 What? That's the size of hummingbirds.

00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:33.020
 No, the heart, just the heart.

00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:34.860
 Oh, sorry.

00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:37.580
 But they're small though.

00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:39.260
 They are small, they're not.

00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:41.180
 They're not six-foot tall animals with hearts,

00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:43.500
 the size of a rubber on the end of a pencil.

00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:47.580
 They would be fainting all the time.

00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:55.340
 But so the heart beats up to 1,200 beats a minute, which is very fast.

00:27:55.340 --> 00:28:00.700
 But even when they're resting, it's 500, and as a result,

00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:03.100
 at night, just to prevent themselves from dying overnight,

00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:05.340
 basically every night they go into a coma,

00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:07.900
 and their heart slows down to 50 beats a minute.

00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:09.260
 It's still pretty fast.

00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:10.300
 It's like hibernation.

00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:11.500
 It's like hibernation.

00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:12.700
 They literally every night.

00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:14.700
 And you can prod them and they won't wake up.

00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:15.820
 Obviously don't.

00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:17.900
 LAUGHTER

00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:18.780
 Yeah, but yeah.

00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:22.300
 They also, just all the figures that you read about hummingbirds,

00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:23.740
 you really have to think about in process.

00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:28.140
 So their wings flap up to a hundred times a second.

00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:31.340
 Yeah, that is completely insane.

00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:34.300
 And as I read it, I think I must have written it wrong.

00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:35.580
 Yeah, but you haven't.

00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:37.340
 I read it in the National Geographic,

00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:39.020
 and so I should say, by the way,

00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:41.260
 that this came from an amazing article on hummingbirds

00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:43.340
 from the National Geographic sometime in the last year,

00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:45.260
 so you can't get it anymore, but it was really good.

00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:47.020
 But that's, I mean...

00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:48.860
 Something quite cool, though, researchers have done,

00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:51.180
 to work out what their visual perception is like,

00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:56.060
 is they worked out how they respond to optical illusions.

00:28:56.060 --> 00:28:57.740
 So this, again, was in the National Geographic,

00:28:57.740 --> 00:28:59.820
 and they got one of those optical illusions

00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:02.460
 that is a spiral of black stripe

00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:04.940
 with white stripes in between it.

00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:06.060
 And when you spin that round,

00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:07.740
 it looks like it's moving away from you.

00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:10.380
 And they put a test tube full of hummingbird food

00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:11.420
 sticking out of it.

00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:12.860
 And so the hummingbird gets its beak in,

00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:14.460
 and it's got its little fork tongue

00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:16.060
 that drinks from the test tube.

00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:18.220
 And then, when they start spinning the spiral,

00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:20.220
 the hummingbird, just like humans do,

00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:22.220
 thinks that the spiral's moving away from them,

00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:23.420
 and because they can fly backwards,

00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:25.420
 they reverse out of the test tube,

00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:26.140
 because they're like...

00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:27.740
 Sorry, they think it's moving towards them.

00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:29.180
 So they reverse out of the test tube.

00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:33.100
 So they do have the same eyesight as we do,

00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:34.940
 and also, they're kind of idiots.

00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:36.460
 They get backing away from their food.

00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:40.300
 They've got really interesting legs as well.

00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:43.740
 Basically, they've got almost like display legs

00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:46.140
 in that they're attached to them,

00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:48.780
 but they can't walk on them, so they land,

00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:51.020
 and they can't walk, and they can't hop.

00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:53.820
 So they're just there for like standing purposes.

00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:55.180
 What do they do?

00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:56.780
 They can do a sideways thing.

00:29:56.780 --> 00:29:59.420
 You know, when they can like, so like...

00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:01.100
 Oh, no, no, no, no.

00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:02.220
 Because I don't know how to describe it.

00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:04.380
 But, you know, so like, they'll like land on a branch,

00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:05.420
 and then they'll just be like...

00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:07.820
 Hello, Steve.

00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:12.060
 A shuffle. For anyone who's listening to the podcast,

00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:15.180
 and shuffled sideways, that was the word he couldn't think of,

00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:16.540
 so he had to stand up.

00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:19.180
 Can I just say as well, for them, that's called a lec,

00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:20.380
 and it's a mating dance.

00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:22.540
 And I can kind of...

00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:23.900
 Well, I'm not sure I can see my...

00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:25.020
 I can't see that.

00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:26.060
 Tell me, I met my wife.

00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:27.900
 Hey, I didn't.

00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:29.900
 That's the...

00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:31.100
 Yeah, that's how they...

00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:35.020
 And they do that on a stick attached to a tree, a branch.

00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:36.300
 They do that on a stick attached.

00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:43.100
 Their mating only takes half a second to begin to go end.

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:43.980
 What do you mean only?

00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:49.740
 And the courting only takes a few seconds as well.

00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:50.380
 And they dive...

00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:53.820
 Yeah, they do, don't they, to impress women,

00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:56.780
 they go up higher than they dive at 60 miles an hour down,

00:30:56.780 --> 00:30:59.020
 and they also make chirping sounds.

00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:03.100
 They tweet, but not with their mouths, with their feathers.

00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:05.340
 So all hummingbirds make different chirping sounds,

00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:07.020
 and it sounds exactly like bird tweeting,

00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:09.100
 but they're doing it with their tail feathers.

00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:13.660
 So it's when they swoop the way that they vibrate as they go through the air,

00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:15.580
 makes a certain noise, and it's really beautiful.

00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:16.940
 And as a Smithsonian put it,

00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:20.380
 imagine if you could sing with your ponytail or your beard.

00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:23.420
 That is what it's like to be a hummingbird.

00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:24.460
 That's pretty cool.

00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:27.900
 And that singing towards it just kind of sounds like a chirp, right?

00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:29.820
 It is a nice chirp, but it's just a chirp.

00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:32.540
 But if you slow it down and play it into a computer,

00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:36.060
 they can hear real levels of complexity that humans can't hear.

00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:37.740
 - Levels of complexity? - Yeah.

00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:38.780
 Like what?

00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:41.180
 Please, I just want to stop drinking coke.

00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:43.820
 God, just let me slow down.

00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:51.500
 So there is only one known piece of DNA in vertebrates

00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:53.820
 with the ability to taste sweetness,

00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:55.500
 and hummingbirds don't have it.

00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:58.860
 So even though they're drinking all this nectar stuff,

00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:00.540
 we don't think they can taste sweetness.

00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:03.500
 Oh, really? Yeah, it's tragic.

00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:07.500
 I think there's a theory, though, that they modified.

00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:09.260
 So we have a bunch of taste receptors.

00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:14.860
 We all know now sweet, salty, a bit sour, and umami.

00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:17.820
 And as we all agree, umami is the kind of pointless weird one.

00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:20.620
 - It's like savory, isn't it? - Yeah, savory.

00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:22.860
 And they actually think that hummingbirds have adapted

00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:26.620
 their umami gland, and that's evolved to taste sweetness over the years.

00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:30.300
 Which what that might mean is when they're going around tasting all these flowers

00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:33.420
 1500 times, it actually tastes like a Greg steak bake.

00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:39.580
 Did you structure this whole part of the book?

00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:41.020
 I'll stick on my ground to that.

00:32:41.020 --> 00:32:47.260
 So they've got really, um, fast metabolism, don't they?

00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:51.260
 And I was trying to work out the other end of metabolism,

00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:56.140
 super slow metabolism, and slots have extremely slow metabolism.

00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:58.140
 And obviously, we know them as a very slow animal.

00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:03.260
 So they, yeah, they have an extraordinarily slow metabolism.

00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:07.260
 But um, they, so I started just, this is very off topic,

00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:09.020
 but I started reading about slots, because I thought,

00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:11.100
 why are they moving so slow and what goes on?

00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:14.060
 It turns out, I think they're meant to be water-based animals,

00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:18.140
 rather than in the trees, because when you put a slot in water,

00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:23.420
 it can swim three times as fast as it can move when it's outside of water,

00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:27.900
 and it can hold its breath for over 40 minutes underwater.

00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:28.540
 Wow.

00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:30.700
 Which is 20 minutes longer than a dolphin.

00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:31.900
 What?

00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:32.940
 Yeah.

00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:33.740
 That is amazing.

00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:36.620
 And they're just stuck up there on that stick attached to a tree.

00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:37.180
 Yeah, it's like...

00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:45.180
 Okay, that's it.

00:33:45.180 --> 00:33:46.860
 That is all of our facts.

00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:48.380
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:50.860
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us about the things

00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:53.100
 that we have said over the course of this podcast,

00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:55.020
 we can be found on our Twitter accounts.

00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:56.460
 I'm on @Streiberland.

00:33:56.460 --> 00:33:57.020
 Andy.

00:33:57.020 --> 00:33:58.060
 @AndryHunterM.

00:33:58.060 --> 00:33:58.620
 James.

00:33:58.620 --> 00:33:59.740
 @JamesHarkin.

00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:00.540
 And Shazinsky.

00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:02.780
 You can email podcast@ky.com.

00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:05.180
 Yep, or you can get us on our group account,

00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:07.500
 which is @nosuchthing, or you can go to our website.

00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:10.860
 Nosuchthing is a fish.com, where we have all of our previous episodes.

00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:13.500
 We also have a link to our book, The Book of the Year,

00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:17.420
 which we're about to give a copy away to someone in the audience here,

00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:20.780
 live at our Manchester audience, because we asked them to send in the fact,

00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:22.620
 Andy, you've got the winning fact.

00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:23.820
 I certainly have done it.

00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:25.500
 It's just on my phone, which is turning on,

00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:28.060
 so I'd like you to fill for about 15 seconds, please.

00:34:28.060 --> 00:34:30.220
 (Laughter)

00:34:30.220 --> 00:34:31.100
 Thank you.

00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:33.340
 Okay, picture... Right, I've got it. I've got it.

00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:34.380
 I've got it.

00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:35.180
 All right.

00:34:35.180 --> 00:34:37.100
 (Laughter)

00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:40.220
 Okay, this is today's winning fact.

00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:42.540
 It's from Evie Hull.

00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:45.820
 In 1993, Sam Francisco held a referendum

00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:48.860
 over whether police officer Bob Geary was allowed to patrol

00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:52.700
 while carrying a ventriloquist dummy called Brendan O'Smarty.

00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:56.380
 (Laughter)

00:34:56.380 --> 00:35:01.980
 All right, we're going to have your copy of the book out there.

00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:05.020
 Guys, we're going to be out at the back with our book of the year.

00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:08.060
 If you want to buy a copy, we're going to be signing copies out there.

00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:09.580
 Please come and say hi.

00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:11.100
 Thank you, Manchester.

00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:12.860
 That was awesome.

00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:14.220
 Let's see you later.

00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:18.220
 (Applause)

00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:28.220
 (Applause)

00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:31.300
 (audience applauding)
