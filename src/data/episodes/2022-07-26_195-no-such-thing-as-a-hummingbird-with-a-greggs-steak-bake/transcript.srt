1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,440
 (phone ringing)

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:05,240
 (speaking in foreign language)

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,740
 (lively music)

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:18,200
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

5
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,000
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,260
 this week coming to you live from Manchester!

7
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:27,260
 (audience cheering)

8
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:30,620
 (audience cheering)

9
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:36,560
 - My name is Dan Schreiber and I'm sitting here

10
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:40,260
 with Anich Zinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin.

11
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,840
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

12
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,580
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

13
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:48,440
 and in a particular order, here we go.

14
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,720
 Starting with you, James Harkin.

15
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,540
 - Okay, my fact this week is that the first loop,

16
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:55,980
 the loop roller coaster closed

17
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,660
 because so many riders were passing out.

18
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:01,140
 (laughing)

19
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,660
 - Oh, that's the end of the show!

20
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,860
 (laughing)

21
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:07,700
 - They were passing out, they were passing out.

22
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,900
 This was, so it was on Coney Island, it was in 1901

23
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,540
 and what it was, it was a loop, the loop.

24
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,980
 I don't know if you would notice this today,

25
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,980
 if you look at a loop, the loop, they're not circular,

26
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:18,180
 they're kind of like elliptical things.

27
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,900
 And the reason is, if you have a circular loop, the loop,

28
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,260
 it basically kills you.

29
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,260
 (laughing)

30
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,260
 Really?

31
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:26,980
 - Yeah, this one, it's called the Coney Flip Flap

32
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:29,560
 and it was giving people, it was,

33
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,560
 (laughing)

34
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,140
 it's that rude in Manchester.

35
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:33,220
 - No!

36
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:37,180
 - So the Coney Flip Flap produced 12 G's

37
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,700
 of gravitational force.

38
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,940
 - How, how, what is that?

39
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,380
 - That's, I think, that's a lot.

40
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:44,940
 - It's about 9G, it's like the maximum

41
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:48,180
 that like air jet pilots, fighter pilots ever go up to?

42
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,180
 - Oh my god, exactly.

43
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:52,420
 So the biggest, the craziest roller coaster today,

44
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:53,780
 I think is 6G.

45
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,020
 And this was 12 G.

46
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:59,020
 I mean, it just, basically, you went on it

47
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,660
 and more often than not, you passed out

48
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,820
 or you got wet plash or whatever.

49
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,660
 And they made more money charging spectators

50
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,580
 to watch the frighten riders.

51
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:09,860
 (laughing)

52
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:12,620
 - You just put on someone you don't like.

53
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,620
 Oh no, I've bought you the ticket, go on mate,

54
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:15,860
 you take it.

55
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:16,700
 I'll see you in a bit.

56
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,260
 - That is so funny, right?

57
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:20,820
 - I actually read, and I've only just noticed,

58
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:23,460
 this is the case, looking at the year in my notes.

59
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:27,740
 But there was a roller coaster in France in 1846

60
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:31,260
 that did have a loop, but it was just a cart on a track.

61
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,500
 But it went fast enough to have a loop there.

62
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,700
 And there were lots of reports about it,

63
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,420
 but people who operated like fairgrounds

64
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:39,500
 or the equivalent then were prone to exaggeration.

65
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,060
 So first of all, all the new stories at the time

66
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,500
 reported it as going at 150 miles per hour,

67
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,060
 which is as fast as the fastest roller coaster today.

68
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,780
 So that's impressive.

69
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:53,980
 They tested it at the time using sound bags, eggs, and monkeys.

70
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:58,980
 And, but yeah, apparently they had loops up to 12 meters high,

71
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,900
 I read in a book called The Incredible Screen Machine,

72
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,140
 but the book also points out that the makers were prone

73
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,980
 to massive exaggeration.

74
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:09,420
 They could snap riders next.

75
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,260
 - That is bad.

76
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,420
 - It put people off.

77
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,260
 (laughing)

78
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,180
 - You don't want the photo to be going off

79
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,420
 just at that moment that you're next up to you.

80
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,100
 (laughing)

81
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,700
 - You get barrism as the least of your worries at that moment.

82
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,980
 (laughing)

83
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,780
 - And those, I think the French ones,

84
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:26,500
 it was just, it was a one person loop the loop.

85
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,140
 So it was just you in the sled.

86
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,740
 You go down the thing, loop the loop, your neck breaks,

87
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,900
 and then the next person comes in.

88
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,780
 - The next person still gets on.

89
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,260
 (laughing)

90
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,060
 - This is a really cool thing.

91
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,620
 Okay, so Coney Island, they had a load of roller coasters

92
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,980
 and one of the first ever ones, I think it was called

93
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:45,020
 the Switchback, and it was founded by a women's underwear

94
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:47,180
 magnet called Lamarca's Thompson.

95
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,020
 - Yeah.

96
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,100
 - And it was a moral mission, 'cause Coney Island was full

97
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:55,100
 of alcohol and other immoral attractions.

98
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:58,460
 - I really struggled not to say the word prostitutes there,

99
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,300
 didn't I, but.

100
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,820
 (laughing)

101
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,340
 - It's crazy you avoided it though.

102
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,420
 (laughing)

103
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:08,780
 - And he made a roller coaster, but the thing about it was,

104
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:11,260
 it went at 10 miles an hour, which is not especially first,

105
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,980
 and it had to be hand pushed.

106
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:15,980
 So, you would get, workers would push it to the top

107
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:18,420
 of the first hill, everyone gets on, it then goes down

108
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:20,820
 to the big slide and then slides along a bit and then stops,

109
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,020
 everyone gets off, workers have to push it to the top

110
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:25,380
 of the next hill, everyone gets back on again.

111
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,420
 - Oh wow.

112
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:28,420
 - Did you say it was an underwear magnet though?

113
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,260
 - Yeah.

114
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,700
 - And it was a moral mission, 'cause I would have thought

115
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,260
 that actually, saying about roller coasters,

116
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:34,100
 it was an extremely good way to advertise your underwear,

117
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:34,940
 isn't it?

118
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:38,980
 Because the way it works off when it's on display.

119
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,820
 - So, I don't think I've, I don't think I've,

120
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,300
 I think I missed that one at Thorpe Park, isn't it?

121
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,620
 (laughing)

122
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,620
 - What?

123
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,100
 Where have you been taken?

124
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,380
 - I just, my mum used to dangle me out the window

125
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,900
 by my ankles and then tell me we were two people.

126
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:52,900
 - Yeah.

127
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,980
 This guy, Lamarcus Thompson is his name.

128
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:55,980
 He was the inventor of it.

129
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,900
 And as Andy's saying, it was about morals,

130
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,100
 but specifically, he invented it to stop people

131
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,380
 from being tempted by Satan, specifically.

132
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:07,060
 So, he was worried that Satan would get people,

133
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,500
 and he thought this roller coaster

134
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,860
 would bring them back to Jesus.

135
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:12,740
 That was genuinely the idea behind the invention

136
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,660
 of the Coney Island roller coasters.

137
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:15,500
 - That's cool.

138
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:19,500
 So, another licentious kind of theme park.

139
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,020
 This one hasn't actually opened yet.

140
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:24,500
 There was, there were hoping to open it this year in Brazil,

141
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,780
 but they haven't opened it because of the political problems

142
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,420
 there and the financial problems,

143
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:30,860
 but it is a sex themed amusement park

144
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,460
 called Enrotica Land.

145
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:35,340
 Okay, it had penis shaped dodgyms.

146
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,820
 - Oh, but one should be a penis shape

147
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,860
 and one should be a vagina shape, right?

148
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:42,220
 So, when you crash, it's like, oh, that's sexy.

149
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,020
 (audience laughing)

150
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,340
 Is that sexy?

151
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:49,700
 - James, "Aderotica Land," everything is sexy.

152
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,620
 - And the locals were really worried

153
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,980
 and they thought that maybe, like all of the people

154
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,860
 going to this theme park would just end up having sex

155
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,180
 all the time.

156
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:00,500
 But the guy who was behind the project, Moro Marata,

157
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,660
 said that no one would be having sex in this theme park.

158
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,420
 But if attendees do want to take things

159
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:08,620
 to another level, they can go to a nearby motel,

160
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:09,820
 which we will operate.

161
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,500
 (audience laughing)

162
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,340
 - You know, the king of roller coasters,

163
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,460
 the great lord of roller coaster design

164
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,020
 is a guy called Ron Tumor.

165
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,340
 He died a couple of years ago, I think in 2011,

166
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:23,180
 but he couldn't go on roller coasters himself.

167
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:26,460
 So he got extreme motion sickness,

168
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,820
 but he's the person who's pioneered

169
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,900
 every roller coaster design, you know,

170
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:33,180
 any kind of spin, loop, the loops, all that kind of stuff.

171
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,780
 And he himself said, riding roller coasters

172
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:38,060
 never really appealed to me.

173
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:40,580
 I rode once or twice and that was enough for me

174
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,900
 to get a general idea of what it felt like.

175
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:43,740
 - Wow.

176
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,780
 - And then he designed like 93 roller coasters.

177
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,460
 And he also designed a heat shield

178
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,380
 for the Apollo spacecraft missions.

179
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,220
 - No.

180
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,060
 - Yeah, sure did.

181
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,060
 - Wow, wow.

182
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:54,540
 - Have you heard of a guy called Richard Rodriguez?

183
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,740
 - No. - He's so cool.

184
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,380
 So he has spent his whole life,

185
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:01,140
 pretty much on roller coasters, i.e. in 2007,

186
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:04,260
 he spent 17 consecutive days and nights

187
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,660
 in blackpool on a roller coaster.

188
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,980
 - 17 days, he slept on there, he ate on there.

189
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,420
 He took a five minute break every hour,

190
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:13,620
 just a shower or go to the Lou.

191
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:16,100
 - Well throw up, presumably.

192
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,500
 - But he's been doing this since 1977.

193
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,340
 - Wow.

194
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,900
 - And he keeps on breaking his own record.

195
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,300
 In 1977, he did four days in Coney Island.

196
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,580
 And he trained himself by sticking his head out

197
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,620
 of a car window for hours on end.

198
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,420
 (laughing)

199
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,260
 Like a dog.

200
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,340
 - Do you know what the oldest

201
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,100
 operating roller coaster is?

202
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,900
 The oldest continually operating one.

203
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:36,740
 - No.

204
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,020
 - Is, and the only reason I mention this

205
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,700
 is that I used to live in Melbourne

206
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,540
 and I went on this with my mum and we went on it

207
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,340
 and we came off and said that is the most painful,

208
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,660
 uncomfortable experience of either of our lives.

209
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:47,780
 And it's because it's a roller coaster

210
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,020
 that's over a hundred years old

211
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,620
 and no one's ever done anything to it.

212
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,140
 It's in Luna Park in Melbourne.

213
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:52,980
 - Oh yeah.

214
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,300
 - And it's been continuously running

215
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,420
 since I think about 1905.

216
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,100
 But it's a horrible experience.

217
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,220
 - Is it because your skirt was at the entire time?

218
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,900
 (laughing)

219
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,500
 - In a few years ago, thought park,

220
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,420
 they asked the public for donations of their own urine

221
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,900
 to help make an authentic smell

222
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,740
 for their new horror movie themed ride.

223
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,460
 (laughing)

224
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,700
 And if you have strong feelings about that,

225
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,260
 you can just send your own donation

226
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,540
 to the park management.

227
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,220
 (laughing)

228
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,700
 - Would they just gonna spray it in the air

229
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:22,700
 to give it a sense?

230
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,540
 - I don't know.

231
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:25,020
 - I think it was a publicity stunt, to be honest.

232
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,900
 - There must be rules about that.

233
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,620
 - Although who would write the rules?

234
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,780
 (laughing)

235
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:30,780
 - I would think of past that.

236
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:31,780
 - Yeah.

237
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:32,780
 - Is somewhere going.

238
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,420
 - I know it seems really far-fetched,

239
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:35,580
 but I just want to write this rule

240
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,020
 'cause I reckon just possibly someone's gonna ask

241
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:40,220
 for the public urine from all the coasters.

242
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,860
 I know it seems niche, I don't know why,

243
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,660
 can we put it in the big rule book.

244
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:45,460
 Is there a big rule book?

245
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,300
 - Yes.

246
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,660
 (laughing)

247
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:50,100
 - And so just going back to this loop, the loop.

248
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:50,940
 - Yeah.

249
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,220
 - So it was, did I say 12G?

250
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,460
 I think it was 12G.

251
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:56,300
 And that is pretty much as much as you can manage

252
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,660
 as a human, or that's what people thought.

253
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,980
 But then there was a guy called John Stapp,

254
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:03,980
 who decided to make himself a sled,

255
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:06,020
 which basically went really, really, really fast

256
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,700
 and then just stopped.

257
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,100
 And he wanted to see how much G-Force,

258
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,180
 the human body, will be able to stand.

259
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,420
 And this was important, it was in the 1940s,

260
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,460
 it was important because new airplanes were coming

261
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,100
 and they needed to know what people would do.

262
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,780
 And they thought that actually most people

263
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:23,620
 would maybe kind of die around sort of 12 to 15,

264
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:24,580
 something like that.

265
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:27,620
 But he managed to do 46.2G.

266
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:28,460
 - No.

267
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:29,300
 - Whoa.

268
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:34,620
 For one instant, his body weighed 7,700 pounds.

269
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:35,460
 - Whoa.

270
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,300
 - What?

271
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,140
 - Yeah.

272
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:37,980
 - Wow.

273
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,300
 - Do you know how you do it, though,

274
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:42,700
 if you ever do need to withstand huge amounts of gravity?

275
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:43,540
 - I know.

276
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:47,620
 - You, so I was reading this in a article

277
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,460
 about how jet pilots prepare for it,

278
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:51,700
 and the way they get prepared is they're put in this chamber

279
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:54,100
 at the end of a really long arm

280
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,540
 that's spinning round and round,

281
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:57,260
 and they're trained on how to deal with it.

282
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,740
 And what you do is,

283
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:01,740
 you have to strain like you're doing a poo,

284
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,380
 and you make sort of a hick sound.

285
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:05,220
 So you've got to sort of,

286
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,860
 and that prevents the blood from flowing away

287
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:07,860
 from the brain too far.

288
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,660
 So it means you can remain conscious longer.

289
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:12,460
 And the guys who can tolerate lots and lots of G-Force

290
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,060
 are called G-monsters.

291
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:14,900
 - Oh, cool.

292
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,380
 (laughing)

293
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:19,260
 I've seen that contraption.

294
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,340
 So they sit at the end, they spin round and round.

295
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,820
 I've seen it, I've seen Brian Bleser do it.

296
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,340
 Was he straining?

297
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:31,340
 - Well, no, he was training to be an astronaut in Russia,

298
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:34,900
 'cause they said they were gonna send him up to space.

299
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,820
 There's footage you can see if you wanna see it,

300
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,340
 it's on YouTube, he gets into it,

301
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,620
 and he's saying, I've been built, I've been up Everest,

302
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,740
 I'm built to last in this thing.

303
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,780
 I have a body and lungs bigger than anyone else.

304
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:45,620
 I'm amazing.

305
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,740
 And he sits inside, and it starts,

306
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,460
 and immediately he's just there going,

307
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,700
 (laughing)

308
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,860
 It's the funniest thing I've ever seen.

309
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:56,140
 It's just a terrifying blessing.

310
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:58,300
 Going at G-Force and astronaut, let's go.

311
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,580
 I go, (laughing)

312
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,300
 - But that's actually also what he looks like

313
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,780
 when he's straining on the toilet.

314
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,620
 (laughing)

315
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,060
 - Should we move on to our next facts?

316
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:09,180
 Time to go on to fact number two,

317
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,340
 and that is Andrew Hunter Murray.

318
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:14,820
 My fact is that America has a national grocery bag

319
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,860
 packing competition.

320
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:19,580
 - And this is a huge deal in America.

321
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,300
 They get crowds cheering and gathering

322
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,820
 of people film it, and it's just people

323
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:27,460
 who work at checkout till packing groceries into a bag.

324
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,300
 - That's it.

325
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,740
 - And is it to see the fastest person to do it,

326
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,580
 or the most groceries packed in a bag?

327
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:35,780
 - The criteria are so strict, I love it.

328
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:39,500
 So you all get the same stuff like you and your fellow competitors.

329
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,620
 So we would all get the same items,

330
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:44,220
 but they vary hugely in terms of weight.

331
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,700
 Some of them are fragile, some of them are very dense,

332
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,780
 and the criteria you get marked on is speed,

333
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:53,940
 but also bag building technique, style, weight distribution

334
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:56,580
 between bags, attitude, and appearance.

335
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:57,420
 - Attitude.

336
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,340
 (laughing)

337
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,820
 - But they're really strict.

338
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,820
 So one person finished really, really fast,

339
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:06,580
 but his bags weighed 17 and 21 pounds.

340
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:09,620
 And the woman who won, her bags weighed 19 and 19 pounds.

341
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:10,460
 She got it dead on.

342
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,620
 - Wow.

343
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:13,980
 - And did she know the weight of the object's pride

344
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:14,820
 of putting it in?

345
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,140
 - No, no, no, no, you're just picking her up.

346
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,940
 - Wow, you're just feeling it, smelling it.

347
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,460
 - Oh, yeah, yeah, it's so good.

348
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:22,460
 You don't need to smell it, so look how heavy it is.

349
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:23,820
 - But that would be attitude.

350
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:24,980
 That would get you attitude, boy.

351
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,340
 - That's about 12 kilos.

352
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:28,780
 (laughing)

353
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,420
 - I would draw coins for attitude

354
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:33,660
 if someone snipped my shopping all the way over here.

355
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:37,700
 - I was shocked in, I lived for three months in Kosovo

356
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,140
 'cause my grandmother was living there,

357
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,860
 and there was our local grocery store,

358
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,540
 which took an hour each time,

359
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,580
 even if you were buying like six items,

360
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,980
 'cause they didn't have any price tags on each item.

361
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,340
 So the person at the counter would pick it up

362
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:51,660
 and stare at it for ages, and never spoke out loud,

363
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:52,980
 but I could see they were going,

364
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:58,340
 "If I were a can of baked beans, how much would I be?"

365
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:00,780
 And really thought about it, and then slowly packed.

366
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,620
 So I feel like that's good attitude.

367
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:04,460
 - Yeah.

368
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:08,260
 - So there's one contestant from each state in America.

369
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,500
 There are 50 competitors out there.

370
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,700
 If there are two really good backpackers in your state,

371
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,380
 then they have to have a bag off.

372
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:17,700
 That's true.

373
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,300
 - And they call themselves bag fleets.

374
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,300
 - Oh, like athletes?

375
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,900
 - Yeah. - Bag fleets.

376
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,540
 - It doesn't quite work, does it, as wordplay?

377
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:28,780
 - If you win your store, where you work,

378
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:31,740
 your home store gets a gold plated cash register.

379
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:32,980
 - How useful.

380
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,980
 (audience laughing)

381
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:38,540
 - Oh my god.

382
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:40,140
 - It doesn't have a story, I don't know.

383
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:42,060
 - It's quite good if robbers come into the store,

384
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,340
 and they ask for all the money from the till,

385
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:45,140
 you're like, stupid robbers.

386
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:47,140
 (audience laughing)

387
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:49,340
 - But the Washington state competition

388
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:52,820
 has a guy who is called a bago whisperer.

389
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:56,540
 - Again, doesn't quite work, doesn't it?

390
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:58,780
 - But he's a store manager and he's coached

391
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:01,060
 a couple at least of successive champions.

392
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:01,900
 - Yeah.

393
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,620
 - He's not as impressive as being a horse whisper

394
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:05,220
 'cause horses don't speak English,

395
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,300
 and so it's really amazing that you could communicate

396
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,820
 with the horse, communicating with someone

397
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:09,900
 who banks shopping.

398
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:13,620
 I mean, I find that quite easy when I'm in the shop.

399
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:18,140
 Put it in the bag, look, look how she is actually

400
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,580
 putting it in the bag now.

401
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:22,580
 (audience laughing)

402
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:26,220
 - As well, so the really elite ones are called bag fleets,

403
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,860
 but actually they're all called baggers,

404
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:28,700
 aren't they?

405
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,860
 They all call themselves baggers if they do this job.

406
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,540
 And I went on to Urban Dictionary

407
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:34,700
 to find out any other meanings of the word bago.

408
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,180
 (audience laughing)

409
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,500
 - Go on.

410
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,340
 - No, just.

411
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:44,540
 A flamboyant member of the Tea Party in America

412
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,500
 is known as a baga.

413
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,620
 It's a derivative of the word tea baga,

414
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,620
 and it describes the costumes.

415
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,140
 (audience laughing)

416
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:55,140
 It describes the costumes with tea bags

417
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:57,460
 that the members were.

418
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:00,540
 But it does also say, sometimes it is used as a derogatory name

419
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:03,060
 because it also depicts a unique sexual act.

420
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,420
 (audience laughing)

421
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,420
 And you can fill in the rest yourself.

422
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,380
 (audience laughing)

423
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:11,620
 - Did you know the first time that you could bag your own stuff

424
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:12,860
 was in 1916?

425
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:15,580
 So this is the first self-service grocery store.

426
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:19,260
 So before 1916, you had to go into a shop with your shopping list

427
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,060
 and you had to give it to the person who worked in the shop

428
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:23,180
 and say, go and do my shopping for me.

429
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,620
 And then you waited for them to bring it to you,

430
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:25,780
 which was really time consuming

431
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,620
 and you needed lots of clerks to go and do it.

432
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:31,100
 So in 1916, the first self-service shop was set up

433
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,700
 what we would call just a shop.

434
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,540
 And it was called Piggly Wiggly.

435
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,100
 (audience laughing)

436
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:36,940
 Intenacy.

437
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,940
 And no one ever knew why he called it that.

438
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,940
 The founder was someone called Clarence Saunders

439
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,420
 and he launched this shop with a beauty contest

440
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:46,460
 and he gave free flowers and balloons to all the kids who came

441
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:49,460
 and he'd never explained why he called it Piggly Wiggly.

442
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,100
 - He did once.

443
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,020
 - Was this why he said he just thought it was a funny word

444
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,020
 and he would talk about it.

445
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,220
 - He got asked, yeah, why is it called Piggly Wiggly?

446
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:59,500
 And he said, so people will ask that very question.

447
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,260
 (audience laughing)

448
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:05,060
 - Sorry, so you're saying 1916 for that

449
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,940
 because I was reading in 1929,

450
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:09,660
 was in America the invention of the grocery bag

451
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:12,260
 as a paper bag.

452
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:15,420
 And it was a guy who invented it called Walter Dominaire

453
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,340
 and he woke up in the middle of the night.

454
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:19,900
 He had a vision in the middle of the night

455
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,180
 and he woke up and he went, oh, bags.

456
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:25,060
 And because he had it, he had it.

457
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,740
 - By the way, he kind of does this.

458
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:27,580
 - Yeah.

459
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:30,260
 - And then he's getting, I've got nothing to breathe into.

460
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:33,260
 (audience laughing)

461
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,620
 - Yeah, good boy.

462
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:38,180
 So he woke up, he went, he went bags

463
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:40,580
 and he woke his wife up and he said,

464
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:43,780
 bags and she, they had a shop, a grocery shop.

465
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:46,420
 And he went down with his wife early in the morning

466
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:50,980
 and his thought he had was to have these a brown paper bag

467
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:54,740
 and to punch holes in both sides to put the strings in.

468
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:55,660
 And so they did that.

469
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,700
 They put strings in so that it was handles

470
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,940
 and then that day they started selling them

471
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,660
 and people went nuts for it.

472
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:04,980
 They sold them incidentally very sort of full circle

473
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,340
 for five cents, you know.

474
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:09,740
 So it was, you bought it for what we've now returned to.

475
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:10,580
 - Oh wow.

476
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:11,420
 - Yeah.

477
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,060
 So he sold them, everyone went crazy.

478
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:15,220
 They were buying more bags and they were the actual stuff

479
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:17,780
 in the grocery store and then they ran out of bags.

480
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:20,460
 They bought more bags and then she sat there

481
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:24,180
 customizing all the bags with magazines and newspapers.

482
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:26,700
 So she cut out pictures that she thought were really nice

483
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,780
 and she stuck them to the side of each bag

484
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,100
 and just sold that.

485
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,780
 And then he filed it as a patent

486
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,740
 and he became a multi-millionaire

487
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,020
 over the next couple of years

488
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:37,700
 and they were the largest manufacturer of grocery bags

489
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,220
 in America for a very long time.

490
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,340
 I think I've made that bit up.

491
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:43,420
 But they were, that feels right, doesn't it?

492
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,300
 So that, yeah, just quickly.

493
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:48,660
 Do you know what people had before they had shopping bags?

494
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,740
 This is so cool.

495
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:53,140
 Before you had a shopping bag, some people,

496
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:56,980
 not everybody, but a lot of people had cornucopias.

497
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,580
 So you know in sort of old paintings,

498
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,460
 you have these horns of plenty

499
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:03,580
 and it's full of fruit and lobster and white grape

500
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:04,420
 and everything.

501
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,420
 People would take...

502
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,420
 Like a big horn.

503
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,140
 Like a big horn, it was wicker

504
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:11,140
 and you would take your horn of plenty to the shops.

505
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,180
 Oh, wow.

506
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:13,180
 How cool is that?

507
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,980
 Why don't we all have horns of plenty?

508
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:17,940
 Why have we been cheated from our birthright?

509
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,620
 I think we could, we could have a new business, couldn't we?

510
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:21,620
 Yes.

511
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,860
 According to Dan, this other guy made billions.

512
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:24,860
 Yeah.

513
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,860
 If we start making horns of plenty for life,

514
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:31,220
 would you buy a horn of plenty?

515
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,140
 I think if you come up with any business idea,

516
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:37,940
 starting with the phrase, according to Dan,

517
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:40,420
 you need to be really careful.

518
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,540
 Plastic bags, when they started,

519
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:44,900
 this, the marketing was so confident

520
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,620
 that it was going to change the world.

521
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,860
 This is from the Baker Light Corporation,

522
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:51,900
 who were the first people to put out plastic bags.

523
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,460
 They said, and this was literally their PR,

524
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:57,500
 that this bag had transcended the old tax...

525
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,580
 How do I say that? Taxonomy?

526
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,300
 Taxonomy. Taxonomy, thank you.

527
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:03,580
 Had, boys, goods have an added point.

528
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:06,780
 Had transcended the old taxonomy of animal mineral...

529
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:09,260
 I said, really close.

530
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:12,540
 So what's it again? Taxonomy. Taxonomy.

531
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:16,660
 Taxonomy. I mean, soft pedal it.

532
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:19,260
 Taxonomy. Yeah.

533
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:23,500
 They said it had transcended the old taxonomy of animal...

534
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,820
 CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

535
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:33,580
 That's going to be awkward to wear it with that massive cheer.

536
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:37,420
 I guess the people of Manchester just really love taxonomy.

537
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:44,060
 Darling, did Manchester invent taxonomy?

538
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:50,820
 Come on, Dad, you've got to get to the end of this.

539
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,100
 We've lost it.

540
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,500
 This will better be fucking good, Dad.

541
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,340
 Jesus.

542
00:19:56,340 --> 00:20:01,380
 The Baker Light Company said that it had transcended the old taxonomy of animal...

543
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:04,500
 CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

544
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,940
 ..of animal mineral and vegetable,

545
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:12,540
 and now we had a fourth kingdom whose boundaries are unlimited.

546
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:15,740
 That is cool. Yeah.

547
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:17,940
 OK, it is time...

548
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:21,020
 For fact, number three, and that is my fact,

549
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:26,020
 is one of the things you need to know in order to become a British citizen

550
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:30,020
 is who introduced shampoo to the UK.

551
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,660
 Oh. It's an actual thing that you get asked.

552
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,100
 And who was it?

553
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,500
 Well, his name is...

554
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,980
 Sheslow, get out.

555
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:42,060
 His name is Shakedeen Muhammad.

556
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:46,700
 He was a Bengali, Anglo-Indian traveler, inventor.

557
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:49,700
 He opened the very first curry house in the UK.

558
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,900
 It was in London.

559
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:56,940
 But he also opened up these amazing things called the shampoo baths of the UK.

560
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,980
 There was shampooing baths where you would go in.

561
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:02,100
 And it was basically a massage, and it was all sorts of oils,

562
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,620
 and it was like a spa.

563
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:04,820
 It was a bathing spa.

564
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:10,300
 And weirdly, that is a question that you get asked when you're sitting down

565
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:13,220
 to work out if you're allowed into the UK as a citizen.

566
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:15,020
 Have you seen the list of questions?

567
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:17,540
 Yeah. I mean, they're unbelievably hard, aren't they?

568
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:20,420
 Literally, no one would be able to get any of these answers.

569
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:21,220
 Yeah.

570
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:26,540
 It's like, you have to know what year was the battle of the boy just off the top of your head?

571
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:29,700
 Who's 16-80?

572
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:30,900
 Get out.

573
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,060
 16-80.

574
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,940
 I don't know when it was.

575
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:37,180
 You get out.

576
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:40,380
 I know you're going to have to carry the show from this point onwards.

577
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:43,060
 In the previous version, it was worse in the past.

578
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:46,780
 In the previous versions of the test, you needed to know 49 different websites

579
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:54,860
 and 36 telephone numbers, including the phone number for the National Academic Recognition Information Centre.

580
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:58,140
 You still need to know that there are still five telephone numbers on it,

581
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:01,140
 so they have paired it down, but you still need to know the phone numbers

582
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:03,300
 for their House of Commons.

583
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:06,500
 The Welsh Assembly, and the Scottish Parliament,

584
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:09,100
 but weirdly, in the five telephone numbers that you need to know,

585
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:12,540
 999 is not there.

586
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:18,060
 Hello, is that my MP? There's the burglar in my house.

587
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:20,580
 What like, and what are you going to do about it?

588
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:25,500
 Oh, fine. I'll ring the Welsh Assembly, if that's possible.

589
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:29,740
 I read one question that's in it. Apparently, it used to have this question.

590
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:33,060
 Suppose you spill someone's pint in the pub.

591
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,660
 What usually happens next?

592
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:37,220
 Bunch up.

593
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:38,820
 I rather think that that depends.

594
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:42,220
 The answer in London will be very different from the answer in Manchester, I think.

595
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:44,700
 What happens in Manchester?

596
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:48,100
 Well, why don't you try it tonight?

597
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:51,340
 Is it a quaint local custom that if you're a newcomer to the city,

598
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,420
 you have to spill as many people's pint as possible?

599
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:55,580
 Yeah, that's right. Okay, great.

600
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:59,100
 Any stuff on shampoo, maybe? Yeah, sure.

601
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:04,780
 This is just interesting. The word shampoo is kind of an Indian, a Hindi word,

602
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:08,340
 and it comes from "shampna" meaning "to need",

603
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:10,980
 and it comes from the same word as "chapati".

604
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:13,460
 No way. Just an interesting thing.

605
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:17,340
 I got completely distracted and I started looking at how people's hair

606
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:19,100
 and how animals clean themselves,

607
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:22,900
 because if you don't shampoo, eventually your hair gets back into a kind of balance.

608
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:25,340
 Well, actually, I tried that.

609
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:27,700
 Oh, yeah. Yeah, for QI, right?

610
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:31,180
 Yeah, for QI, I tried going six months without washing my hair.

611
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:35,140
 I remember that, and it does not work.

612
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:37,620
 And his wife was not.

613
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:42,260
 Well, this was before I was married. Actually, I was single, actually.

614
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,500
 Oh, okay. Yeah.

615
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,980
 Actually, around the same time, I read something else,

616
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:49,860
 which was that if you put an onion in your shoe and walk around,

617
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:53,220
 then by the end of the day, you'll be able to taste it in your mouth,

618
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:55,620
 and that doesn't work either.

619
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:56,620
 Wow.

620
00:23:56,620 --> 00:24:00,060
 But it does probably explain why I was single.

621
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:03,340
 Okay, there's so many reasons.

622
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:08,220
 So when a fly cleans itself, right? It combs itself.

623
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:10,820
 It sort of combs its body and it's got hairs sticking out of it.

624
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:13,420
 When they clean themselves, the particles that have gathered on them

625
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:17,860
 are catapulted off the hairs at 1,000G.

626
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,220
 What? No.

627
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:21,420
 Well, it's 1,000 times the acceleration of gravity.

628
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:22,900
 Is that G? It is, yeah.

629
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:25,260
 Probably missed time to zero or two.

630
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:28,900
 But do you know how cicadas keep themselves clean?

631
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,260
 This is so cool.

632
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:34,260
 They have, on their bodies, tiny, tiny nanoscale pin cushions

633
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:38,380
 that mean that when a bacteria bumps into them, the bacteria explodes.

634
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:39,900
 Wow.

635
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,100
 And what that cleans them through the explosion?

636
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:44,820
 Well, it doesn't clean them. It just means they don't have a bacteria on them anymore.

637
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:47,180
 That is so cool.

638
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:49,380
 Not if you're a bacteria. Sure.

639
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,900
 Yeah, no one ever speaks off of the bacteria.

640
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,380
 It was on the cicada side.

641
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:56,140
 Actually, the reason we need to wash our hair,

642
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:57,580
 I think, is quite interesting.

643
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:01,980
 It's that we have all these sebaceous glands and they create oil into our scalp

644
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:05,100
 and so it gets really oily and gross, and it's to waterproof.

645
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:08,660
 So our scalp is quite waterproof. Our face also has quite a lot of them.

646
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,100
 So that's quite waterproof.

647
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:13,660
 But we don't have any of these glands on the palms of our hands,

648
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:14,860
 or the soles of our feet.

649
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:18,700
 So if you grow hair on the palms of your hands, or the soles of your feet,

650
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:21,940
 you don't need to wash it as a consolation.

651
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:24,540
 I have hair on my feet. I've got like a hobbit feet.

652
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:31,620
 So the soles of your feet. No, the soles of your feet are hairy.

653
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,820
 Hang on, are we quibbling over what soles mean?

654
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:34,980
 I think so. Yeah.

655
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:37,060
 The bottom bit. Okay, no, yeah, yeah.

656
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:39,060
 Oh, my god.

657
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:44,900
 Okay, we should move on to our final fact.

658
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:47,020
 Do you guys ready to go to the final fact?

659
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:53,500
 Okay, it's time for a final fact of the show and that is Chazinsky.

660
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:58,460
 Yes, my fact is that if your metabolism was as fast as a hummingbirds,

661
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:03,460
 you'd need to drink a can of coke every minute to stay alive.

662
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:04,380
 Wow.

663
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:09,820
 It's this hummingbirds have the most incredible metabolisms that we can't imagine.

664
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:13,900
 So they've processed sugars so fast that they need to drink one,

665
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,980
 12 ounce can of fizzy drink.

666
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:18,140
 No, no, the equivalent of.

667
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:20,300
 Sorry. Yeah.

668
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:25,580
 We're just seeing a poor hummingbird get back to its nest with a 16 pack of coke.

669
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:29,420
 Then quarter of an hour later, I'll back to the bloody shops.

670
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:33,980
 But that is if we had to have the equivalent to survive,

671
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:39,420
 then we'd be eating or drinking 202,000 calories a day.

672
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:41,260
 We'd have to eat to stay alive.

673
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:44,460
 So they have to visit 2,000 flowers a day. It's a lot.

674
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:48,380
 Yeah, I read that I read 1,500 flowers on them, obviously,

675
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:52,060
 another website every day. And what I liked about that is it's approximately

676
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:54,540
 the same number as there are Greg's in the UK.

677
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:57,580
 The human flower.

678
00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:05,180
 But what I worked out is with all the calories that they get and everything like that.

679
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:09,180
 If you were a hummingbird, it's the equivalent of going to every Greg's in the UK

680
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:11,740
 and eating half a steak bake in everyone.

681
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:15,900
 Coincidentally, I've never managed more than half of a steak bake.

682
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,780
 Yeah. Am I a hummingbird?

683
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:20,140
 No. Wow.

684
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:22,300
 I mean, hummingbird hearts are so cool.

685
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:26,700
 They beat ten times a second, and that's quite slow for a hummingbird,

686
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:29,900
 despite being the size of a rubber on the end of a pencil.

687
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,660
 What? That's the size of hummingbirds.

688
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:33,020
 No, the heart, just the heart.

689
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:34,860
 Oh, sorry.

690
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:37,580
 But they're small though.

691
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:39,260
 They are small, they're not.

692
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:41,180
 They're not six-foot tall animals with hearts,

693
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:43,500
 the size of a rubber on the end of a pencil.

694
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:47,580
 They would be fainting all the time.

695
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:55,340
 But so the heart beats up to 1,200 beats a minute, which is very fast.

696
00:27:55,340 --> 00:28:00,700
 But even when they're resting, it's 500, and as a result,

697
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:03,100
 at night, just to prevent themselves from dying overnight,

698
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:05,340
 basically every night they go into a coma,

699
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:07,900
 and their heart slows down to 50 beats a minute.

700
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,260
 It's still pretty fast.

701
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,300
 It's like hibernation.

702
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,500
 It's like hibernation.

703
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,700
 They literally every night.

704
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,700
 And you can prod them and they won't wake up.

705
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:15,820
 Obviously don't.

706
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:17,900
 LAUGHTER

707
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:18,780
 Yeah, but yeah.

708
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:22,300
 They also, just all the figures that you read about hummingbirds,

709
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,740
 you really have to think about in process.

710
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:28,140
 So their wings flap up to a hundred times a second.

711
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:31,340
 Yeah, that is completely insane.

712
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:34,300
 And as I read it, I think I must have written it wrong.

713
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,580
 Yeah, but you haven't.

714
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,340
 I read it in the National Geographic,

715
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,020
 and so I should say, by the way,

716
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:41,260
 that this came from an amazing article on hummingbirds

717
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:43,340
 from the National Geographic sometime in the last year,

718
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:45,260
 so you can't get it anymore, but it was really good.

719
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:47,020
 But that's, I mean...

720
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:48,860
 Something quite cool, though, researchers have done,

721
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:51,180
 to work out what their visual perception is like,

722
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:56,060
 is they worked out how they respond to optical illusions.

723
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:57,740
 So this, again, was in the National Geographic,

724
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:59,820
 and they got one of those optical illusions

725
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:02,460
 that is a spiral of black stripe

726
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,940
 with white stripes in between it.

727
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:06,060
 And when you spin that round,

728
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:07,740
 it looks like it's moving away from you.

729
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:10,380
 And they put a test tube full of hummingbird food

730
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:11,420
 sticking out of it.

731
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,860
 And so the hummingbird gets its beak in,

732
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:14,460
 and it's got its little fork tongue

733
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,060
 that drinks from the test tube.

734
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:18,220
 And then, when they start spinning the spiral,

735
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:20,220
 the hummingbird, just like humans do,

736
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:22,220
 thinks that the spiral's moving away from them,

737
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,420
 and because they can fly backwards,

738
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:25,420
 they reverse out of the test tube,

739
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:26,140
 because they're like...

740
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,740
 Sorry, they think it's moving towards them.

741
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:29,180
 So they reverse out of the test tube.

742
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:33,100
 So they do have the same eyesight as we do,

743
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,940
 and also, they're kind of idiots.

744
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,460
 They get backing away from their food.

745
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:40,300
 They've got really interesting legs as well.

746
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:43,740
 Basically, they've got almost like display legs

747
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,140
 in that they're attached to them,

748
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:48,780
 but they can't walk on them, so they land,

749
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:51,020
 and they can't walk, and they can't hop.

750
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:53,820
 So they're just there for like standing purposes.

751
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:55,180
 What do they do?

752
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:56,780
 They can do a sideways thing.

753
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:59,420
 You know, when they can like, so like...

754
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:01,100
 Oh, no, no, no, no.

755
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,220
 Because I don't know how to describe it.

756
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:04,380
 But, you know, so like, they'll like land on a branch,

757
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:05,420
 and then they'll just be like...

758
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:07,820
 Hello, Steve.

759
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:12,060
 A shuffle. For anyone who's listening to the podcast,

760
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:15,180
 and shuffled sideways, that was the word he couldn't think of,

761
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,540
 so he had to stand up.

762
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:19,180
 Can I just say as well, for them, that's called a lec,

763
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:20,380
 and it's a mating dance.

764
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:22,540
 And I can kind of...

765
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:23,900
 Well, I'm not sure I can see my...

766
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,020
 I can't see that.

767
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,060
 Tell me, I met my wife.

768
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:27,900
 Hey, I didn't.

769
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,900
 That's the...

770
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,100
 Yeah, that's how they...

771
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:35,020
 And they do that on a stick attached to a tree, a branch.

772
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,300
 They do that on a stick attached.

773
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:43,100
 Their mating only takes half a second to begin to go end.

774
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:43,980
 What do you mean only?

775
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:49,740
 And the courting only takes a few seconds as well.

776
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:50,380
 And they dive...

777
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:53,820
 Yeah, they do, don't they, to impress women,

778
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:56,780
 they go up higher than they dive at 60 miles an hour down,

779
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:59,020
 and they also make chirping sounds.

780
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:03,100
 They tweet, but not with their mouths, with their feathers.

781
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:05,340
 So all hummingbirds make different chirping sounds,

782
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:07,020
 and it sounds exactly like bird tweeting,

783
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:09,100
 but they're doing it with their tail feathers.

784
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:13,660
 So it's when they swoop the way that they vibrate as they go through the air,

785
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:15,580
 makes a certain noise, and it's really beautiful.

786
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:16,940
 And as a Smithsonian put it,

787
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:20,380
 imagine if you could sing with your ponytail or your beard.

788
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:23,420
 That is what it's like to be a hummingbird.

789
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,460
 That's pretty cool.

790
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:27,900
 And that singing towards it just kind of sounds like a chirp, right?

791
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,820
 It is a nice chirp, but it's just a chirp.

792
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:32,540
 But if you slow it down and play it into a computer,

793
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:36,060
 they can hear real levels of complexity that humans can't hear.

794
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,740
 - Levels of complexity? - Yeah.

795
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:38,780
 Like what?

796
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:41,180
 Please, I just want to stop drinking coke.

797
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:43,820
 God, just let me slow down.

798
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:51,500
 So there is only one known piece of DNA in vertebrates

799
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,820
 with the ability to taste sweetness,

800
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:55,500
 and hummingbirds don't have it.

801
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:58,860
 So even though they're drinking all this nectar stuff,

802
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:00,540
 we don't think they can taste sweetness.

803
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:03,500
 Oh, really? Yeah, it's tragic.

804
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:07,500
 I think there's a theory, though, that they modified.

805
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,260
 So we have a bunch of taste receptors.

806
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:14,860
 We all know now sweet, salty, a bit sour, and umami.

807
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:17,820
 And as we all agree, umami is the kind of pointless weird one.

808
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:20,620
 - It's like savory, isn't it? - Yeah, savory.

809
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:22,860
 And they actually think that hummingbirds have adapted

810
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:26,620
 their umami gland, and that's evolved to taste sweetness over the years.

811
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:30,300
 Which what that might mean is when they're going around tasting all these flowers

812
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:33,420
 1500 times, it actually tastes like a Greg steak bake.

813
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:39,580
 Did you structure this whole part of the book?

814
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:41,020
 I'll stick on my ground to that.

815
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:47,260
 So they've got really, um, fast metabolism, don't they?

816
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:51,260
 And I was trying to work out the other end of metabolism,

817
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:56,140
 super slow metabolism, and slots have extremely slow metabolism.

818
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,140
 And obviously, we know them as a very slow animal.

819
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:03,260
 So they, yeah, they have an extraordinarily slow metabolism.

820
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:07,260
 But um, they, so I started just, this is very off topic,

821
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:09,020
 but I started reading about slots, because I thought,

822
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:11,100
 why are they moving so slow and what goes on?

823
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:14,060
 It turns out, I think they're meant to be water-based animals,

824
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:18,140
 rather than in the trees, because when you put a slot in water,

825
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:23,420
 it can swim three times as fast as it can move when it's outside of water,

826
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:27,900
 and it can hold its breath for over 40 minutes underwater.

827
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:28,540
 Wow.

828
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:30,700
 Which is 20 minutes longer than a dolphin.

829
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:31,900
 What?

830
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:32,940
 Yeah.

831
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:33,740
 That is amazing.

832
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:36,620
 And they're just stuck up there on that stick attached to a tree.

833
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:37,180
 Yeah, it's like...

834
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:45,180
 Okay, that's it.

835
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:46,860
 That is all of our facts.

836
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,380
 Thank you so much for listening.

837
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:50,860
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us about the things

838
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:53,100
 that we have said over the course of this podcast,

839
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,020
 we can be found on our Twitter accounts.

840
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:56,460
 I'm on @Streiberland.

841
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:57,020
 Andy.

842
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:58,060
 @AndryHunterM.

843
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:58,620
 James.

844
00:33:58,620 --> 00:33:59,740
 @JamesHarkin.

845
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:00,540
 And Shazinsky.

846
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:02,780
 You can email podcast@ky.com.

847
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:05,180
 Yep, or you can get us on our group account,

848
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:07,500
 which is @nosuchthing, or you can go to our website.

849
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:10,860
 Nosuchthing is a fish.com, where we have all of our previous episodes.

850
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:13,500
 We also have a link to our book, The Book of the Year,

851
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:17,420
 which we're about to give a copy away to someone in the audience here,

852
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:20,780
 live at our Manchester audience, because we asked them to send in the fact,

853
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:22,620
 Andy, you've got the winning fact.

854
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:23,820
 I certainly have done it.

855
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:25,500
 It's just on my phone, which is turning on,

856
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:28,060
 so I'd like you to fill for about 15 seconds, please.

857
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:30,220
 (Laughter)

858
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:31,100
 Thank you.

859
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:33,340
 Okay, picture... Right, I've got it. I've got it.

860
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,380
 I've got it.

861
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:35,180
 All right.

862
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:37,100
 (Laughter)

863
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:40,220
 Okay, this is today's winning fact.

864
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:42,540
 It's from Evie Hull.

865
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:45,820
 In 1993, Sam Francisco held a referendum

866
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:48,860
 over whether police officer Bob Geary was allowed to patrol

867
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:52,700
 while carrying a ventriloquist dummy called Brendan O'Smarty.

868
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:56,380
 (Laughter)

869
00:34:56,380 --> 00:35:01,980
 All right, we're going to have your copy of the book out there.

870
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:05,020
 Guys, we're going to be out at the back with our book of the year.

871
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:08,060
 If you want to buy a copy, we're going to be signing copies out there.

872
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:09,580
 Please come and say hi.

873
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:11,100
 Thank you, Manchester.

874
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,860
 That was awesome.

875
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,220
