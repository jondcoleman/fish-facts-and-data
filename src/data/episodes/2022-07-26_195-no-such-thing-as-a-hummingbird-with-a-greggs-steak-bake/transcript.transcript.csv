00:00:00,00:00:02,(phone ringing)
00:00:02,00:00:05,(speaking in foreign language)
00:00:05,00:00:07,(lively music)
00:00:07,00:00:18,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:00:18,00:00:21,"of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast"
00:00:21,00:00:24,this week coming to you live from Manchester!
00:00:24,00:00:27,(audience cheering)
00:00:27,00:00:30,(audience cheering)
00:00:30,00:00:36,- My name is Dan Schreiber and I'm sitting here
00:00:36,00:00:40,"with Anich Zinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin."
00:00:40,00:00:42,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:42,00:00:45,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days
00:00:45,00:00:48,"and in a particular order, here we go."
00:00:48,00:00:50,"Starting with you, James Harkin."
00:00:50,00:00:53,"- Okay, my fact this week is that the first loop,"
00:00:53,00:00:55,the loop roller coaster closed
00:00:55,00:00:58,because so many riders were passing out.
00:00:58,00:01:01,(laughing)
00:01:01,00:01:03,"- Oh, that's the end of the show!"
00:01:03,00:01:05,(laughing)
00:01:05,00:01:07,"- They were passing out, they were passing out."
00:01:07,00:01:10,"This was, so it was on Coney Island, it was in 1901"
00:01:10,00:01:12,"and what it was, it was a loop, the loop."
00:01:12,00:01:13,"I don't know if you would notice this today,"
00:01:13,00:01:15,"if you look at a loop, the loop, they're not circular,"
00:01:15,00:01:18,they're kind of like elliptical things.
00:01:18,00:01:20,"And the reason is, if you have a circular loop, the loop,"
00:01:20,00:01:22,it basically kills you.
00:01:22,00:01:23,(laughing)
00:01:23,00:01:24,Really?
00:01:24,00:01:26,"- Yeah, this one, it's called the Coney Flip Flap"
00:01:26,00:01:29,"and it was giving people, it was,"
00:01:29,00:01:30,(laughing)
00:01:30,00:01:32,it's that rude in Manchester.
00:01:32,00:01:33,- No!
00:01:33,00:01:37,- So the Coney Flip Flap produced 12 G's
00:01:37,00:01:38,of gravitational force.
00:01:38,00:01:40,"- How, how, what is that?"
00:01:40,00:01:42,"- That's, I think, that's a lot."
00:01:42,00:01:44,"- It's about 9G, it's like the maximum"
00:01:44,00:01:48,"that like air jet pilots, fighter pilots ever go up to?"
00:01:48,00:01:49,"- Oh my god, exactly."
00:01:49,00:01:52,"So the biggest, the craziest roller coaster today,"
00:01:52,00:01:53,I think is 6G.
00:01:53,00:01:56,And this was 12 G.
00:01:56,00:01:59,"I mean, it just, basically, you went on it"
00:01:59,00:02:00,"and more often than not, you passed out"
00:02:00,00:02:02,or you got wet plash or whatever.
00:02:02,00:02:05,And they made more money charging spectators
00:02:05,00:02:07,to watch the frighten riders.
00:02:07,00:02:09,(laughing)
00:02:09,00:02:12,- You just put on someone you don't like.
00:02:12,00:02:14,"Oh no, I've bought you the ticket, go on mate,"
00:02:14,00:02:15,you take it.
00:02:15,00:02:16,I'll see you in a bit.
00:02:16,00:02:18,"- That is so funny, right?"
00:02:18,00:02:20,"- I actually read, and I've only just noticed,"
00:02:20,00:02:23,"this is the case, looking at the year in my notes."
00:02:23,00:02:27,But there was a roller coaster in France in 1846
00:02:27,00:02:31,"that did have a loop, but it was just a cart on a track."
00:02:31,00:02:33,But it went fast enough to have a loop there.
00:02:33,00:02:34,"And there were lots of reports about it,"
00:02:34,00:02:37,but people who operated like fairgrounds
00:02:37,00:02:39,or the equivalent then were prone to exaggeration.
00:02:39,00:02:42,"So first of all, all the new stories at the time"
00:02:42,00:02:45,"reported it as going at 150 miles per hour,"
00:02:45,00:02:48,which is as fast as the fastest roller coaster today.
00:02:48,00:02:49,So that's impressive.
00:02:49,00:02:53,"They tested it at the time using sound bags, eggs, and monkeys."
00:02:53,00:02:58,"And, but yeah, apparently they had loops up to 12 meters high,"
00:02:58,00:03:01,"I read in a book called The Incredible Screen Machine,"
00:03:01,00:03:04,but the book also points out that the makers were prone
00:03:04,00:03:05,to massive exaggeration.
00:03:05,00:03:09,They could snap riders next.
00:03:09,00:03:10,- That is bad.
00:03:10,00:03:11,- It put people off.
00:03:11,00:03:12,(laughing)
00:03:12,00:03:14,- You don't want the photo to be going off
00:03:14,00:03:16,just at that moment that you're next up to you.
00:03:16,00:03:18,(laughing)
00:03:18,00:03:20,- You get barrism as the least of your worries at that moment.
00:03:20,00:03:21,(laughing)
00:03:21,00:03:23,"- And those, I think the French ones,"
00:03:23,00:03:26,"it was just, it was a one person loop the loop."
00:03:26,00:03:28,So it was just you in the sled.
00:03:28,00:03:30,"You go down the thing, loop the loop, your neck breaks,"
00:03:30,00:03:32,and then the next person comes in.
00:03:32,00:03:34,- The next person still gets on.
00:03:34,00:03:36,(laughing)
00:03:36,00:03:37,- This is a really cool thing.
00:03:37,00:03:39,"Okay, so Coney Island, they had a load of roller coasters"
00:03:39,00:03:41,"and one of the first ever ones, I think it was called"
00:03:41,00:03:45,"the Switchback, and it was founded by a women's underwear"
00:03:45,00:03:47,magnet called Lamarca's Thompson.
00:03:47,00:03:48,- Yeah.
00:03:48,00:03:50,"- And it was a moral mission, 'cause Coney Island was full"
00:03:50,00:03:55,of alcohol and other immoral attractions.
00:03:55,00:03:58,"- I really struggled not to say the word prostitutes there,"
00:03:58,00:03:59,"didn't I, but."
00:03:59,00:04:00,(laughing)
00:04:00,00:04:02,- It's crazy you avoided it though.
00:04:02,00:04:04,(laughing)
00:04:04,00:04:08,"- And he made a roller coaster, but the thing about it was,"
00:04:08,00:04:11,"it went at 10 miles an hour, which is not especially first,"
00:04:11,00:04:12,and it had to be hand pushed.
00:04:12,00:04:15,"So, you would get, workers would push it to the top"
00:04:15,00:04:18,"of the first hill, everyone gets on, it then goes down"
00:04:18,00:04:20,"to the big slide and then slides along a bit and then stops,"
00:04:20,00:04:23,"everyone gets off, workers have to push it to the top"
00:04:23,00:04:25,"of the next hill, everyone gets back on again."
00:04:25,00:04:26,- Oh wow.
00:04:26,00:04:28,- Did you say it was an underwear magnet though?
00:04:28,00:04:29,- Yeah.
00:04:29,00:04:30,"- And it was a moral mission, 'cause I would have thought"
00:04:30,00:04:32,"that actually, saying about roller coasters,"
00:04:32,00:04:34,"it was an extremely good way to advertise your underwear,"
00:04:34,00:04:34,isn't it?
00:04:34,00:04:38,Because the way it works off when it's on display.
00:04:38,00:04:40,"- So, I don't think I've, I don't think I've,"
00:04:40,00:04:43,"I think I missed that one at Thorpe Park, isn't it?"
00:04:43,00:04:44,(laughing)
00:04:44,00:04:45,- What?
00:04:45,00:04:47,Where have you been taken?
00:04:47,00:04:49,"- I just, my mum used to dangle me out the window"
00:04:49,00:04:51,by my ankles and then tell me we were two people.
00:04:51,00:04:52,- Yeah.
00:04:52,00:04:54,"This guy, Lamarcus Thompson is his name."
00:04:54,00:04:55,He was the inventor of it.
00:04:55,00:04:57,"And as Andy's saying, it was about morals,"
00:04:57,00:05:01,"but specifically, he invented it to stop people"
00:05:01,00:05:04,"from being tempted by Satan, specifically."
00:05:04,00:05:07,"So, he was worried that Satan would get people,"
00:05:07,00:05:08,and he thought this roller coaster
00:05:08,00:05:09,would bring them back to Jesus.
00:05:09,00:05:12,That was genuinely the idea behind the invention
00:05:12,00:05:14,of the Coney Island roller coasters.
00:05:14,00:05:15,- That's cool.
00:05:15,00:05:19,"So, another licentious kind of theme park."
00:05:19,00:05:21,This one hasn't actually opened yet.
00:05:21,00:05:24,"There was, there were hoping to open it this year in Brazil,"
00:05:24,00:05:26,but they haven't opened it because of the political problems
00:05:26,00:05:28,"there and the financial problems,"
00:05:28,00:05:30,but it is a sex themed amusement park
00:05:30,00:05:32,called Enrotica Land.
00:05:32,00:05:35,"Okay, it had penis shaped dodgyms."
00:05:35,00:05:37,"- Oh, but one should be a penis shape"
00:05:37,00:05:39,"and one should be a vagina shape, right?"
00:05:39,00:05:42,"So, when you crash, it's like, oh, that's sexy."
00:05:42,00:05:44,(audience laughing)
00:05:44,00:05:45,Is that sexy?
00:05:45,00:05:49,"- James, ""Aderotica Land,"" everything is sexy."
00:05:49,00:05:51,- And the locals were really worried
00:05:51,00:05:53,"and they thought that maybe, like all of the people"
00:05:53,00:05:55,going to this theme park would just end up having sex
00:05:55,00:05:57,all the time.
00:05:57,00:06:00,"But the guy who was behind the project, Moro Marata,"
00:06:00,00:06:03,said that no one would be having sex in this theme park.
00:06:03,00:06:05,But if attendees do want to take things
00:06:05,00:06:08,"to another level, they can go to a nearby motel,"
00:06:08,00:06:09,which we will operate.
00:06:09,00:06:11,(audience laughing)
00:06:11,00:06:14,"- You know, the king of roller coasters,"
00:06:14,00:06:16,the great lord of roller coaster design
00:06:16,00:06:18,is a guy called Ron Tumor.
00:06:18,00:06:20,"He died a couple of years ago, I think in 2011,"
00:06:20,00:06:23,but he couldn't go on roller coasters himself.
00:06:23,00:06:26,"So he got extreme motion sickness,"
00:06:26,00:06:27,but he's the person who's pioneered
00:06:27,00:06:29,"every roller coaster design, you know,"
00:06:29,00:06:33,"any kind of spin, loop, the loops, all that kind of stuff."
00:06:33,00:06:35,"And he himself said, riding roller coasters"
00:06:35,00:06:38,never really appealed to me.
00:06:38,00:06:40,I rode once or twice and that was enough for me
00:06:40,00:06:42,to get a general idea of what it felt like.
00:06:42,00:06:43,- Wow.
00:06:43,00:06:45,- And then he designed like 93 roller coasters.
00:06:45,00:06:47,And he also designed a heat shield
00:06:47,00:06:49,for the Apollo spacecraft missions.
00:06:49,00:06:50,- No.
00:06:50,00:06:51,"- Yeah, sure did."
00:06:51,00:06:52,"- Wow, wow."
00:06:52,00:06:54,- Have you heard of a guy called Richard Rodriguez?
00:06:54,00:06:55,- No. - He's so cool.
00:06:55,00:06:57,"So he has spent his whole life,"
00:06:57,00:07:01,"pretty much on roller coasters, i.e. in 2007,"
00:07:01,00:07:04,he spent 17 consecutive days and nights
00:07:04,00:07:06,in blackpool on a roller coaster.
00:07:06,00:07:09,"- 17 days, he slept on there, he ate on there."
00:07:09,00:07:11,"He took a five minute break every hour,"
00:07:11,00:07:13,just a shower or go to the Lou.
00:07:13,00:07:16,"- Well throw up, presumably."
00:07:16,00:07:18,- But he's been doing this since 1977.
00:07:18,00:07:19,- Wow.
00:07:19,00:07:20,- And he keeps on breaking his own record.
00:07:20,00:07:23,"In 1977, he did four days in Coney Island."
00:07:23,00:07:25,And he trained himself by sticking his head out
00:07:25,00:07:27,of a car window for hours on end.
00:07:27,00:07:29,(laughing)
00:07:29,00:07:30,Like a dog.
00:07:30,00:07:32,- Do you know what the oldest
00:07:32,00:07:34,operating roller coaster is?
00:07:34,00:07:35,The oldest continually operating one.
00:07:35,00:07:36,- No.
00:07:36,00:07:38,"- Is, and the only reason I mention this"
00:07:38,00:07:39,is that I used to live in Melbourne
00:07:39,00:07:42,and I went on this with my mum and we went on it
00:07:42,00:07:44,"and we came off and said that is the most painful,"
00:07:44,00:07:46,uncomfortable experience of either of our lives.
00:07:46,00:07:47,And it's because it's a roller coaster
00:07:47,00:07:49,that's over a hundred years old
00:07:49,00:07:50,and no one's ever done anything to it.
00:07:50,00:07:52,It's in Luna Park in Melbourne.
00:07:52,00:07:52,- Oh yeah.
00:07:52,00:07:54,- And it's been continuously running
00:07:54,00:07:56,since I think about 1905.
00:07:56,00:07:58,But it's a horrible experience.
00:07:58,00:08:00,- Is it because your skirt was at the entire time?
00:08:00,00:08:01,(laughing)
00:08:01,00:08:03,"- In a few years ago, thought park,"
00:08:03,00:08:06,they asked the public for donations of their own urine
00:08:06,00:08:07,to help make an authentic smell
00:08:07,00:08:10,for their new horror movie themed ride.
00:08:10,00:08:13,(laughing)
00:08:13,00:08:15,"And if you have strong feelings about that,"
00:08:15,00:08:17,you can just send your own donation
00:08:17,00:08:18,to the park management.
00:08:18,00:08:20,(laughing)
00:08:20,00:08:21,- Would they just gonna spray it in the air
00:08:21,00:08:22,to give it a sense?
00:08:22,00:08:23,- I don't know.
00:08:23,00:08:25,"- I think it was a publicity stunt, to be honest."
00:08:25,00:08:26,- There must be rules about that.
00:08:26,00:08:28,- Although who would write the rules?
00:08:28,00:08:29,(laughing)
00:08:29,00:08:30,- I would think of past that.
00:08:30,00:08:31,- Yeah.
00:08:31,00:08:32,- Is somewhere going.
00:08:32,00:08:34,"- I know it seems really far-fetched,"
00:08:34,00:08:35,but I just want to write this rule
00:08:35,00:08:38,'cause I reckon just possibly someone's gonna ask
00:08:38,00:08:40,for the public urine from all the coasters.
00:08:40,00:08:41,"I know it seems niche, I don't know why,"
00:08:41,00:08:43,can we put it in the big rule book.
00:08:43,00:08:45,Is there a big rule book?
00:08:45,00:08:46,- Yes.
00:08:46,00:08:47,(laughing)
00:08:47,00:08:50,"- And so just going back to this loop, the loop."
00:08:50,00:08:50,- Yeah.
00:08:50,00:08:52,"- So it was, did I say 12G?"
00:08:52,00:08:53,I think it was 12G.
00:08:53,00:08:56,And that is pretty much as much as you can manage
00:08:56,00:08:58,"as a human, or that's what people thought."
00:08:58,00:09:00,"But then there was a guy called John Stapp,"
00:09:00,00:09:03,"who decided to make himself a sled,"
00:09:03,00:09:06,"which basically went really, really, really fast"
00:09:06,00:09:07,and then just stopped.
00:09:07,00:09:10,"And he wanted to see how much G-Force,"
00:09:10,00:09:12,"the human body, will be able to stand."
00:09:12,00:09:14,"And this was important, it was in the 1940s,"
00:09:14,00:09:16,it was important because new airplanes were coming
00:09:16,00:09:18,and they needed to know what people would do.
00:09:18,00:09:19,And they thought that actually most people
00:09:19,00:09:23,"would maybe kind of die around sort of 12 to 15,"
00:09:23,00:09:24,something like that.
00:09:24,00:09:27,But he managed to do 46.2G.
00:09:27,00:09:28,- No.
00:09:28,00:09:29,- Whoa.
00:09:29,00:09:34,"For one instant, his body weighed 7,700 pounds."
00:09:34,00:09:35,- Whoa.
00:09:35,00:09:36,- What?
00:09:36,00:09:37,- Yeah.
00:09:37,00:09:37,- Wow.
00:09:37,00:09:39,"- Do you know how you do it, though,"
00:09:39,00:09:42,if you ever do need to withstand huge amounts of gravity?
00:09:42,00:09:43,- I know.
00:09:43,00:09:47,"- You, so I was reading this in a article"
00:09:47,00:09:49,"about how jet pilots prepare for it,"
00:09:49,00:09:51,and the way they get prepared is they're put in this chamber
00:09:51,00:09:54,at the end of a really long arm
00:09:54,00:09:55,"that's spinning round and round,"
00:09:55,00:09:57,and they're trained on how to deal with it.
00:09:57,00:09:58,"And what you do is,"
00:09:58,00:10:01,"you have to strain like you're doing a poo,"
00:10:01,00:10:03,and you make sort of a hick sound.
00:10:03,00:10:05,"So you've got to sort of,"
00:10:05,00:10:06,and that prevents the blood from flowing away
00:10:06,00:10:07,from the brain too far.
00:10:07,00:10:09,So it means you can remain conscious longer.
00:10:09,00:10:12,And the guys who can tolerate lots and lots of G-Force
00:10:12,00:10:14,are called G-monsters.
00:10:14,00:10:14,"- Oh, cool."
00:10:14,00:10:16,(laughing)
00:10:16,00:10:19,I've seen that contraption.
00:10:19,00:10:21,"So they sit at the end, they spin round and round."
00:10:21,00:10:23,"I've seen it, I've seen Brian Bleser do it."
00:10:23,00:10:26,Was he straining?
00:10:26,00:10:31,"- Well, no, he was training to be an astronaut in Russia,"
00:10:31,00:10:34,'cause they said they were gonna send him up to space.
00:10:34,00:10:36,"There's footage you can see if you wanna see it,"
00:10:36,00:10:38,"it's on YouTube, he gets into it,"
00:10:38,00:10:40,"and he's saying, I've been built, I've been up Everest,"
00:10:40,00:10:42,I'm built to last in this thing.
00:10:42,00:10:44,I have a body and lungs bigger than anyone else.
00:10:44,00:10:45,I'm amazing.
00:10:45,00:10:47,"And he sits inside, and it starts,"
00:10:47,00:10:49,"and immediately he's just there going,"
00:10:49,00:10:51,(laughing)
00:10:51,00:10:53,It's the funniest thing I've ever seen.
00:10:53,00:10:56,It's just a terrifying blessing.
00:10:56,00:10:58,"Going at G-Force and astronaut, let's go."
00:10:58,00:11:00,"I go, (laughing)"
00:11:00,00:11:02,- But that's actually also what he looks like
00:11:02,00:11:03,when he's straining on the toilet.
00:11:03,00:11:05,(laughing)
00:11:05,00:11:07,- Should we move on to our next facts?
00:11:07,00:11:09,"Time to go on to fact number two,"
00:11:09,00:11:11,and that is Andrew Hunter Murray.
00:11:11,00:11:14,My fact is that America has a national grocery bag
00:11:14,00:11:16,packing competition.
00:11:16,00:11:19,- And this is a huge deal in America.
00:11:19,00:11:21,They get crowds cheering and gathering
00:11:21,00:11:23,"of people film it, and it's just people"
00:11:23,00:11:27,who work at checkout till packing groceries into a bag.
00:11:27,00:11:28,- That's it.
00:11:28,00:11:30,"- And is it to see the fastest person to do it,"
00:11:30,00:11:32,or the most groceries packed in a bag?
00:11:32,00:11:35,"- The criteria are so strict, I love it."
00:11:35,00:11:39,So you all get the same stuff like you and your fellow competitors.
00:11:39,00:11:41,"So we would all get the same items,"
00:11:41,00:11:44,but they vary hugely in terms of weight.
00:11:44,00:11:46,"Some of them are fragile, some of them are very dense,"
00:11:46,00:11:49,"and the criteria you get marked on is speed,"
00:11:49,00:11:53,"but also bag building technique, style, weight distribution"
00:11:53,00:11:56,"between bags, attitude, and appearance."
00:11:56,00:11:57,- Attitude.
00:11:57,00:11:59,(laughing)
00:11:59,00:12:00,- But they're really strict.
00:12:00,00:12:03,"So one person finished really, really fast,"
00:12:03,00:12:06,but his bags weighed 17 and 21 pounds.
00:12:06,00:12:09,"And the woman who won, her bags weighed 19 and 19 pounds."
00:12:09,00:12:10,She got it dead on.
00:12:10,00:12:11,- Wow.
00:12:11,00:12:13,- And did she know the weight of the object's pride
00:12:13,00:12:14,of putting it in?
00:12:14,00:12:16,"- No, no, no, no, you're just picking her up."
00:12:16,00:12:17,"- Wow, you're just feeling it, smelling it."
00:12:17,00:12:19,"- Oh, yeah, yeah, it's so good."
00:12:19,00:12:22,"You don't need to smell it, so look how heavy it is."
00:12:22,00:12:23,- But that would be attitude.
00:12:23,00:12:24,"That would get you attitude, boy."
00:12:24,00:12:26,- That's about 12 kilos.
00:12:26,00:12:28,(laughing)
00:12:28,00:12:30,- I would draw coins for attitude
00:12:30,00:12:33,if someone snipped my shopping all the way over here.
00:12:33,00:12:37,"- I was shocked in, I lived for three months in Kosovo"
00:12:37,00:12:39,"'cause my grandmother was living there,"
00:12:39,00:12:40,"and there was our local grocery store,"
00:12:40,00:12:42,"which took an hour each time,"
00:12:42,00:12:44,"even if you were buying like six items,"
00:12:44,00:12:46,'cause they didn't have any price tags on each item.
00:12:46,00:12:49,So the person at the counter would pick it up
00:12:49,00:12:51,"and stare at it for ages, and never spoke out loud,"
00:12:51,00:12:52,"but I could see they were going,"
00:12:52,00:12:58,"""If I were a can of baked beans, how much would I be?"""
00:12:58,00:13:00,"And really thought about it, and then slowly packed."
00:13:00,00:13:03,So I feel like that's good attitude.
00:13:03,00:13:04,- Yeah.
00:13:04,00:13:08,- So there's one contestant from each state in America.
00:13:08,00:13:10,There are 50 competitors out there.
00:13:10,00:13:13,"If there are two really good backpackers in your state,"
00:13:13,00:13:15,then they have to have a bag off.
00:13:15,00:13:17,That's true.
00:13:17,00:13:20,- And they call themselves bag fleets.
00:13:20,00:13:21,"- Oh, like athletes?"
00:13:21,00:13:22,- Yeah. - Bag fleets.
00:13:22,00:13:25,"- It doesn't quite work, does it, as wordplay?"
00:13:25,00:13:28,"- If you win your store, where you work,"
00:13:28,00:13:31,your home store gets a gold plated cash register.
00:13:31,00:13:32,- How useful.
00:13:32,00:13:35,(audience laughing)
00:13:35,00:13:38,- Oh my god.
00:13:38,00:13:40,"- It doesn't have a story, I don't know."
00:13:40,00:13:42,"- It's quite good if robbers come into the store,"
00:13:42,00:13:43,"and they ask for all the money from the till,"
00:13:43,00:13:45,"you're like, stupid robbers."
00:13:45,00:13:47,(audience laughing)
00:13:47,00:13:49,- But the Washington state competition
00:13:49,00:13:52,has a guy who is called a bago whisperer.
00:13:52,00:13:56,"- Again, doesn't quite work, doesn't it?"
00:13:56,00:13:58,- But he's a store manager and he's coached
00:13:58,00:14:01,a couple at least of successive champions.
00:14:01,00:14:01,- Yeah.
00:14:01,00:14:03,- He's not as impressive as being a horse whisper
00:14:03,00:14:05,"'cause horses don't speak English,"
00:14:05,00:14:07,and so it's really amazing that you could communicate
00:14:07,00:14:08,"with the horse, communicating with someone"
00:14:08,00:14:09,who banks shopping.
00:14:09,00:14:13,"I mean, I find that quite easy when I'm in the shop."
00:14:15,00:14:18,"Put it in the bag, look, look how she is actually"
00:14:18,00:14:19,putting it in the bag now.
00:14:19,00:14:22,(audience laughing)
00:14:22,00:14:26,"- As well, so the really elite ones are called bag fleets,"
00:14:26,00:14:27,"but actually they're all called baggers,"
00:14:27,00:14:28,aren't they?
00:14:28,00:14:30,They all call themselves baggers if they do this job.
00:14:30,00:14:32,And I went on to Urban Dictionary
00:14:32,00:14:34,to find out any other meanings of the word bago.
00:14:34,00:14:37,(audience laughing)
00:14:37,00:14:38,- Go on.
00:14:38,00:14:39,"- No, just."
00:14:39,00:14:44,A flamboyant member of the Tea Party in America
00:14:44,00:14:46,is known as a baga.
00:14:46,00:14:48,"It's a derivative of the word tea baga,"
00:14:48,00:14:50,and it describes the costumes.
00:14:50,00:14:52,(audience laughing)
00:14:52,00:14:55,It describes the costumes with tea bags
00:14:55,00:14:57,that the members were.
00:14:57,00:15:00,"But it does also say, sometimes it is used as a derogatory name"
00:15:00,00:15:03,because it also depicts a unique sexual act.
00:15:03,00:15:04,(audience laughing)
00:15:04,00:15:06,And you can fill in the rest yourself.
00:15:06,00:15:07,(audience laughing)
00:15:07,00:15:11,- Did you know the first time that you could bag your own stuff
00:15:11,00:15:12,was in 1916?
00:15:12,00:15:15,So this is the first self-service grocery store.
00:15:15,00:15:19,"So before 1916, you had to go into a shop with your shopping list"
00:15:19,00:15:21,and you had to give it to the person who worked in the shop
00:15:21,00:15:23,"and say, go and do my shopping for me."
00:15:23,00:15:24,"And then you waited for them to bring it to you,"
00:15:24,00:15:25,which was really time consuming
00:15:25,00:15:27,and you needed lots of clerks to go and do it.
00:15:27,00:15:31,"So in 1916, the first self-service shop was set up"
00:15:31,00:15:32,what we would call just a shop.
00:15:32,00:15:34,And it was called Piggly Wiggly.
00:15:34,00:15:36,(audience laughing)
00:15:36,00:15:36,Intenacy.
00:15:36,00:15:38,And no one ever knew why he called it that.
00:15:38,00:15:40,The founder was someone called Clarence Saunders
00:15:40,00:15:43,and he launched this shop with a beauty contest
00:15:43,00:15:46,and he gave free flowers and balloons to all the kids who came
00:15:46,00:15:49,and he'd never explained why he called it Piggly Wiggly.
00:15:49,00:15:51,- He did once.
00:15:51,00:15:53,- Was this why he said he just thought it was a funny word
00:15:53,00:15:54,and he would talk about it.
00:15:54,00:15:56,"- He got asked, yeah, why is it called Piggly Wiggly?"
00:15:56,00:15:59,"And he said, so people will ask that very question."
00:15:59,00:16:02,(audience laughing)
00:16:02,00:16:05,"- Sorry, so you're saying 1916 for that"
00:16:05,00:16:06,"because I was reading in 1929,"
00:16:06,00:16:09,was in America the invention of the grocery bag
00:16:09,00:16:12,as a paper bag.
00:16:12,00:16:15,And it was a guy who invented it called Walter Dominaire
00:16:15,00:16:17,and he woke up in the middle of the night.
00:16:17,00:16:19,He had a vision in the middle of the night
00:16:19,00:16:22,"and he woke up and he went, oh, bags."
00:16:22,00:16:25,"And because he had it, he had it."
00:16:25,00:16:26,"- By the way, he kind of does this."
00:16:26,00:16:27,- Yeah.
00:16:27,00:16:30,"- And then he's getting, I've got nothing to breathe into."
00:16:30,00:16:33,(audience laughing)
00:16:33,00:16:35,"- Yeah, good boy."
00:16:35,00:16:38,"So he woke up, he went, he went bags"
00:16:38,00:16:40,"and he woke his wife up and he said,"
00:16:40,00:16:43,"bags and she, they had a shop, a grocery shop."
00:16:43,00:16:46,And he went down with his wife early in the morning
00:16:46,00:16:50,and his thought he had was to have these a brown paper bag
00:16:50,00:16:54,and to punch holes in both sides to put the strings in.
00:16:54,00:16:55,And so they did that.
00:16:55,00:16:57,They put strings in so that it was handles
00:16:57,00:16:59,and then that day they started selling them
00:16:59,00:17:01,and people went nuts for it.
00:17:01,00:17:04,They sold them incidentally very sort of full circle
00:17:04,00:17:06,"for five cents, you know."
00:17:06,00:17:09,"So it was, you bought it for what we've now returned to."
00:17:09,00:17:10,- Oh wow.
00:17:10,00:17:11,- Yeah.
00:17:11,00:17:13,"So he sold them, everyone went crazy."
00:17:13,00:17:15,They were buying more bags and they were the actual stuff
00:17:15,00:17:17,in the grocery store and then they ran out of bags.
00:17:17,00:17:20,They bought more bags and then she sat there
00:17:20,00:17:24,customizing all the bags with magazines and newspapers.
00:17:24,00:17:26,So she cut out pictures that she thought were really nice
00:17:26,00:17:28,and she stuck them to the side of each bag
00:17:28,00:17:30,and just sold that.
00:17:30,00:17:31,And then he filed it as a patent
00:17:31,00:17:33,and he became a multi-millionaire
00:17:33,00:17:35,over the next couple of years
00:17:35,00:17:37,and they were the largest manufacturer of grocery bags
00:17:37,00:17:39,in America for a very long time.
00:17:39,00:17:40,I think I've made that bit up.
00:17:40,00:17:43,"But they were, that feels right, doesn't it?"
00:17:43,00:17:45,"So that, yeah, just quickly."
00:17:45,00:17:48,Do you know what people had before they had shopping bags?
00:17:48,00:17:50,This is so cool.
00:17:50,00:17:53,"Before you had a shopping bag, some people,"
00:17:53,00:17:56,"not everybody, but a lot of people had cornucopias."
00:17:56,00:17:58,"So you know in sort of old paintings,"
00:17:58,00:18:00,you have these horns of plenty
00:18:00,00:18:03,and it's full of fruit and lobster and white grape
00:18:03,00:18:04,and everything.
00:18:04,00:18:05,People would take...
00:18:05,00:18:06,Like a big horn.
00:18:06,00:18:08,"Like a big horn, it was wicker"
00:18:08,00:18:11,and you would take your horn of plenty to the shops.
00:18:11,00:18:12,"Oh, wow."
00:18:12,00:18:13,How cool is that?
00:18:13,00:18:14,Why don't we all have horns of plenty?
00:18:14,00:18:17,Why have we been cheated from our birthright?
00:18:17,00:18:20,"I think we could, we could have a new business, couldn't we?"
00:18:20,00:18:21,Yes.
00:18:21,00:18:23,"According to Dan, this other guy made billions."
00:18:23,00:18:24,Yeah.
00:18:24,00:18:26,"If we start making horns of plenty for life,"
00:18:26,00:18:31,would you buy a horn of plenty?
00:18:33,00:18:35,"I think if you come up with any business idea,"
00:18:35,00:18:37,"starting with the phrase, according to Dan,"
00:18:37,00:18:40,you need to be really careful.
00:18:40,00:18:42,"Plastic bags, when they started,"
00:18:42,00:18:44,"this, the marketing was so confident"
00:18:44,00:18:46,that it was going to change the world.
00:18:46,00:18:48,"This is from the Baker Light Corporation,"
00:18:48,00:18:51,who were the first people to put out plastic bags.
00:18:51,00:18:54,"They said, and this was literally their PR,"
00:18:54,00:18:57,that this bag had transcended the old tax...
00:18:57,00:18:58,How do I say that? Taxonomy?
00:18:58,00:19:00,"Taxonomy. Taxonomy, thank you."
00:19:00,00:19:03,"Had, boys, goods have an added point."
00:19:03,00:19:06,Had transcended the old taxonomy of animal mineral...
00:19:06,00:19:09,"I said, really close."
00:19:09,00:19:12,So what's it again? Taxonomy. Taxonomy.
00:19:12,00:19:16,"Taxonomy. I mean, soft pedal it."
00:19:16,00:19:19,Taxonomy. Yeah.
00:19:19,00:19:23,They said it had transcended the old taxonomy of animal...
00:19:23,00:19:25,CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
00:19:25,00:19:33,That's going to be awkward to wear it with that massive cheer.
00:19:33,00:19:37,I guess the people of Manchester just really love taxonomy.
00:19:37,00:19:44,"Darling, did Manchester invent taxonomy?"
00:19:44,00:19:50,"Come on, Dad, you've got to get to the end of this."
00:19:50,00:19:52,We've lost it.
00:19:52,00:19:54,"This will better be fucking good, Dad."
00:19:54,00:19:56,Jesus.
00:19:56,00:20:01,The Baker Light Company said that it had transcended the old taxonomy of animal...
00:20:01,00:20:04,CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
00:20:04,00:20:06,"..of animal mineral and vegetable,"
00:20:06,00:20:12,and now we had a fourth kingdom whose boundaries are unlimited.
00:20:12,00:20:15,That is cool. Yeah.
00:20:15,00:20:17,"OK, it is time..."
00:20:17,00:20:21,"For fact, number three, and that is my fact,"
00:20:21,00:20:26,is one of the things you need to know in order to become a British citizen
00:20:26,00:20:30,is who introduced shampoo to the UK.
00:20:30,00:20:32,Oh. It's an actual thing that you get asked.
00:20:32,00:20:34,And who was it?
00:20:34,00:20:35,"Well, his name is..."
00:20:35,00:20:37,"Sheslow, get out."
00:20:37,00:20:42,His name is Shakedeen Muhammad.
00:20:42,00:20:46,"He was a Bengali, Anglo-Indian traveler, inventor."
00:20:46,00:20:49,He opened the very first curry house in the UK.
00:20:49,00:20:51,It was in London.
00:20:51,00:20:56,But he also opened up these amazing things called the shampoo baths of the UK.
00:20:56,00:20:58,There was shampooing baths where you would go in.
00:20:58,00:21:02,"And it was basically a massage, and it was all sorts of oils,"
00:21:02,00:21:03,and it was like a spa.
00:21:03,00:21:04,It was a bathing spa.
00:21:04,00:21:10,"And weirdly, that is a question that you get asked when you're sitting down"
00:21:10,00:21:13,to work out if you're allowed into the UK as a citizen.
00:21:13,00:21:15,Have you seen the list of questions?
00:21:15,00:21:17,"Yeah. I mean, they're unbelievably hard, aren't they?"
00:21:17,00:21:20,"Literally, no one would be able to get any of these answers."
00:21:20,00:21:21,Yeah.
00:21:21,00:21:26,"It's like, you have to know what year was the battle of the boy just off the top of your head?"
00:21:26,00:21:29,Who's 16-80?
00:21:29,00:21:30,Get out.
00:21:30,00:21:33,16-80.
00:21:33,00:21:34,I don't know when it was.
00:21:34,00:21:37,You get out.
00:21:37,00:21:40,I know you're going to have to carry the show from this point onwards.
00:21:40,00:21:43,"In the previous version, it was worse in the past."
00:21:43,00:21:46,"In the previous versions of the test, you needed to know 49 different websites"
00:21:46,00:21:54,"and 36 telephone numbers, including the phone number for the National Academic Recognition Information Centre."
00:21:54,00:21:58,"You still need to know that there are still five telephone numbers on it,"
00:21:58,00:22:01,"so they have paired it down, but you still need to know the phone numbers"
00:22:01,00:22:03,for their House of Commons.
00:22:03,00:22:06,"The Welsh Assembly, and the Scottish Parliament,"
00:22:06,00:22:09,"but weirdly, in the five telephone numbers that you need to know,"
00:22:09,00:22:12,999 is not there.
00:22:12,00:22:18,"Hello, is that my MP? There's the burglar in my house."
00:22:18,00:22:20,"What like, and what are you going to do about it?"
00:22:20,00:22:25,"Oh, fine. I'll ring the Welsh Assembly, if that's possible."
00:22:25,00:22:29,"I read one question that's in it. Apparently, it used to have this question."
00:22:29,00:22:33,Suppose you spill someone's pint in the pub.
00:22:33,00:22:34,What usually happens next?
00:22:34,00:22:37,Bunch up.
00:22:37,00:22:38,I rather think that that depends.
00:22:38,00:22:42,"The answer in London will be very different from the answer in Manchester, I think."
00:22:42,00:22:44,What happens in Manchester?
00:22:44,00:22:48,"Well, why don't you try it tonight?"
00:22:48,00:22:51,"Is it a quaint local custom that if you're a newcomer to the city,"
00:22:51,00:22:53,you have to spill as many people's pint as possible?
00:22:53,00:22:55,"Yeah, that's right. Okay, great."
00:22:55,00:22:59,"Any stuff on shampoo, maybe? Yeah, sure."
00:22:59,00:23:04,"This is just interesting. The word shampoo is kind of an Indian, a Hindi word,"
00:23:04,00:23:08,"and it comes from ""shampna"" meaning ""to need"","
00:23:08,00:23:10,"and it comes from the same word as ""chapati""."
00:23:10,00:23:13,No way. Just an interesting thing.
00:23:13,00:23:17,I got completely distracted and I started looking at how people's hair
00:23:17,00:23:19,"and how animals clean themselves,"
00:23:19,00:23:22,"because if you don't shampoo, eventually your hair gets back into a kind of balance."
00:23:22,00:23:25,"Well, actually, I tried that."
00:23:25,00:23:27,"Oh, yeah. Yeah, for QI, right?"
00:23:27,00:23:31,"Yeah, for QI, I tried going six months without washing my hair."
00:23:31,00:23:35,"I remember that, and it does not work."
00:23:35,00:23:37,And his wife was not.
00:23:37,00:23:42,"Well, this was before I was married. Actually, I was single, actually."
00:23:42,00:23:43,"Oh, okay. Yeah."
00:23:43,00:23:45,"Actually, around the same time, I read something else,"
00:23:45,00:23:49,"which was that if you put an onion in your shoe and walk around,"
00:23:49,00:23:53,"then by the end of the day, you'll be able to taste it in your mouth,"
00:23:53,00:23:55,and that doesn't work either.
00:23:55,00:23:56,Wow.
00:23:56,00:24:00,But it does probably explain why I was single.
00:24:00,00:24:03,"Okay, there's so many reasons."
00:24:03,00:24:08,"So when a fly cleans itself, right? It combs itself."
00:24:08,00:24:10,It sort of combs its body and it's got hairs sticking out of it.
00:24:10,00:24:13,"When they clean themselves, the particles that have gathered on them"
00:24:13,00:24:17,"are catapulted off the hairs at 1,000G."
00:24:17,00:24:19,What? No.
00:24:19,00:24:21,"Well, it's 1,000 times the acceleration of gravity."
00:24:21,00:24:22,"Is that G? It is, yeah."
00:24:22,00:24:25,Probably missed time to zero or two.
00:24:25,00:24:28,But do you know how cicadas keep themselves clean?
00:24:28,00:24:30,This is so cool.
00:24:30,00:24:34,"They have, on their bodies, tiny, tiny nanoscale pin cushions"
00:24:34,00:24:38,"that mean that when a bacteria bumps into them, the bacteria explodes."
00:24:38,00:24:39,Wow.
00:24:39,00:24:42,And what that cleans them through the explosion?
00:24:42,00:24:44,"Well, it doesn't clean them. It just means they don't have a bacteria on them anymore."
00:24:44,00:24:47,That is so cool.
00:24:47,00:24:49,Not if you're a bacteria. Sure.
00:24:49,00:24:51,"Yeah, no one ever speaks off of the bacteria."
00:24:51,00:24:53,It was on the cicada side.
00:24:53,00:24:56,"Actually, the reason we need to wash our hair,"
00:24:56,00:24:57,"I think, is quite interesting."
00:24:57,00:25:01,It's that we have all these sebaceous glands and they create oil into our scalp
00:25:01,00:25:05,"and so it gets really oily and gross, and it's to waterproof."
00:25:05,00:25:08,So our scalp is quite waterproof. Our face also has quite a lot of them.
00:25:08,00:25:10,So that's quite waterproof.
00:25:10,00:25:13,"But we don't have any of these glands on the palms of our hands,"
00:25:13,00:25:14,or the soles of our feet.
00:25:14,00:25:18,"So if you grow hair on the palms of your hands, or the soles of your feet,"
00:25:18,00:25:21,you don't need to wash it as a consolation.
00:25:21,00:25:24,I have hair on my feet. I've got like a hobbit feet.
00:25:24,00:25:31,"So the soles of your feet. No, the soles of your feet are hairy."
00:25:31,00:25:33,"Hang on, are we quibbling over what soles mean?"
00:25:33,00:25:34,I think so. Yeah.
00:25:34,00:25:37,"The bottom bit. Okay, no, yeah, yeah."
00:25:37,00:25:39,"Oh, my god."
00:25:39,00:25:44,"Okay, we should move on to our final fact."
00:25:44,00:25:47,Do you guys ready to go to the final fact?
00:25:47,00:25:53,"Okay, it's time for a final fact of the show and that is Chazinsky."
00:25:53,00:25:58,"Yes, my fact is that if your metabolism was as fast as a hummingbirds,"
00:25:58,00:26:03,you'd need to drink a can of coke every minute to stay alive.
00:26:03,00:26:04,Wow.
00:26:04,00:26:09,It's this hummingbirds have the most incredible metabolisms that we can't imagine.
00:26:09,00:26:13,"So they've processed sugars so fast that they need to drink one,"
00:26:13,00:26:15,12 ounce can of fizzy drink.
00:26:15,00:26:18,"No, no, the equivalent of."
00:26:18,00:26:20,Sorry. Yeah.
00:26:20,00:26:25,We're just seeing a poor hummingbird get back to its nest with a 16 pack of coke.
00:26:25,00:26:29,"Then quarter of an hour later, I'll back to the bloody shops."
00:26:29,00:26:33,"But that is if we had to have the equivalent to survive,"
00:26:33,00:26:39,"then we'd be eating or drinking 202,000 calories a day."
00:26:39,00:26:41,We'd have to eat to stay alive.
00:26:41,00:26:44,"So they have to visit 2,000 flowers a day. It's a lot."
00:26:44,00:26:48,"Yeah, I read that I read 1,500 flowers on them, obviously,"
00:26:48,00:26:52,another website every day. And what I liked about that is it's approximately
00:26:52,00:26:54,the same number as there are Greg's in the UK.
00:26:54,00:26:57,The human flower.
00:26:57,00:27:05,But what I worked out is with all the calories that they get and everything like that.
00:27:05,00:27:09,"If you were a hummingbird, it's the equivalent of going to every Greg's in the UK"
00:27:09,00:27:11,and eating half a steak bake in everyone.
00:27:11,00:27:15,"Coincidentally, I've never managed more than half of a steak bake."
00:27:15,00:27:18,Yeah. Am I a hummingbird?
00:27:18,00:27:20,No. Wow.
00:27:20,00:27:22,"I mean, hummingbird hearts are so cool."
00:27:22,00:27:26,"They beat ten times a second, and that's quite slow for a hummingbird,"
00:27:26,00:27:29,despite being the size of a rubber on the end of a pencil.
00:27:29,00:27:31,What? That's the size of hummingbirds.
00:27:31,00:27:33,"No, the heart, just the heart."
00:27:33,00:27:34,"Oh, sorry."
00:27:34,00:27:37,But they're small though.
00:27:37,00:27:39,"They are small, they're not."
00:27:39,00:27:41,"They're not six-foot tall animals with hearts,"
00:27:41,00:27:43,the size of a rubber on the end of a pencil.
00:27:43,00:27:47,They would be fainting all the time.
00:27:47,00:27:55,"But so the heart beats up to 1,200 beats a minute, which is very fast."
00:27:55,00:28:00,"But even when they're resting, it's 500, and as a result,"
00:28:00,00:28:03,"at night, just to prevent themselves from dying overnight,"
00:28:03,00:28:05,"basically every night they go into a coma,"
00:28:05,00:28:07,and their heart slows down to 50 beats a minute.
00:28:07,00:28:09,It's still pretty fast.
00:28:09,00:28:10,It's like hibernation.
00:28:10,00:28:11,It's like hibernation.
00:28:11,00:28:12,They literally every night.
00:28:12,00:28:14,And you can prod them and they won't wake up.
00:28:14,00:28:15,Obviously don't.
00:28:15,00:28:17,LAUGHTER
00:28:17,00:28:18,"Yeah, but yeah."
00:28:18,00:28:22,"They also, just all the figures that you read about hummingbirds,"
00:28:22,00:28:23,you really have to think about in process.
00:28:23,00:28:28,So their wings flap up to a hundred times a second.
00:28:28,00:28:31,"Yeah, that is completely insane."
00:28:31,00:28:34,"And as I read it, I think I must have written it wrong."
00:28:34,00:28:35,"Yeah, but you haven't."
00:28:35,00:28:37,"I read it in the National Geographic,"
00:28:37,00:28:39,"and so I should say, by the way,"
00:28:39,00:28:41,that this came from an amazing article on hummingbirds
00:28:41,00:28:43,"from the National Geographic sometime in the last year,"
00:28:43,00:28:45,"so you can't get it anymore, but it was really good."
00:28:45,00:28:47,"But that's, I mean..."
00:28:47,00:28:48,"Something quite cool, though, researchers have done,"
00:28:48,00:28:51,"to work out what their visual perception is like,"
00:28:51,00:28:56,is they worked out how they respond to optical illusions.
00:28:56,00:28:57,"So this, again, was in the National Geographic,"
00:28:57,00:28:59,and they got one of those optical illusions
00:28:59,00:29:02,that is a spiral of black stripe
00:29:02,00:29:04,with white stripes in between it.
00:29:04,00:29:06,"And when you spin that round,"
00:29:06,00:29:07,it looks like it's moving away from you.
00:29:07,00:29:10,And they put a test tube full of hummingbird food
00:29:10,00:29:11,sticking out of it.
00:29:11,00:29:12,"And so the hummingbird gets its beak in,"
00:29:12,00:29:14,and it's got its little fork tongue
00:29:14,00:29:16,that drinks from the test tube.
00:29:16,00:29:18,"And then, when they start spinning the spiral,"
00:29:18,00:29:20,"the hummingbird, just like humans do,"
00:29:20,00:29:22,"thinks that the spiral's moving away from them,"
00:29:22,00:29:23,"and because they can fly backwards,"
00:29:23,00:29:25,"they reverse out of the test tube,"
00:29:25,00:29:26,because they're like...
00:29:26,00:29:27,"Sorry, they think it's moving towards them."
00:29:27,00:29:29,So they reverse out of the test tube.
00:29:29,00:29:33,"So they do have the same eyesight as we do,"
00:29:33,00:29:34,"and also, they're kind of idiots."
00:29:34,00:29:36,They get backing away from their food.
00:29:38,00:29:40,They've got really interesting legs as well.
00:29:40,00:29:43,"Basically, they've got almost like display legs"
00:29:43,00:29:46,"in that they're attached to them,"
00:29:46,00:29:48,"but they can't walk on them, so they land,"
00:29:48,00:29:51,"and they can't walk, and they can't hop."
00:29:51,00:29:53,So they're just there for like standing purposes.
00:29:53,00:29:55,What do they do?
00:29:55,00:29:56,They can do a sideways thing.
00:29:56,00:29:59,"You know, when they can like, so like..."
00:29:59,00:30:01,"Oh, no, no, no, no."
00:30:01,00:30:02,Because I don't know how to describe it.
00:30:02,00:30:04,"But, you know, so like, they'll like land on a branch,"
00:30:04,00:30:05,and then they'll just be like...
00:30:06,00:30:07,"Hello, Steve."
00:30:07,00:30:12,"A shuffle. For anyone who's listening to the podcast,"
00:30:12,00:30:15,"and shuffled sideways, that was the word he couldn't think of,"
00:30:15,00:30:16,so he had to stand up.
00:30:16,00:30:19,"Can I just say as well, for them, that's called a lec,"
00:30:19,00:30:20,and it's a mating dance.
00:30:20,00:30:22,And I can kind of...
00:30:22,00:30:23,"Well, I'm not sure I can see my..."
00:30:23,00:30:25,I can't see that.
00:30:25,00:30:26,"Tell me, I met my wife."
00:30:26,00:30:27,"Hey, I didn't."
00:30:27,00:30:29,That's the...
00:30:29,00:30:31,"Yeah, that's how they..."
00:30:31,00:30:35,"And they do that on a stick attached to a tree, a branch."
00:30:35,00:30:36,They do that on a stick attached.
00:30:36,00:30:43,Their mating only takes half a second to begin to go end.
00:30:43,00:30:43,What do you mean only?
00:30:43,00:30:49,And the courting only takes a few seconds as well.
00:30:49,00:30:50,And they dive...
00:30:50,00:30:53,"Yeah, they do, don't they, to impress women,"
00:30:53,00:30:56,"they go up higher than they dive at 60 miles an hour down,"
00:30:56,00:30:59,and they also make chirping sounds.
00:30:59,00:31:03,"They tweet, but not with their mouths, with their feathers."
00:31:03,00:31:05,"So all hummingbirds make different chirping sounds,"
00:31:05,00:31:07,"and it sounds exactly like bird tweeting,"
00:31:07,00:31:09,but they're doing it with their tail feathers.
00:31:09,00:31:13,"So it's when they swoop the way that they vibrate as they go through the air,"
00:31:13,00:31:15,"makes a certain noise, and it's really beautiful."
00:31:15,00:31:16,"And as a Smithsonian put it,"
00:31:16,00:31:20,imagine if you could sing with your ponytail or your beard.
00:31:20,00:31:23,That is what it's like to be a hummingbird.
00:31:23,00:31:24,That's pretty cool.
00:31:24,00:31:27,"And that singing towards it just kind of sounds like a chirp, right?"
00:31:27,00:31:29,"It is a nice chirp, but it's just a chirp."
00:31:29,00:31:32,"But if you slow it down and play it into a computer,"
00:31:32,00:31:36,they can hear real levels of complexity that humans can't hear.
00:31:36,00:31:37,- Levels of complexity? - Yeah.
00:31:37,00:31:38,Like what?
00:31:38,00:31:41,"Please, I just want to stop drinking coke."
00:31:41,00:31:43,"God, just let me slow down."
00:31:43,00:31:51,So there is only one known piece of DNA in vertebrates
00:31:51,00:31:53,"with the ability to taste sweetness,"
00:31:53,00:31:55,and hummingbirds don't have it.
00:31:55,00:31:58,"So even though they're drinking all this nectar stuff,"
00:31:58,00:32:00,we don't think they can taste sweetness.
00:32:01,00:32:03,"Oh, really? Yeah, it's tragic."
00:32:03,00:32:07,"I think there's a theory, though, that they modified."
00:32:07,00:32:09,So we have a bunch of taste receptors.
00:32:09,00:32:14,"We all know now sweet, salty, a bit sour, and umami."
00:32:14,00:32:17,"And as we all agree, umami is the kind of pointless weird one."
00:32:17,00:32:20,"- It's like savory, isn't it? - Yeah, savory."
00:32:20,00:32:22,And they actually think that hummingbirds have adapted
00:32:22,00:32:26,"their umami gland, and that's evolved to taste sweetness over the years."
00:32:26,00:32:30,Which what that might mean is when they're going around tasting all these flowers
00:32:30,00:32:33,"1500 times, it actually tastes like a Greg steak bake."
00:32:33,00:32:39,Did you structure this whole part of the book?
00:32:39,00:32:41,I'll stick on my ground to that.
00:32:41,00:32:47,"So they've got really, um, fast metabolism, don't they?"
00:32:47,00:32:51,"And I was trying to work out the other end of metabolism,"
00:32:51,00:32:56,"super slow metabolism, and slots have extremely slow metabolism."
00:32:56,00:32:58,"And obviously, we know them as a very slow animal."
00:32:58,00:33:03,"So they, yeah, they have an extraordinarily slow metabolism."
00:33:03,00:33:07,"But um, they, so I started just, this is very off topic,"
00:33:07,00:33:09,"but I started reading about slots, because I thought,"
00:33:09,00:33:11,why are they moving so slow and what goes on?
00:33:11,00:33:14,"It turns out, I think they're meant to be water-based animals,"
00:33:14,00:33:18,"rather than in the trees, because when you put a slot in water,"
00:33:18,00:33:23,"it can swim three times as fast as it can move when it's outside of water,"
00:33:23,00:33:27,and it can hold its breath for over 40 minutes underwater.
00:33:27,00:33:28,Wow.
00:33:28,00:33:30,Which is 20 minutes longer than a dolphin.
00:33:30,00:33:31,What?
00:33:31,00:33:32,Yeah.
00:33:32,00:33:33,That is amazing.
00:33:33,00:33:36,And they're just stuck up there on that stick attached to a tree.
00:33:36,00:33:37,"Yeah, it's like..."
00:33:37,00:33:45,"Okay, that's it."
00:33:45,00:33:46,That is all of our facts.

00:34:13,00:34:17,"which we're about to give a copy away to someone in the audience here,"
00:34:17,00:34:20,"live at our Manchester audience, because we asked them to send in the fact,"
00:34:20,00:34:22,"Andy, you've got the winning fact."
00:34:22,00:34:23,I certainly have done it.
00:34:23,00:34:25,"It's just on my phone, which is turning on,"
00:34:25,00:34:28,"so I'd like you to fill for about 15 seconds, please."
00:34:28,00:34:30,(Laughter)
00:34:30,00:34:31,Thank you.
00:34:31,00:34:33,"Okay, picture... Right, I've got it. I've got it."
00:34:33,00:34:34,I've got it.
00:34:34,00:34:35,All right.
00:34:35,00:34:37,(Laughter)
00:34:37,00:34:40,"Okay, this is today's winning fact."
00:34:40,00:34:42,It's from Evie Hull.
00:34:42,00:34:45,"In 1993, Sam Francisco held a referendum"
00:34:45,00:34:48,over whether police officer Bob Geary was allowed to patrol
00:34:48,00:34:52,while carrying a ventriloquist dummy called Brendan O'Smarty.
00:34:52,00:34:56,(Laughter)
00:34:56,00:35:01,"All right, we're going to have your copy of the book out there."
00:35:01,00:35:05,"Guys, we're going to be out at the back with our book of the year."
00:35:05,00:35:08,"If you want to buy a copy, we're going to be signing copies out there."
00:35:08,00:35:09,Please come and say hi.
00:35:09,00:35:11,"Thank you, Manchester."
00:35:11,00:35:12,That was awesome.
