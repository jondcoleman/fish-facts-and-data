1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:16,340
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

3
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:17,880
 of No Such Thing as a Fish,

4
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:22,180
 a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Hoburn.

5
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:23,320
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

6
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,480
 I am sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,760
 and Anna Tyshinski.

8
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,080
 And once again, we have gathered

9
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,400
 around the microphones with our four favorite facts

10
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,760
 from the last seven days.

11
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:36,080
 And in no particular order, here we go.

12
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:39,080
 Starting with fact number one, and that is James.

13
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,080
 - Okay, my fact this week is that the komaru

14
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,480
 is the only species that gets better at reproducing

15
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,600
 when it has been struck by lightning.

16
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,800
 (laughing)

17
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,440
 - It's quite cartoonish the way you've made it sound.

18
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,280
 - Yeah.

19
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,760
 - Like the lightning goes in, it goes (sneezes)

20
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,920
 and then it's better at reproducing, right?

21
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,440
 Get your minds out of the gutter of people at home

22
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,320
 because the komaru is a type of tree.

23
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:07,320
 It is a, well, specifically the tonka bean tree.

24
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,360
 And a load of scientists have been looking

25
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,160
 at lightning strikes in Panama

26
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,920
 and they've looked at all the different trees

27
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,760
 that have been struck.

28
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,680
 And actually it's over a 40 year period

29
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,800
 that they've done this.

30
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,040
 And they found that if you're a tree,

31
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,480
 you're substantially more likely to die

32
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,440
 if you live next to a tonka bean tree.

33
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,280
 - Yeah.

34
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,280
 - And it's because they get struck by lightning a lot.

35
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,720
 And when they get struck by lightning,

36
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,240
 the lightning sort of bounces off them

37
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,720
 and goes to these other trees and kills these trees.

38
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,560
 - It's crazy.

39
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,440
 - They also have parasites, sort of vines and stuff on them.

40
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,040
 And the lightning kills those vines as well.

41
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,800
 And as a result, when they've been struck by lightning

42
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,640
 a number of times,

43
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:49,800
 they have a 14 fold increase in lifetime seed production.

44
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,640
 So they create more seeds when they've been struck by lightning

45
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,000
 because they get rid of all the competition and stuff.

46
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,920
 And that makes it better for them to reproduce.

47
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,760
 - It's amazing as well

48
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,400
 'cause there must be a lot of these trees.

49
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,440
 It's not like it's just a single tree out there, right?

50
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,280
 There's tons, but within its own lifetime,

51
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,160
 after maturity will be struck

52
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,760
 by at least five different bolts of lightning.

53
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,280
 I mean, that's insane.

54
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,480
 Yeah, five times.

55
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,080
 - Also imagine having one child

56
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,080
 and then you're struck by lightning

57
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,840
 and then you have 14 children.

58
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,680
 - Yeah.

59
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,520
 - That's very stressful.

60
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,840
 - You mean that's what's going on?

61
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,600
 - Well, James was just saying they're 14 times

62
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,360
 more romantically successful.

63
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,240
 - It's bad enough being struck by lightning,

64
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,520
 but then if you have to look after a lot of kids afterwards.

65
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,360
 - I see.

66
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,200
 Even worse.

67
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,200
 - Salt in the wound.

68
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,040
 - Exactly.

69
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,000
 Fortunately trees are very, very, very bad parents

70
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,840
 in general.

71
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,600
 - They just had their hands off on me.

72
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,280
 (all laughing)

73
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,360
 - They're big old trees as well.

74
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,600
 130 feet, they can get up to, I mean, these are gigantic.

75
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,360
 - Which makes them more likely to be struck by lightning

76
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,440
 of course, 'cause they're often the tallest tree

77
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,280
 in the canopy.

78
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,120
 - Yeah.

79
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:47,960
 It's strange, isn't it?

80
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,640
 'Cause lots of trees, when they're hit by lightning,

81
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,840
 I think we might've said this in the past,

82
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,520
 they will explode.

83
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,360
 - Oh yeah.

84
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,560
 - And that's 'cause the temperature just gets so hot

85
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,960
 inside and they explode.

86
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,760
 - 'Cause they have water in there and the water expands

87
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,360
 because it's heated up so much.

88
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,200
 - Exactly.

89
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,480
 And there's this theory that the...

90
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,320
 Is it Kumaru?

91
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,960
 Is it Kumaru, Kumaru?

92
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,440
 - Well, I'm gonna call it a Kumaru

93
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,160
 because I find that a funny word.

94
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,000
 - And that's your right.

95
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,840
 It's your right.

96
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,680
 (all laughing)

97
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,720
 - It's Kumaru.

98
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,560
 - Kumaru, okay.

99
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,720
 There's this theory that these trees have

100
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,600
 really high internal conductivity,

101
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,560
 so they're like a wire already almost.

102
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,880
 So that means that the lightning can flow through them

103
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,080
 without building up that massive blasting heat inside,

104
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:30,920
 which will kill it.

105
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,360
 Which is very, I mean, presumably that's evolved.

106
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,200
 - Yeah.

107
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,040
 - Yeah.

108
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,880
 - Yeah.

109
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,720
 - Hasn't everything.

110
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,960
 - That's a solid point, yeah.

111
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,560
 - Do you know who's most likely to get struck

112
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,400
 by lightning?

113
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,520
 What outdoor activity?

114
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,600
 - Oh, so I would say golfers.

115
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,440
 - Andy, you always talk about golf, honestly.

116
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,440
 - The ladder carrying championships of Estonia.

117
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,960
 (all laughing)

118
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,800
 - Very risky at all.

119
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,480
 - The Tonka Bean climbing championships in Panama.

120
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,840
 There is a common misconception that golfers

121
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,000
 are the most likely to be struck by lightning

122
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,640
 because they are outside.

123
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,480
 - Metal rods.

124
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,000
 - Metal rods, big metal golf clubs,

125
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,640
 and they're holding with them.

126
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,760
 But there has been a study and they found

127
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,480
 the most common is football, actually.

128
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,320
 - Oh, really?

129
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,880
 - And the reason being that people will carry on playing

130
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,840
 football, that soccer I'm talking about,

131
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,520
 and they'll carry on playing in bad weather.

132
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,080
 - Whereas golfers are just looking for an excuse

133
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,920
 to go inside and drink a beer, aren't they?

134
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,280
 - Yeah, but honestly, if you play golf

135
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,960
 and you hear any thunder, you have to come in,

136
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,800
 that's the rule.

137
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,640
 - Oh, really?

138
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,480
 - I thought you weren't meant to come in?

139
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,760
 I thought you were meant to lie down on the ground

140
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,480
 with your bottom in the air.

141
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,480
 - That's not a specific golf rule.

142
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,320
 - What is that?

143
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,120
 - Are you thinking of an off-stretch?

144
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,480
 - As we're doing this, the US Open Golf

145
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,560
 has just started in Oatbunt.

146
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,760
 And I think if there's any lightning there,

147
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,800
 you won't see Rory McElroy and Scotty Sheffler

148
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,480
 taking down their trousers.

149
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,160
 - I've been saying trousers.

150
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,480
 - You definitely added that.

151
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,200
 - But it's easier if the trousers are off,

152
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,760
 so you can pop the flag in the top.

153
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,360
 (laughing)

154
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,400
 - No, that is, there is a theory,

155
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,680
 and this is more generally if you're stuck outside

156
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,160
 in the lightning, that if you're lower down, obviously,

157
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,680
 they're slightly to be struck,

158
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,400
 so you should kind of go on your haunches.

159
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,520
 And if you put your bum in the air,

160
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,840
 then the electricity will hit your bum

161
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,120
 and travel down to the earth without going into your brain.

162
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,120
 - Thank you. - Really?

163
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:21,960
 - That's a sensible save.

164
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,800
 - Hold it once.

165
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,640
 - Saved your...

166
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,480
 (laughing)

167
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,960
 But we've said in the past

168
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,200
 that it's really dangerous for humans.

169
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,040
 - Lighting.

170
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,920
 (laughing)

171
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,120
 - One of those controversial podcasts.

172
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,000
 - But we've also pointed out that between 85 and 90%

173
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,800
 of people who are struck by lightning survive.

174
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,760
 They do have long-term life damages,

175
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,480
 but they do manage to survive.

176
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,840
 - And do you guys read about Ray Caldwell?

177
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,680
 - No.

178
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,800
 - Okay, he was a baseball player.

179
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,360
 He was playing for the Cleveland Indians

180
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,840
 versus the Philadelphia Athletics.

181
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,320
 This was in 1919.

182
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,800
 He's just joined this team, and it is his first match.

183
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,520
 He needs it to go well.

184
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,960
 And he pitches the whole match.

185
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,800
 There's nine innings, he's pitched eight.

186
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,280
 On the ninth inning, that suddenly a thunderstorm hits,

187
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,320
 lightning cracks down, strikes him,

188
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,960
 everyone sees him get struck by it, they run to him,

189
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,400
 he gets back up and says,

190
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,720
 "I've got to make a good impression."

191
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,720
 And he pitches the final few pitches

192
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,560
 and gets a guy out.

193
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,400
 - And when he threw it, like,

194
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,960
 was the ball, like, super electric?

195
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,700
 (laughing)

196
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:19,540
 - Gosh.

197
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,920
 - There's one thing that you can do

198
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:24,120
 that will help you survive in a lightning strike.

199
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:24,960
 - Yeah.

200
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,680
 - And that is having a wet head.

201
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,520
 And this is due to the fact

202
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,640
 that the lightning will hit your head,

203
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,160
 but then the water will conduct it down away

204
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,320
 from your brain, and it might go over your whole body

205
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,880
 rather than just going straight into your brain.

206
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:43,840
 And also, because you have got water on your head,

207
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,720
 it's not as hot.

208
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,560
 - Yeah.

209
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,400
 - So your brain doesn't get boiled.

210
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,080
 - So it will turn the water to steam.

211
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,560
 - Yeah, yeah, I mean, it's still very likely

212
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,800
 to do you a lot of damage, but it can help slightly.

213
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,520
 - If it's between standing outside in the rain,

214
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,040
 saying, "I need to get my head wet,

215
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,760
 "so I'm okay," and going inside.

216
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,640
 - Go inside.

217
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,280
 - Right, that's first thing going inside,

218
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,640
 but failing that head wet. - So I think in all circumstances,

219
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,560
 if there's a lightning storm, you're safer indoors.

220
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,000
 - Well, well.

221
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,840
 - Uh-oh.

222
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,600
 - That was a terrific piece.

223
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,440
 This was two years ago.

224
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,280
 I think it was in the Guardian.

225
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,760
 There's a guy called Aidan Rowan.

226
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,600
 And the headline was,

227
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,480
 "I was struck by lightning while sitting on my sofa."

228
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,080
 Okay, and this was a guy, he was at home,

229
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,480
 lived in Abingdon, which is small towns.

230
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,560
 - Oldest town in the UK?

231
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,800
 - Lovely.

232
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,920
 Well, he was at home, he was playing on his PlayStation.

233
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,200
 The window was open, the weather was a bit bad,

234
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,880
 but you know, it's nice to have a bit of fresh air sometimes

235
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,720
 on the weather's bed.

236
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,680
 - Sometimes when it's thundering and lightning,

237
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,400
 it's quite, you know, electrical air is really nice.

238
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,240
 - Wonderful.

239
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,320
 - Yeah, it's absolutely fine.

240
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,360
 - There was a huge crack.

241
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,860
 Get your mind out of it, stop.

242
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:52,740
 Get off the girl's floor, stop.

243
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:58,600
 He heard a huge noise of thunder.

244
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,760
 Then it felt like someone had dropped

245
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,680
 something very heavy on him.

246
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,720
 He smelt singed flesh.

247
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,680
 And like, basically, his arm was burning

248
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,320
 sort of like scaling and boiled and all of this.

249
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,880
 And like, he and his husband went to hospital

250
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,440
 and it turned out lightning had bounced off water droplets

251
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,800
 on his window sill and into the room.

252
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,120
 - Oh, clever.

253
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,600
 - Final destination stuff, isn't it?

254
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,440
 - It is.

255
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,760
 - Well, remember, I got mocked on this very show

256
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,400
 for having mentioned that I shouldn't be taking baths

257
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,040
 during lightning storms, 'cause remember,

258
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,600
 it could travel through the pipes.

259
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,520
 Remember the lady who was blown out the bath?

260
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,320
 (all laughing)

261
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,320
 - There was a huge crack there as well.

262
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,080
 - But he said, it's lucky, so this is a tip

263
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,240
 if you're playing on your PlayStation

264
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,200
 and the weather's bad.

265
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,560
 He said, one doctor said it was lucky

266
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,160
 that I had my foot on the floor

267
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,320
 while I was playing the game,

268
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,840
 otherwise I wouldn't have been grounded.

269
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,560
 And he could have been completely killed by that.

270
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,720
 But he's a blacksmith, which is interesting.

271
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,280
 - Yeah, no nice detail, thanks.

272
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,720
 - It was like Thor, Thor and Hammer and-

273
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,880
 - Yeah, yeah, and also that he's a God of Thunder.

274
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,720
 How do we know that it bounced off that water droplet?

275
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,400
 I just, it feels like something

276
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,240
 that no one could possibly have documented.

277
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,320
 - You're right.

278
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,320
 - Oh, I saw it.

279
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,040
 - Maybe there was an initial contact burn

280
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,960
 on the windowsill, perhaps, I don't know.

281
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,120
 - I see, I see.

282
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,000
 - But he then, I find this interesting,

283
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,440
 he bought a lottery ticket just to check

284
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,200
 if he'd become psychic.

285
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,920
 And he won six quid.

286
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,280
 (all laughing)

287
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,360
 - Did he deliberately think, well, I am psychic now,

288
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,840
 but I don't want to go for the main numbers

289
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,520
 because then everyone's gonna, you know.

290
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,360
 - You don't want to have pressure touch,

291
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,840
 like man, hit by lightning then wins lottery.

292
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,680
 You got the pressure-

293
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,600
 - You just go for six quid.

294
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,040
 'Cause if you won six quid 100 times every week.

295
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,440
 - The dream amount to win on the lottery

296
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,440
 is enough to buy you another ticket plus a bit.

297
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,280
 - Yes.

298
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,000
 - That's the way to fly low under the radar

299
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,280
 and steadily build up a million pounds.

300
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,360
 - Very true.

301
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,320
 - I, why psychic?

302
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,400
 I would have thought he bought it

303
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,440
 because he thought maybe I'm really lucky.

304
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,080
 I survive being hit by lightning.

305
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,680
 - 'Cause his brain might have, you know,

306
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,600
 I mean, I don't need to go into the details.

307
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,440
 - Yeah.

308
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,720
 - A lot of people think, and there are stories

309
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,320
 all over history of things being cured by lightning.

310
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,360
 It's one of the tribe, nothing else has worked.

311
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,800
 Like there was quite a lot of people say

312
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,860
 that they have blindness and deafness cured.

313
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:06,220
 - I just another case where it just seems so improbable

314
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,060
 that you could survive.

315
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:09,380
 I found a guy called Casey Wagner,

316
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:12,080
 who was out attending a fun day of an event

317
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,640
 called Rednecks with Paychecks.

318
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,760
 And he was sitting under a tree

319
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,840
 when he got hit by lightning, okay?

320
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,520
 It shot his body upwards.

321
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,200
 - I bet he did hit a redneck after that.

322
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,200
 (all laughing)

323
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,520
 - People could see this happening.

324
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,680
 He got hit by a second bolt of lightning.

325
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,220
 He got hit twice.

326
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:30,560
 And what it hit, this is so unfortunate

327
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,440
 'cause you wonder if he was wearing normal shoes.

328
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,360
 - It might not have happened,

329
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,140
 but he happened to be a rodeo clown

330
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,340
 and he was wearing his clown shoes,

331
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:39,260
 which are obviously longer than your regular shoes.

332
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,660
 - Is a rodeo clown a real clown?

333
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:41,500
 - I guess so, yeah.

334
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,340
 - I'm sorry for the ignorance.

335
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:43,900
 I just thought it was an insult.

336
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,020
 - It's like somebody's badly prepared for a rodeo.

337
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:46,860
 - Oh!

338
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,380
 - But you're saying it's an actual clown at the rodeo.

339
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:49,940
 - It's the reverse of someone saying

340
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,780
 this isn't my first rodeo.

341
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:52,620
 - Yeah.

342
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:53,460
 - Yes.

343
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,780
 - Hang on, is rodeo clown even a phrase?

344
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,100
 Don't you know it is a phrase?

345
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:56,940
 - I know that phrase.

346
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,100
 - I read it as I took it.

347
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,580
 It says his job as a rodeo clown.

348
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,580
 You don't have a job as someone who's an idiot

349
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:02,620
 or rocking up.

350
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,960
 - So a rodeo clown?

351
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,240
 (laughing)

352
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,320
 - Don't throw stones.

353
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,820
 - I think after these 12 years you can call that a job.

354
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,080
 (laughing)

355
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:15,240
 - You're saying that...

356
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,520
 - Can I just say around this table

357
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,840
 only one of us has heard the phrase rodeo clown.

358
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,680
 - Yeah.

359
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,520
 - No two, right?

360
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,360
 Andy and Dan.

361
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,200
 - No, Dan thought it was a job.

362
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,040
 - So you know what?

363
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,200
 The fishing box, I know.

364
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,360
 'Cause I do the emails.

365
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,760
 It's gonna be absolutely stuffed with

366
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,040
 how dare you disrespect the ancient profession

367
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:29,920
 of rodeo clown.

368
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,180
 I've been a rodeo clown nine years, man and boy.

369
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,180
 So what happened with his shoes?

370
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,020
 Sorry?

371
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,820
 - Well, it struck his shoe.

372
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:39,180
 I've extrapolated the idea to think that maybe his shoe

373
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,060
 was longer 'cause it was a clown shoe.

374
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:42,180
 (laughing)

375
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,820
 And all that water in a squirty buttonhole

376
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,260
 will have boiled immediately.

377
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:47,020
 (laughing)

378
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:49,340
 - Can I quickly mention something about Tonka trees?

379
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,300
 - Yeah, go for it.

380
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:55,300
 - So Tonka beans are delicious, but lethal.

381
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:58,140
 So if you eat too many of them,

382
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:01,600
 like in sheep, five grams, about two teaspoons is fatal.

383
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,280
 In humans, we don't really know what's fatal

384
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,200
 because we can't really do that experiment,

385
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,080
 but it is illegal to use Tonka beans

386
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,760
 in your food in America.

387
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,200
 And for a long time, they used it

388
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,480
 'cause it tastes really delicious,

389
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,960
 like a vanilla, licorice, caramel, loaves.

390
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:21,080
 They used it in ice cream and stuff for a long time.

391
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,440
 In America now, still, if you go to a really,

392
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,600
 really, really, really posh restaurant,

393
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,520
 then they will still serve you Tonka stuff

394
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,360
 even though it's illegal.

395
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,940
 - I love this, it's like the secret illegal bean.

396
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:32,860
 And it's--

397
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,800
 - But it's just on menus, openly.

398
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,140
 - Yeah, it's 'cause of this chemical inside the bean

399
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,860
 called Kumarin.

400
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:42,460
 And also, the amount of Kumarin you'd have to consume

401
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,040
 equates to so many beans,

402
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,660
 which equates to so many puddings at the restaurant.

403
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:49,340
 I read that as a human, you'd have to eat one gram

404
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:51,080
 of Kumarin, not of Tonka beans,

405
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,000
 of the chemical that's extracted

406
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,940
 to experience any ill effects whatsoever.

407
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,980
 That equates to about 30 beans worth of Kumarin.

408
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:00,920
 And that would be about 250 puddings at this--

409
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:04,020
 - That's true, although the actual limit,

410
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:06,560
 as in, if the FDA did have a limit,

411
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,000
 or if the EU had a limit,

412
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,320
 it would be a quarter of a Tonka bean.

413
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,240
 And the reason is because we can't test it on humans

414
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,680
 about what's good for you or bad for you.

415
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,240
 So what they do is they test it on an animal,

416
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,120
 and then they say, okay, well, that's what that is

417
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,360
 for a baboon or for a dog or whatever.

418
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,000
 We're gonna multiply it by 100

419
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,560
 for the human safety factor.

420
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,580
 And that's how they work out the human safety factors.

421
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,340
 They have like a massive window.

422
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,060
 - That is so cautious.

423
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,060
 - I know, but that's how they do it.

424
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:31,900
 - That's too much, isn't it?

425
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,220
 - The delicious puddings we're missing out on,

426
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,620
 there are secret puddings all over the world

427
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,460
 that we're not allowed to have.

428
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,140
 - We're allowed to have it, we're not American.

429
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:37,980
 - It's just the Americans.

430
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,900
 - We're gonna have Tonka beans, upper asses?

431
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:42,300
 (all laughing)

432
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,260
 - While you're on the golf course,

433
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,860
 I'll just pop this in here, madam,

434
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:47,460
 and I hope you enjoy those rich flavors.

435
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,380
 (all laughing)

436
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:51,420
 - I don't even know what I was trying to say.

437
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,740
 Do you know what it's also in?

438
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,180
 I really didn't know this.

439
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:56,280
 So the kumaran, this thing that's poisonous,

440
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,920
 very slightly poisonous,

441
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,760
 or in very small amounts in these things,

442
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,200
 it's also in cinnamon,

443
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,720
 but that's only because cinnamon isn't really cinnamon.

444
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,920
 I did not know this.

445
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,680
 Check the cinnamon in your cupboard.

446
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,840
 It doesn't, most of it is not true cinnamon,

447
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,800
 which comes from the bark of the cinnamonum virum,

448
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,200
 and that's native to Sri Lanka.

449
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:19,320
 It's actually from a plant called the cassia, cassia cinnamon,

450
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,000
 which is, which is not true cinnamon at all,

451
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,120
 even though it's claiming to be.

452
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,980
 And one teaspoon of it, in fact,

453
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:28,020
 sends you over kumaran safety limits set by the EU.

454
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,600
 Again, very cautious.

455
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,860
 I do overload with cinnamon sometimes.

456
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:32,960
 On the old porridge,

457
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,400
 you're probably breaking EU law

458
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,280
 every time you have a nice cinnamon porridge.

459
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,860
 - 20 cinnamon buns.

460
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,300
 If they're those really delicious cinnamon-y ones,

461
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,140
 you know where the middle is really cinnamon-y.

462
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:45,000
 If you have 20 of those, then that's really...

463
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,280
 - And sometimes after a night out,

464
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,480
 when you go to one of those late night pastry places

465
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,700
 in London, it's not impossible that's happened.

466
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,460
 - Yeah. Oh, yes.

467
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:55,480
 - Everyone else going to the kebab shop and is like, "No."

468
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,680
 (laughing)

469
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,380
 - The lottery do me.

470
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,960
 (upbeat music)

471
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:07,500
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Anna.

472
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,860
 - My fact this week is that in the 1400s,

473
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:13,600
 the king of Korea put a big drum outside his palace,

474
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,720
 and anyone in the kingdom who wanted to complain

475
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:19,060
 about something was encouraged to come and bang it.

476
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,940
 I bet they were not encouraged.

477
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,900
 I bet they were strongly deterred,

478
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,380
 except under the direst extremity.

479
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:26,220
 - No way.

480
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,980
 - He said, "Come one, come all."

481
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,060
 Anything pissing you off?

482
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,860
 Your wife nagging you too much?

483
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:31,900
 Your shoes too tight? - He might say,

484
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:35,760
 "Come one, come all," because it was the concept of one

485
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:39,540
 in Korea, which is if someone causes you a slight,

486
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:42,100
 or let's say someone steals something off you

487
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,980
 and they're not properly punished,

488
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,540
 then your level of one,

489
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:48,780
 your kind of negative emotions are out of balance.

490
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:52,660
 And this person who was sort of starting these new laws

491
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,660
 and trying to keep everyone happy,

492
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:55,980
 this was one of the things he was like,

493
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:59,220
 if your one is out of level due to someone else,

494
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,220
 then that person will get punished.

495
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:04,420
 - That was a beautiful segue from the word one

496
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:05,580
 to the concept of one.

497
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:07,620
 - Can I tell you one other thing about one?

498
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:08,600
 - Oh, God. - Very nice.

499
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,060
 - Who was this king, what was he called?

500
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,140
 - King Dae Jong.

501
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:13,300
 - Do you know what his birth name was?

502
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,820
 - It was something different, I can tell you that.

503
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,100
 - His birth name, considering he put a big drum

504
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,540
 outside his palace, was Lee Bangwon.

505
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:23,500
 - Lovely stuff.

506
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:27,260
 But he really did, he was king from 1400 to 1418,

507
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,540
 it was in the Chosun dynasty,

508
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:30,620
 which is sort of the massive deal,

509
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:33,140
 Korean dynasty went on for a thousand years.

510
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:35,620
 And it was called the Sin Mungo Drum.

511
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:38,500
 And it really was part of a system,

512
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,660
 and there were three layers of appeal,

513
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:40,740
 before you got to the drum,

514
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,940
 you could go to your county level courts,

515
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:45,480
 regional level, national level,

516
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,660
 if they all reject your,

517
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:51,000
 my kettle's broken complaint or whatever it is,

518
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,980
 then you go to the drum.

519
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,800
 - It's like, I wanna talk to your manager,

520
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,880
 and if you don't get the manager,

521
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,120
 I'm going straight to the drum.

522
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,220
 - Exactly, exactly.

523
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,860
 You bang on the drum, the king deals with it.

524
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,920
 - Yeah, I do imagine that,

525
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,340
 'cause the idea was that anyone could bang the drum.

526
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:08,140
 But I feel like they would have made it quite clear

527
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:10,680
 that this is a, are you really sure

528
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,200
 you want to bang the drum?

529
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,260
 'Cause if you hadn't gone through

530
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,780
 these three layers of lower courts,

531
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,960
 I'm sure you'd probably have been immediately executed

532
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,040
 for even touching the drum, you know?

533
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,240
 - Yeah, exactly.

534
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,200
 - The king is a busy guy.

535
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,040
 - He's a busy guy.

536
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,480
 You're clearly an annoying customer,

537
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,040
 if you've made it this far.

538
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,640
 - He's a vexatious litigation in action.

539
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,080
 - He was a killer, Taijong.

540
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,440
 Friend of the podcast, by the way.

541
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,280
 We have mentioned him before.

542
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,600
 - We've got some questionable friends,

543
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,600
 and we've never denied it.

544
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,600
 - Yeah, we've mentioned him before.

545
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,920
 He was the guy who, so this Joe's son,

546
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,520
 period dynasty that we're talking about,

547
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,680
 they used to have people writing every single thing down

548
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:46,780
 about the royalty, and he once fell off a horse,

549
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:49,280
 and he didn't want that recorded,

550
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,980
 but what has then been recorded is him falling off the horse

551
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,040
 and saying to the historians,

552
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,460
 "Don't record this happening."

553
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:56,460
 - Yeah, it's the Barbara Streisand effect.

554
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:57,300
 - Yes.

555
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,140
 - It's the earliest known example

556
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,180
 of Barbara Streisand in the world.

557
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:03,220
 - Exactly, but no, he did like to kill.

558
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:06,580
 So you would be pretty brave to bang that drum.

559
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:07,420
 - Who did he kill?

560
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:10,300
 - So he executed the four brothers of his wife.

561
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,060
 He executed his father-in-law,

562
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,140
 his younger brother.

563
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,440
 - That's a tough Christmas.

564
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,600
 (all laughing)

565
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,440
 - Yeah, he was-

566
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,320
 - But to be fair, he executed people

567
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,320
 who were quite high up the social strata.

568
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,400
 - He was a progressive.

569
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,240
 Is that what we're saying?

570
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,080
 - I think he was progressive.

571
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,560
 Well, in a weird way, he did,

572
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:28,480
 like he really wanted to kind of democratize stuff in a way.

573
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,880
 That's the whole idea of this drum is like,

574
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,080
 he believes the common people are the ones to be trusted.

575
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,680
 He's like, women and men are exactly the same.

576
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,840
 Enslaved people are exactly the same as the nobles,

577
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,800
 but basically what he wanted to do was crush noble power.

578
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,740
 So yeah, he, I mean, any brother or brother-in-law

579
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:45,420
 or step-brother who seemed like might overthrow him,

580
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,140
 he really upset his dad,

581
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:50,060
 who sounds like he was quite nice.

582
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:50,900
 - What?

583
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,500
 - Excuse me, I'm gonna throw in one brother-in-law.

584
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,420
 - This was the guy who started the chosen dynasty, right?

585
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,260
 - Yeah.

586
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,940
 - By overthrowing the other dynasty.

587
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,900
 - You don't start a dynasty without breaking a few eggs.

588
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:03,060
 - Who hasn't overthrown a dynasty?

589
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:06,020
 - Taijong was the king we're talking about with the big drum.

590
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,220
 His father was known as Taijo.

591
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:13,000
 And I think he sort of ousted his father from power.

592
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,160
 There was a lot of strife,

593
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,800
 a lot of people were killed off along the way,

594
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,680
 a lot of rival claimants all bumped off.

595
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:20,800
 So after Taijong became king,

596
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:24,760
 his father, Taijo, was still alive and no longer king.

597
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,960
 And Taijong started sending him messengers

598
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,760
 to try and heal that breach.

599
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,320
 Who his father then had beheaded as an indirect message

600
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,720
 that he would never forgive Taijong.

601
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,280
 - I think executing the messengers is a really shabby move.

602
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,120
 - Yeah.

603
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,200
 - It's not good, but-

604
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,280
 - You can just send the messenger back

605
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,680
 to the thing saying, "No, I do not forgive you."

606
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,420
 - Also, I think when you do that,

607
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,500
 you're supposed to like cut the hand off the messengers

608
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,800
 so that he can go back and say, "Look what happened to me."

609
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,180
 If you cut the head off,

610
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:52,060
 you just stuck with the body of a messenger.

611
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:52,900
 - Exactly.

612
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,140
 - You just think my messengers must have got lost.

613
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,480
 - Yeah, right, I'll send someone.

614
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,180
 Hence he kept sending messengers.

615
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:58,260
 What a horrible system.

616
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,100
 - Yeah.

617
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,020
 - I guess what I saw as this touching angle

618
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,980
 is why he was angry though.

619
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,060
 - Why was he angry then?

620
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:06,000
 - He was angry because,

621
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,680
 so Taijong had been king and then he'd abdicated.

622
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,880
 People constantly abdicating, not dying.

623
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,000
 And then he made another one of his sons king,

624
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,840
 who Taijong overthrew,

625
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,960
 and then Taijong killed a bunch of his brothers,

626
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,800
 as we've said,

627
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,360
 and his dad was just really upset with him

628
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,920
 for killing his other kids.

629
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,860
 So his dad was like,

630
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:25,120
 "I'm so pissed off that you killed my kids."

631
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:25,960
 - Yeah, yeah.

632
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,520
 - And I think that's a few messengers' heads

633
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:32,080
 that were gonna roll to punish your son.

634
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,420
 - We've ascertained we're in terms of aristocracy

635
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:38,820
 versus messenger court, Anna's loyalties lie with, okay?

636
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,580
 - I like the way that all these things

637
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:42,740
 where people's heads are rolling left, right, and center

638
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:45,800
 are known as the first and second strife of princes.

639
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,100
 - Yeah.

640
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,400
 - It feels like they're underplaying it a bit.

641
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,660
 - Yeah, we've got a euphemism, such things.

642
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:54,100
 - I don't like any of the people involved, I should say.

643
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:54,940
 - Yeah, they're all quite bad, aren't they?

644
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:56,580
 - He was smart, Taijong.

645
00:20:56,580 --> 00:21:00,100
 He was the only king in the history of Korea

646
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,480
 who passed the civil service exam.

647
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,320
 - Really?

648
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,160
 - Remember, we've said in the past,

649
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,240
 they have these really, really tough civil service exams

650
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,160
 to see who gets the jobs?

651
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:11,200
 Well, he passed it and none of his brothers passed it,

652
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,360
 but they also got into the civil service

653
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,280
 due to the system that if your parents are really rich,

654
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:19,160
 you get it anyway, which they had at the time.

655
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,160
 But yeah, he got through this

656
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,160
 and he decided he wanted to be a tattooist.

657
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,000
 - Really?

658
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,480
 - Yeah, 'cause it was a big deal job in the time.

659
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,800
 If there was a criminal and they did something wrong,

660
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,140
 you would tattoo the criminal with whatever they'd done wrong

661
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:32,760
 so that people would know.

662
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,980
 And it was a really important job

663
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:35,180
 and that's what he wanted to be,

664
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,860
 but then in the end he became king.

665
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:40,100
 - Was there, 'cause some tattoos are quite subtle

666
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,100
 and you can hide them.

667
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,140
 I presume if you're the criminal,

668
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,540
 you can't say, can you do it really small

669
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:44,940
 and on my inner thigh?

670
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:48,580
 Presumably it has to be like back of the hand or something.

671
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:50,540
 Like I'm a purse snatcher or whatever.

672
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:53,060
 - I think it was in specific, they had rules.

673
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:55,580
 - Could you get extra tattoos after that one to kind of,

674
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:56,660
 you know how people these days,

675
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,020
 if they've got like an embarrassing tattoo,

676
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,360
 they'll try and add to it too.

677
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,120
 - Yeah, like what was it?

678
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,120
 Oh, it's slightly the other way,

679
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,280
 but Johnny Depp had Winona forever

680
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,720
 and then got rid of it and it said, why no forever?

681
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,760
 - Oh, yes. - Exactly.

682
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,120
 Could you add extra things?

683
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,440
 I can't think of how you'd adapt the phrase purse snatcher

684
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,360
 to be benign, but mm.

685
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,680
 - I am not a.

686
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,020
 - Yeah, exactly.

687
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:19,120
 - No, there were very strict rules about tattooing in general.

688
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,160
 - But so this is the king who wanted to be the tattooist.

689
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,000
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

690
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:22,840
 Well, he wasn't the king of the time.

691
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,640
 He was just like a prince.

692
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,480
 - Okay.

693
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,520
 I got a little detail about his death

694
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,340
 the day he died, Taijong, which is that,

695
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:33,180
 so he abdicated, right?

696
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,820
 Four years later, he dies.

697
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:37,420
 And there's a thing which is drought

698
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:40,780
 is often connected to your relationship with the gods.

699
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:42,660
 And in the 1400s, it was believed

700
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,100
 that royalty were connected to it.

701
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,660
 So sometimes the king would go to an area

702
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:47,260
 and if it rained, that would be seen

703
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:49,340
 as a miracle brought on by the king.

704
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:51,940
 So when he was in his dying day, the king himself,

705
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:54,220
 he said, I'm gonna make it rain.

706
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:57,380
 And on the day he died, it torrential rained

707
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:59,520
 and for so long, it was like 10 days

708
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,240
 to the point where it actually destroyed crops

709
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,760
 because it was so much.

710
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,520
 But this has been a legend, but people have gone back

711
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,800
 and they found through all the records

712
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,200
 that it did rain on the day that he died.

713
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,280
 So it's seen as a miracle day.

714
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,200
 - Is it a miracle if it rains?

715
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,660
 I mean, I know Korea's not as bad as Britain.

716
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:17,280
 And yeah, yeah, I can see that they really wanted it.

717
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,360
 - I think that's often what happens in those circumstances

718
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,760
 is it's been a drought for so long

719
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,840
 and so the ground gets really hard.

720
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,560
 And then you get a big rain storm

721
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:28,500
 like you would naturally get after a lot of hot weather,

722
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,860
 but there's nowhere for the water to go.

723
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:30,700
 So it all kind of--

724
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,660
 - Yeah, bloody floods.

725
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,340
 And then God goes, well, what the hell did you want?

726
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,260
 Everyone gets really upset about that.

727
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,980
 What do you want from me?

728
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,780
 Yeah, he abdicated because I think he wanted

729
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:42,780
 to train up his son basically, who was Sejong.

730
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:46,580
 And he basically is known as Korea's greatest ever leader

731
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,020
 for lots and lots of reasons.

732
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:50,660
 But partly 'cause I don't think he's the only king ever

733
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:53,660
 to have invented a completely new alphabet from scratch.

734
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:56,960
 And it's still the alphabet that they use today.

735
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,440
 - I think what a pain in the ass

736
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,120
 to invent an entirely new alphabet.

737
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,000
 Because if you're the king,

738
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,520
 everyone has to go along with your alphabet as well.

739
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,640
 There's no way you can soft launch an alphabet

740
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,200
 and say, well, we'll see if it takes off

741
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,360
 and see if anyone starts using this new alphabet.

742
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,600
 Do we know why he invented a new alphabet?

743
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,560
 - Well, I think they were using the Chinese alphabet

744
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:17,160
 which didn't match Korean noises at the time.

745
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,760
 And so they were like, we need one that fits.

746
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,240
 And he was very smart.

747
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,200
 He was an academic.

748
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,280
 So actually his alphabet was so good

749
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,100
 that they've kept on using it.

750
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:25,940
 - Well, that's very impressive.

751
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:26,780
 I didn't know that.

752
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:29,020
 I love the idea of workshopping an alphabet though.

753
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:30,940
 Like just get some guys in, have some beers,

754
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:32,420
 just see where it takes us.

755
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:34,140
 - Make some of the noises you make every day.

756
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:37,420
 - Yeah, that one, I'm gonna draw a symbol for that one.

757
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,660
 - To reckon with the Beers thing,

758
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:40,780
 that's why the end of the alphabet is so fucked up

759
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:42,540
 with X, Y's and Z's.

760
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,460
 Yes, everyone's just pissed by that place.

761
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:45,300
 - It's a late night.

762
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,640
 - Let's go for an X, what?

763
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,620
 - Is that why he's sleeping in Z's?

764
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:50,940
 - That's right.

765
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:53,380
 - Have you never gone to the end of the alphabet?

766
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:55,460
 It goes, W, X, Y, Z, vomit.

767
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,320
 (all laughing)

768
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,900
 (upbeat music)

769
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:04,340
 - Okay, time for fact number three.

770
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,360
 And that is my fact.

771
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,100
 My fact this week is that the artist George Brack

772
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:11,160
 once spent 10 days trying to get rid of a squirrel

773
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,540
 that kept reappearing in his painting.

774
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:17,840
 - This guy sounds like an idiot.

775
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,320
 Once you just keep drawing the squirrel,

776
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,600
 rubbing it out, drawing the squirrel.

777
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,140
 - Yes, and it's a job, James.

778
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,820
 You can be an idiot and make money.

779
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:27,100
 So this obviously very famous artist.

780
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,280
 I read this in a book.

781
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,380
 We recently did a show with John Lloyd

782
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:32,780
 and we talked about Picasso in it.

783
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:35,140
 And off the back of it, I went on holiday

784
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:38,220
 and I took Francois Gileau's autobiography,

785
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:40,020
 which is her life in Picasso.

786
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:43,180
 She talks about the fact that Brack and Picasso

787
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:46,160
 had this moment where in their cubism period,

788
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,900
 they were both staring at a painting

789
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:48,960
 that Brack was painting.

790
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,940
 And he just said, Picasso just said to him,

791
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:53,980
 "What's that squirrel doing there?"

792
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:56,660
 And he said, "Oh my God, what is that squirrel doing there?"

793
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,300
 Now obviously there was no squirrel there,

794
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,740
 but they could see the squirrel.

795
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:02,060
 - 'Cause was it like, what would you call it?

796
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,780
 Like-- - Impressionistic?

797
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:05,500
 - Yeah, like an impressionistic painting

798
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:08,380
 where it wasn't a picture of a bowl of fruit

799
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:09,660
 and there's a squirrel in there, right?

800
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:12,620
 - Well, no, exactly, but he was painting

801
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,900
 a package of tobacco and a pipe.

802
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:15,740
 - Oh, so it was still life.

803
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:16,580
 - Yeah, it was still life.

804
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:17,940
 - But it was just like in the corner,

805
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:19,840
 it was like the shadows made it look like that, right?

806
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,840
 - Yeah, exactly, and they could see the squirrel.

807
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,000
 So he paints it away,

808
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,160
 but as he's constantly transforming the painting

809
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,320
 over the next eight to 10 days,

810
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,080
 the squirrel keeps popping up in a new different place.

811
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,480
 The squirrel returns.

812
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,400
 And so he spends close to 10 days

813
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,040
 until he invites Picasso back and Picasso and him both agree,

814
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,880
 yes, the squirrel is now gone

815
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,600
 and now they know that the painting is as it should be.

816
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,280
 - Do you think there's a chance

817
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,840
 Picasso never saw the squirrel

818
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,680
 and just thought, I'm gonna psych out my mate here.

819
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,920
 This is gonna really pit him off.

820
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,380
 - Slow him down.

821
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:49,220
 - Yeah, exactly.

822
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:50,060
 - Let's get ahead.

823
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:50,900
 - Let's deal with the competition.

824
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,500
 I had never heard of Brack before this.

825
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,340
 - Okay.

826
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:54,180
 - Is he really, is he made for this?

827
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,020
 - Well, they've found us

828
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,740
 of Cubism where it's Picasso and Brack.

829
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,580
 - Oh, okay.

830
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:58,420
 - He's biggy, yeah, okay.

831
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:59,260
 - In that world, yeah.

832
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:00,100
 - Yeah, yeah.

833
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,680
 - He's bigger in the art world than in the cricket world.

834
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,940
 (laughing)

835
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:05,940
 - Is it, and this is Cubism that was,

836
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,260
 sorry, not impressionism, Cubism.

837
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:09,340
 So lots of different shapes.

838
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:10,260
 - Yeah, Cubes.

839
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,100
 - Yeah, Cubes.

840
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:11,940
 - It's mostly, yeah.

841
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,420
 - And what are we all except a selection of Cubes

842
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:14,580
 arranged in a pile?

843
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:17,540
 - Think of a Picasso painting, like a really wonky one.

844
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:18,380
 - Yeah.

845
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,740
 - You're kind of on the Cubism vibe there.

846
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:22,080
 - Is this a perennial hazard for Cubist painters?

847
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,440
 Like, what people constantly saying,

848
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,960
 "I love that castle you've done."

849
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,280
 You can say, "Yes, thank you very much."

850
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,120
 - No.

851
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,080
 - "Spent ages on the castle."

852
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,200
 They're sweated over that.

853
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,480
 - No, and this was, this is actually a really good point.

854
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,760
 This is the main point about it,

855
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,240
 is that Picasso was saying

856
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,960
 you were painting something to be seen.

857
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,120
 You were not painting an illusion.

858
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,920
 So if we're seeing a squirrel in your painting,

859
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,960
 you've painted an illusion.

860
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,760
 You've allowed for it to be interpreted in this way.

861
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,520
 - And this is all a form of something called "Paradolia,"

862
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:49,160
 which is where you see faces or images

863
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,760
 in something that don't really exist.

864
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,680
 When you look in the sky and you see a cloud

865
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:58,100
 and you think, "Oh, that looks like Mother Teresa or something,"

866
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:01,520
 then that is because you're seeing things

867
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,500
 that aren't really there.

868
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:05,060
 - Well, why does she bless me then?

869
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:07,260
 Why does she reach down and the cloud touches my nose

870
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,580
 and I feel electricity?

871
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:09,820
 What's going on there?

872
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:13,220
 - Well, it is, "Paradolia" can be associated

873
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,800
 with schizophrenia.

874
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,520
 It can be associated with extreme creativity.

875
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,160
 - Well, that's, can't be why I've got it.

876
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,480
 (all laughing)

877
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,520
 But is it, I read that it was also neurosis

878
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:27,600
 and even conspiracy theorists are more likely

879
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,760
 because they're forming patterns everywhere.

880
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,160
 They're thinking, "That's an interesting coincidence.

881
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,320
 That's interesting. That's interesting."

882
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,360
 Maybe think of you, Dan.

883
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,760
 You know, you're a very good at coincidence generation.

884
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,600
 - Yeah, well, okay.

885
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,760
 - So the usually faces more than the rest of us, maybe.

886
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,800
 - I don't think so because I'm not a conspiracy theorist,

887
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:45,140
 but the face on Mars is the most famous one,

888
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,900
 I would say in the conspiracy world.

889
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:50,220
 There was a photo that was taken by the Viking space probe

890
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:53,180
 and you can see what looks like a giant face

891
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,540
 on the surface of Mars.

892
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,260
 That was found decades ago

893
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:58,460
 and that has built a whole industry of ideas

894
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:00,380
 that ancient aliens landed there

895
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:01,460
 and built stuff and so on.

896
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:04,300
 - And what proof is it of life?

897
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:06,660
 Is it like someone died and they were a giant

898
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:08,740
 and then they turned into a rock?

899
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:09,580
 Just their face.

900
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:12,360
 - Because actually, if you look at civilization today,

901
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,860
 there aren't loads of faces.

902
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:17,020
 It's loads of buildings.

903
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:19,820
 - And tools and some bones.

904
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:22,460
 It's so rare you just see a human face left over

905
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:23,660
 from 4,000 years ago.

906
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:26,100
 - As a representative of the conspiracy theorists,

907
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,820
 I'd like to say there are people that believe it.

908
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:28,680
 Next time you're at my house,

909
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,500
 I've got about six books I can lend you,

910
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:33,140
 which very much put forward that idea.

911
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:35,000
 No, it's who knows.

912
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,540
 They just thought it looked man-made

913
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:38,620
 is rather what it is, is the main thing.

914
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:41,300
 - Nazca lines, the shapes were viewed from above

915
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,960
 and they say an abyss giant.

916
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,660
 He's a big face on the ground and a whole lot else besides.

917
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:46,500
 - Good point.

918
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,620
 So people with faces also make faces.

919
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,620
 - Yeah.

920
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,460
 Do you know what?

921
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:51,580
 Just on that word, pareidolia,

922
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:53,300
 this idea of seeing faces and things,

923
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:58,100
 Picasso had a theory that that is how art began to begin with.

924
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:00,720
 He thinks that early man was looking around

925
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,820
 and seeing faces in rocks and seeing,

926
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:04,100
 and thinking, oh, why don't I

927
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:06,380
 trace over that or why don't I try and mimic that?

928
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:08,680
 - Well, there's evidence of that.

929
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,620
 This is really cool.

930
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:13,360
 So it's believed that maybe Neanderthals

931
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:17,120
 also experienced pareidolia and early man.

932
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:21,580
 There was a stone found, a pebble,

933
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:23,300
 and it has a human fingerprint on it

934
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:27,220
 and one red dot of ochre.

935
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:29,700
 And that helps it look a little bit like a face.

936
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,260
 It helps to make a little bit of a nose

937
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,380
 in between a bit of pebble that looks like eyes

938
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:35,660
 and a little bit that could look like a mouth.

939
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:37,020
 And I read a study about it,

940
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:40,940
 which was titled "More than a Fingerprint on a Pebble",

941
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,900
 which is defensive to so- - Just a real question mark

942
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:43,740
 on that.

943
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:46,420
 - It was, no, it was "More than a Fingerprint on a Pebble".

944
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:47,260
 Surely.

945
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:49,460
 - That's better 'cause you made it sound quite desperate.

946
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:53,140
 - Well, it dates back 43,000 years.

947
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:57,420
 And they think it is evidence that early humans were saying,

948
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:58,500
 oh, that looks a bit like a face.

949
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:01,020
 I'll add a bit of art and a little one dot

950
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,500
 and that'll make it look even more like a face.

951
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:06,140
 So this is a long historical tendency we all have.

952
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,420
 - Would make sense.

953
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:11,100
 Seeing Jesus' face, that's a very common one to appear.

954
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,100
 We all know what that looks like.

955
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:16,140
 First time it appeared is in a 1977 flower tortilla.

956
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,420
 So it was a woman called Maria Rubio

957
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:21,860
 and she was making burritos for her husband in New Mexico

958
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:24,020
 and she saw Jesus' face.

959
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:27,180
 And it really is the famous face of Jesus in a tortilla.

960
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,260
 She snipped out his face.

961
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,980
 She took it to a priest at the local church.

962
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:31,900
 She said, "What the hell's going on here?"

963
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,980
 And the priest was like, "Well, you've been visited by Jesus."

964
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:36,500
 And it actually sort of ruined their lives.

965
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:39,180
 So thousands and thousands of people visited

966
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:41,380
 from all across like Central and South America

967
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:42,980
 and North America came to the house.

968
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:45,420
 They displayed it in this glass case.

969
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:47,540
 But people expected her to do amazing things.

970
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:48,940
 They thought she could heal

971
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,740
 and they thought she had these incredible powers.

972
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:52,820
 So they'd come and they'd bring their sick children

973
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:54,140
 and say, "Heal me."

974
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:56,300
 And she, you know, she agonized over it.

975
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:58,620
 She didn't want a profit out of the tortilla

976
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,420
 and she wanted to help people,

977
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,740
 but she couldn't heal them.

978
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:04,980
 And she just said in the end it was a complete nightmare,

979
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:07,220
 but she was too religious to destroy it

980
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,900
 'cause you can't destroy the face of Jesus

981
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,700
 once it's entered your home.

982
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,980
 - Right, but once you smear guacamole on it,

983
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:15,980
 you're not going to be able to see it anyway.

984
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:18,460
 - It's what he would have wanted.

985
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:19,740
 - What did she do with it?

986
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:22,140
 - She kept it for years and years

987
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,820
 and it broke of its own accord in 2005.

988
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:27,060
 - With its own accord.

989
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:30,020
 That's a miracle, like a tortilla that magically fractures.

990
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:31,620
 - It'd be like a Jesus jigsaw.

991
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:32,460
 Oh yeah, nice.

992
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:34,540
 Maybe that's how the grandkids use it today.

993
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:37,820
 - There might be a reason why Jesus is seen so much.

994
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:39,140
 Although I know you get,

995
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:41,580
 there's a famous Virgin Mary tortilla.

996
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:45,020
 A lot of Mexican foods that the trinity are appearing on,

997
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:45,860
 which is interesting.

998
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,260
 - Yes, maybe it lends itself to faces

999
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:48,460
 'cause it's got those little bubbles in it

1000
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:49,740
 that look like eyes and a nose, doesn't it?

1001
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:52,380
 - We once saw the devil in a chicken pacora.

1002
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:54,660
 - Okay.

1003
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:55,500
 - Lucky you.

1004
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,500
 - Back up a second.

1005
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:59,780
 - It's like it's not always Mexican food.

1006
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:00,980
 - No, you're right.

1007
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,820
 - Well, that's really food for thought.

1008
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:03,660
 - Yeah.

1009
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:05,100
 - What are you still doing on this podcast?

1010
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,940
 Shouldn't you be touring the world with your millions?

1011
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:12,500
 - Anywhere we called our pacora, Derek pacora.

1012
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,660
 - Oh, very nice.

1013
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:14,500
 - What did you do with him?

1014
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,860
 Is he in a glass cabinet somewhere?

1015
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,420
 - I eventually went in the bin.

1016
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:18,500
 We didn't eat him.

1017
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:19,340
 - Wow.

1018
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:20,180
 - Didn't you?

1019
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:21,020
 - No.

1020
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:21,860
 - Too scared.

1021
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:23,180
 - The devil's pacora, no way.

1022
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:24,460
 Was it a spicy pacora?

1023
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,460
 - I don't know, I didn't eat it.

1024
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:26,300
 - No.

1025
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:28,540
 (laughing)

1026
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:33,140
 - So the reason that Jesus might appear more

1027
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:35,140
 is a thing to do with pareidolia in general.

1028
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:38,220
 And that is that people think when they see a face

1029
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:40,900
 in anything that is male,

1030
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:43,580
 80% of the faces that people perceive,

1031
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:45,940
 whether, you know, it's just a collection of lines

1032
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,980
 or whatever, 80% are male.

1033
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:49,380
 - Is that patriarchy stuff?

1034
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:50,260
 - I think it probably is.

1035
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:53,060
 Unless they clearly have, you know, long hair,

1036
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:56,380
 lustrous eyelashes, a big science saying I am female

1037
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:58,620
 or whatever it is, people just think that's a bloke.

1038
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:00,380
 - Is it that, 'cause the two biggies really

1039
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:02,460
 are the Virgin Mary and Jesus, right?

1040
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:04,620
 But do you mean that there'll be a lot of men's names

1041
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:06,980
 in the mix and just the Virgin Mary?

1042
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:09,380
 - No, I guess we just see random faces most of the time, right?

1043
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,260
 We don't see usually Mary or Jesus,

1044
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,620
 we just go, "Ah, looks like a face."

1045
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:13,460
 - Yeah, I see.

1046
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:15,460
 - I think it's like if you were to draw a circle

1047
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:17,020
 with two dots where eyes might be

1048
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:19,300
 and a dot where the nose is in a line where the mouth is,

1049
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,620
 a lot of people just say, "Oh, look at that man."

1050
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:22,460
 - Yes.

1051
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,300
 - That kind of thing.

1052
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,140
 - Yeah, that's it.

1053
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:24,960
 I'm afraid I think it probably,

1054
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,420
 there isn't a better explanation than patriarchy.

1055
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:29,460
 - There never is, Andy. - Wow.

1056
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:31,220
 - Or a worse explanation.

1057
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:33,600
 - Even in shapes. - Wow, a lot of ways.

1058
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,740
 - Auditory Paradolia.

1059
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,940
 If you're walking through the woods,

1060
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:41,900
 there might be some wind rustling through the leaves.

1061
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,580
 There might be a water going by

1062
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:45,940
 and people often hear the names.

1063
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:49,900
 Ah, it does happen quite a lot, it seems, it turns out.

1064
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,780
 And it can happen with electric fans,

1065
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:54,340
 with airplane engines, with washing machines.

1066
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:55,940
 Anywhere where there's kind of white noise,

1067
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:58,660
 sort of uncertain what the noise is.

1068
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:01,140
 The reason is that your brain kind of just fills

1069
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:05,460
 in the gaps and so if this white noise,

1070
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:08,020
 this washing machine is making lots of weird noises

1071
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:13,020
 and a couple of those noises sound a bit like an a and a n,

1072
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:16,180
 then you would think, oh, someone said Anna.

1073
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:18,820
 But even though it's just like a few frequencies

1074
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:20,980
 that sound a little bit like those letters.

1075
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:22,980
 - It's not just people who are called things like,

1076
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:26,660
 "Pshh." (all laughing)

1077
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,100
 - The name takes an hour to pronounce,

1078
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,300
 but only half an hour if you put them on a quick cycle.

1079
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,980
 (all laughing)

1080
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:35,300
 I really like the thing of why this happens in general,

1081
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,900
 like the evolutionary theory as to why it happens,

1082
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:40,940
 which is that it is useful to us evolutionarily

1083
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:45,060
 to perceive a pattern where there may or may not be one.

1084
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,900
 So that particularly applies to, let's say,

1085
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:50,420
 if you're in an environment with predators,

1086
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:52,780
 it is more useful to see a bear

1087
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:55,540
 that is not there than not to see a bear that is there.

1088
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:57,220
 And there's a terrific book, actually,

1089
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,460
 called "The Tiger That Isn't,"

1090
00:35:58,460 --> 00:35:59,780
 which is mostly a book about stats,

1091
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:01,700
 but it's really good about finding signals

1092
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:02,540
 and patterns and all that.

1093
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:04,220
 It's a great book about maths.

1094
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:06,900
 But yeah, that seems to be the reason why it happens

1095
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,780
 and maybe that it's useful to see faces

1096
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:10,300
 because you might be--

1097
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,100
 - Yeah, just keep us prepared.

1098
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:12,940
 - And just you're lonely

1099
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,740
 and you want to hang out with someone.

1100
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:15,580
 - We're social creatures.

1101
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:17,420
 The only reason we've been successful as a species

1102
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:19,260
 is that we're team players and like anyone else.

1103
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,100
 What does that require?

1104
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,860
 It requires us to spot faces.

1105
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:23,700
 - Does it matter that nine out of 10 faces we spot

1106
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,940
 are actually dots on a PCOR or?

1107
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:27,940
 (laughing)

1108
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:28,980
 - You've got so many friends

1109
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,820
 until it's pointed out to you that actually--

1110
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:32,100
 (laughing)

1111
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,540
 - Eating alone in the Indian restaurant

1112
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:35,220
 at a 10-person table again.

1113
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:37,460
 (laughing)

1114
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:41,060
 - And then like to go right to the modern day,

1115
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:42,580
 if you are sitting there

1116
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:44,780
 and you think your phone is vibrating in your pocket

1117
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:46,620
 and it isn't vibrating in your pocket,

1118
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:48,220
 that's another kind of paradox.

1119
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:49,060
 - I've got that.

1120
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:50,460
 - And that's because you've got it right now.

1121
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,180
 - Not right now, but I have it almost daily.

1122
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:53,620
 - Oh, it's extremely common.

1123
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:55,100
 - I've been calling you for weeks, Dan.

1124
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:57,340
 (laughing)

1125
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,860
 - I thought I'd been chatting to you.

1126
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:02,060
 Was that the wall with a dot on it?

1127
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:04,820
 (laughing)

1128
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:07,020
 - And again, it's just the brain sort of like

1129
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:09,060
 feels some kind of vibration

1130
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,820
 and remembers all the other times it have vibrated there

1131
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:12,980
 and then just fills in the gaps.

1132
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,420
 - I get that a fair bit.

1133
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:16,820
 But Dan, do you think it's anyone in particular ringing?

1134
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:17,980
 As we know now it is Anna,

1135
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:20,500
 but do you think, do you think, oh my agent?

1136
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,700
 You know, like, if there's someone you hope is.

1137
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:23,540
 - No, no, I don't.

1138
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:24,860
 - Hello, don't try the speaking.

1139
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:25,700
 I'm free, I'm ready.

1140
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:27,780
 (laughing)

1141
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:29,740
 Half my usual rate, I'll do it.

1142
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:30,740
 - Idiot fire.

1143
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:32,340
 (laughing)

1144
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:33,980
 - Rodeo clowns are us.

1145
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:35,220
 (laughing)

1146
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:37,800
 (upbeat music)

1147
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:43,020
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show

1148
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:44,540
 and that is Andy.

1149
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:45,980
 - My fact is, across the world,

1150
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:48,940
 there are over a hundred serious collectors

1151
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:51,340
 of airline sick bags.

1152
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:52,180
 Serious.

1153
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:53,020
 - How serious?

1154
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,180
 - I'm not talking amateur hour.

1155
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:56,620
 Oh, I have a draw, but I don't do it much.

1156
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:58,180
 You know, these are players.

1157
00:37:58,180 --> 00:37:59,020
 - Yeah? - Yeah.

1158
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:01,900
 - These are traders, they are curators.

1159
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:02,900
 - Absolutely. - Yeah.

1160
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:05,060
 - There is a community and it's thriving.

1161
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:05,900
 It's hopping.

1162
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:08,580
 - How many qualifies as serious then for you?

1163
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:11,580
 - Well, I wouldn't talk to anyone

1164
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,700
 who had less than a hundred and fifty, five.

1165
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:16,180
 - I think that's fair.

1166
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:17,740
 How many do you have?

1167
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:20,940
 - I don't have any, I'm just a reporter in this world.

1168
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:22,180
 But so, I mean, the figures vary.

1169
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:23,780
 One article I read said a hundred collectors,

1170
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:25,660
 another said 250.

1171
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:28,340
 They could fit into a medium-sized theater, definitely.

1172
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:32,100
 And there are some record holders.

1173
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:34,300
 There's a guy called Nick Vermeerlund,

1174
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:37,060
 who I believe has most,

1175
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:41,900
 certainly in the mid 6,290 as per a CNN article.

1176
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:44,700
 Yeah, as of 2012, he may have collected more since,

1177
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,500
 his wife may have persuaded him to throw them out since.

1178
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:49,420
 We don't know, but he had that many then.

1179
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:52,740
 Yeah, so he's got maybe most that have ever been had.

1180
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:53,860
 - That's pretty cool. - It's not.

1181
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:55,020
 - Why do they do it?

1182
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:58,660
 - Oh, you know, you've got to pass the time, haven't you?

1183
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:00,980
 - I read one person called Steve Sildberg,

1184
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:03,020
 who told CNN that he'd collected them

1185
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:04,980
 because nobody else collects them.

1186
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:08,420
 He'll be gutted to hear this episode of Fish Money.

1187
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:09,460
 - He's great.

1188
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:12,620
 - So he has 3,000 more than,

1189
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:15,300
 and he runs airsicknessbags.com,

1190
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:17,580
 which is a really good website for those

1191
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:18,420
 wanting to get into it.

1192
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:19,740
 - It's amazing what it throws up.

1193
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:20,580
 - Oh, God.

1194
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:24,220
 - He writes, while this website and hobby

1195
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:25,980
 is an enormous waste of time,

1196
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:27,780
 I like to think it's a high-quality waste of time

1197
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:29,740
 than many other places on the web.

1198
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:30,580
 And he's just really good.

1199
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:32,940
 - Look at some of his examples on his website.

1200
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:33,780
 - Go on.

1201
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:36,340
 - The Duke makes us puke from 1988,

1202
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:38,740
 which was given out at the Republican National Convention,

1203
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:40,620
 referring to Mike Dukakis.

1204
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:41,540
 - That's good.

1205
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:45,020
 - There was the Hen Knight Party Bag from 2005,

1206
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:47,420
 which is a British sick bag.

1207
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:49,340
 And each bag displays a vomit stain

1208
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:52,860
 and exhorts you to place gob here and heave.

1209
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:54,020
 And it comes with the caveats.

1210
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:56,460
 Please dispose of properly, do not reheat,

1211
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:58,380
 not suitable for home freezing.

1212
00:39:58,380 --> 00:39:59,220
 - Jesus.

1213
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:00,220
 (laughing)

1214
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:01,300
 - So good.

1215
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,220
 His site is great.

1216
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:05,820
 So yeah, Steve or upheave Steve, as he's known.

1217
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:08,460
 He is one of the major baggists, as they're known.

1218
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:10,940
 And it is, as James is saying,

1219
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:13,140
 it's sort of like, it's not just airline bags.

1220
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:16,260
 You've got horror movies used to do novelty bags

1221
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:17,260
 that you would give out as well

1222
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:19,020
 for people that might barf in the cinema.

1223
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:20,140
 He collects those.

1224
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:22,060
 NASA, he's managed to track down a few

1225
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:24,940
 of the air sickness bags that went up with astronauts

1226
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:25,780
 and so on.

1227
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:27,620
 - Are they mostly used?

1228
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:29,860
 - No, no, no, no, these are pristine.

1229
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:30,700
 - Never used.

1230
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:33,060
 - No, of course they wouldn't fit flat in the archfiles,

1231
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:33,900
 if you--

1232
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:35,580
 - I did look for some though on eBay.

1233
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:37,340
 I did think there must be an air sick bag

1234
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:39,140
 that was vomited into by Taylor Swift

1235
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:40,580
 or something going for thousands,

1236
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:41,900
 but couldn't find anything.

1237
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,700
 - Thank God, that's your wife.

1238
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:44,980
 (laughing)

1239
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,140
 You said about the horror movies,

1240
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:47,340
 they still do that today.

1241
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:49,780
 Terrify 3 that came out earlier this year.

1242
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,500
 If you went to the first screening of that,

1243
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:52,860
 they gave you some sick bags,

1244
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:54,580
 Saw 10, which came out last year.

1245
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:55,420
 They gave it you as well.

1246
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:56,380
 - Saw 10?

1247
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:57,220
 - Yeah.

1248
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:58,300
 It was a pretty good one, Saw 10.

1249
00:40:58,300 --> 00:40:59,140
 - What was it?

1250
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:01,500
 - The Human Centipede, The Passion of the Christ,

1251
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,580
 The Mark of the Devil,

1252
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:05,340
 all different movies where they gave sick bags

1253
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:07,740
 out to the audience, especially in the screenings.

1254
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:08,980
 - The Passion of the Christ.

1255
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:11,660
 - Yeah, in Belfast, when it was shown in Belfast.

1256
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:12,500
 - Wow.

1257
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,900
 - It was a blasphemy, presumably.

1258
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:16,780
 - Actually no, because there are some violent bits in it.

1259
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:18,260
 - Oh yeah, I think it gets pretty,

1260
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:20,060
 I don't know if you'd know how the story ends, Anna,

1261
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,780
 but it's not a PG.

1262
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:23,880
 - But it's just that the sick bags are a gimmick

1263
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:26,020
 for what I assumed were B horror movies,

1264
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:27,740
 saying, "Ha ha, look how scary we are."

1265
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:28,740
 I thought The Passion of the Christ

1266
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:29,900
 took itself a bit more seriously.

1267
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:32,180
 - Yeah, I think it was like the theaters did it,

1268
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:34,820
 and I think they were trying to make a point a little bit

1269
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:37,380
 by ironically, 'cause I went to watch that in Belfast

1270
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:39,480
 and got a sick bag and vomited in it.

1271
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,320
 - You're kidding.

1272
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,160
 - But when I looked in it,

1273
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,900
 it looked just like Jesus Christ himself.

1274
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:45,740
 (both laughing)

1275
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:47,380
 - He got hit by lightning.

1276
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,220
 - Who, Mel Gibson?

1277
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:49,700
 - No, the actor who played Jesus

1278
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:50,980
 in The Passion of the Christ.

1279
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:52,740
 That's one of the famous on set stories.

1280
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:53,860
 - He got struck by lightning.

1281
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:55,380
 - It's very hard to get down from that cross

1282
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:56,980
 quickly when the storm starts.

1283
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:58,100
 (both laughing)

1284
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:00,620
 - Fortunately, the cross was made out of tonka bean tree.

1285
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:03,700
 (both laughing)

1286
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:06,340
 - The two thieves who are on either side of it,

1287
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:07,180
 they got it much more.

1288
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:10,260
 - That's how, I'm sorry, he got hit by lightning.

1289
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:11,580
 - That's a story that's online,

1290
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:13,180
 and I'm only just saying it out loud

1291
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:15,260
 'cause it's the connection between lightning and that,

1292
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:17,020
 so it might be wrong, but it's, yeah.

1293
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:19,220
 - Weirdly, one thing that always gets hit by lightning,

1294
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:21,860
 sorry, this is a telescope back to earlier in the show,

1295
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:24,700
 is the statues of Jesus that it's always happening.

1296
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:26,660
 Christ the Redeemer gets hit several times a year

1297
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:27,940
 'cause it's very busy.

1298
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:30,420
 - Yeah, on the top of a mountain

1299
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:32,060
 in a very humid part of the world.

1300
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:34,300
 - I know, but it seems like a sort of event for God

1301
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:35,660
 is zapping statues of Christ.

1302
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:36,820
 It seems like he's saying all the time,

1303
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:38,660
 "Look, I want you to try something else."

1304
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:43,660
 Anyway, Steve Silverberg, he has a loving partner,

1305
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:47,060
 we should say, of whom he says, "She's amused by it,

1306
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:49,300
 "but has no interest in getting involved."

1307
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:51,500
 And he's had some bad experiences in the past

1308
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:53,660
 before he met his lovely partner

1309
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:56,260
 of women who just didn't like it.

1310
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:58,140
 - Is there not something to raise on the first date,

1311
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:00,500
 I would say, would be my advice to a sick bank collector.

1312
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:02,180
 - That's more of a third date kind of revelation.

1313
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:03,020
 - That's exactly it.

1314
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:05,380
 So he, at one point, at his work,

1315
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:06,900
 he was introduced to a new colleague

1316
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:08,620
 and the person introducing them said,

1317
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:11,820
 "This is Steve, he works in IT and he collects sick bags

1318
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:14,420
 "and we've never got on from then onwards."

1319
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:17,060
 I think that's a tough introduction to recover from.

1320
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:19,500
 - It's all right, well, all right.

1321
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,180
 - He's great though, I think he's really cool.

1322
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:25,940
 - The sick bag was invented by Gilmore Tillman Schendhal

1323
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:29,300
 in 1949, who later made the world's first

1324
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:31,100
 communication satellite.

1325
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:33,220
 It was a way that you could have live television

1326
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:34,920
 that was going from one side of America

1327
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:36,780
 to the other by bouncing it off this satellite

1328
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:37,620
 that he invented.

1329
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:38,460
 - That's cool.

1330
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:39,780
 - And it was the same technology really,

1331
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:41,620
 'cause he made plastics.

1332
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:45,860
 And he invented the idea of being able to put plastic

1333
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:49,020
 on the inside of a bag so that when you throw up in it,

1334
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:50,100
 it doesn't all leak out.

1335
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:51,180
 - It's pretty obvious, isn't it?

1336
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:52,940
 You've got plastic bags, you've got paper bags,

1337
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:54,300
 he just put them together.

1338
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:55,140
 - Someone needed to do it.

1339
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:55,980
 - I could have done that.

1340
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:57,340
 - Someone needed to, and he did it.

1341
00:43:57,340 --> 00:43:58,180
 - I could have done that.

1342
00:43:58,180 --> 00:43:59,980
 I couldn't have made the first satellite,

1343
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:01,340
 but I could have done the bag thing.

1344
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:03,620
 - But the satellite thing was, again, it was plastics.

1345
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:06,740
 And what he invented was the thing that allowed everything

1346
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:09,820
 to be stuck to the satellite without all falling off.

1347
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:10,660
 - Okay.

1348
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:12,220
 - Basically, all the reflective stuff.

1349
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:15,020
 - And he's kind of more known for the bag, isn't he,

1350
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:17,540
 than the satellite, and that really annoyed him in his day.

1351
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:18,380
 - No, it did.

1352
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:20,380
 In his life title, all the quotes from his wife and so on

1353
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:21,980
 just said this is what dogged him his whole life.

1354
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:23,860
 Everyone always brought up the sick bags

1355
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:24,700
 rather than him.

1356
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:25,540
 - It's 'cause most people can't collect

1357
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:26,540
 communication satellites.

1358
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:29,340
 I still think a little bit of a sense of humor failure, mate.

1359
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:31,100
 I think you've got to own it, right?

1360
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:33,180
 - Yeah, I agree, I totally agree.

1361
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:35,220
 Interestingly, there's a big complaint going on around

1362
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:37,180
 the world right now amongst the baggists,

1363
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:39,020
 because it's a dying art.

1364
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:41,820
 Sick bags aren't as prominent as they used to be.

1365
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:42,820
 And if they are there now,

1366
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:45,380
 they kind of plain largely in a lot of cases.

1367
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:46,420
 There used to be great designs,

1368
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:48,140
 like there's a deer vomiting on one,

1369
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:51,220
 which is apparently really loved, beautiful design.

1370
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:52,540
 There's funny jokes on a bunch of them.

1371
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:55,180
 Now, because plane flights are getting less turbulent

1372
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:56,860
 because we're flying so much higher,

1373
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:58,100
 it's getting a bit more safer.

1374
00:44:58,100 --> 00:44:59,380
 People aren't using them as much.

1375
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:00,780
 So air sickness is going down,

1376
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:01,620
 hence they're investing.

1377
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:03,380
 - Well, do you know, actually, I looked into this

1378
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:05,540
 and people have never been sick on planes.

1379
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:08,220
 Even the 1930s, they did a study of 0.2%

1380
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:10,140
 of people with sick on planes they found.

1381
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:12,460
 I don't know why we've been using them for so long.

1382
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:13,900
 They, and I have always thought...

1383
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:16,060
 - Well, I mean, if you're on an aeroplane

1384
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:19,380
 and there's 600 people, someone's gonna get sick, right?

1385
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:20,660
 If it's 0.2%.

1386
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:21,540
 - When it's that rare,

1387
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:22,900
 and I don't want to put the responsibility

1388
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:23,740
 always on the individual,

1389
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:25,700
 but just bring your own sick bag.

1390
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:29,020
 - Are you sure that I think--

1391
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:31,700
 - I don't think that if I'm working on that aeroplane

1392
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:33,100
 and someone's getting sick,

1393
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:34,060
 I don't want to be, well,

1394
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:35,500
 I don't mind if you vomit everywhere

1395
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:37,300
 because you should have brought your own bag.

1396
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:38,140
 - Fair enough, fair enough.

1397
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:39,620
 - It's your seat, you know, you pay for it,

1398
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:40,580
 you do your own it.

1399
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:42,460
 And also, I think if someone gets off the plane

1400
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:43,860
 that they haven't used their sick bag,

1401
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:45,340
 you don't have to replace it.

1402
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:46,980
 - That's a good point. - So it's a relatively low cost.

1403
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:49,260
 Once every seat has one sick bag,

1404
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:51,900
 you only need to replace one sick bag every 500 flights.

1405
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:53,140
 - That's a really good point.

1406
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:54,940
 - The Hermes Birkin bag.

1407
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:57,420
 Anna, I know you're deep in the world of high fashion.

1408
00:45:57,420 --> 00:45:58,540
 - I am, yes, yes.

1409
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:00,340
 - Jane Birkin. - It's one of my favorite bags.

1410
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:01,180
 - Yeah, Jane Birkin.

1411
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:02,740
 - I've been reading nonstop about that bag.

1412
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:05,780
 Well, it started as a drawing on an airline sick bag.

1413
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:06,900
 Cool. - Sorry, what is it?

1414
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:07,740
 - It's a bag.

1415
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:09,460
 It's a very famous fashionable bag.

1416
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:10,300
 - Oh.

1417
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:11,900
 - It's got a picture of a vomiting tear on it.

1418
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:13,620
 (laughing)

1419
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:14,780
 - And it's not a sick bag.

1420
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:16,180
 - No, it's not. - It's not a fashionable sick bag.

1421
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:17,500
 - It's just a fashionable bag.

1422
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:20,100
 You can be sick in it, help yourself.

1423
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:21,780
 - If you bought it, no one's stopping you.

1424
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:24,820
 It'll be the most expensive truck up of your life.

1425
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:27,580
 - She was a very famous actor and singer,

1426
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:30,020
 both in England and France during the '70s.

1427
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:32,380
 And yeah, she was sort of an it girl

1428
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:34,940
 as well as being a super talented singer.

1429
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:36,660
 - Well, she was also good at drawing bags.

1430
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:39,140
 She ended up on a flight next to the head of Hermes.

1431
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:42,180
 And she told him I always need a big bag

1432
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:43,780
 to carry all my stuff around.

1433
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:45,220
 I think she might have been a recent mom at the time

1434
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:46,820
 and you know you need a lot of paraphernalia.

1435
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:49,140
 - I feel like he saw her bag fall down

1436
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:50,340
 and all the bits fell out.

1437
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:52,140
 And they wanted to design something

1438
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:52,980
 that meant everything to her.

1439
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:53,820
 - Something just workshopped.

1440
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:56,460
 I mean, I think this story has given a lot more creators

1441
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:58,700
 that they designed a slightly bigger bag basically.

1442
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:01,100
 Like the story of how she drew this bag

1443
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:02,900
 on the L1 sick bag, she drew a bag.

1444
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:04,780
 - This is as impressive as putting a plastic bag

1445
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:06,660
 inside a paper bag, you know.

1446
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:08,300
 You made a bit of a bigger bag.

1447
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:09,980
 Well done. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1448
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:11,580
 - Some other stuff on collectors.

1449
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:13,140
 - Oh, yeah. - Yeah.

1450
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:16,620
 - The largest collection of silver coins in the world

1451
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:20,460
 exists thanks to cost 11 crisis.

1452
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:22,460
 That was a crisis that was had

1453
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:26,600
 by Jose Manuel Costa-Lavin, a Mexican man.

1454
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:27,440
 - Oh my God.

1455
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:29,260
 - Yeah, Costa-Lavin.

1456
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:30,500
 - Costa-Lavin crisis.

1457
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:32,260
 - Oh, wow.

1458
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:35,180
 - Jose Manuel Costa-Lavin got cancer

1459
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:37,180
 and decided to distract himself from the cancer

1460
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:40,460
 by traveling the world looking for silver coins.

1461
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:41,940
 Now he's clear of cancer

1462
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:43,500
 and has the world's largest collection.

1463
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:45,300
 - Okay, I've just got a few questions.

1464
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:46,540
 (laughing)

1465
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:49,340
 - About the process of how you got to this fact.

1466
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:51,980
 Did you start with the pun and find the fact

1467
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:53,460
 that the fact appeared in you?

1468
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:56,460
 - I went through the Guinness World Records website

1469
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:57,820
 and looked for all the collectors,

1470
00:47:57,820 --> 00:48:00,380
 which I think is about 120 pages.

1471
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:01,940
 - Okay. - And looked for any funny names.

1472
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:06,940
 So the largest collection of irons is 30,071

1473
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:12,140
 by a guy called Ion Chirescu from Romania.

1474
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:15,020
 And the largest collection of Pikachu memorabilia

1475
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:17,380
 is by someone called Lisa Courtney.

1476
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:19,420
 - Oh, Courtney. - Courtney Pokemon.

1477
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:21,780
 - Courtney Pokemon. - Oh, nice.

1478
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:23,900
 - And the largest collection of Superman memorabilia

1479
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:26,580
 is by a guy called Perfecto P. Ball Hag.

1480
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:30,300
 - Okay, so that's just an outright funny about name.

1481
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:31,140
 - Just a funny name.

1482
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:33,300
 - Perfecto P. Ball Hag.

1483
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:34,860
 Mr. and Mrs. Ball Hag.

1484
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:36,260
 He's gonna have a tough time in the playground.

1485
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:37,900
 We gotta give him a name.

1486
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:38,740
 - No, no, it's worse.

1487
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:40,060
 Actually, sorry, I misread it.

1488
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:42,580
 It's Perfecto P. Ball Hag, Jr.

1489
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:45,860
 (all laughing)

1490
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:47,780
 - It's toughen me up.

1491
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:48,820
 It'll toughen him up.

1492
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:51,400
 (all laughing)

1493
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:56,960
 (upbeat music)

1494
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:01,180
 - Okay, that's it.

1495
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:02,220
 That is all of our facts.

1496
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:03,780
