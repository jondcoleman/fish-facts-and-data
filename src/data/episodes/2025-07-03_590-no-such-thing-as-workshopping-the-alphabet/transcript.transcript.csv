00:00:00,00:00:02,(upbeat music)
00:00:02,00:00:16,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:00:16,00:00:17,"of No Such Thing as a Fish,"
00:00:17,00:00:22,a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Hoburn.
00:00:22,00:00:23,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:23,00:00:26,"I am sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray"
00:00:26,00:00:27,and Anna Tyshinski.
00:00:27,00:00:29,"And once again, we have gathered"
00:00:29,00:00:31,around the microphones with our four favorite facts
00:00:31,00:00:32,from the last seven days.
00:00:32,00:00:36,"And in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:36,00:00:39,"Starting with fact number one, and that is James."
00:00:39,00:00:42,"- Okay, my fact this week is that the komaru"
00:00:42,00:00:45,is the only species that gets better at reproducing
00:00:45,00:00:47,when it has been struck by lightning.
00:00:47,00:00:49,(laughing)
00:00:49,00:00:52,- It's quite cartoonish the way you've made it sound.
00:00:52,00:00:53,- Yeah.
00:00:53,00:00:55,"- Like the lightning goes in, it goes (sneezes)"
00:00:55,00:00:57,"and then it's better at reproducing, right?"
00:00:57,00:01:00,Get your minds out of the gutter of people at home
00:01:00,00:01:03,because the komaru is a type of tree.
00:01:03,00:01:07,"It is a, well, specifically the tonka bean tree."
00:01:07,00:01:10,And a load of scientists have been looking
00:01:10,00:01:13,at lightning strikes in Panama
00:01:13,00:01:14,and they've looked at all the different trees
00:01:14,00:01:15,that have been struck.
00:01:15,00:01:17,And actually it's over a 40 year period
00:01:17,00:01:18,that they've done this.
00:01:18,00:01:21,"And they found that if you're a tree,"
00:01:21,00:01:23,you're substantially more likely to die
00:01:23,00:01:26,if you live next to a tonka bean tree.
00:01:26,00:01:27,- Yeah.
00:01:27,00:01:30,- And it's because they get struck by lightning a lot.
00:01:30,00:01:31,"And when they get struck by lightning,"
00:01:31,00:01:33,the lightning sort of bounces off them
00:01:33,00:01:35,and goes to these other trees and kills these trees.
00:01:35,00:01:36,- It's crazy.
00:01:36,00:01:39,"- They also have parasites, sort of vines and stuff on them."
00:01:39,00:01:42,And the lightning kills those vines as well.
00:01:42,00:01:44,"And as a result, when they've been struck by lightning"
00:01:44,00:01:45,"a number of times,"
00:01:45,00:01:49,they have a 14 fold increase in lifetime seed production.
00:01:49,00:01:52,So they create more seeds when they've been struck by lightning
00:01:52,00:01:55,because they get rid of all the competition and stuff.
00:01:55,00:01:56,And that makes it better for them to reproduce.
00:01:56,00:01:57,- It's amazing as well
00:01:57,00:01:59,'cause there must be a lot of these trees.
00:01:59,00:02:01,"It's not like it's just a single tree out there, right?"
00:02:01,00:02:04,"There's tons, but within its own lifetime,"
00:02:04,00:02:06,after maturity will be struck
00:02:06,00:02:08,by at least five different bolts of lightning.
00:02:08,00:02:10,"I mean, that's insane."
00:02:10,00:02:11,"Yeah, five times."
00:02:11,00:02:14,- Also imagine having one child
00:02:14,00:02:15,and then you're struck by lightning
00:02:15,00:02:16,and then you have 14 children.
00:02:16,00:02:17,- Yeah.
00:02:17,00:02:18,- That's very stressful.
00:02:18,00:02:19,- You mean that's what's going on?
00:02:19,00:02:21,"- Well, James was just saying they're 14 times"
00:02:21,00:02:23,more romantically successful.
00:02:23,00:02:25,"- It's bad enough being struck by lightning,"
00:02:25,00:02:27,but then if you have to look after a lot of kids afterwards.
00:02:27,00:02:28,- I see.
00:02:28,00:02:29,Even worse.
00:02:29,00:02:30,- Salt in the wound.
00:02:30,00:02:31,- Exactly.
00:02:31,00:02:33,"Fortunately trees are very, very, very bad parents"
00:02:33,00:02:33,in general.
00:02:33,00:02:35,- They just had their hands off on me.
00:02:35,00:02:37,(all laughing)
00:02:37,00:02:38,- They're big old trees as well.
00:02:38,00:02:41,"130 feet, they can get up to, I mean, these are gigantic."
00:02:41,00:02:43,- Which makes them more likely to be struck by lightning
00:02:43,00:02:45,"of course, 'cause they're often the tallest tree"
00:02:45,00:02:46,in the canopy.
00:02:46,00:02:47,- Yeah.
00:02:47,00:02:47,"It's strange, isn't it?"
00:02:47,00:02:50,"'Cause lots of trees, when they're hit by lightning,"
00:02:50,00:02:51,"I think we might've said this in the past,"
00:02:51,00:02:53,they will explode.
00:02:53,00:02:54,- Oh yeah.
00:02:54,00:02:56,- And that's 'cause the temperature just gets so hot
00:02:56,00:02:58,inside and they explode.
00:02:58,00:03:01,- 'Cause they have water in there and the water expands
00:03:01,00:03:03,because it's heated up so much.
00:03:03,00:03:04,- Exactly.
00:03:04,00:03:06,And there's this theory that the...
00:03:06,00:03:07,Is it Kumaru?
00:03:07,00:03:08,"Is it Kumaru, Kumaru?"
00:03:08,00:03:10,"- Well, I'm gonna call it a Kumaru"
00:03:10,00:03:12,because I find that a funny word.
00:03:12,00:03:13,- And that's your right.
00:03:13,00:03:13,It's your right.
00:03:13,00:03:15,(all laughing)
00:03:15,00:03:16,- It's Kumaru.
00:03:16,00:03:17,"- Kumaru, okay."
00:03:17,00:03:20,There's this theory that these trees have
00:03:20,00:03:22,"really high internal conductivity,"
00:03:22,00:03:24,so they're like a wire already almost.
00:03:24,00:03:26,So that means that the lightning can flow through them
00:03:26,00:03:30,"without building up that massive blasting heat inside,"
00:03:30,00:03:30,which will kill it.
00:03:30,00:03:33,"Which is very, I mean, presumably that's evolved."
00:03:33,00:03:34,- Yeah.
00:03:34,00:03:35,- Yeah.
00:03:35,00:03:35,- Yeah.
00:03:35,00:03:36,- Hasn't everything.
00:03:36,00:03:38,"- That's a solid point, yeah."
00:03:38,00:03:40,- Do you know who's most likely to get struck
00:03:40,00:03:41,by lightning?
00:03:41,00:03:43,What outdoor activity?
00:03:43,00:03:45,"- Oh, so I would say golfers."
00:03:45,00:03:48,"- Andy, you always talk about golf, honestly."
00:03:48,00:03:51,- The ladder carrying championships of Estonia.
00:03:51,00:03:52,(all laughing)
00:03:52,00:03:53,- Very risky at all.
00:03:53,00:03:57,- The Tonka Bean climbing championships in Panama.
00:03:57,00:03:59,There is a common misconception that golfers
00:03:59,00:04:02,are the most likely to be struck by lightning
00:04:02,00:04:04,because they are outside.
00:04:04,00:04:05,- Metal rods.
00:04:05,00:04:07,"- Metal rods, big metal golf clubs,"
00:04:07,00:04:08,and they're holding with them.
00:04:08,00:04:10,But there has been a study and they found
00:04:10,00:04:13,"the most common is football, actually."
00:04:13,00:04:14,"- Oh, really?"
00:04:14,00:04:17,- And the reason being that people will carry on playing
00:04:17,00:04:19,"football, that soccer I'm talking about,"
00:04:19,00:04:22,and they'll carry on playing in bad weather.
00:04:22,00:04:24,- Whereas golfers are just looking for an excuse
00:04:24,00:04:25,"to go inside and drink a beer, aren't they?"
00:04:25,00:04:27,"- Yeah, but honestly, if you play golf"
00:04:27,00:04:28,"and you hear any thunder, you have to come in,"
00:04:28,00:04:29,that's the rule.
00:04:29,00:04:30,"- Oh, really?"
00:04:30,00:04:31,- I thought you weren't meant to come in?
00:04:31,00:04:32,I thought you were meant to lie down on the ground
00:04:32,00:04:34,with your bottom in the air.
00:04:34,00:04:36,- That's not a specific golf rule.
00:04:36,00:04:38,- What is that?
00:04:38,00:04:40,- Are you thinking of an off-stretch?
00:04:40,00:04:42,"- As we're doing this, the US Open Golf"
00:04:42,00:04:44,has just started in Oatbunt.
00:04:44,00:04:46,"And I think if there's any lightning there,"
00:04:46,00:04:49,you won't see Rory McElroy and Scotty Sheffler
00:04:49,00:04:51,taking down their trousers.
00:04:51,00:04:54,- I've been saying trousers.
00:04:54,00:04:55,- You definitely added that.
00:04:55,00:04:58,"- But it's easier if the trousers are off,"
00:04:58,00:04:59,so you can pop the flag in the top.
00:04:59,00:05:01,(laughing)
00:05:01,00:05:03,"- No, that is, there is a theory,"
00:05:03,00:05:05,and this is more generally if you're stuck outside
00:05:05,00:05:09,"in the lightning, that if you're lower down, obviously,"
00:05:09,00:05:10,"they're slightly to be struck,"
00:05:10,00:05:13,so you should kind of go on your haunches.
00:05:13,00:05:15,"And if you put your bum in the air,"
00:05:15,00:05:17,then the electricity will hit your bum
00:05:17,00:05:20,and travel down to the earth without going into your brain.
00:05:20,00:05:21,- Thank you. - Really?
00:05:21,00:05:21,- That's a sensible save.
00:05:21,00:05:22,- Hold it once.
00:05:22,00:05:23,- Saved your...
00:05:23,00:05:25,(laughing)
00:05:25,00:05:27,But we've said in the past
00:05:27,00:05:30,that it's really dangerous for humans.
00:05:30,00:05:31,- Lighting.
00:05:31,00:05:32,(laughing)
00:05:32,00:05:35,- One of those controversial podcasts.
00:05:35,00:05:38,- But we've also pointed out that between 85 and 90%
00:05:38,00:05:39,of people who are struck by lightning survive.
00:05:39,00:05:41,"They do have long-term life damages,"
00:05:41,00:05:43,but they do manage to survive.
00:05:43,00:05:45,- And do you guys read about Ray Caldwell?
00:05:45,00:05:46,- No.
00:05:46,00:05:47,"- Okay, he was a baseball player."
00:05:47,00:05:49,He was playing for the Cleveland Indians
00:05:49,00:05:50,versus the Philadelphia Athletics.
00:05:50,00:05:52,This was in 1919.
00:05:52,00:05:54,"He's just joined this team, and it is his first match."
00:05:54,00:05:56,He needs it to go well.
00:05:56,00:05:57,And he pitches the whole match.
00:05:57,00:05:59,"There's nine innings, he's pitched eight."
00:05:59,00:06:02,"On the ninth inning, that suddenly a thunderstorm hits,"
00:06:02,00:06:04,"lightning cracks down, strikes him,"
00:06:04,00:06:06,"everyone sees him get struck by it, they run to him,"
00:06:06,00:06:08,"he gets back up and says,"
00:06:08,00:06:09,"""I've got to make a good impression."""
00:06:09,00:06:12,And he pitches the final few pitches
00:06:12,00:06:13,and gets a guy out.
00:06:13,00:06:14,"- And when he threw it, like,"
00:06:14,00:06:15,"was the ball, like, super electric?"
00:06:15,00:06:18,(laughing)
00:06:18,00:06:19,- Gosh.
00:06:19,00:06:20,- There's one thing that you can do
00:06:20,00:06:24,that will help you survive in a lightning strike.
00:06:24,00:06:24,- Yeah.
00:06:24,00:06:27,- And that is having a wet head.
00:06:27,00:06:29,And this is due to the fact
00:06:29,00:06:31,"that the lightning will hit your head,"
00:06:31,00:06:34,but then the water will conduct it down away
00:06:34,00:06:37,"from your brain, and it might go over your whole body"
00:06:37,00:06:39,rather than just going straight into your brain.
00:06:39,00:06:43,"And also, because you have got water on your head,"
00:06:43,00:06:44,it's not as hot.
00:06:44,00:06:45,- Yeah.
00:06:45,00:06:47,- So your brain doesn't get boiled.
00:06:47,00:06:50,- So it will turn the water to steam.
00:06:50,00:06:52,"- Yeah, yeah, I mean, it's still very likely"
00:06:52,00:06:54,"to do you a lot of damage, but it can help slightly."
00:06:54,00:06:57,"- If it's between standing outside in the rain,"
00:06:57,00:06:59,"saying, ""I need to get my head wet,"
00:06:59,00:07:00,"""so I'm okay,"" and going inside."
00:07:00,00:07:01,- Go inside.
00:07:01,00:07:03,"- Right, that's first thing going inside,"
00:07:03,00:07:05,"but failing that head wet. - So I think in all circumstances,"
00:07:05,00:07:08,"if there's a lightning storm, you're safer indoors."
00:07:08,00:07:10,"- Well, well."
00:07:10,00:07:10,- Uh-oh.
00:07:10,00:07:14,- That was a terrific piece.
00:07:14,00:07:15,This was two years ago.
00:07:15,00:07:16,I think it was in the Guardian.
00:07:16,00:07:17,There's a guy called Aidan Rowan.
00:07:17,00:07:18,"And the headline was,"
00:07:18,00:07:21,"""I was struck by lightning while sitting on my sofa."""
00:07:21,00:07:24,"Okay, and this was a guy, he was at home,"
00:07:24,00:07:27,"lived in Abingdon, which is small towns."
00:07:27,00:07:29,- Oldest town in the UK?
00:07:29,00:07:30,- Lovely.
00:07:30,00:07:33,"Well, he was at home, he was playing on his PlayStation."
00:07:33,00:07:36,"The window was open, the weather was a bit bad,"
00:07:36,00:07:37,"but you know, it's nice to have a bit of fresh air sometimes"
00:07:37,00:07:38,on the weather's bed.
00:07:38,00:07:40,"- Sometimes when it's thundering and lightning,"
00:07:40,00:07:43,"it's quite, you know, electrical air is really nice."
00:07:43,00:07:44,- Wonderful.
00:07:44,00:07:46,"- Yeah, it's absolutely fine."
00:07:46,00:07:48,- There was a huge crack.
00:07:48,00:07:50,"Get your mind out of it, stop."
00:07:50,00:07:52,"Get off the girl's floor, stop."
00:07:52,00:07:58,He heard a huge noise of thunder.
00:07:58,00:07:59,Then it felt like someone had dropped
00:07:59,00:08:00,something very heavy on him.
00:08:00,00:08:02,He smelt singed flesh.
00:08:02,00:08:05,"And like, basically, his arm was burning"
00:08:05,00:08:08,sort of like scaling and boiled and all of this.
00:08:08,00:08:09,"And like, he and his husband went to hospital"
00:08:09,00:08:12,and it turned out lightning had bounced off water droplets
00:08:12,00:08:14,on his window sill and into the room.
00:08:14,00:08:16,"- Oh, clever."
00:08:16,00:08:17,"- Final destination stuff, isn't it?"
00:08:17,00:08:18,- It is.
00:08:18,00:08:20,"- Well, remember, I got mocked on this very show"
00:08:20,00:08:23,for having mentioned that I shouldn't be taking baths
00:08:23,00:08:25,"during lightning storms, 'cause remember,"
00:08:25,00:08:26,it could travel through the pipes.
00:08:26,00:08:28,Remember the lady who was blown out the bath?
00:08:28,00:08:30,(all laughing)
00:08:30,00:08:32,- There was a huge crack there as well.
00:08:32,00:08:35,"- But he said, it's lucky, so this is a tip"
00:08:35,00:08:36,if you're playing on your PlayStation
00:08:36,00:08:37,and the weather's bad.
00:08:37,00:08:38,"He said, one doctor said it was lucky"
00:08:38,00:08:40,that I had my foot on the floor
00:08:40,00:08:41,"while I was playing the game,"
00:08:41,00:08:42,otherwise I wouldn't have been grounded.
00:08:42,00:08:45,And he could have been completely killed by that.
00:08:45,00:08:47,"But he's a blacksmith, which is interesting."
00:08:47,00:08:49,"- Yeah, no nice detail, thanks."
00:08:49,00:08:51,"- It was like Thor, Thor and Hammer and-"
00:08:51,00:08:54,"- Yeah, yeah, and also that he's a God of Thunder."
00:08:54,00:08:57,How do we know that it bounced off that water droplet?
00:08:57,00:08:59,"I just, it feels like something"
00:08:59,00:09:01,that no one could possibly have documented.
00:09:01,00:09:02,- You're right.
00:09:02,00:09:03,"- Oh, I saw it."
00:09:03,00:09:05,- Maybe there was an initial contact burn
00:09:05,00:09:06,"on the windowsill, perhaps, I don't know."
00:09:06,00:09:08,"- I see, I see."
00:09:08,00:09:10,"- But he then, I find this interesting,"
00:09:10,00:09:11,he bought a lottery ticket just to check
00:09:11,00:09:13,if he'd become psychic.
00:09:13,00:09:14,And he won six quid.
00:09:14,00:09:17,(all laughing)
00:09:17,00:09:20,"- Did he deliberately think, well, I am psychic now,"
00:09:20,00:09:21,but I don't want to go for the main numbers
00:09:21,00:09:23,"because then everyone's gonna, you know."
00:09:23,00:09:24,"- You don't want to have pressure touch,"
00:09:24,00:09:25,"like man, hit by lightning then wins lottery."
00:09:25,00:09:26,You got the pressure-
00:09:26,00:09:27,- You just go for six quid.
00:09:27,00:09:31,'Cause if you won six quid 100 times every week.
00:09:31,00:09:32,- The dream amount to win on the lottery
00:09:32,00:09:34,is enough to buy you another ticket plus a bit.
00:09:34,00:09:35,- Yes.
00:09:35,00:09:37,- That's the way to fly low under the radar
00:09:37,00:09:39,and steadily build up a million pounds.
00:09:39,00:09:40,- Very true.
00:09:40,00:09:42,"- I, why psychic?"
00:09:42,00:09:43,I would have thought he bought it
00:09:43,00:09:45,because he thought maybe I'm really lucky.
00:09:45,00:09:47,I survive being hit by lightning.
00:09:47,00:09:48,"- 'Cause his brain might have, you know,"
00:09:48,00:09:50,"I mean, I don't need to go into the details."
00:09:50,00:09:51,- Yeah.
00:09:51,00:09:53,"- A lot of people think, and there are stories"
00:09:53,00:09:56,all over history of things being cured by lightning.
00:09:56,00:09:58,"It's one of the tribe, nothing else has worked."
00:09:58,00:09:59,Like there was quite a lot of people say
00:09:59,00:10:02,that they have blindness and deafness cured.
00:10:02,00:10:06,- I just another case where it just seems so improbable
00:10:06,00:10:07,that you could survive.
00:10:07,00:10:09,"I found a guy called Casey Wagner,"
00:10:09,00:10:12,who was out attending a fun day of an event
00:10:12,00:10:13,called Rednecks with Paychecks.
00:10:13,00:10:14,And he was sitting under a tree
00:10:14,00:10:16,"when he got hit by lightning, okay?"
00:10:16,00:10:18,It shot his body upwards.
00:10:18,00:10:20,- I bet he did hit a redneck after that.
00:10:20,00:10:23,(all laughing)
00:10:23,00:10:24,- People could see this happening.
00:10:24,00:10:26,He got hit by a second bolt of lightning.
00:10:26,00:10:28,He got hit twice.
00:10:28,00:10:30,"And what it hit, this is so unfortunate"
00:10:30,00:10:32,'cause you wonder if he was wearing normal shoes.
00:10:32,00:10:33,"- It might not have happened,"
00:10:33,00:10:35,but he happened to be a rodeo clown
00:10:35,00:10:37,"and he was wearing his clown shoes,"
00:10:37,00:10:39,which are obviously longer than your regular shoes.
00:10:39,00:10:40,- Is a rodeo clown a real clown?
00:10:40,00:10:41,"- I guess so, yeah."
00:10:41,00:10:42,- I'm sorry for the ignorance.
00:10:42,00:10:43,I just thought it was an insult.
00:10:43,00:10:46,- It's like somebody's badly prepared for a rodeo.
00:10:46,00:10:46,- Oh!
00:10:46,00:10:48,- But you're saying it's an actual clown at the rodeo.
00:10:48,00:10:49,- It's the reverse of someone saying
00:10:49,00:10:51,this isn't my first rodeo.
00:10:51,00:10:52,- Yeah.
00:10:52,00:10:53,- Yes.
00:10:53,00:10:54,"- Hang on, is rodeo clown even a phrase?"
00:10:54,00:10:56,Don't you know it is a phrase?
00:10:56,00:10:56,- I know that phrase.
00:10:56,00:10:58,- I read it as I took it.
00:10:58,00:10:59,It says his job as a rodeo clown.
00:10:59,00:11:01,You don't have a job as someone who's an idiot
00:11:01,00:11:02,or rocking up.
00:11:02,00:11:03,- So a rodeo clown?
00:11:03,00:11:05,(laughing)
00:11:05,00:11:06,- Don't throw stones.
00:11:06,00:11:08,- I think after these 12 years you can call that a job.
00:11:08,00:11:11,(laughing)
00:11:11,00:11:15,- You're saying that...
00:11:15,00:11:16,- Can I just say around this table
00:11:16,00:11:18,only one of us has heard the phrase rodeo clown.
00:11:18,00:11:19,- Yeah.
00:11:19,00:11:20,"- No two, right?"
00:11:20,00:11:21,Andy and Dan.
00:11:21,00:11:22,"- No, Dan thought it was a job."
00:11:22,00:11:23,- So you know what?
00:11:23,00:11:24,"The fishing box, I know."
00:11:24,00:11:25,'Cause I do the emails.
00:11:25,00:11:26,It's gonna be absolutely stuffed with
00:11:26,00:11:29,how dare you disrespect the ancient profession
00:11:29,00:11:29,of rodeo clown.
00:11:29,00:11:33,"I've been a rodeo clown nine years, man and boy."
00:11:33,00:11:34,So what happened with his shoes?
00:11:34,00:11:35,Sorry?
00:11:35,00:11:36,"- Well, it struck his shoe."
00:11:36,00:11:39,I've extrapolated the idea to think that maybe his shoe
00:11:39,00:11:41,was longer 'cause it was a clown shoe.
00:11:41,00:11:42,(laughing)
00:11:42,00:11:43,And all that water in a squirty buttonhole
00:11:43,00:11:45,will have boiled immediately.
00:11:45,00:11:47,(laughing)
00:11:47,00:11:49,- Can I quickly mention something about Tonka trees?
00:11:49,00:11:50,"- Yeah, go for it."
00:11:50,00:11:55,"- So Tonka beans are delicious, but lethal."
00:11:55,00:11:58,"So if you eat too many of them,"
00:11:58,00:12:01,"like in sheep, five grams, about two teaspoons is fatal."
00:12:01,00:12:03,"In humans, we don't really know what's fatal"
00:12:03,00:12:05,"because we can't really do that experiment,"
00:12:05,00:12:08,but it is illegal to use Tonka beans
00:12:08,00:12:10,in your food in America.
00:12:10,00:12:12,"And for a long time, they used it"
00:12:12,00:12:14,"'cause it tastes really delicious,"
00:12:14,00:12:17,"like a vanilla, licorice, caramel, loaves."
00:12:17,00:12:21,They used it in ice cream and stuff for a long time.
00:12:21,00:12:23,"In America now, still, if you go to a really,"
00:12:23,00:12:25,"really, really, really posh restaurant,"
00:12:25,00:12:27,then they will still serve you Tonka stuff
00:12:27,00:12:28,even though it's illegal.
00:12:28,00:12:31,"- I love this, it's like the secret illegal bean."
00:12:31,00:12:32,And it's--
00:12:32,00:12:34,"- But it's just on menus, openly."
00:12:34,00:12:38,"- Yeah, it's 'cause of this chemical inside the bean"
00:12:38,00:12:39,called Kumarin.
00:12:39,00:12:42,"And also, the amount of Kumarin you'd have to consume"
00:12:42,00:12:44,"equates to so many beans,"
00:12:44,00:12:46,which equates to so many puddings at the restaurant.
00:12:46,00:12:49,"I read that as a human, you'd have to eat one gram"
00:12:49,00:12:51,"of Kumarin, not of Tonka beans,"
00:12:51,00:12:53,of the chemical that's extracted
00:12:53,00:12:54,to experience any ill effects whatsoever.
00:12:54,00:12:57,That equates to about 30 beans worth of Kumarin.
00:12:57,00:13:00,And that would be about 250 puddings at this--
00:13:00,00:13:04,"- That's true, although the actual limit,"
00:13:04,00:13:06,"as in, if the FDA did have a limit,"
00:13:06,00:13:08,"or if the EU had a limit,"
00:13:08,00:13:10,it would be a quarter of a Tonka bean.
00:13:10,00:13:13,And the reason is because we can't test it on humans
00:13:13,00:13:14,about what's good for you or bad for you.
00:13:14,00:13:17,"So what they do is they test it on an animal,"
00:13:17,00:13:19,"and then they say, okay, well, that's what that is"
00:13:19,00:13:21,for a baboon or for a dog or whatever.
00:13:21,00:13:23,We're gonna multiply it by 100
00:13:23,00:13:24,for the human safety factor.
00:13:24,00:13:26,And that's how they work out the human safety factors.
00:13:26,00:13:28,They have like a massive window.
00:13:28,00:13:30,- That is so cautious.
00:13:30,00:13:31,"- I know, but that's how they do it."
00:13:31,00:13:31,"- That's too much, isn't it?"
00:13:31,00:13:33,"- The delicious puddings we're missing out on,"
00:13:33,00:13:34,there are secret puddings all over the world
00:13:34,00:13:35,that we're not allowed to have.
00:13:35,00:13:37,"- We're allowed to have it, we're not American."
00:13:37,00:13:37,- It's just the Americans.
00:13:37,00:13:39,"- We're gonna have Tonka beans, upper asses?"
00:13:39,00:13:42,(all laughing)
00:13:42,00:13:43,"- While you're on the golf course,"
00:13:43,00:13:44,"I'll just pop this in here, madam,"
00:13:44,00:13:47,and I hope you enjoy those rich flavors.
00:13:47,00:13:49,(all laughing)
00:13:49,00:13:51,- I don't even know what I was trying to say.
00:13:51,00:13:52,Do you know what it's also in?
00:13:52,00:13:54,I really didn't know this.
00:13:54,00:13:56,"So the kumaran, this thing that's poisonous,"
00:13:56,00:13:57,"very slightly poisonous,"
00:13:57,00:13:59,"or in very small amounts in these things,"
00:13:59,00:14:01,"it's also in cinnamon,"
00:14:01,00:14:04,but that's only because cinnamon isn't really cinnamon.
00:14:04,00:14:06,I did not know this.
00:14:06,00:14:08,Check the cinnamon in your cupboard.
00:14:08,00:14:10,"It doesn't, most of it is not true cinnamon,"
00:14:10,00:14:13,"which comes from the bark of the cinnamonum virum,"
00:14:13,00:14:15,and that's native to Sri Lanka.
00:14:15,00:14:19,"It's actually from a plant called the cassia, cassia cinnamon,"
00:14:19,00:14:22,"which is, which is not true cinnamon at all,"
00:14:22,00:14:23,even though it's claiming to be.
00:14:23,00:14:24,"And one teaspoon of it, in fact,"
00:14:24,00:14:28,sends you over kumaran safety limits set by the EU.
00:14:28,00:14:29,"Again, very cautious."
00:14:29,00:14:31,I do overload with cinnamon sometimes.
00:14:31,00:14:32,"On the old porridge,"
00:14:32,00:14:34,you're probably breaking EU law
00:14:34,00:14:36,every time you have a nice cinnamon porridge.
00:14:36,00:14:37,- 20 cinnamon buns.
00:14:37,00:14:40,"If they're those really delicious cinnamon-y ones,"
00:14:40,00:14:42,you know where the middle is really cinnamon-y.
00:14:42,00:14:45,"If you have 20 of those, then that's really..."
00:14:45,00:14:46,"- And sometimes after a night out,"
00:14:46,00:14:48,when you go to one of those late night pastry places
00:14:48,00:14:50,"in London, it's not impossible that's happened."
00:14:50,00:14:52,"- Yeah. Oh, yes."
00:14:52,00:14:55,"- Everyone else going to the kebab shop and is like, ""No."""
00:14:55,00:14:56,(laughing)
00:14:56,00:14:58,- The lottery do me.
00:14:58,00:15:00,(upbeat music)
00:15:00,00:15:07,"- Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Anna."
00:15:07,00:15:09,"- My fact this week is that in the 1400s,"
00:15:09,00:15:13,"the king of Korea put a big drum outside his palace,"
00:15:13,00:15:15,and anyone in the kingdom who wanted to complain
00:15:15,00:15:19,about something was encouraged to come and bang it.
00:15:19,00:15:20,I bet they were not encouraged.
00:15:20,00:15:22,"I bet they were strongly deterred,"
00:15:22,00:15:25,except under the direst extremity.
00:15:25,00:15:26,- No way.
00:15:26,00:15:27,"- He said, ""Come one, come all."""
00:15:27,00:15:29,Anything pissing you off?
00:15:29,00:15:30,Your wife nagging you too much?
00:15:30,00:15:31,"Your shoes too tight? - He might say,"
00:15:31,00:15:35,"""Come one, come all,"" because it was the concept of one"
00:15:35,00:15:39,"in Korea, which is if someone causes you a slight,"
00:15:39,00:15:42,or let's say someone steals something off you
00:15:42,00:15:43,"and they're not properly punished,"
00:15:43,00:15:45,"then your level of one,"
00:15:45,00:15:48,your kind of negative emotions are out of balance.
00:15:48,00:15:52,And this person who was sort of starting these new laws
00:15:52,00:15:54,"and trying to keep everyone happy,"
00:15:54,00:15:55,"this was one of the things he was like,"
00:15:55,00:15:59,"if your one is out of level due to someone else,"
00:15:59,00:16:01,then that person will get punished.
00:16:01,00:16:04,- That was a beautiful segue from the word one
00:16:04,00:16:05,to the concept of one.
00:16:05,00:16:07,- Can I tell you one other thing about one?
00:16:07,00:16:08,"- Oh, God. - Very nice."
00:16:08,00:16:10,"- Who was this king, what was he called?"
00:16:10,00:16:11,- King Dae Jong.
00:16:11,00:16:13,- Do you know what his birth name was?
00:16:13,00:16:14,"- It was something different, I can tell you that."
00:16:14,00:16:17,"- His birth name, considering he put a big drum"
00:16:17,00:16:19,"outside his palace, was Lee Bangwon."
00:16:19,00:16:23,- Lovely stuff.
00:16:23,00:16:27,"But he really did, he was king from 1400 to 1418,"
00:16:27,00:16:28,"it was in the Chosun dynasty,"
00:16:28,00:16:30,"which is sort of the massive deal,"
00:16:30,00:16:33,Korean dynasty went on for a thousand years.
00:16:33,00:16:35,And it was called the Sin Mungo Drum.
00:16:35,00:16:38,"And it really was part of a system,"
00:16:38,00:16:39,"and there were three layers of appeal,"
00:16:39,00:16:40,"before you got to the drum,"
00:16:40,00:16:42,"you could go to your county level courts,"
00:16:42,00:16:45,"regional level, national level,"
00:16:45,00:16:47,"if they all reject your,"
00:16:47,00:16:51,"my kettle's broken complaint or whatever it is,"
00:16:51,00:16:52,then you go to the drum.
00:16:52,00:16:54,"- It's like, I wanna talk to your manager,"
00:16:54,00:16:55,"and if you don't get the manager,"
00:16:55,00:16:57,I'm going straight to the drum.
00:16:57,00:16:59,"- Exactly, exactly."
00:16:59,00:17:01,"You bang on the drum, the king deals with it."
00:17:01,00:17:03,"- Yeah, I do imagine that,"
00:17:03,00:17:06,'cause the idea was that anyone could bang the drum.
00:17:06,00:17:08,But I feel like they would have made it quite clear
00:17:08,00:17:10,"that this is a, are you really sure"
00:17:10,00:17:12,you want to bang the drum?
00:17:12,00:17:13,'Cause if you hadn't gone through
00:17:13,00:17:14,"these three layers of lower courts,"
00:17:14,00:17:16,I'm sure you'd probably have been immediately executed
00:17:16,00:17:19,"for even touching the drum, you know?"
00:17:19,00:17:20,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:17:20,00:17:21,- The king is a busy guy.
00:17:21,00:17:22,- He's a busy guy.
00:17:22,00:17:23,"You're clearly an annoying customer,"
00:17:23,00:17:25,if you've made it this far.
00:17:25,00:17:27,- He's a vexatious litigation in action.
00:17:27,00:17:30,"- He was a killer, Taijong."
00:17:30,00:17:31,"Friend of the podcast, by the way."
00:17:31,00:17:32,We have mentioned him before.
00:17:32,00:17:33,"- We've got some questionable friends,"
00:17:33,00:17:34,and we've never denied it.
00:17:34,00:17:35,"- Yeah, we've mentioned him before."
00:17:35,00:17:37,"He was the guy who, so this Joe's son,"
00:17:37,00:17:39,"period dynasty that we're talking about,"
00:17:39,00:17:42,they used to have people writing every single thing down
00:17:42,00:17:46,"about the royalty, and he once fell off a horse,"
00:17:46,00:17:49,"and he didn't want that recorded,"
00:17:49,00:17:51,but what has then been recorded is him falling off the horse
00:17:51,00:17:53,"and saying to the historians,"
00:17:53,00:17:54,"""Don't record this happening."""
00:17:54,00:17:56,"- Yeah, it's the Barbara Streisand effect."
00:17:56,00:17:57,- Yes.
00:17:57,00:17:58,- It's the earliest known example
00:17:58,00:18:00,of Barbara Streisand in the world.
00:18:00,00:18:03,"- Exactly, but no, he did like to kill."
00:18:03,00:18:06,So you would be pretty brave to bang that drum.
00:18:06,00:18:07,- Who did he kill?
00:18:07,00:18:10,- So he executed the four brothers of his wife.
00:18:10,00:18:12,"He executed his father-in-law,"
00:18:12,00:18:13,his younger brother.
00:18:13,00:18:14,- That's a tough Christmas.
00:18:14,00:18:16,(all laughing)
00:18:16,00:18:17,"- Yeah, he was-"
00:18:17,00:18:19,"- But to be fair, he executed people"
00:18:19,00:18:21,who were quite high up the social strata.
00:18:21,00:18:22,- He was a progressive.
00:18:22,00:18:23,Is that what we're saying?
00:18:23,00:18:24,- I think he was progressive.
00:18:24,00:18:25,"Well, in a weird way, he did,"
00:18:25,00:18:28,like he really wanted to kind of democratize stuff in a way.
00:18:28,00:18:29,"That's the whole idea of this drum is like,"
00:18:29,00:18:32,he believes the common people are the ones to be trusted.
00:18:32,00:18:34,"He's like, women and men are exactly the same."
00:18:34,00:18:36,"Enslaved people are exactly the same as the nobles,"
00:18:36,00:18:39,but basically what he wanted to do was crush noble power.
00:18:39,00:18:42,"So yeah, he, I mean, any brother or brother-in-law"
00:18:42,00:18:45,"or step-brother who seemed like might overthrow him,"
00:18:45,00:18:47,"he really upset his dad,"
00:18:47,00:18:50,who sounds like he was quite nice.
00:18:50,00:18:50,- What?
00:18:50,00:18:53,"- Excuse me, I'm gonna throw in one brother-in-law."
00:18:53,00:18:56,"- This was the guy who started the chosen dynasty, right?"
00:18:56,00:18:57,- Yeah.
00:18:57,00:18:58,- By overthrowing the other dynasty.
00:18:58,00:19:00,- You don't start a dynasty without breaking a few eggs.
00:19:00,00:19:03,- Who hasn't overthrown a dynasty?
00:19:03,00:19:06,- Taijong was the king we're talking about with the big drum.
00:19:06,00:19:08,His father was known as Taijo.
00:19:08,00:19:13,And I think he sort of ousted his father from power.
00:19:13,00:19:14,"There was a lot of strife,"
00:19:14,00:19:15,"a lot of people were killed off along the way,"
00:19:15,00:19:17,a lot of rival claimants all bumped off.
00:19:17,00:19:20,"So after Taijong became king,"
00:19:20,00:19:24,"his father, Taijo, was still alive and no longer king."
00:19:24,00:19:26,And Taijong started sending him messengers
00:19:26,00:19:29,to try and heal that breach.
00:19:29,00:19:33,Who his father then had beheaded as an indirect message
00:19:33,00:19:35,that he would never forgive Taijong.
00:19:35,00:19:38,- I think executing the messengers is a really shabby move.
00:19:38,00:19:39,- Yeah.
00:19:39,00:19:40,"- It's not good, but-"
00:19:40,00:19:41,- You can just send the messenger back
00:19:41,00:19:42,"to the thing saying, ""No, I do not forgive you."""
00:19:42,00:19:44,"- Also, I think when you do that,"
00:19:44,00:19:46,you're supposed to like cut the hand off the messengers
00:19:46,00:19:48,"so that he can go back and say, ""Look what happened to me."""
00:19:48,00:19:50,"If you cut the head off,"
00:19:50,00:19:52,you just stuck with the body of a messenger.
00:19:52,00:19:52,- Exactly.
00:19:52,00:19:54,- You just think my messengers must have got lost.
00:19:54,00:19:55,"- Yeah, right, I'll send someone."
00:19:55,00:19:57,Hence he kept sending messengers.
00:19:57,00:19:58,What a horrible system.
00:19:58,00:19:59,- Yeah.
00:19:59,00:20:01,- I guess what I saw as this touching angle
00:20:01,00:20:02,is why he was angry though.
00:20:02,00:20:04,- Why was he angry then?
00:20:04,00:20:06,"- He was angry because,"
00:20:06,00:20:08,so Taijong had been king and then he'd abdicated.
00:20:08,00:20:10,"People constantly abdicating, not dying."
00:20:10,00:20:13,"And then he made another one of his sons king,"
00:20:13,00:20:14,"who Taijong overthrew,"
00:20:14,00:20:17,"and then Taijong killed a bunch of his brothers,"
00:20:17,00:20:18,"as we've said,"
00:20:18,00:20:20,and his dad was just really upset with him
00:20:20,00:20:21,for killing his other kids.
00:20:21,00:20:22,"So his dad was like,"
00:20:22,00:20:25,"""I'm so pissed off that you killed my kids."""
00:20:25,00:20:25,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:20:25,00:20:28,- And I think that's a few messengers' heads
00:20:28,00:20:32,that were gonna roll to punish your son.
00:20:32,00:20:34,- We've ascertained we're in terms of aristocracy
00:20:34,00:20:38,"versus messenger court, Anna's loyalties lie with, okay?"
00:20:38,00:20:40,- I like the way that all these things
00:20:40,00:20:42,"where people's heads are rolling left, right, and center"
00:20:42,00:20:45,are known as the first and second strife of princes.
00:20:45,00:20:48,- Yeah.
00:20:48,00:20:49,- It feels like they're underplaying it a bit.
00:20:49,00:20:51,"- Yeah, we've got a euphemism, such things."
00:20:51,00:20:54,"- I don't like any of the people involved, I should say."
00:20:54,00:20:54,"- Yeah, they're all quite bad, aren't they?"
00:20:54,00:20:56,"- He was smart, Taijong."
00:20:56,00:21:00,He was the only king in the history of Korea
00:21:00,00:21:02,who passed the civil service exam.
00:21:02,00:21:03,- Really?
00:21:03,00:21:04,"- Remember, we've said in the past,"
00:21:04,00:21:06,"they have these really, really tough civil service exams"
00:21:06,00:21:08,to see who gets the jobs?
00:21:08,00:21:11,"Well, he passed it and none of his brothers passed it,"
00:21:11,00:21:13,but they also got into the civil service
00:21:13,00:21:16,"due to the system that if your parents are really rich,"
00:21:16,00:21:19,"you get it anyway, which they had at the time."
00:21:19,00:21:21,"But yeah, he got through this"
00:21:21,00:21:23,and he decided he wanted to be a tattooist.
00:21:23,00:21:24,- Really?
00:21:24,00:21:26,"- Yeah, 'cause it was a big deal job in the time."
00:21:26,00:21:28,"If there was a criminal and they did something wrong,"
00:21:28,00:21:31,you would tattoo the criminal with whatever they'd done wrong
00:21:31,00:21:32,so that people would know.
00:21:32,00:21:33,And it was a really important job
00:21:33,00:21:35,"and that's what he wanted to be,"
00:21:35,00:21:36,but then in the end he became king.
00:21:36,00:21:40,"- Was there, 'cause some tattoos are quite subtle"
00:21:40,00:21:41,and you can hide them.
00:21:41,00:21:42,"I presume if you're the criminal,"
00:21:42,00:21:43,"you can't say, can you do it really small"
00:21:43,00:21:44,and on my inner thigh?
00:21:44,00:21:48,Presumably it has to be like back of the hand or something.
00:21:48,00:21:50,Like I'm a purse snatcher or whatever.
00:21:50,00:21:53,"- I think it was in specific, they had rules."
00:21:53,00:21:55,"- Could you get extra tattoos after that one to kind of,"
00:21:55,00:21:56,"you know how people these days,"
00:21:56,00:21:58,"if they've got like an embarrassing tattoo,"
00:21:58,00:21:59,they'll try and add to it too.
00:21:59,00:22:01,"- Yeah, like what was it?"
00:22:01,00:22:02,"Oh, it's slightly the other way,"
00:22:02,00:22:04,but Johnny Depp had Winona forever
00:22:04,00:22:06,"and then got rid of it and it said, why no forever?"
00:22:06,00:22:07,"- Oh, yes. - Exactly."
00:22:07,00:22:09,Could you add extra things?
00:22:09,00:22:11,I can't think of how you'd adapt the phrase purse snatcher
00:22:11,00:22:13,"to be benign, but mm."
00:22:13,00:22:14,- I am not a.
00:22:14,00:22:16,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:22:16,00:22:19,"- No, there were very strict rules about tattooing in general."
00:22:19,00:22:21,- But so this is the king who wanted to be the tattooist.
00:22:21,00:22:22,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:22:22,00:22:22,"Well, he wasn't the king of the time."
00:22:22,00:22:24,He was just like a prince.
00:22:24,00:22:25,- Okay.
00:22:25,00:22:27,I got a little detail about his death
00:22:27,00:22:31,"the day he died, Taijong, which is that,"
00:22:31,00:22:33,"so he abdicated, right?"
00:22:33,00:22:34,"Four years later, he dies."
00:22:34,00:22:37,And there's a thing which is drought
00:22:37,00:22:40,is often connected to your relationship with the gods.
00:22:40,00:22:42,"And in the 1400s, it was believed"
00:22:42,00:22:44,that royalty were connected to it.
00:22:44,00:22:45,So sometimes the king would go to an area
00:22:45,00:22:47,"and if it rained, that would be seen"
00:22:47,00:22:49,as a miracle brought on by the king.
00:22:49,00:22:51,"So when he was in his dying day, the king himself,"
00:22:51,00:22:54,"he said, I'm gonna make it rain."
00:22:54,00:22:57,"And on the day he died, it torrential rained"
00:22:57,00:22:59,"and for so long, it was like 10 days"
00:22:59,00:23:01,to the point where it actually destroyed crops
00:23:01,00:23:02,because it was so much.
00:23:02,00:23:04,"But this has been a legend, but people have gone back"
00:23:04,00:23:05,and they found through all the records
00:23:05,00:23:08,that it did rain on the day that he died.
00:23:08,00:23:10,So it's seen as a miracle day.
00:23:10,00:23:12,- Is it a miracle if it rains?
00:23:12,00:23:14,"I mean, I know Korea's not as bad as Britain."
00:23:14,00:23:17,"And yeah, yeah, I can see that they really wanted it."
00:23:17,00:23:20,- I think that's often what happens in those circumstances
00:23:20,00:23:21,is it's been a drought for so long
00:23:21,00:23:23,and so the ground gets really hard.
00:23:23,00:23:25,And then you get a big rain storm
00:23:25,00:23:28,"like you would naturally get after a lot of hot weather,"
00:23:28,00:23:29,but there's nowhere for the water to go.
00:23:29,00:23:30,So it all kind of--
00:23:30,00:23:31,"- Yeah, bloody floods."
00:23:31,00:23:33,"And then God goes, well, what the hell did you want?"
00:23:33,00:23:35,Everyone gets really upset about that.
00:23:35,00:23:36,What do you want from me?
00:23:36,00:23:38,"Yeah, he abdicated because I think he wanted"
00:23:38,00:23:42,"to train up his son basically, who was Sejong."
00:23:42,00:23:46,And he basically is known as Korea's greatest ever leader
00:23:46,00:23:48,for lots and lots of reasons.
00:23:48,00:23:50,But partly 'cause I don't think he's the only king ever
00:23:50,00:23:53,to have invented a completely new alphabet from scratch.
00:23:53,00:23:56,And it's still the alphabet that they use today.
00:23:56,00:23:58,- I think what a pain in the ass
00:23:58,00:24:00,to invent an entirely new alphabet.
00:24:00,00:24:01,"Because if you're the king,"
00:24:01,00:24:03,everyone has to go along with your alphabet as well.
00:24:03,00:24:05,There's no way you can soft launch an alphabet
00:24:05,00:24:07,"and say, well, we'll see if it takes off"
00:24:07,00:24:10,and see if anyone starts using this new alphabet.
00:24:10,00:24:12,Do we know why he invented a new alphabet?
00:24:12,00:24:14,"- Well, I think they were using the Chinese alphabet"
00:24:14,00:24:17,which didn't match Korean noises at the time.
00:24:17,00:24:18,"And so they were like, we need one that fits."
00:24:18,00:24:20,And he was very smart.
00:24:20,00:24:21,He was an academic.
00:24:21,00:24:23,So actually his alphabet was so good
00:24:23,00:24:25,that they've kept on using it.
00:24:25,00:24:25,"- Well, that's very impressive."
00:24:25,00:24:26,I didn't know that.
00:24:26,00:24:29,I love the idea of workshopping an alphabet though.
00:24:29,00:24:30,"Like just get some guys in, have some beers,"
00:24:30,00:24:32,just see where it takes us.
00:24:32,00:24:34,- Make some of the noises you make every day.
00:24:34,00:24:37,"- Yeah, that one, I'm gonna draw a symbol for that one."
00:24:37,00:24:38,"- To reckon with the Beers thing,"
00:24:38,00:24:40,that's why the end of the alphabet is so fucked up
00:24:40,00:24:42,"with X, Y's and Z's."
00:24:42,00:24:44,"Yes, everyone's just pissed by that place."
00:24:44,00:24:45,- It's a late night.
00:24:45,00:24:46,"- Let's go for an X, what?"
00:24:46,00:24:49,- Is that why he's sleeping in Z's?
00:24:49,00:24:50,- That's right.
00:24:50,00:24:53,- Have you never gone to the end of the alphabet?
00:24:53,00:24:55,"It goes, W, X, Y, Z, vomit."
00:24:55,00:24:57,(all laughing)
00:24:57,00:24:59,(upbeat music)
00:24:59,00:25:04,"- Okay, time for fact number three."
00:25:04,00:25:05,And that is my fact.
00:25:05,00:25:08,My fact this week is that the artist George Brack
00:25:08,00:25:11,once spent 10 days trying to get rid of a squirrel
00:25:11,00:25:13,that kept reappearing in his painting.
00:25:13,00:25:17,- This guy sounds like an idiot.
00:25:17,00:25:19,"Once you just keep drawing the squirrel,"
00:25:19,00:25:20,"rubbing it out, drawing the squirrel."
00:25:20,00:25:22,"- Yes, and it's a job, James."
00:25:22,00:25:23,You can be an idiot and make money.
00:25:23,00:25:27,So this obviously very famous artist.
00:25:27,00:25:28,I read this in a book.
00:25:28,00:25:30,We recently did a show with John Lloyd
00:25:30,00:25:32,and we talked about Picasso in it.
00:25:32,00:25:35,"And off the back of it, I went on holiday"
00:25:35,00:25:38,"and I took Francois Gileau's autobiography,"
00:25:38,00:25:40,which is her life in Picasso.
00:25:40,00:25:43,She talks about the fact that Brack and Picasso
00:25:43,00:25:46,"had this moment where in their cubism period,"
00:25:46,00:25:47,they were both staring at a painting
00:25:47,00:25:48,that Brack was painting.
00:25:48,00:25:51,"And he just said, Picasso just said to him,"
00:25:51,00:25:53,"""What's that squirrel doing there?"""
00:25:53,00:25:56,"And he said, ""Oh my God, what is that squirrel doing there?"""
00:25:56,00:25:58,"Now obviously there was no squirrel there,"
00:25:58,00:25:59,but they could see the squirrel.
00:25:59,00:26:02,"- 'Cause was it like, what would you call it?"
00:26:02,00:26:03,Like-- - Impressionistic?
00:26:03,00:26:05,"- Yeah, like an impressionistic painting"
00:26:05,00:26:08,where it wasn't a picture of a bowl of fruit
00:26:08,00:26:09,"and there's a squirrel in there, right?"
00:26:09,00:26:12,"- Well, no, exactly, but he was painting"
00:26:12,00:26:14,a package of tobacco and a pipe.
00:26:14,00:26:15,"- Oh, so it was still life."
00:26:15,00:26:16,"- Yeah, it was still life."
00:26:16,00:26:17,"- But it was just like in the corner,"
00:26:17,00:26:19,"it was like the shadows made it look like that, right?"
00:26:19,00:26:21,"- Yeah, exactly, and they could see the squirrel."
00:26:21,00:26:23,"So he paints it away,"
00:26:23,00:26:25,but as he's constantly transforming the painting
00:26:25,00:26:26,"over the next eight to 10 days,"
00:26:26,00:26:29,the squirrel keeps popping up in a new different place.
00:26:29,00:26:30,The squirrel returns.
00:26:30,00:26:32,And so he spends close to 10 days
00:26:32,00:26:35,"until he invites Picasso back and Picasso and him both agree,"
00:26:35,00:26:36,"yes, the squirrel is now gone"
00:26:36,00:26:39,and now they know that the painting is as it should be.
00:26:39,00:26:41,- Do you think there's a chance
00:26:41,00:26:42,Picasso never saw the squirrel
00:26:42,00:26:45,"and just thought, I'm gonna psych out my mate here."
00:26:45,00:26:46,This is gonna really pit him off.
00:26:46,00:26:48,- Slow him down.
00:26:48,00:26:49,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:26:49,00:26:50,- Let's get ahead.
00:26:50,00:26:50,- Let's deal with the competition.
00:26:50,00:26:52,I had never heard of Brack before this.
00:26:52,00:26:53,- Okay.
00:26:53,00:26:54,"- Is he really, is he made for this?"
00:26:54,00:26:55,"- Well, they've found us"
00:26:55,00:26:56,of Cubism where it's Picasso and Brack.
00:26:56,00:26:57,"- Oh, okay."
00:26:57,00:26:58,"- He's biggy, yeah, okay."
00:26:58,00:26:59,"- In that world, yeah."
00:26:59,00:27:00,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:27:00,00:27:01,- He's bigger in the art world than in the cricket world.
00:27:01,00:27:03,(laughing)
00:27:03,00:27:05,"- Is it, and this is Cubism that was,"
00:27:05,00:27:07,"sorry, not impressionism, Cubism."
00:27:07,00:27:09,So lots of different shapes.
00:27:09,00:27:10,"- Yeah, Cubes."
00:27:10,00:27:11,"- Yeah, Cubes."
00:27:11,00:27:11,"- It's mostly, yeah."
00:27:11,00:27:13,- And what are we all except a selection of Cubes
00:27:13,00:27:14,arranged in a pile?
00:27:14,00:27:17,"- Think of a Picasso painting, like a really wonky one."
00:27:17,00:27:18,- Yeah.
00:27:18,00:27:19,- You're kind of on the Cubism vibe there.
00:27:19,00:27:22,- Is this a perennial hazard for Cubist painters?
00:27:22,00:27:23,"Like, what people constantly saying,"
00:27:23,00:27:24,"""I love that castle you've done."""
00:27:24,00:27:26,"You can say, ""Yes, thank you very much."""
00:27:26,00:27:27,- No.
00:27:27,00:27:28,"- ""Spent ages on the castle."""
00:27:28,00:27:29,They're sweated over that.
00:27:29,00:27:31,"- No, and this was, this is actually a really good point."
00:27:31,00:27:32,"This is the main point about it,"
00:27:32,00:27:34,is that Picasso was saying
00:27:34,00:27:35,you were painting something to be seen.
00:27:35,00:27:38,You were not painting an illusion.
00:27:38,00:27:39,"So if we're seeing a squirrel in your painting,"
00:27:39,00:27:40,you've painted an illusion.
00:27:40,00:27:43,You've allowed for it to be interpreted in this way.
00:27:43,00:27:46,"- And this is all a form of something called ""Paradolia,"""
00:27:46,00:27:49,which is where you see faces or images
00:27:49,00:27:51,in something that don't really exist.
00:27:51,00:27:54,When you look in the sky and you see a cloud
00:27:54,00:27:58,"and you think, ""Oh, that looks like Mother Teresa or something,"""
00:27:58,00:28:01,then that is because you're seeing things
00:28:01,00:28:02,that aren't really there.
00:28:02,00:28:05,"- Well, why does she bless me then?"
00:28:05,00:28:07,Why does she reach down and the cloud touches my nose
00:28:07,00:28:08,and I feel electricity?
00:28:08,00:28:09,What's going on there?
00:28:09,00:28:13,"- Well, it is, ""Paradolia"" can be associated"
00:28:13,00:28:14,with schizophrenia.
00:28:14,00:28:17,It can be associated with extreme creativity.
00:28:17,00:28:19,"- Well, that's, can't be why I've got it."
00:28:19,00:28:20,(all laughing)
00:28:20,00:28:23,"But is it, I read that it was also neurosis"
00:28:23,00:28:27,and even conspiracy theorists are more likely
00:28:27,00:28:29,because they're forming patterns everywhere.
00:28:29,00:28:31,"They're thinking, ""That's an interesting coincidence."
00:28:31,00:28:32,"That's interesting. That's interesting."""
00:28:32,00:28:33,"Maybe think of you, Dan."
00:28:33,00:28:35,"You know, you're a very good at coincidence generation."
00:28:35,00:28:36,"- Yeah, well, okay."
00:28:36,00:28:38,"- So the usually faces more than the rest of us, maybe."
00:28:38,00:28:40,"- I don't think so because I'm not a conspiracy theorist,"
00:28:40,00:28:45,"but the face on Mars is the most famous one,"
00:28:45,00:28:46,I would say in the conspiracy world.
00:28:46,00:28:50,There was a photo that was taken by the Viking space probe
00:28:50,00:28:53,and you can see what looks like a giant face
00:28:53,00:28:54,on the surface of Mars.
00:28:54,00:28:56,That was found decades ago
00:28:56,00:28:58,and that has built a whole industry of ideas
00:28:58,00:29:00,that ancient aliens landed there
00:29:00,00:29:01,and built stuff and so on.
00:29:01,00:29:04,- And what proof is it of life?
00:29:04,00:29:06,Is it like someone died and they were a giant
00:29:06,00:29:08,and then they turned into a rock?
00:29:08,00:29:09,Just their face.
00:29:09,00:29:12,"- Because actually, if you look at civilization today,"
00:29:12,00:29:14,there aren't loads of faces.
00:29:14,00:29:17,It's loads of buildings.
00:29:17,00:29:19,- And tools and some bones.
00:29:19,00:29:22,It's so rare you just see a human face left over
00:29:22,00:29:23,"from 4,000 years ago."
00:29:23,00:29:26,"- As a representative of the conspiracy theorists,"
00:29:26,00:29:27,I'd like to say there are people that believe it.
00:29:27,00:29:28,"Next time you're at my house,"
00:29:28,00:29:30,"I've got about six books I can lend you,"
00:29:30,00:29:33,which very much put forward that idea.
00:29:33,00:29:35,"No, it's who knows."
00:29:35,00:29:36,They just thought it looked man-made
00:29:36,00:29:38,"is rather what it is, is the main thing."
00:29:38,00:29:41,"- Nazca lines, the shapes were viewed from above"
00:29:41,00:29:42,and they say an abyss giant.
00:29:42,00:29:45,He's a big face on the ground and a whole lot else besides.
00:29:45,00:29:46,- Good point.
00:29:46,00:29:48,So people with faces also make faces.
00:29:48,00:29:49,- Yeah.
00:29:49,00:29:50,Do you know what?
00:29:50,00:29:51,"Just on that word, pareidolia,"
00:29:51,00:29:53,"this idea of seeing faces and things,"
00:29:53,00:29:58,Picasso had a theory that that is how art began to begin with.
00:29:58,00:30:00,He thinks that early man was looking around
00:30:00,00:30:02,"and seeing faces in rocks and seeing,"
00:30:02,00:30:04,"and thinking, oh, why don't I"
00:30:04,00:30:06,trace over that or why don't I try and mimic that?
00:30:06,00:30:08,"- Well, there's evidence of that."
00:30:08,00:30:09,This is really cool.
00:30:09,00:30:13,So it's believed that maybe Neanderthals
00:30:13,00:30:17,also experienced pareidolia and early man.
00:30:17,00:30:21,"There was a stone found, a pebble,"
00:30:21,00:30:23,and it has a human fingerprint on it
00:30:23,00:30:27,and one red dot of ochre.
00:30:27,00:30:29,And that helps it look a little bit like a face.
00:30:29,00:30:31,It helps to make a little bit of a nose
00:30:31,00:30:33,in between a bit of pebble that looks like eyes
00:30:33,00:30:35,and a little bit that could look like a mouth.
00:30:35,00:30:37,"And I read a study about it,"
00:30:37,00:30:40,"which was titled ""More than a Fingerprint on a Pebble"","
00:30:40,00:30:42,which is defensive to so- - Just a real question mark
00:30:42,00:30:43,on that.
00:30:43,00:30:46,"- It was, no, it was ""More than a Fingerprint on a Pebble""."
00:30:46,00:30:47,Surely.
00:30:47,00:30:49,- That's better 'cause you made it sound quite desperate.
00:30:49,00:30:53,"- Well, it dates back 43,000 years."
00:30:53,00:30:57,"And they think it is evidence that early humans were saying,"
00:30:57,00:30:58,"oh, that looks a bit like a face."
00:30:58,00:31:01,I'll add a bit of art and a little one dot
00:31:01,00:31:02,and that'll make it look even more like a face.
00:31:02,00:31:06,So this is a long historical tendency we all have.
00:31:06,00:31:07,- Would make sense.
00:31:07,00:31:11,"Seeing Jesus' face, that's a very common one to appear."
00:31:11,00:31:12,We all know what that looks like.
00:31:12,00:31:16,First time it appeared is in a 1977 flower tortilla.
00:31:16,00:31:18,So it was a woman called Maria Rubio
00:31:18,00:31:21,and she was making burritos for her husband in New Mexico
00:31:21,00:31:24,and she saw Jesus' face.
00:31:24,00:31:27,And it really is the famous face of Jesus in a tortilla.
00:31:27,00:31:28,She snipped out his face.
00:31:28,00:31:29,She took it to a priest at the local church.
00:31:29,00:31:31,"She said, ""What the hell's going on here?"""
00:31:31,00:31:33,"And the priest was like, ""Well, you've been visited by Jesus."""
00:31:33,00:31:36,And it actually sort of ruined their lives.
00:31:36,00:31:39,So thousands and thousands of people visited
00:31:39,00:31:41,from all across like Central and South America
00:31:41,00:31:42,and North America came to the house.
00:31:42,00:31:45,They displayed it in this glass case.
00:31:45,00:31:47,But people expected her to do amazing things.
00:31:47,00:31:48,They thought she could heal
00:31:48,00:31:50,and they thought she had these incredible powers.
00:31:50,00:31:52,So they'd come and they'd bring their sick children
00:31:52,00:31:54,"and say, ""Heal me."""
00:31:54,00:31:56,"And she, you know, she agonized over it."
00:31:56,00:31:58,She didn't want a profit out of the tortilla
00:31:58,00:32:00,"and she wanted to help people,"
00:32:00,00:32:01,but she couldn't heal them.
00:32:01,00:32:04,"And she just said in the end it was a complete nightmare,"
00:32:04,00:32:07,but she was too religious to destroy it
00:32:07,00:32:08,'cause you can't destroy the face of Jesus
00:32:08,00:32:10,once it's entered your home.
00:32:10,00:32:12,"- Right, but once you smear guacamole on it,"
00:32:12,00:32:15,you're not going to be able to see it anyway.
00:32:15,00:32:18,- It's what he would have wanted.
00:32:18,00:32:19,- What did she do with it?
00:32:19,00:32:22,- She kept it for years and years
00:32:22,00:32:24,and it broke of its own accord in 2005.
00:32:24,00:32:27,- With its own accord.
00:32:27,00:32:30,"That's a miracle, like a tortilla that magically fractures."
00:32:30,00:32:31,- It'd be like a Jesus jigsaw.
00:32:31,00:32:32,"Oh yeah, nice."
00:32:32,00:32:34,Maybe that's how the grandkids use it today.
00:32:34,00:32:37,- There might be a reason why Jesus is seen so much.
00:32:37,00:32:39,"Although I know you get,"
00:32:39,00:32:41,there's a famous Virgin Mary tortilla.
00:32:41,00:32:45,"A lot of Mexican foods that the trinity are appearing on,"
00:32:45,00:32:45,which is interesting.
00:32:45,00:32:47,"- Yes, maybe it lends itself to faces"
00:32:47,00:32:48,'cause it's got those little bubbles in it
00:32:48,00:32:49,"that look like eyes and a nose, doesn't it?"
00:32:49,00:32:52,- We once saw the devil in a chicken pacora.
00:32:52,00:32:54,- Okay.
00:32:54,00:32:55,- Lucky you.
00:32:55,00:32:56,- Back up a second.
00:32:56,00:32:59,- It's like it's not always Mexican food.
00:32:59,00:33:00,"- No, you're right."
00:33:00,00:33:02,"- Well, that's really food for thought."
00:33:02,00:33:03,- Yeah.
00:33:03,00:33:05,- What are you still doing on this podcast?
00:33:05,00:33:07,Shouldn't you be touring the world with your millions?
00:33:07,00:33:12,"- Anywhere we called our pacora, Derek pacora."
00:33:12,00:33:13,"- Oh, very nice."
00:33:13,00:33:14,- What did you do with him?
00:33:14,00:33:15,Is he in a glass cabinet somewhere?
00:33:15,00:33:17,- I eventually went in the bin.
00:33:17,00:33:18,We didn't eat him.
00:33:18,00:33:19,- Wow.
00:33:19,00:33:20,- Didn't you?
00:33:20,00:33:21,- No.
00:33:21,00:33:21,- Too scared.
00:33:21,00:33:23,"- The devil's pacora, no way."
00:33:23,00:33:24,Was it a spicy pacora?
00:33:24,00:33:25,"- I don't know, I didn't eat it."
00:33:25,00:33:26,- No.
00:33:26,00:33:28,(laughing)
00:33:30,00:33:33,- So the reason that Jesus might appear more
00:33:33,00:33:35,is a thing to do with pareidolia in general.
00:33:35,00:33:38,And that is that people think when they see a face
00:33:38,00:33:40,"in anything that is male,"
00:33:40,00:33:43,"80% of the faces that people perceive,"
00:33:43,00:33:45,"whether, you know, it's just a collection of lines"
00:33:45,00:33:47,"or whatever, 80% are male."
00:33:47,00:33:49,- Is that patriarchy stuff?
00:33:49,00:33:50,- I think it probably is.
00:33:50,00:33:53,"Unless they clearly have, you know, long hair,"
00:33:53,00:33:56,"lustrous eyelashes, a big science saying I am female"
00:33:56,00:33:58,"or whatever it is, people just think that's a bloke."
00:33:58,00:34:00,"- Is it that, 'cause the two biggies really"
00:34:00,00:34:02,"are the Virgin Mary and Jesus, right?"
00:34:02,00:34:04,But do you mean that there'll be a lot of men's names
00:34:04,00:34:06,in the mix and just the Virgin Mary?
00:34:06,00:34:09,"- No, I guess we just see random faces most of the time, right?"
00:34:09,00:34:11,"We don't see usually Mary or Jesus,"
00:34:11,00:34:12,"we just go, ""Ah, looks like a face."""
00:34:12,00:34:13,"- Yeah, I see."
00:34:13,00:34:15,- I think it's like if you were to draw a circle
00:34:15,00:34:17,with two dots where eyes might be
00:34:17,00:34:19,"and a dot where the nose is in a line where the mouth is,"
00:34:19,00:34:21,"a lot of people just say, ""Oh, look at that man."""
00:34:21,00:34:22,- Yes.
00:34:22,00:34:23,- That kind of thing.
00:34:23,00:34:24,"- Yeah, that's it."
00:34:24,00:34:24,"I'm afraid I think it probably,"
00:34:24,00:34:27,there isn't a better explanation than patriarchy.
00:34:27,00:34:29,"- There never is, Andy. - Wow."
00:34:29,00:34:31,- Or a worse explanation.
00:34:31,00:34:33,"- Even in shapes. - Wow, a lot of ways."
00:34:33,00:34:35,- Auditory Paradolia.
00:34:35,00:34:37,"If you're walking through the woods,"
00:34:37,00:34:41,there might be some wind rustling through the leaves.
00:34:41,00:34:43,There might be a water going by
00:34:43,00:34:45,and people often hear the names.
00:34:45,00:34:49,"Ah, it does happen quite a lot, it seems, it turns out."
00:34:49,00:34:51,"And it can happen with electric fans,"
00:34:51,00:34:54,"with airplane engines, with washing machines."
00:34:54,00:34:55,"Anywhere where there's kind of white noise,"
00:34:55,00:34:58,sort of uncertain what the noise is.
00:34:58,00:35:01,The reason is that your brain kind of just fills
00:35:01,00:35:05,"in the gaps and so if this white noise,"
00:35:05,00:35:08,this washing machine is making lots of weird noises
00:35:08,00:35:13,"and a couple of those noises sound a bit like an a and a n,"
00:35:13,00:35:16,"then you would think, oh, someone said Anna."
00:35:16,00:35:18,But even though it's just like a few frequencies
00:35:18,00:35:20,that sound a little bit like those letters.
00:35:20,00:35:22,"- It's not just people who are called things like,"
00:35:22,00:35:26,"""Pshh."" (all laughing)"
00:35:26,00:35:28,"- The name takes an hour to pronounce,"
00:35:28,00:35:30,but only half an hour if you put them on a quick cycle.
00:35:30,00:35:31,(all laughing)
00:35:31,00:35:35,"I really like the thing of why this happens in general,"
00:35:35,00:35:37,"like the evolutionary theory as to why it happens,"
00:35:37,00:35:40,which is that it is useful to us evolutionarily
00:35:40,00:35:45,to perceive a pattern where there may or may not be one.
00:35:45,00:35:46,"So that particularly applies to, let's say,"
00:35:46,00:35:50,"if you're in an environment with predators,"
00:35:50,00:35:52,it is more useful to see a bear
00:35:52,00:35:55,that is not there than not to see a bear that is there.
00:35:55,00:35:57,"And there's a terrific book, actually,"
00:35:57,00:35:58,"called ""The Tiger That Isn't,"""
00:35:58,00:35:59,"which is mostly a book about stats,"
00:35:59,00:36:01,but it's really good about finding signals
00:36:01,00:36:02,and patterns and all that.
00:36:02,00:36:04,It's a great book about maths.
00:36:04,00:36:06,"But yeah, that seems to be the reason why it happens"
00:36:06,00:36:08,and maybe that it's useful to see faces
00:36:08,00:36:10,because you might be--
00:36:10,00:36:12,"- Yeah, just keep us prepared."
00:36:12,00:36:12,- And just you're lonely
00:36:12,00:36:14,and you want to hang out with someone.
00:36:14,00:36:15,- We're social creatures.
00:36:15,00:36:17,The only reason we've been successful as a species
00:36:17,00:36:19,is that we're team players and like anyone else.
00:36:19,00:36:20,What does that require?
00:36:20,00:36:21,It requires us to spot faces.
00:36:21,00:36:23,- Does it matter that nine out of 10 faces we spot
00:36:23,00:36:25,are actually dots on a PCOR or?
00:36:25,00:36:27,(laughing)
00:36:27,00:36:28,- You've got so many friends
00:36:28,00:36:30,until it's pointed out to you that actually--
00:36:30,00:36:32,(laughing)
00:36:32,00:36:33,- Eating alone in the Indian restaurant
00:36:33,00:36:35,at a 10-person table again.
00:36:35,00:36:37,(laughing)
00:36:37,00:36:41,"- And then like to go right to the modern day,"
00:36:41,00:36:42,if you are sitting there
00:36:42,00:36:44,and you think your phone is vibrating in your pocket
00:36:44,00:36:46,"and it isn't vibrating in your pocket,"
00:36:46,00:36:48,that's another kind of paradox.
00:36:48,00:36:49,- I've got that.
00:36:49,00:36:50,- And that's because you've got it right now.
00:36:50,00:36:52,"- Not right now, but I have it almost daily."
00:36:52,00:36:53,"- Oh, it's extremely common."
00:36:53,00:36:55,"- I've been calling you for weeks, Dan."
00:36:55,00:36:57,(laughing)
00:36:57,00:36:59,- I thought I'd been chatting to you.
00:36:59,00:37:02,Was that the wall with a dot on it?
00:37:02,00:37:04,(laughing)
00:37:04,00:37:07,"- And again, it's just the brain sort of like"
00:37:07,00:37:09,feels some kind of vibration
00:37:09,00:37:11,and remembers all the other times it have vibrated there
00:37:11,00:37:12,and then just fills in the gaps.
00:37:12,00:37:14,- I get that a fair bit.
00:37:14,00:37:16,"But Dan, do you think it's anyone in particular ringing?"
00:37:16,00:37:17,"As we know now it is Anna,"
00:37:17,00:37:20,"but do you think, do you think, oh my agent?"
00:37:20,00:37:22,"You know, like, if there's someone you hope is."
00:37:22,00:37:23,"- No, no, I don't."
00:37:23,00:37:24,"- Hello, don't try the speaking."
00:37:24,00:37:25,"I'm free, I'm ready."
00:37:25,00:37:27,(laughing)
00:37:27,00:37:29,"Half my usual rate, I'll do it."
00:37:29,00:37:30,- Idiot fire.
00:37:30,00:37:32,(laughing)
00:37:32,00:37:33,- Rodeo clowns are us.
00:37:33,00:37:35,(laughing)
00:37:35,00:37:37,(upbeat music)
00:37:37,00:37:43,"- Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show"
00:37:43,00:37:44,and that is Andy.
00:37:44,00:37:45,"- My fact is, across the world,"
00:37:45,00:37:48,there are over a hundred serious collectors
00:37:48,00:37:51,of airline sick bags.
00:37:51,00:37:52,Serious.
00:37:52,00:37:53,- How serious?
00:37:53,00:37:54,- I'm not talking amateur hour.
00:37:54,00:37:56,"Oh, I have a draw, but I don't do it much."
00:37:56,00:37:58,"You know, these are players."
00:37:58,00:37:59,- Yeah? - Yeah.
00:37:59,00:38:01,"- These are traders, they are curators."
00:38:01,00:38:02,- Absolutely. - Yeah.
00:38:02,00:38:05,- There is a community and it's thriving.
00:38:05,00:38:05,It's hopping.
00:38:05,00:38:08,- How many qualifies as serious then for you?
00:38:08,00:38:11,"- Well, I wouldn't talk to anyone"
00:38:11,00:38:13,"who had less than a hundred and fifty, five."
00:38:13,00:38:16,- I think that's fair.
00:38:16,00:38:17,How many do you have?
00:38:17,00:38:20,"- I don't have any, I'm just a reporter in this world."
00:38:20,00:38:22,"But so, I mean, the figures vary."
00:38:22,00:38:23,"One article I read said a hundred collectors,"
00:38:23,00:38:25,another said 250.
00:38:25,00:38:28,"They could fit into a medium-sized theater, definitely."
00:38:28,00:38:32,And there are some record holders.
00:38:32,00:38:34,"There's a guy called Nick Vermeerlund,"
00:38:34,00:38:37,"who I believe has most,"
00:38:37,00:38:41,"certainly in the mid 6,290 as per a CNN article."
00:38:41,00:38:44,"Yeah, as of 2012, he may have collected more since,"
00:38:44,00:38:46,his wife may have persuaded him to throw them out since.
00:38:46,00:38:49,"We don't know, but he had that many then."
00:38:49,00:38:52,"Yeah, so he's got maybe most that have ever been had."
00:38:52,00:38:53,- That's pretty cool. - It's not.
00:38:53,00:38:55,- Why do they do it?
00:38:55,00:38:58,"- Oh, you know, you've got to pass the time, haven't you?"
00:38:58,00:39:00,"- I read one person called Steve Sildberg,"
00:39:00,00:39:03,who told CNN that he'd collected them
00:39:03,00:39:04,because nobody else collects them.
00:39:04,00:39:08,He'll be gutted to hear this episode of Fish Money.
00:39:08,00:39:09,- He's great.
00:39:09,00:39:12,"- So he has 3,000 more than,"
00:39:12,00:39:15,"and he runs airsicknessbags.com,"
00:39:15,00:39:17,which is a really good website for those
00:39:17,00:39:18,wanting to get into it.
00:39:18,00:39:19,- It's amazing what it throws up.
00:39:19,00:39:20,"- Oh, God."
00:39:20,00:39:24,"- He writes, while this website and hobby"
00:39:24,00:39:25,"is an enormous waste of time,"
00:39:25,00:39:27,I like to think it's a high-quality waste of time
00:39:27,00:39:29,than many other places on the web.
00:39:29,00:39:30,And he's just really good.
00:39:30,00:39:32,- Look at some of his examples on his website.
00:39:32,00:39:33,- Go on.
00:39:33,00:39:36,"- The Duke makes us puke from 1988,"
00:39:36,00:39:38,"which was given out at the Republican National Convention,"
00:39:38,00:39:40,referring to Mike Dukakis.
00:39:40,00:39:41,- That's good.
00:39:41,00:39:45,"- There was the Hen Knight Party Bag from 2005,"
00:39:45,00:39:47,which is a British sick bag.
00:39:47,00:39:49,And each bag displays a vomit stain
00:39:49,00:39:52,and exhorts you to place gob here and heave.
00:39:52,00:39:54,And it comes with the caveats.
00:39:54,00:39:56,"Please dispose of properly, do not reheat,"
00:39:56,00:39:58,not suitable for home freezing.
00:39:58,00:39:59,- Jesus.
00:39:59,00:40:00,(laughing)
00:40:00,00:40:01,- So good.
00:40:01,00:40:02,His site is great.
00:40:02,00:40:05,"So yeah, Steve or upheave Steve, as he's known."
00:40:05,00:40:08,"He is one of the major baggists, as they're known."
00:40:08,00:40:10,"And it is, as James is saying,"
00:40:10,00:40:13,"it's sort of like, it's not just airline bags."
00:40:13,00:40:16,You've got horror movies used to do novelty bags
00:40:16,00:40:17,that you would give out as well
00:40:17,00:40:19,for people that might barf in the cinema.
00:40:19,00:40:20,He collects those.
00:40:20,00:40:22,"NASA, he's managed to track down a few"
00:40:22,00:40:24,of the air sickness bags that went up with astronauts
00:40:24,00:40:25,and so on.
00:40:25,00:40:27,- Are they mostly used?
00:40:27,00:40:29,"- No, no, no, no, these are pristine."
00:40:29,00:40:30,- Never used.
00:40:30,00:40:33,"- No, of course they wouldn't fit flat in the archfiles,"
00:40:33,00:40:33,if you--
00:40:33,00:40:35,- I did look for some though on eBay.
00:40:35,00:40:37,I did think there must be an air sick bag
00:40:37,00:40:39,that was vomited into by Taylor Swift
00:40:39,00:40:40,"or something going for thousands,"
00:40:40,00:40:41,but couldn't find anything.
00:40:41,00:40:43,"- Thank God, that's your wife."
00:40:43,00:40:44,(laughing)
00:40:44,00:40:46,"You said about the horror movies,"
00:40:46,00:40:47,they still do that today.
00:40:47,00:40:49,Terrify 3 that came out earlier this year.
00:40:49,00:40:51,"If you went to the first screening of that,"
00:40:51,00:40:52,"they gave you some sick bags,"
00:40:52,00:40:54,"Saw 10, which came out last year."
00:40:54,00:40:55,They gave it you as well.
00:40:55,00:40:56,- Saw 10?
00:40:56,00:40:57,- Yeah.
00:40:57,00:40:58,"It was a pretty good one, Saw 10."
00:40:58,00:40:59,- What was it?
00:40:59,00:41:01,"- The Human Centipede, The Passion of the Christ,"
00:41:01,00:41:02,"The Mark of the Devil,"
00:41:02,00:41:05,all different movies where they gave sick bags
00:41:05,00:41:07,"out to the audience, especially in the screenings."
00:41:07,00:41:08,- The Passion of the Christ.
00:41:08,00:41:11,"- Yeah, in Belfast, when it was shown in Belfast."
00:41:11,00:41:12,- Wow.
00:41:12,00:41:13,"- It was a blasphemy, presumably."
00:41:13,00:41:16,"- Actually no, because there are some violent bits in it."
00:41:16,00:41:18,"- Oh yeah, I think it gets pretty,"
00:41:18,00:41:20,"I don't know if you'd know how the story ends, Anna,"
00:41:20,00:41:21,but it's not a PG.
00:41:21,00:41:23,- But it's just that the sick bags are a gimmick
00:41:23,00:41:26,"for what I assumed were B horror movies,"
00:41:26,00:41:27,"saying, ""Ha ha, look how scary we are."""
00:41:27,00:41:28,I thought The Passion of the Christ
00:41:28,00:41:29,took itself a bit more seriously.
00:41:29,00:41:32,"- Yeah, I think it was like the theaters did it,"
00:41:32,00:41:34,and I think they were trying to make a point a little bit
00:41:34,00:41:37,"by ironically, 'cause I went to watch that in Belfast"
00:41:37,00:41:39,and got a sick bag and vomited in it.
00:41:39,00:41:40,- You're kidding.
00:41:40,00:41:41,"- But when I looked in it,"
00:41:41,00:41:42,it looked just like Jesus Christ himself.
00:41:42,00:41:45,(both laughing)
00:41:45,00:41:47,- He got hit by lightning.
00:41:47,00:41:48,"- Who, Mel Gibson?"
00:41:48,00:41:49,"- No, the actor who played Jesus"
00:41:49,00:41:50,in The Passion of the Christ.
00:41:50,00:41:52,That's one of the famous on set stories.
00:41:52,00:41:53,- He got struck by lightning.
00:41:53,00:41:55,- It's very hard to get down from that cross
00:41:55,00:41:56,quickly when the storm starts.
00:41:56,00:41:58,(both laughing)
00:41:58,00:42:00,"- Fortunately, the cross was made out of tonka bean tree."
00:42:00,00:42:03,(both laughing)
00:42:03,00:42:06,"- The two thieves who are on either side of it,"
00:42:06,00:42:07,they got it much more.
00:42:07,00:42:10,"- That's how, I'm sorry, he got hit by lightning."
00:42:10,00:42:11,"- That's a story that's online,"
00:42:11,00:42:13,and I'm only just saying it out loud
00:42:13,00:42:15,"'cause it's the connection between lightning and that,"
00:42:15,00:42:17,"so it might be wrong, but it's, yeah."
00:42:17,00:42:19,"- Weirdly, one thing that always gets hit by lightning,"
00:42:19,00:42:21,"sorry, this is a telescope back to earlier in the show,"
00:42:21,00:42:24,is the statues of Jesus that it's always happening.
00:42:24,00:42:26,Christ the Redeemer gets hit several times a year
00:42:26,00:42:27,'cause it's very busy.
00:42:27,00:42:30,"- Yeah, on the top of a mountain"
00:42:30,00:42:32,in a very humid part of the world.
00:42:32,00:42:34,"- I know, but it seems like a sort of event for God"
00:42:34,00:42:35,is zapping statues of Christ.
00:42:35,00:42:36,"It seems like he's saying all the time,"
00:42:36,00:42:38,"""Look, I want you to try something else."""
00:42:38,00:42:43,"Anyway, Steve Silverberg, he has a loving partner,"
00:42:43,00:42:47,"we should say, of whom he says, ""She's amused by it,"
00:42:47,00:42:49,"""but has no interest in getting involved."""
00:42:49,00:42:51,And he's had some bad experiences in the past
00:42:51,00:42:53,before he met his lovely partner
00:42:53,00:42:56,of women who just didn't like it.
00:42:56,00:42:58,"- Is there not something to raise on the first date,"
00:42:58,00:43:00,"I would say, would be my advice to a sick bank collector."
00:43:00,00:43:02,- That's more of a third date kind of revelation.
00:43:02,00:43:03,- That's exactly it.
00:43:03,00:43:05,"So he, at one point, at his work,"
00:43:05,00:43:06,he was introduced to a new colleague
00:43:06,00:43:08,"and the person introducing them said,"
00:43:08,00:43:11,"""This is Steve, he works in IT and he collects sick bags"
00:43:11,00:43:14,"""and we've never got on from then onwards."""
00:43:14,00:43:17,I think that's a tough introduction to recover from.
00:43:17,00:43:19,"- It's all right, well, all right."
00:43:19,00:43:21,"- He's great though, I think he's really cool."
00:43:21,00:43:25,- The sick bag was invented by Gilmore Tillman Schendhal
00:43:25,00:43:29,"in 1949, who later made the world's first"
00:43:29,00:43:31,communication satellite.
00:43:31,00:43:33,It was a way that you could have live television
00:43:33,00:43:34,that was going from one side of America
00:43:34,00:43:36,to the other by bouncing it off this satellite
00:43:36,00:43:37,that he invented.
00:43:37,00:43:38,- That's cool.
00:43:38,00:43:39,"- And it was the same technology really,"
00:43:39,00:43:41,'cause he made plastics.
00:43:41,00:43:45,And he invented the idea of being able to put plastic
00:43:45,00:43:49,"on the inside of a bag so that when you throw up in it,"
00:43:49,00:43:50,it doesn't all leak out.
00:43:50,00:43:51,"- It's pretty obvious, isn't it?"
00:43:51,00:43:52,"You've got plastic bags, you've got paper bags,"
00:43:52,00:43:54,he just put them together.
00:43:54,00:43:55,- Someone needed to do it.
00:43:55,00:43:55,- I could have done that.
00:43:55,00:43:57,"- Someone needed to, and he did it."
00:43:57,00:43:58,- I could have done that.
00:43:58,00:43:59,"I couldn't have made the first satellite,"
00:43:59,00:44:01,but I could have done the bag thing.
00:44:01,00:44:03,"- But the satellite thing was, again, it was plastics."
00:44:03,00:44:06,And what he invented was the thing that allowed everything
00:44:06,00:44:09,to be stuck to the satellite without all falling off.
00:44:09,00:44:10,- Okay.
00:44:10,00:44:12,"- Basically, all the reflective stuff."
00:44:12,00:44:15,"- And he's kind of more known for the bag, isn't he,"
00:44:15,00:44:17,"than the satellite, and that really annoyed him in his day."
00:44:17,00:44:18,"- No, it did."
00:44:18,00:44:20,"In his life title, all the quotes from his wife and so on"
00:44:20,00:44:21,just said this is what dogged him his whole life.
00:44:21,00:44:23,Everyone always brought up the sick bags
00:44:23,00:44:24,rather than him.
00:44:24,00:44:25,- It's 'cause most people can't collect
00:44:25,00:44:26,communication satellites.
00:44:26,00:44:29,"I still think a little bit of a sense of humor failure, mate."
00:44:29,00:44:31,"I think you've got to own it, right?"
00:44:31,00:44:33,"- Yeah, I agree, I totally agree."
00:44:33,00:44:35,"Interestingly, there's a big complaint going on around"
00:44:35,00:44:37,"the world right now amongst the baggists,"
00:44:37,00:44:39,because it's a dying art.
00:44:39,00:44:41,Sick bags aren't as prominent as they used to be.
00:44:41,00:44:42,"And if they are there now,"
00:44:42,00:44:45,they kind of plain largely in a lot of cases.
00:44:45,00:44:46,"There used to be great designs,"
00:44:46,00:44:48,"like there's a deer vomiting on one,"
00:44:48,00:44:51,"which is apparently really loved, beautiful design."
00:44:51,00:44:52,There's funny jokes on a bunch of them.
00:44:52,00:44:55,"Now, because plane flights are getting less turbulent"
00:44:55,00:44:56,"because we're flying so much higher,"
00:44:56,00:44:58,it's getting a bit more safer.
00:44:58,00:44:59,People aren't using them as much.
00:44:59,00:45:00,"So air sickness is going down,"
00:45:00,00:45:01,hence they're investing.
00:45:01,00:45:03,"- Well, do you know, actually, I looked into this"
00:45:03,00:45:05,and people have never been sick on planes.
00:45:05,00:45:08,"Even the 1930s, they did a study of 0.2%"
00:45:08,00:45:10,of people with sick on planes they found.
00:45:10,00:45:12,I don't know why we've been using them for so long.
00:45:12,00:45:13,"They, and I have always thought..."
00:45:13,00:45:16,"- Well, I mean, if you're on an aeroplane"
00:45:16,00:45:19,"and there's 600 people, someone's gonna get sick, right?"
00:45:19,00:45:20,If it's 0.2%.
00:45:20,00:45:21,"- When it's that rare,"
00:45:21,00:45:22,and I don't want to put the responsibility
00:45:22,00:45:23,"always on the individual,"
00:45:23,00:45:25,but just bring your own sick bag.
00:45:25,00:45:29,- Are you sure that I think--
00:45:29,00:45:31,- I don't think that if I'm working on that aeroplane
00:45:31,00:45:33,"and someone's getting sick,"
00:45:33,00:45:34,"I don't want to be, well,"
00:45:34,00:45:35,I don't mind if you vomit everywhere
00:45:35,00:45:37,because you should have brought your own bag.
00:45:37,00:45:38,"- Fair enough, fair enough."
00:45:38,00:45:39,"- It's your seat, you know, you pay for it,"
00:45:39,00:45:40,you do your own it.
00:45:40,00:45:42,"And also, I think if someone gets off the plane"
00:45:42,00:45:43,"that they haven't used their sick bag,"
00:45:43,00:45:45,you don't have to replace it.
00:45:45,00:45:46,- That's a good point. - So it's a relatively low cost.
00:45:46,00:45:49,"Once every seat has one sick bag,"
00:45:49,00:45:51,you only need to replace one sick bag every 500 flights.
00:45:51,00:45:53,- That's a really good point.
00:45:53,00:45:54,- The Hermes Birkin bag.
00:45:54,00:45:57,"Anna, I know you're deep in the world of high fashion."
00:45:57,00:45:58,"- I am, yes, yes."
00:45:58,00:46:00,- Jane Birkin. - It's one of my favorite bags.
00:46:00,00:46:01,"- Yeah, Jane Birkin."
00:46:01,00:46:02,- I've been reading nonstop about that bag.
00:46:02,00:46:05,"Well, it started as a drawing on an airline sick bag."
00:46:05,00:46:06,"Cool. - Sorry, what is it?"
00:46:06,00:46:07,- It's a bag.
00:46:07,00:46:09,It's a very famous fashionable bag.
00:46:09,00:46:10,- Oh.
00:46:10,00:46:11,- It's got a picture of a vomiting tear on it.
00:46:11,00:46:13,(laughing)
00:46:13,00:46:14,- And it's not a sick bag.
00:46:14,00:46:16,"- No, it's not. - It's not a fashionable sick bag."
00:46:16,00:46:17,- It's just a fashionable bag.
00:46:17,00:46:20,"You can be sick in it, help yourself."
00:46:20,00:46:21,"- If you bought it, no one's stopping you."
00:46:21,00:46:24,It'll be the most expensive truck up of your life.
00:46:24,00:46:27,"- She was a very famous actor and singer,"
00:46:27,00:46:30,both in England and France during the '70s.
00:46:30,00:46:32,"And yeah, she was sort of an it girl"
00:46:32,00:46:34,as well as being a super talented singer.
00:46:34,00:46:36,"- Well, she was also good at drawing bags."
00:46:36,00:46:39,She ended up on a flight next to the head of Hermes.
00:46:39,00:46:42,And she told him I always need a big bag
00:46:42,00:46:43,to carry all my stuff around.
00:46:43,00:46:45,I think she might have been a recent mom at the time
00:46:45,00:46:46,and you know you need a lot of paraphernalia.
00:46:46,00:46:49,- I feel like he saw her bag fall down
00:46:49,00:46:50,and all the bits fell out.
00:46:50,00:46:52,And they wanted to design something
00:46:52,00:46:52,that meant everything to her.
00:46:52,00:46:53,- Something just workshopped.
00:46:53,00:46:56,"I mean, I think this story has given a lot more creators"
00:46:56,00:46:58,that they designed a slightly bigger bag basically.
00:46:58,00:47:01,Like the story of how she drew this bag
00:47:01,00:47:02,"on the L1 sick bag, she drew a bag."
00:47:02,00:47:04,- This is as impressive as putting a plastic bag
00:47:04,00:47:06,"inside a paper bag, you know."
00:47:06,00:47:08,You made a bit of a bigger bag.
00:47:08,00:47:09,"Well done. - Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:47:09,00:47:11,- Some other stuff on collectors.
00:47:11,00:47:13,"- Oh, yeah. - Yeah."
00:47:13,00:47:16,- The largest collection of silver coins in the world
00:47:16,00:47:20,exists thanks to cost 11 crisis.
00:47:20,00:47:22,That was a crisis that was had
00:47:22,00:47:26,"by Jose Manuel Costa-Lavin, a Mexican man."
00:47:26,00:47:27,- Oh my God.
00:47:27,00:47:29,"- Yeah, Costa-Lavin."
00:47:29,00:47:30,- Costa-Lavin crisis.
00:47:30,00:47:32,"- Oh, wow."
00:47:32,00:47:35,- Jose Manuel Costa-Lavin got cancer
00:47:35,00:47:37,and decided to distract himself from the cancer
00:47:37,00:47:40,by traveling the world looking for silver coins.
00:47:40,00:47:41,Now he's clear of cancer
00:47:41,00:47:43,and has the world's largest collection.
00:47:43,00:47:45,"- Okay, I've just got a few questions."
00:47:45,00:47:46,(laughing)
00:47:46,00:47:49,- About the process of how you got to this fact.
00:47:49,00:47:51,Did you start with the pun and find the fact
00:47:51,00:47:53,that the fact appeared in you?
00:47:53,00:47:56,- I went through the Guinness World Records website
00:47:56,00:47:57,"and looked for all the collectors,"
00:47:57,00:48:00,which I think is about 120 pages.
00:48:00,00:48:01,- Okay. - And looked for any funny names.
00:48:01,00:48:06,"So the largest collection of irons is 30,071"
00:48:06,00:48:12,by a guy called Ion Chirescu from Romania.
00:48:12,00:48:15,And the largest collection of Pikachu memorabilia
00:48:15,00:48:17,is by someone called Lisa Courtney.
00:48:17,00:48:19,"- Oh, Courtney. - Courtney Pokemon."
00:48:19,00:48:21,"- Courtney Pokemon. - Oh, nice."
00:48:21,00:48:23,- And the largest collection of Superman memorabilia
00:48:23,00:48:26,is by a guy called Perfecto P. Ball Hag.
00:48:26,00:48:30,"- Okay, so that's just an outright funny about name."
00:48:30,00:48:31,- Just a funny name.
00:48:31,00:48:33,- Perfecto P. Ball Hag.
00:48:33,00:48:34,Mr. and Mrs. Ball Hag.
00:48:34,00:48:36,He's gonna have a tough time in the playground.
00:48:36,00:48:37,We gotta give him a name.
00:48:37,00:48:38,"- No, no, it's worse."
00:48:38,00:48:40,"Actually, sorry, I misread it."
00:48:40,00:48:42,"It's Perfecto P. Ball Hag, Jr."
00:48:42,00:48:45,(all laughing)
00:48:45,00:48:47,- It's toughen me up.
00:48:47,00:48:48,It'll toughen him up.
00:48:48,00:48:51,(all laughing)
00:48:51,00:48:56,(upbeat music)
00:48:56,00:49:01,"- Okay, that's it."
