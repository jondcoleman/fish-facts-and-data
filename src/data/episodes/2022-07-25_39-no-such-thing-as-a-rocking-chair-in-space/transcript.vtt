WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.480
 We run it on QI a few years ago. Yeah. And which was there's no such thing as a fish?

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:09.440
 Yeah, there's no such thing as a fish. No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.720
 He says it right there. First paragraph. No such thing as a fish.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:25.280
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.760
 from the QI offices in Covern Garden. My name is Dan Schreiber. I'm sitting here with Anna

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.560
 Chazinski, Andy Murray, and James Harkin. And once again, we've gathered around the microphone

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.280
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days. And in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:47.920
 James. Okay, my fact this week is that the San Francisco Fire Department's ladders are made of wood,

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.720
 which is not perhaps the material you think would be good for putting near fire.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.920
 No, why are they? It's because in San Francisco, you have the wires that go over for the trams,

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.480
 they're electrified. And so if they use metal ladders, they might get electrocuted.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.480
 Yeah, they have had stories of people who, when they were trying to, they were trying to fight

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:11.520
 fires, they'd put the metal ladder and it hit a wire of some sort and just blow up the fire

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:18.480
 fires who are climate, not completely, but like, yeah. And so they use this wood, which is very

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:23.200
 high quality and they think that it's still fire resistant enough that it won't sell fire. High quality,

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.760
 like, I've got a high quality Mahogany table at home. Bit like that. It's quite hard to set fire

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.920
 to wood under the right circumstances. It doesn't just burst into flame like paper, you know. Yeah.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:38.800
 So this fact came from an email which I get sent to my inbox every day. It's called Now I Know,

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:44.320
 it's by a guy called Dan Lewis and it's every day full of interesting stuff. It's really good.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:50.080
 We're all fans. We're all fans, yeah, exactly. No, it's just full of QI style material and it's really good.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.680
 That's, say that's very cool about fire, fire ladders big made of wood. Are there only fire

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.040
 engines made of wood? No, I don't know. Are there any fire men made of wood?

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:04.080
 But if holes are made of wood, still are they quite often? They normally don't have

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.080
 holes anymore, do they? A lot of stations these days when they're built are on ground level.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.120
 And there was a room they were being being eradicated in Britain because of health and safety

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.560
 concerns which has been denied, although they are being eradicated in the US. So new fire stations

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.240
 don't have firemen's poles built in them usually anymore. It's a weird thing to fire

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:25.200
 them as well because I can get downstairs quite fast. I think it's, isn't it also because so fire

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.840
 stations always used to have spiral staircases, which I think is slower to get down because.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.280
 And you could injure yourself as well. Yeah. And the reason they had spiral staircases was

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.080
 because in the 19th century when fire trucks were obviously drawn by horses, they kept the horses

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.160
 downstairs, which is why fire stations are built on two floors often. And there was a problem with

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.880
 horses running up the stairs and they're not being able to get down the stairs. I think as well,

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:52.000
 it's because you're about to do something extremely dangerous. Lives do get lost and you can say,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.720
 oh yeah, he had some fun just before he went. Do you know about the first fire engine that we ever

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:04.000
 had? Like that wasn't horse-drawn? There was a guy called John Lofting and he created what was

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.880
 called the sucking worm fire engine. That's right. Yeah. And that was his first, that was,

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.600
 he sort of painted in that way. He worked on the name a bit. Why is it called that?

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.560
 Because it's water up. I guess because it sucks, it sucks something and it looks like a worm.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:29.280
 I'm testing. That's what it is. He invented a number of things. He also invented a horse-powered

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.880
 cymbal canirling machine. I don't know what canirling is. You know on the end of a cymbal,

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:40.960
 they have the kind of bumpy bits that you grip things it's making that. That's horse-powered.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:47.520
 Yeah, he did that for his power. So fire horses are quite useful, easily scared. Hence the reason

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:52.560
 that Dalmatians are known as fire dogs. So Dalmatians are always accompanied fire engines in the 19th

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.600
 century. I did not know that. And what were they used for? Loads of things. So first of all, they

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.080
 would keep the horses calm around the fire. So horses will freak out around the fire and apparently

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.840
 they were there as a comforting influence. But also I like the idea that the first fire siren,

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:13.680
 fire engine siren was Dalmatians barking because one of their purposes was to, if once the alarm

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.120
 sounded in a fire station, then Dalmatians would know that they had to run outside the fire station

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.640
 barking and the people would know to clear the way because the five men would have to get out.

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.640
 And then they would run in front because they can run really, really faster, really long

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.480
 distances. They would run in front of or around the fire engine, horse-drawn fire engine,

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.080
 barking and raising the alarm to everyone around saying get out of the way. That's fantastic.

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.640
 They're the original fire alarm. That's wonderful. Fire in these days, they don't want to

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.840
 rescue animals from trees anymore. Do they not? Well, it's not that they're in one place.

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:46.080
 They're saying that it's much more effective to call the RSPCA because it costs about 300

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.600
 quid every time somebody calls out. I heard a thing from the RSPCA that says, "If you see a

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:56.960
 cat up a tree, we advise you to leave it for 24 hours before calling the RSPCA, as they usually

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:02.800
 manage to get down by themselves." After all, when was the last time you saw a cat skeleton up a tree?

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.840
 Wow. It's quite a good point. It's really grim, the RSPCA.

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:13.200
 Also, the RSPCA have issued a press statement saying, "Can people please stop bringing them when

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:19.840
 there's a fire?" It's much more effective to call the fire brigade. Yeah. There's some

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:25.840
 animals that the London Fire Department have rescued recently, a kitten with its head stuck in a

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:34.640
 bongo 2009. Two dogs in a toilet in Bromley in 2009. That's a big toilet, isn't it? It could be tiny

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:39.920
 dogs, couldn't it? They could be, yeah, sorry. A chimp in a chimney in Tower Hamlet. Oh, chimp

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:44.800
 me. That's so cool. And an adult hamster trapped in a disabled lift, a great...

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.720
 So, I feel sorry for it, so they always release these press statements, emergency departments saying,

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.840
 "These are the ridiculous calls we've got, and the reason we're saying this is because we want you

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:57.840
 to stop making them." And the only effect it has is that on podcast like this, I guess we repeat what

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:04.320
 they've told us about it. But so, a recent call to the fire service include, "There are loads of

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:10.080
 people who get stuck in handcuffs. I think someone said about 70 people a year, call his fire department.

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:15.680
 Nine instances of men with rings stuck in awkward places." Do you remember what that means?

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:22.080
 It means penis. So it's not the ring going into something? Well, I have the statistic of nine

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:26.000
 instances of men with rings stuck on the penises, so I think it might be the same as the worst

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.720
 proposal ever, isn't it? She'll say no, and you'll be asked to leave the rest drunk.

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:35.760
 Other reasons, people have called fire engines. Someone with a loose seat stuck on his head.

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:39.200
 Do it. I really like that guy. He was only going in to get the dogs to be fair.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:44.880
 Did you guys know that George Washington was a volunteer firefighter?

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:52.800
 Oh, yeah. Not. Yeah. Yeah. Other famous firefighters, there was a guy who effectively was

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:59.440
 the evil carnival of the firefighting world called the red a dare. We heard of the red a dare?

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:06.880
 Yeah, so he was flying planes and you would put out fires from the skies. I just read about one

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:11.200
 of the fires that he put out that I'd not heard of, which I find amazing. It was in the Sahara and

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:17.040
 it was nicknamed the devil's cigarette lighter. It was a plume of flame that went as high as

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:24.720
 450 feet. Imagine that image of just a 450 foot pillar of flame down. What was it from? Was it

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:28.400
 just a very deep hole in the ground? I think so. I think so. The magma layer. Yeah, yeah,

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:33.120
 yeah, the whole thing is still have a seam of coal and it would have sat on fire one time.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:36.400
 It's just all the fuel is coming back. Yeah, I don't know for sure, but I imagine that.

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:40.000
 It will be that and I'm always amazed that they leave it. It's like if this office sat on fire,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.640
 me just strolling out into the street. I'll never mind. That's what we're supposed to do if there's a fire.

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:50.960
 It goes well, there's a nice fire. Yeah, don't stay. Yeah, so he had the biggest business and then

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:55.600
 but all of his best kind of associates who he had just working for him to set up their own businesses,

00:07:55.600 --> 00:08:00.960
 which is a shame. My favorite one was two of his top right-hand men. Asgard Boots Hansen and Ed

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:05.440
 Koot's Matthews left and I think they only left so they could start a business called Boots and Koot's.

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:14.080
 Yeah, which is what their business was called. That's great. Room burned down, didn't it, in 64 AD?

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:18.800
 Is that the fiddling while Ron burnt moment? Yes. What was the fiddling? Nero, the emperor,

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:22.320
 supposed to be. Yeah, he was carrying so little about the fire that he was playing the fiddle.

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:25.760
 Well, there are two contrasting reports, one of which says he saved everyone from the fire,

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:29.760
 one of which suggests that he started it because he wanted to rebuild room two thirds of it burned out.

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:35.840
 In a day? Maybe he probably claimed that but I do like the fact that when he realised people were

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:40.320
 blaming the Great Fire of Rome on him, he diverted the blame to Christians and he had a bunch of

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:46.960
 Christians burned and have their... Not exactly. And he would hold garden parties where he used the

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:52.160
 burning Christians' corpses as torches to light the garden party. Wow, he might have been awkward.

00:08:52.160 --> 00:09:00.640
 That party. Yeah. Is that Mike? Yeah, you invited to the party. Yeah, but no, it was about that actually.

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:04.880
 But I like that, it's the invitation. Does he also say guest or outdoor heater?

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:13.120
 Let's just finish on some ways that things have caught fire in London. Okay.

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:19.040
 Last few years, this is another London Fire Department press release. There was a fire started after

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:24.000
 someone tried to dry out a toilet roll, they had dropped down the loo by popping it in the microwave for a few

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:32.160
 minutes. Another one is a man using a pair of boxer shorts to vigorously apply linseed oil to a

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:39.920
 floor cause the pants to overheat and fire to start. That must have been so vigorous. Why was it

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:44.400
 cleaning them with his pants? It wasn't cleaning, I think he was adding the oil to kind of make it

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:48.400
 more durable. Is that what you do with linseed oil? Wait, he was putting linseed oil on a floor

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:53.920
 and then rubbing it with his pants. Yes. Right, that's what I question. Oh, the use of pants rather than

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:58.720
 another rag. Yeah. Yeah. As soon as you've employed a cleaner, they turned up. You don't seem to

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:06.480
 brought a cloth. Yeah. Got these guys. You haven't got a vacuum cleaner. Meet by sucking work.

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:18.080
 Okay, time for fact number two. And that is my fact. And my fact this week is

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:23.680
 astronauts do not snore. So they don't snore at all? You can't be an astronaut if you don't

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:27.440
 if you snore or they don't snore once they're in space. A mixture of the both. Let's start it on

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:33.200
 earth. Mostly when they're trying to find astronauts, they go through all sorts of rigorous

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:37.600
 challenges and they test them for certain things that they know that won't work in space. One of

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:42.000
 the things that they know won't work in space is that you'll become very irritated very quickly

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.480
 if one of the people in the International Space Station has a very loud snore. That's one of the

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:52.880
 things that they find. So they immediately disqualify people who have loud snores from being an astronaut

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:58.880
 and they did a test where they showed five astronauts who snore roughly at 16% of the time of

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:03.840
 their sleeping time. In space, once they got there, that 16 was reduced to less than one percent.

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:09.040
 So space actually reduces your snoring level and they think it's because of the gravity. They

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:14.880
 think it's because your tongue is not touching and blocking in the same way in your head. 75% of

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:19.440
 astronauts take sleeping pills, which I find interesting if they're on the International Space Station

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:24.080
 because most sleeping pills have warnings like "make calls drowsiness, decrease mental

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:28.880
 alertness, problems with coordination, don't drive or operate machinery, don't engage in hazardous

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:34.640
 occupations requiring complete mental alertness or motor coordination." That's possibly the heaviest

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:42.080
 machinery. It's a specific warning on there. Do not operate the International Space Station if

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:48.400
 you're taking this bill. Okay, so you're not allowed to go into space if you snore too much. Yes.

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:52.880
 But when you go into space, people don't snore as much anyway. Yeah. It doesn't seem really fair

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:56.240
 that you're stopping the snores from going in. They should just don't snore as much anyway.

00:11:56.240 --> 00:12:01.760
 I suppose there's too big a risk to send too big a risk. No, no, but if you send... What's the greatest

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:07.440
 risk of outer space travel? If you send a really heavy snore into space and then they have huge

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:11.360
 rounds with their colleagues because their colleagues can't sleep at all, that is a risk to

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:17.520
 admission shortly. Yeah, it is very odd. The amount of tests that... or the amount of things that

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:22.240
 can get you disqualified from being an astronaut these days, it's all to do with stuff that will irritate

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:27.440
 people who you're hanging out with. So I got this fact, by the way, from a book called "Packing from

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:34.720
 Mars" by Mary Roach. And it's the most fantastic book. If anyone listening to this likes astronauts,

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:40.880
 space, Mars, Rita, it's perfect as a book. And she has all these examples that the tiny things

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:46.000
 are going to irritate you most in space. So, and anywhere, people who are Arctic explorers and stuff,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.040
 she has all these passages taken out from French anthropologists saying, you know, it got to the point

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:56.320
 where the way he would sip his soup or the look or the way he'd blow out a candle pissed me off so much.

00:12:56.320 --> 00:13:02.080
 Why are you taking candles to the International Space Agency? No, no, this would be like an Arctic

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:08.320
 explorer. Again, it tells his birthday of the 18th show that we bring the candles. We've got in one of

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:16.800
 those really funny candles that never goes out. Unlike him. Do we do snoring? Britain's loudest

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:24.640
 snora is a woman, as far as I can tell. And so she's 60 years old, she snores at 111.6 decibels,

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:31.840
 which is 8 decibels louder than the roar of a low-flying jet. Wow. Yeah. Presumably, she was

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:37.520
 snoring so loud that either her husband or her kids or something said, listen, this is ridiculously

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:41.920
 loud, but I feel like we could do something with this. We could at least get a bit of press out of

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:48.080
 this. Yeah, let's call let's call the fire. Let's call someone to come and register your snore as

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:51.680
 the loudest. The only way they realized it was so loud, it was quite sad. Really, she went on that

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:56.080
 programme that was on a couple of years ago. This like snore school thing where it was a reality

00:13:56.080 --> 00:14:00.160
 TV show where people with sleep problems all hung out together in the same house. And so her husband

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:05.040
 said, please can you do this because this is terrible for me. And she went on it and everyone else who

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:10.480
 also had serious snoring problems heard her and went, wow, this woman is out of this world. And that's

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:15.760
 when they tested it. Okay, well that's good. She said that's when she realised that it wasn't normal.

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:20.640
 Okay. Okay, so you know when you see pictures of the astronauts on the moon and they're kind of

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:26.880
 hopping around. Yeah. Do you know why they're hopping around? No. So you might think it's because

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:30.960
 there's less gravity. So that's just a good way of you know about. Yeah. It's actually because their

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:34.880
 spacesuits weren't built for walking. They were really solid. So the only way to move around really

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:41.440
 was to kind of saute like a kangaroo. Like a kangaroo. That's amazing. Yeah, kangaroos in space.

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:47.920
 Just speaking of them being on the moon, Buzz Aldrin did an AMA not too long ago on Reddit. Ask

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:54.960
 me anything on Reddit. And he revealed that when he jumped onto the moon, so when they landed,

00:14:54.960 --> 00:15:00.160
 they didn't land hard enough that they'd gone. They expected the lunar module to go right into the

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:05.360
 moon, but it kind of just landed so softly that it didn't actually really dig into the ground.

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:09.680
 So the ladder from which they were meant to land on the moon on the outside was a lot higher

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:14.480
 than it should then it was meant to be. So they had to do a big drop to the moon. So Neil,

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:20.320
 you see him drop down and same with Buzz. Now when they're wearing their astronauts suits,

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:27.120
 they all have this kind of diaper system for both urine and for for crapping. And what happened

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:32.880
 was for feces. When Buzz Aldrin jumped down onto the moon, he landed so hard that he knocked the

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:37.840
 bit of the diaper system off that was meant to collect his urine completely away. And if we all

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:41.920
 remember, one of the first things he did on the moon was have a pee. And the pee went straight down

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:48.080
 into his boot. So his whole two hours on the moon was him. Yeah, was him just with a full

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:53.760
 bladder's worth a pee hanging out in his left foot. He had a terrible time. Buzz Aldrin on the moon

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:58.160
 was hazing. While he was hopping around, there was slosh and urine by his foot. That's going to

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:04.640
 spoil it, isn't it? A bit. Yeah, you would have that on your mind. Maybe it's the one situation where

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:08.400
 it's big enough you don't mind about sloshing around in your own way. I don't know that because

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:13.120
 Yuri Gagarin went back to Russia after coming back down. He says one of the biggest moments was when

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:18.000
 he was presented to the nation effectively and he was being presented with some kind of a ward.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.480
 And he looked down and he noticed that his shoelace was untied. And that's all he can remember from

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:26.400
 the event, the nervousness of just knowing that his shoelace was untied. So actually big moments

00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:32.080
 don't necessarily have pee in his shoes. Well, that was the other thing. You're in Gagarin.

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:40.480
 You know, there's no seats in space. What? Yeah, they used to have seats on mere and they realized

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:45.200
 you obviously just don't need seats in space. Who's using a seat? Is that why when you come back down

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:49.120
 from space to reoclimatise? One of the first things I was reading about the crew, I think it was Chris

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:52.560
 Hadfield crew that arrived back on Earth a couple of years ago. And one of the first things they give

00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:57.120
 you, like this crew, come and carry you out of the ship that you've landed on. And they put you in

00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:02.240
 especially designed reclining chair, which apparently helps you. Yeah, you sit for like half an hour to

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:08.320
 an hour just in these chairs once you get out. They do have chairs in the module that comes back

00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:13.520
 into Earth's atmosphere. Do you do sit in a chair there? But apparently nowhere else is there a chair?

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:17.120
 You don't need it. I would be really gutted to get up there and find out there were no chairs.

00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:21.280
 But how would you even sit? I would try and strap myself into the chair. You'd have to because

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:24.960
 of the zero gravity. I appreciate that. That's an obstacle. But what about if you look at it?

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:30.240
 If you want to sit down, you'd look like a dick. Like you would be the one astronaut in space who's like,

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:35.120
 oh, what am I reading? That would be an irritant. Why is he sitting on a chair when fucking space?

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:43.280
 Floating around on a rocking chair. Well, thanks to astronaut Murray, we have had to spend

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:46.160
 $18 million sending a lazy boy in space.

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:59.840
 Okay, time for fact number three. And that is Jacinski. My fact is that in March 1876,

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:07.040
 it rained mutton tasting meat in Kentucky. Well, actually, you say it, but the reason that

00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:11.360
 they knew it was mutton tasting was obviously because they tasted it when it happened. And it was

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:16.880
 pronounced by various people who tasted it as very palatable and a fresh meat, a butcher tasted it

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:21.200
 and said that it tasted like sort of high quality meat. Colonel Sanders tasted it and said this is

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:27.200
 the best thing I've ever tasted. Yeah, so what I find interesting about this, obviously there's

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:32.000
 lots of weird stuff fell from the sky stories, but we still have specimens of this meat and we're

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.800
 still trying to work out what it was. Do we know what it was? We don't know what it was. It went

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:40.800
 through various scientists at the time trying to work out what it was. So bits of this meat kept

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:45.600
 getting posted from one scientist to the next who all tasted. And you said it went through several

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:53.280
 seconds. So then it was sent to this guy called Leopold Brandeis, who said it tasted like frog or

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:59.760
 spring chicken legs, which was, and then I read in British newspaper at the time and they were saying

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:05.680
 we have heard of showers of frogs which ought to be acceptable in France, but we do prefer the idea

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:09.680
 of mutton tasting meat in Britain, which is just another nice example of 19th century newspaper

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:15.680
 racism, really. I read as well that someone, and this is this is a call back for long-term listeners,

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:20.480
 but someone after they thought that it wasn't mutton, they thought that it was star jelly,

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:26.160
 that they thought it was the mystical appearance of this. This was Leopold Brandeis. He said it tasted

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:31.120
 like frog and all chicken legs, and that's what he imagined star jelly would taste like. So it was

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:35.680
 that, and then it was sent to lots of other scientists who said no, it's not, and they concluded it

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:42.160
 definitely had animal cartilage lung tissue. Seven samples were examined by several scientists

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:47.360
 who confirmed some of it to be lung tissue, some of it to muscular tissue, and two samples to be made

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:52.720
 of cartilage. Can I tell you a theory that arose at the time, this was from the New York Times,

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:57.760
 it was a journalist called William Olden, William Livingston Olden. He said, and he was not being

00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:04.720
 entirely serious here, but it was a kind of meteor shower. He said, according to the present

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:08.720
 theory of astronomers, an enormous belt of meteoric stones constantly revolves around the sun,

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:12.320
 and where the earth comes into contact with this belt, she has soundly pelted. Similarly,

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:17.920
 we may suppose that there revolves about the sun a belt of venison, mutton, and other meats divided

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:22.800
 into small fragments, which are precipitated upon the, not a serious theory, he was trying to be funny.

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:25.920
 So the most serious theory, which arose at the time, and this is what they saw thing it was,

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:31.600
 is vulture vomit, because vultures, as I think we know, vomit is a defense mechanism, and they can

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:35.600
 vomit quite a lot, and the combination of stuff it was seems to imply that vultures would have been

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:41.040
 sawing really high above, which they can saw up to seven miles above the ground. So it would

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:46.640
 have caused it to scatter that far. Seven miles? Yes, seven miles in the air. They float the highest

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:51.120
 bird ever found, was found when it crashed into a plane, actually, but it was flying much higher

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:56.320
 than mountain rest. That's pretty, pretty harsh for this bird. It's like, I'm higher than it was ever been.

00:20:56.320 --> 00:21:03.200
 That's smart. Yeah. This is why they don't do that. So vulture vomit is done as a defense mechanism,

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:08.480
 and one of the things I was reading about it was if a vulture has a predator attacking it,

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:15.600
 the reason it will vomit, one reason might be that it's quite, it's got a bit of acidic stuff in

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:19.280
 the vomit, and it could go in the eyes of the predator and sting and make them go off, but the other

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:25.840
 reason is that it's an offering to say if you're hungry, have this instead of me. I know coyotes can

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:30.080
 eat vulture vomit, but it is so acidic, because vulture's stomachs, that's why vultures can eat like

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:35.120
 dead rotting gross meat. Yeah, yeah. Their stomachs can really break that shit down, because they're

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:39.600
 so acidic, so I'm surprised that many things can eat vulture vomit. But it also, it doesn't sound

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:45.920
 much of an offering, does it? It's like, oh, don't eat me, eat this disgusting acidic rotting meat.

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:52.960
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't know, actually, I'm going to eat you. Bearded vultures eat 70 to 90%

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:58.320
 bone. Oh, I don't know. That's amazing. As you say, their stomach acid is what allows them,

00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:04.160
 is incredibly strong, and also it's what lets them have, they can destroy cholera and anthrax

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:09.360
 bacteria, which is why they can eat such vultures. Yeah, there's a lot of antibodies that nothing

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:16.880
 else has. Yeah, vultures will often peck at dead animals through their anus. I'm sorry to say,

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:24.640
 other really, it's to beak back through their vein. It's to get at the entrails, which are

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:29.920
 full of good stuff. Do you guys know what a group of vultures is? It's cool. Yeah, there is some. What is it?

00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:38.000
 Kettle. Kettle, yes. That is one of many. There are other times. Yeah, there's five in total.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.040
 Wow, what are the others? Kettle, vult. Anna, do you want to throw it on in?

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:46.480
 Wow, damn it, I can't remember. A culture of vultures. Oh, that'd be very good, but no, there's a wake

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:54.640
 and a committee and a venue and venue. Oh, that would be terrible, wouldn't it, if you're having a

00:22:54.640 --> 00:23:00.080
 party. Hello, I'd like to book a venue, please. Three weeks later, load of vultures, turn up,

00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:15.120
 but you're not. Yeah, the kettle refers to vultures in flight, committees, vult and venue,

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:19.520
 refers them when they're resting in trees and a wake must be when they're eating dead stuff.

00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:25.120
 It's when they're feeding. Yeah, makes sense. Yeah, turkey vultures, we on their own legs.

00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:32.160
 Yeah, so does Buzz Aldrin. Yeah. Was he doing it for the same reason? I was just trying to cool myself

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:35.680
 down. I think that's what they do it. They do it to cool themselves down and also there's a theory

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:39.280
 that the urine is quite acidic and it might be a way of sterilizing their legs because they

00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:44.480
 stand in a lot of rotting flesh to feed. That's a good idea. Yeah, I wanted to move on just quickly

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:51.280
 to things falling from the sky. I found an article from a few years ago and this was a woman who described

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:57.600
 how a mysterious rock fell from the sky onto a derby street, not to passing goose to the ground.

00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:04.320
 That is mysterious. You thought it might have been a meteorite or something like that, but Dr. Andrew

00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:09.120
 Johnson, a geologist of the University of Derby, didn't think he was. He thought he was something

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:13.280
 like a piece of limestone from the peak district and they asked him, yeah, but how come it came from

00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:18.080
 the sky? And he said, I haven't got a clue where it came from unless somebody threw it in the air.

00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:25.840
 Did you see that story this week? Well, a guy in San Francisco who owned a Chinese restaurant

00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:31.040
 who was trying to defrost some meat out on the street. He was caught tenderizing his meat by

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:35.600
 bashing it on the pavement and stabbing it. And so they examined the pavement which was covered

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:40.800
 in blackened gum cigarette butts and tracked bacteria of all gut-twisting varieties according to

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:51.200
 the article. At least it's tender. Okay, time for a final fact and that is Andrew Hunter Murray.

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:56.240
 My fact is that the Victorians invented a coat which doubled up as a boat.

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:08.560
 invented by whom by Coots and Boots. There has been a Scottish version of Coots and Boots.

00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:16.640
 That's amazing. It was designed by a man called Peter Halkett who was a naval officer and he

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:22.800
 wanted something which you could go exploring with and take it over frozen terrain but which

00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:26.560
 would cope in extreme weather and which might get you out of a tight spot. So if the frozen terrain

00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:31.760
 started melting I guess the idea is it's getting warmer so I don't need my coat anymore. But I do need

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:38.960
 something. Amazing. Well, it was made of rubber and you should look for it online. We should try and

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:43.680
 put up a picture of it. I'll put it on your Twitter. I'll put it on my Twitter which is that it had

00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:47.760
 four separate compartments, very sensitively in case one of the got punctured and it took a few

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:54.240
 minutes to inflate and then it can support the weight of eight people. And the designs that he

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:59.040
 tested a prototype on the River Thames and he went nine miles on it and some explorers did genuinely

00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:03.360
 take it with them. So I guess if you're one of the seven people who doesn't have the coat you have

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:11.520
 to not take the piss of the idiot in the huge boat shape. Just in case it floods. Yeah, well it's

00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:18.320
 like that bra gas mask that won the ignoble price a few years ago. It's got two cups therefore can

00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:23.360
 support two people. This is an earlier version of that. I don't think that bra has been made to do.

00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:28.320
 It's called the wine rack and so far they can carry more than a bottle's worth of wine.

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:33.840
 And so it has the double benefit of increasing your cup size. So you pull the wine into it and

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:37.440
 you can kind of suck it out. You pull the wine into it. It's got a straw attached. It's made to hold

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:42.240
 the wine. Oh, like one of those cool sports pets that you have it when you watch baseball.

00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:49.280
 What are those cool spots? Yeah. Dunns wearing one now. He's been wearing one since the first episode.

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:54.320
 I'm actually wearing a bra as well. There's another one for men which is the beer belly which is

00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:59.760
 much less attractive than it can carry a six equivalent of a six pack of beer. Six pack very good.

00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:03.280
 But then during the night the man gets slimmer and the woman's breast gets smaller so he's

00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:08.000
 getting more attractive while she's chewing. It shouldn't have been like in his trousers to make his

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.960
 bulge look bigger, shouldn't it? Yes. Yeah. The cocktail.

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:23.680
 That movie has an old, different meaning now, doesn't it? Yeah, so this boat is just a co-boat, fantastic

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:30.320
 invention. Yeah. How would you inflate it? Or is it? I don't know. I think it was, I mean it's quite

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:36.160
 a big thing. So I presume you wouldn't have to be blowing it up. I think you'd have to pump it up,

00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:42.560
 because that'd be amazing at dinner when you take your codal and an eight-seater boat in place around

00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:49.760
 the table. Just come back to the restaurant cloakroom with your little ticket. Which one is yours?

00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:56.160
 Yeah, it's the black one that looks like a boat. Yeah, we've got eight of those. Which one is it?

00:27:56.160 --> 00:28:00.480
 You explorers. The last time we're hosting the Royal Geographical Society dinner here.

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:07.520
 Well, the idea of the thing, it came with a walking stick which can fold out into either a paddle

00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:13.920
 or a large umbrella, so you can set sail with the umbrella or row with the paddle. Actually,

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:18.960
 I read about a really interesting invention from roughly the same period, which was a cane,

00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:25.120
 it was a multipurpose cane, effectively the Swiss Army knife of Canes. It could do a number of

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:33.040
 things. It could be transformed into a flute, so you can play your cane as a flute. You could catch

00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:39.520
 butterflies with it, so it must have had some sort of net that came out of it. You could measure

00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:43.760
 horses with it. That was one of the selling points. I don't know who's measuring horses.

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:49.840
 Measure horses with any cane. This is three canes high. That's true. Well, this had a specific,

00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:54.080
 I don't know what it is that you use for. So what was it? What was the measure horses butterfly net?

00:28:54.080 --> 00:29:00.800
 What's the first one flute? And then it could also be an umbrella. This is my favourite thing in

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:05.920
 the advertising of it. It say that it can be an umbrella. Why an umbrella? Why? Of course,

00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:13.840
 to keep you dry. While you smoke your cane pipe. So it was also a pipe. So it's fantastic.

00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:20.240
 And another one with more than one use. Albert Pratt invented a thing called a gun helmet,

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:28.480
 which was helmets with a gun on it. You would aid your head while the target fire. And it was

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:33.840
 very good, but the one minor disadvantage during trials was that the recoil broke the wearers neck.

00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:42.720
 You're telling mystery. How did both armies end up completely away from the target?

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:48.800
 Do you think there's a fault with our gun helmet? No, no, more than there is with our leg grenade.

00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:54.160
 There's a really funny footage online, which I think Richard Weisman found first. Oh, it might have

00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:58.640
 been in this really good blog called Brain Pickings, but it's of when they were testing bullets and

00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:02.480
 bulletproof glass. And it's a man and woman testing it. And the man's holding this gun,

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:07.440
 standing about 25 feet from this woman who's just holding this tiny piece of bulletproof glass

00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:13.120
 in front of her face and letting him shoot her. It's great. And she just kind of rocks back.

00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:17.360
 It's like go again, hit me again. It's very terrifying seeing someone being shot at. It's really

00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:20.800
 counterintuitive. Yeah, it's confusing to me why they always put the person behind the bullet

00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:26.560
 proof glass test. Well, if they put in front of it, it's not going to work. It was an ancestor

00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:35.440
 of Anna's who invented the gun helmet. I found a patent in 1890 for a combined stepladder,

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:42.320
 cot, ironing board and chair. And it was designed, it was invented by one Stephen Fry.

00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:48.800
 Oh, really? Yeah. In what? 1890. Wow, prodigious. Maybe that's what he was doing before black

00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:56.480
 added. Yeah. I have one funny thing on coats. Okay. Uh, so Draco who wrote down the first legal code,

00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:59.600
 um, I think it was in the seventh century BC. It's the Conean comes from,

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:05.920
 where draconian comes from. Um, do you guys know how he died? No. It is written that it was a sign

00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:11.040
 of appreciation if someone was doing a public performance, which he would to, um, in public throw

00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:15.920
 your coat at him as like, hello, I guess that we throw flowers or something at someone now. He's

00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:21.920
 threw your coat at him. And the way he died was one person had a boat, an eight-seater boat,

00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:29.040
 crushed Draco. It was basically that the way he died was he suffocated under a huge pile of

00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:34.160
 appreciate him. Oh, really? Oh, yeah. Because people actually liked him, didn't they? People liked him,

00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:39.680
 yeah. He despised draconian measures. Oh, my. Why are there no pictures of like people most

00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:44.480
 appreciated person of the year? And it's just a picture of coats. You don't see the person is

00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:48.640
 the mountain. If that was still true, cloakroom attendance would be the most respect to people in

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:54.960
 society. That's true. Uh, someone's invented a jacket where you wear it as a normal jacket,

00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:59.600
 but there's an extra arm that hangs out so that your girlfriend can get underneath the arm,

00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:04.160
 but you don't need to have your arm over her. So you have two functioning arms and it's a third arm.

00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:07.680
 But does that knock knock people over in the street when you're just walking in line? When you've

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:12.880
 been dumped. Yeah, that's a sad side of walking home. As you will be five minutes after you say,

00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:17.680
 don't worry, darling, just put this fake arm over yourself and your competitors. I've delegated

00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:25.520
 the touching of you to this product I have bought. They've also developed mattresses which have grooves

00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:31.120
 in them so that you can put your arm underneath rather than get your arm trapped under whoever you're

00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:36.160
 in bed with. Because there's always a problem that if you're lying on your side, where do you put

00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:41.360
 your other arm, which is underneath you? Oh, yeah. So it's got an armhole. Okay. The armhole. Yeah,

00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:45.920
 and then you can just put on your same. The armhole is for a girlfriend. Well, as a man, you would lie

00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:48.800
 in bed and put your arm in the groove and then your girlfriend would lie on the other side of the bed.

00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:53.600
 So you're with you, but James, so that implies a horizontal groove, but then James is way which I

00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:57.760
 prefer because I'm not ridden to the whole arms in bed. What's that about? With her boyfriend thing.

00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:06.960
 I have a fake arm product you might be interested in. I like the idea of someone to put your arm

00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:10.720
 on when you're sleeping. That has been invented as well. I think they're two different inventions. Yeah,

00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:16.080
 they are. Because someone was plagiarising someone else there. From the people who brought you the

00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:24.240
 horizontal bed groove. The vertical bed groove. One more thing about inventions. So you know how

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:30.720
 car horns are kind of like a heart like quite horrible noises. They used to be much nicer.

00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:38.240
 And they changed that because one of Edison's assistants had a car and he nearly ran over someone

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:45.600
 in Newark and noted that his angel's harp noise of his horn had any impact on the pedestrian.

00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:49.600
 And he realised that he had to have a much harsher sounding horn. Yeah. It'd be quite nice

00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:54.240
 ending if you did actually hit someone because they didn't see your car coming and as they were dying,

00:33:54.240 --> 00:34:00.160
 you play the angel noise to make them think they're going somewhere nice. That might be a nice

00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:08.480
 comforting ending. Nice ending. Okay, that's it. That's all of our facts. Thanks so much for listening.

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:12.240
