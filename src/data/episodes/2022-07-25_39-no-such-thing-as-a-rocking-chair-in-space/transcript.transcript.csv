00:00:00,00:00:04,We run it on QI a few years ago. Yeah. And which was there's no such thing as a fish?
00:00:04,00:00:09,"Yeah, there's no such thing as a fish. No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life."
00:00:09,00:00:14,He says it right there. First paragraph. No such thing as a fish.
00:00:14,00:00:25,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you"
00:00:25,00:00:29,from the QI offices in Covern Garden. My name is Dan Schreiber. I'm sitting here with Anna
00:00:29,00:00:34,"Chazinski, Andy Murray, and James Harkin. And once again, we've gathered around the microphone"
00:00:34,00:00:39,"with our four favorite facts from the last seven days. And in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:39,00:00:47,"James. Okay, my fact this week is that the San Francisco Fire Department's ladders are made of wood,"
00:00:47,00:00:52,which is not perhaps the material you think would be good for putting near fire.
00:00:52,00:00:57,"No, why are they? It's because in San Francisco, you have the wires that go over for the trams,"
00:00:57,00:01:02,"they're electrified. And so if they use metal ladders, they might get electrocuted."
00:01:02,00:01:06,"Yeah, they have had stories of people who, when they were trying to, they were trying to fight"
00:01:06,00:01:11,"fires, they'd put the metal ladder and it hit a wire of some sort and just blow up the fire"
00:01:11,00:01:18,"fires who are climate, not completely, but like, yeah. And so they use this wood, which is very"
00:01:18,00:01:23,"high quality and they think that it's still fire resistant enough that it won't sell fire. High quality,"
00:01:23,00:01:27,"like, I've got a high quality Mahogany table at home. Bit like that. It's quite hard to set fire"
00:01:27,00:01:31,"to wood under the right circumstances. It doesn't just burst into flame like paper, you know. Yeah."
00:01:31,00:01:38,"So this fact came from an email which I get sent to my inbox every day. It's called Now I Know,"
00:01:38,00:01:44,it's by a guy called Dan Lewis and it's every day full of interesting stuff. It's really good.
00:01:44,00:01:50,"We're all fans. We're all fans, yeah, exactly. No, it's just full of QI style material and it's really good."
00:01:50,00:01:53,"That's, say that's very cool about fire, fire ladders big made of wood. Are there only fire"
00:01:53,00:01:57,"engines made of wood? No, I don't know. Are there any fire men made of wood?"
00:01:57,00:02:04,"But if holes are made of wood, still are they quite often? They normally don't have"
00:02:04,00:02:08,"holes anymore, do they? A lot of stations these days when they're built are on ground level."
00:02:08,00:02:11,And there was a room they were being being eradicated in Britain because of health and safety
00:02:11,00:02:16,"concerns which has been denied, although they are being eradicated in the US. So new fire stations"
00:02:16,00:02:20,don't have firemen's poles built in them usually anymore. It's a weird thing to fire
00:02:20,00:02:25,"them as well because I can get downstairs quite fast. I think it's, isn't it also because so fire"
00:02:25,00:02:29,"stations always used to have spiral staircases, which I think is slower to get down because."
00:02:29,00:02:33,And you could injure yourself as well. Yeah. And the reason they had spiral staircases was
00:02:33,00:02:38,"because in the 19th century when fire trucks were obviously drawn by horses, they kept the horses"
00:02:38,00:02:42,"downstairs, which is why fire stations are built on two floors often. And there was a problem with"
00:02:42,00:02:46,"horses running up the stairs and they're not being able to get down the stairs. I think as well,"
00:02:46,00:02:52,"it's because you're about to do something extremely dangerous. Lives do get lost and you can say,"
00:02:52,00:02:58,"oh yeah, he had some fun just before he went. Do you know about the first fire engine that we ever"
00:02:58,00:03:04,had? Like that wasn't horse-drawn? There was a guy called John Lofting and he created what was
00:03:04,00:03:10,"called the sucking worm fire engine. That's right. Yeah. And that was his first, that was,"
00:03:10,00:03:15,he sort of painted in that way. He worked on the name a bit. Why is it called that?
00:03:15,00:03:20,"Because it's water up. I guess because it sucks, it sucks something and it looks like a worm."
00:03:20,00:03:29,I'm testing. That's what it is. He invented a number of things. He also invented a horse-powered
00:03:29,00:03:34,"cymbal canirling machine. I don't know what canirling is. You know on the end of a cymbal,"
00:03:34,00:03:40,they have the kind of bumpy bits that you grip things it's making that. That's horse-powered.
00:03:40,00:03:47,"Yeah, he did that for his power. So fire horses are quite useful, easily scared. Hence the reason"
00:03:47,00:03:52,that Dalmatians are known as fire dogs. So Dalmatians are always accompanied fire engines in the 19th
00:03:52,00:03:57,"century. I did not know that. And what were they used for? Loads of things. So first of all, they"
00:03:57,00:04:02,would keep the horses calm around the fire. So horses will freak out around the fire and apparently
00:04:02,00:04:07,"they were there as a comforting influence. But also I like the idea that the first fire siren,"
00:04:07,00:04:13,"fire engine siren was Dalmatians barking because one of their purposes was to, if once the alarm"
00:04:13,00:04:17,"sounded in a fire station, then Dalmatians would know that they had to run outside the fire station"
00:04:17,00:04:20,barking and the people would know to clear the way because the five men would have to get out.
00:04:20,00:04:24,"And then they would run in front because they can run really, really faster, really long"
00:04:24,00:04:28,"distances. They would run in front of or around the fire engine, horse-drawn fire engine,"
00:04:28,00:04:32,barking and raising the alarm to everyone around saying get out of the way. That's fantastic.
00:04:32,00:04:36,"They're the original fire alarm. That's wonderful. Fire in these days, they don't want to"
00:04:36,00:04:39,"rescue animals from trees anymore. Do they not? Well, it's not that they're in one place."
00:04:39,00:04:46,They're saying that it's much more effective to call the RSPCA because it costs about 300
00:04:46,00:04:51,"quid every time somebody calls out. I heard a thing from the RSPCA that says, ""If you see a"
00:04:51,00:04:56,"cat up a tree, we advise you to leave it for 24 hours before calling the RSPCA, as they usually"
00:04:56,00:05:02,"manage to get down by themselves."" After all, when was the last time you saw a cat skeleton up a tree?"
00:05:02,00:05:07,"Wow. It's quite a good point. It's really grim, the RSPCA."
00:05:07,00:05:13,"Also, the RSPCA have issued a press statement saying, ""Can people please stop bringing them when"
00:05:13,00:05:19,"there's a fire?"" It's much more effective to call the fire brigade. Yeah. There's some"
00:05:19,00:05:25,"animals that the London Fire Department have rescued recently, a kitten with its head stuck in a"
00:05:25,00:05:34,"bongo 2009. Two dogs in a toilet in Bromley in 2009. That's a big toilet, isn't it? It could be tiny"
00:05:34,00:05:39,"dogs, couldn't it? They could be, yeah, sorry. A chimp in a chimney in Tower Hamlet. Oh, chimp"
00:05:39,00:05:44,"me. That's so cool. And an adult hamster trapped in a disabled lift, a great..."
00:05:46,00:05:50,"So, I feel sorry for it, so they always release these press statements, emergency departments saying,"
00:05:50,00:05:53,"""These are the ridiculous calls we've got, and the reason we're saying this is because we want you"
00:05:53,00:05:57,"to stop making them."" And the only effect it has is that on podcast like this, I guess we repeat what"
00:05:57,00:06:04,"they've told us about it. But so, a recent call to the fire service include, ""There are loads of"
00:06:04,00:06:10,"people who get stuck in handcuffs. I think someone said about 70 people a year, call his fire department."
00:06:10,00:06:15,"Nine instances of men with rings stuck in awkward places."" Do you remember what that means?"
00:06:15,00:06:22,"It means penis. So it's not the ring going into something? Well, I have the statistic of nine"
00:06:22,00:06:26,"instances of men with rings stuck on the penises, so I think it might be the same as the worst"
00:06:26,00:06:30,"proposal ever, isn't it? She'll say no, and you'll be asked to leave the rest drunk."
00:06:30,00:06:35,"Other reasons, people have called fire engines. Someone with a loose seat stuck on his head."
00:06:35,00:06:39,Do it. I really like that guy. He was only going in to get the dogs to be fair.
00:06:39,00:06:44,Did you guys know that George Washington was a volunteer firefighter?
00:06:45,00:06:52,"Oh, yeah. Not. Yeah. Yeah. Other famous firefighters, there was a guy who effectively was"
00:06:52,00:06:59,the evil carnival of the firefighting world called the red a dare. We heard of the red a dare?
00:06:59,00:07:06,"Yeah, so he was flying planes and you would put out fires from the skies. I just read about one"
00:07:06,00:07:11,"of the fires that he put out that I'd not heard of, which I find amazing. It was in the Sahara and"
00:07:11,00:07:17,it was nicknamed the devil's cigarette lighter. It was a plume of flame that went as high as
00:07:17,00:07:24,450 feet. Imagine that image of just a 450 foot pillar of flame down. What was it from? Was it
00:07:24,00:07:28,"just a very deep hole in the ground? I think so. I think so. The magma layer. Yeah, yeah,"
00:07:28,00:07:33,"yeah, the whole thing is still have a seam of coal and it would have sat on fire one time."
00:07:33,00:07:36,"It's just all the fuel is coming back. Yeah, I don't know for sure, but I imagine that."
00:07:36,00:07:40,"It will be that and I'm always amazed that they leave it. It's like if this office sat on fire,"
00:07:40,00:07:44,me just strolling out into the street. I'll never mind. That's what we're supposed to do if there's a fire.
00:07:44,00:07:50,"It goes well, there's a nice fire. Yeah, don't stay. Yeah, so he had the biggest business and then"
00:07:50,00:07:55,"but all of his best kind of associates who he had just working for him to set up their own businesses,"
00:07:55,00:08:00,which is a shame. My favorite one was two of his top right-hand men. Asgard Boots Hansen and Ed
00:08:00,00:08:05,Koot's Matthews left and I think they only left so they could start a business called Boots and Koot's.
00:08:05,00:08:14,"Yeah, which is what their business was called. That's great. Room burned down, didn't it, in 64 AD?"
00:08:14,00:08:18,"Is that the fiddling while Ron burnt moment? Yes. What was the fiddling? Nero, the emperor,"
00:08:18,00:08:22,"supposed to be. Yeah, he was carrying so little about the fire that he was playing the fiddle."
00:08:22,00:08:25,"Well, there are two contrasting reports, one of which says he saved everyone from the fire,"
00:08:25,00:08:29,one of which suggests that he started it because he wanted to rebuild room two thirds of it burned out.
00:08:29,00:08:35,In a day? Maybe he probably claimed that but I do like the fact that when he realised people were
00:08:35,00:08:40,"blaming the Great Fire of Rome on him, he diverted the blame to Christians and he had a bunch of"
00:08:40,00:08:46,Christians burned and have their... Not exactly. And he would hold garden parties where he used the
00:08:46,00:08:52,"burning Christians' corpses as torches to light the garden party. Wow, he might have been awkward."
00:08:52,00:09:00,"That party. Yeah. Is that Mike? Yeah, you invited to the party. Yeah, but no, it was about that actually."
00:09:00,00:09:04,"But I like that, it's the invitation. Does he also say guest or outdoor heater?"
00:09:04,00:09:13,Let's just finish on some ways that things have caught fire in London. Okay.
00:09:13,00:09:19,"Last few years, this is another London Fire Department press release. There was a fire started after"
00:09:19,00:09:24,"someone tried to dry out a toilet roll, they had dropped down the loo by popping it in the microwave for a few"
00:09:24,00:09:32,minutes. Another one is a man using a pair of boxer shorts to vigorously apply linseed oil to a
00:09:32,00:09:39,floor cause the pants to overheat and fire to start. That must have been so vigorous. Why was it
00:09:39,00:09:44,"cleaning them with his pants? It wasn't cleaning, I think he was adding the oil to kind of make it"
00:09:44,00:09:48,"more durable. Is that what you do with linseed oil? Wait, he was putting linseed oil on a floor"
00:09:48,00:09:53,"and then rubbing it with his pants. Yes. Right, that's what I question. Oh, the use of pants rather than"
00:09:53,00:09:58,"another rag. Yeah. Yeah. As soon as you've employed a cleaner, they turned up. You don't seem to"
00:09:58,00:10:06,brought a cloth. Yeah. Got these guys. You haven't got a vacuum cleaner. Meet by sucking work.
00:10:06,00:10:18,"Okay, time for fact number two. And that is my fact. And my fact this week is"
00:10:18,00:10:23,astronauts do not snore. So they don't snore at all? You can't be an astronaut if you don't
00:10:23,00:10:27,if you snore or they don't snore once they're in space. A mixture of the both. Let's start it on
00:10:27,00:10:33,"earth. Mostly when they're trying to find astronauts, they go through all sorts of rigorous"
00:10:33,00:10:37,challenges and they test them for certain things that they know that won't work in space. One of
00:10:37,00:10:42,the things that they know won't work in space is that you'll become very irritated very quickly
00:10:42,00:10:46,if one of the people in the International Space Station has a very loud snore. That's one of the
00:10:46,00:10:52,things that they find. So they immediately disqualify people who have loud snores from being an astronaut
00:10:52,00:10:58,and they did a test where they showed five astronauts who snore roughly at 16% of the time of
00:10:58,00:11:03,"their sleeping time. In space, once they got there, that 16 was reduced to less than one percent."
00:11:03,00:11:09,So space actually reduces your snoring level and they think it's because of the gravity. They
00:11:09,00:11:14,think it's because your tongue is not touching and blocking in the same way in your head. 75% of
00:11:14,00:11:19,"astronauts take sleeping pills, which I find interesting if they're on the International Space Station"
00:11:19,00:11:24,"because most sleeping pills have warnings like ""make calls drowsiness, decrease mental"
00:11:24,00:11:28,"alertness, problems with coordination, don't drive or operate machinery, don't engage in hazardous"
00:11:28,00:11:34,"occupations requiring complete mental alertness or motor coordination."" That's possibly the heaviest"
00:11:34,00:11:42,machinery. It's a specific warning on there. Do not operate the International Space Station if
00:11:42,00:11:48,"you're taking this bill. Okay, so you're not allowed to go into space if you snore too much. Yes."
00:11:48,00:11:52,"But when you go into space, people don't snore as much anyway. Yeah. It doesn't seem really fair"
00:11:52,00:11:56,that you're stopping the snores from going in. They should just don't snore as much anyway.
00:11:56,00:12:01,"I suppose there's too big a risk to send too big a risk. No, no, but if you send... What's the greatest"
00:12:01,00:12:07,risk of outer space travel? If you send a really heavy snore into space and then they have huge
00:12:07,00:12:11,"rounds with their colleagues because their colleagues can't sleep at all, that is a risk to"
00:12:11,00:12:17,"admission shortly. Yeah, it is very odd. The amount of tests that... or the amount of things that"
00:12:17,00:12:22,"can get you disqualified from being an astronaut these days, it's all to do with stuff that will irritate"
00:12:22,00:12:27,"people who you're hanging out with. So I got this fact, by the way, from a book called ""Packing from"
00:12:27,00:12:34,"Mars"" by Mary Roach. And it's the most fantastic book. If anyone listening to this likes astronauts,"
00:12:34,00:12:40,"space, Mars, Rita, it's perfect as a book. And she has all these examples that the tiny things"
00:12:40,00:12:46,"are going to irritate you most in space. So, and anywhere, people who are Arctic explorers and stuff,"
00:12:46,00:12:51,"she has all these passages taken out from French anthropologists saying, you know, it got to the point"
00:12:51,00:12:56,where the way he would sip his soup or the look or the way he'd blow out a candle pissed me off so much.
00:12:56,00:13:02,"Why are you taking candles to the International Space Agency? No, no, this would be like an Arctic"
00:13:02,00:13:08,"explorer. Again, it tells his birthday of the 18th show that we bring the candles. We've got in one of"
00:13:08,00:13:16,those really funny candles that never goes out. Unlike him. Do we do snoring? Britain's loudest
00:13:16,00:13:24,"snora is a woman, as far as I can tell. And so she's 60 years old, she snores at 111.6 decibels,"
00:13:24,00:13:31,"which is 8 decibels louder than the roar of a low-flying jet. Wow. Yeah. Presumably, she was"
00:13:31,00:13:37,"snoring so loud that either her husband or her kids or something said, listen, this is ridiculously"
00:13:37,00:13:41,"loud, but I feel like we could do something with this. We could at least get a bit of press out of"
00:13:41,00:13:48,"this. Yeah, let's call let's call the fire. Let's call someone to come and register your snore as"
00:13:48,00:13:51,"the loudest. The only way they realized it was so loud, it was quite sad. Really, she went on that"
00:13:51,00:13:56,programme that was on a couple of years ago. This like snore school thing where it was a reality
00:13:56,00:14:00,TV show where people with sleep problems all hung out together in the same house. And so her husband
00:14:00,00:14:05,"said, please can you do this because this is terrible for me. And she went on it and everyone else who"
00:14:05,00:14:10,"also had serious snoring problems heard her and went, wow, this woman is out of this world. And that's"
00:14:10,00:14:15,"when they tested it. Okay, well that's good. She said that's when she realised that it wasn't normal."
00:14:15,00:14:20,"Okay. Okay, so you know when you see pictures of the astronauts on the moon and they're kind of"
00:14:20,00:14:26,hopping around. Yeah. Do you know why they're hopping around? No. So you might think it's because
00:14:26,00:14:30,there's less gravity. So that's just a good way of you know about. Yeah. It's actually because their
00:14:30,00:14:34,spacesuits weren't built for walking. They were really solid. So the only way to move around really
00:14:34,00:14:41,"was to kind of saute like a kangaroo. Like a kangaroo. That's amazing. Yeah, kangaroos in space."
00:14:41,00:14:47,"Just speaking of them being on the moon, Buzz Aldrin did an AMA not too long ago on Reddit. Ask"
00:14:47,00:14:54,"me anything on Reddit. And he revealed that when he jumped onto the moon, so when they landed,"
00:14:54,00:15:00,they didn't land hard enough that they'd gone. They expected the lunar module to go right into the
00:15:00,00:15:05,"moon, but it kind of just landed so softly that it didn't actually really dig into the ground."
00:15:05,00:15:09,So the ladder from which they were meant to land on the moon on the outside was a lot higher
00:15:09,00:15:14,"than it should then it was meant to be. So they had to do a big drop to the moon. So Neil,"
00:15:14,00:15:20,"you see him drop down and same with Buzz. Now when they're wearing their astronauts suits,"
00:15:20,00:15:27,they all have this kind of diaper system for both urine and for for crapping. And what happened
00:15:27,00:15:32,"was for feces. When Buzz Aldrin jumped down onto the moon, he landed so hard that he knocked the"
00:15:32,00:15:37,bit of the diaper system off that was meant to collect his urine completely away. And if we all
00:15:37,00:15:41,"remember, one of the first things he did on the moon was have a pee. And the pee went straight down"
00:15:41,00:15:48,"into his boot. So his whole two hours on the moon was him. Yeah, was him just with a full"
00:15:48,00:15:53,bladder's worth a pee hanging out in his left foot. He had a terrible time. Buzz Aldrin on the moon
00:15:53,00:15:58,"was hazing. While he was hopping around, there was slosh and urine by his foot. That's going to"
00:15:58,00:16:04,"spoil it, isn't it? A bit. Yeah, you would have that on your mind. Maybe it's the one situation where"
00:16:04,00:16:08,it's big enough you don't mind about sloshing around in your own way. I don't know that because
00:16:08,00:16:13,Yuri Gagarin went back to Russia after coming back down. He says one of the biggest moments was when
00:16:13,00:16:18,he was presented to the nation effectively and he was being presented with some kind of a ward.
00:16:18,00:16:22,And he looked down and he noticed that his shoelace was untied. And that's all he can remember from
00:16:22,00:16:26,"the event, the nervousness of just knowing that his shoelace was untied. So actually big moments"
00:16:26,00:16:32,"don't necessarily have pee in his shoes. Well, that was the other thing. You're in Gagarin."
00:16:32,00:16:40,"You know, there's no seats in space. What? Yeah, they used to have seats on mere and they realized"
00:16:40,00:16:45,you obviously just don't need seats in space. Who's using a seat? Is that why when you come back down
00:16:45,00:16:49,"from space to reoclimatise? One of the first things I was reading about the crew, I think it was Chris"
00:16:49,00:16:52,Hadfield crew that arrived back on Earth a couple of years ago. And one of the first things they give
00:16:52,00:16:57,"you, like this crew, come and carry you out of the ship that you've landed on. And they put you in"
00:16:57,00:17:02,"especially designed reclining chair, which apparently helps you. Yeah, you sit for like half an hour to"
00:17:02,00:17:08,an hour just in these chairs once you get out. They do have chairs in the module that comes back
00:17:08,00:17:13,into Earth's atmosphere. Do you do sit in a chair there? But apparently nowhere else is there a chair?
00:17:13,00:17:17,You don't need it. I would be really gutted to get up there and find out there were no chairs.
00:17:17,00:17:21,But how would you even sit? I would try and strap myself into the chair. You'd have to because
00:17:21,00:17:24,of the zero gravity. I appreciate that. That's an obstacle. But what about if you look at it?
00:17:24,00:17:30,"If you want to sit down, you'd look like a dick. Like you would be the one astronaut in space who's like,"
00:17:30,00:17:35,"oh, what am I reading? That would be an irritant. Why is he sitting on a chair when fucking space?"
00:17:36,00:17:43,"Floating around on a rocking chair. Well, thanks to astronaut Murray, we have had to spend"
00:17:43,00:17:46,$18 million sending a lazy boy in space.
00:17:46,00:17:59,"Okay, time for fact number three. And that is Jacinski. My fact is that in March 1876,"
00:17:59,00:18:07,"it rained mutton tasting meat in Kentucky. Well, actually, you say it, but the reason that"
00:18:07,00:18:11,they knew it was mutton tasting was obviously because they tasted it when it happened. And it was
00:18:11,00:18:16,"pronounced by various people who tasted it as very palatable and a fresh meat, a butcher tasted it"
00:18:16,00:18:21,and said that it tasted like sort of high quality meat. Colonel Sanders tasted it and said this is
00:18:21,00:18:27,"the best thing I've ever tasted. Yeah, so what I find interesting about this, obviously there's"
00:18:27,00:18:32,"lots of weird stuff fell from the sky stories, but we still have specimens of this meat and we're"
00:18:32,00:18:36,still trying to work out what it was. Do we know what it was? We don't know what it was. It went
00:18:36,00:18:40,through various scientists at the time trying to work out what it was. So bits of this meat kept
00:18:40,00:18:45,getting posted from one scientist to the next who all tasted. And you said it went through several
00:18:45,00:18:53,"seconds. So then it was sent to this guy called Leopold Brandeis, who said it tasted like frog or"
00:18:53,00:18:59,"spring chicken legs, which was, and then I read in British newspaper at the time and they were saying"
00:18:59,00:19:05,"we have heard of showers of frogs which ought to be acceptable in France, but we do prefer the idea"
00:19:05,00:19:09,"of mutton tasting meat in Britain, which is just another nice example of 19th century newspaper"
00:19:09,00:19:15,"racism, really. I read as well that someone, and this is this is a call back for long-term listeners,"
00:19:15,00:19:20,"but someone after they thought that it wasn't mutton, they thought that it was star jelly,"
00:19:20,00:19:26,that they thought it was the mystical appearance of this. This was Leopold Brandeis. He said it tasted
00:19:26,00:19:31,"like frog and all chicken legs, and that's what he imagined star jelly would taste like. So it was"
00:19:31,00:19:35,"that, and then it was sent to lots of other scientists who said no, it's not, and they concluded it"
00:19:35,00:19:42,definitely had animal cartilage lung tissue. Seven samples were examined by several scientists
00:19:42,00:19:47,"who confirmed some of it to be lung tissue, some of it to muscular tissue, and two samples to be made"
00:19:47,00:19:52,"of cartilage. Can I tell you a theory that arose at the time, this was from the New York Times,"
00:19:52,00:19:57,"it was a journalist called William Olden, William Livingston Olden. He said, and he was not being"
00:19:57,00:20:04,"entirely serious here, but it was a kind of meteor shower. He said, according to the present"
00:20:04,00:20:08,"theory of astronomers, an enormous belt of meteoric stones constantly revolves around the sun,"
00:20:08,00:20:12,"and where the earth comes into contact with this belt, she has soundly pelted. Similarly,"
00:20:12,00:20:17,"we may suppose that there revolves about the sun a belt of venison, mutton, and other meats divided"
00:20:17,00:20:22,"into small fragments, which are precipitated upon the, not a serious theory, he was trying to be funny."
00:20:22,00:20:25,"So the most serious theory, which arose at the time, and this is what they saw thing it was,"
00:20:25,00:20:31,"is vulture vomit, because vultures, as I think we know, vomit is a defense mechanism, and they can"
00:20:31,00:20:35,"vomit quite a lot, and the combination of stuff it was seems to imply that vultures would have been"
00:20:35,00:20:41,"sawing really high above, which they can saw up to seven miles above the ground. So it would"
00:20:41,00:20:46,"have caused it to scatter that far. Seven miles? Yes, seven miles in the air. They float the highest"
00:20:46,00:20:51,"bird ever found, was found when it crashed into a plane, actually, but it was flying much higher"
00:20:51,00:20:56,"than mountain rest. That's pretty, pretty harsh for this bird. It's like, I'm higher than it was ever been."
00:20:56,00:21:03,"That's smart. Yeah. This is why they don't do that. So vulture vomit is done as a defense mechanism,"
00:21:03,00:21:08,"and one of the things I was reading about it was if a vulture has a predator attacking it,"
00:21:09,00:21:15,"the reason it will vomit, one reason might be that it's quite, it's got a bit of acidic stuff in"
00:21:15,00:21:19,"the vomit, and it could go in the eyes of the predator and sting and make them go off, but the other"
00:21:19,00:21:25,"reason is that it's an offering to say if you're hungry, have this instead of me. I know coyotes can"
00:21:25,00:21:30,"eat vulture vomit, but it is so acidic, because vulture's stomachs, that's why vultures can eat like"
00:21:30,00:21:35,"dead rotting gross meat. Yeah, yeah. Their stomachs can really break that shit down, because they're"
00:21:35,00:21:39,"so acidic, so I'm surprised that many things can eat vulture vomit. But it also, it doesn't sound"
00:21:39,00:21:45,"much of an offering, does it? It's like, oh, don't eat me, eat this disgusting acidic rotting meat."
00:21:45,00:21:52,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't know, actually, I'm going to eat you. Bearded vultures eat 70 to 90%"
00:21:52,00:21:58,"bone. Oh, I don't know. That's amazing. As you say, their stomach acid is what allows them,"
00:21:58,00:22:04,"is incredibly strong, and also it's what lets them have, they can destroy cholera and anthrax"
00:22:04,00:22:09,"bacteria, which is why they can eat such vultures. Yeah, there's a lot of antibodies that nothing"
00:22:09,00:22:16,"else has. Yeah, vultures will often peck at dead animals through their anus. I'm sorry to say,"
00:22:16,00:22:24,"other really, it's to beak back through their vein. It's to get at the entrails, which are"
00:22:24,00:22:29,"full of good stuff. Do you guys know what a group of vultures is? It's cool. Yeah, there is some. What is it?"
00:22:29,00:22:38,"Kettle. Kettle, yes. That is one of many. There are other times. Yeah, there's five in total."
00:22:38,00:22:41,"Wow, what are the others? Kettle, vult. Anna, do you want to throw it on in?"
00:22:41,00:22:46,"Wow, damn it, I can't remember. A culture of vultures. Oh, that'd be very good, but no, there's a wake"
00:22:46,00:22:54,"and a committee and a venue and venue. Oh, that would be terrible, wouldn't it, if you're having a"
00:22:54,00:23:00,"party. Hello, I'd like to book a venue, please. Three weeks later, load of vultures, turn up,"
00:23:00,00:23:15,"but you're not. Yeah, the kettle refers to vultures in flight, committees, vult and venue,"
00:23:15,00:23:19,refers them when they're resting in trees and a wake must be when they're eating dead stuff.
00:23:19,00:23:25,"It's when they're feeding. Yeah, makes sense. Yeah, turkey vultures, we on their own legs."
00:23:25,00:23:32,"Yeah, so does Buzz Aldrin. Yeah. Was he doing it for the same reason? I was just trying to cool myself"
00:23:32,00:23:35,down. I think that's what they do it. They do it to cool themselves down and also there's a theory
00:23:35,00:23:39,that the urine is quite acidic and it might be a way of sterilizing their legs because they
00:23:39,00:23:44,"stand in a lot of rotting flesh to feed. That's a good idea. Yeah, I wanted to move on just quickly"
00:23:44,00:23:51,to things falling from the sky. I found an article from a few years ago and this was a woman who described
00:23:51,00:23:57,"how a mysterious rock fell from the sky onto a derby street, not to passing goose to the ground."
00:23:57,00:24:04,"That is mysterious. You thought it might have been a meteorite or something like that, but Dr. Andrew"
00:24:04,00:24:09,"Johnson, a geologist of the University of Derby, didn't think he was. He thought he was something"
00:24:09,00:24:13,"like a piece of limestone from the peak district and they asked him, yeah, but how come it came from"
00:24:13,00:24:18,"the sky? And he said, I haven't got a clue where it came from unless somebody threw it in the air."
00:24:18,00:24:25,"Did you see that story this week? Well, a guy in San Francisco who owned a Chinese restaurant"
00:24:25,00:24:31,who was trying to defrost some meat out on the street. He was caught tenderizing his meat by
00:24:31,00:24:35,bashing it on the pavement and stabbing it. And so they examined the pavement which was covered
00:24:35,00:24:40,in blackened gum cigarette butts and tracked bacteria of all gut-twisting varieties according to
00:24:40,00:24:51,"the article. At least it's tender. Okay, time for a final fact and that is Andrew Hunter Murray."
00:24:51,00:24:56,My fact is that the Victorians invented a coat which doubled up as a boat.
00:24:59,00:25:08,invented by whom by Coots and Boots. There has been a Scottish version of Coots and Boots.
00:25:08,00:25:16,That's amazing. It was designed by a man called Peter Halkett who was a naval officer and he
00:25:16,00:25:22,wanted something which you could go exploring with and take it over frozen terrain but which
00:25:22,00:25:26,would cope in extreme weather and which might get you out of a tight spot. So if the frozen terrain
00:25:26,00:25:31,started melting I guess the idea is it's getting warmer so I don't need my coat anymore. But I do need
00:25:31,00:25:38,"something. Amazing. Well, it was made of rubber and you should look for it online. We should try and"
00:25:38,00:25:43,put up a picture of it. I'll put it on your Twitter. I'll put it on my Twitter which is that it had
00:25:43,00:25:47,"four separate compartments, very sensitively in case one of the got punctured and it took a few"
00:25:47,00:25:54,minutes to inflate and then it can support the weight of eight people. And the designs that he
00:25:54,00:25:59,tested a prototype on the River Thames and he went nine miles on it and some explorers did genuinely
00:25:59,00:26:03,take it with them. So I guess if you're one of the seven people who doesn't have the coat you have
00:26:03,00:26:11,"to not take the piss of the idiot in the huge boat shape. Just in case it floods. Yeah, well it's"
00:26:11,00:26:18,like that bra gas mask that won the ignoble price a few years ago. It's got two cups therefore can
00:26:18,00:26:23,support two people. This is an earlier version of that. I don't think that bra has been made to do.
00:26:23,00:26:28,It's called the wine rack and so far they can carry more than a bottle's worth of wine.
00:26:28,00:26:33,And so it has the double benefit of increasing your cup size. So you pull the wine into it and
00:26:33,00:26:37,you can kind of suck it out. You pull the wine into it. It's got a straw attached. It's made to hold
00:26:37,00:26:42,"the wine. Oh, like one of those cool sports pets that you have it when you watch baseball."
00:26:42,00:26:49,What are those cool spots? Yeah. Dunns wearing one now. He's been wearing one since the first episode.
00:26:49,00:26:54,I'm actually wearing a bra as well. There's another one for men which is the beer belly which is
00:26:54,00:26:59,much less attractive than it can carry a six equivalent of a six pack of beer. Six pack very good.
00:26:59,00:27:03,But then during the night the man gets slimmer and the woman's breast gets smaller so he's
00:27:03,00:27:08,getting more attractive while she's chewing. It shouldn't have been like in his trousers to make his
00:27:08,00:27:10,"bulge look bigger, shouldn't it? Yes. Yeah. The cocktail."
00:27:15,00:27:23,"That movie has an old, different meaning now, doesn't it? Yeah, so this boat is just a co-boat, fantastic"
00:27:23,00:27:30,"invention. Yeah. How would you inflate it? Or is it? I don't know. I think it was, I mean it's quite"
00:27:30,00:27:36,"a big thing. So I presume you wouldn't have to be blowing it up. I think you'd have to pump it up,"
00:27:36,00:27:42,because that'd be amazing at dinner when you take your codal and an eight-seater boat in place around
00:27:42,00:27:49,the table. Just come back to the restaurant cloakroom with your little ticket. Which one is yours?
00:27:49,00:27:56,"Yeah, it's the black one that looks like a boat. Yeah, we've got eight of those. Which one is it?"
00:27:56,00:28:00,You explorers. The last time we're hosting the Royal Geographical Society dinner here.
00:28:00,00:28:07,"Well, the idea of the thing, it came with a walking stick which can fold out into either a paddle"
00:28:08,00:28:13,"or a large umbrella, so you can set sail with the umbrella or row with the paddle. Actually,"
00:28:13,00:28:18,"I read about a really interesting invention from roughly the same period, which was a cane,"
00:28:18,00:28:25,"it was a multipurpose cane, effectively the Swiss Army knife of Canes. It could do a number of"
00:28:25,00:28:33,"things. It could be transformed into a flute, so you can play your cane as a flute. You could catch"
00:28:33,00:28:39,"butterflies with it, so it must have had some sort of net that came out of it. You could measure"
00:28:39,00:28:43,horses with it. That was one of the selling points. I don't know who's measuring horses.
00:28:43,00:28:49,"Measure horses with any cane. This is three canes high. That's true. Well, this had a specific,"
00:28:49,00:28:54,I don't know what it is that you use for. So what was it? What was the measure horses butterfly net?
00:28:54,00:29:00,What's the first one flute? And then it could also be an umbrella. This is my favourite thing in
00:29:00,00:29:05,"the advertising of it. It say that it can be an umbrella. Why an umbrella? Why? Of course,"
00:29:05,00:29:13,to keep you dry. While you smoke your cane pipe. So it was also a pipe. So it's fantastic.
00:29:13,00:29:20,"And another one with more than one use. Albert Pratt invented a thing called a gun helmet,"
00:29:20,00:29:28,which was helmets with a gun on it. You would aid your head while the target fire. And it was
00:29:28,00:29:33,"very good, but the one minor disadvantage during trials was that the recoil broke the wearers neck."
00:29:33,00:29:42,You're telling mystery. How did both armies end up completely away from the target?
00:29:42,00:29:48,"Do you think there's a fault with our gun helmet? No, no, more than there is with our leg grenade."
00:29:48,00:29:54,"There's a really funny footage online, which I think Richard Weisman found first. Oh, it might have"
00:29:54,00:29:58,"been in this really good blog called Brain Pickings, but it's of when they were testing bullets and"
00:29:58,00:30:02,"bulletproof glass. And it's a man and woman testing it. And the man's holding this gun,"
00:30:02,00:30:07,standing about 25 feet from this woman who's just holding this tiny piece of bulletproof glass
00:30:07,00:30:13,in front of her face and letting him shoot her. It's great. And she just kind of rocks back.
00:30:13,00:30:17,"It's like go again, hit me again. It's very terrifying seeing someone being shot at. It's really"
00:30:17,00:30:20,"counterintuitive. Yeah, it's confusing to me why they always put the person behind the bullet"
00:30:20,00:30:26,"proof glass test. Well, if they put in front of it, it's not going to work. It was an ancestor"
00:30:26,00:30:35,"of Anna's who invented the gun helmet. I found a patent in 1890 for a combined stepladder,"
00:30:35,00:30:42,"cot, ironing board and chair. And it was designed, it was invented by one Stephen Fry."
00:30:42,00:30:48,"Oh, really? Yeah. In what? 1890. Wow, prodigious. Maybe that's what he was doing before black"
00:30:48,00:30:56,"added. Yeah. I have one funny thing on coats. Okay. Uh, so Draco who wrote down the first legal code,"
00:30:56,00:30:59,"um, I think it was in the seventh century BC. It's the Conean comes from,"
00:30:59,00:31:05,"where draconian comes from. Um, do you guys know how he died? No. It is written that it was a sign"
00:31:05,00:31:11,"of appreciation if someone was doing a public performance, which he would to, um, in public throw"
00:31:11,00:31:15,"your coat at him as like, hello, I guess that we throw flowers or something at someone now. He's"
00:31:15,00:31:21,"threw your coat at him. And the way he died was one person had a boat, an eight-seater boat,"
00:31:21,00:31:29,crushed Draco. It was basically that the way he died was he suffocated under a huge pile of
00:31:29,00:31:34,"appreciate him. Oh, really? Oh, yeah. Because people actually liked him, didn't they? People liked him,"
00:31:34,00:31:39,"yeah. He despised draconian measures. Oh, my. Why are there no pictures of like people most"
00:31:39,00:31:44,appreciated person of the year? And it's just a picture of coats. You don't see the person is
00:31:44,00:31:48,"the mountain. If that was still true, cloakroom attendance would be the most respect to people in"
00:31:48,00:31:54,"society. That's true. Uh, someone's invented a jacket where you wear it as a normal jacket,"
00:31:54,00:31:59,"but there's an extra arm that hangs out so that your girlfriend can get underneath the arm,"
00:31:59,00:32:04,but you don't need to have your arm over her. So you have two functioning arms and it's a third arm.
00:32:04,00:32:07,But does that knock knock people over in the street when you're just walking in line? When you've
00:32:07,00:32:12,"been dumped. Yeah, that's a sad side of walking home. As you will be five minutes after you say,"
00:32:12,00:32:17,"don't worry, darling, just put this fake arm over yourself and your competitors. I've delegated"
00:32:17,00:32:25,the touching of you to this product I have bought. They've also developed mattresses which have grooves
00:32:25,00:32:31,in them so that you can put your arm underneath rather than get your arm trapped under whoever you're
00:32:31,00:32:36,"in bed with. Because there's always a problem that if you're lying on your side, where do you put"
00:32:36,00:32:41,"your other arm, which is underneath you? Oh, yeah. So it's got an armhole. Okay. The armhole. Yeah,"
00:32:41,00:32:45,"and then you can just put on your same. The armhole is for a girlfriend. Well, as a man, you would lie"
00:32:45,00:32:48,in bed and put your arm in the groove and then your girlfriend would lie on the other side of the bed.
00:32:48,00:32:53,"So you're with you, but James, so that implies a horizontal groove, but then James is way which I"
00:32:53,00:32:57,prefer because I'm not ridden to the whole arms in bed. What's that about? With her boyfriend thing.
00:32:57,00:33:06,I have a fake arm product you might be interested in. I like the idea of someone to put your arm
00:33:06,00:33:10,"on when you're sleeping. That has been invented as well. I think they're two different inventions. Yeah,"
00:33:10,00:33:16,they are. Because someone was plagiarising someone else there. From the people who brought you the
00:33:16,00:33:24,horizontal bed groove. The vertical bed groove. One more thing about inventions. So you know how
00:33:24,00:33:30,car horns are kind of like a heart like quite horrible noises. They used to be much nicer.
00:33:31,00:33:38,And they changed that because one of Edison's assistants had a car and he nearly ran over someone
00:33:38,00:33:45,in Newark and noted that his angel's harp noise of his horn had any impact on the pedestrian.
