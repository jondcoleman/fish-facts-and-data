00:00:04,00:00:07,(upbeat music)
00:00:07,00:00:16,- Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing
00:00:16,00:00:18,"as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you"
00:00:18,00:00:21,from the QI offices in Covenant Garden.
00:00:21,00:00:22,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:22,00:00:24,"I'm sitting here with James Harkin, Andy Murray,"
00:00:24,00:00:25,and Alex Bell.
00:00:25,00:00:27,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:27,00:00:30,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days
00:00:30,00:00:32,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:32,00:00:36,"Starting with my facts, and my fact this week"
00:00:36,00:00:40,"is that according to the diary of the first chief of MI6,"
00:00:40,00:00:42,this is how the first day went.
00:00:42,00:00:44,"Went to the office, saw no one,"
00:00:44,00:00:47,nor was there anything to do there.
00:00:47,00:00:50,- And that was the first day of proper spying in Britain.
00:00:50,00:00:52,"- Yeah, when is that because the spies were so good,"
00:00:52,00:00:53,he couldn't fight.
00:00:53,00:00:54,(laughing)
00:00:54,00:00:58,"- In, there were seven lampstands."
00:00:58,00:01:00,"- So, who was this?"
00:01:00,00:01:01,- Mansfield coming.
00:01:01,00:01:03,He's the founding chief of MI6.
00:01:03,00:01:06,"This was in the year 1909, I believe."
00:01:06,00:01:09,And he's someone we've mentioned very briefly
00:01:09,00:01:11,ages ago on this podcast.
00:01:11,00:01:13,"He's the guy who used to, when he was recruiting people"
00:01:13,00:01:17,"in MI6, would stab a knife into his leg"
00:01:17,00:01:19,in order to see what the reaction of the person
00:01:19,00:01:20,he was interviewing would be.
00:01:20,00:01:22,- You've missed out a very important bit of that segment.
00:01:22,00:01:24,- Which is that he had a wooden leg.
00:01:24,00:01:26,(laughing)
00:01:26,00:01:27,Very good point.
00:01:27,00:01:29,"And it's a trick you really have to get right, isn't it?"
00:01:29,00:01:30,It can't make a mistake.
00:01:30,00:01:32,"- He had a wooden leg because he lost his first leg,"
00:01:32,00:01:34,having stabbed himself so many times.
00:01:34,00:01:35,(laughing)
00:01:35,00:01:38,"- Yeah, he said to have gone,"
00:01:38,00:01:40,'cause it was quite hard to walk around with a wooden leg.
00:01:40,00:01:41,And he wasn't born with it.
00:01:41,00:01:43,"It was later in life, but he used to go around."
00:01:43,00:01:43,- Screw you.
00:01:43,00:01:44,(laughing)
00:01:44,00:01:45,"- Oh, sorry."
00:01:45,00:01:47,(laughing)
00:01:47,00:01:50,- Tragically Pinocchio was born with a wooden everything.
00:01:50,00:01:53,(laughing)
00:01:53,00:01:55,- But he's an amazing character.
00:01:55,00:01:55,- Matt's you're coming.
00:01:55,00:01:59,He's everything that you would hope for in the founder of...
00:01:59,00:02:01,- It's so British eccentricity.
00:02:01,00:02:02,He's like Inspector Clueso.
00:02:02,00:02:03,All the stories you really have.
00:02:03,00:02:05,- Favourite British eccentricity.
00:02:05,00:02:05,Inspector.
00:02:05,00:02:07,(laughing)
00:02:07,00:02:08,"- Oh my god, so eccentric."
00:02:08,00:02:10,He didn't even have British nationality.
00:02:10,00:02:13,(laughing)
00:02:13,00:02:13,- Oh no.
00:02:13,00:02:17,"- Before he joined, he was in boom defense."
00:02:17,00:02:18,"- Yes, yeah."
00:02:18,00:02:21,- Which is defense of the sea.
00:02:21,00:02:23,"The coastline, sort of putting huge piles into the sea."
00:02:23,00:02:26,"- Huge, nets, nets and all sorts of traps"
00:02:26,00:02:29,and spotting devices and things like that.
00:02:29,00:02:32,And the man who was setting up the secret service
00:02:32,00:02:33,"called A.E. Bethel, wrote to him,"
00:02:33,00:02:35,"saying, my dear man, you're coming."
00:02:35,00:02:38,"Boom, defense must be getting a bit stale with you."
00:02:38,00:02:40,You may therefore perhaps like a new billet.
00:02:40,00:02:42,"If so, I have something good I can offer you."
00:02:42,00:02:43,"- What a cool way of saying, do you want to be..."
00:02:43,00:02:44,"- Dot, dot, dot."
00:02:44,00:02:45,- Just by master.
00:02:45,00:02:46,- And he was really reluctant.
00:02:46,00:02:48,- He was living on a narrow boat at the time.
00:02:48,00:02:50,He was coming up to retirement age anyway.
00:02:50,00:02:52,"And he kept sort of going,"
00:02:52,00:02:54,I really like making these boom nets.
00:02:54,00:02:55,(laughing)
00:02:55,00:02:56,"And he just keeps asking,"
00:02:56,00:02:57,"is like, could I do the boom netting thing"
00:02:57,00:03:00,"at the same time, is that a possibility?"
00:03:00,00:03:01,- Do you think that he would spend all his days
00:03:01,00:03:04,"in a my six day dreaming of being not a spy,"
00:03:04,00:03:06,whereas what everyone else would day dream about being a spy?
00:03:06,00:03:07,- Oh right.
00:03:07,00:03:08,- You're dreaming of getting a tap on the shoulder
00:03:08,00:03:10,"and saying, would you like to not be a spy?"
00:03:10,00:03:11,(laughing)
00:03:11,00:03:13,- What's really weird is that he lived on a narrow boat
00:03:13,00:03:14,"before then, he was in the Navy."
00:03:14,00:03:16,And he had to leave because he got really seasick.
00:03:16,00:03:17,But then he went to live on a boat.
00:03:17,00:03:18,"- Oh, right."
00:03:18,00:03:19,- Wow.
00:03:19,00:03:22,"- Not many waves and tides on a canal though, is that right?"
00:03:22,00:03:24,- I'd say even fewer on the land though.
00:03:24,00:03:25,"- That's true, yeah."
00:03:25,00:03:27,"- An interesting thing about spies,"
00:03:27,00:03:28,"in the first correspondence,"
00:03:28,00:03:30,"where they're talking about the spies,"
00:03:30,00:03:32,"they're not referred to by the word spies,"
00:03:32,00:03:34,"they're referred to by the word scallywags,"
00:03:34,00:03:36,because they used to recruit people.
00:03:36,00:03:37,It was different to the romantic notion
00:03:37,00:03:39,we have of this James Bond character.
00:03:39,00:03:42,It was all about any kind of common criminal
00:03:42,00:03:44,that you might be able to find overseas
00:03:44,00:03:46,who'd be up for doing some spying for you.
00:03:46,00:03:49,The word scallywags was used in the war
00:03:49,00:03:53,"to refer to people who would kind of do very, very small things"
00:03:53,00:03:54,"to put off any invaders,"
00:03:54,00:03:58,so like turning signs round or that kind of thing.
00:03:58,00:03:58,- I know something about them.
00:03:58,00:04:00,"I think we did this on the show actually,"
00:04:00,00:04:02,is that private Godfrey from Dad's Army
00:04:02,00:04:05,"was in a group called the Scallywags in the Second World War,"
00:04:05,00:04:07,which was devoted to sabotage
00:04:07,00:04:08,of any potential German invasion.
00:04:08,00:04:10,"And they were given arms,"
00:04:10,00:04:12,"they were given the ingredients to make bombs,"
00:04:12,00:04:14,they were given instructions for how to set up
00:04:14,00:04:16,razor wire tracks across roads.
00:04:16,00:04:17,"It really was pretty unpleasant,"
00:04:17,00:04:18,the stuff that they were prepared to do
00:04:18,00:04:20,in the event of an invasion.
00:04:20,00:04:21,"Yeah, of course."
00:04:21,00:04:23,- So do you guys know about all the other MIs?
00:04:23,00:04:24,"Because they're in 19 of them,"
00:04:24,00:04:25,although they were.
00:04:25,00:04:26,"Yeah, it's amazing."
00:04:26,00:04:28,"Okay, so there was, for example,"
00:04:28,00:04:29,"MI1 was coat and ciphers,"
00:04:29,00:04:30,and that's now GCHQ.
00:04:30,00:04:31,"So some of them still exist,"
00:04:31,00:04:32,but they're under different names.
00:04:32,00:04:35,"They've been subsumed, you know, glazing and stuff like that."
00:04:35,00:04:37,"My favorite ones are MI4,"
00:04:37,00:04:39,"which was the geographical section,"
00:04:39,00:04:41,"so maps, they just dealt with maps."
00:04:41,00:04:43,"MI7, which was press and propaganda,"
00:04:43,00:04:44,which was kind of interesting.
00:04:44,00:04:46,"And MI16, which is scientific intelligence,"
00:04:46,00:04:48,that was formed in 1945.
00:04:48,00:04:50,"During the Scottish independence debate,"
00:04:50,00:04:53,it was revealed that there's still money going into MI16.
00:04:53,00:04:54,So it still exists.
00:04:54,00:04:55,How cool is that?
00:04:55,00:04:56,- But then it is just scientists.
00:04:56,00:04:58,"I reckon you got to a party and go,"
00:04:58,00:05:00,"""Oh, yeah, actually, I work for MI16."""
00:05:00,00:05:03,(laughing)
00:05:03,00:05:04,- There's no MI13 though.
00:05:04,00:05:05,"- There's no, no."
00:05:05,00:05:06,"- No, it's not because it's paddling."
00:05:06,00:05:07,"- Well, I don't know."
00:05:07,00:05:08,There are a couple that never existed.
00:05:08,00:05:09,"So for some reason, I mean,"
00:05:09,00:05:12,"MI8 was only used in fiction, apparently."
00:05:12,00:05:14,But then why would you not just use all the numbers?
00:05:14,00:05:15,It's really odd that they missed out a couple.
00:05:15,00:05:16,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:05:16,00:05:19,"- So the correct name for MI6 is the SIS,"
00:05:19,00:05:21,which is a secret intelligence service.
00:05:21,00:05:22,- Yes.
00:05:22,00:05:26,- It was originally known as a secret service bureau.
00:05:26,00:05:29,"And that was known as either the SS bureau,"
00:05:29,00:05:31,or sometimes just the SS.
00:05:31,00:05:34,"- Ooh, it's done in a fashion now."
00:05:34,00:05:35,- Do you want to know something else
00:05:35,00:05:37,that's really cool about Mansfield coming?
00:05:37,00:05:39,- I think that he invented the method
00:05:39,00:05:41,"of spies driving up to someone and saying, ""Get in."""
00:05:41,00:05:43,"- So before that, people would just stand there"
00:05:43,00:05:46,"when the car got there and go, ""Well, what do you want me to do?"""
00:05:46,00:05:47,- I don't know.
00:05:47,00:05:50,"- So basically, he would drive to meet people, right?"
00:05:50,00:05:51,But he thought that they would have associates
00:05:51,00:05:53,who would be waiting to photograph you
00:05:53,00:05:54,"or that they would be waiting to, you know,"
00:05:54,00:05:55,cost you or whatever.
00:05:55,00:05:59,"So he said, ""Drive past the rendezvous on the opposite side,"
00:05:59,00:06:01,"and once you've spotted the target, and I'm quoting here,"
00:06:01,00:06:04,"drive up close to him, open the door, and invite him in."
00:06:04,00:06:05,"I lean back the moment I've caught his eye,"
00:06:05,00:06:08,"and from then on, I do not show myself at all."""
00:06:08,00:06:11,- This is another bit from his diary.
00:06:11,00:06:14,- Surely we cannot be expected to sit in the office month
00:06:14,00:06:16,by month doing absolutely nothing.
00:06:16,00:06:17,There was just nothing to do.
00:06:17,00:06:21,"And then on the 14th and 15th of October,"
00:06:21,00:06:25,"his diary then again reads, ""Office all day, no one appeared."""
00:06:25,00:06:28,- I heard it was just an office rented in the name
00:06:28,00:06:30,of a private detective called Mr. Drew.
00:06:30,00:06:31,- Yes.
00:06:31,00:06:31,- Victorious Dread.
00:06:31,00:06:32,"- And then the next office as well,"
00:06:32,00:06:36,or one of the later offices was under another pseudonym.
00:06:36,00:06:39,- There was one that was 54 Broadway.
00:06:39,00:06:42,They had that between 1926 and 1964.
00:06:42,00:06:43,"But the sign outside said,"
00:06:43,00:06:46,"""It was the Mini-Max Fire Extinguisher Company."""
00:06:46,00:06:47,- Wow.
00:06:47,00:06:49,- And that was actually MI6.
00:06:49,00:06:53,"And when they eventually sold that property to buy a new one,"
00:06:53,00:06:55,they realized that people were coming round to view it.
00:06:55,00:06:57,And one of the people who came to view
00:06:57,00:06:59,was a Russian trade delegation.
00:06:59,00:07:00,(laughing)
00:07:00,00:07:00,- They had to quickly go around
00:07:00,00:07:03,"and take all the maps off the walls, yeah."
00:07:03,00:07:05,- That was amazing.
00:07:05,00:07:08,There's also a very another exciting character
00:07:08,00:07:10,"who was recruited by Mansfield Cumming,"
00:07:10,00:07:12,which was a man called Thomas Merton.
00:07:12,00:07:14,He was the original cue.
00:07:14,00:07:16,He was the gadget man.
00:07:16,00:07:19,"Yeah, he worked out how they could create an invisible ink"
00:07:19,00:07:21,"for writing, because up until then,"
00:07:21,00:07:23,"they'd been experimenting with using semen,"
00:07:23,00:07:25,"which I think is quite well known, right?"
00:07:25,00:07:26,"- Yeah, Mansfield Cumming said"
00:07:26,00:07:29,that he thought the best invisible ink was semen.
00:07:29,00:07:30,- Yeah.
00:07:30,00:07:31,- The advantage of using bodily fluids
00:07:31,00:07:33,"is that if you were found in possession of them,"
00:07:33,00:07:35,they weren't incriminating.
00:07:35,00:07:37,"- If you're in a bottle, I think it's more incriminating."
00:07:37,00:07:42,"- No, the idea is that spies had been convicted"
00:07:42,00:07:45,and sentenced to death because they'd been found
00:07:45,00:07:47,"with lemon juice and stuff like that,"
00:07:47,00:07:49,"'cause they say, ""Why would you have lemon juice on you?"""
00:07:49,00:07:51,- I think why do you have semen on you?
00:07:51,00:07:53,"It's still a good question for us, it's not one."
00:07:53,00:07:54,(laughing)
00:07:54,00:07:56,- Is this anything to do with Cumming?
00:07:56,00:07:57,(laughing)
00:07:57,00:07:58,- That's amazing.
00:07:58,00:08:02,- The agent who discovered that you can use semen
00:08:02,00:08:04,as invisible ink apparently had to transfer
00:08:04,00:08:06,to another department after he was teased
00:08:06,00:08:08,so much by other staff members.
00:08:08,00:08:10,(laughing)
00:08:10,00:08:11,"So bad, that's it."
00:08:11,00:08:15,And apparently there was one officer in Copenhagen
00:08:15,00:08:16,who took the discovery so seriously
00:08:16,00:08:21,that he stocked a whole load of invisible ink in his office
00:08:21,00:08:25,"and it began to smell so badly that other agent said to him,"
00:08:25,00:08:27,"""You should use fresh every time you want to write a letter"
00:08:27,00:08:29,"""and rather than saving it."""
00:08:29,00:08:30,- Oh my God.
00:08:30,00:08:31,You have to really take someone aside
00:08:31,00:08:35,"to acquire one of the rooms, tell them that then."
00:08:35,00:08:38,- So I'm surprised that in all the stuff
00:08:38,00:08:39,"that I read of Mansfield coming,"
00:08:39,00:08:41,"I've only read this in one spot probably,"
00:08:41,00:08:46,but Rasputin's death was off the back of Mansfield coming.
00:08:46,00:08:47,- Supposedly.
00:08:47,00:08:50,"- Yeah, I think the word British might have evolved"
00:08:50,00:08:52,somehow in his death definitely.
00:08:52,00:08:55,They poisoned him and he sort of ate all the poison
00:08:55,00:08:56,and then he laughed and he had it having a great time
00:08:56,00:08:58,and then they beat him up and then they shot him
00:08:58,00:08:59,a couple of times.
00:08:59,00:09:00,He still didn't die.
00:09:00,00:09:03,- I think I read was they smashed his testicles flat.
00:09:03,00:09:05,- Terrible.
00:09:05,00:09:07,- You won't be writing any more invisible ink letters
00:09:07,00:09:09,"off of this, will you?"
00:09:09,00:09:10,(laughing)
00:09:10,00:09:13,(upbeat music)
00:09:13,00:09:17,"- Okay, time for fact number two and that is James."
00:09:17,00:09:20,"- Okay, my fact this week is that there is a distillery"
00:09:20,00:09:23,in Kentucky that claims that playing Bruce Springsteen
00:09:23,00:09:26,to the whiskey improves the aging process.
00:09:26,00:09:29,- Is that because of Bruce Springsteen going through
00:09:29,00:09:32,the aging process himself and he knows what it's like?
00:09:32,00:09:33,- Therefore he can teach the whiskey.
00:09:33,00:09:35,"- It'd be nice to be that but no, sadly not."
00:09:35,00:09:38,It is the vibrations they think.
00:09:38,00:09:40,- But specifically Bruce Springsteen.
00:09:40,00:09:44,"- No, it's just any old music but I think being in Kentucky"
00:09:44,00:09:46,that's just the kind of rock they like.
00:09:46,00:09:48,"- Plus it being dad rock, it just naturally ages"
00:09:48,00:09:49,anything that listens to it.
00:09:49,00:09:52,(laughing)
00:09:52,00:09:55,- So this will be Bobham because it's in Kentucky
00:09:55,00:09:57,"but when you make any kind of whiskey like this,"
00:09:57,00:10:00,the way that ages is they put it in barrels
00:10:00,00:10:03,and then the liquor inside the barrel will go
00:10:03,00:10:05,in and out of the pores of the wood
00:10:05,00:10:07,and that will give it it's kind of woody taste
00:10:07,00:10:09,and it will age it in that way.
00:10:09,00:10:11,"And they think that by bracing it,"
00:10:11,00:10:13,it will slosh the liquid around a bit more
00:10:13,00:10:15,which will make it age quicker.
00:10:15,00:10:18,It seems like it probably does work to a certain extent.
00:10:18,00:10:20,- It's really cool the way that whiskey distilleries
00:10:20,00:10:22,make drinks that might not actually hit the market
00:10:22,00:10:25,until after the founders are either retired or dead.
00:10:25,00:10:28,So there are 70 year old whiskeys which go on sale.
00:10:28,00:10:32,"- Yeah, and this is something that they made 70 years ago."
00:10:32,00:10:33,What was that?
00:10:33,00:10:36,70 years ago from now that's 1945.
00:10:36,00:10:38,Why don't know how much whiskey they were making in 1945
00:10:38,00:10:41,"and other things of the mind, but yeah, it's just incredible."
00:10:41,00:10:43,"- Yeah, it's really interesting as well"
00:10:43,00:10:45,the relationship between the whiskey and the barrel
00:10:45,00:10:48,"because obviously the, like you say,"
00:10:48,00:10:50,the essence of the barrel goes into the whiskey
00:10:50,00:10:51,but it happens all the way around as well.
00:10:51,00:10:54,So the barrels in which Jack Daniel's Tennessee whiskey
00:10:54,00:10:58,is aged are reused afterwards to age to basco sauce.
00:10:58,00:11:00,- I think they also sell the barrels
00:11:00,00:11:02,over to scotch companies as well.
00:11:02,00:11:03,"- Yes, I do."
00:11:03,00:11:04,I've been to the Jack Daniel's Distillery.
00:11:04,00:11:05,- How do you do?
00:11:05,00:11:08,- In Tennessee and a fact about it is that it's a dry county.
00:11:08,00:11:11,You're not allowed to buy alcohol there.
00:11:11,00:11:12,- Wow.
00:11:12,00:11:14,- There's a special sort of dispensation.
00:11:14,00:11:16,"So you can, I think you can buy a souvenir bottle"
00:11:16,00:11:18,but you're not allowed to actually drink it
00:11:18,00:11:21,until you're over the border out of that particular county.
00:11:21,00:11:24,"- Yeah, it's amazing the relationship of music"
00:11:24,00:11:27,"and alcohol so there was a report done,"
00:11:27,00:11:29,a research report by guy called Professor North
00:11:29,00:11:31,who found that people were five times more likely
00:11:31,00:11:33,to buy French wine than German wine
00:11:33,00:11:35,if a accordion music was playing in the background.
00:11:35,00:11:36,- What?
00:11:36,00:11:37,- Yeah.
00:11:37,00:11:38,- What about if there was umpah music?
00:11:38,00:11:39,- Umpah.
00:11:39,00:11:40,- No way.
00:11:40,00:11:42,- Umpah band was played the German product
00:11:42,00:11:44,outsold the French by two to one.
00:11:44,00:11:44,- With two to one?
00:11:44,00:11:47,- I can't believe that the effect is substantial.
00:11:47,00:11:49,- People are so impressionable.
00:11:49,00:11:51,- There was a study done quite recently
00:11:51,00:11:55,about the best environment to drink whiskey.
00:11:55,00:11:57,They had people drinking it in a...
00:11:57,00:11:58,"- Oh, it's on your own, isn't it?"
00:11:58,00:12:00,(laughing)
00:12:00,00:12:02,"It's um, you just stare at the wall."
00:12:02,00:12:03,"- Yeah, and you're on the pants."
00:12:03,00:12:06,(laughing)
00:12:06,00:12:08,- Sorry.
00:12:08,00:12:11,- They had a grassy room with a turf floor
00:12:11,00:12:13,and the bar in the sheep
00:12:13,00:12:14,and the smell of freshly cut grass.
00:12:14,00:12:15,- Just do it outside.
00:12:15,00:12:17,(laughing)
00:12:17,00:12:18,"- Oh, that's the best new room."
00:12:18,00:12:20,"Unfortunately, there's no other room in existence"
00:12:20,00:12:21,than anyone can drink that in.
00:12:21,00:12:22,(laughing)
00:12:22,00:12:23,- That's one.
00:12:23,00:12:25,"The other one is a sweet room,"
00:12:25,00:12:27,"which was filled with a sweet fragrance,"
00:12:27,00:12:28,"rounded red objects,"
00:12:28,00:12:30,and a high-pitched tinkling sound.
00:12:30,00:12:31,(laughing)
00:12:31,00:12:33,And then the last one was a woody room
00:12:33,00:12:35,with wood paneling and floorboards.
00:12:35,00:12:38,The sounds of leaves crunching and log fires
00:12:38,00:12:39,and the smell of cedar wood.
00:12:39,00:12:41,And the wooden one was by far
00:12:41,00:12:44,what people enjoyed the most in the wooden room.
00:12:44,00:12:44,- Wow.
00:12:44,00:12:45,The woody room.
00:12:45,00:12:46,"- The woody room, yeah."
00:12:46,00:12:47,- Cool.
00:12:47,00:12:49,"- Um, this, you know, this report I was just talking"
00:12:49,00:12:52,about different tastes of wine and match to music.
00:12:52,00:12:55,They actually released a playlist of the types of music
00:12:55,00:12:57,you should listen to to the different wines.
00:12:57,00:12:59,So when you're drinking a Marlowe.
00:12:59,00:13:01,"- Oh, by my side."
00:13:01,00:13:03,(laughing)
00:13:03,00:13:05,"- Just, I'll repeat five hundred times."
00:13:05,00:13:08,(laughing)
00:13:08,00:13:09,"- If you're drinking a Marlowe,"
00:13:09,00:13:11,sitting on the dock of the bay by Otis Redding.
00:13:11,00:13:12,- Okay.
00:13:12,00:13:14,- Easy by Lionel Richey.
00:13:14,00:13:15,- Over the rainbow by Eva Cassidy.
00:13:15,00:13:17,- None of those are French songs.
00:13:17,00:13:20,"- No, these are, this was the French"
00:13:20,00:13:24,and German wine tasting was about what you buy
00:13:24,00:13:25,in a supermarket.
00:13:25,00:13:27,This is about how it actually tastes better.
00:13:27,00:13:30,"- I understand, but how does it affect the taste?"
00:13:30,00:13:33,"- Okay, so what he says is that they did a study"
00:13:33,00:13:36,with over 250 university students.
00:13:36,00:13:37,They played them various different bits of music
00:13:37,00:13:40,and they all reported back that a certain type of music
00:13:40,00:13:43,absolutely tasted way better than if they heard it
00:13:43,00:13:44,with more wine.
00:13:44,00:13:46,- I can imagine if you have kind of a more smooth tasting wine
00:13:46,00:13:48,than you want more smooth kind of music.
00:13:48,00:13:49,- Yeah.
00:13:49,00:13:50,- That kind of makes sense.
00:13:50,00:13:52,- I can imagine students just trying to find some correlation
00:13:52,00:13:54,to play on so that they just get given more free wine.
00:13:54,00:13:56,(laughing)
00:13:56,00:13:56,- I'm gonna need to hear another one of them.
00:13:56,00:13:57,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:13:57,00:13:59,- Let's try it again.
00:13:59,00:14:00,- I think I'm sporting a pattern.
00:14:00,00:14:01,"I think we should continue, guys."
00:14:01,00:14:04,- Chardonnay had what's love got to do with it.
00:14:04,00:14:06,"Tina Turner, spinning around by Kylie Manot"
00:14:06,00:14:08,and rock DJ by Robbie Williams.
00:14:08,00:14:11,That's what Chardonnay tastes best with.
00:14:11,00:14:14,"This research, by the way, was carried out by a wine maker"
00:14:14,00:14:19,from Chile who himself plays monastic chance
00:14:19,00:14:21,to his maturing wines.
00:14:21,00:14:22,- Does he?
00:14:22,00:14:23,"- Yeah, okay."
00:14:23,00:14:25,"- So that's his choice, no spring steam."
00:14:25,00:14:27,"- Okay, so there was a whiskey,"
00:14:27,00:14:28,"Bob and whiskey in America,"
00:14:28,00:14:32,where the warehouse where it was held was hit by a tornado.
00:14:32,00:14:33,And basically the whole of the house
00:14:33,00:14:35,was almost ripped to smithereens.
00:14:35,00:14:37,"But the barrels were kind of left,"
00:14:37,00:14:38,more or less where they were.
00:14:38,00:14:40,"Apparently when they tried the whiskey,"
00:14:40,00:14:42,it was absolutely amazing.
00:14:42,00:14:44,And it's called tornado surviving whiskey.
00:14:44,00:14:47,"And it's superior to the usual product, they say."
00:14:47,00:14:50,- I would say that too if I had an enormous bill of damage
00:14:50,00:14:51,to read that.
00:14:51,00:14:55,This whiskey is suddenly quadrupled in value.
00:14:55,00:14:56,"Wow, oh god."
00:14:56,00:14:58,"Well, I mean, that's something, I suppose."
00:14:58,00:14:59,- Yeah.
00:14:59,00:15:03,And there's another company called Ocean Aged Bourbon
00:15:03,00:15:04,who take their whiskey
00:15:04,00:15:08,"and then put it on a boat, send it out to sea for four years"
00:15:08,00:15:10,"and when it comes back, apparently it tastes not better."
00:15:10,00:15:12,- I think this is all nonsense.
00:15:12,00:15:15,"- I know it sounds like it sounds like it's not true,"
00:15:15,00:15:16,but there is a little bit of science behind it.
00:15:16,00:15:18,"The more that it kind of slushes against the word,"
00:15:18,00:15:20,the more it will react to it.
00:15:20,00:15:21,They really do believe it.
00:15:21,00:15:23,Like the whiskey maker's really believe it.
00:15:23,00:15:25,"- If you go on the internet,"
00:15:25,00:15:28,you can find a nice advert for whiskey toothpaste.
00:15:28,00:15:29,- Wow.
00:15:29,00:15:30,"- Don't even know if it's real,"
00:15:30,00:15:31,but the advert seems to be there.
00:15:31,00:15:35,"It's 6% proof, scotch bourbon whiskey."
00:15:35,00:15:36,"And the advert says,"
00:15:36,00:15:38,"""Why fight oral hygiene?"""
00:15:38,00:15:39,Enjoy it.
00:15:39,00:15:41,Here's real he-man toothpaste.
00:15:41,00:15:45,Best argument yet for brushing three times a day.
00:15:45,00:15:46,- It's also a fantastic excuse
00:15:46,00:15:48,"for turning up at work, smelling of whiskey."
00:15:48,00:15:49,(laughing)
00:15:49,00:15:51,"- No, no, no, that's my good taste."
00:15:51,00:15:54,(upbeat music)
00:15:54,00:15:58,"- Okay, time for fact number three and that is Alex Bell."
00:15:58,00:16:00,"- Okay, my fact is that there is a statue"
00:16:00,00:16:02,of Nicola Tesla in Silicon Valley
00:16:02,00:16:05,that radiates free Wi-Fi.
00:16:05,00:16:05,- Cool.
00:16:05,00:16:06,"- It's cool, isn't it?"
00:16:06,00:16:07,- That is what he would have wanted.
00:16:07,00:16:08,"- It is, yeah."
00:16:08,00:16:11,- It's him holding a sort of giant wireless light bulb
00:16:11,00:16:13,and the light bulb sort of goes off Wi-Fi.
00:16:13,00:16:14,- As a kickstarter project.
00:16:14,00:16:15,- I've seen the drawings of it.
00:16:15,00:16:16,"I have to say in the drawings,"
00:16:16,00:16:18,they don't quite get the light bulb right in his hand.
00:16:18,00:16:20,It looks like a big ping pong bag.
00:16:20,00:16:21,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:16:21,00:16:22,- It does look a bit weird.
00:16:22,00:16:23,"- Yeah, and it's like, yeah,"
00:16:23,00:16:25,"it's quite an odd thing for him to be holding as well,"
00:16:25,00:16:27,but we should say who Tesla was.
00:16:27,00:16:28,- Yeah.
00:16:28,00:16:31,- He was known as the man who invented the 20th century.
00:16:31,00:16:32,- Yeah.
00:16:32,00:16:32,- As in before Tesla.
00:16:32,00:16:34,- It was the 19th century.
00:16:34,00:16:35,(laughing)
00:16:35,00:16:37,- He was born on the first century in 1900.
00:16:37,00:16:39,He was born 1856.
00:16:39,00:16:40,- Okay.
00:16:40,00:16:43,"- He was born into a lightning storm, a fierce lightning storm,"
00:16:43,00:16:45,"according to this, his family legend,"
00:16:45,00:16:47,"and midway through the birth, the midwife said"
00:16:47,00:16:50,that the lightning was a bad omen.
00:16:50,00:16:51,And she said that he'll be a child of darkness.
00:16:51,00:16:54,"And the mother said, no, he will be a child of light."
00:16:54,00:16:57,That definitely sounds like a driving ride thing there.
00:16:57,00:17:00,"And so Tesla was this fantastic scientist,"
00:17:00,00:17:02,"very, very eccentric man."
00:17:02,00:17:04,We talked about him a bit on the podcast and QI.
00:17:04,00:17:07,"He was, he invented, among other things,"
00:17:07,00:17:10,we talked about the death rate he invented on the podcast.
00:17:10,00:17:12,"- The main thing he invented was the AC polyphase system,"
00:17:12,00:17:15,"which does not sound sexy, but it was unbelievable."
00:17:15,00:17:17,"So before Tesla, you could pump up,"
00:17:17,00:17:20,you could transport electricity one mile before Tesla.
00:17:20,00:17:21,And even then you could only use it
00:17:21,00:17:24,for lighting up light bulbs and things.
00:17:24,00:17:27,"Thanks to his system, you can transmit it hundreds of miles"
00:17:27,00:17:29,and use it for industrial machinery.
00:17:29,00:17:32,"I mean, it made electricity into a viable technology"
00:17:32,00:17:33,which could span the world.
00:17:33,00:17:35,"- I run it that he's now a wife, I think,"
00:17:35,00:17:37,that probably goes about two meters.
00:17:37,00:17:39,(laughing)
00:17:39,00:17:40,- Yeah.
00:17:40,00:17:42,"He was a big whiskey-efficient, I don't actually think."
00:17:42,00:17:43,- What's he talking whiskey?
00:17:43,00:17:44,"Yeah, he drank it every day"
00:17:44,00:17:46,and he thought that he would live to 150
00:17:46,00:17:47,by drinking it.
00:17:47,00:17:47,"- Well, try."
00:17:47,00:17:48,- Prohibition came along
00:17:48,00:17:51,"and he was not a fan of Prohibition at all because of this,"
00:17:51,00:17:52,but he went along with it anyway
00:17:52,00:17:55,and decided that he was now only going to live to 130
00:17:55,00:17:57,because he was no longer drinking whiskey.
00:17:57,00:17:59,"He lived to 86, I think, yeah."
00:17:59,00:18:00,- That's pretty good.
00:18:00,00:18:01,- Pretty good.
00:18:01,00:18:02,"- Yeah, but he's a long way off his prediction, isn't he?"
00:18:02,00:18:03,"- Yeah, that's true."
00:18:03,00:18:05,"- Well, Prohibition, he probably couldn't factor"
00:18:05,00:18:07,in how many years has that actually happened?
00:18:07,00:18:09,"- The last mathematician, I think it was Cardano,"
00:18:09,00:18:10,"but it might not have been him,"
00:18:10,00:18:12,but it was one of the people around
00:18:12,00:18:14,at the same time as him around the Renaissance.
00:18:14,00:18:18,That predicted exactly the day he was going to die
00:18:18,00:18:20,and told everyone this was the day he was going to die
00:18:20,00:18:21,and he was exactly right.
00:18:21,00:18:23,But a lot of people think he probably killed himself.
00:18:23,00:18:24,- To prove himself right.
00:18:24,00:18:26,"- Ah, yeah."
00:18:26,00:18:27,- I was looking at some other statues as well.
00:18:27,00:18:28,- Oh yeah.
00:18:28,00:18:31,- The statue of Winston Churchill in Parliament Square.
00:18:31,00:18:34,There's a myth that it's electrified
00:18:34,00:18:36,"to say that Pigeon's no one around on it,"
00:18:36,00:18:38,but I looked it up and I found a new scientist article
00:18:38,00:18:41,"that says that they thought about it, they didn't do it."
00:18:41,00:18:44,"- Yeah, they also thought about inserting pins"
00:18:44,00:18:47,that would stand out at the top of his head
00:18:47,00:18:48,intending to stop the birds as well.
00:18:48,00:18:50,- So that's the standard way of stopping Pigeon?
00:18:50,00:18:51,"- Yeah, but they just thought that would look really weird,"
00:18:51,00:18:52,like he had a punk hairdo.
00:18:52,00:18:53,- Yeah.
00:18:53,00:18:54,- So also the top of his head.
00:18:54,00:18:56,"- It's really subtle, though the risk you'll just end up"
00:18:56,00:18:57,with a dead Pigeon.
00:18:57,00:18:58,"- That's right, yeah."
00:18:58,00:18:59,"- Yeah, with Winston Churchill's head."
00:18:59,00:19:03,- But also the location of where the statue stands
00:19:03,00:19:06,is located in a spot that in the '50s
00:19:06,00:19:08,used to be referred to by Churchill
00:19:08,00:19:11,as where my statue will go in the exact spot.
00:19:11,00:19:12,- Really?
00:19:12,00:19:12,"- Yeah, so that's he would constantly say that"
00:19:12,00:19:13,if ever they passed.
00:19:13,00:19:15,He would say that's where my statue will go.
00:19:15,00:19:17,And that's where it did.
00:19:17,00:19:18,"- He was successful in his life,"
00:19:18,00:19:21,"but I mean, that's quite a presumption to make for anyone."
00:19:21,00:19:21,"- Yeah, I don't know."
00:19:21,00:19:23,"- Just to walk you the park, loudly proclaiming,"
00:19:23,00:19:24,that's where my statue will go.
00:19:24,00:19:26,"- Well, as long as you don't say it everywhere you go"
00:19:26,00:19:28,and you help to win the Second World War.
00:19:28,00:19:29,"- Yeah, I don't know."
00:19:29,00:19:30,I'd be inclined to give him a statue.
00:19:30,00:19:30,"- Well, towards the end there,"
00:19:30,00:19:33,he got voted out and people weren't particularly happy with it.
00:19:33,00:19:34,- He got voted out immediately afterwards.
00:19:34,00:19:36,"- Yeah, he got voted back in."
00:19:36,00:19:36,- At the age of 80.
00:19:36,00:19:37,- He was elected prime minister.
00:19:37,00:19:39,"- Yeah, amazing."
00:19:39,00:19:43,- There's a mysterious statue in Budapest of Colombo.
00:19:43,00:19:46,"- I'm Detective Peter Falk, yeah."
00:19:46,00:19:48,- Not the guy who discovered the clitoris.
00:19:48,00:19:51,"- No, that's a call back."
00:19:51,00:19:54,- That's a call back to an episode between 1555
00:19:54,00:19:56,that anyone wants to have a listen.
00:19:56,00:19:59,"Yeah, there's a slightly mysterious Peter Falk statue"
00:19:59,00:20:02,sitting in a street in Budapest.
00:20:02,00:20:04,No one's quite sure why it's there.
00:20:04,00:20:06,It was built about three years after his death.
00:20:06,00:20:07,It just suddenly was there.
00:20:07,00:20:09,They think it was a hungarian politician.
00:20:09,00:20:10,- Do you think maybe you went there
00:20:10,00:20:11,on holiday once and when?
00:20:11,00:20:13,That's where my statue's gonna go.
00:20:13,00:20:14,(laughing)
00:20:14,00:20:15,"- Yes, exactly."
00:20:15,00:20:18,"- So he did, he's known to have had hungarian roots"
00:20:18,00:20:20,through his grandparents side.
00:20:20,00:20:22,"But yeah, there's no actual link."
00:20:22,00:20:24,No one's quite sure why it's there.
00:20:24,00:20:26,- There's the world's smallest sculpture
00:20:26,00:20:27,by a guy called John T. Hurwitz.
00:20:27,00:20:29,It was unveiled earlier this year
00:20:29,00:20:30,"and it was almost, it was less than,"
00:20:30,00:20:32,it was less than one millimeter tall
00:20:32,00:20:34,and was almost immediately destroyed
00:20:34,00:20:35,when the photographer accidentally crushed it
00:20:35,00:20:36,with his finger.
00:20:36,00:20:38,"- No, yeah, really."
00:20:38,00:20:42,It was being photographed standing inside the eye of a needle.
00:20:42,00:20:44,- There was a museum in Bath called the Impossible Micro World
00:20:44,00:20:47,which was the most fantastic museum and it closed down.
00:20:47,00:20:49,"But it's amazing, this amazing guy called Willard Wicken"
00:20:49,00:20:50,who makes these things.
00:20:50,00:20:54,And he's done so as a sculpture of a horse dancing
00:20:54,00:20:56,on the head of an actual ant.
00:20:56,00:20:57,- Wow.
00:20:57,00:20:58,"- All the exhibits in the museum,"
00:20:58,00:20:59,you had to go through.
00:20:59,00:20:59,I went when I was a--
00:20:59,00:21:00,- The museum normal size.
00:21:00,00:21:03,"So I was going to, it wasn't closed down"
00:21:03,00:21:06,when someone accidentally stood down and got something.
00:21:06,00:21:09,"- Every exhibit you had to look at through a magnifier,"
00:21:09,00:21:10,basically.
00:21:10,00:21:11,- Wow.
00:21:11,00:21:14,"- And this guy, he has to slow down his heartbeat"
00:21:14,00:21:17,in order to make the cuts necessary
00:21:17,00:21:18,on the thing he's sculpting.
00:21:18,00:21:21,"So he slows it right down, look through the binoculars"
00:21:21,00:21:22,"or the magnifier or the microscope,"
00:21:22,00:21:25,"whatever he's using, waits for a heartbeat,"
00:21:25,00:21:26,"makes the cut on the thing,"
00:21:26,00:21:28,then the next heartbeat happens.
00:21:28,00:21:30,- It's just incredible that his hands were so unshaky
00:21:30,00:21:32,that his heartbeat could have affected how shaky they were.
00:21:32,00:21:34,"I mean, if I try to do something,"
00:21:34,00:21:36,my hands are way shaky than what is being affected
00:21:36,00:21:37,by my heartbeat.
00:21:37,00:21:38,"- Yes, but you drink very heavy, too."
00:21:38,00:21:40,"- I don't know if it's whiskey, yeah."
00:21:40,00:21:42,- Do you want to hear some facts about Wi-Fi?
00:21:42,00:21:43,"- Yes, please Andy."
00:21:43,00:21:44,- Okay.
00:21:44,00:21:46,"- So, this is cool."
00:21:46,00:21:49,"There's an Israeli theme park called Ka-Dem, right?"
00:21:49,00:21:51,And it's a traditional theme park
00:21:51,00:21:53,for people who want to experience life
00:21:53,00:21:55,"as it was in Galilee 2000 years ago, right?"
00:21:55,00:21:57,"If people get bored, I presume,"
00:21:57,00:21:59,or want to check their phones.
00:21:59,00:22:02,They have donkeys walking around with Wi-Fi hotspots on them.
00:22:02,00:22:03,"- Oh, wow."
00:22:03,00:22:04,"- But the thing is they have 30 donkeys,"
00:22:04,00:22:06,and only five of the donkeys are actually carrying Wi-Fi hotspots.
00:22:06,00:22:10,So there's only one in six chunks that you're donkey.
00:22:10,00:22:11,- Do you spend ages trying to connect to that one?
00:22:11,00:22:13,"- So you run a donkey and then you say,"
00:22:13,00:22:16,"""No, not this one, they've got another donkey."""
00:22:16,00:22:17,- How to imagine anyone getting bored
00:22:17,00:22:21,at a theme park which recreates 2000 years old Israel?
00:22:21,00:22:23,It's just really difficult.
00:22:23,00:22:26,"When you were talking about running around finding donkeys,"
00:22:26,00:22:28,this just reminded me of something that Alex told us
00:22:28,00:22:31,just before we walked in about the...
00:22:31,00:22:35,Is like a children's playground following you around?
00:22:35,00:22:37,"- Oh yeah, I just saw this video on BBC News."
00:22:37,00:22:40,"Some of you know, these random science products"
00:22:40,00:22:42,they get made for seemingly no reason.
00:22:42,00:22:45,A guy has created a climbing frame
00:22:45,00:22:47,"that wonders around parks,"
00:22:47,00:22:48,looking for children to play on it.
00:22:48,00:22:51,But it just sounds like the most ridiculous
00:22:51,00:22:53,and also predatory thing.
00:22:53,00:22:54,"- Well, they've done it to say,"
00:22:54,00:22:57,"""I've spliced the jeans of a climbing frame and a pedophile."""
00:22:57,00:23:00,(laughing)
00:23:00,00:23:01,- It's absolutely horrendous.
00:23:01,00:23:02,The idea is going to get children used
00:23:02,00:23:04,to the idea of robotics in real life.
00:23:04,00:23:06,- Does it move if you're climbing on it?
00:23:06,00:23:06,Or does it stop?
00:23:06,00:23:09,"- I don't know, I mean, it sounds incredibly dangerous."
00:23:09,00:23:11,"- It doesn't matter, it's an academic question"
00:23:11,00:23:13,because no child will ever climb on this thing.
00:23:13,00:23:15,- I don't think they have any choice.
00:23:15,00:23:17,"- I mean, I should say, it's very slow."
00:23:17,00:23:19,It doesn't like gallop around or anything like that.
00:23:19,00:23:22,- Can I talk about the sort of invention of a Wi-Fi for seconds?
00:23:22,00:23:24,"- I want to show around to ages, and I'm going to have a chance."
00:23:24,00:23:26,"Okay, you can't say this at home,"
00:23:26,00:23:27,but there are slides coming out.
00:23:27,00:23:30,(all laughing)
00:23:30,00:23:31,"- Helen Lamar, which is very glamorous films"
00:23:31,00:23:33,"done in America, '30s and '40s."
00:23:33,00:23:36,"She was one time dubbed the world most beautiful woman,"
00:23:36,00:23:38,but she was also this fantastic scientist as well.
00:23:38,00:23:38,"When the war broke out,"
00:23:38,00:23:40,she applied to the National Inventors Guild
00:23:40,00:23:42,but was rejected many because she was a woman
00:23:42,00:23:43,and people didn't take her seriously.
00:23:43,00:23:45,And then she was encouraged to use her celebrity
00:23:45,00:23:47,"and beauty to sell warboms,"
00:23:47,00:23:48,which she did a little bit.
00:23:48,00:23:50,But she got started inventing things herself.
00:23:50,00:23:51,"She got together with her neighbor,"
00:23:51,00:23:54,"who was a composer called George Antile,"
00:23:54,00:23:55,and they built a machine called
00:23:55,00:23:58,a frequency-hopping spread spectrum.
00:23:58,00:23:59,"Basically, the problem with torpedoes at that time"
00:23:59,00:24:01,"was that they were remote controlled,"
00:24:01,00:24:03,so they were kept on causing a radio signal transmitted
00:24:03,00:24:06,"from the ship, but that signal could be easily blocked."
00:24:06,00:24:08,And Lamar and Antile developed this improved system
00:24:08,00:24:11,that allowed a radio signal to jump up and down frequencies
00:24:11,00:24:12,randomly so that it couldn't be jammed.
00:24:12,00:24:14,But what's really brilliant is how they did it.
00:24:14,00:24:16,"You guys know what player pianos are, right?"
00:24:16,00:24:17,They're pianos that play themselves.
00:24:17,00:24:19,"They have this big role of paper music,"
00:24:19,00:24:20,which has lots of holes in.
00:24:20,00:24:22,And they correspond to which notes should play and when.
00:24:22,00:24:24,The frequency-hopping spread spectrum
00:24:24,00:24:25,"used the mechanism from the player piano,"
00:24:25,00:24:28,"but instead of playing 88 keys of the piano,"
00:24:28,00:24:30,it switched the torpedo signal
00:24:30,00:24:31,between 88 radio frequencies.
00:24:31,00:24:34,The principle of modern wireless technology is based on that.
00:24:34,00:24:36,"WiFi, GPS, Bluetooth, everything like that."
00:24:36,00:24:37,"Wow, really amazing."
00:24:37,00:24:38,That's so cool.
00:24:38,00:24:41,"So Sri Lanka, the island of Sri Lanka,"
00:24:41,00:24:44,is about to provide WiFi to the entire island
00:24:44,00:24:47,"using a network of floating balloons,"
00:24:47,00:24:50,which are going to be 12 miles up in the sky
00:24:50,00:24:51,they're all solar powered and the solar power
00:24:51,00:24:53,that the balloons get is going to be used
00:24:53,00:24:56,to transmit internet signals to the spot of land beneath it.
00:24:56,00:24:59,"How insane is that 25,000 square miles?"
00:24:59,00:25:00,That's amazing.
00:25:00,00:25:01,The area of the country.
00:25:01,00:25:04,You know one place that I'm still trying to find this out
00:25:04,00:25:08,for certain and I can't properly find anywhere online yet
00:25:08,00:25:10,that would tell me the right answer.
00:25:10,00:25:14,"But certainly up until 2012, you can't get WiFi in the White House."
00:25:14,00:25:14,Wow.
00:25:14,00:25:16,"Yeah, the White House has no WiFi."
00:25:16,00:25:20,"And like, for example, the Oval Office doesn't have a computer in it."
00:25:20,00:25:22,"And if you want to use a computer in it,"
00:25:22,00:25:24,"you have to bring in a laptop and plug in Clinton,"
00:25:24,00:25:27,famously apparently only sent two emails
00:25:27,00:25:28,during his time as president.
00:25:28,00:25:31,One was as a test.
00:25:31,00:25:32,And then the second one was--
00:25:32,00:25:33,Was the elite everything?
00:25:33,00:25:36,Was the second one too spaced?
00:25:36,00:25:37,"Yes, yes."
00:25:37,00:25:39,"Yeah, it was to John Glenn."
00:25:39,00:25:41,So I don't know if he was in the--
00:25:41,00:25:43,"Yeah, he was in the ISS on the second trip."
00:25:43,00:25:45,"John, you were hearing a lot of crazy stuff about me."
00:25:45,00:25:46,"Yeah, I do."
00:25:46,00:25:48,"I just don't think no, none of it's true."
00:25:48,00:25:51,"Mr. Clinton, we've gone through your entire five million emails"
00:25:51,00:25:53,and we think there's two of them we can save.
00:25:53,00:25:58,Yes.
00:25:58,00:26:00,Good news about the invisible ink you were asking about.
00:26:00,00:26:09,"OK, time for our final factor, the show."
00:26:09,00:26:12,And that is Andrew Hunter Murray.
00:26:12,00:26:15,My fact is that a third of people in Britain have written almost nothing
00:26:15,00:26:17,by hand in the last six months.
00:26:17,00:26:19,"This makes so much sense when you think about it,"
00:26:19,00:26:20,but it sounds crazy when you first--
00:26:20,00:26:21,It sounds terrifying.
00:26:21,00:26:24,"Yeah, so this was a survey, admittedly,"
00:26:24,00:26:27,by a printing and mailing company called DocMail.
00:26:27,00:26:29,But what they said was that one in three people
00:26:29,00:26:31,had not written anything by hand for six months.
00:26:31,00:26:34,"And on average, people hadn't written something for 41 days."
00:26:34,00:26:35,"And I think when they say written anything by hand,"
00:26:35,00:26:38,"I mean, anything that's not a shopping list opposed to those--"
00:26:38,00:26:39,"Oh, signature."
00:26:39,00:26:40,They're signature.
00:26:40,00:26:41,"Yeah, yeah."
00:26:41,00:26:42,"But when you think about it, what is there"
00:26:42,00:26:44,that you need to write at length?
00:26:44,00:26:45,Letters to people.
00:26:45,00:26:49,"Most people don't write many letters these days, if any."
00:26:49,00:26:53,"I presume at school, still, you would be writing all the time."
00:26:53,00:26:55,"Well, one thing about that is, apparently,"
00:26:55,00:26:57,"if you write things down, it helps you remember them."
00:26:57,00:26:58,Yep.
00:26:58,00:26:59,"You know, that makes kind of enthusiasm."
00:26:59,00:27:01,"I do definitely believe that, yeah."
00:27:01,00:27:03,"But actually, there's like a neurological reason for it."
00:27:03,00:27:06,"Like, there are certain neural circuits"
00:27:06,00:27:08,that are activated whenever you write things down.
00:27:08,00:27:11,And so children who write tend to learn more quickly.
00:27:11,00:27:14,And so if you have schools where children aren't really
00:27:14,00:27:17,"writing things down, then it can hamper their improvement."
00:27:17,00:27:18,Right.
00:27:18,00:27:19,Wow.
00:27:19,00:27:22,The other downside that we're sort of going to have in the years
00:27:22,00:27:25,to come is that all these great works of literature
00:27:25,00:27:26,"and everything else, we're not going"
00:27:26,00:27:28,to have the original handwritten notes of people
00:27:28,00:27:30,doing drafts because so much of it now is on computers.
00:27:30,00:27:32,So the American Museum of Natural History
00:27:32,00:27:33,"on their website, I'll tweet a link."
00:27:33,00:27:36,It's if they've got all of Darwin's papers and all his works.
00:27:36,00:27:38,"And it's amazing, because you can see all of his handwriting,"
00:27:38,00:27:39,which is really bad.
00:27:39,00:27:40,And he's got little doodles of drawings.
00:27:40,00:27:43,His kids drew pictures on the back.
00:27:43,00:27:46,There's an amazing one of a fish walking on the land
00:27:46,00:27:48,"holding an umbrella, which I really like."
00:27:48,00:27:51,So they always see subscribed to his theory.
00:27:51,00:27:54,"The opposite of calligraphy is calligraphy, bad handwriting."
00:27:54,00:27:57,"Bad handwriting, that's great calligraphy."
00:27:57,00:27:59,"They reckon that in like a 100 years time,"
00:27:59,00:28:03,"the, in fact, even neatly written hand writing"
00:28:03,00:28:05,will be completely illegible to people.
00:28:05,00:28:08,"Because it's like if you look at very, very old calligraphy,"
00:28:08,00:28:10,now you can't understand any of it.
00:28:10,00:28:11,"Yeah, definitely."
00:28:11,00:28:12,"And then in a 100 years time, it might be only"
00:28:12,00:28:15,that you can recognise time's new role men are.
00:28:15,00:28:17,"Looking at say Jane Austen's letters or something,"
00:28:17,00:28:19,quite actually quite difficult to decipher.
00:28:19,00:28:20,"Yeah, some other words."
00:28:20,00:28:22,The guy who's credited with pretty much single-handedly
00:28:22,00:28:25,reviving modern calligraphy and penmanship
00:28:25,00:28:29,"is Edward Johnston, who also is very, very big in fonts."
00:28:29,00:28:30,Not like font size.
00:28:30,00:28:34,"Yeah, I mean, he creates a Johnston,"
00:28:34,00:28:37,and New Johnston is now the London Underground font.
00:28:37,00:28:39,And he mentored the sculptor Eric Gil.
00:28:39,00:28:42,"He came up with Gil Sans, which is the BBC's official font."
00:28:42,00:28:44,There's two massive institutions.
00:28:44,00:28:47,Here's another incredibly creepy company.
00:28:47,00:28:50,"If we'll just off the back with the playground switch,"
00:28:50,00:28:51,follow it on.
00:28:51,00:28:53,There's a company which has made a robot
00:28:53,00:28:55,to write handwritten letters.
00:28:55,00:28:57,"So basically, you write a lot of handwriting samples"
00:28:57,00:28:59,and then a robot reads your handwriting samples
00:28:59,00:29:02,and can perfectly replicate your handwriting.
00:29:02,00:29:04,And they basically say that they want to retain the delight
00:29:04,00:29:07,of giving and receiving notes without the hassle
00:29:07,00:29:09,"of heading to the stationary store writing out a letter,"
00:29:09,00:29:11,"finding stamps and locating a mailbox,"
00:29:11,00:29:13,which is the whole point of writing a letter to someone
00:29:13,00:29:15,"is that it's a nice thing to do, because it is a bit of trouble."
00:29:15,00:29:17,Have you guys heard of the Muslim?
00:29:17,00:29:19,It's an Urdu language newspaper.
00:29:19,00:29:22,It's probably the world's only remaining newspaper
00:29:22,00:29:23,that's completely handwritten.
00:29:23,00:29:24,Wow.
00:29:24,00:29:26,It's daily newspaper.
00:29:26,00:29:27,It's only about like four pages.
00:29:27,00:29:30,It's four pages long and it takes three hours.
00:29:30,00:29:34,Circulation remains a difficult matter for them.
00:29:34,00:29:36,"Circulation, 22,000 subscribers in 2008."
00:29:36,00:29:39,"But yeah, four pages long, but they leave a blank space"
00:29:39,00:29:40,on the front page in case of any breaking news.
00:29:40,00:29:41,Right.
00:29:41,00:29:44,So there's an editor in America called Horace Greeley
00:29:44,00:29:47,and he wants sent a note to the Iowa Press Association.
00:29:47,00:29:50,"The start of it went, ""I have waited till long awaiting"
00:29:50,00:29:52,"""would be discertious, only to find that I cannot attend"
00:29:52,00:29:56,"""your press meeting next June as I would like to do."""
00:29:56,00:29:59,"But his handwriting was so bad that they thought it said,"
00:29:59,00:30:01,"""I have wondered all along whether any squirt"
00:30:01,00:30:04,"""had denied the scandal about the president meeting Jane"
00:30:04,00:30:06,"""in the woods on Saturday."""
00:30:06,00:30:07,Wow.
00:30:07,00:30:09,"That's pretty bad handwriting, isn't it?"
00:30:09,00:30:11,"The end of this letter went, ""I feel obliged"
00:30:11,00:30:13,"""to decline any invitation that takes me away"
00:30:13,00:30:15,"""a day's journey from home."""
00:30:15,00:30:18,"But they thought it said, ""Any insinuation that brick ovens"
00:30:18,00:30:21,"""are dangerous to ham's gives me the horrors."""
00:30:21,00:30:23,(laughing)
00:30:23,00:30:25,"Yeah, so that's why I think Parsons have very good handwriting."
00:30:25,00:30:27,"Yeah, this is like when I'm in Asia,"
00:30:27,00:30:30,"I speak Mandarin from school, but obviously in Asia,"
00:30:30,00:30:32,every word has four different tones.
00:30:32,00:30:33,"And if you get the tones wrong,"
00:30:33,00:30:36,"you might be saying what's the way to the shops down the road,"
00:30:36,00:30:38,but it comes out as the cow eats the grass
00:30:38,00:30:40,and the way a meringue looks like a banana.
00:30:40,00:30:41,(laughing)
00:30:41,00:30:43,Something completely different.
00:30:43,00:30:44,Does that mean that you have a completely different system
00:30:44,00:30:45,"of puns, though?"
00:30:45,00:30:46,"Yeah, totally."
00:30:46,00:30:48,Chinese puns are extraordinary.
00:30:48,00:30:50,"There was a story that they'd been banned, wasn't there?"
00:30:50,00:30:53,The Chinese government would crack down on puns?
00:30:53,00:30:54,Yeah.
00:30:54,00:30:55,Can you do that?
00:30:55,00:30:56,I don't know.
00:30:56,00:30:57,No cows had been banned from eating meringue.
00:30:57,00:30:58,Also.
00:30:58,00:31:00,(laughing)
00:31:00,00:31:03,"Fountain pens, they're quite interesting."
00:31:03,00:31:05,You're not supposed to share fountain pens with people.
00:31:05,00:31:08,"It was like just a needle, because you..."
00:31:08,00:31:09,Because...
00:31:09,00:31:10,You'll have wrong.
00:31:10,00:31:11,You have a needle.
00:31:11,00:31:13,(laughing)
00:31:13,00:31:15,Is it because of the bodily fluids
00:31:15,00:31:16,you've been writing it exactly?
00:31:16,00:31:19,(laughing)
00:31:19,00:31:22,"It's because every person writes in unique ways,"
00:31:22,00:31:24,"you'd imagine a bit like fingerprint,"
00:31:24,00:31:26,specific angle that you write out
00:31:26,00:31:27,"and the amount of force you use,"
00:31:27,00:31:30,mainly the nib gets sort of shaved down in a very specific way.
00:31:30,00:31:32,And so if you're properly using a fountain pen
00:31:32,00:31:35,"and you want to be writing into the nicest way possible,"
00:31:35,00:31:36,don't lend your pen to someone else
00:31:36,00:31:38,because then they'll shave it down in their way
00:31:38,00:31:39,and you'll just end up with a horrible nib.
00:31:39,00:31:40,"Actually, that's true."
00:31:40,00:31:42,I have learnt fountain pens to people in the past.
00:31:42,00:31:43,"Of course, I'm writing."
00:31:43,00:31:45,"And I've thought, ""Oh my God."""
00:31:45,00:31:46,He's absolutely murdering it.
00:31:46,00:31:48,"I really, I really have thought that."
00:31:48,00:31:49,I can imagine you have had the...
00:31:49,00:31:50,"Yeah, yeah."
00:31:50,00:31:52,"And I haven't said anything at the time, obviously."
00:31:52,00:31:53,(laughing)
00:31:53,00:31:54,Should we wrap up?
00:31:54,00:31:55,Just a cool thing.
00:31:55,00:31:56,Yeah.
00:31:56,00:31:57,"So in medieval times, you would use a scriptor,"
00:31:57,00:31:59,you would write in a scriptorium
00:31:59,00:32:01,as in monks were copying out books.
00:32:01,00:32:02,Yes.
00:32:02,00:32:05,"And some texts, we only know their history"
00:32:05,00:32:09,because of mistakes that got in somewhere along the train
00:32:09,00:32:11,"of being repeated, you know, you make a text."
00:32:11,00:32:12,"Ah, yeah."
00:32:12,00:32:15,And that is similar to the way the enigma codes were broken
00:32:15,00:32:18,"because when people made mistakes in texts,"
00:32:18,00:32:21,that allowed the guys at blechly some way in.
00:32:21,00:32:22,Yeah.
00:32:22,00:32:23,"Yeah, when there was some difference."
00:32:23,00:32:24,Isn't that amazing?
00:32:24,00:32:25,Yeah.
00:32:25,00:32:27,"The difference between medieval and, you know,"
00:32:27,00:32:29,"am I, whatever it was in the war?"
00:32:29,00:32:31,"Just on mistakes, actually."
00:32:31,00:32:34,"It's the Sepha Torah, a special type of copy of the Torah,"
00:32:34,00:32:37,which is handwritten with a quill.
00:32:37,00:32:39,You're not allowed to make mistakes in any of them.
00:32:39,00:32:40,"If you make a mistake on most words,"
00:32:40,00:32:42,then if you're able to scratch it out
00:32:42,00:32:43,and carry on that to OK.
00:32:43,00:32:44,"But if you misspell God's name,"
00:32:44,00:32:46,"or make a mistake in writing God's name,"
00:32:46,00:32:48,"you have to cut out the entire page and bury it,"
00:32:48,00:32:50,and then sew in a new page and start again.
00:32:50,00:32:52,It's pretty hard to misspell God.
00:32:52,00:32:54,"It's not in English, obviously."
00:32:54,00:32:55,"And then dog set off, of course."
00:32:55,00:32:56,Yeah.
00:32:56,00:32:59,(upbeat music)
00:32:59,00:33:00,"OK, that's it."
00:33:00,00:33:01,That's all of our facts.
