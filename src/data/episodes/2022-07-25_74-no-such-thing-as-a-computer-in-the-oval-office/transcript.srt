1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
 (stuttering in foreign language)

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,060
 (upbeat music)

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:16,160
 - Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,600
 as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,080
 from the QI offices in Covenant Garden.

6
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,160
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

7
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,600
 I'm sitting here with James Harkin, Andy Murray,

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,560
 and Alex Bell.

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,720
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

10
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,400
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,720
 and in no particular order, here we go.

12
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,120
 Starting with my facts, and my fact this week

13
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,520
 is that according to the diary of the first chief of MI6,

14
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,720
 this is how the first day went.

15
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,760
 Went to the office, saw no one,

16
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,120
 nor was there anything to do there.

17
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,200
 - And that was the first day of proper spying in Britain.

18
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,440
 - Yeah, when is that because the spies were so good,

19
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,280
 he couldn't fight.

20
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,120
 (laughing)

21
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,400
 - In, there were seven lampstands.

22
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,320
 - So, who was this?

23
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,280
 - Mansfield coming.

24
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,720
 He's the founding chief of MI6.

25
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,200
 This was in the year 1909, I believe.

26
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,720
 And he's someone we've mentioned very briefly

27
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,160
 ages ago on this podcast.

28
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,640
 He's the guy who used to, when he was recruiting people

29
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,160
 in MI6, would stab a knife into his leg

30
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,280
 in order to see what the reaction of the person

31
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,600
 he was interviewing would be.

32
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,880
 - You've missed out a very important bit of that segment.

33
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,800
 - Which is that he had a wooden leg.

34
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,200
 (laughing)

35
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,040
 Very good point.

36
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,200
 And it's a trick you really have to get right, isn't it?

37
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,720
 It can't make a mistake.

38
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,800
 - He had a wooden leg because he lost his first leg,

39
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,680
 having stabbed himself so many times.

40
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,760
 (laughing)

41
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,080
 - Yeah, he said to have gone,

42
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,800
 'cause it was quite hard to walk around with a wooden leg.

43
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,800
 And he wasn't born with it.

44
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,120
 It was later in life, but he used to go around.

45
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:43,960
 - Screw you.

46
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:44,800
 (laughing)

47
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,640
 - Oh, sorry.

48
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,520
 (laughing)

49
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,200
 - Tragically Pinocchio was born with a wooden everything.

50
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,840
 (laughing)

51
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,120
 - But he's an amazing character.

52
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:55,960
 - Matt's you're coming.

53
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:59,720
 He's everything that you would hope for in the founder of...

54
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,080
 - It's so British eccentricity.

55
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,640
 He's like Inspector Clueso.

56
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,640
 All the stories you really have.

57
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,120
 - Favourite British eccentricity.

58
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:05,960
 Inspector.

59
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,120
 (laughing)

60
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,400
 - Oh my god, so eccentric.

61
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,560
 He didn't even have British nationality.

62
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,040
 (laughing)

63
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:13,880
 - Oh no.

64
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,640
 - Before he joined, he was in boom defense.

65
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,480
 - Yes, yeah.

66
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,000
 - Which is defense of the sea.

67
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,760
 The coastline, sort of putting huge piles into the sea.

68
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,000
 - Huge, nets, nets and all sorts of traps

69
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 and spotting devices and things like that.

70
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 And the man who was setting up the secret service

71
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,880
 called A.E. Bethel, wrote to him,

72
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,480
 saying, my dear man, you're coming.

73
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,240
 Boom, defense must be getting a bit stale with you.

74
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,320
 You may therefore perhaps like a new billet.

75
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,160
 If so, I have something good I can offer you.

76
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,600
 - What a cool way of saying, do you want to be...

77
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,440
 - Dot, dot, dot.

78
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,440
 - Just by master.

79
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,560
 - And he was really reluctant.

80
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,400
 - He was living on a narrow boat at the time.

81
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,600
 He was coming up to retirement age anyway.

82
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,840
 And he kept sort of going,

83
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,760
 I really like making these boom nets.

84
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,600
 (laughing)

85
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,440
 And he just keeps asking,

86
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,960
 is like, could I do the boom netting thing

87
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,120
 at the same time, is that a possibility?

88
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,560
 - Do you think that he would spend all his days

89
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,200
 in a my six day dreaming of being not a spy,

90
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,160
 whereas what everyone else would day dream about being a spy?

91
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,000
 - Oh right.

92
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,240
 - You're dreaming of getting a tap on the shoulder

93
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,840
 and saying, would you like to not be a spy?

94
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,680
 (laughing)

95
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,000
 - What's really weird is that he lived on a narrow boat

96
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,040
 before then, he was in the Navy.

97
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,120
 And he had to leave because he got really seasick.

98
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,720
 But then he went to live on a boat.

99
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,560
 - Oh, right.

100
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,400
 - Wow.

101
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,360
 - Not many waves and tides on a canal though, is that right?

102
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,240
 - I'd say even fewer on the land though.

103
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,520
 - That's true, yeah.

104
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,280
 - An interesting thing about spies,

105
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,480
 in the first correspondence,

106
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,160
 where they're talking about the spies,

107
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,000
 they're not referred to by the word spies,

108
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,080
 they're referred to by the word scallywags,

109
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,280
 because they used to recruit people.

110
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,960
 It was different to the romantic notion

111
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,520
 we have of this James Bond character.

112
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,280
 It was all about any kind of common criminal

113
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,240
 that you might be able to find overseas

114
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,560
 who'd be up for doing some spying for you.

115
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,280
 The word scallywags was used in the war

116
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,080
 to refer to people who would kind of do very, very small things

117
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,880
 to put off any invaders,

118
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:58,040
 so like turning signs round or that kind of thing.

119
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:58,880
 - I know something about them.

120
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,320
 I think we did this on the show actually,

121
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,360
 is that private Godfrey from Dad's Army

122
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:05,200
 was in a group called the Scallywags in the Second World War,

123
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,480
 which was devoted to sabotage

124
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,960
 of any potential German invasion.

125
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,760
 And they were given arms,

126
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,920
 they were given the ingredients to make bombs,

127
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,400
 they were given instructions for how to set up

128
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,200
 razor wire tracks across roads.

129
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,520
 It really was pretty unpleasant,

130
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,920
 the stuff that they were prepared to do

131
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,080
 in the event of an invasion.

132
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,080
 Yeah, of course.

133
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,240
 - So do you guys know about all the other MIs?

134
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,400
 Because they're in 19 of them,

135
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,240
 although they were.

136
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,240
 Yeah, it's amazing.

137
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,000
 Okay, so there was, for example,

138
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,600
 MI1 was coat and ciphers,

139
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,720
 and that's now GCHQ.

140
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,680
 So some of them still exist,

141
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,680
 but they're under different names.

142
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,440
 They've been subsumed, you know, glazing and stuff like that.

143
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,400
 My favorite ones are MI4,

144
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,080
 which was the geographical section,

145
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,600
 so maps, they just dealt with maps.

146
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,560
 MI7, which was press and propaganda,

147
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,280
 which was kind of interesting.

148
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,760
 And MI16, which is scientific intelligence,

149
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,400
 that was formed in 1945.

150
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,320
 During the Scottish independence debate,

151
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,440
 it was revealed that there's still money going into MI16.

152
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,440
 So it still exists.

153
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,280
 How cool is that?

154
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,800
 - But then it is just scientists.

155
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,200
 I reckon you got to a party and go,

156
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,680
 "Oh, yeah, actually, I work for MI16."

157
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,520
 (laughing)

158
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,920
 - There's no MI13 though.

159
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,760
 - There's no, no.

160
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,840
 - No, it's not because it's paddling.

161
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,680
 - Well, I don't know.

162
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,800
 There are a couple that never existed.

163
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,760
 So for some reason, I mean,

164
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,000
 MI8 was only used in fiction, apparently.

165
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,160
 But then why would you not just use all the numbers?

166
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,720
 It's really odd that they missed out a couple.

167
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,680
 - Yeah, yeah.

168
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,800
 - So the correct name for MI6 is the SIS,

169
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,600
 which is a secret intelligence service.

170
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,440
 - Yes.

171
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:26,440
 - It was originally known as a secret service bureau.

172
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,440
 And that was known as either the SS bureau,

173
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,480
 or sometimes just the SS.

174
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,200
 - Ooh, it's done in a fashion now.

175
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,040
 - Do you want to know something else

176
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,120
 that's really cool about Mansfield coming?

177
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,280
 - I think that he invented the method

178
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,760
 of spies driving up to someone and saying, "Get in."

179
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,720
 - So before that, people would just stand there

180
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,560
 when the car got there and go, "Well, what do you want me to do?"

181
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,760
 - I don't know.

182
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,040
 - So basically, he would drive to meet people, right?

183
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,600
 But he thought that they would have associates

184
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,000
 who would be waiting to photograph you

185
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,600
 or that they would be waiting to, you know,

186
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,760
 cost you or whatever.

187
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:59,280
 So he said, "Drive past the rendezvous on the opposite side,

188
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,520
 and once you've spotted the target, and I'm quoting here,

189
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,160
 drive up close to him, open the door, and invite him in.

190
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,760
 I lean back the moment I've caught his eye,

191
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,600
 and from then on, I do not show myself at all."

192
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,240
 - This is another bit from his diary.

193
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,160
 - Surely we cannot be expected to sit in the office month

194
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,040
 by month doing absolutely nothing.

195
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,680
 There was just nothing to do.

196
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,480
 And then on the 14th and 15th of October,

197
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:25,200
 his diary then again reads, "Office all day, no one appeared."

198
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,360
 - I heard it was just an office rented in the name

199
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,280
 of a private detective called Mr. Drew.

200
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,120
 - Yes.

201
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:31,960
 - Victorious Dread.

202
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,800
 - And then the next office as well,

203
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,200
 or one of the later offices was under another pseudonym.

204
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,200
 - There was one that was 54 Broadway.

205
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,480
 They had that between 1926 and 1964.

206
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,680
 But the sign outside said,

207
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,960
 "It was the Mini-Max Fire Extinguisher Company."

208
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,800
 - Wow.

209
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,200
 - And that was actually MI6.

210
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:53,800
 And when they eventually sold that property to buy a new one,

211
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,880
 they realized that people were coming round to view it.

212
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,400
 And one of the people who came to view

213
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,160
 was a Russian trade delegation.

214
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,000
 (laughing)

215
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,840
 - They had to quickly go around

216
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,680
 and take all the maps off the walls, yeah.

217
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,280
 - That was amazing.

218
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,040
 There's also a very another exciting character

219
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,720
 who was recruited by Mansfield Cumming,

220
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,920
 which was a man called Thomas Merton.

221
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,960
 He was the original cue.

222
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,200
 He was the gadget man.

223
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,760
 Yeah, he worked out how they could create an invisible ink

224
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,520
 for writing, because up until then,

225
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,600
 they'd been experimenting with using semen,

226
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,280
 which I think is quite well known, right?

227
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,840
 - Yeah, Mansfield Cumming said

228
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,280
 that he thought the best invisible ink was semen.

229
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,120
 - Yeah.

230
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,600
 - The advantage of using bodily fluids

231
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,960
 is that if you were found in possession of them,

232
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,560
 they weren't incriminating.

233
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,920
 - If you're in a bottle, I think it's more incriminating.

234
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:42,920
 - No, the idea is that spies had been convicted

235
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,680
 and sentenced to death because they'd been found

236
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,600
 with lemon juice and stuff like that,

237
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,680
 'cause they say, "Why would you have lemon juice on you?"

238
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,040
 - I think why do you have semen on you?

239
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,280
 It's still a good question for us, it's not one.

240
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,280
 (laughing)

241
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,040
 - Is this anything to do with Cumming?

242
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,840
 (laughing)

243
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,680
 - That's amazing.

244
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,480
 - The agent who discovered that you can use semen

245
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,520
 as invisible ink apparently had to transfer

246
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,360
 to another department after he was teased

247
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,280
 so much by other staff members.

248
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,200
 (laughing)

249
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,760
 So bad, that's it.

250
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:15,120
 And apparently there was one officer in Copenhagen

251
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,960
 who took the discovery so seriously

252
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,480
 that he stocked a whole load of invisible ink in his office

253
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:25,000
 and it began to smell so badly that other agent said to him,

254
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,600
 "You should use fresh every time you want to write a letter

255
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,480
 "and rather than saving it."

256
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,640
 - Oh my God.

257
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,840
 You have to really take someone aside

258
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,120
 to acquire one of the rooms, tell them that then.

259
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,800
 - So I'm surprised that in all the stuff

260
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,920
 that I read of Mansfield coming,

261
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,880
 I've only read this in one spot probably,

262
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:46,720
 but Rasputin's death was off the back of Mansfield coming.

263
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,560
 - Supposedly.

264
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,680
 - Yeah, I think the word British might have evolved

265
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,720
 somehow in his death definitely.

266
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,120
 They poisoned him and he sort of ate all the poison

267
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,920
 and then he laughed and he had it having a great time

268
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,920
 and then they beat him up and then they shot him

269
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,760
 a couple of times.

270
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,600
 He still didn't die.

271
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,560
 - I think I read was they smashed his testicles flat.

272
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,360
 - Terrible.

273
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,840
 - You won't be writing any more invisible ink letters

274
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,000
 off of this, will you?

275
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,720
 (laughing)

276
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,240
 (upbeat music)

277
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:17,440
 - Okay, time for fact number two and that is James.

278
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,120
 - Okay, my fact this week is that there is a distillery

279
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,320
 in Kentucky that claims that playing Bruce Springsteen

280
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,800
 to the whiskey improves the aging process.

281
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,120
 - Is that because of Bruce Springsteen going through

282
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,120
 the aging process himself and he knows what it's like?

283
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,840
 - Therefore he can teach the whiskey.

284
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,840
 - It'd be nice to be that but no, sadly not.

285
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,960
 It is the vibrations they think.

286
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,760
 - But specifically Bruce Springsteen.

287
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:44,040
 - No, it's just any old music but I think being in Kentucky

288
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,240
 that's just the kind of rock they like.

289
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,440
 - Plus it being dad rock, it just naturally ages

290
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,800
 anything that listens to it.

291
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,360
 (laughing)

292
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,160
 - So this will be Bobham because it's in Kentucky

293
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,280
 but when you make any kind of whiskey like this,

294
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:00,040
 the way that ages is they put it in barrels

295
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:03,440
 and then the liquor inside the barrel will go

296
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,680
 in and out of the pores of the wood

297
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,880
 and that will give it it's kind of woody taste

298
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,720
 and it will age it in that way.

299
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,320
 And they think that by bracing it,

300
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,880
 it will slosh the liquid around a bit more

301
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,880
 which will make it age quicker.

302
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,840
 It seems like it probably does work to a certain extent.

303
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,320
 - It's really cool the way that whiskey distilleries

304
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,720
 make drinks that might not actually hit the market

305
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,320
 until after the founders are either retired or dead.

306
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,720
 So there are 70 year old whiskeys which go on sale.

307
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,240
 - Yeah, and this is something that they made 70 years ago.

308
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,080
 What was that?

309
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:36,600
 70 years ago from now that's 1945.

310
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,920
 Why don't know how much whiskey they were making in 1945

311
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,920
 and other things of the mind, but yeah, it's just incredible.

312
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,760
 - Yeah, it's really interesting as well

313
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,960
 the relationship between the whiskey and the barrel

314
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,640
 because obviously the, like you say,

315
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,320
 the essence of the barrel goes into the whiskey

316
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,480
 but it happens all the way around as well.

317
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,520
 So the barrels in which Jack Daniel's Tennessee whiskey

318
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:58,920
 is aged are reused afterwards to age to basco sauce.

319
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,640
 - I think they also sell the barrels

320
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,400
 over to scotch companies as well.

321
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,240
 - Yes, I do.

322
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,760
 I've been to the Jack Daniel's Distillery.

323
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,600
 - How do you do?

324
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,840
 - In Tennessee and a fact about it is that it's a dry county.

325
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,920
 You're not allowed to buy alcohol there.

326
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,760
 - Wow.

327
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,360
 - There's a special sort of dispensation.

328
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,960
 So you can, I think you can buy a souvenir bottle

329
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,440
 but you're not allowed to actually drink it

330
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,800
 until you're over the border out of that particular county.

331
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,280
 - Yeah, it's amazing the relationship of music

332
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:27,440
 and alcohol so there was a report done,

333
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,720
 a research report by guy called Professor North

334
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,800
 who found that people were five times more likely

335
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,560
 to buy French wine than German wine

336
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,800
 if a accordion music was playing in the background.

337
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,640
 - What?

338
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,480
 - Yeah.

339
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,640
 - What about if there was umpah music?

340
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,480
 - Umpah.

341
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,320
 - No way.

342
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,040
 - Umpah band was played the German product

343
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,040
 outsold the French by two to one.

344
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:44,880
 - With two to one?

345
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,640
 - I can't believe that the effect is substantial.

346
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,680
 - People are so impressionable.

347
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,280
 - There was a study done quite recently

348
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:55,400
 about the best environment to drink whiskey.

349
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,080
 They had people drinking it in a...

350
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,600
 - Oh, it's on your own, isn't it?

351
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,440
 (laughing)

352
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,480
 It's um, you just stare at the wall.

353
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,960
 - Yeah, and you're on the pants.

354
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,280
 (laughing)

355
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,120
 - Sorry.

356
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,040
 - They had a grassy room with a turf floor

357
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,040
 and the bar in the sheep

358
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,600
 and the smell of freshly cut grass.

359
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,600
 - Just do it outside.

360
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,240
 (laughing)

361
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,240
 - Oh, that's the best new room.

362
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,120
 Unfortunately, there's no other room in existence

363
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,880
 than anyone can drink that in.

364
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,720
 (laughing)

365
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,560
 - That's one.

366
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,120
 The other one is a sweet room,

367
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,160
 which was filled with a sweet fragrance,

368
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,480
 rounded red objects,

369
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,480
 and a high-pitched tinkling sound.

370
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,520
 (laughing)

371
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,440
 And then the last one was a woody room

372
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,320
 with wood paneling and floorboards.

373
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,080
 The sounds of leaves crunching and log fires

374
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,720
 and the smell of cedar wood.

375
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,400
 And the wooden one was by far

376
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,120
 what people enjoyed the most in the wooden room.

377
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:44,960
 - Wow.

378
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,800
 The woody room.

379
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,640
 - The woody room, yeah.

380
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,480
 - Cool.

381
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,080
 - Um, this, you know, this report I was just talking

382
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:52,200
 about different tastes of wine and match to music.

383
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,320
 They actually released a playlist of the types of music

384
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,920
 you should listen to to the different wines.

385
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,680
 So when you're drinking a Marlowe.

386
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,280
 - Oh, by my side.

387
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,720
 (laughing)

388
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,760
 - Just, I'll repeat five hundred times.

389
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,560
 (laughing)

390
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,800
 - If you're drinking a Marlowe,

391
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,800
 sitting on the dock of the bay by Otis Redding.

392
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,640
 - Okay.

393
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,520
 - Easy by Lionel Richey.

394
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,880
 - Over the rainbow by Eva Cassidy.

395
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,520
 - None of those are French songs.

396
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,880
 - No, these are, this was the French

397
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,240
 and German wine tasting was about what you buy

398
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,080
 in a supermarket.

399
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,440
 This is about how it actually tastes better.

400
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,200
 - I understand, but how does it affect the taste?

401
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,600
 - Okay, so what he says is that they did a study

402
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,080
 with over 250 university students.

403
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,800
 They played them various different bits of music

404
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,680
 and they all reported back that a certain type of music

405
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,480
 absolutely tasted way better than if they heard it

406
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,480
 with more wine.

407
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,840
 - I can imagine if you have kind of a more smooth tasting wine

408
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,760
 than you want more smooth kind of music.

409
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,600
 - Yeah.

410
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,440
 - That kind of makes sense.

411
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,160
 - I can imagine students just trying to find some correlation

412
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,920
 to play on so that they just get given more free wine.

413
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,080
 (laughing)

414
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:56,920
 - I'm gonna need to hear another one of them.

415
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,920
 - Yeah, yeah.

416
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,520
 - Let's try it again.

417
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,360
 - I think I'm sporting a pattern.

418
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,880
 I think we should continue, guys.

419
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,440
 - Chardonnay had what's love got to do with it.

420
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,400
 Tina Turner, spinning around by Kylie Manot

421
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,120
 and rock DJ by Robbie Williams.

422
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,200
 That's what Chardonnay tastes best with.

423
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,240
 This research, by the way, was carried out by a wine maker

424
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:19,240
 from Chile who himself plays monastic chance

425
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,440
 to his maturing wines.

426
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,280
 - Does he?

427
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,120
 - Yeah, okay.

428
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,040
 - So that's his choice, no spring steam.

429
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,080
 - Okay, so there was a whiskey,

430
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,720
 Bob and whiskey in America,

431
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,240
 where the warehouse where it was held was hit by a tornado.

432
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,840
 And basically the whole of the house

433
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,720
 was almost ripped to smithereens.

434
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,440
 But the barrels were kind of left,

435
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,640
 more or less where they were.

436
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,280
 Apparently when they tried the whiskey,

437
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,040
 it was absolutely amazing.

438
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,920
 And it's called tornado surviving whiskey.

439
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:47,680
 And it's superior to the usual product, they say.

440
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,600
 - I would say that too if I had an enormous bill of damage

441
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,440
 to read that.

442
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,960
 This whiskey is suddenly quadrupled in value.

443
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,800
 Wow, oh god.

444
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,760
 Well, I mean, that's something, I suppose.

445
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,600
 - Yeah.

446
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,000
 And there's another company called Ocean Aged Bourbon

447
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,440
 who take their whiskey

448
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:08,640
 and then put it on a boat, send it out to sea for four years

449
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,840
 and when it comes back, apparently it tastes not better.

450
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,920
 - I think this is all nonsense.

451
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,160
 - I know it sounds like it sounds like it's not true,

452
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,920
 but there is a little bit of science behind it.

453
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,960
 The more that it kind of slushes against the word,

454
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,400
 the more it will react to it.

455
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,560
 They really do believe it.

456
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,600
 Like the whiskey maker's really believe it.

457
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,120
 - If you go on the internet,

458
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,400
 you can find a nice advert for whiskey toothpaste.

459
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,240
 - Wow.

460
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,080
 - Don't even know if it's real,

461
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,960
 but the advert seems to be there.

462
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:35,400
 It's 6% proof, scotch bourbon whiskey.

463
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,560
 And the advert says,

464
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,320
 "Why fight oral hygiene?"

465
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,640
 Enjoy it.

466
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,960
 Here's real he-man toothpaste.

467
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:45,080
 Best argument yet for brushing three times a day.

468
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,360
 - It's also a fantastic excuse

469
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,480
 for turning up at work, smelling of whiskey.

470
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,320
 (laughing)

471
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,360
 - No, no, no, that's my good taste.

472
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,120
 (upbeat music)

473
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:58,600
 - Okay, time for fact number three and that is Alex Bell.

474
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,840
 - Okay, my fact is that there is a statue

475
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,920
 of Nicola Tesla in Silicon Valley

476
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,000
 that radiates free Wi-Fi.

477
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,840
 - Cool.

478
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,680
 - It's cool, isn't it?

479
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,520
 - That is what he would have wanted.

480
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,360
 - It is, yeah.

481
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,760
 - It's him holding a sort of giant wireless light bulb

482
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,840
 and the light bulb sort of goes off Wi-Fi.

483
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,960
 - As a kickstarter project.

484
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,960
 - I've seen the drawings of it.

485
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,800
 I have to say in the drawings,

486
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,920
 they don't quite get the light bulb right in his hand.

487
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,280
 It looks like a big ping pong bag.

488
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,120
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

489
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,120
 - It does look a bit weird.

490
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,680
 - Yeah, and it's like, yeah,

491
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,800
 it's quite an odd thing for him to be holding as well,

492
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,520
 but we should say who Tesla was.

493
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,360
 - Yeah.

494
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,280
 - He was known as the man who invented the 20th century.

495
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,120
 - Yeah.

496
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:32,960
 - As in before Tesla.

497
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,120
 - It was the 19th century.

498
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,680
 (laughing)

499
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,760
 - He was born on the first century in 1900.

500
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,400
 He was born 1856.

501
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,240
 - Okay.

502
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,040
 - He was born into a lightning storm, a fierce lightning storm,

503
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,240
 according to this, his family legend,

504
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,960
 and midway through the birth, the midwife said

505
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,040
 that the lightning was a bad omen.

506
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,720
 And she said that he'll be a child of darkness.

507
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,440
 And the mother said, no, he will be a child of light.

508
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:57,400
 That definitely sounds like a driving ride thing there.

509
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,840
 And so Tesla was this fantastic scientist,

510
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,000
 very, very eccentric man.

511
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,440
 We talked about him a bit on the podcast and QI.

512
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,400
 He was, he invented, among other things,

513
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,080
 we talked about the death rate he invented on the podcast.

514
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,880
 - The main thing he invented was the AC polyphase system,

515
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,640
 which does not sound sexy, but it was unbelievable.

516
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,840
 So before Tesla, you could pump up,

517
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,720
 you could transport electricity one mile before Tesla.

518
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,880
 And even then you could only use it

519
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,120
 for lighting up light bulbs and things.

520
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:27,400
 Thanks to his system, you can transmit it hundreds of miles

521
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,040
 and use it for industrial machinery.

522
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:32,480
 I mean, it made electricity into a viable technology

523
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,600
 which could span the world.

524
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,480
 - I run it that he's now a wife, I think,

525
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,360
 that probably goes about two meters.

526
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,320
 (laughing)

527
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,160
 - Yeah.

528
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,240
 He was a big whiskey-efficient, I don't actually think.

529
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,080
 - What's he talking whiskey?

530
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,320
 Yeah, he drank it every day

531
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,160
 and he thought that he would live to 150

532
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,000
 by drinking it.

533
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,840
 - Well, try.

534
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,840
 - Prohibition came along

535
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,200
 and he was not a fan of Prohibition at all because of this,

536
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,560
 but he went along with it anyway

537
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,560
 and decided that he was now only going to live to 130

538
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,360
 because he was no longer drinking whiskey.

539
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,320
 He lived to 86, I think, yeah.

540
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,160
 - That's pretty good.

541
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,000
 - Pretty good.

542
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,840
 - Yeah, but he's a long way off his prediction, isn't he?

543
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,680
 - Yeah, that's true.

544
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,320
 - Well, Prohibition, he probably couldn't factor

545
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,040
 in how many years has that actually happened?

546
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,880
 - The last mathematician, I think it was Cardano,

547
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,800
 but it might not have been him,

548
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,000
 but it was one of the people around

549
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,600
 at the same time as him around the Renaissance.

550
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:18,000
 That predicted exactly the day he was going to die

551
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,160
 and told everyone this was the day he was going to die

552
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,640
 and he was exactly right.

553
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,600
 But a lot of people think he probably killed himself.

554
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,960
 - To prove himself right.

555
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,440
 - Ah, yeah.

556
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,960
 - I was looking at some other statues as well.

557
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,800
 - Oh yeah.

558
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,520
 - The statue of Winston Churchill in Parliament Square.

559
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,080
 There's a myth that it's electrified

560
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,320
 to say that Pigeon's no one around on it,

561
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,760
 but I looked it up and I found a new scientist article

562
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,320
 that says that they thought about it, they didn't do it.

563
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,760
 - Yeah, they also thought about inserting pins

564
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,160
 that would stand out at the top of his head

565
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,680
 intending to stop the birds as well.

566
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,000
 - So that's the standard way of stopping Pigeon?

567
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,680
 - Yeah, but they just thought that would look really weird,

568
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,920
 like he had a punk hairdo.

569
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,760
 - Yeah.

570
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,600
 - So also the top of his head.

571
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,040
 - It's really subtle, though the risk you'll just end up

572
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,560
 with a dead Pigeon.

573
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,720
 - That's right, yeah.

574
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,840
 - Yeah, with Winston Churchill's head.

575
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,280
 - But also the location of where the statue stands

576
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,440
 is located in a spot that in the '50s

577
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,200
 used to be referred to by Churchill

578
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,200
 as where my statue will go in the exact spot.

579
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,040
 - Really?

580
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:12,960
 - Yeah, so that's he would constantly say that

581
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,800
 if ever they passed.

582
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,920
 He would say that's where my statue will go.

583
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,360
 And that's where it did.

584
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,560
 - He was successful in his life,

585
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:21,080
 but I mean, that's quite a presumption to make for anyone.

586
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:21,920
 - Yeah, I don't know.

587
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,640
 - Just to walk you the park, loudly proclaiming,

588
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,640
 that's where my statue will go.

589
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,440
 - Well, as long as you don't say it everywhere you go

590
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,240
 and you help to win the Second World War.

591
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,080
 - Yeah, I don't know.

592
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,080
 I'd be inclined to give him a statue.

593
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:30,920
 - Well, towards the end there,

594
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,200
 he got voted out and people weren't particularly happy with it.

595
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,800
 - He got voted out immediately afterwards.

596
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,000
 - Yeah, he got voted back in.

597
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,840
 - At the age of 80.

598
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,920
 - He was elected prime minister.

599
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,280
 - Yeah, amazing.

600
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:43,280
 - There's a mysterious statue in Budapest of Colombo.

601
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,560
 - I'm Detective Peter Falk, yeah.

602
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,920
 - Not the guy who discovered the clitoris.

603
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,160
 - No, that's a call back.

604
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:54,440
 - That's a call back to an episode between 1555

605
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,240
 that anyone wants to have a listen.

606
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,880
 Yeah, there's a slightly mysterious Peter Falk statue

607
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,160
 sitting in a street in Budapest.

608
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,120
 No one's quite sure why it's there.

609
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,040
 It was built about three years after his death.

610
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,200
 It just suddenly was there.

611
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,760
 They think it was a hungarian politician.

612
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,760
 - Do you think maybe you went there

613
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,760
 on holiday once and when?

614
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,360
 That's where my statue's gonna go.

615
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,520
 (laughing)

616
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,600
 - Yes, exactly.

617
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,320
 - So he did, he's known to have had hungarian roots

618
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,160
 through his grandparents side.

619
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,720
 But yeah, there's no actual link.

620
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,280
 No one's quite sure why it's there.

621
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,200
 - There's the world's smallest sculpture

622
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,520
 by a guy called John T. Hurwitz.

623
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,000
 It was unveiled earlier this year

624
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,840
 and it was almost, it was less than,

625
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,320
 it was less than one millimeter tall

626
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,040
 and was almost immediately destroyed

627
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,360
 when the photographer accidentally crushed it

628
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,200
 with his finger.

629
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,120
 - No, yeah, really.

630
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:42,640
 It was being photographed standing inside the eye of a needle.

631
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,960
 - There was a museum in Bath called the Impossible Micro World

632
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,520
 which was the most fantastic museum and it closed down.

633
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,800
 But it's amazing, this amazing guy called Willard Wicken

634
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,640
 who makes these things.

635
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,480
 And he's done so as a sculpture of a horse dancing

636
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,480
 on the head of an actual ant.

637
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,320
 - Wow.

638
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,160
 - All the exhibits in the museum,

639
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,000
 you had to go through.

640
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,840
 I went when I was a--

641
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,800
 - The museum normal size.

642
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,240
 So I was going to, it wasn't closed down

643
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:06,560
 when someone accidentally stood down and got something.

644
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:09,600
 - Every exhibit you had to look at through a magnifier,

645
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,440
 basically.

646
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,440
 - Wow.

647
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,360
 - And this guy, he has to slow down his heartbeat

648
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:17,600
 in order to make the cuts necessary

649
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,720
 on the thing he's sculpting.

650
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,480
 So he slows it right down, look through the binoculars

651
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,720
 or the magnifier or the microscope,

652
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,040
 whatever he's using, waits for a heartbeat,

653
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,640
 makes the cut on the thing,

654
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,280
 then the next heartbeat happens.

655
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,280
 - It's just incredible that his hands were so unshaky

656
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,640
 that his heartbeat could have affected how shaky they were.

657
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,000
 I mean, if I try to do something,

658
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,560
 my hands are way shaky than what is being affected

659
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,400
 by my heartbeat.

660
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,400
 - Yes, but you drink very heavy, too.

661
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,800
 - I don't know if it's whiskey, yeah.

662
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,040
 - Do you want to hear some facts about Wi-Fi?

663
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,720
 - Yes, please Andy.

664
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,560
 - Okay.

665
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,040
 - So, this is cool.

666
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:49,880
 There's an Israeli theme park called Ka-Dem, right?

667
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,560
 And it's a traditional theme park

668
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,400
 for people who want to experience life

669
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,640
 as it was in Galilee 2000 years ago, right?

670
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,320
 If people get bored, I presume,

671
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,280
 or want to check their phones.

672
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,200
 They have donkeys walking around with Wi-Fi hotspots on them.

673
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,040
 - Oh, wow.

674
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,440
 - But the thing is they have 30 donkeys,

675
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,880
 and only five of the donkeys are actually carrying Wi-Fi hotspots.

676
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,080
 So there's only one in six chunks that you're donkey.

677
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,880
 - Do you spend ages trying to connect to that one?

678
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,920
 - So you run a donkey and then you say,

679
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:16,040
 "No, not this one, they've got another donkey."

680
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,640
 - How to imagine anyone getting bored

681
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:21,800
 at a theme park which recreates 2000 years old Israel?

682
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,400
 It's just really difficult.

683
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,560
 When you were talking about running around finding donkeys,

684
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,600
 this just reminded me of something that Alex told us

685
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,920
 just before we walked in about the...

686
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:35,040
 Is like a children's playground following you around?

687
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,920
 - Oh yeah, I just saw this video on BBC News.

688
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,200
 Some of you know, these random science products

689
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,160
 they get made for seemingly no reason.

690
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,200
 A guy has created a climbing frame

691
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,360
 that wonders around parks,

692
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,800
 looking for children to play on it.

693
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,400
 But it just sounds like the most ridiculous

694
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,240
 and also predatory thing.

695
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,080
 - Well, they've done it to say,

696
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,240
 "I've spliced the jeans of a climbing frame and a pedophile."

697
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,240
 (laughing)

698
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,080
 - It's absolutely horrendous.

699
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,840
 The idea is going to get children used

700
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,560
 to the idea of robotics in real life.

701
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,080
 - Does it move if you're climbing on it?

702
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:06,920
 Or does it stop?

703
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,520
 - I don't know, I mean, it sounds incredibly dangerous.

704
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,040
 - It doesn't matter, it's an academic question

705
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,560
 because no child will ever climb on this thing.

706
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,560
 - I don't think they have any choice.

707
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,080
 - I mean, I should say, it's very slow.

708
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,480
 It doesn't like gallop around or anything like that.

709
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:22,280
 - Can I talk about the sort of invention of a Wi-Fi for seconds?

710
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,080
 - I want to show around to ages, and I'm going to have a chance.

711
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,200
 Okay, you can't say this at home,

712
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,600
 but there are slides coming out.

713
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,520
 (all laughing)

714
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,920
 - Helen Lamar, which is very glamorous films

715
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,760
 done in America, '30s and '40s.

716
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,240
 She was one time dubbed the world most beautiful woman,

717
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,120
 but she was also this fantastic scientist as well.

718
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:38,960
 When the war broke out,

719
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,720
 she applied to the National Inventors Guild

720
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,960
 but was rejected many because she was a woman

721
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:43,960
 and people didn't take her seriously.

722
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,800
 And then she was encouraged to use her celebrity

723
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,000
 and beauty to sell warboms,

724
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,520
 which she did a little bit.

725
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,680
 But she got started inventing things herself.

726
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,960
 She got together with her neighbor,

727
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,040
 who was a composer called George Antile,

728
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,680
 and they built a machine called

729
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:58,080
 a frequency-hopping spread spectrum.

730
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,880
 Basically, the problem with torpedoes at that time

731
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,160
 was that they were remote controlled,

732
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,560
 so they were kept on causing a radio signal transmitted

733
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:06,640
 from the ship, but that signal could be easily blocked.

734
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,720
 And Lamar and Antile developed this improved system

735
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,080
 that allowed a radio signal to jump up and down frequencies

736
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,520
 randomly so that it couldn't be jammed.

737
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,280
 But what's really brilliant is how they did it.

738
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,320
 You guys know what player pianos are, right?

739
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,680
 They're pianos that play themselves.

740
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,040
 They have this big role of paper music,

741
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,240
 which has lots of holes in.

742
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,760
 And they correspond to which notes should play and when.

743
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,200
 The frequency-hopping spread spectrum

744
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,920
 used the mechanism from the player piano,

745
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,320
 but instead of playing 88 keys of the piano,

746
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,040
 it switched the torpedo signal

747
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,880
 between 88 radio frequencies.

748
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,320
 The principle of modern wireless technology is based on that.

749
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,600
 WiFi, GPS, Bluetooth, everything like that.

750
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,880
 Wow, really amazing.

751
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,880
 That's so cool.

752
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,040
 So Sri Lanka, the island of Sri Lanka,

753
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:44,280
 is about to provide WiFi to the entire island

754
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:47,320
 using a network of floating balloons,

755
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:50,160
 which are going to be 12 miles up in the sky

756
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,920
 they're all solar powered and the solar power

757
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,440
 that the balloons get is going to be used

758
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,720
 to transmit internet signals to the spot of land beneath it.

759
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,400
 How insane is that 25,000 square miles?

760
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,240
 That's amazing.

761
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,160
 The area of the country.

762
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:04,440
 You know one place that I'm still trying to find this out

763
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:08,200
 for certain and I can't properly find anywhere online yet

764
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,000
 that would tell me the right answer.

765
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,280
 But certainly up until 2012, you can't get WiFi in the White House.

766
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:14,800
 Wow.

767
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,320
 Yeah, the White House has no WiFi.

768
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:20,880
 And like, for example, the Oval Office doesn't have a computer in it.

769
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,360
 And if you want to use a computer in it,

770
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,960
 you have to bring in a laptop and plug in Clinton,

771
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,480
 famously apparently only sent two emails

772
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,640
 during his time as president.

773
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,360
 One was as a test.

774
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,360
 And then the second one was--

775
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,120
 Was the elite everything?

776
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,600
 Was the second one too spaced?

777
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,320
 Yes, yes.

778
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,880
 Yeah, it was to John Glenn.

779
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,120
 So I don't know if he was in the--

780
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,560
 Yeah, he was in the ISS on the second trip.

781
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,800
 John, you were hearing a lot of crazy stuff about me.

782
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,640
 Yeah, I do.

783
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,960
 I just don't think no, none of it's true.

784
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,920
 Mr. Clinton, we've gone through your entire five million emails

785
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,800
 and we think there's two of them we can save.

786
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:58,600
 Yes.

787
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,840
 Good news about the invisible ink you were asking about.

788
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:09,280
 OK, time for our final factor, the show.

789
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:12,440
 And that is Andrew Hunter Murray.

790
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:15,280
 My fact is that a third of people in Britain have written almost nothing

791
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,480
 by hand in the last six months.

792
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,160
 This makes so much sense when you think about it,

793
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,840
 but it sounds crazy when you first--

794
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:21,720
 It sounds terrifying.

795
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,320
 Yeah, so this was a survey, admittedly,

796
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,160
 by a printing and mailing company called DocMail.

797
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,000
 But what they said was that one in three people

798
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,280
 had not written anything by hand for six months.

799
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:34,160
 And on average, people hadn't written something for 41 days.

800
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,840
 And I think when they say written anything by hand,

801
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,480
 I mean, anything that's not a shopping list opposed to those--

802
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,320
 Oh, signature.

803
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,320
 They're signature.

804
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,040
 Yeah, yeah.

805
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,840
 But when you think about it, what is there

806
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,320
 that you need to write at length?

807
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,240
 Letters to people.

808
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:49,160
 Most people don't write many letters these days, if any.

809
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:53,240
 I presume at school, still, you would be writing all the time.

810
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,640
 Well, one thing about that is, apparently,

811
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,840
 if you write things down, it helps you remember them.

812
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:58,360
 Yep.

813
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,640
 You know, that makes kind of enthusiasm.

814
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,000
 I do definitely believe that, yeah.

815
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,600
 But actually, there's like a neurological reason for it.

816
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,440
 Like, there are certain neural circuits

817
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,760
 that are activated whenever you write things down.

818
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,840
 And so children who write tend to learn more quickly.

819
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,120
 And so if you have schools where children aren't really

820
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:17,360
 writing things down, then it can hamper their improvement.

821
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,360
 Right.

822
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,200
 Wow.

823
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,760
 The other downside that we're sort of going to have in the years

824
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:25,480
 to come is that all these great works of literature

825
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,480
 and everything else, we're not going

826
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,280
 to have the original handwritten notes of people

827
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,320
 doing drafts because so much of it now is on computers.

828
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,600
 So the American Museum of Natural History

829
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,920
 on their website, I'll tweet a link.

830
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,400
 It's if they've got all of Darwin's papers and all his works.

831
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,120
 And it's amazing, because you can see all of his handwriting,

832
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,080
 which is really bad.

833
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,960
 And he's got little doodles of drawings.

834
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,240
 His kids drew pictures on the back.

835
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:46,200
 There's an amazing one of a fish walking on the land

836
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,200
 holding an umbrella, which I really like.

837
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,280
 So they always see subscribed to his theory.

838
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:54,120
 The opposite of calligraphy is calligraphy, bad handwriting.

839
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:57,040
 Bad handwriting, that's great calligraphy.

840
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,920
 They reckon that in like a 100 years time,

841
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:03,080
 the, in fact, even neatly written hand writing

842
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,000
 will be completely illegible to people.

843
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,640
 Because it's like if you look at very, very old calligraphy,

844
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,160
 now you can't understand any of it.

845
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,000
 Yeah, definitely.

846
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,840
 And then in a 100 years time, it might be only

847
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,400
 that you can recognise time's new role men are.

848
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,800
 Looking at say Jane Austen's letters or something,

849
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,560
 quite actually quite difficult to decipher.

850
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,480
 Yeah, some other words.

851
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,480
 The guy who's credited with pretty much single-handedly

852
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,600
 reviving modern calligraphy and penmanship

853
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,080
 is Edward Johnston, who also is very, very big in fonts.

854
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,800
 Not like font size.

855
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:34,400
 Yeah, I mean, he creates a Johnston,

856
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:37,560
 and New Johnston is now the London Underground font.

857
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,520
 And he mentored the sculptor Eric Gil.

858
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,320
 He came up with Gil Sans, which is the BBC's official font.

859
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,280
 There's two massive institutions.

860
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:47,440
 Here's another incredibly creepy company.

861
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,040
 If we'll just off the back with the playground switch,

862
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,880
 follow it on.

863
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,200
 There's a company which has made a robot

864
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,200
 to write handwritten letters.

865
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,440
 So basically, you write a lot of handwriting samples

866
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,520
 and then a robot reads your handwriting samples

867
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,120
 and can perfectly replicate your handwriting.

868
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,680
 And they basically say that they want to retain the delight

869
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:07,000
 of giving and receiving notes without the hassle

870
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,320
 of heading to the stationary store writing out a letter,

871
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,520
 finding stamps and locating a mailbox,

872
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,520
 which is the whole point of writing a letter to someone

873
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,760
 is that it's a nice thing to do, because it is a bit of trouble.

874
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,560
 Have you guys heard of the Muslim?

875
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,960
 It's an Urdu language newspaper.

876
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,520
 It's probably the world's only remaining newspaper

877
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,880
 that's completely handwritten.

878
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,880
 Wow.

879
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,200
 It's daily newspaper.

880
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,720
 It's only about like four pages.

881
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,440
 It's four pages long and it takes three hours.

882
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:34,240
 Circulation remains a difficult matter for them.

883
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,840
 Circulation, 22,000 subscribers in 2008.

884
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,280
 But yeah, four pages long, but they leave a blank space

885
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,800
 on the front page in case of any breaking news.

886
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,640
 Right.

887
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,080
 So there's an editor in America called Horace Greeley

888
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,240
 and he wants sent a note to the Iowa Press Association.

889
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:50,040
 The start of it went, "I have waited till long awaiting

890
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,960
 "would be discertious, only to find that I cannot attend

891
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,160
 "your press meeting next June as I would like to do."

892
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:59,120
 But his handwriting was so bad that they thought it said,

893
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,840
 "I have wondered all along whether any squirt

894
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,760
 "had denied the scandal about the president meeting Jane

895
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,400
 "in the woods on Saturday."

896
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,800
 Wow.

897
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,440
 That's pretty bad handwriting, isn't it?

898
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,400
 The end of this letter went, "I feel obliged

899
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,880
 "to decline any invitation that takes me away

900
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,680
 "a day's journey from home."

901
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:18,840
 But they thought it said, "Any insinuation that brick ovens

902
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:21,320
 "are dangerous to ham's gives me the horrors."

903
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,400
 (laughing)

904
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,520
 Yeah, so that's why I think Parsons have very good handwriting.

905
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,680
 Yeah, this is like when I'm in Asia,

906
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:30,600
 I speak Mandarin from school, but obviously in Asia,

907
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,320
 every word has four different tones.

908
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,520
 And if you get the tones wrong,

909
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,080
 you might be saying what's the way to the shops down the road,

910
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,520
 but it comes out as the cow eats the grass

911
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,440
 and the way a meringue looks like a banana.

912
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,440
 (laughing)

913
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,240
 Something completely different.

914
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,880
 Does that mean that you have a completely different system

915
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,960
 of puns, though?

916
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:46,960
 Yeah, totally.

917
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,240
 Chinese puns are extraordinary.

918
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,200
 There was a story that they'd been banned, wasn't there?

919
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:53,520
 The Chinese government would crack down on puns?

920
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,360
 Yeah.

921
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,200
 Can you do that?

922
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,040
 I don't know.

923
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,320
 No cows had been banned from eating meringue.

924
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,160
 Also.

925
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,560
 (laughing)

926
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:03,240
 Fountain pens, they're quite interesting.

927
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,680
 You're not supposed to share fountain pens with people.

928
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:08,760
 It was like just a needle, because you...

929
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:09,600
 Because...

930
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,600
 You'll have wrong.

931
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,440
 You have a needle.

932
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,880
 (laughing)

933
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,200
 Is it because of the bodily fluids

934
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,720
 you've been writing it exactly?

935
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,760
 (laughing)

936
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,480
 It's because every person writes in unique ways,

937
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,000
 you'd imagine a bit like fingerprint,

938
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,400
 specific angle that you write out

939
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,480
 and the amount of force you use,

940
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:30,680
 mainly the nib gets sort of shaved down in a very specific way.

941
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,320
 And so if you're properly using a fountain pen

942
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,320
 and you want to be writing into the nicest way possible,

943
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,800
 don't lend your pen to someone else

944
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,520
 because then they'll shave it down in their way

945
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,560
 and you'll just end up with a horrible nib.

946
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,400
 Actually, that's true.

947
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,440
 I have learnt fountain pens to people in the past.

948
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,280
 Of course, I'm writing.

949
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,160
 And I've thought, "Oh my God."

950
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,680
 He's absolutely murdering it.

951
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,080
 I really, I really have thought that.

952
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,440
 I can imagine you have had the...

953
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,280
 Yeah, yeah.

954
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,640
 And I haven't said anything at the time, obviously.

955
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,680
 (laughing)

956
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,520
 Should we wrap up?

957
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,280
 Just a cool thing.

958
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,120
 Yeah.

959
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,920
 So in medieval times, you would use a scriptor,

960
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,600
 you would write in a scriptorium

961
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,760
 as in monks were copying out books.

962
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,600
 Yes.

963
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:05,840
 And some texts, we only know their history

964
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:09,520
 because of mistakes that got in somewhere along the train

965
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,720
 of being repeated, you know, you make a text.

966
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,560
 Ah, yeah.

967
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:15,760
 And that is similar to the way the enigma codes were broken

968
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,400
 because when people made mistakes in texts,

969
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:21,680
 that allowed the guys at blechly some way in.

970
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,520
 Yeah.

971
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,760
 Yeah, when there was some difference.

972
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,760
 Isn't that amazing?

973
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:25,600
 Yeah.

974
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,120
 The difference between medieval and, you know,

975
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,320
 am I, whatever it was in the war?

976
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,560
 Just on mistakes, actually.

977
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:34,880
 It's the Sepha Torah, a special type of copy of the Torah,

978
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,040
 which is handwritten with a quill.

979
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,160
 You're not allowed to make mistakes in any of them.

980
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,920
 If you make a mistake on most words,

981
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,240
 then if you're able to scratch it out

982
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,080
 and carry on that to OK.

983
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,480
 But if you misspell God's name,

984
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,200
 or make a mistake in writing God's name,

985
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,440
 you have to cut out the entire page and bury it,

986
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,440
 and then sew in a new page and start again.

987
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,520
 It's pretty hard to misspell God.

988
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,240
 It's not in English, obviously.

989
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,920
 And then dog set off, of course.

990
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,920
 Yeah.

991
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:59,400
 (upbeat music)

992
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,480
 OK, that's it.

993
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,400
 That's all of our facts.

994
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,680
