00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.480
 (stuttering in foreign language)

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.060
 (upbeat music)

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:16.160
 - Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.600
 as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.080
 from the QI offices in Covenant Garden.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.160
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.600
 I'm sitting here with James Harkin, Andy Murray,

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.560
 and Alex Bell.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.720
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.400
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.720
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.120
 Starting with my facts, and my fact this week

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.520
 is that according to the diary of the first chief of MI6,

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.720
 this is how the first day went.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.760
 Went to the office, saw no one,

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.120
 nor was there anything to do there.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.200
 - And that was the first day of proper spying in Britain.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.440
 - Yeah, when is that because the spies were so good,

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.280
 he couldn't fight.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.120
 (laughing)

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.400
 - In, there were seven lampstands.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.320
 - So, who was this?

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.280
 - Mansfield coming.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.720
 He's the founding chief of MI6.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.200
 This was in the year 1909, I believe.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.720
 And he's someone we've mentioned very briefly

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.160
 ages ago on this podcast.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.640
 He's the guy who used to, when he was recruiting people

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.160
 in MI6, would stab a knife into his leg

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.280
 in order to see what the reaction of the person

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.600
 he was interviewing would be.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.880
 - You've missed out a very important bit of that segment.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.800
 - Which is that he had a wooden leg.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.200
 (laughing)

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.040
 Very good point.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.200
 And it's a trick you really have to get right, isn't it?

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.720
 It can't make a mistake.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.800
 - He had a wooden leg because he lost his first leg,

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.680
 having stabbed himself so many times.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.760
 (laughing)

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.080
 - Yeah, he said to have gone,

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.800
 'cause it was quite hard to walk around with a wooden leg.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:41.800
 And he wasn't born with it.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.120
 It was later in life, but he used to go around.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.960
 - Screw you.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:44.800
 (laughing)

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:45.640
 - Oh, sorry.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.520
 (laughing)

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.200
 - Tragically Pinocchio was born with a wooden everything.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.840
 (laughing)

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.120
 - But he's an amazing character.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.960
 - Matt's you're coming.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.720
 He's everything that you would hope for in the founder of...

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.080
 - It's so British eccentricity.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.640
 He's like Inspector Clueso.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.640
 All the stories you really have.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.120
 - Favourite British eccentricity.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.960
 Inspector.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.120
 (laughing)

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.400
 - Oh my god, so eccentric.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.560
 He didn't even have British nationality.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.040
 (laughing)

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.880
 - Oh no.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.640
 - Before he joined, he was in boom defense.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.480
 - Yes, yeah.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.000
 - Which is defense of the sea.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.760
 The coastline, sort of putting huge piles into the sea.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.000
 - Huge, nets, nets and all sorts of traps

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 and spotting devices and things like that.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 And the man who was setting up the secret service

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.880
 called A.E. Bethel, wrote to him,

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.480
 saying, my dear man, you're coming.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.240
 Boom, defense must be getting a bit stale with you.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.320
 You may therefore perhaps like a new billet.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.160
 If so, I have something good I can offer you.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.600
 - What a cool way of saying, do you want to be...

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:44.440
 - Dot, dot, dot.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.440
 - Just by master.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.560
 - And he was really reluctant.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.400
 - He was living on a narrow boat at the time.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.600
 He was coming up to retirement age anyway.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.840
 And he kept sort of going,

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.760
 I really like making these boom nets.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:55.600
 (laughing)

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.440
 And he just keeps asking,

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:57.960
 is like, could I do the boom netting thing

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.120
 at the same time, is that a possibility?

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.560
 - Do you think that he would spend all his days

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.200
 in a my six day dreaming of being not a spy,

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.160
 whereas what everyone else would day dream about being a spy?

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.000
 - Oh right.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.240
 - You're dreaming of getting a tap on the shoulder

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.840
 and saying, would you like to not be a spy?

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:11.680
 (laughing)

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.000
 - What's really weird is that he lived on a narrow boat

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.040
 before then, he was in the Navy.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.120
 And he had to leave because he got really seasick.

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.720
 But then he went to live on a boat.

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:18.560
 - Oh, right.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:19.400
 - Wow.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.360
 - Not many waves and tides on a canal though, is that right?

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.240
 - I'd say even fewer on the land though.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.520
 - That's true, yeah.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.280
 - An interesting thing about spies,

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.480
 in the first correspondence,

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.160
 where they're talking about the spies,

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.000
 they're not referred to by the word spies,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.080
 they're referred to by the word scallywags,

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.280
 because they used to recruit people.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.960
 It was different to the romantic notion

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.520
 we have of this James Bond character.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.280
 It was all about any kind of common criminal

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.240
 that you might be able to find overseas

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.560
 who'd be up for doing some spying for you.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.280
 The word scallywags was used in the war

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.080
 to refer to people who would kind of do very, very small things

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.880
 to put off any invaders,

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.040
 so like turning signs round or that kind of thing.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.880
 - I know something about them.

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.320
 I think we did this on the show actually,

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.360
 is that private Godfrey from Dad's Army

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.200
 was in a group called the Scallywags in the Second World War,

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.480
 which was devoted to sabotage

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.960
 of any potential German invasion.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.760
 And they were given arms,

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.920
 they were given the ingredients to make bombs,

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.400
 they were given instructions for how to set up

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.200
 razor wire tracks across roads.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.520
 It really was pretty unpleasant,

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:18.920
 the stuff that they were prepared to do

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.080
 in the event of an invasion.

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:21.080
 Yeah, of course.

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:23.240
 - So do you guys know about all the other MIs?

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.400
 Because they're in 19 of them,

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.240
 although they were.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.240
 Yeah, it's amazing.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.000
 Okay, so there was, for example,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.600
 MI1 was coat and ciphers,

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.720
 and that's now GCHQ.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:31.680
 So some of them still exist,

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:32.680
 but they're under different names.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.440
 They've been subsumed, you know, glazing and stuff like that.

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.400
 My favorite ones are MI4,

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.080
 which was the geographical section,

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.600
 so maps, they just dealt with maps.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.560
 MI7, which was press and propaganda,

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:44.280
 which was kind of interesting.

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.760
 And MI16, which is scientific intelligence,

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.400
 that was formed in 1945.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.320
 During the Scottish independence debate,

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.440
 it was revealed that there's still money going into MI16.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:54.440
 So it still exists.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:55.280
 How cool is that?

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.800
 - But then it is just scientists.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.200
 I reckon you got to a party and go,

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.680
 "Oh, yeah, actually, I work for MI16."

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.520
 (laughing)

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:04.920
 - There's no MI13 though.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:05.760
 - There's no, no.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:06.840
 - No, it's not because it's paddling.

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:07.680
 - Well, I don't know.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:08.800
 There are a couple that never existed.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:09.760
 So for some reason, I mean,

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.000
 MI8 was only used in fiction, apparently.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.160
 But then why would you not just use all the numbers?

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.720
 It's really odd that they missed out a couple.

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:16.680
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.800
 - So the correct name for MI6 is the SIS,

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.600
 which is a secret intelligence service.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:22.440
 - Yes.

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.440
 - It was originally known as a secret service bureau.

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.440
 And that was known as either the SS bureau,

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.480
 or sometimes just the SS.

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.200
 - Ooh, it's done in a fashion now.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.040
 - Do you want to know something else

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.120
 that's really cool about Mansfield coming?

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.280
 - I think that he invented the method

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.760
 of spies driving up to someone and saying, "Get in."

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.720
 - So before that, people would just stand there

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.560
 when the car got there and go, "Well, what do you want me to do?"

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:47.760
 - I don't know.

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.040
 - So basically, he would drive to meet people, right?

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.600
 But he thought that they would have associates

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.000
 who would be waiting to photograph you

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.600
 or that they would be waiting to, you know,

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.760
 cost you or whatever.

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:59.280
 So he said, "Drive past the rendezvous on the opposite side,

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.520
 and once you've spotted the target, and I'm quoting here,

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.160
 drive up close to him, open the door, and invite him in.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.760
 I lean back the moment I've caught his eye,

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:08.600
 and from then on, I do not show myself at all."

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.240
 - This is another bit from his diary.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.160
 - Surely we cannot be expected to sit in the office month

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.040
 by month doing absolutely nothing.

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.680
 There was just nothing to do.

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.480
 And then on the 14th and 15th of October,

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:25.200
 his diary then again reads, "Office all day, no one appeared."

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.360
 - I heard it was just an office rented in the name

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.280
 of a private detective called Mr. Drew.

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:31.120
 - Yes.

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:31.960
 - Victorious Dread.

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:32.800
 - And then the next office as well,

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.200
 or one of the later offices was under another pseudonym.

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.200
 - There was one that was 54 Broadway.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.480
 They had that between 1926 and 1964.

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:43.680
 But the sign outside said,

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:46.960
 "It was the Mini-Max Fire Extinguisher Company."

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:47.800
 - Wow.

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.200
 - And that was actually MI6.

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:53.800
 And when they eventually sold that property to buy a new one,

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.880
 they realized that people were coming round to view it.

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:57.400
 And one of the people who came to view

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.160
 was a Russian trade delegation.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.000
 (laughing)

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:00.840
 - They had to quickly go around

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.680
 and take all the maps off the walls, yeah.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.280
 - That was amazing.

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:08.040
 There's also a very another exciting character

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:10.720
 who was recruited by Mansfield Cumming,

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:12.920
 which was a man called Thomas Merton.

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:14.960
 He was the original cue.

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:16.200
 He was the gadget man.

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:19.760
 Yeah, he worked out how they could create an invisible ink

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:21.520
 for writing, because up until then,

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.600
 they'd been experimenting with using semen,

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.280
 which I think is quite well known, right?

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:26.840
 - Yeah, Mansfield Cumming said

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:29.280
 that he thought the best invisible ink was semen.

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:30.120
 - Yeah.

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:31.600
 - The advantage of using bodily fluids

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.960
 is that if you were found in possession of them,

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:35.560
 they weren't incriminating.

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:37.920
 - If you're in a bottle, I think it's more incriminating.

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:42.920
 - No, the idea is that spies had been convicted

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.680
 and sentenced to death because they'd been found

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:47.600
 with lemon juice and stuff like that,

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.680
 'cause they say, "Why would you have lemon juice on you?"

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:51.040
 - I think why do you have semen on you?

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:53.280
 It's still a good question for us, it's not one.

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:54.280
 (laughing)

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:56.040
 - Is this anything to do with Cumming?

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:57.840
 (laughing)

00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:58.680
 - That's amazing.

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:02.480
 - The agent who discovered that you can use semen

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:04.520
 as invisible ink apparently had to transfer

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:06.360
 to another department after he was teased

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.280
 so much by other staff members.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:10.200
 (laughing)

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:11.760
 So bad, that's it.

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:15.120
 And apparently there was one officer in Copenhagen

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.960
 who took the discovery so seriously

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:21.480
 that he stocked a whole load of invisible ink in his office

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:25.000
 and it began to smell so badly that other agent said to him,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.600
 "You should use fresh every time you want to write a letter

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:29.480
 "and rather than saving it."

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:30.640
 - Oh my God.

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:31.840
 You have to really take someone aside

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:35.120
 to acquire one of the rooms, tell them that then.

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:38.800
 - So I'm surprised that in all the stuff

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:39.920
 that I read of Mansfield coming,

00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:41.880
 I've only read this in one spot probably,

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:46.720
 but Rasputin's death was off the back of Mansfield coming.

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:47.560
 - Supposedly.

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:50.680
 - Yeah, I think the word British might have evolved

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:52.720
 somehow in his death definitely.

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:55.120
 They poisoned him and he sort of ate all the poison

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:56.920
 and then he laughed and he had it having a great time

00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:58.920
 and then they beat him up and then they shot him

00:08:58.920 --> 00:08:59.760
 a couple of times.

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:00.600
 He still didn't die.

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:03.560
 - I think I read was they smashed his testicles flat.

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:05.360
 - Terrible.

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:07.840
 - You won't be writing any more invisible ink letters

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:09.000
 off of this, will you?

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.720
 (laughing)

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:13.240
 (upbeat music)

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:17.440
 - Okay, time for fact number two and that is James.

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:20.120
 - Okay, my fact this week is that there is a distillery

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:23.320
 in Kentucky that claims that playing Bruce Springsteen

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:26.800
 to the whiskey improves the aging process.

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:29.120
 - Is that because of Bruce Springsteen going through

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:32.120
 the aging process himself and he knows what it's like?

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:33.840
 - Therefore he can teach the whiskey.

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.840
 - It'd be nice to be that but no, sadly not.

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:38.960
 It is the vibrations they think.

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:40.760
 - But specifically Bruce Springsteen.

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:44.040
 - No, it's just any old music but I think being in Kentucky

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:46.240
 that's just the kind of rock they like.

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:48.440
 - Plus it being dad rock, it just naturally ages

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:49.800
 anything that listens to it.

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:52.360
 (laughing)

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:55.160
 - So this will be Bobham because it's in Kentucky

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.280
 but when you make any kind of whiskey like this,

00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:00.040
 the way that ages is they put it in barrels

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:03.440
 and then the liquor inside the barrel will go

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:05.680
 in and out of the pores of the wood

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:07.880
 and that will give it it's kind of woody taste

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:09.720
 and it will age it in that way.

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:11.320
 And they think that by bracing it,

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:13.880
 it will slosh the liquid around a bit more

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:15.880
 which will make it age quicker.

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:18.840
 It seems like it probably does work to a certain extent.

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:20.320
 - It's really cool the way that whiskey distilleries

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:22.720
 make drinks that might not actually hit the market

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:25.320
 until after the founders are either retired or dead.

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:28.720
 So there are 70 year old whiskeys which go on sale.

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:32.240
 - Yeah, and this is something that they made 70 years ago.

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:33.080
 What was that?

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:36.600
 70 years ago from now that's 1945.

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:38.920
 Why don't know how much whiskey they were making in 1945

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:41.920
 and other things of the mind, but yeah, it's just incredible.

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:43.760
 - Yeah, it's really interesting as well

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:45.960
 the relationship between the whiskey and the barrel

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:48.640
 because obviously the, like you say,

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:50.320
 the essence of the barrel goes into the whiskey

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:51.480
 but it happens all the way around as well.

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:54.520
 So the barrels in which Jack Daniel's Tennessee whiskey

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:58.920
 is aged are reused afterwards to age to basco sauce.

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:00.640
 - I think they also sell the barrels

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:02.400
 over to scotch companies as well.

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:03.240
 - Yes, I do.

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:04.760
 I've been to the Jack Daniel's Distillery.

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:05.600
 - How do you do?

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.840
 - In Tennessee and a fact about it is that it's a dry county.

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:11.920
 You're not allowed to buy alcohol there.

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:12.760
 - Wow.

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:14.360
 - There's a special sort of dispensation.

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:16.960
 So you can, I think you can buy a souvenir bottle

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:18.440
 but you're not allowed to actually drink it

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:21.800
 until you're over the border out of that particular county.

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:24.280
 - Yeah, it's amazing the relationship of music

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:27.440
 and alcohol so there was a report done,

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:29.720
 a research report by guy called Professor North

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:31.800
 who found that people were five times more likely

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:33.560
 to buy French wine than German wine

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:35.800
 if a accordion music was playing in the background.

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:36.640
 - What?

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:37.480
 - Yeah.

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:38.640
 - What about if there was umpah music?

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:39.480
 - Umpah.

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:40.320
 - No way.

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:42.040
 - Umpah band was played the German product

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:44.040
 outsold the French by two to one.

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:44.880
 - With two to one?

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:47.640
 - I can't believe that the effect is substantial.

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:49.680
 - People are so impressionable.

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:51.280
 - There was a study done quite recently

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:55.400
 about the best environment to drink whiskey.

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:57.080
 They had people drinking it in a...

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.600
 - Oh, it's on your own, isn't it?

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.440
 (laughing)

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:02.480
 It's um, you just stare at the wall.

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:03.960
 - Yeah, and you're on the pants.

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:06.280
 (laughing)

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:08.120
 - Sorry.

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:11.040
 - They had a grassy room with a turf floor

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:13.040
 and the bar in the sheep

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:14.600
 and the smell of freshly cut grass.

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:15.600
 - Just do it outside.

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:17.240
 (laughing)

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:18.240
 - Oh, that's the best new room.

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:20.120
 Unfortunately, there's no other room in existence

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:21.880
 than anyone can drink that in.

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:22.720
 (laughing)

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:23.560
 - That's one.

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:25.120
 The other one is a sweet room,

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:27.160
 which was filled with a sweet fragrance,

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:28.480
 rounded red objects,

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:30.480
 and a high-pitched tinkling sound.

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:31.520
 (laughing)

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:33.440
 And then the last one was a woody room

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:35.320
 with wood paneling and floorboards.

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:38.080
 The sounds of leaves crunching and log fires

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:39.720
 and the smell of cedar wood.

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:41.400
 And the wooden one was by far

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:44.120
 what people enjoyed the most in the wooden room.

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:44.960
 - Wow.

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:45.800
 The woody room.

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:46.640
 - The woody room, yeah.

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:47.480
 - Cool.

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:49.080
 - Um, this, you know, this report I was just talking

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:52.200
 about different tastes of wine and match to music.

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:55.320
 They actually released a playlist of the types of music

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:57.920
 you should listen to to the different wines.

00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:59.680
 So when you're drinking a Marlowe.

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:01.280
 - Oh, by my side.

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:03.720
 (laughing)

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:05.760
 - Just, I'll repeat five hundred times.

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:08.560
 (laughing)

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:09.800
 - If you're drinking a Marlowe,

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:11.800
 sitting on the dock of the bay by Otis Redding.

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:12.640
 - Okay.

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:14.520
 - Easy by Lionel Richey.

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:15.880
 - Over the rainbow by Eva Cassidy.

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:17.520
 - None of those are French songs.

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:20.880
 - No, these are, this was the French

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:24.240
 and German wine tasting was about what you buy

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:25.080
 in a supermarket.

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:27.440
 This is about how it actually tastes better.

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:30.200
 - I understand, but how does it affect the taste?

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:33.600
 - Okay, so what he says is that they did a study

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:36.080
 with over 250 university students.

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:37.800
 They played them various different bits of music

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:40.680
 and they all reported back that a certain type of music

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:43.480
 absolutely tasted way better than if they heard it

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:44.480
 with more wine.

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:46.840
 - I can imagine if you have kind of a more smooth tasting wine

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:48.760
 than you want more smooth kind of music.

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:49.600
 - Yeah.

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:50.440
 - That kind of makes sense.

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:52.160
 - I can imagine students just trying to find some correlation

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:54.920
 to play on so that they just get given more free wine.

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:56.080
 (laughing)

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:56.920
 - I'm gonna need to hear another one of them.

00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:57.920
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:13:57.920 --> 00:13:59.520
 - Let's try it again.

00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:00.360
 - I think I'm sporting a pattern.

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:01.880
 I think we should continue, guys.

00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:04.440
 - Chardonnay had what's love got to do with it.

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:06.400
 Tina Turner, spinning around by Kylie Manot

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:08.120
 and rock DJ by Robbie Williams.

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:11.200
 That's what Chardonnay tastes best with.

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:14.240
 This research, by the way, was carried out by a wine maker

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:19.240
 from Chile who himself plays monastic chance

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:21.440
 to his maturing wines.

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:22.280
 - Does he?

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:23.120
 - Yeah, okay.

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:25.040
 - So that's his choice, no spring steam.

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:27.080
 - Okay, so there was a whiskey,

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:28.720
 Bob and whiskey in America,

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:32.240
 where the warehouse where it was held was hit by a tornado.

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:33.840
 And basically the whole of the house

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:35.720
 was almost ripped to smithereens.

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:37.440
 But the barrels were kind of left,

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:38.640
 more or less where they were.

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:40.280
 Apparently when they tried the whiskey,

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:42.040
 it was absolutely amazing.

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:44.920
 And it's called tornado surviving whiskey.

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:47.680
 And it's superior to the usual product, they say.

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:50.600
 - I would say that too if I had an enormous bill of damage

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:51.440
 to read that.

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:55.960
 This whiskey is suddenly quadrupled in value.

00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:56.800
 Wow, oh god.

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:58.760
 Well, I mean, that's something, I suppose.

00:14:58.760 --> 00:14:59.600
 - Yeah.

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:03.000
 And there's another company called Ocean Aged Bourbon

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.440
 who take their whiskey

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:08.640
 and then put it on a boat, send it out to sea for four years

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:10.840
 and when it comes back, apparently it tastes not better.

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:12.920
 - I think this is all nonsense.

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:15.160
 - I know it sounds like it sounds like it's not true,

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:16.920
 but there is a little bit of science behind it.

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:18.960
 The more that it kind of slushes against the word,

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.400
 the more it will react to it.

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:21.560
 They really do believe it.

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:23.600
 Like the whiskey maker's really believe it.

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:25.120
 - If you go on the internet,

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:28.400
 you can find a nice advert for whiskey toothpaste.

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:29.240
 - Wow.

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:30.080
 - Don't even know if it's real,

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:31.960
 but the advert seems to be there.

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:35.400
 It's 6% proof, scotch bourbon whiskey.

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:36.560
 And the advert says,

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:38.320
 "Why fight oral hygiene?"

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:39.640
 Enjoy it.

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:41.960
 Here's real he-man toothpaste.

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:45.080
 Best argument yet for brushing three times a day.

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:46.360
 - It's also a fantastic excuse

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:48.480
 for turning up at work, smelling of whiskey.

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:49.320
 (laughing)

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:51.360
 - No, no, no, that's my good taste.

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:54.120
 (upbeat music)

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:58.600
 - Okay, time for fact number three and that is Alex Bell.

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:00.840
 - Okay, my fact is that there is a statue

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:02.920
 of Nicola Tesla in Silicon Valley

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:05.000
 that radiates free Wi-Fi.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:05.840
 - Cool.

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:06.680
 - It's cool, isn't it?

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:07.520
 - That is what he would have wanted.

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:08.360
 - It is, yeah.

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:11.760
 - It's him holding a sort of giant wireless light bulb

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:13.840
 and the light bulb sort of goes off Wi-Fi.

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:14.960
 - As a kickstarter project.

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:15.960
 - I've seen the drawings of it.

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:16.800
 I have to say in the drawings,

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:18.920
 they don't quite get the light bulb right in his hand.

00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:20.280
 It looks like a big ping pong bag.

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:21.120
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:22.120
 - It does look a bit weird.

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:23.680
 - Yeah, and it's like, yeah,

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:25.800
 it's quite an odd thing for him to be holding as well,

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:27.520
 but we should say who Tesla was.

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:28.360
 - Yeah.

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:31.280
 - He was known as the man who invented the 20th century.

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:32.120
 - Yeah.

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:32.960
 - As in before Tesla.

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:34.120
 - It was the 19th century.

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:35.680
 (laughing)

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:37.760
 - He was born on the first century in 1900.

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:39.400
 He was born 1856.

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:40.240
 - Okay.

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:43.040
 - He was born into a lightning storm, a fierce lightning storm,

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:45.240
 according to this, his family legend,

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:47.960
 and midway through the birth, the midwife said

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:50.040
 that the lightning was a bad omen.

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:51.720
 And she said that he'll be a child of darkness.

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:54.440
 And the mother said, no, he will be a child of light.

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:57.400
 That definitely sounds like a driving ride thing there.

00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:00.840
 And so Tesla was this fantastic scientist,

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:02.000
 very, very eccentric man.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.440
 We talked about him a bit on the podcast and QI.

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:07.400
 He was, he invented, among other things,

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:10.080
 we talked about the death rate he invented on the podcast.

00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:12.880
 - The main thing he invented was the AC polyphase system,

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:15.640
 which does not sound sexy, but it was unbelievable.

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:17.840
 So before Tesla, you could pump up,

00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:20.720
 you could transport electricity one mile before Tesla.

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:21.880
 And even then you could only use it

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:24.120
 for lighting up light bulbs and things.

00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:27.400
 Thanks to his system, you can transmit it hundreds of miles

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:29.040
 and use it for industrial machinery.

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:32.480
 I mean, it made electricity into a viable technology

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:33.600
 which could span the world.

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:35.480
 - I run it that he's now a wife, I think,

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:37.360
 that probably goes about two meters.

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:39.320
 (laughing)

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:40.160
 - Yeah.

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:42.240
 He was a big whiskey-efficient, I don't actually think.

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:43.080
 - What's he talking whiskey?

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:44.320
 Yeah, he drank it every day

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:46.160
 and he thought that he would live to 150

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:47.000
 by drinking it.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:47.840
 - Well, try.

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:48.840
 - Prohibition came along

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:51.200
 and he was not a fan of Prohibition at all because of this,

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:52.560
 but he went along with it anyway

00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:55.560
 and decided that he was now only going to live to 130

00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:57.360
 because he was no longer drinking whiskey.

00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:59.320
 He lived to 86, I think, yeah.

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:00.160
 - That's pretty good.

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:01.000
 - Pretty good.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.840
 - Yeah, but he's a long way off his prediction, isn't he?

00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:03.680
 - Yeah, that's true.

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:05.320
 - Well, Prohibition, he probably couldn't factor

00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:07.040
 in how many years has that actually happened?

00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:09.880
 - The last mathematician, I think it was Cardano,

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:10.800
 but it might not have been him,

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:12.000
 but it was one of the people around

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.600
 at the same time as him around the Renaissance.

00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:18.000
 That predicted exactly the day he was going to die

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.160
 and told everyone this was the day he was going to die

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:21.640
 and he was exactly right.

00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:23.600
 But a lot of people think he probably killed himself.

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:24.960
 - To prove himself right.

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:26.440
 - Ah, yeah.

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:27.960
 - I was looking at some other statues as well.

00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:28.800
 - Oh yeah.

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:31.520
 - The statue of Winston Churchill in Parliament Square.

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:34.080
 There's a myth that it's electrified

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:36.320
 to say that Pigeon's no one around on it,

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:38.760
 but I looked it up and I found a new scientist article

00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:41.320
 that says that they thought about it, they didn't do it.

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:44.760
 - Yeah, they also thought about inserting pins

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:47.160
 that would stand out at the top of his head

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:48.680
 intending to stop the birds as well.

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:50.000
 - So that's the standard way of stopping Pigeon?

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.680
 - Yeah, but they just thought that would look really weird,

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:52.920
 like he had a punk hairdo.

00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:53.760
 - Yeah.

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:54.600
 - So also the top of his head.

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:56.040
 - It's really subtle, though the risk you'll just end up

00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:57.560
 with a dead Pigeon.

00:18:57.560 --> 00:18:58.720
 - That's right, yeah.

00:18:58.720 --> 00:18:59.840
 - Yeah, with Winston Churchill's head.

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:03.280
 - But also the location of where the statue stands

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:06.440
 is located in a spot that in the '50s

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:08.200
 used to be referred to by Churchill

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:11.200
 as where my statue will go in the exact spot.

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:12.040
 - Really?

00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:12.960
 - Yeah, so that's he would constantly say that

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:13.800
 if ever they passed.

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:15.920
 He would say that's where my statue will go.

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:17.360
 And that's where it did.

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:18.560
 - He was successful in his life,

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:21.080
 but I mean, that's quite a presumption to make for anyone.

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:21.920
 - Yeah, I don't know.

00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:23.640
 - Just to walk you the park, loudly proclaiming,

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:24.640
 that's where my statue will go.

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:26.440
 - Well, as long as you don't say it everywhere you go

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:28.240
 and you help to win the Second World War.

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:29.080
 - Yeah, I don't know.

00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:30.080
 I'd be inclined to give him a statue.

00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:30.920
 - Well, towards the end there,

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:33.200
 he got voted out and people weren't particularly happy with it.

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:34.800
 - He got voted out immediately afterwards.

00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:36.000
 - Yeah, he got voted back in.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:36.840
 - At the age of 80.

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:37.920
 - He was elected prime minister.

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:39.280
 - Yeah, amazing.

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:43.280
 - There's a mysterious statue in Budapest of Colombo.

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:46.560
 - I'm Detective Peter Falk, yeah.

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:48.920
 - Not the guy who discovered the clitoris.

00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:51.160
 - No, that's a call back.

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:54.440
 - That's a call back to an episode between 1555

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:56.240
 that anyone wants to have a listen.

00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:59.880
 Yeah, there's a slightly mysterious Peter Falk statue

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:02.160
 sitting in a street in Budapest.

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:04.120
 No one's quite sure why it's there.

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:06.040
 It was built about three years after his death.

00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:07.200
 It just suddenly was there.

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:09.760
 They think it was a hungarian politician.

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:10.760
 - Do you think maybe you went there

00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:11.760
 on holiday once and when?

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:13.360
 That's where my statue's gonna go.

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:14.520
 (laughing)

00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:15.600
 - Yes, exactly.

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:18.320
 - So he did, he's known to have had hungarian roots

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:20.160
 through his grandparents side.

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:22.720
 But yeah, there's no actual link.

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:24.280
 No one's quite sure why it's there.

00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:26.200
 - There's the world's smallest sculpture

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:27.520
 by a guy called John T. Hurwitz.

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:29.000
 It was unveiled earlier this year

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.840
 and it was almost, it was less than,

00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:32.320
 it was less than one millimeter tall

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:34.040
 and was almost immediately destroyed

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:35.360
 when the photographer accidentally crushed it

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:36.200
 with his finger.

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:38.120
 - No, yeah, really.

00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:42.640
 It was being photographed standing inside the eye of a needle.

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:44.960
 - There was a museum in Bath called the Impossible Micro World

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:47.520
 which was the most fantastic museum and it closed down.

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:49.800
 But it's amazing, this amazing guy called Willard Wicken

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:50.640
 who makes these things.

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:54.480
 And he's done so as a sculpture of a horse dancing

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:56.480
 on the head of an actual ant.

00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:57.320
 - Wow.

00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:58.160
 - All the exhibits in the museum,

00:20:58.160 --> 00:20:59.000
 you had to go through.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:20:59.840
 I went when I was a--

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:00.800
 - The museum normal size.

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:03.240
 So I was going to, it wasn't closed down

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:06.560
 when someone accidentally stood down and got something.

00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:09.600
 - Every exhibit you had to look at through a magnifier,

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:10.440
 basically.

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:11.440
 - Wow.

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:14.360
 - And this guy, he has to slow down his heartbeat

00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:17.600
 in order to make the cuts necessary

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:18.720
 on the thing he's sculpting.

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:21.480
 So he slows it right down, look through the binoculars

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:22.720
 or the magnifier or the microscope,

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:25.040
 whatever he's using, waits for a heartbeat,

00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:26.640
 makes the cut on the thing,

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:28.280
 then the next heartbeat happens.

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:30.280
 - It's just incredible that his hands were so unshaky

00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:32.640
 that his heartbeat could have affected how shaky they were.

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:34.000
 I mean, if I try to do something,

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.560
 my hands are way shaky than what is being affected

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:37.400
 by my heartbeat.

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:38.400
 - Yes, but you drink very heavy, too.

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:40.800
 - I don't know if it's whiskey, yeah.

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:42.040
 - Do you want to hear some facts about Wi-Fi?

00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:43.720
 - Yes, please Andy.

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:44.560
 - Okay.

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:46.040
 - So, this is cool.

00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:49.880
 There's an Israeli theme park called Ka-Dem, right?

00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:51.560
 And it's a traditional theme park

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:53.400
 for people who want to experience life

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:55.640
 as it was in Galilee 2000 years ago, right?

00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:57.320
 If people get bored, I presume,

00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:59.280
 or want to check their phones.

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:02.200
 They have donkeys walking around with Wi-Fi hotspots on them.

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:03.040
 - Oh, wow.

00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:04.440
 - But the thing is they have 30 donkeys,

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:06.880
 and only five of the donkeys are actually carrying Wi-Fi hotspots.

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:10.080
 So there's only one in six chunks that you're donkey.

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:11.880
 - Do you spend ages trying to connect to that one?

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:13.920
 - So you run a donkey and then you say,

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:16.040
 "No, not this one, they've got another donkey."

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:17.640
 - How to imagine anyone getting bored

00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:21.800
 at a theme park which recreates 2000 years old Israel?

00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:23.400
 It's just really difficult.

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:26.560
 When you were talking about running around finding donkeys,

00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:28.600
 this just reminded me of something that Alex told us

00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:31.920
 just before we walked in about the...

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:35.040
 Is like a children's playground following you around?

00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:37.920
 - Oh yeah, I just saw this video on BBC News.

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:40.200
 Some of you know, these random science products

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:42.160
 they get made for seemingly no reason.

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:45.200
 A guy has created a climbing frame

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:47.360
 that wonders around parks,

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:48.800
 looking for children to play on it.

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:51.400
 But it just sounds like the most ridiculous

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:53.240
 and also predatory thing.

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:54.080
 - Well, they've done it to say,

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:57.240
 "I've spliced the jeans of a climbing frame and a pedophile."

00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:00.240
 (laughing)

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:01.080
 - It's absolutely horrendous.

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:02.840
 The idea is going to get children used

00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:04.560
 to the idea of robotics in real life.

00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:06.080
 - Does it move if you're climbing on it?

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:06.920
 Or does it stop?

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:09.520
 - I don't know, I mean, it sounds incredibly dangerous.

00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:11.040
 - It doesn't matter, it's an academic question

00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:13.560
 because no child will ever climb on this thing.

00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:15.560
 - I don't think they have any choice.

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:17.080
 - I mean, I should say, it's very slow.

00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:19.480
 It doesn't like gallop around or anything like that.

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:22.280
 - Can I talk about the sort of invention of a Wi-Fi for seconds?

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:24.080
 - I want to show around to ages, and I'm going to have a chance.

00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:26.200
 Okay, you can't say this at home,

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:27.600
 but there are slides coming out.

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:30.520
 (all laughing)

00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:31.920
 - Helen Lamar, which is very glamorous films

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:33.760
 done in America, '30s and '40s.

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:36.240
 She was one time dubbed the world most beautiful woman,

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:38.120
 but she was also this fantastic scientist as well.

00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:38.960
 When the war broke out,

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:40.720
 she applied to the National Inventors Guild

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:42.960
 but was rejected many because she was a woman

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:43.960
 and people didn't take her seriously.

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:45.800
 And then she was encouraged to use her celebrity

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:47.000
 and beauty to sell warboms,

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.520
 which she did a little bit.

00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:50.680
 But she got started inventing things herself.

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:51.960
 She got together with her neighbor,

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:54.040
 who was a composer called George Antile,

00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:55.680
 and they built a machine called

00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:58.080
 a frequency-hopping spread spectrum.

00:23:58.080 --> 00:23:59.880
 Basically, the problem with torpedoes at that time

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:01.160
 was that they were remote controlled,

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:03.560
 so they were kept on causing a radio signal transmitted

00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:06.640
 from the ship, but that signal could be easily blocked.

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:08.720
 And Lamar and Antile developed this improved system

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:11.080
 that allowed a radio signal to jump up and down frequencies

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:12.520
 randomly so that it couldn't be jammed.

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:14.280
 But what's really brilliant is how they did it.

00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:16.320
 You guys know what player pianos are, right?

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:17.680
 They're pianos that play themselves.

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:19.040
 They have this big role of paper music,

00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:20.240
 which has lots of holes in.

00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:22.760
 And they correspond to which notes should play and when.

00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:24.200
 The frequency-hopping spread spectrum

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:25.920
 used the mechanism from the player piano,

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:28.320
 but instead of playing 88 keys of the piano,

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:30.040
 it switched the torpedo signal

00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:31.880
 between 88 radio frequencies.

00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:34.320
 The principle of modern wireless technology is based on that.

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:36.600
 WiFi, GPS, Bluetooth, everything like that.

00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:37.880
 Wow, really amazing.

00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:38.880
 That's so cool.

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:41.040
 So Sri Lanka, the island of Sri Lanka,

00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:44.280
 is about to provide WiFi to the entire island

00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:47.320
 using a network of floating balloons,

00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:50.160
 which are going to be 12 miles up in the sky

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:51.920
 they're all solar powered and the solar power

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:53.440
 that the balloons get is going to be used

00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:56.720
 to transmit internet signals to the spot of land beneath it.

00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:59.400
 How insane is that 25,000 square miles?

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:00.240
 That's amazing.

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:01.160
 The area of the country.

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:04.440
 You know one place that I'm still trying to find this out

00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:08.200
 for certain and I can't properly find anywhere online yet

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:10.000
 that would tell me the right answer.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.280
 But certainly up until 2012, you can't get WiFi in the White House.

00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:14.800
 Wow.

00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:16.320
 Yeah, the White House has no WiFi.

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:20.880
 And like, for example, the Oval Office doesn't have a computer in it.

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:22.360
 And if you want to use a computer in it,

00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:24.960
 you have to bring in a laptop and plug in Clinton,

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:27.480
 famously apparently only sent two emails

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:28.640
 during his time as president.

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:31.360
 One was as a test.

00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:32.360
 And then the second one was--

00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:33.120
 Was the elite everything?

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:36.600
 Was the second one too spaced?

00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:37.320
 Yes, yes.

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:39.880
 Yeah, it was to John Glenn.

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:41.120
 So I don't know if he was in the--

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:43.560
 Yeah, he was in the ISS on the second trip.

00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:45.800
 John, you were hearing a lot of crazy stuff about me.

00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:46.640
 Yeah, I do.

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:48.960
 I just don't think no, none of it's true.

00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:51.920
 Mr. Clinton, we've gone through your entire five million emails

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:53.800
 and we think there's two of them we can save.

00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:58.600
 Yes.

00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:00.840
 Good news about the invisible ink you were asking about.

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:09.280
 OK, time for our final factor, the show.

00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:12.440
 And that is Andrew Hunter Murray.

00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:15.280
 My fact is that a third of people in Britain have written almost nothing

00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:17.480
 by hand in the last six months.

00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:19.160
 This makes so much sense when you think about it,

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:20.840
 but it sounds crazy when you first--

00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:21.720
 It sounds terrifying.

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:24.320
 Yeah, so this was a survey, admittedly,

00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:27.160
 by a printing and mailing company called DocMail.

00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:29.000
 But what they said was that one in three people

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.280
 had not written anything by hand for six months.

00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:34.160
 And on average, people hadn't written something for 41 days.

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:35.840
 And I think when they say written anything by hand,

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:38.480
 I mean, anything that's not a shopping list opposed to those--

00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:39.320
 Oh, signature.

00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:40.320
 They're signature.

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:41.040
 Yeah, yeah.

00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:42.840
 But when you think about it, what is there

00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:44.320
 that you need to write at length?

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:45.240
 Letters to people.

00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:49.160
 Most people don't write many letters these days, if any.

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:53.240
 I presume at school, still, you would be writing all the time.

00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:55.640
 Well, one thing about that is, apparently,

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:57.840
 if you write things down, it helps you remember them.

00:26:57.840 --> 00:26:58.360
 Yep.

00:26:58.360 --> 00:26:59.640
 You know, that makes kind of enthusiasm.

00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:01.000
 I do definitely believe that, yeah.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.600
 But actually, there's like a neurological reason for it.

00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:06.440
 Like, there are certain neural circuits

00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:08.760
 that are activated whenever you write things down.

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:11.840
 And so children who write tend to learn more quickly.

00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:14.120
 And so if you have schools where children aren't really

00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:17.360
 writing things down, then it can hamper their improvement.

00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:18.360
 Right.

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:19.200
 Wow.

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:22.760
 The other downside that we're sort of going to have in the years

00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:25.480
 to come is that all these great works of literature

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:26.480
 and everything else, we're not going

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:28.280
 to have the original handwritten notes of people

00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:30.320
 doing drafts because so much of it now is on computers.

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:32.600
 So the American Museum of Natural History

00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:33.920
 on their website, I'll tweet a link.

00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:36.400
 It's if they've got all of Darwin's papers and all his works.

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:38.120
 And it's amazing, because you can see all of his handwriting,

00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:39.080
 which is really bad.

00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:40.960
 And he's got little doodles of drawings.

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:43.240
 His kids drew pictures on the back.

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:46.200
 There's an amazing one of a fish walking on the land

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:48.200
 holding an umbrella, which I really like.

00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:51.280
 So they always see subscribed to his theory.

00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:54.120
 The opposite of calligraphy is calligraphy, bad handwriting.

00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:57.040
 Bad handwriting, that's great calligraphy.

00:27:57.040 --> 00:27:59.920
 They reckon that in like a 100 years time,

00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:03.080
 the, in fact, even neatly written hand writing

00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:05.000
 will be completely illegible to people.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.640
 Because it's like if you look at very, very old calligraphy,

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:10.160
 now you can't understand any of it.

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:11.000
 Yeah, definitely.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.840
 And then in a 100 years time, it might be only

00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:15.400
 that you can recognise time's new role men are.

00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:17.800
 Looking at say Jane Austen's letters or something,

00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:19.560
 quite actually quite difficult to decipher.

00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:20.480
 Yeah, some other words.

00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:22.480
 The guy who's credited with pretty much single-handedly

00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:25.600
 reviving modern calligraphy and penmanship

00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:29.080
 is Edward Johnston, who also is very, very big in fonts.

00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:30.800
 Not like font size.

00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:34.400
 Yeah, I mean, he creates a Johnston,

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:37.560
 and New Johnston is now the London Underground font.

00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:39.520
 And he mentored the sculptor Eric Gil.

00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:42.320
 He came up with Gil Sans, which is the BBC's official font.

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:44.280
 There's two massive institutions.

00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:47.440
 Here's another incredibly creepy company.

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:50.040
 If we'll just off the back with the playground switch,

00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:51.880
 follow it on.

00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:53.200
 There's a company which has made a robot

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:55.200
 to write handwritten letters.

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:57.440
 So basically, you write a lot of handwriting samples

00:28:57.440 --> 00:28:59.520
 and then a robot reads your handwriting samples

00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:02.120
 and can perfectly replicate your handwriting.

00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:04.680
 And they basically say that they want to retain the delight

00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:07.000
 of giving and receiving notes without the hassle

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.320
 of heading to the stationary store writing out a letter,

00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:11.520
 finding stamps and locating a mailbox,

00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:13.520
 which is the whole point of writing a letter to someone

00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:15.760
 is that it's a nice thing to do, because it is a bit of trouble.

00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:17.560
 Have you guys heard of the Muslim?

00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:19.960
 It's an Urdu language newspaper.

00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:22.520
 It's probably the world's only remaining newspaper

00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:23.880
 that's completely handwritten.

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:24.880
 Wow.

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:26.200
 It's daily newspaper.

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:27.720
 It's only about like four pages.

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:30.440
 It's four pages long and it takes three hours.

00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:34.240
 Circulation remains a difficult matter for them.

00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:36.840
 Circulation, 22,000 subscribers in 2008.

00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:39.280
 But yeah, four pages long, but they leave a blank space

00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:40.800
 on the front page in case of any breaking news.

00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:41.640
 Right.

00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:44.080
 So there's an editor in America called Horace Greeley

00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:47.240
 and he wants sent a note to the Iowa Press Association.

00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:50.040
 The start of it went, "I have waited till long awaiting

00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:52.960
 "would be discertious, only to find that I cannot attend

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:56.160
 "your press meeting next June as I would like to do."

00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:59.120
 But his handwriting was so bad that they thought it said,

00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:01.840
 "I have wondered all along whether any squirt

00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:04.760
 "had denied the scandal about the president meeting Jane

00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:06.400
 "in the woods on Saturday."

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:07.800
 Wow.

00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:09.440
 That's pretty bad handwriting, isn't it?

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:11.400
 The end of this letter went, "I feel obliged

00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:13.880
 "to decline any invitation that takes me away

00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:15.680
 "a day's journey from home."

00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:18.840
 But they thought it said, "Any insinuation that brick ovens

00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:21.320
 "are dangerous to ham's gives me the horrors."

00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:23.400
 (laughing)

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:25.520
 Yeah, so that's why I think Parsons have very good handwriting.

00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:27.680
 Yeah, this is like when I'm in Asia,

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:30.600
 I speak Mandarin from school, but obviously in Asia,

00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:32.320
 every word has four different tones.

00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:33.520
 And if you get the tones wrong,

00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:36.080
 you might be saying what's the way to the shops down the road,

00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:38.520
 but it comes out as the cow eats the grass

00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:40.440
 and the way a meringue looks like a banana.

00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:41.440
 (laughing)

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:43.240
 Something completely different.

00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:44.880
 Does that mean that you have a completely different system

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:45.960
 of puns, though?

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:46.960
 Yeah, totally.

00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:48.240
 Chinese puns are extraordinary.

00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:50.200
 There was a story that they'd been banned, wasn't there?

00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:53.520
 The Chinese government would crack down on puns?

00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:54.360
 Yeah.

00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:55.200
 Can you do that?

00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:56.040
 I don't know.

00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:57.320
 No cows had been banned from eating meringue.

00:30:57.320 --> 00:30:58.160
 Also.

00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:00.560
 (laughing)

00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:03.240
 Fountain pens, they're quite interesting.

00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:05.680
 You're not supposed to share fountain pens with people.

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:08.760
 It was like just a needle, because you...

00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:09.600
 Because...

00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:10.600
 You'll have wrong.

00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:11.440
 You have a needle.

00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:13.880
 (laughing)

00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:15.200
 Is it because of the bodily fluids

00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:16.720
 you've been writing it exactly?

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:19.760
 (laughing)

00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:22.480
 It's because every person writes in unique ways,

00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:24.000
 you'd imagine a bit like fingerprint,

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.400
 specific angle that you write out

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:27.480
 and the amount of force you use,

00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:30.680
 mainly the nib gets sort of shaved down in a very specific way.

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:32.320
 And so if you're properly using a fountain pen

00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:35.320
 and you want to be writing into the nicest way possible,

00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:36.800
 don't lend your pen to someone else

00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:38.520
 because then they'll shave it down in their way

00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:39.560
 and you'll just end up with a horrible nib.

00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:40.400
 Actually, that's true.

00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:42.440
 I have learnt fountain pens to people in the past.

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:43.280
 Of course, I'm writing.

00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:45.160
 And I've thought, "Oh my God."

00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:46.680
 He's absolutely murdering it.

00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:48.080
 I really, I really have thought that.

00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:49.440
 I can imagine you have had the...

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:50.280
 Yeah, yeah.

00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:52.640
 And I haven't said anything at the time, obviously.

00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:53.680
 (laughing)

00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:54.520
 Should we wrap up?

00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:55.280
 Just a cool thing.

00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:56.120
 Yeah.

00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:57.920
 So in medieval times, you would use a scriptor,

00:31:57.920 --> 00:31:59.600
 you would write in a scriptorium

00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:01.760
 as in monks were copying out books.

00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:02.600
 Yes.

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:05.840
 And some texts, we only know their history

00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:09.520
 because of mistakes that got in somewhere along the train

00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:11.720
 of being repeated, you know, you make a text.

00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:12.560
 Ah, yeah.

00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:15.760
 And that is similar to the way the enigma codes were broken

00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:18.400
 because when people made mistakes in texts,

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:21.680
 that allowed the guys at blechly some way in.

00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:22.520
 Yeah.

00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:23.760
 Yeah, when there was some difference.

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:24.760
 Isn't that amazing?

00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:25.600
 Yeah.

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:27.120
 The difference between medieval and, you know,

00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:29.320
 am I, whatever it was in the war?

00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:31.560
 Just on mistakes, actually.

00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:34.880
 It's the Sepha Torah, a special type of copy of the Torah,

00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:37.040
 which is handwritten with a quill.

00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:39.160
 You're not allowed to make mistakes in any of them.

00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:40.920
 If you make a mistake on most words,

00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:42.240
 then if you're able to scratch it out

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:43.080
 and carry on that to OK.

00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:44.480
 But if you misspell God's name,

00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:46.200
 or make a mistake in writing God's name,

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:48.440
 you have to cut out the entire page and bury it,

00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:50.440
 and then sew in a new page and start again.

00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:52.520
 It's pretty hard to misspell God.

00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:54.240
 It's not in English, obviously.

00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:55.920
 And then dog set off, of course.

00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:56.920
 Yeah.

00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:59.400
 (upbeat music)

00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:00.480
 OK, that's it.

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:01.400
 That's all of our facts.

00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:02.680
 Thank you so much for listening.
