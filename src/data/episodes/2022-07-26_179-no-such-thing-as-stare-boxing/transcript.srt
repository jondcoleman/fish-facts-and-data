1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 Do you know what that is?

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 I don't know what that is...

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,480
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

4
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,520
 to you from the QI offices in Covenant Garden.

5
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:29,180
 My name is Dan Schreiber and I am sitting here with James Harkin, Alex Bell and Anichezinski

6
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:33,180
 and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from

7
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:37,940
 the last seven days and in no particular order here we go.

8
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:46,880
 Starting with my fact this week, my fact is 10% of the UFC is owned by the UAE.

9
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,280
 That is quite surprising.

10
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,060
 So the UFC stands for Ultimate Fighting Champions.

11
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,060
 Yes.

12
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:53,260
 What did UAE stand for?

13
00:00:53,260 --> 00:01:01,820
 The United Arab Emirates and 10% of the UFC is owned specifically by Abu Dhabi.

14
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:06,740
 It's a company called Flash Entertainment which is owned by the government and in 2010

15
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:12,180
 they bought 10% of this company which last year or perhaps even early this year was sold

16
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,900
 again for four billion.

17
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:17,400
 It's a huge industry now and they've retained their 10%.

18
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,500
 So yeah, a government is part of the Ultimate Hardcore Fighting Machine.

19
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,500
 Alright.

20
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,300
 So let's explain what UFC is for the uninitiated like me.

21
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,300
 Okay.

22
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:32,020
 Well, if you've been reading the news this week you will see that the biggest boxing match

23
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:36,500
 for a very long time has happened between a man called Conor McGregor and Floyd Mayweather.

24
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,700
 When you say has happened, it's not happened yet in our universe has it?

25
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:40,700
 That's true.

26
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:41,700
 We're recording this on a Monday.

27
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,100
 You're hearing this from a Friday onwards.

28
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,100
 So yeah, it's...

29
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,100
 Let's take a pun.

30
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:49,700
 I think it's really sad that Conor McGregor died within 10 seconds of adventuring the

31
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:50,700
 UK.

32
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,700
 Yeah.

33
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:57,060
 So Conor McGregor is the UFC fighter in this case, Floyd Mayweather is the boxer and UFC is

34
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:00,820
 a collection of different disciplines of martial arts brought together in a ring known

35
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:05,660
 as the Octagon and it means that when you're fighting an opponent there are just many different

36
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:09,180
 ways that you'll be fighting against them at different martial arts styles.

37
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,500
 It's no holds bar, isn't it?

38
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,260
 That was what it was originally always marked.

39
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,420
 Yeah, but it used to say there are no rules, didn't they?

40
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:15,420
 Yeah.

41
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,660
 It says on the Wikipedia page and it's immediately followed by a list of rules.

42
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:18,660
 Yeah, there's a lot of rules.

43
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:19,660
 Yeah, yeah.

44
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:24,340
 It says there are no rules and then actually even in its first fight it banned biting,

45
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:28,460
 eye gouging, fishhooking, headbutting, hair pulling and groin strikes.

46
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:29,860
 What's fishhooking?

47
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:34,100
 Fishhooking is when you go for an already open cut or it's when you do like a right hook

48
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,580
 but with a fish, I think.

49
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:36,580
 With a fish.

50
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:37,580
 Yeah.

51
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:38,580
 With a modified fish.

52
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:39,580
 Yeah.

53
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:42,500
 It was actually the first two of those that aband, right?

54
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:47,020
 So biting and eye gouging and the other two are all frowned upon and then often I think

55
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:50,340
 the fighters will agree that when there were two fighters that had ponytails they agreed

56
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,740
 not to pull each other's hair and stuff because it would make a better fight.

57
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:53,740
 Okay.

58
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,580
 But interestingly, the biting and the eye gouging of the two headline things that aband and

59
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,940
 that's the same two things that were banned in the ancient Greek pancreation wrestling.

60
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:00,940
 No.

61
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:01,940
 Which was like 2000 years ago.

62
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:02,940
 Is that deliberate?

63
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,940
 I wonder if it is.

64
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:05,940
 I don't know.

65
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:06,940
 It's a very intellectual sport.

66
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:07,940
 UFC, yeah.

67
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:11,580
 Well, you know I mean nothing about it so I'll believe anything you tell me invented by

68
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:12,580
 Plato, was it?

69
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,580
 Yeah.

70
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,580
 Yeah.

71
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:17,900
 It was their first champion.

72
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,100
 Do you know why it's called the Octagon?

73
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,820
 It's got eight sides.

74
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:22,820
 Yeah.

75
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:23,820
 Yeah.

76
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,420
 I frame both quite badly.

77
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:30,340
 The origin of the name of the Octagon is a really, really bad Chuck Norris film from the 80s.

78
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:34,500
 So the guy who was commissioned to design the pitch, are we calling it?

79
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,500
 The square.

80
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,500
 The ring.

81
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,500
 The ring.

82
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,500
 Thank you.

83
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,500
 The pitch.

84
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,500
 The ring in which they fight.

85
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,500
 We'll be fighting in the pitch.

86
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,500
 We're joking.

87
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,980
 The guy was commissioned to design the ring.

88
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:48,300
 He was called Jason Cousin and he didn't really know anything about fighting or what he was

89
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,300
 supposed to do.

90
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:53,500
 And he just heard of this Chuck Norris film that was about no-holds-bad fighting and it

91
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,740
 was called the Octagon.

92
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:55,740
 So he said, "So did it.

93
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:56,740
 Let's make it an Octagon."

94
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:57,740
 Yeah.

95
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:58,740
 So cool.

96
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,540
 It's quite, I mean it's as good a shape as any, right?

97
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:04,380
 In fact, you could say, well you could say it's better than a square because it's closer

98
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,380
 to a ring.

99
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,380
 Yeah.

100
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:09,980
 Like a ring is something with infinite sides and an Octagon's got more sides than a square.

101
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:10,980
 Right.

102
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:11,980
 Compared to infinity though.

103
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:14,380
 Hardly more on the way to that many sides.

104
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,340
 They should have a dodecahedron.

105
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:17,340
 They should.

106
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,340
 Yeah.

107
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,340
 That'd be good.

108
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:21,220
 Just for the visual, if you're listening to this right now and you're thinking, well, what's

109
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,740
 this Octagon look like?

110
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,980
 It's steel mesh all around it.

111
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:28,960
 And the ring wall, as it were, the steel mesh wall, goes up taller than the, let's say,

112
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,960
 the Empire Stable.

113
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:30,960
 Yeah.

114
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,260
 So they have to be lowered in by crane into the ring.

115
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:36,260
 Yeah.

116
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:38,260
 We were saying that it's quite no-holds-bad.

117
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,620
 It gets quite violent.

118
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:44,340
 And people were kind of outraged in the '90s when ultimate fighting and mixed martial arts

119
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,100
 was invented.

120
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:49,380
 And the thing that I think outraged people the most, or the thing that became the epitome

121
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,700
 of it, was the fact that it was done with bare knuckles.

122
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,260
 So it was bare knuckle fighting.

123
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:56,220
 So people were saying, this is so dangerous, look how barbaric it is.

124
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:00,300
 And with bare knuckles, you know, that just goes to show how barbaric it is.

125
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,700
 And so they banned the bare knuckle element of it after a few years and added gloves to make

126
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,020
 it safer.

127
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:08,140
 And in fact, that made it much more dangerous.

128
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:12,980
 Because the reason that bare knuckle is better than wearing gloves is that if you punch

129
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:16,660
 someone super hard with your bare knuckle, then you basically break your fist.

130
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:19,060
 And so most people don't want to punch people too hard.

131
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:22,220
 Whereas as soon as you've got boxing gloves on, then you can punch someone much, much harder

132
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,460
 without damaging yourself.

133
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:27,060
 So by adding gloves, you kind of save the hands, but instead you give people much more severe

134
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,060
 brain damage.

135
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:31,940
 That was quite aggressive the way that you said that fact, because you had a fist the

136
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:32,940
 whole time.

137
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,940
 And you were kind of jabbing the air.

138
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:35,940
 Yeah, it felt good.

139
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:38,460
 I could see the attraction actually.

140
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:43,300
 There was a study on a few years ago where researchers worked out a code for how intense somebody

141
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,300
 smiles.

142
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:48,660
 And then on the day prior to fight, when the fighters have that traditional face-off, like

143
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:54,900
 press conferencing, these researchers watched 152 different UFC fighters and worked out how

144
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:55,900
 much they were smiling.

145
00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:00,500
 And then they found that the more a fighter smiles, the more likely they are to lose the fight.

146
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,740
 And they think it's due to the link of like, if you smile or you have lower testosterone

147
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:08,020
 and you're less aggressive in nature, and they worked out that whilst in the short term,

148
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:10,180
 it means they're more likely to lose that fight the next day.

149
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:13,180
 They're not more likely to lose all the fights coming up.

150
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:16,420
 So it's literally how much you are smiling the day before your fight.

151
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,420
 Why?

152
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,420
 The day before your fight.

153
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:23,940
 Well, this is interesting, because Conor McGregor has been sparring against these pro-boxers

154
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,260
 to sort of get him into shape.

155
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:29,780
 So one of them has come out because he-

156
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:34,900
 That's great, he's really good with it, and I just want to say congratulations, mate.

157
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,260
 Wish you're the luck in your love life.

158
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:42,660
 No, he sort of was kicked out of the Conor McGregor camp, and then he revealed a lot of the

159
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:43,900
 process of how he's training.

160
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:49,140
 And one of the things he's doing is he is doing long stair-offs with these boxers.

161
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:51,260
 So he's practicing the stair.

162
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:55,940
 I just would say at his stage, I would not be focusing on that element of the game.

163
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,820
 I don't care how important the stair is.

164
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:02,620
 But isn't it true that we did say a few podcasts ago that Divers, professional Divers, half

165
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:05,220
 of their job is climbing up to the top of the set.

166
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,700
 Exactly, yes, thank you, James.

167
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,940
 Really half of his job is walking to the rig.

168
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:13,660
 This is hype, if you were diving from a high board, half your job is climbing ladders.

169
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:17,060
 I remember it vividly, it's ingrained in my brain.

170
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:19,060
 And we use the word fact very loosely.

171
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,060
 Yeah.

172
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:23,340
 So using half of a fighter's job is staring contest.

173
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:26,620
 Yeah, if you're really good at not blinking there, you could probably win the blinking

174
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:29,660
 competition, dry out your opponent's eyes, and then they'd be blinded.

175
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:34,100
 It's not a blinking competition, so it's not like chess boxing, where you play a bit

176
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,140
 of chess, then you play a bit of boxing.

177
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:40,060
 It's like you fight for three minutes, and then you just sit there and stare at someone.

178
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,260
 I mean, that would, I would watch that.

179
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,260
 That would be amazing.

180
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:49,260
 If he had just like a smaller belt for a blinking champion for the contest.

181
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:53,140
 But it could be that you have three minutes of fighting, then you have a staring competition,

182
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:58,060
 and whoever wins a staring competition gets one free punch at the start of the next round.

183
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,060
 Oh, yeah.

184
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,060
 Nice.

185
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:03,820
 You should invent that as a sport, and put it in a non-agun or something, and play more

186
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:06,020
 creative, something amazing.

187
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:08,740
 And the kicking can be really damaging, can't it?

188
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:14,420
 So I think if we talked about the fight between Mahamadali and Antonio and Noke before.

189
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:18,340
 So this is a fight that's seen as basically the precursor to MMA to mixed martial arts.

190
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:22,940
 And this was when Mahamadali took on a Japanese wrestler called Antonio and Noke, and

191
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:26,580
 the 70s in the 1970s.

192
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,580
 Can you say MMA?

193
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:28,580
 Yeah, MMA.

194
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,580
 Not MMA.

195
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,580
 Oh, sorry.

196
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:31,580
 Yeah.

197
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,700
 This is the precursor to MMA mixed martial.

198
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:34,700
 MMA.

199
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,700
 Wow.

200
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:40,180
 This is the precursor to mixed martial arts.

201
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:44,180
 And this was when Mahamadali took on this Japanese wrestler called Antonio.

202
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:45,180
 Mahamad Ali.

203
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:52,780
 Anyway, the point was Mahamadali and Antonio and Noke had this

204
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:56,540
 fight to see which of the disciplines was going to win.

205
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:59,260
 And Noke caused massive damage to Ali.

206
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:01,900
 So basically he spent the whole time lying on the floor, I think.

207
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:02,900
 Yeah.

208
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:03,900
 Almost the entirety of the time.

209
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,500
 He lay on the floor and just kicked Mahamadali in the shins really hard.

210
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,260
 And Ali got blood clots after that.

211
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:12,260
 And I think his legs were permanently damaged from then on to have surgery and stuff because

212
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,260
 of it.

213
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:17,020
 But it was called a draw, I think, which was good because it meant that neither of them

214
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:19,300
 had disgraced themselves in front of their fans.

215
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,300
 Yeah.

216
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:24,860
 And he said afterwards that the reason he just kicked Mahamad Ali is because Ali had such

217
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:30,420
 devoted fans that he'd been warned if he laid a hand on him, then his fans would kill him.

218
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,620
 So he decided to go at him with the feet instead.

219
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:33,620
 Oh.

220
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:34,620
 Yeah.

221
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:37,980
 Do you think when Mahamad Ali's supporters came up to him later and tried to attack him,

222
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,780
 he's like, no, no, I didn't lay my hands on him.

223
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:40,780
 I think that's what he said.

224
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:41,780
 I think that's what he said.

225
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:42,780
 I think that's what he said.

226
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:43,780
 You've got to start.

227
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:45,780
 You've got to get back and read a small print of off-threat.

228
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:46,780
 He did.

229
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:52,500
 I love how that like as fans would be going up, going, hey, man, we're going to kick your ass.

230
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,940
 Like, no, this guy just kicked Mahamad Ali's ass.

231
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:57,060
 Like, yeah, you stand no chance to get it.

232
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,060
 Yeah.

233
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,060
 Exactly.

234
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:03,500
 And when the angry mob comes down, he can just lie on his back and kick the police.

235
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:08,020
 Abidab is not the only investor in the UFC.

236
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,020
 There are many other people who...

237
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:12,020
 Well, he said they only have 10% so I'm not surprised.

238
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:18,620
 Other people who have a stake in the UFC are LL Cool J.

239
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,620
 Who's named?

240
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,620
 Who's named?

241
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,220
 You know where LL Cool J comes from?

242
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,220
 No.

243
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,220
 It's short for Ladies Love Cool James.

244
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,220
 Really?

245
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,220
 Yeah.

246
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,220
 Oh, that's very cool.

247
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:30,220
 Does anyone ever cool to you that James?

248
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,220
 No.

249
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:33,700
 Yeah, you sound like you tried to make that take off first and no one would have it.

250
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,660
 And then you could do your work.

251
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:41,580
 You just got there just too quickly otherwise that's all they've become.

252
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:47,420
 So Calvin Harris, Flea from the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Trey Parker of South Park.

253
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,420
 Really?

254
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:54,700
 Maria Sharapova, the tennis star, and Sylvester Stallone and Conan O'Brien, who is the late-night

255
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:58,700
 talk show host in America, who's been having Conor Gregoron a lot recently.

256
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,500
 And I was like, "I hadn't didn't know he had an interest.

257
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,900
 He's got a business interest."

258
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:02,900
 Yeah.

259
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:06,020
 That's quite a who's who of spot stars and...

260
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,020
 Yeah.

261
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:09,020
 The buy-in was $250,000.

262
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:11,820
 So I think they all bought the sort of the minimum of it.

263
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:16,260
 But again, this is back in 2010 and the sport exploded, so those guys are probably making

264
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,260
 some money.

265
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,620
 I can't believe all those people are making some money, finally.

266
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:20,620
 Finally.

267
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:23,380
 I mean, after years of poverty, L.Courchain.

268
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:26,700
 Well, I mean, you picked the one name that probably doesn't need some money.

269
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:27,700
 I don't know.

270
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:28,700
 The only one I could remember.

271
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:32,260
 That was the fact that Conor suddenly was doing the round and read it this week about

272
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:36,620
 UFC, which is that there's a fighter called Rory and McDonald's and so at the end of

273
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:40,260
 all the fights, they have walk, no, the beginning of all the fights, they have walkout music,

274
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,740
 so an introduced each fighter.

275
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:45,300
 And he was quite unhappy about a lot of the music he was getting and the guy that was organising

276
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,300
 it.

277
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:49,460
 But he didn't really say anything because he thought that he'd manage everything, we're

278
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,940
 just organising it themselves.

279
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:55,740
 And eventually he mentioned something and the guy who was organising music was like,

280
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,900
 "No, I thought you were requesting all of these."

281
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:01,300
 And it turned out that he'd had his phone number changed a couple of years ago and a fan

282
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:09,740
 got a hold of his phone number and was requesting stupid music, like Rihanna's We Found Love and

283
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:13,540
 MC Hammer's You Can't Touch This, so all these songs were kind of dissing him and making

284
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,540
 fun of him a bit.

285
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:16,340
 It was just somebody taking the piss like three years.

286
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:19,660
 I could think of worse songs, I could have put it, but I'd have sent the Tehli Tubby's

287
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:20,660
 theme up.

288
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:21,660
 Yeah, exactly.

289
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:26,420
 I think whoever the fan was did a good job to just about find that level where they didn't

290
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:36,420
 get found out for like years.

291
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:41,900
 Column MacGregor got in trouble quite recently for saying that he could beat Jesus in a fight.

292
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:46,700
 Yeah, this was last year, he said, "There's not a man alive that could beat me, but Jesus

293
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:51,580
 isn't alive, so maybe he could and come back from the dead, but I don't know, I'd still

294
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:52,580
 whoop his ass."

295
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:56,060
 But that's true, because you only have to lie down for like ten seconds for your hour as

296
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:58,460
 Jesus would take three days to get up again.

297
00:12:58,460 --> 00:12:59,460
 Nice.

298
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:00,460
 Yeah.

299
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:03,900
 So he'd get back up, but they'd actually converted the arena into a Little Mix concert

300
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:04,900
 at that point.

301
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:16,860
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is LL Cool, Jake.

302
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:24,820
 Okay, my fact this week is that Palau is about to pass a law, meaning that every hotel

303
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:27,020
 in the country has to be five star.

304
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:31,060
 I will admit that I spent a good two minutes when you sent this by email looking for the

305
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:34,580
 footnote, because I thought the star was an asterisk and I was like, "Five watts."

306
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:38,580
 I was like scrolling through all the replies.

307
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:45,060
 So what this is is a new law to try and make just high-end tourism in this country,

308
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:49,260
 allow which is in the Pacific, and they're suffering from climate change more than everyone

309
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:54,700
 else really, like all these Pacific countries are, and they have problems with infrastructure

310
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:58,340
 when they're getting the loads of tourists in, and so they think, "Well, if we only have

311
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:02,220
 high-end tourists, that means fewer tourists, but still the same amount of money."

312
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:06,220
 They want new hotels to come in with their own walled treatment system, with their own

313
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,340
 power, and stuff like that.

314
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,540
 And so Palau is a collection of islands, right?

315
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:15,540
 So is this every single one of their 280-ish islands having five star hotels, or is there

316
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,940
 a central spot to it?

317
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:21,300
 Well, it will be, if you want to put a hotel in any of those places, it'll have to be five

318
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,300
 star.

319
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,300
 Yeah, and I've been to Palau.

320
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,300
 Happy occasion.

321
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,300
 Yeah, I did.

322
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:29,140
 We went when I was a kid, because I lived in Hong Kong, and that's not too far away.

323
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,140
 It's quite far.

324
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:33,100
 I mean, you didn't row there, did you?

325
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,740
 No, we got the holidays.

326
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:36,980
 The jet ski.

327
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:42,700
 No, yeah, we, we, uh, holidayed there, and it was in, I mean, this is, we're talking 15,

328
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:48,060
 20 years ago, so it was in huts by the beach, so, um, but those can be five star, obviously.

329
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,060
 Yeah.

330
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:52,580
 I just know already that you're exactly the kind of person that are now working to keep

331
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:53,580
 out on it.

332
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:54,580
 Yeah.

333
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:57,380
 You're the person this policy is aimed at.

334
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:04,140
 It took us 15 years to get the law through, but it's definitely not coming back now.

335
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:08,860
 So I've got some stuff on hotels, okay, um, there was, there's a really good article on the

336
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:12,980
 economist about the various standards that hotels have to stick to.

337
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:17,540
 Um, and so for instance, the Hilton chain of hotels, there's a manual that stipulates

338
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:21,340
 that staff have to answer the phones after three rings exactly.

339
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:24,980
 For instance, um, whereas intercontinental, you have to wait four rings.

340
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:25,980
 Is that right?

341
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,260
 Well, you used to work for intercontinental hotels.

342
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,420
 Did you ever answer the phone before or after four rings?

343
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,620
 I think I might have done.

344
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:35,340
 Well, that is that why you're working here.

345
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:37,700
 I quite appreciate that rule, actually, because it is quite startling when you ring someone

346
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:38,860
 they pick up really fast.

347
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:39,860
 Yeah, totally.

348
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:44,980
 Um, they have, there's one chain which wasn't allowing itself to be named, which all of

349
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:50,300
 its hotels, all omelettes have to match a laminated model omelette that they have there,

350
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:53,140
 which is cigar shaped and they have to model it on that.

351
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:54,140
 Right.

352
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:58,300
 Um, yeah, intercontinental also, you might remember this rule, James, specifies that the

353
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:05,300
 rooms have to offer at least four pornographic films. At least four. At least four, yeah. You

354
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,300
 can't go up.

355
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,300
 You don't want to turn up for the Zolli three polygraphs, do you?

356
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:13,940
 Can you imagine calling up reception and be like, hi, could do with a couple more?

357
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:19,820
 I seem to be missing one of my four. Yeah. So this is your first night. I know. It's been

358
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:23,780
 a long session and I just need one or two more to kick me over to the end.

359
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:27,780
 Could you change the sheets while you're up there please?

360
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:35,380
 By the way, you picked up on the fourth ring and I don't know, more a three ring guy.

361
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:38,780
 We didn't ask about your sexual preference, is it?

362
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:46,340
 A hotel in Colorado downloads pictures of your family from the internet and frames them

363
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:51,420
 for when you arrive at the hotel because either brilliant or the most creepy thing I've

364
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,420
 ever heard in my entire life.

365
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:53,420
 Yeah.

366
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:56,780
 I think I know which one of those it is. There's also just one more which is a hotel in

367
00:16:56,780 --> 00:17:03,980
 Mexico, a luxury hotel where they do research into you beforehand and the housekeeper matches

368
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:08,660
 the colour of the thread in the guest sewing kits to the clothes that you're wearing.

369
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:11,340
 And again, they get that from photos on social media do you think?

370
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:14,900
 I think actually it must be from when you've arrived so there must be an emergency you arrive

371
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:18,140
 at the reception desk and they're like, she's got a red dress on, quick, get the red thread

372
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,140
 in the book.

373
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:22,500
 That's good because most of the pictures of me on social media from fancy dress parties.

374
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:28,260
 So you just get, I don't know, what kind of stuff do you wear, you get some face paint.

375
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:33,860
 There were a couple of zero star hotels in Switzerland and the first one was in a Cold War

376
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:38,340
 bunker so there were no TVs, there were no separate bathrooms, there's no daylight because

377
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,620
 it's in a bunker.

378
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:43,060
 But it doesn't look too bad, it's basically like a kind of low-end youth hostel.

379
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:49,020
 The second one is just a bed and a bit of a wall up a mountain in Switzerland and then

380
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:53,380
 there's a butler who is actually a local farmer who comes and is responsible for giving you

381
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:59,340
 the weather forecast and telling you jokes and it's all about, it's sort of ties some

382
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,380
 critique on hotel culture and it's good though.

383
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,380
 It does sound good though.

384
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:05,500
 I reckon I'd pay for that in the hotel to have a farmer come and tell me jokes.

385
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,500
 Yeah me too.

386
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:09,500
 Especially if they check my social media and saw what kind of jokes I like.

387
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,500
 Good point.

388
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,500
 Yeah.

389
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,500
 He'd be like, this is an easy one, yeah.

390
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:23,060
 Or labored tons.

391
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:26,940
 Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is Alex.

392
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:32,020
 My fact this week is that every Canadian citizen is entitled to a free government issue portrait

393
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,020
 of the Queen.

394
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,020
 Ah, of our Queen.

395
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,020
 Of our Queen.

396
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,020
 And their Queen.

397
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,020
 And their Queen.

398
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:41,860
 They're actually entitled to five portraits of the royal family in various combinations.

399
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:47,540
 And they choose whichever members they like as in if you prefer princess Eugenie and

400
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,020
 Prince Andrew you can have those two.

401
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,220
 You know what I don't think they're on offer.

402
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:53,780
 I think it's mainly like Philip and the Queen and I think Prince William.

403
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:56,860
 Yeah, it's the big, it's the headline, it's the main characters.

404
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:00,100
 But there are just five different ones and you can order up to like one of each so you

405
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,100
 can get five in total, right?

406
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:05,940
 So you'd be like, how come on, you got to unlock Eugenie with your dedication.

407
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:10,020
 Because even though there's a prince, not original oil paintings every time you

408
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,020
 do.

409
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:13,020
 It's a huge frame.

410
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,260
 No, these are just paints.

411
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,500
 Oh, you can download them like free.

412
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,260
 So I've downloaded mine even though not.

413
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,260
 You're not Canadian.

414
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,260
 I know.

415
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,660
 But that was big as a lot.

416
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:24,020
 So this is part of a lot of services that you can get from the government of Canada.

417
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:30,500
 If you ring 1-800-O Canada, you get, I know, you get onto the helpline that provides

418
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:34,020
 that information on Canadian governmental programs and services and stuff like that.

419
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,380
 It's really cool.

420
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:38,660
 But the O is that a zero or is it the O in the keyboard?

421
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,460
 No, the letter O from the numbers.

422
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:41,460
 Really?

423
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:46,020
 Because when you give someone's phone number, you often use the word O to mean zero, don't

424
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,020
 you like O-800?

425
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,020
 Sure, yeah.

426
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,020
 It's really convenient.

427
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:51,020
 A lot of Canadians getting through to them random pizza place on my arrow.

428
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:53,020
 Demanding pictures of the Queen.

429
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:55,300
 What's going on?

430
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:58,340
 Interestingly, when you go to the website, I look to the pictures as well.

431
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,940
 I couldn't see as many as five actually.

432
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:03,300
 I saw you could have the Queen or Philip or the Queen with Philip.

433
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:06,260
 So those are your options that I saw.

434
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:10,060
 And they have lots of rules, though, for if you do download them, for what you're allowed

435
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,980
 and they're allowed to not do with them.

436
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:16,780
 So for example, you cannot use the images on adhesive seals.

437
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:17,780
 That's one.

438
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,020
 Lots of adhesive seal.

439
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,020
 I guess.

440
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,780
 Like a sticker on an envelope?

441
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,500
 Yeah, that's what I was thinking like on an envelope.

442
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,340
 I guess a stamp is what they're saying.

443
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,340
 I see.

444
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,820
 Are you sealers in that holds the envelope together?

445
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:29,820
 Yeah.

446
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:30,820
 So you're not allowed that.

447
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:34,220
 You know, all the time, rather than buying a normal envelope, you just buy one and

448
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,220
 then use a sticker.

449
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,220
 I always do that.

450
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:38,700
 But then I always put a sticker of the Queen on, so now I'm a bit worried.

451
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,700
 Oh, yeah.

452
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,700
 You got to recall all those postcards from over the years, James.

453
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,700
 Can you recall a postcard?

454
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,700
 Yeah.

455
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:51,500
 The postcard just locks on, you know, sorry, I'm just going to get that.

456
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,500
 She doesn't wish you were here anymore.

457
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,500
 Yeah.

458
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:58,700
 Also, can I just say postcards, the one thing you don't have to put them in the envelope?

459
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:03,780
 As the words came out of my mouth, I don't have no one notices that.

460
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:09,460
 And the one final thing you're not allowed to use it for, there's other things, but another

461
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:13,780
 thing you're not allowed to use it for is to advertise if the Queen or Philip have visited

462
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:14,780
 your shop.

463
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:17,900
 So the example they give is, for example, if the Royal Highness is the Duke and Duchess of

464
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:22,260
 Cambridge were to visit a cheese shop, that shop could not use a photograph of the occasion

465
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,460
 to advertise its goods.

466
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:27,180
 Is that like when you go into like a curry house and they've got like a sign verse of

467
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:28,180
 Gary Linnicka?

468
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,180
 Yeah.

469
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,180
 Or like a Laundra.

470
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:33,700
 But it's always Gary Linnicka, it's always Gary Linnicka.

471
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,700
 He just visits Laundra and curry houses all the time.

472
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:40,300
 It must be that Gary Linnicka's going to a lot of curry houses with signed photos, right?

473
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,300
 Yeah.

474
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,300
 Yeah.

475
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,100
 Or are they, I mean, have you ever seen him on any linen?

476
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,100
 I haven't.

477
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,220
 So that means it's the same photo of Gary Linnicka.

478
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,220
 Right.

479
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,220
 It's the same.

480
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,220
 Yeah.

481
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:52,220
 I think that he just doesn't have an oven or a washing machine.

482
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:55,220
 So he always constantly has to use the Laundra and eat out or something like that.

483
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:58,420
 We go to the curry house, it spills curry alone for himself, so he has to get everything

484
00:21:58,420 --> 00:21:59,420
 to like these.

485
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:02,380
 An adorable, messy eater.

486
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:07,420
 Something else that you can get free in Canada, that's quite cool, is the flag that's flown

487
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:11,980
 at the top of their equivalent of Big Ben, basically, which is the Ottawa Peace Tower, so it's

488
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:15,740
 a huge clock that's sort of part of the Parliament buildings.

489
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:20,740
 And you can write off, you can sign a form and write off and request one of those flags

490
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:25,540
 because every single day, or about 250 days of the year, they'd take the flag down and

491
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:27,380
 they'd change it and put up a new one.

492
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:31,540
 And then they wash that one and iron it out and they send it to whoever in Canada has requested

493
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,540
 it.

494
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:33,540
 Really?

495
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:34,540
 They must be massive, though, aren't they?

496
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,540
 They are big.

497
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:36,540
 Yes.

498
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:38,060
 And so there must be more than one person must request it, so.

499
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,060
 Right.

500
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,060
 So this is what's happened.

501
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:42,100
 I think you've hit upon a problem.

502
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:46,500
 They've had at least 20,000 requests at this point, which means that there's now a 73-year

503
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,060
 waiting list to get your flag.

504
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,060
 What?

505
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:52,660
 So you can have delivered to your grand children.

506
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:56,100
 You've got to be pretty young to make an application now, don't you?

507
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,940
 You really do to be successful.

508
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,620
 But why do they keep giving away flags?

509
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:01,580
 Sorry, why do they need a new one every day?

510
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,580
 I don't think they do.

511
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:03,580
 I think this is just an idea they had.

512
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:04,580
 Right.

513
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:08,420
 They had a thing to do to donate a flag each day to some-- or most days of the year to someone

514
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,420
 in the country.

515
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:10,420
 Good.

516
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:11,420
 Every day they replace the flag.

517
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,420
 Not every year.

518
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:14,820
 It's about-- so it's every weekday except bank holidays are apparently when the weather's

519
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:15,820
 poor.

520
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,100
 They don't bother changing it.

521
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:21,820
 Every Canadian citizen is entitled to three hours to vote whenever there's an election.

522
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:22,820
 In the booth?

523
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:23,820
 No.

524
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:24,820
 It doesn't.

525
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:27,620
 So you'll have three hours of work to vote basically.

526
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:28,620
 Oh, right.

527
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,660
 So what are you doing in there?

528
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:37,100
 Basically, if your work schedule means that you finish work at, say, four o'clock or something

529
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:40,780
 and the polls close at seven o'clock, then that's fine.

530
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:44,460
 But if your work schedule means you don't have three hours spared, they have to give you

531
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,460
 three hours off.

532
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,460
 That's good.

533
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:47,460
 Yeah, it's good there, isn't it?

534
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:50,060
 Yeah, it's a lot of time to get to a polling station.

535
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,060
 Yeah.

536
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,060
 Cool.

537
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:53,060
 Probably have lunch as well.

538
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,060
 Yeah.

539
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:58,020
 I guess the problem I might not even vote, to be honest.

540
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,500
 I got another Queen Canada fact.

541
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:08,580
 So the Queen appears on the banknotes of Canada, actually, doesn't Australia and all around

542
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,300
 the Commonwealth.

543
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:15,100
 But interesting claim that Canada has over it is they were the first country even beating

544
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:20,460
 the UK to having the Queen on a banknote before anyone else.

545
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,940
 Was it like as soon as she became Queen, they rushed it out?

546
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:23,940
 No, it was pretty.

547
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,580
 It was, this was in 1935.

548
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:26,580
 She's just a child.

549
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,380
 Yeah, she was nine-year-old.

550
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,380
 You remember this?

551
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:32,020
 I remember reading it before you just said it.

552
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:33,020
 I knew it.

553
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:35,620
 Time to shovel her.

554
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:38,100
 I went back to order my flag.

555
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:44,460
 Did you know in Australia, you can also get a portrait of the Queen.

556
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:48,980
 But you can also request CD and DVD recordings of the National Anthem if you want them.

557
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:49,980
 Really?

558
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:54,580
 If you Google constituents request program, you can just ask your local MP or a political

559
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:58,660
 representative for that and you can request a booklet on the flags of Australia.

560
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:02,220
 You can get a booklet on Australia's National Symbols and yet you can get a DVD of the National

561
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,220
 Anthem.

562
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:07,100
 So can someone listening to this in Australia, please do that and send us a photo of you

563
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,100
 with your DVD?

564
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,100
 Yeah, please do.

565
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:12,460
 Actually, I quite like a photo of someone from Canada with a free portrait of the Queen.

566
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:13,460
 Yeah, yeah.

567
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:14,460
 Yeah, yeah.

568
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:17,260
 Okay, if you're in a Commonwealth and you have this option, if you're listening in

569
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:28,900
 Britain, just a picture of Gary Linnaco will be great and please post it to us on our kiwai account.

570
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:33,780
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show and that is Chazinsky.

571
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:38,300
 My fact this week is that the first ever in cyclopedia Britannica said that humans were

572
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:40,700
 divided into five categories.

573
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:48,620
 These categories were American, European, Asian, African and monstrous, the five types of

574
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:49,620
 humans.

575
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,220
 Did they believe that there were monsters?

576
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:52,220
 Is that what we're saying?

577
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:55,700
 I read this in this really good book I've just started reading, it's called "You Could Look

578
00:25:55,700 --> 00:26:01,780
 It Up" by a guy called Jack Lynch and so what it was was that there was kind of an age

579
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:05,460
 of exploration and there were often a lot of rumors about the kind of people you'd find

580
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,020
 in strange places.

581
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:10,260
 Maybe there were kind of mythical, semi-human creatures around so there were reports

582
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:15,740
 for instance of men who had feet backwards or men who didn't have any noses.

583
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:20,140
 There were reports of humans who had dogs heads and who communicated by barking and so there

584
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:22,420
 were kind of these rumors about mythical monsters.

585
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:28,300
 So you are describing Bigfoot and werewolves and these are all still real things out there

586
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,300
 today Anna.

587
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:33,980
 So this was the casual term of the users to cover themselves, to be like anything we don't,

588
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:35,300
 it's in miscellaneous basically.

589
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:41,140
 And this went back to Leneas who classified homo sapiens 10 years earlier, so in 1758.

590
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:46,580
 And he actually said that there was homo ferrous as well as a different species which was wild

591
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:49,780
 men and then homo monstrous which was monsters.

592
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:53,740
 And yeah so we're not quite sure what they are but we're looking made up people.

593
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:59,900
 So I was reading up on the first ever encyclopedia Britannica because weirdly as you almost feel

594
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:04,740
 like the authors should be famous names and I didn't know a single one.

595
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:08,140
 So there were two guys who effectively brought it together.

596
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:14,820
 One was called Colin McFarcher and that's exactly how he pronounced it.

597
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,520
 Quick to question Mark at the end.

598
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,520
 He never knew.

599
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:23,180
 The name's McFarquad Colin McFarquad?

600
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:24,180
 Yeah.

601
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:30,280
 He also sat up with a guy called Andrew Bell and Alex, your surname is Bell, we're talking

602
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,280
 it all about her.

603
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,280
 Yeah.

604
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:38,400
 As for the encyclopedia Britannica, he was the engraver, he was the one who did all of the drawings

605
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:42,840
 which on our podcast when you're not on the microphone with us, you are our illustrator

606
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,840
 for all the things.

607
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,680
 So you both have the same surname.

608
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,680
 That's exciting.

609
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:50,180
 I like the way that you said Bell as if there was no exclamation points at the end of it

610
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:51,180
 as well.

611
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,680
 So you got McFarquad.

612
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,680
 What?

613
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,680
 Bell.

614
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,680
 Yeah.

615
00:27:55,680 --> 00:28:00,120
 I don't know what's going to go with my pronunciation but Bell was a very interesting

616
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,280
 guy.

617
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,280
 He was quite small.

618
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:06,820
 He was four foot six and he had a big nose that he would sometimes try and hide by wearing

619
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:10,480
 a paper mash a version in order to hide the bigness of his nose.

620
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,480
 He was surely bigger.

621
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,480
 Yeah.

622
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,480
 You would say, right?

623
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,480
 No.

624
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,000
 I think he was a joker and he did it whenever anyone stared at his nose.

625
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,700
 He put a bigger one up a bit to say, are you looking at my nose, bitch?

626
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:25,260
 I think he was like, because he was going to be in my book.

627
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,260
 Bitch.

628
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:43,940
 He was going to be like, the tallest one, please.

629
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:44,940
 I like that.

630
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:45,940
 I do.

631
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:46,940
 Going to hire a horse.

632
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:51,020
 They've just got the same options like at the car rental place where you're like color and

633
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,020
 height and compact.

634
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:56,220
 Do you leave it fully fed or do you do someone else do that?

635
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,220
 Yeah.

636
00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:02,300
 So the oldest known encyclopedia Britannica is still in use, apparently, and it was only discovered

637
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:08,100
 in 2010 and there's an 18 volume set that was from 1797 and it just belonged to this family

638
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:11,780
 in Chelmsford and they'd used it growing up and stuff and they were still using it all the

639
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:12,780
 time.

640
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:17,860
 They bought it for 15 pounds, the full set, which seems unbelievable for 18 volumes of encyclopedia.

641
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:19,780
 But now it's worth like 9,000, right?

642
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:20,780
 Yeah.

643
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:21,780
 Under sampling.

644
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:24,740
 It seems like not very much money for the encyclopedia, old, is encyclopedia.

645
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:25,740
 I agree.

646
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:26,740
 Which doesn't seem to go for any.

647
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:29,900
 Yeah, but you can get them on CD-ROM these days.

648
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:30,900
 Yeah, it's true.

649
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:31,900
 Dig.

650
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:32,900
 Yeah, that's what he did.

651
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:33,900
 It was so with it.

652
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:34,900
 Yeah.

653
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:35,900
 That's no idea.

654
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:42,900
 If Wikipedia was printed out on paper, it would be about 1,900 volumes worth of Britannica.

655
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:43,900
 Really?

656
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:44,900
 That would be the most tedious.

657
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:49,060
 I mean encyclopedias are not exactly the greatest read of all time, are they?

658
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,540
 But imagine Wikipedia.

659
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:55,020
 All those little pages for like high schools in the middle of America and stuff.

660
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:58,860
 Well, there was a project, like it was more of an art project, but this guy called Michael

661
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:05,180
 Manderberg in 2015 printed out some of it and kind of did a little math and worked how much

662
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,180
 of a cost.

663
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:10,940
 It was called from A to Zap so that A was A-A-A-A-A-A-A exclamation mark, which is like the

664
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:16,460
 first Wikipedia entry he could find in the beginning to Zap, which was Z-Z-Z-A-P exclamation

665
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:19,460
 mark, which was a really random kid's CV show that I remember watching.

666
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,460
 Really?

667
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:21,460
 Yeah, isn't that weird?

668
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:22,460
 I remember watching--

669
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:25,740
 Ah, yeah, that's classic.

670
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:30,500
 My favourite encyclopedia is the four volume encyclopedia of lubricants and lubrication.

671
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,500
 Nice.

672
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,900
 Have you read it?

673
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:33,900
 No.

674
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:38,260
 It's not you couldn't put it down, it's you couldn't pick it up.

675
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:41,100
 Okay, well, anything else?

676
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,100
 I'm happy to wrap.

677
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,100
 Yep.

678
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,100
 Let's hear that wrap.

679
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,100
 Hello, cool J.

680
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:53,220
 Okay, that's it.

681
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,540
 That is all of our facts.

682
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:55,780
 Thank you so much for listening.

683
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:58,700
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us about the things that we have said over

684
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:01,820
 the course of this podcast, we can be found on our Twitter accounts.

685
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:07,300
 I'm on @Sriberland, James, @EggShaped, Alex, @AlexBellUnderskool, and Shazinski.

686
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:09,180
 You can email podcast@QI.com.

687
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:13,020
 Yeah, but you can go to our group Twitter account, which is @QIPodcast, or you can head

688
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:16,180
 to no such thing as a fish.com, where it has all of our previous episodes.

689
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:19,460
 You can also buy tickets or are upcoming tour in October and November.

690
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:24,300
 It's also got a link to buy our book, the book of the year, which comes out in November.

691
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:31,500
 And why not join us every Monday on Facebook Live 5.30pm, British time, which apparently

692
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:34,820
 is not a thing, but London time.

693
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:37,060
 And we'll be there to chat about this episode.

694
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:38,060
 We'll see you again next week.

695
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:43,500
 Goodbye.

696
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:46,080
 (upbeat music)
