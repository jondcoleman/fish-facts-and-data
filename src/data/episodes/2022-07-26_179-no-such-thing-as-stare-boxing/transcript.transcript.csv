00:00:00,00:00:07,Do you know what that is?
00:00:07,00:00:15,I don't know what that is...
00:00:15,00:00:20,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming"
00:00:20,00:00:23,to you from the QI offices in Covenant Garden.
00:00:23,00:00:29,"My name is Dan Schreiber and I am sitting here with James Harkin, Alex Bell and Anichezinski"
00:00:29,00:00:33,and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from
00:00:33,00:00:37,the last seven days and in no particular order here we go.
00:00:37,00:00:46,"Starting with my fact this week, my fact is 10% of the UFC is owned by the UAE."
00:00:46,00:00:48,That is quite surprising.
00:00:48,00:00:51,So the UFC stands for Ultimate Fighting Champions.
00:00:51,00:00:52,Yes.
00:00:52,00:00:53,What did UAE stand for?
00:00:53,00:01:01,The United Arab Emirates and 10% of the UFC is owned specifically by Abu Dhabi.
00:01:01,00:01:06,It's a company called Flash Entertainment which is owned by the government and in 2010
00:01:06,00:01:12,they bought 10% of this company which last year or perhaps even early this year was sold
00:01:12,00:01:13,again for four billion.
00:01:13,00:01:17,It's a huge industry now and they've retained their 10%.
00:01:17,00:01:21,"So yeah, a government is part of the Ultimate Hardcore Fighting Machine."
00:01:21,00:01:22,Alright.
00:01:22,00:01:26,So let's explain what UFC is for the uninitiated like me.
00:01:26,00:01:27,Okay.
00:01:27,00:01:32,"Well, if you've been reading the news this week you will see that the biggest boxing match"
00:01:32,00:01:36,for a very long time has happened between a man called Conor McGregor and Floyd Mayweather.
00:01:36,00:01:39,"When you say has happened, it's not happened yet in our universe has it?"
00:01:39,00:01:40,That's true.
00:01:40,00:01:41,We're recording this on a Monday.
00:01:41,00:01:43,You're hearing this from a Friday onwards.
00:01:43,00:01:44,"So yeah, it's..."
00:01:44,00:01:45,Let's take a pun.
00:01:45,00:01:49,I think it's really sad that Conor McGregor died within 10 seconds of adventuring the
00:01:49,00:01:50,UK.
00:01:50,00:01:51,Yeah.
00:01:51,00:01:57,"So Conor McGregor is the UFC fighter in this case, Floyd Mayweather is the boxer and UFC is"
00:01:57,00:02:00,a collection of different disciplines of martial arts brought together in a ring known
00:02:00,00:02:05,as the Octagon and it means that when you're fighting an opponent there are just many different
00:02:05,00:02:09,ways that you'll be fighting against them at different martial arts styles.
00:02:09,00:02:10,"It's no holds bar, isn't it?"
00:02:10,00:02:12,That was what it was originally always marked.
00:02:12,00:02:14,"Yeah, but it used to say there are no rules, didn't they?"
00:02:14,00:02:15,Yeah.
00:02:15,00:02:17,It says on the Wikipedia page and it's immediately followed by a list of rules.
00:02:17,00:02:18,"Yeah, there's a lot of rules."
00:02:18,00:02:19,"Yeah, yeah."
00:02:19,00:02:24,"It says there are no rules and then actually even in its first fight it banned biting,"
00:02:24,00:02:28,"eye gouging, fishhooking, headbutting, hair pulling and groin strikes."
00:02:28,00:02:29,What's fishhooking?
00:02:29,00:02:34,Fishhooking is when you go for an already open cut or it's when you do like a right hook
00:02:34,00:02:35,"but with a fish, I think."
00:02:35,00:02:36,With a fish.
00:02:36,00:02:37,Yeah.
00:02:37,00:02:38,With a modified fish.
00:02:38,00:02:39,Yeah.
00:02:39,00:02:42,"It was actually the first two of those that aband, right?"
00:02:42,00:02:47,So biting and eye gouging and the other two are all frowned upon and then often I think
00:02:47,00:02:50,the fighters will agree that when there were two fighters that had ponytails they agreed
00:02:50,00:02:52,not to pull each other's hair and stuff because it would make a better fight.
00:02:52,00:02:53,Okay.
00:02:53,00:02:56,"But interestingly, the biting and the eye gouging of the two headline things that aband and"
00:02:56,00:02:59,that's the same two things that were banned in the ancient Greek pancreation wrestling.
00:02:59,00:03:00,No.
00:03:00,00:03:01,Which was like 2000 years ago.
00:03:01,00:03:02,Is that deliberate?
00:03:02,00:03:04,I wonder if it is.
00:03:04,00:03:05,I don't know.
00:03:05,00:03:06,It's a very intellectual sport.
00:03:06,00:03:07,"UFC, yeah."
00:03:07,00:03:11,"Well, you know I mean nothing about it so I'll believe anything you tell me invented by"
00:03:11,00:03:12,"Plato, was it?"
00:03:12,00:03:13,Yeah.
00:03:13,00:03:14,Yeah.
00:03:14,00:03:17,It was their first champion.
00:03:17,00:03:20,Do you know why it's called the Octagon?
00:03:20,00:03:21,It's got eight sides.
00:03:21,00:03:22,Yeah.
00:03:22,00:03:23,Yeah.
00:03:23,00:03:25,I frame both quite badly.
00:03:25,00:03:30,"The origin of the name of the Octagon is a really, really bad Chuck Norris film from the 80s."
00:03:30,00:03:34,"So the guy who was commissioned to design the pitch, are we calling it?"
00:03:34,00:03:35,The square.
00:03:35,00:03:36,The ring.
00:03:36,00:03:37,The ring.
00:03:37,00:03:38,Thank you.
00:03:38,00:03:39,The pitch.
00:03:39,00:03:40,The ring in which they fight.
00:03:40,00:03:41,We'll be fighting in the pitch.
00:03:41,00:03:42,We're joking.
00:03:42,00:03:44,The guy was commissioned to design the ring.
00:03:44,00:03:48,He was called Jason Cousin and he didn't really know anything about fighting or what he was
00:03:48,00:03:49,supposed to do.
00:03:49,00:03:53,And he just heard of this Chuck Norris film that was about no-holds-bad fighting and it
00:03:53,00:03:54,was called the Octagon.
00:03:54,00:03:55,"So he said, ""So did it."
00:03:55,00:03:56,"Let's make it an Octagon."""
00:03:56,00:03:57,Yeah.
00:03:57,00:03:58,So cool.
00:03:58,00:04:00,"It's quite, I mean it's as good a shape as any, right?"
00:04:00,00:04:04,"In fact, you could say, well you could say it's better than a square because it's closer"
00:04:04,00:04:05,to a ring.
00:04:05,00:04:06,Yeah.
00:04:06,00:04:09,Like a ring is something with infinite sides and an Octagon's got more sides than a square.
00:04:09,00:04:10,Right.
00:04:10,00:04:11,Compared to infinity though.
00:04:11,00:04:14,Hardly more on the way to that many sides.
00:04:14,00:04:16,They should have a dodecahedron.
00:04:16,00:04:17,They should.
00:04:17,00:04:18,Yeah.
00:04:18,00:04:19,That'd be good.
00:04:19,00:04:21,"Just for the visual, if you're listening to this right now and you're thinking, well, what's"
00:04:21,00:04:22,this Octagon look like?
00:04:22,00:04:24,It's steel mesh all around it.
00:04:24,00:04:28,"And the ring wall, as it were, the steel mesh wall, goes up taller than the, let's say,"
00:04:28,00:04:29,the Empire Stable.
00:04:29,00:04:30,Yeah.
00:04:30,00:04:35,So they have to be lowered in by crane into the ring.
00:04:35,00:04:36,Yeah.
00:04:36,00:04:38,We were saying that it's quite no-holds-bad.
00:04:38,00:04:40,It gets quite violent.
00:04:40,00:04:44,And people were kind of outraged in the '90s when ultimate fighting and mixed martial arts
00:04:44,00:04:46,was invented.
00:04:46,00:04:49,"And the thing that I think outraged people the most, or the thing that became the epitome"
00:04:49,00:04:51,"of it, was the fact that it was done with bare knuckles."
00:04:51,00:04:53,So it was bare knuckle fighting.
00:04:53,00:04:56,"So people were saying, this is so dangerous, look how barbaric it is."
00:04:56,00:05:00,"And with bare knuckles, you know, that just goes to show how barbaric it is."
00:05:00,00:05:04,And so they banned the bare knuckle element of it after a few years and added gloves to make
00:05:04,00:05:06,it safer.
00:05:06,00:05:08,"And in fact, that made it much more dangerous."
00:05:08,00:05:12,Because the reason that bare knuckle is better than wearing gloves is that if you punch
00:05:12,00:05:16,"someone super hard with your bare knuckle, then you basically break your fist."
00:05:16,00:05:19,And so most people don't want to punch people too hard.
00:05:19,00:05:22,"Whereas as soon as you've got boxing gloves on, then you can punch someone much, much harder"
00:05:22,00:05:23,without damaging yourself.
00:05:23,00:05:27,"So by adding gloves, you kind of save the hands, but instead you give people much more severe"
00:05:27,00:05:28,brain damage.
00:05:28,00:05:31,"That was quite aggressive the way that you said that fact, because you had a fist the"
00:05:31,00:05:32,whole time.
00:05:32,00:05:34,And you were kind of jabbing the air.
00:05:34,00:05:35,"Yeah, it felt good."
00:05:35,00:05:38,I could see the attraction actually.
00:05:38,00:05:43,There was a study on a few years ago where researchers worked out a code for how intense somebody
00:05:43,00:05:44,smiles.
00:05:44,00:05:48,"And then on the day prior to fight, when the fighters have that traditional face-off, like"
00:05:48,00:05:54,"press conferencing, these researchers watched 152 different UFC fighters and worked out how"
00:05:54,00:05:55,much they were smiling.
00:05:55,00:06:00,"And then they found that the more a fighter smiles, the more likely they are to lose the fight."
00:06:00,00:06:03,"And they think it's due to the link of like, if you smile or you have lower testosterone"
00:06:03,00:06:08,"and you're less aggressive in nature, and they worked out that whilst in the short term,"
00:06:08,00:06:10,it means they're more likely to lose that fight the next day.
00:06:10,00:06:13,They're not more likely to lose all the fights coming up.
00:06:13,00:06:16,So it's literally how much you are smiling the day before your fight.
00:06:16,00:06:17,Why?
00:06:17,00:06:18,The day before your fight.
00:06:18,00:06:23,"Well, this is interesting, because Conor McGregor has been sparring against these pro-boxers"
00:06:23,00:06:26,to sort of get him into shape.
00:06:26,00:06:29,So one of them has come out because he-
00:06:29,00:06:34,"That's great, he's really good with it, and I just want to say congratulations, mate."
00:06:34,00:06:37,Wish you're the luck in your love life.
00:06:37,00:06:42,"No, he sort of was kicked out of the Conor McGregor camp, and then he revealed a lot of the"
00:06:42,00:06:43,process of how he's training.
00:06:43,00:06:49,And one of the things he's doing is he is doing long stair-offs with these boxers.
00:06:49,00:06:51,So he's practicing the stair.
00:06:51,00:06:55,"I just would say at his stage, I would not be focusing on that element of the game."
00:06:55,00:06:57,I don't care how important the stair is.
00:06:57,00:07:02,"But isn't it true that we did say a few podcasts ago that Divers, professional Divers, half"
00:07:02,00:07:05,of their job is climbing up to the top of the set.
00:07:05,00:07:06,"Exactly, yes, thank you, James."
00:07:06,00:07:08,Really half of his job is walking to the rig.
00:07:08,00:07:13,"This is hype, if you were diving from a high board, half your job is climbing ladders."
00:07:13,00:07:17,"I remember it vividly, it's ingrained in my brain."
00:07:17,00:07:19,And we use the word fact very loosely.
00:07:19,00:07:20,Yeah.
00:07:20,00:07:23,So using half of a fighter's job is staring contest.
00:07:23,00:07:26,"Yeah, if you're really good at not blinking there, you could probably win the blinking"
00:07:26,00:07:29,"competition, dry out your opponent's eyes, and then they'd be blinded."
00:07:29,00:07:34,"It's not a blinking competition, so it's not like chess boxing, where you play a bit"
00:07:34,00:07:36,"of chess, then you play a bit of boxing."
00:07:36,00:07:40,"It's like you fight for three minutes, and then you just sit there and stare at someone."
00:07:40,00:07:42,"I mean, that would, I would watch that."
00:07:42,00:07:43,That would be amazing.
00:07:43,00:07:49,If he had just like a smaller belt for a blinking champion for the contest.
00:07:49,00:07:53,"But it could be that you have three minutes of fighting, then you have a staring competition,"
00:07:53,00:07:58,and whoever wins a staring competition gets one free punch at the start of the next round.
00:07:58,00:07:59,"Oh, yeah."
00:07:59,00:08:00,Nice.
00:08:00,00:08:03,"You should invent that as a sport, and put it in a non-agun or something, and play more"
00:08:03,00:08:06,"creative, something amazing."
00:08:06,00:08:08,"And the kicking can be really damaging, can't it?"
00:08:08,00:08:14,So I think if we talked about the fight between Mahamadali and Antonio and Noke before.
00:08:14,00:08:18,So this is a fight that's seen as basically the precursor to MMA to mixed martial arts.
00:08:18,00:08:22,"And this was when Mahamadali took on a Japanese wrestler called Antonio and Noke, and"
00:08:22,00:08:26,the 70s in the 1970s.
00:08:26,00:08:27,Can you say MMA?
00:08:27,00:08:28,"Yeah, MMA."
00:08:28,00:08:29,Not MMA.
00:08:29,00:08:30,"Oh, sorry."
00:08:30,00:08:31,Yeah.
00:08:31,00:08:33,This is the precursor to MMA mixed martial.
00:08:33,00:08:34,MMA.
00:08:34,00:08:35,Wow.
00:08:35,00:08:40,This is the precursor to mixed martial arts.
00:08:40,00:08:44,And this was when Mahamadali took on this Japanese wrestler called Antonio.
00:08:44,00:08:45,Mahamad Ali.
00:08:45,00:08:52,"Anyway, the point was Mahamadali and Antonio and Noke had this"
00:08:52,00:08:56,fight to see which of the disciplines was going to win.
00:08:56,00:08:59,And Noke caused massive damage to Ali.
00:08:59,00:09:01,"So basically he spent the whole time lying on the floor, I think."
00:09:01,00:09:02,Yeah.
00:09:02,00:09:03,Almost the entirety of the time.
00:09:03,00:09:06,He lay on the floor and just kicked Mahamadali in the shins really hard.
00:09:06,00:09:08,And Ali got blood clots after that.
00:09:08,00:09:12,And I think his legs were permanently damaged from then on to have surgery and stuff because
00:09:12,00:09:13,of it.
00:09:13,00:09:17,"But it was called a draw, I think, which was good because it meant that neither of them"
00:09:17,00:09:19,had disgraced themselves in front of their fans.
00:09:19,00:09:20,Yeah.
00:09:20,00:09:24,And he said afterwards that the reason he just kicked Mahamad Ali is because Ali had such
00:09:24,00:09:30,"devoted fans that he'd been warned if he laid a hand on him, then his fans would kill him."
00:09:30,00:09:32,So he decided to go at him with the feet instead.
00:09:32,00:09:33,Oh.
00:09:33,00:09:34,Yeah.
00:09:34,00:09:37,"Do you think when Mahamad Ali's supporters came up to him later and tried to attack him,"
00:09:37,00:09:39,"he's like, no, no, I didn't lay my hands on him."
00:09:39,00:09:40,I think that's what he said.
00:09:40,00:09:41,I think that's what he said.
00:09:41,00:09:42,I think that's what he said.
00:09:42,00:09:43,You've got to start.
00:09:43,00:09:45,You've got to get back and read a small print of off-threat.
00:09:45,00:09:46,He did.
00:09:46,00:09:52,"I love how that like as fans would be going up, going, hey, man, we're going to kick your ass."
00:09:52,00:09:54,"Like, no, this guy just kicked Mahamad Ali's ass."
00:09:54,00:09:57,"Like, yeah, you stand no chance to get it."
00:09:57,00:09:58,Yeah.
00:09:58,00:09:59,Exactly.
00:09:59,00:10:03,"And when the angry mob comes down, he can just lie on his back and kick the police."
00:10:03,00:10:08,Abidab is not the only investor in the UFC.
00:10:08,00:10:09,There are many other people who...
00:10:09,00:10:12,"Well, he said they only have 10% so I'm not surprised."
00:10:12,00:10:18,Other people who have a stake in the UFC are LL Cool J.
00:10:18,00:10:19,Who's named?
00:10:19,00:10:20,Who's named?
00:10:20,00:10:22,You know where LL Cool J comes from?
00:10:22,00:10:23,No.
00:10:23,00:10:25,It's short for Ladies Love Cool James.
00:10:25,00:10:26,Really?
00:10:26,00:10:27,Yeah.
00:10:27,00:10:28,"Oh, that's very cool."
00:10:28,00:10:30,Does anyone ever cool to you that James?
00:10:30,00:10:31,No.
00:10:31,00:10:33,"Yeah, you sound like you tried to make that take off first and no one would have it."
00:10:33,00:10:35,And then you could do your work.
00:10:35,00:10:41,You just got there just too quickly otherwise that's all they've become.
00:10:41,00:10:47,"So Calvin Harris, Flea from the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Trey Parker of South Park."
00:10:47,00:10:48,Really?
00:10:48,00:10:54,"Maria Sharapova, the tennis star, and Sylvester Stallone and Conan O'Brien, who is the late-night"
00:10:54,00:10:58,"talk show host in America, who's been having Conor Gregoron a lot recently."
00:10:58,00:11:00,"And I was like, ""I hadn't didn't know he had an interest."
00:11:00,00:11:01,"He's got a business interest."""
00:11:01,00:11:02,Yeah.
00:11:02,00:11:06,That's quite a who's who of spot stars and...
00:11:06,00:11:07,Yeah.
00:11:07,00:11:09,"The buy-in was $250,000."
00:11:09,00:11:11,So I think they all bought the sort of the minimum of it.
00:11:11,00:11:16,"But again, this is back in 2010 and the sport exploded, so those guys are probably making"
00:11:16,00:11:17,some money.
00:11:17,00:11:19,"I can't believe all those people are making some money, finally."
00:11:19,00:11:20,Finally.
00:11:20,00:11:23,"I mean, after years of poverty, L.Courchain."
00:11:23,00:11:26,"Well, I mean, you picked the one name that probably doesn't need some money."
00:11:26,00:11:27,I don't know.
00:11:27,00:11:28,The only one I could remember.
00:11:28,00:11:32,That was the fact that Conor suddenly was doing the round and read it this week about
00:11:32,00:11:36,"UFC, which is that there's a fighter called Rory and McDonald's and so at the end of"
00:11:36,00:11:40,"all the fights, they have walk, no, the beginning of all the fights, they have walkout music,"
00:11:40,00:11:41,so an introduced each fighter.
00:11:41,00:11:45,And he was quite unhappy about a lot of the music he was getting and the guy that was organising
00:11:45,00:11:46,it.
00:11:46,00:11:49,"But he didn't really say anything because he thought that he'd manage everything, we're"
00:11:49,00:11:51,just organising it themselves.
00:11:51,00:11:55,"And eventually he mentioned something and the guy who was organising music was like,"
00:11:55,00:11:57,"""No, I thought you were requesting all of these."""
00:11:57,00:12:01,And it turned out that he'd had his phone number changed a couple of years ago and a fan
00:12:01,00:12:09,"got a hold of his phone number and was requesting stupid music, like Rihanna's We Found Love and"
00:12:09,00:12:13,"MC Hammer's You Can't Touch This, so all these songs were kind of dissing him and making"
00:12:13,00:12:14,fun of him a bit.
00:12:14,00:12:16,It was just somebody taking the piss like three years.
00:12:16,00:12:19,"I could think of worse songs, I could have put it, but I'd have sent the Tehli Tubby's"
00:12:19,00:12:20,theme up.
00:12:20,00:12:21,"Yeah, exactly."
00:12:21,00:12:26,I think whoever the fan was did a good job to just about find that level where they didn't
00:12:26,00:12:36,get found out for like years.
00:12:36,00:12:41,Column MacGregor got in trouble quite recently for saying that he could beat Jesus in a fight.
00:12:41,00:12:46,"Yeah, this was last year, he said, ""There's not a man alive that could beat me, but Jesus"
00:12:46,00:12:51,"isn't alive, so maybe he could and come back from the dead, but I don't know, I'd still"
00:12:51,00:12:52,"whoop his ass."""
00:12:52,00:12:56,"But that's true, because you only have to lie down for like ten seconds for your hour as"
00:12:56,00:12:58,Jesus would take three days to get up again.
00:12:58,00:12:59,Nice.
00:12:59,00:13:00,Yeah.
00:13:00,00:13:03,"So he'd get back up, but they'd actually converted the arena into a Little Mix concert"
00:13:03,00:13:04,at that point.
00:13:04,00:13:16,"Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is LL Cool, Jake."
00:13:16,00:13:24,"Okay, my fact this week is that Palau is about to pass a law, meaning that every hotel"
00:13:24,00:13:27,in the country has to be five star.
00:13:27,00:13:31,I will admit that I spent a good two minutes when you sent this by email looking for the
00:13:31,00:13:34,"footnote, because I thought the star was an asterisk and I was like, ""Five watts."""
00:13:34,00:13:38,I was like scrolling through all the replies.
00:13:38,00:13:45,"So what this is is a new law to try and make just high-end tourism in this country,"
00:13:45,00:13:49,"allow which is in the Pacific, and they're suffering from climate change more than everyone"
00:13:49,00:13:54,"else really, like all these Pacific countries are, and they have problems with infrastructure"
00:13:54,00:13:58,"when they're getting the loads of tourists in, and so they think, ""Well, if we only have"
00:13:58,00:14:02,"high-end tourists, that means fewer tourists, but still the same amount of money."""
00:14:02,00:14:06,"They want new hotels to come in with their own walled treatment system, with their own"
00:14:06,00:14:08,"power, and stuff like that."
00:14:08,00:14:10,"And so Palau is a collection of islands, right?"
00:14:10,00:14:15,"So is this every single one of their 280-ish islands having five star hotels, or is there"
00:14:15,00:14:16,a central spot to it?
00:14:16,00:14:21,"Well, it will be, if you want to put a hotel in any of those places, it'll have to be five"
00:14:21,00:14:22,star.
00:14:22,00:14:23,"Yeah, and I've been to Palau."
00:14:23,00:14:24,Happy occasion.
00:14:24,00:14:25,"Yeah, I did."
00:14:25,00:14:29,"We went when I was a kid, because I lived in Hong Kong, and that's not too far away."
00:14:29,00:14:30,It's quite far.
00:14:30,00:14:33,"I mean, you didn't row there, did you?"
00:14:33,00:14:35,"No, we got the holidays."
00:14:35,00:14:36,The jet ski.
00:14:36,00:14:42,"No, yeah, we, we, uh, holidayed there, and it was in, I mean, this is, we're talking 15,"
00:14:42,00:14:48,"20 years ago, so it was in huts by the beach, so, um, but those can be five star, obviously."
00:14:48,00:14:49,Yeah.
00:14:49,00:14:52,I just know already that you're exactly the kind of person that are now working to keep
00:14:52,00:14:53,out on it.
00:14:53,00:14:54,Yeah.
00:14:54,00:14:57,You're the person this policy is aimed at.
00:14:57,00:15:04,"It took us 15 years to get the law through, but it's definitely not coming back now."
00:15:04,00:15:08,"So I've got some stuff on hotels, okay, um, there was, there's a really good article on the"
00:15:08,00:15:12,economist about the various standards that hotels have to stick to.
00:15:12,00:15:17,"Um, and so for instance, the Hilton chain of hotels, there's a manual that stipulates"
00:15:17,00:15:21,that staff have to answer the phones after three rings exactly.
00:15:21,00:15:24,"For instance, um, whereas intercontinental, you have to wait four rings."
00:15:24,00:15:25,Is that right?
00:15:25,00:15:28,"Well, you used to work for intercontinental hotels."
00:15:28,00:15:30,Did you ever answer the phone before or after four rings?
00:15:30,00:15:31,I think I might have done.
00:15:31,00:15:35,"Well, that is that why you're working here."
00:15:35,00:15:37,"I quite appreciate that rule, actually, because it is quite startling when you ring someone"
00:15:37,00:15:38,they pick up really fast.
00:15:38,00:15:39,"Yeah, totally."
00:15:39,00:15:44,"Um, they have, there's one chain which wasn't allowing itself to be named, which all of"
00:15:44,00:15:50,"its hotels, all omelettes have to match a laminated model omelette that they have there,"
00:15:50,00:15:53,which is cigar shaped and they have to model it on that.
00:15:53,00:15:54,Right.
00:15:54,00:15:58,"Um, yeah, intercontinental also, you might remember this rule, James, specifies that the"
00:15:58,00:16:05,"rooms have to offer at least four pornographic films. At least four. At least four, yeah. You"
00:16:05,00:16:06,can't go up.
00:16:06,00:16:09,"You don't want to turn up for the Zolli three polygraphs, do you?"
00:16:09,00:16:13,"Can you imagine calling up reception and be like, hi, could do with a couple more?"
00:16:13,00:16:19,I seem to be missing one of my four. Yeah. So this is your first night. I know. It's been
00:16:19,00:16:23,a long session and I just need one or two more to kick me over to the end.
00:16:23,00:16:27,Could you change the sheets while you're up there please?
00:16:27,00:16:35,"By the way, you picked up on the fourth ring and I don't know, more a three ring guy."
00:16:35,00:16:38,"We didn't ask about your sexual preference, is it?"
00:16:38,00:16:46,A hotel in Colorado downloads pictures of your family from the internet and frames them
00:16:46,00:16:51,for when you arrive at the hotel because either brilliant or the most creepy thing I've
00:16:51,00:16:52,ever heard in my entire life.
00:16:52,00:16:53,Yeah.
00:16:53,00:16:56,I think I know which one of those it is. There's also just one more which is a hotel in
00:16:56,00:17:03,"Mexico, a luxury hotel where they do research into you beforehand and the housekeeper matches"
00:17:03,00:17:08,the colour of the thread in the guest sewing kits to the clothes that you're wearing.
00:17:08,00:17:11,"And again, they get that from photos on social media do you think?"
00:17:11,00:17:14,I think actually it must be from when you've arrived so there must be an emergency you arrive
00:17:14,00:17:18,"at the reception desk and they're like, she's got a red dress on, quick, get the red thread"
00:17:18,00:17:19,in the book.
00:17:19,00:17:22,That's good because most of the pictures of me on social media from fancy dress parties.
00:17:22,00:17:28,"So you just get, I don't know, what kind of stuff do you wear, you get some face paint."
00:17:28,00:17:33,There were a couple of zero star hotels in Switzerland and the first one was in a Cold War
00:17:33,00:17:38,"bunker so there were no TVs, there were no separate bathrooms, there's no daylight because"
00:17:38,00:17:39,it's in a bunker.
00:17:39,00:17:43,"But it doesn't look too bad, it's basically like a kind of low-end youth hostel."
00:17:43,00:17:49,The second one is just a bed and a bit of a wall up a mountain in Switzerland and then
00:17:49,00:17:53,there's a butler who is actually a local farmer who comes and is responsible for giving you
00:17:53,00:17:59,"the weather forecast and telling you jokes and it's all about, it's sort of ties some"
00:17:59,00:18:01,critique on hotel culture and it's good though.
00:18:01,00:18:02,It does sound good though.
00:18:02,00:18:05,I reckon I'd pay for that in the hotel to have a farmer come and tell me jokes.
00:18:05,00:18:06,Yeah me too.
00:18:06,00:18:09,Especially if they check my social media and saw what kind of jokes I like.
00:18:09,00:18:10,Good point.
00:18:10,00:18:11,Yeah.
00:18:11,00:18:14,"He'd be like, this is an easy one, yeah."
00:18:14,00:18:23,Or labored tons.
00:18:23,00:18:26,"Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is Alex."
00:18:26,00:18:32,My fact this week is that every Canadian citizen is entitled to a free government issue portrait
00:18:32,00:18:33,of the Queen.
00:18:33,00:18:34,"Ah, of our Queen."
00:18:34,00:18:35,Of our Queen.
00:18:35,00:18:36,And their Queen.
00:18:36,00:18:37,And their Queen.
00:18:37,00:18:41,They're actually entitled to five portraits of the royal family in various combinations.
00:18:41,00:18:47,And they choose whichever members they like as in if you prefer princess Eugenie and
00:18:47,00:18:49,Prince Andrew you can have those two.
00:18:49,00:18:50,You know what I don't think they're on offer.
00:18:50,00:18:53,I think it's mainly like Philip and the Queen and I think Prince William.
00:18:53,00:18:56,"Yeah, it's the big, it's the headline, it's the main characters."
00:18:56,00:19:00,But there are just five different ones and you can order up to like one of each so you
00:19:00,00:19:01,"can get five in total, right?"
00:19:01,00:19:05,"So you'd be like, how come on, you got to unlock Eugenie with your dedication."
00:19:05,00:19:10,"Because even though there's a prince, not original oil paintings every time you"
00:19:10,00:19:11,do.
00:19:11,00:19:13,It's a huge frame.
00:19:13,00:19:14,"No, these are just paints."
00:19:14,00:19:15,"Oh, you can download them like free."
00:19:15,00:19:17,So I've downloaded mine even though not.
00:19:17,00:19:18,You're not Canadian.
00:19:18,00:19:19,I know.
00:19:19,00:19:20,But that was big as a lot.
00:19:20,00:19:24,So this is part of a lot of services that you can get from the government of Canada.
00:19:24,00:19:30,"If you ring 1-800-O Canada, you get, I know, you get onto the helpline that provides"
00:19:30,00:19:34,that information on Canadian governmental programs and services and stuff like that.
00:19:34,00:19:35,It's really cool.
00:19:35,00:19:38,But the O is that a zero or is it the O in the keyboard?
00:19:38,00:19:40,"No, the letter O from the numbers."
00:19:40,00:19:41,Really?
00:19:41,00:19:46,"Because when you give someone's phone number, you often use the word O to mean zero, don't"
00:19:46,00:19:47,you like O-800?
00:19:47,00:19:48,"Sure, yeah."
00:19:48,00:19:49,It's really convenient.
00:19:49,00:19:51,A lot of Canadians getting through to them random pizza place on my arrow.
00:19:51,00:19:53,Demanding pictures of the Queen.
00:19:53,00:19:55,What's going on?
00:19:55,00:19:58,"Interestingly, when you go to the website, I look to the pictures as well."
00:19:58,00:19:59,I couldn't see as many as five actually.
00:19:59,00:20:03,I saw you could have the Queen or Philip or the Queen with Philip.
00:20:03,00:20:06,So those are your options that I saw.
00:20:06,00:20:10,"And they have lots of rules, though, for if you do download them, for what you're allowed"
00:20:10,00:20:11,and they're allowed to not do with them.
00:20:11,00:20:16,"So for example, you cannot use the images on adhesive seals."
00:20:16,00:20:17,That's one.
00:20:17,00:20:19,Lots of adhesive seal.
00:20:19,00:20:20,I guess.
00:20:20,00:20:21,Like a sticker on an envelope?
00:20:21,00:20:23,"Yeah, that's what I was thinking like on an envelope."
00:20:23,00:20:25,I guess a stamp is what they're saying.
00:20:25,00:20:26,I see.
00:20:26,00:20:28,Are you sealers in that holds the envelope together?
00:20:28,00:20:29,Yeah.
00:20:29,00:20:30,So you're not allowed that.
00:20:30,00:20:34,"You know, all the time, rather than buying a normal envelope, you just buy one and"
00:20:34,00:20:35,then use a sticker.
00:20:35,00:20:36,I always do that.
00:20:36,00:20:38,"But then I always put a sticker of the Queen on, so now I'm a bit worried."
00:20:38,00:20:39,"Oh, yeah."
00:20:39,00:20:42,"You got to recall all those postcards from over the years, James."
00:20:42,00:20:44,Can you recall a postcard?
00:20:44,00:20:45,Yeah.
00:20:45,00:20:51,"The postcard just locks on, you know, sorry, I'm just going to get that."
00:20:51,00:20:53,She doesn't wish you were here anymore.
00:20:53,00:20:54,Yeah.
00:20:54,00:20:58,"Also, can I just say postcards, the one thing you don't have to put them in the envelope?"
00:20:58,00:21:03,"As the words came out of my mouth, I don't have no one notices that."
00:21:03,00:21:09,"And the one final thing you're not allowed to use it for, there's other things, but another"
00:21:09,00:21:13,thing you're not allowed to use it for is to advertise if the Queen or Philip have visited
00:21:13,00:21:14,your shop.
00:21:14,00:21:17,"So the example they give is, for example, if the Royal Highness is the Duke and Duchess of"
00:21:17,00:21:22,"Cambridge were to visit a cheese shop, that shop could not use a photograph of the occasion"
00:21:22,00:21:24,to advertise its goods.
00:21:24,00:21:27,Is that like when you go into like a curry house and they've got like a sign verse of
00:21:27,00:21:28,Gary Linnicka?
00:21:28,00:21:29,Yeah.
00:21:29,00:21:30,Or like a Laundra.
00:21:30,00:21:33,"But it's always Gary Linnicka, it's always Gary Linnicka."
00:21:33,00:21:35,He just visits Laundra and curry houses all the time.
00:21:35,00:21:40,"It must be that Gary Linnicka's going to a lot of curry houses with signed photos, right?"
00:21:40,00:21:41,Yeah.
00:21:41,00:21:42,Yeah.
00:21:42,00:21:44,"Or are they, I mean, have you ever seen him on any linen?"
00:21:44,00:21:45,I haven't.
00:21:45,00:21:47,So that means it's the same photo of Gary Linnicka.
00:21:47,00:21:48,Right.
00:21:48,00:21:49,It's the same.
00:21:49,00:21:50,Yeah.
00:21:50,00:21:52,I think that he just doesn't have an oven or a washing machine.
00:21:52,00:21:55,So he always constantly has to use the Laundra and eat out or something like that.
00:21:55,00:21:58,"We go to the curry house, it spills curry alone for himself, so he has to get everything"
00:21:58,00:21:59,to like these.
00:21:59,00:22:02,"An adorable, messy eater."
00:22:02,00:22:07,"Something else that you can get free in Canada, that's quite cool, is the flag that's flown"
00:22:07,00:22:11,"at the top of their equivalent of Big Ben, basically, which is the Ottawa Peace Tower, so it's"
00:22:11,00:22:15,a huge clock that's sort of part of the Parliament buildings.
00:22:15,00:22:20,"And you can write off, you can sign a form and write off and request one of those flags"
00:22:20,00:22:25,"because every single day, or about 250 days of the year, they'd take the flag down and"
00:22:25,00:22:27,they'd change it and put up a new one.
00:22:27,00:22:31,And then they wash that one and iron it out and they send it to whoever in Canada has requested
00:22:31,00:22:32,it.
00:22:32,00:22:33,Really?
00:22:33,00:22:34,"They must be massive, though, aren't they?"
00:22:34,00:22:35,They are big.
00:22:35,00:22:36,Yes.
00:22:36,00:22:38,"And so there must be more than one person must request it, so."
00:22:38,00:22:39,Right.
00:22:39,00:22:40,So this is what's happened.
00:22:40,00:22:42,I think you've hit upon a problem.
00:22:42,00:22:46,"They've had at least 20,000 requests at this point, which means that there's now a 73-year"
00:22:46,00:22:48,waiting list to get your flag.
00:22:48,00:22:49,What?
00:22:49,00:22:52,So you can have delivered to your grand children.
00:22:52,00:22:56,"You've got to be pretty young to make an application now, don't you?"
00:22:56,00:22:57,You really do to be successful.
00:22:57,00:22:59,But why do they keep giving away flags?
00:22:59,00:23:01,"Sorry, why do they need a new one every day?"
00:23:01,00:23:02,I don't think they do.
00:23:02,00:23:03,I think this is just an idea they had.
00:23:03,00:23:04,Right.
00:23:04,00:23:08,They had a thing to do to donate a flag each day to some-- or most days of the year to someone
00:23:08,00:23:09,in the country.
00:23:09,00:23:10,Good.
00:23:10,00:23:11,Every day they replace the flag.
00:23:11,00:23:12,Not every year.
00:23:12,00:23:14,It's about-- so it's every weekday except bank holidays are apparently when the weather's
00:23:14,00:23:15,poor.
00:23:15,00:23:17,They don't bother changing it.
00:23:17,00:23:21,Every Canadian citizen is entitled to three hours to vote whenever there's an election.
00:23:21,00:23:22,In the booth?
00:23:22,00:23:23,No.
00:23:23,00:23:24,It doesn't.
00:23:24,00:23:27,So you'll have three hours of work to vote basically.
00:23:27,00:23:28,"Oh, right."
00:23:28,00:23:30,So what are you doing in there?
00:23:30,00:23:37,"Basically, if your work schedule means that you finish work at, say, four o'clock or something"
00:23:37,00:23:40,"and the polls close at seven o'clock, then that's fine."
00:23:40,00:23:44,"But if your work schedule means you don't have three hours spared, they have to give you"
00:23:44,00:23:45,three hours off.
00:23:45,00:23:46,That's good.
00:23:46,00:23:47,"Yeah, it's good there, isn't it?"
00:23:47,00:23:50,"Yeah, it's a lot of time to get to a polling station."
00:23:50,00:23:51,Yeah.
00:23:51,00:23:52,Cool.
00:23:52,00:23:53,Probably have lunch as well.
00:23:53,00:23:54,Yeah.
00:23:54,00:23:58,"I guess the problem I might not even vote, to be honest."
00:23:58,00:24:00,I got another Queen Canada fact.
00:24:00,00:24:08,"So the Queen appears on the banknotes of Canada, actually, doesn't Australia and all around"
00:24:08,00:24:10,the Commonwealth.
00:24:10,00:24:15,But interesting claim that Canada has over it is they were the first country even beating
00:24:15,00:24:20,the UK to having the Queen on a banknote before anyone else.
00:24:20,00:24:22,"Was it like as soon as she became Queen, they rushed it out?"
00:24:22,00:24:23,"No, it was pretty."
00:24:23,00:24:25,"It was, this was in 1935."
00:24:25,00:24:26,She's just a child.
00:24:26,00:24:28,"Yeah, she was nine-year-old."
00:24:28,00:24:29,You remember this?
00:24:29,00:24:32,I remember reading it before you just said it.
00:24:32,00:24:33,I knew it.
00:24:33,00:24:35,Time to shovel her.
00:24:35,00:24:38,I went back to order my flag.
00:24:38,00:24:44,"Did you know in Australia, you can also get a portrait of the Queen."
00:24:44,00:24:48,But you can also request CD and DVD recordings of the National Anthem if you want them.
00:24:48,00:24:49,Really?
00:24:49,00:24:54,"If you Google constituents request program, you can just ask your local MP or a political"
00:24:54,00:24:58,representative for that and you can request a booklet on the flags of Australia.
00:24:58,00:25:02,You can get a booklet on Australia's National Symbols and yet you can get a DVD of the National
00:25:02,00:25:03,Anthem.
00:25:03,00:25:07,"So can someone listening to this in Australia, please do that and send us a photo of you"
00:25:07,00:25:08,with your DVD?
00:25:08,00:25:09,"Yeah, please do."
00:25:09,00:25:12,"Actually, I quite like a photo of someone from Canada with a free portrait of the Queen."
00:25:12,00:25:13,"Yeah, yeah."
00:25:13,00:25:14,"Yeah, yeah."
00:25:14,00:25:17,"Okay, if you're in a Commonwealth and you have this option, if you're listening in"
00:25:17,00:25:28,"Britain, just a picture of Gary Linnaco will be great and please post it to us on our kiwai account."
00:25:28,00:25:33,"Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show and that is Chazinsky."
00:25:33,00:25:38,My fact this week is that the first ever in cyclopedia Britannica said that humans were
00:25:38,00:25:40,divided into five categories.
00:25:40,00:25:48,"These categories were American, European, Asian, African and monstrous, the five types of"
00:25:48,00:25:49,humans.
00:25:49,00:25:51,Did they believe that there were monsters?
00:25:51,00:25:52,Is that what we're saying?
00:25:52,00:25:55,"I read this in this really good book I've just started reading, it's called ""You Could Look"
00:25:55,00:26:01,"It Up"" by a guy called Jack Lynch and so what it was was that there was kind of an age"
00:26:01,00:26:05,of exploration and there were often a lot of rumors about the kind of people you'd find
00:26:05,00:26:07,in strange places.
00:26:07,00:26:10,"Maybe there were kind of mythical, semi-human creatures around so there were reports"
00:26:10,00:26:15,for instance of men who had feet backwards or men who didn't have any noses.
00:26:15,00:26:20,There were reports of humans who had dogs heads and who communicated by barking and so there
00:26:20,00:26:22,were kind of these rumors about mythical monsters.
00:26:22,00:26:28,So you are describing Bigfoot and werewolves and these are all still real things out there
00:26:28,00:26:29,today Anna.
00:26:29,00:26:33,"So this was the casual term of the users to cover themselves, to be like anything we don't,"
00:26:33,00:26:35,it's in miscellaneous basically.
00:26:35,00:26:41,"And this went back to Leneas who classified homo sapiens 10 years earlier, so in 1758."
00:26:41,00:26:46,And he actually said that there was homo ferrous as well as a different species which was wild
00:26:46,00:26:49,men and then homo monstrous which was monsters.
00:26:49,00:26:53,And yeah so we're not quite sure what they are but we're looking made up people.
00:26:53,00:26:59,So I was reading up on the first ever encyclopedia Britannica because weirdly as you almost feel
00:26:59,00:27:04,like the authors should be famous names and I didn't know a single one.
00:27:04,00:27:08,So there were two guys who effectively brought it together.
00:27:08,00:27:14,One was called Colin McFarcher and that's exactly how he pronounced it.
00:27:14,00:27:16,Quick to question Mark at the end.
00:27:16,00:27:17,He never knew.
00:27:17,00:27:23,The name's McFarquad Colin McFarquad?
00:27:23,00:27:24,Yeah.
00:27:24,00:27:30,"He also sat up with a guy called Andrew Bell and Alex, your surname is Bell, we're talking"
00:27:30,00:27:31,it all about her.
00:27:31,00:27:32,Yeah.
00:27:32,00:27:38,"As for the encyclopedia Britannica, he was the engraver, he was the one who did all of the drawings"
00:27:38,00:27:42,"which on our podcast when you're not on the microphone with us, you are our illustrator"
00:27:42,00:27:43,for all the things.
00:27:43,00:27:45,So you both have the same surname.
00:27:45,00:27:46,That's exciting.
00:27:46,00:27:50,I like the way that you said Bell as if there was no exclamation points at the end of it
00:27:50,00:27:51,as well.
00:27:51,00:27:52,So you got McFarquad.
00:27:52,00:27:53,What?
00:27:53,00:27:54,Bell.
00:27:54,00:27:55,Yeah.
00:27:55,00:28:00,I don't know what's going to go with my pronunciation but Bell was a very interesting
00:28:00,00:28:01,guy.
00:28:01,00:28:02,He was quite small.
00:28:02,00:28:06,He was four foot six and he had a big nose that he would sometimes try and hide by wearing
00:28:06,00:28:10,a paper mash a version in order to hide the bigness of his nose.
00:28:10,00:28:11,He was surely bigger.
00:28:11,00:28:12,Yeah.
00:28:12,00:28:13,"You would say, right?"
00:28:13,00:28:14,No.
00:28:14,00:28:16,I think he was a joker and he did it whenever anyone stared at his nose.
00:28:16,00:28:19,"He put a bigger one up a bit to say, are you looking at my nose, bitch?"
00:28:19,00:28:25,"I think he was like, because he was going to be in my book."
00:28:25,00:28:26,Bitch.
00:28:26,00:28:43,"He was going to be like, the tallest one, please."
00:28:43,00:28:44,I like that.
00:28:44,00:28:45,I do.
00:28:45,00:28:46,Going to hire a horse.
00:28:46,00:28:51,They've just got the same options like at the car rental place where you're like color and
00:28:51,00:28:52,height and compact.
00:28:52,00:28:56,Do you leave it fully fed or do you do someone else do that?
00:28:56,00:28:57,Yeah.
00:28:57,00:29:02,"So the oldest known encyclopedia Britannica is still in use, apparently, and it was only discovered"
00:29:02,00:29:08,in 2010 and there's an 18 volume set that was from 1797 and it just belonged to this family
00:29:08,00:29:11,in Chelmsford and they'd used it growing up and stuff and they were still using it all the
00:29:11,00:29:12,time.
00:29:12,00:29:17,"They bought it for 15 pounds, the full set, which seems unbelievable for 18 volumes of encyclopedia."
00:29:17,00:29:19,"But now it's worth like 9,000, right?"
00:29:19,00:29:20,Yeah.
00:29:20,00:29:21,Under sampling.
00:29:21,00:29:24,"It seems like not very much money for the encyclopedia, old, is encyclopedia."
00:29:24,00:29:25,I agree.
00:29:25,00:29:26,Which doesn't seem to go for any.
00:29:26,00:29:29,"Yeah, but you can get them on CD-ROM these days."
00:29:29,00:29:30,"Yeah, it's true."
00:29:30,00:29:31,Dig.
00:29:31,00:29:32,"Yeah, that's what he did."
00:29:32,00:29:33,It was so with it.
00:29:33,00:29:34,Yeah.
00:29:34,00:29:35,That's no idea.
00:29:35,00:29:42,"If Wikipedia was printed out on paper, it would be about 1,900 volumes worth of Britannica."
00:29:42,00:29:43,Really?
00:29:43,00:29:44,That would be the most tedious.
00:29:44,00:29:49,"I mean encyclopedias are not exactly the greatest read of all time, are they?"
00:29:49,00:29:50,But imagine Wikipedia.
00:29:50,00:29:55,All those little pages for like high schools in the middle of America and stuff.
00:29:55,00:29:58,"Well, there was a project, like it was more of an art project, but this guy called Michael"
00:29:58,00:30:05,Manderberg in 2015 printed out some of it and kind of did a little math and worked how much
00:30:05,00:30:06,of a cost.
00:30:06,00:30:10,"It was called from A to Zap so that A was A-A-A-A-A-A-A exclamation mark, which is like the"
00:30:10,00:30:16,"first Wikipedia entry he could find in the beginning to Zap, which was Z-Z-Z-A-P exclamation"
00:30:16,00:30:19,"mark, which was a really random kid's CV show that I remember watching."
00:30:19,00:30:20,Really?
00:30:20,00:30:21,"Yeah, isn't that weird?"
00:30:21,00:30:22,I remember watching--
00:30:22,00:30:25,"Ah, yeah, that's classic."
00:30:25,00:30:30,My favourite encyclopedia is the four volume encyclopedia of lubricants and lubrication.
00:30:30,00:30:31,Nice.
00:30:31,00:30:32,Have you read it?
00:30:32,00:30:33,No.
00:30:33,00:30:38,"It's not you couldn't put it down, it's you couldn't pick it up."
00:30:38,00:30:41,"Okay, well, anything else?"
00:30:41,00:30:42,I'm happy to wrap.
00:30:42,00:30:43,Yep.
00:30:43,00:30:44,Let's hear that wrap.
00:30:44,00:30:45,"Hello, cool J."
00:30:45,00:30:53,"Okay, that's it."
00:30:53,00:30:54,That is all of our facts.
00:30:54,00:30:55,Thank you so much for listening.
