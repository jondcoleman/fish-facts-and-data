 Hi, Andy. Hi, everybody. Welcome to Drop As Align, the audience feedback segment of Club

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:47.260
 Fish, where we listen to the things that you said and we go through them. We've had some

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.540
 amazing correspondence this month. We should probably start with this one from Matthias

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:59.440
 Pansen book, who says, "We do say 'Austronaut' here in Austria, when referring to Franz W.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.880
 Book, the first and so far only Austrian astronaut who visited Mir, Australia needs to come up

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:05.880
 with their own name."

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:19.720
 "Oz" to an "Oz" like "Oz" I think Dan said that at the time and I slightly poo-pooed it maybe. I can't remember actually. Well, there we go. I've got an early quiz for you. Cool. From Peter Drake, whoever reads the

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:30.920
 email, it's always me Peter, can stump their colleagues with this one. "What product found in US kitchens bears a warning about something it doesn't contain?" Now, this is show related.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.820
 Oh, I think, is it going to be about goiters?

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.440
 This salt does not contain iodine.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.440
 Iodine.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.880
 You're both there. I think you both get the point for that. When you sent a huge photo of

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.480
 Morton salt, which has a label on it saying, "This salt does not supply iodide."

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.760
 That's too big, mate. That photo, we didn't need that A4 size.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:50.760
 I know, I've printed it.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:51.760
 That's a lot of printing.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:52.760
 Yeah, a lot of colour.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:59.120
 Can I just say, you failed to stump any of your colleagues there, apart from perhaps

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.280
 Dan, but I felt like it was on the tip of his tongue.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.480
 Would you think you would have got there, Dan?

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.480
 Yeah.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.480
 Do you think you would have got goit there?

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.480
 Goit there?

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.480
 Brilliant. It's worth it to lead to that joke.

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:12.480
 I think so, yeah.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.940
 In fact, we've had a lot of goiters discourse, so it's probably good we get into this nice

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:16.940
 and early.

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:17.940
 OK.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:24.160
 Ursula Kuker-Hogg writes, "I just wanted to mention some extra information. As a Swiss-born

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.800
 Austrian, can I point out that goiters did not stop at the Swiss border and were a problem

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.600
 in the whole of the Alpine regions. They were rare but not unknown when I grew up in Salzburg."

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:33.600
 Right.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:34.600
 That was in the early '70s.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:35.760
 Diseases don't know borders.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.920
 Well, you made a sound frontier. Is that what you were referring to?

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:40.920
 It was, yeah.

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:41.920
 It was, yeah.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.580
 James Peterson, right? He's 76 years old, which is relevant. He said, "My name is James.

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.020
 I do enjoy your show while currently in the state of Idaho." He does some hospital visits

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.020
 in Idaho.

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.020
 Yep.

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.220
 He says, "Your podcast about goiters caught my attention as this affliction was rampant

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.900
 in the USA in many regions up until the 1920s. Same kind of era as in one of some of the

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:02.900
 good--

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:03.900
 Yeah.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.100
 And he said, "I remember my mother, born in 1920, having a scar on her neck slash throat

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.940
 and I asked what happened and she said she had a goitre removed and she was raised in

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.440
 Montana and eastern Idaho and that was a lack of hiding."

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:13.440
 That's very interesting.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.440
 There you go.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.920
 And actually, I've just had a couple of flashbacks at times where I remember getting served by

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.740
 a waiter in one restaurant and a friend of a friend meeting them in another place.

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:23.740
 Is this America?

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:27.000
 And they both had these, no, in the UK, but I mean, they were more common all over the

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
 world. And they had these huge scars on their necks and what you think is something really

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.320
 cool has happened there.

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.320
 Yeah.

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.120
 Like someone almost murdered you.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.120
 Yeah.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.160
 Do you think there's a story?

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.160
 Shark attack.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.160
 Exactly.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.160
 Shark attack.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.900
 You're a spy who got into a bit of hot water in the Soviet Union or something.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.420
 Turns out, I bet they all just had goitres removed.

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:48.420
 Yeah.

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:49.420
 Right.

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.740
 My dad worked at my school where I went and I have a scar on my face and he told everyone

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.620
 that I was bitten by a shark.

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.820
 And so it was very regularly.

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.220
 I would say once or twice a week, people would come up to me and go, "Is it true you were

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.100
 bitten by a shark when you were a baby?"

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.020
 We could change sharkin as a result.

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:06.020
 Yeah.

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.100
 They changed the entire surname of my family.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.160
 No, your friends.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.160
 Just them.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.160
 Right.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.160
 I see.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.160
 Yeah.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.160
 Damn your dad for not committing.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.160
 Yeah.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.660
 What did you say?

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.800
 I said no because I was a teenager and quite embarrassed that people were even talking

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:21.800
 to me.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.360
 Was it in fact just a little facial goiter you had?

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.360
 Yes.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.360
 Exactly.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.840
 I had a sharpness of iodine in my cheek.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.320
 What circumstances were you under supposedly in the story that as a baby you were bitten

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.320
 by a shark?

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.320
 That's very bad parenting.

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.760
 It doesn't reflect well on your dad that a shark was able to get to you.

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:45.560
 As a teacher, someone looking after everyone's children.

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.240
 And I also, after we read that article, think that I might be iodine deficient.

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.300
 I was going to ask if you had the results of your test, but I wondered if you wanted

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:54.300
 that question asked.

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:55.300
 No, I haven't.

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:01.720
 There's some iodine deficiency in my family and I read about the symptoms and I feel like

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:06.220
 I've been running on about 70% for the last few years and I wonder if it's lack of iodine.

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.440
 It's completely unrelated to you becoming a parent and having no sleep for two years.

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.760
 I just feel tired all the time.

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:16.440
 I can hear this constant screaming and I think that's a symptom of iodine deficiency.

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:21.600
 I keep getting sick in September every year and I'm sure it's the iodine thing.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:22.600
 It's an urge to watch.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.080
 Thomas the Tank Engine and blowy.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.080
 It's really weird.

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.080
 Yeah.

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:30.480
 Well, Natasha Lake from Chicago writes, a very punchy start.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:31.480
 I don't know if you can see this.

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.480
 She writes on with the email just to begin.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:34.480
 Lovely.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:35.480
 What a great.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.660
 Iodine, thyroid, all in caps.

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:39.660
 It's cool.

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.580
 It's the style of like an early 20th century newspaper headline, isn't it?

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:43.580
 Yeah.

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:44.580
 Shot Korra War.

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:45.580
 Yeah.

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:46.580
 Yeah.

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.460
 And she says, please mentally pronounce iodine the American way.

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.100
 Iodine for full effect.

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:56.300
 And she just writes about the fact that there was a goiter belt across America.

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.300
 Did it include Idaho?

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.340
 It was the Midwest and Great Lakes.

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:01.340
 So you tell me.

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:02.340
 Not really.

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.500
 I guess so.

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.360
 Idaho is further west than the Great Lakes for sure.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:08.360
 Okay.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.360
 Michigan?

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.360
 That is on the Great Lakes.

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:11.520
 That's further east than Idaho.

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:12.520
 Michigan.

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:14.280
 Michigan apparently had a whole load of that.

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.680
 And there was a U.S. Endemic Goiter Committee.

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.840
 And these days there is a concern because there are lots of salts which are kosher, Himalayan,

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.240
 speciality, which are not generally iodized.

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.240
 Yeah.

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:26.760
 We'll see the salts aren't they?

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:27.760
 No.

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.760
 Around the world I think we might have mentioned.

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:30.760
 Yeah.

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:32.240
 It's only the cheap shit salt.

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.260
 So here ends the goiter section of the show.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:35.460
 We should do this every week.

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:36.460
 Yeah.

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:37.460
 Great section.

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:38.460
 Goiter pod.

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:40.540
 Here's a good email subject line.

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:41.540
 Can you smell my...

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:42.540
 Oh.

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:43.540
 Yeah.

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:44.540
 From Sophie Unwind.

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:45.540
 Got it.

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:46.540
 Can you smell my ass?

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:47.540
 Discourse continues.

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:48.540
 Oh, God.

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:49.540
 And this is great.

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:53.900
 She's a participant in a sport which she thinks has the most ass smelling.

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:54.900
 Ah.

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:55.900
 Oh.

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:56.900
 Okay.

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:57.900
 Can we guess what it is?

00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:58.900
 I'd love you to guess.

00:06:58.900 --> 00:06:59.900
 I'm thinking...

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:00.900
 A sport.

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:03.520
 Is that in the Olympics?

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:04.520
 Yeah.

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:05.520
 It's got to be this year.

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.920
 I think it's been approved with skateboarding.

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:12.400
 I think there is a new spot in the Olympics which is sport climbing.

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.920
 So maybe if you're climbing behind someone...

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:15.920
 Very good.

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:16.920
 Oh.

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:19.200
 How about the sport of building a pyramid?

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.900
 You know the kids that...

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:21.900
 Oh.

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:22.900
 Do you know what I'm talking about?

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:23.900
 Human pyramid.

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:24.900
 Human pyramid.

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:25.900
 Yeah.

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:26.900
 Yeah.

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:27.900
 Yeah.

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:30.900
 But Egypt is very strong in the pyramid.

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:34.160
 Egypt takes it again.

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:37.800
 And it's brilliant because the podium afterwards, you have to build your own podium for the

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:38.800
 end of the year.

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:39.800
 Yeah.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.800
 But you could get hundreds of thousands of people on each step of the pyramid.

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:44.960
 You go all the way to the top.

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:45.960
 So none of those things.

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:46.960
 No.

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:49.460
 It's not rugby or NFL where you're in a scrum and you use to meet those asses.

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:50.460
 No.

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:51.460
 I mean, I thought of rugby, but no.

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:52.460
 This is great.

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:53.460
 I'll tell you.

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:54.460
 She writes.

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:56.300
 Because there was actually a rugby player who put his finger up someone's bum.

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:57.300
 Oh, yeah.

00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:59.160
 But lots of bums.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:00.160
 The same finger?

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.640
 I think it was a thumb up the bum.

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:03.640
 Was it?

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:04.640
 I'm not sure.

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:08.260
 But it was multiple people reported saying he keeps putting his fingers up us.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:12.500
 But is it your, there would be people on his team?

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:13.500
 No.

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:14.500
 On the opposition.

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:17.500
 Well, how long are his arms?

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:22.660
 If you're in a scrum with someone and you're in the second row, you can get to the bums

00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:23.660
 of the people in the front row.

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:24.660
 There's a lot of...

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:25.660
 They are on your team.

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:28.020
 They're falling to the ground and trying to grab the ball.

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:30.580
 In a ruck rather than a scrum.

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:31.580
 What's a ruck again?

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:35.100
 Like Dan says, it's just everyone sort of on the ground and the balls in there and

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:36.100
 you're trying to get the ball out.

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:43.220
 It feels like this guy is fulfilling other, that feels like quite a lot of having to go

00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:46.580
 to rather than in a scrum where you could just like pop a finger or a thumb in there.

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:48.780
 You were just saying it was impossible.

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:50.780
 I'm saying it's possible to get the other team.

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:51.780
 Yeah.

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:53.780
 Well, you don't want to put your finger up your own team's arms.

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:55.780
 I'm saying that's what I'm saying.

00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:57.980
 Some people like having a finger up their ass.

00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:00.660
 Would it motivate you in a scrum?

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:01.660
 Come on, mate.

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:02.660
 Pull my finger out.

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:03.660
 Get to action.

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:04.660
 Very good.

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:08.440
 So it's not Rugga.

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:12.780
 Sophie writes, it's in the first four words very well, she writes, "I'm a paricyclist."

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:13.780
 Ah.

00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:14.780
 So that's tandem.

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:15.780
 Interesting, yeah.

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:18.540
 I think tandem may be the most apt use of the line.

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:22.380
 The ass you're close to belongs to your teammate, so it doesn't work as an insult, but I can't

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:25.580
 think of another sport that has you quite so close to someone else's ass.

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:26.580
 I agree.

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:28.940
 I've attached a picture of myself racing, so you can see what I mean.

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:30.820
 I am the one smelling the ass.

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:31.820
 Let's see.

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:32.820
 And here she is.

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:33.820
 Oh.

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:34.820
 Oh, yeah.

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:35.820
 The ass knows it.

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:36.820
 Oh, yeah.

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:37.820
 So she really is very, very close to it.

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:42.100
 I just feel like if normal tandems were like that, they might not sell quite as many.

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:43.100
 No, it's true.

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:44.100
 It's true.

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:46.700
 You might not see them all over the streets like you do today.

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:47.700
 Jason Kenney.

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:49.900
 Oh, thank you, Sophie.

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:56.060
 And his wife, Laura Kenney, who are two of the greatest Olympians in British history

00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:57.660
 of cyclists.

00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:58.660
 They have a tandem.

00:09:58.660 --> 00:09:59.660
 That's great.

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:02.980
 They must go a million miles an hour.

00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:04.140
 That's amazing.

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:06.340
 The pantomime horse.

00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:07.340
 That would be a very good one.

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:09.140
 And also, you're being closed.

00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:10.140
 Absolutely.

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:11.140
 You've got to be careful there.

00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:14.580
 So the pantomime horse, Grand National.

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:22.340
 Noah Bacon writes, "Yes, thank you, Noah."

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:27.940
 As a resident of Rockstow, I wanted to weigh in on the Seymour Cox discussion.

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:28.940
 Oh, I don't remember.

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:29.940
 Yeah.

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:30.940
 It was when Leung was here.

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:34.820
 And it was referring to an MP called Seymour Cox.

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:35.820
 Great.

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:36.820
 Yeah.

00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:39.620
 In 1938, there was some debate over whether Lord Byron was actually buried in his family's

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:43.060
 vault in Hucknell, and a team of people went to exhume his body.

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:47.220
 Leung, that team, was the unfortunately named MP of neighbouring constituency Rockstow,

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:48.220
 Seymour Cox.

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:51.940
 Ironically, Seymour Cox and the rest of the group were shocked at the size of Byron's

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:52.940
 cock.

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:53.940
 You know what?

00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:54.940
 We've said that.

00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:55.940
 Like one of the first episodes.

00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:56.940
 I've completely forgotten it.

00:10:56.940 --> 00:11:00.460
 No, it was when we're, I'm pretty sure, on stage at Soho Theatre.

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:01.460
 Yeah.

00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:02.460
 You mentioned it was.

00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:03.460
 I remember James telling this fact.

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:04.460
 And you made the Seymour Cox, couldn't you?

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:05.460
 Yeah.

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:06.460
 I've completely forgot about it.

00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:07.460
 There we go.

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:08.460
 Yeah.

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:09.460
 I remember that, too.

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:10.460
 Yeah.

00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:12.460
 I think it was one of our first ever shows at the Soho Theatre, for sure.

00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:13.460
 Yeah.

00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:14.460
 Yeah.

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:15.460
 Oh, there we go.

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:16.460
 Nice to be reminded.

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:17.460
 Thank you, Noah.

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:18.460
 Did we know if they were shocked that it was too big or too small?

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:22.060
 Well, it was a hundred years after he died, so I really think you'd be shocked if there

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:23.580
 was anything there at all.

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:28.060
 Byron, you'd expect to have a huge member, so I think something very small would be

00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:30.140
 more shocking than something very big.

00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:32.140
 But a hundred years later, you just, there's.

00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:33.140
 There's that just gaping.

00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:34.140
 It does go, doesn't it?

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:35.140
 Yeah.

00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:36.140
 No bone or anything.

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:37.140
 No.

00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:38.140
 Yeah, that hole.

00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:39.140
 Yeah.

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:44.300
 There's a little molepog in his head up where the penis should have been or a naked mole

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:45.300
 rat.

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:46.300
 That would be.

00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:47.300
 Oh.

00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:50.460
 Eric DeVos writes, "Just thought you might like to know the oldest sitting member of

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:54.980
 the Dutch Eester Kammer," sorry for mispronouncing that, "Our equivalent of the House of Lords

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:57.820
 is resigning, and his name is Tiny Cox."

00:11:57.820 --> 00:11:59.300
 No, that's great.

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:01.500
 Thank you, Eric.

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:04.180
 It's called Tiny.

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:05.180
 Yeah.

00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:06.180
 Yeah.

00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:07.180
 Come on.

00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:08.180
 That joke is a sitting Dutch.

00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:09.180
 Oh, good grief.

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:10.180
 Oh.

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:11.900
 We're just doing an episode on dad jokes.

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:13.900
 I'm just catching up.

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:14.900
 Absolutely.

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:20.020
 Oh, I think we all smelt your ass there.

00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:25.500
 Tom Coombs writes, "Hello from Newfoundland," Newfoundland, Newfoundland, one of those

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:26.500
 would be.

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:27.500
 Pick one, Tom.

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:31.100
 No, I can never, I always say it wrong.

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:32.220
 I always say it wrong.

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:33.220
 Newfoundland.

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:34.220
 Newfoundland.

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:35.220
 Sorry.

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:38.660
 I mean, you've slowly been taking up an item of shirt clothing.

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:43.580
 Don, do you remember this is the strip podcast?

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:48.340
 Every time you say a terrible joke, you have to take an item of clothing on.

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:50.420
 Oh, dear.

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:51.420
 It's heating up in here, all right?

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:52.420
 Yeah.

00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:53.420
 Melissa's going to sense it.

00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:54.420
 I can sense it.

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:55.420
 All these cocks.

00:12:55.420 --> 00:13:02.580
 Tom Coombs writes, "Hello from there, I recently drove across Canada from coast to coast.

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:06.460
 I stayed at a motel in the town of Shriver, Ontario."

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:07.460
 Oh, cool.

00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:11.700
 "I really wanted to send a postcard from there to you with an interesting fact about the

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:12.700
 town.

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:15.700
 Unfortunately, I found neither an interesting fact nor a postcard."

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:20.420
 Why does that somehow feel like a massive slam on the news?

00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:21.420
 I don't know.

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:22.420
 It does.

00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:23.420
 It does.

00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:24.420
 So, I said you this email with no facts.

00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:25.420
 So, anyway.

00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:26.420
 That's cool.

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:28.220
 Actually, I didn't know there was a place called Shriver, Ontario.

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:29.220
 No?

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:30.220
 There you go.

00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:31.220
 We should do a gig there.

00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:32.220
 Yeah.

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:33.860
 I don't know who's named after her.

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:35.780
 This is actually a proper correction.

00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:38.420
 So something we, I think, slightly flubbed on.

00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:39.420
 Charlotte Van Uweek.

00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:43.020
 There's a lot of people from the Low Countries, right, and then this week.

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:47.260
 Well, you think she is, but the rest of it, no, no, no.

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:53.420
 Well, she's from Australia, and she said in episode, very good, very good.

00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:55.660
 Dan, this is the proper serious bit of the show.

00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:56.660
 Sorry.

00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:57.660
 I'm afraid we're going to need to tap in.

00:13:57.660 --> 00:13:58.660
 No.

00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:01.420
 She says, "In episode 514, you stated that Australia is the second largest user of bottled

00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:02.420
 water.

00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:06.700
 This fact isn't incorrect as such, but you missed out a lot of crucial context.

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:10.260
 You speculated that the reason for so many plastic bottled water sales must be because

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:13.380
 everyone is so busy frolicking on the beach."

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:14.660
 And actually, it's not that.

00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:18.260
 And she goes on to say, "The main reason there is so much bottled water sold is multiple

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:23.620
 country towns have literally run out of water due to climate change-related severe droughts,

00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:26.820
 and there are also floods which can contaminate water, which means you need to have lots of

00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:27.820
 bottled water as well."

00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:34.740
 So our amusing beach-based barbecue scenario was definitely, because I don't think we knew.

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:35.740
 We just needed the stat.

00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:36.740
 No.

00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:37.740
 No, that's very interesting.

00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:41.660
 Brings the mood down, certainly, of that initial fact, but it is very interesting.

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:42.660
 There we go.

00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:43.660
 And sorry for slandering the Aussies.

00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:44.660
 Yeah.

00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:45.660
 It's actually a very nice email.

00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:46.660
 She just sort of says, "That's why."

00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:47.660
 Yeah, that's why.

00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:48.660
 It sounds very nice.

00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:52.940
 I've read out the bit we most need to deal.

00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:55.780
 I haven't included the bit where she says, "I like listening to the show."

00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:56.780
 Yeah.

00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:57.780
 That's very nice.

00:14:57.780 --> 00:15:03.660
 Can I just say also, I stand by all previous slandering of the Aussies, just on this particular

00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:04.660
 point, fine.

00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:05.660
 Okay.

00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:06.660
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:08.660
 I don't think we're being asked to correct anything else.

00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:09.660
 Okay.

00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:11.660
 Is that why I'm on this show?

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:14.660
 Just to be safe, one of my friends is an Australian.

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:15.660
 I can say it.

00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:19.060
 I was like, "This show is a whole slandering of the Australians."

00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:22.140
 I'm like, "Let's find the most stupid Australian we can."

00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:24.140
 Oh, my God.

00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:33.340
 Can't find anyone stupid enough, so I got you to pretend to be an Aussie 12 years ago.

00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:36.580
 So, yeah, apologies, hold your hands up to that.

00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:40.820
 I think that's a fair cop, a fair cop.

00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:44.500
 Alan Wood writes, "Just another arm actually."

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:46.100
 This is about Bethany England.

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:47.100
 Oh, yes.

00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:49.820
 I know it's a Jengar apology, but it's not.

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:53.660
 So, another footballer who's named after the country they represented.

00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:54.660
 Yes.

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:56.020
 She was the one we mentioned.

00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:57.020
 Yeah.

00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:58.020
 Simon Ivory Coast.

00:15:58.020 --> 00:15:59.020
 That's right.

00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:02.580
 And then someone written and said, "Steve and Ireland play for Ireland."

00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:03.580
 Yeah.

00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:05.140
 Who, fair enough, I should have known him.

00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:08.020
 Well, this is a Jengar, I'm actually from Alan.

00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:11.740
 Bethany England hasn't played for a country that's shared her name because England isn't

00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:16.780
 a country, England isn't recognised as a country by the United Nations and can be referred

00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:18.980
 to as a home nation during international events.

00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:19.980
 Interesting.

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:20.980
 Yeah, that's a good point.

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:24.540
 I'm going to try and exhibit this level of, he actually writes, "Pendantry."

00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:26.900
 I'm sorry to grass you up here, Alan.

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:27.900
 I'm sorry.

00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:30.660
 Maybe he's just wearing a big necklace when you write.

00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:34.740
 I'm sorry, but if you come at us with an "I'm actually," I'm going to run over this every

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:36.140
 single word, scrupulous.

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:38.420
 Well, these guys read pen out.

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:39.420
 Absolutely.

00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:41.100
 It's the worst word to miss, Belle, isn't it?

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:43.420
 I always wonder if he's done that deliberately.

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:44.420
 Yeah.

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:50.380
 I've never heard that before because I did, up until a second ago, think it was a country.

00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:52.100
 I think it is a country in some respects.

00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:53.580
 It depends how you define country.

00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:59.180
 That's why on Pointless, every time they have to define country as a member of the United

00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:00.180
 Nations.

00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:01.180
 Because it's the UK.

00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:02.180
 Yeah, yeah.

00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:04.980
 And England was a country and then it merged with Scotland and Wales.

00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:09.820
 But it is a country in a sporting sense by most definitions, obviously, because if we

00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:13.860
 said the British football team, then the Scots, they'd stop listening.

00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:18.940
 I feel like constitutionally in the UK, we talk about the four countries of the United

00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:19.940
 Kingdom.

00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:20.940
 Yes.

00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:21.940
 OK.

00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:22.940
 Oh, Wales, yeah.

00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:23.940
 Oh, my God, Anna.

00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:24.940
 Come on, come on.

00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:31.500
 Anna, this show is an attempt to clear the inbox.

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:32.500
 Wow.

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:33.420
 Bethany, England delivers again.

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:34.420
 She'll be back.

00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:43.300
 I feel like Bethany, England is a nickname for Anna, you know, so her identity.

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:45.460
 Oh, goodness me.

00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:47.420
 There's maybe the best pedantic email we've had this week.

00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:53.020
 This is from someone with a great name, Cesar Almeida from Brazil, from Brasilia.

00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:58.660
 Cesar writes, "As a Brazilian living in Brazil," sorry, I'll cover that, "I've just in the

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:03.100
 last couple of weeks discovered QI and then last week fishing around for something to

00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:06.940
 listen to during an impending drive across the country, I found fish.

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:09.380
 On episode 479, you refer to the Aldi Equator."

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:10.380
 Oh, yeah.

00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:11.380
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:12.380
 The shop Aldi.

00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:16.020
 The two brothers, they divided all the branches of Aldi between north and south.

00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:18.580
 Anyway, you refer to the Aldi Equator.

00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:24.620
 But it occurred to me that since the Equator, though imaginary, is defined by its equidistance

00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:28.780
 from the poles and is therefore not subject to convention, the best metaphor for the Aldi

00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:34.940
 Brothers Agreement would surely be the Torcedes Treaty of 1494 between Spain and Portugal.

00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:37.220
 Yeah, that's fair.

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:39.300
 I think that's a completely fair cop.

00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:41.580
 Well, that's what created Brazil, right?

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:45.940
 I think because they just decided all the bits on this side are going to belong to Spain,

00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:49.420
 all the bits on this side are going to belong to Portugal, and Brazil, obviously, is the

00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:51.980
 only Portuguese-speaking country in South America.

00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:52.980
 Right.

00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:53.980
 Well, there we go.

00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:55.500
 That's close to this person's heart.

00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:56.660
 That's chapter and verse.

00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:57.820
 I mean, great.

00:18:57.820 --> 00:18:58.820
 Wonderful.

00:18:58.820 --> 00:18:59.820
 Great point.

00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:00.820
 Yeah.

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:04.020
 I think it's only a lack of intimate familiarity with the Torcedes Treaty of 1494 that meant

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:05.940
 I, you know, or we mentioned that.

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:08.180
 I'm just kicking myself that I didn't think of that.

00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:09.180
 Yeah.

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:10.180
 Do you want to hear a bung-hole email?

00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:11.180
 Oh, yes, please.

00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:12.180
 Yeah, always.

00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:15.540
 Ben from Connecticut writes, "Your recent episode mentioned lots

00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:18.900
 of bung things like bung holes and the like, but also mentioned baseball.

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:22.140
 It so happens there is a minor league team that was briefly called the Beer City Bung

00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:23.140
 Hammers."

00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:24.140
 Beer City.

00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:33.460
 What a great, is that a nickname for an actual, because there's no beer city in America, is

00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:34.460
 there?

00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:35.460
 Right.

00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:38.820
 Well, it was a brief renaming of the West Michigan White Caps, a low-level affiliate

00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:39.980
 of the Detroit Tigers.

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:40.980
 I'm in so deep.

00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:42.580
 I'm in so deep in my head.

00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:45.260
 So they changed their name for a few games for promotional reasons.

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:46.420
 There we go.

00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:47.420
 That's great, though.

00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:48.420
 Yeah.

00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:49.420
 Bung Hammers.

00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:52.300
 And then Ben goes on to write, "I don't know if you guys can confirm this, you supporters.

00:19:52.300 --> 00:20:00.780
 Other good, real, full-time team names include the sod poodles, the trash pandas, rumble ponies,

00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:03.660
 jumbo shrimp, sock puppets, and disco turkeys."

00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:10.740
 That's a stunning, a baseball-panda-related fact.

00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:18.960
 In Bhutan, the baseball teams are all named after animals that live in Bhutan.

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:24.060
 And in Timpu, their capital, their team is called the Timpu Red Pandas.

00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:29.380
 And what that means is, this is a really cool thing they do, any money that each team gets

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:34.860
 goes into conservation for whichever team is named after themselves, whichever animal.

00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:35.860
 That's awesome.

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:36.860
 Yeah.

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:37.860
 I didn't say that very well.

00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:42.180
 Basically, the red panda conservation gets all the money from the Timpu Red Pandas.

00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:43.180
 Right.

00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:44.180
 That's lovely.

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:45.180
 That's awesome.

00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:46.180
 Yeah.

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:47.180
 Is there a Yeti team?

00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:48.180
 Because there is a Yeti party, isn't there?

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:49.180
 According to the Bhutanese.

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:50.180
 Yeah.

00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:51.180
 There's a...

00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:52.180
 I don't believe...

00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:54.740
 To be honest, I didn't read through all the names, but I didn't see a Yeti name.

00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:55.740
 Okay.

00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:56.740
 Yeah.

00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:57.740
 No one has.

00:20:57.740 --> 00:21:01.220
 And we did have an email about that, actually.

00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:04.820
 It was a fact email, so I didn't put it in this document, but it was about how Yeti sightings

00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:08.060
 go up proportionally to the number of, I think it was, black bears in an area.

00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:12.660
 Like, if there are more black bears, you'll get a certain amount of Yeti sightings.

00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:14.980
 Because they prey on black bears.

00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:15.980
 That's right.

00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:16.980
 That's their name.

00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:22.060
 Wait, do you not include fact emails in this bit of the show?

00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:23.060
 God no.

00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:24.940
 No, because we have a new outlet for those.

00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:25.940
 Yeah, okay.

00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:26.940
 Yeah.

00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:28.820
 A new sleuths, a new porthole has opened.

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:30.940
 It's content free.

00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:32.260
 Yeah.

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:33.700
 We can't have content in this show.

00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:34.700
 No.

00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:36.980
 This is the light relief.

00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:37.980
 Yeah.

00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:38.980
 A nice...

00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:40.700
 Oh, here's one.

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:41.700
 This is a...

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:42.700
 I'm afraid this is quite a serious one.

00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:43.700
 Okay.

00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:44.700
 It's from Kevin Ryan.

00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:45.700
 I'm just going to read the whole thing, all right?

00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:46.700
 Yeah.

00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:48.980
 I'm writing to say how shocked and disappointed I was to hear Anna telling that Bunga Bunga

00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:51.060
 joke during a recent episode.

00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:53.700
 I'm sure many other listeners felt the same.

00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:58.020
 The punchline should have been that the third captor, having seen the awful state the first

00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:03.420
 two were in after Bunga Bunga, asks for death instead, to which the captor cries out, "Death

00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:04.420
 by Bunga Bunga."

00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:05.420
 Yeah.

00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:06.420
 No, that's an alternative.

00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:07.420
 Sure.

00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:09.420
 I think both work fine.

00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:11.140
 That's the version I know as well.

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:12.420
 It's the version I know too.

00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:13.420
 They're both funny.

00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:14.420
 I'm afraid the game...

00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:15.420
 Kevin Ryan doesn't know.

00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:16.420
 Is that Anna knows comedy.

00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:17.420
 Is that right?

00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:25.340
 But you were saying the version that was Colonel Gaddafi and Mussolini's favourite joke, right?

00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:26.340
 Oh, yeah.

00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:27.340
 Yes.

00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:28.340
 So that was...

00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:29.340
 So I think I'm on the right side of this one, guys.

00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:30.940
 You're on the right side of history.

00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:31.940
 Yeah.

00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:32.940
 Yeah.

00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:33.940
 No, that's fair.

00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:34.940
 Yeah.

00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:35.940
 This is a very cool email.

00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:36.940
 It's from a few episodes ago.

00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:39.620
 Dan, you were talking about John Williams and he conducted the E.T. school.

00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:40.620
 That's right.

00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:41.620
 Yeah.

00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:44.460
 So this is from Tiffany Chang from Melbourne.

00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:48.800
 She's a musician and she plays and she does film schools sometimes.

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:53.100
 And it's just about how they play the soundtrack with the film on the screen behind them.

00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:54.100
 Yeah.

00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:55.100
 Very cool.

00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:56.100
 Yeah.

00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:57.100
 I love it.

00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:58.420
 And they also have a click track in their ear.

00:22:58.420 --> 00:22:59.420
 Like a metronome.

00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:00.420
 Yeah.

00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:01.420
 Exactly.

00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:02.420
 Yeah, yeah.

00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:03.420
 I love this bit of her email.

00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:04.420
 Yeah.

00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:05.860
 I love the movie on the screen in front of them with the beats flashing up across the

00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:09.620
 screen like in Guitar Hero.

00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:13.300
 And some of the conductors we've had during the Star Wars series had their own special

00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:15.500
 battons that they used for a bit of the performance.

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:20.780
 One had a mini lightsaber that properly lit up and another had a wand for the Harry Potter

00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:21.780
 movies.

00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:22.780
 Cool.

00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:23.780
 Yeah.

00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:24.780
 Wow.

00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:25.780
 Not a real lightsaber though.

00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:27.780
 Didn't do the musicians any harm, did it?

00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:28.780
 No.

00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:31.780
 I mean, the whole brass section was just run through.

00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:34.940
 Left with the smoking on the head.

00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:37.220
 And we talk about conductors calling out the names of the instruments.

00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:38.220
 Yeah, we did.

00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:39.220
 Yeah.

00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:42.820
 So Tiffany writes, "As for conductors shouting instruments at us, that does happen.

00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:46.500
 When I first started playing in youth orchestras, when I was seven or so, I was reduced to

00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:48.940
 tears thinking I was being yelled at personally."

00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:52.140
 Turns out he wasn't yelling Tiffany, he was yelling at the timpani.

00:23:52.140 --> 00:24:00.420
 And we've done that fact about, you know, in Star Wars, there's the cantina where there's

00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:02.920
 like a jazz band playing.

00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:04.660
 What that style of music is called?

00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:06.140
 We've never done it, but I know it.

00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:07.300
 Yeah, it's called jizz.

00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:08.300
 No.

00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:09.300
 The name jizz.

00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:10.300
 Wow.

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:11.300
 Is that invented?

00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:12.300
 The word was invented by Star Wars.

00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:16.380
 I think George Lucas might have come up with it or someone in the responsible for naming

00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:17.380
 in the universe.

00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:18.380
 Oh, that's great.

00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:22.740
 There's an email here, "Headlined possible vindication for Andy," which I'm afraid we've

00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:23.740
 got to read.

00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:24.740
 No, we can't.

00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:25.740
 We can't.

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:30.140
 "Lynse Vicnes writes, "On at least two occasions, the other three have made fun of you for

00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:34.540
 the way you pronounce," oh god.

00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:35.540
 Frontier.

00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:37.220
 That's how you pronounce it.

00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:38.220
 That's how you pronounce it.

00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:39.220
 Yeah.

00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:40.220
 And Houston.

00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:41.220
 Yes.

00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:42.220
 Houston.

00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:43.220
 That's how you say it.

00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:44.220
 Houston is how I say it.

00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:45.220
 We say Houston and frontier.

00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:46.720
 And what do I say?

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:47.720
 Houston and frontier.

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:48.720
 Houston and frontier.

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:49.720
 Got it.

00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:50.720
 Okay.

00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:51.720
 I may be able to get you off the hook.

00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:52.720
 Off the hook.

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:57.900
 I've just been rewatching a documentary series called Coast.

00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:01.420
 One of the hosts is Scottish, brackets Neil Oliver.

00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:07.300
 And in the span of two episodes, he said those words and he pronounces them like you do.

00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:10.340
 He also pronounces them in several episodes after that, so they weren't just a fluke.

00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:12.220
 I seem to remember your part, Scottish.

00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:13.760
 Maybe you're not pronouncing them wrong.

00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:15.580
 Maybe you're pronouncing them Scottish.

00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:16.880
 So that's great.

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:20.460
 I'm glad to be vindicated as maybe just a bit Scottish.

00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:21.740
 But Neil Oliver is not.

00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:23.440
 I don't actually know who Neil Oliver is.

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:24.860
 He doesn't just host Coast anymore.

00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:26.480
 He's now one of the main hosts on GB News.

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:27.480
 Oh, really?

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:30.160
 And he's very much in the sort of vaccines make you ill.

00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:31.160
 Oh, really?

00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:33.880
 But he was such a normal, great host on Coast.

00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:34.880
 Back in the day.

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:35.880
 Absolutely.

00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:36.880
 It came out of nowhere.

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:39.040
 It was a sort of pandemic out of nowhere moment.

00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:40.040
 Yeah.

00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:43.760
 Oh, a health note for Dan, Isabella Wickstead writes, "I listened to your podcast before

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:44.920
 going to sleep.

00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:48.160
 I heard Dan saying that his canines have disappeared in recent years."

00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:49.160
 Yeah.

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:50.160
 Did you say that?

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:51.160
 No.

00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:52.160
 We used to have them.

00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:53.160
 You don't have them now?

00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:59.500
 It's possible they were shaved off while I was having mouth stuff done to me as a kid.

00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:00.500
 I don't like mouth stuff.

00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:02.560
 I had a really experimental dentist.

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:05.020
 He was a giant German guy who did things to my face.

00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:06.020
 Was it sorry?

00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:08.540
 He said they're great.

00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:09.540
 He was huge.

00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:11.300
 George Eliot level hand size.

00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:12.300
 He was...

00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:13.300
 Sorry, what?

00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:14.300
 Yeah.

00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:15.300
 What are you talking about?

00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:16.300
 What are you talking about?

00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:19.920
 I had something that I, as far as I know, no one else ever has had before.

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:22.500
 Because this guy was experimenting in Hong Kong.

00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:23.500
 He...

00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:24.500
 What did he do?

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:25.500
 So I had an overbite in my...

00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:26.500
 So my top...

00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:27.500
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:28.500
 An overbite.

00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:32.260
 Instead of rectifying it by just putting braces on, he put a piston system of metal inside

00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:36.260
 my mouth, pulled my bottom jaw forward like that.

00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:37.260
 So I had...

00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:38.620
 So for the listener, my jaw is way in front of my...

00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:39.620
 So he gave you an underbite.

00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:45.000
 A huge underbite, which I had to keep for nine months, held by these pistons, and these

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:50.940
 pistons would go...if I open my mouth too wide, the pistons could come out, but most likely

00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:57.060
 they would lock, and I would be stuck dribbling for about 20 minutes trying to get out.

00:26:57.060 --> 00:27:02.860
 So it was a really weird system, and in that period, if possible, he shaved my teeth.

00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:04.340
 Are you Frankenstein?

00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:06.940
 I think he was, the monster.

00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:08.820
 That's so weird.

00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:09.820
 Yeah, it was really odd.

00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:11.420
 I'm really surprised I've never heard that.

00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:13.180
 We've known each other for more than 20 years.

00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:14.180
 Yeah, I'm surprised.

00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:15.180
 I've never heard that.

00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:18.440
 Because the guy who did the theme tune for our show, our friend Ash Gardner, he's been

00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:19.440
 on the show and so on.

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:22.360
 He went to the same guy as well, and Ash used to have a thing where he kept sucking his

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:23.920
 thumb as he was getting older.

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:25.320
 So what the guy put in was...

00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:30.280
 Because he gave him revolving thumbs, special steam canisters.

00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:32.760
 It sounds so steam punk, isn't it?

00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:33.760
 Yeah, exactly.

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:38.240
 So what he put in was a metal contraption in the top of his mouth that had a spike.

00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:39.240
 What?

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:40.240
 What?

00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:42.640
 So every time Ash sucked his thumb, it would push the metal spike into him.

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:43.640
 No, stop it.

00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:44.640
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:46.660
 This is honestly what happened to us as kids in Hong Kong.

00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:48.140
 This guy needs his license taking away.

00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:49.140
 Is he still operating?

00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:50.140
 Was this guy...

00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:51.140
 Was he a sort of...

00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:52.140
 Sadist?

00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:53.140
 What was he?

00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:54.140
 I don't know.

00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:55.140
 My parents sent him to me.

00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:56.140
 Have you ever seen the human centipede?

00:27:56.140 --> 00:27:57.140
 No.

00:27:57.140 --> 00:28:00.820
 Because he did have work afterwards.

00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:01.820
 Yeah.

00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:02.820
 Tan.

00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:03.820
 Yeah.

00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:04.820
 That's really traumatising.

00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:07.660
 I would not have spoken to my parents for a few years after they made me do that.

00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:10.540
 Imagine going to school with an underbite that was connected by pistons.

00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:16.000
 I think once that's happened to you, speaking to anyone is not really an issue for quite

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.000
 a few years.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:21.800
 Is this why your mouth has that chimney?

00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:22.800
 That is really...

00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:23.800
 It was really odd.

00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:24.800
 Yeah.

00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:27.720
 I feel like we should mention Isabel's email, which...

00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:28.720
 Oh, yeah.

00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:29.720
 Sorry.

00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:30.720
 Sorry.

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:32.120
 I heard Dan saying his canons have disappeared in recent years.

00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:33.120
 Yeah.

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:35.440
 Isabel, we've already answered a lot of your questions here.

00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:37.240
 I made a note to email myself about it.

00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:38.880
 "Dan, you should do a sleep study.

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:43.380
 I found out a couple of months ago at the dentist," - don't bring that up, Isabel - "that

00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:48.020
 if you have unexpectedly straight teeth along the bottom, you may be grinding them in your

00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:49.380
 sleep due to sleep apnea.

00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:50.380
 Get it checked."

00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:52.660
 Well, it turns out, Dan, you don't need to do that because your teeth were shaved by

00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:53.660
 a German giant.

00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:54.660
 Oh, great.

00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:55.660
 Bye.

00:28:55.660 --> 00:29:09.100
 You'll be hearing from my liars soon.

00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:10.100
 Oh.

00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:11.100
 Yes.

00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:18.060
 That's some callback to last time when we said that Anna and I had hated it.

00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:20.460
 Someone sent through a list of alternatives for me.

00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:21.460
 No, Orion Slater.

00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:22.460
 Amazing name.

00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:23.460
 Sent through a list of...

00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:24.460
 Orion.

00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:25.460
 Orion.

00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:26.460
 Orion.

00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:27.460
 Wow.

00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:28.460
 Like of belt fame.

00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:29.460
 Yeah.

00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:30.460
 Yeah.

00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:31.460
 Nice.

00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:32.460
 A steely stare at the other three.

00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:33.460
 A special gong.

00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:37.700
 An improvised limerick directly relevant to matters discussed in the episode.

00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:42.520
 Jesus, we don't have to wait 25 minutes for you to start with that.

00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:45.260
 Just don't say anything at even more abruptly end.

00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:46.260
 Yes.

00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:47.260
 I'll interrupt you guys.

00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:48.260
 No.

00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:49.260
 I'll say pip pip.

00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:50.260
 No.

00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:51.260
 Thanks, everybody.

00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:52.260
