 Bloop, bloop, bloop, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, baby, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,820
 Hi, Andy. Hi, everybody. Welcome to Drop As Align, the audience feedback segment of Club

3
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:47,260
 Fish, where we listen to the things that you said and we go through them. We've had some

4
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:52,540
 amazing correspondence this month. We should probably start with this one from Matthias

5
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:59,440
 Pansen book, who says, "We do say 'Austronaut' here in Austria, when referring to Franz W.

6
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,880
 Book, the first and so far only Austrian astronaut who visited Mir, Australia needs to come up

7
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:05,880
 with their own name."

8
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:19,720
 "Oz" to an "Oz" like "Oz" I think Dan said that at the time and I slightly poo-pooed it maybe. I can't remember actually. Well, there we go. I've got an early quiz for you. Cool. From Peter Drake, whoever reads the

9
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:30,920
 email, it's always me Peter, can stump their colleagues with this one. "What product found in US kitchens bears a warning about something it doesn't contain?" Now, this is show related.

10
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:35,820
 Oh, I think, is it going to be about goiters?

11
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,440
 This salt does not contain iodine.

12
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,440
 Iodine.

13
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,880
 You're both there. I think you both get the point for that. When you sent a huge photo of

14
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:46,480
 Morton salt, which has a label on it saying, "This salt does not supply iodide."

15
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,760
 That's too big, mate. That photo, we didn't need that A4 size.

16
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,760
 I know, I've printed it.

17
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,760
 That's a lot of printing.

18
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,760
 Yeah, a lot of colour.

19
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:59,120
 Can I just say, you failed to stump any of your colleagues there, apart from perhaps

20
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,280
 Dan, but I felt like it was on the tip of his tongue.

21
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,480
 Would you think you would have got there, Dan?

22
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,480
 Yeah.

23
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,480
 Do you think you would have got goit there?

24
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,480
 Goit there?

25
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,480
 Brilliant. It's worth it to lead to that joke.

26
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,480
 I think so, yeah.

27
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,940
 In fact, we've had a lot of goiters discourse, so it's probably good we get into this nice

28
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:16,940
 and early.

29
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:17,940
 OK.

30
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:24,160
 Ursula Kuker-Hogg writes, "I just wanted to mention some extra information. As a Swiss-born

31
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,800
 Austrian, can I point out that goiters did not stop at the Swiss border and were a problem

32
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:32,600
 in the whole of the Alpine regions. They were rare but not unknown when I grew up in Salzburg."

33
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,600
 Right.

34
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,600
 That was in the early '70s.

35
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,760
 Diseases don't know borders.

36
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,920
 Well, you made a sound frontier. Is that what you were referring to?

37
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,920
 It was, yeah.

38
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,920
 It was, yeah.

39
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:47,580
 James Peterson, right? He's 76 years old, which is relevant. He said, "My name is James.

40
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:52,020
 I do enjoy your show while currently in the state of Idaho." He does some hospital visits

41
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,020
 in Idaho.

42
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,020
 Yep.

43
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:56,220
 He says, "Your podcast about goiters caught my attention as this affliction was rampant

44
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:01,900
 in the USA in many regions up until the 1920s. Same kind of era as in one of some of the

45
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:02,900
 good--

46
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:03,900
 Yeah.

47
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,100
 And he said, "I remember my mother, born in 1920, having a scar on her neck slash throat

48
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:09,940
 and I asked what happened and she said she had a goitre removed and she was raised in

49
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,440
 Montana and eastern Idaho and that was a lack of hiding."

50
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,440
 That's very interesting.

51
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,440
 There you go.

52
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,920
 And actually, I've just had a couple of flashbacks at times where I remember getting served by

53
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,740
 a waiter in one restaurant and a friend of a friend meeting them in another place.

54
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:23,740
 Is this America?

55
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:27,000
 And they both had these, no, in the UK, but I mean, they were more common all over the

56
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 world. And they had these huge scars on their necks and what you think is something really

57
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,320
 cool has happened there.

58
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,320
 Yeah.

59
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,120
 Like someone almost murdered you.

60
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,120
 Yeah.

61
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,160
 Do you think there's a story?

62
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,160
 Shark attack.

63
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,160
 Exactly.

64
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,160
 Shark attack.

65
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,900
 You're a spy who got into a bit of hot water in the Soviet Union or something.

66
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,420
 Turns out, I bet they all just had goitres removed.

67
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,420
 Yeah.

68
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,420
 Right.

69
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:52,740
 My dad worked at my school where I went and I have a scar on my face and he told everyone

70
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:55,620
 that I was bitten by a shark.

71
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,820
 And so it was very regularly.

72
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:01,220
 I would say once or twice a week, people would come up to me and go, "Is it true you were

73
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:03,100
 bitten by a shark when you were a baby?"

74
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,020
 We could change sharkin as a result.

75
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,020
 Yeah.

76
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:08,100
 They changed the entire surname of my family.

77
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,160
 No, your friends.

78
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,160
 Just them.

79
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,160
 Right.

80
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,160
 I see.

81
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,160
 Yeah.

82
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,160
 Damn your dad for not committing.

83
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,160
 Yeah.

84
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,660
 What did you say?

85
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:20,800
 I said no because I was a teenager and quite embarrassed that people were even talking

86
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,800
 to me.

87
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,360
 Was it in fact just a little facial goiter you had?

88
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,360
 Yes.

89
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,360
 Exactly.

90
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,840
 I had a sharpness of iodine in my cheek.

91
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:35,320
 What circumstances were you under supposedly in the story that as a baby you were bitten

92
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,320
 by a shark?

93
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,320
 That's very bad parenting.

94
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,760
 It doesn't reflect well on your dad that a shark was able to get to you.

95
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:45,560
 As a teacher, someone looking after everyone's children.

96
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:50,240
 And I also, after we read that article, think that I might be iodine deficient.

97
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,300
 I was going to ask if you had the results of your test, but I wondered if you wanted

98
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,300
 that question asked.

99
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,300
 No, I haven't.

100
00:04:55,300 --> 00:05:01,720
 There's some iodine deficiency in my family and I read about the symptoms and I feel like

101
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:06,220
 I've been running on about 70% for the last few years and I wonder if it's lack of iodine.

102
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:09,440
 It's completely unrelated to you becoming a parent and having no sleep for two years.

103
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,760
 I just feel tired all the time.

104
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:16,440
 I can hear this constant screaming and I think that's a symptom of iodine deficiency.

105
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:21,600
 I keep getting sick in September every year and I'm sure it's the iodine thing.

106
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,600
 It's an urge to watch.

107
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,080
 Thomas the Tank Engine and blowy.

108
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,080
 It's really weird.

109
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,080
 Yeah.

110
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,480
 Well, Natasha Lake from Chicago writes, a very punchy start.

111
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,480
 I don't know if you can see this.

112
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,480
 She writes on with the email just to begin.

113
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,480
 Lovely.

114
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,480
 What a great.

115
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,660
 Iodine, thyroid, all in caps.

116
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:39,660
 It's cool.

117
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:42,580
 It's the style of like an early 20th century newspaper headline, isn't it?

118
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,580
 Yeah.

119
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:44,580
 Shot Korra War.

120
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,580
 Yeah.

121
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:46,580
 Yeah.

122
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,460
 And she says, please mentally pronounce iodine the American way.

123
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:51,100
 Iodine for full effect.

124
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:56,300
 And she just writes about the fact that there was a goiter belt across America.

125
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,300
 Did it include Idaho?

126
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,340
 It was the Midwest and Great Lakes.

127
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:01,340
 So you tell me.

128
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,340
 Not really.

129
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,500
 I guess so.

130
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,360
 Idaho is further west than the Great Lakes for sure.

131
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,360
 Okay.

132
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,360
 Michigan?

133
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,360
 That is on the Great Lakes.

134
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,520
 That's further east than Idaho.

135
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,520
 Michigan.

136
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,280
 Michigan apparently had a whole load of that.

137
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,680
 And there was a U.S. Endemic Goiter Committee.

138
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,840
 And these days there is a concern because there are lots of salts which are kosher, Himalayan,

139
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,240
 speciality, which are not generally iodized.

140
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,240
 Yeah.

141
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,760
 We'll see the salts aren't they?

142
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,760
 No.

143
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,760
 Around the world I think we might have mentioned.

144
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,760
 Yeah.

145
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,240
 It's only the cheap shit salt.

146
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,260
 So here ends the goiter section of the show.

147
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,460
 We should do this every week.

148
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,460
 Yeah.

149
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:37,460
 Great section.

150
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,460
 Goiter pod.

151
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,540
 Here's a good email subject line.

152
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:41,540
 Can you smell my...

153
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,540
 Oh.

154
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,540
 Yeah.

155
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,540
 From Sophie Unwind.

156
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:45,540
 Got it.

157
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:46,540
 Can you smell my ass?

158
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:47,540
 Discourse continues.

159
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,540
 Oh, God.

160
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,540
 And this is great.

161
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:53,900
 She's a participant in a sport which she thinks has the most ass smelling.

162
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:54,900
 Ah.

163
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:55,900
 Oh.

164
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:56,900
 Okay.

165
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:57,900
 Can we guess what it is?

166
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:58,900
 I'd love you to guess.

167
00:06:58,900 --> 00:06:59,900
 I'm thinking...

168
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:00,900
 A sport.

169
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,520
 Is that in the Olympics?

170
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,520
 Yeah.

171
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,520
 It's got to be this year.

172
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,920
 I think it's been approved with skateboarding.

173
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:12,400
 I think there is a new spot in the Olympics which is sport climbing.

174
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,920
 So maybe if you're climbing behind someone...

175
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,920
 Very good.

176
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,920
 Oh.

177
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,200
 How about the sport of building a pyramid?

178
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,900
 You know the kids that...

179
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:21,900
 Oh.

180
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:22,900
 Do you know what I'm talking about?

181
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:23,900
 Human pyramid.

182
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:24,900
 Human pyramid.

183
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:25,900
 Yeah.

184
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:26,900
 Yeah.

185
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:27,900
 Yeah.

186
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,900
 But Egypt is very strong in the pyramid.

187
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:34,160
 Egypt takes it again.

188
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,800
 And it's brilliant because the podium afterwards, you have to build your own podium for the

189
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,800
 end of the year.

190
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,800
 Yeah.

191
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,800
 But you could get hundreds of thousands of people on each step of the pyramid.

192
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,960
 You go all the way to the top.

193
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,960
 So none of those things.

194
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,960
 No.

195
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,460
 It's not rugby or NFL where you're in a scrum and you use to meet those asses.

196
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:50,460
 No.

197
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,460
 I mean, I thought of rugby, but no.

198
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,460
 This is great.

199
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,460
 I'll tell you.

200
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,460
 She writes.

201
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:56,300
 Because there was actually a rugby player who put his finger up someone's bum.

202
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,300
 Oh, yeah.

203
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,160
 But lots of bums.

204
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,160
 The same finger?

205
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,640
 I think it was a thumb up the bum.

206
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,640
 Was it?

207
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,640
 I'm not sure.

208
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:08,260
 But it was multiple people reported saying he keeps putting his fingers up us.

209
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:12,500
 But is it your, there would be people on his team?

210
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,500
 No.

211
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,500
 On the opposition.

212
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,500
 Well, how long are his arms?

213
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:22,660
 If you're in a scrum with someone and you're in the second row, you can get to the bums

214
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:23,660
 of the people in the front row.

215
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:24,660
 There's a lot of...

216
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:25,660
 They are on your team.

217
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:28,020
 They're falling to the ground and trying to grab the ball.

218
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,580
 In a ruck rather than a scrum.

219
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:31,580
 What's a ruck again?

220
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:35,100
 Like Dan says, it's just everyone sort of on the ground and the balls in there and

221
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,100
 you're trying to get the ball out.

222
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:43,220
 It feels like this guy is fulfilling other, that feels like quite a lot of having to go

223
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:46,580
 to rather than in a scrum where you could just like pop a finger or a thumb in there.

224
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,780
 You were just saying it was impossible.

225
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,780
 I'm saying it's possible to get the other team.

226
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:51,780
 Yeah.

227
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,780
 Well, you don't want to put your finger up your own team's arms.

228
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:55,780
 I'm saying that's what I'm saying.

229
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,980
 Some people like having a finger up their ass.

230
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:00,660
 Would it motivate you in a scrum?

231
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:01,660
 Come on, mate.

232
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:02,660
 Pull my finger out.

233
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:03,660
 Get to action.

234
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,660
 Very good.

235
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:08,440
 So it's not Rugga.

236
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:12,780
 Sophie writes, it's in the first four words very well, she writes, "I'm a paricyclist."

237
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:13,780
 Ah.

238
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:14,780
 So that's tandem.

239
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:15,780
 Interesting, yeah.

240
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:18,540
 I think tandem may be the most apt use of the line.

241
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:22,380
 The ass you're close to belongs to your teammate, so it doesn't work as an insult, but I can't

242
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:25,580
 think of another sport that has you quite so close to someone else's ass.

243
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:26,580
 I agree.

244
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,940
 I've attached a picture of myself racing, so you can see what I mean.

245
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:30,820
 I am the one smelling the ass.

246
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:31,820
 Let's see.

247
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:32,820
 And here she is.

248
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,820
 Oh.

249
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:34,820
 Oh, yeah.

250
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:35,820
 The ass knows it.

251
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:36,820
 Oh, yeah.

252
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:37,820
 So she really is very, very close to it.

253
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:42,100
 I just feel like if normal tandems were like that, they might not sell quite as many.

254
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,100
 No, it's true.

255
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,100
 It's true.

256
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,700
 You might not see them all over the streets like you do today.

257
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:47,700
 Jason Kenney.

258
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,900
 Oh, thank you, Sophie.

259
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:56,060
 And his wife, Laura Kenney, who are two of the greatest Olympians in British history

260
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,660
 of cyclists.

261
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:58,660
 They have a tandem.

262
00:09:58,660 --> 00:09:59,660
 That's great.

263
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:02,980
 They must go a million miles an hour.

264
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,140
 That's amazing.

265
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:06,340
 The pantomime horse.

266
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,340
 That would be a very good one.

267
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,140
 And also, you're being closed.

268
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,140
 Absolutely.

269
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,140
 You've got to be careful there.

270
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:14,580
 So the pantomime horse, Grand National.

271
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:22,340
 Noah Bacon writes, "Yes, thank you, Noah."

272
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:27,940
 As a resident of Rockstow, I wanted to weigh in on the Seymour Cox discussion.

273
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:28,940
 Oh, I don't remember.

274
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:29,940
 Yeah.

275
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:30,940
 It was when Leung was here.

276
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:34,820
 And it was referring to an MP called Seymour Cox.

277
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:35,820
 Great.

278
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:36,820
 Yeah.

279
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:39,620
 In 1938, there was some debate over whether Lord Byron was actually buried in his family's

280
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:43,060
 vault in Hucknell, and a team of people went to exhume his body.

281
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:47,220
 Leung, that team, was the unfortunately named MP of neighbouring constituency Rockstow,

282
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,220
 Seymour Cox.

283
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:51,940
 Ironically, Seymour Cox and the rest of the group were shocked at the size of Byron's

284
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:52,940
 cock.

285
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:53,940
 You know what?

286
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:54,940
 We've said that.

287
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:55,940
 Like one of the first episodes.

288
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:56,940
 I've completely forgotten it.

289
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:00,460
 No, it was when we're, I'm pretty sure, on stage at Soho Theatre.

290
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:01,460
 Yeah.

291
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,460
 You mentioned it was.

292
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,460
 I remember James telling this fact.

293
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:04,460
 And you made the Seymour Cox, couldn't you?

294
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,460
 Yeah.

295
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,460
 I've completely forgot about it.

296
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,460
 There we go.

297
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,460
 Yeah.

298
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,460
 I remember that, too.

299
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,460
 Yeah.

300
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:12,460
 I think it was one of our first ever shows at the Soho Theatre, for sure.

301
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,460
 Yeah.

302
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,460
 Yeah.

303
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,460
 Oh, there we go.

304
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:16,460
 Nice to be reminded.

305
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,460
 Thank you, Noah.

306
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,460
 Did we know if they were shocked that it was too big or too small?

307
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:22,060
 Well, it was a hundred years after he died, so I really think you'd be shocked if there

308
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,580
 was anything there at all.

309
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:28,060
 Byron, you'd expect to have a huge member, so I think something very small would be

310
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:30,140
 more shocking than something very big.

311
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:32,140
 But a hundred years later, you just, there's.

312
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:33,140
 There's that just gaping.

313
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:34,140
 It does go, doesn't it?

314
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,140
 Yeah.

315
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,140
 No bone or anything.

316
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:37,140
 No.

317
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,140
 Yeah, that hole.

318
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,140
 Yeah.

319
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:44,300
 There's a little molepog in his head up where the penis should have been or a naked mole

320
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,300
 rat.

321
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,300
 That would be.

322
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,300
 Oh.

323
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:50,460
 Eric DeVos writes, "Just thought you might like to know the oldest sitting member of

326
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,300
 No, that's great.

327
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,500
 Thank you, Eric.

328
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,180
 It's called Tiny.

329
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,180
 Yeah.

330
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,180
 Yeah.

331
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,180
 Come on.

332
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,180
 That joke is a sitting Dutch.

333
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,180
 Oh, good grief.

334
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,180
 Oh.

335
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,900
 We're just doing an episode on dad jokes.

336
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,900
 I'm just catching up.

337
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:14,900
 Absolutely.

338
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:20,020
 Oh, I think we all smelt your ass there.

339
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:25,500
 Tom Coombs writes, "Hello from Newfoundland," Newfoundland, Newfoundland, one of those

340
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,500
 would be.

341
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,500
 Pick one, Tom.

342
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:31,100
 No, I can never, I always say it wrong.

343
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,220
 I always say it wrong.

344
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,220
 Newfoundland.

345
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,220
 Newfoundland.

346
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,220
 Sorry.

347
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:38,660
 I mean, you've slowly been taking up an item of shirt clothing.

348
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:43,580
 Don, do you remember this is the strip podcast?

349
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:48,340
 Every time you say a terrible joke, you have to take an item of clothing on.

350
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,420
 Oh, dear.

351
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,420
 It's heating up in here, all right?

352
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,420
 Yeah.

353
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,420
 Melissa's going to sense it.

354
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,420
 I can sense it.

355
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,420
 All these cocks.

356
00:12:55,420 --> 00:13:02,580
 Tom Coombs writes, "Hello from there, I recently drove across Canada from coast to coast.

357
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:06,460
 I stayed at a motel in the town of Shriver, Ontario."

358
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,460
 Oh, cool.

359
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:11,700
 "I really wanted to send a postcard from there to you with an interesting fact about the

360
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,700
 town.

361
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:15,700
 Unfortunately, I found neither an interesting fact nor a postcard."

362
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:20,420
 Why does that somehow feel like a massive slam on the news?

363
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:21,420
 I don't know.

364
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,420
 It does.

365
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,420
 It does.

366
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:24,420
 So, I said you this email with no facts.

367
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,420
 So, anyway.

368
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:26,420
 That's cool.

369
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,220
 Actually, I didn't know there was a place called Shriver, Ontario.

370
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,220
 No?

371
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,220
 There you go.

372
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,220
 We should do a gig there.

373
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,220
 Yeah.

374
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,860
 I don't know who's named after her.

375
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:35,780
 This is actually a proper correction.

376
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:38,420
 So something we, I think, slightly flubbed on.

377
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,420
 Charlotte Van Uweek.

378
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:43,020
 There's a lot of people from the Low Countries, right, and then this week.

379
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:47,260
 Well, you think she is, but the rest of it, no, no, no.

380
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:53,420
 Well, she's from Australia, and she said in episode, very good, very good.

381
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:55,660
 Dan, this is the proper serious bit of the show.

382
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:56,660
 Sorry.

383
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:57,660
 I'm afraid we're going to need to tap in.

384
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,660
 No.

385
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:01,420
 She says, "In episode 514, you stated that Australia is the second largest user of bottled

386
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,420
 water.

387
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:06,700
 This fact isn't incorrect as such, but you missed out a lot of crucial context.

388
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:10,260
 You speculated that the reason for so many plastic bottled water sales must be because

389
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:13,380
 everyone is so busy frolicking on the beach."

390
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:14,660
 And actually, it's not that.

391
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:18,260
 And she goes on to say, "The main reason there is so much bottled water sold is multiple

392
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:23,620
 country towns have literally run out of water due to climate change-related severe droughts,

393
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:26,820
 and there are also floods which can contaminate water, which means you need to have lots of

394
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:27,820
 bottled water as well."

395
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:34,740
 So our amusing beach-based barbecue scenario was definitely, because I don't think we knew.

396
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:35,740
 We just needed the stat.

397
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:36,740
 No.

398
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:37,740
 No, that's very interesting.

399
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:41,660
 Brings the mood down, certainly, of that initial fact, but it is very interesting.

400
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:42,660
 There we go.

401
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:43,660
 And sorry for slandering the Aussies.

402
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:44,660
 Yeah.

403
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:45,660
 It's actually a very nice email.

404
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:46,660
 She just sort of says, "That's why."

405
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:47,660
 Yeah, that's why.

406
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:48,660
 It sounds very nice.

407
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:52,940
 I've read out the bit we most need to deal.

408
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:55,780
 I haven't included the bit where she says, "I like listening to the show."

409
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:56,780
 Yeah.

410
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:57,780
 That's very nice.

411
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:03,660
 Can I just say also, I stand by all previous slandering of the Aussies, just on this particular

412
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:04,660
 point, fine.

413
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:05,660
 Okay.

414
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:06,660
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

415
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,660
 I don't think we're being asked to correct anything else.

416
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:09,660
 Okay.

417
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,660
 Is that why I'm on this show?

418
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,660
 Just to be safe, one of my friends is an Australian.

419
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:15,660
 I can say it.

420
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:19,060
 I was like, "This show is a whole slandering of the Australians."

421
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:22,140
 I'm like, "Let's find the most stupid Australian we can."

422
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:24,140
 Oh, my God.

423
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:33,340
 Can't find anyone stupid enough, so I got you to pretend to be an Aussie 12 years ago.

424
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:36,580
 So, yeah, apologies, hold your hands up to that.

425
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:40,820
 I think that's a fair cop, a fair cop.

426
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:44,500
 Alan Wood writes, "Just another arm actually."

427
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,100
 This is about Bethany England.

428
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,100
 Oh, yes.

429
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,820
 I know it's a Jengar apology, but it's not.

430
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:53,660
 So, another footballer who's named after the country they represented.

431
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:54,660
 Yes.

432
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,020
 She was the one we mentioned.

433
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,020
 Yeah.

434
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,020
 Simon Ivory Coast.

435
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,020
 That's right.

436
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:02,580
 And then someone written and said, "Steve and Ireland play for Ireland."

437
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,580
 Yeah.

438
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:05,140
 Who, fair enough, I should have known him.

439
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:08,020
 Well, this is a Jengar, I'm actually from Alan.

440
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:11,740
 Bethany England hasn't played for a country that's shared her name because England isn't

441
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:16,780
 a country, England isn't recognised as a country by the United Nations and can be referred

442
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:18,980
 to as a home nation during international events.

443
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:19,980
 Interesting.

444
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:20,980
 Yeah, that's a good point.

445
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:24,540
 I'm going to try and exhibit this level of, he actually writes, "Pendantry."

446
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,900
 I'm sorry to grass you up here, Alan.

447
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:27,900
 I'm sorry.

448
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,660
 Maybe he's just wearing a big necklace when you write.

449
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:34,740
 I'm sorry, but if you come at us with an "I'm actually," I'm going to run over this every

450
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,140
 single word, scrupulous.

451
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:38,420
 Well, these guys read pen out.

452
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,420
 Absolutely.

453
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,100
 It's the worst word to miss, Belle, isn't it?

454
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,420
 I always wonder if he's done that deliberately.

455
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,420
 Yeah.

456
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:50,380
 I've never heard that before because I did, up until a second ago, think it was a country.

457
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:52,100
 I think it is a country in some respects.

458
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,580
 It depends how you define country.

459
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:59,180
 That's why on Pointless, every time they have to define country as a member of the United

460
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:00,180
 Nations.

461
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,180
 Because it's the UK.

462
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,180
 Yeah, yeah.

463
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:04,980
 And England was a country and then it merged with Scotland and Wales.

464
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:09,820
 But it is a country in a sporting sense by most definitions, obviously, because if we

465
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:13,860
 said the British football team, then the Scots, they'd stop listening.

466
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:18,940
 I feel like constitutionally in the UK, we talk about the four countries of the United

467
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:19,940
 Kingdom.

468
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:20,940
 Yes.

469
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:21,940
 OK.

470
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:22,940
 Oh, Wales, yeah.

471
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:23,940
 Oh, my God, Anna.

472
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:24,940
 Come on, come on.

473
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:31,500
 Anna, this show is an attempt to clear the inbox.

474
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,500
 Wow.

475
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,420
 Bethany, England delivers again.

476
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,420
 She'll be back.

477
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:43,300
 I feel like Bethany, England is a nickname for Anna, you know, so her identity.

478
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,460
 Oh, goodness me.

479
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,420
 There's maybe the best pedantic email we've had this week.

480
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:53,020
 This is from someone with a great name, Cesar Almeida from Brazil, from Brasilia.

481
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:58,660
 Cesar writes, "As a Brazilian living in Brazil," sorry, I'll cover that, "I've just in the

482
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:03,100
 last couple of weeks discovered QI and then last week fishing around for something to

483
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:06,940
 listen to during an impending drive across the country, I found fish.

484
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:09,380
 On episode 479, you refer to the Aldi Equator."

485
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,380
 Oh, yeah.

486
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,380
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

487
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,380
 The shop Aldi.

488
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:16,020
 The two brothers, they divided all the branches of Aldi between north and south.

489
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,580
 Anyway, you refer to the Aldi Equator.

490
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:24,620
 But it occurred to me that since the Equator, though imaginary, is defined by its equidistance

491
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:28,780
 from the poles and is therefore not subject to convention, the best metaphor for the Aldi

492
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:34,940
 Brothers Agreement would surely be the Torcedes Treaty of 1494 between Spain and Portugal.

493
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:37,220
 Yeah, that's fair.

494
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:39,300
 I think that's a completely fair cop.

495
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,580
 Well, that's what created Brazil, right?

496
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:45,940
 I think because they just decided all the bits on this side are going to belong to Spain,

497
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:49,420
 all the bits on this side are going to belong to Portugal, and Brazil, obviously, is the

498
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,980
 only Portuguese-speaking country in South America.

499
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:52,980
 Right.

500
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:53,980
 Well, there we go.

501
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,500
 That's close to this person's heart.

502
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,660
 That's chapter and verse.

503
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,820
 I mean, great.

504
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:58,820
 Wonderful.

505
00:18:58,820 --> 00:18:59,820
 Great point.

506
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:00,820
 Yeah.

507
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:04,020
 I think it's only a lack of intimate familiarity with the Torcedes Treaty of 1494 that meant

508
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,940
 I, you know, or we mentioned that.

509
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:08,180
 I'm just kicking myself that I didn't think of that.

510
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,180
 Yeah.

511
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,180
 Do you want to hear a bung-hole email?

512
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,180
 Oh, yes, please.

513
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,180
 Yeah, always.

514
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:15,540
 Ben from Connecticut writes, "Your recent episode mentioned lots

515
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:18,900
 of bung things like bung holes and the like, but also mentioned baseball.

516
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:22,140
 It so happens there is a minor league team that was briefly called the Beer City Bung

517
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,140
 Hammers."

518
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,140
 Beer City.

519
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:33,460
 What a great, is that a nickname for an actual, because there's no beer city in America, is

520
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,460
 there?

521
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,460
 Right.

522
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:38,820
 Well, it was a brief renaming of the West Michigan White Caps, a low-level affiliate

523
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:39,980
 of the Detroit Tigers.

524
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:40,980
 I'm in so deep.

525
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,580
 I'm in so deep in my head.

526
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:45,260
 So they changed their name for a few games for promotional reasons.

527
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:46,420
 There we go.

528
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,420
 That's great, though.

529
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,420
 Yeah.

530
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,420
 Bung Hammers.

531
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:52,300
 And then Ben goes on to write, "I don't know if you guys can confirm this, you supporters.

532
00:19:52,300 --> 00:20:00,780
 Other good, real, full-time team names include the sod poodles, the trash pandas, rumble ponies,

533
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:03,660
 jumbo shrimp, sock puppets, and disco turkeys."

534
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:10,740
 That's a stunning, a baseball-panda-related fact.

535
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:18,960
 In Bhutan, the baseball teams are all named after animals that live in Bhutan.

536
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:24,060
 And in Timpu, their capital, their team is called the Timpu Red Pandas.

537
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:29,380
 And what that means is, this is a really cool thing they do, any money that each team gets

538
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:34,860
 goes into conservation for whichever team is named after themselves, whichever animal.

539
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:35,860
 That's awesome.

540
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:36,860
 Yeah.

541
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:37,860
 I didn't say that very well.

542
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:42,180
 Basically, the red panda conservation gets all the money from the Timpu Red Pandas.

543
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,180
 Right.

544
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,180
 That's lovely.

545
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,180
 That's awesome.

546
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,180
 Yeah.

547
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,180
 Is there a Yeti team?

548
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,180
 Because there is a Yeti party, isn't there?

549
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,180
 According to the Bhutanese.

550
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,180
 Yeah.

551
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,180
 There's a...

552
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:52,180
 I don't believe...

553
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:54,740
 To be honest, I didn't read through all the names, but I didn't see a Yeti name.

554
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:55,740
 Okay.

555
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:56,740
 Yeah.

556
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:57,740
 No one has.

557
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:01,220
 And we did have an email about that, actually.

558
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:04,820
 It was a fact email, so I didn't put it in this document, but it was about how Yeti sightings

559
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:08,060
 go up proportionally to the number of, I think it was, black bears in an area.

560
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:12,660
 Like, if there are more black bears, you'll get a certain amount of Yeti sightings.

561
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:14,980
 Because they prey on black bears.

562
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:15,980
 That's right.

563
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:16,980
 That's their name.

564
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:22,060
 Wait, do you not include fact emails in this bit of the show?

565
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:23,060
 God no.

566
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,940
 No, because we have a new outlet for those.

567
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:25,940
 Yeah, okay.

568
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:26,940
 Yeah.

569
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,820
 A new sleuths, a new porthole has opened.

570
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,940
 It's content free.

571
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,260
 Yeah.

572
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:33,700
 We can't have content in this show.

573
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:34,700
 No.

574
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,980
 This is the light relief.

575
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:37,980
 Yeah.

576
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:38,980
 A nice...

577
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:40,700
 Oh, here's one.

578
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,700
 This is a...

579
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,700
 I'm afraid this is quite a serious one.

580
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:43,700
 Okay.

581
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:44,700
 It's from Kevin Ryan.

582
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,700
 I'm just going to read the whole thing, all right?

583
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,700
 Yeah.

584
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,980
 I'm writing to say how shocked and disappointed I was to hear Anna telling that Bunga Bunga

585
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:51,060
 joke during a recent episode.

586
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:53,700
 I'm sure many other listeners felt the same.

587
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:58,020
 The punchline should have been that the third captor, having seen the awful state the first

588
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:03,420
 two were in after Bunga Bunga, asks for death instead, to which the captor cries out, "Death

589
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,420
 by Bunga Bunga."

590
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:05,420
 Yeah.

591
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:06,420
 No, that's an alternative.

592
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,420
 Sure.

593
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:09,420
 I think both work fine.

594
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:11,140
 That's the version I know as well.

595
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,420
 It's the version I know too.

596
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:13,420
 They're both funny.

597
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:14,420
 I'm afraid the game...

598
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,420
 Kevin Ryan doesn't know.

599
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,420
 Is that Anna knows comedy.

600
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,420
 Is that right?

601
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:25,340
 But you were saying the version that was Colonel Gaddafi and Mussolini's favourite joke, right?

602
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,340
 Oh, yeah.

603
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:27,340
 Yes.

604
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:28,340
 So that was...

605
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,340
 So I think I'm on the right side of this one, guys.

606
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:30,940
 You're on the right side of history.

607
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:31,940
 Yeah.

608
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:32,940
 Yeah.

609
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:33,940
 No, that's fair.

610
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:34,940
 Yeah.

611
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:35,940
 This is a very cool email.

612
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:36,940
 It's from a few episodes ago.

613
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:39,620
 Dan, you were talking about John Williams and he conducted the E.T. school.

614
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:40,620
 That's right.

615
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:41,620
 Yeah.

616
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:44,460
 So this is from Tiffany Chang from Melbourne.

617
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:48,800
 She's a musician and she plays and she does film schools sometimes.

618
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:53,100
 And it's just about how they play the soundtrack with the film on the screen behind them.

619
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,100
 Yeah.

620
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,100
 Very cool.

621
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,100
 Yeah.

622
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,100
 I love it.

623
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,420
 And they also have a click track in their ear.

624
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,420
 Like a metronome.

625
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,420
 Yeah.

626
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,420
 Exactly.

627
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,420
 Yeah, yeah.

628
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,420
 I love this bit of her email.

629
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,420
 Yeah.

630
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,860
 I love the movie on the screen in front of them with the beats flashing up across the

631
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:09,620
 screen like in Guitar Hero.

632
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:13,300
 And some of the conductors we've had during the Star Wars series had their own special

633
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,500
 battons that they used for a bit of the performance.

634
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:20,780
 One had a mini lightsaber that properly lit up and another had a wand for the Harry Potter

635
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:21,780
 movies.

636
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:22,780
 Cool.

637
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:23,780
 Yeah.

638
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:24,780
 Wow.

639
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:25,780
 Not a real lightsaber though.

640
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,780
 Didn't do the musicians any harm, did it?

641
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:28,780
 No.

642
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:31,780
 I mean, the whole brass section was just run through.

643
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:34,940
 Left with the smoking on the head.

644
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:37,220
 And we talk about conductors calling out the names of the instruments.

645
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,220
 Yeah, we did.

646
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,220
 Yeah.

647
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:42,820
 So Tiffany writes, "As for conductors shouting instruments at us, that does happen.

648
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:46,500
 When I first started playing in youth orchestras, when I was seven or so, I was reduced to

649
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,940
 tears thinking I was being yelled at personally."

650
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:52,140
 Turns out he wasn't yelling Tiffany, he was yelling at the timpani.

651
00:23:52,140 --> 00:24:00,420
 And we've done that fact about, you know, in Star Wars, there's the cantina where there's

652
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:02,920
 like a jazz band playing.

653
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,660
 What that style of music is called?

654
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,140
 We've never done it, but I know it.

655
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,300
 Yeah, it's called jizz.

656
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,300
 No.

657
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,300
 The name jizz.

658
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,300
 Wow.

659
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,300
 Is that invented?

660
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,300
 The word was invented by Star Wars.

661
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:16,380
 I think George Lucas might have come up with it or someone in the responsible for naming

662
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,380
 in the universe.

663
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:18,380
 Oh, that's great.

664
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:22,740
 There's an email here, "Headlined possible vindication for Andy," which I'm afraid we've

665
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:23,740
 got to read.

666
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:24,740
 No, we can't.

667
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:25,740
 We can't.

668
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:30,140
 "Lynse Vicnes writes, "On at least two occasions, the other three have made fun of you for

669
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:34,540
 the way you pronounce," oh god.

670
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:35,540
 Frontier.

671
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,220
 That's how you pronounce it.

672
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,220
 That's how you pronounce it.

673
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,220
 Yeah.

674
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,220
 And Houston.

675
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,220
 Yes.

676
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,220
 Houston.

677
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:43,220
 That's how you say it.

678
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,220
 Houston is how I say it.

679
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,220
 We say Houston and frontier.

680
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:46,720
 And what do I say?

681
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,720
 Houston and frontier.

682
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,720
 Houston and frontier.

683
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,720
 Got it.

684
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,720
 Okay.

685
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,720
 I may be able to get you off the hook.

686
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,720
 Off the hook.

687
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:57,900
 I've just been rewatching a documentary series called Coast.

688
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:01,420
 One of the hosts is Scottish, brackets Neil Oliver.

689
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:07,300
 And in the span of two episodes, he said those words and he pronounces them like you do.

690
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:10,340
 He also pronounces them in several episodes after that, so they weren't just a fluke.

691
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:12,220
 I seem to remember your part, Scottish.

692
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,760
 Maybe you're not pronouncing them wrong.

693
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,580
 Maybe you're pronouncing them Scottish.

694
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:16,880
 So that's great.

695
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,460
 I'm glad to be vindicated as maybe just a bit Scottish.

696
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:21,740
 But Neil Oliver is not.

697
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:23,440
 I don't actually know who Neil Oliver is.

698
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,860
 He doesn't just host Coast anymore.

699
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:26,480
 He's now one of the main hosts on GB News.

700
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,480
 Oh, really?

701
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:30,160
 And he's very much in the sort of vaccines make you ill.

702
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,160
 Oh, really?

703
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,880
 But he was such a normal, great host on Coast.

704
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,880
 Back in the day.

705
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,880
 Absolutely.

706
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,880
 It came out of nowhere.

707
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,040
 It was a sort of pandemic out of nowhere moment.

708
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,040
 Yeah.

709
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:43,760
 Oh, a health note for Dan, Isabella Wickstead writes, "I listened to your podcast before

710
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,920
 going to sleep.

711
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:48,160
 I heard Dan saying that his canines have disappeared in recent years."

712
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,160
 Yeah.

713
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,160
 Did you say that?

714
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,160
 No.

715
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,160
 We used to have them.

716
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,160
 You don't have them now?

717
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:59,500
 It's possible they were shaved off while I was having mouth stuff done to me as a kid.

718
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,500
 I don't like mouth stuff.

719
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,560
 I had a really experimental dentist.

720
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,020
 He was a giant German guy who did things to my face.

721
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:06,020
 Was it sorry?

722
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:08,540
 He said they're great.

723
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:09,540
 He was huge.

724
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:11,300
 George Eliot level hand size.

725
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,300
 He was...

726
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,300
 Sorry, what?

727
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,300
 Yeah.

728
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,300
 What are you talking about?

729
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,300
 What are you talking about?

730
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:19,920
 I had something that I, as far as I know, no one else ever has had before.

731
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,500
 Because this guy was experimenting in Hong Kong.

732
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,500
 He...

733
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,500
 What did he do?

734
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,500
 So I had an overbite in my...

735
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,500
 So my top...

736
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,500
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

737
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,500
 An overbite.

738
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:32,260
 Instead of rectifying it by just putting braces on, he put a piston system of metal inside

739
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:36,260
 my mouth, pulled my bottom jaw forward like that.

740
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,260
 So I had...

741
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:38,620
 So for the listener, my jaw is way in front of my...

742
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:39,620
 So he gave you an underbite.

743
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:45,000
 A huge underbite, which I had to keep for nine months, held by these pistons, and these

744
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:50,940
 pistons would go...if I open my mouth too wide, the pistons could come out, but most likely

745
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:57,060
 they would lock, and I would be stuck dribbling for about 20 minutes trying to get out.

746
00:26:57,060 --> 00:27:02,860
 So it was a really weird system, and in that period, if possible, he shaved my teeth.

747
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:04,340
 Are you Frankenstein?

748
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:06,940
 I think he was, the monster.

749
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,820
 That's so weird.

750
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:09,820
 Yeah, it was really odd.

751
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:11,420
 I'm really surprised I've never heard that.

752
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:13,180
 We've known each other for more than 20 years.

753
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:14,180
 Yeah, I'm surprised.

754
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:15,180
 I've never heard that.

755
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:18,440
 Because the guy who did the theme tune for our show, our friend Ash Gardner, he's been

756
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,440
 on the show and so on.

757
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,360
 He went to the same guy as well, and Ash used to have a thing where he kept sucking his

758
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,920
 thumb as he was getting older.

759
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,320
 So what the guy put in was...

760
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:30,280
 Because he gave him revolving thumbs, special steam canisters.

761
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,760
 It sounds so steam punk, isn't it?

762
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,760
 Yeah, exactly.

763
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:38,240
 So what he put in was a metal contraption in the top of his mouth that had a spike.

764
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,240
 What?

765
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,240
 What?

766
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,640
 So every time Ash sucked his thumb, it would push the metal spike into him.

767
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,640
 No, stop it.

768
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,640
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

769
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,660
 This is honestly what happened to us as kids in Hong Kong.

770
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,140
 This guy needs his license taking away.

771
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,140
 Is he still operating?

772
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,140
 Was this guy...

773
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,140
 Was he a sort of...

774
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,140
 Sadist?

775
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,140
 What was he?

776
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,140
 I don't know.

777
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,140
 My parents sent him to me.

778
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,140
 Have you ever seen the human centipede?

779
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,140
 No.

780
00:27:57,140 --> 00:28:00,820
 Because he did have work afterwards.

781
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:01,820
 Yeah.

782
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:02,820
 Tan.

783
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:03,820
 Yeah.

784
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:04,820
 That's really traumatising.

785
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:07,660
 I would not have spoken to my parents for a few years after they made me do that.

786
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:10,540
 Imagine going to school with an underbite that was connected by pistons.

787
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:16,000
 I think once that's happened to you, speaking to anyone is not really an issue for quite

788
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 a few years.

789
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,800
 Is this why your mouth has that chimney?

790
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,800
 That is really...

791
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,800
 It was really odd.

792
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,800
 Yeah.

793
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,720
 I feel like we should mention Isabel's email, which...

794
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,720
 Oh, yeah.

795
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,720
 Sorry.

796
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,720
 Sorry.

797
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,120
 I heard Dan saying his canons have disappeared in recent years.

798
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,120
 Yeah.

799
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,440
 Isabel, we've already answered a lot of your questions here.

800
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,240
 I made a note to email myself about it.

801
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,880
 "Dan, you should do a sleep study.

802
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:43,380
 I found out a couple of months ago at the dentist," - don't bring that up, Isabel - "that

803
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:48,020
 if you have unexpectedly straight teeth along the bottom, you may be grinding them in your

804
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,380
 sleep due to sleep apnea.

805
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:50,380
 Get it checked."

806
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:52,660
 Well, it turns out, Dan, you don't need to do that because your teeth were shaved by

807
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:53,660
 a German giant.

808
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:54,660
 Oh, great.

809
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:55,660
 Bye.

810
00:28:55,660 --> 00:29:09,100
 You'll be hearing from my liars soon.

811
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,100
 Oh.

812
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,100
 Yes.

813
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:18,060
 That's some callback to last time when we said that Anna and I had hated it.

814
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:20,460
 Someone sent through a list of alternatives for me.

815
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,460
 No, Orion Slater.

816
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:22,460
 Amazing name.

817
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:23,460
 Sent through a list of...

818
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,460
 Orion.

819
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:25,460
 Orion.

820
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:26,460
 Orion.

821
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,460
 Wow.

822
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:28,460
 Like of belt fame.

823
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:29,460
 Yeah.

824
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:30,460
 Yeah.

825
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:31,460
 Nice.

826
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:32,460
 A steely stare at the other three.

827
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:33,460
 A special gong.

828
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:37,700
 An improvised limerick directly relevant to matters discussed in the episode.

829
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:42,520
 Jesus, we don't have to wait 25 minutes for you to start with that.

830
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:45,260
 Just don't say anything at even more abruptly end.

831
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:46,260
 Yes.

832
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,260
 I'll interrupt you guys.

833
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:48,260
 No.

834
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,260
 I'll say pip pip.

835
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:50,260
 No.

836
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:51,260
 Thanks, everybody.

837
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:52,260
