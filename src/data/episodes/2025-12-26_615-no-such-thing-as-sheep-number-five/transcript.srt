 Hi everyone, Merry Christmas and welcome to this episode of No Such Thing as a Fish.

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:14,480
 We have something very special for you today. It is our Christmas special. Well, it's kind of a

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:20,240
 20-25 special. We've looked at this entire year and we found our favorite news stories. Do you

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,040
 remember when we used to do our own TV show called No Such Things and News? Well, this is a kind of

6
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:29,600
 version of that where we don't have to do makeup. I don't have to sit in front of the camera.

7
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,960
 I really hope you enjoy it. I really hope you had a great Christmas. I know not everyone

8
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,360
 has a great time this time of year, but if you didn't, I hope you can kind of just turn off

9
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,640
 for the next hour and listen to us. Be really silly. If you'd like some more fish in your life perhaps

10
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:48,960
 to help that time between Christmas and New Year go very, very quickly, then the place to go is

11
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,880
 definitely Patreon. It's patreon.com/no Such Thing as a Fish and there you can find everything about

00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:30,000
 be free. Okay, I'll be the podcast.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,120
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a very special Boxing Day edition.

17
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:41,600
 I hope you had a great Christmas. I hope you got all the presents you wanted and here's an extra

18
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,320
 present for you, a sort of different No Such Thing as a Fish today because we are going to be going

19
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,880
 through not our favorite facts from the last seven days, but our favorite bits of news from the last

20
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:58,080
 365 days. We are now presenting the podcast of the year in sort of tribute to our books,

21
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:03,280
 The Book of the Year and our TV show No Such Thing as the News. So this is the podcast of the book

22
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:09,280
 of the TV show of the podcast of the podcast of the TV show because it came from QI.

23
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:15,280
 Yeah. So this is the podcast of the book of the TV show of the podcast of the TV show and in no

24
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:22,240
 particular order, here we go. It's like the Blade Runner of podcasts. Yeah. So we're actually doing

25
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:26,000
 something different today because as well as finding our favorite news stories, we have actually

26
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,440
 tracked down characters from the news to tell us their story. And so I'm going to go first. I'm going

27
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:37,040
 to play a little bit of audio now and James and Andy, let's see if you can work out who this is

28
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,600
 from the news this year. Okay. I know such thing as a fish. This is Maryl Burnett from the department

29
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:46,640
 of psychological and brain sciences at the University of Massachusetts and most. This year,

30
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,760
 along with my co-writer Paul Silvia, I published a scientific paper that set out to answer a very

31
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:57,680
 important question. So what do you think that question was? Oh, okay, quite vague. Quite vague.

32
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:05,440
 University of Massachusetts, so Boston, perhaps. Yep. Some to do with the tea party. Oh,

33
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,920
 so do the New England Patriots for the team? How many sugars were there in the Boston

34
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:17,360
 tea party? How many sandwiches? Yeah. No, we're nowhere near close. And yes, it is so vague that

35
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,760
 it's going to be virtually impossible to get. Well, no, Dan's interests. Yeah, via to the

36
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:28,880
 cryptid. His wife. There's no way of talking about vanilla. Sorry, I didn't hear what you said

37
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:35,360
 initially. The cryptid. Oh, sorry, yeah. Harry, mythical and terrifying beast. Vanilla is much

38
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:41,440
 loved by everyone. That's such thing as fish. I think God, she doesn't listen to our show.

39
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:47,120
 So is it they've discovered why people believe for this rubbish? No, it's not to do with, it's not

40
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:53,200
 to do with that sort of weird world. Psychologist, did she say? Yeah. So it's something to do with the way

41
00:03:53,200 --> 00:04:01,840
 that people act. Maybe why we cry? Why we cry in public? Why I cry in public? Why we kiss? That's been

42
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,480
 the study this year. That has been a study. Well, because it's good for podcast team unity. It's

43
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:13,840
 just stops you crying. I think it's relevant to what ends up happening a lot on this show when we

44
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:19,600
 tedious arguments about minor points of information. But now jokes. Oh, now we're getting into

45
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,480
 the zone. Bad jokes. It's not bad jokes. Let me give you the answer. Here's the answer from

46
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:30,320
 Maryl Burnett. The question we asked was what's brown and sticky? And the answer, of course, is a stick.

47
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,880
 Actually, that was just the title of the paper. The thing we really wanted to know is who finds

48
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:39,920
 dad jokes funny. And after collecting over 32,000 jokes and putting them to a group of volunteers,

49
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:45,280
 we found our answer. And so my fact for your podcast of the year is this. The people who find

50
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:52,800
 dad jokes the funniest are, in fact, dads. Oh, well, I beg to differ. My daughter fives by jokes hilarious.

51
00:04:52,800 --> 00:05:00,160
 I agree with you. If our kids were involved in this, now this is Maryl Burnett. And she wrote a paper

52
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,360
 this year called What's Brown and Sticky peering into the electable comedic mystery of dad humor,

53
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,000
 with a handful of machine learning models, hundreds of humans, and tens of thousands of dad jokes.

54
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,400
 And so they collected 32,000 different dad jokes, which can all now be found on one PDF online,

55
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:21,040
 by the way, if anyone wants to get their hands on that. So they came out with multiple different

56
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:27,280
 conclusions, but the main one being that dads definitely found the dad jokes the funniest of any group.

57
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,800
 I think that makes sense because you wouldn't tell the joke if you didn't think it was funny.

58
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,880
 Yes. So you automatically think it's funny when you say it.

59
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:40,240
 I'm not sure I always do. I'm just trying to get a laugh. And I'm pretty dead behind the eyes,

60
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,360
 you know, what I'm telling any joke, actually. Are we talking about, yeah, we're not talking about

61
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,320
 dad jokes here, are we? We're talking about your stand-up set. Just anything I do. Yeah. I'm trying

62
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:53,920
 to get a laugh, but that's the only calculation I make is for the audience laugh. Okay, fair enough.

63
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:58,640
 And they often don't. Interesting, because I'm so self-centred, all I care about is whether I find it

64
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:04,240
 funny or not. But this says a lot about us. Yeah, yeah. What about Dan? You just do long

65
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:11,680
 stuatly style monobugs to your kids, don't you? They don't usually hear the end of the punchline

66
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,760
 because they're gone to school by that time. Surely, there is no punchline. That's where means

67
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:22,480
 to it slightly, right? I try to swing a punchline in about the 25-minute mark. Yeah, it's an interesting

68
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:27,600
 study. I asked her actually, by the way, about what her least favorite dad joke was because, you know,

69
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,000
 she must have her favorites and her the ones she doesn't like. She said these are the two. It's a tie.

70
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:39,440
 Why is a fish my best friend? Because he's with me single swim. Oh, really good. It's really nice.

71
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:45,920
 Yeah, I don't know. He always keeps it real with me. Now, she hates that because she says,

72
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:51,120
 real is obviously a fishing term and real sounds like real, which would make it keep it real,

73
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:56,800
 a proper sentence, but keeps it real makes no sense. She just hates the logic that that doesn't apply.

74
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,520
 Is it real? What does that mean? Keeps a real. Keeps it real. Keeps itself on the end of the real.

75
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:06,080
 Yeah, yeah. I see what you mean. Doesn't work. So she hates it for the lack of logic. She says,

76
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:12,400
 contrast this with justice is a dish best served cold. If it were served warm, it would be called

77
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:18,320
 just water. Because it's just ice. Yeah, certainly. That works better in the Boston accent.

78
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:22,640
 And it works as well, I think, as a sentence, rather than as a spoken out thing. I actually think the

79
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:27,760
 first one isn't a dad joke. To me, a dad joke is something you say repeatedly whenever something

80
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:32,960
 happens. Yes. Like if your kid says, I'm thirsty, you say, hello, first day, I'm Friday. Yes.

81
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,680
 And this is my friend, Robin, it's a true. So like, and but they do it all the time. Every single time.

82
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:44,400
 Or like Anna's mum, who whenever Anna said, can you turn on the lights, she would go over and start

83
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:49,840
 flirting with lights. I think that is a proper dad joke. That's proper dad joke. And I don't think

84
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:55,200
 a bad joke is a dad joke personally. I say one. Yeah. Yeah. That's a good point. I say a dad joke

85
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:59,360
 virtually every day in our house, which is the same one. It's the same one. At the end of the day,

86
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,640
 finale will say, can you draw the curtains? And I always say, well, I'd love to, but I don't have a pen.

87
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:12,880
 The kids got to bed hours ago. Jesus, I'm paging across the Tibetan Highlands.

88
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:20,640
 So anyway, thank you so much, Maryl Burnett. Yeah, great work. But this brings us into the world of

89
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:24,960
 science, science news. Yeah, do you know there was a study this year that found

90
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:30,480
 that Kappu might be the cause of the decline of fertility around the world? Okay, so more people

91
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:36,640
 have cats. More cats means more Kappu. Yeah. Kappu is horrible. Yeah. The more you're exposed to Kappu,

92
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:41,040
 the less likely you are to think, I'm in the mood for love. Actually, didn't we say in one of our

93
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:46,160
 earlier podcasts that the more disgusted you are? Or the more aroused you are. That's just the

94
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,680
 opposite the other way around. I can't remember. It's the more aroused you are, the more you're willing

95
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,640
 to do disgusting things. Okay, so maybe it's like every time someone gets a bit hardy, instead of

96
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:59,120
 having sex and having children, they go and take the Kappu out. Yes, yes, exactly.

97
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:06,160
 Now what this is, is it's toxoplasma gondii, which is a parasite that you find in Kappu.

98
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,400
 There's been studies about this for a while, like if they give it to mice, it makes them more brave

99
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:16,800
 and stuff like that. Yes, yeah. But they found this year that if you put human sperm in Kappu,

100
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:23,680
 then the sperm gets decapitated. It's okay. And so they wonder if there might be something in the Kappu

101
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:30,160
 that could be a natural spermicide. And that could be the cause for the fact that male fertility is

102
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:35,520
 going down all over the world at the moment, which it is. Wow. If men are exposed to Kappu,

103
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:40,800
 somehow the thing gets inside them and is already acting away inside their bodies.

104
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,720
 I hate the thought of it. It's like a little sort of French revolution for all your sperm.

105
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:50,080
 They're all being guillotine. Yeah, that's horrible. I don't have a cat and I have three kids and

106
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:56,720
 you've got a cat. You've got one kid. Well, that's, that is a data point. On the other hand,

107
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:03,360
 my child came maybe a year and a half after we got our cat. So with us, it didn't quite work out,

108
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:08,720
 but this is a thing about science. Our two tiny bits of data, that isn't science. You have to take

109
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:14,720
 in hundreds of thousands of bits of data. Yes. Agreed. Hence why my papers always get rejected.

110
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:23,360
 Excuse me, my mate James. I don't really think about something that's going wrong with scientific

111
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:30,320
 papers this year, which is so interesting. Basically, there is this phrase that is starting to turn up

112
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:37,920
 in papers, right? Vegetative electron microscopy. Okay. Well, I know what electron microscopy is.

113
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,160
 Right. I've done scanning tunneling electron microscopy at university.

114
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,920
 A few? Yeah. I've used a scanning tunneling microscope. It's another episode of the

115
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:51,200
 thousand lives of James Harkin. It is. I think that my lives are so less. I mean, the way

116
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:57,280
 we're interested with yours, Andy. But like, yeah, no, you can't say, oh, like, oh, my landscape is

117
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:03,440
 more mountainous than Norfolk. It's just like, it cares. Yeah. But compared to Dan, Dan has lived

118
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,960
 a billion lives. Dan's had an interesting life. Do you two both look, I just look up at both your

119
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:13,280
 lives and I'm really impressed. Anyway, okay, vegetative electron microscopy, your right James,

120
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:18,160
 it means nothing. It's not a meaningful phrase. Okay. But it has become what scientists are calling,

121
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:25,840
 a digital fossil. This is so cool. It's a mistake. There was a, there were some scientific papers

122
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:32,000
 printed in the 50s and 60s, which were written on columns, you know, like long tall columns of

123
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,960
 print. Yeah. And when these papers were being digitized, the two things got bolted onto each other.

124
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:41,120
 So the words are not next to each other in the original text, but the digitizing machine

125
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:46,560
 just bolted them together. This has now started turning up in lots of papers because it's somehow

126
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:51,840
 got into the knowledge base of AI models. And people are starting to use AI to generate science

127
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:58,320
 papers. And this is disastrous. You know, this is proof that there's real brain rot going on at the

128
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:03,120
 heart of lots of the AI models that are being used. And lots of science papers are being found,

129
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:09,440
 which contain phrases like, I am an AI model, or I am a large model. It breaks loose this year.

130
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,960
 Yeah. Oh, come on. First gonorrhea vaccine. Oh, what a treat. Finally.

131
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:17,120
 Good news. It's only got a performance rate of 30 or 40 percent. But that's better than nothing.

132
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:23,680
 I hate. Yeah. That's terrific. First successful bladder transplant. One has never been done

133
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:28,720
 until this year. Really? That's good. Really. And I think it's in China. Some scientists have

134
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,640
 invented contact lenses, which give you infrared vision and let you see things even if your

135
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:39,600
 eyes are closed. Now. That's cool. Is that what if you want to close your eyes because you don't want

136
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,360
 it like you're watching a scary movie. Yeah. And you think, Oh, I don't want to see what's happening

137
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,760
 here. So I close my eyes, but then you can still see it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

138
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:57,280
 You walk into your parrot's bedroom, but they're shagging. I want to give a quick shout out to

139
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:03,920
 an amazing person who passed away this year, an Australian called James Harrison. He was 88

140
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:09,840
 years old when he passed this year. And he is one of the most prolific blood donors that we've ever

141
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:15,520
 known. So he was known in Australia as the man with the golden arm. His blood contained a rare

142
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:21,760
 antibody, anti D, which is used in medication that's given to pregnant mothers and its blood plasma

143
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:27,680
 basically that he's handing over. Now he has been doing this since he was 18 years old, donating

144
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:34,080
 his blood every two weeks until he was 81 years old. Crazy. Yeah. You can't stick her every time.

145
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:41,920
 And a lollipop. And a lollipop is morbidly obese by the end. I talked about cats earlier. There's

146
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:48,960
 been some dog studies this year. The epidemiology and clinical management of acute diarrhea in dogs

147
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:55,360
 on the primary veterinary care in the UK was a study that I read. And it's very, very technical,

148
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:01,760
 lots of lists of dogs, lots of reasons why they get diarrhea, very complicated. But what I took out

149
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:07,600
 of it is that cockapoo's are 25% more likely to suffer from diarrhea than shit zoos. Brilliant.

150
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:14,000
 Why didn't put that as the headline? I don't know why they gave it that wordy thing. I feel like most

151
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,520
 science reports to just send you a quick email for the story breaks just for a quick rewrite on the

152
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:23,120
 headlines. The case is a dad joke. Yeah. Exactly.

153
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:35,680
 All right. It's time for fact number two. And that is Andy's fact. Okay. Here is my guest

154
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:42,320
 introducing him or herself. Yeah. See what you make of it. Okay. All them. All them. Right.

155
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:48,320
 Hi, fish. My name is Lee Durant. I'm a radio presenter in the late district. Can you guess what I

156
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:56,400
 did this year that made a few headlines? Okay. Very nice. So Lee Durant Lake district. He's got

157
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:02,800
 that DJ voice. He's got a great voice. Yeah. So like he's on the district radio. Okay. Yeah. Maybe he

158
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:10,160
 launched a load of Sabrina carpenter of CDs into the water. Oh, yes. That's what he did. Yeah.

159
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:15,840
 Submariner carpenter. Yeah. Take a drink. You've earned that. You earned that sip. Yeah.

160
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:22,720
 Okay. So is it related to music or it is related to music? He did something in the course of his

161
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:30,480
 job, which was okay. And but also related to the late district. Oh, okay. Interesting. Oh, no. What?

162
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,560
 I've just thought of something that's in the late district. Oh, yeah. Something that's very

163
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:39,520
 special to Andy's heart. Oh, is it anything to do with the pencil museum? I wish it were.

164
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:47,600
 Oh, it's not the Kessik pencil museum. Oh, okay. So is it related to people who are from there?

165
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:53,520
 So Wordsworth or... No, it's a modern thing. He's drawing attention to a problem in the late

166
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:58,000
 district. There is going on right now. There is a nuclear power plant up in Cumbria. He's very happy

167
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,440
 with that. Actually, no, I don't want to put words in his mouth. We have. We had a couple of

168
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,080
 chats. We didn't talk about everything in the district. Is it? Is it due with water pollution?

169
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:11,120
 Because we have a lot of problem with that in the UK. Yes, it is. Okay. Okay. Did he do a poo in

170
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:17,440
 late wind of air? Two. What's the goal of that? I didn't know whether he's pro or against.

171
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:25,120
 He's just pointing out it exists, guys. Well, shall I tell you what it is? Because I think you've

172
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:31,440
 got so close to that. Okay. I'm the presenter on late district radio who played a marathon 24 hour

173
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:38,880
 show of number two records to highlight the real number two problem, sewage in our lakes and waterways.

174
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:46,400
 Very good. How good is that? Very good. I love it. He did a dirty protest. He played 24 hours

175
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:51,600
 straight of number two songs. Great. It was so good. And so all songs that peaked at number two in

176
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:56,240
 the charts. And there is lots of sewage going into late wind of air and the utilities companies that

177
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,520
 you know, they pay their bosses a lot. In my chat with him, he said this phrase, which I've just

178
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:03,040
 absolutely loved. So what's more seconding, the fact that these water firms are paying themselves

179
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:07,760
 millions while failing to fix the sewage problem or that Oasis never got to number one due to

180
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:15,200
 Robson and Jerome. Oh, yeah. Unchain melody for Robson and Jerome, presumably. And don't know,

181
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:20,560
 just a very, very funny idea. Yeah, very good. Good for him. And has it solved the problem? Yep.

182
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:27,040
 I think it's embarrassed United utilities who do run the water up there. Unfortunately, number

183
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:31,280
 ones are also a problem if you put too much of them in the water. Very good point. Yes. Very

184
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:37,680
 good point. Wow. Amazing. That's the second marathon of songs that happened this year. One just

185
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:46,080
 happened with Alex Horn. Oh, yeah. They played one song on repeat for I think it was 24 hours as well.

186
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,000
 Which so I'm going off the top of my head here. So I can't quite remember. It was something

187
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,640
 apt. It was like, don't stop me singing. I love that. Yeah. But it was like that kind of like,

188
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:01,520
 yeah, and they had the guests non-stop flooding into sort of the version of it. Wow. Yeah. Those

189
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:06,720
 marathons are very, I was part of a marathon this year. Yeah. I mean, it only lasted for

190
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:16,400
 365 minutes, but it was the 31st anniversary of Agadu this year. Oh, yeah. By Black Lace. Yeah,

191
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:21,680
 exactly. So it says, do, do, do. Yeah. So you pushed a pineapple for 300 hours.

192
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:29,120
 No, to celebrate it, the crab museum guys who lived down where I live, they put the song on

193
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:35,600
 on 41 different devices and played them at the same time. And it was wild. It was a, it was a

194
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:40,800
 cacophony of sound because as well goes out of sync very quickly. Does it? Yeah. On different

195
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:45,440
 devices, you're at different bit rates, I think. And so it just slowly goes off. Anyway, nice. Let's

196
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:52,000
 get back to actual news. No, that's really good. So we're a couple of other sewagey protests this year.

197
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:58,160
 Oh, yeah. There was this month, actually, this December, there was a centres against sewage swim

198
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:05,200
 in Falmouth in Cornwall had to be called off. Can you guess why? Because all the reindeer's drowned.

199
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:13,280
 That's it. Too much sewage in the water for them to do a centres against sewage swim. This is the

200
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,640
 second year out of three. It's had to be cancelled due to the sheer volume of sewage in the water.

201
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:21,920
 Oh, no, bad. It is bad, bad, bad. Do they sort of hope it's going to be cancelled? Is that the whole

202
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:25,280
 point of it? Does that get the press? Is it annoying if they actually have to do the swim?

203
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,960
 I don't know. I think these people are all, you know, well, they're lacking Cornwall. They like

204
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,880
 that beat the swim surface swimming. So I think they probably are up for it. Yeah.

205
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:38,320
 There's been a big protest in France this year. Oh, isn't every year. Very, very strange for the

206
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:45,200
 French to cut up rough. Well, the kick enough about it's the most French protest. The length of

207
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:52,000
 Begette's has shot and that's the second most French protest. There's a campaign at the moment

208
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:59,760
 to raise the retirement age in France to the ungodly age of 64. And I can't stand the thought of that.

209
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:05,440
 What is it currently? I think it's 62 at the moment. Right. And every French president for the

210
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,520
 last 40 years has been saying, look, we really need to raise the retirement age just a bit to make

211
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:15,200
 the money add up. And every time they do it, people set fire to cars. Pretty much. Yeah. Absolutely.

212
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:20,080
 And a French group of artists this year, they launched a campaign encouraging the French

213
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,640
 to make up for the extra two years by being systematically late for work for the entire

214
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:30,000
 year they were really. They've put together an official calendar and you plug in your age.

215
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,560
 And it says, right, this is how late you need to be for work every single day of your life from now

216
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:39,280
 on in order to get those two years back. That's interesting because I was 10 minutes late for this

217
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:46,800
 today. Yeah. Just embracing my French side. I met a man who's in his 40s when I was living in

218
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:53,440
 Angulham in the South of France. And he told me another chapter, another chapter in the book of

219
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:58,880
 Dan. I honestly did not know that you used to live in Anglia. Yeah, just just for like it was like

220
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:03,760
 three months, four months, I was living with my grandmother. It's a long time. Yeah. That's a long time

221
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:08,400
 to live somewhere that we've never heard of in our 11 years making a week. If I had ever been to

222
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:14,080
 Angulham on holiday, you guys would know all about it. Was that like you opened that pitisserie

223
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:23,200
 that was based on Basel Basel? All the baked goods are the other side of an imaginary

224
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:31,280
 tale of glass. So no one can ever get me. I can grab. Yeah, this guy said that he was now on his

225
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:37,680
 pension because he worked in the army as which guy? The French man who was in his 40s who I met.

226
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:42,720
 Sorry. Yes. There was the bit connected to you. Yeah, you met a guy. I met a guy and he was retired.

227
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,680
 He had, he was on his French pension and it's because he was in the army and he was a parachuter,

228
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:53,600
 a paratrooper. And there was a little blip I guess in the in the wording which meant that if you

229
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:59,200
 done a number of jumps, you could retire and go into your pension. Okay. Right. So he did something

230
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,920
 like in the space of a year, something like 500 jumps. He literally got up, got in a plane,

231
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:08,240
 jumped out, got down, got back up and we just continuously do it. And now he's just living a life,

232
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:14,400
 just free on a pension in his 40s. That is amazing. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, the chance of one of the jumps

233
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:19,760
 going wrong is very low, but obviously the more you do. Yeah. And then presumably the idea of

234
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:25,760
 the government is if enough people die in jumps and they'll have less of a pension bill. That's

235
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:32,240
 possible. Yeah. The last hundred you have to do volcanoes over the mouths of snapping

236
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:39,200
 alligators. Yeah. There was a big problem in America this year with the budget, wasn't there?

237
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:45,760
 Do you remember that? No. So basically, the Republicans tried to pass a budget and the Democrats

238
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:52,720
 decided to put the whole country into lockdown, which, you know, every time the president tries to do

239
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,800
 that, the other side tries to do that. So it's not a Republican Democrat thing, it is just a thing.

240
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:03,200
 But in Charlotte, in North Carolina, they were trying to pass a budget and protestors stop the meeting

241
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:11,600
 by releasing an unknown number of crickets. That's an interesting way of stopping something because

242
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:18,080
 actually it causes an enormous amount of tumult, but crickets, you think that's just like silence and

243
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:23,280
 quietness, don't you? It's like a bad joke as crickets. Yes. But actually it caused an absolutely

244
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:27,760
 amazing amount of craziness because people were running around trying to get rid of these crickets.

245
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:31,280
 Not because they were very noisy. No, it wasn't. It was just that people don't.

246
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:35,680
 Have you ever watched I'm a celebrity get me out of here? No. Well, if you do watch that, you'll

247
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:40,480
 know that that's celebrities at least, but you can extend it to the general public. Don't like

248
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:45,040
 insects jumping on them. Yes. Celebrities on different in that respect. No. They're better than

249
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:52,880
 those in many respects. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's an unknown number is a good thing. That's

250
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:58,720
 like the old joke of you release five sheep somewhere, and you paint on their sides one, two, three,

251
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:04,080
 four, and six. Yeah. And then you can reduce the city to chaos for days as they try and find

252
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,680
 sheep number five, which doesn't exist. They all sleep every time they start looking for it.

253
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:13,200
 I got one more music thing to add. Seeing this was a musical protest fact that we've opened up with,

254
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,120
 which is that. So one of the other big things going on in the world right now is how people are

255
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:22,480
 responding to AI coming in and destroying human fields. In the creative arts, it's a big deal.

256
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:28,320
 And in music, it's been a big thing. So earlier this year, a thousand musicians got together to

257
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:36,720
 release an album called, is this what we want? Question mark. Oh, yeah. And it went to 38 in the album

258
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:42,640
 charts, and it was an entirely silent album. Oh, considering that's actually pretty good. Exactly.

259
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:48,240
 So like it included Kate Bush, Annie Lennox, Damon Alburn from Blur, Ed O'Brien from Radiohead,

260
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:54,160
 Dan Smith from Bastille. Did they all have to pay royalties to John Cage?

261
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:58,800
 Interestingly, I haven't heard whether or not that's the case. That's a really good question,

262
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:03,520
 but they all contributed bits of silence to it. I managed to track down one of the musicians

263
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:09,680
 to get an exclusive outtake from the album. Oh, wow. Yeah. So here we go. This is something that

264
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:15,840
 didn't make it to the album. Hello, no such thing as a fish. It's Dan Smith here for a band called

265
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:22,400
 Bastille. I wanted to send you an exclusive outtake from my contribution to, is this what we want

266
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:27,040
 the album from this year. This was my favourite bit, and I was pretty gutted that it didn't make the

267
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:31,920
 cut, but I'm just really happy to have the opportunity to share it with you now. So here we go.

268
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:44,080
 Wasn't that beautiful. Anyway, have a good show and have a great break. Bye.

269
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:50,480
 That's amazing. Yes, that was great. So that's, yeah. Bastille. That was an outtake from their

270
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,000
 contribution to this album, and it's, yeah, you can get it on vinyl. It's a pre-order right now

271
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,160
 if anyone's listening, but a very cool protest. Sorry for that. A very dangerous thing that's going

272
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:03,280
 on for a lot of artists. I did fight, okay, guys, I'm really sorry. I found something from, it's just,

273
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:10,080
 just over a year ago. I was going to put money on and bringing the 2024 story to the table.

274
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:14,960
 Last December, I'm so annoyed, this guy just missed this year, but it was a brilliant,

275
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,800
 windermere protest. That's all. Have you heard of the chain of supermarkets' booths?

276
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:24,160
 Oh, yeah. I used to live up there. So yeah, they're like the waitros of North Lancashire and

277
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:30,960
 Cumbria. Oh, wow. And that's their slogan, isn't it? Yeah. There was a guy called Michael Moody,

278
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:35,840
 who got a parking ticket. I believe in the booths in windermere, which is only as I bring it up,

279
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:40,640
 windermere in the Lake District, and he didn't pay it, because according to him, he didn't notice

280
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:45,200
 that he got the letters saying you've got a parking ticket. And then he got handed a county court

281
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,680
 judgment for not paying his parking ticket. And at that point, that meant that he could no longer

282
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:55,600
 get a mortgage. So he decided to launch a protest against booths of windermere. Okay. He traveled

283
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:01,200
 from his home in Skegness. Oh my god, that's a long way. Quite a way. Couple hundred miles. His

284
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:06,640
 like Skegness for non-British listeners is on the opposite coast of the UK. Yeah, he went to the

285
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:11,040
 car park of booths windermere. He went back to the scene of the crime or non-crime. Whatever.

286
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:16,800
 The alleged crime. Where he got the ticket, certainly. And he moved his entire living room into

287
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:24,400
 the car park, which was so far, some bookshelves, some coffee tables, his pet goldfish, that he just moved

288
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:30,000
 into a parking space. Wow. That booths windermere. What a hero. That's amazing. And what happened?

289
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,160
 It's having been able to find an update. So I suspect they've had him quietly taken care of.

290
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:37,200
 John Wilts Boots.

291
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:48,960
 Okay, it's time for our next fact. And that is James.

292
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:54,560
 Okay. Here is my voice note from someone that was sent to me just last night.

293
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:59,440
 Hi guys. My name is Shiva McCutchen. And this year I achieved something with the help of my three

294
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:04,800
 brothers. He did something with his three brothers. With his three brothers. And we are in the realm of

295
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:09,200
 sport. And I want to just say thank you so much to Shiva and for sending me that because he is

296
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:14,240
 really sick. Okay. He's got the illness that's going around at the moment. So he came out of his

297
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:18,960
 sick bed to record that. But yeah, and with three of his brothers, he did something this year.

298
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:24,240
 Three. So it requires four people. Okay, so I think it's and it's in the world of sport.

299
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:31,520
 Yeah. It's a four person sporting team. Actually, there are four of eight in the squad and five in the

300
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:37,600
 team. Uh, rowing. Very close. Oh, unbelievably close for a first guest. Right. Actually, I just think

301
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:44,240
 eight. Yeah, eight. Don't get me eight in sports. And so there's a, uh, is it, um, curling? No,

302
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,320
 further away. I mean, rowing was unbelievably close. So I don't know why I don't know why curling

303
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,920
 would be well, you were just close in the number. I thought curling. It's quite a big team. You've

304
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:56,320
 got the guy who throws the curl. You've got the go of the broom. You've got there's like, like,

305
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:02,080
 four people yelling from behind. Hard of, hard of brushing. Yeah. Okay. Thanks for the explanation

306
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:07,280
 of what curling is then. I think just saying rowing was close. Is it like yachting? Further away.

307
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:14,240
 Okay. It's our boat. It's on a small boat. Oh, small boats. Uh, sailing the English channel. Uh,

308
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:21,200
 it's small boat, small boat migration. Small boats. Uh, they're all in separate boats. Oh,

309
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:27,920
 they're all in separate boats. Is this one of those, uh, sort of historical reenactments where they're

310
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:35,520
 all sitting in tiny ships? It's like the battle of Trafalgar. Yeah, that's cool. I love that. I

311
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:41,520
 actually would worth us. I've watched the heck out of those. You've created a really good sport. I

312
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:46,960
 got to say, especially for the English and the British, like because we're going to go to the

313
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:52,400
 World Cup next year and probably won't win it. But I reckon then the annual Battle of Trafalgar

314
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:57,040
 competition. We're going to thrash them every year. In the bars. They'll be throwing pites everywhere.

315
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:04,480
 Sing a sweet Caroline. Okay. What are we saying? Small boats. It's canoe a kayak canoe canoe. Yeah.

316
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:15,360
 Uh, so they were four canoes in the team GB canoe polo team canoe polo that won bronze at the

317
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:24,720
 World Games this year. That's amazing. Polo. Absolutely. Wow. And so we won bronze this year and

318
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:31,200
 Shiven McCutcheon, Surian McCutcheon, Santana McCutcheon and Catec McCutcheon were all in the team

319
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:36,000
 together. Fantastic. That's so good. And were they, were they raised to be in boats?

320
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,280
 To eat. Well, did they, did they have a parent like the, you know, like the William sisters dad

321
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:49,520
 who just like from birth to be canoe polo? I think what it is is there are not so many canoe polo teams

322
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:55,120
 in the UK. Right. But there is one amazing one in Liverpool called Friends of Allenby. And they're

323
00:30:55,120 --> 00:31:03,680
 all part of this canoe polo team. And in total 13 of the canoe polo players from the male and females

324
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:10,240
 teams came from this one club. Just like they're all the, the Liverpool or the Arsenal of,

325
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:15,120
 yeah, of canoe polo. And you're going to have a, obviously, a variety of ages between them. So

326
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:20,320
 begs the question, what is an ideal age to be a canoe poloist? Yeah, they're all in the 20s, I think.

327
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:26,240
 Apologies. Apologies if any of them in their late teens are early 30s, but yeah, they're all about

328
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:31,520
 that age. And this was the World Games, which is, it's like the Olympic Games, but it's for sports

329
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:37,120
 that are not in the Olympics. I read that it, I'd never heard of it before. And I found a list of

330
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:41,360
 sports that are in there, which are not sports, I know, well, at all. I don't know anything about

331
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:47,440
 fin swimming. Yeah. I don't know anything about fistball. Fistball. And so, right, fistball is like

332
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:54,320
 volleyball, but the balls allowed to bounce. Oh, okay. And the amazing thing about fistball is it was

333
00:31:54,320 --> 00:32:02,560
 written about in 1786 by friend of the podcast, Johan Wolfgang von Gerther. Oh, he wrote about going

334
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:08,320
 to a fistball game between four noblemen from Verona and four Venetians. Right. It's amazing.

335
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:14,320
 Snooker is in the World Games, because it's not in the Olympics. Yeah. Right. And Snooker was won by

336
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:20,640
 Xiao Gu Dong, who is the world's number eight snooker player. And with the greatest respect to all

337
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:26,320
 the other players, he was the only professional there. Right. So he was like, he really wanted to

338
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:32,080
 compete and win a medal for China, because he's very patriotic. But he is, at the time, he was the

339
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:38,720
 eight best player in the world. And everyone else was at aperture. Can you imagine that?

340
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:43,600
 Yeah. In fact, he actually lost one of his group games, but yeah, he basically smashed everyone,

341
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:51,360
 because he is one of the world's best. So yeah. So congratulations to Shiven. Let me play in

342
00:32:51,360 --> 00:33:00,720
 the reveal. Oh, yeah. The answer is we're part of the British canoe follow team who won bronze

343
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:05,120
 at this year's World Games in Chengdu. Yeah, we know that, mate. And of course, just wants to say

344
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:10,400
 Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to Dan and D James and everyone tuning in to the fun.

345
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:15,440
 I thought you feel bad. He said, "Have Merry Christmas to us." Yep. Got him prematurely.

346
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:20,640
 I apologise to all the brothers. That's really cool. Thanks for sending us that. That's amazing.

347
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,440
 Yeah. It's really cool. You never heard of that game. Do you think it's going to make

348
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:27,120
 its way to the Olympics one day? I'd love it too. I think it's quite exciting. I've seen

349
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:32,400
 some videos of it. It's really cool. It does sound good. There is another, this isn't a proper

350
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:37,520
 campaign running at the moment, but I did read a piece recently about paintball players who

351
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:45,120
 are campaigning for it to be eventually an Olympic sport. I can see that. Yeah. It's a fun game.

352
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:50,000
 I think it would be fun for spectators. Yeah. I mean, it's fun to do for sure, but it's not even

353
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,240
 recognised as a sport yet. I think so. That's probably the first. That's probably the first hurdle to

354
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:58,400
 clear before you get into the Olympics. It would be remarkable if it went straight from not a

355
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:06,400
 spot to end the Olympics. Here is a cool thing that has been revealed. There are a lot of

356
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:15,120
 track and field records being broken. Yeah. Because a lot of them have stagnated for decades.

357
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:20,320
 Because basically everyone took drugs. Right. And we didn't know about it. And now people are taking

358
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:24,640
 fewer drugs or less good drugs and they can't beat the records anymore. But there is a thing you

359
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:31,440
 can take, which helps you run a bit faster. Interesting. Consistently helps you run a bit faster.

360
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:37,040
 All athletes are taking it now. All athletes are taking it. Yeah. And it makes you run faster.

361
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:41,440
 You'll both have some in your pantry, I'm going to say. I don't have a pantry. But let's say,

362
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:47,600
 is it kind of, is it like nutmeg? You would use it in your, it's in your baking cupboard.

363
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:53,120
 Oh, baking cupboard. Yeah. Learning a lot about Andy's kitchen here. He's got a pantry of baking

364
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:57,200
 cupboard. Turn left after the second pantry and that's the baking cupboard. I'll ask the bottle

365
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:04,640
 letter of a tree for you. Wheel the cheese for a driver to one side. Okay. What would be in your

366
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:11,760
 baking cupboard? Is it baking soda? It's baking soda. Is it really? What a disappointment short quiz

367
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:17,520
 that was. I was gearing up for at a very enjoyable half hour there. No, it's baking soda.

368
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:22,560
 This is so bizarre. Basically, it seems to act as a buffer against increased acid build-up

369
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:28,240
 in muscles. It's legal. And they've developed ways of giving it to you. It probably doesn't

370
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:34,160
 work if you take it in a cake, unfortunately. Yeah. All the athletes are scoffing a quick

371
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:38,560
 quick bit of chocolate punch cake at the starting line. It's very sadly. That's not it.

372
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:43,040
 But there were some of that because we had an Olympics last year, didn't we?

373
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:48,000
 And the winter Olympics is about to happen. Okay, because there were some events last summer where

374
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:53,680
 almost all finalists were taking baking soda. Right. Is that legal? Is not how do they take it?

375
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:58,880
 Is it? It's in some sort of boring gel, right? Yeah. Again, don't just go scoffing baking soda

376
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:05,360
 from your pantry. Yeah. The baking soda challenge. Don't do it, guys. Yeah, it's been put in some

377
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:11,280
 complicated thing by some nerds. That's very cool. Do you remember this year when Donald Trump won

378
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:16,080
 the FIFA Peace Prize? Ah, of course. How good would we forget? I was praying for it for so many

379
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:22,080
 months that it came true and I just couldn't believe it. He also won the FIFA Club World Cup.

380
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:27,040
 He's a soccer competition. Oh, yeah. Come on. This guy's not running.

381
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:34,960
 So most people like the fake news think the Chelsea won it. And sure enough, they did win

382
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:40,560
 the final. But it was in New Jersey that it took place. No. And Donald Trump was at the final.

383
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:48,080
 And the head of FIFA in Fantino, he went to the White House and showed Donald Trump the actual

384
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:53,360
 trophy and said, oh, you can look after this for a while. And then according to Donald Trump's

385
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:59,360
 account, he said, when are you going to pick up the trophy, Gianni? And in Fantino said, oh, no,

386
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:04,320
 we're never going to pick it up. You can have it forever. And we're making a new one. So Chelsea got

387
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:11,920
 the replica and the winner of the actual club World Cup was Donald Trump. Oh, my God. He's still got

388
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:19,040
 it. He's still got it. What? There was an amazing thing after that final that all the players of

389
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:23,600
 Chelsea who have stood there waiting to receive their replica trophy and their fireworks are going to

390
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:27,360
 go. What do they get? What age? No, they'll get a medal and stuff. Okay. Okay. And then they give

391
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:32,240
 them the trophy and then they hold it up in the crowd go wild. But Donald Trump was on the stage

392
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:38,160
 sort of handing out the medals, but they're never left. Like all the other dignitaries left the stage

393
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:43,680
 and he just kind of stood there. And there's an amazing video of Cole Palmer, the England footballer

394
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:49,520
 who is an amazing footballer, but perhaps didn't probably even know who Donald Trump was. Just kind

395
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:57,360
 of by tonight. I'm going to use this guy. It's amazing. That's amazing. There's a Spanish football club

396
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:03,840
 called Leganes and they you know how football clubs they have the jerseys that you buy and they

397
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:09,760
 have advertising. So they have advertising where your tummy is. Sometimes they have advertising

398
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:17,440
 on where your shoulder is. But this team had advertising where your groin is. So right in the middle

399
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:23,280
 of the shorts, they had a little advert. Can you guess what the advert was for? Safe sex or some

400
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:30,000
 contraception stuff. Yeah. You got to read a jab. It was for the testicular cancer society.

401
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:36,880
 Very good. It was a bit of advertising to bring up awareness for that, but also to teach people

402
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:41,360
 how to self-check for testicular cancer. That's very good. That's very good.

403
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:46,480
 James, does any team ever, this is just a little idea I've had, put advertising on the inside of the

404
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:51,440
 shirt? Okay. What would be the point of that? Because when you score a goal and you pull your

405
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:57,040
 shirt off over your head, it reveals your secret sponsor. That's really good. That's a good idea, right?

406
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:02,560
 It's a really good idea. People will wear undershirts with a message written on it. So when they

407
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,680
 lift the shirt, the message is shown. I think you're not allowed to do that. I think you've got

408
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:12,560
 the yellow card to do that. There was a boxer once who the sun advertised the souls of his feet

409
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:17,920
 because they were so sure he was going to get knocked out when he landed the camera would go

410
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:22,720
 on to the souls of the feet. Really good. It was someone against Mike Tyson. I can't remember who it was.

411
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:30,000
 Such optimistic ways of seeing light, isn't it? That's really good. Guys, I actually, when I was trying

412
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:35,600
 to find a new story from the year, I actually contacted someone else and at the last minute,

413
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:42,560
 they have sent me a question for us to do with sports. Okay. So can we? Yeah. Here we go. So.

414
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:48,240
 Hello, no such thing as a fish. My name is Jeremy Derli. And this year in a competition that was

415
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:55,200
 broadcast live from Las Vegas on ESPN, I became a world champion. My question for you is, what am I

416
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:59,840
 now the world champion of? I've got a guess which I think might be right. So. Oh, yeah.

417
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:08,880
 What was the name of your correspondent did? Deer emerged early. Okay. Las Vegas, it was out on

418
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:16,240
 ESPN. Not a gambling thing. Not a gambling, but not strictly a sport sport, rather an e-sport.

419
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:21,840
 An e-sport. So something to do with computers. Or Yorkshire. Or ecstasy.

420
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:29,040
 Well, we've talked before about sort of fun things like Microsoft Excel. Yeah. Being sport,

421
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:33,680
 is it that? Well, let's, do you want to ask? That would be my guess as well.

422
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:43,520
 That's the end. We're really good out of this balloon. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Let's see what it is.

423
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:49,680
 Imagine if it's conspiracy. The answer is that after an intense competition over three days

424
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:54,960
 among some of the world's best spreadsheeters, I was crowned this year's Microsoft Excel World

425
00:40:54,960 --> 00:41:01,120
 Champion. Fantastic. That's really right. To be honest, like you're not going to say, hi,

426
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:07,440
 my name's Lionel Messi. Guess which sport I played this year. Hi, my name's Roger Federer. I guess what,

427
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:12,880
 he's such a big name in this podcast. We're just going to know that. Yeah. Yeah. This is his first

428
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:18,960
 world championship within the Microsoft Excel competition. Yeah. He faced off against Andrew Nye,

429
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:25,760
 who has won it three times. So he took the win. Wow. And I mean, it's a pretty amazing competition.

430
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:30,720
 They get jumbled data, basically. And in some cases, they have to make the data, make a famous

431
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:34,960
 painting. So they have to place all the things in the right places to reveal a painting.

432
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:40,640
 The one that was done this year was inspired by origami. So players had to use their knowledge

433
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:46,800
 of the software to complete 130 questions that was spread across seven levels. And the theme of it

434
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:58,080
 was origami. Amazing. Okay. We would usually do a final fact of the show. There's always usually four,

435
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:03,760
 but as there's only three of us, we're going to head straight into. Yeah. Wait. What? There is another.

436
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:10,320
 What are you on about? I got an extra person. Oh. Did you? Yeah. Yeah. I sent out a couple of liars

437
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:15,760
 popping around on the water. And I got two bites. A couple of reels. And a second person replied.

438
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:21,360
 Can I just play you one last person? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's such a great response. Hi, my name is

439
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:26,320
 just von Rossum. I'm a Dutch typeface designer. I was in the news this year because it looks like I

440
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:32,480
 was the victim of a crime. But can you guess why? Okay. So he's a typeface designer. Yeah.

441
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:42,800
 Did he put the word? He did some work for the S. A. S. A big sign. But his A looks so much like an

442
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:48,960
 O that it looked like it read SOS. And they thought he was in trouble. That's really good. That's

443
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:54,320
 really good. It's not that. No. So he is a Dutch typeface designer. Is a typeface part important?

444
00:42:54,320 --> 00:43:00,160
 Yes. Is it? So was the name that he was a victim of is related to his work? So is the typeface name

445
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:08,640
 itself something like murdered? Oh, that's very nice. I'm going to say something to you guys a

446
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:15,120
 little extra clue. Yeah. What's a classic bit of dance stand up, James? Oh, gosh. I mean, there are so

447
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:22,880
 many. There's so many that's related to typos and typefaces. I can't remember any of your standards.

448
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:27,840
 The bit where you went on so many different typeface gags that I have. Well, he would wear a fake

449
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:32,320
 nose and glasses and mustache and take them off and have the same thing. That was pretty good.

450
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:37,360
 What about when he was caught blocked from out of space by that astronaut? That was a great bit.

451
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:44,400
 Oh, yes. Yes. That's how it feels. Yeah. It's a thing. Is it the time when he was with a woman and

452
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:52,000
 she said, take off your trousers and his legs were so hairy that he already had taken off his trousers.

453
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:59,760
 I'm so I was so tempted right now to subtly put out the fact that I am on tour next year with a show.

454
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:03,680
 But this is not doing any favors for that. What's that? That is on Tardex here. Yeah.

455
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:08,800
 Well, how do you forget tickets? Well tickets are going to be allocated by a sort of like it's

456
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:15,440
 like going to be jury-duty. You'll just get the call. You have to do it. You do have to do it.

457
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:21,280
 Unless you've got an amazing reason. They're not inhuman. They will let you off. You're really

458
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:27,520
 on what else. No, it's called this changes everything. It's going to be in March and April. Tickets

459
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:32,400
 are on sale now, by the way, guys. If anyone wants to come, London, Brighton, all sorts of places. Yeah.

460
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:39,040
 Yeah. Anyway, is your quiz that if it's still a dance show that he's doing is to do with a very famous

461
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:46,000
 advert? Oh, you want to steal a card? Ding, ding, ding. Yes. You want to hear us. Yeah.

462
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:52,160
 Just Van Rossum says I designed a font called FF Confidential. This year, an investigation

463
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:57,440
 found that the font seems to have been pirated and used in a very famous effort saying you wouldn't

464
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:04,880
 steal a car. So good. Wow. This is like level zero of the podcast. This is friend of the podcast

465
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:12,720
 from the get go. So just designed that font. Yeah. Which an investigation this year found had been

466
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:18,160
 nicked because the font used in that advert is identical to the font he designed and they did a little

467
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:24,160
 bit of kind of DNA testing on the font in the advert. And is that font incredible? I'm starstruck.

468
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:30,480
 You are so excited. I was so excited to hear that. Very good. Oh, well, thank you. Thank you, Andy.

469
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:36,160
 But hey, guys, we now need to get to an exciting little festive bit of the show. James Andy and I

470
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:41,520
 never get to be around the Christmas tree every year, which is a huge shame. What do you mean?

471
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:47,280
 As if we all go and see our families instead of spending time together. Yeah. Yeah. Which is a huge

472
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:52,320
 disappointment every year for me. So what we thought we'd do is we'd end this week's episode

473
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:58,160
 as it's Christmas by giving each other a present. And so we've got them in front of us here. We've all

474
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:02,640
 bought each other a present. Get my note. Let me get mine out. Dan's done a really nice wrapping

475
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:10,000
 job on his and a label and everything. And mine looks a bit crummy. I'd look like a field bit of evidence.

476
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:17,200
 Yeah. Oh, James has got a magicians. Oh, wait, wait, wait. Okay. This is all prep. I'll close my

477
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:21,120
 eyes. The bad news for you. I've had that operation where I could see through my eyes.

478
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:26,640
 So James is bought a present for me. I bought a present for Andy. And Andy is bought a present

479
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:31,920
 for James. So let's do it. James, do you want to start? I got first. So this is for you, Dan.

480
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:37,120
 Your present is in this bag. Okay. Should I feel? Yeah, feel it. No. There's nothing in there.

481
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:42,720
 Oh, well, maybe there will be something in there. Let me see what I can find in there.

482
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:50,560
 That's my magic wand. It's not that. Let me just do what else is in there. Oh,

483
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:55,360
 well, that's mine and Anna's book. It's definitely not that. Everything to play for, by the way.

484
00:46:55,360 --> 00:47:00,960
 Oh, that's I don't know what that is going on here. This is brilliant. This is here it is. Here it is.

485
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:09,520
 It's as card signed by Jesse Eisenberg from the now you're seeing me face. You're kidding. There you go.

486
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:19,280
 Oh, my goodness. The best film franchise ever. Yeah. Wow. Oh, wow. It's amazing. I did find it. It's

487
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:25,920
 very, very rare. If you go on eBay, there's only about 500 of them. Right. He makes a lot more off the

488
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:30,720
 side cars. Certainly, then he does off the movies. Yeah. Yeah. How exciting. Thank you very much. This has

489
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:36,240
 been the surprise movie hit of the year for the podcast. Now you've seen it has become a friend of

490
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:41,520
 the podcast. I'm the only one who hasn't seen. No, I haven't. No, I haven't seen it now.

491
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:48,880
 I haven't seen the third one, which is out now, but isn't there a character in it called

492
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:56,880
 Shriver? There is. Yeah. They have to call to London for some creative person. Right. I won't give

493
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:02,800
 too much away, but they're like, get Shriver on the phone right now. There you go. Netflix has seen

494
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:09,360
 Shriver to any creative people. What's that? Your friends James and Andy. They sound perfect.

495
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:16,400
 Beautiful. Thank you so much. That's a very thoughtful present because I do. I do love that

496
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:21,360
 maybe. Should we go around this way? Yeah, sure. Okay. This is for you. Thank you very much.

497
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:28,080
 A label there. Andy, love Dan. They're three kisses. Yeah. So nice. My son wrote that. Okay.

498
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:34,960
 Could be anything. Could at this stage. At this stage. And it's rap state. It could be anything.

499
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:39,280
 Bookshaped. Interesting. But it's a bit yielding, but that might just be the wrapping paper.

500
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:48,720
 Just doing a bit of Foley. Let me do this. And what is it? It's oh my god. It's a copy of

501
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:56,240
 Lenby Del's book too long in the bush. First edition hardback. First edition hardback.

502
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:59,840
 First edition hardback. You don't have that kind of money. I know. I know. Finale is furious.

503
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:06,080
 Can I too long in the bush? Is the story extending over three years of how the author made the

504
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:13,120
 first road ever to cross central Australia. Oh my gosh. To west. Wow. Just one extra detail is

505
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:20,960
 that it is a signed copy. Beautiful. Beautiful writing. Lovely handwriting. It's stunning,

506
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:25,520
 handwriting. For a man who built roads. Yeah. He's got the calligraphy on him. Yeah. He's just a

507
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:30,960
 multi-talented guy. I'm so chuffed. Thank you. And just in case Mel Bracewell's listening,

508
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:36,080
 can you explain who Lenby Del is? Lenby Del was responsible for building huge numbers of

509
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:43,040
 Australia's roads. As it says here, he's made 4,000 miles of lonely roads across central Australia.

510
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:48,960
 What a legend. Look, I really can't cap that. James, I hope you like this. It's a better

511
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:55,600
 be good now. It's nowhere near as good as a Lenby Del book, but signed. I know. I thought Jesse

512
00:49:55,600 --> 00:50:05,040
 Eisenberg. No kisses on this. It says to my valued colleague with the steam, your colleague,

513
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:13,920
 Andy. I'm sorry, I got a bit mushy. I shouldn't have done that. I'm welling up. And it's so beautifully

514
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:21,840
 wrapped. So your note was written by your child. It's wrapped by your child, Andy. It's a very

515
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:26,400
 difficult thing to wrap, isn't it? Look at it. It's an awkward shape. But I thought, what does James

516
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:32,160
 like? James likes a sport. I have, I'm a one-dimensional character, as we've said. But I think this has

517
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:41,200
 got two dimensions of this gift. It's a Trammeer Elvis golf balls. It's my favourite football team

518
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:46,000
 and my favourite sport together at last. Wow. You've ripped off the price, which, you know,

519
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:54,640
 which was astronomical. Those people are Trammeer outrageous. So it's got balls. Yeah, it's got a

520
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:59,280
 logo on it. Right, exactly. It's got teas with Trammeer Elvis written on them. And there's a third

521
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:04,400
 thing I don't know what it is. What is on the back? It's a little fork. Okay, can you guess what that's

522
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:09,760
 far? It's a little fork. It's a little fork. Molly said it was for marking your balls, which I just

523
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:15,200
 don't think can be right. I'm sorry to say Molly's wrong, but she's not far off. Is it a little

524
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:22,080
 bookmark, Randy, to read while you're playing the game? I'll be just sitting in the cart. I'll chance

525
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:29,600
 get out. Is it something to go on your top pocket to say, ladies, I am available in the 19th hole?

526
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:35,920
 Well, it is. If you have golf clubs, they have to be, like, it's really perfect metal and they're

527
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:41,200
 the right length and the right size. And if you flick them like that, they make a little noise.

528
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:49,760
 And this is like a little tuning for you. Thank it. And it has to know. I was in. I was in. When the ball lands

529
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:54,400
 in the ground, it can make a little indentation. And this you kind of flatten it so that next person

530
00:51:54,400 --> 00:52:00,080
 who comes along doesn't, that ball doesn't bubble around. Is that so? Yeah, yeah. I had no idea. Wow.

531
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:06,480
 It's invaluable, Andy. Thank you so much. I'm very happy with my gift. And I actually will use

532
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:12,720
 these for sure. Great. I'll actually read that and Dan will be playing with his cards. Stop again.

533
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:20,640
 All right, look, well, we hope that you also got amazing presents this year. Had a great Christmas.

534
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:25,840
 We're going to be back again next year with more guests joining us and is going to be back in the

535
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:41,760
 late spring. It's going to be an exciting, exciting 2026 for fish. And we will see you then. Good bye.

536
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:51,760
