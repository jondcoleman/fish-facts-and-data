00:00:04,00:00:09,"Hi everyone, Merry Christmas and welcome to this episode of No Such Thing as a Fish."
00:00:09,00:00:14,"We have something very special for you today. It is our Christmas special. Well, it's kind of a"
00:00:14,00:00:20,20-25 special. We've looked at this entire year and we found our favorite news stories. Do you
00:00:20,00:00:25,"remember when we used to do our own TV show called No Such Things and News? Well, this is a kind of"
00:00:25,00:00:29,version of that where we don't have to do makeup. I don't have to sit in front of the camera.
00:00:29,00:00:32,I really hope you enjoy it. I really hope you had a great Christmas. I know not everyone
00:00:32,00:00:37,"has a great time this time of year, but if you didn't, I hope you can kind of just turn off"
00:00:37,00:00:42,for the next hour and listen to us. Be really silly. If you'd like some more fish in your life perhaps
00:00:42,00:00:48,"to help that time between Christmas and New Year go very, very quickly, then the place to go is"
00:00:48,00:00:54,definitely Patreon. It's patreon.com/no Such Thing as a Fish and there you can find everything about
00:00:54,00:01:00,"club fish, all of that extra content that you can get with all of our different tiers. Not only will"
00:01:00,00:01:06,"you get lots of extra stuff, but you will be helping to support the podcast. So do go there. If you fancy"
00:01:06,00:01:11,"it, if not, then please stay here and listen to the podcast, which is free and which will always"
00:01:11,00:01:30,"be free. Okay, I'll be the podcast."
00:01:30,00:01:37,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a very special Boxing Day edition."
00:01:37,00:01:41,I hope you had a great Christmas. I hope you got all the presents you wanted and here's an extra
00:01:41,00:01:46,"present for you, a sort of different No Such Thing as a Fish today because we are going to be going"
00:01:46,00:01:50,"through not our favorite facts from the last seven days, but our favorite bits of news from the last"
00:01:50,00:01:58,"365 days. We are now presenting the podcast of the year in sort of tribute to our books,"
00:01:58,00:02:03,The Book of the Year and our TV show No Such Thing as the News. So this is the podcast of the book
00:02:03,00:02:09,of the TV show of the podcast of the podcast of the TV show because it came from QI.
00:02:09,00:02:15,Yeah. So this is the podcast of the book of the TV show of the podcast of the TV show and in no
00:02:15,00:02:22,"particular order, here we go. It's like the Blade Runner of podcasts. Yeah. So we're actually doing"
00:02:22,00:02:26,"something different today because as well as finding our favorite news stories, we have actually"
00:02:26,00:02:31,tracked down characters from the news to tell us their story. And so I'm going to go first. I'm going
00:02:31,00:02:37,"to play a little bit of audio now and James and Andy, let's see if you can work out who this is"
00:02:37,00:02:41,from the news this year. Okay. I know such thing as a fish. This is Maryl Burnett from the department
00:02:41,00:02:46,"of psychological and brain sciences at the University of Massachusetts and most. This year,"
00:02:46,00:02:51,"along with my co-writer Paul Silvia, I published a scientific paper that set out to answer a very"
00:02:51,00:02:57,"important question. So what do you think that question was? Oh, okay, quite vague. Quite vague."
00:02:57,00:03:05,"University of Massachusetts, so Boston, perhaps. Yep. Some to do with the tea party. Oh,"
00:03:05,00:03:09,so do the New England Patriots for the team? How many sugars were there in the Boston
00:03:09,00:03:17,"tea party? How many sandwiches? Yeah. No, we're nowhere near close. And yes, it is so vague that"
00:03:17,00:03:21,"it's going to be virtually impossible to get. Well, no, Dan's interests. Yeah, via to the"
00:03:21,00:03:28,"cryptid. His wife. There's no way of talking about vanilla. Sorry, I didn't hear what you said"
00:03:28,00:03:35,"initially. The cryptid. Oh, sorry, yeah. Harry, mythical and terrifying beast. Vanilla is much"
00:03:35,00:03:41,"loved by everyone. That's such thing as fish. I think God, she doesn't listen to our show."
00:03:41,00:03:47,"So is it they've discovered why people believe for this rubbish? No, it's not to do with, it's not"
00:03:47,00:03:53,"to do with that sort of weird world. Psychologist, did she say? Yeah. So it's something to do with the way"
00:03:53,00:04:01,that people act. Maybe why we cry? Why we cry in public? Why I cry in public? Why we kiss? That's been
00:04:01,00:04:06,"the study this year. That has been a study. Well, because it's good for podcast team unity. It's"
00:04:06,00:04:13,just stops you crying. I think it's relevant to what ends up happening a lot on this show when we
00:04:13,00:04:19,"tedious arguments about minor points of information. But now jokes. Oh, now we're getting into"
00:04:19,00:04:24,the zone. Bad jokes. It's not bad jokes. Let me give you the answer. Here's the answer from
00:04:24,00:04:30,"Maryl Burnett. The question we asked was what's brown and sticky? And the answer, of course, is a stick."
00:04:30,00:04:34,"Actually, that was just the title of the paper. The thing we really wanted to know is who finds"
00:04:34,00:04:39,"dad jokes funny. And after collecting over 32,000 jokes and putting them to a group of volunteers,"
00:04:39,00:04:45,we found our answer. And so my fact for your podcast of the year is this. The people who find
00:04:45,00:04:52,"dad jokes the funniest are, in fact, dads. Oh, well, I beg to differ. My daughter fives by jokes hilarious."
00:04:52,00:05:00,"I agree with you. If our kids were involved in this, now this is Maryl Burnett. And she wrote a paper"
00:05:00,00:05:05,"this year called What's Brown and Sticky peering into the electable comedic mystery of dad humor,"
00:05:05,00:05:10,"with a handful of machine learning models, hundreds of humans, and tens of thousands of dad jokes."
00:05:10,00:05:16,"And so they collected 32,000 different dad jokes, which can all now be found on one PDF online,"
00:05:16,00:05:21,"by the way, if anyone wants to get their hands on that. So they came out with multiple different"
00:05:21,00:05:27,"conclusions, but the main one being that dads definitely found the dad jokes the funniest of any group."
00:05:27,00:05:30,I think that makes sense because you wouldn't tell the joke if you didn't think it was funny.
00:05:30,00:05:34,Yes. So you automatically think it's funny when you say it.
00:05:34,00:05:40,"I'm not sure I always do. I'm just trying to get a laugh. And I'm pretty dead behind the eyes,"
00:05:40,00:05:43,"you know, what I'm telling any joke, actually. Are we talking about, yeah, we're not talking about"
00:05:43,00:05:48,"dad jokes here, are we? We're talking about your stand-up set. Just anything I do. Yeah. I'm trying"
00:05:48,00:05:53,"to get a laugh, but that's the only calculation I make is for the audience laugh. Okay, fair enough."
00:05:53,00:05:58,"And they often don't. Interesting, because I'm so self-centred, all I care about is whether I find it"
00:05:58,00:06:04,"funny or not. But this says a lot about us. Yeah, yeah. What about Dan? You just do long"
00:06:04,00:06:11,"stuatly style monobugs to your kids, don't you? They don't usually hear the end of the punchline"
00:06:11,00:06:15,"because they're gone to school by that time. Surely, there is no punchline. That's where means"
00:06:15,00:06:22,"to it slightly, right? I try to swing a punchline in about the 25-minute mark. Yeah, it's an interesting"
00:06:22,00:06:27,"study. I asked her actually, by the way, about what her least favorite dad joke was because, you know,"
00:06:27,00:06:32,she must have her favorites and her the ones she doesn't like. She said these are the two. It's a tie.
00:06:32,00:06:39,"Why is a fish my best friend? Because he's with me single swim. Oh, really good. It's really nice."
00:06:39,00:06:45,"Yeah, I don't know. He always keeps it real with me. Now, she hates that because she says,"
00:06:45,00:06:51,"real is obviously a fishing term and real sounds like real, which would make it keep it real,"
00:06:51,00:06:56,"a proper sentence, but keeps it real makes no sense. She just hates the logic that that doesn't apply."
00:06:56,00:07:01,Is it real? What does that mean? Keeps a real. Keeps it real. Keeps itself on the end of the real.
00:07:01,00:07:06,"Yeah, yeah. I see what you mean. Doesn't work. So she hates it for the lack of logic. She says,"
00:07:06,00:07:12,"contrast this with justice is a dish best served cold. If it were served warm, it would be called"
00:07:12,00:07:18,"just water. Because it's just ice. Yeah, certainly. That works better in the Boston accent."
00:07:18,00:07:22,"And it works as well, I think, as a sentence, rather than as a spoken out thing. I actually think the"
00:07:22,00:07:27,"first one isn't a dad joke. To me, a dad joke is something you say repeatedly whenever something"
00:07:27,00:07:32,"happens. Yes. Like if your kid says, I'm thirsty, you say, hello, first day, I'm Friday. Yes."
00:07:32,00:07:37,"And this is my friend, Robin, it's a true. So like, and but they do it all the time. Every single time."
00:07:37,00:07:44,"Or like Anna's mum, who whenever Anna said, can you turn on the lights, she would go over and start"
00:07:44,00:07:49,flirting with lights. I think that is a proper dad joke. That's proper dad joke. And I don't think
00:07:49,00:07:55,a bad joke is a dad joke personally. I say one. Yeah. Yeah. That's a good point. I say a dad joke
00:07:55,00:07:59,"virtually every day in our house, which is the same one. It's the same one. At the end of the day,"
00:07:59,00:08:04,"finale will say, can you draw the curtains? And I always say, well, I'd love to, but I don't have a pen."
00:08:04,00:08:12,"The kids got to bed hours ago. Jesus, I'm paging across the Tibetan Highlands."
00:08:12,00:08:20,"So anyway, thank you so much, Maryl Burnett. Yeah, great work. But this brings us into the world of"
00:08:20,00:08:24,"science, science news. Yeah, do you know there was a study this year that found"
00:08:24,00:08:30,"that Kappu might be the cause of the decline of fertility around the world? Okay, so more people"
00:08:30,00:08:36,"have cats. More cats means more Kappu. Yeah. Kappu is horrible. Yeah. The more you're exposed to Kappu,"
00:08:36,00:08:41,"the less likely you are to think, I'm in the mood for love. Actually, didn't we say in one of our"
00:08:41,00:08:46,earlier podcasts that the more disgusted you are? Or the more aroused you are. That's just the
00:08:46,00:08:49,"opposite the other way around. I can't remember. It's the more aroused you are, the more you're willing"
00:08:49,00:08:54,"to do disgusting things. Okay, so maybe it's like every time someone gets a bit hardy, instead of"
00:08:54,00:08:59,"having sex and having children, they go and take the Kappu out. Yes, yes, exactly."
00:08:59,00:09:06,"Now what this is, is it's toxoplasma gondii, which is a parasite that you find in Kappu."
00:09:06,00:09:10,"There's been studies about this for a while, like if they give it to mice, it makes them more brave"
00:09:10,00:09:16,"and stuff like that. Yes, yeah. But they found this year that if you put human sperm in Kappu,"
00:09:16,00:09:23,then the sperm gets decapitated. It's okay. And so they wonder if there might be something in the Kappu
00:09:23,00:09:30,that could be a natural spermicide. And that could be the cause for the fact that male fertility is
00:09:30,00:09:35,"going down all over the world at the moment, which it is. Wow. If men are exposed to Kappu,"
00:09:35,00:09:40,somehow the thing gets inside them and is already acting away inside their bodies.
00:09:40,00:09:44,I hate the thought of it. It's like a little sort of French revolution for all your sperm.
00:09:44,00:09:50,"They're all being guillotine. Yeah, that's horrible. I don't have a cat and I have three kids and"
00:09:50,00:09:56,"you've got a cat. You've got one kid. Well, that's, that is a data point. On the other hand,"
00:09:56,00:10:03,"my child came maybe a year and a half after we got our cat. So with us, it didn't quite work out,"
00:10:03,00:10:08,"but this is a thing about science. Our two tiny bits of data, that isn't science. You have to take"
00:10:08,00:10:14,in hundreds of thousands of bits of data. Yes. Agreed. Hence why my papers always get rejected.
00:10:15,00:10:23,"Excuse me, my mate James. I don't really think about something that's going wrong with scientific"
00:10:23,00:10:30,"papers this year, which is so interesting. Basically, there is this phrase that is starting to turn up"
00:10:30,00:10:37,"in papers, right? Vegetative electron microscopy. Okay. Well, I know what electron microscopy is."
00:10:37,00:10:42,Right. I've done scanning tunneling electron microscopy at university.
00:10:42,00:10:45,A few? Yeah. I've used a scanning tunneling microscope. It's another episode of the
00:10:45,00:10:51,"thousand lives of James Harkin. It is. I think that my lives are so less. I mean, the way"
00:10:51,00:10:57,"we're interested with yours, Andy. But like, yeah, no, you can't say, oh, like, oh, my landscape is"
00:10:57,00:11:03,"more mountainous than Norfolk. It's just like, it cares. Yeah. But compared to Dan, Dan has lived"
00:11:03,00:11:08,"a billion lives. Dan's had an interesting life. Do you two both look, I just look up at both your"
00:11:08,00:11:13,"lives and I'm really impressed. Anyway, okay, vegetative electron microscopy, your right James,"
00:11:13,00:11:18,"it means nothing. It's not a meaningful phrase. Okay. But it has become what scientists are calling,"
00:11:18,00:11:25,"a digital fossil. This is so cool. It's a mistake. There was a, there were some scientific papers"
00:11:25,00:11:32,"printed in the 50s and 60s, which were written on columns, you know, like long tall columns of"
00:11:32,00:11:36,"print. Yeah. And when these papers were being digitized, the two things got bolted onto each other."
00:11:36,00:11:41,"So the words are not next to each other in the original text, but the digitizing machine"
00:11:41,00:11:46,just bolted them together. This has now started turning up in lots of papers because it's somehow
00:11:46,00:11:51,got into the knowledge base of AI models. And people are starting to use AI to generate science
00:11:51,00:11:58,"papers. And this is disastrous. You know, this is proof that there's real brain rot going on at the"
00:11:58,00:12:03,"heart of lots of the AI models that are being used. And lots of science papers are being found,"
00:12:03,00:12:09,"which contain phrases like, I am an AI model, or I am a large model. It breaks loose this year."
00:12:09,00:12:12,"Yeah. Oh, come on. First gonorrhea vaccine. Oh, what a treat. Finally."
00:12:12,00:12:17,Good news. It's only got a performance rate of 30 or 40 percent. But that's better than nothing.
00:12:17,00:12:23,I hate. Yeah. That's terrific. First successful bladder transplant. One has never been done
00:12:23,00:12:28,until this year. Really? That's good. Really. And I think it's in China. Some scientists have
00:12:28,00:12:32,"invented contact lenses, which give you infrared vision and let you see things even if your"
00:12:32,00:12:39,eyes are closed. Now. That's cool. Is that what if you want to close your eyes because you don't want
00:12:39,00:12:43,"it like you're watching a scary movie. Yeah. And you think, Oh, I don't want to see what's happening"
00:12:43,00:12:47,"here. So I close my eyes, but then you can still see it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah."
00:12:47,00:12:57,"You walk into your parrot's bedroom, but they're shagging. I want to give a quick shout out to"
00:12:57,00:13:03,"an amazing person who passed away this year, an Australian called James Harrison. He was 88"
00:13:03,00:13:09,years old when he passed this year. And he is one of the most prolific blood donors that we've ever
00:13:09,00:13:15,known. So he was known in Australia as the man with the golden arm. His blood contained a rare
00:13:15,00:13:21,"antibody, anti D, which is used in medication that's given to pregnant mothers and its blood plasma"
00:13:21,00:13:27,"basically that he's handing over. Now he has been doing this since he was 18 years old, donating"
00:13:27,00:13:34,his blood every two weeks until he was 81 years old. Crazy. Yeah. You can't stick her every time.
00:13:34,00:13:41,And a lollipop. And a lollipop is morbidly obese by the end. I talked about cats earlier. There's
00:13:41,00:13:48,been some dog studies this year. The epidemiology and clinical management of acute diarrhea in dogs
00:13:48,00:13:55,"on the primary veterinary care in the UK was a study that I read. And it's very, very technical,"
00:13:55,00:14:01,"lots of lists of dogs, lots of reasons why they get diarrhea, very complicated. But what I took out"
00:14:01,00:14:07,of it is that cockapoo's are 25% more likely to suffer from diarrhea than shit zoos. Brilliant.
00:14:07,00:14:14,Why didn't put that as the headline? I don't know why they gave it that wordy thing. I feel like most
00:14:14,00:14:19,science reports to just send you a quick email for the story breaks just for a quick rewrite on the
00:14:19,00:14:23,headlines. The case is a dad joke. Yeah. Exactly.
00:14:23,00:14:35,All right. It's time for fact number two. And that is Andy's fact. Okay. Here is my guest
00:14:35,00:14:42,introducing him or herself. Yeah. See what you make of it. Okay. All them. All them. Right.
00:14:42,00:14:48,"Hi, fish. My name is Lee Durant. I'm a radio presenter in the late district. Can you guess what I"
00:14:48,00:14:56,did this year that made a few headlines? Okay. Very nice. So Lee Durant Lake district. He's got
00:14:56,00:15:02,that DJ voice. He's got a great voice. Yeah. So like he's on the district radio. Okay. Yeah. Maybe he
00:15:02,00:15:10,"launched a load of Sabrina carpenter of CDs into the water. Oh, yes. That's what he did. Yeah."
00:15:10,00:15:15,Submariner carpenter. Yeah. Take a drink. You've earned that. You earned that sip. Yeah.
00:15:15,00:15:22,Okay. So is it related to music or it is related to music? He did something in the course of his
00:15:22,00:15:30,"job, which was okay. And but also related to the late district. Oh, okay. Interesting. Oh, no. What?"
00:15:30,00:15:34,"I've just thought of something that's in the late district. Oh, yeah. Something that's very"
00:15:34,00:15:39,"special to Andy's heart. Oh, is it anything to do with the pencil museum? I wish it were."
00:15:39,00:15:47,"Oh, it's not the Kessik pencil museum. Oh, okay. So is it related to people who are from there?"
00:15:47,00:15:53,"So Wordsworth or... No, it's a modern thing. He's drawing attention to a problem in the late"
00:15:53,00:15:58,district. There is going on right now. There is a nuclear power plant up in Cumbria. He's very happy
00:15:58,00:16:01,"with that. Actually, no, I don't want to put words in his mouth. We have. We had a couple of"
00:16:01,00:16:06,chats. We didn't talk about everything in the district. Is it? Is it due with water pollution?
00:16:06,00:16:11,"Because we have a lot of problem with that in the UK. Yes, it is. Okay. Okay. Did he do a poo in"
00:16:11,00:16:17,late wind of air? Two. What's the goal of that? I didn't know whether he's pro or against.
00:16:17,00:16:25,"He's just pointing out it exists, guys. Well, shall I tell you what it is? Because I think you've"
00:16:25,00:16:31,got so close to that. Okay. I'm the presenter on late district radio who played a marathon 24 hour
00:16:31,00:16:38,"show of number two records to highlight the real number two problem, sewage in our lakes and waterways."
00:16:38,00:16:46,Very good. How good is that? Very good. I love it. He did a dirty protest. He played 24 hours
00:16:46,00:16:51,straight of number two songs. Great. It was so good. And so all songs that peaked at number two in
00:16:51,00:16:56,the charts. And there is lots of sewage going into late wind of air and the utilities companies that
00:16:56,00:16:59,"you know, they pay their bosses a lot. In my chat with him, he said this phrase, which I've just"
00:16:59,00:17:03,"absolutely loved. So what's more seconding, the fact that these water firms are paying themselves"
00:17:03,00:17:07,millions while failing to fix the sewage problem or that Oasis never got to number one due to
00:17:07,00:17:15,"Robson and Jerome. Oh, yeah. Unchain melody for Robson and Jerome, presumably. And don't know,"
00:17:15,00:17:20,"just a very, very funny idea. Yeah, very good. Good for him. And has it solved the problem? Yep."
00:17:20,00:17:27,"I think it's embarrassed United utilities who do run the water up there. Unfortunately, number"
00:17:27,00:17:31,ones are also a problem if you put too much of them in the water. Very good point. Yes. Very
00:17:31,00:17:37,good point. Wow. Amazing. That's the second marathon of songs that happened this year. One just
00:17:37,00:17:46,"happened with Alex Horn. Oh, yeah. They played one song on repeat for I think it was 24 hours as well."
00:17:46,00:17:50,Which so I'm going off the top of my head here. So I can't quite remember. It was something
00:17:50,00:17:54,"apt. It was like, don't stop me singing. I love that. Yeah. But it was like that kind of like,"
00:17:55,00:18:01,"yeah, and they had the guests non-stop flooding into sort of the version of it. Wow. Yeah. Those"
00:18:01,00:18:06,"marathons are very, I was part of a marathon this year. Yeah. I mean, it only lasted for"
00:18:06,00:18:16,"365 minutes, but it was the 31st anniversary of Agadu this year. Oh, yeah. By Black Lace. Yeah,"
00:18:16,00:18:21,"exactly. So it says, do, do, do. Yeah. So you pushed a pineapple for 300 hours."
00:18:24,00:18:29,"No, to celebrate it, the crab museum guys who lived down where I live, they put the song on"
00:18:29,00:18:35,"on 41 different devices and played them at the same time. And it was wild. It was a, it was a"
00:18:35,00:18:40,cacophony of sound because as well goes out of sync very quickly. Does it? Yeah. On different
00:18:40,00:18:45,"devices, you're at different bit rates, I think. And so it just slowly goes off. Anyway, nice. Let's"
00:18:45,00:18:52,"get back to actual news. No, that's really good. So we're a couple of other sewagey protests this year."
00:18:52,00:18:58,"Oh, yeah. There was this month, actually, this December, there was a centres against sewage swim"
00:18:58,00:19:05,in Falmouth in Cornwall had to be called off. Can you guess why? Because all the reindeer's drowned.
00:19:05,00:19:13,That's it. Too much sewage in the water for them to do a centres against sewage swim. This is the
00:19:13,00:19:16,second year out of three. It's had to be cancelled due to the sheer volume of sewage in the water.
00:19:16,00:19:21,"Oh, no, bad. It is bad, bad, bad. Do they sort of hope it's going to be cancelled? Is that the whole"
00:19:21,00:19:25,point of it? Does that get the press? Is it annoying if they actually have to do the swim?
00:19:25,00:19:28,"I don't know. I think these people are all, you know, well, they're lacking Cornwall. They like"
00:19:28,00:19:32,that beat the swim surface swimming. So I think they probably are up for it. Yeah.
00:19:32,00:19:38,"There's been a big protest in France this year. Oh, isn't every year. Very, very strange for the"
00:19:38,00:19:45,"French to cut up rough. Well, the kick enough about it's the most French protest. The length of"
00:19:45,00:19:52,Begette's has shot and that's the second most French protest. There's a campaign at the moment
00:19:52,00:19:59,to raise the retirement age in France to the ungodly age of 64. And I can't stand the thought of that.
00:19:59,00:20:05,What is it currently? I think it's 62 at the moment. Right. And every French president for the
00:20:05,00:20:09,"last 40 years has been saying, look, we really need to raise the retirement age just a bit to make"
00:20:09,00:20:15,"the money add up. And every time they do it, people set fire to cars. Pretty much. Yeah. Absolutely."
00:20:15,00:20:20,"And a French group of artists this year, they launched a campaign encouraging the French"
00:20:20,00:20:24,to make up for the extra two years by being systematically late for work for the entire
00:20:24,00:20:30,year they were really. They've put together an official calendar and you plug in your age.
00:20:30,00:20:34,"And it says, right, this is how late you need to be for work every single day of your life from now"
00:20:34,00:20:39,on in order to get those two years back. That's interesting because I was 10 minutes late for this
00:20:39,00:20:46,today. Yeah. Just embracing my French side. I met a man who's in his 40s when I was living in
00:20:46,00:20:53,"Angulham in the South of France. And he told me another chapter, another chapter in the book of"
00:20:53,00:20:58,"Dan. I honestly did not know that you used to live in Anglia. Yeah, just just for like it was like"
00:20:58,00:21:03,"three months, four months, I was living with my grandmother. It's a long time. Yeah. That's a long time"
00:21:03,00:21:08,to live somewhere that we've never heard of in our 11 years making a week. If I had ever been to
00:21:08,00:21:14,"Angulham on holiday, you guys would know all about it. Was that like you opened that pitisserie"
00:21:14,00:21:23,that was based on Basel Basel? All the baked goods are the other side of an imaginary
00:21:23,00:21:31,"tale of glass. So no one can ever get me. I can grab. Yeah, this guy said that he was now on his"
00:21:31,00:21:37,pension because he worked in the army as which guy? The French man who was in his 40s who I met.
00:21:37,00:21:42,"Sorry. Yes. There was the bit connected to you. Yeah, you met a guy. I met a guy and he was retired."
00:21:42,00:21:47,"He had, he was on his French pension and it's because he was in the army and he was a parachuter,"
00:21:47,00:21:53,a paratrooper. And there was a little blip I guess in the in the wording which meant that if you
00:21:53,00:21:59,"done a number of jumps, you could retire and go into your pension. Okay. Right. So he did something"
00:21:59,00:22:03,"like in the space of a year, something like 500 jumps. He literally got up, got in a plane,"
00:22:03,00:22:08,"jumped out, got down, got back up and we just continuously do it. And now he's just living a life,"
00:22:08,00:22:14,"just free on a pension in his 40s. That is amazing. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, the chance of one of the jumps"
00:22:14,00:22:19,"going wrong is very low, but obviously the more you do. Yeah. And then presumably the idea of"
00:22:19,00:22:25,the government is if enough people die in jumps and they'll have less of a pension bill. That's
00:22:25,00:22:32,possible. Yeah. The last hundred you have to do volcanoes over the mouths of snapping
00:22:32,00:22:39,"alligators. Yeah. There was a big problem in America this year with the budget, wasn't there?"
00:22:39,00:22:45,"Do you remember that? No. So basically, the Republicans tried to pass a budget and the Democrats"
00:22:45,00:22:52,"decided to put the whole country into lockdown, which, you know, every time the president tries to do"
00:22:52,00:22:56,"that, the other side tries to do that. So it's not a Republican Democrat thing, it is just a thing."
00:22:56,00:23:03,"But in Charlotte, in North Carolina, they were trying to pass a budget and protestors stop the meeting"
00:23:03,00:23:11,by releasing an unknown number of crickets. That's an interesting way of stopping something because
00:23:11,00:23:18,"actually it causes an enormous amount of tumult, but crickets, you think that's just like silence and"
00:23:18,00:23:23,"quietness, don't you? It's like a bad joke as crickets. Yes. But actually it caused an absolutely"
00:23:23,00:23:27,amazing amount of craziness because people were running around trying to get rid of these crickets.
00:23:27,00:23:31,"Not because they were very noisy. No, it wasn't. It was just that people don't."
00:23:31,00:23:35,"Have you ever watched I'm a celebrity get me out of here? No. Well, if you do watch that, you'll"
00:23:35,00:23:40,"know that that's celebrities at least, but you can extend it to the general public. Don't like"
00:23:40,00:23:45,insects jumping on them. Yes. Celebrities on different in that respect. No. They're better than
00:23:45,00:23:52,those in many respects. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's an unknown number is a good thing. That's
00:23:52,00:23:58,"like the old joke of you release five sheep somewhere, and you paint on their sides one, two, three,"
00:23:58,00:24:04,"four, and six. Yeah. And then you can reduce the city to chaos for days as they try and find"
00:24:04,00:24:07,"sheep number five, which doesn't exist. They all sleep every time they start looking for it."
00:24:07,00:24:13,"I got one more music thing to add. Seeing this was a musical protest fact that we've opened up with,"
00:24:13,00:24:17,which is that. So one of the other big things going on in the world right now is how people are
00:24:17,00:24:22,"responding to AI coming in and destroying human fields. In the creative arts, it's a big deal."
00:24:22,00:24:28,"And in music, it's been a big thing. So earlier this year, a thousand musicians got together to"
00:24:28,00:24:36,"release an album called, is this what we want? Question mark. Oh, yeah. And it went to 38 in the album"
00:24:36,00:24:42,"charts, and it was an entirely silent album. Oh, considering that's actually pretty good. Exactly."
00:24:42,00:24:48,"So like it included Kate Bush, Annie Lennox, Damon Alburn from Blur, Ed O'Brien from Radiohead,"
00:24:48,00:24:54,Dan Smith from Bastille. Did they all have to pay royalties to John Cage?
00:24:54,00:24:58,"Interestingly, I haven't heard whether or not that's the case. That's a really good question,"
00:24:58,00:25:03,but they all contributed bits of silence to it. I managed to track down one of the musicians
00:25:03,00:25:09,"to get an exclusive outtake from the album. Oh, wow. Yeah. So here we go. This is something that"
00:25:09,00:25:15,"didn't make it to the album. Hello, no such thing as a fish. It's Dan Smith here for a band called"
00:25:15,00:25:22,"Bastille. I wanted to send you an exclusive outtake from my contribution to, is this what we want"
00:25:22,00:25:27,"the album from this year. This was my favourite bit, and I was pretty gutted that it didn't make the"
00:25:27,00:25:31,"cut, but I'm just really happy to have the opportunity to share it with you now. So here we go."
00:25:31,00:25:44,"Wasn't that beautiful. Anyway, have a good show and have a great break. Bye."
00:25:44,00:25:50,"That's amazing. Yes, that was great. So that's, yeah. Bastille. That was an outtake from their"
00:25:50,00:25:54,"contribution to this album, and it's, yeah, you can get it on vinyl. It's a pre-order right now"
00:25:54,00:25:58,"if anyone's listening, but a very cool protest. Sorry for that. A very dangerous thing that's going"
00:25:58,00:26:03,"on for a lot of artists. I did fight, okay, guys, I'm really sorry. I found something from, it's just,"
00:26:03,00:26:10,just over a year ago. I was going to put money on and bringing the 2024 story to the table.
00:26:10,00:26:14,"Last December, I'm so annoyed, this guy just missed this year, but it was a brilliant,"
00:26:14,00:26:18,windermere protest. That's all. Have you heard of the chain of supermarkets' booths?
00:26:18,00:26:24,"Oh, yeah. I used to live up there. So yeah, they're like the waitros of North Lancashire and"
00:26:24,00:26:30,"Cumbria. Oh, wow. And that's their slogan, isn't it? Yeah. There was a guy called Michael Moody,"
00:26:30,00:26:35,"who got a parking ticket. I believe in the booths in windermere, which is only as I bring it up,"
00:26:35,00:26:40,"windermere in the Lake District, and he didn't pay it, because according to him, he didn't notice"
00:26:40,00:26:45,that he got the letters saying you've got a parking ticket. And then he got handed a county court
00:26:45,00:26:49,"judgment for not paying his parking ticket. And at that point, that meant that he could no longer"
00:26:49,00:26:55,get a mortgage. So he decided to launch a protest against booths of windermere. Okay. He traveled
00:26:55,00:27:01,"from his home in Skegness. Oh my god, that's a long way. Quite a way. Couple hundred miles. His"
00:27:01,00:27:06,"like Skegness for non-British listeners is on the opposite coast of the UK. Yeah, he went to the"
00:27:06,00:27:11,car park of booths windermere. He went back to the scene of the crime or non-crime. Whatever.
00:27:11,00:27:16,"The alleged crime. Where he got the ticket, certainly. And he moved his entire living room into"
00:27:16,00:27:24,"the car park, which was so far, some bookshelves, some coffee tables, his pet goldfish, that he just moved"
00:27:24,00:27:30,into a parking space. Wow. That booths windermere. What a hero. That's amazing. And what happened?
00:27:30,00:27:34,It's having been able to find an update. So I suspect they've had him quietly taken care of.
00:27:34,00:27:37,John Wilts Boots.
00:27:37,00:27:48,"Okay, it's time for our next fact. And that is James."
00:27:48,00:27:54,Okay. Here is my voice note from someone that was sent to me just last night.
00:27:54,00:27:59,Hi guys. My name is Shiva McCutchen. And this year I achieved something with the help of my three
00:27:59,00:28:04,brothers. He did something with his three brothers. With his three brothers. And we are in the realm of
00:28:04,00:28:09,sport. And I want to just say thank you so much to Shiva and for sending me that because he is
00:28:09,00:28:14,really sick. Okay. He's got the illness that's going around at the moment. So he came out of his
00:28:14,00:28:18,"sick bed to record that. But yeah, and with three of his brothers, he did something this year."
00:28:18,00:28:24,"Three. So it requires four people. Okay, so I think it's and it's in the world of sport."
00:28:24,00:28:31,"Yeah. It's a four person sporting team. Actually, there are four of eight in the squad and five in the"
00:28:31,00:28:37,"team. Uh, rowing. Very close. Oh, unbelievably close for a first guest. Right. Actually, I just think"
00:28:37,00:28:44,"eight. Yeah, eight. Don't get me eight in sports. And so there's a, uh, is it, um, curling? No,"
00:28:44,00:28:48,"further away. I mean, rowing was unbelievably close. So I don't know why I don't know why curling"
00:28:48,00:28:51,"would be well, you were just close in the number. I thought curling. It's quite a big team. You've"
00:28:51,00:28:56,"got the guy who throws the curl. You've got the go of the broom. You've got there's like, like,"
00:28:56,00:29:02,"four people yelling from behind. Hard of, hard of brushing. Yeah. Okay. Thanks for the explanation"
00:29:02,00:29:07,of what curling is then. I think just saying rowing was close. Is it like yachting? Further away.
00:29:07,00:29:14,"Okay. It's our boat. It's on a small boat. Oh, small boats. Uh, sailing the English channel. Uh,"
00:29:14,00:29:21,"it's small boat, small boat migration. Small boats. Uh, they're all in separate boats. Oh,"
00:29:21,00:29:27,"they're all in separate boats. Is this one of those, uh, sort of historical reenactments where they're"
00:29:27,00:29:35,"all sitting in tiny ships? It's like the battle of Trafalgar. Yeah, that's cool. I love that. I"
00:29:35,00:29:41,actually would worth us. I've watched the heck out of those. You've created a really good sport. I
00:29:41,00:29:46,"got to say, especially for the English and the British, like because we're going to go to the"
00:29:46,00:29:52,World Cup next year and probably won't win it. But I reckon then the annual Battle of Trafalgar
00:29:52,00:29:57,competition. We're going to thrash them every year. In the bars. They'll be throwing pites everywhere.
00:29:57,00:30:04,Sing a sweet Caroline. Okay. What are we saying? Small boats. It's canoe a kayak canoe canoe. Yeah.
00:30:04,00:30:15,"Uh, so they were four canoes in the team GB canoe polo team canoe polo that won bronze at the"
00:30:15,00:30:24,World Games this year. That's amazing. Polo. Absolutely. Wow. And so we won bronze this year and
00:30:24,00:30:31,"Shiven McCutcheon, Surian McCutcheon, Santana McCutcheon and Catec McCutcheon were all in the team"
00:30:31,00:30:36,"together. Fantastic. That's so good. And were they, were they raised to be in boats?"
00:30:36,00:30:41,"To eat. Well, did they, did they have a parent like the, you know, like the William sisters dad"
00:30:41,00:30:49,who just like from birth to be canoe polo? I think what it is is there are not so many canoe polo teams
00:30:49,00:30:55,in the UK. Right. But there is one amazing one in Liverpool called Friends of Allenby. And they're
00:30:55,00:31:03,all part of this canoe polo team. And in total 13 of the canoe polo players from the male and females
00:31:03,00:31:10,"teams came from this one club. Just like they're all the, the Liverpool or the Arsenal of,"
00:31:10,00:31:15,"yeah, of canoe polo. And you're going to have a, obviously, a variety of ages between them. So"
00:31:15,00:31:20,"begs the question, what is an ideal age to be a canoe poloist? Yeah, they're all in the 20s, I think."
00:31:20,00:31:26,"Apologies. Apologies if any of them in their late teens are early 30s, but yeah, they're all about"
00:31:26,00:31:31,"that age. And this was the World Games, which is, it's like the Olympic Games, but it's for sports"
00:31:31,00:31:37,"that are not in the Olympics. I read that it, I'd never heard of it before. And I found a list of"
00:31:37,00:31:41,"sports that are in there, which are not sports, I know, well, at all. I don't know anything about"
00:31:41,00:31:47,"fin swimming. Yeah. I don't know anything about fistball. Fistball. And so, right, fistball is like"
00:31:47,00:31:54,"volleyball, but the balls allowed to bounce. Oh, okay. And the amazing thing about fistball is it was"
00:31:54,00:32:02,"written about in 1786 by friend of the podcast, Johan Wolfgang von Gerther. Oh, he wrote about going"
00:32:02,00:32:08,to a fistball game between four noblemen from Verona and four Venetians. Right. It's amazing.
00:32:08,00:32:14,"Snooker is in the World Games, because it's not in the Olympics. Yeah. Right. And Snooker was won by"
00:32:14,00:32:20,"Xiao Gu Dong, who is the world's number eight snooker player. And with the greatest respect to all"
00:32:20,00:32:26,"the other players, he was the only professional there. Right. So he was like, he really wanted to"
00:32:26,00:32:32,"compete and win a medal for China, because he's very patriotic. But he is, at the time, he was the"
00:32:32,00:32:38,eight best player in the world. And everyone else was at aperture. Can you imagine that?
00:32:38,00:32:43,"Yeah. In fact, he actually lost one of his group games, but yeah, he basically smashed everyone,"
00:32:43,00:32:51,because he is one of the world's best. So yeah. So congratulations to Shiven. Let me play in
00:32:51,00:33:00,"the reveal. Oh, yeah. The answer is we're part of the British canoe follow team who won bronze"
00:33:00,00:33:05,"at this year's World Games in Chengdu. Yeah, we know that, mate. And of course, just wants to say"
00:33:05,00:33:10,Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to Dan and D James and everyone tuning in to the fun.
00:33:10,00:33:15,"I thought you feel bad. He said, ""Have Merry Christmas to us."" Yep. Got him prematurely."
00:33:15,00:33:20,I apologise to all the brothers. That's really cool. Thanks for sending us that. That's amazing.
00:33:20,00:33:23,Yeah. It's really cool. You never heard of that game. Do you think it's going to make
00:33:23,00:33:27,its way to the Olympics one day? I'd love it too. I think it's quite exciting. I've seen
00:33:27,00:33:32,"some videos of it. It's really cool. It does sound good. There is another, this isn't a proper"
00:33:32,00:33:37,"campaign running at the moment, but I did read a piece recently about paintball players who"
00:33:37,00:33:45,are campaigning for it to be eventually an Olympic sport. I can see that. Yeah. It's a fun game.
00:33:45,00:33:50,"I think it would be fun for spectators. Yeah. I mean, it's fun to do for sure, but it's not even"
00:33:50,00:33:54,recognised as a sport yet. I think so. That's probably the first. That's probably the first hurdle to
00:33:54,00:33:58,clear before you get into the Olympics. It would be remarkable if it went straight from not a
00:33:58,00:34:06,spot to end the Olympics. Here is a cool thing that has been revealed. There are a lot of
00:34:06,00:34:15,track and field records being broken. Yeah. Because a lot of them have stagnated for decades.
00:34:15,00:34:20,Because basically everyone took drugs. Right. And we didn't know about it. And now people are taking
00:34:20,00:34:24,fewer drugs or less good drugs and they can't beat the records anymore. But there is a thing you
00:34:24,00:34:31,"can take, which helps you run a bit faster. Interesting. Consistently helps you run a bit faster."
00:34:31,00:34:37,All athletes are taking it now. All athletes are taking it. Yeah. And it makes you run faster.
00:34:37,00:34:41,"You'll both have some in your pantry, I'm going to say. I don't have a pantry. But let's say,"
00:34:41,00:34:47,"is it kind of, is it like nutmeg? You would use it in your, it's in your baking cupboard."
00:34:48,00:34:53,"Oh, baking cupboard. Yeah. Learning a lot about Andy's kitchen here. He's got a pantry of baking"
00:34:53,00:34:57,cupboard. Turn left after the second pantry and that's the baking cupboard. I'll ask the bottle
00:34:57,00:35:04,letter of a tree for you. Wheel the cheese for a driver to one side. Okay. What would be in your
00:35:04,00:35:11,baking cupboard? Is it baking soda? It's baking soda. Is it really? What a disappointment short quiz
00:35:11,00:35:17,"that was. I was gearing up for at a very enjoyable half hour there. No, it's baking soda."
00:35:17,00:35:22,"This is so bizarre. Basically, it seems to act as a buffer against increased acid build-up"
00:35:22,00:35:28,in muscles. It's legal. And they've developed ways of giving it to you. It probably doesn't
00:35:28,00:35:34,"work if you take it in a cake, unfortunately. Yeah. All the athletes are scoffing a quick"
00:35:34,00:35:38,quick bit of chocolate punch cake at the starting line. It's very sadly. That's not it.
00:35:38,00:35:43,"But there were some of that because we had an Olympics last year, didn't we?"
00:35:43,00:35:48,"And the winter Olympics is about to happen. Okay, because there were some events last summer where"
00:35:48,00:35:53,almost all finalists were taking baking soda. Right. Is that legal? Is not how do they take it?
00:35:53,00:35:58,"Is it? It's in some sort of boring gel, right? Yeah. Again, don't just go scoffing baking soda"
00:35:58,00:36:05,"from your pantry. Yeah. The baking soda challenge. Don't do it, guys. Yeah, it's been put in some"
00:36:05,00:36:11,complicated thing by some nerds. That's very cool. Do you remember this year when Donald Trump won
00:36:11,00:36:16,"the FIFA Peace Prize? Ah, of course. How good would we forget? I was praying for it for so many"
00:36:16,00:36:22,months that it came true and I just couldn't believe it. He also won the FIFA Club World Cup.
00:36:22,00:36:27,"He's a soccer competition. Oh, yeah. Come on. This guy's not running."
00:36:27,00:36:34,"So most people like the fake news think the Chelsea won it. And sure enough, they did win"
00:36:34,00:36:40,the final. But it was in New Jersey that it took place. No. And Donald Trump was at the final.
00:36:41,00:36:48,"And the head of FIFA in Fantino, he went to the White House and showed Donald Trump the actual"
00:36:48,00:36:53,"trophy and said, oh, you can look after this for a while. And then according to Donald Trump's"
00:36:53,00:36:59,"account, he said, when are you going to pick up the trophy, Gianni? And in Fantino said, oh, no,"
00:36:59,00:37:04,we're never going to pick it up. You can have it forever. And we're making a new one. So Chelsea got
00:37:04,00:37:11,"the replica and the winner of the actual club World Cup was Donald Trump. Oh, my God. He's still got"
00:37:11,00:37:19,it. He's still got it. What? There was an amazing thing after that final that all the players of
00:37:19,00:37:23,Chelsea who have stood there waiting to receive their replica trophy and their fireworks are going to
00:37:23,00:37:27,"go. What do they get? What age? No, they'll get a medal and stuff. Okay. Okay. And then they give"
00:37:27,00:37:32,them the trophy and then they hold it up in the crowd go wild. But Donald Trump was on the stage
00:37:32,00:37:38,"sort of handing out the medals, but they're never left. Like all the other dignitaries left the stage"
00:37:38,00:37:43,"and he just kind of stood there. And there's an amazing video of Cole Palmer, the England footballer"
00:37:43,00:37:49,"who is an amazing footballer, but perhaps didn't probably even know who Donald Trump was. Just kind"
00:37:49,00:37:57,of by tonight. I'm going to use this guy. It's amazing. That's amazing. There's a Spanish football club
00:37:57,00:38:03,called Leganes and they you know how football clubs they have the jerseys that you buy and they
00:38:03,00:38:09,have advertising. So they have advertising where your tummy is. Sometimes they have advertising
00:38:09,00:38:17,on where your shoulder is. But this team had advertising where your groin is. So right in the middle
00:38:17,00:38:23,"of the shorts, they had a little advert. Can you guess what the advert was for? Safe sex or some"
00:38:23,00:38:30,contraception stuff. Yeah. You got to read a jab. It was for the testicular cancer society.
00:38:30,00:38:36,"Very good. It was a bit of advertising to bring up awareness for that, but also to teach people"
00:38:36,00:38:41,how to self-check for testicular cancer. That's very good. That's very good.
00:38:41,00:38:46,"James, does any team ever, this is just a little idea I've had, put advertising on the inside of the"
00:38:46,00:38:51,shirt? Okay. What would be the point of that? Because when you score a goal and you pull your
00:38:51,00:38:57,"shirt off over your head, it reveals your secret sponsor. That's really good. That's a good idea, right?"
00:38:57,00:39:02,It's a really good idea. People will wear undershirts with a message written on it. So when they
00:39:02,00:39:05,"lift the shirt, the message is shown. I think you're not allowed to do that. I think you've got"
00:39:05,00:39:12,the yellow card to do that. There was a boxer once who the sun advertised the souls of his feet
00:39:12,00:39:17,because they were so sure he was going to get knocked out when he landed the camera would go
00:39:17,00:39:22,on to the souls of the feet. Really good. It was someone against Mike Tyson. I can't remember who it was.
00:39:22,00:39:30,"Such optimistic ways of seeing light, isn't it? That's really good. Guys, I actually, when I was trying"
00:39:30,00:39:35,"to find a new story from the year, I actually contacted someone else and at the last minute,"
00:39:35,00:39:42,they have sent me a question for us to do with sports. Okay. So can we? Yeah. Here we go. So.
00:39:43,00:39:48,"Hello, no such thing as a fish. My name is Jeremy Derli. And this year in a competition that was"
00:39:48,00:39:55,"broadcast live from Las Vegas on ESPN, I became a world champion. My question for you is, what am I"
00:39:55,00:39:59,"now the world champion of? I've got a guess which I think might be right. So. Oh, yeah."
00:39:59,00:40:08,"What was the name of your correspondent did? Deer emerged early. Okay. Las Vegas, it was out on"
00:40:09,00:40:16,"ESPN. Not a gambling thing. Not a gambling, but not strictly a sport sport, rather an e-sport."
00:40:16,00:40:21,An e-sport. So something to do with computers. Or Yorkshire. Or ecstasy.
00:40:21,00:40:29,"Well, we've talked before about sort of fun things like Microsoft Excel. Yeah. Being sport,"
00:40:29,00:40:33,"is it that? Well, let's, do you want to ask? That would be my guess as well."
00:40:37,00:40:43,That's the end. We're really good out of this balloon. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Let's see what it is.
00:40:43,00:40:49,Imagine if it's conspiracy. The answer is that after an intense competition over three days
00:40:49,00:40:54,"among some of the world's best spreadsheeters, I was crowned this year's Microsoft Excel World"
00:40:54,00:41:01,"Champion. Fantastic. That's really right. To be honest, like you're not going to say, hi,"
00:41:01,00:41:07,"my name's Lionel Messi. Guess which sport I played this year. Hi, my name's Roger Federer. I guess what,"
00:41:07,00:41:12,he's such a big name in this podcast. We're just going to know that. Yeah. Yeah. This is his first
00:41:12,00:41:18,"world championship within the Microsoft Excel competition. Yeah. He faced off against Andrew Nye,"
00:41:18,00:41:25,"who has won it three times. So he took the win. Wow. And I mean, it's a pretty amazing competition."
00:41:25,00:41:30,"They get jumbled data, basically. And in some cases, they have to make the data, make a famous"
00:41:30,00:41:34,painting. So they have to place all the things in the right places to reveal a painting.
00:41:34,00:41:40,The one that was done this year was inspired by origami. So players had to use their knowledge
00:41:40,00:41:46,of the software to complete 130 questions that was spread across seven levels. And the theme of it
00:41:46,00:41:58,"was origami. Amazing. Okay. We would usually do a final fact of the show. There's always usually four,"
00:41:58,00:42:03,"but as there's only three of us, we're going to head straight into. Yeah. Wait. What? There is another."
00:42:03,00:42:10,What are you on about? I got an extra person. Oh. Did you? Yeah. Yeah. I sent out a couple of liars
00:42:10,00:42:15,popping around on the water. And I got two bites. A couple of reels. And a second person replied.
00:42:15,00:42:21,"Can I just play you one last person? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's such a great response. Hi, my name is"
00:42:21,00:42:26,just von Rossum. I'm a Dutch typeface designer. I was in the news this year because it looks like I
00:42:26,00:42:32,was the victim of a crime. But can you guess why? Okay. So he's a typeface designer. Yeah.
00:42:32,00:42:42,Did he put the word? He did some work for the S. A. S. A big sign. But his A looks so much like an
00:42:42,00:42:48,O that it looked like it read SOS. And they thought he was in trouble. That's really good. That's
00:42:48,00:42:54,really good. It's not that. No. So he is a Dutch typeface designer. Is a typeface part important?
00:42:54,00:43:00,Yes. Is it? So was the name that he was a victim of is related to his work? So is the typeface name
00:43:00,00:43:08,"itself something like murdered? Oh, that's very nice. I'm going to say something to you guys a"
00:43:08,00:43:15,"little extra clue. Yeah. What's a classic bit of dance stand up, James? Oh, gosh. I mean, there are so"
00:43:15,00:43:22,many. There's so many that's related to typos and typefaces. I can't remember any of your standards.
00:43:22,00:43:27,"The bit where you went on so many different typeface gags that I have. Well, he would wear a fake"
00:43:27,00:43:32,nose and glasses and mustache and take them off and have the same thing. That was pretty good.
00:43:32,00:43:37,What about when he was caught blocked from out of space by that astronaut? That was a great bit.
00:43:37,00:43:44,"Oh, yes. Yes. That's how it feels. Yeah. It's a thing. Is it the time when he was with a woman and"
00:43:44,00:43:52,"she said, take off your trousers and his legs were so hairy that he already had taken off his trousers."
00:43:52,00:43:59,I'm so I was so tempted right now to subtly put out the fact that I am on tour next year with a show.
00:43:59,00:44:03,But this is not doing any favors for that. What's that? That is on Tardex here. Yeah.
00:44:03,00:44:08,"Well, how do you forget tickets? Well tickets are going to be allocated by a sort of like it's"
00:44:08,00:44:15,like going to be jury-duty. You'll just get the call. You have to do it. You do have to do it.
00:44:15,00:44:21,Unless you've got an amazing reason. They're not inhuman. They will let you off. You're really
00:44:21,00:44:27,"on what else. No, it's called this changes everything. It's going to be in March and April. Tickets"
00:44:27,00:44:32,"are on sale now, by the way, guys. If anyone wants to come, London, Brighton, all sorts of places. Yeah."
00:44:32,00:44:39,"Yeah. Anyway, is your quiz that if it's still a dance show that he's doing is to do with a very famous"
00:44:39,00:44:46,"advert? Oh, you want to steal a card? Ding, ding, ding. Yes. You want to hear us. Yeah."
00:44:46,00:44:52,"Just Van Rossum says I designed a font called FF Confidential. This year, an investigation"
00:44:52,00:44:57,found that the font seems to have been pirated and used in a very famous effort saying you wouldn't
00:44:57,00:45:04,steal a car. So good. Wow. This is like level zero of the podcast. This is friend of the podcast
00:45:04,00:45:12,from the get go. So just designed that font. Yeah. Which an investigation this year found had been
00:45:12,00:45:18,nicked because the font used in that advert is identical to the font he designed and they did a little
00:45:18,00:45:24,bit of kind of DNA testing on the font in the advert. And is that font incredible? I'm starstruck.
00:45:24,00:45:30,"You are so excited. I was so excited to hear that. Very good. Oh, well, thank you. Thank you, Andy."
00:45:30,00:45:36,"But hey, guys, we now need to get to an exciting little festive bit of the show. James Andy and I"
00:45:36,00:45:41,"never get to be around the Christmas tree every year, which is a huge shame. What do you mean?"
00:45:42,00:45:47,As if we all go and see our families instead of spending time together. Yeah. Yeah. Which is a huge
00:45:47,00:45:52,disappointment every year for me. So what we thought we'd do is we'd end this week's episode
00:45:52,00:45:58,as it's Christmas by giving each other a present. And so we've got them in front of us here. We've all
00:45:58,00:46:02,bought each other a present. Get my note. Let me get mine out. Dan's done a really nice wrapping
00:46:02,00:46:10,job on his and a label and everything. And mine looks a bit crummy. I'd look like a field bit of evidence.
00:46:10,00:46:17,"Yeah. Oh, James has got a magicians. Oh, wait, wait, wait. Okay. This is all prep. I'll close my"
00:46:17,00:46:21,eyes. The bad news for you. I've had that operation where I could see through my eyes.
00:46:21,00:46:26,So James is bought a present for me. I bought a present for Andy. And Andy is bought a present
00:46:26,00:46:31,"for James. So let's do it. James, do you want to start? I got first. So this is for you, Dan."
00:46:31,00:46:37,"Your present is in this bag. Okay. Should I feel? Yeah, feel it. No. There's nothing in there."
00:46:37,00:46:42,"Oh, well, maybe there will be something in there. Let me see what I can find in there."
00:46:42,00:46:50,"That's my magic wand. It's not that. Let me just do what else is in there. Oh,"
00:46:50,00:46:55,"well, that's mine and Anna's book. It's definitely not that. Everything to play for, by the way."
00:46:55,00:47:00,"Oh, that's I don't know what that is going on here. This is brilliant. This is here it is. Here it is."
00:47:00,00:47:09,It's as card signed by Jesse Eisenberg from the now you're seeing me face. You're kidding. There you go.
00:47:09,00:47:19,"Oh, my goodness. The best film franchise ever. Yeah. Wow. Oh, wow. It's amazing. I did find it. It's"
00:47:19,00:47:25,"very, very rare. If you go on eBay, there's only about 500 of them. Right. He makes a lot more off the"
00:47:25,00:47:30,"side cars. Certainly, then he does off the movies. Yeah. Yeah. How exciting. Thank you very much. This has"
00:47:30,00:47:36,been the surprise movie hit of the year for the podcast. Now you've seen it has become a friend of
00:47:36,00:47:41,"the podcast. I'm the only one who hasn't seen. No, I haven't. No, I haven't seen it now."
00:47:41,00:47:48,"I haven't seen the third one, which is out now, but isn't there a character in it called"
00:47:48,00:47:56,Shriver? There is. Yeah. They have to call to London for some creative person. Right. I won't give
00:47:56,00:48:02,"too much away, but they're like, get Shriver on the phone right now. There you go. Netflix has seen"
00:48:02,00:48:09,Shriver to any creative people. What's that? Your friends James and Andy. They sound perfect.
00:48:09,00:48:16,Beautiful. Thank you so much. That's a very thoughtful present because I do. I do love that
00:48:16,00:48:21,"maybe. Should we go around this way? Yeah, sure. Okay. This is for you. Thank you very much."
00:48:21,00:48:28,"A label there. Andy, love Dan. They're three kisses. Yeah. So nice. My son wrote that. Okay."
00:48:28,00:48:34,Could be anything. Could at this stage. At this stage. And it's rap state. It could be anything.
00:48:34,00:48:39,"Bookshaped. Interesting. But it's a bit yielding, but that might just be the wrapping paper."
00:48:39,00:48:48,Just doing a bit of Foley. Let me do this. And what is it? It's oh my god. It's a copy of
00:48:48,00:48:56,Lenby Del's book too long in the bush. First edition hardback. First edition hardback.
00:48:56,00:48:59,First edition hardback. You don't have that kind of money. I know. I know. Finale is furious.
00:48:59,00:49:06,Can I too long in the bush? Is the story extending over three years of how the author made the
00:49:06,00:49:13,first road ever to cross central Australia. Oh my gosh. To west. Wow. Just one extra detail is
00:49:13,00:49:20,"that it is a signed copy. Beautiful. Beautiful writing. Lovely handwriting. It's stunning,"
00:49:20,00:49:25,handwriting. For a man who built roads. Yeah. He's got the calligraphy on him. Yeah. He's just a
00:49:25,00:49:30,"multi-talented guy. I'm so chuffed. Thank you. And just in case Mel Bracewell's listening,"
00:49:30,00:49:36,can you explain who Lenby Del is? Lenby Del was responsible for building huge numbers of
00:49:36,00:49:43,"Australia's roads. As it says here, he's made 4,000 miles of lonely roads across central Australia."
00:49:43,00:49:48,"What a legend. Look, I really can't cap that. James, I hope you like this. It's a better"
00:49:48,00:49:55,"be good now. It's nowhere near as good as a Lenby Del book, but signed. I know. I thought Jesse"
00:49:55,00:50:05,"Eisenberg. No kisses on this. It says to my valued colleague with the steam, your colleague,"
00:50:05,00:50:13,"Andy. I'm sorry, I got a bit mushy. I shouldn't have done that. I'm welling up. And it's so beautifully"
00:50:13,00:50:21,"wrapped. So your note was written by your child. It's wrapped by your child, Andy. It's a very"
00:50:21,00:50:26,"difficult thing to wrap, isn't it? Look at it. It's an awkward shape. But I thought, what does James"
00:50:26,00:50:32,"like? James likes a sport. I have, I'm a one-dimensional character, as we've said. But I think this has"
00:50:32,00:50:41,got two dimensions of this gift. It's a Trammeer Elvis golf balls. It's my favourite football team
00:50:41,00:50:46,"and my favourite sport together at last. Wow. You've ripped off the price, which, you know,"
00:50:46,00:50:54,"which was astronomical. Those people are Trammeer outrageous. So it's got balls. Yeah, it's got a"
00:50:54,00:50:59,"logo on it. Right, exactly. It's got teas with Trammeer Elvis written on them. And there's a third"
00:50:59,00:51:04,"thing I don't know what it is. What is on the back? It's a little fork. Okay, can you guess what that's"
00:51:04,00:51:09,"far? It's a little fork. It's a little fork. Molly said it was for marking your balls, which I just"
00:51:09,00:51:15,"don't think can be right. I'm sorry to say Molly's wrong, but she's not far off. Is it a little"
00:51:15,00:51:22,"bookmark, Randy, to read while you're playing the game? I'll be just sitting in the cart. I'll chance"
00:51:22,00:51:29,"get out. Is it something to go on your top pocket to say, ladies, I am available in the 19th hole?"
00:51:29,00:51:35,"Well, it is. If you have golf clubs, they have to be, like, it's really perfect metal and they're"
00:51:35,00:51:41,"the right length and the right size. And if you flick them like that, they make a little noise."
00:51:41,00:51:49,And this is like a little tuning for you. Thank it. And it has to know. I was in. I was in. When the ball lands
00:51:49,00:51:54,"in the ground, it can make a little indentation. And this you kind of flatten it so that next person"
00:51:54,00:52:00,"who comes along doesn't, that ball doesn't bubble around. Is that so? Yeah, yeah. I had no idea. Wow."
00:52:00,00:52:06,"It's invaluable, Andy. Thank you so much. I'm very happy with my gift. And I actually will use"
00:52:06,00:52:12,these for sure. Great. I'll actually read that and Dan will be playing with his cards. Stop again.
00:52:12,00:52:20,"All right, look, well, we hope that you also got amazing presents this year. Had a great Christmas."
