00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Cardiff!

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 [Cheering]

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 [Cheering]

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 My name is Dan Schreiber and I am sitting here with Anish Zenski, Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 starting with you, James

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 Okay my fact this week is that the oldest football cup competition in Spain is the Coppa Del Rey

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 each year the winner gets the name engraved in the trophy in Comic Sans

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 The greatest font of them all

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 So I don't know if you know who invented Comic Sans, anyone? Vincent Kaner and he did it into me recently

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 and they asked him his favorite times at Comic Sans has been used so he said that it was in the Coppa Del Rey

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 in a photo album made by the Vatican and in the presentation by Surn to announce the discovery of the Higgs boson

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 Yes but it wasn't a Vatican, they didn't announce the new Pope in Comic Sans or anything

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 No, they still did that with the smoke

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 If you could do the smoke in Comic Sans

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 It was a lovely photo album that they gave to the Pope

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 So it was the Vatican's present to him and it was all the captions

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 The best way to caption a book, Comic Sans, there's no question

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 You know he's only ever used it once, he said it's Vincent Kaner

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 He said he's used Comic Sans once in his life

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 It was when I was having trouble changing my broadband to sky so I wrote the molestering Comic Sans complaining

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 saying I was disappointed, he got Â£10 refund

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 So he's sold

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 He's very bullish about it, he's done talks like a Ted talk or something saying

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 My name is Vincent Kaner and I've invented the best font in the world

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 And if people don't like it, he pushes back

34
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 So he said, if you love Comic Sans then you don't know anything about typography

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 But if you hate Comic Sans then you don't know anything about typography either

36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 Where should you stand?

37
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 Unbiveness

38
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 I think so, yeah

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 And he also, he has a thing where he loves the hatred for Comic Sans as well

40
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 He really thrives off it and he collects examples of people's furies

41
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 So he was doing an interview again and he said, interesting fact

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 The main designer at Twitter tweeted that the most server space is used by complaints

43
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 First about airlines, second, Comic Sans, third, Justin Bieber

44
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 And then he says, so not even the Bieber can be Comic Sans

45
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 He's said it's like Bieber

46
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 He has said it's the Justin Bieber of fonts

47
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 Most people love him, but a lot of people wouldn't say it's the best music

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 It's fair enough, that's an controversial opinion here in Cardiff anyway

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 He said that he once went to the design museum in London and had to have a bodyguard

50
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 Did he help?

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 Well he said that, I don't know, he maybe he was joking

52
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 But just an interesting fact, his boss at Microsoft when he did that was Rob Norton

53
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 Who was the son of Mary Norton who wrote the borrower's

54
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 And also after he did Comic Sans he designed the Ministry of Sound logo

55
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 Yeah, a few minutes of trivia

56
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 There's this thing about Comic Sans that gets claimed which is that the reason it's used in schools and teachers like it is because it makes children read better

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 And it's very good for dyslexic children because partly because the writing is very slightly unclear

58
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 So it takes you longer to read it and the theory is that makes you remember it better

59
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 But that's been shown to be Bullocks

60
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 So teachers don't write in, there is a font called Sans Fogettica

61
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 And that was developed last year which tries to achieve what people claim Comic Sans does

62
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 And so that's the typeface, you should look at it, it's quite cool

63
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 That's quite difficult to read because it's got lots of gaps in the letters

64
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 And it just means it takes a bit more concentration to read it

65
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 But it is true that your retention of whatever's written there if it's in Sans Fogettica is much better

66
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 So is it that if you have something important you should write it in Sans Fogettica?

67
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 Yes

68
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 Because it feels like quite a risk if you're writing something important is something that people have to read like an emergency sign or an exit sign

69
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 And just saying you should write it with bits missing so people really focus on it

70
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 If it's something you have to remember in future, if it's something you need to know now then maybe just write it in Times New Roman

71
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 There's this thing just on that about how you read

72
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 So when you read I didn't know this, you're jumping all the time between the words

73
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 Otherwise when you read a story you just go once, once, once, once, once

74
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 Make the leap James, make it

75
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 Once upon, once upon, once upon

76
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 Okay, okay

77
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 No, I walked into that and that's fair

78
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 So you're doing these things called I think it's sacades or sacades

79
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 And fixations which is jumps and pauses

80
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 And if you're reading fluently, what you turns out you don't really look at the whole word when you read it

81
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 You look slightly to the left of the middle of the word you're reading

82
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 And you then sort of, you see the immediate letters around it

83
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 And then you kind of guess the other letters as you jump from one thing to another

84
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 That's so true, that is happening right now

85
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 This is live reading, welcome

86
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 Wow, yeah

87
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 So in the, in 2008, John McCain, when he was running for president, he chose Optimer as his font for his signs

88
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 Because it was the same typeface used on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial

89
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 Oh, that was his idea

90
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 Obama used Gotham, which has been described as friendly without being folksy, confident without being aloof

91
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 Wow

92
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 Which is crazy, because it's like a Gotham villain came into power right after him

93
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 Well, yeah, actually Trump's campaign font was called Accidents Grotesque

94
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 Honestly true

95
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 That's a designer having a laugh or something, isn't it? That's amazing

96
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 You know there are font detectives?

97
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 No, yeah

98
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 There are font detectives

99
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 Why? Well

100
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 So I'm looking at it as like we could possibly work out what that is

101
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 So if a font goes missing?

102
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 Yeah

103
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 If it sounds forgettiger, just completely disappeared

104
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 No, it's not quite that

105
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 It's people who determine whether documents are authentic by analyzing the fonts in them

106
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 So if the Dead Sea Scrolls are in Comic Sans, they're probably not

107
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 Exactly

108
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 So this guy Thomas Finney, he writes all these stories about his cases

109
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 And he writes them up like their Sherlock Holmes stories, it's pretty cool

110
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 So for example, in 1999, this lawyer got in touch with him because he was looking at a will

111
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 And he was trying to walk out, is this will real or hasn't been altered

112
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 And Finney discovered that the will was dated 1983, but it was printed by a high-res inkjet printer

113
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 Which wasn't on the market until 1988

114
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 Right

115
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 So, that's good

116
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 That's very good

117
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 But that's more like a printer detective, isn't it?

118
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 Yeah

119
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 Yeah, it was an extremely poor example from a wide-port photo of his career

120
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 On Dead People in France, one of the things that the campaign against Comic Sans hates the most

121
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 So this is a campaign that's set up by Holly and David Combs or Combs, so I think we've mentioned before

122
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 But they say it just doesn't look great in a lot of places

123
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 For instance, as David Combs, a place where it doesn't look great in my opinion is on a tombstone

124
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 And I have seen a number of those

125
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 So there are tombstones up there with Comic Sans?

126
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 There's actually a website you can go to called Comic Sans Criminal, where it sort of lists all of the most heinous crimes of Comic Sans

127
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 And it asks you, the reader, are you a criminal?

128
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 And it shows you examples, do you agree with this kind of thing?

129
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 And there was a, the opening hours for a sex offender's register office

130
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 Sorry, where's sex offender's register?

131
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 Yeah

132
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 Really?

133
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 Yeah, there was a defibrillator as well, which just looked really fun

134
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 There is a theory that this sort of, the whole reason that Comic Sans became huge

135
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 Is that it was a font that was launched, it was designed for this product called Microsoft Bob, which actually it ended up not being included with it

136
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 But it did get included as a package in Windows 95, I think

137
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 And this was the first time that all of us could do type setting

138
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 You know, before that you needed to go to a designer, and then this, and people have described this as a massive shift in power

139
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 You know, democratisation of type setting, it's basically like, what's his name?

140
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 Gutenberg?

141
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 Mmm

142
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 It's like the second print revolution

143
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 What you're saying is basically when you give people democratic choice, they end up doing something stupid

144
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 Well

145
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 You wouldn't have said that on our Sunderland gig, would you?

146
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 We're gonna have to move on to our next fac soon

147
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 A lot of couple of things about just other weird trophy decisions

148
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 There's a NASCAR sprint cup race that's in Mardensville, and their trophy that they give out is a grandfather clock

149
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 It's just a giant grandfather clock, that's what you win

150
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 And that started in 1964, it was given as a prize, everyone loved it so much

151
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 And it's a big thing, it's a big thing to get a grandfather clock, until you get too many

152
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 There was a guy called Dale Ehrenhardt, Jr, who took home six

153
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 Didn't really, I just kept winning and it got to the point where it's like

154
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 Do I just throw this one?

155
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 Now are you lifting that up?

156
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 Well you can't at the podium, yeah, it's a bit, it's a bit full on

157
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 I like, you know, there's a trophy that's given out, a ASCAR, ladies' day, to the owner of the winning race horse

158
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 Which is, it's like the main event, really, an ASCAR isn't it

159
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 And the trophy is presented by the queen

160
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 But that causes a problem when she wins it

161
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 So she has won it before, and Anne Prince Andrew did step in to play the role of the queen

162
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 Presenting it to the queen for that

163
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 But did he play, which queen did he play? Did he play the presenting queen?

164
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 He played the one giving the trophy, and then she played the one, well she was the one receiving the trophy

165
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 Just done a fonts, it's always good idea to choose the right fonts

166
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 Because there's a company called Bell Sheek

167
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 And they had a bag that said "My favourite colour is glitter"

168
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 But they chose the wrong fonts and it looked like "My favourite colour is Hitler"

169
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 Oh, as a couple of years ago, and then last Christmas, Iceland chose the wrong fonts and appeared to be selling ming pies

170
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 Okay, it's time for fact number two, and that is Andy

171
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 My fact is, the American product, "Trockful O Nuts" contains no nuts

172
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 It's a coffee product that the firm used to sell nuts, and then they sold nuts and coffee

173
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 And then they stopped selling the nuts, but they thought "Well the name is so good that we just have to keep the "Trockful O Nuts" name

174
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 Actually on the cans sometimes, some of the cans it says, "1920s, we sold nuts

175
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 1930s, we sold nuts and coffee. Now we don't sell nuts, we just sell coffee, but we like our name

176
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 And it has a massive disclaimer saying contains no nuts

177
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 And yet, every time the firm does any market research on why people might not buy it

178
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 People always say, "I was probably nuts at it, aren't they? It's probably nuts, this is "Trockful O Nuts"

179
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 But it's a New York product, isn't it? And if you said if there was a New Yorker near you, and you said "Trockful O Nuts"

180
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 They would say "Yeah, I know it has no nuts" and it's a big thing

181
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 It was as soon as they started going out into other cities and countries that became a problem for them

182
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 So they actually existed fine without putting it on

183
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 Yeah, they have a picture of the New York skyline as well on their packets

184
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 But they don't name it as the New York skyline

185
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 And their head of marketing said that it's nice, it worked perfectly for us

186
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 Because people in New York see the New York skyline and think this is for me

187
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 And then outside of New York, they have no idea what the New York skyline looks like

188
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 So they just think, "Yeah, fine"

189
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 And he's run focus groups all around America saying, "Would you object to something that said New York on it?"

190
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 And they all say "Yes" and then he says "Why?" and they say "Oh, I think it beats our sports teams"

191
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 And that's it, that's the reason they won't eat nuts

192
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 They're on any nuts in it

193
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 You're falling right into the gym

194
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 Have we said what it is? It's a coffee

195
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 So it started by a guy called William Black

196
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 He rented a little space under a staircase in New York

197
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 But it was underneath a drugstore

198
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 And he wasn't allowed to sell anything that was sold in the drugstore

199
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 So he didn't know what to sell, but there was a theatre opposite, so he decided to sell nuts

200
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 But then when the Great Depression struck, according to the website, nuts seemed too much of a luxury

201
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 And so he had to find something else

202
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 But he had a roasting machine for the nuts

203
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 And so he decided to go down to the docks by green coffee beans, roast them themselves and make coffee

204
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 And sandwiches, right?

205
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 And sandwiches, yes

206
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 And we spoke a few weeks ago about how sandwiches that no human-handed touched were a selling point

207
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 In those days, because it meant that it hadn't got any germs on it

208
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 And he used to sell his sandwiches, advertised as untouched by human hands

209
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 And even when they were making the sandwiches, they had to do it with tongs

210
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 So you had to spread the mayonnaise with one tong and put the ham on with another

211
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 And actually, they probably do that in cafes still, I don't know, I think, but hygiene

212
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 As I said it, I thought that doesn't sound that mad

213
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 So just sort of product names, basically

214
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 And this is a big thing, especially in America, so there's a cereal called fruit loops

215
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 But fruit is spelled F-R-O-O-T

216
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 And there's also cap and crunch with crunch berries

217
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 And these have been the subjects of repeated lawsuits from people who claimed I've been deceived

218
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 I thought this was full of fruit and really good for me

219
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 And the whole statement by judges saying things like, here's one from 2009

220
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 This court is not aware of nor has plaintiff alleged the existence of any actual fruit referred to as a crunch berry

221
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 Furthermore, the crunch berry is depicted on the box around crunchy brightly coloured cereal balls

222
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 So far as this court has been made aware, there is no such fruit growing in the wild or occurring naturally in any part of the world

223
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 You've got to be so careful though, because I red bull got sued in 2014 for the fact that they don't actually give you wings

224
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 There was a proper...

225
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 No, yeah, yeah, come on

226
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 It was a mixture of a... that was one guy who's part of the court case who said, I didn't actually grow any wings

227
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 The rest said it claims that it gives you this great energy and it gives you these boosts

228
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 And so they actually had to pay out a huge amount of money

229
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 Including $10 to every US consumer who'd bought the drinks since 2002 if they wrote in

230
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 Really, yeah

231
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 I remember though as once some sausages sold in Wales called dragon sausages that had to be taken off because they didn't contain any dragons

232
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 Is that true?

233
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 That's true, yeah

234
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 Very disappointing for the card of audience, thought you've been eating dragons all these years

235
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 There's a hair product in... I think in the US called Rogaine and it was originally called Regaine

236
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 And then the FDA, the Food and Drugs Administrator, next that, because they said you can't call it Regaine

237
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 Because obviously it doesn't work, because hair-regraith products don't work

238
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 So you don't have to change the vows

239
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 There was a tattoo artist in London whose salon was called Prick

240
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 He was called Henry Hate

241
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 And he tried to stop a nearby cactus shop from using the same name

242
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 And this guy, Henry Hate, is kind of semi-famous because he did a lot of Amy Winehouse's tattoos

243
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 And he thought that this person with a cactus shop was kind of passing off with his edgy rock and roll name

244
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 But then it went to court and court judge Melissa Clark said

245
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 "It is difficult to imagine two businesses with two less closely related activities

246
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 I think it's fair

247
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 I can imagine two things less similar than tattoos and cactuses

248
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 Like a waffle maker and then a sort of like a Rolls-Royce engine firm

249
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 And if I had a bit longer I could have come up with something really, really different

250
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 I guess they're both round, don't they? So it doesn't really work

251
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 Yeah

252
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 Well

253
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 Just on that very similar note, in 2018 rapper Dr. Dre lost a trademark case to another man called Dr. Dre

254
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 Who was written books including 20 things you might not know about the vagina

255
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 And the judge in that case said that confusion was unlikely as Dr. Dre is not a medical doctor

256
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 Nor is he qualified to provide any type of medical service

257
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 But they should get together because I would listen to a Dr. Dre rap about 20 things you might not know about

258
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 The vagina

259
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 To be honest, I think there's quite a lot of that in his rap

260
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 It's just on the famous names thing

261
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 They're in Australia at the moment, there's a pop-up burger place which a lot of people trying to not shut down but get them to change their name

262
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 They're called Pablo Escoburgers

263
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 And when you buy a burger from Pablo Escoburgers you get a fake line of white powder

264
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 It's like a garlic flower that's on top of the bun and then there's a rolled up $100 note next to it

265
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 Presumably a fake $100 note

266
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 No real?

267
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 It's real?

268
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 Yeah, fake, definitely fake

269
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 The passing off thing is quite, it's really well established, so for example, we've mentioned on the bogus before

270
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 The first ever self-service supermarket are you one way you get a basket and you go around or trolley and you go around putting things in

271
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 Going to a counter and handing over a list, the first ever of those in America was called Piggly Wiggly

272
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 And that was a fun novelty name

273
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 But it was immediately followed by another firm setting up called Hoggley Woggley

274
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 And then helpy selfie and then savey wavy

275
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 And these are all completely different firms

276
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 Do you know that the Food and Drugs Administration in America when people are coming up with names for new drugs

277
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 They run it through a whole bunch of handwriting tests, so they get those people in to write the drugs in certain types of hand-racing

278
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 To make sure that they can never be mistaken in certain handwriting for other drugs

279
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 Oh really?

280
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 That's really clever

281
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 Very clever

282
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 The letter Z appears in 18 times as often in drug names as it does in other English words

283
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 Wow

284
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 Yeah

285
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 Because it seems speedy and powerful and memorable because it's weird

286
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 So what's the drug that's got Z in it?

287
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 To Mazepam to Mazepam

288
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 Wow

289
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 You see?

290
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 Oh yeah

291
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 Well that's not really how I feel when I take it

292
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 Have you guys had a breakfast mates?

293
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 No

294
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 No

295
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 This was a product, this is actually just more a disastrous product than a bad name

296
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 So it was launched in 1998, it was Kellogg's breakfast mates

297
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 And it was an all-in-one package with one serving of cereal, one tiny tiny carton of milk and one plastic spoon

298
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 And it was designed for people who find normal cereal just too inconvenient and too much of a hassle in the morning

299
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 That does sound quite good idea

300
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 Yeah, so you get on the train with your breakfast mates and you just pour out your cereal into the bowl and then then...

301
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 Anyway, basically they had neglected to realise that cereal is one of the most easy things to prepare

302
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 And there was testing which went on and it showed that preparing cereal the traditional way took one second longer than breakfast mates

303
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 It adds up

304
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is Chuzensky

305
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 My fact this week is that the scientist Robert Hook recorded in his diary every time he had an orgasm

306
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 So this is...

307
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 You might remember Robert Hook from school, you learn about Hook's law

308
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 I don't learn about this

309
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 Well, you actually do learn about Hook's law of elasticity which is a fail reference to this

310
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 He was a polymath, he was an unbelievably high-achieving scientist around at the same time as Newton

311
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 And he wrote extensive diaries where he recorded every detail of his life including his orgasms

312
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 And he had a sign for when he had an orgasm which was the sign of Pisces which is kind of sort of like a backward sea and then a sea back to back

313
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 And we actually are not 100% sure that it was all of them but we kind of assume people have used this as a basis of what his sex drive was

314
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 Yeah, so for instance in one of his diaries it says "played with Nell Pisces sign hurt small of back"

315
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 That could have been Twister, he was right

316
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 Another one went late to bed, Pisces sign in sleep, sweat much and disturbed

317
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 And then another one that made Wormwood wine, Pisces sign, Pisces sign

318
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 Oh!

319
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 Oh yeah, you're Robert

320
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 It's a good night

321
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 He's just bragging

322
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 Oh my goodness

323
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 But yeah, he was into it, he had a weird sex life actually, Hook

324
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 So he didn't really have relationships

325
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 It was kind of sad, he never had sex with someone who wasn't sort of financially dependent on him or dependent for a home

326
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 He used to have a lot of liaisons with servants and shagged them a lot like Nell

327
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 And then he had this weird relationship with Grace, his niece who was sent to live with him by his brother

328
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 Who was sent to live with him when she was 10 and then but she pretty much turned 16 and he was like

329
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 "Alright, you want to get off?"

330
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 "You want a Pisces sign?"

331
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 "You want a Pisces sign?"

332
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 He was incredible, I mean he sort of, someone described him as Leonardo da Vinci but without the paintings

333
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 Yeah

334
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 Which sounds pretty crap doesn't it but it was, it sort of, he worked on all these different fields

335
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 Like he invented a microscope and he used that to draw incredibly tiny things no one had seen before

336
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 Or he designed the monitors or he came up with telescopes

337
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 So he invented the word "cell"

338
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 Do you mean a tiny cell in a body?

339
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 It's pretty cool

340
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 He saw them, didn't he?

341
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 He looked in his microscope at some car and he saw these little, he named them after the cells that monks lived in

342
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 But he didn't know that what they did he thought they was to send liquid around the body or something like that

343
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 So he didn't really know what they were but he did give the name which is quite good

344
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 He invented some flyer machines in his diaries, he drew them, he invented the first pressure cooker

345
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 Cool, that's very nice for stuff

346
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 He sort of claimed to have flown

347
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 He experimented with lots of flyer machines on the grounds of modern college where he went to uni with his friends

348
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 He built all these machines and then he did write in his diary in 1674

349
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 Told Sir Robert Sutherl, his friend, told him I could fly but I didn't tell him how

350
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 Ten cans of Red Bull

351
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 He was a proper scientist and he did a lot of measurements and stuff like that

352
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 And in those days it was long thought that masturbation was extremely bad for you

353
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 And so one reason that he always mentioned it in his diaries is because it was like an ongoing appraisal of his health

354
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 So he'll be able to see how often it had happened and then he'll be able to see how he was feeling

355
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 Because he was a hypokundriac as well

356
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 No, no, I'm just conducting an ongoing appraisal of my health

357
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 Sure

358
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 Mom

359
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 It's an experiment

360
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 When you say he's likely an order without the paintings, interestingly, we don't know what he looks like

361
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 We have no idea, there were no surviving paintings of Robert Hook and that is very surprising because he was such a prominent person

362
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 The Royal Society particularly loved him every all the scientists, they didn't like him as a person

363
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 But they respected the hell out of what he did

364
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 His books were admired by peeps through to all the top scientists

365
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 And there is a rumor and it's definitely a rumor that the rivalry that happened between him and Isaac Newton was so great

366
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 That when Isaac Newton became the president of the Royal Society and at this point Hook had died

367
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 That he slashed all of the paintings of Robert Hook to say this was not someone we need to...

368
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 I don't think it's a rumor

369
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 I think that's widely accepted to have happened

370
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 I think that he probably did it

371
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 Yeah, we don't have evidence, I think there was one painting and he and Newton hated each other

372
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 They had a massive rivalry and Newton did erase him from scientific history for a long time

373
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 We all think Newton is the good guy and then he became president of the Royal Society who happened to have this painting

374
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 Which has disappeared ever since

375
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 You raised him but all that survived were the orgasms

376
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 Poor guy

377
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 If you get a UV light in the Royal Society, you can't see the evidence

378
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 It's all that's left of him, it's so sad

379
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 He sort of proceeded Newton in a theory of gravity, which is a bit vague of the Newton's

380
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 But he said the planets were attracted to each other, the sun and the planets were attracted to each other

381
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 He said gravity was a universal force and Newton claimed credit

382
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 His diary is also chronicled his flatulence

383
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 And it was always in conjunction with the barometric pressure of the area

384
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 As he thought that the two might be connected in some way

385
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 So he thought if it was low pressure, today there's a storm coming in, everyone would be fasting a lot more

386
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 That makes so much sense

387
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 It does make sense

388
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 Does that?

389
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 Is it true?

390
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 Yeah, it does because if it's low pressure, you would have thought that your gas goes from an area of high pressure to an area of low pressure out for your rectum

391
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 I reckon it's true

392
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 I think I'm on the news going, well we've been getting a lot of reports of flatulence from the area of Cardiff

393
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 No, it's over to Anna with the weather

394
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 One long fart, take your own breath around today

395
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 I mean, he also wrote a lot about, he was a hyperchondriacum

396
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 He said that he suffered from giddiness, indigestion, flatulence, blockages of the sinuses, sore eyes, noises in the head, insomnia

397
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 And he took all these different medicines which he wrote all about as well

398
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 So he took steel, iron oxide, opium, amber, purgitives

399
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 And whenever his medicine gave him constipation, he said he was cheated of a shit

400
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 That's a great phrase

401
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 He was basically a drug addict though, wasn't he?

402
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 Yeah, he was so ill, he took all the drugs

403
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 And in those days medical drugs were basically all the illegal drugs now

404
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 Like opium and cannabis and lordinum and stuff like that

405
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 There's one other thing he took, because science was in its infancy

406
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 He believes that a lot of rather dubious stuff

407
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 So he noted down that a thing called stercus humanum was really good for removing films or myths from the eyes

408
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 And stercus humanum is dried and powdered human poo

409
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 Apparently you were meant to blow it into your eyes and this would heal your eyes

410
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 Does it work?

411
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 It doesn't work

412
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 Actually, I haven't even checked that but I just think it's important to say

413
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 I think this is the moment that don't try this at home as inventive of it

414
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 On putting stuff in your eye, Samuel Peeps, the world's most famous diarist

415
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 who was around at the same time and who in fact met Hook

416
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 He only wrote his diary for nine years

417
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 I had no idea, it's so weird because he's basically the main source for everything I've ever read about the 1600s

418
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 And he wrote his diary from 1660s to 1669

419
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 When he panicked that he was going blind because he'd been writing it too much

420
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 And he quit and he never wrote another word because he said I'm going blind

421
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 The good god prepare me for this awful affliction, I'm on my way out

422
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 And then he lived for the 34 years without going blind

423
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 Without going blind

424
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 Wow, that's amazing

425
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 He did write amazing so he was famous I guess for the sex stuff

426
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 Like if there's any time you think of Peeps it was he wrote very much about his sex life in it

427
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 But he was an entry that I read

428
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 So I to bed and in the night was mightily troubled with a looseness and feeling for a chamber pot there was none

429
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 I, having called the maid up out of her bed, she had forgotten supposed to put one there

430
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 So I was forced in this strange house to rise and shit in the chimney twice

431
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 And so to bed and was very well again

432
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 How I wish I had been cheated of a shit

433
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 Wow

434
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 You know you prefaced that by saying he was into the sex stuff

435
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 Yeah

436
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 Okay

437
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 I'm

438
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 Revealed a bit too much from my diary there

439
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 Okay, we need to move to our final fact of the show and that is my fact

440
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 My fact this week is that Warty comb jellies grow a brand new anus every time they need to defecate

441
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 How cool is that?

442
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 So a Wart comb jelly is like a jellyfish but not it's a different species

443
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 But they look very similar if you saw it in the ocean and for a very long time we assumed they had an anus

444
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 And it's only just recent

445
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 This is almost breaking news in science and very exciting news because what they learn is that when it goes the toilet

446
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 This was a guy called Sydney Tam who was studying them very closely with microscopes

447
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 Every time they needed the toilet basically the waste bit pushed towards the edge of their body on the inside

448
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 And this anus grew out of nowhere and then soon as it was out it closed up again and then they are anusless once again

449
00:29:53,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 And because they poo once virtually every hour they grow 24 anuses every day

450
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 It sounds like you're pitching to be the new David Attenborough

451
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 But this is very exciting in science because it's a transient anus

452
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 It's never before it's been seen in any of living species that we have

453
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 Well there are a few transient anuses actually

454
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 It's only one of a handful of

455
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 This is the first scientific observation of what that was

456
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 We know of a few because we have mentioned one on the podcast actually there's a jaw worm who has a transient anus called haplog nathia

457
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 And there's also a microscopic creature called Limnog nathia which lives in a hot springs on disco island in Greenland

458
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 Cool

459
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 Transient anus on disco island

460
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 Nice

461
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 The research we found this is really cool

462
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 He works at a lab called woods hole which is interesting and he watched individual water comb jellies for hours

463
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 And he marked the times of their defecations and then when the time was exactly right for the next one he zoomed in with a microscope

464
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 And he found that he saw the wormhole opening basically

465
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 Wormhole

466
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 What it is kind of like a wormhole is like a stargate

467
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 They call it the ring of fusion don't they?

468
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 That's the process behind it when the canal and basically the way they think it happens is that basically it's all fused up

469
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 And then your anal canal swells and swells and swells and presses against your skin tissue

470
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 And eventually it creates a little orifice that that dilates

471
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 And then it sucks itself back in again

472
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 Dan said that it's a bit like a jellyfish

473
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 It certainly looks like a jellyfish but it's not related to a jellyfish in any way really

474
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 It is less related to a jellyfish than we are to a worm

475
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 That's because about 550 million years ago

476
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 The types of animals in the world were worms, sponges, jellyfish and comb jellies which is this type of jelly

477
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 And worms kind of turn into all the different animals and mammals and birds and lizards and everything

478
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 And the jellyfish and the comb jellies had already split off way before that

479
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 It's as different from a jelly as a tattoo parlour is from a cactus imporium

480
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 They are amazing comb jellies

481
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 And like you should look them up because they're also kind of beautiful

482
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 But the way they move is they have sillier

483
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 So you may remember sillier from school as well

484
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 There's tiny hairs we have on our nose and our lungs

485
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 And they use sillier, these little hairs, as oars to propel them along

486
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 And they're the biggest things that use them for movement

487
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 They run in combs in eight rows on their body

488
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 And yeah, the largest animal has to do it and the main jelly is almost six feet wide

489
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 So some of them can get quite big

490
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 But mostly that under 16 inches quite small

491
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 The eating method is very cool

492
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 I think it's not exactly those ones but there are things called beroid comb jellies

493
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 Because there are whole family, there are different members of the family

494
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 And beroid comb jellies, they eat their food before they kill it

495
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 So they're just basically a bag floating in the ocean

496
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 And if they spot some prey, which is normally another jelly

497
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 They just swallow it hot, they just open the mouth of the bag, swallow their prey

498
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 And then they just keep their mouth shut for as long as they can

499
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 While they're pulling their prey apart on the inside

500
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 They actually have mouths that reseal that basically disappear

501
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 Like zippers, they're described as or it's like a zip, yeah

502
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 So they open their mouths, which their mouths are about half of their body

503
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 So it's like a plastic bag opening

504
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 And they engulf this other jelly, often bigger than they are

505
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000
 And then they zip it shut and they probably fuse their mouths back together again

506
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 Until they're ready to eat

507
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 Wow, that's amazing

508
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 But these particular jellies that we are talking about, the ones with the transcontainers

509
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 They're called nemiopsis lady

510
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 And they are also known as sea walnuts and a few other things

511
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 Now these guys, they eat by again opening their mouth

512
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 But then when they open it, it creates almost like a current

513
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,000
 You know those rides when you're on like a donut and you're going really slowly down there

514
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
 So they start that kind of current, but it's so, so slow

515
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,000
 The things that get caught in this current don't even realize there's a current

516
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,000
 And they're just suddenly slowly, slowly floating to this place

517
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 And before they know it, they're eating, almost like a conveyor belt

518
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 That the food just comes in them and it comes in them

519
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 And they can eat an unbelievable amount of stuff

520
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 They can eat ten times their body weight in a day

521
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 And so they end up basically taking over lakes

522
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
 So there was some taken to the black sea by accident in some bilge water

523
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 And in less than a decade, the population in the black sea had gone, got a biomass of one billion tons

524
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 Which was ten times the weight of all the fish that were caught in the world that year

525
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 Wow, it's incredible, it's unbelievable

526
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 And weirdly we don't know a huge amount about them

527
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,000
 And really we thought there were five US species in there until recently

528
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 And that's partly because they're really hard to study because the moment you attempt to pick them up, they fall apart

529
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:07,000
 So there's, and genuinely they sort of melt in your hands

530
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 So I think there was a spotted cone jelly displayed in California's Monterey Bay Aquarium

531
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 And it was like literally water currents in the aquarium were just tear it into

532
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 So it's very difficult to collect

533
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 And this is actually, I was reading a piece about this Monterey Bay Aquarium

534
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 And the jellies that they collected, and the main marine biologists there was talking about them

535
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
 And he was also saying that they shimmer

536
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:38,000
 So when they have a light shone on them, then their little sillier break up the wavelengths of light

537
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
 And they reflect them, so they're sort of all rainbow colours

538
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 And that actually wouldn't happen in the wild, but it does when we shine a light on them

539
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 But the marine biologist at the aquarium, who talked about that, it's called Steve Haddock

540
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:58,000
 Nice! So lots of primitive life forms have only one hole in their bodies, and they have to eat through that, and excrete through that

541
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:03,000
 And the reason that we are better than them, and I'm just going to say it, I think we are better than them

542
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 I'm sorry, I'm going to go to the aquarium, but I do think we've got them beat all right

543
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:13,000
 So the reason that you need it is because if you have a through gut, which is what we've got

544
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:19,000
 If you don't have that, then you can't eat anything until you've excreted your previous meal

545
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 So it's very inefficient system

546
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
 So basically you can't have your lunch until you've pooed out your breakfast

547
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
 Exactly!

548
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 Oh!

549
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
 Exactly! Yes! I told you we were better than them

550
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 Just on sort of being able to regrow body parts

551
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 You know that we can regrow stuff, humans, we can regrow fingertips

552
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,000
 And especially children can regrow huge chunks of their fingers

553
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
 So children up to the age of ten can...

554
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,000
 It's not an advert for cutting off the fingertips of children

555
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
 It's not, don't try this at home, is it?

556
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:57,000
 Well you know, if they've broken the TV curfew, what else can you do?

557
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,000
 I suppose if you cut the fingertips off, they won't be able to use the remote control

558
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
 Can't use the remote, exactly!

559
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:10,000
 And if you can't off the fingertips, or if the fingertips of children under ten fall off, then...

560
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,000
 As is very likely to happen to each other

561
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
 As they do, it's a defence in court

562
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
 And you don't sew them up

563
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
 So what doctors tend to do is seal them up with flaps of skin

564
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
 So you've just got to sure to finger at that point

565
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
 But if you don't do that, then they'll tend to grow back

566
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,000
 And interestingly, they grow back, but they don't have a fingerprint, oddly

567
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,000
 And also the way they grow back, if there was any nail left at all, tiny bit of nail

568
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
 It will grow back, but it will grow back square

569
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
 Rather than over, which is how our nails grow

570
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
 So it grows back, 20s back

571
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
 Oh, I have that

572
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,000
 I have a slightly square fingertip, and that's because my finger got shut in the door when I was a baby

573
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
 Did you break the TV curfew?

574
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
 I didn't break the TV curfew

575
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
 I made sure to bring in all the tellies from the garden

576
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
 Right on time

577
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
 We're going to have to wrap up very soon

578
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
 Just one more thing, I'm afraid this is about the word...

579
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 It's about the word in the fact

580
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:09,000
 So there are old books, there are book scanners, which are designed to digitize very elderly books

581
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
 Books from the 19th, 18th century, that kind of thing, which no one's read

582
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
 And convert them into e-books, so they can be read

583
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:20,000
 Unfortunately, there are some book scanners, which cannot tell the difference between the word "arms" and the word "anus"

584
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,000
 And it literally can't tell it's asked from its elbow, isn't that pleasing?

585
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:29,000
 So this does make a number of old books quite exciting

586
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:34,000
 So, for example, Bertie, dear Bertie, will you not say goodnight to me?

587
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:39,000
 Pleaded the sweet voice of Minnie Hamilton as she wound her anus affectionately around her brother's neck

588
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:49,000
 When she spotted me, she flung her anus high in the air

589
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:54,000
 Oh boy, she said, she grabbed my anus and positioned my body in the direction of the East Gallery

590
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
 And we started walking

591
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:04,000
 I'm on the reading the Book of Farewell to anus online, actually, and I've really enjoyed it

592
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
 Brunbar comb jelly

593
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:12,000
