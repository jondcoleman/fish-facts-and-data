00:00:14,00:00:22,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Cardiff!"
00:00:22,00:00:26,[Cheering]
00:00:26,00:00:28,[Cheering]
00:00:28,00:00:36,"My name is Dan Schreiber and I am sitting here with Anish Zenski, Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin"
00:00:36,00:00:44,"and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go"
00:00:44,00:00:46,"starting with you, James"
00:00:46,00:00:52,Okay my fact this week is that the oldest football cup competition in Spain is the Coppa Del Rey
00:00:52,00:00:58,each year the winner gets the name engraved in the trophy in Comic Sans
00:00:58,00:01:02,The greatest font of them all
00:01:02,00:01:10,"So I don't know if you know who invented Comic Sans, anyone? Vincent Kaner and he did it into me recently"
00:01:10,00:01:16,and they asked him his favorite times at Comic Sans has been used so he said that it was in the Coppa Del Rey
00:01:16,00:01:24,in a photo album made by the Vatican and in the presentation by Surn to announce the discovery of the Higgs boson
00:01:24,00:01:30,"Yes but it wasn't a Vatican, they didn't announce the new Pope in Comic Sans or anything"
00:01:30,00:01:33,"No, they still did that with the smoke"
00:01:33,00:01:36,If you could do the smoke in Comic Sans
00:01:36,00:01:40,It was a lovely photo album that they gave to the Pope
00:01:40,00:01:44,So it was the Vatican's present to him and it was all the captions
00:01:44,00:01:47,"The best way to caption a book, Comic Sans, there's no question"
00:01:47,00:01:50,"You know he's only ever used it once, he said it's Vincent Kaner"
00:01:50,00:01:53,He said he's used Comic Sans once in his life
00:01:53,00:01:58,It was when I was having trouble changing my broadband to sky so I wrote the molestering Comic Sans complaining
00:01:58,00:02:01,"saying I was disappointed, he got Â£10 refund"
00:02:01,00:02:03,So he's sold
00:02:03,00:02:10,"He's very bullish about it, he's done talks like a Ted talk or something saying"
00:02:10,00:02:14,My name is Vincent Kaner and I've invented the best font in the world
00:02:14,00:02:17,"And if people don't like it, he pushes back"
00:02:17,00:02:22,"So he said, if you love Comic Sans then you don't know anything about typography"
00:02:22,00:02:28,But if you hate Comic Sans then you don't know anything about typography either
00:02:28,00:02:30,Where should you stand?
00:02:30,00:02:31,Unbiveness
00:02:31,00:02:32,"I think so, yeah"
00:02:32,00:02:37,"And he also, he has a thing where he loves the hatred for Comic Sans as well"
00:02:37,00:02:41,He really thrives off it and he collects examples of people's furies
00:02:41,00:02:44,"So he was doing an interview again and he said, interesting fact"
00:02:44,00:02:49,The main designer at Twitter tweeted that the most server space is used by complaints
00:02:49,00:02:54,"First about airlines, second, Comic Sans, third, Justin Bieber"
00:02:54,00:02:58,"And then he says, so not even the Bieber can be Comic Sans"
00:02:58,00:03:01,He's said it's like Bieber
00:03:01,00:03:04,He has said it's the Justin Bieber of fonts
00:03:04,00:03:08,"Most people love him, but a lot of people wouldn't say it's the best music"
00:03:08,00:03:12,"It's fair enough, that's an controversial opinion here in Cardiff anyway"
00:03:12,00:03:18,He said that he once went to the design museum in London and had to have a bodyguard
00:03:18,00:03:20,Did he help?
00:03:20,00:03:22,"Well he said that, I don't know, he maybe he was joking"
00:03:22,00:03:27,"But just an interesting fact, his boss at Microsoft when he did that was Rob Norton"
00:03:27,00:03:31,Who was the son of Mary Norton who wrote the borrower's
00:03:31,00:03:36,And also after he did Comic Sans he designed the Ministry of Sound logo
00:03:36,00:03:38,"Yeah, a few minutes of trivia"
00:03:38,00:03:44,There's this thing about Comic Sans that gets claimed which is that the reason it's used in schools and teachers like it is because it makes children read better
00:03:44,00:03:50,And it's very good for dyslexic children because partly because the writing is very slightly unclear
00:03:50,00:03:55,So it takes you longer to read it and the theory is that makes you remember it better
00:03:55,00:03:58,But that's been shown to be Bullocks
00:03:58,00:04:04,"So teachers don't write in, there is a font called Sans Fogettica"
00:04:04,00:04:09,And that was developed last year which tries to achieve what people claim Comic Sans does
00:04:09,00:04:11,"And so that's the typeface, you should look at it, it's quite cool"
00:04:11,00:04:14,That's quite difficult to read because it's got lots of gaps in the letters
00:04:14,00:04:18,And it just means it takes a bit more concentration to read it
00:04:18,00:04:23,But it is true that your retention of whatever's written there if it's in Sans Fogettica is much better
00:04:23,00:04:27,So is it that if you have something important you should write it in Sans Fogettica?
00:04:27,00:04:28,Yes
00:04:28,00:04:34,Because it feels like quite a risk if you're writing something important is something that people have to read like an emergency sign or an exit sign
00:04:34,00:04:38,And just saying you should write it with bits missing so people really focus on it
00:04:38,00:04:44,"If it's something you have to remember in future, if it's something you need to know now then maybe just write it in Times New Roman"
00:04:44,00:04:48,There's this thing just on that about how you read
00:04:48,00:04:53,"So when you read I didn't know this, you're jumping all the time between the words"
00:04:53,00:05:00,"Otherwise when you read a story you just go once, once, once, once, once"
00:05:00,00:05:03,"Make the leap James, make it"
00:05:03,00:05:06,"Once upon, once upon, once upon"
00:05:06,00:05:08,"Okay, okay"
00:05:08,00:05:10,"No, I walked into that and that's fair"
00:05:10,00:05:14,So you're doing these things called I think it's sacades or sacades
00:05:14,00:05:17,And fixations which is jumps and pauses
00:05:17,00:05:22,"And if you're reading fluently, what you turns out you don't really look at the whole word when you read it"
00:05:22,00:05:26,You look slightly to the left of the middle of the word you're reading
00:05:26,00:05:29,"And you then sort of, you see the immediate letters around it"
00:05:29,00:05:33,And then you kind of guess the other letters as you jump from one thing to another
00:05:33,00:05:35,"That's so true, that is happening right now"
00:05:35,00:05:39,"This is live reading, welcome"
00:05:39,00:05:40,"Wow, yeah"
00:05:40,00:05:49,"So in the, in 2008, John McCain, when he was running for president, he chose Optimer as his font for his signs"
00:05:49,00:05:53,Because it was the same typeface used on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial
00:05:53,00:05:55,"Oh, that was his idea"
00:05:55,00:06:01,"Obama used Gotham, which has been described as friendly without being folksy, confident without being aloof"
00:06:01,00:06:03,Wow
00:06:03,00:06:08,"Which is crazy, because it's like a Gotham villain came into power right after him"
00:06:08,00:06:14,"Well, yeah, actually Trump's campaign font was called Accidents Grotesque"
00:06:14,00:06:20,Honestly true
00:06:20,00:06:25,"That's a designer having a laugh or something, isn't it? That's amazing"
00:06:25,00:06:27,You know there are font detectives?
00:06:27,00:06:28,"No, yeah"
00:06:28,00:06:30,There are font detectives
00:06:30,00:06:32,Why? Well
00:06:32,00:06:35,So I'm looking at it as like we could possibly work out what that is
00:06:35,00:06:39,So if a font goes missing?
00:06:39,00:06:40,Yeah
00:06:40,00:06:44,"If it sounds forgettiger, just completely disappeared"
00:06:44,00:06:46,"No, it's not quite that"
00:06:46,00:06:51,It's people who determine whether documents are authentic by analyzing the fonts in them
00:06:51,00:06:54,"So if the Dead Sea Scrolls are in Comic Sans, they're probably not"
00:06:54,00:06:55,Exactly
00:06:55,00:06:59,"So this guy Thomas Finney, he writes all these stories about his cases"
00:06:59,00:07:03,"And he writes them up like their Sherlock Holmes stories, it's pretty cool"
00:07:03,00:07:08,"So for example, in 1999, this lawyer got in touch with him because he was looking at a will"
00:07:08,00:07:11,"And he was trying to walk out, is this will real or hasn't been altered"
00:07:11,00:07:18,"And Finney discovered that the will was dated 1983, but it was printed by a high-res inkjet printer"
00:07:18,00:07:21,Which wasn't on the market until 1988
00:07:21,00:07:22,Right
00:07:22,00:07:24,"So, that's good"
00:07:24,00:07:25,That's very good
00:07:25,00:07:28,"But that's more like a printer detective, isn't it?"
00:07:28,00:07:29,Yeah
00:07:29,00:07:34,"Yeah, it was an extremely poor example from a wide-port photo of his career"
00:07:34,00:07:40,"On Dead People in France, one of the things that the campaign against Comic Sans hates the most"
00:07:40,00:07:45,"So this is a campaign that's set up by Holly and David Combs or Combs, so I think we've mentioned before"
00:07:45,00:07:48,But they say it just doesn't look great in a lot of places
00:07:48,00:07:53,"For instance, as David Combs, a place where it doesn't look great in my opinion is on a tombstone"
00:07:53,00:07:55,And I have seen a number of those
00:07:55,00:07:58,So there are tombstones up there with Comic Sans?
00:07:58,00:08:05,"There's actually a website you can go to called Comic Sans Criminal, where it sort of lists all of the most heinous crimes of Comic Sans"
00:08:05,00:08:08,"And it asks you, the reader, are you a criminal?"
00:08:08,00:08:11,"And it shows you examples, do you agree with this kind of thing?"
00:08:11,00:08:16,"And there was a, the opening hours for a sex offender's register office"
00:08:16,00:08:22,"Sorry, where's sex offender's register?"
00:08:22,00:08:23,Yeah
00:08:23,00:08:24,Really?
00:08:24,00:08:29,"Yeah, there was a defibrillator as well, which just looked really fun"
00:08:29,00:08:33,"There is a theory that this sort of, the whole reason that Comic Sans became huge"
00:08:33,00:08:39,"Is that it was a font that was launched, it was designed for this product called Microsoft Bob, which actually it ended up not being included with it"
00:08:39,00:08:44,"But it did get included as a package in Windows 95, I think"
00:08:44,00:08:49,And this was the first time that all of us could do type setting
00:08:49,00:08:55,"You know, before that you needed to go to a designer, and then this, and people have described this as a massive shift in power"
00:08:55,00:08:59,"You know, democratisation of type setting, it's basically like, what's his name?"
00:08:59,00:09:00,Gutenberg?
00:09:00,00:09:01,Mmm
00:09:01,00:09:03,It's like the second print revolution
00:09:03,00:09:08,"What you're saying is basically when you give people democratic choice, they end up doing something stupid"
00:09:08,00:09:11,Well
00:09:16,00:09:20,"You wouldn't have said that on our Sunderland gig, would you?"
00:09:20,00:09:26,We're gonna have to move on to our next fac soon
00:09:26,00:09:31,A lot of couple of things about just other weird trophy decisions
00:09:31,00:09:40,"There's a NASCAR sprint cup race that's in Mardensville, and their trophy that they give out is a grandfather clock"
00:09:40,00:09:44,"It's just a giant grandfather clock, that's what you win"
00:09:44,00:09:49,"And that started in 1964, it was given as a prize, everyone loved it so much"
00:09:49,00:09:53,"And it's a big thing, it's a big thing to get a grandfather clock, until you get too many"
00:09:53,00:09:56,"There was a guy called Dale Ehrenhardt, Jr, who took home six"
00:09:56,00:10:00,"Didn't really, I just kept winning and it got to the point where it's like"
00:10:00,00:10:02,Do I just throw this one?
00:10:02,00:10:04,Now are you lifting that up?
00:10:04,00:10:07,"Well you can't at the podium, yeah, it's a bit, it's a bit full on"
00:10:07,00:10:14,"I like, you know, there's a trophy that's given out, a ASCAR, ladies' day, to the owner of the winning race horse"
00:10:14,00:10:17,"Which is, it's like the main event, really, an ASCAR isn't it"
00:10:17,00:10:20,And the trophy is presented by the queen
00:10:20,00:10:24,But that causes a problem when she wins it
00:10:24,00:10:29,"So she has won it before, and Anne Prince Andrew did step in to play the role of the queen"
00:10:29,00:10:31,Presenting it to the queen for that
00:10:31,00:10:35,"But did he play, which queen did he play? Did he play the presenting queen?"
00:10:35,00:10:42,"He played the one giving the trophy, and then she played the one, well she was the one receiving the trophy"
00:10:42,00:10:47,"Just done a fonts, it's always good idea to choose the right fonts"
00:10:47,00:10:50,Because there's a company called Bell Sheek
00:10:50,00:10:53,"And they had a bag that said ""My favourite colour is glitter"""
00:10:53,00:10:58,"But they chose the wrong fonts and it looked like ""My favourite colour is Hitler"""
00:10:58,00:11:06,"Oh, as a couple of years ago, and then last Christmas, Iceland chose the wrong fonts and appeared to be selling ming pies"
00:11:06,00:11:16,"Okay, it's time for fact number two, and that is Andy"
00:11:16,00:11:23,"My fact is, the American product, ""Trockful O Nuts"" contains no nuts"
00:11:23,00:11:30,"It's a coffee product that the firm used to sell nuts, and then they sold nuts and coffee"
00:11:30,00:11:36,"And then they stopped selling the nuts, but they thought ""Well the name is so good that we just have to keep the ""Trockful O Nuts"" name"
00:11:36,00:11:42,"Actually on the cans sometimes, some of the cans it says, ""1920s, we sold nuts"
00:11:42,00:11:50,"1930s, we sold nuts and coffee. Now we don't sell nuts, we just sell coffee, but we like our name"
00:11:50,00:11:54,And it has a massive disclaimer saying contains no nuts
00:11:54,00:11:58,"And yet, every time the firm does any market research on why people might not buy it"
00:11:58,00:12:02,"People always say, ""I was probably nuts at it, aren't they? It's probably nuts, this is ""Trockful O Nuts"""
00:12:02,00:12:09,"But it's a New York product, isn't it? And if you said if there was a New Yorker near you, and you said ""Trockful O Nuts"""
00:12:09,00:12:12,"They would say ""Yeah, I know it has no nuts"" and it's a big thing"
00:12:12,00:12:17,It was as soon as they started going out into other cities and countries that became a problem for them
00:12:17,00:12:20,So they actually existed fine without putting it on
00:12:20,00:12:23,"Yeah, they have a picture of the New York skyline as well on their packets"
00:12:23,00:12:26,But they don't name it as the New York skyline
00:12:26,00:12:30,"And their head of marketing said that it's nice, it worked perfectly for us"
00:12:30,00:12:33,Because people in New York see the New York skyline and think this is for me
00:12:33,00:12:35,"And then outside of New York, they have no idea what the New York skyline looks like"
00:12:35,00:12:37,"So they just think, ""Yeah, fine"""
00:12:37,00:12:42,"And he's run focus groups all around America saying, ""Would you object to something that said New York on it?"""
00:12:42,00:12:47,"And they all say ""Yes"" and then he says ""Why?"" and they say ""Oh, I think it beats our sports teams"""
00:12:47,00:12:50,"And that's it, that's the reason they won't eat nuts"
00:12:50,00:12:52,They're on any nuts in it
00:12:52,00:12:55,You're falling right into the gym
00:12:55,00:12:58,Have we said what it is? It's a coffee
00:12:58,00:13:00,So it started by a guy called William Black
00:13:00,00:13:04,He rented a little space under a staircase in New York
00:13:04,00:13:06,But it was underneath a drugstore
00:13:06,00:13:09,And he wasn't allowed to sell anything that was sold in the drugstore
00:13:09,00:13:13,"So he didn't know what to sell, but there was a theatre opposite, so he decided to sell nuts"
00:13:13,00:13:18,"But then when the Great Depression struck, according to the website, nuts seemed too much of a luxury"
00:13:18,00:13:20,And so he had to find something else
00:13:20,00:13:22,But he had a roasting machine for the nuts
00:13:22,00:13:28,"And so he decided to go down to the docks by green coffee beans, roast them themselves and make coffee"
00:13:28,00:13:30,"And sandwiches, right?"
00:13:30,00:13:31,"And sandwiches, yes"
00:13:31,00:13:37,And we spoke a few weeks ago about how sandwiches that no human-handed touched were a selling point
00:13:37,00:13:40,"In those days, because it meant that it hadn't got any germs on it"
00:13:40,00:13:44,"And he used to sell his sandwiches, advertised as untouched by human hands"
00:13:44,00:13:47,"And even when they were making the sandwiches, they had to do it with tongs"
00:13:47,00:13:50,So you had to spread the mayonnaise with one tong and put the ham on with another
00:13:50,00:13:55,"And actually, they probably do that in cafes still, I don't know, I think, but hygiene"
00:13:55,00:13:59,"As I said it, I thought that doesn't sound that mad"
00:13:59,00:14:03,"So just sort of product names, basically"
00:14:03,00:14:08,"And this is a big thing, especially in America, so there's a cereal called fruit loops"
00:14:08,00:14:10,But fruit is spelled F-R-O-O-T
00:14:10,00:14:13,And there's also cap and crunch with crunch berries
00:14:13,00:14:18,And these have been the subjects of repeated lawsuits from people who claimed I've been deceived
00:14:18,00:14:21,I thought this was full of fruit and really good for me
00:14:21,00:14:26,"And the whole statement by judges saying things like, here's one from 2009"
00:14:26,00:14:32,This court is not aware of nor has plaintiff alleged the existence of any actual fruit referred to as a crunch berry
00:14:32,00:14:38,"Furthermore, the crunch berry is depicted on the box around crunchy brightly coloured cereal balls"
00:14:38,00:14:45,"So far as this court has been made aware, there is no such fruit growing in the wild or occurring naturally in any part of the world"
00:14:45,00:14:52,"You've got to be so careful though, because I red bull got sued in 2014 for the fact that they don't actually give you wings"
00:14:52,00:14:53,There was a proper...
00:14:53,00:14:54,"No, yeah, yeah, come on"
00:14:54,00:14:59,"It was a mixture of a... that was one guy who's part of the court case who said, I didn't actually grow any wings"
00:14:59,00:15:03,The rest said it claims that it gives you this great energy and it gives you these boosts
00:15:03,00:15:06,And so they actually had to pay out a huge amount of money
00:15:06,00:15:13,Including $10 to every US consumer who'd bought the drinks since 2002 if they wrote in
00:15:13,00:15:14,"Really, yeah"
00:15:14,00:15:22,I remember though as once some sausages sold in Wales called dragon sausages that had to be taken off because they didn't contain any dragons
00:15:22,00:15:23,Is that true?
00:15:23,00:15:24,"That's true, yeah"
00:15:24,00:15:29,"Very disappointing for the card of audience, thought you've been eating dragons all these years"
00:15:29,00:15:36,There's a hair product in... I think in the US called Rogaine and it was originally called Regaine
00:15:36,00:15:41,"And then the FDA, the Food and Drugs Administrator, next that, because they said you can't call it Regaine"
00:15:41,00:15:44,"Because obviously it doesn't work, because hair-regraith products don't work"
00:15:44,00:15:46,So you don't have to change the vows
00:15:46,00:15:52,There was a tattoo artist in London whose salon was called Prick
00:15:52,00:15:55,He was called Henry Hate
00:15:55,00:16:00,And he tried to stop a nearby cactus shop from using the same name
00:16:00,00:16:06,"And this guy, Henry Hate, is kind of semi-famous because he did a lot of Amy Winehouse's tattoos"
00:16:06,00:16:12,And he thought that this person with a cactus shop was kind of passing off with his edgy rock and roll name
00:16:12,00:16:15,But then it went to court and court judge Melissa Clark said
00:16:15,00:16:21,"""It is difficult to imagine two businesses with two less closely related activities"
00:16:21,00:16:23,I think it's fair
00:16:23,00:16:27,I can imagine two things less similar than tattoos and cactuses
00:16:27,00:16:34,Like a waffle maker and then a sort of like a Rolls-Royce engine firm
00:16:34,00:16:38,"And if I had a bit longer I could have come up with something really, really different"
00:16:38,00:16:41,"I guess they're both round, don't they? So it doesn't really work"
00:16:41,00:16:42,Yeah
00:16:42,00:16:44,Well
00:16:44,00:16:53,"Just on that very similar note, in 2018 rapper Dr. Dre lost a trademark case to another man called Dr. Dre"
00:16:53,00:16:57,Who was written books including 20 things you might not know about the vagina
00:16:57,00:17:04,And the judge in that case said that confusion was unlikely as Dr. Dre is not a medical doctor
00:17:04,00:17:07,Nor is he qualified to provide any type of medical service
00:17:07,00:17:13,But they should get together because I would listen to a Dr. Dre rap about 20 things you might not know about
00:17:13,00:17:14,The vagina
00:17:14,00:17:17,"To be honest, I think there's quite a lot of that in his rap"
00:17:17,00:17:21,It's just on the famous names thing
00:17:21,00:17:29,"They're in Australia at the moment, there's a pop-up burger place which a lot of people trying to not shut down but get them to change their name"
00:17:29,00:17:31,They're called Pablo Escoburgers
00:17:31,00:17:39,And when you buy a burger from Pablo Escoburgers you get a fake line of white powder
00:17:39,00:17:46,It's like a garlic flower that's on top of the bun and then there's a rolled up $100 note next to it
00:17:46,00:17:49,Presumably a fake $100 note
00:17:49,00:17:50,No real?
00:17:50,00:17:51,It's real?
00:17:51,00:17:53,"Yeah, fake, definitely fake"
00:17:53,00:17:58,"The passing off thing is quite, it's really well established, so for example, we've mentioned on the bogus before"
00:17:58,00:18:04,The first ever self-service supermarket are you one way you get a basket and you go around or trolley and you go around putting things in
00:18:04,00:18:10,"Going to a counter and handing over a list, the first ever of those in America was called Piggly Wiggly"
00:18:10,00:18:12,And that was a fun novelty name
00:18:12,00:18:16,But it was immediately followed by another firm setting up called Hoggley Woggley
00:18:16,00:18:20,And then helpy selfie and then savey wavy
00:18:20,00:18:22,And these are all completely different firms
00:18:22,00:18:29,Do you know that the Food and Drugs Administration in America when people are coming up with names for new drugs
00:18:29,00:18:35,"They run it through a whole bunch of handwriting tests, so they get those people in to write the drugs in certain types of hand-racing"
00:18:35,00:18:39,To make sure that they can never be mistaken in certain handwriting for other drugs
00:18:39,00:18:40,Oh really?
00:18:40,00:18:41,That's really clever
00:18:41,00:18:42,Very clever
00:18:42,00:18:48,The letter Z appears in 18 times as often in drug names as it does in other English words
00:18:48,00:18:49,Wow
00:18:49,00:18:50,Yeah
00:18:50,00:18:54,Because it seems speedy and powerful and memorable because it's weird
00:18:54,00:18:56,So what's the drug that's got Z in it?
00:18:56,00:18:58,To Mazepam to Mazepam
00:18:58,00:18:59,Wow
00:18:59,00:19:00,You see?
00:19:00,00:19:01,Oh yeah
00:19:01,00:19:03,Well that's not really how I feel when I take it
00:19:03,00:19:06,Have you guys had a breakfast mates?
00:19:06,00:19:07,No
00:19:07,00:19:08,No
00:19:08,00:19:11,"This was a product, this is actually just more a disastrous product than a bad name"
00:19:11,00:19:15,"So it was launched in 1998, it was Kellogg's breakfast mates"
00:19:15,00:19:21,"And it was an all-in-one package with one serving of cereal, one tiny tiny carton of milk and one plastic spoon"
00:19:21,00:19:28,And it was designed for people who find normal cereal just too inconvenient and too much of a hassle in the morning
00:19:28,00:19:29,That does sound quite good idea
00:19:29,00:19:34,"Yeah, so you get on the train with your breakfast mates and you just pour out your cereal into the bowl and then then..."
00:19:34,00:19:39,"Anyway, basically they had neglected to realise that cereal is one of the most easy things to prepare"
00:19:39,00:19:48,And there was testing which went on and it showed that preparing cereal the traditional way took one second longer than breakfast mates
00:19:48,00:19:51,It adds up
00:19:51,00:19:57,"Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is Chuzensky"
00:19:57,00:20:03,My fact this week is that the scientist Robert Hook recorded in his diary every time he had an orgasm
00:20:03,00:20:06,So this is...
00:20:06,00:20:10,"You might remember Robert Hook from school, you learn about Hook's law"
00:20:10,00:20:12,I don't learn about this
00:20:12,00:20:20,"Well, you actually do learn about Hook's law of elasticity which is a fail reference to this"
00:20:20,00:20:26,"He was a polymath, he was an unbelievably high-achieving scientist around at the same time as Newton"
00:20:26,00:20:32,And he wrote extensive diaries where he recorded every detail of his life including his orgasms
00:20:32,00:20:40,And he had a sign for when he had an orgasm which was the sign of Pisces which is kind of sort of like a backward sea and then a sea back to back
00:20:40,00:20:49,And we actually are not 100% sure that it was all of them but we kind of assume people have used this as a basis of what his sex drive was
00:20:49,00:20:59,"Yeah, so for instance in one of his diaries it says ""played with Nell Pisces sign hurt small of back"""
00:20:59,00:21:02,"That could have been Twister, he was right"
00:21:02,00:21:09,"Another one went late to bed, Pisces sign in sleep, sweat much and disturbed"
00:21:09,00:21:14,"And then another one that made Wormwood wine, Pisces sign, Pisces sign"
00:21:14,00:21:16,Oh!
00:21:16,00:21:18,"Oh yeah, you're Robert"
00:21:18,00:21:19,It's a good night
00:21:19,00:21:21,He's just bragging
00:21:21,00:21:23,Oh my goodness
00:21:23,00:21:27,"But yeah, he was into it, he had a weird sex life actually, Hook"
00:21:27,00:21:29,So he didn't really have relationships
00:21:29,00:21:36,"It was kind of sad, he never had sex with someone who wasn't sort of financially dependent on him or dependent for a home"
00:21:36,00:21:40,He used to have a lot of liaisons with servants and shagged them a lot like Nell
00:21:40,00:21:47,"And then he had this weird relationship with Grace, his niece who was sent to live with him by his brother"
00:21:47,00:21:51,Who was sent to live with him when she was 10 and then but she pretty much turned 16 and he was like
00:21:51,00:21:53,"""Alright, you want to get off?"""
00:21:53,00:21:54,"""You want a Pisces sign?"""
00:21:54,00:21:57,"""You want a Pisces sign?"""
00:21:57,00:22:05,"He was incredible, I mean he sort of, someone described him as Leonardo da Vinci but without the paintings"
00:22:05,00:22:06,Yeah
00:22:06,00:22:13,"Which sounds pretty crap doesn't it but it was, it sort of, he worked on all these different fields"
00:22:13,00:22:18,Like he invented a microscope and he used that to draw incredibly tiny things no one had seen before
00:22:18,00:22:22,Or he designed the monitors or he came up with telescopes
00:22:22,00:22:24,"So he invented the word ""cell"""
00:22:24,00:22:27,Do you mean a tiny cell in a body?
00:22:27,00:22:28,It's pretty cool
00:22:28,00:22:29,"He saw them, didn't he?"
00:22:29,00:22:33,"He looked in his microscope at some car and he saw these little, he named them after the cells that monks lived in"
00:22:33,00:22:38,But he didn't know that what they did he thought they was to send liquid around the body or something like that
00:22:38,00:22:41,So he didn't really know what they were but he did give the name which is quite good
00:22:41,00:22:47,"He invented some flyer machines in his diaries, he drew them, he invented the first pressure cooker"
00:22:47,00:22:49,"Cool, that's very nice for stuff"
00:22:49,00:22:51,He sort of claimed to have flown
00:22:51,00:22:57,He experimented with lots of flyer machines on the grounds of modern college where he went to uni with his friends
00:22:57,00:23:00,He built all these machines and then he did write in his diary in 1674
00:23:00,00:23:07,"Told Sir Robert Sutherl, his friend, told him I could fly but I didn't tell him how"
00:23:07,00:23:12,Ten cans of Red Bull
00:23:12,00:23:16,He was a proper scientist and he did a lot of measurements and stuff like that
00:23:16,00:23:20,And in those days it was long thought that masturbation was extremely bad for you
00:23:20,00:23:26,And so one reason that he always mentioned it in his diaries is because it was like an ongoing appraisal of his health
00:23:26,00:23:31,So he'll be able to see how often it had happened and then he'll be able to see how he was feeling
00:23:31,00:23:33,Because he was a hypokundriac as well
00:23:33,00:23:36,"No, no, I'm just conducting an ongoing appraisal of my health"
00:23:36,00:23:37,Sure
00:23:37,00:23:39,Mom
00:23:39,00:23:42,It's an experiment
00:23:42,00:23:50,"When you say he's likely an order without the paintings, interestingly, we don't know what he looks like"
00:23:50,00:23:58,"We have no idea, there were no surviving paintings of Robert Hook and that is very surprising because he was such a prominent person"
00:23:58,00:24:03,"The Royal Society particularly loved him every all the scientists, they didn't like him as a person"
00:24:03,00:24:05,But they respected the hell out of what he did
00:24:05,00:24:09,His books were admired by peeps through to all the top scientists
00:24:09,00:24:16,And there is a rumor and it's definitely a rumor that the rivalry that happened between him and Isaac Newton was so great
00:24:16,00:24:22,That when Isaac Newton became the president of the Royal Society and at this point Hook had died
00:24:22,00:24:28,That he slashed all of the paintings of Robert Hook to say this was not someone we need to...
00:24:28,00:24:29,I don't think it's a rumor
00:24:29,00:24:31,I think that's widely accepted to have happened
00:24:31,00:24:33,I think that he probably did it
00:24:33,00:24:37,"Yeah, we don't have evidence, I think there was one painting and he and Newton hated each other"
00:24:37,00:24:42,They had a massive rivalry and Newton did erase him from scientific history for a long time
00:24:42,00:24:47,We all think Newton is the good guy and then he became president of the Royal Society who happened to have this painting
00:24:47,00:24:49,Which has disappeared ever since
00:24:49,00:24:52,You raised him but all that survived were the orgasms
00:24:52,00:24:54,Poor guy
00:24:54,00:24:59,"If you get a UV light in the Royal Society, you can't see the evidence"
00:24:59,00:25:07,"It's all that's left of him, it's so sad"
00:25:07,00:25:15,"He sort of proceeded Newton in a theory of gravity, which is a bit vague of the Newton's"
00:25:15,00:25:19,"But he said the planets were attracted to each other, the sun and the planets were attracted to each other"
00:25:19,00:25:22,He said gravity was a universal force and Newton claimed credit
00:25:22,00:25:25,His diary is also chronicled his flatulence
00:25:25,00:25:30,And it was always in conjunction with the barometric pressure of the area
00:25:30,00:25:33,As he thought that the two might be connected in some way
00:25:33,00:25:40,"So he thought if it was low pressure, today there's a storm coming in, everyone would be fasting a lot more"
00:25:40,00:25:43,That makes so much sense
00:25:43,00:25:44,It does make sense
00:25:44,00:25:45,Does that?
00:25:45,00:25:46,Is it true?
00:25:46,00:25:52,"Yeah, it does because if it's low pressure, you would have thought that your gas goes from an area of high pressure to an area of low pressure out for your rectum"
00:25:52,00:25:54,I reckon it's true
00:25:54,00:26:00,"I think I'm on the news going, well we've been getting a lot of reports of flatulence from the area of Cardiff"
00:26:00,00:26:03,"No, it's over to Anna with the weather"
00:26:03,00:26:07,"One long fart, take your own breath around today"
00:26:07,00:26:16,"I mean, he also wrote a lot about, he was a hyperchondriacum"
00:26:16,00:26:24,"He said that he suffered from giddiness, indigestion, flatulence, blockages of the sinuses, sore eyes, noises in the head, insomnia"
00:26:24,00:26:28,And he took all these different medicines which he wrote all about as well
00:26:28,00:26:32,"So he took steel, iron oxide, opium, amber, purgitives"
00:26:32,00:26:37,"And whenever his medicine gave him constipation, he said he was cheated of a shit"
00:26:37,00:26:41,That's a great phrase
00:26:41,00:26:43,"He was basically a drug addict though, wasn't he?"
00:26:43,00:26:45,"Yeah, he was so ill, he took all the drugs"
00:26:45,00:26:49,And in those days medical drugs were basically all the illegal drugs now
00:26:49,00:26:52,Like opium and cannabis and lordinum and stuff like that
00:26:52,00:26:55,"There's one other thing he took, because science was in its infancy"
00:26:55,00:26:58,He believes that a lot of rather dubious stuff
00:26:58,00:27:04,So he noted down that a thing called stercus humanum was really good for removing films or myths from the eyes
00:27:04,00:27:08,And stercus humanum is dried and powdered human poo
00:27:08,00:27:14,Apparently you were meant to blow it into your eyes and this would heal your eyes
00:27:14,00:27:15,Does it work?
00:27:15,00:27:17,It doesn't work
00:27:17,00:27:22,"Actually, I haven't even checked that but I just think it's important to say"
00:27:22,00:27:26,I think this is the moment that don't try this at home as inventive of it
00:27:26,00:27:31,"On putting stuff in your eye, Samuel Peeps, the world's most famous diarist"
00:27:31,00:27:35,who was around at the same time and who in fact met Hook
00:27:35,00:27:38,He only wrote his diary for nine years
00:27:38,00:27:44,"I had no idea, it's so weird because he's basically the main source for everything I've ever read about the 1600s"
00:27:44,00:27:47,And he wrote his diary from 1660s to 1669
00:27:47,00:27:51,When he panicked that he was going blind because he'd been writing it too much
00:27:51,00:27:55,And he quit and he never wrote another word because he said I'm going blind
00:27:55,00:27:59,"The good god prepare me for this awful affliction, I'm on my way out"
00:27:59,00:28:03,And then he lived for the 34 years without going blind
00:28:03,00:28:04,Without going blind
00:28:04,00:28:05,"Wow, that's amazing"
00:28:05,00:28:08,He did write amazing so he was famous I guess for the sex stuff
00:28:08,00:28:14,Like if there's any time you think of Peeps it was he wrote very much about his sex life in it
00:28:14,00:28:15,But he was an entry that I read
00:28:15,00:28:23,So I to bed and in the night was mightily troubled with a looseness and feeling for a chamber pot there was none
00:28:23,00:28:28,"I, having called the maid up out of her bed, she had forgotten supposed to put one there"
00:28:28,00:28:34,So I was forced in this strange house to rise and shit in the chimney twice
00:28:34,00:28:40,And so to bed and was very well again
00:28:42,00:28:46,How I wish I had been cheated of a shit
00:28:46,00:28:47,Wow
00:28:47,00:28:50,You know you prefaced that by saying he was into the sex stuff
00:28:50,00:28:51,Yeah
00:28:51,00:28:52,Okay
00:28:52,00:28:54,I'm
00:28:54,00:28:58,Revealed a bit too much from my diary there
00:28:58,00:29:03,"Okay, we need to move to our final fact of the show and that is my fact"
00:29:03,00:29:11,My fact this week is that Warty comb jellies grow a brand new anus every time they need to defecate
00:29:11,00:29:13,How cool is that?
00:29:13,00:29:17,So a Wart comb jelly is like a jellyfish but not it's a different species
00:29:17,00:29:24,But they look very similar if you saw it in the ocean and for a very long time we assumed they had an anus
00:29:24,00:29:26,And it's only just recent
00:29:26,00:29:33,This is almost breaking news in science and very exciting news because what they learn is that when it goes the toilet
00:29:33,00:29:37,This was a guy called Sydney Tam who was studying them very closely with microscopes
00:29:37,00:29:44,Every time they needed the toilet basically the waste bit pushed towards the edge of their body on the inside
00:29:44,00:29:53,And this anus grew out of nowhere and then soon as it was out it closed up again and then they are anusless once again
00:29:53,00:30:00,And because they poo once virtually every hour they grow 24 anuses every day
00:30:00,00:30:04,It sounds like you're pitching to be the new David Attenborough
00:30:04,00:30:11,But this is very exciting in science because it's a transient anus
00:30:11,00:30:18,It's never before it's been seen in any of living species that we have
00:30:18,00:30:21,Well there are a few transient anuses actually
00:30:21,00:30:23,It's only one of a handful of
00:30:23,00:30:27,This is the first scientific observation of what that was
00:30:27,00:30:35,We know of a few because we have mentioned one on the podcast actually there's a jaw worm who has a transient anus called haplog nathia
00:30:35,00:30:43,And there's also a microscopic creature called Limnog nathia which lives in a hot springs on disco island in Greenland
00:30:43,00:30:45,Cool
00:30:45,00:30:48,Transient anus on disco island
00:30:48,00:30:49,Nice
00:30:49,00:30:52,The research we found this is really cool
00:30:52,00:30:59,He works at a lab called woods hole which is interesting and he watched individual water comb jellies for hours
00:30:59,00:31:06,And he marked the times of their defecations and then when the time was exactly right for the next one he zoomed in with a microscope
00:31:06,00:31:10,And he found that he saw the wormhole opening basically
00:31:10,00:31:11,Wormhole
00:31:11,00:31:14,What it is kind of like a wormhole is like a stargate
00:31:14,00:31:17,They call it the ring of fusion don't they?
00:31:17,00:31:26,That's the process behind it when the canal and basically the way they think it happens is that basically it's all fused up
00:31:26,00:31:30,And then your anal canal swells and swells and swells and presses against your skin tissue
00:31:30,00:31:33,And eventually it creates a little orifice that that dilates
00:31:33,00:31:36,And then it sucks itself back in again
00:31:36,00:31:38,Dan said that it's a bit like a jellyfish
00:31:38,00:31:43,It certainly looks like a jellyfish but it's not related to a jellyfish in any way really
00:31:43,00:31:48,It is less related to a jellyfish than we are to a worm
00:31:48,00:31:51,That's because about 550 million years ago
00:31:51,00:31:58,"The types of animals in the world were worms, sponges, jellyfish and comb jellies which is this type of jelly"
00:31:58,00:32:03,And worms kind of turn into all the different animals and mammals and birds and lizards and everything
00:32:03,00:32:07,And the jellyfish and the comb jellies had already split off way before that
00:32:07,00:32:14,It's as different from a jelly as a tattoo parlour is from a cactus imporium
00:32:14,00:32:16,They are amazing comb jellies
00:32:16,00:32:19,And like you should look them up because they're also kind of beautiful
00:32:19,00:32:22,But the way they move is they have sillier
00:32:22,00:32:24,So you may remember sillier from school as well
00:32:24,00:32:27,There's tiny hairs we have on our nose and our lungs
00:32:27,00:32:31,"And they use sillier, these little hairs, as oars to propel them along"
00:32:31,00:32:34,And they're the biggest things that use them for movement
00:32:34,00:32:38,They run in combs in eight rows on their body
00:32:38,00:32:45,"And yeah, the largest animal has to do it and the main jelly is almost six feet wide"
00:32:45,00:32:48,So some of them can get quite big
00:32:48,00:32:51,But mostly that under 16 inches quite small
00:32:51,00:32:53,The eating method is very cool
00:32:53,00:32:56,I think it's not exactly those ones but there are things called beroid comb jellies
00:32:56,00:32:59,"Because there are whole family, there are different members of the family"
00:32:59,00:33:03,"And beroid comb jellies, they eat their food before they kill it"
00:33:03,00:33:06,So they're just basically a bag floating in the ocean
00:33:06,00:33:10,"And if they spot some prey, which is normally another jelly"
00:33:10,00:33:15,"They just swallow it hot, they just open the mouth of the bag, swallow their prey"
00:33:15,00:33:17,And then they just keep their mouth shut for as long as they can
00:33:17,00:33:20,While they're pulling their prey apart on the inside
00:33:20,00:33:23,They actually have mouths that reseal that basically disappear
00:33:23,00:33:27,"Like zippers, they're described as or it's like a zip, yeah"
00:33:27,00:33:32,"So they open their mouths, which their mouths are about half of their body"
00:33:32,00:33:34,So it's like a plastic bag opening
00:33:34,00:33:38,"And they engulf this other jelly, often bigger than they are"
00:33:38,00:33:42,And then they zip it shut and they probably fuse their mouths back together again
00:33:42,00:33:44,Until they're ready to eat
00:33:44,00:33:46,"Wow, that's amazing"
00:33:46,00:33:50,"But these particular jellies that we are talking about, the ones with the transcontainers"
00:33:50,00:33:53,They're called nemiopsis lady
00:33:53,00:33:57,And they are also known as sea walnuts and a few other things
00:33:57,00:34:00,"Now these guys, they eat by again opening their mouth"
00:34:00,00:34:03,"But then when they open it, it creates almost like a current"
00:34:03,00:34:07,You know those rides when you're on like a donut and you're going really slowly down there
00:34:07,00:34:11,"So they start that kind of current, but it's so, so slow"
00:34:11,00:34:15,The things that get caught in this current don't even realize there's a current
00:34:15,00:34:19,"And they're just suddenly slowly, slowly floating to this place"
00:34:19,00:34:22,"And before they know it, they're eating, almost like a conveyor belt"
00:34:22,00:34:24,That the food just comes in them and it comes in them
00:34:24,00:34:27,And they can eat an unbelievable amount of stuff
00:34:27,00:34:29,They can eat ten times their body weight in a day
00:34:29,00:34:32,And so they end up basically taking over lakes
00:34:32,00:34:35,So there was some taken to the black sea by accident in some bilge water
00:34:35,00:34:42,"And in less than a decade, the population in the black sea had gone, got a biomass of one billion tons"
00:34:42,00:34:46,Which was ten times the weight of all the fish that were caught in the world that year
00:34:46,00:34:50,"Wow, it's incredible, it's unbelievable"
00:34:50,00:34:53,And weirdly we don't know a huge amount about them
00:34:53,00:34:57,And really we thought there were five US species in there until recently
00:34:57,00:35:02,"And that's partly because they're really hard to study because the moment you attempt to pick them up, they fall apart"
00:35:02,00:35:07,"So there's, and genuinely they sort of melt in your hands"
00:35:07,00:35:14,So I think there was a spotted cone jelly displayed in California's Monterey Bay Aquarium
00:35:14,00:35:18,And it was like literally water currents in the aquarium were just tear it into
00:35:18,00:35:20,So it's very difficult to collect
00:35:20,00:35:24,"And this is actually, I was reading a piece about this Monterey Bay Aquarium"
00:35:24,00:35:30,"And the jellies that they collected, and the main marine biologists there was talking about them"
00:35:30,00:35:32,And he was also saying that they shimmer
00:35:32,00:35:38,"So when they have a light shone on them, then their little sillier break up the wavelengths of light"
00:35:38,00:35:41,"And they reflect them, so they're sort of all rainbow colours"
00:35:41,00:35:44,"And that actually wouldn't happen in the wild, but it does when we shine a light on them"
00:35:44,00:35:48,"But the marine biologist at the aquarium, who talked about that, it's called Steve Haddock"
00:35:48,00:35:58,"Nice! So lots of primitive life forms have only one hole in their bodies, and they have to eat through that, and excrete through that"
00:35:58,00:36:03,"And the reason that we are better than them, and I'm just going to say it, I think we are better than them"
00:36:03,00:36:08,"I'm sorry, I'm going to go to the aquarium, but I do think we've got them beat all right"
00:36:08,00:36:13,"So the reason that you need it is because if you have a through gut, which is what we've got"
00:36:13,00:36:19,"If you don't have that, then you can't eat anything until you've excreted your previous meal"
00:36:19,00:36:21,So it's very inefficient system
00:36:21,00:36:24,So basically you can't have your lunch until you've pooed out your breakfast
00:36:24,00:36:25,Exactly!
00:36:25,00:36:26,Oh!
00:36:26,00:36:28,Exactly! Yes! I told you we were better than them
00:36:28,00:36:34,Just on sort of being able to regrow body parts
00:36:34,00:36:38,"You know that we can regrow stuff, humans, we can regrow fingertips"
00:36:38,00:36:42,And especially children can regrow huge chunks of their fingers
00:36:42,00:36:45,So children up to the age of ten can...
00:36:45,00:36:49,It's not an advert for cutting off the fingertips of children
00:36:49,00:36:51,"It's not, don't try this at home, is it?"
00:36:51,00:36:57,"Well you know, if they've broken the TV curfew, what else can you do?"
00:36:57,00:37:01,"I suppose if you cut the fingertips off, they won't be able to use the remote control"
00:37:01,00:37:03,"Can't use the remote, exactly!"
00:37:03,00:37:10,"And if you can't off the fingertips, or if the fingertips of children under ten fall off, then..."
00:37:10,00:37:14,As is very likely to happen to each other
00:37:14,00:37:16,"As they do, it's a defence in court"
00:37:16,00:37:18,And you don't sew them up
00:37:18,00:37:21,So what doctors tend to do is seal them up with flaps of skin
00:37:21,00:37:23,So you've just got to sure to finger at that point
00:37:23,00:37:25,"But if you don't do that, then they'll tend to grow back"
00:37:25,00:37:29,"And interestingly, they grow back, but they don't have a fingerprint, oddly"
00:37:29,00:37:33,"And also the way they grow back, if there was any nail left at all, tiny bit of nail"
00:37:33,00:37:35,"It will grow back, but it will grow back square"
00:37:35,00:37:38,"Rather than over, which is how our nails grow"
00:37:38,00:37:40,"So it grows back, 20s back"
00:37:40,00:37:41,"Oh, I have that"
00:37:41,00:37:45,"I have a slightly square fingertip, and that's because my finger got shut in the door when I was a baby"
00:37:45,00:37:47,Did you break the TV curfew?
00:37:47,00:37:49,I didn't break the TV curfew
00:37:49,00:37:53,I made sure to bring in all the tellies from the garden
00:37:53,00:37:55,Right on time
00:37:55,00:37:57,We're going to have to wrap up very soon
00:37:57,00:38:00,"Just one more thing, I'm afraid this is about the word..."
00:38:00,00:38:03,It's about the word in the fact
00:38:03,00:38:09,"So there are old books, there are book scanners, which are designed to digitize very elderly books"
00:38:09,00:38:12,"Books from the 19th, 18th century, that kind of thing, which no one's read"
00:38:12,00:38:14,"And convert them into e-books, so they can be read"
00:38:14,00:38:20,"Unfortunately, there are some book scanners, which cannot tell the difference between the word ""arms"" and the word ""anus"""
00:38:20,00:38:24,"And it literally can't tell it's asked from its elbow, isn't that pleasing?"
00:38:24,00:38:29,So this does make a number of old books quite exciting
00:38:29,00:38:34,"So, for example, Bertie, dear Bertie, will you not say goodnight to me?"
00:38:34,00:38:39,Pleaded the sweet voice of Minnie Hamilton as she wound her anus affectionately around her brother's neck
00:38:39,00:38:49,"When she spotted me, she flung her anus high in the air"
00:38:49,00:38:54,"Oh boy, she said, she grabbed my anus and positioned my body in the direction of the East Gallery"
00:38:54,00:38:57,And we started walking
00:38:58,00:39:04,"I'm on the reading the Book of Farewell to anus online, actually, and I've really enjoyed it"
00:39:04,00:39:07,Brunbar comb jelly
