 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Cardiff!
 [Cheering]
 [Cheering]
 My name is Dan Schreiber and I am sitting here with Anish Zenski, Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin
 and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go
 starting with you, James
 Okay my fact this week is that the oldest football cup competition in Spain is the Coppa Del Rey
 each year the winner gets the name engraved in the trophy in Comic Sans
 The greatest font of them all
 So I don't know if you know who invented Comic Sans, anyone? Vincent Kaner and he did it into me recently
 and they asked him his favorite times at Comic Sans has been used so he said that it was in the Coppa Del Rey
 in a photo album made by the Vatican and in the presentation by Surn to announce the discovery of the Higgs boson
 Yes but it wasn't a Vatican, they didn't announce the new Pope in Comic Sans or anything
 No, they still did that with the smoke
 If you could do the smoke in Comic Sans
 It was a lovely photo album that they gave to the Pope
 So it was the Vatican's present to him and it was all the captions
 The best way to caption a book, Comic Sans, there's no question
 You know he's only ever used it once, he said it's Vincent Kaner
 He said he's used Comic Sans once in his life
 It was when I was having trouble changing my broadband to sky so I wrote the molestering Comic Sans complaining
 saying I was disappointed, he got Â£10 refund
 So he's sold
 He's very bullish about it, he's done talks like a Ted talk or something saying
 My name is Vincent Kaner and I've invented the best font in the world
 And if people don't like it, he pushes back
 So he said, if you love Comic Sans then you don't know anything about typography
 But if you hate Comic Sans then you don't know anything about typography either
 Where should you stand?
 Unbiveness
 I think so, yeah
 And he also, he has a thing where he loves the hatred for Comic Sans as well
 He really thrives off it and he collects examples of people's furies
 So he was doing an interview again and he said, interesting fact
 The main designer at Twitter tweeted that the most server space is used by complaints
 First about airlines, second, Comic Sans, third, Justin Bieber
 And then he says, so not even the Bieber can be Comic Sans
 He's said it's like Bieber
 He has said it's the Justin Bieber of fonts
 Most people love him, but a lot of people wouldn't say it's the best music
 It's fair enough, that's an controversial opinion here in Cardiff anyway
 He said that he once went to the design museum in London and had to have a bodyguard
 Did he help?
 Well he said that, I don't know, he maybe he was joking
 But just an interesting fact, his boss at Microsoft when he did that was Rob Norton
 Who was the son of Mary Norton who wrote the borrower's
 And also after he did Comic Sans he designed the Ministry of Sound logo
 Yeah, a few minutes of trivia
 There's this thing about Comic Sans that gets claimed which is that the reason it's used in schools and teachers like it is because it makes children read better
 And it's very good for dyslexic children because partly because the writing is very slightly unclear
 So it takes you longer to read it and the theory is that makes you remember it better
 But that's been shown to be Bullocks
 So teachers don't write in, there is a font called Sans Fogettica
 And that was developed last year which tries to achieve what people claim Comic Sans does
 And so that's the typeface, you should look at it, it's quite cool
 That's quite difficult to read because it's got lots of gaps in the letters
 And it just means it takes a bit more concentration to read it
 But it is true that your retention of whatever's written there if it's in Sans Fogettica is much better
 So is it that if you have something important you should write it in Sans Fogettica?
 Yes
 Because it feels like quite a risk if you're writing something important is something that people have to read like an emergency sign or an exit sign
 And just saying you should write it with bits missing so people really focus on it
 If it's something you have to remember in future, if it's something you need to know now then maybe just write it in Times New Roman
 There's this thing just on that about how you read
 So when you read I didn't know this, you're jumping all the time between the words
 Otherwise when you read a story you just go once, once, once, once, once
 Make the leap James, make it
 Once upon, once upon, once upon
 Okay, okay
 No, I walked into that and that's fair
 So you're doing these things called I think it's sacades or sacades
 And fixations which is jumps and pauses
 And if you're reading fluently, what you turns out you don't really look at the whole word when you read it
 You look slightly to the left of the middle of the word you're reading
 And you then sort of, you see the immediate letters around it
 And then you kind of guess the other letters as you jump from one thing to another
 That's so true, that is happening right now
 This is live reading, welcome
 Wow, yeah
 So in the, in 2008, John McCain, when he was running for president, he chose Optimer as his font for his signs
 Because it was the same typeface used on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial
 Oh, that was his idea
 Obama used Gotham, which has been described as friendly without being folksy, confident without being aloof
 Wow
 Which is crazy, because it's like a Gotham villain came into power right after him
 Well, yeah, actually Trump's campaign font was called Accidents Grotesque
 Honestly true
 That's a designer having a laugh or something, isn't it? That's amazing
 You know there are font detectives?
 No, yeah
 There are font detectives
 Why? Well
 So I'm looking at it as like we could possibly work out what that is
 So if a font goes missing?
 Yeah
 If it sounds forgettiger, just completely disappeared
 No, it's not quite that
 It's people who determine whether documents are authentic by analyzing the fonts in them
 So if the Dead Sea Scrolls are in Comic Sans, they're probably not
 Exactly
 So this guy Thomas Finney, he writes all these stories about his cases
 And he writes them up like their Sherlock Holmes stories, it's pretty cool
 So for example, in 1999, this lawyer got in touch with him because he was looking at a will
 And he was trying to walk out, is this will real or hasn't been altered
 And Finney discovered that the will was dated 1983, but it was printed by a high-res inkjet printer
 Which wasn't on the market until 1988
 Right
 So, that's good
 That's very good
 But that's more like a printer detective, isn't it?
 Yeah
 Yeah, it was an extremely poor example from a wide-port photo of his career
 On Dead People in France, one of the things that the campaign against Comic Sans hates the most
 So this is a campaign that's set up by Holly and David Combs or Combs, so I think we've mentioned before
 But they say it just doesn't look great in a lot of places
 For instance, as David Combs, a place where it doesn't look great in my opinion is on a tombstone
 And I have seen a number of those
 So there are tombstones up there with Comic Sans?
 There's actually a website you can go to called Comic Sans Criminal, where it sort of lists all of the most heinous crimes of Comic Sans
 And it asks you, the reader, are you a criminal?
 And it shows you examples, do you agree with this kind of thing?
 And there was a, the opening hours for a sex offender's register office
 Sorry, where's sex offender's register?
 Yeah
 Really?
 Yeah, there was a defibrillator as well, which just looked really fun
 There is a theory that this sort of, the whole reason that Comic Sans became huge
 Is that it was a font that was launched, it was designed for this product called Microsoft Bob, which actually it ended up not being included with it
 But it did get included as a package in Windows 95, I think
 And this was the first time that all of us could do type setting
 You know, before that you needed to go to a designer, and then this, and people have described this as a massive shift in power
 You know, democratisation of type setting, it's basically like, what's his name?
 Gutenberg?
 Mmm
 It's like the second print revolution
 What you're saying is basically when you give people democratic choice, they end up doing something stupid
 Well
 You wouldn't have said that on our Sunderland gig, would you?
 We're gonna have to move on to our next fac soon
 A lot of couple of things about just other weird trophy decisions
 There's a NASCAR sprint cup race that's in Mardensville, and their trophy that they give out is a grandfather clock
 It's just a giant grandfather clock, that's what you win
 And that started in 1964, it was given as a prize, everyone loved it so much
 And it's a big thing, it's a big thing to get a grandfather clock, until you get too many
 There was a guy called Dale Ehrenhardt, Jr, who took home six
 Didn't really, I just kept winning and it got to the point where it's like
 Do I just throw this one?
 Now are you lifting that up?
 Well you can't at the podium, yeah, it's a bit, it's a bit full on
 I like, you know, there's a trophy that's given out, a ASCAR, ladies' day, to the owner of the winning race horse
 Which is, it's like the main event, really, an ASCAR isn't it
 And the trophy is presented by the queen
 But that causes a problem when she wins it
 So she has won it before, and Anne Prince Andrew did step in to play the role of the queen
 Presenting it to the queen for that
 But did he play, which queen did he play? Did he play the presenting queen?
 He played the one giving the trophy, and then she played the one, well she was the one receiving the trophy
 Just done a fonts, it's always good idea to choose the right fonts
 Because there's a company called Bell Sheek
 And they had a bag that said "My favourite colour is glitter"
 But they chose the wrong fonts and it looked like "My favourite colour is Hitler"
 Oh, as a couple of years ago, and then last Christmas, Iceland chose the wrong fonts and appeared to be selling ming pies
 Okay, it's time for fact number two, and that is Andy
 My fact is, the American product, "Trockful O Nuts" contains no nuts
 It's a coffee product that the firm used to sell nuts, and then they sold nuts and coffee
 And then they stopped selling the nuts, but they thought "Well the name is so good that we just have to keep the "Trockful O Nuts" name
 Actually on the cans sometimes, some of the cans it says, "1920s, we sold nuts
 1930s, we sold nuts and coffee. Now we don't sell nuts, we just sell coffee, but we like our name
 And it has a massive disclaimer saying contains no nuts
 And yet, every time the firm does any market research on why people might not buy it
 People always say, "I was probably nuts at it, aren't they? It's probably nuts, this is "Trockful O Nuts"
 But it's a New York product, isn't it? And if you said if there was a New Yorker near you, and you said "Trockful O Nuts"
 They would say "Yeah, I know it has no nuts" and it's a big thing
 It was as soon as they started going out into other cities and countries that became a problem for them
 So they actually existed fine without putting it on
 Yeah, they have a picture of the New York skyline as well on their packets
 But they don't name it as the New York skyline
 And their head of marketing said that it's nice, it worked perfectly for us
 Because people in New York see the New York skyline and think this is for me
 And then outside of New York, they have no idea what the New York skyline looks like
 So they just think, "Yeah, fine"
 And he's run focus groups all around America saying, "Would you object to something that said New York on it?"
 And they all say "Yes" and then he says "Why?" and they say "Oh, I think it beats our sports teams"
 And that's it, that's the reason they won't eat nuts
 They're on any nuts in it
 You're falling right into the gym
 Have we said what it is? It's a coffee
 So it started by a guy called William Black
 He rented a little space under a staircase in New York
 But it was underneath a drugstore
 And he wasn't allowed to sell anything that was sold in the drugstore
 So he didn't know what to sell, but there was a theatre opposite, so he decided to sell nuts
 But then when the Great Depression struck, according to the website, nuts seemed too much of a luxury
 And so he had to find something else
 But he had a roasting machine for the nuts
 And so he decided to go down to the docks by green coffee beans, roast them themselves and make coffee
 And sandwiches, right?
 And sandwiches, yes
 And we spoke a few weeks ago about how sandwiches that no human-handed touched were a selling point
 In those days, because it meant that it hadn't got any germs on it
 And he used to sell his sandwiches, advertised as untouched by human hands
 And even when they were making the sandwiches, they had to do it with tongs
 So you had to spread the mayonnaise with one tong and put the ham on with another
 And actually, they probably do that in cafes still, I don't know, I think, but hygiene
 As I said it, I thought that doesn't sound that mad
 So just sort of product names, basically
 And this is a big thing, especially in America, so there's a cereal called fruit loops
 But fruit is spelled F-R-O-O-T
 And there's also cap and crunch with crunch berries
 And these have been the subjects of repeated lawsuits from people who claimed I've been deceived
 I thought this was full of fruit and really good for me
 And the whole statement by judges saying things like, here's one from 2009
 This court is not aware of nor has plaintiff alleged the existence of any actual fruit referred to as a crunch berry
 Furthermore, the crunch berry is depicted on the box around crunchy brightly coloured cereal balls
 So far as this court has been made aware, there is no such fruit growing in the wild or occurring naturally in any part of the world
 You've got to be so careful though, because I red bull got sued in 2014 for the fact that they don't actually give you wings
 There was a proper...
 No, yeah, yeah, come on
 It was a mixture of a... that was one guy who's part of the court case who said, I didn't actually grow any wings
 The rest said it claims that it gives you this great energy and it gives you these boosts
 And so they actually had to pay out a huge amount of money
 Including $10 to every US consumer who'd bought the drinks since 2002 if they wrote in
 Really, yeah
 I remember though as once some sausages sold in Wales called dragon sausages that had to be taken off because they didn't contain any dragons
 Is that true?
 That's true, yeah
 Very disappointing for the card of audience, thought you've been eating dragons all these years
 There's a hair product in... I think in the US called Rogaine and it was originally called Regaine
 And then the FDA, the Food and Drugs Administrator, next that, because they said you can't call it Regaine
 Because obviously it doesn't work, because hair-regraith products don't work
 So you don't have to change the vows
 There was a tattoo artist in London whose salon was called Prick
 He was called Henry Hate
 And he tried to stop a nearby cactus shop from using the same name
 And this guy, Henry Hate, is kind of semi-famous because he did a lot of Amy Winehouse's tattoos
 And he thought that this person with a cactus shop was kind of passing off with his edgy rock and roll name
 But then it went to court and court judge Melissa Clark said
 "It is difficult to imagine two businesses with two less closely related activities
 I think it's fair
 I can imagine two things less similar than tattoos and cactuses
 Like a waffle maker and then a sort of like a Rolls-Royce engine firm
 And if I had a bit longer I could have come up with something really, really different
 I guess they're both round, don't they? So it doesn't really work
 Yeah
 Well
 Just on that very similar note, in 2018 rapper Dr. Dre lost a trademark case to another man called Dr. Dre
 Who was written books including 20 things you might not know about the vagina
 And the judge in that case said that confusion was unlikely as Dr. Dre is not a medical doctor
 Nor is he qualified to provide any type of medical service
 But they should get together because I would listen to a Dr. Dre rap about 20 things you might not know about
 The vagina
 To be honest, I think there's quite a lot of that in his rap
 It's just on the famous names thing
 They're in Australia at the moment, there's a pop-up burger place which a lot of people trying to not shut down but get them to change their name
 They're called Pablo Escoburgers
 And when you buy a burger from Pablo Escoburgers you get a fake line of white powder
 It's like a garlic flower that's on top of the bun and then there's a rolled up $100 note next to it
 Presumably a fake $100 note
 No real?
 It's real?
 Yeah, fake, definitely fake
 The passing off thing is quite, it's really well established, so for example, we've mentioned on the bogus before
 The first ever self-service supermarket are you one way you get a basket and you go around or trolley and you go around putting things in
 Going to a counter and handing over a list, the first ever of those in America was called Piggly Wiggly
 And that was a fun novelty name
 But it was immediately followed by another firm setting up called Hoggley Woggley
 And then helpy selfie and then savey wavy
 And these are all completely different firms
 Do you know that the Food and Drugs Administration in America when people are coming up with names for new drugs
 They run it through a whole bunch of handwriting tests, so they get those people in to write the drugs in certain types of hand-racing
 To make sure that they can never be mistaken in certain handwriting for other drugs
 Oh really?
 That's really clever
 Very clever
 The letter Z appears in 18 times as often in drug names as it does in other English words
 Wow
 Yeah
 Because it seems speedy and powerful and memorable because it's weird
 So what's the drug that's got Z in it?
 To Mazepam to Mazepam
 Wow
 You see?
 Oh yeah
 Well that's not really how I feel when I take it
 Have you guys had a breakfast mates?
 No
 No
 This was a product, this is actually just more a disastrous product than a bad name
 So it was launched in 1998, it was Kellogg's breakfast mates
 And it was an all-in-one package with one serving of cereal, one tiny tiny carton of milk and one plastic spoon
 And it was designed for people who find normal cereal just too inconvenient and too much of a hassle in the morning
 That does sound quite good idea
 Yeah, so you get on the train with your breakfast mates and you just pour out your cereal into the bowl and then then...
 Anyway, basically they had neglected to realise that cereal is one of the most easy things to prepare
 And there was testing which went on and it showed that preparing cereal the traditional way took one second longer than breakfast mates
 It adds up
 Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is Chuzensky
 My fact this week is that the scientist Robert Hook recorded in his diary every time he had an orgasm
 So this is...
 You might remember Robert Hook from school, you learn about Hook's law
 I don't learn about this
 Well, you actually do learn about Hook's law of elasticity which is a fail reference to this
 He was a polymath, he was an unbelievably high-achieving scientist around at the same time as Newton
 And he wrote extensive diaries where he recorded every detail of his life including his orgasms
 And he had a sign for when he had an orgasm which was the sign of Pisces which is kind of sort of like a backward sea and then a sea back to back
 And we actually are not 100% sure that it was all of them but we kind of assume people have used this as a basis of what his sex drive was
 Yeah, so for instance in one of his diaries it says "played with Nell Pisces sign hurt small of back"
 That could have been Twister, he was right
 Another one went late to bed, Pisces sign in sleep, sweat much and disturbed
 And then another one that made Wormwood wine, Pisces sign, Pisces sign
 Oh!
 Oh yeah, you're Robert
 It's a good night
 He's just bragging
 Oh my goodness
 But yeah, he was into it, he had a weird sex life actually, Hook
 So he didn't really have relationships
 It was kind of sad, he never had sex with someone who wasn't sort of financially dependent on him or dependent for a home
 He used to have a lot of liaisons with servants and shagged them a lot like Nell
 And then he had this weird relationship with Grace, his niece who was sent to live with him by his brother
 Who was sent to live with him when she was 10 and then but she pretty much turned 16 and he was like
 "Alright, you want to get off?"
 "You want a Pisces sign?"
 "You want a Pisces sign?"
 He was incredible, I mean he sort of, someone described him as Leonardo da Vinci but without the paintings
 Yeah
 Which sounds pretty crap doesn't it but it was, it sort of, he worked on all these different fields
 Like he invented a microscope and he used that to draw incredibly tiny things no one had seen before
 Or he designed the monitors or he came up with telescopes
 So he invented the word "cell"
 Do you mean a tiny cell in a body?
 It's pretty cool
 He saw them, didn't he?
 He looked in his microscope at some car and he saw these little, he named them after the cells that monks lived in
 But he didn't know that what they did he thought they was to send liquid around the body or something like that
 So he didn't really know what they were but he did give the name which is quite good
 He invented some flyer machines in his diaries, he drew them, he invented the first pressure cooker
 Cool, that's very nice for stuff
 He sort of claimed to have flown
 He experimented with lots of flyer machines on the grounds of modern college where he went to uni with his friends
 He built all these machines and then he did write in his diary in 1674
 Told Sir Robert Sutherl, his friend, told him I could fly but I didn't tell him how
 Ten cans of Red Bull
 He was a proper scientist and he did a lot of measurements and stuff like that
 And in those days it was long thought that masturbation was extremely bad for you
 And so one reason that he always mentioned it in his diaries is because it was like an ongoing appraisal of his health
 So he'll be able to see how often it had happened and then he'll be able to see how he was feeling
 Because he was a hypokundriac as well
 No, no, I'm just conducting an ongoing appraisal of my health
 Sure
 Mom
 It's an experiment
 When you say he's likely an order without the paintings, interestingly, we don't know what he looks like
 We have no idea, there were no surviving paintings of Robert Hook and that is very surprising because he was such a prominent person
 The Royal Society particularly loved him every all the scientists, they didn't like him as a person
 But they respected the hell out of what he did
 His books were admired by peeps through to all the top scientists
 And there is a rumor and it's definitely a rumor that the rivalry that happened between him and Isaac Newton was so great
 That when Isaac Newton became the president of the Royal Society and at this point Hook had died
 That he slashed all of the paintings of Robert Hook to say this was not someone we need to...
 I don't think it's a rumor
 I think that's widely accepted to have happened
 I think that he probably did it
 Yeah, we don't have evidence, I think there was one painting and he and Newton hated each other
 They had a massive rivalry and Newton did erase him from scientific history for a long time
 We all think Newton is the good guy and then he became president of the Royal Society who happened to have this painting
 Which has disappeared ever since
 You raised him but all that survived were the orgasms
 Poor guy
 If you get a UV light in the Royal Society, you can't see the evidence
 It's all that's left of him, it's so sad
 He sort of proceeded Newton in a theory of gravity, which is a bit vague of the Newton's
 But he said the planets were attracted to each other, the sun and the planets were attracted to each other
 He said gravity was a universal force and Newton claimed credit
 His diary is also chronicled his flatulence
 And it was always in conjunction with the barometric pressure of the area
 As he thought that the two might be connected in some way
 So he thought if it was low pressure, today there's a storm coming in, everyone would be fasting a lot more
 That makes so much sense
 It does make sense
 Does that?
 Is it true?
 Yeah, it does because if it's low pressure, you would have thought that your gas goes from an area of high pressure to an area of low pressure out for your rectum
 I reckon it's true
 I think I'm on the news going, well we've been getting a lot of reports of flatulence from the area of Cardiff
 No, it's over to Anna with the weather
 One long fart, take your own breath around today
 I mean, he also wrote a lot about, he was a hyperchondriacum
 He said that he suffered from giddiness, indigestion, flatulence, blockages of the sinuses, sore eyes, noises in the head, insomnia
 And he took all these different medicines which he wrote all about as well
 So he took steel, iron oxide, opium, amber, purgitives
 And whenever his medicine gave him constipation, he said he was cheated of a shit
 That's a great phrase
 He was basically a drug addict though, wasn't he?
 Yeah, he was so ill, he took all the drugs
 And in those days medical drugs were basically all the illegal drugs now
 Like opium and cannabis and lordinum and stuff like that
 There's one other thing he took, because science was in its infancy
 He believes that a lot of rather dubious stuff
 So he noted down that a thing called stercus humanum was really good for removing films or myths from the eyes
 And stercus humanum is dried and powdered human poo
 Apparently you were meant to blow it into your eyes and this would heal your eyes
 Does it work?
 It doesn't work
 Actually, I haven't even checked that but I just think it's important to say
 I think this is the moment that don't try this at home as inventive of it
 On putting stuff in your eye, Samuel Peeps, the world's most famous diarist
 who was around at the same time and who in fact met Hook
 He only wrote his diary for nine years
 I had no idea, it's so weird because he's basically the main source for everything I've ever read about the 1600s
 And he wrote his diary from 1660s to 1669
 When he panicked that he was going blind because he'd been writing it too much
 And he quit and he never wrote another word because he said I'm going blind
 The good god prepare me for this awful affliction, I'm on my way out
 And then he lived for the 34 years without going blind
 Without going blind
 Wow, that's amazing
 He did write amazing so he was famous I guess for the sex stuff
 Like if there's any time you think of Peeps it was he wrote very much about his sex life in it
 But he was an entry that I read
 So I to bed and in the night was mightily troubled with a looseness and feeling for a chamber pot there was none
 I, having called the maid up out of her bed, she had forgotten supposed to put one there
 So I was forced in this strange house to rise and shit in the chimney twice
 And so to bed and was very well again
 How I wish I had been cheated of a shit
 Wow
 You know you prefaced that by saying he was into the sex stuff
 Yeah
 Okay
 I'm
 Revealed a bit too much from my diary there
 Okay, we need to move to our final fact of the show and that is my fact
 My fact this week is that Warty comb jellies grow a brand new anus every time they need to defecate
 How cool is that?
 So a Wart comb jelly is like a jellyfish but not it's a different species
 But they look very similar if you saw it in the ocean and for a very long time we assumed they had an anus
 And it's only just recent
 This is almost breaking news in science and very exciting news because what they learn is that when it goes the toilet
 This was a guy called Sydney Tam who was studying them very closely with microscopes
 Every time they needed the toilet basically the waste bit pushed towards the edge of their body on the inside
 And this anus grew out of nowhere and then soon as it was out it closed up again and then they are anusless once again
 And because they poo once virtually every hour they grow 24 anuses every day
 It sounds like you're pitching to be the new David Attenborough
 But this is very exciting in science because it's a transient anus
 It's never before it's been seen in any of living species that we have
 Well there are a few transient anuses actually
 It's only one of a handful of
 This is the first scientific observation of what that was
 We know of a few because we have mentioned one on the podcast actually there's a jaw worm who has a transient anus called haplog nathia
 And there's also a microscopic creature called Limnog nathia which lives in a hot springs on disco island in Greenland
 Cool
 Transient anus on disco island
 Nice
 The research we found this is really cool
 He works at a lab called woods hole which is interesting and he watched individual water comb jellies for hours
 And he marked the times of their defecations and then when the time was exactly right for the next one he zoomed in with a microscope
 And he found that he saw the wormhole opening basically
 Wormhole
 What it is kind of like a wormhole is like a stargate
 They call it the ring of fusion don't they?
 That's the process behind it when the canal and basically the way they think it happens is that basically it's all fused up
 And then your anal canal swells and swells and swells and presses against your skin tissue
 And eventually it creates a little orifice that that dilates
 And then it sucks itself back in again
 Dan said that it's a bit like a jellyfish
 It certainly looks like a jellyfish but it's not related to a jellyfish in any way really
 It is less related to a jellyfish than we are to a worm
 That's because about 550 million years ago
 The types of animals in the world were worms, sponges, jellyfish and comb jellies which is this type of jelly
 And worms kind of turn into all the different animals and mammals and birds and lizards and everything
 And the jellyfish and the comb jellies had already split off way before that
 It's as different from a jelly as a tattoo parlour is from a cactus imporium
 They are amazing comb jellies
 And like you should look them up because they're also kind of beautiful
 But the way they move is they have sillier
 So you may remember sillier from school as well
 There's tiny hairs we have on our nose and our lungs
 And they use sillier, these little hairs, as oars to propel them along
 And they're the biggest things that use them for movement
 They run in combs in eight rows on their body
 And yeah, the largest animal has to do it and the main jelly is almost six feet wide
 So some of them can get quite big
 But mostly that under 16 inches quite small
 The eating method is very cool
 I think it's not exactly those ones but there are things called beroid comb jellies
 Because there are whole family, there are different members of the family
 And beroid comb jellies, they eat their food before they kill it
 So they're just basically a bag floating in the ocean
 And if they spot some prey, which is normally another jelly
 They just swallow it hot, they just open the mouth of the bag, swallow their prey
 And then they just keep their mouth shut for as long as they can
 While they're pulling their prey apart on the inside
 They actually have mouths that reseal that basically disappear
 Like zippers, they're described as or it's like a zip, yeah
 So they open their mouths, which their mouths are about half of their body
 So it's like a plastic bag opening
 And they engulf this other jelly, often bigger than they are
 And then they zip it shut and they probably fuse their mouths back together again
 Until they're ready to eat
 Wow, that's amazing
 But these particular jellies that we are talking about, the ones with the transcontainers
 They're called nemiopsis lady
 And they are also known as sea walnuts and a few other things
 Now these guys, they eat by again opening their mouth
 But then when they open it, it creates almost like a current
 You know those rides when you're on like a donut and you're going really slowly down there
 So they start that kind of current, but it's so, so slow
 The things that get caught in this current don't even realize there's a current
 And they're just suddenly slowly, slowly floating to this place
 And before they know it, they're eating, almost like a conveyor belt
 That the food just comes in them and it comes in them
 And they can eat an unbelievable amount of stuff
 They can eat ten times their body weight in a day
 And so they end up basically taking over lakes
 So there was some taken to the black sea by accident in some bilge water
 And in less than a decade, the population in the black sea had gone, got a biomass of one billion tons
 Which was ten times the weight of all the fish that were caught in the world that year
 Wow, it's incredible, it's unbelievable
 And weirdly we don't know a huge amount about them
 And really we thought there were five US species in there until recently
 And that's partly because they're really hard to study because the moment you attempt to pick them up, they fall apart
 So there's, and genuinely they sort of melt in your hands
 So I think there was a spotted cone jelly displayed in California's Monterey Bay Aquarium
 And it was like literally water currents in the aquarium were just tear it into
 So it's very difficult to collect
 And this is actually, I was reading a piece about this Monterey Bay Aquarium
 And the jellies that they collected, and the main marine biologists there was talking about them
 And he was also saying that they shimmer
 So when they have a light shone on them, then their little sillier break up the wavelengths of light
 And they reflect them, so they're sort of all rainbow colours
 And that actually wouldn't happen in the wild, but it does when we shine a light on them
 But the marine biologist at the aquarium, who talked about that, it's called Steve Haddock
 Nice! So lots of primitive life forms have only one hole in their bodies, and they have to eat through that, and excrete through that
 And the reason that we are better than them, and I'm just going to say it, I think we are better than them
 I'm sorry, I'm going to go to the aquarium, but I do think we've got them beat all right
 So the reason that you need it is because if you have a through gut, which is what we've got
 If you don't have that, then you can't eat anything until you've excreted your previous meal
 So it's very inefficient system
 So basically you can't have your lunch until you've pooed out your breakfast
 Exactly!
 Oh!
 Exactly! Yes! I told you we were better than them
 Just on sort of being able to regrow body parts
 You know that we can regrow stuff, humans, we can regrow fingertips
 And especially children can regrow huge chunks of their fingers
 So children up to the age of ten can...
 It's not an advert for cutting off the fingertips of children
 It's not, don't try this at home, is it?
 Well you know, if they've broken the TV curfew, what else can you do?
 I suppose if you cut the fingertips off, they won't be able to use the remote control
 Can't use the remote, exactly!
 And if you can't off the fingertips, or if the fingertips of children under ten fall off, then...
 As is very likely to happen to each other
 As they do, it's a defence in court
 And you don't sew them up
 So what doctors tend to do is seal them up with flaps of skin
 So you've just got to sure to finger at that point
 But if you don't do that, then they'll tend to grow back
 And interestingly, they grow back, but they don't have a fingerprint, oddly
 And also the way they grow back, if there was any nail left at all, tiny bit of nail
 It will grow back, but it will grow back square
 Rather than over, which is how our nails grow
 So it grows back, 20s back
 Oh, I have that
 I have a slightly square fingertip, and that's because my finger got shut in the door when I was a baby
 Did you break the TV curfew?
 I didn't break the TV curfew
 I made sure to bring in all the tellies from the garden
 Right on time
 We're going to have to wrap up very soon
 Just one more thing, I'm afraid this is about the word...
 It's about the word in the fact
 So there are old books, there are book scanners, which are designed to digitize very elderly books
 Books from the 19th, 18th century, that kind of thing, which no one's read
 And convert them into e-books, so they can be read
 Unfortunately, there are some book scanners, which cannot tell the difference between the word "arms" and the word "anus"
 And it literally can't tell it's asked from its elbow, isn't that pleasing?
 So this does make a number of old books quite exciting
 So, for example, Bertie, dear Bertie, will you not say goodnight to me?
 Pleaded the sweet voice of Minnie Hamilton as she wound her anus affectionately around her brother's neck
 When she spotted me, she flung her anus high in the air
 Oh boy, she said, she grabbed my anus and positioned my body in the direction of the East Gallery
 And we started walking
 I'm on the reading the Book of Farewell to anus online, actually, and I've really enjoyed it
