 Hey Clubfish members, welcome to this week's bonus bit of content.

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,960
 We have got a compilation episode for you today.

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:11,700
 But before we get into it, I just want to quickly remind some of you who may have missed

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:17,960
 the news that we are going to do a live show, July 6th, at the Crossed Wires Festival,

6
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,760
 which is a festival that was co-created by our good friend, Alice Lavigne, of my dad

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,760
 wrote a porno.

8
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:23,760
 They started last year.

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,960
 It was a massive success.

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,240
 They're coming back this year and we were really excited to be invited, so we're going

11
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,640
 to be doing a live recording.

12
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,400
 Now, we didn't do Sheffield on our tour last year.

13
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:36,580
 We really missed out on getting to that bit of the country, so if you're in that area,

14
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:37,580
 come along.

15
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:39,140
 We're doing a full live recording.

16
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:41,640
 There'll be a few extra fun bits thrown in as well.

17
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,920
 And if you want to get tickets, go to nosuchthingasaffish.com.

18
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,240
 You'll find all the links there.

19
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,180
 And why not check out what other podcasts are on.

20
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:49,840
 It is genuinely a great pod festival.

21
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,840
 All right.

22
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,480
 Well, let's get to the compilation.

23
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,740
 Here are the best of the outtakes that never made it to the main show.

24
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:56,740
 Here we go.

25
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:18,900
 She turned up to the unveiling of the Statue of Liberty, which I really like, and she turned

26
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,060
 that she was not invited.

27
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:25,380
 But she turned up on a cattle barge, so she turned up on a barge with a megaphone, and

28
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:30,120
 shouting that it was a gigantic lie, a travesty, and a mockery to make the representation of

29
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,120
 Liberty a woman when actual women had so few rights at the time.

30
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,120
 So that was her, that was her prototype.

31
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,640
 No, she's shackled, though, isn't she?

32
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,160
 Oh, is she broken her shackles?

33
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,640
 I don't think she's shackled.

34
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,640
 Is she not?

35
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,640
 I should not have been up it.

36
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,640
 And I don't know.

37
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,640
 You haven't been able to see her on the inside.

38
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,640
 You can't see me out.

39
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,140
 It's like Annie from there.

40
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,680
 Oh, and I haven't been up it either.

41
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,020
 Sorry, I was missing my name.

42
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:51,020
 What just happened?

43
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,020
 I've been near it.

44
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,020
 Oh, yeah.

45
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,020
 We all, but we went together.

46
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,020
 We were near it.

47
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,020
 We went to New York.

48
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,020
 I've been closer than that.

49
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,020
 Are we?

50
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,020
 Yeah, yeah.

51
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,020
 But she's not, I don't think.

52
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,020
 I don't think she's shackled.

53
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,020
 I don't think she's shackled.

54
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,020
 I've got one of her legs had a shackle on it, but maybe I'm wrong.

55
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,020
 Oh, she's got slippers.

56
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,020
 I know that much.

57
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,020
 Slipers.

58
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,020
 I think they're more sandals.

59
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,020
 Yeah, slip-ons.

60
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,020
 Like, the open toad.

61
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,020
 You could see her feet.

62
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,020
 Yeah.

63
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,020
 She's a woman in comfortable shoes.

64
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:13,020
 That's why you stayed outside.

65
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,060
 You got one of those wicky feet things going on.

66
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:20,980
 So true feminist should campaign for the Statue of Liberty to be a man?

67
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:21,980
 Yeah.

68
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:26,980
 And yet, my campaign has got done nothing.

69
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,980
 I have one more caddy called Daff to Willie Gunn.

70
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,980
 He is an old school one in Scotland.

71
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,980
 He was from the 19th century, early 19th century.

72
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:39,980
 He always wore four coats, three or four pairs of trousers.

73
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:40,980
 It is cold in Scotland.

74
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:41,980
 It is cold.

75
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,980
 He couldn't afford, like, a big coat or anything.

76
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,980
 So he just wore lots of small ones.

77
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:51,980
 And he just fell sick on me.

78
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:55,980
 He would only eat milk and soft vegetables his whole life.

79
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:56,980
 Okay.

80
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,980
 And he would be in St Andrews in Scotland.

81
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:02,980
 And then when the golf season finished, he would walk off.

82
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:03,980
 And no one knew where he went.

83
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,980
 He just presumably walked home somewhere.

84
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:08,980
 And then when the season started, he walked back again.

85
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:09,980
 And that was it.

86
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,980
 Well, he's really great.

87
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:15,980
 And then one day they stumbled upon a grave which said he died in 1520.

88
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:20,980
 Well, one day in 1820, he walked north, never to return.

89
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:21,980
 Oh.

90
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,980
 And to this day, nobody knows what happened to him.

91
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:24,980
 Stand out there.

92
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:25,980
 Well, that's great.

93
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:26,980
 That was great.

94
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:27,980
 Do you know that fact?

95
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:28,980
 Have I ever said it on this?

96
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:29,980
 I don't think I have.

97
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:32,980
 It was during the winter war, I think, between Russia and Finland.

98
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:35,980
 And there was a guy who was captured.

99
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:39,980
 And it turned out they was trying to hide in the snow by putting diaries on his head.

100
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:43,980
 And he reckoned that it worked for ages because they were white diaries.

101
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,980
 And no one could see him.

102
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:48,980
 But why had he taken so many diaries to a corporate zone?

103
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:51,980
 Did he just think I know this is going to work?

104
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:55,980
 I think he might have plundered them from houses.

105
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,980
 Really, of course, because you would get diaries in it.

106
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:58,980
 I mean, you don't get diaries anymore.

107
00:03:58,980 --> 00:03:59,980
 It's a really, really sad fact.

108
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:02,980
 I mean, you get sort of weak diaries on trains these days.

109
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,980
 But even then, only on nice trains, they're not very good.

110
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,980
 Let's make me think, if you're Jewish and you have a Yamakar,

111
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:10,980
 do you, if you were going certain places with the army,

112
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,980
 would you match it to your environment?

113
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,980
 You're going somewhere winter, where I'm white.

114
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:15,980
 Kamalka.

115
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:19,980
 But in all these scenarios, you have, and in this one you've described,

116
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,980
 do you have to bury yourself up to the eyebrows?

117
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:25,980
 I think it was more like his hair would show up against the snow,

118
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,980
 but you maybe had a white coat.

119
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,980
 Did you get caught when some Russians turn up?

120
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:30,980
 I thought, "Oh, a lovely comfy armchair."

121
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,980
 I'll just stand up after I'm here.

122
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,980
 Just put like nothing to you under that.

123
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,980
 Well, it was entirely doing here.

124
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,980
 You know what, I only have remembered the story, so.

125
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,980
 Wait, is a Dolly's view ahead, isn't it?

126
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,980
 Is it a coaster?

127
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,980
 Dolly is the thing you put on a table and you put,

128
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,980
 it's a bit bigger than a coaster, but you put your tea part on it.

129
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:47,980
 What am I thinking of?

130
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,980
 I think it's a lacy.

131
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:50,980
 An anti-macasser.

132
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:51,980
 An anti-macasser.

133
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:52,980
 I'm so sorry.

134
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,980
 An anti-macasser is the thing you don't get anymore.

135
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,980
 I've got doggies coming out of my ass.

136
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,980
 It's winter, the same material though.

137
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:00,980
 So you obviously was a material based confusion.

138
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:03,980
 Anyway, I don't think a Dolly would work as an anti-macasser,

139
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:06,980
 because it's got holes in it, so all the macastras would get on the chair.

140
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:07,980
 You're right.

141
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:08,980
 What's a macasser?

142
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:09,980
 A macasser.

143
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:10,980
 We have a lot of topic.

144
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:11,980
 Macasser is hair oil.

145
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:12,980
 Yeah.

146
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:13,980
 In the 19th century, you'd have lots of you.

147
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:14,980
 Slather yourself.

148
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:15,980
 Yeah.

149
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:18,980
 So that's why, we don't need to confine this in the 19th century.

150
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,980
 Sorry, you popped your tiger bar when you're here.

151
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:23,980
 Your anti-macasser is when you go on the train or at a chair.

152
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:24,980
 You sit in a comfy chair.

153
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:28,980
 You need a layer of cloth between your head and the fabric of the chair,

154
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,980
 so that the oil doesn't soak into the chair itself.

155
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,980
 So that's an anti-macasser.

156
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:33,980
 James is right.

157
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:34,980
 A Dolly is the kind of coaster.

158
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:37,980
 Is that what they put on airplanes when you say that this is an anti-macasser?

159
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,980
 Should we talk about El Frank Balm?

160
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:40,980
 Yeah, sure.

161
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:43,980
 I've only got anti-macasser material.

162
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:47,980
 Do you know how scientists, if they've got a healer monster,

163
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,980
 to test its health levels, how they test them?

164
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:51,980
 Okay.

165
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:52,980
 So I'm going to give you a clue.

166
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:53,980
 I'm going to give you a clue.

167
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:54,980
 I'm going to give you a clue.

168
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:55,980
 A treadmill is classic.

169
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:56,980
 No, no.

170
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:57,980
 Nice.

171
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:58,980
 That's good.

172
00:05:58,980 --> 00:05:59,980
 It's actually not to test how fit they are in a gym sense.

173
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,980
 It's more like how many reserves do they have?

174
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:02,980
 How long do they go to last?

175
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:05,980
 Take tails to conference, because that's where they get the first.

176
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,980
 It's related to Archimedes.

177
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,980
 They put it in a bath and how much water comes out.

178
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:10,980
 Exactly.

179
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,980
 They dunk their tail in a cup of water.

180
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,980
 And then you just measure how much it comes out.

181
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:15,980
 And then you know how fat the tail is.

182
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:16,980
 It was a bit of an easy clue.

183
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:17,980
 I'll have to apologize about that.

184
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,980
 But, you know, I didn't want it to go on forever.

185
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:20,980
 It was going to be a fun game.

186
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,980
 They are all venomous, right?

187
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:25,980
 And I think only two people are recorded to have ever died.

188
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,980
 One last year and one in 1930.

189
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:30,980
 But the reason they're not very dangerous

190
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:33,980
 is that they don't have a mechanism to inject their venom.

191
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:36,980
 What they've got is they've got teeth with grooves in.

192
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:40,980
 And they have to bite into you and then just champ chew up and down

193
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,980
 and up and down and up and down and flood their mouth with venom

194
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,980
 and chew the venom into you.

195
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,980
 So it's quite hard for them to have a victim.

196
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,980
 So the guttion is very inefficient.

197
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,980
 I read it takes like 15 minutes.

198
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,980
 Well, the guy who died last year, he'd been bitten for four minutes.

199
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,980
 There was a suggestion that you might have had an allergic reaction.

200
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:57,980
 Interesting.

201
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,980
 Yeah, it can be quite scary, I think.

202
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:04,980
 There was a 1959 movie called The Giant Helomonster,

203
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:09,980
 which apparently features a Mexican bearded lizard instead of a Helomonster.

204
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,980
 Yeah, you wouldn't get away with that these days.

205
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:12,980
 No, exactly.

206
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:16,980
 You have to skin an actual Helomonster, don't you?

207
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:20,980
 But it was the first ever double feature film

208
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:23,980
 where you paid for one film and you got two.

209
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:24,980
 That's great.

210
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:28,980
 And it was the first ever film that was shot and produced in Dallas.

211
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,980
 Really?

212
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:35,980
 The fact that you got the double feature that you got was The Giant Helomonster

213
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:38,980
 and the other one was called The Killer Shrews.

214
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:39,980
 Oh, wow.

215
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:40,980
 Which one headlines?

216
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,980
 I mean, it's going to be a double headline now.

217
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,980
 It is a double headline.

218
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:47,980
 Yeah, I watched the trailer for The Helomonster movie.

219
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:48,980
 Oh, yeah.

220
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:49,980
 It's wild.

221
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:50,980
 It's wonderful.

222
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:51,980
 Actually, I lie.

223
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:55,980
 I watched it for the remake in 2012, simply called Helah,

224
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,980
 with an exclamation mark.

225
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,980
 Yeah, it's unbelievable these things get remade.

226
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,980
 It was at the time acknowledged as an unbelievably bad film.

227
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:03,980
 Who's remaking it?

228
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,980
 Someone, and it's as bad.

229
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,980
 Did they not remake The Killer Shrews?

230
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:08,980
 Oh, I didn't check that.

231
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:09,980
 I should have.

232
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:10,980
 It's in development help.

233
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:11,980
 Yeah, yeah.

234
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,980
 Just on strong materials.

235
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:14,980
 This is a stiffer material.

236
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:15,980
 It's all about the hardest.

237
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:16,980
 There's also the strongest.

238
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:19,980
 And that's like, how much can you hang off something, basically?

239
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,980
 Strongest natural material.

240
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:22,980
 Thought of ages made.

241
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:23,980
 Spindy.

242
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:24,980
 Spindy.

243
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:25,980
 Spindy.

244
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:26,980
 Spindy.

245
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:27,980
 Wow.

246
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:28,980
 Wow.

247
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:29,980
 I can just imagine.

248
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:32,980
 I don't know, as the host of Pewdiversity Challenge.

249
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:35,980
 Someone gets an answer like, oh, no, is it?

250
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:36,980
 It's so Milton.

251
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:37,980
 Yeah.

252
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,980
 Well, I've always been so skeptical about this,

253
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:40,980
 and I know scientists have always claimed it,

254
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,980
 but I've just passed so many spiders' webs,

255
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,980
 and often I pull at them, and they break.

256
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,980
 I am unbelievably strong now.

257
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:48,980
 I am.

258
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:49,980
 You're like God's love.

259
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:50,980
 I'm not kidding, yes.

260
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,980
 Friends of the flies, amateur Jinsky.

261
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,980
 I never rate them.

262
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:57,980
 I get it, it's pound for pound, they're very thin,

263
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:58,980
 but it seems so unlikely.

264
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,980
 And anyway, they've been supplanted recently,

265
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,980
 and I believe this much more.

266
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,980
 They always say, answer really strong,

267
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,980
 but I just stand on them and look at this.

268
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:07,980
 Squish.

269
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,980
 It's like I don't understand proportionality.

270
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:15,980
 Anyway, it was recently found that the strongest material is limpit teeth.

271
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:18,980
 So you know, limpits, like the common limpit they see on beaches.

272
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,980
 Their teeth are actually on their tongue,

273
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,980
 like we were talking about a bit earlier with molasses.

274
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:26,980
 They've got this tongue, and they use it for the same purpose as parrot fish,

275
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:29,980
 which is just a scrape algae off the rocks.

276
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:33,980
 And apparently the comparison is a single string of spaghetti holding.

277
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:34,980
 The scientist said,

278
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,980
 "3,500 kilogram bags of sugar,

279
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,980
 which I didn't think was that good a comparison."

280
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:45,980
 So I'm deciding to say it's like a string of spaghetti holding a large walrus,

281
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:48,980
 or my car with five adults inside.

282
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:49,980
 If you know my car.

283
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:50,980
 Wow.

284
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:51,980
 I know your car.

285
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:52,980
 I know your car.

286
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:56,980
 It's not like the small, it's a normal, small-ish sized car, right?

287
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:57,980
 It's a Skoda Fabia.

288
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:58,980
 Yeah.

289
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,980
 I'm not sure if to say it.

290
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:04,980
 That's amazing, that's spaghetti.

291
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,980
 I think it doesn't matter because it's about the...

292
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:07,980
 Please.

293
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:08,980
 Which of it?

294
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:09,980
 It doesn't matter.

295
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,980
 You've been to Anna's Italian restaurant.

296
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:15,980
 It's a nightmare.

297
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:18,980
 It's really hard to turn it around your fork, isn't it?

298
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:22,980
 It's Al Dente.

299
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,980
 I tell you one last...

300
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:27,980
 This is an alternative, actually, to a Zampig.

301
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:28,980
 Yeah.

302
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:29,980
 Because, you know, others are available.

303
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:30,980
 But much better.

304
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:31,980
 Vibes.

305
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:32,980
 Oh.

306
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:33,980
 Okay.

307
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:37,980
 Which is an acronym that stands for the Vibrating Ingestible Bioelectric Simulator.

308
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:42,980
 And it is a pill that you swallow that...

309
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:45,980
 Wiggles and tickles and jiggles inside you.

310
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,980
 And makes you think you're full.

311
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,980
 It's a battery, a motor, a little vibrating motor and a membrane.

312
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,980
 And when you swallow it, the membrane dissolves.

313
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,980
 You know what it sounds like to me, Andy?

314
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:55,980
 A magic bean.

315
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:58,980
 And I've got a lot to sell you.

316
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,980
 Well, it's been tested in the last couple of years in 2023.

317
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,980
 It's been tested on pigs.

318
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:04,980
 It hasn't got to human trials yet.

319
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,980
 But they ate 40% less.

320
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:07,980
 And pigs love to eat.

321
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:08,980
 They're pigs everywhere.

322
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:09,980
 Love to eat.

323
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:12,980
 And it's been tested on young Yorks or pigs, apparently.

324
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:16,980
 And basically, means that your stomach has been jiggled around.

325
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,980
 And it thinks, oh, well, there must be loads of food in here.

326
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:19,980
 Really?

327
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:20,980
 And then, yeah.

328
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:21,980
 Wow.

329
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:23,980
 But then what do I have to eat to get rid of that thing?

330
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,980
 You just eat another one and it pushes the first one through.

331
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:26,980
 That's fine.

332
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:27,980
 Right.

333
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:28,980
 Okay, and then see a big one and a big one.

334
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:29,980
 Wow.

335
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:30,980
 What a weird poo.

336
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:33,980
 That will feel like, because it's vibrating out your butt.

337
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:35,980
 Here's an interesting thing.

338
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:38,980
 Avalanche is, and not nearly as deadly as they used to be.

339
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:42,980
 And more than half of people who are stuck in the Avalanche's survive these days.

340
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:43,980
 Wow.

341
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:47,980
 And they've got loads of new survival devices that you can have that,

342
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:51,980
 if you're skiing off piece, you might have them with you.

343
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:56,980
 One of them, which is really cool, is a thing called the Avalanche Airbag system.

344
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:00,980
 And what you do is when you're skiing and you see an Avalanche coming, you go, oh, shit.

345
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:06,980
 And you pull a toggle and it just puts like an airbag around you, like you're in a...

346
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:07,980
 Zor.

347
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:08,980
 Like you're in a Zor.

348
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:09,980
 But it makes you massive.

349
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:12,980
 It like puts this huge sort of airbag around you.

350
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,980
 And can you guess how it works?

351
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:15,980
 This is really amazing.

352
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,980
 Is it something to do with pressure up in the mountains?

353
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,980
 Well, like how it's inviting.

354
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:23,980
 So you know when you get musely, for instance, you get a big box of musely.

355
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:26,980
 And at the top are all like the big nuts and stuff.

356
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,980
 But at the bottom are all the little grainy bits.

357
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,980
 Yeah, this is like, it's got a name, this effect.

358
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:33,980
 Yeah, it's called like the Brazil nut effect or something like that.

359
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,980
 Well, this makes you really big.

360
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:38,980
 And so when the Avalanche is coming down, like a Brazil nut,

361
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:42,980
 you float to the top and all the small bits of snow goes to the bottom.

362
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:43,980
 Wow.

363
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:44,980
 Isn't that amazing?

364
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,980
 It's called the principle of inverse segregation.

365
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:47,980
 Wow.

366
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,980
 And so it keeps you near the top and it makes you easier to find.

367
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:53,980
 And while you're waiting, you've got all that musely to get you out of the pie.

368
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:56,980
 Have many people done that on purpose?

369
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,980
 Because I'd imagine it would be tempting.

370
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,980
 It's been used in Europe for over 10 years.

371
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,980
 No, sorry, as in for fun.

372
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:04,980
 Oh, for fun.

373
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:05,980
 Because you would have thought that would be unbelievable.

374
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:06,980
 It would be good fun.

375
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,980
 It feels like Avalanche chasers are going to be a thing, right?

376
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,980
 Like tornado hunters.

377
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,980
 Yeah, like surfing on the top of an avalanche.

378
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:13,980
 And your big bubble.

379
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:14,980
 How great would that be?

380
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,980
 I'm going to say don't try it at home anyway.

381
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:17,980
 It can't.

382
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:18,980
 It can't.

383
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:23,980
 Do you know the most famous frostbites offer of all time?

384
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:24,980
 Rental finds.

385
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:25,980
 Yeah.

386
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:26,980
 More famous.

387
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:27,980
 Even more famous than Rental finds.

388
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:28,980
 Oh, I'm blessed.

389
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:29,980
 You think more famous.

390
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:30,980
 More famous.

391
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:31,980
 David Asimbra.

392
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:32,980
 More famous.

393
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:33,980
 God, Albert Einstein.

394
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:34,980
 Joey Essex.

395
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:35,980
 God.

396
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:38,980
 There was a study in 2004 by a couple of neonatologists

397
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:39,980
 who decreed that the baby--

398
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:40,980
 Sorry, Joey Essex.

399
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:41,980
 It's okay, but don't be honest.

400
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:44,980
 Just to kind of think of the most famous person I could think of.

401
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:47,980
 There's a study found that the baby Jesus almost certainly

402
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:48,980
 had hypothermia as a baby.

403
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,980
 Oh, and then by extension.

404
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:51,980
 No.

405
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:52,980
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

406
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:53,980
 Not God, God.

407
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:54,980
 Well, now he is one of the three gods.

408
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:55,980
 Exactly.

409
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:56,980
 He has another mix of God.

410
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:57,980
 Well, that depends which one you find.

411
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:58,980
 Basically, they look to the load of--

412
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,980
 They look to the load of old masters paintings

413
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:01,980
 from the National Gallery,

414
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:02,980
 which loads of them a feature of--

415
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,980
 Oh, and of course they were painted lives.

416
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:05,980
 Well, that was exactly it.

417
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:06,980
 That was it.

418
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:11,980
 There was an ox and an ass and three shepherds

419
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,980
 and a load of fucking painters in the car, wasn't that?

420
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:14,980
 Yeah.

421
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:15,980
 But you never see that.

422
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,980
 It's like a press gallery, you know?

423
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:20,980
 So, yeah, 90% of these paintings depicted Jesus

424
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:21,980
 as either naked or scantily clad.

425
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,980
 And given that the temperature in Bethlehem

426
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:24,980
 in late December is about seven Celsius.

427
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:27,980
 And 60% of the paintings, he's on the floor.

428
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:28,980
 You think, why have you put the baby on the--

429
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:29,980
 Don't put the baby on the floor.

430
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,980
 He wasn't barbed on Christmas Day, though.

431
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,980
 I know that according to the rules he was,

432
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,980
 but I think we don't think he was.

433
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:36,980
 No, okay.

434
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,980
 But either way, it's clearly a risk.

435
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:39,980
 And they said that the--

436
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,980
 Can you guess the explanation they provided?

437
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:42,980
 I really like this.

438
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,980
 As to why it might have been all right, because he was God.

439
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:45,980
 Well, he survived it.

440
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:48,980
 Maybe the halo warmed him up.

441
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:51,980
 They said maybe the halo suggested a neutral thermal zone.

442
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:52,980
 Yes.

443
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:53,980
 Very--

444
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:54,980
 Like Readybreak.

445
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,980
 Makes you blow in the dark.

446
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:57,980
 Yeah, exactly, yeah.

447
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:58,980
 I'm sorry.

448
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,980
 Oh, you're too young to remember those adverts

449
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:01,980
 from the 1980s.

450
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,980
 Like a kid with the Readybreak, and then they would go to school

451
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,980
 and they would just have a glow around them all day.

452
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:07,980
 Right.

453
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:08,980
 It was a dangerous--

454
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:09,980
 It sort of looks a bit nuclear, doesn't it?

455
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:10,980
 Does now you think about it, yeah.

456
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:11,980
 And it was the '80s.

457
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:12,980
 It was a time of anxiety.

458
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:13,980
 Yeah.

459
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:14,980
 It surprised it worked.

460
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,980
 That's why Porridge is now so much more popular than Readybreak.

461
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:17,980
 Here we go.

462
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:18,980
 You're out, and it's cold.

463
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:19,980
 And it's really cold.

464
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:20,980
 Yeah.

465
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:21,980
 You're in big trouble.

466
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:22,980
 You're riding your horse along, yeah.

467
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:23,980
 Oh, okay.

468
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:24,980
 I was under night out in Leeds in my head.

469
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:25,980
 No, I'm--

470
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,980
 Well, you can still be on a night out in Leeds.

471
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:28,980
 That's fine.

472
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,980
 Yeah, six.

473
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:31,980
 Five beers for everyone.

474
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:34,980
 I just remember that's the coldest I've ever been after a night out in Leeds.

475
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:35,980
 So that's where I am.

476
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:36,980
 Okay.

477
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:37,980
 Go on.

478
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:38,980
 But you're on your horse.

479
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:39,980
 I'm on my horse.

480
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:40,980
 You're on your way home, back to the Previewer Inn.

481
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:41,980
 Previewer Inn, yeah.

482
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,980
 There's no room at the Previewer Inn.

483
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:49,980
 Outside there's a baby who's been put on the floor, which is a very bad idea.

484
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:50,980
 Okay.

485
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:51,980
 Your horse dies, under you.

486
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:52,980
 Oh, your horse dies.

487
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:53,980
 On your way back to the Previewer Inn.

488
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,980
 Probably punched by a Leeds United son.

489
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:58,980
 I have my head.

490
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,980
 It's really cold.

491
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:01,980
 It's a long way to go to the Previewer Inn.

492
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:02,980
 Yeah.

493
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:03,980
 What do you do?

494
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:04,980
 Well, I would have walked.

495
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,980
 Oh, you do the Leonardo Comprier thing.

496
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,980
 You can't open your horse and sleep inside.

497
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:09,980
 Exactly.

498
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:10,980
 Oh, I see.

499
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:11,980
 Wait, is that a claxon?

500
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:12,980
 It's not really.

501
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:15,980
 It hasn't been done once, at least, that we know of.

502
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:19,980
 By a missionary in America who, in 1860, he did lose a leg.

503
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:20,980
 He had to have leg amputated.

504
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:21,980
 Okay.

505
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:22,980
 But he did survive.

506
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:26,980
 I was reading a, do you remember the bit in Star Wars, where Luke Skywalker has to cut open the monster?

507
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:27,980
 Yes.

508
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,980
 He has to cut open his big fluffy, no, his sort of pack animal.

509
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:30,980
 That's right.

510
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:31,980
 And then he gets shoved in it.

511
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:32,980
 Okay.

512
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:35,980
 But I remember saying it wouldn't work.

513
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:37,980
 You would really don't have long, even if you cut open your horse and get it.

514
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:38,980
 Hang on, are you saying it would work out?

515
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,980
 So it's how one person's done it and achieved it.

516
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:41,980
 Yeah.

517
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:42,980
 But like, oh, you can do it overnight.

518
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,980
 It must depend how cold it is.

519
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:48,980
 Because if it's like, let's say it's 10 degrees, it's a bit nippy.

520
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:53,980
 Probably you cut open your horse and it will just give you enough warmth to keep you fine.

521
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,980
 The headline then becomes, is this necessary?

522
00:16:55,980 --> 00:17:02,980
 There is a taboo against pointing at rainbows from around the world.

523
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,980
 Lots of different cultures have this.

524
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:08,980
 The Miso of Myanmar, they think that if you point at a rainbow,

525
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:13,980
 you have to immediately point at a hen's basket to stop having some bad luck.

526
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:19,980
 In the Malayang region of Papua New Guinea, if a child accidentally points at a rainbow,

527
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:25,980
 they must go and find an old man and pull his finger.

528
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:34,980
 Accidentally, if you accidentally point at a rainbow,

529
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,980
 it just feels so unlikely that you...

530
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:38,980
 It does.

531
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:41,980
 And there's a group in Ecuador that if you point at a rainbow,

532
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:43,980
 your shoulder will ache.

533
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:49,980
 And in the advocacy group where if you're twins and one of you points at a rainbow,

534
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,980
 then you must apply crushed mushrooms to your face.

535
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,980
 Oh, you would like that.

536
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,980
 No, and the idea is basically rainbows...

537
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:59,980
 Like, it was there, like, happy unicorns, rainbows and stuff,

538
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:02,980
 but to a lot of people there are the worldly weird things.

539
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,980
 And pointing is always bad, really.

540
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,980
 You shouldn't point at people or things.

541
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:07,980
 Right.

542
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:11,980
 If you do point at a rainbow for long enough, you will get a sore shoulder.

543
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:12,980
 That's true.

544
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:15,980
 They're quite a femoral thing, though.

545
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:16,980
 I think that you're right.

546
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,980
 They almost never last long enough that you get a sore shoulder by pointing.

547
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:25,980
 Does the culture that has pulling an old man's finger have the same thing that we have when you pull it?

548
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,980
 I did luck.

549
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:34,980
 I mean, we should laugh at these things, but...

550
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,980
 Because it's people and like, it's all, you know...

551
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,980
 It's actually, it's incredibly serious.

552
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:43,980
 But it is that is objectively funny.

553
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:44,980
 It is.

554
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:48,980
 You know, one person who can withstand these extraordinary cold temperatures,

555
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,980
 and he's become quite famous, Wim Hof.

556
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,980
 I don't know if anyone's read that book.

557
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:53,980
 Yeah, the method.

558
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:54,980
 The method, Wim Hof method.

559
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:58,980
 So he climbed to an altitude of 7,200 meters on Mount Everest,

560
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,980
 wearing nothing but shorts and shoes.

561
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,980
 At one point, he had to change to some boots,

562
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,980
 but that was it that he put on.

563
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:08,980
 He also completed a marathon above the Arctic Circle in Finland,

564
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:12,980
 close to -20, dressed in nothing but shorts as well.

565
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:13,980
 Is it pretty...

566
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:14,980
 Just what tops off?

567
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:15,980
 Yeah, yeah.

568
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:19,980
 And he's sort of is able to withstand these things, hence this people doing it.

569
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:22,980
 It's been just had a lot of controversy about it in recent times,

570
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:25,980
 because a lot of people have either died or become ill off the back of it.

571
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:26,980
 But he can do it.

572
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,980
 He demonstrably can do it.

573
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:34,980
 But according to his biographer, something he didn't get right, was he was swimming in a fountain in Amsterdam.

574
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:40,980
 And he decided on a Wim, oh, on a Wim, to give himself a brilliant,

575
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:44,980
 to give himself an enema on the nozzle of the jet in the fountain.

576
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:45,980
 What?

577
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:49,980
 Something I believe that he might have done before, but what he didn't know was that earlier that day,

578
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,980
 they turned the power up on the spout itself.

579
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:56,980
 And as he sat on the nozzle, it cut through his colon and his testines.

580
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:59,980
 They say like a water knife, it kind of just went into him.

581
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:03,980
 Yeah, and he had to be rushed to hospital by his son, Michael.

582
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:05,980
 Why was his sub there?

583
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,980
 Oh, they're hanging out.

584
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,980
 He goes on going to a quick swim and that's in the fountain.

585
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:13,980
 I just can say, I think that there would be a clue that they'd upped the pressure

586
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:16,980
 by the fact that the water's going miles in the air.

587
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,980
 But it sounds to me like they upped the pressure.

588
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:22,980
 The moment it came up was as his bum was never ready.

589
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,980
 Was it the vertical nozzle?

590
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:25,980
 Yes.

591
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:31,980
 Was he, was he blasted into the air and sat in a cartoon style at the top of the fountain for a while?

592
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:37,980
 I'm imagine him and all his mates going to Las Vegas and sitting at the belagio as all the fountain's go up.

593
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:41,980
 What you can't see in that favor seen at the end of Ocean's 11 where they're all watching the belagio fountain

594
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:44,980
 just whimper half at the top of them.

595
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:48,980
 But apparently when he got there, he's so hard this guy.

596
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:53,980
 You know, he could go up Mount Everest in no top and no shoes or in shorts.

597
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:59,980
 They didn't know how serious the injury was because he was like, "Ah, tis butter, internal scratch."

598
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:03,980
 He now has a semi-colon.

599
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:08,980
 So it took ages until he fainted with pain and then after they did all the stuff on him

600
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:12,980
 he didn't have any antibiotics during recovery because he's such a hard man.

601
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:13,980
 Oh, yeah.

602
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:17,980
 It's not hard to disregard antibiotic term theory is real.

603
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:18,980
 Sorry.

604
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:19,980
 I've gone right off him now.

605
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,980
 I was actually with him even in the fountain store.

606
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,980
 Okay, he's a crazy guy.

607
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:26,980
 He's trying to suppress antibiotic resistance. That's a good thing you probably didn't need antibiotics.

608
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:29,980
 People should never take them unless they absolutely need them.

609
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:34,980
 I reckon them half takes like just four of them and then doesn't take the last three of them.

610
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:37,980
 He sounds like that kind of guy.

611
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,980
 Does he still alive?

612
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:40,980
 He is.

613
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:41,980
 Yeah, still going on.

614
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,980
 In that case, I don't think he does that.

615
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:46,980
 It wasn't everywhere they thought water was good for you.

616
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:49,980
 So in America, I was reading the 18th century,

617
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:53,980
 people thought cold water, if you drank cold water, you would die.

618
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:58,980
 And there was a French guy visiting for the Delphier,

619
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:03,980
 who said that several people die each year drinking the cold pump water.

620
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,980
 And so everyone started to leave it out to warm.

621
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:08,980
 And there are printed hand bills distributed everywhere

622
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,980
 and posters put up next to all water pumps.

623
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:14,980
 Saying, "Do not drink this straight away. Do not drink this cold.

624
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,980
 You must leave this to warm up."

625
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,980
 But he said, "All these teachings are ignored."

626
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:21,980
 And so, of course, there is death all over the place.

627
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:26,980
 Again, just not having the experiment time to work it out properly.

628
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:29,980
 You just think like, "Surely one or two people drank it and didn't die."

629
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:30,980
 You think?

630
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:32,980
 And people thought, "What happened there?"

631
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:33,980
 No one believed them.

632
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:34,980
 No, I believe them.

633
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:37,980
 But maybe you got like, you got a random bit of warm water in there.

634
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:40,980
 Because I've got a tap at home which is so cold that I want to die when I drink from it.

635
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:41,980
 It's really bad.

636
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:42,980
 Okay.

637
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:43,980
 Yeah.

638
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:44,980
 Yeah, okay.

639
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:45,980
 That's good.

640
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,980
 Thank you.

641
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:48,980
 Thank you.

642
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:49,980
 Yes.

643
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:53,980
 Somewhere there's a fan listening to our show who's piecing all these very micro bits of detail.

644
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:57,980
 They've got like a big board tap produces cold water.

645
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:58,980
 Let's sit there next.

646
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,980
 That's the tap said home.

647
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:01,980
 Yeah.

648
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:02,980
 For what?

649
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:05,980
 The most boring a bit tree ever written.

650
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:08,980
 Just slowly piecing together who mysterious Murray is.

651
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:09,980
 That's podcasting.

652
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:10,980
 It's nice to get to know people, isn't it?

653
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:11,980
 As you listen to them.

654
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:12,980
 Oh, yeah.

655
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:13,980
 There are really no two things about, you know.

656
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,980
 You've got very cold taps and you piss on the shower.

657
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:16,980
 That's it.

658
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:22,980
 Did you know that the inventor of the Brooklyn Bridge, I'm going to say inventor, I mean engineer.

659
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:25,980
 Yeah. Like to wrap himself in a damp cold sheet.

660
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:28,980
 I guess his name was John Roblin.

661
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,980
 Why did you do the sheet thing?

662
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:31,980
 No further data.

663
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:32,980
 Cool. Cool.

664
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:33,980
 Cool itself down.

665
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:34,980
 Probably.

666
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:38,980
 Like people just did used to thing way for your too hot or too cold and that was a massive problem.

667
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:39,980
 And I guess it is.

668
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:43,980
 If you've got hyperthermia or a massive fever it is.

669
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:48,980
 But people thought like, you know, if you were sick you could bake yourself colder or hotter and that would cure you.

670
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:49,980
 Yeah.

671
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:50,980
 Yeah.

672
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:51,980
 They didn't have cow pull.

673
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:52,980
 Yeah.

674
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:57,980
 I was looking at another thing that was happening around the same time in London.

675
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:05,980
 And this was a man called Banks, who had a horse called Morocco and it had shoes of silver.

676
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:10,980
 And it could dance to music, count and answer questions and do all sorts of tricks.

677
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:14,980
 And it once apparently climbed up St. Paul's Cathedral.

678
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,980
 It was really, really popular.

679
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:20,980
 Everyone in London loved this horse and everyone, whenever it was on display would go and see it.

680
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:26,980
 And then it went to Italy and he and the horse and the master were both burned on charges of sorcery.

681
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:27,980
 Oh.

682
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:30,980
 That's a bad tool.

683
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:33,980
 It's a risky rum with magic tricks in those days, isn't it?

684
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:34,980
 Yeah.

685
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:37,980
 Either you entertain people or you're a witch or a witch or a witch.

686
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:41,980
 And there are dogs and darren browns both to death in New Zealand.

687
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:48,980
 One more thing about Formula One is if you play the sound of a Formula One race to a Formula One driver

688
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:53,980
 and they're blindfolded, they can tell where the track is.

689
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:54,980
 What is it?

690
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:55,980
 What corners are?

691
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:56,980
 They can draw you a track.

692
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:58,980
 Well, they know because they know the track so well.

693
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:06,980
 So if they like, if it goes, and then it goes a bit quieter for a bit and then it goes louder and then quieter and louder and then quieter, they'll go that's monster.

694
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,980
 And that's without the commentary, right?

695
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:09,980
 Okay.

696
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:10,980
 That's nice.

697
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:18,980
 I love that there's a great thing you can watch online where Broadway dancers will have to stand in front of the stage and behind them,

698
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:24,980
 someone is doing one of the dance routines and they have to join the dance routine only by the sound of the steps.

699
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:25,980
 It's incredible.

700
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:30,980
 And they get it right so much they're hearing the patterns and then they leap into it and they match it.

701
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:33,980
 Do you reckon, Dan, you could watch the three of us doing a podcast?

702
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:36,980
 You'll just see in our mouths moving but you can't hear what we're saying.

703
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:41,980
 Do you reckon you could sort of join in and jump in at the right time and say the most sensible things?

704
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:44,980
 Yeah, yeah, I'd be like, "James is right, golf is interesting."

705
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:45,980
 Actually, yeah.

706
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,980
 Dan never jumps in anyway saying the most sensible things.

707
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,980
 It's sort of a rather than running an aerosol.

708
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:52,980
 This is how I run my whole game on this day.

709
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:55,980
 I'm not convinced he's heard anything moves down to the last 10 years.

710
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:58,980
 Do you know the saltiest big body of water in the world?

711
00:25:58,980 --> 00:25:59,980
 Dead sea.

712
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:00,980
 Dead sea.

713
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:01,980
 It's not, in fact.

714
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:02,980
 It's just really cool things.

715
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:06,980
 There are a couple of Antarctica that are the saltiest in the world, but you can't swim in them or anything.

716
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,980
 Obviously, because they're an Antarctica.

717
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:15,980
 But there is a place called Lake Retba in Senegal, which is 40% saltiness compared to Dead Sea is 34%.

718
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:18,980
 You know how you sink in the Dead Sea, aren't you?

719
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:19,980
 We've said this before.

720
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:20,980
 We have.

721
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:23,980
 The only passenger you reckon you might float in this 40%.

722
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:24,980
 But my tickets.

723
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:25,980
 I'm going to Senegal next week.

724
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:26,980
 You have to find someone else.

725
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:27,980
 I must find out.

726
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:31,980
 When you say 40% saltiness, is it 40% salt?

727
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:33,980
 Yeah, 40% concentration.

728
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:34,980
 Wow.

729
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:35,980
 And it's also pink.

730
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:36,980
 Cool, right?

731
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:37,980
 Double whammy.

732
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:40,980
 And you can't swim in it and people go and bathe in it.

733
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:41,980
 Cool.

734
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:43,980
 And it's got a special algae that makes it sort of orangey.

735
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:46,980
 It's one of those ones that says it's pink and all the photos look bright pink.

736
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:51,980
 And then you read the one blogger who says I went there and everyone's enhanced their photos enormously.

737
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:53,980
 But still, you can float in it, you know?

738
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:54,980
 You can walk around in it.

739
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:55,980
 Very cool.

740
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:56,980
 That's nice.

741
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:59,980
 I've been to one in, um, what was it?

742
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:05,980
 Maybe it was in America where like animals go in there and then they turn to salt.

743
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:07,980
 You know, where they petrify.

744
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:08,980
 Yeah.

745
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:11,980
 But actually, like it turns out it's a bit of a myth.

746
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:13,980
 Like they die through natural causes.

747
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:16,980
 And then slowly the salt sort of grows on their body.

748
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:21,980
 But people say, oh, this, you know, pelican drank a little bit of water and they turn to salt.

749
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:22,980
 That doesn't happen.

750
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,980
 But still believe this stuff in America.

751
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:25,980
 It's what we've said.

752
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,980
 I'm not sure anyone really believes it.

753
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:30,980
 But yeah, they believe a little mad stuff in America.

754
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:33,980
 And in Britain, I mean, that wouldn't be the craziest thing, would it?

755
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:34,980
 No.

756
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:35,980
 They believe today.

757
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:39,980
 In fact, when I went there, there was like an overlooking road.

758
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:42,980
 And you could put like your business cards there for some reason.

759
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:44,980
 People were doing it and I had some fish ones.

760
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:45,980
 So I put them there.

761
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:47,980
 So we have a made our mark.

762
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:48,980
 Great.

763
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,980
 We haven't, I haven't heard from them yet.

764
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,980
 They've wanted to saltify.

765
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:57,980
 The wife of lots is there.

766
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:00,980
 Do you know Henry VIII executed all the horses that were too short?

767
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,980
 Is that like a eugenics thing?

768
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:03,980
 Basically, yeah.

769
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:06,980
 He decided that the horse stock was getting a bit shit.

770
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:08,980
 That's early for eugenics as well, isn't it?

771
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:09,980
 He's a pioneer.

772
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:12,980
 He is a pioneer in his day and I respect it.

773
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:17,980
 Not only a tick for the horrific reputation, Henry VIII.

774
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:18,980
 This is it.

775
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:19,980
 This is it.

776
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:20,980
 Last part of entry act.

777
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:21,980
 The breed of horses act 1535.

778
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:24,980
 No stallion under 15 hands was allowed to exist anymore.

779
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:26,980
 And no mayor under 13 hands.

780
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:27,980
 Which is quite big.

781
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:28,980
 So it's quite big.

782
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:29,980
 Not just they die out.

783
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:32,980
 Just that you have to actively offer your horse.

784
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:33,980
 There were coals every year.

785
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:35,980
 It's terrible when I run the part of land.

786
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:36,980
 I would try and get around it.

787
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:39,980
 Yeah, you were put three horses in a trench coat.

788
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:40,980
 Oh yeah.

789
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:45,980
 I would paint the horse with, is it vertical stripes or horizontal stripes?

790
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:51,980
 I would make the horse carry around a smaller horse with it.

791
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,980
 Or put the load in and you have to kill off that horse.

792
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:56,980
 I would hire someone with small hands.

793
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,980
 So the horse cleared the bar.

794
00:28:58,980 --> 00:28:59,980
 Yes.

795
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:00,980
 That worked.

796
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:02,980
 Maybe that's why horseshoes were invented.

797
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,980
 Was a little platform shoes for horses to save them.

798
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,980
 They used to look like the spice girls, didn't they?

799
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:07,980
 Yes.

800
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,980
 Mars was quite important in early Rome, wasn't he?

801
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:12,980
 And he was associated with woodpeckers.

802
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:17,980
 Which meant that there was a law against eating woodpeckers in ancient Rome.

803
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:20,980
 It doesn't feel like a law that would impact many people's lives too.

804
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:21,980
 Oh, they're so delicious.

805
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,980
 Are they really healthy?

806
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,980
 For all we know, they're incredibly yummy.

807
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:26,980
 Yeah.

808
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:27,980
 I doubt it.

809
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:30,980
 They've got those strong skulls to withstand all the pecking.

810
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:31,980
 They scramble themselves.

811
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:32,980
 They're very...

812
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:35,980
 I think with peckertongs was a thing for a while.

813
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:36,980
 People would eat woodpeckertongs.

814
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:37,980
 They're very long, don't they?

815
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:40,980
 They've got tongs so long that they wrap around their brains.

816
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:41,980
 Yeah.

817
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:42,980
 It was protecting the brain in part.

818
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:43,980
 Sorry.

819
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:44,980
 I think it is.

820
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:45,980
 Yeah, yeah.

821
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:47,980
 I thought you meant woodpeckertongs like as a piece of cutlery

822
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:50,980
 with which you ate woodpeckers, specifically like you have, you know.

823
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:52,980
 I would peg a fork.

824
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:54,980
 Oh, this is Jones' coming round.

825
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:55,980
 And get the woodpeckertongs.

826
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:56,980
 Oh, no.

827
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,980
 Oh, what a faux pas.

828
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:01,980
 I'm just annoying on annoying car noises.

829
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:06,980
 The car horn, quite annoying now, used to be so much worse.

830
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:10,980
 So the word "claxen" in fact comes from, was invented for cars.

831
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:11,980
 Jeremy Claxon.

832
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:12,980
 Yes.

833
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:13,980
 Yes.

834
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:14,980
 We invented it.

835
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:17,980
 Why hasn't he changed his name?

836
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:18,980
 You could.

837
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:22,980
 So this was sort of pre-war, pre-second-mold war.

838
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:24,980
 Cars had horns that would like claxons.

839
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:25,980
 So you know the claxon noise.

840
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:26,980
 It's like, "Woooow!"

841
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:27,980
 "Awoga!"

842
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:28,980
 "Awoga!"

843
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:29,980
 Yeah.

844
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:30,980
 It was that, but you...

845
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:33,980
 What was I saying to you guys last week that my grandma always honked the horn when she turned...

846
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:34,980
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

847
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:35,980
 It took corners.

848
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:36,980
 Well, that used to be the rule.

849
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:40,980
 You'd be fined if you didn't, because there was no other way of knowing when car engines weren't as big.

850
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:45,980
 And so there were constantly, whenever anyone turned a corner, when everyone was coming up to a junction,

851
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:49,980
 whenever you were about to park, you beeped your "Awoga!"

852
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:50,980
 And people hated it.

853
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:53,980
 It's kind of like the legacy of the man with the red flag.

854
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:54,980
 Yes.

855
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:55,980
 A little bit.

856
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:56,980
 But less annoying, the man with the red flag.

857
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:57,980
 I don't think I'd mind that as much.

858
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:58,980
 No.

859
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:01,980
 It's just a bit like, beep, beep, vehicle reversing.

860
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:04,980
 So, do you know who the godfather of backing up is?

861
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,980
 Like the godfather of soul.

862
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:07,980
 Yeah, just like that.

863
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:11,980
 Do you mean you mean the sound or literally backing up a car?

864
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,980
 The sound that's made when you backup a car.

865
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:14,980
 The beeping.

866
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:15,980
 So, when you're reversing.

867
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:17,980
 So, who's the godfather of creating that sound?

868
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:18,980
 I don't know what you're asking.

869
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:19,980
 It's a man called Ed Peterson.

870
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,980
 Oh, it's just about saying him.

871
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,980
 So, he was the pioneer in the West.

872
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:28,980
 And he may have been beaten to it by Matthew Saburo Yamaguchi in 1953.

873
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:33,980
 But, Peterson noticed, he was working at a dam, a construction project, a huge construction project.

874
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:38,980
 And he noticed, gosh, people keep being killed or injured when really heavy vehicles reverse into them.

875
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:42,980
 If only there was somewhere, and he said that the flag men were just not doing their jobs.

876
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:48,980
 And that was the system that weirdly, you know, like waving flags around, saying, look out, that system wasn't working.

877
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:52,980
 I can't believe if you're holding a flag to wave and a person about to get run over.

878
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:56,980
 Why aren't you also going, there's a car running you over, there's a car on quick and get out of the way.

879
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:57,980
 I don't know.

880
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:58,980
 I don't know.

881
00:31:58,980 --> 00:31:59,980
 Maybe they're standing at a distance.

882
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:00,980
 Probably a union thing.

883
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:01,980
 Yeah, a union thing.

884
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:04,980
 If we won't pay the extra for that.

885
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,980
 Anyway, just wanted to give him his credit.

886
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:07,980
 Ed Peterson.

887
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:08,980
 All right.

888
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:11,980
 Do you know who has the best car horns?

889
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:12,980
 Ooh.

890
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:14,980
 What country?

891
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:19,980
 Oh, is there a country where it's, you know, like a hundred pounds, like in juke's of hazard?

892
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,980
 Ha, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.

893
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:25,980
 Ah, so now you're interpreting it differently to how I mean.

894
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:26,980
 The best.

895
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:30,980
 So, by best, it's long-lasting, louder.

896
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:32,980
 This is an india.

897
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:33,980
 Yeah, yeah.

898
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:34,980
 It is an india.

899
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:40,980
 And the reason is is that because the culture of driving there has a much more emphasis on the beeping when you're in.

900
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:41,980
 And so they need cars.

901
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:49,980
 They actually make, like, Audi make stronger, better horns so that they don't run them down with the amount that they're using them.

902
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:50,980
 Daz.

903
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:52,980
 They do use it properly in India.

904
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:55,980
 They use it to tell you I'm about to drive into India.

905
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:56,980
 You're a danger, yeah, yeah.

906
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:59,980
 Well, that supplies that incredibly bad drivers.

907
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:02,980
 They're always using it properly, but they're always using it.

908
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,980
 I think it's just lots of cars.

909
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:05,980
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

910
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:08,980
 And the weight of Cross the road is just to get cracking.

911
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:09,980
 It's like British kettles.

912
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:11,980
 They just long, they're long-lasting.

913
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:13,980
 This is personal anecdote, but.

914
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:14,980
 British kettles.

915
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:15,980
 British kettles.

916
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:17,980
 Yeah, I was just confused by the analogy.

917
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:20,980
 Well, I'm just remembering because Dan's wife was bought like 20 kettles.

918
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:21,980
 Yes.

919
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:23,980
 She keeps buying European ones because they look nice.

920
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:27,980
 They keep dying because they can't keep up with the British tea consuming out of the kilowatts.

921
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:32,980
 It's not like, dude, it's just kind of flooding that.

922
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:37,980
 Did you come across the car that Cadillac invented which had a working toilet in it?

923
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:40,980
 Oh, sorry, not Cadillac invented.

924
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:43,980
 One random bloke modified so that he could...

925
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:48,980
 This was a guy called Louis Mata and he wanted to drive 10,000 kilometers without stopping.

926
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:50,980
 L.A. to New York and back.

927
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:51,980
 Right.

928
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:52,980
 So he must have put the toilet on the driving seat.

929
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:53,980
 He put the toilet...

930
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:54,980
 Well, there were a couple of them in the car.

931
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:56,980
 How long does it take to drive that distance?

932
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:58,980
 Must be like 10 days.

933
00:33:58,980 --> 00:33:59,980
 Might have taken...

934
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:01,980
 That would be a thousand kilometers a day.

935
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:02,980
 Maybe a bit longer than that.

936
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:03,980
 I think that's quite a bit.

937
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:04,980
 Yeah.

938
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:08,980
 Or they'll have to stop at some stage to sleep.

939
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,980
 Well, no, but there were a couple of them in the car.

940
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:11,980
 So they would...

941
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:12,980
 They would shift into the driving seat.

942
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:14,980
 This was in 1952.

943
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:16,980
 For God knows why he wanted to do this.

944
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:19,980
 But he'd been in the Navy. He was an engineer.

945
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:21,980
 And it had a toilet. It had a shower.

946
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:24,980
 It had a TV, a fridge, and a sink.

947
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:27,980
 And they were escorted when they were in a town by the local police

948
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:28,980
 who would help them through the traffic lights.

949
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,980
 So they could literally keep moving.

950
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:32,980
 Just like a caravan, really.

951
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:33,980
 Yeah.

952
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:35,980
 It's just like a caravan, except I love this.

953
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:37,980
 What's another flaw in this plan?

954
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:40,980
 We have to let out what you're carrying.

955
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:44,980
 Nice. He's got a shed load of petrol that's filling out the car.

956
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:46,980
 You can refuel on the go.

957
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:47,980
 That's cool.

958
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:48,980
 That's cool.

959
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:50,980
 And what if the worst happens?

960
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:51,980
 You burst a tire.

961
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:52,980
 Yeah.

962
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:55,980
 They had a system to change a tire while the car was driving.

963
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:56,980
 Wow.

964
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:57,980
 It's so cool.

965
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:00,980
 As Jack would lift up one tire and this tiny little supermarket trolley wheel

966
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:02,980
 would take that corner of the car.

967
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:05,980
 And then his friends would lean over the side and change the tire.

968
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:07,980
 And then change it back and then you just pop it back up.

969
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:11,980
 You would be impossible to steer if it's got a supermarket trolley wheel.

970
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:17,980
 The laziest on this bit of observation of comedy that's ever been made.

971
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:24,980
 Okay, that's it.

972
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:25,980
 That is all of our outtakes.

973
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:26,980
 We hope you enjoyed that.

974
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:27,980
 You got any comments?

975
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:28,980
 You got any questions?

976
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:29,980
 You got any extra facts?

977
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:31,980
 Why not send them to podcast@ky.com?

978
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:37,980
 And if they are seen by Andy, they might make their way onto an upcoming drop us a line episode.

979
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:38,980
 We love getting your emails.

980
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:39,980
 So please do send them in.

981
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:41,980
 Do remember the crosswire festival.

982
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:42,980
 Sixth of July in Sheffield.

983
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:43,980
 Get your tickets on our website.

984
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,980
 No such thing as a fish.com.

985
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:46,980
 Otherwise come back in a couple of weeks.

986
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:49,980
 We'll have another bonus episode ready for you club fishers.

987
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:50,980
 Until then, goodbye.
