00:00:01,00:00:04,"Hey Clubfish members, welcome to this week's bonus bit of content."
00:00:04,00:00:07,We have got a compilation episode for you today.
00:00:07,00:00:11,"But before we get into it, I just want to quickly remind some of you who may have missed"
00:00:11,00:00:17,"the news that we are going to do a live show, July 6th, at the Crossed Wires Festival,"
00:00:17,00:00:21,"which is a festival that was co-created by our good friend, Alice Lavigne, of my dad"
00:00:21,00:00:22,wrote a porno.
00:00:22,00:00:23,They started last year.
00:00:23,00:00:24,It was a massive success.
00:00:24,00:00:28,"They're coming back this year and we were really excited to be invited, so we're going"
00:00:28,00:00:29,to be doing a live recording.
00:00:29,00:00:32,"Now, we didn't do Sheffield on our tour last year."
00:00:32,00:00:36,"We really missed out on getting to that bit of the country, so if you're in that area,"
00:00:36,00:00:37,come along.
00:00:37,00:00:39,We're doing a full live recording.
00:00:39,00:00:41,There'll be a few extra fun bits thrown in as well.
00:00:41,00:00:44,"And if you want to get tickets, go to nosuchthingasaffish.com."
00:00:44,00:00:46,You'll find all the links there.
00:00:46,00:00:48,And why not check out what other podcasts are on.
00:00:48,00:00:49,It is genuinely a great pod festival.
00:00:49,00:00:50,All right.
00:00:50,00:00:52,"Well, let's get to the compilation."
00:00:52,00:00:55,Here are the best of the outtakes that never made it to the main show.
00:00:55,00:00:56,Here we go.
00:00:56,00:01:18,"She turned up to the unveiling of the Statue of Liberty, which I really like, and she turned"
00:01:18,00:01:21,that she was not invited.
00:01:21,00:01:25,"But she turned up on a cattle barge, so she turned up on a barge with a megaphone, and"
00:01:25,00:01:30,"shouting that it was a gigantic lie, a travesty, and a mockery to make the representation of"
00:01:30,00:01:33,Liberty a woman when actual women had so few rights at the time.
00:01:33,00:01:35,"So that was her, that was her prototype."
00:01:35,00:01:36,"No, she's shackled, though, isn't she?"
00:01:36,00:01:38,"Oh, is she broken her shackles?"
00:01:38,00:01:39,I don't think she's shackled.
00:01:39,00:01:40,Is she not?
00:01:40,00:01:41,I should not have been up it.
00:01:41,00:01:42,And I don't know.
00:01:42,00:01:43,You haven't been able to see her on the inside.
00:01:43,00:01:44,You can't see me out.
00:01:44,00:01:46,It's like Annie from there.
00:01:46,00:01:48,"Oh, and I haven't been up it either."
00:01:48,00:01:50,"Sorry, I was missing my name."
00:01:50,00:01:51,What just happened?
00:01:51,00:01:52,I've been near it.
00:01:52,00:01:53,"Oh, yeah."
00:01:53,00:01:54,"We all, but we went together."
00:01:54,00:01:55,We were near it.
00:01:55,00:01:56,We went to New York.
00:01:56,00:01:57,I've been closer than that.
00:01:57,00:01:58,Are we?
00:01:58,00:01:59,"Yeah, yeah."
00:01:59,00:02:00,"But she's not, I don't think."
00:02:00,00:02:01,I don't think she's shackled.
00:02:01,00:02:02,I don't think she's shackled.
00:02:02,00:02:03,"I've got one of her legs had a shackle on it, but maybe I'm wrong."
00:02:03,00:02:04,"Oh, she's got slippers."
00:02:04,00:02:05,I know that much.
00:02:05,00:02:06,Slipers.
00:02:06,00:02:07,I think they're more sandals.
00:02:07,00:02:08,"Yeah, slip-ons."
00:02:08,00:02:09,"Like, the open toad."
00:02:09,00:02:10,You could see her feet.
00:02:10,00:02:11,Yeah.
00:02:11,00:02:12,She's a woman in comfortable shoes.
00:02:12,00:02:13,That's why you stayed outside.
00:02:13,00:02:15,You got one of those wicky feet things going on.
00:02:15,00:02:20,So true feminist should campaign for the Statue of Liberty to be a man?
00:02:20,00:02:21,Yeah.
00:02:21,00:02:26,"And yet, my campaign has got done nothing."
00:02:26,00:02:30,I have one more caddy called Daff to Willie Gunn.
00:02:30,00:02:33,He is an old school one in Scotland.
00:02:33,00:02:35,"He was from the 19th century, early 19th century."
00:02:35,00:02:39,"He always wore four coats, three or four pairs of trousers."
00:02:39,00:02:40,It is cold in Scotland.
00:02:40,00:02:41,It is cold.
00:02:41,00:02:43,"He couldn't afford, like, a big coat or anything."
00:02:43,00:02:46,So he just wore lots of small ones.
00:02:46,00:02:51,And he just fell sick on me.
00:02:51,00:02:55,He would only eat milk and soft vegetables his whole life.
00:02:55,00:02:56,Okay.
00:02:56,00:02:58,And he would be in St Andrews in Scotland.
00:02:58,00:03:02,"And then when the golf season finished, he would walk off."
00:03:02,00:03:03,And no one knew where he went.
00:03:03,00:03:05,He just presumably walked home somewhere.
00:03:05,00:03:08,"And then when the season started, he walked back again."
00:03:08,00:03:09,And that was it.
00:03:09,00:03:11,"Well, he's really great."
00:03:11,00:03:15,And then one day they stumbled upon a grave which said he died in 1520.
00:03:15,00:03:20,"Well, one day in 1820, he walked north, never to return."
00:03:20,00:03:21,Oh.
00:03:21,00:03:23,"And to this day, nobody knows what happened to him."
00:03:23,00:03:24,Stand out there.
00:03:24,00:03:25,"Well, that's great."
00:03:25,00:03:26,That was great.
00:03:26,00:03:27,Do you know that fact?
00:03:27,00:03:28,Have I ever said it on this?
00:03:28,00:03:29,I don't think I have.
00:03:29,00:03:32,"It was during the winter war, I think, between Russia and Finland."
00:03:32,00:03:35,And there was a guy who was captured.
00:03:35,00:03:39,And it turned out they was trying to hide in the snow by putting diaries on his head.
00:03:39,00:03:43,And he reckoned that it worked for ages because they were white diaries.
00:03:43,00:03:45,And no one could see him.
00:03:45,00:03:48,But why had he taken so many diaries to a corporate zone?
00:03:48,00:03:51,Did he just think I know this is going to work?
00:03:51,00:03:55,I think he might have plundered them from houses.
00:03:55,00:03:57,"Really, of course, because you would get diaries in it."
00:03:57,00:03:58,"I mean, you don't get diaries anymore."
00:03:58,00:03:59,"It's a really, really sad fact."
00:03:59,00:04:02,"I mean, you get sort of weak diaries on trains these days."
00:04:02,00:04:04,"But even then, only on nice trains, they're not very good."
00:04:04,00:04:07,"Let's make me think, if you're Jewish and you have a Yamakar,"
00:04:07,00:04:10,"do you, if you were going certain places with the army,"
00:04:10,00:04:12,would you match it to your environment?
00:04:12,00:04:14,"You're going somewhere winter, where I'm white."
00:04:14,00:04:15,Kamalka.
00:04:15,00:04:19,"But in all these scenarios, you have, and in this one you've described,"
00:04:19,00:04:21,do you have to bury yourself up to the eyebrows?
00:04:21,00:04:25,"I think it was more like his hair would show up against the snow,"
00:04:25,00:04:27,but you maybe had a white coat.
00:04:27,00:04:29,Did you get caught when some Russians turn up?
00:04:29,00:04:30,"I thought, ""Oh, a lovely comfy armchair."""
00:04:30,00:04:32,I'll just stand up after I'm here.
00:04:32,00:04:34,Just put like nothing to you under that.
00:04:34,00:04:36,"Well, it was entirely doing here."
00:04:36,00:04:38,"You know what, I only have remembered the story, so."
00:04:38,00:04:40,"Wait, is a Dolly's view ahead, isn't it?"
00:04:40,00:04:42,Is it a coaster?
00:04:42,00:04:44,"Dolly is the thing you put on a table and you put,"
00:04:44,00:04:46,"it's a bit bigger than a coaster, but you put your tea part on it."
00:04:46,00:04:47,What am I thinking of?
00:04:47,00:04:49,I think it's a lacy.
00:04:49,00:04:50,An anti-macasser.
00:04:50,00:04:51,An anti-macasser.
00:04:51,00:04:52,I'm so sorry.
00:04:52,00:04:54,An anti-macasser is the thing you don't get anymore.
00:04:54,00:04:56,I've got doggies coming out of my ass.
00:04:56,00:04:58,"It's winter, the same material though."
00:04:58,00:05:00,So you obviously was a material based confusion.
00:05:00,00:05:03,"Anyway, I don't think a Dolly would work as an anti-macasser,"
00:05:03,00:05:06,"because it's got holes in it, so all the macastras would get on the chair."
00:05:06,00:05:07,You're right.
00:05:07,00:05:08,What's a macasser?
00:05:08,00:05:09,A macasser.
00:05:09,00:05:10,We have a lot of topic.
00:05:10,00:05:11,Macasser is hair oil.
00:05:11,00:05:12,Yeah.
00:05:12,00:05:13,"In the 19th century, you'd have lots of you."
00:05:13,00:05:14,Slather yourself.
00:05:14,00:05:15,Yeah.
00:05:15,00:05:18,"So that's why, we don't need to confine this in the 19th century."
00:05:18,00:05:20,"Sorry, you popped your tiger bar when you're here."
00:05:20,00:05:23,Your anti-macasser is when you go on the train or at a chair.
00:05:23,00:05:24,You sit in a comfy chair.
00:05:24,00:05:28,"You need a layer of cloth between your head and the fabric of the chair,"
00:05:28,00:05:30,so that the oil doesn't soak into the chair itself.
00:05:30,00:05:32,So that's an anti-macasser.
00:05:32,00:05:33,James is right.
00:05:33,00:05:34,A Dolly is the kind of coaster.
00:05:34,00:05:37,Is that what they put on airplanes when you say that this is an anti-macasser?
00:05:37,00:05:39,Should we talk about El Frank Balm?
00:05:39,00:05:40,"Yeah, sure."
00:05:40,00:05:43,I've only got anti-macasser material.
00:05:43,00:05:47,"Do you know how scientists, if they've got a healer monster,"
00:05:47,00:05:50,"to test its health levels, how they test them?"
00:05:50,00:05:51,Okay.
00:05:51,00:05:52,So I'm going to give you a clue.
00:05:52,00:05:53,I'm going to give you a clue.
00:05:53,00:05:54,I'm going to give you a clue.
00:05:54,00:05:55,A treadmill is classic.
00:05:55,00:05:56,"No, no."
00:05:56,00:05:57,Nice.
00:05:57,00:05:58,That's good.
00:05:58,00:05:59,It's actually not to test how fit they are in a gym sense.
00:05:59,00:06:01,It's more like how many reserves do they have?
00:06:01,00:06:02,How long do they go to last?
00:06:02,00:06:05,"Take tails to conference, because that's where they get the first."
00:06:05,00:06:07,It's related to Archimedes.
00:06:07,00:06:09,They put it in a bath and how much water comes out.
00:06:09,00:06:10,Exactly.
00:06:10,00:06:12,They dunk their tail in a cup of water.
00:06:12,00:06:14,And then you just measure how much it comes out.
00:06:14,00:06:15,And then you know how fat the tail is.
00:06:15,00:06:16,It was a bit of an easy clue.
00:06:16,00:06:17,I'll have to apologize about that.
00:06:17,00:06:19,"But, you know, I didn't want it to go on forever."
00:06:19,00:06:20,It was going to be a fun game.
00:06:20,00:06:22,"They are all venomous, right?"
00:06:22,00:06:25,And I think only two people are recorded to have ever died.
00:06:25,00:06:27,One last year and one in 1930.
00:06:27,00:06:30,But the reason they're not very dangerous
00:06:30,00:06:33,is that they don't have a mechanism to inject their venom.
00:06:33,00:06:36,What they've got is they've got teeth with grooves in.
00:06:36,00:06:40,And they have to bite into you and then just champ chew up and down
00:06:40,00:06:42,and up and down and up and down and flood their mouth with venom
00:06:42,00:06:44,and chew the venom into you.
00:06:44,00:06:47,So it's quite hard for them to have a victim.
00:06:47,00:06:49,So the guttion is very inefficient.
00:06:49,00:06:51,I read it takes like 15 minutes.
00:06:51,00:06:53,"Well, the guy who died last year, he'd been bitten for four minutes."
00:06:53,00:06:56,There was a suggestion that you might have had an allergic reaction.
00:06:56,00:06:57,Interesting.
00:06:57,00:06:59,"Yeah, it can be quite scary, I think."
00:06:59,00:07:04,"There was a 1959 movie called The Giant Helomonster,"
00:07:04,00:07:09,which apparently features a Mexican bearded lizard instead of a Helomonster.
00:07:09,00:07:11,"Yeah, you wouldn't get away with that these days."
00:07:11,00:07:12,"No, exactly."
00:07:12,00:07:16,"You have to skin an actual Helomonster, don't you?"
00:07:16,00:07:20,But it was the first ever double feature film
00:07:20,00:07:23,where you paid for one film and you got two.
00:07:23,00:07:24,That's great.
00:07:24,00:07:28,And it was the first ever film that was shot and produced in Dallas.
00:07:28,00:07:30,Really?
00:07:30,00:07:35,The fact that you got the double feature that you got was The Giant Helomonster
00:07:35,00:07:38,and the other one was called The Killer Shrews.
00:07:38,00:07:39,"Oh, wow."
00:07:39,00:07:40,Which one headlines?
00:07:40,00:07:42,"I mean, it's going to be a double headline now."
00:07:42,00:07:44,It is a double headline.
00:07:44,00:07:47,"Yeah, I watched the trailer for The Helomonster movie."
00:07:47,00:07:48,"Oh, yeah."
00:07:48,00:07:49,It's wild.
00:07:49,00:07:50,It's wonderful.
00:07:50,00:07:51,"Actually, I lie."
00:07:51,00:07:55,"I watched it for the remake in 2012, simply called Helah,"
00:07:55,00:07:57,with an exclamation mark.
00:07:57,00:07:59,"Yeah, it's unbelievable these things get remade."
00:07:59,00:08:02,It was at the time acknowledged as an unbelievably bad film.
00:08:02,00:08:03,Who's remaking it?
00:08:03,00:08:05,"Someone, and it's as bad."
00:08:05,00:08:07,Did they not remake The Killer Shrews?
00:08:07,00:08:08,"Oh, I didn't check that."
00:08:08,00:08:09,I should have.
00:08:09,00:08:10,It's in development help.
00:08:10,00:08:11,"Yeah, yeah."
00:08:11,00:08:13,Just on strong materials.
00:08:13,00:08:14,This is a stiffer material.
00:08:14,00:08:15,It's all about the hardest.
00:08:15,00:08:16,There's also the strongest.
00:08:16,00:08:19,"And that's like, how much can you hang off something, basically?"
00:08:19,00:08:21,Strongest natural material.
00:08:21,00:08:22,Thought of ages made.
00:08:22,00:08:23,Spindy.
00:08:23,00:08:24,Spindy.
00:08:24,00:08:25,Spindy.
00:08:25,00:08:26,Spindy.
00:08:26,00:08:27,Wow.
00:08:27,00:08:28,Wow.
00:08:28,00:08:29,I can just imagine.
00:08:29,00:08:32,"I don't know, as the host of Pewdiversity Challenge."
00:08:32,00:08:35,"Someone gets an answer like, oh, no, is it?"
00:08:35,00:08:36,It's so Milton.
00:08:36,00:08:37,Yeah.
00:08:37,00:08:39,"Well, I've always been so skeptical about this,"
00:08:39,00:08:40,"and I know scientists have always claimed it,"
00:08:40,00:08:42,"but I've just passed so many spiders' webs,"
00:08:42,00:08:45,"and often I pull at them, and they break."
00:08:45,00:08:47,I am unbelievably strong now.
00:08:47,00:08:48,I am.
00:08:48,00:08:49,You're like God's love.
00:08:49,00:08:50,"I'm not kidding, yes."
00:08:50,00:08:52,"Friends of the flies, amateur Jinsky."
00:08:52,00:08:54,I never rate them.
00:08:54,00:08:57,"I get it, it's pound for pound, they're very thin,"
00:08:57,00:08:58,but it seems so unlikely.
00:08:58,00:09:00,"And anyway, they've been supplanted recently,"
00:09:00,00:09:02,and I believe this much more.
00:09:02,00:09:04,"They always say, answer really strong,"
00:09:04,00:09:06,but I just stand on them and look at this.
00:09:06,00:09:07,Squish.
00:09:07,00:09:11,It's like I don't understand proportionality.
00:09:11,00:09:15,"Anyway, it was recently found that the strongest material is limpit teeth."
00:09:15,00:09:18,"So you know, limpits, like the common limpit they see on beaches."
00:09:18,00:09:20,"Their teeth are actually on their tongue,"
00:09:20,00:09:22,like we were talking about a bit earlier with molasses.
00:09:22,00:09:26,"They've got this tongue, and they use it for the same purpose as parrot fish,"
00:09:26,00:09:29,which is just a scrape algae off the rocks.
00:09:29,00:09:33,And apparently the comparison is a single string of spaghetti holding.
00:09:33,00:09:34,"The scientist said,"
00:09:34,00:09:37,"""3,500 kilogram bags of sugar,"
00:09:37,00:09:40,"which I didn't think was that good a comparison."""
00:09:40,00:09:45,"So I'm deciding to say it's like a string of spaghetti holding a large walrus,"
00:09:45,00:09:48,or my car with five adults inside.
00:09:48,00:09:49,If you know my car.
00:09:49,00:09:50,Wow.
00:09:50,00:09:51,I know your car.
00:09:51,00:09:52,I know your car.
00:09:52,00:09:56,"It's not like the small, it's a normal, small-ish sized car, right?"
00:09:56,00:09:57,It's a Skoda Fabia.
00:09:57,00:09:58,Yeah.
00:09:58,00:10:01,I'm not sure if to say it.
00:10:01,00:10:04,"That's amazing, that's spaghetti."
00:10:04,00:10:06,I think it doesn't matter because it's about the...
00:10:06,00:10:07,Please.
00:10:07,00:10:08,Which of it?
00:10:08,00:10:09,It doesn't matter.
00:10:09,00:10:11,You've been to Anna's Italian restaurant.
00:10:11,00:10:15,It's a nightmare.
00:10:15,00:10:18,"It's really hard to turn it around your fork, isn't it?"
00:10:18,00:10:22,It's Al Dente.
00:10:22,00:10:24,I tell you one last...
00:10:24,00:10:27,"This is an alternative, actually, to a Zampig."
00:10:27,00:10:28,Yeah.
00:10:28,00:10:29,"Because, you know, others are available."
00:10:29,00:10:30,But much better.
00:10:30,00:10:31,Vibes.
00:10:31,00:10:32,Oh.
00:10:32,00:10:33,Okay.
00:10:33,00:10:37,Which is an acronym that stands for the Vibrating Ingestible Bioelectric Simulator.
00:10:37,00:10:42,And it is a pill that you swallow that...
00:10:42,00:10:45,Wiggles and tickles and jiggles inside you.
00:10:45,00:10:47,And makes you think you're full.
00:10:47,00:10:50,"It's a battery, a motor, a little vibrating motor and a membrane."
00:10:50,00:10:52,"And when you swallow it, the membrane dissolves."
00:10:52,00:10:54,"You know what it sounds like to me, Andy?"
00:10:54,00:10:55,A magic bean.
00:10:55,00:10:58,And I've got a lot to sell you.
00:10:58,00:11:01,"Well, it's been tested in the last couple of years in 2023."
00:11:01,00:11:03,It's been tested on pigs.
00:11:03,00:11:04,It hasn't got to human trials yet.
00:11:04,00:11:06,But they ate 40% less.
00:11:06,00:11:07,And pigs love to eat.
00:11:07,00:11:08,They're pigs everywhere.
00:11:08,00:11:09,Love to eat.
00:11:09,00:11:12,"And it's been tested on young Yorks or pigs, apparently."
00:11:12,00:11:16,"And basically, means that your stomach has been jiggled around."
00:11:16,00:11:18,"And it thinks, oh, well, there must be loads of food in here."
00:11:18,00:11:19,Really?
00:11:19,00:11:20,"And then, yeah."
00:11:20,00:11:21,Wow.
00:11:21,00:11:23,But then what do I have to eat to get rid of that thing?
00:11:23,00:11:25,You just eat another one and it pushes the first one through.
00:11:25,00:11:26,That's fine.
00:11:26,00:11:27,Right.
00:11:27,00:11:28,"Okay, and then see a big one and a big one."
00:11:28,00:11:29,Wow.
00:11:29,00:11:30,What a weird poo.
00:11:30,00:11:33,"That will feel like, because it's vibrating out your butt."
00:11:33,00:11:35,Here's an interesting thing.
00:11:35,00:11:38,"Avalanche is, and not nearly as deadly as they used to be."
00:11:38,00:11:42,And more than half of people who are stuck in the Avalanche's survive these days.
00:11:42,00:11:43,Wow.
00:11:43,00:11:47,"And they've got loads of new survival devices that you can have that,"
00:11:47,00:11:51,"if you're skiing off piece, you might have them with you."
00:11:51,00:11:56,"One of them, which is really cool, is a thing called the Avalanche Airbag system."
00:11:56,00:12:00,"And what you do is when you're skiing and you see an Avalanche coming, you go, oh, shit."
00:12:00,00:12:06,"And you pull a toggle and it just puts like an airbag around you, like you're in a..."
00:12:06,00:12:07,Zor.
00:12:07,00:12:08,Like you're in a Zor.
00:12:08,00:12:09,But it makes you massive.
00:12:09,00:12:12,It like puts this huge sort of airbag around you.
00:12:12,00:12:14,And can you guess how it works?
00:12:14,00:12:15,This is really amazing.
00:12:15,00:12:17,Is it something to do with pressure up in the mountains?
00:12:17,00:12:19,"Well, like how it's inviting."
00:12:19,00:12:23,"So you know when you get musely, for instance, you get a big box of musely."
00:12:23,00:12:26,And at the top are all like the big nuts and stuff.
00:12:26,00:12:28,But at the bottom are all the little grainy bits.
00:12:28,00:12:30,"Yeah, this is like, it's got a name, this effect."
00:12:30,00:12:33,"Yeah, it's called like the Brazil nut effect or something like that."
00:12:33,00:12:35,"Well, this makes you really big."
00:12:35,00:12:38,"And so when the Avalanche is coming down, like a Brazil nut,"
00:12:38,00:12:42,you float to the top and all the small bits of snow goes to the bottom.
00:12:42,00:12:43,Wow.
00:12:43,00:12:44,Isn't that amazing?
00:12:44,00:12:46,It's called the principle of inverse segregation.
00:12:46,00:12:47,Wow.
00:12:47,00:12:49,And so it keeps you near the top and it makes you easier to find.
00:12:49,00:12:53,"And while you're waiting, you've got all that musely to get you out of the pie."
00:12:53,00:12:56,Have many people done that on purpose?
00:12:56,00:12:58,Because I'd imagine it would be tempting.
00:12:58,00:13:01,It's been used in Europe for over 10 years.
00:13:01,00:13:03,"No, sorry, as in for fun."
00:13:03,00:13:04,"Oh, for fun."
00:13:04,00:13:05,Because you would have thought that would be unbelievable.
00:13:05,00:13:06,It would be good fun.
00:13:06,00:13:08,"It feels like Avalanche chasers are going to be a thing, right?"
00:13:08,00:13:10,Like tornado hunters.
00:13:10,00:13:12,"Yeah, like surfing on the top of an avalanche."
00:13:12,00:13:13,And your big bubble.
00:13:13,00:13:14,How great would that be?
00:13:14,00:13:16,I'm going to say don't try it at home anyway.
00:13:16,00:13:17,It can't.
00:13:17,00:13:18,It can't.
00:13:18,00:13:23,Do you know the most famous frostbites offer of all time?
00:13:23,00:13:24,Rental finds.
00:13:24,00:13:25,Yeah.
00:13:25,00:13:26,More famous.
00:13:26,00:13:27,Even more famous than Rental finds.
00:13:27,00:13:28,"Oh, I'm blessed."
00:13:28,00:13:29,You think more famous.
00:13:29,00:13:30,More famous.
00:13:30,00:13:31,David Asimbra.
00:13:31,00:13:32,More famous.
00:13:32,00:13:33,"God, Albert Einstein."
00:13:33,00:13:34,Joey Essex.
00:13:34,00:13:35,God.
00:13:35,00:13:38,There was a study in 2004 by a couple of neonatologists
00:13:38,00:13:39,who decreed that the baby--
00:13:39,00:13:40,"Sorry, Joey Essex."
00:13:40,00:13:41,"It's okay, but don't be honest."
00:13:41,00:13:44,Just to kind of think of the most famous person I could think of.
00:13:44,00:13:47,There's a study found that the baby Jesus almost certainly
00:13:47,00:13:48,had hypothermia as a baby.
00:13:48,00:13:50,"Oh, and then by extension."
00:13:50,00:13:51,No.
00:13:51,00:13:52,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:13:52,00:13:53,"Not God, God."
00:13:53,00:13:54,"Well, now he is one of the three gods."
00:13:54,00:13:55,Exactly.
00:13:55,00:13:56,He has another mix of God.
00:13:56,00:13:57,"Well, that depends which one you find."
00:13:57,00:13:58,"Basically, they look to the load of--"
00:13:58,00:14:00,They look to the load of old masters paintings
00:14:00,00:14:01,"from the National Gallery,"
00:14:01,00:14:02,which loads of them a feature of--
00:14:02,00:14:04,"Oh, and of course they were painted lives."
00:14:04,00:14:05,"Well, that was exactly it."
00:14:05,00:14:06,That was it.
00:14:06,00:14:11,There was an ox and an ass and three shepherds
00:14:11,00:14:13,"and a load of fucking painters in the car, wasn't that?"
00:14:13,00:14:14,Yeah.
00:14:14,00:14:15,But you never see that.
00:14:15,00:14:17,"It's like a press gallery, you know?"
00:14:17,00:14:20,"So, yeah, 90% of these paintings depicted Jesus"
00:14:20,00:14:21,as either naked or scantily clad.
00:14:21,00:14:23,And given that the temperature in Bethlehem
00:14:23,00:14:24,in late December is about seven Celsius.
00:14:24,00:14:27,"And 60% of the paintings, he's on the floor."
00:14:27,00:14:28,"You think, why have you put the baby on the--"
00:14:28,00:14:29,Don't put the baby on the floor.
00:14:29,00:14:31,"He wasn't barbed on Christmas Day, though."
00:14:31,00:14:33,"I know that according to the rules he was,"
00:14:33,00:14:35,but I think we don't think he was.
00:14:35,00:14:36,"No, okay."
00:14:36,00:14:38,"But either way, it's clearly a risk."
00:14:38,00:14:39,And they said that the--
00:14:39,00:14:41,Can you guess the explanation they provided?
00:14:41,00:14:42,I really like this.
00:14:42,00:14:44,"As to why it might have been all right, because he was God."
00:14:44,00:14:45,"Well, he survived it."
00:14:45,00:14:48,Maybe the halo warmed him up.
00:14:48,00:14:51,They said maybe the halo suggested a neutral thermal zone.
00:14:51,00:14:52,Yes.
00:14:52,00:14:53,Very--
00:14:53,00:14:54,Like Readybreak.
00:14:54,00:14:56,Makes you blow in the dark.
00:14:56,00:14:57,"Yeah, exactly, yeah."
00:14:57,00:14:58,I'm sorry.
00:14:58,00:15:00,"Oh, you're too young to remember those adverts"
00:15:00,00:15:01,from the 1980s.
00:15:01,00:15:04,"Like a kid with the Readybreak, and then they would go to school"
00:15:04,00:15:06,and they would just have a glow around them all day.
00:15:06,00:15:07,Right.
00:15:07,00:15:08,It was a dangerous--
00:15:08,00:15:09,"It sort of looks a bit nuclear, doesn't it?"
00:15:09,00:15:10,"Does now you think about it, yeah."
00:15:10,00:15:11,And it was the '80s.
00:15:11,00:15:12,It was a time of anxiety.
00:15:12,00:15:13,Yeah.
00:15:13,00:15:14,It surprised it worked.
00:15:14,00:15:16,That's why Porridge is now so much more popular than Readybreak.
00:15:16,00:15:17,Here we go.
00:15:17,00:15:18,"You're out, and it's cold."
00:15:18,00:15:19,And it's really cold.
00:15:19,00:15:20,Yeah.
00:15:20,00:15:21,You're in big trouble.
00:15:21,00:15:22,"You're riding your horse along, yeah."
00:15:22,00:15:23,"Oh, okay."
00:15:23,00:15:24,I was under night out in Leeds in my head.
00:15:24,00:15:25,"No, I'm--"
00:15:25,00:15:27,"Well, you can still be on a night out in Leeds."
00:15:27,00:15:28,That's fine.
00:15:28,00:15:30,"Yeah, six."
00:15:30,00:15:31,Five beers for everyone.
00:15:31,00:15:34,I just remember that's the coldest I've ever been after a night out in Leeds.
00:15:34,00:15:35,So that's where I am.
00:15:35,00:15:36,Okay.
00:15:36,00:15:37,Go on.
00:15:37,00:15:38,But you're on your horse.
00:15:38,00:15:39,I'm on my horse.
00:15:39,00:15:40,"You're on your way home, back to the Previewer Inn."
00:15:40,00:15:41,"Previewer Inn, yeah."
00:15:41,00:15:43,There's no room at the Previewer Inn.
00:15:43,00:15:49,"Outside there's a baby who's been put on the floor, which is a very bad idea."
00:15:49,00:15:50,Okay.
00:15:50,00:15:51,"Your horse dies, under you."
00:15:51,00:15:52,"Oh, your horse dies."
00:15:52,00:15:53,On your way back to the Previewer Inn.
00:15:53,00:15:55,Probably punched by a Leeds United son.
00:15:55,00:15:58,I have my head.
00:15:58,00:16:00,It's really cold.
00:16:00,00:16:01,It's a long way to go to the Previewer Inn.
00:16:01,00:16:02,Yeah.
00:16:02,00:16:03,What do you do?
00:16:03,00:16:04,"Well, I would have walked."
00:16:04,00:16:06,"Oh, you do the Leonardo Comprier thing."
00:16:06,00:16:08,You can't open your horse and sleep inside.
00:16:08,00:16:09,Exactly.
00:16:09,00:16:10,"Oh, I see."
00:16:10,00:16:11,"Wait, is that a claxon?"
00:16:11,00:16:12,It's not really.
00:16:12,00:16:15,"It hasn't been done once, at least, that we know of."
00:16:15,00:16:19,"By a missionary in America who, in 1860, he did lose a leg."
00:16:19,00:16:20,He had to have leg amputated.
00:16:20,00:16:21,Okay.
00:16:21,00:16:22,But he did survive.
00:16:22,00:16:26,"I was reading a, do you remember the bit in Star Wars, where Luke Skywalker has to cut open the monster?"
00:16:26,00:16:27,Yes.
00:16:27,00:16:29,"He has to cut open his big fluffy, no, his sort of pack animal."
00:16:29,00:16:30,That's right.
00:16:30,00:16:31,And then he gets shoved in it.
00:16:31,00:16:32,Okay.
00:16:32,00:16:35,But I remember saying it wouldn't work.
00:16:35,00:16:37,"You would really don't have long, even if you cut open your horse and get it."
00:16:37,00:16:38,"Hang on, are you saying it would work out?"
00:16:38,00:16:40,So it's how one person's done it and achieved it.
00:16:40,00:16:41,Yeah.
00:16:41,00:16:42,"But like, oh, you can do it overnight."
00:16:42,00:16:44,It must depend how cold it is.
00:16:44,00:16:48,"Because if it's like, let's say it's 10 degrees, it's a bit nippy."
00:16:48,00:16:53,Probably you cut open your horse and it will just give you enough warmth to keep you fine.
00:16:53,00:16:55,"The headline then becomes, is this necessary?"
00:16:55,00:17:02,There is a taboo against pointing at rainbows from around the world.
00:17:02,00:17:04,Lots of different cultures have this.
00:17:04,00:17:08,"The Miso of Myanmar, they think that if you point at a rainbow,"
00:17:08,00:17:13,you have to immediately point at a hen's basket to stop having some bad luck.
00:17:13,00:17:19,"In the Malayang region of Papua New Guinea, if a child accidentally points at a rainbow,"
00:17:19,00:17:25,they must go and find an old man and pull his finger.
00:17:25,00:17:34,"Accidentally, if you accidentally point at a rainbow,"
00:17:34,00:17:37,it just feels so unlikely that you...
00:17:37,00:17:38,It does.
00:17:38,00:17:41,"And there's a group in Ecuador that if you point at a rainbow,"
00:17:41,00:17:43,your shoulder will ache.
00:17:43,00:17:49,"And in the advocacy group where if you're twins and one of you points at a rainbow,"
00:17:49,00:17:52,then you must apply crushed mushrooms to your face.
00:17:52,00:17:54,"Oh, you would like that."
00:17:54,00:17:56,"No, and the idea is basically rainbows..."
00:17:56,00:17:59,"Like, it was there, like, happy unicorns, rainbows and stuff,"
00:17:59,00:18:02,but to a lot of people there are the worldly weird things.
00:18:02,00:18:04,"And pointing is always bad, really."
00:18:04,00:18:06,You shouldn't point at people or things.
00:18:06,00:18:07,Right.
00:18:07,00:18:11,"If you do point at a rainbow for long enough, you will get a sore shoulder."
00:18:11,00:18:12,That's true.
00:18:12,00:18:15,"They're quite a femoral thing, though."
00:18:15,00:18:16,I think that you're right.
00:18:16,00:18:18,They almost never last long enough that you get a sore shoulder by pointing.
00:18:18,00:18:25,Does the culture that has pulling an old man's finger have the same thing that we have when you pull it?
00:18:25,00:18:27,I did luck.
00:18:27,00:18:34,"I mean, we should laugh at these things, but..."
00:18:34,00:18:37,"Because it's people and like, it's all, you know..."
00:18:37,00:18:39,"It's actually, it's incredibly serious."
00:18:39,00:18:43,But it is that is objectively funny.
00:18:43,00:18:44,It is.
00:18:44,00:18:48,"You know, one person who can withstand these extraordinary cold temperatures,"
00:18:48,00:18:50,"and he's become quite famous, Wim Hof."
00:18:50,00:18:52,I don't know if anyone's read that book.
00:18:52,00:18:53,"Yeah, the method."
00:18:53,00:18:54,"The method, Wim Hof method."
00:18:54,00:18:58,"So he climbed to an altitude of 7,200 meters on Mount Everest,"
00:18:58,00:19:00,wearing nothing but shorts and shoes.
00:19:00,00:19:02,"At one point, he had to change to some boots,"
00:19:02,00:19:04,but that was it that he put on.
00:19:04,00:19:08,"He also completed a marathon above the Arctic Circle in Finland,"
00:19:08,00:19:12,"close to -20, dressed in nothing but shorts as well."
00:19:12,00:19:13,Is it pretty...
00:19:13,00:19:14,Just what tops off?
00:19:14,00:19:15,"Yeah, yeah."
00:19:15,00:19:19,"And he's sort of is able to withstand these things, hence this people doing it."
00:19:19,00:19:22,"It's been just had a lot of controversy about it in recent times,"
00:19:22,00:19:25,because a lot of people have either died or become ill off the back of it.
00:19:25,00:19:26,But he can do it.
00:19:26,00:19:28,He demonstrably can do it.
00:19:28,00:19:34,"But according to his biographer, something he didn't get right, was he was swimming in a fountain in Amsterdam."
00:19:34,00:19:40,"And he decided on a Wim, oh, on a Wim, to give himself a brilliant,"
00:19:40,00:19:44,to give himself an enema on the nozzle of the jet in the fountain.
00:19:44,00:19:45,What?
00:19:45,00:19:49,"Something I believe that he might have done before, but what he didn't know was that earlier that day,"
00:19:49,00:19:51,they turned the power up on the spout itself.
00:19:51,00:19:56,"And as he sat on the nozzle, it cut through his colon and his testines."
00:19:56,00:19:59,"They say like a water knife, it kind of just went into him."
00:19:59,00:20:03,"Yeah, and he had to be rushed to hospital by his son, Michael."
00:20:03,00:20:05,Why was his sub there?
00:20:05,00:20:07,"Oh, they're hanging out."
00:20:07,00:20:09,He goes on going to a quick swim and that's in the fountain.
00:20:09,00:20:13,"I just can say, I think that there would be a clue that they'd upped the pressure"
00:20:13,00:20:16,by the fact that the water's going miles in the air.
00:20:16,00:20:18,But it sounds to me like they upped the pressure.
00:20:18,00:20:22,The moment it came up was as his bum was never ready.
00:20:22,00:20:24,Was it the vertical nozzle?
00:20:24,00:20:25,Yes.
00:20:25,00:20:31,"Was he, was he blasted into the air and sat in a cartoon style at the top of the fountain for a while?"
00:20:31,00:20:37,I'm imagine him and all his mates going to Las Vegas and sitting at the belagio as all the fountain's go up.
00:20:37,00:20:41,What you can't see in that favor seen at the end of Ocean's 11 where they're all watching the belagio fountain
00:20:41,00:20:44,just whimper half at the top of them.
00:20:44,00:20:48,"But apparently when he got there, he's so hard this guy."
00:20:48,00:20:53,"You know, he could go up Mount Everest in no top and no shoes or in shorts."
00:20:53,00:20:59,"They didn't know how serious the injury was because he was like, ""Ah, tis butter, internal scratch."""
00:20:59,00:21:03,He now has a semi-colon.
00:21:03,00:21:08,So it took ages until he fainted with pain and then after they did all the stuff on him
00:21:08,00:21:12,he didn't have any antibiotics during recovery because he's such a hard man.
00:21:12,00:21:13,"Oh, yeah."
00:21:13,00:21:17,It's not hard to disregard antibiotic term theory is real.
00:21:17,00:21:18,Sorry.
00:21:18,00:21:19,I've gone right off him now.
00:21:19,00:21:21,I was actually with him even in the fountain store.
00:21:21,00:21:23,"Okay, he's a crazy guy."
00:21:23,00:21:26,He's trying to suppress antibiotic resistance. That's a good thing you probably didn't need antibiotics.
00:21:26,00:21:29,People should never take them unless they absolutely need them.
00:21:29,00:21:34,I reckon them half takes like just four of them and then doesn't take the last three of them.
00:21:34,00:21:37,He sounds like that kind of guy.
00:21:37,00:21:39,Does he still alive?
00:21:39,00:21:40,He is.
00:21:40,00:21:41,"Yeah, still going on."
00:21:41,00:21:43,"In that case, I don't think he does that."
00:21:43,00:21:46,It wasn't everywhere they thought water was good for you.
00:21:46,00:21:49,"So in America, I was reading the 18th century,"
00:21:49,00:21:53,"people thought cold water, if you drank cold water, you would die."
00:21:53,00:21:58,"And there was a French guy visiting for the Delphier,"
00:21:58,00:22:03,who said that several people die each year drinking the cold pump water.
00:22:03,00:22:05,And so everyone started to leave it out to warm.
00:22:05,00:22:08,And there are printed hand bills distributed everywhere
00:22:08,00:22:10,and posters put up next to all water pumps.
00:22:10,00:22:14,"Saying, ""Do not drink this straight away. Do not drink this cold."
00:22:14,00:22:16,"You must leave this to warm up."""
00:22:16,00:22:18,"But he said, ""All these teachings are ignored."""
00:22:18,00:22:21,"And so, of course, there is death all over the place."
00:22:21,00:22:26,"Again, just not having the experiment time to work it out properly."
00:22:26,00:22:29,"You just think like, ""Surely one or two people drank it and didn't die."""
00:22:29,00:22:30,You think?
00:22:30,00:22:32,"And people thought, ""What happened there?"""
00:22:32,00:22:33,No one believed them.
00:22:33,00:22:34,"No, I believe them."
00:22:34,00:22:37,"But maybe you got like, you got a random bit of warm water in there."
00:22:37,00:22:40,Because I've got a tap at home which is so cold that I want to die when I drink from it.
00:22:40,00:22:41,It's really bad.
00:22:41,00:22:42,Okay.
00:22:42,00:22:43,Yeah.
00:22:43,00:22:44,"Yeah, okay."
00:22:44,00:22:45,That's good.
00:22:45,00:22:47,Thank you.
00:22:47,00:22:48,Thank you.
00:22:48,00:22:49,Yes.
00:22:49,00:22:53,Somewhere there's a fan listening to our show who's piecing all these very micro bits of detail.
00:22:53,00:22:57,They've got like a big board tap produces cold water.
00:22:57,00:22:58,Let's sit there next.
00:22:58,00:23:00,That's the tap said home.
00:23:00,00:23:01,Yeah.
00:23:01,00:23:02,For what?
00:23:02,00:23:05,The most boring a bit tree ever written.
00:23:05,00:23:08,Just slowly piecing together who mysterious Murray is.
00:23:08,00:23:09,That's podcasting.
00:23:09,00:23:10,"It's nice to get to know people, isn't it?"
00:23:10,00:23:11,As you listen to them.
00:23:11,00:23:12,"Oh, yeah."
00:23:12,00:23:13,"There are really no two things about, you know."
00:23:13,00:23:15,You've got very cold taps and you piss on the shower.
00:23:15,00:23:16,That's it.
00:23:16,00:23:22,"Did you know that the inventor of the Brooklyn Bridge, I'm going to say inventor, I mean engineer."
00:23:22,00:23:25,Yeah. Like to wrap himself in a damp cold sheet.
00:23:25,00:23:28,I guess his name was John Roblin.
00:23:28,00:23:30,Why did you do the sheet thing?
00:23:30,00:23:31,No further data.
00:23:31,00:23:32,Cool. Cool.
00:23:32,00:23:33,Cool itself down.
00:23:33,00:23:34,Probably.
00:23:34,00:23:38,Like people just did used to thing way for your too hot or too cold and that was a massive problem.
00:23:38,00:23:39,And I guess it is.
00:23:39,00:23:43,If you've got hyperthermia or a massive fever it is.
00:23:43,00:23:48,"But people thought like, you know, if you were sick you could bake yourself colder or hotter and that would cure you."
00:23:48,00:23:49,Yeah.
00:23:49,00:23:50,Yeah.
00:23:50,00:23:51,They didn't have cow pull.
00:23:51,00:23:52,Yeah.
00:23:52,00:23:57,I was looking at another thing that was happening around the same time in London.
00:23:57,00:24:05,"And this was a man called Banks, who had a horse called Morocco and it had shoes of silver."
00:24:05,00:24:10,"And it could dance to music, count and answer questions and do all sorts of tricks."
00:24:10,00:24:14,And it once apparently climbed up St. Paul's Cathedral.
00:24:14,00:24:16,"It was really, really popular."
00:24:16,00:24:20,"Everyone in London loved this horse and everyone, whenever it was on display would go and see it."
00:24:20,00:24:26,And then it went to Italy and he and the horse and the master were both burned on charges of sorcery.
00:24:26,00:24:27,Oh.
00:24:27,00:24:30,That's a bad tool.
00:24:30,00:24:33,"It's a risky rum with magic tricks in those days, isn't it?"
00:24:33,00:24:34,Yeah.
00:24:34,00:24:37,Either you entertain people or you're a witch or a witch or a witch.
00:24:37,00:24:41,And there are dogs and darren browns both to death in New Zealand.
00:24:41,00:24:48,One more thing about Formula One is if you play the sound of a Formula One race to a Formula One driver
00:24:48,00:24:53,"and they're blindfolded, they can tell where the track is."
00:24:53,00:24:54,What is it?
00:24:54,00:24:55,What corners are?
00:24:55,00:24:56,They can draw you a track.
00:24:56,00:24:58,"Well, they know because they know the track so well."
00:24:58,00:25:06,"So if they like, if it goes, and then it goes a bit quieter for a bit and then it goes louder and then quieter and louder and then quieter, they'll go that's monster."
00:25:06,00:25:08,"And that's without the commentary, right?"
00:25:08,00:25:09,Okay.
00:25:09,00:25:10,That's nice.
00:25:10,00:25:18,"I love that there's a great thing you can watch online where Broadway dancers will have to stand in front of the stage and behind them,"
00:25:18,00:25:24,someone is doing one of the dance routines and they have to join the dance routine only by the sound of the steps.
00:25:24,00:25:25,It's incredible.
00:25:25,00:25:30,And they get it right so much they're hearing the patterns and then they leap into it and they match it.
00:25:30,00:25:33,"Do you reckon, Dan, you could watch the three of us doing a podcast?"
00:25:33,00:25:36,You'll just see in our mouths moving but you can't hear what we're saying.
00:25:36,00:25:41,Do you reckon you could sort of join in and jump in at the right time and say the most sensible things?
00:25:41,00:25:44,"Yeah, yeah, I'd be like, ""James is right, golf is interesting."""
00:25:44,00:25:45,"Actually, yeah."
00:25:45,00:25:47,Dan never jumps in anyway saying the most sensible things.
00:25:47,00:25:49,It's sort of a rather than running an aerosol.
00:25:49,00:25:52,This is how I run my whole game on this day.
00:25:52,00:25:55,I'm not convinced he's heard anything moves down to the last 10 years.
00:25:55,00:25:58,Do you know the saltiest big body of water in the world?
00:25:58,00:25:59,Dead sea.
00:25:59,00:26:00,Dead sea.
00:26:00,00:26:01,"It's not, in fact."
00:26:01,00:26:02,It's just really cool things.
00:26:02,00:26:06,"There are a couple of Antarctica that are the saltiest in the world, but you can't swim in them or anything."
00:26:06,00:26:08,"Obviously, because they're an Antarctica."
00:26:08,00:26:15,"But there is a place called Lake Retba in Senegal, which is 40% saltiness compared to Dead Sea is 34%."
00:26:15,00:26:18,"You know how you sink in the Dead Sea, aren't you?"
00:26:18,00:26:19,We've said this before.
00:26:19,00:26:20,We have.
00:26:20,00:26:23,The only passenger you reckon you might float in this 40%.
00:26:23,00:26:24,But my tickets.
00:26:24,00:26:25,I'm going to Senegal next week.
00:26:25,00:26:26,You have to find someone else.
00:26:26,00:26:27,I must find out.
00:26:27,00:26:31,"When you say 40% saltiness, is it 40% salt?"
00:26:31,00:26:33,"Yeah, 40% concentration."
00:26:33,00:26:34,Wow.
00:26:34,00:26:35,And it's also pink.
00:26:35,00:26:36,"Cool, right?"
00:26:36,00:26:37,Double whammy.
00:26:37,00:26:40,And you can't swim in it and people go and bathe in it.
00:26:40,00:26:41,Cool.
00:26:41,00:26:43,And it's got a special algae that makes it sort of orangey.
00:26:43,00:26:46,It's one of those ones that says it's pink and all the photos look bright pink.
00:26:46,00:26:51,And then you read the one blogger who says I went there and everyone's enhanced their photos enormously.
00:26:51,00:26:53,"But still, you can float in it, you know?"
00:26:53,00:26:54,You can walk around in it.
00:26:54,00:26:55,Very cool.
00:26:55,00:26:56,That's nice.
00:26:56,00:26:59,"I've been to one in, um, what was it?"
00:26:59,00:27:05,Maybe it was in America where like animals go in there and then they turn to salt.
00:27:05,00:27:07,"You know, where they petrify."
00:27:07,00:27:08,Yeah.
00:27:08,00:27:11,"But actually, like it turns out it's a bit of a myth."
00:27:11,00:27:13,Like they die through natural causes.
00:27:13,00:27:16,And then slowly the salt sort of grows on their body.
00:27:16,00:27:21,"But people say, oh, this, you know, pelican drank a little bit of water and they turn to salt."
00:27:21,00:27:22,That doesn't happen.
00:27:22,00:27:24,But still believe this stuff in America.
00:27:24,00:27:25,It's what we've said.
00:27:25,00:27:27,I'm not sure anyone really believes it.
00:27:27,00:27:30,"But yeah, they believe a little mad stuff in America."
00:27:30,00:27:33,"And in Britain, I mean, that wouldn't be the craziest thing, would it?"
00:27:33,00:27:34,No.
00:27:34,00:27:35,They believe today.
00:27:35,00:27:39,"In fact, when I went there, there was like an overlooking road."
00:27:39,00:27:42,And you could put like your business cards there for some reason.
00:27:42,00:27:44,People were doing it and I had some fish ones.
00:27:44,00:27:45,So I put them there.
00:27:45,00:27:47,So we have a made our mark.
00:27:47,00:27:48,Great.
00:27:48,00:27:50,"We haven't, I haven't heard from them yet."
00:27:50,00:27:52,They've wanted to saltify.
00:27:52,00:27:57,The wife of lots is there.
00:27:57,00:28:00,Do you know Henry VIII executed all the horses that were too short?
00:28:00,00:28:02,Is that like a eugenics thing?
00:28:02,00:28:03,"Basically, yeah."
00:28:03,00:28:06,He decided that the horse stock was getting a bit shit.
00:28:06,00:28:08,"That's early for eugenics as well, isn't it?"
00:28:08,00:28:09,He's a pioneer.
00:28:09,00:28:12,He is a pioneer in his day and I respect it.
00:28:12,00:28:17,"Not only a tick for the horrific reputation, Henry VIII."
00:28:17,00:28:18,This is it.
00:28:18,00:28:19,This is it.
00:28:19,00:28:20,Last part of entry act.
00:28:20,00:28:21,The breed of horses act 1535.
00:28:21,00:28:24,No stallion under 15 hands was allowed to exist anymore.
00:28:24,00:28:26,And no mayor under 13 hands.
00:28:26,00:28:27,Which is quite big.
00:28:27,00:28:28,So it's quite big.
00:28:28,00:28:29,Not just they die out.
00:28:29,00:28:32,Just that you have to actively offer your horse.
00:28:32,00:28:33,There were coals every year.
00:28:33,00:28:35,It's terrible when I run the part of land.
00:28:35,00:28:36,I would try and get around it.
00:28:36,00:28:39,"Yeah, you were put three horses in a trench coat."
00:28:39,00:28:40,Oh yeah.
00:28:40,00:28:45,"I would paint the horse with, is it vertical stripes or horizontal stripes?"
00:28:45,00:28:51,I would make the horse carry around a smaller horse with it.
00:28:51,00:28:54,Or put the load in and you have to kill off that horse.
00:28:54,00:28:56,I would hire someone with small hands.
00:28:56,00:28:58,So the horse cleared the bar.
00:28:58,00:28:59,Yes.
00:28:59,00:29:00,That worked.
00:29:00,00:29:02,Maybe that's why horseshoes were invented.
00:29:02,00:29:04,Was a little platform shoes for horses to save them.
00:29:04,00:29:06,"They used to look like the spice girls, didn't they?"
00:29:06,00:29:07,Yes.
00:29:07,00:29:10,"Mars was quite important in early Rome, wasn't he?"
00:29:10,00:29:12,And he was associated with woodpeckers.
00:29:12,00:29:17,Which meant that there was a law against eating woodpeckers in ancient Rome.
00:29:17,00:29:20,It doesn't feel like a law that would impact many people's lives too.
00:29:20,00:29:21,"Oh, they're so delicious."
00:29:21,00:29:23,Are they really healthy?
00:29:23,00:29:25,"For all we know, they're incredibly yummy."
00:29:25,00:29:26,Yeah.
00:29:26,00:29:27,I doubt it.
00:29:27,00:29:30,They've got those strong skulls to withstand all the pecking.
00:29:30,00:29:31,They scramble themselves.
00:29:31,00:29:32,They're very...
00:29:32,00:29:35,I think with peckertongs was a thing for a while.
00:29:35,00:29:36,People would eat woodpeckertongs.
00:29:36,00:29:37,"They're very long, don't they?"
00:29:37,00:29:40,They've got tongs so long that they wrap around their brains.
00:29:40,00:29:41,Yeah.
00:29:41,00:29:42,It was protecting the brain in part.
00:29:42,00:29:43,Sorry.
00:29:43,00:29:44,I think it is.
00:29:44,00:29:45,"Yeah, yeah."
00:29:45,00:29:47,I thought you meant woodpeckertongs like as a piece of cutlery
00:29:47,00:29:50,"with which you ate woodpeckers, specifically like you have, you know."
00:29:50,00:29:52,I would peg a fork.
00:29:52,00:29:54,"Oh, this is Jones' coming round."
00:29:54,00:29:55,And get the woodpeckertongs.
00:29:55,00:29:56,"Oh, no."
00:29:56,00:29:58,"Oh, what a faux pas."
00:29:58,00:30:01,I'm just annoying on annoying car noises.
00:30:01,00:30:06,"The car horn, quite annoying now, used to be so much worse."
00:30:06,00:30:10,"So the word ""claxen"" in fact comes from, was invented for cars."
00:30:10,00:30:11,Jeremy Claxon.
00:30:11,00:30:12,Yes.
00:30:12,00:30:13,Yes.
00:30:13,00:30:14,We invented it.
00:30:14,00:30:17,Why hasn't he changed his name?
00:30:17,00:30:18,You could.
00:30:18,00:30:22,"So this was sort of pre-war, pre-second-mold war."
00:30:22,00:30:24,Cars had horns that would like claxons.
00:30:24,00:30:25,So you know the claxon noise.
00:30:25,00:30:26,"It's like, ""Woooow!"""
00:30:26,00:30:27,"""Awoga!"""
00:30:27,00:30:28,"""Awoga!"""
00:30:28,00:30:29,Yeah.
00:30:29,00:30:30,"It was that, but you..."
00:30:30,00:30:33,What was I saying to you guys last week that my grandma always honked the horn when she turned...
00:30:33,00:30:34,"Oh, yeah, yeah."
00:30:34,00:30:35,It took corners.
00:30:35,00:30:36,"Well, that used to be the rule."
00:30:36,00:30:40,"You'd be fined if you didn't, because there was no other way of knowing when car engines weren't as big."
00:30:40,00:30:45,"And so there were constantly, whenever anyone turned a corner, when everyone was coming up to a junction,"
00:30:45,00:30:49,"whenever you were about to park, you beeped your ""Awoga!"""
00:30:49,00:30:50,And people hated it.
00:30:50,00:30:53,It's kind of like the legacy of the man with the red flag.
00:30:53,00:30:54,Yes.
00:30:54,00:30:55,A little bit.
00:30:55,00:30:56,"But less annoying, the man with the red flag."
00:30:56,00:30:57,I don't think I'd mind that as much.
00:30:57,00:30:58,No.
00:30:58,00:31:01,"It's just a bit like, beep, beep, vehicle reversing."
00:31:01,00:31:04,"So, do you know who the godfather of backing up is?"
00:31:04,00:31:06,Like the godfather of soul.
00:31:06,00:31:07,"Yeah, just like that."
00:31:07,00:31:11,Do you mean you mean the sound or literally backing up a car?
00:31:11,00:31:13,The sound that's made when you backup a car.
00:31:13,00:31:14,The beeping.
00:31:14,00:31:15,"So, when you're reversing."
00:31:15,00:31:17,"So, who's the godfather of creating that sound?"
00:31:17,00:31:18,I don't know what you're asking.
00:31:18,00:31:19,It's a man called Ed Peterson.
00:31:19,00:31:21,"Oh, it's just about saying him."
00:31:21,00:31:23,"So, he was the pioneer in the West."
00:31:23,00:31:28,And he may have been beaten to it by Matthew Saburo Yamaguchi in 1953.
00:31:28,00:31:33,"But, Peterson noticed, he was working at a dam, a construction project, a huge construction project."
00:31:33,00:31:38,"And he noticed, gosh, people keep being killed or injured when really heavy vehicles reverse into them."
00:31:38,00:31:42,"If only there was somewhere, and he said that the flag men were just not doing their jobs."
00:31:42,00:31:48,"And that was the system that weirdly, you know, like waving flags around, saying, look out, that system wasn't working."
00:31:48,00:31:52,I can't believe if you're holding a flag to wave and a person about to get run over.
00:31:52,00:31:56,"Why aren't you also going, there's a car running you over, there's a car on quick and get out of the way."
00:31:56,00:31:57,I don't know.
00:31:57,00:31:58,I don't know.
00:31:58,00:31:59,Maybe they're standing at a distance.
00:31:59,00:32:00,Probably a union thing.
00:32:00,00:32:01,"Yeah, a union thing."
00:32:01,00:32:04,If we won't pay the extra for that.
00:32:04,00:32:06,"Anyway, just wanted to give him his credit."
00:32:06,00:32:07,Ed Peterson.
00:32:07,00:32:08,All right.
00:32:08,00:32:11,Do you know who has the best car horns?
00:32:11,00:32:12,Ooh.
00:32:12,00:32:14,What country?
00:32:14,00:32:19,"Oh, is there a country where it's, you know, like a hundred pounds, like in juke's of hazard?"
00:32:19,00:32:21,"Ha, da, da, da, da, da, da, da."
00:32:21,00:32:25,"Ah, so now you're interpreting it differently to how I mean."
00:32:25,00:32:26,The best.
00:32:26,00:32:30,"So, by best, it's long-lasting, louder."
00:32:30,00:32:32,This is an india.
00:32:32,00:32:33,"Yeah, yeah."
00:32:33,00:32:34,It is an india.
00:32:34,00:32:40,And the reason is is that because the culture of driving there has a much more emphasis on the beeping when you're in.
00:32:40,00:32:41,And so they need cars.
00:32:41,00:32:49,"They actually make, like, Audi make stronger, better horns so that they don't run them down with the amount that they're using them."
00:32:49,00:32:50,Daz.
00:32:50,00:32:52,They do use it properly in India.
00:32:52,00:32:55,They use it to tell you I'm about to drive into India.
00:32:55,00:32:56,"You're a danger, yeah, yeah."
00:32:56,00:32:59,"Well, that supplies that incredibly bad drivers."
00:32:59,00:33:02,"They're always using it properly, but they're always using it."
00:33:02,00:33:04,I think it's just lots of cars.
00:33:04,00:33:05,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:33:05,00:33:08,And the weight of Cross the road is just to get cracking.
00:33:08,00:33:09,It's like British kettles.
00:33:09,00:33:11,"They just long, they're long-lasting."
00:33:11,00:33:13,"This is personal anecdote, but."
00:33:13,00:33:14,British kettles.
00:33:14,00:33:15,British kettles.
00:33:15,00:33:17,"Yeah, I was just confused by the analogy."
00:33:17,00:33:20,"Well, I'm just remembering because Dan's wife was bought like 20 kettles."
00:33:20,00:33:21,Yes.
00:33:21,00:33:23,She keeps buying European ones because they look nice.
00:33:23,00:33:27,They keep dying because they can't keep up with the British tea consuming out of the kilowatts.
00:33:27,00:33:32,"It's not like, dude, it's just kind of flooding that."
00:33:32,00:33:37,Did you come across the car that Cadillac invented which had a working toilet in it?
00:33:37,00:33:40,"Oh, sorry, not Cadillac invented."
00:33:40,00:33:43,One random bloke modified so that he could...
00:33:43,00:33:48,"This was a guy called Louis Mata and he wanted to drive 10,000 kilometers without stopping."
00:33:48,00:33:50,L.A. to New York and back.
00:33:50,00:33:51,Right.
00:33:51,00:33:52,So he must have put the toilet on the driving seat.
00:33:52,00:33:53,He put the toilet...
00:33:53,00:33:54,"Well, there were a couple of them in the car."
00:33:54,00:33:56,How long does it take to drive that distance?
00:33:56,00:33:58,Must be like 10 days.
00:33:58,00:33:59,Might have taken...
00:33:59,00:34:01,That would be a thousand kilometers a day.
00:34:01,00:34:02,Maybe a bit longer than that.
00:34:02,00:34:03,I think that's quite a bit.
00:34:03,00:34:04,Yeah.
00:34:04,00:34:08,Or they'll have to stop at some stage to sleep.
00:34:08,00:34:10,"Well, no, but there were a couple of them in the car."
00:34:10,00:34:11,So they would...
00:34:11,00:34:12,They would shift into the driving seat.
00:34:12,00:34:14,This was in 1952.
00:34:14,00:34:16,For God knows why he wanted to do this.
00:34:16,00:34:19,But he'd been in the Navy. He was an engineer.
00:34:19,00:34:21,And it had a toilet. It had a shower.
00:34:21,00:34:24,"It had a TV, a fridge, and a sink."
00:34:24,00:34:27,And they were escorted when they were in a town by the local police
00:34:27,00:34:28,who would help them through the traffic lights.
00:34:28,00:34:30,So they could literally keep moving.
00:34:30,00:34:32,"Just like a caravan, really."
00:34:32,00:34:33,Yeah.
00:34:33,00:34:35,"It's just like a caravan, except I love this."
00:34:35,00:34:37,What's another flaw in this plan?
00:34:37,00:34:40,We have to let out what you're carrying.
00:34:40,00:34:44,Nice. He's got a shed load of petrol that's filling out the car.
00:34:44,00:34:46,You can refuel on the go.
00:34:46,00:34:47,That's cool.
00:34:47,00:34:48,That's cool.
00:34:48,00:34:50,And what if the worst happens?
00:34:50,00:34:51,You burst a tire.
00:34:51,00:34:52,Yeah.
00:34:52,00:34:55,They had a system to change a tire while the car was driving.
00:34:55,00:34:56,Wow.
00:34:56,00:34:57,It's so cool.
00:34:57,00:35:00,As Jack would lift up one tire and this tiny little supermarket trolley wheel
00:35:00,00:35:02,would take that corner of the car.
00:35:02,00:35:05,And then his friends would lean over the side and change the tire.
00:35:05,00:35:07,And then change it back and then you just pop it back up.
00:35:07,00:35:11,You would be impossible to steer if it's got a supermarket trolley wheel.
00:35:11,00:35:17,The laziest on this bit of observation of comedy that's ever been made.
00:35:17,00:35:24,"Okay, that's it."
00:35:24,00:35:25,That is all of our outtakes.
