00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:04.800
 Hey Clubfish members, welcome to this week's bonus bit of content.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.960
 We have got a compilation episode for you today.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.700
 But before we get into it, I just want to quickly remind some of you who may have missed

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.960
 the news that we are going to do a live show, July 6th, at the Crossed Wires Festival,

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.760
 which is a festival that was co-created by our good friend, Alice Lavigne, of my dad

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:22.760
 wrote a porno.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:23.760
 They started last year.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:24.960
 It was a massive success.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.240
 They're coming back this year and we were really excited to be invited, so we're going

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.640
 to be doing a live recording.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.400
 Now, we didn't do Sheffield on our tour last year.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.580
 We really missed out on getting to that bit of the country, so if you're in that area,

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:37.580
 come along.

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.140
 We're doing a full live recording.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.640
 There'll be a few extra fun bits thrown in as well.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.920
 And if you want to get tickets, go to nosuchthingasaffish.com.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.240
 You'll find all the links there.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.180
 And why not check out what other podcasts are on.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.840
 It is genuinely a great pod festival.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:50.840
 All right.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.480
 Well, let's get to the compilation.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.740
 Here are the best of the outtakes that never made it to the main show.

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:56.740
 Here we go.

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:18.900
 She turned up to the unveiling of the Statue of Liberty, which I really like, and she turned

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.060
 that she was not invited.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.380
 But she turned up on a cattle barge, so she turned up on a barge with a megaphone, and

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.120
 shouting that it was a gigantic lie, a travesty, and a mockery to make the representation of

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.120
 Liberty a woman when actual women had so few rights at the time.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.120
 So that was her, that was her prototype.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.640
 No, she's shackled, though, isn't she?

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.160
 Oh, is she broken her shackles?

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.640
 I don't think she's shackled.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:40.640
 Is she not?

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:41.640
 I should not have been up it.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.640
 And I don't know.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:43.640
 You haven't been able to see her on the inside.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:44.640
 You can't see me out.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.140
 It's like Annie from there.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.680
 Oh, and I haven't been up it either.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.020
 Sorry, I was missing my name.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.020
 What just happened?

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.020
 I've been near it.

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.020
 Oh, yeah.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.020
 We all, but we went together.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.020
 We were near it.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.020
 We went to New York.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.020
 I've been closer than that.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.020
 Are we?

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.020
 Yeah, yeah.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.020
 But she's not, I don't think.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.020
 I don't think she's shackled.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.020
 I don't think she's shackled.

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.020
 I've got one of her legs had a shackle on it, but maybe I'm wrong.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.020
 Oh, she's got slippers.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.020
 I know that much.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.020
 Slipers.

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.020
 I think they're more sandals.

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.020
 Yeah, slip-ons.

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.020
 Like, the open toad.

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.020
 You could see her feet.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.020
 Yeah.

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.020
 She's a woman in comfortable shoes.

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.020
 That's why you stayed outside.

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.060
 You got one of those wicky feet things going on.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.980
 So true feminist should campaign for the Statue of Liberty to be a man?

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:21.980
 Yeah.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.980
 And yet, my campaign has got done nothing.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.980
 I have one more caddy called Daff to Willie Gunn.

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.980
 He is an old school one in Scotland.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.980
 He was from the 19th century, early 19th century.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.980
 He always wore four coats, three or four pairs of trousers.

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:40.980
 It is cold in Scotland.

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:41.980
 It is cold.

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.980
 He couldn't afford, like, a big coat or anything.

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.980
 So he just wore lots of small ones.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.980
 And he just fell sick on me.

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.980
 He would only eat milk and soft vegetables his whole life.

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:56.980
 Okay.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.980
 And he would be in St Andrews in Scotland.

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.980
 And then when the golf season finished, he would walk off.

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:03.980
 And no one knew where he went.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.980
 He just presumably walked home somewhere.

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.980
 And then when the season started, he walked back again.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:09.980
 And that was it.

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.980
 Well, he's really great.

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.980
 And then one day they stumbled upon a grave which said he died in 1520.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.980
 Well, one day in 1820, he walked north, never to return.

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:21.980
 Oh.

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.980
 And to this day, nobody knows what happened to him.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:24.980
 Stand out there.

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:25.980
 Well, that's great.

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:26.980
 That was great.

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:27.980
 Do you know that fact?

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:28.980
 Have I ever said it on this?

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:29.980
 I don't think I have.

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.980
 It was during the winter war, I think, between Russia and Finland.

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.980
 And there was a guy who was captured.

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.980
 And it turned out they was trying to hide in the snow by putting diaries on his head.

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.980
 And he reckoned that it worked for ages because they were white diaries.

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.980
 And no one could see him.

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.980
 But why had he taken so many diaries to a corporate zone?

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.980
 Did he just think I know this is going to work?

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.980
 I think he might have plundered them from houses.

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.980
 Really, of course, because you would get diaries in it.

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:58.980
 I mean, you don't get diaries anymore.

00:03:58.980 --> 00:03:59.980
 It's a really, really sad fact.

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.980
 I mean, you get sort of weak diaries on trains these days.

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.980
 But even then, only on nice trains, they're not very good.

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.980
 Let's make me think, if you're Jewish and you have a Yamakar,

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.980
 do you, if you were going certain places with the army,

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.980
 would you match it to your environment?

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:14.980
 You're going somewhere winter, where I'm white.

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:15.980
 Kamalka.

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.980
 But in all these scenarios, you have, and in this one you've described,

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.980
 do you have to bury yourself up to the eyebrows?

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:25.980
 I think it was more like his hair would show up against the snow,

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:27.980
 but you maybe had a white coat.

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:29.980
 Did you get caught when some Russians turn up?

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:30.980
 I thought, "Oh, a lovely comfy armchair."

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.980
 I'll just stand up after I'm here.

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:34.980
 Just put like nothing to you under that.

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:36.980
 Well, it was entirely doing here.

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:38.980
 You know what, I only have remembered the story, so.

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.980
 Wait, is a Dolly's view ahead, isn't it?

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.980
 Is it a coaster?

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:44.980
 Dolly is the thing you put on a table and you put,

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:46.980
 it's a bit bigger than a coaster, but you put your tea part on it.

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:47.980
 What am I thinking of?

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:49.980
 I think it's a lacy.

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:50.980
 An anti-macasser.

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:51.980
 An anti-macasser.

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:52.980
 I'm so sorry.

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.980
 An anti-macasser is the thing you don't get anymore.

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:56.980
 I've got doggies coming out of my ass.

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:58.980
 It's winter, the same material though.

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:00.980
 So you obviously was a material based confusion.

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:03.980
 Anyway, I don't think a Dolly would work as an anti-macasser,

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.980
 because it's got holes in it, so all the macastras would get on the chair.

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:07.980
 You're right.

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:08.980
 What's a macasser?

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:09.980
 A macasser.

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:10.980
 We have a lot of topic.

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:11.980
 Macasser is hair oil.

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:12.980
 Yeah.

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:13.980
 In the 19th century, you'd have lots of you.

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:14.980
 Slather yourself.

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:15.980
 Yeah.

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:18.980
 So that's why, we don't need to confine this in the 19th century.

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:20.980
 Sorry, you popped your tiger bar when you're here.

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:23.980
 Your anti-macasser is when you go on the train or at a chair.

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:24.980
 You sit in a comfy chair.

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:28.980
 You need a layer of cloth between your head and the fabric of the chair,

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.980
 so that the oil doesn't soak into the chair itself.

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:32.980
 So that's an anti-macasser.

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:33.980
 James is right.

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:34.980
 A Dolly is the kind of coaster.

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.980
 Is that what they put on airplanes when you say that this is an anti-macasser?

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:39.980
 Should we talk about El Frank Balm?

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:40.980
 Yeah, sure.

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:43.980
 I've only got anti-macasser material.

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:47.980
 Do you know how scientists, if they've got a healer monster,

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:50.980
 to test its health levels, how they test them?

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:51.980
 Okay.

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:52.980
 So I'm going to give you a clue.

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:53.980
 I'm going to give you a clue.

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:54.980
 I'm going to give you a clue.

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:55.980
 A treadmill is classic.

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:56.980
 No, no.

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:57.980
 Nice.

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:58.980
 That's good.

00:05:58.980 --> 00:05:59.980
 It's actually not to test how fit they are in a gym sense.

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:01.980
 It's more like how many reserves do they have?

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:02.980
 How long do they go to last?

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:05.980
 Take tails to conference, because that's where they get the first.

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:07.980
 It's related to Archimedes.

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:09.980
 They put it in a bath and how much water comes out.

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:10.980
 Exactly.

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:12.980
 They dunk their tail in a cup of water.

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:14.980
 And then you just measure how much it comes out.

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:15.980
 And then you know how fat the tail is.

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:16.980
 It was a bit of an easy clue.

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:17.980
 I'll have to apologize about that.

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:19.980
 But, you know, I didn't want it to go on forever.

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:20.980
 It was going to be a fun game.

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:22.980
 They are all venomous, right?

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:25.980
 And I think only two people are recorded to have ever died.

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:27.980
 One last year and one in 1930.

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:30.980
 But the reason they're not very dangerous

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:33.980
 is that they don't have a mechanism to inject their venom.

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:36.980
 What they've got is they've got teeth with grooves in.

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:40.980
 And they have to bite into you and then just champ chew up and down

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:42.980
 and up and down and up and down and flood their mouth with venom

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:44.980
 and chew the venom into you.

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:47.980
 So it's quite hard for them to have a victim.

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:49.980
 So the guttion is very inefficient.

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:51.980
 I read it takes like 15 minutes.

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:53.980
 Well, the guy who died last year, he'd been bitten for four minutes.

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:56.980
 There was a suggestion that you might have had an allergic reaction.

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:57.980
 Interesting.

00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:59.980
 Yeah, it can be quite scary, I think.

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:04.980
 There was a 1959 movie called The Giant Helomonster,

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:09.980
 which apparently features a Mexican bearded lizard instead of a Helomonster.

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:11.980
 Yeah, you wouldn't get away with that these days.

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:12.980
 No, exactly.

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:16.980
 You have to skin an actual Helomonster, don't you?

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:20.980
 But it was the first ever double feature film

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:23.980
 where you paid for one film and you got two.

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:24.980
 That's great.

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:28.980
 And it was the first ever film that was shot and produced in Dallas.

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:30.980
 Really?

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:35.980
 The fact that you got the double feature that you got was The Giant Helomonster

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:38.980
 and the other one was called The Killer Shrews.

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:39.980
 Oh, wow.

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:40.980
 Which one headlines?

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:42.980
 I mean, it's going to be a double headline now.

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:44.980
 It is a double headline.

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:47.980
 Yeah, I watched the trailer for The Helomonster movie.

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:48.980
 Oh, yeah.

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:49.980
 It's wild.

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:50.980
 It's wonderful.

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:51.980
 Actually, I lie.

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:55.980
 I watched it for the remake in 2012, simply called Helah,

00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:57.980
 with an exclamation mark.

00:07:57.980 --> 00:07:59.980
 Yeah, it's unbelievable these things get remade.

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:02.980
 It was at the time acknowledged as an unbelievably bad film.

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:03.980
 Who's remaking it?

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:05.980
 Someone, and it's as bad.

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:07.980
 Did they not remake The Killer Shrews?

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:08.980
 Oh, I didn't check that.

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:09.980
 I should have.

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:10.980
 It's in development help.

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:11.980
 Yeah, yeah.

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:13.980
 Just on strong materials.

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:14.980
 This is a stiffer material.

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:15.980
 It's all about the hardest.

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:16.980
 There's also the strongest.

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:19.980
 And that's like, how much can you hang off something, basically?

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:21.980
 Strongest natural material.

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:22.980
 Thought of ages made.

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:23.980
 Spindy.

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:24.980
 Spindy.

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:25.980
 Spindy.

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:26.980
 Spindy.

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:27.980
 Wow.

00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:28.980
 Wow.

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:29.980
 I can just imagine.

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:32.980
 I don't know, as the host of Pewdiversity Challenge.

00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:35.980
 Someone gets an answer like, oh, no, is it?

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:36.980
 It's so Milton.

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:37.980
 Yeah.

00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:39.980
 Well, I've always been so skeptical about this,

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:40.980
 and I know scientists have always claimed it,

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:42.980
 but I've just passed so many spiders' webs,

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:45.980
 and often I pull at them, and they break.

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:47.980
 I am unbelievably strong now.

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:48.980
 I am.

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:49.980
 You're like God's love.

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:50.980
 I'm not kidding, yes.

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:52.980
 Friends of the flies, amateur Jinsky.

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:54.980
 I never rate them.

00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:57.980
 I get it, it's pound for pound, they're very thin,

00:08:57.980 --> 00:08:58.980
 but it seems so unlikely.

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:00.980
 And anyway, they've been supplanted recently,

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:02.980
 and I believe this much more.

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:04.980
 They always say, answer really strong,

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:06.980
 but I just stand on them and look at this.

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:07.980
 Squish.

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:11.980
 It's like I don't understand proportionality.

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:15.980
 Anyway, it was recently found that the strongest material is limpit teeth.

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:18.980
 So you know, limpits, like the common limpit they see on beaches.

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:20.980
 Their teeth are actually on their tongue,

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:22.980
 like we were talking about a bit earlier with molasses.

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:26.980
 They've got this tongue, and they use it for the same purpose as parrot fish,

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:29.980
 which is just a scrape algae off the rocks.

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:33.980
 And apparently the comparison is a single string of spaghetti holding.

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:34.980
 The scientist said,

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:37.980
 "3,500 kilogram bags of sugar,

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:40.980
 which I didn't think was that good a comparison."

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:45.980
 So I'm deciding to say it's like a string of spaghetti holding a large walrus,

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:48.980
 or my car with five adults inside.

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:49.980
 If you know my car.

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:50.980
 Wow.

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:51.980
 I know your car.

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:52.980
 I know your car.

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:56.980
 It's not like the small, it's a normal, small-ish sized car, right?

00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:57.980
 It's a Skoda Fabia.

00:09:57.980 --> 00:09:58.980
 Yeah.

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:01.980
 I'm not sure if to say it.

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:04.980
 That's amazing, that's spaghetti.

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:06.980
 I think it doesn't matter because it's about the...

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:07.980
 Please.

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:08.980
 Which of it?

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:09.980
 It doesn't matter.

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:11.980
 You've been to Anna's Italian restaurant.

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:15.980
 It's a nightmare.

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:18.980
 It's really hard to turn it around your fork, isn't it?

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:22.980
 It's Al Dente.

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:24.980
 I tell you one last...

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:27.980
 This is an alternative, actually, to a Zampig.

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:28.980
 Yeah.

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:29.980
 Because, you know, others are available.

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:30.980
 But much better.

00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:31.980
 Vibes.

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:32.980
 Oh.

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:33.980
 Okay.

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:37.980
 Which is an acronym that stands for the Vibrating Ingestible Bioelectric Simulator.

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:42.980
 And it is a pill that you swallow that...

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:45.980
 Wiggles and tickles and jiggles inside you.

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:47.980
 And makes you think you're full.

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:50.980
 It's a battery, a motor, a little vibrating motor and a membrane.

00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:52.980
 And when you swallow it, the membrane dissolves.

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:54.980
 You know what it sounds like to me, Andy?

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:55.980
 A magic bean.

00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:58.980
 And I've got a lot to sell you.

00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:01.980
 Well, it's been tested in the last couple of years in 2023.

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:03.980
 It's been tested on pigs.

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:04.980
 It hasn't got to human trials yet.

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:06.980
 But they ate 40% less.

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:07.980
 And pigs love to eat.

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:08.980
 They're pigs everywhere.

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:09.980
 Love to eat.

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:12.980
 And it's been tested on young Yorks or pigs, apparently.

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:16.980
 And basically, means that your stomach has been jiggled around.

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:18.980
 And it thinks, oh, well, there must be loads of food in here.

00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:19.980
 Really?

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:20.980
 And then, yeah.

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:21.980
 Wow.

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:23.980
 But then what do I have to eat to get rid of that thing?

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:25.980
 You just eat another one and it pushes the first one through.

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:26.980
 That's fine.

00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:27.980
 Right.

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:28.980
 Okay, and then see a big one and a big one.

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:29.980
 Wow.

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:30.980
 What a weird poo.

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:33.980
 That will feel like, because it's vibrating out your butt.

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:35.980
 Here's an interesting thing.

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:38.980
 Avalanche is, and not nearly as deadly as they used to be.

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:42.980
 And more than half of people who are stuck in the Avalanche's survive these days.

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:43.980
 Wow.

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:47.980
 And they've got loads of new survival devices that you can have that,

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:51.980
 if you're skiing off piece, you might have them with you.

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:56.980
 One of them, which is really cool, is a thing called the Avalanche Airbag system.

00:11:56.980 --> 00:12:00.980
 And what you do is when you're skiing and you see an Avalanche coming, you go, oh, shit.

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:06.980
 And you pull a toggle and it just puts like an airbag around you, like you're in a...

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:07.980
 Zor.

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:08.980
 Like you're in a Zor.

00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:09.980
 But it makes you massive.

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:12.980
 It like puts this huge sort of airbag around you.

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:14.980
 And can you guess how it works?

00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:15.980
 This is really amazing.

00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:17.980
 Is it something to do with pressure up in the mountains?

00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:19.980
 Well, like how it's inviting.

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:23.980
 So you know when you get musely, for instance, you get a big box of musely.

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:26.980
 And at the top are all like the big nuts and stuff.

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:28.980
 But at the bottom are all the little grainy bits.

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:30.980
 Yeah, this is like, it's got a name, this effect.

00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:33.980
 Yeah, it's called like the Brazil nut effect or something like that.

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:35.980
 Well, this makes you really big.

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:38.980
 And so when the Avalanche is coming down, like a Brazil nut,

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:42.980
 you float to the top and all the small bits of snow goes to the bottom.

00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:43.980
 Wow.

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:44.980
 Isn't that amazing?

00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:46.980
 It's called the principle of inverse segregation.

00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:47.980
 Wow.

00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:49.980
 And so it keeps you near the top and it makes you easier to find.

00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:53.980
 And while you're waiting, you've got all that musely to get you out of the pie.

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:56.980
 Have many people done that on purpose?

00:12:56.980 --> 00:12:58.980
 Because I'd imagine it would be tempting.

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:01.980
 It's been used in Europe for over 10 years.

00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:03.980
 No, sorry, as in for fun.

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:04.980
 Oh, for fun.

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:05.980
 Because you would have thought that would be unbelievable.

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:06.980
 It would be good fun.

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:08.980
 It feels like Avalanche chasers are going to be a thing, right?

00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:10.980
 Like tornado hunters.

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:12.980
 Yeah, like surfing on the top of an avalanche.

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:13.980
 And your big bubble.

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:14.980
 How great would that be?

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:16.980
 I'm going to say don't try it at home anyway.

00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:17.980
 It can't.

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:18.980
 It can't.

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:23.980
 Do you know the most famous frostbites offer of all time?

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:24.980
 Rental finds.

00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:25.980
 Yeah.

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:26.980
 More famous.

00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:27.980
 Even more famous than Rental finds.

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:28.980
 Oh, I'm blessed.

00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:29.980
 You think more famous.

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:30.980
 More famous.

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:31.980
 David Asimbra.

00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:32.980
 More famous.

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:33.980
 God, Albert Einstein.

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:34.980
 Joey Essex.

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:35.980
 God.

00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:38.980
 There was a study in 2004 by a couple of neonatologists

00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:39.980
 who decreed that the baby--

00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:40.980
 Sorry, Joey Essex.

00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:41.980
 It's okay, but don't be honest.

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:44.980
 Just to kind of think of the most famous person I could think of.

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:47.980
 There's a study found that the baby Jesus almost certainly

00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:48.980
 had hypothermia as a baby.

00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:50.980
 Oh, and then by extension.

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:51.980
 No.

00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:52.980
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:53.980
 Not God, God.

00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:54.980
 Well, now he is one of the three gods.

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:55.980
 Exactly.

00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:56.980
 He has another mix of God.

00:13:56.980 --> 00:13:57.980
 Well, that depends which one you find.

00:13:57.980 --> 00:13:58.980
 Basically, they look to the load of--

00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:00.980
 They look to the load of old masters paintings

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:01.980
 from the National Gallery,

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:02.980
 which loads of them a feature of--

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:04.980
 Oh, and of course they were painted lives.

00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:05.980
 Well, that was exactly it.

00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:06.980
 That was it.

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:11.980
 There was an ox and an ass and three shepherds

00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:13.980
 and a load of fucking painters in the car, wasn't that?

00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:14.980
 Yeah.

00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:15.980
 But you never see that.

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:17.980
 It's like a press gallery, you know?

00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:20.980
 So, yeah, 90% of these paintings depicted Jesus

00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:21.980
 as either naked or scantily clad.

00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:23.980
 And given that the temperature in Bethlehem

00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:24.980
 in late December is about seven Celsius.

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:27.980
 And 60% of the paintings, he's on the floor.

00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:28.980
 You think, why have you put the baby on the--

00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:29.980
 Don't put the baby on the floor.

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:31.980
 He wasn't barbed on Christmas Day, though.

00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:33.980
 I know that according to the rules he was,

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:35.980
 but I think we don't think he was.

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:36.980
 No, okay.

00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:38.980
 But either way, it's clearly a risk.

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:39.980
 And they said that the--

00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:41.980
 Can you guess the explanation they provided?

00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:42.980
 I really like this.

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:44.980
 As to why it might have been all right, because he was God.

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:45.980
 Well, he survived it.

00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:48.980
 Maybe the halo warmed him up.

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:51.980
 They said maybe the halo suggested a neutral thermal zone.

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:52.980
 Yes.

00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:53.980
 Very--

00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:54.980
 Like Readybreak.

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:56.980
 Makes you blow in the dark.

00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:57.980
 Yeah, exactly, yeah.

00:14:57.980 --> 00:14:58.980
 I'm sorry.

00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:00.980
 Oh, you're too young to remember those adverts

00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:01.980
 from the 1980s.

00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:04.980
 Like a kid with the Readybreak, and then they would go to school

00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:06.980
 and they would just have a glow around them all day.

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:07.980
 Right.

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:08.980
 It was a dangerous--

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:09.980
 It sort of looks a bit nuclear, doesn't it?

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:10.980
 Does now you think about it, yeah.

00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:11.980
 And it was the '80s.

00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:12.980
 It was a time of anxiety.

00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:13.980
 Yeah.

00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:14.980
 It surprised it worked.

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:16.980
 That's why Porridge is now so much more popular than Readybreak.

00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:17.980
 Here we go.

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:18.980
 You're out, and it's cold.

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:19.980
 And it's really cold.

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:20.980
 Yeah.

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:21.980
 You're in big trouble.

00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:22.980
 You're riding your horse along, yeah.

00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:23.980
 Oh, okay.

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:24.980
 I was under night out in Leeds in my head.

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:25.980
 No, I'm--

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:27.980
 Well, you can still be on a night out in Leeds.

00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:28.980
 That's fine.

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:30.980
 Yeah, six.

00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:31.980
 Five beers for everyone.

00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:34.980
 I just remember that's the coldest I've ever been after a night out in Leeds.

00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:35.980
 So that's where I am.

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:36.980
 Okay.

00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:37.980
 Go on.

00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:38.980
 But you're on your horse.

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:39.980
 I'm on my horse.

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:40.980
 You're on your way home, back to the Previewer Inn.

00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:41.980
 Previewer Inn, yeah.

00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:43.980
 There's no room at the Previewer Inn.

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:49.980
 Outside there's a baby who's been put on the floor, which is a very bad idea.

00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:50.980
 Okay.

00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:51.980
 Your horse dies, under you.

00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:52.980
 Oh, your horse dies.

00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:53.980
 On your way back to the Previewer Inn.

00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:55.980
 Probably punched by a Leeds United son.

00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:58.980
 I have my head.

00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:00.980
 It's really cold.

00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:01.980
 It's a long way to go to the Previewer Inn.

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:02.980
 Yeah.

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:03.980
 What do you do?

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:04.980
 Well, I would have walked.

00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:06.980
 Oh, you do the Leonardo Comprier thing.

00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:08.980
 You can't open your horse and sleep inside.

00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:09.980
 Exactly.

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:10.980
 Oh, I see.

00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:11.980
 Wait, is that a claxon?

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:12.980
 It's not really.

00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:15.980
 It hasn't been done once, at least, that we know of.

00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:19.980
 By a missionary in America who, in 1860, he did lose a leg.

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:20.980
 He had to have leg amputated.

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:21.980
 Okay.

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:22.980
 But he did survive.

00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:26.980
 I was reading a, do you remember the bit in Star Wars, where Luke Skywalker has to cut open the monster?

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:27.980
 Yes.

00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:29.980
 He has to cut open his big fluffy, no, his sort of pack animal.

00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:30.980
 That's right.

00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:31.980
 And then he gets shoved in it.

00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:32.980
 Okay.

00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:35.980
 But I remember saying it wouldn't work.

00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:37.980
 You would really don't have long, even if you cut open your horse and get it.

00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:38.980
 Hang on, are you saying it would work out?

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:40.980
 So it's how one person's done it and achieved it.

00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:41.980
 Yeah.

00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:42.980
 But like, oh, you can do it overnight.

00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:44.980
 It must depend how cold it is.

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:48.980
 Because if it's like, let's say it's 10 degrees, it's a bit nippy.

00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:53.980
 Probably you cut open your horse and it will just give you enough warmth to keep you fine.

00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:55.980
 The headline then becomes, is this necessary?

00:16:55.980 --> 00:17:02.980
 There is a taboo against pointing at rainbows from around the world.

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:04.980
 Lots of different cultures have this.

00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:08.980
 The Miso of Myanmar, they think that if you point at a rainbow,

00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:13.980
 you have to immediately point at a hen's basket to stop having some bad luck.

00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:19.980
 In the Malayang region of Papua New Guinea, if a child accidentally points at a rainbow,

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:25.980
 they must go and find an old man and pull his finger.

00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:34.980
 Accidentally, if you accidentally point at a rainbow,

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:37.980
 it just feels so unlikely that you...

00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:38.980
 It does.

00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:41.980
 And there's a group in Ecuador that if you point at a rainbow,

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:43.980
 your shoulder will ache.

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:49.980
 And in the advocacy group where if you're twins and one of you points at a rainbow,

00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:52.980
 then you must apply crushed mushrooms to your face.

00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:54.980
 Oh, you would like that.

00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:56.980
 No, and the idea is basically rainbows...

00:17:56.980 --> 00:17:59.980
 Like, it was there, like, happy unicorns, rainbows and stuff,

00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:02.980
 but to a lot of people there are the worldly weird things.

00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:04.980
 And pointing is always bad, really.

00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:06.980
 You shouldn't point at people or things.

00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:07.980
 Right.

00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:11.980
 If you do point at a rainbow for long enough, you will get a sore shoulder.

00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:12.980
 That's true.

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:15.980
 They're quite a femoral thing, though.

00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:16.980
 I think that you're right.

00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:18.980
 They almost never last long enough that you get a sore shoulder by pointing.

00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:25.980
 Does the culture that has pulling an old man's finger have the same thing that we have when you pull it?

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:27.980
 I did luck.

00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:34.980
 I mean, we should laugh at these things, but...

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:37.980
 Because it's people and like, it's all, you know...

00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:39.980
 It's actually, it's incredibly serious.

00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:43.980
 But it is that is objectively funny.

00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:44.980
 It is.

00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:48.980
 You know, one person who can withstand these extraordinary cold temperatures,

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:50.980
 and he's become quite famous, Wim Hof.

00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:52.980
 I don't know if anyone's read that book.

00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:53.980
 Yeah, the method.

00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:54.980
 The method, Wim Hof method.

00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:58.980
 So he climbed to an altitude of 7,200 meters on Mount Everest,

00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:00.980
 wearing nothing but shorts and shoes.

00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:02.980
 At one point, he had to change to some boots,

00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:04.980
 but that was it that he put on.

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:08.980
 He also completed a marathon above the Arctic Circle in Finland,

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:12.980
 close to -20, dressed in nothing but shorts as well.

00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:13.980
 Is it pretty...

00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:14.980
 Just what tops off?

00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:15.980
 Yeah, yeah.

00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:19.980
 And he's sort of is able to withstand these things, hence this people doing it.

00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:22.980
 It's been just had a lot of controversy about it in recent times,

00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:25.980
 because a lot of people have either died or become ill off the back of it.

00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:26.980
 But he can do it.

00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:28.980
 He demonstrably can do it.

00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:34.980
 But according to his biographer, something he didn't get right, was he was swimming in a fountain in Amsterdam.

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:40.980
 And he decided on a Wim, oh, on a Wim, to give himself a brilliant,

00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:44.980
 to give himself an enema on the nozzle of the jet in the fountain.

00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:45.980
 What?

00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:49.980
 Something I believe that he might have done before, but what he didn't know was that earlier that day,

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:51.980
 they turned the power up on the spout itself.

00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:56.980
 And as he sat on the nozzle, it cut through his colon and his testines.

00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:59.980
 They say like a water knife, it kind of just went into him.

00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:03.980
 Yeah, and he had to be rushed to hospital by his son, Michael.

00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:05.980
 Why was his sub there?

00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:07.980
 Oh, they're hanging out.

00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:09.980
 He goes on going to a quick swim and that's in the fountain.

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:13.980
 I just can say, I think that there would be a clue that they'd upped the pressure

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:16.980
 by the fact that the water's going miles in the air.

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:18.980
 But it sounds to me like they upped the pressure.

00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:22.980
 The moment it came up was as his bum was never ready.

00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:24.980
 Was it the vertical nozzle?

00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:25.980
 Yes.

00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:31.980
 Was he, was he blasted into the air and sat in a cartoon style at the top of the fountain for a while?

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:37.980
 I'm imagine him and all his mates going to Las Vegas and sitting at the belagio as all the fountain's go up.

00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:41.980
 What you can't see in that favor seen at the end of Ocean's 11 where they're all watching the belagio fountain

00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:44.980
 just whimper half at the top of them.

00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:48.980
 But apparently when he got there, he's so hard this guy.

00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:53.980
 You know, he could go up Mount Everest in no top and no shoes or in shorts.

00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:59.980
 They didn't know how serious the injury was because he was like, "Ah, tis butter, internal scratch."

00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:03.980
 He now has a semi-colon.

00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:08.980
 So it took ages until he fainted with pain and then after they did all the stuff on him

00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:12.980
 he didn't have any antibiotics during recovery because he's such a hard man.

00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:13.980
 Oh, yeah.

00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:17.980
 It's not hard to disregard antibiotic term theory is real.

00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:18.980
 Sorry.

00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:19.980
 I've gone right off him now.

00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:21.980
 I was actually with him even in the fountain store.

00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:23.980
 Okay, he's a crazy guy.

00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:26.980
 He's trying to suppress antibiotic resistance. That's a good thing you probably didn't need antibiotics.

00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:29.980
 People should never take them unless they absolutely need them.

00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:34.980
 I reckon them half takes like just four of them and then doesn't take the last three of them.

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:37.980
 He sounds like that kind of guy.

00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:39.980
 Does he still alive?

00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:40.980
 He is.

00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:41.980
 Yeah, still going on.

00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:43.980
 In that case, I don't think he does that.

00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:46.980
 It wasn't everywhere they thought water was good for you.

00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:49.980
 So in America, I was reading the 18th century,

00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:53.980
 people thought cold water, if you drank cold water, you would die.

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:58.980
 And there was a French guy visiting for the Delphier,

00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:03.980
 who said that several people die each year drinking the cold pump water.

00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:05.980
 And so everyone started to leave it out to warm.

00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:08.980
 And there are printed hand bills distributed everywhere

00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:10.980
 and posters put up next to all water pumps.

00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:14.980
 Saying, "Do not drink this straight away. Do not drink this cold.

00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:16.980
 You must leave this to warm up."

00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:18.980
 But he said, "All these teachings are ignored."

00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:21.980
 And so, of course, there is death all over the place.

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:26.980
 Again, just not having the experiment time to work it out properly.

00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:29.980
 You just think like, "Surely one or two people drank it and didn't die."

00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:30.980
 You think?

00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:32.980
 And people thought, "What happened there?"

00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:33.980
 No one believed them.

00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:34.980
 No, I believe them.

00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:37.980
 But maybe you got like, you got a random bit of warm water in there.

00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:40.980
 Because I've got a tap at home which is so cold that I want to die when I drink from it.

00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:41.980
 It's really bad.

00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:42.980
 Okay.

00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:43.980
 Yeah.

00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:44.980
 Yeah, okay.

00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:45.980
 That's good.

00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:47.980
 Thank you.

00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:48.980
 Thank you.

00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:49.980
 Yes.

00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:53.980
 Somewhere there's a fan listening to our show who's piecing all these very micro bits of detail.

00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:57.980
 They've got like a big board tap produces cold water.

00:22:57.980 --> 00:22:58.980
 Let's sit there next.

00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:00.980
 That's the tap said home.

00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:01.980
 Yeah.

00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:02.980
 For what?

00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:05.980
 The most boring a bit tree ever written.

00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:08.980
 Just slowly piecing together who mysterious Murray is.

00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:09.980
 That's podcasting.

00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:10.980
 It's nice to get to know people, isn't it?

00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:11.980
 As you listen to them.

00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:12.980
 Oh, yeah.

00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:13.980
 There are really no two things about, you know.

00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:15.980
 You've got very cold taps and you piss on the shower.

00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:16.980
 That's it.

00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:22.980
 Did you know that the inventor of the Brooklyn Bridge, I'm going to say inventor, I mean engineer.

00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:25.980
 Yeah. Like to wrap himself in a damp cold sheet.

00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:28.980
 I guess his name was John Roblin.

00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:30.980
 Why did you do the sheet thing?

00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:31.980
 No further data.

00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:32.980
 Cool. Cool.

00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:33.980
 Cool itself down.

00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:34.980
 Probably.

00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:38.980
 Like people just did used to thing way for your too hot or too cold and that was a massive problem.

00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:39.980
 And I guess it is.

00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:43.980
 If you've got hyperthermia or a massive fever it is.

00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:48.980
 But people thought like, you know, if you were sick you could bake yourself colder or hotter and that would cure you.

00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:49.980
 Yeah.

00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:50.980
 Yeah.

00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:51.980
 They didn't have cow pull.

00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:52.980
 Yeah.

00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:57.980
 I was looking at another thing that was happening around the same time in London.

00:23:57.980 --> 00:24:05.980
 And this was a man called Banks, who had a horse called Morocco and it had shoes of silver.

00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:10.980
 And it could dance to music, count and answer questions and do all sorts of tricks.

00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:14.980
 And it once apparently climbed up St. Paul's Cathedral.

00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:16.980
 It was really, really popular.

00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:20.980
 Everyone in London loved this horse and everyone, whenever it was on display would go and see it.

00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:26.980
 And then it went to Italy and he and the horse and the master were both burned on charges of sorcery.

00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:27.980
 Oh.

00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:30.980
 That's a bad tool.

00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:33.980
 It's a risky rum with magic tricks in those days, isn't it?

00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:34.980
 Yeah.

00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:37.980
 Either you entertain people or you're a witch or a witch or a witch.

00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:41.980
 And there are dogs and darren browns both to death in New Zealand.

00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:48.980
 One more thing about Formula One is if you play the sound of a Formula One race to a Formula One driver

00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:53.980
 and they're blindfolded, they can tell where the track is.

00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:54.980
 What is it?

00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:55.980
 What corners are?

00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:56.980
 They can draw you a track.

00:24:56.980 --> 00:24:58.980
 Well, they know because they know the track so well.

00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:06.980
 So if they like, if it goes, and then it goes a bit quieter for a bit and then it goes louder and then quieter and louder and then quieter, they'll go that's monster.

00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:08.980
 And that's without the commentary, right?

00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:09.980
 Okay.

00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:10.980
 That's nice.

00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:18.980
 I love that there's a great thing you can watch online where Broadway dancers will have to stand in front of the stage and behind them,

00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:24.980
 someone is doing one of the dance routines and they have to join the dance routine only by the sound of the steps.

00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:25.980
 It's incredible.

00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:30.980
 And they get it right so much they're hearing the patterns and then they leap into it and they match it.

00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:33.980
 Do you reckon, Dan, you could watch the three of us doing a podcast?

00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:36.980
 You'll just see in our mouths moving but you can't hear what we're saying.

00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:41.980
 Do you reckon you could sort of join in and jump in at the right time and say the most sensible things?

00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:44.980
 Yeah, yeah, I'd be like, "James is right, golf is interesting."

00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:45.980
 Actually, yeah.

00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:47.980
 Dan never jumps in anyway saying the most sensible things.

00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:49.980
 It's sort of a rather than running an aerosol.

00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:52.980
 This is how I run my whole game on this day.

00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:55.980
 I'm not convinced he's heard anything moves down to the last 10 years.

00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:58.980
 Do you know the saltiest big body of water in the world?

00:25:58.980 --> 00:25:59.980
 Dead sea.

00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:00.980
 Dead sea.

00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:01.980
 It's not, in fact.

00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:02.980
 It's just really cool things.

00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:06.980
 There are a couple of Antarctica that are the saltiest in the world, but you can't swim in them or anything.

00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:08.980
 Obviously, because they're an Antarctica.

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:15.980
 But there is a place called Lake Retba in Senegal, which is 40% saltiness compared to Dead Sea is 34%.

00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:18.980
 You know how you sink in the Dead Sea, aren't you?

00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:19.980
 We've said this before.

00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:20.980
 We have.

00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:23.980
 The only passenger you reckon you might float in this 40%.

00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:24.980
 But my tickets.

00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:25.980
 I'm going to Senegal next week.

00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:26.980
 You have to find someone else.

00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:27.980
 I must find out.

00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:31.980
 When you say 40% saltiness, is it 40% salt?

00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:33.980
 Yeah, 40% concentration.

00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:34.980
 Wow.

00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:35.980
 And it's also pink.

00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:36.980
 Cool, right?

00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:37.980
 Double whammy.

00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:40.980
 And you can't swim in it and people go and bathe in it.

00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:41.980
 Cool.

00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:43.980
 And it's got a special algae that makes it sort of orangey.

00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:46.980
 It's one of those ones that says it's pink and all the photos look bright pink.

00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:51.980
 And then you read the one blogger who says I went there and everyone's enhanced their photos enormously.

00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:53.980
 But still, you can float in it, you know?

00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:54.980
 You can walk around in it.

00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:55.980
 Very cool.

00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:56.980
 That's nice.

00:26:56.980 --> 00:26:59.980
 I've been to one in, um, what was it?

00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:05.980
 Maybe it was in America where like animals go in there and then they turn to salt.

00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:07.980
 You know, where they petrify.

00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:08.980
 Yeah.

00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:11.980
 But actually, like it turns out it's a bit of a myth.

00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:13.980
 Like they die through natural causes.

00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:16.980
 And then slowly the salt sort of grows on their body.

00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:21.980
 But people say, oh, this, you know, pelican drank a little bit of water and they turn to salt.

00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:22.980
 That doesn't happen.

00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:24.980
 But still believe this stuff in America.

00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:25.980
 It's what we've said.

00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:27.980
 I'm not sure anyone really believes it.

00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:30.980
 But yeah, they believe a little mad stuff in America.

00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:33.980
 And in Britain, I mean, that wouldn't be the craziest thing, would it?

00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:34.980
 No.

00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:35.980
 They believe today.

00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:39.980
 In fact, when I went there, there was like an overlooking road.

00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:42.980
 And you could put like your business cards there for some reason.

00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:44.980
 People were doing it and I had some fish ones.

00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:45.980
 So I put them there.

00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:47.980
 So we have a made our mark.

00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:48.980
 Great.

00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:50.980
 We haven't, I haven't heard from them yet.

00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:52.980
 They've wanted to saltify.

00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:57.980
 The wife of lots is there.

00:27:57.980 --> 00:28:00.980
 Do you know Henry VIII executed all the horses that were too short?

00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:02.980
 Is that like a eugenics thing?

00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:03.980
 Basically, yeah.

00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:06.980
 He decided that the horse stock was getting a bit shit.

00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:08.980
 That's early for eugenics as well, isn't it?

00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:09.980
 He's a pioneer.

00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:12.980
 He is a pioneer in his day and I respect it.

00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:17.980
 Not only a tick for the horrific reputation, Henry VIII.

00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:18.980
 This is it.

00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:19.980
 This is it.

00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:20.980
 Last part of entry act.

00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:21.980
 The breed of horses act 1535.

00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:24.980
 No stallion under 15 hands was allowed to exist anymore.

00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:26.980
 And no mayor under 13 hands.

00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:27.980
 Which is quite big.

00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:28.980
 So it's quite big.

00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:29.980
 Not just they die out.

00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:32.980
 Just that you have to actively offer your horse.

00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:33.980
 There were coals every year.

00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:35.980
 It's terrible when I run the part of land.

00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:36.980
 I would try and get around it.

00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:39.980
 Yeah, you were put three horses in a trench coat.

00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:40.980
 Oh yeah.

00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:45.980
 I would paint the horse with, is it vertical stripes or horizontal stripes?

00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:51.980
 I would make the horse carry around a smaller horse with it.

00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:54.980
 Or put the load in and you have to kill off that horse.

00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:56.980
 I would hire someone with small hands.

00:28:56.980 --> 00:28:58.980
 So the horse cleared the bar.

00:28:58.980 --> 00:28:59.980
 Yes.

00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:00.980
 That worked.

00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:02.980
 Maybe that's why horseshoes were invented.

00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:04.980
 Was a little platform shoes for horses to save them.

00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:06.980
 They used to look like the spice girls, didn't they?

00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:07.980
 Yes.

00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:10.980
 Mars was quite important in early Rome, wasn't he?

00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:12.980
 And he was associated with woodpeckers.

00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:17.980
 Which meant that there was a law against eating woodpeckers in ancient Rome.

00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:20.980
 It doesn't feel like a law that would impact many people's lives too.

00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:21.980
 Oh, they're so delicious.

00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:23.980
 Are they really healthy?

00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:25.980
 For all we know, they're incredibly yummy.

00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:26.980
 Yeah.

00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:27.980
 I doubt it.

00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:30.980
 They've got those strong skulls to withstand all the pecking.

00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:31.980
 They scramble themselves.

00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:32.980
 They're very...

00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:35.980
 I think with peckertongs was a thing for a while.

00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:36.980
 People would eat woodpeckertongs.

00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:37.980
 They're very long, don't they?

00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:40.980
 They've got tongs so long that they wrap around their brains.

00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:41.980
 Yeah.

00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:42.980
 It was protecting the brain in part.

00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:43.980
 Sorry.

00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:44.980
 I think it is.

00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:45.980
 Yeah, yeah.

00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:47.980
 I thought you meant woodpeckertongs like as a piece of cutlery

00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:50.980
 with which you ate woodpeckers, specifically like you have, you know.

00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:52.980
 I would peg a fork.

00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:54.980
 Oh, this is Jones' coming round.

00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:55.980
 And get the woodpeckertongs.

00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:56.980
 Oh, no.

00:29:56.980 --> 00:29:58.980
 Oh, what a faux pas.

00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:01.980
 I'm just annoying on annoying car noises.

00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:06.980
 The car horn, quite annoying now, used to be so much worse.

00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:10.980
 So the word "claxen" in fact comes from, was invented for cars.

00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:11.980
 Jeremy Claxon.

00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:12.980
 Yes.

00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:13.980
 Yes.

00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:14.980
 We invented it.

00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:17.980
 Why hasn't he changed his name?

00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:18.980
 You could.

00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:22.980
 So this was sort of pre-war, pre-second-mold war.

00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:24.980
 Cars had horns that would like claxons.

00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:25.980
 So you know the claxon noise.

00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:26.980
 It's like, "Woooow!"

00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:27.980
 "Awoga!"

00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:28.980
 "Awoga!"

00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:29.980
 Yeah.

00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:30.980
 It was that, but you...

00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:33.980
 What was I saying to you guys last week that my grandma always honked the horn when she turned...

00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:34.980
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:35.980
 It took corners.

00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:36.980
 Well, that used to be the rule.

00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:40.980
 You'd be fined if you didn't, because there was no other way of knowing when car engines weren't as big.

00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:45.980
 And so there were constantly, whenever anyone turned a corner, when everyone was coming up to a junction,

00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:49.980
 whenever you were about to park, you beeped your "Awoga!"

00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:50.980
 And people hated it.

00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:53.980
 It's kind of like the legacy of the man with the red flag.

00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:54.980
 Yes.

00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:55.980
 A little bit.

00:30:55.980 --> 00:30:56.980
 But less annoying, the man with the red flag.

00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:57.980
 I don't think I'd mind that as much.

00:30:57.980 --> 00:30:58.980
 No.

00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:01.980
 It's just a bit like, beep, beep, vehicle reversing.

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:04.980
 So, do you know who the godfather of backing up is?

00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:06.980
 Like the godfather of soul.

00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:07.980
 Yeah, just like that.

00:31:07.980 --> 00:31:11.980
 Do you mean you mean the sound or literally backing up a car?

00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:13.980
 The sound that's made when you backup a car.

00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:14.980
 The beeping.

00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:15.980
 So, when you're reversing.

00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:17.980
 So, who's the godfather of creating that sound?

00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:18.980
 I don't know what you're asking.

00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:19.980
 It's a man called Ed Peterson.

00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:21.980
 Oh, it's just about saying him.

00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:23.980
 So, he was the pioneer in the West.

00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:28.980
 And he may have been beaten to it by Matthew Saburo Yamaguchi in 1953.

00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:33.980
 But, Peterson noticed, he was working at a dam, a construction project, a huge construction project.

00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:38.980
 And he noticed, gosh, people keep being killed or injured when really heavy vehicles reverse into them.

00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:42.980
 If only there was somewhere, and he said that the flag men were just not doing their jobs.

00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:48.980
 And that was the system that weirdly, you know, like waving flags around, saying, look out, that system wasn't working.

00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:52.980
 I can't believe if you're holding a flag to wave and a person about to get run over.

00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:56.980
 Why aren't you also going, there's a car running you over, there's a car on quick and get out of the way.

00:31:56.980 --> 00:31:57.980
 I don't know.

00:31:57.980 --> 00:31:58.980
 I don't know.

00:31:58.980 --> 00:31:59.980
 Maybe they're standing at a distance.

00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:00.980
 Probably a union thing.

00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:01.980
 Yeah, a union thing.

00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:04.980
 If we won't pay the extra for that.

00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:06.980
 Anyway, just wanted to give him his credit.

00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:07.980
 Ed Peterson.

00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:08.980
 All right.

00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:11.980
 Do you know who has the best car horns?

00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:12.980
 Ooh.

00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:14.980
 What country?

00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:19.980
 Oh, is there a country where it's, you know, like a hundred pounds, like in juke's of hazard?

00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:21.980
 Ha, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.

00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:25.980
 Ah, so now you're interpreting it differently to how I mean.

00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:26.980
 The best.

00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:30.980
 So, by best, it's long-lasting, louder.

00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:32.980
 This is an india.

00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:33.980
 Yeah, yeah.

00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:34.980
 It is an india.

00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:40.980
 And the reason is is that because the culture of driving there has a much more emphasis on the beeping when you're in.

00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:41.980
 And so they need cars.

00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:49.980
 They actually make, like, Audi make stronger, better horns so that they don't run them down with the amount that they're using them.

00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:50.980
 Daz.

00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:52.980
 They do use it properly in India.

00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:55.980
 They use it to tell you I'm about to drive into India.

00:32:55.980 --> 00:32:56.980
 You're a danger, yeah, yeah.

00:32:56.980 --> 00:32:59.980
 Well, that supplies that incredibly bad drivers.

00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:02.980
 They're always using it properly, but they're always using it.

00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:04.980
 I think it's just lots of cars.

00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:05.980
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:08.980
 And the weight of Cross the road is just to get cracking.

00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:09.980
 It's like British kettles.

00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:11.980
 They just long, they're long-lasting.

00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:13.980
 This is personal anecdote, but.

00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:14.980
 British kettles.

00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:15.980
 British kettles.

00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:17.980
 Yeah, I was just confused by the analogy.

00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:20.980
 Well, I'm just remembering because Dan's wife was bought like 20 kettles.

00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:21.980
 Yes.

00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:23.980
 She keeps buying European ones because they look nice.

00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:27.980
 They keep dying because they can't keep up with the British tea consuming out of the kilowatts.

00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:32.980
 It's not like, dude, it's just kind of flooding that.

00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:37.980
 Did you come across the car that Cadillac invented which had a working toilet in it?

00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:40.980
 Oh, sorry, not Cadillac invented.

00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:43.980
 One random bloke modified so that he could...

00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:48.980
 This was a guy called Louis Mata and he wanted to drive 10,000 kilometers without stopping.

00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:50.980
 L.A. to New York and back.

00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:51.980
 Right.

00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:52.980
 So he must have put the toilet on the driving seat.

00:33:52.980 --> 00:33:53.980
 He put the toilet...

00:33:53.980 --> 00:33:54.980
 Well, there were a couple of them in the car.

00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:56.980
 How long does it take to drive that distance?

00:33:56.980 --> 00:33:58.980
 Must be like 10 days.

00:33:58.980 --> 00:33:59.980
 Might have taken...

00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:01.980
 That would be a thousand kilometers a day.

00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:02.980
 Maybe a bit longer than that.

00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:03.980
 I think that's quite a bit.

00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:04.980
 Yeah.

00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:08.980
 Or they'll have to stop at some stage to sleep.

00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:10.980
 Well, no, but there were a couple of them in the car.

00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:11.980
 So they would...

00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:12.980
 They would shift into the driving seat.

00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:14.980
 This was in 1952.

00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:16.980
 For God knows why he wanted to do this.

00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:19.980
 But he'd been in the Navy. He was an engineer.

00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:21.980
 And it had a toilet. It had a shower.

00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:24.980
 It had a TV, a fridge, and a sink.

00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:27.980
 And they were escorted when they were in a town by the local police

00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:28.980
 who would help them through the traffic lights.

00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:30.980
 So they could literally keep moving.

00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:32.980
 Just like a caravan, really.

00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:33.980
 Yeah.

00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:35.980
 It's just like a caravan, except I love this.

00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:37.980
 What's another flaw in this plan?

00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:40.980
 We have to let out what you're carrying.

00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:44.980
 Nice. He's got a shed load of petrol that's filling out the car.

00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:46.980
 You can refuel on the go.

00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:47.980
 That's cool.

00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:48.980
 That's cool.

00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:50.980
 And what if the worst happens?

00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:51.980
 You burst a tire.

00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:52.980
 Yeah.

00:34:52.980 --> 00:34:55.980
 They had a system to change a tire while the car was driving.

00:34:55.980 --> 00:34:56.980
 Wow.

00:34:56.980 --> 00:34:57.980
 It's so cool.

00:34:57.980 --> 00:35:00.980
 As Jack would lift up one tire and this tiny little supermarket trolley wheel

00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:02.980
 would take that corner of the car.

00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:05.980
 And then his friends would lean over the side and change the tire.

00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:07.980
 And then change it back and then you just pop it back up.

00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:11.980
 You would be impossible to steer if it's got a supermarket trolley wheel.

00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:17.980
 The laziest on this bit of observation of comedy that's ever been made.

00:35:17.980 --> 00:35:24.980
 Okay, that's it.

00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:25.980
 That is all of our outtakes.

00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:26.980
 We hope you enjoyed that.

00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:27.980
 You got any comments?

00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:28.980
 You got any questions?

00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:29.980
 You got any extra facts?

00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:31.980
 Why not send them to podcast@ky.com?

00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:37.980
 And if they are seen by Andy, they might make their way onto an upcoming drop us a line episode.

00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:38.980
 We love getting your emails.

00:35:38.980 --> 00:35:39.980
 So please do send them in.

00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:41.980
 Do remember the crosswire festival.

00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:42.980
 Sixth of July in Sheffield.

00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:43.980
 Get your tickets on our website.

00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:45.980
 No such thing as a fish.com.

00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:46.980
 Otherwise come back in a couple of weeks.

00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:49.980
 We'll have another bonus episode ready for you club fishers.

00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:50.980
 Until then, goodbye.
