 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of Fish. Before we get going, we just want to let you
 know that we have a very special guest on this week. So Andy's off away, God knows where, but in
 his place we have the wonderful Robin Ince. If you're not aware of Robin Ince, you can't really
 call yourself a true nerd. Robin is the great godfather of nerdery. He is the co-host of the
 brilliant Infinite Monkey Cage, the BBC Radio 4 show with Brian Cox. He is also the person who
 sort of gathers together all the dorks and geeks of the UK and gives them a platform and a place to
 be heard. One of those places is called CosmicShambles.com. Robin of course as well is an author. He's
 published numerous books in his latest book. The Importance of Being Interested, Adventures in
 Scientific Curiosity, is coming out this October, the 7th of October. Do get it, he's an amazing
 writer. I've read all of his previous books and I can't wait to read this one as well. Also he's
 going to be doing something quite astounding to promote the book. He is going on a hundred date
 tour of the UK to all the independent bookshops around the UK to do little talks and signings and
 so on and you can find the dates for those on CosmicShambles.com/100Bookshops and honestly
 you must see Robin Ince live. He's such a wonder to behold. He is such a fantastic guy and a really
 nice guy on top of everything else. We've wanted him on the show for years. We're so glad we finally
 got him so we hope you enjoy this episode. Do get his book, The Importance of Being Interested,
 but for now enjoy him on No Such Thing as a Fish. On with the show.
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you
 from four undisclosed locations in the UK. My name is Dan Schreiber. I'm sitting here with Anna
 Tyshinski, James Harkin and special guest it is Robin Ince and once again we have gathered
 around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular
 order here we go. Starting with fact number one that is Robin. The Nobel Prize winning scientist
 Richard Feynman was allowed to investigate the entirety of the universe except the Aurora
 Borealis which is a very beautiful thing. It has a beautiful story attached to it which is the fact
 that his sister Joan loved science. This is one of the few times that golf courses play an interesting
 part in the future of physics. Now this might be entirely wrong. One of the great lines about golf
 courses is Steve Eyelit, the writer who once said the only proof of the existence of God is that once
 a year a golfer is electrocuted in a thunderstorm. Oh God I can feel James getting wound up as you're
 speaking. But think of all those golfers who don't get hit by lightning. I know how evil is the one
 who God decides must die. So what's this about golf? I'm really interested. What's golf? Well
 in fact actually I've realised there is a oh no there is another golf link to science which is
 Fred Hoyle's steady state theory was partly influenced by the Ealing horror film Portmanteau
 horror film Dead of Night but we can get back to that I think at another time. No let's let's go there
 and let's end this whole section on you finally explaining your facts going along. It's like the
 other day I was doing a show about reality and I suddenly realised that Alice Cooper connected
 everything that I was going to talk about and this is the trouble isn't it with tangential thinking.
 But yeah Portmanteau horror film Dead of Night and I warn you there's a spoiler alert here so if
 you haven't seen it yet it did come out in 1945 but if you haven't seen it yet I'm going to give
 out something about it at the end. So it's about a man who visits a house and when he gets to the
 house he's like I'm sure I've been here before and everyone in the house has a different story
 including a terrifying story involving a ventriloquist possessed by his dummy or not we're not entirely
 sure played by Michael Redgrove and there's also a beautiful golfing story from the great
 Basil Radford and Norton Wayne two golfers who play golf to win over a woman's heart and it all
 goes horribly wrong but at the end of the film the man wakes up from his terrible nightmare and has
 to drive to the house which we then realise is the house where we began and he is in this cycle
 of reality and that led to Fred Hoyle thinking about now the theory of the universe this kind of
 cycle of size that we see so um to that I've suddenly realised is the other place golfing
 actually may have played a much bigger part in refuted physics of the 20th century so first
 of all I'd like to apologise I'm not normally on this show as everyone realises so I tell you the
 story now I'm sorry this is so yes so basically that's the thing Robin the problem with golf is
 there's links oh man I can't believe it's five minutes to a pun but when one like that comes out
 that is fantastic what a beautiful fantasy these two had practiced that for hours beforehand it's
 worth the build up I can't even remember what the golf link was so Joan Feynman woke up his
 young sister Joan and took her to the golf course because this was the darkest place to go because
 that night they could witness from just outside New York the Aurora Borealis and a deal was made
 and the deal was he could have the whole of the rest of the universe to investigate but Joan
 was allowed to have the Aurora Borealis and he could not go near it we should just explain who
 Richard Feynman was he was an extraordinary character in the world of science the Nobel prize
 winning physicist he was very much one of the fathers of quantum mechanics and as a child the
 stories that you have to read his autobiography and um genius by James Glyke it is just full of him
 just doing experiments including on his sitster and so he rigged up her cot so that it was sort of
 electrically generated so that it would go back and forth he paid her pocket money four cents to
 be sticking her finger in electrical sockets and sorry dad I think she was paid to press switches
 and she might have put her finger in the socket just for fun to kind of show off to his friends right
 I don't think he paid her well some reports from her are that he would occasionally say when his
 friends were around pop your finger in that so I think there's there's some wonderful interviews
 that she did with Christopher Sykes who was the maker of Pleasure of Finding Things Out the
 horizon documentary about Richard Feynman and she just talks about its play you know even in her 90s
 when someone would say what is science Joan she said it's play and it's something that gets missed
 out so much in a lot of the science education in the UK you know I'm sure all of us have the
 experience of working with scientists and we're asking the excitement when they see a new idea
 or they see a new snail shell it's filled with excitement and play and joy I like that it extends
 to going to the cinema and watching ealing horrors and you come out going oh I've just invented a
 model of how the universe functions I like how golf tells you a lot about physics as well okay I
 can I can now see that Dan's gonna go to the cinema and James is gonna go to the golf course both
 expecting to come back Nobel Prize winners and you're gonna be sorely disappointed so Richard
 Feynman was great at encouraging science communication right and this is obviously partly what
 inspired Joan and he even used to come into her room at night kind of annoying actually
 for instance she'd cry out for a glass of water in the middle of the night and he'd come to her
 bedroom and rather than give her the water he'd always swill it around in the glass apparently
 to demonstrate centrifugal forces which does sound annoying and also at one point it did fly out of
 his hand and smash against the wall so fun fun and dangerous Richard was very very supportive of her
 but the world wasn't when she was trying to do her dissertation one of the professors who was
 teaching her said why don't you write it on cobwebs because that's going to help when you're
 cleaning houses you mean sorry you mean why don't you write about cobwebs right not on as in sort of
 like trying in a tiny tiny pen yeah it turns out he was really supportive when he was trying to innovate
 and she actually wrote it in the end on the absorption of infrared radiation in crystals
 of diamond type lattice structure just kind of cobwebs infrared radiation it's not much
 I've got to be honest and I don't want to be the bad guy here but I would have been more likely to
 read the cobwebs one than the lattice structure one just small catchy isn't it I love a cobweb
 ironically that phd dissertation is now covered in cobwebs I didn't know he's never read it have
 but no she was brilliant yeah and the mother was quite progressive but still said to her
 oh women don't have the minds to do science you know that's how deep the belief was she was only
 eight when her mum said women don't have the brains for science and she sort of sat in her chair
 sobbing incessantly which is quite impressive at eight no you want to be a scientist I think
 all I knew was I wanted to climb a tree yeah I think there's an interesting thing to learn from
 both the Feynman's here in terms of looking at progress Richard Feynman didn't get into his first
 choice university because at that point in the 1930s there was a Jewish quota and that is an
 incredible thing to know I think and in the same way what Joan Feynman had to deal with was also
 the fact that women can't do this and we're not going to allow and sometimes even as a professional
 scientist there were rooms where she was told oh women aren't allowed to go up there and she had
 but she did keep on trying to get into the men's bathroom didn't she which but that was only because
 her brother kept coming into her bed yeah and she was only going into the men's bathroom show
 centrifugal force which of course made a right old mess but in a men's bathroom you can't really
 tell that much because they're always in such a state in the first place but I think the importance
 of role models it must not be forgotten because I think in science this is still going on it's getting
 better but we still need that going on all of the time because science is for everyone and it would
 be crazy not to realize that you know the excitement of curiosity is not limited by you know an x or
 a y chromosome yeah yeah I think she had an amazing psychiatrist actually because she went to a
 psychiatrist to say what shall I do whereas usually I guess you'd say have these antidepressants and
 maybe try some CBT the psychiatrist basically said why don't you apply to this earth observatory at
 Columbia University and that's what you need isn't it so great psychiatry is terrible rabbi
 because the rabbi said what right do you have to have these science jobs that are meant for men some
 of them haven't got a job so there we go there's a great the battle there some of them haven't got a
 job you've got to wait till all the men have a job and then you can start applying should we talk
 about what she discovered because it was pretty cool I mean she did hog quite a cool thing and
 hogging the auroras she essentially realized that it was these kind of charged particles that are
 flying out of the sun and when the sun's having a particularly turbulent time when there's a
 little bunch of storms on the surface of the sun then the northern lights get bigger and so she
 equated those two and thought one must be causing the other and I hadn't actually realized these
 cycles that the sun goes through it's got an 11 year cycle of high and low activity and that's
 caused by its magnetic poles switching around every 11 years which is very often given the earth
 it has been ages hasn't it since we did it but also it's got this 88 year cycle that's kind of
 running underneath that where the 11 year peaks and troughs kind of get higher and lower there is
 another cycle that I know of which is there's always a trough whenever I go to Iceland to see
 the northern lights which has been on two occasions and every single time they were like oh if you
 were here last week it was amazing see I think that that's a correlation causation issue I don't
 know if your presence is causing a difference you have to time it right because if they know that
 Joanna Lumley is going to be making one of her documentaries where she goes I've always been
 fascinated in the aurora borealis then the magnetosphere the solar winds go hold back
 Joanna Lumley is coming next week James is mainly doing audio based stuff it's really not important
 to get involved um do you know what the oldest depiction of the northern nights is we think
 is it like on a cave painting well it is but it's specifically a macaroni
 a penguin snow no so this is a cave painting it's 30 000 years old which is very cool I'm
 not convinced it's the northern lights because you know when you look at cave paintings and it
 all looks like smears on a cave and then everyone goes well this is clearly a walrus and this is a
 aurora borealis but these are chromagnon cave paintings in France and it's a specific type
 of paleolithic finger tracings in clay which is called macaroni which I'd never heard of so the
 first northern nights is a macaroni but it is quite remarkable when you think you know that cave
 whether it's true or not and I think your right to probably be skeptical because there's so much
 new investigation in terms of what cave paintings mean but I do think you know that that moment of
 experiencing something like that I don't know if you ever went there with the tape modern
 about probably 15 years ago there was an artist who created this piece which was basically just the
 sun rising and what he wanted to create was something that had the impact of what it must
 have been like each morning to see this thing which you know was almost like a godlike experience
 and he did really create that I've got to say standing in that turbine hall the way that it
 connected to was just remarkable and when you talk about the aurora borealis I think you know
 I've never experienced it I'm I had the same as you in Iceland I think Paul O'Grady was going to
 be there the next week so the aurora borealis stayed off for me as well but that experience
 should really hit you in the gut every now and again to go that is up there what is going on
 how is it that a universe exists that creates these things that we have somehow evolved to find
 beautiful and fascinating and mesmeric yeah although I had exactly the same thing as you
 too in Norway so I'm starting to suspect the northern lights actually don't exist and it's a huge
 conspiracy okay it is time for fact number two and that is Anna my fact this week is that at the
 turn of the 20th century women wore pedometers to balls to track how many miles they were dancing
 well miles a single ball that's a lot of dancing isn't it oh god they were dancing
 miles and miles well one dance was about a mile a mile and a half and this was all the rage women
 would strap pedometers to their knees or their feet and they'd go to a ball and there would be
 competitions over who would dance a furthest so you'd show your pedometer at the end of the night
 and I think the winner of one contestor was reading dance 25 miles in a night wow which
 that girl has not gone without a partner for the evening yeah with these those those dancers
 whereas a big group they were dancing together with a one-on-one with partners you know partner
 dancers at the balls yeah you're technically supposed to be going I think to find a husband
 back in the day it was a debutante era but one of the complaints about the pedometers in one of
 the newspaper articles I read is that it was distracting the women from seducing their husbands
 because they were so into counting their number of steps and competing over that that they forgot
 to do their duty that's amazing did anyone sort of just quickly leave the venue and just go for a
 mad dash you know and just clock up the numbers and come back was there I don't I don't think a mad
 dash would help because dancing you're dancing almost as fast as you I mean you can't really
 run for 25 miles straight true have you just watched the marathon just watched the Olympic
 marathon that's just happened I just think it's much harder in heels and a corset it's probably
 easier to do a bit of jigging do you think that in the bathrooms when you went into the ladies
 bathroom everyone would just be kind of jiggling around to keep the pedometer going you know like
 if you really need the toilet you kind of do that little jiggly run on the spot don't you
 that's where that comes from actually yeah yeah what would be the best tap dancing I guess would be
 the most or like river dance yeah definitely you're wasting a lot of leg time in the air though
 with one of them legs well I think a ska music festival would work very well because you would
 something like lip up fatty from the band bad manners there's a lot of movement as in which is
 kind of a walkie movement so I would say if you perhaps set up this experiment in a series of
 different butlins holiday camps across the south coast you would take various different genres I
 think northern soul would go well but northern soul as you said before the high kick element of
 that possibly means that you're not traveling as far as you imagine that the leg is going high but
 it's only traveling a you know a meter or so I think in terms of rave culture of the of the late
 80s early 90s so any of those come back that seems to be quite a stoical thing it's a mainly upper
 body stuff so I think there's a lot of research to be done here yeah yeah I'm sure Shakira could
 clock up some numbers with a bum shake I'm sure if it was attached to the thigh that would give
 vigorous well you're going to get a really accurate reading because our hips don't lie of course
 well this is do you remember the film that they shoot horses don't they which was it was about
 marath this terrible thing that was done during the depression in America which was marathon dance
 competitions where you just danced and the winner would then get some money when everyone was desperate
 for money but they would go on for days and days people actually died dancing yeah I would imagine
 no one if they'd had a pedometer that would have already gone down to the pawnbroker so they wouldn't
 have had that on that because that was why they were there but it's just that fascinating thing
 where you know dance becomes torture and I think when you talk about 25 mars I mean that amount of
 dancing I'm reckoning if we went for a walk that's what seven to eight hours of walking uh six
 six hours probably I walk fast because I have places to go and I believe life is finite but there's a
 lot of dawdlers and I would say between dawdlers and then kind of people like me I reckon it's about
 3.2 miles an hour so that's a lot yeah wow because Anna and I have been for a walk in the park every
 now and then just to kind of chat work and I must say that is probably the best workout I've had in
 the last two years trying to keep up with Anna walking around a park it's ridiculous yeah it was
 awkward when I realized you'd collapsed so are you one of those people like me which is I don't
 mind stopping and looking at things and I don't mind having a slow walk if there's things around but
 the dawdle is something which because you know there's a certain way that some people what where
 you go you have no ambition you know that there's a way that you just I am like you yes I judge someone's
 entire character a level of ambition based on their walk and then I'm furious with them and kind
 of want to push them in front of a car and they deserve it well the worst thing was you had to
 push me half a mile out of the park to get to the road I did yeah really went for it but yeah I would
 have been clocking up those those 25 miles and they said even at the time these women said that
 it was really addictive just like it is today whenever anyone has step counters because it made
 a little tick every time you stepped and so you couldn't resist making this tick happen and people
 were worried their mother said they're dancing too much it's dangerous and I think some of them
 maybe rigged it because there's this thing with pedometers about whether it's about steps or whether
 it's about distance and of course this would tell you how much distance you traveled but that was
 because you had to set it to your step length so I think you could set it to anywhere between 15
 and 41 inch step length so if as a cheating lady you said every step you step 41 inches then that's
 going to say you've traveled further isn't it wow so the modern day pedometers came after the
 Tokyo Olympics in the 1960s and there was a Japanese company called Yamatsa the Yamatsa company
 and they came up with this new kind of pedometer and they thought that everyone should walk 10,000
 steps a day and there's a lot of controversy whether that is just a completely random number
 that they made up or whether there's actually any science to it whatsoever and there is a
 professor of epidemiology at Harvard called Aimin Lee and she reckons having spoken to the people
 who came up with the idea that they chose 10,000 because the Japanese character for 10,000 looks
 a little bit like a man walking and they thought it would be a really good way of publicizing it
 but then there are other people who say well actually they did a bit of maths about it and
 worked out how many people would have less mortality due to more exercise and stuff so
 yeah pedometers are the subject of the longest movie ever made I discovered the longest movie
 ever now previously on fish we spoke about the longest movie ever made being called ambience
 which was 720 hours long the trailer itself was 72 minutes that has since been overtaken by a movie
 which is 857 hours long so this was made in 2008 by Erica Magnussen and Daniel Anderson
 and they wanted to look at where the pedometer came from so they had this idea of following the
 production cycle but in reverse chronological order so basically it's an 857 hour long movie
 backwards wow this this sounds actually I would almost rather read Joan Feynman's dissertation
 than watch that that's amazing there's a lot of reviews on imdb you know as it starts off slow
 says one person post three and a half days of runtime kind of boring but oh my god by the
 fourth through to the 25th days things really pick up so you know check it out what do we know
 what the point is was it some sort of artistic experiment was it a bet it's definitely an
 artistic experiment yeah they didn't just plan to make a feature length film and it got out of
 hand they just had so much material and a bad editor they can be dangerous can't they pedometers
 and Fitbits and stuff there was a a pig in northern england the Eta pedometer pood it out
 and it was in a bit of warm poo and hay and because it had a lithium ion battery it exploded
 and set fire to the entire farm there luckily no animals were hurt sounds so much like an
 insurance scam to me I'm sorry but you know when you go when you know when the farmers making up the
 story when they just had things haven't really worked out on my pig farm and you will not believe
 what happened right so I left the pedometer over there and he's always been 100 I would not pay out
 on that one surely that's more likely to be true than I dropped it in the toilet or something for
 your like it's it's who would make that no no but I'm not I'm not talking about the claiming
 insurance on the pedometer I'm talking about claiming insurance on the entire farm cause yeah
 you've got to get bigger ambition James yeah yeah you need an arsonist don't you but you can't say
 there was a crime committed because then the police get involved so if you say it was the pig then
 who's going to arrest a pig oh in France and I'm sure you've covered many pig trials on this show
 still one of my one of the greatest films if people haven't seen the hour of the pig it's
 brilliant for it's all about a pig trial and was it is it a pedometer based crime no it's
 it's pre-pedometer and it starts off beautifully with a man and his donkey about to be hanged for
 some sexual shenanigans so there's a donkey with a noose around it and the man with a noose
 around it and this man running through and he's going stop stop stop and you see the man go
 and he goes the donkey has been pardoned everyone in the town has said it is on good character
 and then you see the donkey's news taken off and the man dropped from the gallows
 I mean I'm definitely watching that and I think that's going to be the one takeaway from this podcast
 yeah
 okay it is time for fact number three and that is James okay my fact this week is that
 Charles Darwin invented the office chair did he well did he that's a great question Anna did
 yeah so that's my skepticism I'm gonna go on I'm gonna say that he invented the kind of
 wheelie office chair that you have and I'm saying that because his chair had wheels on and this is
 the first example we know of I was reading an article in the New York Times it was a review
 of a book called a taxonomy of office chairs by Jonathan Olivares and he talked about all the
 history of office chairs and he said that Charles Darwin had a customized wooden armchair in his
 home and he would wheel around his front room looking from specimen to specimen and then I
 went onto the welcome collections website and they have a photograph of this very chair so it
 definitely did exist they have a photo of the interior of Charles Darwin's study which shows
 that it's kind of just like an old armchair with just casters on the bottom of it okay but yeah
 the evolution of the chair started from there yeah the origin of this species of chair yes
 Robin I assume you've been to Darwin's house have you seen this chair no I haven't that's what I was
 thinking about I kind of flash back think have I seen that a downhouse and and I don't remember
 seeing that but they don't let you have a go on the furniture so that's the thing is it depends how
 discreet it is you know and especially they would have all known I'm a big Starlight Express fan so
 of course that would have crashed yeah I mean I love the idea of that wheelchair going around his
 wonderful thought pathway he would go round and round and I think there's something rather
 attractive about that idea so what is that he used to walk around just to think of things
 throughout the day he would have these moments when he would basically have some stones in his
 pocket and he would make a little pile of stones so he would know roughly how many times he'd walked
 round and it would just be to take himself into somewhere else to just mull over whatever he'd
 recently found out about a pigeon skeleton or whatever else had been boiled down but I mean
 going back to what we talked about with Joan Feynman as well that curiosity and that play
 yeah now I want to go and have a look at this particular crab that's over there and now I'll
 look at this barnacle over there and that lovely thing when he would go to London Zoo and and he
 would look at some of the viper snakes and he would see if he could stop himself from reacting
 so obviously the snake can't get to him and he would just stand and just look at the snake wait
 for it to strike and they are I still react you know and that that's just plain people would have
 walked past them and who's the guy over there with the big sideboards who's looks like he's goading
 snakes but I've just recently been to London Zoo and my experience is very different that the
 snakes just kind of hide and you spend half your time going is that a twig or is it a snake I'm
 not sure they didn't do much of the attacking when I was there although I did that's that's that's
 the fun thing isn't it of I mean Edinburgh Zoo I think used to be the zoo that had the most hiding
 animals to the point where you began to think this is predominantly hay but I love that reptile
 house is such a delight I think because you see that you know the old structure of the zoo there
 I absolutely love looking at the snakes I don't know I'm starting to think the zoos might be
 in other northern lights they're just a huge con only when Joanna Lumley goes so the snakes emerge
 but yeah he was from like a super early age crazily curious wasn't he and not a very good
 student so I hadn't realized that Darwin's dad thought he was a bit useless said that you know
 this boy will never concentrate on anything but he just was obsessed with collecting stuff
 there was one story where he found two unusual looking beetles that he thought were new species
 and then he found the third one and so he put one of the two in his mouth so he could carry the third
 one home as well I don't know why he couldn't just carry two beetles in one hand but he put it in his
 mouth and he accidentally bit down on it or it squirted some disgusting poison into his mouth
 so sadly lost his beetles on that occasion wow always collecting it's like with his his barnacles
 which is Steve Jones who's a wonderful writer I'm sure you know and he is a great expert on
 Darwin and I once said to him are there any books by Darwin that I shouldn't read and he said don't
 bother with these books about barnacles he became overly obsessed so there's a story of I forget which
 son it was who was so used to seeing Charles just looking at barnacles all the time and they were
 being delivered from around the world people sending specimens barnacles to him that when he
 went around to a friend's house he started running around all the rooms and became increasingly
 confused and rather upset because he couldn't find the room where his friend's father did his
 barnacles and that was when it had to be explained that not all parents spend most of their time
 examining barnacles I think that's you know there's a all father doing barnacles don't I know I was
 reading about what happened when his son William was born he just started measuring everything
 the sneezing the hiccuping the yawning the stretching right but the papers are amazing
 because they really read like a very proud father who kind of thinks that his children are so advanced
 he's like um of course sucking and screaming were well performed by my infant he wrote at one stage
 and then he said I touched the naked stole of his foot with a bit of paper and he jerked it away
 much like an older child would do when tickled oh no he's one of the parents at the school gate
 my child's two good children I used to work in a children's bookshop where you would always get
 people coming in and going uh my um son is four but he has a reading age of 10 and of course you
 would show them a book for a 10 year old go well I don't think he'll quite be able to manage that
 and then eventually when you sold them a book for a two year old uh but you know but that was
 we're often told that Victorian parents were quite detached from their children I think it's
 kind of quite a myth and you would see that the relationship that Charles and Emma Darwin had
 with their children was incredible closeness there's so many beautiful letters between Emma and Charles
 which are filled with love and which entirely disintegrate some of the illusions that we have
 about Victorian behavior right wow um he had a really cool uncle who sadly died quite young who
 looked like he might have made a lot of innovations in the medical world and he was called Charles
 Darwin as well and Charles Darwin the one we're talking about was fascinated by him even visiting
 the university where he worked at to meet his professors to say hi because he never met him
 he died before Charles was born but when he was young he had a stammer and there was a theory
 that his father had that if he taught his son French he would get rid of the stammer so he was
 packed off to Paris where he learned and studied under a reverend who taught him to speak French
 fluently and it got rid of his stammer but only in French so he always had a stammer in English
 but never in French it's quite weird to picture Darwin's trip on the beagle right because that
 was just one huge massacre and for someone who was kind of too squeamish to be a doctor when he
 was training to be a doctor he once ran from the room because someone was being operated on
 but he did love shooting and like we'll just go around like bashing things on the head strangling
 them you know poisoning them and eating them all for science all for science and a bit for fun
 one of the things he did was he ate lots of tortoises which we've probably mentioned before
 and this was one of the things that tipped him off to evolution he ate a tortoise on one island
 and then he ate what seemed to be the same tortoise on another island really close by
 and it tasted a bit sweeter and this is one of the things he recorded he was like why is the
 tortoise on this island sweeter than the tortoise on this island how have they diverged you know
 why would God do this make these tiny little differences so close together but wait a minute
 how come everything has evolved to taste like chicken then he didn't actually didn't address that
 there's a line that i've often repeated in fact the most recent book i wrote originally this is
 what i wanted to call it because it's something that i love which is when he talks about being around
 the rainforest and he says one's eyes attempt to follow the flight of a gaudy butterfly but
 is soon distracted by some strange tree or fruit today my mind was a chaos of delight
 and i think that's the thing chaos of delight which is a phrase i've used many many times
 is such a good way of explaining what the truly curious are always being attracted to yeah well
 and also as well as delighting in your discoveries getting so angry when things go wrong you know
 just being passionate generally like one of my favorite letters i read of darwin's recently
 was when he'd been looking into bees that pollinate red clover some had a long proboscis some had a
 short one and they got nectar in different ways quite a niche discovery he thought he'd made
 he told his friend john lubeck said i'm really excited about this and then he wrote a follow-up
 saying he'd realized that he was wrong and he said i do hope you haven't wasted any time for
 my stupid blunder i hate myself i hate clover and i hate bees and that's yeah speaking of finding
 beauty in the banal what about office chairs we quickly talk about those maybe
 chairs are killing us chairs are killing us what because chair sitting puts 30 more pressure
 on your spinal discs than standing up varicose veins only exist in cultures that do lots of chair
 sitting if you sit down for long periods it means your muscles and your legs don't fire which means
 your pancreas doesn't get the message to produce lipase which is the enzyme that you need in your
 liver to digest fat and there is an amazing person called professor galen cramps who says basically
 we all need to stop sitting down too much because it's killing us and i spoke to professor cramps
 this morning and she was basically telling me that there's loads of massive studies with epidemiologists
 looking at really really really massive data sets and they have found correlation with premature
 mortality and sitting down which is greater than the correlation for being old being fat or being a
 smoker so sitting down according to some studies is more dangerous than that and for that reason
 professor cramps doesn't have any chairs in her house i read this in an article she's a terrible
 host doesn't she if you go around yeah okay in fairness she has a couple for when guests come
 round she did say i read this in an article from new scientists about 20 years ago and i emailed
 professor cramps says is it still true that you don't have any chairs in your house and she says
 yeah she's continued that experiment for over 20 years and she perches at the kitchen island when
 she wants to eat she thinks that perching is a good way it's like half sitting and half standing
 whenever she's doing any work on her computer she always uses a she's long
 even as a guest if she did put the two chairs out you'd feel so judged sitting in them wouldn't you
 wouldn't risk it but yeah like so there's obviously a lot of chat about how sitting's
 bad for you now and standing desk which i have are useful and i also try squatting because i think
 about a quarter of people when they're at rest or when they're at work they will adopt a squat
 rather than a seat so a quarter of people in the world that's around the world yeah absolutely
 sorry not in the office but i've tried squatting and you can't do it for long or i can't
 i always try working in a squat at a low table and i think once you've had 30 years of not doing it
 it's pretty hard to get back isn't it well yeah that is the problem actually it's like all these
 things about not sitting down really once you've been sitting down for 30 years doing anything
 else can put a lot of pressure on your body and give you pain and discomfort but we know that in
 history people have squatted more than they've sat and not least because we haven't found many
 chairs from history but also because when you squat down the end of your shin bone kind of presses
 into a little bone on your ankle and it gets a little indentation and we can see by lots of old
 skeletons that that's how people must have spent a lot of their time so we know that in history
 squatting has been the standard way of resting okay you know one thing i really loved about this fact
 was such a seminal character is the person who we have the oldest example of a of an office chair
 from but also a bit further back in history the oldest example that we have of the swivel chair
 is from thomas jefferson the story goes is that he wrote up the declaration of independence while
 sitting on this swivel chair because it has a little table that is attached to it and a revolutionary
 chair very nice he also had a pedometer thomas jefferson yeah the earliest ones we know about
 yeah he had it made by an expert watchmaker in paris and he even sent one to one of the
 early presidents i think it was madison maybe yeah but he gave his swivel chair to martha
 didn't he his daughter and she said that she thinks he did indeed write the declaration of
 independence on it and his opponents took the piss out of him for his stupid chairs and called them
 whirligigs and said you know they look at thomas and his stupid whirligig that allows him to look
 in all directions at once isn't he and moron they didn't say that that's my addition
 okay it is time for our final fact of the show and that is my fact my fact this week is that horror
 movies often have two soundtracks one you can hear and one you can't oh well i know that sounds
 spooky but it is literally for spooky reasons so this is the idea of infrasound and infrasound is
 any frequency that is sort of 19 hertz below so humans can hear 20 hertz and above as soon as you
 get lower it becomes out of earshot but your body can sort of feel the sensation of the sound if
 there's a big sound system in the room you can give you a sense of sort of oh what's going on here
 you know it it can give you the shivers do you know any examples of movies that have done this
 like sound of music presumably not but well it's mainly the examples that they give are for thriller
 slash horror movies so irreversible was said to have used it and paranormal activity is rumored
 to have used it as well they sometimes are sounds that are like i don't know a fan going or an air
 conditioner but they play with the bass as such that it creates an eerie noise i did read the air
 conditioning can achieve this effect which maybe explains why being in the office is such a scary
 experience peacocks can do it if a peacock kind of wiggles its tail it makes this really really
 deep sound that humans can't hear but if you were able to hear it it'd be about as loud as a car
 driving past you and they do it to kind of signal to each other but yeah i guess if you walk past
 a peacock you might feel a bit uneasy does that happen you feel like a lot of eyes are watching
 you well that's the famous darwin line the sight of the feathers in a peacock tail make me sick
 really yeah he felt that the that expenditure felt like such a waste for the nature of survival
 but you have to have that huge expenditure and and it's such a lovely line because it feels like
 a very modern line you don't expect to suddenly find that in in darwin no as a horror movie fan
 i'm not keen on this idea because i'm a big fan of atmospheric horror films which really get
 under your skin in fact brilliantly you mentioned sound and music isn't it amazing how quickly
 you can create some kind of sense of synchronicity in any of these programs yeah you know i think it
 was it was it uh it was robert wise i think he directed sound and music and he also directed
 the haunting and that is one of those films where so much of the unsettling nature of it is not that
 you ever see a ghost but you hear noises there's a sense that there is something wrong with the house
 yeah well it's whenever i watch horror films i was watching horror film on my own recently
 actually and the way to find it not scary is absolutely not to close your eyes it's to just
 cover up your ears and immediately a horror film will become completely innocuous it's so weird i
 think it's more about the sound hitchcock said that 33 percent of the effect of psycho was entirely
 due to the music yeah they did do test audiences with the movie where in the shower scene there was
 no music originally and it just didn't have the impact and then they put the music on and suddenly
 the scariest scene in cinema to that point yeah that's really interesting what was the horror
 film you were watching by the way uh it was called his house my house her house it's fantastic it's
 really good yeah his house if yeah anyone listen to this if you've not seen it i think it was nominated
 for about the very deservedly i was just watching it at home and i was like i hope it stops being
 scary because i want to go to the loo and i'm not sure i can risk going down these stairs now because
 the changing understanding of the narrative in it and that's why i find that kind of use of
 infrasound to me that feels like a very hollywood thing which is going oh we can do this thing instead
 no do you know what film something brilliantly yeah but then do you want to get rid of soundtracks
 altogether then for that reason as well no i love i love soundtracks because i think when
 they're well used when you get uh i mean like i rewatch dawn of the dead which it has a really
 upbeat and you go this is far too upbeat for the number of guts that are being eaten but
 it works by being this meeting of two very different worlds but that marriage reminds
 me of tubular bells to me it is terrifying and that's not a frightening tune that's just because
 it was in the exorcist and that's actually quite a plinky plonky you know the tune the terrifying
 bit from the exorcist like it's quite hard to hum um but yeah it's marrying that slightly chirpy
 with the terrifying do you think we're going to get sued do you think um michael field's gonna
 come in he's coming for us yeah after anna sang that thank god his daughter used to work for qi so
 that she's she's been on fish chat to her she has molly back in the day i love that way though
 how can we get away with uh playing a tune and not having to pay copyright by not really remembering
 it very well you can't play it you know it's that michael field um just on um horror films in their
 soundtracks i didn't know that instruments have specifically been built for horror movies so in
 harmonic instruments basically instruments that do the opposite of what good instruments do and
 they create notes that don't go together very naturally when you sort of all my instruments
 do that oh yeah yeah no there are many reasons why you might make in harmonic sounds but the most
 famous in harmonic instrument is probably the waterphone and so it's like a bowl and it's got
 like bronze rods that stick up out of the edges of the bowl and they're all different lengths
 and like diameters and stuff and you get a violin bow or something maybe to tap it and you bow the
 rods and they just make a very non-harmonic sound and it's used in lots of films it's used
 in poltergeist let the right one in aliens but what i like about it as well is that the waterphone
 involves a little bit of water in the bowl which is why it's called that it was invented by richard
 waters and used in the horror film dark water amazing oh wow three totally unrelated waters in one
 fact that's so cool the other thing's the tritone kind of two notes that one comes after the other
 and it kind of makes you feel uneasy because you think that should be something next it's in the
 theme to the simpsons so you know when it goes the simpsons it's kind of you think well where are
 you going after that it's weird it's just kind of a weird kind of two notes coming after each other
 is that the one banned in churches james or is that a different one well that's the one that the
 internet says was banned in churches for sure whether it was actually banned i personally don't
 think so but definitely western musicians really shied away from it for hundreds and hundreds
 of years because they thought it was slightly demonic it is objectively spooky because i've
 never thought about it before but the theme tune to the simpsons which is not a spooky show except
 for the halloween specials is kind of scary regardless of content i don't know why they did
 that weird danny elfman of oingo boingo which is still one of the greatest names for a band really
 yeah so funny doesn't he sing he sings that bit of the simpsons doesn't he and as a result the
 royalties that he's received ever since uh so far greater than any other work that he's done
 basically did i sing it close enough to the actual theme tune that i'm gonna have to send him a tenor
 in the post yeah dammit like yeah i remember doing a thing with i've forgotten her name who's
 who's the voice of uh bart nancy nancy cartwright yeah i remember doing a radio show with her and
 there was someone in the audience who had a birthday like a little child and they said oh can you
 say happy birthday as as bart simpsons she went no i can't for copyright reasons really wow really
 weird thing that's what would and i tell you guys about the most recent um horror movie i watched
 perhaps we're doing that um it was called slacks have you heard of this s la xx can you guess what
 the murderer is in this case i'll give you a clue it's a non-human is it a pair of it's a pair of
 shoes it's not oh it's not a pair of slacks it's a pair of slacks but that's not what slacks are
 for many oh god there's trousers on there it's about a killer pair of jeans uh and i was just
 googling about it see if there's anything interesting about it and it comes up on a lot of lists of
 horror movies where the antagonist is a non-human or non-animal so there was one in 2001 called the
 shaft can you guess what the killer was there yes a um elevator shaft but why is the shaft itself
 the killer well it was originally called the lift but it got remade in america they called
 it the shaft and also they were going to call it just down uh and the tagline for that movie reads
 take the stairs for god's sake take the stairs sounds amazing anyone going to see it imagining
 it's a remake of the film shaft they'll find themselves very confused i hope isek hay still
 did the music of the wires yeah that'd be amazing has anyone seen the movie this is relatively famous
 called rubber is that a tire that goes through the desert and goes yeah yeah yeah that's a great
 idea yeah it's about a sentient tire that goes around and it has psychokinesis we never learned
 why it has psychokinesis but it could just look at you and start vibrating and then it explodes you
 uh and there was the final one which was a korean movie i think and it's called the red shoes can you
 guess what the killer is there oh it is is this a trick is it purple Dorothy it's a pair of purple
 shoes literally no idea why they call it the red shoes but this woman finds a pair of purple high
 heels uh and then jealousy greed and death follows her wherever she walks in them right but the
 original red shoes based on the kind of folktale which is a pal and press burger film is a very
 haunting piece of work Robert Heltman famously the the child catcher who for many of my generation
 is one of the scariest characters in chit chit bang bang you know come come and get your sweeties
 children come and get your sweeties and there's a lovely story of when a friend of Robert Heltman
 took his kids to go and see chit chit bang bang and uh then he he rang up Robert Heltman he said
 Robert i've got a bit of a problem you're coming around for sunday lunch and uh well my kids i've
 just taken chit chit bang bang and they were absolutely terrified of you and he went oh yes
 he said well could you say something to them over the phone now just so that they know you're an actor
 and that you're not really the child's catcher you went of course just bring the children to the
 phone and when the children got to the phone you went i'm coming to catch you chit chit bang
