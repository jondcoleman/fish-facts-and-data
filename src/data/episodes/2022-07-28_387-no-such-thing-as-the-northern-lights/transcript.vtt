00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.120
 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of Fish. Before we get going, we just want to let you

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:10.720
 know that we have a very special guest on this week. So Andy's off away, God knows where, but in

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:16.400
 his place we have the wonderful Robin Ince. If you're not aware of Robin Ince, you can't really

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:22.160
 call yourself a true nerd. Robin is the great godfather of nerdery. He is the co-host of the

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:28.640
 brilliant Infinite Monkey Cage, the BBC Radio 4 show with Brian Cox. He is also the person who

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.240
 sort of gathers together all the dorks and geeks of the UK and gives them a platform and a place to

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:40.720
 be heard. One of those places is called CosmicShambles.com. Robin of course as well is an author. He's

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.440
 published numerous books in his latest book. The Importance of Being Interested, Adventures in

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.840
 Scientific Curiosity, is coming out this October, the 7th of October. Do get it, he's an amazing

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.240
 writer. I've read all of his previous books and I can't wait to read this one as well. Also he's

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:02.320
 going to be doing something quite astounding to promote the book. He is going on a hundred date

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:09.040
 tour of the UK to all the independent bookshops around the UK to do little talks and signings and

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:16.960
 so on and you can find the dates for those on CosmicShambles.com/100Bookshops and honestly

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:22.080
 you must see Robin Ince live. He's such a wonder to behold. He is such a fantastic guy and a really

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.640
 nice guy on top of everything else. We've wanted him on the show for years. We're so glad we finally

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.360
 got him so we hope you enjoy this episode. Do get his book, The Importance of Being Interested,

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.360
 but for now enjoy him on No Such Thing as a Fish. On with the show.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.840
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.440
 from four undisclosed locations in the UK. My name is Dan Schreiber. I'm sitting here with Anna

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:07.360
 Tyshinski, James Harkin and special guest it is Robin Ince and once again we have gathered

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.000
 around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.120
 order here we go. Starting with fact number one that is Robin. The Nobel Prize winning scientist

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:25.440
 Richard Feynman was allowed to investigate the entirety of the universe except the Aurora

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:32.000
 Borealis which is a very beautiful thing. It has a beautiful story attached to it which is the fact

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.920
 that his sister Joan loved science. This is one of the few times that golf courses play an interesting

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.920
 part in the future of physics. Now this might be entirely wrong. One of the great lines about golf

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.280
 courses is Steve Eyelit, the writer who once said the only proof of the existence of God is that once

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:57.280
 a year a golfer is electrocuted in a thunderstorm. Oh God I can feel James getting wound up as you're

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.560
 speaking. But think of all those golfers who don't get hit by lightning. I know how evil is the one

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:09.040
 who God decides must die. So what's this about golf? I'm really interested. What's golf? Well

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:15.200
 in fact actually I've realised there is a oh no there is another golf link to science which is

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:21.120
 Fred Hoyle's steady state theory was partly influenced by the Ealing horror film Portmanteau

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.760
 horror film Dead of Night but we can get back to that I think at another time. No let's let's go there

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.720
 and let's end this whole section on you finally explaining your facts going along. It's like the

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.120
 other day I was doing a show about reality and I suddenly realised that Alice Cooper connected

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.880
 everything that I was going to talk about and this is the trouble isn't it with tangential thinking.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.840
 But yeah Portmanteau horror film Dead of Night and I warn you there's a spoiler alert here so if

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.080
 you haven't seen it yet it did come out in 1945 but if you haven't seen it yet I'm going to give

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.160
 out something about it at the end. So it's about a man who visits a house and when he gets to the

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.880
 house he's like I'm sure I've been here before and everyone in the house has a different story

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.920
 including a terrifying story involving a ventriloquist possessed by his dummy or not we're not entirely

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.520
 sure played by Michael Redgrove and there's also a beautiful golfing story from the great

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.800
 Basil Radford and Norton Wayne two golfers who play golf to win over a woman's heart and it all

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:17.360
 goes horribly wrong but at the end of the film the man wakes up from his terrible nightmare and has

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:23.840
 to drive to the house which we then realise is the house where we began and he is in this cycle

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:30.320
 of reality and that led to Fred Hoyle thinking about now the theory of the universe this kind of

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:36.240
 cycle of size that we see so um to that I've suddenly realised is the other place golfing

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.960
 actually may have played a much bigger part in refuted physics of the 20th century so first

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.480
 of all I'd like to apologise I'm not normally on this show as everyone realises so I tell you the

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:50.160
 story now I'm sorry this is so yes so basically that's the thing Robin the problem with golf is

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:55.760
 there's links oh man I can't believe it's five minutes to a pun but when one like that comes out

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:01.120
 that is fantastic what a beautiful fantasy these two had practiced that for hours beforehand it's

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:08.560
 worth the build up I can't even remember what the golf link was so Joan Feynman woke up his

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.800
 young sister Joan and took her to the golf course because this was the darkest place to go because

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:19.200
 that night they could witness from just outside New York the Aurora Borealis and a deal was made

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:25.520
 and the deal was he could have the whole of the rest of the universe to investigate but Joan

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:30.560
 was allowed to have the Aurora Borealis and he could not go near it we should just explain who

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:36.080
 Richard Feynman was he was an extraordinary character in the world of science the Nobel prize

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:42.320
 winning physicist he was very much one of the fathers of quantum mechanics and as a child the

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:48.720
 stories that you have to read his autobiography and um genius by James Glyke it is just full of him

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:55.040
 just doing experiments including on his sitster and so he rigged up her cot so that it was sort of

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:59.840
 electrically generated so that it would go back and forth he paid her pocket money four cents to

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:06.000
 be sticking her finger in electrical sockets and sorry dad I think she was paid to press switches

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.280
 and she might have put her finger in the socket just for fun to kind of show off to his friends right

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:17.920
 I don't think he paid her well some reports from her are that he would occasionally say when his

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:22.240
 friends were around pop your finger in that so I think there's there's some wonderful interviews

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:26.560
 that she did with Christopher Sykes who was the maker of Pleasure of Finding Things Out the

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:32.080
 horizon documentary about Richard Feynman and she just talks about its play you know even in her 90s

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:36.880
 when someone would say what is science Joan she said it's play and it's something that gets missed

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:42.000
 out so much in a lot of the science education in the UK you know I'm sure all of us have the

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.880
 experience of working with scientists and we're asking the excitement when they see a new idea

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:51.680
 or they see a new snail shell it's filled with excitement and play and joy I like that it extends

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:56.000
 to going to the cinema and watching ealing horrors and you come out going oh I've just invented a

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.320
 model of how the universe functions I like how golf tells you a lot about physics as well okay I

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:04.240
 can I can now see that Dan's gonna go to the cinema and James is gonna go to the golf course both

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:09.280
 expecting to come back Nobel Prize winners and you're gonna be sorely disappointed so Richard

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:14.400
 Feynman was great at encouraging science communication right and this is obviously partly what

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:18.480
 inspired Joan and he even used to come into her room at night kind of annoying actually

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:22.000
 for instance she'd cry out for a glass of water in the middle of the night and he'd come to her

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.400
 bedroom and rather than give her the water he'd always swill it around in the glass apparently

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:31.760
 to demonstrate centrifugal forces which does sound annoying and also at one point it did fly out of

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:40.080
 his hand and smash against the wall so fun fun and dangerous Richard was very very supportive of her

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:45.680
 but the world wasn't when she was trying to do her dissertation one of the professors who was

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:49.680
 teaching her said why don't you write it on cobwebs because that's going to help when you're

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:54.080
 cleaning houses you mean sorry you mean why don't you write about cobwebs right not on as in sort of

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:59.760
 like trying in a tiny tiny pen yeah it turns out he was really supportive when he was trying to innovate

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:04.800
 and she actually wrote it in the end on the absorption of infrared radiation in crystals

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:11.440
 of diamond type lattice structure just kind of cobwebs infrared radiation it's not much

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:15.200
 I've got to be honest and I don't want to be the bad guy here but I would have been more likely to

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:20.960
 read the cobwebs one than the lattice structure one just small catchy isn't it I love a cobweb

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:25.520
 ironically that phd dissertation is now covered in cobwebs I didn't know he's never read it have

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:31.120
 but no she was brilliant yeah and the mother was quite progressive but still said to her

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:35.920
 oh women don't have the minds to do science you know that's how deep the belief was she was only

00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:40.480
 eight when her mum said women don't have the brains for science and she sort of sat in her chair

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:44.880
 sobbing incessantly which is quite impressive at eight no you want to be a scientist I think

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:48.400
 all I knew was I wanted to climb a tree yeah I think there's an interesting thing to learn from

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:53.760
 both the Feynman's here in terms of looking at progress Richard Feynman didn't get into his first

00:08:53.760 --> 00:09:00.080
 choice university because at that point in the 1930s there was a Jewish quota and that is an

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:05.760
 incredible thing to know I think and in the same way what Joan Feynman had to deal with was also

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:10.560
 the fact that women can't do this and we're not going to allow and sometimes even as a professional

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:15.440
 scientist there were rooms where she was told oh women aren't allowed to go up there and she had

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:19.840
 but she did keep on trying to get into the men's bathroom didn't she which but that was only because

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:24.480
 her brother kept coming into her bed yeah and she was only going into the men's bathroom show

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:28.160
 centrifugal force which of course made a right old mess but in a men's bathroom you can't really

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:32.480
 tell that much because they're always in such a state in the first place but I think the importance

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:37.440
 of role models it must not be forgotten because I think in science this is still going on it's getting

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:43.280
 better but we still need that going on all of the time because science is for everyone and it would

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:48.800
 be crazy not to realize that you know the excitement of curiosity is not limited by you know an x or

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:54.400
 a y chromosome yeah yeah I think she had an amazing psychiatrist actually because she went to a

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:58.960
 psychiatrist to say what shall I do whereas usually I guess you'd say have these antidepressants and

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:03.760
 maybe try some CBT the psychiatrist basically said why don't you apply to this earth observatory at

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:10.400
 Columbia University and that's what you need isn't it so great psychiatry is terrible rabbi

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:16.000
 because the rabbi said what right do you have to have these science jobs that are meant for men some

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.480
 of them haven't got a job so there we go there's a great the battle there some of them haven't got a

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:27.760
 job you've got to wait till all the men have a job and then you can start applying should we talk

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:32.640
 about what she discovered because it was pretty cool I mean she did hog quite a cool thing and

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:39.040
 hogging the auroras she essentially realized that it was these kind of charged particles that are

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:43.680
 flying out of the sun and when the sun's having a particularly turbulent time when there's a

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:47.760
 little bunch of storms on the surface of the sun then the northern lights get bigger and so she

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:52.880
 equated those two and thought one must be causing the other and I hadn't actually realized these

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:59.440
 cycles that the sun goes through it's got an 11 year cycle of high and low activity and that's

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:05.120
 caused by its magnetic poles switching around every 11 years which is very often given the earth

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:10.800
 it has been ages hasn't it since we did it but also it's got this 88 year cycle that's kind of

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:15.680
 running underneath that where the 11 year peaks and troughs kind of get higher and lower there is

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:20.480
 another cycle that I know of which is there's always a trough whenever I go to Iceland to see

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:25.200
 the northern lights which has been on two occasions and every single time they were like oh if you

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:29.440
 were here last week it was amazing see I think that that's a correlation causation issue I don't

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:34.720
 know if your presence is causing a difference you have to time it right because if they know that

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:39.040
 Joanna Lumley is going to be making one of her documentaries where she goes I've always been

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:44.560
 fascinated in the aurora borealis then the magnetosphere the solar winds go hold back

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:49.520
 Joanna Lumley is coming next week James is mainly doing audio based stuff it's really not important

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:55.680
 to get involved um do you know what the oldest depiction of the northern nights is we think

00:11:55.680 --> 00:12:01.600
 is it like on a cave painting well it is but it's specifically a macaroni

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:08.800
 a penguin snow no so this is a cave painting it's 30 000 years old which is very cool I'm

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:11.280
 not convinced it's the northern lights because you know when you look at cave paintings and it

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:15.840
 all looks like smears on a cave and then everyone goes well this is clearly a walrus and this is a

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:23.840
 aurora borealis but these are chromagnon cave paintings in France and it's a specific type

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:29.360
 of paleolithic finger tracings in clay which is called macaroni which I'd never heard of so the

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:33.360
 first northern nights is a macaroni but it is quite remarkable when you think you know that cave

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:37.520
 whether it's true or not and I think your right to probably be skeptical because there's so much

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:43.040
 new investigation in terms of what cave paintings mean but I do think you know that that moment of

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:47.520
 experiencing something like that I don't know if you ever went there with the tape modern

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:52.320
 about probably 15 years ago there was an artist who created this piece which was basically just the

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:58.080
 sun rising and what he wanted to create was something that had the impact of what it must

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:04.160
 have been like each morning to see this thing which you know was almost like a godlike experience

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:08.720
 and he did really create that I've got to say standing in that turbine hall the way that it

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:13.600
 connected to was just remarkable and when you talk about the aurora borealis I think you know

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:18.480
 I've never experienced it I'm I had the same as you in Iceland I think Paul O'Grady was going to

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:23.120
 be there the next week so the aurora borealis stayed off for me as well but that experience

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:30.160
 should really hit you in the gut every now and again to go that is up there what is going on

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:35.280
 how is it that a universe exists that creates these things that we have somehow evolved to find

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:40.240
 beautiful and fascinating and mesmeric yeah although I had exactly the same thing as you

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:43.600
 too in Norway so I'm starting to suspect the northern lights actually don't exist and it's a huge

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:56.240
 conspiracy okay it is time for fact number two and that is Anna my fact this week is that at the

00:13:56.240 --> 00:14:02.560
 turn of the 20th century women wore pedometers to balls to track how many miles they were dancing

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:07.840
 well miles a single ball that's a lot of dancing isn't it oh god they were dancing

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:14.000
 miles and miles well one dance was about a mile a mile and a half and this was all the rage women

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.280
 would strap pedometers to their knees or their feet and they'd go to a ball and there would be

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:24.080
 competitions over who would dance a furthest so you'd show your pedometer at the end of the night

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:29.520
 and I think the winner of one contestor was reading dance 25 miles in a night wow which

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:35.760
 that girl has not gone without a partner for the evening yeah with these those those dancers

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:40.480
 whereas a big group they were dancing together with a one-on-one with partners you know partner

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:45.680
 dancers at the balls yeah you're technically supposed to be going I think to find a husband

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:51.040
 back in the day it was a debutante era but one of the complaints about the pedometers in one of

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:55.360
 the newspaper articles I read is that it was distracting the women from seducing their husbands

00:14:55.360 --> 00:15:00.000
 because they were so into counting their number of steps and competing over that that they forgot

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.680
 to do their duty that's amazing did anyone sort of just quickly leave the venue and just go for a

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:10.880
 mad dash you know and just clock up the numbers and come back was there I don't I don't think a mad

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:14.640
 dash would help because dancing you're dancing almost as fast as you I mean you can't really

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:20.560
 run for 25 miles straight true have you just watched the marathon just watched the Olympic

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:26.880
 marathon that's just happened I just think it's much harder in heels and a corset it's probably

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:32.560
 easier to do a bit of jigging do you think that in the bathrooms when you went into the ladies

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:37.280
 bathroom everyone would just be kind of jiggling around to keep the pedometer going you know like

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:41.680
 if you really need the toilet you kind of do that little jiggly run on the spot don't you

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:46.080
 that's where that comes from actually yeah yeah what would be the best tap dancing I guess would be

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:52.560
 the most or like river dance yeah definitely you're wasting a lot of leg time in the air though

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:57.920
 with one of them legs well I think a ska music festival would work very well because you would

00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:04.480
 something like lip up fatty from the band bad manners there's a lot of movement as in which is

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:09.120
 kind of a walkie movement so I would say if you perhaps set up this experiment in a series of

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:13.520
 different butlins holiday camps across the south coast you would take various different genres I

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:18.720
 think northern soul would go well but northern soul as you said before the high kick element of

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:24.000
 that possibly means that you're not traveling as far as you imagine that the leg is going high but

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.440
 it's only traveling a you know a meter or so I think in terms of rave culture of the of the late

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:34.240
 80s early 90s so any of those come back that seems to be quite a stoical thing it's a mainly upper

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:38.480
 body stuff so I think there's a lot of research to be done here yeah yeah I'm sure Shakira could

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:43.360
 clock up some numbers with a bum shake I'm sure if it was attached to the thigh that would give

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:48.400
 vigorous well you're going to get a really accurate reading because our hips don't lie of course

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:54.880
 well this is do you remember the film that they shoot horses don't they which was it was about

00:16:54.880 --> 00:17:00.320
 marath this terrible thing that was done during the depression in America which was marathon dance

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:05.920
 competitions where you just danced and the winner would then get some money when everyone was desperate

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:11.680
 for money but they would go on for days and days people actually died dancing yeah I would imagine

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:15.440
 no one if they'd had a pedometer that would have already gone down to the pawnbroker so they wouldn't

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:18.960
 have had that on that because that was why they were there but it's just that fascinating thing

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:23.600
 where you know dance becomes torture and I think when you talk about 25 mars I mean that amount of

00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:30.800
 dancing I'm reckoning if we went for a walk that's what seven to eight hours of walking uh six

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:36.000
 six hours probably I walk fast because I have places to go and I believe life is finite but there's a

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:41.440
 lot of dawdlers and I would say between dawdlers and then kind of people like me I reckon it's about

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:48.160
 3.2 miles an hour so that's a lot yeah wow because Anna and I have been for a walk in the park every

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:53.040
 now and then just to kind of chat work and I must say that is probably the best workout I've had in

00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:58.560
 the last two years trying to keep up with Anna walking around a park it's ridiculous yeah it was

00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:05.280
 awkward when I realized you'd collapsed so are you one of those people like me which is I don't

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:10.000
 mind stopping and looking at things and I don't mind having a slow walk if there's things around but

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.480
 the dawdle is something which because you know there's a certain way that some people what where

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:21.680
 you go you have no ambition you know that there's a way that you just I am like you yes I judge someone's

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:26.480
 entire character a level of ambition based on their walk and then I'm furious with them and kind

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:31.280
 of want to push them in front of a car and they deserve it well the worst thing was you had to

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:37.280
 push me half a mile out of the park to get to the road I did yeah really went for it but yeah I would

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:42.080
 have been clocking up those those 25 miles and they said even at the time these women said that

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:46.160
 it was really addictive just like it is today whenever anyone has step counters because it made

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:51.600
 a little tick every time you stepped and so you couldn't resist making this tick happen and people

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:56.000
 were worried their mother said they're dancing too much it's dangerous and I think some of them

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.400
 maybe rigged it because there's this thing with pedometers about whether it's about steps or whether

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:05.600
 it's about distance and of course this would tell you how much distance you traveled but that was

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:10.160
 because you had to set it to your step length so I think you could set it to anywhere between 15

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:17.360
 and 41 inch step length so if as a cheating lady you said every step you step 41 inches then that's

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:21.680
 going to say you've traveled further isn't it wow so the modern day pedometers came after the

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:29.280
 Tokyo Olympics in the 1960s and there was a Japanese company called Yamatsa the Yamatsa company

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:33.680
 and they came up with this new kind of pedometer and they thought that everyone should walk 10,000

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:38.800
 steps a day and there's a lot of controversy whether that is just a completely random number

00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:43.600
 that they made up or whether there's actually any science to it whatsoever and there is a

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:49.120
 professor of epidemiology at Harvard called Aimin Lee and she reckons having spoken to the people

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:54.080
 who came up with the idea that they chose 10,000 because the Japanese character for 10,000 looks

00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:59.360
 a little bit like a man walking and they thought it would be a really good way of publicizing it

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:03.200
 but then there are other people who say well actually they did a bit of maths about it and

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:08.720
 worked out how many people would have less mortality due to more exercise and stuff so

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:14.960
 yeah pedometers are the subject of the longest movie ever made I discovered the longest movie

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:20.240
 ever now previously on fish we spoke about the longest movie ever made being called ambience

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:27.360
 which was 720 hours long the trailer itself was 72 minutes that has since been overtaken by a movie

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:36.880
 which is 857 hours long so this was made in 2008 by Erica Magnussen and Daniel Anderson

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:41.360
 and they wanted to look at where the pedometer came from so they had this idea of following the

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:47.920
 production cycle but in reverse chronological order so basically it's an 857 hour long movie

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:53.440
 backwards wow this this sounds actually I would almost rather read Joan Feynman's dissertation

00:20:53.440 --> 00:21:00.640
 than watch that that's amazing there's a lot of reviews on imdb you know as it starts off slow

00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:05.680
 says one person post three and a half days of runtime kind of boring but oh my god by the

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:10.960
 fourth through to the 25th days things really pick up so you know check it out what do we know

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:15.920
 what the point is was it some sort of artistic experiment was it a bet it's definitely an

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:19.680
 artistic experiment yeah they didn't just plan to make a feature length film and it got out of

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:25.840
 hand they just had so much material and a bad editor they can be dangerous can't they pedometers

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:32.160
 and Fitbits and stuff there was a a pig in northern england the Eta pedometer pood it out

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:38.640
 and it was in a bit of warm poo and hay and because it had a lithium ion battery it exploded

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:44.080
 and set fire to the entire farm there luckily no animals were hurt sounds so much like an

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:49.040
 insurance scam to me I'm sorry but you know when you go when you know when the farmers making up the

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:53.600
 story when they just had things haven't really worked out on my pig farm and you will not believe

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:58.720
 what happened right so I left the pedometer over there and he's always been 100 I would not pay out

00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:03.760
 on that one surely that's more likely to be true than I dropped it in the toilet or something for

00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:08.720
 your like it's it's who would make that no no but I'm not I'm not talking about the claiming

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:13.840
 insurance on the pedometer I'm talking about claiming insurance on the entire farm cause yeah

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:18.800
 you've got to get bigger ambition James yeah yeah you need an arsonist don't you but you can't say

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:23.200
 there was a crime committed because then the police get involved so if you say it was the pig then

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:28.560
 who's going to arrest a pig oh in France and I'm sure you've covered many pig trials on this show

00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:33.520
 still one of my one of the greatest films if people haven't seen the hour of the pig it's

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:38.640
 brilliant for it's all about a pig trial and was it is it a pedometer based crime no it's

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:44.160
 it's pre-pedometer and it starts off beautifully with a man and his donkey about to be hanged for

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:50.160
 some sexual shenanigans so there's a donkey with a noose around it and the man with a noose

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:54.720
 around it and this man running through and he's going stop stop stop and you see the man go

00:22:54.720 --> 00:23:01.040
 and he goes the donkey has been pardoned everyone in the town has said it is on good character

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:04.800
 and then you see the donkey's news taken off and the man dropped from the gallows

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:09.840
 I mean I'm definitely watching that and I think that's going to be the one takeaway from this podcast

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:11.840
 yeah

00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:22.160
 okay it is time for fact number three and that is James okay my fact this week is that

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:29.120
 Charles Darwin invented the office chair did he well did he that's a great question Anna did

00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:35.520
 yeah so that's my skepticism I'm gonna go on I'm gonna say that he invented the kind of

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:41.360
 wheelie office chair that you have and I'm saying that because his chair had wheels on and this is

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:46.880
 the first example we know of I was reading an article in the New York Times it was a review

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:53.440
 of a book called a taxonomy of office chairs by Jonathan Olivares and he talked about all the

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:58.880
 history of office chairs and he said that Charles Darwin had a customized wooden armchair in his

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:04.080
 home and he would wheel around his front room looking from specimen to specimen and then I

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:09.040
 went onto the welcome collections website and they have a photograph of this very chair so it

00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:14.480
 definitely did exist they have a photo of the interior of Charles Darwin's study which shows

00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:20.000
 that it's kind of just like an old armchair with just casters on the bottom of it okay but yeah

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:25.760
 the evolution of the chair started from there yeah the origin of this species of chair yes

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:30.960
 Robin I assume you've been to Darwin's house have you seen this chair no I haven't that's what I was

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:35.680
 thinking about I kind of flash back think have I seen that a downhouse and and I don't remember

00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:39.760
 seeing that but they don't let you have a go on the furniture so that's the thing is it depends how

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:44.000
 discreet it is you know and especially they would have all known I'm a big Starlight Express fan so

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.880
 of course that would have crashed yeah I mean I love the idea of that wheelchair going around his

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:52.800
 wonderful thought pathway he would go round and round and I think there's something rather

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:56.880
 attractive about that idea so what is that he used to walk around just to think of things

00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:00.480
 throughout the day he would have these moments when he would basically have some stones in his

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:04.960
 pocket and he would make a little pile of stones so he would know roughly how many times he'd walked

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:11.760
 round and it would just be to take himself into somewhere else to just mull over whatever he'd

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:16.080
 recently found out about a pigeon skeleton or whatever else had been boiled down but I mean

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:20.400
 going back to what we talked about with Joan Feynman as well that curiosity and that play

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:23.840
 yeah now I want to go and have a look at this particular crab that's over there and now I'll

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:28.560
 look at this barnacle over there and that lovely thing when he would go to London Zoo and and he

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:33.440
 would look at some of the viper snakes and he would see if he could stop himself from reacting

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:38.160
 so obviously the snake can't get to him and he would just stand and just look at the snake wait

00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:42.960
 for it to strike and they are I still react you know and that that's just plain people would have

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:47.200
 walked past them and who's the guy over there with the big sideboards who's looks like he's goading

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:52.800
 snakes but I've just recently been to London Zoo and my experience is very different that the

00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:57.920
 snakes just kind of hide and you spend half your time going is that a twig or is it a snake I'm

00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:02.240
 not sure they didn't do much of the attacking when I was there although I did that's that's that's

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:07.840
 the fun thing isn't it of I mean Edinburgh Zoo I think used to be the zoo that had the most hiding

00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:14.800
 animals to the point where you began to think this is predominantly hay but I love that reptile

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:20.560
 house is such a delight I think because you see that you know the old structure of the zoo there

00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:23.440
 I absolutely love looking at the snakes I don't know I'm starting to think the zoos might be

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:29.120
 in other northern lights they're just a huge con only when Joanna Lumley goes so the snakes emerge

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:36.240
 but yeah he was from like a super early age crazily curious wasn't he and not a very good

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:40.000
 student so I hadn't realized that Darwin's dad thought he was a bit useless said that you know

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.560
 this boy will never concentrate on anything but he just was obsessed with collecting stuff

00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:50.000
 there was one story where he found two unusual looking beetles that he thought were new species

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.960
 and then he found the third one and so he put one of the two in his mouth so he could carry the third

00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:59.840
 one home as well I don't know why he couldn't just carry two beetles in one hand but he put it in his

00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:04.240
 mouth and he accidentally bit down on it or it squirted some disgusting poison into his mouth

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:09.760
 so sadly lost his beetles on that occasion wow always collecting it's like with his his barnacles

00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:15.200
 which is Steve Jones who's a wonderful writer I'm sure you know and he is a great expert on

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:19.120
 Darwin and I once said to him are there any books by Darwin that I shouldn't read and he said don't

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:25.280
 bother with these books about barnacles he became overly obsessed so there's a story of I forget which

00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:32.960
 son it was who was so used to seeing Charles just looking at barnacles all the time and they were

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:37.440
 being delivered from around the world people sending specimens barnacles to him that when he

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:42.160
 went around to a friend's house he started running around all the rooms and became increasingly

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:47.040
 confused and rather upset because he couldn't find the room where his friend's father did his

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:52.720
 barnacles and that was when it had to be explained that not all parents spend most of their time

00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:58.400
 examining barnacles I think that's you know there's a all father doing barnacles don't I know I was

00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:04.320
 reading about what happened when his son William was born he just started measuring everything

00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:09.360
 the sneezing the hiccuping the yawning the stretching right but the papers are amazing

00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:14.640
 because they really read like a very proud father who kind of thinks that his children are so advanced

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:21.920
 he's like um of course sucking and screaming were well performed by my infant he wrote at one stage

00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:26.400
 and then he said I touched the naked stole of his foot with a bit of paper and he jerked it away

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:31.520
 much like an older child would do when tickled oh no he's one of the parents at the school gate

00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:36.880
 my child's two good children I used to work in a children's bookshop where you would always get

00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:43.200
 people coming in and going uh my um son is four but he has a reading age of 10 and of course you

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:47.200
 would show them a book for a 10 year old go well I don't think he'll quite be able to manage that

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:51.680
 and then eventually when you sold them a book for a two year old uh but you know but that was

00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:57.120
 we're often told that Victorian parents were quite detached from their children I think it's

00:28:57.120 --> 00:29:02.640
 kind of quite a myth and you would see that the relationship that Charles and Emma Darwin had

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:09.440
 with their children was incredible closeness there's so many beautiful letters between Emma and Charles

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:13.840
 which are filled with love and which entirely disintegrate some of the illusions that we have

00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:20.240
 about Victorian behavior right wow um he had a really cool uncle who sadly died quite young who

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:24.640
 looked like he might have made a lot of innovations in the medical world and he was called Charles

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:30.720
 Darwin as well and Charles Darwin the one we're talking about was fascinated by him even visiting

00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:35.760
 the university where he worked at to meet his professors to say hi because he never met him

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:42.160
 he died before Charles was born but when he was young he had a stammer and there was a theory

00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:47.840
 that his father had that if he taught his son French he would get rid of the stammer so he was

00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:53.040
 packed off to Paris where he learned and studied under a reverend who taught him to speak French

00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:58.560
 fluently and it got rid of his stammer but only in French so he always had a stammer in English

00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:02.880
 but never in French it's quite weird to picture Darwin's trip on the beagle right because that

00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:07.360
 was just one huge massacre and for someone who was kind of too squeamish to be a doctor when he

00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:11.680
 was training to be a doctor he once ran from the room because someone was being operated on

00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:17.360
 but he did love shooting and like we'll just go around like bashing things on the head strangling

00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:23.600
 them you know poisoning them and eating them all for science all for science and a bit for fun

00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:30.160
 one of the things he did was he ate lots of tortoises which we've probably mentioned before

00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:35.600
 and this was one of the things that tipped him off to evolution he ate a tortoise on one island

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:39.520
 and then he ate what seemed to be the same tortoise on another island really close by

00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:43.600
 and it tasted a bit sweeter and this is one of the things he recorded he was like why is the

00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:48.000
 tortoise on this island sweeter than the tortoise on this island how have they diverged you know

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.960
 why would God do this make these tiny little differences so close together but wait a minute

00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:58.000
 how come everything has evolved to taste like chicken then he didn't actually didn't address that

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:02.160
 there's a line that i've often repeated in fact the most recent book i wrote originally this is

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:05.680
 what i wanted to call it because it's something that i love which is when he talks about being around

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:10.800
 the rainforest and he says one's eyes attempt to follow the flight of a gaudy butterfly but

00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:16.480
 is soon distracted by some strange tree or fruit today my mind was a chaos of delight

00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:20.480
 and i think that's the thing chaos of delight which is a phrase i've used many many times

00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:27.280
 is such a good way of explaining what the truly curious are always being attracted to yeah well

00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:32.560
 and also as well as delighting in your discoveries getting so angry when things go wrong you know

00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:37.600
 just being passionate generally like one of my favorite letters i read of darwin's recently

00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:43.680
 was when he'd been looking into bees that pollinate red clover some had a long proboscis some had a

00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:48.000
 short one and they got nectar in different ways quite a niche discovery he thought he'd made

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:53.360
 he told his friend john lubeck said i'm really excited about this and then he wrote a follow-up

00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:57.680
 saying he'd realized that he was wrong and he said i do hope you haven't wasted any time for

00:31:57.680 --> 00:32:06.720
 my stupid blunder i hate myself i hate clover and i hate bees and that's yeah speaking of finding

00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:12.960
 beauty in the banal what about office chairs we quickly talk about those maybe

00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:21.360
 chairs are killing us chairs are killing us what because chair sitting puts 30 more pressure

00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:27.760
 on your spinal discs than standing up varicose veins only exist in cultures that do lots of chair

00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:32.880
 sitting if you sit down for long periods it means your muscles and your legs don't fire which means

00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:38.160
 your pancreas doesn't get the message to produce lipase which is the enzyme that you need in your

00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:45.520
 liver to digest fat and there is an amazing person called professor galen cramps who says basically

00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:51.760
 we all need to stop sitting down too much because it's killing us and i spoke to professor cramps

00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:58.160
 this morning and she was basically telling me that there's loads of massive studies with epidemiologists

00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:04.160
 looking at really really really massive data sets and they have found correlation with premature

00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:10.880
 mortality and sitting down which is greater than the correlation for being old being fat or being a

00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:19.280
 smoker so sitting down according to some studies is more dangerous than that and for that reason

00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:25.040
 professor cramps doesn't have any chairs in her house i read this in an article she's a terrible

00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:30.240
 host doesn't she if you go around yeah okay in fairness she has a couple for when guests come

00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:35.520
 round she did say i read this in an article from new scientists about 20 years ago and i emailed

00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:41.040
 professor cramps says is it still true that you don't have any chairs in your house and she says

00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:47.680
 yeah she's continued that experiment for over 20 years and she perches at the kitchen island when

00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:52.000
 she wants to eat she thinks that perching is a good way it's like half sitting and half standing

00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:56.080
 whenever she's doing any work on her computer she always uses a she's long

00:33:56.080 --> 00:34:02.400
 even as a guest if she did put the two chairs out you'd feel so judged sitting in them wouldn't you

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:08.320
 wouldn't risk it but yeah like so there's obviously a lot of chat about how sitting's

00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:14.320
 bad for you now and standing desk which i have are useful and i also try squatting because i think

00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:18.400
 about a quarter of people when they're at rest or when they're at work they will adopt a squat

00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:22.560
 rather than a seat so a quarter of people in the world that's around the world yeah absolutely

00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:28.320
 sorry not in the office but i've tried squatting and you can't do it for long or i can't

00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:33.600
 i always try working in a squat at a low table and i think once you've had 30 years of not doing it

00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:37.840
 it's pretty hard to get back isn't it well yeah that is the problem actually it's like all these

00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:43.040
 things about not sitting down really once you've been sitting down for 30 years doing anything

00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:47.440
 else can put a lot of pressure on your body and give you pain and discomfort but we know that in

00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:52.320
 history people have squatted more than they've sat and not least because we haven't found many

00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:59.840
 chairs from history but also because when you squat down the end of your shin bone kind of presses

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:04.800
 into a little bone on your ankle and it gets a little indentation and we can see by lots of old

00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:09.200
 skeletons that that's how people must have spent a lot of their time so we know that in history

00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:15.200
 squatting has been the standard way of resting okay you know one thing i really loved about this fact

00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:20.800
 was such a seminal character is the person who we have the oldest example of a of an office chair

00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:27.040
 from but also a bit further back in history the oldest example that we have of the swivel chair

00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:32.480
 is from thomas jefferson the story goes is that he wrote up the declaration of independence while

00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:37.440
 sitting on this swivel chair because it has a little table that is attached to it and a revolutionary

00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:45.040
 chair very nice he also had a pedometer thomas jefferson yeah the earliest ones we know about

00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:50.960
 yeah he had it made by an expert watchmaker in paris and he even sent one to one of the

00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:56.720
 early presidents i think it was madison maybe yeah but he gave his swivel chair to martha

00:35:56.720 --> 00:36:01.840
 didn't he his daughter and she said that she thinks he did indeed write the declaration of

00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:07.200
 independence on it and his opponents took the piss out of him for his stupid chairs and called them

00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:13.120
 whirligigs and said you know they look at thomas and his stupid whirligig that allows him to look

00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:18.400
 in all directions at once isn't he and moron they didn't say that that's my addition

00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:30.640
 okay it is time for our final fact of the show and that is my fact my fact this week is that horror

00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:39.200
 movies often have two soundtracks one you can hear and one you can't oh well i know that sounds

00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:47.840
 spooky but it is literally for spooky reasons so this is the idea of infrasound and infrasound is

00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:55.120
 any frequency that is sort of 19 hertz below so humans can hear 20 hertz and above as soon as you

00:36:55.120 --> 00:37:01.120
 get lower it becomes out of earshot but your body can sort of feel the sensation of the sound if

00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:06.160
 there's a big sound system in the room you can give you a sense of sort of oh what's going on here

00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:10.720
 you know it it can give you the shivers do you know any examples of movies that have done this

00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:17.680
 like sound of music presumably not but well it's mainly the examples that they give are for thriller

00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:23.360
 slash horror movies so irreversible was said to have used it and paranormal activity is rumored

00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:30.240
 to have used it as well they sometimes are sounds that are like i don't know a fan going or an air

00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:35.280
 conditioner but they play with the bass as such that it creates an eerie noise i did read the air

00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:40.240
 conditioning can achieve this effect which maybe explains why being in the office is such a scary

00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:47.200
 experience peacocks can do it if a peacock kind of wiggles its tail it makes this really really

00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:52.320
 deep sound that humans can't hear but if you were able to hear it it'd be about as loud as a car

00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:57.680
 driving past you and they do it to kind of signal to each other but yeah i guess if you walk past

00:37:57.680 --> 00:38:02.480
 a peacock you might feel a bit uneasy does that happen you feel like a lot of eyes are watching

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:08.960
 you well that's the famous darwin line the sight of the feathers in a peacock tail make me sick

00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:16.880
 really yeah he felt that the that expenditure felt like such a waste for the nature of survival

00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:21.760
 but you have to have that huge expenditure and and it's such a lovely line because it feels like

00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:27.600
 a very modern line you don't expect to suddenly find that in in darwin no as a horror movie fan

00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:32.240
 i'm not keen on this idea because i'm a big fan of atmospheric horror films which really get

00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:36.640
 under your skin in fact brilliantly you mentioned sound and music isn't it amazing how quickly

00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:41.520
 you can create some kind of sense of synchronicity in any of these programs yeah you know i think it

00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:46.000
 was it was it uh it was robert wise i think he directed sound and music and he also directed

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:52.640
 the haunting and that is one of those films where so much of the unsettling nature of it is not that

00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:59.680
 you ever see a ghost but you hear noises there's a sense that there is something wrong with the house

00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:04.160
 yeah well it's whenever i watch horror films i was watching horror film on my own recently

00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:08.400
 actually and the way to find it not scary is absolutely not to close your eyes it's to just

00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:13.840
 cover up your ears and immediately a horror film will become completely innocuous it's so weird i

00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:20.160
 think it's more about the sound hitchcock said that 33 percent of the effect of psycho was entirely

00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:25.040
 due to the music yeah they did do test audiences with the movie where in the shower scene there was

00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:29.440
 no music originally and it just didn't have the impact and then they put the music on and suddenly

00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:33.760
 the scariest scene in cinema to that point yeah that's really interesting what was the horror

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:40.880
 film you were watching by the way uh it was called his house my house her house it's fantastic it's

00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:45.440
 really good yeah his house if yeah anyone listen to this if you've not seen it i think it was nominated

00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:50.320
 for about the very deservedly i was just watching it at home and i was like i hope it stops being

00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:54.960
 scary because i want to go to the loo and i'm not sure i can risk going down these stairs now because

00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:59.040
 the changing understanding of the narrative in it and that's why i find that kind of use of

00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:04.000
 infrasound to me that feels like a very hollywood thing which is going oh we can do this thing instead

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:08.400
 no do you know what film something brilliantly yeah but then do you want to get rid of soundtracks

00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:12.400
 altogether then for that reason as well no i love i love soundtracks because i think when

00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:17.840
 they're well used when you get uh i mean like i rewatch dawn of the dead which it has a really

00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:25.280
 upbeat and you go this is far too upbeat for the number of guts that are being eaten but

00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:30.480
 it works by being this meeting of two very different worlds but that marriage reminds

00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:37.200
 me of tubular bells to me it is terrifying and that's not a frightening tune that's just because

00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:42.160
 it was in the exorcist and that's actually quite a plinky plonky you know the tune the terrifying

00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:49.280
 bit from the exorcist like it's quite hard to hum um but yeah it's marrying that slightly chirpy

00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:54.000
 with the terrifying do you think we're going to get sued do you think um michael field's gonna

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:58.720
 come in he's coming for us yeah after anna sang that thank god his daughter used to work for qi so

00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:04.640
 that she's she's been on fish chat to her she has molly back in the day i love that way though

00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:10.480
 how can we get away with uh playing a tune and not having to pay copyright by not really remembering

00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:20.000
 it very well you can't play it you know it's that michael field um just on um horror films in their

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:26.000
 soundtracks i didn't know that instruments have specifically been built for horror movies so in

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:32.000
 harmonic instruments basically instruments that do the opposite of what good instruments do and

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:37.200
 they create notes that don't go together very naturally when you sort of all my instruments

00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:44.160
 do that oh yeah yeah no there are many reasons why you might make in harmonic sounds but the most

00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:49.760
 famous in harmonic instrument is probably the waterphone and so it's like a bowl and it's got

00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:54.080
 like bronze rods that stick up out of the edges of the bowl and they're all different lengths

00:41:54.080 --> 00:42:00.560
 and like diameters and stuff and you get a violin bow or something maybe to tap it and you bow the

00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:05.360
 rods and they just make a very non-harmonic sound and it's used in lots of films it's used

00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:11.680
 in poltergeist let the right one in aliens but what i like about it as well is that the waterphone

00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:16.000
 involves a little bit of water in the bowl which is why it's called that it was invented by richard

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:23.280
 waters and used in the horror film dark water amazing oh wow three totally unrelated waters in one

00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:29.200
 fact that's so cool the other thing's the tritone kind of two notes that one comes after the other

00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:33.280
 and it kind of makes you feel uneasy because you think that should be something next it's in the

00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:38.720
 theme to the simpsons so you know when it goes the simpsons it's kind of you think well where are

00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:43.360
 you going after that it's weird it's just kind of a weird kind of two notes coming after each other

00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:47.360
 is that the one banned in churches james or is that a different one well that's the one that the

00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:52.400
 internet says was banned in churches for sure whether it was actually banned i personally don't

00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:57.760
 think so but definitely western musicians really shied away from it for hundreds and hundreds

00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:02.560
 of years because they thought it was slightly demonic it is objectively spooky because i've

00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:06.560
 never thought about it before but the theme tune to the simpsons which is not a spooky show except

00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:12.240
 for the halloween specials is kind of scary regardless of content i don't know why they did

00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:19.200
 that weird danny elfman of oingo boingo which is still one of the greatest names for a band really

00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:24.240
 yeah so funny doesn't he sing he sings that bit of the simpsons doesn't he and as a result the

00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:28.800
 royalties that he's received ever since uh so far greater than any other work that he's done

00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:33.200
 basically did i sing it close enough to the actual theme tune that i'm gonna have to send him a tenor

00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:38.480
 in the post yeah dammit like yeah i remember doing a thing with i've forgotten her name who's

00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:45.120
 who's the voice of uh bart nancy nancy cartwright yeah i remember doing a radio show with her and

00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:48.560
 there was someone in the audience who had a birthday like a little child and they said oh can you

00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:55.040
 say happy birthday as as bart simpsons she went no i can't for copyright reasons really wow really

00:43:55.040 --> 00:44:00.080
 weird thing that's what would and i tell you guys about the most recent um horror movie i watched

00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:07.600
 perhaps we're doing that um it was called slacks have you heard of this s la xx can you guess what

00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:12.800
 the murderer is in this case i'll give you a clue it's a non-human is it a pair of it's a pair of

00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:19.440
 shoes it's not oh it's not a pair of slacks it's a pair of slacks but that's not what slacks are

00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:27.040
 for many oh god there's trousers on there it's about a killer pair of jeans uh and i was just

00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:31.200
 googling about it see if there's anything interesting about it and it comes up on a lot of lists of

00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:40.240
 horror movies where the antagonist is a non-human or non-animal so there was one in 2001 called the

00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:48.960
 shaft can you guess what the killer was there yes a um elevator shaft but why is the shaft itself

00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:53.760
 the killer well it was originally called the lift but it got remade in america they called

00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:59.680
 it the shaft and also they were going to call it just down uh and the tagline for that movie reads

00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:06.880
 take the stairs for god's sake take the stairs sounds amazing anyone going to see it imagining

00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:12.720
 it's a remake of the film shaft they'll find themselves very confused i hope isek hay still

00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:18.720
 did the music of the wires yeah that'd be amazing has anyone seen the movie this is relatively famous

00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:23.600
 called rubber is that a tire that goes through the desert and goes yeah yeah yeah that's a great

00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:29.440
 idea yeah it's about a sentient tire that goes around and it has psychokinesis we never learned

00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:34.640
 why it has psychokinesis but it could just look at you and start vibrating and then it explodes you

00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:39.760
 uh and there was the final one which was a korean movie i think and it's called the red shoes can you

00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:46.240
 guess what the killer is there oh it is is this a trick is it purple Dorothy it's a pair of purple

00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:52.000
 shoes literally no idea why they call it the red shoes but this woman finds a pair of purple high

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:58.800
 heels uh and then jealousy greed and death follows her wherever she walks in them right but the

00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:04.640
 original red shoes based on the kind of folktale which is a pal and press burger film is a very

00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:11.040
 haunting piece of work Robert Heltman famously the the child catcher who for many of my generation

00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:16.080
 is one of the scariest characters in chit chit bang bang you know come come and get your sweeties

00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:21.040
 children come and get your sweeties and there's a lovely story of when a friend of Robert Heltman

00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:25.840
 took his kids to go and see chit chit bang bang and uh then he he rang up Robert Heltman he said

00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:31.200
 Robert i've got a bit of a problem you're coming around for sunday lunch and uh well my kids i've

00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:35.760
 just taken chit chit bang bang and they were absolutely terrified of you and he went oh yes

00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:40.160
 he said well could you say something to them over the phone now just so that they know you're an actor

00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:43.520
 and that you're not really the child's catcher you went of course just bring the children to the

00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:46.880
 phone and when the children got to the phone you went i'm coming to catch you chit chit bang
