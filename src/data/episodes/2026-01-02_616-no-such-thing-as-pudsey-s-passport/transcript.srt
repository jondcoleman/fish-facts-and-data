 Hi everyone, welcome to this episode of Notice Things A Fish, which we recorded live at the Royal

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:15,200
 Institution in London. The venerable, venerable place where so many great scientists have been

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:20,960
 over the years and now us. Although there was a great scientist there with us, we had a guest and

5
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:26,320
 that was Professor Alice Roberts. Now if you follow science in Britain, if you follow science

6
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:32,000
 communication, if you follow science on TV, you'll know all about Alice Roberts as she's absolutely

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,880
 brilliant. We had such a good time doing the show with her and she does have a new book out,

8
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:42,240
 actually. It's called Domination and it is all about the fall of the Roman Empire and the growth

9
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:47,440
 of Christianity, absolutely brilliant book, as all of Alice's books are. And if you want to learn

10
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:54,320
 more about her, then you can go to Alice-Hyphen-robots.co.uk and everything about her will be there.

11
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,200
 I should just quickly add that we do have a special secret members club called Club Fish where

12
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:04,560
 there's lots of extra stuff. If you feel like you haven't got your fix of fish at the moment,

13
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:10,000
 loads of extra stuff on tears there. There's an excel version of this show and every show,

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,720
 if you think that I do a terrible job editing the show and I need to be making it much, much

15
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:20,080
 longer than there is the place to go for that. But yeah, there's loads of stuff there. So go to

16
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:25,920
 patreon.com/nosusexafish if you would like to join. But really hope you enjoy this. We had such a great

17
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,200
 time at the Royal Institution. I can't tell you how exciting it was to be there. I think it does come

18
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,800
 through in the show itself. Anyway, happy new year and on with the podcast!

19
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:59,840
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast this week coming

20
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:12,160
 to you live from the Royal Institution. My name is Dan Schreiber. I am sitting here with James

21
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:19,200
 Tarkin, Andrew Huntamari and Professor Alice Roberts. And once again, we have gathered around the

22
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:25,040
 microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in a particular order,

23
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:31,760
 here we go, starting with fact number one and that is James. Okay, my fact this week is that the first

24
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:41,680
 person to travel into the stratosphere did so with a pillow on his head. So for people at home who

25
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:48,960
 can't see the image, this is two gentlemen and they have like a basket, a wicker basket and underneath

26
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:57,120
 is the pillow and this was a trip by Auguste Picard and he wanted to work out some things about Cosmic

27
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:03,200
 Rays which he might go into later but they Germans were he was setting off from didn't want him to go

28
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:08,240
 up there. They tried to ban his assent but he was Swiss so he managed to get someone in Switzerland to

29
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:13,440
 say no you're allowed to do it. But the Germans wouldn't have it and they said well okay you can go

30
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:19,120
 up but you must wear helmets. They didn't have any helmets to hand so they cobbled some together.

31
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:27,920
 And it's important to wear a helmet completely but also he was going eight or nine miles

32
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,920
 up and if it didn't work out a helmet is not going to be the thing that does or doesn't make the

33
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,640
 difference. No, I would think no. Again if there are any astronauts listening to keep your helmet on

34
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:42,080
 yeah take my word for it you know. It's not like he wasn't wearing a helmet with like an oxygen

35
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,280
 mask in there or anything like that right. It was literally just to cover his bones. Yeah. Did he

36
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:53,280
 have a parachute? I do not think they did. Oh no. That would be more useful. Yeah no absolutely. When

37
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,880
 did we invent the parachute? Was it invented in 1931? The guy who invented the modern parachute

38
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:05,120
 because like Leonardo da Vinci had pictures of parachutes in his in his drawings right. Yeah. But the

39
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:13,200
 modern parachute was invented in 1913 by a guy called Everad Calthrop and he offered it to the royal

40
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:18,320
 flying car because this was during the or was it during the war just before the war. So in 1915

41
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:25,600
 he offered it to the flying car and they said they didn't want to give them to the pilots because

42
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,720
 it might impair the fighting spirit of the pilots. I think right. And they thought if they've got

43
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:37,280
 parachutes then they'll just jump out. Yes. Yes. I always say if I'm going to be a racer just get rid

44
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:44,000
 of the brakes. I will only encourage me to slow down my motor car. Do you know this has to be the

45
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,520
 most accident Mr. Bean prone experiment I think I've ever read about. It's remarkable isn't it? It

46
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:55,200
 is. Have you ever heard about this trip? This first trip to the stratosphere else with August Picard?

47
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:59,280
 No. What happened? Well basically we'll get into what they were kind of trying to do which is

48
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,680
 were they were trying to help Albert Einstein prove the theory of relativity and they thought we

49
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:09,600
 can do that by heading up to the highest spot on earth. So Picard who everyone if you want a picture

50
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,320
 what he's looking what he looks like at home picture professor calculus from the Tin Tin books because

51
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:20,960
 because that's who it was based on. Yeah. Calculus was based on August Picard. He was this

52
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:27,360
 eccentric but brilliant scientist and he's actually taller than calculuses in the Tin Tin

53
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,240
 books. He's six foot six and Hershey had to make him smaller so he'd fit in the frames. Come on.

54
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:41,200
 Yeah. That's just drawn him further away. Yeah. He's wonderful. Yeah. Picard. I just everything about him

55
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:45,920
 sounds sort of wonderful. He never went anywhere without a slide rule and two wristwatches.

56
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:53,200
 He decorated his home with prisms so he would be great to watch his. What one for what I don't need to

57
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:59,200
 you know I mean one for what you know one for the time here and one for the time up up there.

58
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:04,400
 You know what the reason I asked you is because I knew the answer and I thought you might do as well

59
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,960
 no absolutely no but the reason he did is because he knew that if they didn't match then at least one

60
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:18,640
 of them was wrong. Clever. Very clever. Clever. But this trip they made up they didn't a couple of

61
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:24,560
 people had tried to get into the stratosphere before I think in planes and how high did you have to go?

62
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:30,960
 I think it's about it's at least seven and a half miles so the air is pretty thin and pretty cold

63
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:37,040
 and a couple of people had tried in planes and not done terribly well. Picard's innovation was a sealed

64
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:43,440
 what do you call the sealed gondola with walls of aluminium that were I think three and a half

65
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:50,800
 millimeters thick so it's quite fragile this thing carrying them up and above him and his assistant

66
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:59,280
 Kipfer Paul Kipfer I believe a huge balloon filled with hydrogen and that expands and it carries him

67
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,920
 up and it expands in the light of the sun and it carried them up and up and up and up and up and up

68
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:09,440
 and as you said Dan one thing off from the start of going wrong well with nightmare. But even before

69
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,240
 the mission started it started going wrong so Kipfer said he knew that the whole thing had got off

70
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,400
 to a rough start when they were doing their final checks and he looked out the window and he saw

71
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,200
 chimneys passing them from the top of houses. Oh yeah yeah yeah they're like oh so we've left like

72
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:29,440
 they just didn't even know they had no idea that they'd taken off so immediately that was an issue

73
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,640
 yep and they had this sort of half an hour crisis of there was a hole in the side of the gondola

74
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:40,480
 which had to be pasted shut and they were very ingenious in the way they did it. Oh yeah the other

75
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:44,880
 thing it might get extremely hot up there because you've got less you know protection against the

76
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:50,880
 sun's rays so they had this little propeller on the side of the gondola their capsule so what that

77
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,720
 meant was one side of the capsule was painted white and one was painted black and they thought well

78
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,520
 look if we can turn it if we can turn the the white side towards the sun that'll reflect the

79
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:06,240
 sun's light keep us nice and cool ever and if and that's ingenious unfortunately the propeller broke

80
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:12,640
 and so they were then unable to control the temperature it got up to 40 degrees celsius in

81
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:18,320
 there 104 Fahrenheit the water evaporated they had to lick the walls for moisture oh it's just a

82
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:22,160
 matter how long were they out there they were for hours and the problem was they could all day yeah

83
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,640
 they couldn't come down because the machine that was going to allow them to come down froze so

84
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:31,440
 they could they were like well we're just here now and we just have to wait for it to take us back down

85
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:38,000
 nightfall yeah when the sun goes down hydrogen cools and shrinks and allows them to descend yeah meanwhile

86
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,120
 the balloon no they didn't bother they had a way of getting to the balloon no they couldn't because

87
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:48,160
 they were closed inside meanwhile the barometer explodes the mercury within it falls to the ground

88
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:53,280
 and because the material is made of this metal it starts eating the actual thing that they're

89
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:59,120
 in on the floor I mean can you imagine you're in this just two of you one six foot six looks like

90
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:07,680
 professor calculus doesn't know what time it is okay the um they press said that they died didn't

91
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,080
 they yeah they've been up for so long they were expected to come back quicker than that so in the

92
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,880
 newspapers that afternoon they said yeah they've gone that's it so like I've never been in a hot

93
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:21,040
 air balloon I think you have have you done that before I haven't been up a couple of times in a

94
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:28,480
 hot air balloon is it petrifying uh it's really lovely until you land why do I love it I mean I

95
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,360
 love that kind of taking off and it's so quiet when you're out and you just hear dogs barking see that's

96
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,880
 what I find scary yeah it's her priority because if you're the way you might go in the air like in a

97
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,200
 plane or a helicopter it's noisy as hell isn't it it's just so peaceful but the thing is you just

98
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,920
 can't steer them can you you go where the wind takes you yeah you're kind of you just relying on

99
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,240
 that and then trying to find somewhere to land that doesn't involve a lot of cows usually right why

100
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,800
 were you why were you doing it by the way for the show was that like a BBC budget thing or were you

101
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:03,920
 now I don't think I'm done it for television oh you know I think I've just done it for fun right okay

102
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:09,280
 there was fun until we landed okay doesn't the thing of the BBC budget that says we haven't

103
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:14,400
 spent all of this years money yet get robots in a hot air balloon now do you know there was there

104
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:19,520
 wasn't experiment that we tried to do years and years ago when I did coast back in 2005 when

105
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,720
 they were trying to work out how many weather balloons they'd have to attach to me to lift me off

106
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,840
 the ground and then it became obvious that actually it was too windy to do it and I was likely to be

107
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:33,120
 kind of dragged off this key which we would it it was honestly the whole thing and this is picture

108
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,720
 of me standing there looking utterly terrified and I think I've got about 14 weather balloons

109
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,120
 attached to me and I'm just my toes just starting to lift off but we never actually at that point

110
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:47,280
 you went no no I think actually this is a bad I would you got scared at 14 balloons being attached how

111
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:55,120
 would they how would they've got you back down well this is the question so when they put these

112
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:02,240
 14 on did you start to feel a little bit way yeah definitely yeah yeah yeah they landed Picard and

113
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,560
 Kipfer they landed on a glacier and they weren't out of the woods even when they landed you know

114
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:11,680
 and they had to have yes they were they were I'm like like yeah sorry yeah the tree line the love of

115
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:17,440
 the tree line yeah but they had they had to I think hike down the glacier I was just this was 1931

116
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,840
 we should say did they get the data though sorry they were up there to get some data they got the data

117
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:26,400
 I think they did get the data they were studying cosmic rays because they were trying to support

118
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:31,280
 Einstein's theories of relativity I think they did I think but by accident because they largely

119
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:36,960
 were just trying to survive because from the get go they should have died and they they didn't like

120
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:42,560
 the mercury there was a statement Picard just said out loud he was like if only I had a vacuum

121
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:47,520
 cleaner and they realized that the whole of the of the actual ship if we can call it though the

122
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:53,200
 gondola he called it was there was a hole in it where they opened it and acted like a vacuum and

123
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:58,400
 sucked all the mercury out and then they stuffed some clothing to it and then it's like it's gene

124
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:03,280
 Apollo 13 it's the original Apollo 13 basically yeah it is yeah yeah it sounds like there were a lot

125
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:06,640
 of risks that they haven't thought I would have liked to see the risk assessment it sounds like

126
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,520
 there's a lot of things they haven't thought about but they had thought about the possibility of

127
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:13,600
 things falling on their head I know while all this has happened they're like and we've got these

128
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:22,000
 baskets on our head what we found dead looking like idiots this is so in their vein of like

129
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,480
 thing you know risk assessments and and thinking about what you might need to go up into the

130
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,240
 stratosphere you would have thought that there need to be you know there needs to be a better set of

131
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,400
 instructions for getting in that thing and going up there and you know not smashing your mercury

132
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:40,080
 and that kind of thing yeah not making holes in the vessel that you're in so I had to look at some

133
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:48,160
 safety instructions for various more everyday items and these are some real bits of safety advice

134
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:57,600
 so one is on a buggy where it says remove child before folding these are real there's one on a

135
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:05,440
 hairdryer that said do not use all sleeping on items of clothing do not iron clothes whilst wearing

136
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:14,400
 them now oh that's because everybody pointing it down yeah so what you do done it

137
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:23,680
 all the time I'll notice a crease and I will just lay down on the bit of the iron board and I'll

138
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,160
 just separate it from where I need to be that you're not the same shape as an ironing bud but you

139
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,480
 are the same shape as your own body so it's much better to do it on yourself yeah I can't encourage

140
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:38,640
 people to do that chainsaws don't hold the wrong end and a microwave and this was apparently

141
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:43,280
 following a very sad experiment where this had happened and then after that they had to put

142
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:47,040
 the label on because there was some litigation which said that you should have had the label on

143
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,200
 there to begin with otherwise you know and then this woman would have known not to do it do not dry

144
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:57,840
 your pets in the microwave wow is it true that there are some animals that are small enough that

145
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:03,680
 they can dodge the microwave so is if you have a pet aunt if you have a pet and listen to this guy

146
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:10,080
 really your poor kid I know you want a pet I know you've asked for a pet for Christmas for years now

147
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:18,080
 well great news I've finally decided it's got more legs to the cat yeah the idea I think in a

148
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:23,360
 microwave the microwaves go in a certain pattern yeah and the wavelength is long enough that if you

149
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,520
 put an ant in there it will find a bit that isn't going to cook it is it you have to yeah I think

150
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:32,560
 you have to have to take this yeah otherwise it's like Takashi's castle they're just going around it

151
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:39,440
 it's just one extra level of unfair on the end I will say as well like don't try that at home either

152
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:47,280
 don't try that home yeah okay hey guys we need to move on very soon oh and when Apollo 11 took off

153
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:53,280
 NASA worked out that if the rocket exploded it would fire Shrapnel three miles away so they sat

154
00:14:53,280 --> 00:15:02,160
 all the VIPs 3.5 miles away to most of it very nice but you're relying on their maths aren't you yeah

155
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:09,280
 otherwise it was just the VIPs they allowed other people yeah everyone else's news we've got you

156
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:23,840
 front row seats okay it is time for fact number two and that is Alice thank you very much so my

157
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:31,680
 fact is basically an X fact so it is that people used to think that arteries carried air not blood

158
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:37,280
 and that the airways themselves were full of fluid so for a very very long time people thought that

159
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:42,880
 actually blood vessels were full of just air and in fact that's what artery means say artery means

160
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:50,160
 air carrier air tearing in in Greek and I find this just astonishing as an anatomist because you

161
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:55,600
 don't have to do much digging around in the body to work out that there's blood in the blood vessels

162
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:02,000
 and air in the airways but this just went on and on and on do we know why do we know why people thought

163
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,760
 it I think because sometimes if you are if you're dissecting a body and you've waited a while to

164
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:13,120
 dissect it then maybe the arteries could be empty but I mean it just seems really really odd that

165
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:18,880
 they didn't realise and obviously it took a long time to work out that the heart was pumping blood

166
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:24,560
 around the body and then it was circulating so it's kind of there's just there's just misunderstanding

167
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:29,760
 upon misunderstanding and what's interesting is that it's still in the words so the fact that

168
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:35,760
 artery means air carrier and and then they're they're confused about the airways as well so they call

169
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:42,400
 the the trachea the original word is actually arteria trachea so they're calling it an artery but

170
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:48,160
 in order to differentiate it from other what they think are air carrying vessels they call it the

171
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:54,560
 rough artery so arteria trachea so we still call it trachea we just missed the artery a bit of it

172
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,600
 but they were totally confused about the whole thing I mean a lot of it goes back to Aristotle he did

173
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,080
 he did a lot of great work and he knew quite a bit about how bodies were put together and then he

174
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:11,280
 kind of made it up so he said he reckoned that the heart was making blood and they they could see

175
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,600
 that blood was moving through some vessels and going through the periphery but then they thought

176
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,920
 that the body was just consuming it so they thought blood was constantly being made and consumed by the

177
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:24,960
 body and then as far as he was concerned the lungs were just to cool the heart down so the heart's

178
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:28,480
 working so hard it's getting really hot so it needs the lungs to cool it down also the brain is

179
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,960
 another radiator to help cool the blood it cool the heart as well and that's all the brain is

180
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:38,000
 doing it's just a cooling mechanism yeah and you're thinking from your heart to see your heart is

181
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,040
 your seat the seat of your emotions and your and your intellect yes doing a lot that's doing a lot

182
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:50,560
 yeah if today I went to see a doctor who still believed this how how much of a difference would that

183
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:58,160
 make on my survival like because they knew there was still blood in there yeah actually like it was

184
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:03,040
 William Harvey who found out that the heart was pumping blood around the body and a lot of people

185
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:09,120
 didn't really like the idea a lot of physicians because their theory kind of worked like it worked

186
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:14,400
 for them do you know what I mean so him coming up with this new way that the heart works they kind of

187
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:20,480
 resisted it quite a lot of the time and he put it in his book which is in Latin so I'm not going to

188
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,640
 read it but it was he put it right I've seen it recently I've I went into the Royal College of

189
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:30,080
 Physicians and they got out the first edition of the motor cordists on the on the the motion of the

190
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:35,360
 heart and the way that the blood is moved around the body and it's just incredible and what he's

191
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:40,640
 worked out that nobody else has worked out before is that veins carried blood back to the heart so that

192
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:45,840
 so that he was going right yes blood he's being pushed out but it's also coming back again and he said

193
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:50,480
 that there's a closed loop actually but he still didn't know why he still didn't know why blood

194
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,560
 was being pumped off to the lungs and then coming back to the heart again they could see some

195
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:59,200
 connections between arteries and veins in the in the gut so that they could see that happening

196
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:04,160
 at some levels but they couldn't see capillaries and then it was a cornish doctor called John Mayo

197
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,560
 who's a who's a hero of mine I think he's fantastic and he basically went well I think something's

198
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:13,200
 going on in the lungs I think the blood's getting something out of the air I think tiny particles are

199
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,440
 coming out of the air into the blood in the lungs and that's what's going on and that was a hundred

200
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:22,160
 years before anybody knew us and then in the end there is a going through but it's just inside the blood

201
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:28,480
 yeah count one for Aristotle I think well but anybody was talking about he's putting

202
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:34,720
 shorthand but you know William Harvey was friends with Charles the first and Charles the

203
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:41,040
 first used to get him dear to using his experiments because obviously kings have lots of deer at the

204
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:49,680
 disposal and Harvey was there when Charles was people had this thing called scruffular and it was

205
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:54,000
 thought that the king could touch you and it would make you better and William Harvey was one

206
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,160
 of the people who was there sort of like with a note pad going yet they got better they got better they

207
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:05,040
 got better and also Charles what did he definitely did that and also well okay Charles the first

208
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:10,960
 sent him to Burnley in Lancashire and because there was a report of some witches there and he had

209
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:17,600
 to go to Burnley and count their nipples now was that was he volunteering for this job but was he

210
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:24,000
 just sent the king got him to do it because actually Charles wasn't massively into sort of burning

211
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,520
 witches and killing witches like his predecessors had been so he wanted to do an actual you know just

212
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:34,080
 check it out whether it was happening Harvey went over said these people are all completely normal

213
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:38,880
 we shouldn't be killing them and they all got pardoned by Charles the first oh why would they

214
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:44,080
 have had more nipples like with a super new ring nipples was the idea if you were in which you

215
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:50,720
 needed extra nipples to feed your like black cat and the devil I'm afraid there's a known fact that

216
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:57,680
 which is do have a nipple on their tailbone which is where the devil feeds right sorry it's a bit

217
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:08,160
 well it's just science guys no that was the belief in the 17th century was it was all a bit sort

218
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:11,920
 of like fruity stuff you know basically they'll find something if you think you're which they'll

219
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:19,280
 find something especially if you go to Burnley I just hear the ghost of Faraday in this room going

220
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:25,200
 what's happened to my institution so when when was it at what point did we realize blood was where

221
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:32,400
 it is who was that who was that person it's just it's gradual it's a really gradual process so

222
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:38,240
 Galen saw that arteries did contain blood so he was a physician in the first century he was

223
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:44,720
 physician to Moxawelius and he was a surgeon for the gladiators as well so he worked out yeah he

224
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,080
 worked out that these arteries didn't have air in them but they had to they had blood in them

225
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:52,560
 but he still didn't understand the circulation so yeah that comes along much later then there's a

226
00:21:52,560 --> 00:22:01,280
 there's an arabic physician called Ibn al-Nafis in the 13th century who works out that there's a pulmonary

227
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:06,800
 loop but he doesn't link it up with the rest of the circulation so it's pulmonary

228
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:12,720
 it's gradually in the lungs yeah absolutely so it's just gradual steps so we often kind of put Harvey

229
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,160
 up there but he's standing on the shoulders of giants I mean you always are in science aren't you

230
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:21,200
 yes like gradual increments there was a thing wasn't there where people thought the blood went out

231
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,040
 let's say the blood goes out to my hand and then back to the heart and the same blood goes out

232
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:31,200
 to my hand and then back to it's kind of like a big hokey cokey action of like all the blood is

233
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:37,040
 going out and then back in yeah I mean this is one of the things that I'm saying Harvey's time that

234
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:41,760
 there was this idea that the blood was being made constantly and the not that it was coming back

235
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:46,000
 actually but it was being made in the heart and then pushed out and he was working out the volume

236
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,760
 of blood that was being pushed out by the heart and one of his arguments is actually there's too

237
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:54,160
 much blood being pushed out for the body to actually potentially you know possibly absorb this much

238
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:58,880
 so it must be coming back it can't be that it's all being pushed out and then other people

239
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,640
 thought that the liver made it they thought because if you if you kind of look at what the liver's

240
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:08,320
 doing it it's it's receiving all these nutrients from the gut you know and that is what it does so

241
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,880
 it receives all the nutrients come from the veins from the gut go to the liver and then it does

242
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:18,160
 a lot of processing of that and then the idea was that that then goes to the heart gets turned into

243
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:25,280
 blood somewhere and then it's all about nutrients so they just had no idea about oxygen and that being

244
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:29,680
 you know one of the primary reasons of blood circulating obviously it does take nutrients

245
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:34,960
 around as well but the oxygen's pretty important well yeah but also like the worst steps for people

246
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,840
 made mistakes as well and when they realized that there was nutrients as well as oxygen going

247
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:46,160
 around the body there was a guy called Richard Lauer from Cornwall who thought that he could

248
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:53,440
 inject soup into the veins of dogs and that would nourish them interesting yeah what flavor

249
00:23:53,440 --> 00:24:01,680
 not recorded but I'm afraid it wouldn't matter either way and it doesn't work so I again do not try

250
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:08,560
 that at home bad for yeah bad for the dog yeah soup in the microwave pets out of the microwave yeah

251
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:12,480
 that's but that would have been before soup was differentiated into flavors that was

252
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:21,440
 there was only there was just like some soup and then I think it was it was the 18 oh I want to say

253
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,040
 1860s when we got the first I feel like you're fixating on the wrong part

254
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:32,800
 can I just want we're on heart sort of innovations around the heart as well can I tell you as

255
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:38,160
 have you guys had a Werner Forstmann no such an interesting scientist so he was a young German doctor

256
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:47,840
 who he theorized that you could study the heart by inserting a catheter into either an artery or

257
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:53,600
 a vein and and pushing it towards the heart and then taking an extra of yourself and sort of seeing

258
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:59,040
 the heart in more detail basically that was that was his premise and he was a very young doctor he

259
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:05,280
 was about 25 when he came up with this idea he asked his bosses can I do this to a patient no no you

260
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:13,200
 can't so he says what can I do it to myself his bosses say no so at this point he goes a bit rogue

261
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:19,360
 and he just asks a nurse working in his hospital I need to do this to you so to put a catheter in

262
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:24,640
 and and to all the way to the heart right he tells her he's going to do it to her she's sort of

263
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:30,960
 strapped to a trolley but this is the thing he's not going to do it to her he only needs the nurse

264
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:36,560
 because he's so he is so junior as a doctor he doesn't have access to catheters so she has opened

265
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:41,200
 the catheter cabinet for him he sort of straps it to the table and then while she's trapped

266
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:48,000
 out of the table she looks over and he's doing it to himself he's pushed a catheter all the way

267
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:54,320
 into touching his own heart wow stunning he's done it in completely the wrong room to take a picture

268
00:25:54,320 --> 00:26:00,160
 of so they they she then has to unstrap her and she has to help carry all of his clubbo and all

269
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:04,320
 the attached stuff like down two flights of stairs everyone's furious everyone's shouting at him

270
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:12,560
 what are you doing wow sorry what year is this 20s I think yes roughly roughly the 20s maybe

271
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:22,560
 1920s 1920s so we're still on this old it was last week yeah and like even as a colleague is trying

272
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:27,760
 to wrestle this thing out of him say no you can't do this this is insane he goes tada and there it is

273
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:34,640
 photo is taken x-ray image of his own heart you're amazing right it doesn't really go anywhere right

274
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,800
 his career doesn't go especially well he's a like he's a German doctor he goes through

275
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:43,520
 World War II as a German army doctor nothing he thinks has really come of his his sort of ideal

276
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:50,880
 those years ago and then he gets these weird phone calls in 1956 from from foreign-accented people

277
00:26:50,880 --> 00:27:00,240
 saying yeah he's won a Nobel Prize he's won a Nobel Prize for this because it turns out other doctors

278
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:06,560
 carried on his innovations and went further with it I'm sorry I'm just I'm just laughing about the

279
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:11,040
 fact that we have mentioned the Nobel Prize recently in a couple of episodes and anytime we talk

280
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:16,640
 about the phone call this is like the body of of science excellence and every time that one of

281
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:30,960
 the three of us go go to board it all about so rude yeah so you won the Nobel Prize that's he won

282
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:36,400
 a Nobel Prize for it yeah that is amazing I didn't know that story and I've just been making a series

283
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:41,280
 on the history of arts hospital and looking at all the history there because it's 900 years old

284
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:45,760
 just over 900 years old but look also looking at it as a modern hospital and it's obviously a big

285
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:51,920
 cardiac center here in London and and it is there's so much of what's done with people's hearts now

286
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:58,320
 is using catheters so advancing catheters three arteries sticking little stents into into coronary

287
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:03,120
 arteries to open up again if people are you know people have got angina and they're not getting a

288
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:08,160
 good enough blood supply to their hearts so he did the groundwork for that you know his that was

289
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:13,760
 that was you know his bravery sticking that catheter into into a blood vessel and working out

290
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:19,520
 that you can actually get that all the way to the heart and it's even people's lives today yeah yeah

291
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,960
 we should move on in a second I just want to give a quick shout out we mentioned Galen what an

292
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:28,080
 incredible character he is the writer of his period right like that's virtually the only medical

293
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:34,000
 writing that has survived to our day he was a doctor as well as you mentioned before but he also

294
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 had these amazing inventions talking about the basket hat earlier that we were talking about with

295
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:45,840
 Picard he invented the helmet hangover cure so it was he said if you had a hangover just put cabbage

296
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:50,000
 on your head and wear the cabbage on your head and that would cure your hangover and he didn't get

297
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:56,320
 a naval phrase he was overlooked unbelievable that's to call it down I guess yeah because I think

298
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:02,960
 Babe Ruth always wore a cabbage leaf underneath his hat to call his head down he's been reading Galen

299
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:16,240
 it's amazing it is time for fact number three and that is Andy my fact is that theoretically

300
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:24,880
 electric cars could run on kryptonite so this is a very exciting discovery of this century

301
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:35,600
 the 20s the the early 2000s there's a there's a mine in Serbia and a chemical was discovered

302
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:42,880
 in there called jada right and its scientific name is sodium lithium boron silicate hydroxide with

303
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:50,160
 fluorine and a scientist dr. Chris Stanley he's a mineralogist he looked on the web for that formula

304
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:54,960
 after this huge deposit of this stuff was found he could only find that formula in one other place

305
00:29:54,960 --> 00:30:01,840
 and it's in superman returns and lexelitha steals a case of it from from a museum to try and beat

306
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:06,800
 Superman whatever but basically this stuff jada right is a building block of lithium you can

307
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:12,800
 refine lithium from it and this quantity of it in this mine in Serbia is so big that it can produce

308
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:20,400
 I think 90% of the entirety of Europe's target of electric car batteries right it's a huge quantity

309
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:24,720
 and yet the really weird thing is this stuff jada right is only found in this one mine in Serbia

310
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:29,520
 yes it's never been found anywhere else in the world and it's basically the chemical recipe to

311
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:36,400
 produce it is is very precise it's absolutely crazy so you need to find an alkaline rich terminal

312
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:43,280
 lake and some lithium rich volcanic glass and while those two things are together they have to

313
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:50,000
 transform clay materials into very specific rare crystalline structures I don't understand any of

314
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,880
 that but this has been found out quite recently I think this year actually by two scientists called

315
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:59,920
 Chris Stanley and Mike Rumsy but what that means now that they've worked that out we don't we don't

316
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:06,160
 necessarily have to go to jada in Serbia to get it we can make it ourselves so Superman returns

317
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:12,640
 don't know if you've seen it oh yeah it's this what's remarkable is that is where kryptonite was given

318
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:17,840
 the chemical description the makers of the film brought someone in to come up with what it would

319
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:24,880
 be made up of and that happened and was released only I think a few months before then the people who

320
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:29,920
 released what jargonite was made up of released it so it was right it was like it was like when deep

321
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:35,600
 impact an armageddon came out at the same time it was like no one had planned that yeah it's pretty

322
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:42,320
 crazy and also in Superman returns there's it's the first Superman movie since the fourth Superman

323
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:49,040
 movie and the final words in Superman 4 are I'll see you in 20 and then Superman returns was made 20

324
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:56,000
 years later and not on purpose Alice you're giving me a look like you're saying keep talking about

325
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,600
 Superman returns Dan and it's got to be on purpose surely you would think right but no apparently

326
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:07,680
 it was so nice to see you on home territory finally Dan and none of this is anything to do with

327
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:14,160
 krypton which is a completely innocuous noble gas which is an actual gas that's an actual element

328
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:19,760
 and that was found in 1898 it's very unreactive with almost everything but you do occasionally

329
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:25,440
 get it between the glass and double-pained windows do you yeah that's a use for krypton I mean don't

330
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:31,280
 go don't rush home and just a warning Alice if you ever have a dinner at Andy's house this is

331
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:38,800
 the kind of chat you get he takes you to his windows you know there's a bit of krypton it's really

332
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:45,520
 interesting oh it was found it's so cool so William Bramsey and Morris Travers they Bramsey found

333
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:52,400
 Argonne then he went on a bit of a streak identified helium and krypton and neon and xenon and radon

334
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:58,560
 she's working the whole family of noble gases that only feels like he's learned how to do one thing

335
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:02,960
 though oh like you don't like if your lip picks when someone's really good at swimming and then

336
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:12,880
 when my 10 gold medals and it's like you're only good at swimming this is why James was fired from

337
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:21,680
 the commentating job for the another medal what was it for oh swimming again swimming in a slightly

338
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:31,200
 different way well done so apparently Batman keeps a bit of kryptonite in his belt at all time get

339
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,600
 out yeah in case Superman goes evil again in case he goes evil again now where there are theories

340
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:40,960
 that Superman gave him the kryptonite as a sort of insurance policy to say you can trust me I'm

341
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:50,000
 you're okay Alice you're gonna I've never made a guest look like they want to leave the show

342
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:58,320
 as much as you in 11 years of doing this quick so what else electric vehicles thank you yeah I got

343
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:06,160
 them do you reckon they sat on fire more or less than normal petrol cars catch fire yeah oh well

344
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:11,120
 they catch fire every 15 minutes I think I have read that you know yeah well actually like if you

345
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:16,560
 look in the news as always like another car sat on fire electric car but there was a study done

346
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:22,720
 this year that found they sat on fire much less it's about 20 times less than a petrol car they sat on

347
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:27,760
 fire but the problem is that the fires are much more spectacular when they go up because lithium

348
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:34,240
 batteries burn very very very hot and also once you put them out they can just sat on fire again

349
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:39,280
 later really let's say they go into some water as well like the water and lithium reacts very badly

350
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:45,920
 together and so what they do is when you if your car has been on fire in some departments in

351
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:51,680
 America they'll submerge them in fresh water for 24 hours before they're certain that they

352
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:55,840
 definitely won't catch fire again oh wow I am always a bit worried about this because at home we've

353
00:34:55,840 --> 00:35:01,200
 got an electric car and we've also got little RC cars as well what are they selling it little radio

354
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:08,320
 control cars and they've got these batteries that you have to charge in a metal box so when I'm

355
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:13,040
 charging out the batteries for my radio control car it's in a metal box when I'm charging at my

356
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:19,520
 other car the actual car I just plug it in oh yeah I don't put it in a metal box the microwave

357
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:28,240
 I think that's fine get all those ants out there can I tell you my favorite electric vehicle of the

358
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:33,040
 year okay all right it's over the top gear job it's a really cool one okay no it's really cool

359
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:38,400
 there's a big Australian mining company called Fortescue and they're on a huge sort of net zero

360
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,400
 drive at the moment because you know mining is pretty bad for the environment in general a lot of

361
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:48,320
 big vehicles burning lots of diesel blah blah blah Fortescue are testing out loads of electric stuff

362
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:52,240
 at the moment and trying to get it all into their fleet one of the things they're testing is an

363
00:35:52,240 --> 00:36:01,120
 infinite train is that the circle line is they just the circle line it's a battery powered electric

364
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:07,200
 train right it loads up with the load of iron ore I think whatever they're getting out of the ground

365
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:13,040
 right it carries it to where it needs to be next you know loaded onto the next bit of the journey

366
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,560
 right but it's it's on the slight downhill gradient because it's come to the sort of the top of

367
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:22,080
 a big open cast mine so it goes downhill it does it breaks and it does regenerative breaking

368
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:27,600
 to recharge the battery as it descends and then by the time it's got to the bottom and unloaded

369
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:33,280
 all the stuff it was carrying it has gained enough charge to go all the way back around to the top

370
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:41,440
 and get filled up again can you explain entropy to Andrew please at some point you're going to

371
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:47,280
 lease some energy in terms of friction oh you'll top it up you'll top it up no no but it's because

372
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:52,080
 it's so much heavier on the way down the regenerative breaking on the way down yeah it does charge

373
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:56,480
 the battery up more than uh maybe not more than enough you'll need to charge it occasionally okay

374
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:02,560
 I guess the laws of physics aka Alice that give me a bit of a look and that's fine I respect

375
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:10,640
 I respect those laws what a cool alias for you Alice the laws of physics it's not pretty good

376
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,920
 we need to move on to our final house I haven't even told you about my second favorite electric car

377
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:22,960
 of the year it's a car that can it's thank you guys scattered scattered scattered but I'll take it

378
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:29,600
 look mercury spealing pure this is a car it isn't electric car as well that's kind of incidental

379
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:36,640
 to why it's so cool it can go upside down okay it genuinely can and the laws of physics don't have

380
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:43,280
 anything to say about it unless I promise I think all cars can go upside down like if you drive

381
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:48,240
 them particularly badly great point don't they say they're about f1 cars as well that when they're

382
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:52,560
 in tunnels they go so fast that you can in theory drive out of the thing so really good cars and

383
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:56,640
 especially formula one cars they exert they have a lot of downforce right yeah and the reason that's

384
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:03,840
 good is more grip on the road this particular one is a fan car right it sucks air out from beneath it

385
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:09,120
 there's basically got a skirt all the way around it but a very very efficient skirt it's a hovercraft

386
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:20,720
 it's a hover caft it's a hot yeah yes um so the the car weighs a thousand kilos and it can

387
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:25,040
 generate two thousand kilos of downforce and I've watched the training the sort of video where

388
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:30,320
 they tested out earlier this year it drives onto this platform the platform just revolves upside

389
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:39,200
 down right and the car stays okay and what is the use well um double double capacity on the black

390
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:47,760
 wall tunnel easy yes I don't have a hovercraft once as well this is on coasty so they found all these

391
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,800
 kind of like weird experiments to me to do so there's the one where they attached all the bleans

392
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,720
 to me and tried to inflate me into here and then there's another one where they gave me a hovercraft

393
00:38:54,720 --> 00:39:00,480
 to drive myself and I was just on my own in this hovercraft fantastic um and I was driving and obviously

394
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,840
 the nice thing about hovercraft is that you don't have to be on the ground you can be on the water

395
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:08,240
 so I so I was on a beach obviously it was a coast it was everything had to be the seaside

396
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:13,760
 and I just went off the beach on and went over the waves and went out to see and I realised I didn't

397
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:19,840
 need I to turn around oh no I was just disappearing off into this because they filmed me because the

398
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:25,920
 old goose picked hard of BBC two they thought it was quite amazing and then and there was a bit of a panic

399
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:30,960
 and what happened in the end well eventually I did really I did work in it but it took me a while

400
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:34,960
 and I had to kind of overcome that moment of panic and go right I must actually be able to do this

401
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:43,040
 you didn't just go right around the world I thought they were only gigantic things with you know

402
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:49,600
 yeah like a person hovercraft yeah amazing we used to in Hong Kong where I grew up to get from

403
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:55,600
 Calo inside and various other islands you'd go by hovercraft and when I was born my dad

404
00:39:55,600 --> 00:40:00,640
 went back to Discovery Bay which is where we lived and he went to get back stuff that we needed

405
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:06,480
 because it was a sort of emergency birth and so he he went back home and he was so tired that he

406
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:10,800
 had an hour sleep got his stuff and came back to Hong Kong islands sitting on the hovercraft he

407
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:15,840
 suddenly was really ill because he was so tired so he said can I just step outside and they said yes

408
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:20,160
 so he went outside the back and he was breathing and he noticed that the hovercraft lifted

409
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:25,760
 and started slowly moving so he went to go back inside and the door was locked and he traveled

410
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:31,600
 the journey of Discovery Bay to Hong Kong which was about 20 30 minutes on the back of a hovercraft

411
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:38,880
 holding on oh my god no one knew to let him back in the person forgot that they let him out

412
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:43,440
 he did the entire journey on the back of the hovercraft and then when he landed there he fell

413
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:48,400
 down onto the dock an ambulance was called they were bringing him to a local hospital he said take

414
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:54,320
 me to Adventist that's where my wife is we've just had a baby took him there he got into the room

415
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:58,160
 because he was like I know which room I'm going to so suddenly they're looking for an escape patient

416
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:02,080
 because he just wandered off went into the room kicked my mum out of the bed and fell asleep

417
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:18,320
 that's an origin story that Superman could be proud of it's time for our final fact of the show

418
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:24,960
 and that is my fact my fact this week is that Pokemon was invented so that others could experience

419
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:32,480
 the joy of insect hunting this is this is really cool so Pokemon was created by a man called Satoshi

420
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:40,320
 Tajiri and as a kid he was an insect collector he was known as Dr. Bug and all the students would

421
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:44,800
 look at his collections and they would trade bugs anyone else he was an entomologist an amateur

422
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:50,160
 entomologist they would trade bugs with each other and he then was also very much into video games

423
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:56,000
 he found a mentor who was the man who created Mario and created the legends of Zelda so like what a

424
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:01,920
 team this guy then goes do you know I would love because all the areas that he grew up in as a kid

425
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:07,840
 in Japan were being paved over all the bits where you could find insects were now no longer with any

426
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:12,560
 nature around them and he thought I want to teach that experience of what it's like to be a collector

427
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:18,960
 to understand the joy and so that was Pokemon it was him trying to teach kids the joy of collecting

428
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:25,440
 pretty cool so I love that that's amazing yeah very cool when was that done do you say um it was

429
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:33,120
 1996 96 it came out yeah because actually the number of people collecting insects has plunged

430
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:38,000
 since the 1990s really and the articles I've read about it don't mention that people are doing

431
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:45,040
 Pokemon instead I guess is possible but the problem is that like people are collect I mean maybe

432
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:50,720
 it's not great to go around collecting insects I'm not judging on that but the decline of collecting

433
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:56,800
 insects as a hobby is making conservation much more difficult because entomologists they used to

434
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:01,040
 be given like hundreds of butterflies by people when they die they're like what we're going to do

435
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:04,560
 with this we'll give them to the natural history museum or whatever but now they're having fewer

436
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:08,800
 and fewer collections given to them right and it's citizen science as well that's probably

437
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:13,440
 useful records and it's like that I think because I think there was another co-founder of Pokemon

438
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:20,080
 Unichim Masuda also spend much of his time as a child collecting insects yeah so both of them did

439
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:27,280
 yeah and uh it's so clearly and what was that 1970s Osaka and Tokyo it's just a huge hobby yeah

440
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:32,000
 and but like Miyamoto who was the guy who invented Mario and Zelda Zelda basically came about because

441
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,400
 he used to go he loved finding caves and going into caves and that gave him the idea of a fantasy

442
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:43,040
 adventure so weirdly nature has informed the biggest video games there and I'm pretty sure I'm

443
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:48,560
 right in saying that Pokemon is the biggest entertainment franchise of all time nothing comes close

444
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:55,200
 really yeah Avengers and that whole Marvel franchise doesn't come close Mario doesn't even come close

445
00:43:55,200 --> 00:44:03,120
 it's Pokemon superman returns not insect collecting has given us a lot it has given us a great deal

446
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:09,280
 the idea of daylight saving this was first coined by a young boy called George Hudson who was an

447
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:15,600
 avid uh Kiwi insect collector and he worked in the post office and there wasn't much time in his day

448
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:22,560
 to collect insects because he had a job and he hated it and so he wrote to the Wellington philosophical

449
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:27,680
 society this is in the 1880s I believe hey during summer why don't we just shift the clocks back two

450
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:32,160
 hours so we've all we've all got more time to go out and collect insects which we all love doing right

451
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:38,800
 and um I don't think it took off sadly but I think he was the first to propose it as a as a notion

452
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:43,600
 and specifically right I mean I'm I'm interested in this kind of insect collection thing and the

453
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:47,840
 fact that that's dropped off because if that means killing insects that's probably a good idea yeah

454
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:51,520
 I wonder if more people are fated golfing them because obviously we've got these amazing apps now

455
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:55,520
 where you can fated golf insects and they'll identify them for you so I wonder if there's been a

456
00:44:55,520 --> 00:45:00,640
 kind of rise in that and that's a better way of collecting yes yeah it's like bird spotting isn't it

457
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:06,480
 it's just seeing it and writing down and trusting that that's a true account of what you're saying

458
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:10,800
 I think that's probably right uh yeah I really like Pokemon and the thing is uh well I've been asking

459
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:14,960
 my son about it because he was he was madly into Pokemon but he said I'm not allowed to mention that

460
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:20,640
 now because he's almost a teenager and it's not cool anymore um but the other cool thing that he

461
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:26,640
 isn't too is nice such thing as a fish he's an enormous fan of nice yeah um but he told me that

462
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:31,520
 there were one thousand and twenty five species and I didn't know this actually because um I didn't

463
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:35,200
 know how many species are there but I didn't know that they evolved and I thought that was really

464
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:40,240
 cool about it as well so I didn't know it was inspired by biology and insect collecting but I really

465
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:45,440
 liked the fact it had this kind of biological idea wave and into it that over time those species

466
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:50,480
 could change into other different forms there is a cancer gene called Pokemon or however there was

467
00:45:50,480 --> 00:46:01,440
 it was called p.o.k. erythroid myeloid ontogenic gene so it's p.o.k.e.m. or n um but then um Pokemon USA

468
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:04,800
 threatened to lawsuit and they had to rename it it's now called

469
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:10,560
 glue against the cancer gene no it gets p.o.k.e. I guess against the scientists.

470
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:14,880
 There's a trend doing this though isn't there's a trend for naming genes after

471
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:20,720
 yeah like Sonic the Hedgehog on Hedgehog genes yeah yeah but Pokemon USA we're not happy about this

472
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:29,040
 and so it's now called z b t b seven oh orang in Japan you can sign legal documents with your

473
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:34,400
 favorite Pokemon what do you mean um so they have this thing where you can sign your name

474
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:40,880
 or you can have a thing called a hanko which is a personal seal so it's like um what would you

475
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:46,800
 call that wax seal not a wax seal but like an ink block kind of thing oh yeah um so like a stamp

476
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:52,960
 a stamp that was the word I was looking for so yeah an ink stamp they're called hanko and they

477
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:58,480
 have only certain ones that you're allowed to use you gotta just use any old thing but very recently

478
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:04,160
 in the last ten years they changed it so Pokemon's allowed as well so if you have a favorite Pokemon

479
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:09,200
 and you have one of these stamps you can sign your probably if I was playing Pokemon too much made

480
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:15,120
 the boss papers right with a hanko you know if you depole your name to something else but then you get

481
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:19,600
 a criminal record you have to stick with that name oh yeah if you get a criminal record are you

482
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:25,840
 not allowed to evolve in your Pokemon with your stamp you stuck as as charmander your whole time

483
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:34,720
 that would be the criminals I'm sorry I'm really lost oh no some of them evolve evil no I don't know

484
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:40,640
 what's going on it's okay it's okay it's okay sometimes to not know I'm gonna have some I'm gonna

485
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:45,840
 have some questions afterwards Alice's sign if that's all right um yeah there was a woman recently

486
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:51,760
 who changed her name to Pudzie Bear and then she sorry we're just on name changes now and she's

487
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:57,120
 um she's been turned down for a passport and she's really annoyed about it yeah but you're not allowed

488
00:47:57,120 --> 00:48:06,720
 to have something covering your face like an eye patch lovely um on that insect collecting I was

489
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:12,800
 reading about someone called Liz Fowler um in 2016 she went to St Helena to look for something called

490
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:18,400
 Baza Levski's Crane Fly and they weren't sure if it was extinct on that no one had seen one for

491
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:24,320
 45 years and why she was driving down the highway one of them flew through the window and landed on

492
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:34,400
 her hand so cool uh and in 2014 there was a guy called Javier oh he was called Javier he was called

493
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:44,480
 Javier his surname was Juanca now in we see that that is that's how you say it oh that's that's

494
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:50,800
 pronounced Juanca right out it's there's a there's a group of people in Peru called the

495
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:56,880
 Juanca people and there's a football team called Departivo Juanca oh is that the same name after the same

496
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:02,320
 name after the same bunch of Juanca anyway yeah yeah yeah again we're fixated at the wrong

497
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:07,680
 point of this fact yeah which is that while Javier was waiting for a bus and his pockets

498
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:16,960
 he looked to the tree on his right and found the new species a spider mite which is what he was studying

499
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:20,880
 so he was literally just waiting for a bus and there it was so cool so I think that's one of the

500
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:24,880
 cool things about insect collecting is sometimes they just literally land in your lap yeah it

501
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:28,960
 is amazing and but yeah it's fortune favors the prepared mind yeah you know if you hadn't been studying

502
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:33,360
 spider mice there's no way he would so what I find very interesting about insect discovery yeah it's

503
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:38,400
 another of these things kind of related to your fact honest about what what we knew when and the

504
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:44,480
 misconceptions and so there's a very cool early entomologist her name was Maria Cibilla Mary and

505
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:50,400
 she was brought born in Frankfurt in 1647 and she's the woman who absolutely nailed the evidence

506
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:56,320
 that butterflies used to be caterpillars and vice versa oh right yeah and before that I think

507
00:49:56,320 --> 00:50:03,360
 it was quite open to debate because because it's mental because it's mental the idea that there's

508
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:08,160
 a caterpillar and then it goes in a little cocoon and then it mushes its whole body up what comes out

509
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:12,240
 like a beautiful butterfly yeah yeah it's crazy it is crazy because they didn't have pokemon to

510
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:17,440
 sort of explain that science to them at the time but again it's one of these things it bit it seems

511
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:21,920
 crazy but also it seems really really easy to work it out I mean it's like the whole thing about

512
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:28,240
 Archie's carrying air you just go well yeah just keep it in a box and then one day there's a butterfly

513
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:31,920
 but that's what she did she did it for several generations and I don't know why several generations

514
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:37,600
 in a row you think as you say you think one would do it but no no butterflies from egg to adult again

515
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:42,080
 does it else does it blow your mind in the way that I think it blows ours and possibly everyone else

516
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:46,480
 that that can happen with a butterfly that it can go from this one state to this kind of soupy

517
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:51,920
 goop and then become the other thing or does that just make sense it is amazing but I also think I

518
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:56,960
 mean I'm absolutely obsessed with embryology and I've written books about embryology I teach embryology

519
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:02,880
 and just this idea that we've gone each of us have gone from being a single cell you know

520
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:06,960
 that we're all sitting here being trillions of cells it's not metamorphosis it's not the same as

521
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:11,040
 insects but we've gone through this amazing transformation where you turn into something which looks

522
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:16,080
 like a ball of cells and then it looks like a fluid filled ball of cells and it's a bit like a sausage

523
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:21,680
 and then it grazes little stumpy arms and legs and then it's heart starts to be and it's just amazing

524
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:28,240
 it's this incredible transformation and it involves a lot of origami like folding and and cells

525
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:34,160
 moving around say migration of cells inside the body as well it's it's just incredible yeah it blows

526
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:46,000
 my mind yeah cool I mean you could just set that but that this how you treat all your guests that

527
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:55,840
 such such a dick such a dick oh my god do you know I you get to do the coolest job in the world by

528
00:51:55,840 --> 00:52:01,760
 the way which is you you get to go and see things that have been in the ground that have no one has

529
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:05,680
 seen for sometimes hundreds of thousands of years millions of years I mean it's an astonishing thing

530
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:10,400
 finding fossils finding all bones I know you've written a bunch of books about that there was one

531
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:14,240
 because you probably can't collect them in the way that insect collectors keep them because there's

532
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:19,280
 you've got to they belong to the country right and they have to go to a museum and yeah again it's

533
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:23,520
 the experiences and the and the photographs and I came across a photograph myself the other day

534
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:32,160
 holding LB1 the skull of the of homophysiancists from Lurangbura Cave in Indonesia and you know

535
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:37,280
 things like that and it's incredible I remember doing that I was filming incredible human journey

536
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:44,720
 for the BBC back in 2008 and turned up in Jakarta and it was talking to the curators of the museum

537
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:49,360
 there and they said you know who are you what do you do and I said well I'm a biological

538
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:55,520
 scientist and they said okay here's the coverage with LB1 in you can lay out the the fossils are not

539
00:52:55,520 --> 00:53:00,240
 it was just incredible yeah real privilege I read there's a thing that's in your latest book it's

540
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:07,120
 in the prologue and it's just so cool this is 20 years ago you were hanging on the side of a cliff

541
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:13,840
 and it's because this cliff kept dropping bones down onto the beach below because it was a cemetery

542
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:18,400
 built on the edge of a cliff and the cliff has been eroding so as it grows yeah

543
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:24,240
 the bones slowly emerge and drop down and you were I mean I just love where the the extra stories

544
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:29,920
 to where collections are being made from that would be a collection of you know cliff drop bones

545
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:34,000
 and it was an unnamed cemetery and that all relied on just ordinary people you know walking

546
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:38,640
 on the beach and you know noticing that among the seaweed and bits of sea glass and whatever

547
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:43,120
 else there were the occasional human bone great grief would you get like half a coffin poking out

548
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:47,520
 and it was kind of the sort of yeah it's it was weird it was very ancient cemetery it was kind of

549
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:52,960
 seventh century so it wasn't there weren't coffins it was a type of grave called a kissed grave where

550
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:57,440
 you almost build the coffin in the ground so you dig the shaft down and then you put slabs of stone

551
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:02,240
 and then you lay the body in so what we saw when we when we cleared all the undergrowth or overgrowth

552
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:08,080
 they were the cliff edge away were these were these kind of perpendicular slabs of rocks sticking

553
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:12,960
 out of a sandy rock face so it was kind of like red sandstone so they shouldn't have been there

554
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:17,840
 well they weren't naturally there they they were part of these kiss graves yeah so we rescued

555
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:22,320
 the bits of bone that were just dropping out and then laughed it there but we did usefully map the

556
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:27,760
 extent of the cemetery above ground as well using geophysical equipment to scan the ground yeah very

557
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:32,160
 cool this is so cool now it is amazing and we've just made another series of digging for Britain and

558
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:36,000
 and you know that's just such a joy because it's current archaeology and it's what's just come out

559
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:40,560
 to the ground and there are some oh my god I don't know I'm allowed to talk about it yeah maybe I can

560
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:47,040
 there's this absolutely amazing find which is an iron age find and it is a type of trumpet from

561
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:53,120
 the iron age where nobody's ever found a complete one and we have a complete one from Britain and it

562
00:54:53,120 --> 00:55:01,040
 is utterly astonishing it's amazing amazing that's very cool and the archaeologists when they started

563
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:04,720
 excavating we're like oh we think we've got a bit of this thing called a carnix and then they were

564
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:08,800
 excavating a bit more going we think maybe there's a bit more of it and they lifted it in a block

565
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:14,560
 because it's very fragile really fragile ancient bronze work and they took it to your hospital to

566
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:19,760
 x-ray it and then MRI scan it and of course you know that was an incredibly exciting day because they're

567
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:24,400
 putting it through this MRI scanner and suddenly they realized they've got the whole thing in

568
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:38,560
