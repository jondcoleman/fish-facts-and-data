00:00:03,00:00:08,"Hi everyone, welcome to this episode of Notice Things A Fish, which we recorded live at the Royal"
00:00:08,00:00:15,"Institution in London. The venerable, venerable place where so many great scientists have been"
00:00:15,00:00:20,"over the years and now us. Although there was a great scientist there with us, we had a guest and"
00:00:20,00:00:26,"that was Professor Alice Roberts. Now if you follow science in Britain, if you follow science"
00:00:26,00:00:32,"communication, if you follow science on TV, you'll know all about Alice Roberts as she's absolutely"
00:00:32,00:00:36,"brilliant. We had such a good time doing the show with her and she does have a new book out,"
00:00:36,00:00:42,actually. It's called Domination and it is all about the fall of the Roman Empire and the growth
00:00:42,00:00:47,"of Christianity, absolutely brilliant book, as all of Alice's books are. And if you want to learn"
00:00:47,00:00:54,"more about her, then you can go to Alice-Hyphen-robots.co.uk and everything about her will be there."
00:00:54,00:00:59,I should just quickly add that we do have a special secret members club called Club Fish where
00:00:59,00:01:04,"there's lots of extra stuff. If you feel like you haven't got your fix of fish at the moment,"
00:01:04,00:01:10,"loads of extra stuff on tears there. There's an excel version of this show and every show,"
00:01:10,00:01:14,"if you think that I do a terrible job editing the show and I need to be making it much, much"
00:01:14,00:01:20,"longer than there is the place to go for that. But yeah, there's loads of stuff there. So go to"
00:01:20,00:01:25,patreon.com/nosusexafish if you would like to join. But really hope you enjoy this. We had such a great
00:01:25,00:01:31,time at the Royal Institution. I can't tell you how exciting it was to be there. I think it does come
00:01:31,00:01:36,"through in the show itself. Anyway, happy new year and on with the podcast!"
00:01:36,00:01:59,"Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast this week coming"
00:01:59,00:02:12,to you live from the Royal Institution. My name is Dan Schreiber. I am sitting here with James
00:02:12,00:02:19,"Tarkin, Andrew Huntamari and Professor Alice Roberts. And once again, we have gathered around the"
00:02:19,00:02:25,"microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in a particular order,"
00:02:25,00:02:31,"here we go, starting with fact number one and that is James. Okay, my fact this week is that the first"
00:02:31,00:02:41,person to travel into the stratosphere did so with a pillow on his head. So for people at home who
00:02:41,00:02:48,"can't see the image, this is two gentlemen and they have like a basket, a wicker basket and underneath"
00:02:48,00:02:57,is the pillow and this was a trip by Auguste Picard and he wanted to work out some things about Cosmic
00:02:57,00:03:03,Rays which he might go into later but they Germans were he was setting off from didn't want him to go
00:03:03,00:03:08,up there. They tried to ban his assent but he was Swiss so he managed to get someone in Switzerland to
00:03:08,00:03:13,say no you're allowed to do it. But the Germans wouldn't have it and they said well okay you can go
00:03:13,00:03:19,up but you must wear helmets. They didn't have any helmets to hand so they cobbled some together.
00:03:19,00:03:27,And it's important to wear a helmet completely but also he was going eight or nine miles
00:03:27,00:03:31,up and if it didn't work out a helmet is not going to be the thing that does or doesn't make the
00:03:31,00:03:36,"difference. No, I would think no. Again if there are any astronauts listening to keep your helmet on"
00:03:36,00:03:42,yeah take my word for it you know. It's not like he wasn't wearing a helmet with like an oxygen
00:03:42,00:03:47,mask in there or anything like that right. It was literally just to cover his bones. Yeah. Did he
00:03:47,00:03:53,have a parachute? I do not think they did. Oh no. That would be more useful. Yeah no absolutely. When
00:03:53,00:03:58,did we invent the parachute? Was it invented in 1931? The guy who invented the modern parachute
00:03:58,00:04:05,because like Leonardo da Vinci had pictures of parachutes in his in his drawings right. Yeah. But the
00:04:05,00:04:13,modern parachute was invented in 1913 by a guy called Everad Calthrop and he offered it to the royal
00:04:13,00:04:18,flying car because this was during the or was it during the war just before the war. So in 1915
00:04:18,00:04:25,he offered it to the flying car and they said they didn't want to give them to the pilots because
00:04:25,00:04:30,it might impair the fighting spirit of the pilots. I think right. And they thought if they've got
00:04:30,00:04:37,parachutes then they'll just jump out. Yes. Yes. I always say if I'm going to be a racer just get rid
00:04:37,00:04:44,of the brakes. I will only encourage me to slow down my motor car. Do you know this has to be the
00:04:44,00:04:49,most accident Mr. Bean prone experiment I think I've ever read about. It's remarkable isn't it? It
00:04:49,00:04:55,is. Have you ever heard about this trip? This first trip to the stratosphere else with August Picard?
00:04:55,00:04:59,No. What happened? Well basically we'll get into what they were kind of trying to do which is
00:04:59,00:05:03,were they were trying to help Albert Einstein prove the theory of relativity and they thought we
00:05:03,00:05:09,can do that by heading up to the highest spot on earth. So Picard who everyone if you want a picture
00:05:09,00:05:14,what he's looking what he looks like at home picture professor calculus from the Tin Tin books because
00:05:14,00:05:20,because that's who it was based on. Yeah. Calculus was based on August Picard. He was this
00:05:20,00:05:27,eccentric but brilliant scientist and he's actually taller than calculuses in the Tin Tin
00:05:27,00:05:32,books. He's six foot six and Hershey had to make him smaller so he'd fit in the frames. Come on.
00:05:32,00:05:41,Yeah. That's just drawn him further away. Yeah. He's wonderful. Yeah. Picard. I just everything about him
00:05:41,00:05:45,sounds sort of wonderful. He never went anywhere without a slide rule and two wristwatches.
00:05:45,00:05:53,He decorated his home with prisms so he would be great to watch his. What one for what I don't need to
00:05:53,00:05:59,you know I mean one for what you know one for the time here and one for the time up up there.
00:05:59,00:06:04,You know what the reason I asked you is because I knew the answer and I thought you might do as well
00:06:04,00:06:08,no absolutely no but the reason he did is because he knew that if they didn't match then at least one
00:06:08,00:06:18,of them was wrong. Clever. Very clever. Clever. But this trip they made up they didn't a couple of
00:06:18,00:06:24,people had tried to get into the stratosphere before I think in planes and how high did you have to go?
00:06:24,00:06:30,I think it's about it's at least seven and a half miles so the air is pretty thin and pretty cold
00:06:30,00:06:37,and a couple of people had tried in planes and not done terribly well. Picard's innovation was a sealed
00:06:37,00:06:43,what do you call the sealed gondola with walls of aluminium that were I think three and a half
00:06:43,00:06:50,millimeters thick so it's quite fragile this thing carrying them up and above him and his assistant
00:06:50,00:06:59,Kipfer Paul Kipfer I believe a huge balloon filled with hydrogen and that expands and it carries him
00:06:59,00:07:03,up and it expands in the light of the sun and it carried them up and up and up and up and up and up
00:07:03,00:07:09,and as you said Dan one thing off from the start of going wrong well with nightmare. But even before
00:07:09,00:07:14,the mission started it started going wrong so Kipfer said he knew that the whole thing had got off
00:07:14,00:07:18,to a rough start when they were doing their final checks and he looked out the window and he saw
00:07:18,00:07:23,chimneys passing them from the top of houses. Oh yeah yeah yeah they're like oh so we've left like
00:07:23,00:07:29,they just didn't even know they had no idea that they'd taken off so immediately that was an issue
00:07:29,00:07:34,yep and they had this sort of half an hour crisis of there was a hole in the side of the gondola
00:07:34,00:07:40,which had to be pasted shut and they were very ingenious in the way they did it. Oh yeah the other
00:07:40,00:07:44,thing it might get extremely hot up there because you've got less you know protection against the
00:07:44,00:07:50,sun's rays so they had this little propeller on the side of the gondola their capsule so what that
00:07:50,00:07:54,meant was one side of the capsule was painted white and one was painted black and they thought well
00:07:54,00:07:59,look if we can turn it if we can turn the the white side towards the sun that'll reflect the
00:07:59,00:08:06,sun's light keep us nice and cool ever and if and that's ingenious unfortunately the propeller broke
00:08:06,00:08:12,and so they were then unable to control the temperature it got up to 40 degrees celsius in
00:08:12,00:08:18,there 104 Fahrenheit the water evaporated they had to lick the walls for moisture oh it's just a
00:08:18,00:08:22,matter how long were they out there they were for hours and the problem was they could all day yeah
00:08:22,00:08:26,they couldn't come down because the machine that was going to allow them to come down froze so
00:08:26,00:08:31,they could they were like well we're just here now and we just have to wait for it to take us back down
00:08:31,00:08:38,nightfall yeah when the sun goes down hydrogen cools and shrinks and allows them to descend yeah meanwhile
00:08:38,00:08:43,the balloon no they didn't bother they had a way of getting to the balloon no they couldn't because
00:08:43,00:08:48,they were closed inside meanwhile the barometer explodes the mercury within it falls to the ground
00:08:48,00:08:53,and because the material is made of this metal it starts eating the actual thing that they're
00:08:53,00:08:59,in on the floor I mean can you imagine you're in this just two of you one six foot six looks like
00:08:59,00:09:07,professor calculus doesn't know what time it is okay the um they press said that they died didn't
00:09:07,00:09:12,they yeah they've been up for so long they were expected to come back quicker than that so in the
00:09:12,00:09:16,newspapers that afternoon they said yeah they've gone that's it so like I've never been in a hot
00:09:16,00:09:21,air balloon I think you have have you done that before I haven't been up a couple of times in a
00:09:21,00:09:28,hot air balloon is it petrifying uh it's really lovely until you land why do I love it I mean I
00:09:28,00:09:33,love that kind of taking off and it's so quiet when you're out and you just hear dogs barking see that's
00:09:33,00:09:38,what I find scary yeah it's her priority because if you're the way you might go in the air like in a
00:09:38,00:09:43,plane or a helicopter it's noisy as hell isn't it it's just so peaceful but the thing is you just
00:09:43,00:09:47,can't steer them can you you go where the wind takes you yeah you're kind of you just relying on
00:09:47,00:09:52,that and then trying to find somewhere to land that doesn't involve a lot of cows usually right why
00:09:52,00:09:56,were you why were you doing it by the way for the show was that like a BBC budget thing or were you
00:09:56,00:10:03,now I don't think I'm done it for television oh you know I think I've just done it for fun right okay
00:10:03,00:10:09,there was fun until we landed okay doesn't the thing of the BBC budget that says we haven't
00:10:09,00:10:14,spent all of this years money yet get robots in a hot air balloon now do you know there was there
00:10:14,00:10:19,wasn't experiment that we tried to do years and years ago when I did coast back in 2005 when
00:10:19,00:10:22,they were trying to work out how many weather balloons they'd have to attach to me to lift me off
00:10:22,00:10:27,the ground and then it became obvious that actually it was too windy to do it and I was likely to be
00:10:27,00:10:33,kind of dragged off this key which we would it it was honestly the whole thing and this is picture
00:10:33,00:10:36,of me standing there looking utterly terrified and I think I've got about 14 weather balloons
00:10:36,00:10:41,attached to me and I'm just my toes just starting to lift off but we never actually at that point
00:10:41,00:10:47,you went no no I think actually this is a bad I would you got scared at 14 balloons being attached how
00:10:47,00:10:55,would they how would they've got you back down well this is the question so when they put these
00:10:55,00:11:02,14 on did you start to feel a little bit way yeah definitely yeah yeah yeah they landed Picard and
00:11:02,00:11:06,Kipfer they landed on a glacier and they weren't out of the woods even when they landed you know
00:11:06,00:11:11,and they had to have yes they were they were I'm like like yeah sorry yeah the tree line the love of
00:11:11,00:11:17,the tree line yeah but they had they had to I think hike down the glacier I was just this was 1931
00:11:17,00:11:21,we should say did they get the data though sorry they were up there to get some data they got the data
00:11:21,00:11:26,I think they did get the data they were studying cosmic rays because they were trying to support
00:11:26,00:11:31,Einstein's theories of relativity I think they did I think but by accident because they largely
00:11:31,00:11:36,were just trying to survive because from the get go they should have died and they they didn't like
00:11:36,00:11:42,the mercury there was a statement Picard just said out loud he was like if only I had a vacuum
00:11:42,00:11:47,cleaner and they realized that the whole of the of the actual ship if we can call it though the
00:11:47,00:11:53,gondola he called it was there was a hole in it where they opened it and acted like a vacuum and
00:11:53,00:11:58,sucked all the mercury out and then they stuffed some clothing to it and then it's like it's gene
00:11:58,00:12:03,Apollo 13 it's the original Apollo 13 basically yeah it is yeah yeah it sounds like there were a lot
00:12:03,00:12:06,of risks that they haven't thought I would have liked to see the risk assessment it sounds like
00:12:06,00:12:09,there's a lot of things they haven't thought about but they had thought about the possibility of
00:12:09,00:12:13,things falling on their head I know while all this has happened they're like and we've got these
00:12:13,00:12:22,baskets on our head what we found dead looking like idiots this is so in their vein of like
00:12:22,00:12:26,thing you know risk assessments and and thinking about what you might need to go up into the
00:12:26,00:12:30,stratosphere you would have thought that there need to be you know there needs to be a better set of
00:12:30,00:12:34,instructions for getting in that thing and going up there and you know not smashing your mercury
00:12:34,00:12:40,and that kind of thing yeah not making holes in the vessel that you're in so I had to look at some
00:12:40,00:12:48,safety instructions for various more everyday items and these are some real bits of safety advice
00:12:48,00:12:57,so one is on a buggy where it says remove child before folding these are real there's one on a
00:12:57,00:13:05,hairdryer that said do not use all sleeping on items of clothing do not iron clothes whilst wearing
00:13:05,00:13:14,them now oh that's because everybody pointing it down yeah so what you do done it
00:13:14,00:13:23,all the time I'll notice a crease and I will just lay down on the bit of the iron board and I'll
00:13:23,00:13:28,just separate it from where I need to be that you're not the same shape as an ironing bud but you
00:13:28,00:13:32,are the same shape as your own body so it's much better to do it on yourself yeah I can't encourage
00:13:32,00:13:38,people to do that chainsaws don't hold the wrong end and a microwave and this was apparently
00:13:38,00:13:43,following a very sad experiment where this had happened and then after that they had to put
00:13:43,00:13:47,the label on because there was some litigation which said that you should have had the label on
00:13:47,00:13:51,there to begin with otherwise you know and then this woman would have known not to do it do not dry
00:13:51,00:13:57,your pets in the microwave wow is it true that there are some animals that are small enough that
00:13:57,00:14:03,they can dodge the microwave so is if you have a pet aunt if you have a pet and listen to this guy
00:14:03,00:14:10,really your poor kid I know you want a pet I know you've asked for a pet for Christmas for years now
00:14:10,00:14:18,well great news I've finally decided it's got more legs to the cat yeah the idea I think in a
00:14:18,00:14:23,microwave the microwaves go in a certain pattern yeah and the wavelength is long enough that if you
00:14:23,00:14:27,put an ant in there it will find a bit that isn't going to cook it is it you have to yeah I think
00:14:27,00:14:32,you have to have to take this yeah otherwise it's like Takashi's castle they're just going around it
00:14:32,00:14:39,it's just one extra level of unfair on the end I will say as well like don't try that at home either
00:14:39,00:14:47,don't try that home yeah okay hey guys we need to move on very soon oh and when Apollo 11 took off
00:14:47,00:14:53,NASA worked out that if the rocket exploded it would fire Shrapnel three miles away so they sat
00:14:53,00:15:02,all the VIPs 3.5 miles away to most of it very nice but you're relying on their maths aren't you yeah
00:15:02,00:15:09,otherwise it was just the VIPs they allowed other people yeah everyone else's news we've got you
00:15:09,00:15:23,front row seats okay it is time for fact number two and that is Alice thank you very much so my
00:15:23,00:15:31,fact is basically an X fact so it is that people used to think that arteries carried air not blood
00:15:31,00:15:37,and that the airways themselves were full of fluid so for a very very long time people thought that
00:15:37,00:15:42,actually blood vessels were full of just air and in fact that's what artery means say artery means
00:15:42,00:15:50,air carrier air tearing in in Greek and I find this just astonishing as an anatomist because you
00:15:50,00:15:55,don't have to do much digging around in the body to work out that there's blood in the blood vessels
00:15:55,00:16:02,and air in the airways but this just went on and on and on do we know why do we know why people thought
00:16:02,00:16:07,it I think because sometimes if you are if you're dissecting a body and you've waited a while to
00:16:07,00:16:13,dissect it then maybe the arteries could be empty but I mean it just seems really really odd that
00:16:13,00:16:18,they didn't realise and obviously it took a long time to work out that the heart was pumping blood
00:16:18,00:16:24,around the body and then it was circulating so it's kind of there's just there's just misunderstanding
00:16:24,00:16:29,upon misunderstanding and what's interesting is that it's still in the words so the fact that
00:16:29,00:16:35,artery means air carrier and and then they're they're confused about the airways as well so they call
00:16:35,00:16:42,the the trachea the original word is actually arteria trachea so they're calling it an artery but
00:16:42,00:16:48,in order to differentiate it from other what they think are air carrying vessels they call it the
00:16:48,00:16:54,rough artery so arteria trachea so we still call it trachea we just missed the artery a bit of it
00:16:54,00:16:59,but they were totally confused about the whole thing I mean a lot of it goes back to Aristotle he did
00:16:59,00:17:04,he did a lot of great work and he knew quite a bit about how bodies were put together and then he
00:17:04,00:17:11,kind of made it up so he said he reckoned that the heart was making blood and they they could see
00:17:11,00:17:15,that blood was moving through some vessels and going through the periphery but then they thought
00:17:15,00:17:19,that the body was just consuming it so they thought blood was constantly being made and consumed by the
00:17:19,00:17:24,body and then as far as he was concerned the lungs were just to cool the heart down so the heart's
00:17:24,00:17:28,working so hard it's getting really hot so it needs the lungs to cool it down also the brain is
00:17:28,00:17:32,another radiator to help cool the blood it cool the heart as well and that's all the brain is
00:17:32,00:17:38,doing it's just a cooling mechanism yeah and you're thinking from your heart to see your heart is
00:17:38,00:17:43,your seat the seat of your emotions and your and your intellect yes doing a lot that's doing a lot
00:17:43,00:17:50,yeah if today I went to see a doctor who still believed this how how much of a difference would that
00:17:50,00:17:58,make on my survival like because they knew there was still blood in there yeah actually like it was
00:17:58,00:18:03,William Harvey who found out that the heart was pumping blood around the body and a lot of people
00:18:03,00:18:09,didn't really like the idea a lot of physicians because their theory kind of worked like it worked
00:18:09,00:18:14,for them do you know what I mean so him coming up with this new way that the heart works they kind of
00:18:14,00:18:20,resisted it quite a lot of the time and he put it in his book which is in Latin so I'm not going to
00:18:20,00:18:24,read it but it was he put it right I've seen it recently I've I went into the Royal College of
00:18:24,00:18:30,Physicians and they got out the first edition of the motor cordists on the on the the motion of the
00:18:30,00:18:35,heart and the way that the blood is moved around the body and it's just incredible and what he's
00:18:35,00:18:40,worked out that nobody else has worked out before is that veins carried blood back to the heart so that
00:18:40,00:18:45,so that he was going right yes blood he's being pushed out but it's also coming back again and he said
00:18:45,00:18:50,that there's a closed loop actually but he still didn't know why he still didn't know why blood
00:18:50,00:18:54,was being pumped off to the lungs and then coming back to the heart again they could see some
00:18:54,00:18:59,connections between arteries and veins in the in the gut so that they could see that happening
00:18:59,00:19:04,at some levels but they couldn't see capillaries and then it was a cornish doctor called John Mayo
00:19:04,00:19:08,who's a who's a hero of mine I think he's fantastic and he basically went well I think something's
00:19:08,00:19:13,going on in the lungs I think the blood's getting something out of the air I think tiny particles are
00:19:13,00:19:17,coming out of the air into the blood in the lungs and that's what's going on and that was a hundred
00:19:17,00:19:22,years before anybody knew us and then in the end there is a going through but it's just inside the blood
00:19:22,00:19:28,yeah count one for Aristotle I think well but anybody was talking about he's putting
00:19:28,00:19:34,shorthand but you know William Harvey was friends with Charles the first and Charles the
00:19:34,00:19:41,first used to get him dear to using his experiments because obviously kings have lots of deer at the
00:19:41,00:19:49,disposal and Harvey was there when Charles was people had this thing called scruffular and it was
00:19:49,00:19:54,thought that the king could touch you and it would make you better and William Harvey was one
00:19:54,00:19:58,of the people who was there sort of like with a note pad going yet they got better they got better they
00:19:58,00:20:05,got better and also Charles what did he definitely did that and also well okay Charles the first
00:20:05,00:20:10,sent him to Burnley in Lancashire and because there was a report of some witches there and he had
00:20:10,00:20:17,to go to Burnley and count their nipples now was that was he volunteering for this job but was he
00:20:18,00:20:24,just sent the king got him to do it because actually Charles wasn't massively into sort of burning
00:20:24,00:20:29,witches and killing witches like his predecessors had been so he wanted to do an actual you know just
00:20:29,00:20:34,check it out whether it was happening Harvey went over said these people are all completely normal
00:20:34,00:20:38,we shouldn't be killing them and they all got pardoned by Charles the first oh why would they
00:20:38,00:20:44,have had more nipples like with a super new ring nipples was the idea if you were in which you
00:20:44,00:20:50,needed extra nipples to feed your like black cat and the devil I'm afraid there's a known fact that
00:20:50,00:20:57,which is do have a nipple on their tailbone which is where the devil feeds right sorry it's a bit
00:20:57,00:21:08,well it's just science guys no that was the belief in the 17th century was it was all a bit sort
00:21:08,00:21:11,of like fruity stuff you know basically they'll find something if you think you're which they'll
00:21:11,00:21:19,find something especially if you go to Burnley I just hear the ghost of Faraday in this room going
00:21:19,00:21:25,what's happened to my institution so when when was it at what point did we realize blood was where
00:21:25,00:21:32,it is who was that who was that person it's just it's gradual it's a really gradual process so
00:21:32,00:21:38,Galen saw that arteries did contain blood so he was a physician in the first century he was
00:21:38,00:21:44,physician to Moxawelius and he was a surgeon for the gladiators as well so he worked out yeah he
00:21:44,00:21:48,worked out that these arteries didn't have air in them but they had to they had blood in them
00:21:48,00:21:52,but he still didn't understand the circulation so yeah that comes along much later then there's a
00:21:52,00:22:01,there's an arabic physician called Ibn al-Nafis in the 13th century who works out that there's a pulmonary
00:22:01,00:22:06,loop but he doesn't link it up with the rest of the circulation so it's pulmonary
00:22:06,00:22:12,it's gradually in the lungs yeah absolutely so it's just gradual steps so we often kind of put Harvey
00:22:12,00:22:16,up there but he's standing on the shoulders of giants I mean you always are in science aren't you
00:22:16,00:22:21,yes like gradual increments there was a thing wasn't there where people thought the blood went out
00:22:21,00:22:25,let's say the blood goes out to my hand and then back to the heart and the same blood goes out
00:22:25,00:22:31,to my hand and then back to it's kind of like a big hokey cokey action of like all the blood is
00:22:31,00:22:37,going out and then back in yeah I mean this is one of the things that I'm saying Harvey's time that
00:22:37,00:22:41,there was this idea that the blood was being made constantly and the not that it was coming back
00:22:41,00:22:46,actually but it was being made in the heart and then pushed out and he was working out the volume
00:22:46,00:22:49,of blood that was being pushed out by the heart and one of his arguments is actually there's too
00:22:49,00:22:54,much blood being pushed out for the body to actually potentially you know possibly absorb this much
00:22:54,00:22:58,so it must be coming back it can't be that it's all being pushed out and then other people
00:22:58,00:23:02,thought that the liver made it they thought because if you if you kind of look at what the liver's
00:23:02,00:23:08,doing it it's it's receiving all these nutrients from the gut you know and that is what it does so
00:23:08,00:23:12,it receives all the nutrients come from the veins from the gut go to the liver and then it does
00:23:12,00:23:18,a lot of processing of that and then the idea was that that then goes to the heart gets turned into
00:23:18,00:23:25,blood somewhere and then it's all about nutrients so they just had no idea about oxygen and that being
00:23:25,00:23:29,you know one of the primary reasons of blood circulating obviously it does take nutrients
00:23:29,00:23:34,around as well but the oxygen's pretty important well yeah but also like the worst steps for people
00:23:34,00:23:39,made mistakes as well and when they realized that there was nutrients as well as oxygen going
00:23:39,00:23:46,around the body there was a guy called Richard Lauer from Cornwall who thought that he could
00:23:46,00:23:53,inject soup into the veins of dogs and that would nourish them interesting yeah what flavor
00:23:53,00:24:01,not recorded but I'm afraid it wouldn't matter either way and it doesn't work so I again do not try
00:24:01,00:24:08,that at home bad for yeah bad for the dog yeah soup in the microwave pets out of the microwave yeah
00:24:08,00:24:12,that's but that would have been before soup was differentiated into flavors that was
00:24:12,00:24:21,there was only there was just like some soup and then I think it was it was the 18 oh I want to say
00:24:21,00:24:25,1860s when we got the first I feel like you're fixating on the wrong part
00:24:25,00:24:32,can I just want we're on heart sort of innovations around the heart as well can I tell you as
00:24:32,00:24:38,have you guys had a Werner Forstmann no such an interesting scientist so he was a young German doctor
00:24:38,00:24:47,who he theorized that you could study the heart by inserting a catheter into either an artery or
00:24:47,00:24:53,a vein and and pushing it towards the heart and then taking an extra of yourself and sort of seeing
00:24:53,00:24:59,the heart in more detail basically that was that was his premise and he was a very young doctor he
00:24:59,00:25:05,was about 25 when he came up with this idea he asked his bosses can I do this to a patient no no you
00:25:05,00:25:13,can't so he says what can I do it to myself his bosses say no so at this point he goes a bit rogue
00:25:13,00:25:19,and he just asks a nurse working in his hospital I need to do this to you so to put a catheter in
00:25:19,00:25:24,and and to all the way to the heart right he tells her he's going to do it to her she's sort of
00:25:24,00:25:30,strapped to a trolley but this is the thing he's not going to do it to her he only needs the nurse
00:25:30,00:25:36,because he's so he is so junior as a doctor he doesn't have access to catheters so she has opened
00:25:36,00:25:41,the catheter cabinet for him he sort of straps it to the table and then while she's trapped
00:25:41,00:25:48,out of the table she looks over and he's doing it to himself he's pushed a catheter all the way
00:25:48,00:25:54,into touching his own heart wow stunning he's done it in completely the wrong room to take a picture
00:25:54,00:26:00,of so they they she then has to unstrap her and she has to help carry all of his clubbo and all
00:26:00,00:26:04,the attached stuff like down two flights of stairs everyone's furious everyone's shouting at him
00:26:04,00:26:12,what are you doing wow sorry what year is this 20s I think yes roughly roughly the 20s maybe
00:26:12,00:26:22,1920s 1920s so we're still on this old it was last week yeah and like even as a colleague is trying
00:26:22,00:26:27,to wrestle this thing out of him say no you can't do this this is insane he goes tada and there it is
00:26:27,00:26:34,photo is taken x-ray image of his own heart you're amazing right it doesn't really go anywhere right
00:26:34,00:26:38,his career doesn't go especially well he's a like he's a German doctor he goes through
00:26:38,00:26:43,World War II as a German army doctor nothing he thinks has really come of his his sort of ideal
00:26:43,00:26:50,those years ago and then he gets these weird phone calls in 1956 from from foreign-accented people
00:26:50,00:27:00,saying yeah he's won a Nobel Prize he's won a Nobel Prize for this because it turns out other doctors
00:27:00,00:27:06,carried on his innovations and went further with it I'm sorry I'm just I'm just laughing about the
00:27:06,00:27:11,fact that we have mentioned the Nobel Prize recently in a couple of episodes and anytime we talk
00:27:11,00:27:16,about the phone call this is like the body of of science excellence and every time that one of
00:27:16,00:27:30,the three of us go go to board it all about so rude yeah so you won the Nobel Prize that's he won
00:27:30,00:27:36,a Nobel Prize for it yeah that is amazing I didn't know that story and I've just been making a series
00:27:36,00:27:41,on the history of arts hospital and looking at all the history there because it's 900 years old
00:27:41,00:27:45,just over 900 years old but look also looking at it as a modern hospital and it's obviously a big
00:27:45,00:27:51,cardiac center here in London and and it is there's so much of what's done with people's hearts now
00:27:51,00:27:58,is using catheters so advancing catheters three arteries sticking little stents into into coronary
00:27:58,00:28:03,arteries to open up again if people are you know people have got angina and they're not getting a
00:28:03,00:28:08,good enough blood supply to their hearts so he did the groundwork for that you know his that was
00:28:08,00:28:13,that was you know his bravery sticking that catheter into into a blood vessel and working out
00:28:13,00:28:19,that you can actually get that all the way to the heart and it's even people's lives today yeah yeah
00:28:19,00:28:22,we should move on in a second I just want to give a quick shout out we mentioned Galen what an
00:28:22,00:28:28,incredible character he is the writer of his period right like that's virtually the only medical
00:28:28,00:28:34,writing that has survived to our day he was a doctor as well as you mentioned before but he also
00:28:34,00:28:38,had these amazing inventions talking about the basket hat earlier that we were talking about with
00:28:38,00:28:45,Picard he invented the helmet hangover cure so it was he said if you had a hangover just put cabbage
00:28:45,00:28:50,on your head and wear the cabbage on your head and that would cure your hangover and he didn't get
00:28:50,00:28:56,a naval phrase he was overlooked unbelievable that's to call it down I guess yeah because I think
00:28:56,00:29:02,Babe Ruth always wore a cabbage leaf underneath his hat to call his head down he's been reading Galen
00:29:02,00:29:16,it's amazing it is time for fact number three and that is Andy my fact is that theoretically
00:29:16,00:29:24,electric cars could run on kryptonite so this is a very exciting discovery of this century
00:29:26,00:29:35,the 20s the the early 2000s there's a there's a mine in Serbia and a chemical was discovered
00:29:35,00:29:42,in there called jada right and its scientific name is sodium lithium boron silicate hydroxide with
00:29:42,00:29:50,fluorine and a scientist dr. Chris Stanley he's a mineralogist he looked on the web for that formula
00:29:50,00:29:54,after this huge deposit of this stuff was found he could only find that formula in one other place
00:29:54,00:30:01,and it's in superman returns and lexelitha steals a case of it from from a museum to try and beat
00:30:01,00:30:06,Superman whatever but basically this stuff jada right is a building block of lithium you can
00:30:06,00:30:12,refine lithium from it and this quantity of it in this mine in Serbia is so big that it can produce
00:30:12,00:30:20,I think 90% of the entirety of Europe's target of electric car batteries right it's a huge quantity
00:30:20,00:30:24,and yet the really weird thing is this stuff jada right is only found in this one mine in Serbia
00:30:25,00:30:29,yes it's never been found anywhere else in the world and it's basically the chemical recipe to
00:30:29,00:30:36,produce it is is very precise it's absolutely crazy so you need to find an alkaline rich terminal
00:30:36,00:30:43,lake and some lithium rich volcanic glass and while those two things are together they have to
00:30:43,00:30:50,transform clay materials into very specific rare crystalline structures I don't understand any of
00:30:50,00:30:54,that but this has been found out quite recently I think this year actually by two scientists called
00:30:54,00:30:59,Chris Stanley and Mike Rumsy but what that means now that they've worked that out we don't we don't
00:30:59,00:31:06,necessarily have to go to jada in Serbia to get it we can make it ourselves so Superman returns
00:31:06,00:31:12,don't know if you've seen it oh yeah it's this what's remarkable is that is where kryptonite was given
00:31:12,00:31:17,the chemical description the makers of the film brought someone in to come up with what it would
00:31:17,00:31:24,be made up of and that happened and was released only I think a few months before then the people who
00:31:24,00:31:29,released what jargonite was made up of released it so it was right it was like it was like when deep
00:31:29,00:31:35,impact an armageddon came out at the same time it was like no one had planned that yeah it's pretty
00:31:35,00:31:42,crazy and also in Superman returns there's it's the first Superman movie since the fourth Superman
00:31:42,00:31:49,movie and the final words in Superman 4 are I'll see you in 20 and then Superman returns was made 20
00:31:49,00:31:56,years later and not on purpose Alice you're giving me a look like you're saying keep talking about
00:31:56,00:32:01,Superman returns Dan and it's got to be on purpose surely you would think right but no apparently
00:32:01,00:32:07,it was so nice to see you on home territory finally Dan and none of this is anything to do with
00:32:07,00:32:14,krypton which is a completely innocuous noble gas which is an actual gas that's an actual element
00:32:14,00:32:19,and that was found in 1898 it's very unreactive with almost everything but you do occasionally
00:32:19,00:32:25,get it between the glass and double-pained windows do you yeah that's a use for krypton I mean don't
00:32:25,00:32:31,go don't rush home and just a warning Alice if you ever have a dinner at Andy's house this is
00:32:31,00:32:38,the kind of chat you get he takes you to his windows you know there's a bit of krypton it's really
00:32:38,00:32:45,interesting oh it was found it's so cool so William Bramsey and Morris Travers they Bramsey found
00:32:45,00:32:52,Argonne then he went on a bit of a streak identified helium and krypton and neon and xenon and radon
00:32:52,00:32:58,she's working the whole family of noble gases that only feels like he's learned how to do one thing
00:32:58,00:33:02,though oh like you don't like if your lip picks when someone's really good at swimming and then
00:33:02,00:33:12,when my 10 gold medals and it's like you're only good at swimming this is why James was fired from
00:33:12,00:33:21,the commentating job for the another medal what was it for oh swimming again swimming in a slightly
00:33:21,00:33:31,different way well done so apparently Batman keeps a bit of kryptonite in his belt at all time get
00:33:31,00:33:35,out yeah in case Superman goes evil again in case he goes evil again now where there are theories
00:33:35,00:33:40,that Superman gave him the kryptonite as a sort of insurance policy to say you can trust me I'm
00:33:40,00:33:50,you're okay Alice you're gonna I've never made a guest look like they want to leave the show
00:33:50,00:33:58,as much as you in 11 years of doing this quick so what else electric vehicles thank you yeah I got
00:33:58,00:34:06,them do you reckon they sat on fire more or less than normal petrol cars catch fire yeah oh well
00:34:06,00:34:11,they catch fire every 15 minutes I think I have read that you know yeah well actually like if you
00:34:11,00:34:16,look in the news as always like another car sat on fire electric car but there was a study done
00:34:16,00:34:22,this year that found they sat on fire much less it's about 20 times less than a petrol car they sat on
00:34:22,00:34:27,fire but the problem is that the fires are much more spectacular when they go up because lithium
00:34:27,00:34:34,batteries burn very very very hot and also once you put them out they can just sat on fire again
00:34:34,00:34:39,later really let's say they go into some water as well like the water and lithium reacts very badly
00:34:39,00:34:45,together and so what they do is when you if your car has been on fire in some departments in
00:34:45,00:34:51,America they'll submerge them in fresh water for 24 hours before they're certain that they
00:34:51,00:34:55,definitely won't catch fire again oh wow I am always a bit worried about this because at home we've
00:34:55,00:35:01,got an electric car and we've also got little RC cars as well what are they selling it little radio
00:35:01,00:35:08,control cars and they've got these batteries that you have to charge in a metal box so when I'm
00:35:08,00:35:13,charging out the batteries for my radio control car it's in a metal box when I'm charging at my
00:35:13,00:35:19,other car the actual car I just plug it in oh yeah I don't put it in a metal box the microwave
00:35:19,00:35:28,I think that's fine get all those ants out there can I tell you my favorite electric vehicle of the
00:35:28,00:35:33,year okay all right it's over the top gear job it's a really cool one okay no it's really cool
00:35:33,00:35:38,there's a big Australian mining company called Fortescue and they're on a huge sort of net zero
00:35:38,00:35:42,drive at the moment because you know mining is pretty bad for the environment in general a lot of
00:35:42,00:35:48,big vehicles burning lots of diesel blah blah blah Fortescue are testing out loads of electric stuff
00:35:48,00:35:52,at the moment and trying to get it all into their fleet one of the things they're testing is an
00:35:52,00:36:01,infinite train is that the circle line is they just the circle line it's a battery powered electric
00:36:01,00:36:07,train right it loads up with the load of iron ore I think whatever they're getting out of the ground
00:36:07,00:36:13,right it carries it to where it needs to be next you know loaded onto the next bit of the journey
00:36:13,00:36:16,right but it's it's on the slight downhill gradient because it's come to the sort of the top of
00:36:16,00:36:22,a big open cast mine so it goes downhill it does it breaks and it does regenerative breaking
00:36:22,00:36:27,to recharge the battery as it descends and then by the time it's got to the bottom and unloaded
00:36:27,00:36:33,all the stuff it was carrying it has gained enough charge to go all the way back around to the top
00:36:34,00:36:41,and get filled up again can you explain entropy to Andrew please at some point you're going to
00:36:41,00:36:47,lease some energy in terms of friction oh you'll top it up you'll top it up no no but it's because
00:36:47,00:36:52,it's so much heavier on the way down the regenerative breaking on the way down yeah it does charge
00:36:52,00:36:56,the battery up more than uh maybe not more than enough you'll need to charge it occasionally okay
00:36:56,00:37:02,I guess the laws of physics aka Alice that give me a bit of a look and that's fine I respect
00:37:02,00:37:10,I respect those laws what a cool alias for you Alice the laws of physics it's not pretty good
00:37:10,00:37:13,we need to move on to our final house I haven't even told you about my second favorite electric car
00:37:13,00:37:22,of the year it's a car that can it's thank you guys scattered scattered scattered but I'll take it
00:37:22,00:37:29,look mercury spealing pure this is a car it isn't electric car as well that's kind of incidental
00:37:29,00:37:36,to why it's so cool it can go upside down okay it genuinely can and the laws of physics don't have
00:37:36,00:37:43,anything to say about it unless I promise I think all cars can go upside down like if you drive
00:37:43,00:37:48,them particularly badly great point don't they say they're about f1 cars as well that when they're
00:37:48,00:37:52,in tunnels they go so fast that you can in theory drive out of the thing so really good cars and
00:37:52,00:37:56,especially formula one cars they exert they have a lot of downforce right yeah and the reason that's
00:37:56,00:38:03,good is more grip on the road this particular one is a fan car right it sucks air out from beneath it
00:38:03,00:38:09,there's basically got a skirt all the way around it but a very very efficient skirt it's a hovercraft
00:38:09,00:38:20,it's a hover caft it's a hot yeah yes um so the the car weighs a thousand kilos and it can
00:38:20,00:38:25,generate two thousand kilos of downforce and I've watched the training the sort of video where
00:38:25,00:38:30,they tested out earlier this year it drives onto this platform the platform just revolves upside
00:38:30,00:38:39,down right and the car stays okay and what is the use well um double double capacity on the black
00:38:39,00:38:47,wall tunnel easy yes I don't have a hovercraft once as well this is on coasty so they found all these
00:38:47,00:38:50,kind of like weird experiments to me to do so there's the one where they attached all the bleans
00:38:50,00:38:54,to me and tried to inflate me into here and then there's another one where they gave me a hovercraft
00:38:54,00:39:00,to drive myself and I was just on my own in this hovercraft fantastic um and I was driving and obviously
00:39:00,00:39:03,the nice thing about hovercraft is that you don't have to be on the ground you can be on the water
00:39:03,00:39:08,so I so I was on a beach obviously it was a coast it was everything had to be the seaside
00:39:08,00:39:13,and I just went off the beach on and went over the waves and went out to see and I realised I didn't
00:39:13,00:39:19,need I to turn around oh no I was just disappearing off into this because they filmed me because the
00:39:19,00:39:25,old goose picked hard of BBC two they thought it was quite amazing and then and there was a bit of a panic
00:39:25,00:39:30,and what happened in the end well eventually I did really I did work in it but it took me a while
00:39:30,00:39:34,and I had to kind of overcome that moment of panic and go right I must actually be able to do this
00:39:34,00:39:43,you didn't just go right around the world I thought they were only gigantic things with you know
00:39:43,00:39:49,yeah like a person hovercraft yeah amazing we used to in Hong Kong where I grew up to get from
00:39:49,00:39:55,Calo inside and various other islands you'd go by hovercraft and when I was born my dad
00:39:55,00:40:00,went back to Discovery Bay which is where we lived and he went to get back stuff that we needed
00:40:00,00:40:06,because it was a sort of emergency birth and so he he went back home and he was so tired that he
00:40:06,00:40:10,had an hour sleep got his stuff and came back to Hong Kong islands sitting on the hovercraft he
00:40:10,00:40:15,suddenly was really ill because he was so tired so he said can I just step outside and they said yes
00:40:15,00:40:20,so he went outside the back and he was breathing and he noticed that the hovercraft lifted
00:40:20,00:40:25,and started slowly moving so he went to go back inside and the door was locked and he traveled
00:40:25,00:40:31,the journey of Discovery Bay to Hong Kong which was about 20 30 minutes on the back of a hovercraft
00:40:31,00:40:38,holding on oh my god no one knew to let him back in the person forgot that they let him out
00:40:38,00:40:43,he did the entire journey on the back of the hovercraft and then when he landed there he fell
00:40:43,00:40:48,down onto the dock an ambulance was called they were bringing him to a local hospital he said take
00:40:48,00:40:54,me to Adventist that's where my wife is we've just had a baby took him there he got into the room
00:40:54,00:40:58,because he was like I know which room I'm going to so suddenly they're looking for an escape patient
00:40:58,00:41:02,because he just wandered off went into the room kicked my mum out of the bed and fell asleep
00:41:06,00:41:18,that's an origin story that Superman could be proud of it's time for our final fact of the show
00:41:18,00:41:24,and that is my fact my fact this week is that Pokemon was invented so that others could experience
00:41:24,00:41:32,the joy of insect hunting this is this is really cool so Pokemon was created by a man called Satoshi
00:41:32,00:41:40,Tajiri and as a kid he was an insect collector he was known as Dr. Bug and all the students would
00:41:40,00:41:44,look at his collections and they would trade bugs anyone else he was an entomologist an amateur
00:41:44,00:41:50,entomologist they would trade bugs with each other and he then was also very much into video games
00:41:50,00:41:56,he found a mentor who was the man who created Mario and created the legends of Zelda so like what a
00:41:56,00:42:01,team this guy then goes do you know I would love because all the areas that he grew up in as a kid
00:42:01,00:42:07,in Japan were being paved over all the bits where you could find insects were now no longer with any
00:42:07,00:42:12,nature around them and he thought I want to teach that experience of what it's like to be a collector
00:42:12,00:42:18,to understand the joy and so that was Pokemon it was him trying to teach kids the joy of collecting
00:42:18,00:42:25,pretty cool so I love that that's amazing yeah very cool when was that done do you say um it was
00:42:25,00:42:33,1996 96 it came out yeah because actually the number of people collecting insects has plunged
00:42:33,00:42:38,since the 1990s really and the articles I've read about it don't mention that people are doing
00:42:38,00:42:45,Pokemon instead I guess is possible but the problem is that like people are collect I mean maybe
00:42:45,00:42:50,it's not great to go around collecting insects I'm not judging on that but the decline of collecting
00:42:50,00:42:56,insects as a hobby is making conservation much more difficult because entomologists they used to
00:42:56,00:43:01,be given like hundreds of butterflies by people when they die they're like what we're going to do
00:43:01,00:43:04,with this we'll give them to the natural history museum or whatever but now they're having fewer
00:43:04,00:43:08,and fewer collections given to them right and it's citizen science as well that's probably
00:43:08,00:43:13,useful records and it's like that I think because I think there was another co-founder of Pokemon
00:43:13,00:43:20,Unichim Masuda also spend much of his time as a child collecting insects yeah so both of them did
00:43:20,00:43:27,yeah and uh it's so clearly and what was that 1970s Osaka and Tokyo it's just a huge hobby yeah
00:43:27,00:43:32,and but like Miyamoto who was the guy who invented Mario and Zelda Zelda basically came about because
00:43:32,00:43:36,he used to go he loved finding caves and going into caves and that gave him the idea of a fantasy
00:43:36,00:43:43,adventure so weirdly nature has informed the biggest video games there and I'm pretty sure I'm
00:43:43,00:43:48,right in saying that Pokemon is the biggest entertainment franchise of all time nothing comes close
00:43:48,00:43:55,really yeah Avengers and that whole Marvel franchise doesn't come close Mario doesn't even come close
00:43:55,00:44:03,it's Pokemon superman returns not insect collecting has given us a lot it has given us a great deal
00:44:03,00:44:09,the idea of daylight saving this was first coined by a young boy called George Hudson who was an
00:44:09,00:44:15,avid uh Kiwi insect collector and he worked in the post office and there wasn't much time in his day
00:44:15,00:44:22,to collect insects because he had a job and he hated it and so he wrote to the Wellington philosophical
00:44:22,00:44:27,society this is in the 1880s I believe hey during summer why don't we just shift the clocks back two
00:44:27,00:44:32,hours so we've all we've all got more time to go out and collect insects which we all love doing right
00:44:32,00:44:38,and um I don't think it took off sadly but I think he was the first to propose it as a as a notion
00:44:38,00:44:43,and specifically right I mean I'm I'm interested in this kind of insect collection thing and the
00:44:43,00:44:47,fact that that's dropped off because if that means killing insects that's probably a good idea yeah
00:44:47,00:44:51,I wonder if more people are fated golfing them because obviously we've got these amazing apps now
00:44:51,00:44:55,where you can fated golf insects and they'll identify them for you so I wonder if there's been a
00:44:55,00:45:00,kind of rise in that and that's a better way of collecting yes yeah it's like bird spotting isn't it
00:45:00,00:45:06,it's just seeing it and writing down and trusting that that's a true account of what you're saying
00:45:06,00:45:10,I think that's probably right uh yeah I really like Pokemon and the thing is uh well I've been asking
00:45:10,00:45:14,my son about it because he was he was madly into Pokemon but he said I'm not allowed to mention that
00:45:14,00:45:20,now because he's almost a teenager and it's not cool anymore um but the other cool thing that he
00:45:20,00:45:26,isn't too is nice such thing as a fish he's an enormous fan of nice yeah um but he told me that
00:45:26,00:45:31,there were one thousand and twenty five species and I didn't know this actually because um I didn't
00:45:31,00:45:35,know how many species are there but I didn't know that they evolved and I thought that was really
00:45:35,00:45:40,cool about it as well so I didn't know it was inspired by biology and insect collecting but I really
00:45:40,00:45:45,liked the fact it had this kind of biological idea wave and into it that over time those species
00:45:45,00:45:50,could change into other different forms there is a cancer gene called Pokemon or however there was
00:45:50,00:46:01,it was called p.o.k. erythroid myeloid ontogenic gene so it's p.o.k.e.m. or n um but then um Pokemon USA
00:46:01,00:46:04,threatened to lawsuit and they had to rename it it's now called
00:46:04,00:46:10,glue against the cancer gene no it gets p.o.k.e. I guess against the scientists.
00:46:10,00:46:14,There's a trend doing this though isn't there's a trend for naming genes after
00:46:14,00:46:20,yeah like Sonic the Hedgehog on Hedgehog genes yeah yeah but Pokemon USA we're not happy about this
00:46:20,00:46:29,and so it's now called z b t b seven oh orang in Japan you can sign legal documents with your
00:46:29,00:46:34,favorite Pokemon what do you mean um so they have this thing where you can sign your name
00:46:34,00:46:40,or you can have a thing called a hanko which is a personal seal so it's like um what would you
00:46:40,00:46:46,call that wax seal not a wax seal but like an ink block kind of thing oh yeah um so like a stamp
00:46:46,00:46:52,a stamp that was the word I was looking for so yeah an ink stamp they're called hanko and they
00:46:52,00:46:58,have only certain ones that you're allowed to use you gotta just use any old thing but very recently
00:46:58,00:47:04,in the last ten years they changed it so Pokemon's allowed as well so if you have a favorite Pokemon
00:47:04,00:47:09,and you have one of these stamps you can sign your probably if I was playing Pokemon too much made
00:47:09,00:47:15,the boss papers right with a hanko you know if you depole your name to something else but then you get
00:47:15,00:47:19,a criminal record you have to stick with that name oh yeah if you get a criminal record are you
00:47:19,00:47:25,not allowed to evolve in your Pokemon with your stamp you stuck as as charmander your whole time
00:47:25,00:47:34,that would be the criminals I'm sorry I'm really lost oh no some of them evolve evil no I don't know
00:47:34,00:47:40,what's going on it's okay it's okay it's okay sometimes to not know I'm gonna have some I'm gonna
00:47:40,00:47:45,have some questions afterwards Alice's sign if that's all right um yeah there was a woman recently
00:47:45,00:47:51,who changed her name to Pudzie Bear and then she sorry we're just on name changes now and she's
00:47:51,00:47:57,um she's been turned down for a passport and she's really annoyed about it yeah but you're not allowed
00:47:57,00:48:06,to have something covering your face like an eye patch lovely um on that insect collecting I was
00:48:06,00:48:12,reading about someone called Liz Fowler um in 2016 she went to St Helena to look for something called
00:48:12,00:48:18,Baza Levski's Crane Fly and they weren't sure if it was extinct on that no one had seen one for
00:48:18,00:48:24,45 years and why she was driving down the highway one of them flew through the window and landed on
00:48:24,00:48:34,her hand so cool uh and in 2014 there was a guy called Javier oh he was called Javier he was called
00:48:34,00:48:44,Javier his surname was Juanca now in we see that that is that's how you say it oh that's that's
00:48:44,00:48:50,pronounced Juanca right out it's there's a there's a group of people in Peru called the
00:48:50,00:48:56,Juanca people and there's a football team called Departivo Juanca oh is that the same name after the same
00:48:56,00:49:02,name after the same bunch of Juanca anyway yeah yeah yeah again we're fixated at the wrong
00:49:02,00:49:07,point of this fact yeah which is that while Javier was waiting for a bus and his pockets
00:49:11,00:49:16,he looked to the tree on his right and found the new species a spider mite which is what he was studying
00:49:16,00:49:20,so he was literally just waiting for a bus and there it was so cool so I think that's one of the
00:49:20,00:49:24,cool things about insect collecting is sometimes they just literally land in your lap yeah it
00:49:24,00:49:28,is amazing and but yeah it's fortune favors the prepared mind yeah you know if you hadn't been studying
00:49:28,00:49:33,spider mice there's no way he would so what I find very interesting about insect discovery yeah it's
00:49:33,00:49:38,another of these things kind of related to your fact honest about what what we knew when and the
00:49:38,00:49:44,misconceptions and so there's a very cool early entomologist her name was Maria Cibilla Mary and
00:49:44,00:49:50,she was brought born in Frankfurt in 1647 and she's the woman who absolutely nailed the evidence
00:49:50,00:49:56,that butterflies used to be caterpillars and vice versa oh right yeah and before that I think
00:49:56,00:50:03,it was quite open to debate because because it's mental because it's mental the idea that there's
00:50:03,00:50:08,a caterpillar and then it goes in a little cocoon and then it mushes its whole body up what comes out
00:50:08,00:50:12,like a beautiful butterfly yeah yeah it's crazy it is crazy because they didn't have pokemon to
00:50:12,00:50:17,sort of explain that science to them at the time but again it's one of these things it bit it seems
00:50:17,00:50:21,crazy but also it seems really really easy to work it out I mean it's like the whole thing about
00:50:21,00:50:28,Archie's carrying air you just go well yeah just keep it in a box and then one day there's a butterfly
00:50:28,00:50:31,but that's what she did she did it for several generations and I don't know why several generations
00:50:31,00:50:37,in a row you think as you say you think one would do it but no no butterflies from egg to adult again
00:50:37,00:50:42,does it else does it blow your mind in the way that I think it blows ours and possibly everyone else
00:50:42,00:50:46,that that can happen with a butterfly that it can go from this one state to this kind of soupy
00:50:46,00:50:51,goop and then become the other thing or does that just make sense it is amazing but I also think I
00:50:51,00:50:56,mean I'm absolutely obsessed with embryology and I've written books about embryology I teach embryology
00:50:56,00:51:02,and just this idea that we've gone each of us have gone from being a single cell you know
00:51:02,00:51:06,that we're all sitting here being trillions of cells it's not metamorphosis it's not the same as
00:51:06,00:51:11,insects but we've gone through this amazing transformation where you turn into something which looks
00:51:11,00:51:16,like a ball of cells and then it looks like a fluid filled ball of cells and it's a bit like a sausage
00:51:16,00:51:21,and then it grazes little stumpy arms and legs and then it's heart starts to be and it's just amazing
00:51:21,00:51:28,it's this incredible transformation and it involves a lot of origami like folding and and cells
00:51:28,00:51:34,moving around say migration of cells inside the body as well it's it's just incredible yeah it blows
00:51:34,00:51:46,my mind yeah cool I mean you could just set that but that this how you treat all your guests that
00:51:46,00:51:55,such such a dick such a dick oh my god do you know I you get to do the coolest job in the world by
00:51:55,00:52:01,the way which is you you get to go and see things that have been in the ground that have no one has
00:52:01,00:52:05,seen for sometimes hundreds of thousands of years millions of years I mean it's an astonishing thing
00:52:05,00:52:10,finding fossils finding all bones I know you've written a bunch of books about that there was one
00:52:10,00:52:14,because you probably can't collect them in the way that insect collectors keep them because there's
00:52:14,00:52:19,you've got to they belong to the country right and they have to go to a museum and yeah again it's
00:52:19,00:52:23,the experiences and the and the photographs and I came across a photograph myself the other day
00:52:23,00:52:32,holding LB1 the skull of the of homophysiancists from Lurangbura Cave in Indonesia and you know
00:52:32,00:52:37,things like that and it's incredible I remember doing that I was filming incredible human journey
00:52:37,00:52:44,for the BBC back in 2008 and turned up in Jakarta and it was talking to the curators of the museum
00:52:44,00:52:49,there and they said you know who are you what do you do and I said well I'm a biological
00:52:49,00:52:55,scientist and they said okay here's the coverage with LB1 in you can lay out the the fossils are not
00:52:55,00:53:00,it was just incredible yeah real privilege I read there's a thing that's in your latest book it's
00:53:00,00:53:07,in the prologue and it's just so cool this is 20 years ago you were hanging on the side of a cliff
00:53:07,00:53:13,and it's because this cliff kept dropping bones down onto the beach below because it was a cemetery
00:53:13,00:53:18,built on the edge of a cliff and the cliff has been eroding so as it grows yeah
00:53:18,00:53:24,the bones slowly emerge and drop down and you were I mean I just love where the the extra stories
00:53:24,00:53:29,to where collections are being made from that would be a collection of you know cliff drop bones
00:53:29,00:53:34,and it was an unnamed cemetery and that all relied on just ordinary people you know walking
00:53:34,00:53:38,on the beach and you know noticing that among the seaweed and bits of sea glass and whatever
00:53:38,00:53:43,else there were the occasional human bone great grief would you get like half a coffin poking out
00:53:43,00:53:47,and it was kind of the sort of yeah it's it was weird it was very ancient cemetery it was kind of
00:53:47,00:53:52,seventh century so it wasn't there weren't coffins it was a type of grave called a kissed grave where
00:53:52,00:53:57,you almost build the coffin in the ground so you dig the shaft down and then you put slabs of stone
00:53:57,00:54:02,and then you lay the body in so what we saw when we when we cleared all the undergrowth or overgrowth
00:54:02,00:54:08,they were the cliff edge away were these were these kind of perpendicular slabs of rocks sticking
00:54:08,00:54:12,out of a sandy rock face so it was kind of like red sandstone so they shouldn't have been there
00:54:12,00:54:17,well they weren't naturally there they they were part of these kiss graves yeah so we rescued
00:54:17,00:54:22,the bits of bone that were just dropping out and then laughed it there but we did usefully map the
00:54:22,00:54:27,extent of the cemetery above ground as well using geophysical equipment to scan the ground yeah very
00:54:27,00:54:32,cool this is so cool now it is amazing and we've just made another series of digging for Britain and
00:54:32,00:54:36,and you know that's just such a joy because it's current archaeology and it's what's just come out
00:54:36,00:54:40,to the ground and there are some oh my god I don't know I'm allowed to talk about it yeah maybe I can
00:54:40,00:54:47,there's this absolutely amazing find which is an iron age find and it is a type of trumpet from
00:54:47,00:54:53,the iron age where nobody's ever found a complete one and we have a complete one from Britain and it
00:54:53,00:55:01,is utterly astonishing it's amazing amazing that's very cool and the archaeologists when they started
00:55:01,00:55:04,excavating we're like oh we think we've got a bit of this thing called a carnix and then they were
00:55:04,00:55:08,excavating a bit more going we think maybe there's a bit more of it and they lifted it in a block
00:55:08,00:55:14,because it's very fragile really fragile ancient bronze work and they took it to your hospital to
00:55:14,00:55:19,x-ray it and then MRI scan it and of course you know that was an incredibly exciting day because they're
