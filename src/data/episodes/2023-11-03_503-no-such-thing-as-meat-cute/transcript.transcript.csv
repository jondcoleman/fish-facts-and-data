00:00:02,00:00:04,"- Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode"
00:00:04,00:00:07,"of No Six Things of Fish, where we were joined"
00:00:07,00:00:11,"by the incredibly funny, amazing, Maisie Adam."
00:00:11,00:00:15,"Now anyone who is familiar with our parent TV show, QI,"
00:00:15,00:00:17,will know all about Maisie.
00:00:17,00:00:19,She's burst onto the scene in the last few years
00:00:19,00:00:21,and it is no exaggeration to say
00:00:21,00:00:23,that I think she is the funniest newcomer
00:00:23,00:00:26,that we've had on QI over the last few years.
00:00:26,00:00:27,She's absolutely brilliant.
00:00:27,00:00:30,It was a great fun doing this show with her.
00:00:30,00:00:32,"If you'd like to learn anything more about Maisie,"
00:00:32,00:00:34,then the best way to find out what she's doing
00:00:34,00:00:37,"is to go to her website, which is MaisieAdam.com."
00:00:37,00:00:41,M-A-I-S-I-E-A-D-A-M.
00:00:41,00:00:42,One thing I should quickly mention
00:00:42,00:00:47,is that Maisie mentions Ethan in this show.
00:00:47,00:00:49,That was a reference to something that happened
00:00:49,00:00:51,"before the microphones came on, but I had to keep it in."
00:00:51,00:00:52,"So just to let you know,"
00:00:52,00:00:57,Ethan is one of the QILs who does a lot of our tech stuff.
00:00:57,00:00:59,"If you are a Clubfish member,"
00:00:59,00:01:02,"you might remember his episode of ""Meet the Elves"""
00:01:02,00:01:07,where he gave us a fiendish question that we had to solve.
00:01:07,00:01:09,"We do those ""Meet the Elves"" shows every now and then"
00:01:09,00:01:10,on Clubfish.
00:01:10,00:01:13,"It's one very good reason, one of many in fact,"
00:01:13,00:01:14,that you should subscribe.
00:01:14,00:01:17,"And if you'd like to do that, then you can go to, of course,"
00:01:17,00:01:20,no such thing as a fish.com/apple
00:01:20,00:01:24,and no such thing as a fish.com/patreon.
00:01:24,00:01:27,"Anyway, one final thing before we do the show,"
00:01:27,00:01:31,today's episode marks the end of our nine months
00:01:31,00:01:33,of Anna Replacement shows.
00:01:33,00:01:34,"Yes, you got it."
00:01:34,00:01:36,"Next week, she will be back."
00:01:36,00:01:38,Anna will be back on the podcast.
00:01:38,00:01:40,"So whatever you do, don't miss that episode."
00:01:40,00:01:42,Listen to it 10 times.
00:01:42,00:01:44,You want her to see the figures boosting up
00:01:44,00:01:46,when she comes back on the show.
00:01:46,00:01:47,"But in the meantime,"
00:01:47,00:01:49,really hope you enjoy this show with Maisie.
00:01:49,00:01:53,And all that's left to say is on with the podcast.
00:01:54,00:01:56,(upbeat music)
00:01:56,00:02:10,"- Hello, and welcome to another episode"
00:02:10,00:02:12,"of No Such Thing as a Fish,"
00:02:12,00:02:16,a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Hoburn.
00:02:16,00:02:17,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:02:17,00:02:19,"I'm sitting here with James Harkin,"
00:02:19,00:02:21,"Andrew Hunter Murray, and Maisie Adam."
00:02:21,00:02:22,"And once again,"
00:02:22,00:02:24,we have gathered around the microphones
00:02:24,00:02:26,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.
00:02:26,00:02:29,"And in no particular order, here we go."
00:02:29,00:02:33,"Starting with fact number one, and that is Maisie."
00:02:33,00:02:34,"- Okay, here we go."
00:02:34,00:02:39,The first fizzy drink tasted of urine.
00:02:39,00:02:40,Do with that what you will.
00:02:40,00:02:42,Do with that what you will.
00:02:42,00:02:44,"- Not drink it, that's first of all."
00:02:44,00:02:45,- So it was Fanta.
00:02:45,00:02:47,"No, sorry, that's what mankind."
00:02:47,00:02:48,"- Oh, to slam."
00:02:48,00:02:49,- To slam.
00:02:50,00:02:53,- Expect a cease and desist from Fanta offices.
00:02:53,00:02:54,- What a slam on a soft drink
00:02:54,00:02:56,that was invented for the Nazis.
00:02:56,00:02:58,- Was it really Fanta?
00:02:58,00:02:59,- I believe it was.
00:02:59,00:02:59,- It was.
00:02:59,00:03:01,"- But what a good target for me to pick, really, I suppose."
00:03:01,00:03:02,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:03:02,00:03:05,"- If you were going to kick one, yeah, Fanta's the one."
00:03:05,00:03:07,"- I think they couldn't get American soft drinks,"
00:03:07,00:03:09,and so they had to make their own.
00:03:09,00:03:12,"And it wasn't the Nazis, Hitler wasn't on the floor,"
00:03:12,00:03:14,"sorting it out himself,"
00:03:14,00:03:16,but it was made during the Nazi regime.
00:03:16,00:03:19,"- Oh, okay, by Nazis."
00:03:19,00:03:21,"- No, by Nazis, for Nazis."
00:03:21,00:03:24,"- That was the slogan, oh God."
00:03:24,00:03:27,But the first fizzy drink was invented
00:03:27,00:03:30,in my hometown of Leeds by a man called Joseph Priestley.
00:03:30,00:03:33,"But crucially, it tasted of urine."
00:03:33,00:03:34,- Because people in Leeds--
00:03:34,00:03:36,- We know what we like and we like what we know.
00:03:36,00:03:39,"- Here's the crucial question, though."
00:03:39,00:03:43,"It tasted of urine, but did it have urine in it?"
00:03:43,00:03:44,"- Yes, it did."
00:03:44,00:03:46,So how did he invent this?
00:03:46,00:03:47,How did he invent this work?
00:03:47,00:03:50,"- Accidentally, as all best things come about."
00:03:50,00:03:52,"Accidentally, it was at this brewery,"
00:03:52,00:03:54,he basically accidentally discovered
00:03:54,00:03:57,"the act of carbonating water, right?"
00:03:57,00:04:01,"He was like a human soda stream, but by accident."
00:04:01,00:04:02,"- Right, brilliant."
00:04:02,00:04:06,So he's worked out how to carbonate water.
00:04:06,00:04:08,And then what he does is he makes a machine
00:04:08,00:04:11,where you can get the CO2 and you can squeeze it
00:04:11,00:04:13,into some water and it'll make it fizzy.
00:04:13,00:04:17,"But as part of that machine, he had a pig's bladder."
00:04:17,00:04:18,- Okay.
00:04:18,00:04:18,- Just on hand.
00:04:18,00:04:19,- Just on hand.
00:04:19,00:04:21,"In those days, it was quite common to have pigs' bladders."
00:04:21,00:04:23,"You know, you used to play football with pigs' bladders."
00:04:23,00:04:26,It was part of day-to-day life.
00:04:26,00:04:27,- Everyone had a pig's bladder on them.
00:04:27,00:04:29,Like a pen nowadays.
00:04:29,00:04:30,(laughing)
00:04:30,00:04:31,- Can I borrow your pigs' bladder?
00:04:31,00:04:32,- Yeah.
00:04:32,00:04:33,"- Dan, can I borrow a pig's bladder?"
00:04:33,00:04:34,- This one's been chewed.
00:04:34,00:04:35,(laughing)
00:04:35,00:04:38,So he had a pig's bladder as part of the system.
00:04:38,00:04:42,"And he gave one of his glasses of water, fizzy water,"
00:04:42,00:04:45,to a friend called John Nooth.
00:04:45,00:04:48,"And John Nooth said, ""This tastes like piss."""
00:04:48,00:04:50,"Like, you can't sell this to people"
00:04:50,00:04:52,"because it tastes disgusting, it tastes like piss."
00:04:52,00:04:54,And he thought that it tasted like piss
00:04:54,00:04:57,because it had been squeezed through this bladder.
00:04:57,00:05:00,"Now, Priestly couldn't taste the piss in his own water."
00:05:00,00:05:02,He thought that it tasted absolutely fine.
00:05:02,00:05:02,- Okay.
00:05:02,00:05:04,- And he claimed that Nooth's servants
00:05:04,00:05:06,were maybe urinating in his drinks
00:05:06,00:05:08,because he was such a bad boss.
00:05:08,00:05:09,- Why?
00:05:09,00:05:10,"- Really, it was a rift between."
00:05:10,00:05:11,- It really was.
00:05:11,00:05:13,"You know, this is sharing your scientific discovery"
00:05:13,00:05:15,"with a colleague, like Nooth, that's a big deal."
00:05:15,00:05:16,- Yeah.
00:05:16,00:05:18,"- But Nooth said, he wrote a paper,"
00:05:18,00:05:20,"he didn't even quietly say to Priestly,"
00:05:20,00:05:22,"""I think this tastes a bit pissy."""
00:05:22,00:05:25,"He wrote a paper for the Royal Society saying,"
00:05:25,00:05:26,"""In some trials, which I have made"
00:05:26,00:05:27,"""with Dr. Priestly's apparatus,"
00:05:27,00:05:29,"""it always happened that the water acquired"
00:05:29,00:05:31,"""and urinous flavor."""
00:05:31,00:05:32,(laughing)
00:05:32,00:05:32,"- That's bad, isn't it?"
00:05:32,00:05:35,- And it was so predominant that it could not be swallowed
00:05:35,00:05:36,without some degree of reluctance.
00:05:36,00:05:38,- And he didn't run that by Priestly first.
00:05:38,00:05:39,- No.
00:05:39,00:05:40,"- Just going, ""Can I just double check?"
00:05:40,00:05:42,"""I'm not the only one tasting weed here."""
00:05:42,00:05:45,"- I'm glad you didn't, like, you know, you've got B.O.,"
00:05:45,00:05:47,"and instead of your friends telling you you've got B.O.,"
00:05:47,00:05:49,"they go to the Royal Society, and that's pretty bad."
00:05:49,00:05:50,"- Yeah, that's amazing."
00:05:50,00:05:53,"- Priestly claimed that many ladies had tried the water,"
00:05:53,00:05:56,and nobody had complained about the urinous flavor.
00:05:56,00:05:58,- He's not looking good for Nooth here.
00:05:58,00:06:00,- So does history tell us whether or not
00:06:00,00:06:01,his servants were pissing?
00:06:01,00:06:02,"- Well, we don't know."
00:06:02,00:06:03,- We don't know.
00:06:03,00:06:04,- That seems unlikely.
00:06:04,00:06:05,"- But no, and then no one else reported"
00:06:05,00:06:06,the urin flavor outside of him?
00:06:06,00:06:08,"- Well, then Nooth invented a new system"
00:06:08,00:06:10,that didn't have pigs' bladders in it.
00:06:10,00:06:11,"- Right, okay."
00:06:11,00:06:13,- And it effectively was the sodas.
00:06:13,00:06:16,"- But also, were his servants involved in making it?"
00:06:16,00:06:19,"- No, they must have been to a certain extent."
00:06:19,00:06:20,He will have had lab technicians.
00:06:20,00:06:22,- What was the missing factor
00:06:22,00:06:23,when it didn't taste of urine?
00:06:23,00:06:25,Was it the servants or the pigs' bladder?
00:06:25,00:06:27,- It was definitely the pigs' bladder.
00:06:27,00:06:27,- Okay.
00:06:27,00:06:29,- We're unsure about the servants.
00:06:29,00:06:30,- Yeah.
00:06:30,00:06:31,- Is this the secret?
00:06:31,00:06:33,You know how every one of these companies
00:06:33,00:06:35,has a secret ingredient that we haven't been told about?
00:06:35,00:06:37,They've just been hiding piss from us this whole time.
00:06:37,00:06:39,"- Yeah, but like 11 herbs and spices and piss."
00:06:39,00:06:42,(all laughing)
00:06:42,00:06:43,"- Just before we go on on this,"
00:06:43,00:06:45,can I tell you about one thing about Nooth?
00:06:45,00:06:46,- Okay.
00:06:46,00:06:47,- John Mervyn Nooth.
00:06:47,00:06:48,- One name.
00:06:48,00:06:49,- It was such a good name.
00:06:49,00:06:52,He once had a coughing fit and coughed out a bullet.
00:06:52,00:06:55,(all laughing)
00:06:55,00:06:55,- I know.
00:06:55,00:06:56,- Okay.
00:06:56,00:06:58,- Did he kill the person sat up his head?
00:06:58,00:06:59,(all laughing)
00:06:59,00:07:01,So he had this terrible coughing fit.
00:07:01,00:07:03,"He was like, ""Oh, really coughing awfully."""
00:07:03,00:07:05,He'd been out in the evening.
00:07:05,00:07:06,And he thought he was gonna die.
00:07:06,00:07:10,"His coughing was so bad, this was at about 17.99."
00:07:10,00:07:12,"And he threw himself down on the bed,"
00:07:12,00:07:14,coughing with great violence.
00:07:14,00:07:15,"And then when he got up,"
00:07:15,00:07:17,he'd coughed out something incredibly hard.
00:07:17,00:07:17,- Yeah.
00:07:17,00:07:20,"- And it turned out just before he got ill,"
00:07:20,00:07:21,he'd been having a glass of wine
00:07:21,00:07:22,and then he'd been called away.
00:07:22,00:07:24,So he'd quickly drained the wine
00:07:24,00:07:27,and it had lead shot in it.
00:07:27,00:07:27,"- Oh, okay."
00:07:27,00:07:28,"- So, okay, right."
00:07:28,00:07:29,- Not a bullet.
00:07:29,00:07:30,- Not an actual bullet.
00:07:30,00:07:31,- But a bit.
00:07:31,00:07:32,(all laughing)
00:07:32,00:07:33,- A lead shot.
00:07:33,00:07:34,- Still a bit of lead shot.
00:07:34,00:07:37,"- So if you were to buy, in the older days,"
00:07:37,00:07:40,"if you were to buy like a partridge for dinner,"
00:07:40,00:07:41,they would often have bits of lead in it
00:07:41,00:07:42,from where it had been shot.
00:07:42,00:07:43,"- Oh, I see."
00:07:43,00:07:44,- 'Cause it's like scatter shot.
00:07:44,00:07:45,"- Oh, okay. - Bullet."
00:07:45,00:07:46,"- Okay, but still. - Shotgun pellets."
00:07:46,00:07:48,- Okay. - Shotgun pellets.
00:07:48,00:07:49,- Shrapnel of a bullet that he still swallowed.
00:07:49,00:07:52,"Okay, so the animal was killed with a bullet."
00:07:52,00:07:53,That was in there.
00:07:53,00:07:54,"- Yeah, shotgun. - I think that counts."
00:07:54,00:07:54,"Yeah, yeah. - Yeah, yeah."
00:07:54,00:07:56,- He'd coughed it out. - It's a bullet.
00:07:56,00:07:57,"- Well, it's part of a bullet, right?"
00:07:57,00:08:01,- Do we know if coughing up a bullet makes you taste piss?
00:08:01,00:08:02,(all laughing)
00:08:02,00:08:06,"- Did the part, whoever the bullet went into"
00:08:06,00:08:09,had that animal wet itself when it died.
00:08:09,00:08:11,"- Yeah, yeah. - Drenched the bullet in whee."
00:08:11,00:08:12,He swallowed them.
00:08:12,00:08:13,- He doesn't notice 'cause of the whine.
00:08:13,00:08:14,- He doesn't notice 'cause of the whine.
00:08:14,00:08:15,- He doesn't notice.
00:08:15,00:08:16,"- And everyone's like,"
00:08:16,00:08:17,"""Pal, have you ever noticed that"
00:08:17,00:08:19,"""everything you taste off tastes a piss?"
00:08:19,00:08:21,"""Maybe you've got a piss-soaked bullet."""
00:08:21,00:08:23,- Stuck in your throat. - Yeah.
00:08:23,00:08:25,- Taste puts on it. - It's wide open.
00:08:25,00:08:27,"- Wow, that's food for thought."
00:08:27,00:08:30,"- So New Thend went on to make these soda streams,"
00:08:30,00:08:34,"which he called gasogines, or gasogines,"
00:08:34,00:08:35,and they were really famous.
00:08:35,00:08:38,"And basically, if you were anyone who was anyone"
00:08:38,00:08:41,"in the, when was it, in the 19th century,"
00:08:41,00:08:43,"then you would have a gasogine machine,"
00:08:43,00:08:45,which was like a soda stream.
00:08:45,00:08:46,"- Not much has changed really now,"
00:08:46,00:08:47,isn't it?
00:08:47,00:08:48,It's still quite a power move to have a soda stream.
00:08:48,00:08:50,- It really is. - It really is.
00:08:50,00:08:52,"Yeah, I feel like they've, no,"
00:08:52,00:08:54,"I feel like they've recently been overtaken by,"
00:08:54,00:08:56,"if you've got an air fryer, that's the thing."
00:08:56,00:08:58,"- Yeah, yeah. - It's an air fryer."
00:08:58,00:09:00,But soda streams were a bit of a power move.
00:09:00,00:09:01,You look like you've got a soda stream.
00:09:01,00:09:03,"- A soda stream. - You could tell, by the way,"
00:09:03,00:09:05,you were brewing up to that.
00:09:05,00:09:06,- I've got one as well. - Oh my God.
00:09:06,00:09:08,- Here's what's embarrassing. - This sounds as gold plated.
00:09:08,00:09:11,"- Mine's gold plated, and we haven't used it"
00:09:11,00:09:12,"in, I think, two years now."
00:09:12,00:09:14,It just sits there as a display.
00:09:14,00:09:16,- Why do you have a gold plated soda stream?
00:09:16,00:09:17,- My wife likes gold things.
00:09:17,00:09:18,- Is she?
00:09:18,00:09:20,It's your house like Donald Trump's house.
00:09:20,00:09:21,- Oh my God.
00:09:21,00:09:23,"- No, actually, it's probably the only gold thing"
00:09:23,00:09:25,"in our house. - Oh, is it the only thing?"
00:09:25,00:09:26,- The only thing. - Yeah.
00:09:26,00:09:28,"- Oh, that's not true. - What about the dining table?"
00:09:28,00:09:30,"- Yeah, the toilet and the chairs."
00:09:30,00:09:31,- Do you remember Trump's house?
00:09:31,00:09:33,"- That's real gold, the wallpaper,"
00:09:33,00:09:35,and the front of the house.
00:09:35,00:09:36,- And my children.
00:09:36,00:09:38,- Is your wife painted like that woman in gold?
00:09:38,00:09:42,- I think what it was with soda streams
00:09:42,00:09:43,"is when I was a kid, they were really,"
00:09:43,00:09:45,"if one of my friends had a soda stream,"
00:09:45,00:09:47,it was like they were the coolest kid in town.
00:09:47,00:09:50,But now it's because you don't want to buy bottles
00:09:50,00:09:52,of fizzy water 'cause it's bad for the environment
00:09:52,00:09:54,"or something, isn't it?"
00:09:54,00:09:56,"- Well, and you can make super sparkling water as well."
00:09:56,00:09:58,And you can get the syrups
00:09:58,00:10:01,that you can make your own tonic water.
00:10:01,00:10:02,"- Coca-Cola. - Yeah, but it's not"
00:10:02,00:10:03,"Coca-Cola, is it?"
00:10:03,00:10:04,"No, it is, it is."
00:10:04,00:10:05,"- Is it real Coca-Cola? - Well, it's not real."
00:10:05,00:10:06,"- Well, it's not real."
00:10:06,00:10:07,"- No, no, no, it is."
00:10:07,00:10:08,- What it is. - Fans are
00:10:08,00:10:09,for all those Nazi parties in the house.
00:10:09,00:10:11,(laughing)
00:10:11,00:10:13,"- It tastes like, this is a good thing,"
00:10:13,00:10:15,"and I would, you know,"
00:10:15,00:10:16,"if soda stream ought to advertise on Fish,"
00:10:16,00:10:18,"that'd be fine by me, just throwing it out there."
00:10:18,00:10:20,But it tastes like the Coke you'd get on a ferry.
00:10:20,00:10:21,You know that kind of Coke?
00:10:21,00:10:23,- No. - Or sort of like a ferry.
00:10:23,00:10:25,- Like Roller-Cola.
00:10:25,00:10:27,"- It's not completely, it's a bit like that."
00:10:27,00:10:29,"Yeah, what's Roller-Cola?"
00:10:29,00:10:31,"- Like bad Coke, like knock-off Coke."
00:10:31,00:10:33,"- It was like 5P when Coca-Cola was 20P,"
00:10:33,00:10:35,Roller-Cola was 5P.
00:10:35,00:10:36,"- I just want to reiterate, this stuff is great."
00:10:36,00:10:37,I love it.
00:10:37,00:10:38,I'm so happy with my soda stream.
00:10:38,00:10:40,I have used mine in the last two years.
00:10:40,00:10:41,- I actually don't think that soda stream
00:10:41,00:10:43,are going to have on their advertising
00:10:43,00:10:45,like the Coke you get on a ferry.
00:10:45,00:10:47,"- Yeah, that's nearly as bad a slogan"
00:10:47,00:10:49,as buy Nazis for Nazis.
00:10:49,00:10:51,(laughing)
00:10:51,00:10:52,- But it's really good.
00:10:52,00:10:54,It's really good I use it all the time.
00:10:54,00:10:54,- It tastes like piss.
00:10:54,00:10:55,- Yeah.
00:10:55,00:10:57,"- Good, as it should do."
00:10:57,00:10:58,- But I am.
00:10:58,00:10:59,- Just like Mumbo used to make.
00:10:59,00:11:00,(laughing)
00:11:00,00:11:01,- I think that might be something to do
00:11:01,00:11:02,with my servants though.
00:11:02,00:11:03,I just have a hunch.
00:11:03,00:11:04,(laughing)
00:11:04,00:11:05,- Yeah.
00:11:05,00:11:08,"- Presley, just a quick word about Presley."
00:11:08,00:11:08,- What a guy.
00:11:08,00:11:12,"- What a guy, so fluent in six languages."
00:11:12,00:11:15,He wrote over 500 books in pamphlets.
00:11:15,00:11:16,What an amazing scientist.
00:11:16,00:11:18,- That sounds like someone who's written 490 pamphlets.
00:11:18,00:11:21,(laughing)
00:11:22,00:11:24,"- Yeah, 499 pamphlets."
00:11:24,00:11:28,One book listing all of the pamphlets that you can read.
00:11:28,00:11:30,He's credited with inventing or discovering
00:11:30,00:11:33,how oxygen is made up.
00:11:33,00:11:36,"He was a lunatic, very excitingly."
00:11:36,00:11:38,"So the Lunar Society, which was this thing"
00:11:38,00:11:41,with Erasmus Darwin and all these amazing scientists
00:11:41,00:11:42,at the time.
00:11:42,00:11:44,They used to meet when it was a full moon
00:11:44,00:11:45,so they could see their way home
00:11:45,00:11:48,using the light of the moon in the very dark night.
00:11:48,00:11:49,"It's really cool, eh?"
00:11:49,00:11:51,"Yeah, what an extraordinary character."
00:11:51,00:11:52,"- The thing about him being a lunatic,"
00:11:52,00:11:54,that meant he was kind of pro-science.
00:11:54,00:11:55,- Yeah.
00:11:55,00:11:59,- He was also not of the Protestant faith
00:11:59,00:12:02,and he was also kind of sympathetic
00:12:02,00:12:03,with the French Revolution.
00:12:03,00:12:05,And this meant that he had lots of enemies
00:12:05,00:12:07,and lots of people didn't like him.
00:12:07,00:12:09,And there's a thing called the Presley riots.
00:12:09,00:12:12,So he moved to Birmingham after he left Leeds
00:12:12,00:12:15,and they had a dinner to sort of say
00:12:15,00:12:17,how great the French Revolution was.
00:12:17,00:12:19,And a load of people in Birmingham decided
00:12:19,00:12:21,to wreck their place where they had the dinner
00:12:21,00:12:23,and then go to Presley's house and Wreck his house.
00:12:23,00:12:25,- Was he in?
00:12:25,00:12:27,"- He was, he was in when they started to come"
00:12:27,00:12:29,with the pitchforks and the-
00:12:29,00:12:31,"- Oh, like proper Wreck his house."
00:12:31,00:12:33,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, they did."
00:12:33,00:12:34,- Oh.
00:12:34,00:12:36,"- And his lamp, oh, they didn't just,"
00:12:36,00:12:38,"not the lamp off the mantelpiece, they went full."
00:12:38,00:12:41,- He and his wife managed to get to the hills
00:12:41,00:12:42,so they could see what was happening.
00:12:42,00:12:44,But they were away from the mob.
00:12:44,00:12:46,But his son was still there.
00:12:46,00:12:49,And his son was trying to kind of save everything.
00:12:49,00:12:51,"And in the end, he had to flee as well."
00:12:51,00:12:52,And the interesting thing about it
00:12:52,00:12:54,is because it was anti-establishment
00:12:54,00:12:56,"and it was the establishment who were attacking him,"
00:12:56,00:12:59,we think that possibly some people involved
00:12:59,00:13:00,in the Birmingham government
00:13:00,00:13:02,might have been involved with this.
00:13:02,00:13:03,- Right.
00:13:03,00:13:06,"- And Pitt, who was the prime minister then,"
00:13:06,00:13:09,they asked for help against these rioters
00:13:09,00:13:11,"and they were very, very slow to react."
00:13:11,00:13:13,"The government were like, oh yeah, we'll help, we'll help."
00:13:13,00:13:15,But it was like days and days and days
00:13:15,00:13:17,before they sent anyone to Birmingham to help.
00:13:17,00:13:20,"So really they were kind of in on it as well, the government."
00:13:20,00:13:21,"- Yeah, just crazy."
00:13:21,00:13:24,- Or at least kind of passive on it.
00:13:24,00:13:25,"- Yeah, complicit, yeah."
00:13:25,00:13:27,- Samuel Johnson called him an evil man.
00:13:27,00:13:28,Like he was really in it.
00:13:28,00:13:29,- Yeah.
00:13:29,00:13:30,- It was a bit harsh.
00:13:30,00:13:32,- He really did not like carbonated drinks.
00:13:32,00:13:33,(laughing)
00:13:33,00:13:34,- Yeah.
00:13:34,00:13:35,It's sort of weird to imagine now
00:13:35,00:13:37,how controversial it was at the time.
00:13:37,00:13:37,"- Yeah, it's mad, isn't it?"
00:13:37,00:13:38,"- But he supported, yeah."
00:13:38,00:13:40,- Just to be pro-science.
00:13:40,00:13:43,- He also supported the American Revolution.
00:13:43,00:13:46,- And he was a bit equivocal on the monarchy
00:13:46,00:13:48,and on the idea of virgin birth.
00:13:48,00:13:49,- Yeah.
00:13:49,00:13:50,"- So it was all, you know."
00:13:50,00:13:51,"- He was quite loved by the American government,"
00:13:51,00:13:52,wasn't he?
00:13:52,00:13:53,"- When he got there, yeah."
00:13:53,00:13:54,- He was very popular.
00:13:54,00:13:55,- Hung out with George Washington.
00:13:55,00:13:56,"- They love a carbonated drink, though."
00:13:56,00:13:58,(laughing)
00:13:58,00:13:59,You've ever seen the Super Bowl?
00:13:59,00:14:02,"You can't move for Pepsi, Grant, sponsorship."
00:14:02,00:14:04,- Have you ever heard of this school
00:14:04,00:14:06,around the area of leads?
00:14:06,00:14:08,"Oh, I think it's around the area of leads."
00:14:08,00:14:10,Batley Grammar School?
00:14:10,00:14:11,- I know Batley.
00:14:11,00:14:11,- You know Batley?
00:14:11,00:14:14,I would very much believe that they have a grammar school.
00:14:14,00:14:16,"- Yeah, well, this is where he went to school."
00:14:16,00:14:17,"- Oh, yeah."
00:14:17,00:14:19,"- So very, very old school, obviously,"
00:14:19,00:14:21,"because he went to it, yeah."
00:14:21,00:14:23,And I looked into it to see if they'd produced
00:14:23,00:14:25,any other sort of interesting drinks
00:14:25,00:14:28,"through their students, and it turns out that they did."
00:14:28,00:14:29,- No.
00:14:29,00:14:32,"- Yeah, Richard John Reid, the co-founder"
00:14:32,00:14:35,of Innocent Smoothies and Innocent Drinks
00:14:35,00:14:36,went to the very same school.
00:14:36,00:14:37,- He went to Batley?
00:14:37,00:14:39,"- Yeah, he went to Batley Grammar School."
00:14:39,00:14:40,"- Batley Grammar, that's great."
00:14:40,00:14:42,"- And more so than the smoothies,"
00:14:42,00:14:44,he is sort of the person who is credited
00:14:44,00:14:46,with pioneering wackaging.
00:14:46,00:14:48,"Wackaging, yeah."
00:14:48,00:14:50,"- Like putting the little hats on top, is that what that is?"
00:14:50,00:14:52,"- No, it's now when the drink sort of says"
00:14:52,00:14:54,on the side and says put in the fridge.
00:14:54,00:14:55,"- Hi, I'm a smoothie."
00:14:55,00:14:55,"- Yeah, put me in the fridge."
00:14:55,00:15:00,"- Oh, it gives the personalities to the package."
00:15:00,00:15:02,"- It was them, wasn't it, who invented that?"
00:15:02,00:15:04,"- Yeah, more specifically, this guy from Batley School"
00:15:04,00:15:06,"was credited, yeah, Richard Reid."
00:15:06,00:15:09,- I was so pro Batley School until you said that.
00:15:09,00:15:12,I think they need to burn it down.
00:15:12,00:15:14,"- But also though, as soon as you said it,"
00:15:14,00:15:16,"and you said he was the inventor of Innocence Mealy,"
00:15:16,00:15:18,I immediately just pictured him to be wearing
00:15:18,00:15:20,"one of these knitted hats,"
00:15:20,00:15:22,going around Batley Grammar School corridors
00:15:22,00:15:23,"in a little knitted woolly hat,"
00:15:23,00:15:26,"going brrr, I'm cold, put me in the fridge."
00:15:26,00:15:31,"Oh, there's Richard again, there's bullying."
00:15:31,00:15:34,- Has anyone heard of the soft drink Golaka Pei?
00:15:34,00:15:34,- Golaka Pei.
00:15:34,00:15:35,- Golaka Pei.
00:15:35,00:15:36,"- Oh, one word."
00:15:36,00:15:38,"- No, it's two words, Golaka,"
00:15:38,00:15:41,G-O-L-O-K-A-N-M-P-A-Y.
00:15:41,00:15:42,"- Golaka Pei, no?"
00:15:42,00:15:44,"- No, what is it from?"
00:15:44,00:15:45,- It's from India.
00:15:45,00:15:48,- Oh no.
00:15:48,00:15:48,- Oh what?
00:15:48,00:15:49,- Is it uriny?
00:15:49,00:15:50,- It's very uriny.
00:15:50,00:15:52,"- Oh no, whose wee is in it?"
00:15:52,00:15:57,"- It's cow urine, 5% by volume, cow urine."
00:15:57,00:16:00,"- Five percent, that's a bit piss heavy for a drink."
00:16:00,00:16:02,- We should say we did a fact ages ago
00:16:02,00:16:05,"about the fact that cow urine is drunk more,"
00:16:05,00:16:07,"over there is kind of, it's more normalized"
00:16:07,00:16:08,"as a drink, isn't it?"
00:16:08,00:16:11,"- Certainly more normalized than it is here, I would say."
00:16:11,00:16:14,"- But you wouldn't drink it as just cow urine,"
00:16:14,00:16:15,it's an ingredient in something.
00:16:15,00:16:17,- I'm afraid some people do.
00:16:17,00:16:17,"- Yeah, you just drink it."
00:16:17,00:16:18,- Straight?
00:16:18,00:16:19,- Yeah.
00:16:19,00:16:20,"- So it's,"
00:16:20,00:16:22,- No.
00:16:22,00:16:23,- We haven't tried it.
00:16:23,00:16:25,"- No, would you?"
00:16:25,00:16:26,- Yeah.
00:16:26,00:16:27,- You would try it.
00:16:27,00:16:28,- For just to be able to say.
00:16:28,00:16:30,"- Ethan, bring in the cow urine."
00:16:30,00:16:33,(all laughing)
00:16:33,00:16:36,"- Ethan is Dan's gold-covered servant, by the way."
00:16:36,00:16:38,(all laughing)
00:16:38,00:16:40,- He's coming in like Julie Walters with two suits.
00:16:40,00:16:42,(all laughing)
00:16:42,00:16:45,"- I love that it's milkmates busy milking the cow one morning,"
00:16:45,00:16:47,Dan is fractionally behind the milk boy.
00:16:47,00:16:48,"- Calling on the penis, yeah."
00:16:48,00:16:50,(all laughing)
00:16:50,00:16:52,"- So yeah, we have said before,"
00:16:52,00:16:54,"there's the Cow Commission of India,"
00:16:54,00:16:58,"and this is, they're linked to like Hindu nationalist groups,"
00:16:58,00:17:02,"and they think that according to their traditional medicine,"
00:17:02,00:17:04,"cow urine is supposed to be an antidote for all sorts of,"
00:17:04,00:17:06,"I mean, anything you can think of,"
00:17:06,00:17:09,"inflammation, eczema, arthritis, leprosy."
00:17:09,00:17:10,- A bit of cow piss sorts it out.
00:17:10,00:17:13,- A bit of cow piss is supposed to sort it out.
00:17:13,00:17:16,"Currently no concrete scientific evidence that it works,"
00:17:16,00:17:18,"but you can buy a soft drink called Golaka Pei,"
00:17:18,00:17:20,"which contains 5% urine,"
00:17:20,00:17:23,but at least it does contain other herbs.
00:17:23,00:17:25,"- That's nice for them to put those in, isn't it?"
00:17:25,00:17:29,"- Yeah, such as Tulsi Brahmi and Shank Pushpi,"
00:17:29,00:17:31,and orange and lemon as well.
00:17:31,00:17:33,"- So herbs, orange, lemon, and cow whey."
00:17:33,00:17:35,"- Yeah, that's a drink."
00:17:35,00:17:36,- I'm afraid so.
00:17:36,00:17:39,"- And a drink not exclusively used for getting better,"
00:17:39,00:17:40,like some people will just have that on the go.
00:17:40,00:17:41,"- Like Luca's own, I suppose."
00:17:41,00:17:43,"- Yeah, yes, yes."
00:17:43,00:17:44,- 'Cause that is a good illness drink.
00:17:44,00:17:45,"- It's an illness drink,"
00:17:45,00:17:48,but some people are having it day to day life.
00:17:48,00:17:48,- Absolutely.
00:17:48,00:17:51,"- Do you think, sorry to bring the tone down"
00:17:51,00:17:53,"on this quite high brow podcast,"
00:17:53,00:17:58,"do you think they taste wildly different, can we, in pig whey?"
00:17:58,00:18:01,"- No, but I reckon probably an expert would be able to."
00:18:01,00:18:02,I reckon you'll be able to learn.
00:18:02,00:18:05,- You reckon there's somebody that could have a sip of both.
00:18:05,00:18:06,- Absolutely.
00:18:06,00:18:07,- Be able to point out like how people can point out
00:18:07,00:18:09,Coke and Pepsi.
00:18:09,00:18:12,Someone's out there doing it with pig and cow whey.
00:18:12,00:18:15,"- Yeah, 'cause I could do Coke and Diet Coke, I reckon."
00:18:15,00:18:17,"- Oh yeah, oh, Diet Coke."
00:18:17,00:18:18,"Well, Diet Coke tastes like this."
00:18:18,00:18:19,(all laughing)
00:18:19,00:18:23,"- I can do tea and coffee, I don't even know what you're down to."
00:18:23,00:18:27,"- Oh, Andy, you really thought that was a big thing, did you?"
00:18:27,00:18:29,"I don't want to brag, guys, but I know the difference."
00:18:29,00:18:31,- Like on your first go.
00:18:31,00:18:35,- Diet Coke and Diet Coke are more similar to each other
00:18:35,00:18:39,than I think you're in a pig urine whey.
00:18:39,00:18:40,- Please go.
00:18:40,00:18:41,- Please go.
00:18:41,00:18:43,(upbeat music)
00:18:43,00:18:50,"- Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is James."
00:18:50,00:18:52,"- Okay, my fact this week is that Brazilian footballer,"
00:18:52,00:18:55,"Formiga, is the only athlete to ever compete"
00:18:55,00:18:58,in a team sport in seven Olympics.
00:18:58,00:19:01,"But when she was born, it was illegal for women"
00:19:01,00:19:03,to play football in Brazil.
00:19:03,00:19:05,- This is such a good fact.
00:19:05,00:19:08,This is such a good fact about such a good player.
00:19:08,00:19:10,"- Oh yeah, do you know about Formiga?"
00:19:10,00:19:12,"- Yeah, so, and also, as you say,"
00:19:12,00:19:13,"it was illegal when she was born,"
00:19:13,00:19:16,and so women's football wasn't in the Olympics.
00:19:16,00:19:20,So that means that she has played in every Olympics
00:19:20,00:19:22,where women's football has existed.
00:19:22,00:19:22,- Right.
00:19:22,00:19:26,- So the next Olympics will be the first one
00:19:26,00:19:29,in women's football history not to feature Formiga.
00:19:29,00:19:31,- Do you like her for a hundred meters run
00:19:31,00:19:33,that have been in every race since 1896?
00:19:33,00:19:34,- Yeah.
00:19:34,00:19:35,- Yeah.
00:19:35,00:19:36,"- It's like that, isn't it?"
00:19:36,00:19:37,- It's unreal.
00:19:37,00:19:37,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:19:37,00:19:40,"- So, '96 was her first one."
00:19:40,00:19:45,"- Yes, so she was born in '78, I think, yeah."
00:19:45,00:19:50,"And Brazil had a law from 1941 until 1979,"
00:19:50,00:19:54,"and they didn't really make it proper until 1981,"
00:19:54,00:19:56,"that girls and women were not allowed to play football,"
00:19:56,00:19:58,"but wasn't just professional,"
00:19:58,00:19:59,they weren't allowed to play in schools
00:19:59,00:20:01,or even play for fun.
00:20:01,00:20:04,"So my daughter, on Friday,"
00:20:04,00:20:07,will go to her first football lesson.
00:20:07,00:20:09,"She's 18, 19 months old,"
00:20:09,00:20:12,"and if she was Formiga, it would have been illegal,"
00:20:12,00:20:14,she could have been arrested for going and playing football.
00:20:14,00:20:16,"- It's absolutely insane,"
00:20:16,00:20:19,"'cause there's a very famous player called Marta, right?"
00:20:19,00:20:21,"And she wasn't allowed to play football,"
00:20:21,00:20:23,"actively discouraged, she really wanted to."
00:20:23,00:20:25,"So she used to just on the street,"
00:20:25,00:20:28,"just have a balled up bits of shopping bags,"
00:20:28,00:20:31,"basically to use as a ball, playing on her own."
00:20:31,00:20:34,"Then she would sort of sneak in to play with other teams,"
00:20:34,00:20:36,"which were boys entirely,"
00:20:36,00:20:37,and it was a horrible experience for her.
00:20:37,00:20:41,"If she ever scored a goal, it was seen as a terrible thing."
00:20:41,00:20:42,"Like, you've embarrassed that boy."
00:20:42,00:20:43,- It's an attack on the men's score.
00:20:43,00:20:44,- It's an attack on the men's score.
00:20:44,00:20:47,"And so, never ever was she given this moment"
00:20:47,00:20:49,"of sort of, you know, you've done good."
00:20:49,00:20:51,"- It was an incredible press conference, Marta gave,"
00:20:51,00:20:53,"'cause she retired after the World Cup just gone,"
00:20:53,00:20:55,and it was really quite emotional watching
00:20:55,00:20:57,"because she's touching on, I mean,"
00:20:57,00:20:59,"women's football across the globe, as we all know,"
00:20:59,00:21:02,"has been hugely under-platformed,"
00:21:02,00:21:07,"under-represented, hugely disrespected as a sport,"
00:21:07,00:21:09,bad enough in this country with the FA banning it
00:21:09,00:21:12,"for 15 years, but in Brazil, as you say,"
00:21:12,00:21:16,"with that very sort of paternalistic, moralism,"
00:21:16,00:21:20,"sort of society existing, it was an actual attack on,"
00:21:20,00:21:23,and it's all down to that it wasn't appropriate
00:21:23,00:21:26,for a woman with her build to be playing football.
00:21:26,00:21:30,"But yeah, Famigo was 19 at her first one,"
00:21:30,00:21:33,43 at the last of the World Cup.
00:21:33,00:21:35,43 represent in your country.
00:21:35,00:21:37,"- And she only ever missed one World Cup,"
00:21:37,00:21:38,which was the 1991.
00:21:38,00:21:40,She's done seven of those as well.
00:21:40,00:21:41,- Unbelievable.
00:21:41,00:21:44,- The thing is as well that Marta was
00:21:44,00:21:46,Brazil's leading scorer in history.
00:21:46,00:21:48,"She scored 115 goals,"
00:21:48,00:21:52,"Neymar's the second with 79, Pelé 77."
00:21:52,00:21:57,"And Famigo had the highest number of appearances,"
00:21:57,00:22:01,"which was 234, which is insane."
00:22:01,00:22:02,- It's unreal.
00:22:02,00:22:04,"- It's more than 100 games, more than Cafu,"
00:22:04,00:22:06,who's got the highest in the men's game.
00:22:06,00:22:09,"- Yeah, and Marta, just with the stats,"
00:22:09,00:22:11,she's the current record holder for the most goals
00:22:11,00:22:14,"ever scored in a World Cup, in one World Cup,"
00:22:14,00:22:16,"which is 17 goals, and that's for both men"
00:22:16,00:22:17,and women's football.
00:22:17,00:22:19,"- That's a lot. - For one World Cup,"
00:22:19,00:22:20,that's a lot.
00:22:20,00:22:21,"- It's mad, isn't it?"
00:22:21,00:22:22,- Do you?
00:22:22,00:22:27,"- You find it like Neymar recently surpassed Pelé's record,"
00:22:27,00:22:32,"and like the huge notice that that gets,"
00:22:32,00:22:34,"that it's always like screaming from the rooftops,"
00:22:34,00:22:35,who's the goat in football?
00:22:35,00:22:37,We always end up talking about men.
00:22:37,00:22:40,"The goats are often in the women's game,"
00:22:40,00:22:41,because they've had to be.
00:22:41,00:22:43,It's truly incredible.
00:22:43,00:22:44,- I watched it.
00:22:44,00:22:45,"- Sorry, sorry."
00:22:45,00:22:46,- What?
00:22:46,00:22:47,- Please.
00:22:47,00:22:48,"- Go on, you watch some football."
00:22:48,00:22:51,(all laughing)
00:22:51,00:22:52,"- Just as I watched last night,"
00:22:52,00:22:54,"just as a nice bit of timing,"
00:22:54,00:22:56,the series Welcome to Wrexham
00:22:56,00:22:58,"is currently airing its second series,"
00:22:58,00:23:01,"and one of the episodes that comes up mid-series,"
00:23:01,00:23:02,"which I watched last night,"
00:23:02,00:23:04,"it's the latest episode as of recording,"
00:23:04,00:23:06,it was all about the Wrexham women's team.
00:23:06,00:23:07,"- Yeah, so good at it."
00:23:07,00:23:09,"- No, far better than any,"
00:23:09,00:23:10,"they make it to the,"
00:23:10,00:23:12,"as far as we are in the series right now,"
00:23:12,00:23:14,"they've just made it to the top of their league,"
00:23:14,00:23:17,"but they take on the closest ranking team,"
00:23:17,00:23:20,"and they beat them 11 to one, I think it was."
00:23:20,00:23:22,"And yeah, it's just astonishing."
00:23:22,00:23:24,"And it's so good, I guess that it's now changing,"
00:23:24,00:23:25,isn't it?
00:23:25,00:23:27,"- It's ever growing, but it's thanks to players,"
00:23:27,00:23:29,"like for me, you go for like Marta,"
00:23:29,00:23:31,"like in our own coaching, like Kelly Smith,"
00:23:31,00:23:33,"or, well, even if you go right far back"
00:23:33,00:23:35,"to sort of dick curl ladies,"
00:23:35,00:23:37,who were all sort of...
00:23:37,00:23:38,"- Early 20th century team,"
00:23:38,00:23:39,"the dick curl ladies, yeah."
00:23:39,00:23:41,"- Basically the ones pre-war,"
00:23:41,00:23:43,"that were getting all of the big crowds,"
00:23:43,00:23:44,"and then the war happened,"
00:23:44,00:23:45,"and everyone was like,"
00:23:45,00:23:47,"""No, we need to make the men feel good."""
00:23:47,00:23:47,- Yeah.
00:23:47,00:23:51,- So it was banned in the UK women playing football.
00:23:51,00:23:53,"Basically, they weren't allowed to play"
00:23:53,00:23:56,"on FA affiliated grounds, which was all the grounds."
00:23:56,00:23:59,"And that ban was from 1921 until the '70s,"
00:23:59,00:24:01,"so like you say, about 50 years."
00:24:01,00:24:04,"But there was also bans in France, in Norway, in Germany,"
00:24:04,00:24:07,"and usually the case was that this,"
00:24:07,00:24:09,they thought that sport was unsuitable
00:24:09,00:24:10,"for the female body, like you say,"
00:24:10,00:24:12,"but in West Germany's case,"
00:24:12,00:24:15,they specifically said that it was a women's soul
00:24:15,00:24:15,that would be in Germany.
00:24:15,00:24:18,"- Oh, and I think that's quite nice"
00:24:18,00:24:19,"as a sort of novel way of like,"
00:24:19,00:24:21,"oh, we've had loads of complaints about the body,"
00:24:21,00:24:23,"and they're like, ""Oh, damaging women all this time."""
00:24:23,00:24:24,- What are we gonna say there?
00:24:24,00:24:25,What are we gonna say?
00:24:25,00:24:27,"- They might have meant the soul of their feet,"
00:24:27,00:24:29,but it's not how it's spelled.
00:24:29,00:24:30,"But you don't get footballers who are like,"
00:24:30,00:24:32,"""Oh, they're not playing this week"
00:24:32,00:24:34,"because they injured their soul."""
00:24:34,00:24:36,- And I think that would be nice.
00:24:36,00:24:37,"I think, and also,"
00:24:37,00:24:38,"I think spiritual stuff should be taken,"
00:24:38,00:24:41,"like the referee should be able to say,"
00:24:41,00:24:41,immoral.
00:24:41,00:24:44,- Immoral play.
00:24:44,00:24:45,"- Yeah, I didn't see the play,"
00:24:45,00:24:47,"but your aura has turned a nasty shade of red,"
00:24:47,00:24:48,and I think--
00:24:48,00:24:49,"- I'm just a ref going, I'm going,"
00:24:49,00:24:50,"""I'm getting bad vibes."""
00:24:50,00:24:51,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:24:51,00:24:52,- Red card.
00:24:52,00:24:54,- That'd be really fun.
00:24:54,00:24:56,"- Of all the countries as well,"
00:24:56,00:24:59,"to say bad for the soul of a woman,"
00:24:59,00:25:00,you wouldn't expect Germany.
00:25:00,00:25:01,"That's not very,"
00:25:01,00:25:03,"it's not particularly Germanic to say, is it?"
00:25:03,00:25:04,"- Yeah, it's not very quantifiable."
00:25:04,00:25:05,- Of the soul.
00:25:05,00:25:06,You'd expect that from one
00:25:06,00:25:09,of the more romantic language countries.
00:25:09,00:25:11,- Nietzsche wouldn't agree.
00:25:11,00:25:12,- Well.
00:25:12,00:25:12,- Well.
00:25:12,00:25:13,(laughing)
00:25:13,00:25:15,"- And he, honestly."
00:25:15,00:25:18,- Here's the thing.
00:25:18,00:25:20,"So, there was a recent study,"
00:25:20,00:25:21,"and I quite like this,"
00:25:21,00:25:23,it's assessed that women's football
00:25:23,00:25:24,is better to watch than men's.
00:25:24,00:25:28,"So it's a Swedish sports company who conducted this,"
00:25:28,00:25:29,"they're called Speedeo,"
00:25:29,00:25:32,"and they compare the women's Euros in the men's World Cup,"
00:25:32,00:25:34,and they tried to do it as mathematically as possible.
00:25:34,00:25:38,So what they found is that women are less risk averse
00:25:38,00:25:40,than men in the style of play.
00:25:40,00:25:42,"And again, they're just comparing women's Euros"
00:25:42,00:25:42,and men's World Cup.
00:25:42,00:25:45,"But those are two, obviously, big international tournaments."
00:25:45,00:25:46,"- Okay, so for instance,"
00:25:46,00:25:49,the men's teams might deliberately hold back
00:25:49,00:25:50,"and try and not concede goals,"
00:25:50,00:25:52,whereas the women's team aren't bothered.
00:25:52,00:25:52,- That's it.
00:25:52,00:25:55,"So when the women's Euros passes,"
00:25:55,00:25:57,"moved teams forward 3.7 meters,"
00:25:57,00:26:00,"and in the men's World Cup, it was 2.5 meters."
00:26:00,00:26:01,- Really?
00:26:01,00:26:02,"- That doesn't sound like a lot,"
00:26:02,00:26:04,"but yeah, that's a big difference."
00:26:04,00:26:09,- I do love you to be the commentator of the World Cup.
00:26:10,00:26:12,- And I believe that was a 2.6 meter pass.
00:26:12,00:26:13,"- Oh, yes."
00:26:13,00:26:16,"- You're running along the sidelines with that wheel,"
00:26:16,00:26:18,that pizza cutter wheel.
00:26:18,00:26:19,- Massive great spreadsheet.
00:26:19,00:26:21,I'm trying to keep track of everyone.
00:26:21,00:26:23,So is that a massive difference?
00:26:23,00:26:26,"- Well, I mean, down 2.5, 3.7."
00:26:26,00:26:27,"Sorry, I forgot."
00:26:27,00:26:28,I'm talking to the man who can tell the difference
00:26:28,00:26:30,"between Coke and Diet Coke, of course,"
00:26:30,00:26:32,you would know the meters' differential.
00:26:32,00:26:35,"- That's 50% more per pass, you know, almost 50% more."
00:26:35,00:26:38,"Yeah, it's not like 10 centimeters shy of being 50% more,"
00:26:38,00:26:42,"but still, but one stats expert said, I just love this."
00:26:42,00:26:44,It's almost like the men are playing a game of chess
00:26:44,00:26:46,and the women are playing something
00:26:46,00:26:47,a bit more interesting than chess.
00:26:47,00:26:49,(laughing)
00:26:49,00:26:51,"Can I say piss off because actually,"
00:26:51,00:26:52,some of us like watching chess.
00:26:52,00:26:55,- Like 3D chess like they have in Star Wars.
00:26:55,00:26:56,- Star Wars.
00:26:56,00:26:57,- Wars.
00:26:57,00:26:58,- Shit.
00:26:58,00:26:59,"- No, oh yeah."
00:26:59,00:27:00,- Probably both.
00:27:00,00:27:03,"- Well, it's, now we're on my home turf, I'm afraid."
00:27:03,00:27:04,- You're all wrong.
00:27:04,00:27:05,"It's Harry Potter 1, remember?"
00:27:05,00:27:08,"- We're on the big statues, moving forward."
00:27:08,00:27:11,"- We will get emails just to say in Star Wars,"
00:27:11,00:27:13,"they have the hologram chest, don't they?"
00:27:13,00:27:14,With the monsters.
00:27:14,00:27:15,"And I think in Star Trek, I don't know what they have."
00:27:15,00:27:18,"- You've lost me here, lads, I'll be honest with you."
00:27:18,00:27:18,You've lost me here.
00:27:18,00:27:19,- Go back to football.
00:27:19,00:27:20,- I think so.
00:27:20,00:27:23,"It is definitely like quite a different game in terms,"
00:27:23,00:27:25,"like it feels at the ground,"
00:27:25,00:27:27,it's a very different experience watching the game.
00:27:27,00:27:30,"It's a far more inclusive, positive atmosphere,"
00:27:30,00:27:33,"but actually on the pitch, that's interesting."
00:27:33,00:27:34,"- So you play, don't you?"
00:27:34,00:27:35,- Yeah.
00:27:35,00:27:37,- How far do you normally pass?
00:27:37,00:27:40,"- Oh, I reckon I'm working at the moment with a good 2.7,"
00:27:40,00:27:41,"I would say, yeah, 2.7."
00:27:41,00:27:45,"Now, I think we've heard a lot in the World Cup,"
00:27:45,00:27:47,a lot of people observing that there was a bit less diving
00:27:47,00:27:48,"and a bit less sort of,"
00:27:48,00:27:51,"gonna get emails here from blokes, as we always do,"
00:27:51,00:27:53,"but going, ""Oh, really, we don't dive."""
00:27:53,00:27:56,"Actually, no, on this podcast, you won't,"
00:27:56,00:27:57,you probably get quite nice people.
00:27:57,00:27:58,"- No, no, it's the first time I've,"
00:27:58,00:27:59,I reckon as a learning about football.
00:27:59,00:28:02,- I think metoxic masculinity is probably quite low
00:28:02,00:28:03,on the listenership on here.
00:28:03,00:28:05,"- Oh, excuse me, I'm currently doing the inbox,"
00:28:05,00:28:07,"can I tell you, the number of laddie emails."
00:28:07,00:28:08,- It's full of not all men.
00:28:08,00:28:08,"- Yeah, really?"
00:28:08,00:28:10,(laughing)
00:28:10,00:28:12,- One thing I found about watching women's games
00:28:12,00:28:13,as opposed to men's games is that everyone
00:28:13,00:28:15,who's at the ground is watching the game.
00:28:15,00:28:16,"- Oh, yeah, yeah."
00:28:16,00:28:18,"- So like, if you go and watch a men's football match,"
00:28:18,00:28:21,quite often you're watching the opposing fans.
00:28:21,00:28:22,- Yeah.
00:28:22,00:28:23,"- Or, you know, they, well, you're there to--"
00:28:23,00:28:24,- They're watching you?
00:28:24,00:28:26,"- Yeah, you're kind of singing and chanting."
00:28:26,00:28:27,- Rehearsing the chant.
00:28:27,00:28:28,- Yeah.
00:28:28,00:28:28,- Rehearsing.
00:28:28,00:28:31,"- Let's not remember, it's not singing and chanting,"
00:28:31,00:28:33,it's doing a lot of hand gestures at each other.
00:28:33,00:28:34,"- Oh, yeah, yeah."
00:28:34,00:28:36,- Regardless of what's happening on the pitch.
00:28:36,00:28:37,- Unsupported ones.
00:28:37,00:28:40,"- Yeah, yeah, it's not, it's not thumbs up."
00:28:40,00:28:41,"It's not thumbs up, I think."
00:28:41,00:28:42,(laughing)
00:28:42,00:28:44,It's not a heart shake from across the stands.
00:28:44,00:28:45,"- Yeah, 'cause you could, I mean,"
00:28:45,00:28:48,your whole end of the stands could do a great big heart.
00:28:48,00:28:50,"- If you ever go and watch, if you ever go and watch Leeds,"
00:28:50,00:28:51,that's what they do.
00:28:51,00:28:53,"- I'd love it, Addy's just there shouting across the game,"
00:28:53,00:28:54,"""I love your shirt."""
00:28:54,00:28:55,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:28:55,00:28:57,"- I'm like, ""Shirt, where's that from?"""
00:28:57,00:28:59,"- But yeah, and I went to watch,"
00:28:59,00:29:00,"I think it was a World Cup in France,"
00:29:00,00:29:02,but everyone there was watching the game.
00:29:02,00:29:03,- Right.
00:29:03,00:29:05,- And really no one is doing anything else.
00:29:05,00:29:06,"- Yeah, but it is interesting to hear the actual"
00:29:06,00:29:10,clinical differences of the on-pitch play.
00:29:10,00:29:12,- Maybe if the men's players kick the ball
00:29:12,00:29:15,"a bit less far or further, actually,"
00:29:15,00:29:19,then it might improve the mood in the stands.
00:29:19,00:29:20,"- Yeah, maybe they would need to make"
00:29:20,00:29:21,all those hand gestures.
00:29:21,00:29:22,(laughing)
00:29:22,00:29:23,"- Maybe, cool."
00:29:23,00:29:25,- Formiga is Portuguese for aunt.
00:29:25,00:29:26,"- Oh, yeah?"
00:29:26,00:29:27,- Yeah.
00:29:27,00:29:28,- 'Cause she's got six legs.
00:29:28,00:29:28,(laughing)
00:29:28,00:29:29,- She's got six legs.
00:29:29,00:29:31,"- And she can carry 19 times her own body weight,"
00:29:31,00:29:32,can't she?
00:29:32,00:29:34,"- And actually, I just realized that an old word for aunt"
00:29:34,00:29:36,was pismaya because they smell of urine.
00:29:36,00:29:37,"- Oh, yeah."
00:29:37,00:29:38,"- Oh, look at this."
00:29:38,00:29:39,- There we go.
00:29:39,00:29:41,- So she's called aunt.
00:29:41,00:29:42,That was a nickname that was given to her
00:29:42,00:29:43,when she was at school.
00:29:43,00:29:45,"And it was when she was playing football,"
00:29:45,00:29:46,they said that she used to play tenaciously
00:29:46,00:29:47,and unselfishly.
00:29:47,00:29:50,She was much like how an aunt would operate
00:29:50,00:29:51,within its own colony.
00:29:51,00:29:54,"Yeah, so she was very much busy all the time"
00:29:54,00:29:55,and always helping out.
00:29:55,00:29:56,She hated it.
00:29:56,00:29:58,Hated it as a kid.
00:29:58,00:29:59,"She learned to just accept it,"
00:29:59,00:30:01,"but she said, ""In the beginning, I didn't like it very much."""
00:30:01,00:30:02,"You know, I thought it was weird."
00:30:02,00:30:03,"- It's quite as if she's small, doesn't it, I guess?"
00:30:03,00:30:05,"- Yeah, the actual reasoning for it is nice,"
00:30:05,00:30:07,but to be called aunt.
00:30:07,00:30:09,"- Yeah, well, she said, ""I don't have an antennae."""
00:30:09,00:30:10,"Like, why would I?"
00:30:10,00:30:11,- That's true.
00:30:11,00:30:13,- She's getting a bit hung up on where are my mandibles?
00:30:13,00:30:14,- Yeah.
00:30:14,00:30:15,(laughing)
00:30:15,00:30:19,"- Can I see if, Macy, I wonder if you've seen this movie."
00:30:19,00:30:20,- Okay.
00:30:20,00:30:22,"- It's called, it's called--"
00:30:22,00:30:23,- Titanic.
00:30:23,00:30:26,(laughing)
00:30:26,00:30:27,- Fend it right back.
00:30:27,00:30:28,- Yeah.
00:30:28,00:30:32,"- It's called, ""Escape to Victory."""
00:30:32,00:30:34,"- No, I've not seen this film."
00:30:34,00:30:34,- Has no one seen this film?
00:30:34,00:30:35,- What class?
00:30:35,00:30:36,- It's very famous.
00:30:36,00:30:37,- Is it?
00:30:37,00:30:38,- I've never heard of this film before.
00:30:38,00:30:40,"It's stars, Sylvester Stallone."
00:30:40,00:30:41,- I'm Pele.
00:30:41,00:30:44,"- Michael Cain, Pele and Bobby Moore."
00:30:44,00:30:46,- What?
00:30:46,00:30:47,"- I mean, that is the real expendable."
00:30:47,00:30:49,"- So is it a football, or it sounds like a prison?"
00:30:49,00:30:50,- It is.
00:30:50,00:30:52,"- It is, it's a prison movie whereby--"
00:30:52,00:30:53,"- There's ""Gate Through Football."""
00:30:53,00:30:56,- They set up a match during the match
00:30:56,00:30:58,as part of the match prep.
00:30:58,00:31:00,"But I just love there's a Stallone, Michael Cain,"
00:31:00,00:31:01,"Bobby Moore, and--"
00:31:01,00:31:02,- That's mad.
00:31:02,00:31:03,"- Yeah, I know."
00:31:03,00:31:06,"- Oh my God, I didn't see this film."
00:31:06,00:31:07,"- I know, I really need to see it."
00:31:07,00:31:09,- Is it any good?
00:31:09,00:31:10,- It's a classic.
00:31:10,00:31:13,"- Yeah, I can read between those lights."
00:31:13,00:31:13,- Yeah.
00:31:13,00:31:14,(laughing)
00:31:14,00:31:16,"- It's one of the things they used to show it on like,"
00:31:16,00:31:17,Sunday evening.
00:31:17,00:31:20,"- Can I just say, if anybody ever went,"
00:31:20,00:31:22,"""Macy Adam, I haven't seen a comedy, what's it like?"""
00:31:22,00:31:24,"And somebody went, ""It's classic."""
00:31:24,00:31:25,(laughing)
00:31:25,00:31:27,- I think that would be absolutely harrowing.
00:31:27,00:31:28,(laughing)
00:31:28,00:31:31,- He'd rather be made by Nazis for this one.
00:31:31,00:31:33,(laughing)
00:31:33,00:31:35,- One for the tour poster.
00:31:35,00:31:37,"- One last thing on Pelle,"
00:31:37,00:31:39,just while we're on him very quickly.
00:31:39,00:31:43,"Pelle's last ever match, 1977, he played,"
00:31:43,00:31:44,"and it was an exhibition match,"
00:31:44,00:31:47,"and it was the New York Cosmos against Santos,"
00:31:47,00:31:50,and two teams that he used to play for.
00:31:50,00:31:53,"So, in order to make sure that he wasn't siding"
00:31:53,00:31:54,"with any particular team,"
00:31:54,00:31:56,"in the first half, he played with one team,"
00:31:56,00:31:58,"and in the second half, he played with the other team."
00:31:58,00:31:58,- Lovely.
00:31:58,00:31:59,- It's final match ever.
00:31:59,00:32:01,- Absolutely love that.
00:32:01,00:32:03,"Only Pelle could get away with doing that, though."
00:32:03,00:32:04,- Yeah.
00:32:04,00:32:04,- I think so.
00:32:04,00:32:05,"- So, he didn't change ends."
00:32:05,00:32:06,"- Oh, yes."
00:32:06,00:32:08,"- Which must give you a slight advantage, right?"
00:32:08,00:32:09,Possibly.
00:32:09,00:32:11,"- Also, probably being Pelle gives you a slight advantage."
00:32:11,00:32:13,"- Yeah, that's why he was so good."
00:32:13,00:32:14,(laughing)
00:32:14,00:32:15,"- When I was at school,"
00:32:15,00:32:17,"we used to obviously play football for the schools,"
00:32:17,00:32:19,and a lot of the schools would have pictures
00:32:19,00:32:21,that were on massive slants.
00:32:21,00:32:22,"- Oh, my God."
00:32:22,00:32:23,"- And so, like, you'd be in the first half,"
00:32:23,00:32:24,"you'd be winning five, nearly."
00:32:24,00:32:26,"You'd end up losing, like, 21-five."
00:32:26,00:32:28,"- I played a league in Brighton,"
00:32:28,00:32:29,and we played on one the other day.
00:32:29,00:32:31,"If you've ever been to Whitehawk's ground,"
00:32:31,00:32:33,"it's a fantastic club, it's Whitehawk,"
00:32:33,00:32:37,"but their ground is on a slope, sort of, left to right,"
00:32:37,00:32:40,"and up to that, like, you could ski down it."
00:32:40,00:32:41,You could ski down it.
00:32:41,00:32:44,- There was one that I played at school in Bolton.
00:32:44,00:32:46,"This was, I think it was in primary school,"
00:32:46,00:32:48,"and it was, like, slanted, like you say,"
00:32:48,00:32:50,from one wing to the other.
00:32:50,00:32:51,- Yeah.
00:32:51,00:32:51,- You can imagine that.
00:32:51,00:32:52,"And we were all primary school kids,"
00:32:52,00:32:54,"so we didn't really know how to play football,"
00:32:54,00:32:56,and so the ball would just always end up rolling
00:32:56,00:32:59,to the bottom at all 22 kids.
00:32:59,00:33:00,(laughing)
00:33:00,00:33:01,- It's part of the pitch.
00:33:01,00:33:03,- A lot of corner balls from one specific corner.
00:33:03,00:33:04,(laughing)
00:33:04,00:33:07,(upbeat music)
00:33:07,00:33:12,"- Okay, it is time for fact number three."
00:33:12,00:33:14,That is Andy.
00:33:14,00:33:17,- My fact is that American schools have a sport
00:33:17,00:33:19,of competitive meat judging.
00:33:19,00:33:20,- No.
00:33:20,00:33:21,No.
00:33:21,00:33:22,- Wait.
00:33:22,00:33:23,(laughing)
00:33:23,00:33:24,- Meat judging.
00:33:24,00:33:25,- Meat judging.
00:33:25,00:33:26,It's less dodgy than it sounds.
00:33:26,00:33:27,- Absolutely believe.
00:33:27,00:33:29,"- It's made, I should say,"
00:33:29,00:33:32,this was sent in by an audience member called Kevin Fegan.
00:33:32,00:33:33,"So thank you, Kevin."
00:33:33,00:33:35,- Kevin Fegan.
00:33:35,00:33:36,(laughing)
00:33:36,00:33:37,- Fegan.
00:33:37,00:33:38,- Yeah.
00:33:38,00:33:38,- Kevin Fegan.
00:33:38,00:33:39,"- Yeah, like Kevin Keegan, but with an F."
00:33:39,00:33:40,- Yeah.
00:33:40,00:33:41,"- Oh, all right."
00:33:41,00:33:42,But he's not a vegan.
00:33:42,00:33:43,- Yeah.
00:33:43,00:33:44,- He didn't say it as evil.
00:33:44,00:33:45,- He's a vegetarian.
00:33:45,00:33:46,(laughing)
00:33:46,00:33:47,"- God, come on."
00:33:47,00:33:48,"- Kevin, if you're American--"
00:33:48,00:33:50,"- If you think I'm better than that, mate,"
00:33:50,00:33:51,you've not had any episodes.
00:33:51,00:33:52,- I loved it.
00:33:52,00:33:52,I loved it.
00:33:52,00:33:54,- What's Kevin saying?
00:33:54,00:33:57,"- Kevin's saying, well, that's what it is."
00:33:57,00:33:58,That's the fact.
00:33:58,00:33:59,- That there's meat judging.
00:33:59,00:34:00,- It's competitive meat judging.
00:34:00,00:34:02,And I think this might be the most American sport possible.
00:34:02,00:34:03,- How can you judge meat?
00:34:03,00:34:05,What's the criteria?
00:34:05,00:34:07,"- Oh, well, is this a pig or is it a cow?"
00:34:07,00:34:08,(laughing)
00:34:08,00:34:10,"- Step one, that's the absolute baseline."
00:34:10,00:34:11,"No, no, no."
00:34:11,00:34:13,"This is, okay, it's a college sport."
00:34:13,00:34:15,"It's an intercollegiate sport, right?"
00:34:15,00:34:17,So it's sort of students who are playing it.
00:34:17,00:34:21,"And they, like all over the country,"
00:34:21,00:34:23,"teams of students practice all year,"
00:34:23,00:34:25,and then they get to the competition.
00:34:25,00:34:26,"And what you have to do is,"
00:34:26,00:34:29,"you're presented with a range of meat carcasses,"
00:34:29,00:34:31,"and you have to judge the yield,"
00:34:31,00:34:33,"how much meat you'll get out of it,"
00:34:33,00:34:35,"how much fat there is in it,"
00:34:35,00:34:38,"the consumer experience, the age of the carcass,"
00:34:38,00:34:40,and you have to do all this by sight only.
00:34:40,00:34:40,- Sight only.
00:34:40,00:34:42,"- Oh, so they don't just put a slab of meat in front of you"
00:34:42,00:34:44,"and you go, pork?"
00:34:44,00:34:45,"- No, no, no, no."
00:34:45,00:34:47,- Not just guess if it's beef or pork or lamb.
00:34:47,00:34:50,"I'll just say, I reckon I'd be all right at this."
00:34:50,00:34:52,"- Andy, do you think as someone who can tell the difference"
00:34:52,00:34:54,"between diet cooking and no cooking,"
00:34:54,00:34:55,that you won't be good at the spot?
00:34:55,00:34:56,- I think I might.
00:34:56,00:34:57,"- Yeah, I think."
00:34:57,00:34:58,- It sounds amazing.
00:34:58,00:35:00,"- It's like meat chess, basically."
00:35:00,00:35:04,"It's really like, you get 10 minutes to inspect each carcass."
00:35:04,00:35:05,"You know, they're hanging up in front of you."
00:35:05,00:35:07,You're not really touching them much.
00:35:07,00:35:09,- You're in like a big cold fridge.
00:35:09,00:35:10,- Like a couple of butchers.
00:35:10,00:35:15,"You're in that, and then you're asked to guess yield."
00:35:15,00:35:17,"- Yeah, I mean, all sorts."
00:35:17,00:35:19,- How many portions you get?
00:35:19,00:35:23,"- My favorite one is, and this is purely by sight,"
00:35:23,00:35:27,you have to go and evaluate whether a table of 10 cuts
00:35:27,00:35:29,that are laid down fit a checklist
00:35:29,00:35:32,of the United States Department of Agricultural Standards.
00:35:32,00:35:34,- Who's revising this?
00:35:34,00:35:36,"- Oh, people put so much work in it."
00:35:36,00:35:38,They train sometimes for 12 hours a day
00:35:38,00:35:39,leading up to the competition.
00:35:39,00:35:40,- Whilst they're in college.
00:35:40,00:35:42,Have you seen how expensive college is in America?
00:35:42,00:35:45,How fuming would these parents be if they knew?
00:35:45,00:35:46,Are you revising?
00:35:46,00:35:48,"Well, I've been looking at my chickens."
00:35:48,00:35:49,(laughing)
00:35:49,00:35:51,"They must get a scholarship, I guess, right?"
00:35:51,00:35:52,"You know, like if you're--"
00:35:52,00:35:53,- You can't get a meat scholarship.
00:35:53,00:35:56,"Sure, like, surely not."
00:35:56,00:35:58,"- You only play also, they're kind of competitors."
00:35:58,00:36:01,They're kind of like the Mayflies of the sporting world.
00:36:01,00:36:03,"They get, you get one season."
00:36:03,00:36:03,That's it.
00:36:03,00:36:04,You can't play twice.
00:36:04,00:36:06,You can't play in two consecutive years.
00:36:06,00:36:08,"Not like Farmiga, who can play."
00:36:08,00:36:09,- You can't be the Farmiga without each other.
00:36:09,00:36:12,(laughing)
00:36:12,00:36:14,- Which is a nightmare for the coaches
00:36:14,00:36:17,that pick their star meat examiners.
00:36:17,00:36:19,- Trying them up for one season and then they're out.
00:36:19,00:36:21,"- Then you're back, yeah, you're just back to the start."
00:36:21,00:36:23,"Finding fresh blood, you have to."
00:36:23,00:36:25,"- Why would you bother, genuinely,"
00:36:25,00:36:26,why would you bother pursuing this
00:36:26,00:36:28,if you can't become one of the great meat judges
00:36:28,00:36:30,"who can't do it year in, year out?"
00:36:30,00:36:33,- There are talent scouts who come to the competitions.
00:36:33,00:36:33,- You're lying.
00:36:33,00:36:34,"- No, I'm not."
00:36:34,00:36:35,"I swear, I swear."
00:36:35,00:36:38,"They, I mean, a lot of the students"
00:36:38,00:36:40,"are already studying agriculture, that kind of thing."
00:36:40,00:36:43,So a lot of the competitors will end up going into meat
00:36:43,00:36:46,"professionally, you know, the U.S."
00:36:46,00:36:49,"- Oh, so they might be scouted to go into these top jobs"
00:36:49,00:36:50,because of how well they did at the meat judges.
00:36:50,00:36:53,- If you're the head of a meat company
00:36:53,00:36:55,and you really want the best meat judges
00:36:55,00:36:57,"to be part of your company, you'll pay lots of money."
00:36:57,00:37:00,- So you'll go to some intercollegiate competition
00:37:00,00:37:04,"and be like, wow, Steven's very good at clocking."
00:37:04,00:37:05,"- Yeah, wow."
00:37:05,00:37:09,- And 80% of them go into food and livestock industry jobs
00:37:09,00:37:11,after college.
00:37:11,00:37:12,"- I mean, 20% don't know."
00:37:12,00:37:13,(laughing)
00:37:13,00:37:14,- There might be some savants who have studied it.
00:37:14,00:37:16,- 20% just doing it for food.
00:37:16,00:37:17,They're going into equipment.
00:37:17,00:37:19,- They're studying poetry.
00:37:19,00:37:21,The meat is pure passion for them.
00:37:21,00:37:22,"And then, yeah, exactly."
00:37:22,00:37:23,- It's just a side hobby.
00:37:23,00:37:24,- I just love it.
00:37:24,00:37:25,I love it so much.
00:37:25,00:37:27,"- But you do, you do get like the formiga of this,"
00:37:27,00:37:29,even though the span is just one season.
00:37:29,00:37:33,"So there is, there is one person called Maddie Ainsley."
00:37:33,00:37:37,And Maddie Ainsley did seven competitions like for me.
00:37:37,00:37:38,- 'Cause around the country.
00:37:38,00:37:39,- You go around the country.
00:37:39,00:37:40,- You go around the country.
00:37:40,00:37:40,- There are seven different competitions.
00:37:40,00:37:41,- Within the year.
00:37:41,00:37:43,So this is taking up a lot of your year.
00:37:43,00:37:44,This is not like one meat competition.
00:37:44,00:37:46,And she won five of the sevens.
00:37:46,00:37:47,- That's great.
00:37:47,00:37:48,- She's the all star.
00:37:48,00:37:49,- It's going to go all bad day.
00:37:49,00:37:50,- Yeah.
00:37:50,00:37:51,"- Wow, that's great."
00:37:51,00:37:54,"There was one guy called Rody Hawkins,"
00:37:54,00:37:56,who was a former meat judge from Tennessee.
00:37:56,00:37:57,And this is the only--
00:37:57,00:37:59,- That can't be a sentence.
00:37:59,00:38:00,(laughing)
00:38:00,00:38:03,"Rody Hawkins, meat judge from Tennessee."
00:38:03,00:38:05,This is like if Chuck GPT wrote a novel.
00:38:05,00:38:08,(laughing)
00:38:08,00:38:11,- He was a former meat judge from Tennessee.
00:38:11,00:38:13,"- Right, an American novel."
00:38:13,00:38:16,Rody Hawkins from Tennessee.
00:38:16,00:38:18,- He's the only famous one I could find
00:38:18,00:38:21,who went from meat judging to greater things.
00:38:21,00:38:24,"He co-invented Lunchables, which is a famous--"
00:38:24,00:38:25,- Sorry.
00:38:25,00:38:26,- They're good.
00:38:26,00:38:27,"- No, no, no, come on."
00:38:27,00:38:29,He's judging the quality of meat.
00:38:29,00:38:31,And he came out with Lunchables.
00:38:31,00:38:33,(laughing)
00:38:33,00:38:34,- It's like a little plastic toast.
00:38:34,00:38:36,- Processed.
00:38:36,00:38:38,- With some squares of processed ham
00:38:38,00:38:40,and some squares of processed cheese
00:38:40,00:38:41,and some crackers.
00:38:41,00:38:42,- Right.
00:38:42,00:38:44,"- Yeah, must've been up all night thinking about it."
00:38:44,00:38:46,(laughing)
00:38:46,00:38:49,- I read a Sports Illustrated article on meat judging.
00:38:49,00:38:50,- That was great.
00:38:50,00:38:51,- It's an amazing article.
00:38:51,00:38:54,And there's a bit that explains exactly what it takes
00:38:54,00:38:56,to enter these competitions and be a meat.
00:38:56,00:38:59,"So to be a meat judge, quick decision making,"
00:38:59,00:39:02,"critical reasoning, self assurance,"
00:39:02,00:39:04,and above all the ability to quiet one's mind
00:39:04,00:39:07,for up to six hours standing in frigid temperatures
00:39:07,00:39:08,in total silence.
00:39:08,00:39:09,And according to a judge from 2015--
00:39:09,00:39:12,- Feels like the fourth point is quite a big step up.
00:39:12,00:39:14,"I was like self assurance, yeah."
00:39:14,00:39:15,"And then you read the fourth one and I was like,"
00:39:15,00:39:17,"ah, down, stop me."
00:39:17,00:39:18,- Fifth ability to judge meat.
00:39:18,00:39:19,(laughing)
00:39:19,00:39:20,- Exactly.
00:39:20,00:39:23,"But what the quote from the judge from 2015 said,"
00:39:23,00:39:24,"and this is to do with the total silence,"
00:39:24,00:39:26,you have to fight your own demons
00:39:26,00:39:28,in the meat judging cooler.
00:39:28,00:39:30,"- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
00:39:30,00:39:32,- I don't want to fight demons in a meat judging cooler.
00:39:32,00:39:34,- Who are the demons in the meat judging cooler?
00:39:34,00:39:35,- All yours.
00:39:35,00:39:36,It's just the internal voices.
00:39:36,00:39:38,- The internal voices in the six hours
00:39:38,00:39:40,of silence as you stare and trying to work out
00:39:40,00:39:41,if it's agriculturally sound.
00:39:41,00:39:42,"- There are moments where,"
00:39:42,00:39:44,so this might have been in the same piece.
00:39:44,00:39:46,There was a student from Texas Tech.
00:39:46,00:39:48,She was called Taylor Schertz.
00:39:48,00:39:50,She was a second year student.
00:39:50,00:39:51,What's that?
00:39:51,00:39:53,(laughing)
00:39:53,00:39:56,"Again, I think a rom-com set in the meat judging world"
00:39:56,00:39:58,"would be, genuinely would be good."
00:39:58,00:39:58,- Meat cute.
00:39:58,00:39:59,- Meat cute.
00:39:59,00:40:00,There we go.
00:40:00,00:40:01,"- Oh, God."
00:40:01,00:40:04,- The heads bump over a frozen beef cart.
00:40:04,00:40:05,(laughing)
00:40:05,00:40:07,"- No, so she, at one point,"
00:40:07,00:40:09,was the foremost meat judge in the country.
00:40:09,00:40:11,"And I think, I don't know what year this was."
00:40:11,00:40:14,"She was competing, but there was a competition in Houston."
00:40:14,00:40:17,"This just shows you how brutal meat judging is, right?"
00:40:17,00:40:19,She was in the top 10 nationally.
00:40:19,00:40:20,She was doing brilliantly.
00:40:20,00:40:24,And then she misjudged the age of one beef carcass
00:40:24,00:40:27,and plummeted down to 36.
00:40:27,00:40:28,- Wow. - To 36 position.
00:40:28,00:40:29,"So, you know, just, it can be--"
00:40:29,00:40:31,- How wrong did she get it really wrong?
00:40:31,00:40:32,(laughing)
00:40:32,00:40:36,- This meat is from 1743.
00:40:36,00:40:38,- I think this meat's alive.
00:40:38,00:40:40,(laughing)
00:40:40,00:40:41,"- I don't know, it doesn't relate,"
00:40:41,00:40:44,"but it just goes to show it's, it's tough."
00:40:44,00:40:45,I think they have some in Australia too.
00:40:45,00:40:47,I think there is meat judging there too.
00:40:47,00:40:48,- Wow.
00:40:48,00:40:51,- It sounds like you have to judge the hot carcass weight.
00:40:51,00:40:52,- Yeah.
00:40:52,00:40:54,"- The amount of kidney fat, amount of heart fat,"
00:40:54,00:40:56,area of rib eye muscle.
00:40:56,00:40:57,- All from just looking at it.
00:40:57,00:40:58,- Yeah.
00:40:58,00:41:00,"- If you got stuck in a freezer,"
00:41:00,00:41:01,"like one of these big butcher freezers,"
00:41:01,00:41:05,"let's say you're kind of, the door closes itself,"
00:41:05,00:41:07,"but you put your foot there to stop it from closing,"
00:41:07,00:41:10,but then you slip on a sausage or something.
00:41:10,00:41:13,And your foot goes out of the way and the door closes.
00:41:13,00:41:15,It doesn't open from the inside.
00:41:15,00:41:17,What's the best thing inside the freezer
00:41:17,00:41:20,"to help you get through that door, I would say?"
00:41:20,00:41:21,- Do you know the answer?
00:41:21,00:41:23,"- Yeah, this is a real thing that happened last."
00:41:23,00:41:24,"- Oh, wasn't, yeah, wasn't there a guy"
00:41:24,00:41:27,who beat his way out with something?
00:41:27,00:41:29,(laughing)
00:41:29,00:41:30,- Is there a bone?
00:41:30,00:41:31,"- Oh, a bone."
00:41:31,00:41:32,- Interesting.
00:41:32,00:41:34,"- A skeleton key bone that you can,"
00:41:34,00:41:38,"yeah, he calves, he's a whittler."
00:41:38,00:41:40,"- Well, you get the wishbone"
00:41:40,00:41:41,and you wish that you can get one.
00:41:41,00:41:44,(laughing)
00:41:44,00:41:46,- It's not having a poo and using the frozen poo too.
00:41:46,00:41:47,"- No, I don't."
00:41:47,00:41:50,"- Dan, you're in a freezer, everything's frozen."
00:41:50,00:41:52,There's no need to have the poo.
00:41:52,00:41:54,- If only I had something to freeze.
00:41:54,00:41:55,(laughing)
00:41:55,00:41:57,Guess I gotta take a shit.
00:41:57,00:42:01,- That's the only logical thing to do here.
00:42:01,00:42:02,Shit my way out.
00:42:02,00:42:06,"- Dan, this lift has been stopped for just 30 seconds."
00:42:06,00:42:07,Wait to see it.
00:42:07,00:42:09,"- No, no, no, I insist, I'll get us out of this."
00:42:09,00:42:13,- I must freeze the poo to fashion it into a presser
00:42:13,00:42:15,to press the button for help.
00:42:15,00:42:17,(laughing)
00:42:17,00:42:20,- A room full of frozen meats.
00:42:20,00:42:22,"I'll find my own tools, thank you."
00:42:22,00:42:24,(laughing)
00:42:25,00:42:27,- So you say no to that though.
00:42:27,00:42:28,- Why did I never broadcast your Desert Island Dicks
00:42:28,00:42:29,"episode, Dan?"
00:42:29,00:42:30,(laughing)
00:42:30,00:42:32,"- No music for me, thank you, Laura."
00:42:32,00:42:33,- My next track.
00:42:33,00:42:34,(laughing)
00:42:34,00:42:36,- So your luxury item is...
00:42:36,00:42:38,(laughing)
00:42:38,00:42:42,"- No, it wasn't that."
00:42:42,00:42:43,- What happened?
00:42:43,00:42:43,- What?
00:42:43,00:42:44,- This really happened.
00:42:44,00:42:46,- Now this really happened to a guy called Mr. McCabe
00:42:46,00:42:50,who's a butcher and apparently the beef is too slippery.
00:42:50,00:42:51,"If you grab a frozen beef,"
00:42:51,00:42:53,it's kind of too slippy to bash your way out.
00:42:53,00:42:54,- Okay.
00:42:54,00:42:56,"- If you get a big sort of chunk of lamb,"
00:42:56,00:42:59,"you can't really, you can't get any purchase on it"
00:42:59,00:43:01,and it's often too big.
00:43:01,00:43:04,But the perfect thing is a black pudding.
00:43:04,00:43:06,"If you get a full black pudding,"
00:43:06,00:43:08,"especially one made by the Royal Butcher,"
00:43:08,00:43:12,"H.M. Sheridan of Ballata, Aberdeenshire."
00:43:12,00:43:13,These are exactly the right size.
00:43:13,00:43:14,- That's specific.
00:43:14,00:43:15,Did he tell you this last?
00:43:15,00:43:17,- What a weird secret sponsorship.
00:43:17,00:43:19,(laughing)
00:43:19,00:43:21,- Are you getting money on the side?
00:43:21,00:43:24,- Apparently it's almost exactly the same size
00:43:24,00:43:26,because you know one of those police battering rams
00:43:26,00:43:28,that you knock down on the dance floor.
00:43:28,00:43:29,It's like that.
00:43:29,00:43:33,And this guy managed to knock his way out of the freezer
00:43:33,00:43:36,"and he said, I'm really lucky."
00:43:36,00:43:38,We sell about two or three each week
00:43:38,00:43:40,and this was the last one we had.
00:43:40,00:43:40,- Oh wow.
00:43:40,00:43:41,"- So if he'd have sold one more,"
00:43:41,00:43:42,he would have been stuck there forever.
00:43:42,00:43:43,- That's brilliant.
00:43:43,00:43:45,- Are they buying them as battering rams?
00:43:45,00:43:47,Is that Aberdeen police?
00:43:47,00:43:49,(laughing)
00:43:49,00:43:51,"- As he leaves the freezer, he looks back"
00:43:51,00:43:52,and he's down in the corner.
00:43:52,00:43:53,"- Daddy, you're coming."
00:43:53,00:43:55,"No, thank you."
00:43:55,00:43:57,- I'll get myself now.
00:43:57,00:43:57,- 20 more shits.
00:43:57,00:43:59,I should have a battered ram out of this.
00:43:59,00:44:00,- I've got a sister.
00:44:00,00:44:02,"- Type we went to an escape room with you, daddy."
00:44:02,00:44:04,(laughing)
00:44:04,00:44:05,"- Yeah, no lab back there."
00:44:05,00:44:07,- How about this?
00:44:07,00:44:08,How about putting a door handle
00:44:08,00:44:09,on the other side of the door?
00:44:09,00:44:12,"- Yeah, I mean, why do we not?"
00:44:12,00:44:14,"- Honestly, most of them do have."
00:44:14,00:44:15,"- Okay, most do."
00:44:15,00:44:16,- Any that I've been in have got a big red button
00:44:16,00:44:18,that you can press and get out.
00:44:18,00:44:19,"- That's cool, yeah."
00:44:19,00:44:21,"- Sorry, how many freezers have you been in"
00:44:21,00:44:23,that the door's shut and you have to let yourself out of?
00:44:23,00:44:24,- A couple.
00:44:24,00:44:25,(laughing)
00:44:25,00:44:26,- Okay.
00:44:26,00:44:27,- I used to work in kitchens and stuff.
00:44:27,00:44:29,"- Oh, okay, okay."
00:44:29,00:44:34,Have you guys heard of wretchtubklat?
00:44:34,00:44:35,- Wretchtubklat.
00:44:35,00:44:35,- The rapper.
00:44:35,00:44:36,- I don't even know.
00:44:36,00:44:37,(laughing)
00:44:37,00:44:39,I don't even know what you're saying.
00:44:39,00:44:41,- Wretchtubklat.
00:44:41,00:44:42,How do you spell klat?
00:44:42,00:44:44,- K-L-A-T.
00:44:44,00:44:48,- This sounds like it's something from the Netherlands.
00:44:48,00:44:49,- It's actually Australia.
00:44:49,00:44:50,"- Oh, okay, this is wrong."
00:44:50,00:44:53,"- Wretchtubklat, is it a kind of meat, a rare meat?"
00:44:53,00:44:54,- No.
00:44:54,00:44:57,- Is it a town like one of those weird sort of outback towns?
00:44:57,00:44:58,- No.
00:44:58,00:44:59,- A society?
00:44:59,00:45:00,- No.
00:45:00,00:45:01,- It's part of a kangaroo?
00:45:01,00:45:02,- No.
00:45:02,00:45:03,"- What, is it anything to do with what anything"
00:45:03,00:45:04,we're talking about?
00:45:04,00:45:06,- Is it a way of cheating at cricket?
00:45:06,00:45:09,"- It's, oh, there we are."
00:45:09,00:45:11,James single-handedly lowering our Australian audience
00:45:11,00:45:13,to zero as the weeks go by.
00:45:13,00:45:16,"No, what is it?"
00:45:16,00:45:19,It is a secret butcher language.
00:45:19,00:45:21,"- No wonder we haven't heard it, it's a secret."
00:45:21,00:45:23,"- It's a butcher language, that's great."
00:45:23,00:45:24,- It's a secret butcher language.
00:45:24,00:45:27,"Okay, so what do you think the secret language is?"
00:45:27,00:45:30,"- Oh, it's in meat displays in the window."
00:45:30,00:45:31,"- Oh, I see."
00:45:31,00:45:33,- So you arrange the sofas.
00:45:33,00:45:34,- And it means I'm available.
00:45:34,00:45:36,"- Yeah, it's like a traffic light party,"
00:45:36,00:45:37,but for butchers only.
00:45:37,00:45:39,"- Yeah, yeah, but for butchers."
00:45:39,00:45:42,"- Well, the clue is in the name, Wretchtubklat."
00:45:42,00:45:43,"- Oh, if you read it backwards,"
00:45:43,00:45:45,or is it an anagram?
00:45:45,00:45:47,"- Wretchtub, butcher, but talk butcher."
00:45:47,00:45:48,Butcher talk.
00:45:48,00:45:51,Butcher talk is the secret language that is shared.
00:45:51,00:45:54,And this has been going since the 1960s.
00:45:54,00:45:56,"Butchers all over Australia use this,"
00:45:56,00:45:59,and it's been in Australian movies as well.
00:45:59,00:46:01,Whereby they talk backwards to each other
00:46:01,00:46:04,so that they can say stuff that the customer can't hear
00:46:04,00:46:07,"in order to, yeah, absolutely."
00:46:07,00:46:08,- In order to talk.
00:46:08,00:46:09,"- Quick, get the age sauce."
00:46:09,00:46:11,(all laughing)
00:46:11,00:46:12,- In order to what?
00:46:12,00:46:17,"- So you might say, on steltuck, knee, et, poos,"
00:46:18,00:46:21,(all laughing)
00:46:21,00:46:24,and that means no cutlets in the shop.
00:46:24,00:46:25,And you would say that out loud
00:46:25,00:46:28,"so that everyone, sometimes a massive butchers in Australia"
00:46:28,00:46:30,"might have 20 butchers, the serving people,"
00:46:30,00:46:31,and they would know to just immediately eliminate that
00:46:31,00:46:32,as part of the process.
00:46:32,00:46:34,"- Ah, I see, but you don't upset the customer."
00:46:34,00:46:37,"- Exactly, and you don't want to upset the customer."
00:46:37,00:46:40,On dug kuf e kaff.
00:46:40,00:46:42,"Oh, good food."
00:46:42,00:46:43,- Fake.
00:46:43,00:46:44,"- It's no good, fuck face."
00:46:44,00:46:47,(all laughing)
00:46:47,00:46:49,- Really good that they've worked that out.
00:46:49,00:46:51,"- It's pretty, like the rest of it,"
00:46:51,00:46:54,"like as the examples, it's pretty misogynistic, I have to say."
00:46:54,00:46:55,- Why is it needed though?
00:46:55,00:46:58,"- Well, largely because if there's a difficult customer,"
00:46:58,00:47:00,they want to be able to say difficult customer.
00:47:00,00:47:01,- To be rude about it.
00:47:01,00:47:03,"- It feels like, but the most of customer facing roles"
00:47:03,00:47:06,"that haven't had to do this, has there?"
00:47:06,00:47:08,"- Yeah, no, but I guess you're all in one line"
00:47:08,00:47:11,"and if you need to get a message down the line to,"
00:47:11,00:47:12,everyone hears it in the shop.
00:47:12,00:47:14,- So you're already sticking up for these sexist butchers.
00:47:14,00:47:17,"- I'm not, I'm telling you that it exists."
00:47:17,00:47:18,That's what I'm trying to say.
00:47:18,00:47:20,"- It's actually in my rom-com now,"
00:47:20,00:47:21,the meat judging rom-com.
00:47:21,00:47:23,"I think there should be a nice, like maybe the lovers"
00:47:23,00:47:27,"speak to each other using a butcher talk,"
00:47:27,00:47:27,whatever it was called.
00:47:27,00:47:28,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:47:28,00:47:29,- Something clatch.
00:47:29,00:47:30,"- Yeah, retch tub clatch."
00:47:30,00:47:31,- Retch tub clatch.
00:47:31,00:47:32,"- Yeah, subtitled the entire movie"
00:47:32,00:47:35,"so that you can see what makes it more classy, I guess."
00:47:35,00:47:37,"- Yeah, but it just says no good, fuck face."
00:47:37,00:47:38,"But along the bottom of the,"
00:47:38,00:47:40,"that's nice and romantic, isn't it?"
00:47:40,00:47:42,"- That's the closing line, that's it."
00:47:42,00:47:44,"- And the kiss, and..."
00:47:44,00:47:45,"- Frankly, my dear."
00:47:45,00:47:46,(all laughing)
00:47:46,00:47:48,- I don't do cook-a-club.
00:47:48,00:47:50,(upbeat music)
00:47:50,00:47:56,"- Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show."
00:47:56,00:47:57,And that is my fact.
00:47:57,00:48:01,My fact this week is that the first wireless headset microphone
00:48:01,00:48:03,was made for Kate Bush.
00:48:03,00:48:06,And it was made out of an old coat hanger.
00:48:06,00:48:07,"- Oh, wow."
00:48:07,00:48:08,"First of all, how?"
00:48:08,00:48:11,"- Well, you're just making it sort of go around the ears,"
00:48:11,00:48:11,aren't you?
00:48:11,00:48:14,"You need the perfect bit that actually,"
00:48:14,00:48:15,that you use the hanger.
00:48:15,00:48:16,- Yeah.
00:48:16,00:48:18,"- You would attach the microphone, which would be--"
00:48:18,00:48:20,"- Oh, so you're just wearing a coat hanger around your ear?"
00:48:20,00:48:21,"- Exactly. - Oh, okay."
00:48:21,00:48:22,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:48:22,00:48:23,"- It's basically those Madonna mics, right?"
00:48:23,00:48:24,- Yeah.
00:48:24,00:48:26,"- Those steps mics, I would call them, but yes."
00:48:26,00:48:27,"- Yeah, Brittany Mike."
00:48:27,00:48:27,- Brittany Mike.
00:48:27,00:48:28,- Brittany Mike.
00:48:28,00:48:29,"It should be called a Bush Mike, basically,"
00:48:29,00:48:31,because she is the founder.
00:48:31,00:48:34,"- Does it quite roll up too well, does it?"
00:48:34,00:48:35,(all laughing)
00:48:35,00:48:38,"At best, you're thinking of a problematic president,"
00:48:38,00:48:40,"at worst, if you're thinking of something much,"
00:48:40,00:48:42,much more than what you are.
00:48:42,00:48:44,"- But yeah, so this is, so it's interesting to know"
00:48:44,00:48:47,that we know the very first time anyone wore
00:48:47,00:48:49,"one of these Madonna Brittany mics,"
00:48:49,00:48:50,and it was Kate Bush.
00:48:50,00:48:53,"It was on her tour, The Tour of Life, in 1979."
00:48:53,00:48:56,"It was a song called Moving, which was the opening number,"
00:48:56,00:48:58,and the reason that she needed it
00:48:58,00:49:00,was because there was so much choreography.
00:49:00,00:49:03,"There was so much costume change and everything,"
00:49:03,00:49:05,movement that she needed her hands
00:49:05,00:49:06,for everything that she did.
00:49:06,00:49:07,She couldn't hold a microphone.
00:49:07,00:49:10,So it was one of the sound engineers.
00:49:10,00:49:12,Two names come up when you look into it.
00:49:12,00:49:14,"It's a bit hard to nail it down,"
00:49:14,00:49:17,but one person was called Martin Fisher.
00:49:17,00:49:18,A lot of people said it was him.
00:49:18,00:49:20,Some people say it was Gordon Patterson.
00:49:20,00:49:21,"It was definitely one of the two,"
00:49:21,00:49:23,"and it was on this tour that it was done,"
00:49:23,00:49:27,and it was done on Kate Bush's only ever tour that she did.
00:49:27,00:49:27,- She only did one tour.
00:49:27,00:49:29,- She's never done another tour.
00:49:29,00:49:30,She's done a residency.
00:49:30,00:49:32,- She's not allowed to travel to Zarkite.
00:49:32,00:49:32,"- Oh, really?"
00:49:32,00:49:34,"- Yeah, she's not into it."
00:49:34,00:49:37,And it's a shame because it sounds like
00:49:37,00:49:39,she might've been one of the greatest touring acts
00:49:39,00:49:40,that you could ever see.
00:49:40,00:49:41,"I mean, this--"
00:49:41,00:49:43,- What would she have invented on her future tours?
00:49:43,00:49:44,"- Exactly, yeah."
00:49:44,00:49:46,"But listen, so this, the Tour of Life,"
00:49:46,00:49:48,"as I say it was called,"
00:49:48,00:49:49,this is like a few highlights
00:49:49,00:49:51,"that you would've seen in that show, right?"
00:49:51,00:49:54,So we opened with Whalesong that was playing
00:49:54,00:49:56,with Kate Bush's shadow projected dancing
00:49:56,00:49:58,while the curtains were starting to part
00:49:58,00:50:00,and revealing the stage.
00:50:00,00:50:02,"And then after a song or two,"
00:50:02,00:50:05,the whole theater was filled with the sound of heartbeats
00:50:05,00:50:07,and red lights.
00:50:07,00:50:12,There was large oval upholstered red satin egg womb-like ball
00:50:12,00:50:14,that would be rolled onto stage with Kate inside
00:50:14,00:50:16,where she would sing the song Room for the Life
00:50:16,00:50:18,"as she was rolled around the stage,"
00:50:18,00:50:21,hence not being able to use her hands.
00:50:21,00:50:23,There was a moment where she was singing a song
00:50:23,00:50:26,called Violin where she was chased around the stage
00:50:26,00:50:28,by two dancers dressed as giant violins.
00:50:28,00:50:30,There was poetry readings from her brother.
00:50:30,00:50:33,A magician came out and did an act with a floating wand.
00:50:33,00:50:36,She came out as a World War II pilot.
00:50:36,00:50:40,She came out as a Wild Western cowboy-esque looking thing
00:50:40,00:50:44,with a rifle and she would shoot ribbons at the dancers.
00:50:44,00:50:46,"I mean, the whole thing with every song"
00:50:46,00:50:47,had a theme and a production to it
00:50:47,00:50:49,"and it was a spectacle, basically."
00:50:49,00:50:51,- She's probably still writing the second song.
00:50:51,00:50:52,(laughing)
00:50:52,00:50:54,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:50:54,00:50:57,"- I did go and sit, do you know about,"
00:50:57,00:51:00,"what would it have been about 2016, maybe 2015,"
00:51:00,00:51:03,"something like that, nearly 10 years ago,"
00:51:03,00:51:08,she did a night of about 20 nights at Hammersmith Apollo
00:51:08,00:51:11,and me and my mum managed to get tickets.
00:51:11,00:51:14,"It was like, you know, when you get set up all the laptops,"
00:51:14,00:51:16,it's like NASA space station trying to get tickets.
00:51:16,00:51:17,"- F5, F5, F5."
00:51:17,00:51:19,"- We got them, literally, we got them"
00:51:19,00:51:22,"and that was pretty, pretty good."
00:51:22,00:51:24,It was the first time she performed live
00:51:24,00:51:26,"in somewhere like 25 years, unreal."
00:51:26,00:51:30,"And she flew, she flew at the, no, she did, she flew."
00:51:30,00:51:32,So she did this song at the end
00:51:32,00:51:36,where suddenly like a big crash of thunder happened
00:51:36,00:51:39,"and I don't, I mean, obviously she'll have been attached"
00:51:39,00:51:43,"to it, but like, you know the room I'm talking about,"
00:51:43,00:51:45,"the Apollo, right?"
00:51:45,00:51:47,"I don't know, 'cause she wasn't attached"
00:51:47,00:51:49,"to the ceiling directly above the audience,"
00:51:49,00:51:52,"but she flew right out to like,"
00:51:52,00:51:55,what looked like touching distance to touch in the circle.
00:51:55,00:51:57,"And she's, I think, you know, she wouldn't mind"
00:51:57,00:51:59,"of saying this, she's getting on his arcade."
00:51:59,00:52:01,"Like, it was-- - She's 50 something now."
00:52:01,00:52:03,"- I gasped purely out of admiration,"
00:52:03,00:52:05,purely out of concern for her welfare
00:52:05,00:52:07,as she flew directly towards us.
00:52:07,00:52:09,We were in the circle.
00:52:09,00:52:12,"It was like, absolutely terrifying"
00:52:12,00:52:14,and incredible and mesmerising.
00:52:14,00:52:16,"- Yeah, I think she's in her 60s now."
00:52:16,00:52:18,"- Blimey. - Yeah, yeah."
00:52:18,00:52:21,"- Was that by any chance, Wuthering Heights,"
00:52:21,00:52:22,when she was doing that song?
00:52:22,00:52:23,"- No, it wasn't that song, no, no."
00:52:23,00:52:26,"It was like a, it was a really aggressive song."
00:52:26,00:52:29,"It was that big crash of thunder and then she just sort of,"
00:52:29,00:52:31,I think it was called the dawn of something
00:52:31,00:52:32,and she just flew out to us
00:52:32,00:52:34,and she looked like a big crow.
00:52:34,00:52:37,"- And at the time, did you think she's flying?"
00:52:37,00:52:38,- Yeah. - You did?
00:52:38,00:52:39,"- Yeah, I did."
00:52:39,00:52:40,- I would as well with Kate Bush.
00:52:40,00:52:41,She has mystical qualities.
00:52:41,00:52:43,"- Yeah, yeah, it was so good."
00:52:43,00:52:45,"- Maybe she did, maybe she invented something."
00:52:45,00:52:46,- There we go.
00:52:46,00:52:48,"- We don't have yet, like the bush rocket,"
00:52:48,00:52:51,which kind of flies her up in the air.
00:52:51,00:52:52,Something hidden.
00:52:52,00:52:53,- Maybe that's why she doesn't talk
00:52:53,00:52:56,"'cause she's like, I don't want everybody to know about it."
00:52:56,00:52:57,- Yeah.
00:52:57,00:53:02,"I've invented flying, but I don't want to, I don't want to brag."
00:53:02,00:53:07,"- So she, Kate Bush, shares a birthday with Emily Bronte,"
00:53:07,00:53:08,"who wrote ""Wuthering Heights""."
00:53:08,00:53:09,- No. - Which is her...
00:53:09,00:53:10,- It's interesting.
00:53:10,00:53:12,"- I'm not gonna say it's her big song,"
00:53:12,00:53:14,"but it's one of the biggest, isn't it?"
00:53:14,00:53:14,- That is big.
00:53:14,00:53:15,- That was the breakthrough song.
00:53:15,00:53:16,- Yeah. - Yeah.
00:53:16,00:53:17,- That is big.
00:53:17,00:53:21,"- And 30th of July, 1818 and 1958, respectively."
00:53:21,00:53:22,- That's amazing.
00:53:22,00:53:23,- And can I just tell you a quick thing
00:53:23,00:53:24,"about the word ""wuthering""?"
00:53:24,00:53:25,"- Oh yeah. - Yes, please."
00:53:25,00:53:26,- What does it mean?
00:53:26,00:53:27,"- Yeah, no idea."
00:53:27,00:53:29,"- Is it like any ""wuthering""?"
00:53:29,00:53:30,"- ""Wuthering Heights""."
00:53:30,00:53:31,"- ""Wuthering Heights""?"
00:53:31,00:53:33,- To fly to the circle of a venue.
00:53:33,00:53:33,"- That's it, that's it."
00:53:33,00:53:35,"- Yeah. - The ""wuthering height""."
00:53:35,00:53:36,"- It feels, on a matter of peocly,"
00:53:36,00:53:38,"it feels like ""wuthering"" almost."
00:53:38,00:53:39,- Yeah.
00:53:39,00:53:41,"- Like the wind, especially 'cause of the book,"
00:53:41,00:53:43,it feels like the moors are blowing stuff and...
00:53:43,00:53:45,"- That's pretty much it, is it?"
00:53:45,00:53:46,"- But it's pretty much, she, I think,"
00:53:46,00:53:50,"was just about the first to say ""wuthering"", 'cause it was..."
00:53:50,00:53:52,"- Is it ""wuthering"" but with a Yorkshire accent?"
00:53:52,00:53:53,- It's not. - It's not.
00:53:53,00:53:53,(laughing)
00:53:53,00:53:54,- It's not from there.
00:53:54,00:53:57,- It's a book dictated by Nora.
00:53:57,00:53:59,"- It was previously used much more as ""wuthering"","
00:53:59,00:54:02,"with an H, an extra H, ""wuthering"","
00:54:02,00:54:03,"which meant rushing along,"
00:54:03,00:54:04,"and it was usually a reference to wind,"
00:54:04,00:54:05,"like just like you were saying, James,"
00:54:05,00:54:10,"and a ""witherer"" was a lusty, a strong, or a stout person."
00:54:10,00:54:11,"- Really, 'cause like ""withered"" now"
00:54:11,00:54:13,is the opposite of lusty and strong.
00:54:13,00:54:14,"- And it's again with an extra H,"
00:54:14,00:54:16,"so it's a ""witherer"", you know,"
00:54:16,00:54:18,that was in the Francis Groves Dictionary
00:54:18,00:54:20,"of the Volga Tongue, his one was."
00:54:20,00:54:23,And there was also a word to make a whizzing
00:54:23,00:54:25,"or a rushing noise, which was ""to wuther""."
00:54:25,00:54:26,- To wuther.
00:54:26,00:54:28,"- So it could have been ""wuthering heights""."
00:54:28,00:54:29,"- That's ""wuthering heights""."
00:54:29,00:54:31,- It sounds like something Elmer Fudd would write.
00:54:31,00:54:32,(laughing)
00:54:32,00:54:33,"- ""Wuthering heights""."
00:54:33,00:54:36,"- It does sound like, ""Watch out, I'm watering here!"""
00:54:36,00:54:38,(laughing)
00:54:38,00:54:39,- She hadn't read the book
00:54:39,00:54:41,"when she wrote ""Wuthering Heights"", Kate Bush."
00:54:41,00:54:42,- Really?
00:54:42,00:54:44,- She gets a lot of the plot points in.
00:54:44,00:54:44,"- Oh, she does?"
00:54:44,00:54:45,- She must have read the spark notes or something.
00:54:45,00:54:48,"- She'd watched ""The Adaptation"" on the BBC,"
00:54:48,00:54:50,which was really big the year before.
00:54:50,00:54:52,It was absolutely massive.
00:54:52,00:54:54,And she wrote the song based on the book
00:54:54,00:54:56,and then later on read the book.
00:54:56,00:54:57,"- Oh, but that's dangerous,"
00:54:57,00:54:59,"'cause sometimes they really change the plot, don't they?"
00:54:59,00:55:00,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:55:00,00:55:03,"- I did, in me, a-level drama."
00:55:03,00:55:06,"We had to do, what's that Noel Coward play with Elvira?"
00:55:06,00:55:07,"""Blide Spirit""."
00:55:07,00:55:08,"- ""Blide Spirit""."
00:55:08,00:55:11,"- In the film, there's a car crash at the end,"
00:55:11,00:55:13,"and I hadn't read the rest of the play,"
00:55:13,00:55:15,and I just wrote about the car crash at the end.
00:55:15,00:55:16,(laughing)
00:55:16,00:55:18,"I got called into Mrs. Bray's office,"
00:55:18,00:55:20,"and she was like, ""So can you just tell me again?"""
00:55:20,00:55:24,Which bit inspired you to talk about the car crash scene?
00:55:24,00:55:27,"And I was literally just chatting pure,"
00:55:27,00:55:31,"I was woodering on, and she was like, ""Yep, yep."""
00:55:31,00:55:33,"And so it's not in the play, maybe,"
00:55:33,00:55:36,it's only in the film. - That's incredible.
00:55:36,00:55:37,- And she made me write it all again.
00:55:37,00:55:39,- I had the exact same experience
00:55:39,00:55:42,"with Winnie the Pooh and ""The Blustery Day"" as--"
00:55:42,00:55:44,"- Oh, come on. - In your A-levels."
00:55:44,00:55:45,(laughing)
00:55:45,00:55:46,"- Fortunately, the--"
00:55:46,00:55:48,- Did you think Winnie was a Pooh?
00:55:48,00:55:51,(laughing)
00:55:51,00:55:53,"- Piglet uses him to beat his way out of a freezer,"
00:55:53,00:55:55,doesn't he? (laughing)
00:55:55,00:55:56,"- No, fortunately, in my case,"
00:55:56,00:55:58,"the screen adaption was very close to the source material,"
00:55:58,00:56:03,"so I got away with it, but it was, I know that fear, yeah."
00:56:03,00:56:06,"- I searched on the newspaper archives,"
00:56:06,00:56:09,newspapers.com and the British newspaper archives
00:56:09,00:56:11,for the first mention of Kate Bush.
00:56:11,00:56:12,And the first mention I could find
00:56:12,00:56:15,"was from the Burton Observer and Chronicle,"
00:56:15,00:56:17,"and it was from the week that ""Wuthering Heights"" came out,"
00:56:17,00:56:19,because she was pretty unknown at that stage.
00:56:19,00:56:22,"And in the first week, it went to, I think,"
00:56:22,00:56:24,like number 29 in the charts.
00:56:24,00:56:27,"It wasn't like huge, but it was there."
00:56:27,00:56:30,"And the review said,"
00:56:30,00:56:33,how do we stop Emily Bronte spinning in her grave?
00:56:33,00:56:35,The easiest way would be to call back
00:56:35,00:56:39,"in all the copies of Kate Bush's ""Wuthering Heights""."
00:56:39,00:56:40,"Singing the role of ghostly Kathy,"
00:56:40,00:56:43,she appeals for Heathcliff to let her in.
00:56:43,00:56:45,"If Heathcliff has any sense,"
00:56:45,00:56:48,he'll plug his ears with cotton wool and go to bed.
00:56:48,00:56:49,- Wow. - What a tit.
00:56:49,00:56:52,- I believe that's the first review of that.
00:56:52,00:56:52,- Who wrote that?
00:56:52,00:56:54,"- It was in the Burton Observer,"
00:56:54,00:56:55,and it was just initials.
00:56:55,00:56:57,"I think it was said A-H or something,"
00:56:57,00:56:59,so I didn't say who the person was.
00:56:59,00:57:02,"- Oh, God, I bet A-H is just constantly hoping"
00:57:02,00:57:03,they never get revealed.
00:57:03,00:57:04,(laughing)
00:57:04,00:57:06,"- No, it must be a different A-H."
00:57:06,00:57:08,There was loads of people with A-H at the Burton.
00:57:08,00:57:10,- I really tried to look in the Burton Observer
00:57:10,00:57:13,and Chronicle history to see if anyone
00:57:13,00:57:14,"who'd worked there had these initials,"
00:57:14,00:57:15,and they couldn't find them.
00:57:15,00:57:16,"- Wow, you were trying to get a witch hunt going."
00:57:16,00:57:17,"- Oh, God. - I was gonna email them"
00:57:17,00:57:19,"and say, ""What do you think about it?"""
00:57:19,00:57:20,- Yeah. - But this is so weird
00:57:20,00:57:21,because there's another connection there.
00:57:21,00:57:24,The novel got shocking reviews when it came out.
00:57:24,00:57:25,- Really? - Yeah.
00:57:25,00:57:27,"So one said, ""The only consolation"
00:57:27,00:57:28,which we have in reflecting on it
00:57:28,00:57:30,"is that it will never be generally read."""
00:57:30,00:57:32,"- Oh, wow. - And another wrote,"
00:57:32,00:57:35,"""How a human being could have attempted"
00:57:35,00:57:37,such a book as the present without committing suicide
00:57:37,00:57:40,"before he had finished a dozen chapters is a mystery."""
00:57:40,00:57:40,- Wow. - Wow.
00:57:40,00:57:42,"- I mean, admittedly, I do own a copy"
00:57:42,00:57:43,"and haven't read it, so."
00:57:43,00:57:45,- Did you not read it at school?
00:57:45,00:57:46,"- No, we didn't. - Really?"
00:57:46,00:57:48,"- No, we didn't either."
00:57:48,00:57:50,- Really? - I've read it.
00:57:50,00:57:53,"It is, look, I'm an Ambronte fan."
00:57:53,00:57:54,I'm gonna put my cards on the table.
00:57:54,00:57:55,I prefer Anne.
00:57:55,00:57:57,I think Emily's a bit overrated.
00:57:57,00:57:58,"- Wow. - See, this is"
00:57:58,00:57:59,what we get like this far. - A-H.
00:57:59,00:58:00,(laughing)
00:58:00,00:58:03,"- I'm A-H-M, yeah, yeah. - He is, yeah."
00:58:03,00:58:04,- That is his initials. - Yeah.
00:58:04,00:58:07,"- I mean, is it possible that A-H was paying tribute"
00:58:07,00:58:10,"to he actually, or she actually loved the song"
00:58:10,00:58:12,and just wanted to reflect the original review
00:58:12,00:58:13,of the rap for the book itself? - I see.
00:58:13,00:58:15,"- No way, no way."
00:58:15,00:58:17,- Nah. - Seems implausible.
00:58:17,00:58:19,"- A-H is listening at home going, ""Yes, yes, buy it,"
00:58:19,00:58:21,"""buy that, yes, please."" (laughing)"
00:58:21,00:58:24,- But a wireless mic born from a coat hanger.
00:58:24,00:58:25,- Yeah.
00:58:25,00:58:28,"- That's exciting, 'cause now they're everywhere."
00:58:28,00:58:30,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:58:30,00:58:31,Just on microphones.
00:58:31,00:58:32,- Yeah. - Yeah.
00:58:32,00:58:35,"- In the 1930s, the BBC had a special microphone"
00:58:35,00:58:37,which was only for the use of the royal family.
00:58:37,00:58:39,- Oh. - And it's in the BBC
00:58:39,00:58:41,"to this day, it's an artifact of,"
00:58:41,00:58:44,so it was when they started doing royal broadcasts
00:58:44,00:58:45,"at Christmas, I think that was in the '30s."
00:58:45,00:58:46,"- Yeah, yeah. - I think it was George V."
00:58:46,00:58:47,"He started doing that. - Yeah, yeah."
00:58:47,00:58:49,- And I think a BBC sound engineer
00:58:49,00:58:53,saw the standard microphone that they were going to do it with
00:58:53,00:58:55,"and thought, ""This is not good enough for the king."""
00:58:55,00:58:56,"- Wow. - And just,"
00:58:56,00:59:00,"and quickly put some regal blue velvet cloth over it,"
00:59:00,00:59:03,which you would think would slightly dampen the--
00:59:03,00:59:04,"- It might help, it stops at some point."
00:59:04,00:59:05,"- It actually helps, yeah."
00:59:05,00:59:06,- Maybe a good point.
00:59:06,00:59:07,"And anyway, as the years went by,"
00:59:07,00:59:08,they got more and more elaborate.
00:59:08,00:59:12,"And so they ended up with this beautiful, weird-looking thing"
00:59:12,00:59:15,which was in a kind of gilded cage.
00:59:15,00:59:16,- Wow. - Yeah.
00:59:16,00:59:17,- It's from Dan's home.
00:59:17,00:59:17,- It's from Dan's home.
00:59:17,00:59:19,(all laughing)
00:59:19,00:59:20,- That's really cool.
00:59:20,00:59:23,"Is it because they worried that, like,"
00:59:23,00:59:25,non-regal spets might get into it or something?
00:59:25,00:59:27,"- No, I think it was just that we have to make it fancy"
00:59:27,00:59:29,for the king or queen to use.
00:59:29,00:59:31,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Kate Bush met the queen."
00:59:31,00:59:33,Went to Buckingham Palace in 2005.
00:59:33,00:59:34,She asked for her autograph.
00:59:34,00:59:35,- Who asked for whose autograph?
00:59:35,00:59:37,"- Bush asked for a queen. - Oh, okay."
00:59:37,00:59:39,- Yeah. - She's the queen.
00:59:39,00:59:40,Huge fan.
00:59:40,00:59:42,"- I mean, it's plausible, isn't it?"
00:59:42,00:59:43,- It is plausible.
00:59:43,00:59:45,- And what did the queen do?
00:59:45,00:59:46,"- Fuck off. - Yeah, exactly."
00:59:46,00:59:48,- The queen's not allowed to give out autographs.
00:59:48,00:59:49,I think. - She's not.
00:59:49,00:59:51,"- Okay, someone tries to do credit card for all of that."
00:59:51,00:59:51,"- You're not allowed to, yeah."
00:59:51,00:59:53,- That's just scamming the queen.
00:59:53,00:59:54,(all laughing)
00:59:54,00:59:55,"- No, what is it?"
00:59:55,00:59:58,"- She said, (speaking foreign language)"
00:59:58,00:59:59,"- Oh, right."
00:59:59,01:00:00,(all laughing)
01:00:00,01:00:01,"- If you were gonna try and scam the queen,"
01:00:01,01:00:02,you did the mum's maiden name.
01:00:02,01:00:04,"- Yeah, post-lion, yeah. - And often, she did haven't--"
01:00:04,01:00:06,"- And then you could, the name of the first--"
01:00:06,01:00:08,- Streety grew up on? - Yeah.
01:00:08,01:00:10,- The actual heirs that just have like a first name.
01:00:10,01:00:12,"- Charles Windsor and stuff like that, I guess."
01:00:12,01:00:14,"- Oh, yeah."
01:00:14,01:00:16,"- I think if you had the queen's autograph,"
01:00:16,01:00:18,you might be able to start wars against other countries.
01:00:18,01:00:19,"- Yes, that's true."
01:00:19,01:00:20,"- Oh, yeah, that's probably--"
01:00:20,01:00:21,- That's a big thing.
01:00:21,01:00:22,"And Kate Bush, as we know--"
01:00:22,01:00:23,- It's arguably more--
01:00:23,01:00:24,- She does want to do that.
01:00:24,01:00:25,She has tried several times.
01:00:25,01:00:27,- I would say that poses a bigger threat as well
01:00:27,01:00:29,than just logging into the queen's Amazon prime.
01:00:29,01:00:30,(all laughing)
01:00:30,01:00:32,- I can't imagine anyone called Bush
01:00:32,01:00:33,starting a legal war.
01:00:33,01:00:34,(all laughing)
01:00:34,01:00:35,- That sounds very unlikely.
01:00:35,01:00:37,"- No, no."
01:00:37,01:00:39,(upbeat music)
01:00:39,01:00:42,"- Okay, that's it."
01:00:42,01:00:43,That is all of our facts.
