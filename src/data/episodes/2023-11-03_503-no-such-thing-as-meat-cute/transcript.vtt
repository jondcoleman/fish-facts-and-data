00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.320
 - Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.000
 of No Six Things of Fish, where we were joined

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.360
 by the incredibly funny, amazing, Maisie Adam.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.920
 Now anyone who is familiar with our parent TV show, QI,

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.760
 will know all about Maisie.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.840
 She's burst onto the scene in the last few years

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.640
 and it is no exaggeration to say

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.880
 that I think she is the funniest newcomer

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.160
 that we've had on QI over the last few years.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.540
 She's absolutely brilliant.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.000
 It was a great fun doing this show with her.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.280
 If you'd like to learn anything more about Maisie,

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.480
 then the best way to find out what she's doing

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.920
 is to go to her website, which is MaisieAdam.com.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.440
 M-A-I-S-I-E-A-D-A-M.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.920
 One thing I should quickly mention

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.480
 is that Maisie mentions Ethan in this show.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.080
 That was a reference to something that happened

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.760
 before the microphones came on, but I had to keep it in.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:52.680
 So just to let you know,

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.400
 Ethan is one of the QILs who does a lot of our tech stuff.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.940
 If you are a Clubfish member,

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.920
 you might remember his episode of "Meet the Elves"

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.340
 where he gave us a fiendish question that we had to solve.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.580
 We do those "Meet the Elves" shows every now and then

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:10.500
 on Clubfish.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.740
 It's one very good reason, one of many in fact,

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:14.940
 that you should subscribe.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.920
 And if you'd like to do that, then you can go to, of course,

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.540
 no such thing as a fish.com/apple

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.620
 and no such thing as a fish.com/patreon.

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.380
 Anyway, one final thing before we do the show,

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.120
 today's episode marks the end of our nine months

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.320
 of Anna Replacement shows.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:34.820
 Yes, you got it.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.600
 Next week, she will be back.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.400
 Anna will be back on the podcast.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.960
 So whatever you do, don't miss that episode.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.160
 Listen to it 10 times.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.400
 You want her to see the figures boosting up

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.240
 when she comes back on the show.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.200
 But in the meantime,

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.400
 really hope you enjoy this show with Maisie.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.040
 And all that's left to say is on with the podcast.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.600
 (upbeat music)

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:10.760
 - Hello, and welcome to another episode

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.320
 of No Such Thing as a Fish,

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.080
 a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Hoburn.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.400
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.200
 I'm sitting here with James Harkin,

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.760
 Andrew Hunter Murray, and Maisie Adam.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:22.600
 And once again,

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.120
 we have gathered around the microphones

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.840
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.960
 And in no particular order, here we go.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.640
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Maisie.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.480
 - Okay, here we go.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.000
 The first fizzy drink tasted of urine.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.960
 Do with that what you will.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.840
 Do with that what you will.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.720
 - Not drink it, that's first of all.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:45.800
 - So it was Fanta.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.440
 No, sorry, that's what mankind.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.360
 - Oh, to slam.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.200
 - To slam.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.440
 - Expect a cease and desist from Fanta offices.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.920
 - What a slam on a soft drink

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.960
 that was invented for the Nazis.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.280
 - Was it really Fanta?

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.120
 - I believe it was.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.960
 - It was.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.920
 - But what a good target for me to pick, really, I suppose.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:02.760
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.800
 - If you were going to kick one, yeah, Fanta's the one.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.920
 - I think they couldn't get American soft drinks,

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.760
 and so they had to make their own.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.920
 And it wasn't the Nazis, Hitler wasn't on the floor,

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.220
 sorting it out himself,

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.560
 but it was made during the Nazi regime.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.160
 - Oh, okay, by Nazis.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.480
 - No, by Nazis, for Nazis.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.960
 - That was the slogan, oh God.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.520
 But the first fizzy drink was invented

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.560
 in my hometown of Leeds by a man called Joseph Priestley.

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.040
 But crucially, it tasted of urine.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.520
 - Because people in Leeds--

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.880
 - We know what we like and we like what we know.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.240
 - Here's the crucial question, though.

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.160
 It tasted of urine, but did it have urine in it?

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.720
 - Yes, it did.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.400
 So how did he invent this?

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.400
 How did he invent this work?

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.440
 - Accidentally, as all best things come about.

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.000
 Accidentally, it was at this brewery,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.560
 he basically accidentally discovered

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.560
 the act of carbonating water, right?

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.040
 He was like a human soda stream, but by accident.

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.200
 - Right, brilliant.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.040
 So he's worked out how to carbonate water.

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.320
 And then what he does is he makes a machine

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.760
 where you can get the CO2 and you can squeeze it

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.840
 into some water and it'll make it fizzy.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.200
 But as part of that machine, he had a pig's bladder.

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.040
 - Okay.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:18.860
 - Just on hand.

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:19.700
 - Just on hand.

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.840
 In those days, it was quite common to have pigs' bladders.

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.880
 You know, you used to play football with pigs' bladders.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.040
 It was part of day-to-day life.

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.840
 - Everyone had a pig's bladder on them.

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.100
 Like a pen nowadays.

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.240
 (laughing)

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.480
 - Can I borrow your pigs' bladder?

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:32.320
 - Yeah.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.320
 - Dan, can I borrow a pig's bladder?

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:34.360
 - This one's been chewed.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.720
 (laughing)

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.600
 So he had a pig's bladder as part of the system.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.720
 And he gave one of his glasses of water, fizzy water,

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.040
 to a friend called John Nooth.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.440
 And John Nooth said, "This tastes like piss."

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.720
 Like, you can't sell this to people

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.880
 because it tastes disgusting, it tastes like piss.

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.680
 And he thought that it tasted like piss

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.120
 because it had been squeezed through this bladder.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.240
 Now, Priestly couldn't taste the piss in his own water.

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.120
 He thought that it tasted absolutely fine.

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.960
 - Okay.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.480
 - And he claimed that Nooth's servants

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.880
 were maybe urinating in his drinks

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.960
 because he was such a bad boss.

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:09.780
 - Why?

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:10.620
 - Really, it was a rift between.

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:11.460
 - It really was.

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.400
 You know, this is sharing your scientific discovery

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.680
 with a colleague, like Nooth, that's a big deal.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:16.520
 - Yeah.

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.640
 - But Nooth said, he wrote a paper,

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.600
 he didn't even quietly say to Priestly,

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.120
 "I think this tastes a bit pissy."

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.080
 He wrote a paper for the Royal Society saying,

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.480
 "In some trials, which I have made

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:27.760
 "with Dr. Priestly's apparatus,

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.840
 "it always happened that the water acquired

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.200
 "and urinous flavor."

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.040
 (laughing)

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.880
 - That's bad, isn't it?

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.040
 - And it was so predominant that it could not be swallowed

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.600
 without some degree of reluctance.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.920
 - And he didn't run that by Priestly first.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:39.760
 - No.

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:40.600
 - Just going, "Can I just double check?

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.600
 "I'm not the only one tasting weed here."

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.120
 - I'm glad you didn't, like, you know, you've got B.O.,

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.240
 and instead of your friends telling you you've got B.O.,

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.800
 they go to the Royal Society, and that's pretty bad.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:50.640
 - Yeah, that's amazing.

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:53.600
 - Priestly claimed that many ladies had tried the water,

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.760
 and nobody had complained about the urinous flavor.

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.480
 - He's not looking good for Nooth here.

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.240
 - So does history tell us whether or not

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.760
 his servants were pissing?

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:02.600
 - Well, we don't know.

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:03.440
 - We don't know.

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:04.280
 - That seems unlikely.

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:05.880
 - But no, and then no one else reported

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:06.720
 the urin flavor outside of him?

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.920
 - Well, then Nooth invented a new system

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:10.880
 that didn't have pigs' bladders in it.

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:11.720
 - Right, okay.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.120
 - And it effectively was the sodas.

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.040
 - But also, were his servants involved in making it?

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:19.200
 - No, they must have been to a certain extent.

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.720
 He will have had lab technicians.

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.120
 - What was the missing factor

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.560
 when it didn't taste of urine?

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.640
 Was it the servants or the pigs' bladder?

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:27.080
 - It was definitely the pigs' bladder.

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:27.920
 - Okay.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.120
 - We're unsure about the servants.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.360
 - Yeah.

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:31.440
 - Is this the secret?

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.000
 You know how every one of these companies

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.080
 has a secret ingredient that we haven't been told about?

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.000
 They've just been hiding piss from us this whole time.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.800
 - Yeah, but like 11 herbs and spices and piss.

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.380
 (all laughing)

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:43.440
 - Just before we go on on this,

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.480
 can I tell you about one thing about Nooth?

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:46.320
 - Okay.

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:47.720
 - John Mervyn Nooth.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:48.560
 - One name.

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:49.720
 - It was such a good name.

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:52.820
 He once had a coughing fit and coughed out a bullet.

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:55.160
 (all laughing)

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:55.980
 - I know.

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:56.820
 - Okay.

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:58.600
 - Did he kill the person sat up his head?

00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:59.800
 (all laughing)

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.400
 So he had this terrible coughing fit.

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:03.680
 He was like, "Oh, really coughing awfully."

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.240
 He'd been out in the evening.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.960
 And he thought he was gonna die.

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:10.740
 His coughing was so bad, this was at about 17.99.

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:12.720
 And he threw himself down on the bed,

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:14.360
 coughing with great violence.

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:15.200
 And then when he got up,

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.000
 he'd coughed out something incredibly hard.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:17.840
 - Yeah.

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.200
 - And it turned out just before he got ill,

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:21.680
 he'd been having a glass of wine

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:22.640
 and then he'd been called away.

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:24.240
 So he'd quickly drained the wine

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:27.080
 and it had lead shot in it.

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:27.920
 - Oh, okay.

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:28.880
 - So, okay, right.

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:29.720
 - Not a bullet.

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:30.560
 - Not an actual bullet.

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:31.400
 - But a bit.

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:32.720
 (all laughing)

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:33.560
 - A lead shot.

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:34.400
 - Still a bit of lead shot.

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:37.280
 - So if you were to buy, in the older days,

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:40.080
 if you were to buy like a partridge for dinner,

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:41.640
 they would often have bits of lead in it

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:42.480
 from where it had been shot.

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:43.320
 - Oh, I see.

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:44.480
 - 'Cause it's like scatter shot.

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:45.600
 - Oh, okay. - Bullet.

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:46.840
 - Okay, but still. - Shotgun pellets.

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:48.160
 - Okay. - Shotgun pellets.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:49.800
 - Shrapnel of a bullet that he still swallowed.

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:52.280
 Okay, so the animal was killed with a bullet.

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:53.120
 That was in there.

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.080
 - Yeah, shotgun. - I think that counts.

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:54.920
 Yeah, yeah. - Yeah, yeah.

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:56.040
 - He'd coughed it out. - It's a bullet.

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:57.840
 - Well, it's part of a bullet, right?

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:01.360
 - Do we know if coughing up a bullet makes you taste piss?

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:02.840
 (all laughing)

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:06.280
 - Did the part, whoever the bullet went into

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:09.200
 had that animal wet itself when it died.

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:11.040
 - Yeah, yeah. - Drenched the bullet in whee.

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:12.000
 He swallowed them.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.440
 - He doesn't notice 'cause of the whine.

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:14.280
 - He doesn't notice 'cause of the whine.

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:15.240
 - He doesn't notice.

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:16.400
 - And everyone's like,

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:17.520
 "Pal, have you ever noticed that

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:19.600
 "everything you taste off tastes a piss?

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.800
 "Maybe you've got a piss-soaked bullet."

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.360
 - Stuck in your throat. - Yeah.

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:25.280
 - Taste puts on it. - It's wide open.

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:27.160
 - Wow, that's food for thought.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:30.400
 - So New Thend went on to make these soda streams,

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:34.120
 which he called gasogines, or gasogines,

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:35.760
 and they were really famous.

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:38.520
 And basically, if you were anyone who was anyone

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:41.640
 in the, when was it, in the 19th century,

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:43.880
 then you would have a gasogine machine,

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:45.120
 which was like a soda stream.

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:46.560
 - Not much has changed really now,

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:47.400
 isn't it?

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:48.680
 It's still quite a power move to have a soda stream.

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:50.240
 - It really is. - It really is.

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.440
 Yeah, I feel like they've, no,

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:54.400
 I feel like they've recently been overtaken by,

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:56.440
 if you've got an air fryer, that's the thing.

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:58.120
 - Yeah, yeah. - It's an air fryer.

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:00.320
 But soda streams were a bit of a power move.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:01.960
 You look like you've got a soda stream.

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:03.000
 - A soda stream. - You could tell, by the way,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.040
 you were brewing up to that.

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:06.520
 - I've got one as well. - Oh my God.

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:08.120
 - Here's what's embarrassing. - This sounds as gold plated.

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:11.160
 - Mine's gold plated, and we haven't used it

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:12.760
 in, I think, two years now.

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:14.080
 It just sits there as a display.

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.280
 - Why do you have a gold plated soda stream?

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:17.960
 - My wife likes gold things.

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:18.800
 - Is she?

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.760
 It's your house like Donald Trump's house.

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:21.680
 - Oh my God.

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:23.400
 - No, actually, it's probably the only gold thing

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:25.440
 in our house. - Oh, is it the only thing?

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:26.560
 - The only thing. - Yeah.

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:28.320
 - Oh, that's not true. - What about the dining table?

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:30.440
 - Yeah, the toilet and the chairs.

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:31.400
 - Do you remember Trump's house?

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.040
 - That's real gold, the wallpaper,

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:35.240
 and the front of the house.

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.760
 - And my children.

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:38.720
 - Is your wife painted like that woman in gold?

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:42.240
 - I think what it was with soda streams

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:43.600
 is when I was a kid, they were really,

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:45.480
 if one of my friends had a soda stream,

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:47.280
 it was like they were the coolest kid in town.

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:50.240
 But now it's because you don't want to buy bottles

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:52.560
 of fizzy water 'cause it's bad for the environment

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.160
 or something, isn't it?

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:56.640
 - Well, and you can make super sparkling water as well.

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:58.760
 And you can get the syrups

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:01.040
 that you can make your own tonic water.

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:02.240
 - Coca-Cola. - Yeah, but it's not

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:03.180
 Coca-Cola, is it?

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:04.160
 No, it is, it is.

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:05.480
 - Is it real Coca-Cola? - Well, it's not real.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:06.820
 - Well, it's not real.

00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:07.660
 - No, no, no, it is.

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:08.500
 - What it is. - Fans are

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:09.880
 for all those Nazi parties in the house.

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:11.200
 (laughing)

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:13.800
 - It tastes like, this is a good thing,

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:15.000
 and I would, you know,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.320
 if soda stream ought to advertise on Fish,

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:18.280
 that'd be fine by me, just throwing it out there.

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:20.400
 But it tastes like the Coke you'd get on a ferry.

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:21.680
 You know that kind of Coke?

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:23.840
 - No. - Or sort of like a ferry.

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:25.280
 - Like Roller-Cola.

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:27.680
 - It's not completely, it's a bit like that.

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.020
 Yeah, what's Roller-Cola?

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:31.000
 - Like bad Coke, like knock-off Coke.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.720
 - It was like 5P when Coca-Cola was 20P,

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.040
 Roller-Cola was 5P.

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:36.560
 - I just want to reiterate, this stuff is great.

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:37.400
 I love it.

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:38.800
 I'm so happy with my soda stream.

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:40.120
 I have used mine in the last two years.

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:41.740
 - I actually don't think that soda stream

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:43.120
 are going to have on their advertising

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:45.000
 like the Coke you get on a ferry.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.400
 - Yeah, that's nearly as bad a slogan

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:49.320
 as buy Nazis for Nazis.

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:51.040
 (laughing)

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:52.360
 - But it's really good.

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:54.000
 It's really good I use it all the time.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:54.920
 - It tastes like piss.

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:55.760
 - Yeah.

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:57.280
 - Good, as it should do.

00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:58.120
 - But I am.

00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:59.360
 - Just like Mumbo used to make.

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:00.720
 (laughing)

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:01.680
 - I think that might be something to do

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:02.800
 with my servants though.

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:03.640
 I just have a hunch.

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:04.680
 (laughing)

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:05.520
 - Yeah.

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:08.080
 - Presley, just a quick word about Presley.

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:08.920
 - What a guy.

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:12.040
 - What a guy, so fluent in six languages.

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:15.600
 He wrote over 500 books in pamphlets.

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:16.440
 What an amazing scientist.

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:18.840
 - That sounds like someone who's written 490 pamphlets.

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:21.080
 (laughing)

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:24.320
 - Yeah, 499 pamphlets.

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:28.120
 One book listing all of the pamphlets that you can read.

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:30.960
 He's credited with inventing or discovering

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:33.680
 how oxygen is made up.

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:36.720
 He was a lunatic, very excitingly.

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:38.920
 So the Lunar Society, which was this thing

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:41.960
 with Erasmus Darwin and all these amazing scientists

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:42.800
 at the time.

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:44.400
 They used to meet when it was a full moon

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:45.960
 so they could see their way home

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:48.280
 using the light of the moon in the very dark night.

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:49.400
 It's really cool, eh?

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:51.000
 Yeah, what an extraordinary character.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.720
 - The thing about him being a lunatic,

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:54.760
 that meant he was kind of pro-science.

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:55.840
 - Yeah.

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:59.680
 - He was also not of the Protestant faith

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:02.400
 and he was also kind of sympathetic

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:03.720
 with the French Revolution.

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:05.800
 And this meant that he had lots of enemies

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:07.520
 and lots of people didn't like him.

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:09.840
 And there's a thing called the Presley riots.

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:12.560
 So he moved to Birmingham after he left Leeds

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:15.480
 and they had a dinner to sort of say

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:17.000
 how great the French Revolution was.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.040
 And a load of people in Birmingham decided

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:21.200
 to wreck their place where they had the dinner

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:23.920
 and then go to Presley's house and Wreck his house.

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:25.000
 - Was he in?

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.960
 - He was, he was in when they started to come

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:29.760
 with the pitchforks and the-

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.160
 - Oh, like proper Wreck his house.

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:33.440
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, they did.

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:34.280
 - Oh.

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:36.200
 - And his lamp, oh, they didn't just,

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:38.920
 not the lamp off the mantelpiece, they went full.

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:41.080
 - He and his wife managed to get to the hills

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:42.960
 so they could see what was happening.

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:44.720
 But they were away from the mob.

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:46.520
 But his son was still there.

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:49.120
 And his son was trying to kind of save everything.

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:51.080
 And in the end, he had to flee as well.

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:52.280
 And the interesting thing about it

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:54.640
 is because it was anti-establishment

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:56.800
 and it was the establishment who were attacking him,

00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:59.500
 we think that possibly some people involved

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:00.880
 in the Birmingham government

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:02.560
 might have been involved with this.

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:03.400
 - Right.

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:06.780
 - And Pitt, who was the prime minister then,

00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:09.800
 they asked for help against these rioters

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:11.680
 and they were very, very slow to react.

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:13.800
 The government were like, oh yeah, we'll help, we'll help.

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:15.400
 But it was like days and days and days

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:17.640
 before they sent anyone to Birmingham to help.

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:20.280
 So really they were kind of in on it as well, the government.

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:21.560
 - Yeah, just crazy.

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:24.200
 - Or at least kind of passive on it.

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:25.440
 - Yeah, complicit, yeah.

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:27.880
 - Samuel Johnson called him an evil man.

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:28.840
 Like he was really in it.

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:29.680
 - Yeah.

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:30.520
 - It was a bit harsh.

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:32.280
 - He really did not like carbonated drinks.

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:33.680
 (laughing)

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:34.520
 - Yeah.

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:35.400
 It's sort of weird to imagine now

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:37.000
 how controversial it was at the time.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:37.840
 - Yeah, it's mad, isn't it?

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:38.680
 - But he supported, yeah.

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:40.980
 - Just to be pro-science.

00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:43.160
 - He also supported the American Revolution.

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:46.680
 - And he was a bit equivocal on the monarchy

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:48.480
 and on the idea of virgin birth.

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:49.320
 - Yeah.

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:50.140
 - So it was all, you know.

00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:51.720
 - He was quite loved by the American government,

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:52.560
 wasn't he?

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:53.380
 - When he got there, yeah.

00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:54.220
 - He was very popular.

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:55.060
 - Hung out with George Washington.

00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:56.160
 - They love a carbonated drink, though.

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.400
 (laughing)

00:13:58.400 --> 00:13:59.520
 You've ever seen the Super Bowl?

00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:02.440
 You can't move for Pepsi, Grant, sponsorship.

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:04.520
 - Have you ever heard of this school

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:06.880
 around the area of leads?

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:08.800
 Oh, I think it's around the area of leads.

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:10.080
 Batley Grammar School?

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:11.080
 - I know Batley.

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:11.920
 - You know Batley?

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:14.200
 I would very much believe that they have a grammar school.

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:16.480
 - Yeah, well, this is where he went to school.

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:17.320
 - Oh, yeah.

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:19.360
 - So very, very old school, obviously,

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:21.400
 because he went to it, yeah.

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:23.520
 And I looked into it to see if they'd produced

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:25.840
 any other sort of interesting drinks

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:28.640
 through their students, and it turns out that they did.

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:29.480
 - No.

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:32.960
 - Yeah, Richard John Reid, the co-founder

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:35.920
 of Innocent Smoothies and Innocent Drinks

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:36.760
 went to the very same school.

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:37.720
 - He went to Batley?

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:39.960
 - Yeah, he went to Batley Grammar School.

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:40.880
 - Batley Grammar, that's great.

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:42.480
 - And more so than the smoothies,

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:44.720
 he is sort of the person who is credited

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:46.720
 with pioneering wackaging.

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.480
 Wackaging, yeah.

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:50.560
 - Like putting the little hats on top, is that what that is?

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:52.600
 - No, it's now when the drink sort of says

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:54.240
 on the side and says put in the fridge.

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:55.080
 - Hi, I'm a smoothie.

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:55.920
 - Yeah, put me in the fridge.

00:14:55.920 --> 00:15:00.320
 - Oh, it gives the personalities to the package.

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:02.040
 - It was them, wasn't it, who invented that?

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:04.920
 - Yeah, more specifically, this guy from Batley School

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:06.600
 was credited, yeah, Richard Reid.

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:09.800
 - I was so pro Batley School until you said that.

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:12.520
 I think they need to burn it down.

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:14.280
 - But also though, as soon as you said it,

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:16.960
 and you said he was the inventor of Innocence Mealy,

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:18.520
 I immediately just pictured him to be wearing

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:20.320
 one of these knitted hats,

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:22.240
 going around Batley Grammar School corridors

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:23.920
 in a little knitted woolly hat,

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:26.400
 going brrr, I'm cold, put me in the fridge.

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:31.000
 Oh, there's Richard again, there's bullying.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.040
 - Has anyone heard of the soft drink Golaka Pei?

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:34.880
 - Golaka Pei.

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:35.720
 - Golaka Pei.

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:36.800
 - Oh, one word.

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:38.320
 - No, it's two words, Golaka,

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:41.720
 G-O-L-O-K-A-N-M-P-A-Y.

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:42.720
 - Golaka Pei, no?

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:44.000
 - No, what is it from?

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.400
 - It's from India.

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:48.000
 - Oh no.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:48.840
 - Oh what?

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:49.680
 - Is it uriny?

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:50.520
 - It's very uriny.

00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:52.720
 - Oh no, whose wee is in it?

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:57.640
 - It's cow urine, 5% by volume, cow urine.

00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:00.960
 - Five percent, that's a bit piss heavy for a drink.

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:02.600
 - We should say we did a fact ages ago

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:05.760
 about the fact that cow urine is drunk more,

00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:07.760
 over there is kind of, it's more normalized

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:08.600
 as a drink, isn't it?

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:11.320
 - Certainly more normalized than it is here, I would say.

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:14.120
 - But you wouldn't drink it as just cow urine,

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:15.640
 it's an ingredient in something.

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:17.120
 - I'm afraid some people do.

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:17.960
 - Yeah, you just drink it.

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:18.800
 - Straight?

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:19.640
 - Yeah.

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:20.960
 - So it's,

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:22.800
 - No.

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:23.640
 - We haven't tried it.

00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:25.240
 - No, would you?

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:26.080
 - Yeah.

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:27.000
 - You would try it.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.680
 - For just to be able to say.

00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:30.600
 - Ethan, bring in the cow urine.

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:33.200
 (all laughing)

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:36.280
 - Ethan is Dan's gold-covered servant, by the way.

00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:38.120
 (all laughing)

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:40.760
 - He's coming in like Julie Walters with two suits.

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:42.400
 (all laughing)

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:45.000
 - I love that it's milkmates busy milking the cow one morning,

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.240
 Dan is fractionally behind the milk boy.

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:48.520
 - Calling on the penis, yeah.

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:50.960
 (all laughing)

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:52.200
 - So yeah, we have said before,

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:54.240
 there's the Cow Commission of India,

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:58.000
 and this is, they're linked to like Hindu nationalist groups,

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.240
 and they think that according to their traditional medicine,

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:04.840
 cow urine is supposed to be an antidote for all sorts of,

00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:06.920
 I mean, anything you can think of,

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:09.560
 inflammation, eczema, arthritis, leprosy.

00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:10.960
 - A bit of cow piss sorts it out.

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:13.520
 - A bit of cow piss is supposed to sort it out.

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:16.480
 Currently no concrete scientific evidence that it works,

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:18.800
 but you can buy a soft drink called Golaka Pei,

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:20.760
 which contains 5% urine,

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:23.320
 but at least it does contain other herbs.

00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:25.120
 - That's nice for them to put those in, isn't it?

00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:29.200
 - Yeah, such as Tulsi Brahmi and Shank Pushpi,

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:31.040
 and orange and lemon as well.

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:33.960
 - So herbs, orange, lemon, and cow whey.

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:35.840
 - Yeah, that's a drink.

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:36.680
 - I'm afraid so.

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:39.280
 - And a drink not exclusively used for getting better,

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:40.880
 like some people will just have that on the go.

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:41.840
 - Like Luca's own, I suppose.

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:43.160
 - Yeah, yes, yes.

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:44.800
 - 'Cause that is a good illness drink.

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:45.640
 - It's an illness drink,

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:48.000
 but some people are having it day to day life.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:48.960
 - Absolutely.

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:51.480
 - Do you think, sorry to bring the tone down

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:53.440
 on this quite high brow podcast,

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:58.440
 do you think they taste wildly different, can we, in pig whey?

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:01.360
 - No, but I reckon probably an expert would be able to.

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:02.560
 I reckon you'll be able to learn.

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:05.360
 - You reckon there's somebody that could have a sip of both.

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:06.200
 - Absolutely.

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:07.760
 - Be able to point out like how people can point out

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:09.480
 Coke and Pepsi.

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:12.960
 Someone's out there doing it with pig and cow whey.

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:15.040
 - Yeah, 'cause I could do Coke and Diet Coke, I reckon.

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:17.000
 - Oh yeah, oh, Diet Coke.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.320
 Well, Diet Coke tastes like this.

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:19.680
 (all laughing)

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:23.240
 - I can do tea and coffee, I don't even know what you're down to.

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:27.040
 - Oh, Andy, you really thought that was a big thing, did you?

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:29.760
 I don't want to brag, guys, but I know the difference.

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:31.720
 - Like on your first go.

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:35.000
 - Diet Coke and Diet Coke are more similar to each other

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.600
 than I think you're in a pig urine whey.

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:40.440
 - Please go.

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:41.280
 - Please go.

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:43.860
 (upbeat music)

00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:50.000
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is James.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.680
 - Okay, my fact this week is that Brazilian footballer,

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:55.640
 Formiga, is the only athlete to ever compete

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:58.400
 in a team sport in seven Olympics.

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:01.360
 But when she was born, it was illegal for women

00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:03.700
 to play football in Brazil.

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:05.800
 - This is such a good fact.

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:08.760
 This is such a good fact about such a good player.

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:10.440
 - Oh yeah, do you know about Formiga?

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:12.040
 - Yeah, so, and also, as you say,

00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:13.200
 it was illegal when she was born,

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:16.440
 and so women's football wasn't in the Olympics.

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:20.320
 So that means that she has played in every Olympics

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:22.040
 where women's football has existed.

00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:22.880
 - Right.

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:26.720
 - So the next Olympics will be the first one

00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:29.760
 in women's football history not to feature Formiga.

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:31.200
 - Do you like her for a hundred meters run

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:33.640
 that have been in every race since 1896?

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:34.480
 - Yeah.

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:35.320
 - Yeah.

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:36.160
 - It's like that, isn't it?

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:37.000
 - It's unreal.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:37.840
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:40.560
 - So, '96 was her first one.

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:45.560
 - Yes, so she was born in '78, I think, yeah.

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:50.400
 And Brazil had a law from 1941 until 1979,

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:54.600
 and they didn't really make it proper until 1981,

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:56.840
 that girls and women were not allowed to play football,

00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:58.200
 but wasn't just professional,

00:19:58.200 --> 00:19:59.720
 they weren't allowed to play in schools

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:01.440
 or even play for fun.

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:04.560
 So my daughter, on Friday,

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:07.000
 will go to her first football lesson.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.600
 She's 18, 19 months old,

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:12.160
 and if she was Formiga, it would have been illegal,

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:14.920
 she could have been arrested for going and playing football.

00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:16.920
 - It's absolutely insane,

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:19.760
 'cause there's a very famous player called Marta, right?

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:21.960
 And she wasn't allowed to play football,

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:23.960
 actively discouraged, she really wanted to.

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:25.320
 So she used to just on the street,

00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:28.640
 just have a balled up bits of shopping bags,

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:31.320
 basically to use as a ball, playing on her own.

00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:34.320
 Then she would sort of sneak in to play with other teams,

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:36.120
 which were boys entirely,

00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:37.600
 and it was a horrible experience for her.

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:41.160
 If she ever scored a goal, it was seen as a terrible thing.

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:42.480
 Like, you've embarrassed that boy.

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:43.520
 - It's an attack on the men's score.

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:44.720
 - It's an attack on the men's score.

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:47.400
 And so, never ever was she given this moment

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:49.400
 of sort of, you know, you've done good.

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:51.400
 - It was an incredible press conference, Marta gave,

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:53.680
 'cause she retired after the World Cup just gone,

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:55.320
 and it was really quite emotional watching

00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:57.120
 because she's touching on, I mean,

00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:59.800
 women's football across the globe, as we all know,

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:02.520
 has been hugely under-platformed,

00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:07.320
 under-represented, hugely disrespected as a sport,

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:09.160
 bad enough in this country with the FA banning it

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:12.600
 for 15 years, but in Brazil, as you say,

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:16.080
 with that very sort of paternalistic, moralism,

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:20.040
 sort of society existing, it was an actual attack on,

00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:23.320
 and it's all down to that it wasn't appropriate

00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:26.640
 for a woman with her build to be playing football.

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:30.800
 But yeah, Famigo was 19 at her first one,

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:33.520
 43 at the last of the World Cup.

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:35.480
 43 represent in your country.

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:37.360
 - And she only ever missed one World Cup,

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:38.880
 which was the 1991.

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:40.320
 She's done seven of those as well.

00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:41.440
 - Unbelievable.

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:44.000
 - The thing is as well that Marta was

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.160
 Brazil's leading scorer in history.

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:48.320
 She scored 115 goals,

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:52.800
 Neymar's the second with 79, Pelé 77.

00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:57.160
 And Famigo had the highest number of appearances,

00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:01.840
 which was 234, which is insane.

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:02.680
 - It's unreal.

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:04.400
 - It's more than 100 games, more than Cafu,

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:06.080
 who's got the highest in the men's game.

00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:09.280
 - Yeah, and Marta, just with the stats,

00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:11.520
 she's the current record holder for the most goals

00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:14.480
 ever scored in a World Cup, in one World Cup,

00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:16.880
 which is 17 goals, and that's for both men

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:17.720
 and women's football.

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:19.520
 - That's a lot. - For one World Cup,

00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:20.360
 that's a lot.

00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:21.200
 - It's mad, isn't it?

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:22.040
 - Do you?

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:27.040
 - You find it like Neymar recently surpassed Pelé's record,

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:32.100
 and like the huge notice that that gets,

00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:34.080
 that it's always like screaming from the rooftops,

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:35.520
 who's the goat in football?

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:37.560
 We always end up talking about men.

00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:40.380
 The goats are often in the women's game,

00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:41.520
 because they've had to be.

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:43.840
 It's truly incredible.

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:44.680
 - I watched it.

00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:45.520
 - Sorry, sorry.

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:46.360
 - What?

00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:47.360
 - Please.

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:48.900
 - Go on, you watch some football.

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:51.180
 (all laughing)

00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:52.740
 - Just as I watched last night,

00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:54.480
 just as a nice bit of timing,

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:56.340
 the series Welcome to Wrexham

00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:58.760
 is currently airing its second series,

00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:01.600
 and one of the episodes that comes up mid-series,

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:02.440
 which I watched last night,

00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:04.740
 it's the latest episode as of recording,

00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:06.740
 it was all about the Wrexham women's team.

00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:07.580
 - Yeah, so good at it.

00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:09.260
 - No, far better than any,

00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:10.940
 they make it to the,

00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:12.500
 as far as we are in the series right now,

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:14.120
 they've just made it to the top of their league,

00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:17.620
 but they take on the closest ranking team,

00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:20.180
 and they beat them 11 to one, I think it was.

00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:22.340
 And yeah, it's just astonishing.

00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:24.900
 And it's so good, I guess that it's now changing,

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:25.740
 isn't it?

00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:27.180
 - It's ever growing, but it's thanks to players,

00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:29.540
 like for me, you go for like Marta,

00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:31.700
 like in our own coaching, like Kelly Smith,

00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:33.820
 or, well, even if you go right far back

00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:35.460
 to sort of dick curl ladies,

00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:37.300
 who were all sort of...

00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:38.580
 - Early 20th century team,

00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:39.660
 the dick curl ladies, yeah.

00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:41.300
 - Basically the ones pre-war,

00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:43.540
 that were getting all of the big crowds,

00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:44.860
 and then the war happened,

00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:45.700
 and everyone was like,

00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:47.140
 "No, we need to make the men feel good."

00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:47.980
 - Yeah.

00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:51.500
 - So it was banned in the UK women playing football.

00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:53.380
 Basically, they weren't allowed to play

00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:56.740
 on FA affiliated grounds, which was all the grounds.

00:23:56.740 --> 00:23:59.460
 And that ban was from 1921 until the '70s,

00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:01.140
 so like you say, about 50 years.

00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:04.880
 But there was also bans in France, in Norway, in Germany,

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:07.500
 and usually the case was that this,

00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:09.060
 they thought that sport was unsuitable

00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:10.680
 for the female body, like you say,

00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:12.540
 but in West Germany's case,

00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:15.100
 they specifically said that it was a women's soul

00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:15.940
 that would be in Germany.

00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:18.060
 - Oh, and I think that's quite nice

00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:19.780
 as a sort of novel way of like,

00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:21.660
 oh, we've had loads of complaints about the body,

00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:23.740
 and they're like, "Oh, damaging women all this time."

00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:24.580
 - What are we gonna say there?

00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:25.420
 What are we gonna say?

00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:27.020
 - They might have meant the soul of their feet,

00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:29.260
 but it's not how it's spelled.

00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:30.900
 But you don't get footballers who are like,

00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:32.420
 "Oh, they're not playing this week

00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:34.500
 because they injured their soul."

00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:36.300
 - And I think that would be nice.

00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:37.140
 I think, and also,

00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:38.740
 I think spiritual stuff should be taken,

00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:41.020
 like the referee should be able to say,

00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:41.860
 immoral.

00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:44.020
 - Immoral play.

00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:45.540
 - Yeah, I didn't see the play,

00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:47.900
 but your aura has turned a nasty shade of red,

00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:48.740
 and I think--

00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:49.580
 - I'm just a ref going, I'm going,

00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:50.420
 "I'm getting bad vibes."

00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:51.260
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:52.100
 - Red card.

00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:54.260
 - That'd be really fun.

00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:56.020
 - Of all the countries as well,

00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:59.380
 to say bad for the soul of a woman,

00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:00.580
 you wouldn't expect Germany.

00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:01.420
 That's not very,

00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:03.220
 it's not particularly Germanic to say, is it?

00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:04.580
 - Yeah, it's not very quantifiable.

00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:05.420
 - Of the soul.

00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:06.420
 You'd expect that from one

00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:09.660
 of the more romantic language countries.

00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:11.300
 - Nietzsche wouldn't agree.

00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:12.140
 - Well.

00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:12.980
 - Well.

00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:13.820
 (laughing)

00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:15.500
 - And he, honestly.

00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:18.820
 - Here's the thing.

00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:20.580
 So, there was a recent study,

00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:21.540
 and I quite like this,

00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:23.180
 it's assessed that women's football

00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:24.780
 is better to watch than men's.

00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:28.380
 So it's a Swedish sports company who conducted this,

00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:29.860
 they're called Speedeo,

00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:32.420
 and they compare the women's Euros in the men's World Cup,

00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:34.740
 and they tried to do it as mathematically as possible.

00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:38.020
 So what they found is that women are less risk averse

00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:40.580
 than men in the style of play.

00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:42.060
 And again, they're just comparing women's Euros

00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:42.900
 and men's World Cup.

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:45.460
 But those are two, obviously, big international tournaments.

00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:46.540
 - Okay, so for instance,

00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:49.020
 the men's teams might deliberately hold back

00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:50.660
 and try and not concede goals,

00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:52.060
 whereas the women's team aren't bothered.

00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:52.900
 - That's it.

00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:55.060
 So when the women's Euros passes,

00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:57.580
 moved teams forward 3.7 meters,

00:25:57.580 --> 00:26:00.540
 and in the men's World Cup, it was 2.5 meters.

00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:01.380
 - Really?

00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:02.220
 - That doesn't sound like a lot,

00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:04.900
 but yeah, that's a big difference.

00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:09.140
 - I do love you to be the commentator of the World Cup.

00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:12.940
 - And I believe that was a 2.6 meter pass.

00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:13.780
 - Oh, yes.

00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:16.340
 - You're running along the sidelines with that wheel,

00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:18.580
 that pizza cutter wheel.

00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:19.740
 - Massive great spreadsheet.

00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:21.460
 I'm trying to keep track of everyone.

00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:23.100
 So is that a massive difference?

00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:26.340
 - Well, I mean, down 2.5, 3.7.

00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:27.180
 Sorry, I forgot.

00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:28.420
 I'm talking to the man who can tell the difference

00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:30.220
 between Coke and Diet Coke, of course,

00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:32.380
 you would know the meters' differential.

00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:35.740
 - That's 50% more per pass, you know, almost 50% more.

00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:38.460
 Yeah, it's not like 10 centimeters shy of being 50% more,

00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:42.100
 but still, but one stats expert said, I just love this.

00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:44.660
 It's almost like the men are playing a game of chess

00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:46.020
 and the women are playing something

00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:47.980
 a bit more interesting than chess.

00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:49.700
 (laughing)

00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:51.420
 Can I say piss off because actually,

00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:52.860
 some of us like watching chess.

00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:55.780
 - Like 3D chess like they have in Star Wars.

00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:56.700
 - Star Wars.

00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:57.540
 - Wars.

00:26:57.540 --> 00:26:58.380
 - Shit.

00:26:58.380 --> 00:26:59.700
 - No, oh yeah.

00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:00.740
 - Probably both.

00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:03.780
 - Well, it's, now we're on my home turf, I'm afraid.

00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:04.620
 - You're all wrong.

00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:05.940
 It's Harry Potter 1, remember?

00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:08.580
 - We're on the big statues, moving forward.

00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:11.100
 - We will get emails just to say in Star Wars,

00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:13.220
 they have the hologram chest, don't they?

00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:14.060
 With the monsters.

00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:15.820
 And I think in Star Trek, I don't know what they have.

00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:18.060
 - You've lost me here, lads, I'll be honest with you.

00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:18.900
 You've lost me here.

00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:19.740
 - Go back to football.

00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:20.580
 - I think so.

00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:23.620
 It is definitely like quite a different game in terms,

00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:25.620
 like it feels at the ground,

00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:27.500
 it's a very different experience watching the game.

00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:30.300
 It's a far more inclusive, positive atmosphere,

00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:33.380
 but actually on the pitch, that's interesting.

00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:34.460
 - So you play, don't you?

00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:35.300
 - Yeah.

00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:37.340
 - How far do you normally pass?

00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:40.260
 - Oh, I reckon I'm working at the moment with a good 2.7,

00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:41.940
 I would say, yeah, 2.7.

00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:45.020
 Now, I think we've heard a lot in the World Cup,

00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:47.700
 a lot of people observing that there was a bit less diving

00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:48.860
 and a bit less sort of,

00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:51.300
 gonna get emails here from blokes, as we always do,

00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:53.540
 but going, "Oh, really, we don't dive."

00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:56.020
 Actually, no, on this podcast, you won't,

00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:57.420
 you probably get quite nice people.

00:27:57.420 --> 00:27:58.420
 - No, no, it's the first time I've,

00:27:58.420 --> 00:27:59.780
 I reckon as a learning about football.

00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:02.060
 - I think metoxic masculinity is probably quite low

00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:03.540
 on the listenership on here.

00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:05.180
 - Oh, excuse me, I'm currently doing the inbox,

00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:07.220
 can I tell you, the number of laddie emails.

00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:08.060
 - It's full of not all men.

00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:08.900
 - Yeah, really?

00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:10.220
 (laughing)

00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:12.180
 - One thing I found about watching women's games

00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:13.900
 as opposed to men's games is that everyone

00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:15.860
 who's at the ground is watching the game.

00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:16.700
 - Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:18.580
 - So like, if you go and watch a men's football match,

00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:21.220
 quite often you're watching the opposing fans.

00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:22.060
 - Yeah.

00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:23.380
 - Or, you know, they, well, you're there to--

00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:24.220
 - They're watching you?

00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:26.060
 - Yeah, you're kind of singing and chanting.

00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:27.260
 - Rehearsing the chant.

00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:28.100
 - Yeah.

00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:28.940
 - Rehearsing.

00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:31.220
 - Let's not remember, it's not singing and chanting,

00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:33.420
 it's doing a lot of hand gestures at each other.

00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:34.620
 - Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:36.140
 - Regardless of what's happening on the pitch.

00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:37.380
 - Unsupported ones.

00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:40.020
 - Yeah, yeah, it's not, it's not thumbs up.

00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:41.260
 It's not thumbs up, I think.

00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:42.300
 (laughing)

00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:44.940
 It's not a heart shake from across the stands.

00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:45.780
 - Yeah, 'cause you could, I mean,

00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:48.260
 your whole end of the stands could do a great big heart.

00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:50.180
 - If you ever go and watch, if you ever go and watch Leeds,

00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:51.020
 that's what they do.

00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:53.220
 - I'd love it, Addy's just there shouting across the game,

00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:54.220
 "I love your shirt."

00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:55.060
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:57.460
 - I'm like, "Shirt, where's that from?"

00:28:57.460 --> 00:28:59.060
 - But yeah, and I went to watch,

00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:00.540
 I think it was a World Cup in France,

00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:02.420
 but everyone there was watching the game.

00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:03.260
 - Right.

00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:05.100
 - And really no one is doing anything else.

00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:06.740
 - Yeah, but it is interesting to hear the actual

00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:10.100
 clinical differences of the on-pitch play.

00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:12.980
 - Maybe if the men's players kick the ball

00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:15.980
 a bit less far or further, actually,

00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:19.060
 then it might improve the mood in the stands.

00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:20.300
 - Yeah, maybe they would need to make

00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:21.380
 all those hand gestures.

00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:22.740
 (laughing)

00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:23.580
 - Maybe, cool.

00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:25.500
 - Formiga is Portuguese for aunt.

00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:26.340
 - Oh, yeah?

00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:27.180
 - Yeah.

00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:28.020
 - 'Cause she's got six legs.

00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:28.860
 (laughing)

00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:29.700
 - She's got six legs.

00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:31.500
 - And she can carry 19 times her own body weight,

00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:32.340
 can't she?

00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:34.860
 - And actually, I just realized that an old word for aunt

00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:36.980
 was pismaya because they smell of urine.

00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:37.820
 - Oh, yeah.

00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:38.660
 - Oh, look at this.

00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:39.500
 - There we go.

00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:41.020
 - So she's called aunt.

00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:42.340
 That was a nickname that was given to her

00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:43.660
 when she was at school.

00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:45.100
 And it was when she was playing football,

00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:46.900
 they said that she used to play tenaciously

00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:47.740
 and unselfishly.

00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:50.060
 She was much like how an aunt would operate

00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:51.540
 within its own colony.

00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:54.020
 Yeah, so she was very much busy all the time

00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:55.500
 and always helping out.

00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:56.340
 She hated it.

00:29:56.340 --> 00:29:58.180
 Hated it as a kid.

00:29:58.180 --> 00:29:59.460
 She learned to just accept it,

00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:01.500
 but she said, "In the beginning, I didn't like it very much."

00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:02.500
 You know, I thought it was weird.

00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:03.940
 - It's quite as if she's small, doesn't it, I guess?

00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:05.900
 - Yeah, the actual reasoning for it is nice,

00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:07.100
 but to be called aunt.

00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:09.380
 - Yeah, well, she said, "I don't have an antennae."

00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:10.220
 Like, why would I?

00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:11.060
 - That's true.

00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:13.820
 - She's getting a bit hung up on where are my mandibles?

00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:14.660
 - Yeah.

00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:15.940
 (laughing)

00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:19.300
 - Can I see if, Macy, I wonder if you've seen this movie.

00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:20.140
 - Okay.

00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:22.740
 - It's called, it's called--

00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:23.580
 - Titanic.

00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:26.340
 (laughing)

00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:27.180
 - Fend it right back.

00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:28.020
 - Yeah.

00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:32.740
 - It's called, "Escape to Victory."

00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:34.060
 - No, I've not seen this film.

00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:34.900
 - Has no one seen this film?

00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:35.740
 - What class?

00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:36.580
 - It's very famous.

00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:37.420
 - Is it?

00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:38.620
 - I've never heard of this film before.

00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:40.900
 It's stars, Sylvester Stallone.

00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:41.740
 - I'm Pele.

00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:44.300
 - Michael Cain, Pele and Bobby Moore.

00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:46.140
 - What?

00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:47.940
 - I mean, that is the real expendable.

00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:49.900
 - So is it a football, or it sounds like a prison?

00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:50.740
 - It is.

00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:52.540
 - It is, it's a prison movie whereby--

00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:53.700
 - There's "Gate Through Football."

00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:56.660
 - They set up a match during the match

00:30:56.660 --> 00:30:58.700
 as part of the match prep.

00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:00.620
 But I just love there's a Stallone, Michael Cain,

00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:01.620
 Bobby Moore, and--

00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:02.900
 - That's mad.

00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:03.940
 - Yeah, I know.

00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:06.260
 - Oh my God, I didn't see this film.

00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:07.420
 - I know, I really need to see it.

00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:09.100
 - Is it any good?

00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:10.220
 - It's a classic.

00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:13.020
 - Yeah, I can read between those lights.

00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:13.860
 - Yeah.

00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:14.700
 (laughing)

00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:16.420
 - It's one of the things they used to show it on like,

00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:17.740
 Sunday evening.

00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:20.100
 - Can I just say, if anybody ever went,

00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:22.180
 "Macy Adam, I haven't seen a comedy, what's it like?"

00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:24.260
 And somebody went, "It's classic."

00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:25.540
 (laughing)

00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:27.380
 - I think that would be absolutely harrowing.

00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:28.780
 (laughing)

00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:31.580
 - He'd rather be made by Nazis for this one.

00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:33.820
 (laughing)

00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:35.260
 - One for the tour poster.

00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:37.500
 - One last thing on Pelle,

00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:39.700
 just while we're on him very quickly.

00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:43.060
 Pelle's last ever match, 1977, he played,

00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:44.300
 and it was an exhibition match,

00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:47.540
 and it was the New York Cosmos against Santos,

00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:50.820
 and two teams that he used to play for.

00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:53.340
 So, in order to make sure that he wasn't siding

00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:54.940
 with any particular team,

00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:56.660
 in the first half, he played with one team,

00:31:56.660 --> 00:31:58.140
 and in the second half, he played with the other team.

00:31:58.140 --> 00:31:58.980
 - Lovely.

00:31:58.980 --> 00:31:59.820
 - It's final match ever.

00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:01.100
 - Absolutely love that.

00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:03.300
 Only Pelle could get away with doing that, though.

00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:04.140
 - Yeah.

00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:04.980
 - I think so.

00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:05.820
 - So, he didn't change ends.

00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:06.660
 - Oh, yes.

00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:08.540
 - Which must give you a slight advantage, right?

00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:09.380
 Possibly.

00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:11.900
 - Also, probably being Pelle gives you a slight advantage.

00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:13.460
 - Yeah, that's why he was so good.

00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:14.700
 (laughing)

00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:15.620
 - When I was at school,

00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:17.580
 we used to obviously play football for the schools,

00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:19.780
 and a lot of the schools would have pictures

00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:21.300
 that were on massive slants.

00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:22.140
 - Oh, my God.

00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:23.340
 - And so, like, you'd be in the first half,

00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:24.540
 you'd be winning five, nearly.

00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:26.860
 You'd end up losing, like, 21-five.

00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:28.300
 - I played a league in Brighton,

00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:29.980
 and we played on one the other day.

00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:31.860
 If you've ever been to Whitehawk's ground,

00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:33.620
 it's a fantastic club, it's Whitehawk,

00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:37.420
 but their ground is on a slope, sort of, left to right,

00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:40.580
 and up to that, like, you could ski down it.

00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:41.420
 You could ski down it.

00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:44.460
 - There was one that I played at school in Bolton.

00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:46.260
 This was, I think it was in primary school,

00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:48.860
 and it was, like, slanted, like you say,

00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:50.220
 from one wing to the other.

00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:51.060
 - Yeah.

00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:51.900
 - You can imagine that.

00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:52.780
 And we were all primary school kids,

00:32:52.780 --> 00:32:54.420
 so we didn't really know how to play football,

00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:56.820
 and so the ball would just always end up rolling

00:32:56.820 --> 00:32:59.020
 to the bottom at all 22 kids.

00:32:59.020 --> 00:33:00.300
 (laughing)

00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:01.340
 - It's part of the pitch.

00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:03.700
 - A lot of corner balls from one specific corner.

00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:04.740
 (laughing)

00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:07.320
 (upbeat music)

00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:12.460
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three.

00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:14.060
 That is Andy.

00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:17.020
 - My fact is that American schools have a sport

00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:19.500
 of competitive meat judging.

00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:20.620
 - No.

00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:21.460
 No.

00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:22.300
 - Wait.

00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:23.380
 (laughing)

00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:24.220
 - Meat judging.

00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:25.060
 - Meat judging.

00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:26.220
 It's less dodgy than it sounds.

00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:27.060
 - Absolutely believe.

00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:29.820
 - It's made, I should say,

00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:32.700
 this was sent in by an audience member called Kevin Fegan.

00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:33.880
 So thank you, Kevin.

00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:35.020
 - Kevin Fegan.

00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:36.460
 (laughing)

00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:37.300
 - Fegan.

00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:38.120
 - Yeah.

00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:38.960
 - Kevin Fegan.

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:39.940
 - Yeah, like Kevin Keegan, but with an F.

00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:40.780
 - Yeah.

00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:41.600
 - Oh, all right.

00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:42.440
 But he's not a vegan.

00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:43.260
 - Yeah.

00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:44.100
 - He didn't say it as evil.

00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:45.220
 - He's a vegetarian.

00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:46.260
 (laughing)

00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:47.540
 - God, come on.

00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:48.580
 - Kevin, if you're American--

00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:50.380
 - If you think I'm better than that, mate,

00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:51.220
 you've not had any episodes.

00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:52.060
 - I loved it.

00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:52.900
 I loved it.

00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:54.420
 - What's Kevin saying?

00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:57.540
 - Kevin's saying, well, that's what it is.

00:33:57.540 --> 00:33:58.380
 That's the fact.

00:33:58.380 --> 00:33:59.220
 - That there's meat judging.

00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:00.040
 - It's competitive meat judging.

00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:02.740
 And I think this might be the most American sport possible.

00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:03.980
 - How can you judge meat?

00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:05.340
 What's the criteria?

00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:07.580
 - Oh, well, is this a pig or is it a cow?

00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:08.420
 (laughing)

00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:10.660
 - Step one, that's the absolute baseline.

00:34:10.660 --> 00:34:11.500
 No, no, no.

00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:13.580
 This is, okay, it's a college sport.

00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:15.340
 It's an intercollegiate sport, right?

00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:17.860
 So it's sort of students who are playing it.

00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:21.180
 And they, like all over the country,

00:34:21.180 --> 00:34:23.500
 teams of students practice all year,

00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:25.020
 and then they get to the competition.

00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:26.220
 And what you have to do is,

00:34:26.220 --> 00:34:29.220
 you're presented with a range of meat carcasses,

00:34:29.220 --> 00:34:31.660
 and you have to judge the yield,

00:34:31.660 --> 00:34:33.220
 how much meat you'll get out of it,

00:34:33.220 --> 00:34:35.060
 how much fat there is in it,

00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:38.260
 the consumer experience, the age of the carcass,

00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:40.100
 and you have to do all this by sight only.

00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:40.940
 - Sight only.

00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:42.860
 - Oh, so they don't just put a slab of meat in front of you

00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:44.500
 and you go, pork?

00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:45.780
 - No, no, no, no.

00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:47.780
 - Not just guess if it's beef or pork or lamb.

00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:50.140
 I'll just say, I reckon I'd be all right at this.

00:34:50.140 --> 00:34:52.140
 - Andy, do you think as someone who can tell the difference

00:34:52.140 --> 00:34:54.460
 between diet cooking and no cooking,

00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:55.740
 that you won't be good at the spot?

00:34:55.740 --> 00:34:56.580
 - I think I might.

00:34:56.580 --> 00:34:57.780
 - Yeah, I think.

00:34:57.780 --> 00:34:58.620
 - It sounds amazing.

00:34:58.620 --> 00:35:00.180
 - It's like meat chess, basically.

00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:04.460
 It's really like, you get 10 minutes to inspect each carcass.

00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:05.700
 You know, they're hanging up in front of you.

00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:07.140
 You're not really touching them much.

00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:09.460
 - You're in like a big cold fridge.

00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:10.780
 - Like a couple of butchers.

00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:15.780
 You're in that, and then you're asked to guess yield.

00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:17.820
 - Yeah, I mean, all sorts.

00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:19.740
 - How many portions you get?

00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:23.060
 - My favorite one is, and this is purely by sight,

00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:27.540
 you have to go and evaluate whether a table of 10 cuts

00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:29.540
 that are laid down fit a checklist

00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:32.460
 of the United States Department of Agricultural Standards.

00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:34.460
 - Who's revising this?

00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:36.300
 - Oh, people put so much work in it.

00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:38.300
 They train sometimes for 12 hours a day

00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:39.140
 leading up to the competition.

00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:40.780
 - Whilst they're in college.

00:35:40.780 --> 00:35:42.860
 Have you seen how expensive college is in America?

00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:45.580
 How fuming would these parents be if they knew?

00:35:45.580 --> 00:35:46.780
 Are you revising?

00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:48.460
 Well, I've been looking at my chickens.

00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:49.580
 (laughing)

00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:51.460
 They must get a scholarship, I guess, right?

00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:52.300
 You know, like if you're--

00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:53.460
 - You can't get a meat scholarship.

00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:56.100
 Sure, like, surely not.

00:35:56.100 --> 00:35:58.980
 - You only play also, they're kind of competitors.

00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:01.340
 They're kind of like the Mayflies of the sporting world.

00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:03.100
 They get, you get one season.

00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:03.940
 That's it.

00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:04.820
 You can't play twice.

00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:06.940
 You can't play in two consecutive years.

00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:08.020
 Not like Farmiga, who can play.

00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:09.660
 - You can't be the Farmiga without each other.

00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:12.340
 (laughing)

00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:14.220
 - Which is a nightmare for the coaches

00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:17.380
 that pick their star meat examiners.

00:36:17.380 --> 00:36:19.340
 - Trying them up for one season and then they're out.

00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:21.220
 - Then you're back, yeah, you're just back to the start.

00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:23.060
 Finding fresh blood, you have to.

00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:25.260
 - Why would you bother, genuinely,

00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:26.500
 why would you bother pursuing this

00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:28.980
 if you can't become one of the great meat judges

00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:30.340
 who can't do it year in, year out?

00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:33.060
 - There are talent scouts who come to the competitions.

00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:33.900
 - You're lying.

00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:34.740
 - No, I'm not.

00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:35.820
 I swear, I swear.

00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:38.260
 They, I mean, a lot of the students

00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:40.780
 are already studying agriculture, that kind of thing.

00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:43.940
 So a lot of the competitors will end up going into meat

00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:46.140
 professionally, you know, the U.S.

00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:49.100
 - Oh, so they might be scouted to go into these top jobs

00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:50.780
 because of how well they did at the meat judges.

00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:53.100
 - If you're the head of a meat company

00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:55.180
 and you really want the best meat judges

00:36:55.180 --> 00:36:57.780
 to be part of your company, you'll pay lots of money.

00:36:57.780 --> 00:37:00.780
 - So you'll go to some intercollegiate competition

00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:04.100
 and be like, wow, Steven's very good at clocking.

00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:05.500
 - Yeah, wow.

00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:09.700
 - And 80% of them go into food and livestock industry jobs

00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:11.020
 after college.

00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:12.860
 - I mean, 20% don't know.

00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:13.700
 (laughing)

00:37:13.700 --> 00:37:14.540
 - There might be some savants who have studied it.

00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:16.780
 - 20% just doing it for food.

00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:17.860
 They're going into equipment.

00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:19.420
 - They're studying poetry.

00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:21.100
 The meat is pure passion for them.

00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:22.460
 And then, yeah, exactly.

00:37:22.460 --> 00:37:23.780
 - It's just a side hobby.

00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:24.620
 - I just love it.

00:37:24.620 --> 00:37:25.460
 I love it so much.

00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:27.700
 - But you do, you do get like the formiga of this,

00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:29.980
 even though the span is just one season.

00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:33.740
 So there is, there is one person called Maddie Ainsley.

00:37:33.740 --> 00:37:37.460
 And Maddie Ainsley did seven competitions like for me.

00:37:37.460 --> 00:37:38.380
 - 'Cause around the country.

00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:39.220
 - You go around the country.

00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:40.060
 - You go around the country.

00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:40.900
 - There are seven different competitions.

00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:41.740
 - Within the year.

00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:43.140
 So this is taking up a lot of your year.

00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:44.900
 This is not like one meat competition.

00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:46.780
 And she won five of the sevens.

00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:47.620
 - That's great.

00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:48.460
 - She's the all star.

00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:49.300
 - It's going to go all bad day.

00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:50.140
 - Yeah.

00:37:50.140 --> 00:37:51.180
 - Wow, that's great.

00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:54.220
 There was one guy called Rody Hawkins,

00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:56.820
 who was a former meat judge from Tennessee.

00:37:56.820 --> 00:37:57.660
 And this is the only--

00:37:57.660 --> 00:37:59.100
 - That can't be a sentence.

00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:00.060
 (laughing)

00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:03.380
 Rody Hawkins, meat judge from Tennessee.

00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:05.980
 This is like if Chuck GPT wrote a novel.

00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:08.620
 (laughing)

00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:11.060
 - He was a former meat judge from Tennessee.

00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:13.380
 - Right, an American novel.

00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:16.060
 Rody Hawkins from Tennessee.

00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:18.220
 - He's the only famous one I could find

00:38:18.220 --> 00:38:21.060
 who went from meat judging to greater things.

00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:24.780
 He co-invented Lunchables, which is a famous--

00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:25.620
 - Sorry.

00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:26.460
 - They're good.

00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:27.820
 - No, no, no, come on.

00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:29.940
 He's judging the quality of meat.

00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:31.980
 And he came out with Lunchables.

00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:33.660
 (laughing)

00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:34.900
 - It's like a little plastic toast.

00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:36.620
 - Processed.

00:38:36.620 --> 00:38:38.900
 - With some squares of processed ham

00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:40.620
 and some squares of processed cheese

00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:41.900
 and some crackers.

00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:42.740
 - Right.

00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:44.180
 - Yeah, must've been up all night thinking about it.

00:38:44.180 --> 00:38:46.180
 (laughing)

00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:49.340
 - I read a Sports Illustrated article on meat judging.

00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:50.180
 - That was great.

00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:51.180
 - It's an amazing article.

00:38:51.180 --> 00:38:54.180
 And there's a bit that explains exactly what it takes

00:38:54.180 --> 00:38:56.060
 to enter these competitions and be a meat.

00:38:56.060 --> 00:38:59.580
 So to be a meat judge, quick decision making,

00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:02.180
 critical reasoning, self assurance,

00:39:02.180 --> 00:39:04.780
 and above all the ability to quiet one's mind

00:39:04.780 --> 00:39:07.220
 for up to six hours standing in frigid temperatures

00:39:07.220 --> 00:39:08.380
 in total silence.

00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:09.900
 And according to a judge from 2015--

00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:12.540
 - Feels like the fourth point is quite a big step up.

00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:14.180
 I was like self assurance, yeah.

00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:15.660
 And then you read the fourth one and I was like,

00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:17.100
 ah, down, stop me.

00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:18.940
 - Fifth ability to judge meat.

00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:19.780
 (laughing)

00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:20.620
 - Exactly.

00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:23.060
 But what the quote from the judge from 2015 said,

00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:24.620
 and this is to do with the total silence,

00:39:24.620 --> 00:39:26.820
 you have to fight your own demons

00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:28.340
 in the meat judging cooler.

00:39:28.340 --> 00:39:30.180
 - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:32.540
 - I don't want to fight demons in a meat judging cooler.

00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:34.580
 - Who are the demons in the meat judging cooler?

00:39:34.580 --> 00:39:35.420
 - All yours.

00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:36.260
 It's just the internal voices.

00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:38.060
 - The internal voices in the six hours

00:39:38.060 --> 00:39:40.340
 of silence as you stare and trying to work out

00:39:40.340 --> 00:39:41.740
 if it's agriculturally sound.

00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:42.660
 - There are moments where,

00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:44.540
 so this might have been in the same piece.

00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:46.940
 There was a student from Texas Tech.

00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:48.220
 She was called Taylor Schertz.

00:39:48.220 --> 00:39:50.700
 She was a second year student.

00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:51.540
 What's that?

00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:53.420
 (laughing)

00:39:53.420 --> 00:39:56.500
 Again, I think a rom-com set in the meat judging world

00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:58.100
 would be, genuinely would be good.

00:39:58.100 --> 00:39:58.940
 - Meat cute.

00:39:58.940 --> 00:39:59.780
 - Meat cute.

00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:00.620
 There we go.

00:40:00.620 --> 00:40:01.660
 - Oh, God.

00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:04.100
 - The heads bump over a frozen beef cart.

00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:05.660
 (laughing)

00:40:05.660 --> 00:40:07.300
 - No, so she, at one point,

00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:09.620
 was the foremost meat judge in the country.

00:40:09.620 --> 00:40:11.980
 And I think, I don't know what year this was.

00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:14.140
 She was competing, but there was a competition in Houston.

00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:17.460
 This just shows you how brutal meat judging is, right?

00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:19.060
 She was in the top 10 nationally.

00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:20.220
 She was doing brilliantly.

00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:24.980
 And then she misjudged the age of one beef carcass

00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:27.060
 and plummeted down to 36.

00:40:27.060 --> 00:40:28.380
 - Wow. - To 36 position.

00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:29.620
 So, you know, just, it can be--

00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:31.740
 - How wrong did she get it really wrong?

00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:32.580
 (laughing)

00:40:32.580 --> 00:40:36.260
 - This meat is from 1743.

00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:38.140
 - I think this meat's alive.

00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:40.340
 (laughing)

00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:41.940
 - I don't know, it doesn't relate,

00:40:41.940 --> 00:40:44.540
 but it just goes to show it's, it's tough.

00:40:44.540 --> 00:40:45.900
 I think they have some in Australia too.

00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:47.860
 I think there is meat judging there too.

00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:48.700
 - Wow.

00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:51.780
 - It sounds like you have to judge the hot carcass weight.

00:40:51.780 --> 00:40:52.620
 - Yeah.

00:40:52.620 --> 00:40:54.940
 - The amount of kidney fat, amount of heart fat,

00:40:54.940 --> 00:40:56.420
 area of rib eye muscle.

00:40:56.420 --> 00:40:57.740
 - All from just looking at it.

00:40:57.740 --> 00:40:58.580
 - Yeah.

00:40:58.580 --> 00:41:00.140
 - If you got stuck in a freezer,

00:41:00.140 --> 00:41:01.980
 like one of these big butcher freezers,

00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:05.100
 let's say you're kind of, the door closes itself,

00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:07.740
 but you put your foot there to stop it from closing,

00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:10.500
 but then you slip on a sausage or something.

00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:13.660
 And your foot goes out of the way and the door closes.

00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:15.500
 It doesn't open from the inside.

00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:17.740
 What's the best thing inside the freezer

00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:20.900
 to help you get through that door, I would say?

00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:21.740
 - Do you know the answer?

00:41:21.740 --> 00:41:23.300
 - Yeah, this is a real thing that happened last.

00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:24.900
 - Oh, wasn't, yeah, wasn't there a guy

00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:27.700
 who beat his way out with something?

00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:29.140
 (laughing)

00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:30.580
 - Is there a bone?

00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:31.780
 - Oh, a bone.

00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:32.620
 - Interesting.

00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:34.780
 - A skeleton key bone that you can,

00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:38.820
 yeah, he calves, he's a whittler.

00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:40.060
 - Well, you get the wishbone

00:41:40.060 --> 00:41:41.580
 and you wish that you can get one.

00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:44.140
 (laughing)

00:41:44.140 --> 00:41:46.660
 - It's not having a poo and using the frozen poo too.

00:41:46.660 --> 00:41:47.660
 - No, I don't.

00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:50.300
 - Dan, you're in a freezer, everything's frozen.

00:41:50.300 --> 00:41:52.700
 There's no need to have the poo.

00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:54.540
 - If only I had something to freeze.

00:41:54.540 --> 00:41:55.740
 (laughing)

00:41:55.740 --> 00:41:57.860
 Guess I gotta take a shit.

00:41:57.860 --> 00:42:01.540
 - That's the only logical thing to do here.

00:42:01.540 --> 00:42:02.760
 Shit my way out.

00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:06.340
 - Dan, this lift has been stopped for just 30 seconds.

00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:07.180
 Wait to see it.

00:42:07.180 --> 00:42:09.820
 - No, no, no, I insist, I'll get us out of this.

00:42:09.820 --> 00:42:13.500
 - I must freeze the poo to fashion it into a presser

00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:15.200
 to press the button for help.

00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:17.940
 (laughing)

00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:20.340
 - A room full of frozen meats.

00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:22.560
 I'll find my own tools, thank you.

00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:24.820
 (laughing)

00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:27.220
 - So you say no to that though.

00:42:27.220 --> 00:42:28.260
 - Why did I never broadcast your Desert Island Dicks

00:42:28.260 --> 00:42:29.100
 episode, Dan?

00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:30.740
 (laughing)

00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:32.420
 - No music for me, thank you, Laura.

00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:33.460
 - My next track.

00:42:33.460 --> 00:42:34.300
 (laughing)

00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:36.220
 - So your luxury item is...

00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:38.480
 (laughing)

00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:42.260
 - No, it wasn't that.

00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:43.100
 - What happened?

00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:43.940
 - What?

00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:44.780
 - This really happened.

00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:46.860
 - Now this really happened to a guy called Mr. McCabe

00:42:46.860 --> 00:42:50.140
 who's a butcher and apparently the beef is too slippery.

00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:51.340
 If you grab a frozen beef,

00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:53.460
 it's kind of too slippy to bash your way out.

00:42:53.460 --> 00:42:54.500
 - Okay.

00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:56.660
 - If you get a big sort of chunk of lamb,

00:42:56.660 --> 00:42:59.140
 you can't really, you can't get any purchase on it

00:42:59.140 --> 00:43:01.180
 and it's often too big.

00:43:01.180 --> 00:43:04.940
 But the perfect thing is a black pudding.

00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:06.580
 If you get a full black pudding,

00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:08.820
 especially one made by the Royal Butcher,

00:43:08.820 --> 00:43:12.660
 H.M. Sheridan of Ballata, Aberdeenshire.

00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:13.900
 These are exactly the right size.

00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:14.740
 - That's specific.

00:43:14.740 --> 00:43:15.580
 Did he tell you this last?

00:43:15.580 --> 00:43:17.540
 - What a weird secret sponsorship.

00:43:17.540 --> 00:43:19.660
 (laughing)

00:43:19.660 --> 00:43:21.340
 - Are you getting money on the side?

00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:24.380
 - Apparently it's almost exactly the same size

00:43:24.380 --> 00:43:26.260
 because you know one of those police battering rams

00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:28.260
 that you knock down on the dance floor.

00:43:28.260 --> 00:43:29.100
 It's like that.

00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:33.460
 And this guy managed to knock his way out of the freezer

00:43:33.460 --> 00:43:36.540
 and he said, I'm really lucky.

00:43:36.540 --> 00:43:38.540
 We sell about two or three each week

00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:40.020
 and this was the last one we had.

00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:40.860
 - Oh wow.

00:43:40.860 --> 00:43:41.700
 - So if he'd have sold one more,

00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:42.820
 he would have been stuck there forever.

00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:43.660
 - That's brilliant.

00:43:43.660 --> 00:43:45.940
 - Are they buying them as battering rams?

00:43:45.940 --> 00:43:47.420
 Is that Aberdeen police?

00:43:47.420 --> 00:43:49.340
 (laughing)

00:43:49.340 --> 00:43:51.500
 - As he leaves the freezer, he looks back

00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:52.980
 and he's down in the corner.

00:43:52.980 --> 00:43:53.820
 - Daddy, you're coming.

00:43:53.820 --> 00:43:55.220
 No, thank you.

00:43:55.220 --> 00:43:57.060
 - I'll get myself now.

00:43:57.060 --> 00:43:57.900
 - 20 more shits.

00:43:57.900 --> 00:43:59.180
 I should have a battered ram out of this.

00:43:59.180 --> 00:44:00.540
 - I've got a sister.

00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:02.620
 - Type we went to an escape room with you, daddy.

00:44:02.620 --> 00:44:04.260
 (laughing)

00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:05.500
 - Yeah, no lab back there.

00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:07.700
 - How about this?

00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:08.860
 How about putting a door handle

00:44:08.860 --> 00:44:09.820
 on the other side of the door?

00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:12.100
 - Yeah, I mean, why do we not?

00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:14.180
 - Honestly, most of them do have.

00:44:14.180 --> 00:44:15.020
 - Okay, most do.

00:44:15.020 --> 00:44:16.740
 - Any that I've been in have got a big red button

00:44:16.740 --> 00:44:18.060
 that you can press and get out.

00:44:18.060 --> 00:44:19.220
 - That's cool, yeah.

00:44:19.220 --> 00:44:21.540
 - Sorry, how many freezers have you been in

00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:23.500
 that the door's shut and you have to let yourself out of?

00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:24.340
 - A couple.

00:44:24.340 --> 00:44:25.180
 (laughing)

00:44:25.180 --> 00:44:26.020
 - Okay.

00:44:26.020 --> 00:44:27.820
 - I used to work in kitchens and stuff.

00:44:27.820 --> 00:44:29.460
 - Oh, okay, okay.

00:44:29.460 --> 00:44:34.060
 Have you guys heard of wretchtubklat?

00:44:34.060 --> 00:44:35.140
 - Wretchtubklat.

00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:35.980
 - The rapper.

00:44:35.980 --> 00:44:36.820
 - I don't even know.

00:44:36.820 --> 00:44:37.700
 (laughing)

00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:39.500
 I don't even know what you're saying.

00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:41.460
 - Wretchtubklat.

00:44:41.460 --> 00:44:42.780
 How do you spell klat?

00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:44.980
 - K-L-A-T.

00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:48.260
 - This sounds like it's something from the Netherlands.

00:44:48.260 --> 00:44:49.540
 - It's actually Australia.

00:44:49.540 --> 00:44:50.740
 - Oh, okay, this is wrong.

00:44:50.740 --> 00:44:53.540
 - Wretchtubklat, is it a kind of meat, a rare meat?

00:44:53.540 --> 00:44:54.380
 - No.

00:44:54.380 --> 00:44:57.700
 - Is it a town like one of those weird sort of outback towns?

00:44:57.700 --> 00:44:58.540
 - No.

00:44:58.540 --> 00:44:59.700
 - A society?

00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:00.540
 - No.

00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:01.380
 - It's part of a kangaroo?

00:45:01.380 --> 00:45:02.220
 - No.

00:45:02.220 --> 00:45:03.940
 - What, is it anything to do with what anything

00:45:03.940 --> 00:45:04.780
 we're talking about?

00:45:04.780 --> 00:45:06.260
 - Is it a way of cheating at cricket?

00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:09.420
 - It's, oh, there we are.

00:45:09.420 --> 00:45:11.780
 James single-handedly lowering our Australian audience

00:45:11.780 --> 00:45:13.500
 to zero as the weeks go by.

00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:16.180
 No, what is it?

00:45:16.180 --> 00:45:19.180
 It is a secret butcher language.

00:45:19.180 --> 00:45:21.740
 - No wonder we haven't heard it, it's a secret.

00:45:21.740 --> 00:45:23.500
 - It's a butcher language, that's great.

00:45:23.500 --> 00:45:24.700
 - It's a secret butcher language.

00:45:24.700 --> 00:45:27.620
 Okay, so what do you think the secret language is?

00:45:27.620 --> 00:45:30.700
 - Oh, it's in meat displays in the window.

00:45:30.700 --> 00:45:31.540
 - Oh, I see.

00:45:31.540 --> 00:45:33.260
 - So you arrange the sofas.

00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:34.900
 - And it means I'm available.

00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:36.820
 - Yeah, it's like a traffic light party,

00:45:36.820 --> 00:45:37.660
 but for butchers only.

00:45:37.660 --> 00:45:39.580
 - Yeah, yeah, but for butchers.

00:45:39.580 --> 00:45:42.020
 - Well, the clue is in the name, Wretchtubklat.

00:45:42.020 --> 00:45:43.900
 - Oh, if you read it backwards,

00:45:43.900 --> 00:45:45.060
 or is it an anagram?

00:45:45.060 --> 00:45:47.260
 - Wretchtub, butcher, but talk butcher.

00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:48.900
 Butcher talk.

00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:51.580
 Butcher talk is the secret language that is shared.

00:45:51.580 --> 00:45:54.540
 And this has been going since the 1960s.

00:45:54.540 --> 00:45:56.500
 Butchers all over Australia use this,

00:45:56.500 --> 00:45:59.060
 and it's been in Australian movies as well.

00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:01.460
 Whereby they talk backwards to each other

00:46:01.460 --> 00:46:04.460
 so that they can say stuff that the customer can't hear

00:46:04.460 --> 00:46:07.380
 in order to, yeah, absolutely.

00:46:07.380 --> 00:46:08.220
 - In order to talk.

00:46:08.220 --> 00:46:09.540
 - Quick, get the age sauce.

00:46:09.540 --> 00:46:11.980
 (all laughing)

00:46:11.980 --> 00:46:12.820
 - In order to what?

00:46:12.820 --> 00:46:17.820
 - So you might say, on steltuck, knee, et, poos,

00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:21.380
 (all laughing)

00:46:21.380 --> 00:46:24.380
 and that means no cutlets in the shop.

00:46:24.380 --> 00:46:25.540
 And you would say that out loud

00:46:25.540 --> 00:46:28.140
 so that everyone, sometimes a massive butchers in Australia

00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:30.100
 might have 20 butchers, the serving people,

00:46:30.100 --> 00:46:31.940
 and they would know to just immediately eliminate that

00:46:31.940 --> 00:46:32.780
 as part of the process.

00:46:32.780 --> 00:46:34.660
 - Ah, I see, but you don't upset the customer.

00:46:34.660 --> 00:46:37.020
 - Exactly, and you don't want to upset the customer.

00:46:37.020 --> 00:46:40.260
 On dug kuf e kaff.

00:46:40.260 --> 00:46:42.380
 Oh, good food.

00:46:42.380 --> 00:46:43.220
 - Fake.

00:46:43.220 --> 00:46:44.820
 - It's no good, fuck face.

00:46:44.820 --> 00:46:47.220
 (all laughing)

00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:49.100
 - Really good that they've worked that out.

00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:51.140
 - It's pretty, like the rest of it,

00:46:51.140 --> 00:46:54.340
 like as the examples, it's pretty misogynistic, I have to say.

00:46:54.340 --> 00:46:55.980
 - Why is it needed though?

00:46:55.980 --> 00:46:58.460
 - Well, largely because if there's a difficult customer,

00:46:58.460 --> 00:47:00.580
 they want to be able to say difficult customer.

00:47:00.580 --> 00:47:01.420
 - To be rude about it.

00:47:01.420 --> 00:47:03.940
 - It feels like, but the most of customer facing roles

00:47:03.940 --> 00:47:06.220
 that haven't had to do this, has there?

00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:08.300
 - Yeah, no, but I guess you're all in one line

00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:11.580
 and if you need to get a message down the line to,

00:47:11.580 --> 00:47:12.580
 everyone hears it in the shop.

00:47:12.580 --> 00:47:14.620
 - So you're already sticking up for these sexist butchers.

00:47:14.620 --> 00:47:17.340
 - I'm not, I'm telling you that it exists.

00:47:17.340 --> 00:47:18.500
 That's what I'm trying to say.

00:47:18.500 --> 00:47:20.540
 - It's actually in my rom-com now,

00:47:20.540 --> 00:47:21.500
 the meat judging rom-com.

00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:23.380
 I think there should be a nice, like maybe the lovers

00:47:23.380 --> 00:47:27.020
 speak to each other using a butcher talk,

00:47:27.020 --> 00:47:27.860
 whatever it was called.

00:47:27.860 --> 00:47:28.700
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:47:28.700 --> 00:47:29.540
 - Something clatch.

00:47:29.540 --> 00:47:30.380
 - Yeah, retch tub clatch.

00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:31.220
 - Retch tub clatch.

00:47:31.220 --> 00:47:32.700
 - Yeah, subtitled the entire movie

00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:35.220
 so that you can see what makes it more classy, I guess.

00:47:35.220 --> 00:47:37.700
 - Yeah, but it just says no good, fuck face.

00:47:37.700 --> 00:47:38.540
 But along the bottom of the,

00:47:38.540 --> 00:47:40.660
 that's nice and romantic, isn't it?

00:47:40.660 --> 00:47:42.940
 - That's the closing line, that's it.

00:47:42.940 --> 00:47:44.300
 - And the kiss, and...

00:47:44.300 --> 00:47:45.380
 - Frankly, my dear.

00:47:45.380 --> 00:47:46.820
 (all laughing)

00:47:46.820 --> 00:47:48.300
 - I don't do cook-a-club.

00:47:48.300 --> 00:47:50.900
 (upbeat music)

00:47:50.900 --> 00:47:56.380
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show.

00:47:56.380 --> 00:47:57.660
 And that is my fact.

00:47:57.660 --> 00:48:01.300
 My fact this week is that the first wireless headset microphone

00:48:01.300 --> 00:48:03.420
 was made for Kate Bush.

00:48:03.420 --> 00:48:06.260
 And it was made out of an old coat hanger.

00:48:06.260 --> 00:48:07.820
 - Oh, wow.

00:48:07.820 --> 00:48:08.980
 First of all, how?

00:48:08.980 --> 00:48:11.140
 - Well, you're just making it sort of go around the ears,

00:48:11.140 --> 00:48:11.980
 aren't you?

00:48:11.980 --> 00:48:14.180
 You need the perfect bit that actually,

00:48:14.180 --> 00:48:15.180
 that you use the hanger.

00:48:15.180 --> 00:48:16.020
 - Yeah.

00:48:16.020 --> 00:48:18.260
 - You would attach the microphone, which would be--

00:48:18.260 --> 00:48:20.340
 - Oh, so you're just wearing a coat hanger around your ear?

00:48:20.340 --> 00:48:21.300
 - Exactly. - Oh, okay.

00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:22.140
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:48:22.140 --> 00:48:23.340
 - It's basically those Madonna mics, right?

00:48:23.340 --> 00:48:24.180
 - Yeah.

00:48:24.180 --> 00:48:26.220
 - Those steps mics, I would call them, but yes.

00:48:26.220 --> 00:48:27.060
 - Yeah, Brittany Mike.

00:48:27.060 --> 00:48:27.900
 - Brittany Mike.

00:48:27.900 --> 00:48:28.740
 - Brittany Mike.

00:48:28.740 --> 00:48:29.900
 It should be called a Bush Mike, basically,

00:48:29.900 --> 00:48:31.900
 because she is the founder.

00:48:31.900 --> 00:48:34.140
 - Does it quite roll up too well, does it?

00:48:34.140 --> 00:48:35.540
 (all laughing)

00:48:35.540 --> 00:48:38.020
 At best, you're thinking of a problematic president,

00:48:38.020 --> 00:48:40.420
 at worst, if you're thinking of something much,

00:48:40.420 --> 00:48:42.220
 much more than what you are.

00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:44.380
 - But yeah, so this is, so it's interesting to know

00:48:44.380 --> 00:48:47.100
 that we know the very first time anyone wore

00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:49.580
 one of these Madonna Brittany mics,

00:48:49.580 --> 00:48:50.420
 and it was Kate Bush.

00:48:50.420 --> 00:48:53.700
 It was on her tour, The Tour of Life, in 1979.

00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:56.500
 It was a song called Moving, which was the opening number,

00:48:56.500 --> 00:48:58.180
 and the reason that she needed it

00:48:58.180 --> 00:49:00.540
 was because there was so much choreography.

00:49:00.540 --> 00:49:03.260
 There was so much costume change and everything,

00:49:03.260 --> 00:49:05.500
 movement that she needed her hands

00:49:05.500 --> 00:49:06.500
 for everything that she did.

00:49:06.500 --> 00:49:07.900
 She couldn't hold a microphone.

00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:10.620
 So it was one of the sound engineers.

00:49:10.620 --> 00:49:12.820
 Two names come up when you look into it.

00:49:12.820 --> 00:49:14.540
 It's a bit hard to nail it down,

00:49:14.540 --> 00:49:17.740
 but one person was called Martin Fisher.

00:49:17.740 --> 00:49:18.700
 A lot of people said it was him.

00:49:18.700 --> 00:49:20.300
 Some people say it was Gordon Patterson.

00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:21.380
 It was definitely one of the two,

00:49:21.380 --> 00:49:23.300
 and it was on this tour that it was done,

00:49:23.300 --> 00:49:27.140
 and it was done on Kate Bush's only ever tour that she did.

00:49:27.140 --> 00:49:27.980
 - She only did one tour.

00:49:27.980 --> 00:49:29.140
 - She's never done another tour.

00:49:29.140 --> 00:49:30.580
 She's done a residency.

00:49:30.580 --> 00:49:32.060
 - She's not allowed to travel to Zarkite.

00:49:32.060 --> 00:49:32.900
 - Oh, really?

00:49:32.900 --> 00:49:34.540
 - Yeah, she's not into it.

00:49:34.540 --> 00:49:37.060
 And it's a shame because it sounds like

00:49:37.060 --> 00:49:39.380
 she might've been one of the greatest touring acts

00:49:39.380 --> 00:49:40.660
 that you could ever see.

00:49:40.660 --> 00:49:41.500
 I mean, this--

00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:43.140
 - What would she have invented on her future tours?

00:49:43.140 --> 00:49:44.380
 - Exactly, yeah.

00:49:44.380 --> 00:49:46.780
 But listen, so this, the Tour of Life,

00:49:46.780 --> 00:49:48.060
 as I say it was called,

00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:49.620
 this is like a few highlights

00:49:49.620 --> 00:49:51.860
 that you would've seen in that show, right?

00:49:51.860 --> 00:49:54.340
 So we opened with Whalesong that was playing

00:49:54.340 --> 00:49:56.980
 with Kate Bush's shadow projected dancing

00:49:56.980 --> 00:49:58.660
 while the curtains were starting to part

00:49:58.660 --> 00:50:00.180
 and revealing the stage.

00:50:00.180 --> 00:50:02.340
 And then after a song or two,

00:50:02.340 --> 00:50:05.260
 the whole theater was filled with the sound of heartbeats

00:50:05.260 --> 00:50:07.060
 and red lights.

00:50:07.060 --> 00:50:12.060
 There was large oval upholstered red satin egg womb-like ball

00:50:12.060 --> 00:50:14.980
 that would be rolled onto stage with Kate inside

00:50:14.980 --> 00:50:16.860
 where she would sing the song Room for the Life

00:50:16.860 --> 00:50:18.540
 as she was rolled around the stage,

00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:21.260
 hence not being able to use her hands.

00:50:21.260 --> 00:50:23.660
 There was a moment where she was singing a song

00:50:23.660 --> 00:50:26.140
 called Violin where she was chased around the stage

00:50:26.140 --> 00:50:28.740
 by two dancers dressed as giant violins.

00:50:28.740 --> 00:50:30.780
 There was poetry readings from her brother.

00:50:30.780 --> 00:50:33.980
 A magician came out and did an act with a floating wand.

00:50:33.980 --> 00:50:36.980
 She came out as a World War II pilot.

00:50:36.980 --> 00:50:40.420
 She came out as a Wild Western cowboy-esque looking thing

00:50:40.420 --> 00:50:44.340
 with a rifle and she would shoot ribbons at the dancers.

00:50:44.340 --> 00:50:46.020
 I mean, the whole thing with every song

00:50:46.020 --> 00:50:47.660
 had a theme and a production to it

00:50:47.660 --> 00:50:49.780
 and it was a spectacle, basically.

00:50:49.780 --> 00:50:51.900
 - She's probably still writing the second song.

00:50:51.900 --> 00:50:52.740
 (laughing)

00:50:52.740 --> 00:50:54.420
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:50:54.420 --> 00:50:57.220
 - I did go and sit, do you know about,

00:50:57.220 --> 00:51:00.780
 what would it have been about 2016, maybe 2015,

00:51:00.780 --> 00:51:03.460
 something like that, nearly 10 years ago,

00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:08.460
 she did a night of about 20 nights at Hammersmith Apollo

00:51:08.460 --> 00:51:11.260
 and me and my mum managed to get tickets.

00:51:11.260 --> 00:51:14.100
 It was like, you know, when you get set up all the laptops,

00:51:14.100 --> 00:51:16.740
 it's like NASA space station trying to get tickets.

00:51:16.740 --> 00:51:17.580
 - F5, F5, F5.

00:51:17.580 --> 00:51:19.900
 - We got them, literally, we got them

00:51:19.900 --> 00:51:22.620
 and that was pretty, pretty good.

00:51:22.620 --> 00:51:24.260
 It was the first time she performed live

00:51:24.260 --> 00:51:26.540
 in somewhere like 25 years, unreal.

00:51:26.540 --> 00:51:30.740
 And she flew, she flew at the, no, she did, she flew.

00:51:30.740 --> 00:51:32.860
 So she did this song at the end

00:51:32.860 --> 00:51:36.500
 where suddenly like a big crash of thunder happened

00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:39.260
 and I don't, I mean, obviously she'll have been attached

00:51:39.260 --> 00:51:43.460
 to it, but like, you know the room I'm talking about,

00:51:43.460 --> 00:51:45.260
 the Apollo, right?

00:51:45.260 --> 00:51:47.220
 I don't know, 'cause she wasn't attached

00:51:47.220 --> 00:51:49.340
 to the ceiling directly above the audience,

00:51:49.340 --> 00:51:52.220
 but she flew right out to like,

00:51:52.220 --> 00:51:55.340
 what looked like touching distance to touch in the circle.

00:51:55.340 --> 00:51:57.980
 And she's, I think, you know, she wouldn't mind

00:51:57.980 --> 00:51:59.700
 of saying this, she's getting on his arcade.

00:51:59.700 --> 00:52:01.620
 Like, it was-- - She's 50 something now.

00:52:01.620 --> 00:52:03.500
 - I gasped purely out of admiration,

00:52:03.500 --> 00:52:05.700
 purely out of concern for her welfare

00:52:05.700 --> 00:52:07.780
 as she flew directly towards us.

00:52:07.780 --> 00:52:09.180
 We were in the circle.

00:52:09.180 --> 00:52:12.380
 It was like, absolutely terrifying

00:52:12.380 --> 00:52:14.180
 and incredible and mesmerising.

00:52:14.180 --> 00:52:16.300
 - Yeah, I think she's in her 60s now.

00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:18.020
 - Blimey. - Yeah, yeah.

00:52:18.020 --> 00:52:21.180
 - Was that by any chance, Wuthering Heights,

00:52:21.180 --> 00:52:22.020
 when she was doing that song?

00:52:22.020 --> 00:52:23.860
 - No, it wasn't that song, no, no.

00:52:23.860 --> 00:52:26.420
 It was like a, it was a really aggressive song.

00:52:26.420 --> 00:52:29.420
 It was that big crash of thunder and then she just sort of,

00:52:29.420 --> 00:52:31.140
 I think it was called the dawn of something

00:52:31.140 --> 00:52:32.780
 and she just flew out to us

00:52:32.780 --> 00:52:34.500
 and she looked like a big crow.

00:52:34.500 --> 00:52:37.380
 - And at the time, did you think she's flying?

00:52:37.380 --> 00:52:38.220
 - Yeah. - You did?

00:52:38.220 --> 00:52:39.060
 - Yeah, I did.

00:52:39.060 --> 00:52:40.260
 - I would as well with Kate Bush.

00:52:40.260 --> 00:52:41.500
 She has mystical qualities.

00:52:41.500 --> 00:52:43.580
 - Yeah, yeah, it was so good.

00:52:43.580 --> 00:52:45.980
 - Maybe she did, maybe she invented something.

00:52:45.980 --> 00:52:46.820
 - There we go.

00:52:46.820 --> 00:52:48.860
 - We don't have yet, like the bush rocket,

00:52:48.860 --> 00:52:51.260
 which kind of flies her up in the air.

00:52:51.260 --> 00:52:52.100
 Something hidden.

00:52:52.100 --> 00:52:53.500
 - Maybe that's why she doesn't talk

00:52:53.500 --> 00:52:56.780
 'cause she's like, I don't want everybody to know about it.

00:52:56.780 --> 00:52:57.620
 - Yeah.

00:52:57.620 --> 00:53:02.340
 I've invented flying, but I don't want to, I don't want to brag.

00:53:02.340 --> 00:53:07.340
 - So she, Kate Bush, shares a birthday with Emily Bronte,

00:53:07.340 --> 00:53:08.620
 who wrote "Wuthering Heights".

00:53:08.620 --> 00:53:09.900
 - No. - Which is her...

00:53:09.900 --> 00:53:10.740
 - It's interesting.

00:53:10.740 --> 00:53:12.260
 - I'm not gonna say it's her big song,

00:53:12.260 --> 00:53:14.100
 but it's one of the biggest, isn't it?

00:53:14.100 --> 00:53:14.940
 - That is big.

00:53:14.940 --> 00:53:15.780
 - That was the breakthrough song.

00:53:15.780 --> 00:53:16.620
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:53:16.620 --> 00:53:17.460
 - That is big.

00:53:17.460 --> 00:53:21.700
 - And 30th of July, 1818 and 1958, respectively.

00:53:21.700 --> 00:53:22.540
 - That's amazing.

00:53:22.540 --> 00:53:23.540
 - And can I just tell you a quick thing

00:53:23.540 --> 00:53:24.780
 about the word "wuthering"?

00:53:24.780 --> 00:53:25.620
 - Oh yeah. - Yes, please.

00:53:25.620 --> 00:53:26.460
 - What does it mean?

00:53:26.460 --> 00:53:27.300
 - Yeah, no idea.

00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:29.340
 - Is it like any "wuthering"?

00:53:29.340 --> 00:53:30.180
 - "Wuthering Heights".

00:53:30.180 --> 00:53:31.020
 - "Wuthering Heights"?

00:53:31.020 --> 00:53:33.020
 - To fly to the circle of a venue.

00:53:33.020 --> 00:53:33.860
 - That's it, that's it.

00:53:33.860 --> 00:53:35.180
 - Yeah. - The "wuthering height".

00:53:35.180 --> 00:53:36.940
 - It feels, on a matter of peocly,

00:53:36.940 --> 00:53:38.660
 it feels like "wuthering" almost.

00:53:38.660 --> 00:53:39.500
 - Yeah.

00:53:39.500 --> 00:53:41.260
 - Like the wind, especially 'cause of the book,

00:53:41.260 --> 00:53:43.940
 it feels like the moors are blowing stuff and...

00:53:43.940 --> 00:53:45.100
 - That's pretty much it, is it?

00:53:45.100 --> 00:53:46.780
 - But it's pretty much, she, I think,

00:53:46.780 --> 00:53:50.460
 was just about the first to say "wuthering", 'cause it was...

00:53:50.460 --> 00:53:52.180
 - Is it "wuthering" but with a Yorkshire accent?

00:53:52.180 --> 00:53:53.020
 - It's not. - It's not.

00:53:53.020 --> 00:53:53.860
 (laughing)

00:53:53.860 --> 00:53:54.700
 - It's not from there.

00:53:54.700 --> 00:53:57.180
 - It's a book dictated by Nora.

00:53:57.180 --> 00:53:59.900
 - It was previously used much more as "wuthering",

00:53:59.900 --> 00:54:02.220
 with an H, an extra H, "wuthering",

00:54:02.220 --> 00:54:03.260
 which meant rushing along,

00:54:03.260 --> 00:54:04.580
 and it was usually a reference to wind,

00:54:04.580 --> 00:54:05.620
 like just like you were saying, James,

00:54:05.620 --> 00:54:10.260
 and a "witherer" was a lusty, a strong, or a stout person.

00:54:10.260 --> 00:54:11.860
 - Really, 'cause like "withered" now

00:54:11.860 --> 00:54:13.380
 is the opposite of lusty and strong.

00:54:13.380 --> 00:54:14.780
 - And it's again with an extra H,

00:54:14.780 --> 00:54:16.580
 so it's a "witherer", you know,

00:54:16.580 --> 00:54:18.540
 that was in the Francis Groves Dictionary

00:54:18.540 --> 00:54:20.460
 of the Volga Tongue, his one was.

00:54:20.460 --> 00:54:23.660
 And there was also a word to make a whizzing

00:54:23.660 --> 00:54:25.820
 or a rushing noise, which was "to wuther".

00:54:25.820 --> 00:54:26.660
 - To wuther.

00:54:26.660 --> 00:54:28.260
 - So it could have been "wuthering heights".

00:54:28.260 --> 00:54:29.580
 - That's "wuthering heights".

00:54:29.580 --> 00:54:31.460
 - It sounds like something Elmer Fudd would write.

00:54:31.460 --> 00:54:32.460
 (laughing)

00:54:32.460 --> 00:54:33.780
 - "Wuthering heights".

00:54:33.780 --> 00:54:36.260
 - It does sound like, "Watch out, I'm watering here!"

00:54:36.260 --> 00:54:38.100
 (laughing)

00:54:38.100 --> 00:54:39.100
 - She hadn't read the book

00:54:39.100 --> 00:54:41.820
 when she wrote "Wuthering Heights", Kate Bush.

00:54:41.820 --> 00:54:42.660
 - Really?

00:54:42.660 --> 00:54:44.020
 - She gets a lot of the plot points in.

00:54:44.020 --> 00:54:44.860
 - Oh, she does?

00:54:44.860 --> 00:54:45.700
 - She must have read the spark notes or something.

00:54:45.700 --> 00:54:48.580
 - She'd watched "The Adaptation" on the BBC,

00:54:48.580 --> 00:54:50.780
 which was really big the year before.

00:54:50.780 --> 00:54:52.100
 It was absolutely massive.

00:54:52.100 --> 00:54:54.540
 And she wrote the song based on the book

00:54:54.540 --> 00:54:56.140
 and then later on read the book.

00:54:56.140 --> 00:54:57.340
 - Oh, but that's dangerous,

00:54:57.340 --> 00:54:59.380
 'cause sometimes they really change the plot, don't they?

00:54:59.380 --> 00:55:00.500
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:55:00.500 --> 00:55:03.580
 - I did, in me, a-level drama.

00:55:03.580 --> 00:55:06.980
 We had to do, what's that Noel Coward play with Elvira?

00:55:06.980 --> 00:55:07.820
 "Blide Spirit".

00:55:07.820 --> 00:55:08.660
 - "Blide Spirit".

00:55:08.660 --> 00:55:11.580
 - In the film, there's a car crash at the end,

00:55:11.580 --> 00:55:13.300
 and I hadn't read the rest of the play,

00:55:13.300 --> 00:55:15.540
 and I just wrote about the car crash at the end.

00:55:15.540 --> 00:55:16.580
 (laughing)

00:55:16.580 --> 00:55:18.580
 I got called into Mrs. Bray's office,

00:55:18.580 --> 00:55:20.900
 and she was like, "So can you just tell me again?"

00:55:20.900 --> 00:55:24.500
 Which bit inspired you to talk about the car crash scene?

00:55:24.500 --> 00:55:27.980
 And I was literally just chatting pure,

00:55:27.980 --> 00:55:31.060
 I was woodering on, and she was like, "Yep, yep."

00:55:31.060 --> 00:55:33.460
 And so it's not in the play, maybe,

00:55:33.460 --> 00:55:36.100
 it's only in the film. - That's incredible.

00:55:36.100 --> 00:55:37.900
 - And she made me write it all again.

00:55:37.900 --> 00:55:39.460
 - I had the exact same experience

00:55:39.460 --> 00:55:42.140
 with Winnie the Pooh and "The Blustery Day" as--

00:55:42.140 --> 00:55:44.100
 - Oh, come on. - In your A-levels.

00:55:44.100 --> 00:55:45.940
 (laughing)

00:55:45.940 --> 00:55:46.980
 - Fortunately, the--

00:55:46.980 --> 00:55:48.340
 - Did you think Winnie was a Pooh?

00:55:48.340 --> 00:55:51.380
 (laughing)

00:55:51.380 --> 00:55:53.380
 - Piglet uses him to beat his way out of a freezer,

00:55:53.380 --> 00:55:55.220
 doesn't he? (laughing)

00:55:55.220 --> 00:55:56.260
 - No, fortunately, in my case,

00:55:56.260 --> 00:55:58.580
 the screen adaption was very close to the source material,

00:55:58.580 --> 00:56:03.420
 so I got away with it, but it was, I know that fear, yeah.

00:56:03.420 --> 00:56:06.420
 - I searched on the newspaper archives,

00:56:06.420 --> 00:56:09.020
 newspapers.com and the British newspaper archives

00:56:09.020 --> 00:56:11.180
 for the first mention of Kate Bush.

00:56:11.180 --> 00:56:12.740
 And the first mention I could find

00:56:12.740 --> 00:56:15.100
 was from the Burton Observer and Chronicle,

00:56:15.100 --> 00:56:17.260
 and it was from the week that "Wuthering Heights" came out,

00:56:17.260 --> 00:56:19.500
 because she was pretty unknown at that stage.

00:56:19.500 --> 00:56:22.700
 And in the first week, it went to, I think,

00:56:22.700 --> 00:56:24.540
 like number 29 in the charts.

00:56:24.540 --> 00:56:27.500
 It wasn't like huge, but it was there.

00:56:27.500 --> 00:56:30.580
 And the review said,

00:56:30.580 --> 00:56:33.780
 how do we stop Emily Bronte spinning in her grave?

00:56:33.780 --> 00:56:35.700
 The easiest way would be to call back

00:56:35.700 --> 00:56:39.100
 in all the copies of Kate Bush's "Wuthering Heights".

00:56:39.100 --> 00:56:40.940
 Singing the role of ghostly Kathy,

00:56:40.940 --> 00:56:43.380
 she appeals for Heathcliff to let her in.

00:56:43.380 --> 00:56:45.140
 If Heathcliff has any sense,

00:56:45.140 --> 00:56:48.060
 he'll plug his ears with cotton wool and go to bed.

00:56:48.060 --> 00:56:49.540
 - Wow. - What a tit.

00:56:49.540 --> 00:56:52.100
 - I believe that's the first review of that.

00:56:52.100 --> 00:56:52.940
 - Who wrote that?

00:56:52.940 --> 00:56:54.580
 - It was in the Burton Observer,

00:56:54.580 --> 00:56:55.940
 and it was just initials.

00:56:55.940 --> 00:56:57.740
 I think it was said A-H or something,

00:56:57.740 --> 00:56:59.100
 so I didn't say who the person was.

00:56:59.100 --> 00:57:02.300
 - Oh, God, I bet A-H is just constantly hoping

00:57:02.300 --> 00:57:03.540
 they never get revealed.

00:57:03.540 --> 00:57:04.860
 (laughing)

00:57:04.860 --> 00:57:06.340
 - No, it must be a different A-H.

00:57:06.340 --> 00:57:08.980
 There was loads of people with A-H at the Burton.

00:57:08.980 --> 00:57:10.900
 - I really tried to look in the Burton Observer

00:57:10.900 --> 00:57:13.060
 and Chronicle history to see if anyone

00:57:13.060 --> 00:57:14.420
 who'd worked there had these initials,

00:57:14.420 --> 00:57:15.260
 and they couldn't find them.

00:57:15.260 --> 00:57:16.940
 - Wow, you were trying to get a witch hunt going.

00:57:16.940 --> 00:57:17.900
 - Oh, God. - I was gonna email them

00:57:17.900 --> 00:57:19.460
 and say, "What do you think about it?"

00:57:19.460 --> 00:57:20.380
 - Yeah. - But this is so weird

00:57:20.380 --> 00:57:21.620
 because there's another connection there.

00:57:21.620 --> 00:57:24.420
 The novel got shocking reviews when it came out.

00:57:24.420 --> 00:57:25.260
 - Really? - Yeah.

00:57:25.260 --> 00:57:27.260
 So one said, "The only consolation

00:57:27.260 --> 00:57:28.500
 which we have in reflecting on it

00:57:28.500 --> 00:57:30.940
 is that it will never be generally read."

00:57:30.940 --> 00:57:32.220
 - Oh, wow. - And another wrote,

00:57:32.220 --> 00:57:35.300
 "How a human being could have attempted

00:57:35.300 --> 00:57:37.620
 such a book as the present without committing suicide

00:57:37.620 --> 00:57:40.100
 before he had finished a dozen chapters is a mystery."

00:57:40.100 --> 00:57:40.940
 - Wow. - Wow.

00:57:40.940 --> 00:57:42.460
 - I mean, admittedly, I do own a copy

00:57:42.460 --> 00:57:43.820
 and haven't read it, so.

00:57:43.820 --> 00:57:45.060
 - Did you not read it at school?

00:57:45.060 --> 00:57:46.700
 - No, we didn't. - Really?

00:57:46.700 --> 00:57:48.700
 - No, we didn't either.

00:57:48.700 --> 00:57:50.380
 - Really? - I've read it.

00:57:50.380 --> 00:57:53.540
 It is, look, I'm an Ambronte fan.

00:57:53.540 --> 00:57:54.860
 I'm gonna put my cards on the table.

00:57:54.860 --> 00:57:55.940
 I prefer Anne.

00:57:55.940 --> 00:57:57.580
 I think Emily's a bit overrated.

00:57:57.580 --> 00:57:58.420
 - Wow. - See, this is

00:57:58.420 --> 00:57:59.780
 what we get like this far. - A-H.

00:57:59.780 --> 00:58:00.900
 (laughing)

00:58:00.900 --> 00:58:03.540
 - I'm A-H-M, yeah, yeah. - He is, yeah.

00:58:03.540 --> 00:58:04.980
 - That is his initials. - Yeah.

00:58:04.980 --> 00:58:07.180
 - I mean, is it possible that A-H was paying tribute

00:58:07.180 --> 00:58:10.340
 to he actually, or she actually loved the song

00:58:10.340 --> 00:58:12.780
 and just wanted to reflect the original review

00:58:12.780 --> 00:58:13.900
 of the rap for the book itself? - I see.

00:58:13.900 --> 00:58:15.420
 - No way, no way.

00:58:15.420 --> 00:58:17.340
 - Nah. - Seems implausible.

00:58:17.340 --> 00:58:19.260
 - A-H is listening at home going, "Yes, yes, buy it,

00:58:19.260 --> 00:58:21.860
 "buy that, yes, please." (laughing)

00:58:21.860 --> 00:58:24.820
 - But a wireless mic born from a coat hanger.

00:58:24.820 --> 00:58:25.660
 - Yeah.

00:58:25.660 --> 00:58:28.420
 - That's exciting, 'cause now they're everywhere.

00:58:28.420 --> 00:58:30.100
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:58:30.100 --> 00:58:31.300
 Just on microphones.

00:58:31.300 --> 00:58:32.140
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:58:32.140 --> 00:58:35.220
 - In the 1930s, the BBC had a special microphone

00:58:35.220 --> 00:58:37.780
 which was only for the use of the royal family.

00:58:37.780 --> 00:58:39.580
 - Oh. - And it's in the BBC

00:58:39.580 --> 00:58:41.700
 to this day, it's an artifact of,

00:58:41.700 --> 00:58:44.100
 so it was when they started doing royal broadcasts

00:58:44.100 --> 00:58:45.620
 at Christmas, I think that was in the '30s.

00:58:45.620 --> 00:58:46.540
 - Yeah, yeah. - I think it was George V.

00:58:46.540 --> 00:58:47.900
 He started doing that. - Yeah, yeah.

00:58:47.900 --> 00:58:49.780
 - And I think a BBC sound engineer

00:58:49.780 --> 00:58:53.140
 saw the standard microphone that they were going to do it with

00:58:53.140 --> 00:58:55.500
 and thought, "This is not good enough for the king."

00:58:55.500 --> 00:58:56.580
 - Wow. - And just,

00:58:56.580 --> 00:59:00.860
 and quickly put some regal blue velvet cloth over it,

00:59:00.860 --> 00:59:03.060
 which you would think would slightly dampen the--

00:59:03.060 --> 00:59:04.060
 - It might help, it stops at some point.

00:59:04.060 --> 00:59:05.180
 - It actually helps, yeah.

00:59:05.180 --> 00:59:06.220
 - Maybe a good point.

00:59:06.220 --> 00:59:07.500
 And anyway, as the years went by,

00:59:07.500 --> 00:59:08.660
 they got more and more elaborate.

00:59:08.660 --> 00:59:12.900
 And so they ended up with this beautiful, weird-looking thing

00:59:12.900 --> 00:59:15.460
 which was in a kind of gilded cage.

00:59:15.460 --> 00:59:16.300
 - Wow. - Yeah.

00:59:16.300 --> 00:59:17.140
 - It's from Dan's home.

00:59:17.140 --> 00:59:17.980
 - It's from Dan's home.

00:59:17.980 --> 00:59:19.580
 (all laughing)

00:59:19.580 --> 00:59:20.580
 - That's really cool.

00:59:20.580 --> 00:59:23.060
 Is it because they worried that, like,

00:59:23.060 --> 00:59:25.220
 non-regal spets might get into it or something?

00:59:25.220 --> 00:59:27.860
 - No, I think it was just that we have to make it fancy

00:59:27.860 --> 00:59:29.700
 for the king or queen to use.

00:59:29.700 --> 00:59:31.620
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Kate Bush met the queen.

00:59:31.620 --> 00:59:33.540
 Went to Buckingham Palace in 2005.

00:59:33.540 --> 00:59:34.740
 She asked for her autograph.

00:59:34.740 --> 00:59:35.860
 - Who asked for whose autograph?

00:59:35.860 --> 00:59:37.300
 - Bush asked for a queen. - Oh, okay.

00:59:37.300 --> 00:59:39.060
 - Yeah. - She's the queen.

00:59:39.060 --> 00:59:40.780
 Huge fan.

00:59:40.780 --> 00:59:42.100
 - I mean, it's plausible, isn't it?

00:59:42.100 --> 00:59:43.420
 - It is plausible.

00:59:43.420 --> 00:59:45.060
 - And what did the queen do?

00:59:45.060 --> 00:59:46.380
 - Fuck off. - Yeah, exactly.

00:59:46.380 --> 00:59:48.220
 - The queen's not allowed to give out autographs.

00:59:48.220 --> 00:59:49.180
 I think. - She's not.

00:59:49.180 --> 00:59:51.020
 - Okay, someone tries to do credit card for all of that.

00:59:51.020 --> 00:59:51.860
 - You're not allowed to, yeah.

00:59:51.860 --> 00:59:53.460
 - That's just scamming the queen.

00:59:53.460 --> 00:59:54.660
 (all laughing)

00:59:54.660 --> 00:59:55.500
 - No, what is it?

00:59:55.500 --> 00:59:58.220
 - She said, (speaking foreign language)

00:59:58.220 --> 00:59:59.460
 - Oh, right.

00:59:59.460 --> 01:00:00.300
 (all laughing)

01:00:00.300 --> 01:00:01.500
 - If you were gonna try and scam the queen,

01:00:01.500 --> 01:00:02.820
 you did the mum's maiden name.

01:00:02.820 --> 01:00:04.980
 - Yeah, post-lion, yeah. - And often, she did haven't--

01:00:04.980 --> 01:00:06.500
 - And then you could, the name of the first--

01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:08.300
 - Streety grew up on? - Yeah.

01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:10.580
 - The actual heirs that just have like a first name.

01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:12.860
 - Charles Windsor and stuff like that, I guess.

01:00:12.860 --> 01:00:14.200
 - Oh, yeah.

01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:16.060
 - I think if you had the queen's autograph,

01:00:16.060 --> 01:00:18.820
 you might be able to start wars against other countries.

01:00:18.820 --> 01:00:19.660
 - Yes, that's true.

01:00:19.660 --> 01:00:20.500
 - Oh, yeah, that's probably--

01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:21.340
 - That's a big thing.

01:00:21.340 --> 01:00:22.180
 And Kate Bush, as we know--

01:00:22.180 --> 01:00:23.020
 - It's arguably more--

01:00:23.020 --> 01:00:24.100
 - She does want to do that.

01:00:24.100 --> 01:00:25.820
 She has tried several times.

01:00:25.820 --> 01:00:27.540
 - I would say that poses a bigger threat as well

01:00:27.540 --> 01:00:29.460
 than just logging into the queen's Amazon prime.

01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:30.540
 (all laughing)

01:00:30.540 --> 01:00:32.260
 - I can't imagine anyone called Bush

01:00:32.260 --> 01:00:33.340
 starting a legal war.

01:00:33.340 --> 01:00:34.180
 (all laughing)

01:00:34.180 --> 01:00:35.580
 - That sounds very unlikely.

01:00:35.580 --> 01:00:37.060
 - No, no.

01:00:37.060 --> 01:00:39.640
 (upbeat music)

01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:42.620
 - Okay, that's it.

01:00:42.620 --> 01:00:43.580
 That is all of our facts.

01:00:43.580 --> 01:00:44.820
