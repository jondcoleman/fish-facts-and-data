00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,760
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,320
 - Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,000
 of No Six Things of Fish, where we were joined

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,360
 by the incredibly funny, amazing, Maisie Adam.

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,920
 Now anyone who is familiar with our parent TV show, QI,

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,760
 will know all about Maisie.

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,840
 She's burst onto the scene in the last few years

8
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,640
 and it is no exaggeration to say

9
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,880
 that I think she is the funniest newcomer

10
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,160
 that we've had on QI over the last few years.

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,540
 She's absolutely brilliant.

12
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:30,000
 It was a great fun doing this show with her.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,280
 If you'd like to learn anything more about Maisie,

14
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,480
 then the best way to find out what she's doing

15
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,920
 is to go to her website, which is MaisieAdam.com.

16
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,440
 M-A-I-S-I-E-A-D-A-M.

17
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,920
 One thing I should quickly mention

18
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:47,480
 is that Maisie mentions Ethan in this show.

19
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,080
 That was a reference to something that happened

20
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,760
 before the microphones came on, but I had to keep it in.

21
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,680
 So just to let you know,

22
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:57,400
 Ethan is one of the QILs who does a lot of our tech stuff.

23
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,940
 If you are a Clubfish member,

24
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,920
 you might remember his episode of "Meet the Elves"

25
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:07,340
 where he gave us a fiendish question that we had to solve.

26
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,580
 We do those "Meet the Elves" shows every now and then

27
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:10,500
 on Clubfish.

28
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,740
 It's one very good reason, one of many in fact,

29
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:14,940
 that you should subscribe.

30
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:17,920
 And if you'd like to do that, then you can go to, of course,

31
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,540
 no such thing as a fish.com/apple

32
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:24,620
 and no such thing as a fish.com/patreon.

33
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:27,380
 Anyway, one final thing before we do the show,

34
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:31,120
 today's episode marks the end of our nine months

35
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,320
 of Anna Replacement shows.

36
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,820
 Yes, you got it.

37
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,600
 Next week, she will be back.

38
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,400
 Anna will be back on the podcast.

39
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,960
 So whatever you do, don't miss that episode.

40
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,160
 Listen to it 10 times.

41
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,400
 You want her to see the figures boosting up

42
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,240
 when she comes back on the show.

43
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,200
 But in the meantime,

44
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,400
 really hope you enjoy this show with Maisie.

45
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:53,040
 And all that's left to say is on with the podcast.

46
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:56,600
 (upbeat music)

47
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:10,760
 - Hello, and welcome to another episode

48
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,320
 of No Such Thing as a Fish,

49
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:16,080
 a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Hoburn.

50
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,400
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

51
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,200
 I'm sitting here with James Harkin,

52
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,760
 Andrew Hunter Murray, and Maisie Adam.

53
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,600
 And once again,

54
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,120
 we have gathered around the microphones

55
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,840
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

56
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,960
 And in no particular order, here we go.

57
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:33,640
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Maisie.

58
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,480
 - Okay, here we go.

59
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,000
 The first fizzy drink tasted of urine.

60
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,960
 Do with that what you will.

61
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,840
 Do with that what you will.

62
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,720
 - Not drink it, that's first of all.

63
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,800
 - So it was Fanta.

64
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,440
 No, sorry, that's what mankind.

65
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,360
 - Oh, to slam.

66
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,200
 - To slam.

67
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,440
 - Expect a cease and desist from Fanta offices.

68
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,920
 - What a slam on a soft drink

69
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,960
 that was invented for the Nazis.

70
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,280
 - Was it really Fanta?

71
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,120
 - I believe it was.

72
00:02:59,120 --> 00:02:59,960
 - It was.

73
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,920
 - But what a good target for me to pick, really, I suppose.

74
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,760
 - Yeah, yeah.

75
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,800
 - If you were going to kick one, yeah, Fanta's the one.

76
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,920
 - I think they couldn't get American soft drinks,

77
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,760
 and so they had to make their own.

78
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,920
 And it wasn't the Nazis, Hitler wasn't on the floor,

79
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,220
 sorting it out himself,

80
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,560
 but it was made during the Nazi regime.

81
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,160
 - Oh, okay, by Nazis.

82
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,480
 - No, by Nazis, for Nazis.

83
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,960
 - That was the slogan, oh God.

84
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,520
 But the first fizzy drink was invented

85
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,560
 in my hometown of Leeds by a man called Joseph Priestley.

86
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,040
 But crucially, it tasted of urine.

87
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,520
 - Because people in Leeds--

88
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,880
 - We know what we like and we like what we know.

89
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,240
 - Here's the crucial question, though.

90
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:43,160
 It tasted of urine, but did it have urine in it?

91
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,720
 - Yes, it did.

92
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,400
 So how did he invent this?

93
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,400
 How did he invent this work?

94
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,440
 - Accidentally, as all best things come about.

95
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,000
 Accidentally, it was at this brewery,

96
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,560
 he basically accidentally discovered

97
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,560
 the act of carbonating water, right?

98
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:01,040
 He was like a human soda stream, but by accident.

99
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,200
 - Right, brilliant.

100
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:06,040
 So he's worked out how to carbonate water.

101
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,320
 And then what he does is he makes a machine

102
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,760
 where you can get the CO2 and you can squeeze it

103
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,840
 into some water and it'll make it fizzy.

104
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,200
 But as part of that machine, he had a pig's bladder.

105
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,040
 - Okay.

106
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,860
 - Just on hand.

107
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:19,700
 - Just on hand.

108
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,840
 In those days, it was quite common to have pigs' bladders.

109
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,880
 You know, you used to play football with pigs' bladders.

110
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,040
 It was part of day-to-day life.

111
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,840
 - Everyone had a pig's bladder on them.

112
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,100
 Like a pen nowadays.

113
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,240
 (laughing)

114
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,480
 - Can I borrow your pigs' bladder?

115
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,320
 - Yeah.

116
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,320
 - Dan, can I borrow a pig's bladder?

117
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,360
 - This one's been chewed.

118
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,720
 (laughing)

119
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,600
 So he had a pig's bladder as part of the system.

120
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,720
 And he gave one of his glasses of water, fizzy water,

121
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,040
 to a friend called John Nooth.

122
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,440
 And John Nooth said, "This tastes like piss."

123
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,720
 Like, you can't sell this to people

124
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,880
 because it tastes disgusting, it tastes like piss.

125
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,680
 And he thought that it tasted like piss

126
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,120
 because it had been squeezed through this bladder.

127
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,240
 Now, Priestly couldn't taste the piss in his own water.

128
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,120
 He thought that it tasted absolutely fine.

129
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:02,960
 - Okay.

130
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,480
 - And he claimed that Nooth's servants

131
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,880
 were maybe urinating in his drinks

132
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,960
 because he was such a bad boss.

133
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,780
 - Why?

134
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:10,620
 - Really, it was a rift between.

135
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,460
 - It really was.

136
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,400
 You know, this is sharing your scientific discovery

137
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,680
 with a colleague, like Nooth, that's a big deal.

138
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,520
 - Yeah.

139
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,640
 - But Nooth said, he wrote a paper,

140
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,600
 he didn't even quietly say to Priestly,

141
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,120
 "I think this tastes a bit pissy."

142
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,080
 He wrote a paper for the Royal Society saying,

143
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,480
 "In some trials, which I have made

144
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,760
 "with Dr. Priestly's apparatus,

145
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,840
 "it always happened that the water acquired

146
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,200
 "and urinous flavor."

147
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,040
 (laughing)

148
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,880
 - That's bad, isn't it?

149
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,040
 - And it was so predominant that it could not be swallowed

150
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,600
 without some degree of reluctance.

151
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,920
 - And he didn't run that by Priestly first.

152
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,760
 - No.

153
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,600
 - Just going, "Can I just double check?

154
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,600
 "I'm not the only one tasting weed here."

155
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,120
 - I'm glad you didn't, like, you know, you've got B.O.,

156
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,240
 and instead of your friends telling you you've got B.O.,

157
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,800
 they go to the Royal Society, and that's pretty bad.

158
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,640
 - Yeah, that's amazing.

159
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,600
 - Priestly claimed that many ladies had tried the water,

160
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,760
 and nobody had complained about the urinous flavor.

161
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,480
 - He's not looking good for Nooth here.

162
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,240
 - So does history tell us whether or not

163
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,760
 his servants were pissing?

164
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,600
 - Well, we don't know.

165
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,440
 - We don't know.

166
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,280
 - That seems unlikely.

167
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,880
 - But no, and then no one else reported

168
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,720
 the urin flavor outside of him?

169
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,920
 - Well, then Nooth invented a new system

170
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,880
 that didn't have pigs' bladders in it.

171
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,720
 - Right, okay.

172
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,120
 - And it effectively was the sodas.

173
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,040
 - But also, were his servants involved in making it?

174
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,200
 - No, they must have been to a certain extent.

175
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,720
 He will have had lab technicians.

176
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,120
 - What was the missing factor

177
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,560
 when it didn't taste of urine?

178
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,640
 Was it the servants or the pigs' bladder?

179
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,080
 - It was definitely the pigs' bladder.

180
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:27,920
 - Okay.

181
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,120
 - We're unsure about the servants.

182
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,360
 - Yeah.

183
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,440
 - Is this the secret?

184
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,000
 You know how every one of these companies

185
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,080
 has a secret ingredient that we haven't been told about?

186
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,000
 They've just been hiding piss from us this whole time.

187
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,800
 - Yeah, but like 11 herbs and spices and piss.

188
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,380
 (all laughing)

189
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,440
 - Just before we go on on this,

190
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,480
 can I tell you about one thing about Nooth?

191
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,320
 - Okay.

192
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,720
 - John Mervyn Nooth.

193
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,560
 - One name.

194
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,720
 - It was such a good name.

195
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,820
 He once had a coughing fit and coughed out a bullet.

196
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:55,160
 (all laughing)

197
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:55,980
 - I know.

198
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:56,820
 - Okay.

199
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,600
 - Did he kill the person sat up his head?

200
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,800
 (all laughing)

201
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,400
 So he had this terrible coughing fit.

202
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,680
 He was like, "Oh, really coughing awfully."

203
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,240
 He'd been out in the evening.

204
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,960
 And he thought he was gonna die.

205
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,740
 His coughing was so bad, this was at about 17.99.

206
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,720
 And he threw himself down on the bed,

207
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,360
 coughing with great violence.

208
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,200
 And then when he got up,

209
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,000
 he'd coughed out something incredibly hard.

210
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,840
 - Yeah.

211
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,200
 - And it turned out just before he got ill,

212
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,680
 he'd been having a glass of wine

213
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,640
 and then he'd been called away.

214
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,240
 So he'd quickly drained the wine

215
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,080
 and it had lead shot in it.

216
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:27,920
 - Oh, okay.

217
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,880
 - So, okay, right.

218
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,720
 - Not a bullet.

219
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,560
 - Not an actual bullet.

220
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,400
 - But a bit.

221
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,720
 (all laughing)

222
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,560
 - A lead shot.

223
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,400
 - Still a bit of lead shot.

224
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,280
 - So if you were to buy, in the older days,

225
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,080
 if you were to buy like a partridge for dinner,

226
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,640
 they would often have bits of lead in it

227
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,480
 from where it had been shot.

228
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,320
 - Oh, I see.

229
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,480
 - 'Cause it's like scatter shot.

230
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,600
 - Oh, okay. - Bullet.

231
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,840
 - Okay, but still. - Shotgun pellets.

232
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,160
 - Okay. - Shotgun pellets.

233
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,800
 - Shrapnel of a bullet that he still swallowed.

234
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,280
 Okay, so the animal was killed with a bullet.

235
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,120
 That was in there.

236
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,080
 - Yeah, shotgun. - I think that counts.

237
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:54,920
 Yeah, yeah. - Yeah, yeah.

238
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,040
 - He'd coughed it out. - It's a bullet.

239
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,840
 - Well, it's part of a bullet, right?

240
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,360
 - Do we know if coughing up a bullet makes you taste piss?

241
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,840
 (all laughing)

242
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:06,280
 - Did the part, whoever the bullet went into

243
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,200
 had that animal wet itself when it died.

244
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,040
 - Yeah, yeah. - Drenched the bullet in whee.

245
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,000
 He swallowed them.

246
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,440
 - He doesn't notice 'cause of the whine.

247
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,280
 - He doesn't notice 'cause of the whine.

248
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,240
 - He doesn't notice.

249
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,400
 - And everyone's like,

250
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,520
 "Pal, have you ever noticed that

251
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,600
 "everything you taste off tastes a piss?

252
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,800
 "Maybe you've got a piss-soaked bullet."

253
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,360
 - Stuck in your throat. - Yeah.

254
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,280
 - Taste puts on it. - It's wide open.

255
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,160
 - Wow, that's food for thought.

256
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:30,400
 - So New Thend went on to make these soda streams,

257
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,120
 which he called gasogines, or gasogines,

258
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,760
 and they were really famous.

259
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,520
 And basically, if you were anyone who was anyone

260
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,640
 in the, when was it, in the 19th century,

261
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,880
 then you would have a gasogine machine,

262
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,120
 which was like a soda stream.

263
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,560
 - Not much has changed really now,

264
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,400
 isn't it?

265
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,680
 It's still quite a power move to have a soda stream.

266
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,240
 - It really is. - It really is.

267
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,440
 Yeah, I feel like they've, no,

268
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,400
 I feel like they've recently been overtaken by,

269
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,440
 if you've got an air fryer, that's the thing.

270
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,120
 - Yeah, yeah. - It's an air fryer.

271
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,320
 But soda streams were a bit of a power move.

272
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,960
 You look like you've got a soda stream.

273
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,000
 - A soda stream. - You could tell, by the way,

274
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,040
 you were brewing up to that.

275
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,520
 - I've got one as well. - Oh my God.

276
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,120
 - Here's what's embarrassing. - This sounds as gold plated.

277
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,160
 - Mine's gold plated, and we haven't used it

278
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,760
 in, I think, two years now.

279
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,080
 It just sits there as a display.

280
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,280
 - Why do you have a gold plated soda stream?

281
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,960
 - My wife likes gold things.

282
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,800
 - Is she?

283
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,760
 It's your house like Donald Trump's house.

284
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,680
 - Oh my God.

285
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,400
 - No, actually, it's probably the only gold thing

286
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,440
 in our house. - Oh, is it the only thing?

287
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,560
 - The only thing. - Yeah.

288
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,320
 - Oh, that's not true. - What about the dining table?

289
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,440
 - Yeah, the toilet and the chairs.

290
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,400
 - Do you remember Trump's house?

291
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,040
 - That's real gold, the wallpaper,

292
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,240
 and the front of the house.

293
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,760
 - And my children.

294
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,720
 - Is your wife painted like that woman in gold?

295
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,240
 - I think what it was with soda streams

296
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,600
 is when I was a kid, they were really,

297
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,480
 if one of my friends had a soda stream,

298
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,280
 it was like they were the coolest kid in town.

299
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,240
 But now it's because you don't want to buy bottles

300
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,560
 of fizzy water 'cause it's bad for the environment

301
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,160
 or something, isn't it?

302
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,640
 - Well, and you can make super sparkling water as well.

303
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,760
 And you can get the syrups

304
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,040
 that you can make your own tonic water.

305
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,240
 - Coca-Cola. - Yeah, but it's not

306
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,180
 Coca-Cola, is it?

307
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,160
 No, it is, it is.

308
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,480
 - Is it real Coca-Cola? - Well, it's not real.

309
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,820
 - Well, it's not real.

310
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:07,660
 - No, no, no, it is.

311
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:08,500
 - What it is. - Fans are

312
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,880
 for all those Nazi parties in the house.

313
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,200
 (laughing)

314
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,800
 - It tastes like, this is a good thing,

315
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,000
 and I would, you know,

316
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,320
 if soda stream ought to advertise on Fish,

317
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,280
 that'd be fine by me, just throwing it out there.

318
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,400
 But it tastes like the Coke you'd get on a ferry.

319
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,680
 You know that kind of Coke?

320
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,840
 - No. - Or sort of like a ferry.

321
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,280
 - Like Roller-Cola.

322
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,680
 - It's not completely, it's a bit like that.

323
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,020
 Yeah, what's Roller-Cola?

324
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:31,000
 - Like bad Coke, like knock-off Coke.

325
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,720
 - It was like 5P when Coca-Cola was 20P,

326
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,040
 Roller-Cola was 5P.

327
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,560
 - I just want to reiterate, this stuff is great.

328
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,400
 I love it.

329
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,800
 I'm so happy with my soda stream.

330
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,120
 I have used mine in the last two years.

331
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,740
 - I actually don't think that soda stream

332
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,120
 are going to have on their advertising

333
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,000
 like the Coke you get on a ferry.

334
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,400
 - Yeah, that's nearly as bad a slogan

335
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,320
 as buy Nazis for Nazis.

336
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,040
 (laughing)

337
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,360
 - But it's really good.

338
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,000
 It's really good I use it all the time.

339
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,920
 - It tastes like piss.

340
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,760
 - Yeah.

341
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,280
 - Good, as it should do.

342
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,120
 - But I am.

343
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,360
 - Just like Mumbo used to make.

344
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,720
 (laughing)

345
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,680
 - I think that might be something to do

346
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,800
 with my servants though.

347
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,640
 I just have a hunch.

348
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,680
 (laughing)

349
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,520
 - Yeah.

350
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:08,080
 - Presley, just a quick word about Presley.

351
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:08,920
 - What a guy.

352
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:12,040
 - What a guy, so fluent in six languages.

353
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:15,600
 He wrote over 500 books in pamphlets.

354
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,440
 What an amazing scientist.

355
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,840
 - That sounds like someone who's written 490 pamphlets.

356
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,080
 (laughing)

357
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,320
 - Yeah, 499 pamphlets.

358
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,120
 One book listing all of the pamphlets that you can read.

359
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,960
 He's credited with inventing or discovering

360
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,680
 how oxygen is made up.

361
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,720
 He was a lunatic, very excitingly.

362
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,920
 So the Lunar Society, which was this thing

363
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,960
 with Erasmus Darwin and all these amazing scientists

364
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,800
 at the time.

365
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,400
 They used to meet when it was a full moon

366
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,960
 so they could see their way home

367
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,280
 using the light of the moon in the very dark night.

368
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,400
 It's really cool, eh?

369
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,000
 Yeah, what an extraordinary character.

370
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,720
 - The thing about him being a lunatic,

371
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,760
 that meant he was kind of pro-science.

372
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,840
 - Yeah.

373
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:59,680
 - He was also not of the Protestant faith

374
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,400
 and he was also kind of sympathetic

375
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,720
 with the French Revolution.

376
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,800
 And this meant that he had lots of enemies

377
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,520
 and lots of people didn't like him.

378
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,840
 And there's a thing called the Presley riots.

379
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,560
 So he moved to Birmingham after he left Leeds

380
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,480
 and they had a dinner to sort of say

381
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,000
 how great the French Revolution was.

382
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,040
 And a load of people in Birmingham decided

383
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,200
 to wreck their place where they had the dinner

384
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,920
 and then go to Presley's house and Wreck his house.

385
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,000
 - Was he in?

386
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,960
 - He was, he was in when they started to come

387
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,760
 with the pitchforks and the-

388
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,160
 - Oh, like proper Wreck his house.

389
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,440
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, they did.

390
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,280
 - Oh.

391
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,200
 - And his lamp, oh, they didn't just,

392
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,920
 not the lamp off the mantelpiece, they went full.

393
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,080
 - He and his wife managed to get to the hills

394
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,960
 so they could see what was happening.

395
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,720
 But they were away from the mob.

396
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,520
 But his son was still there.

397
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:49,120
 And his son was trying to kind of save everything.

398
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,080
 And in the end, he had to flee as well.

399
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,280
 And the interesting thing about it

400
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,640
 is because it was anti-establishment

401
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,800
 and it was the establishment who were attacking him,

402
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,500
 we think that possibly some people involved

403
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,880
 in the Birmingham government

404
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,560
 might have been involved with this.

405
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,400
 - Right.

406
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,780
 - And Pitt, who was the prime minister then,

407
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:09,800
 they asked for help against these rioters

408
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,680
 and they were very, very slow to react.

409
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,800
 The government were like, oh yeah, we'll help, we'll help.

410
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,400
 But it was like days and days and days

411
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,640
 before they sent anyone to Birmingham to help.

412
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:20,280
 So really they were kind of in on it as well, the government.

413
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,560
 - Yeah, just crazy.

414
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,200
 - Or at least kind of passive on it.

415
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,440
 - Yeah, complicit, yeah.

416
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,880
 - Samuel Johnson called him an evil man.

417
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,840
 Like he was really in it.

418
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,680
 - Yeah.

419
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,520
 - It was a bit harsh.

420
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,280
 - He really did not like carbonated drinks.

421
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,680
 (laughing)

422
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,520
 - Yeah.

423
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,400
 It's sort of weird to imagine now

424
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,000
 how controversial it was at the time.

425
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,840
 - Yeah, it's mad, isn't it?

426
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,680
 - But he supported, yeah.

427
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,980
 - Just to be pro-science.

428
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,160
 - He also supported the American Revolution.

429
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:46,680
 - And he was a bit equivocal on the monarchy

430
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,480
 and on the idea of virgin birth.

431
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,320
 - Yeah.

432
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,140
 - So it was all, you know.

433
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,720
 - He was quite loved by the American government,

434
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,560
 wasn't he?

435
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,380
 - When he got there, yeah.

436
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:54,220
 - He was very popular.

437
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,060
 - Hung out with George Washington.

438
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,160
 - They love a carbonated drink, though.

439
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,400
 (laughing)

440
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,520
 You've ever seen the Super Bowl?

441
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:02,440
 You can't move for Pepsi, Grant, sponsorship.

442
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,520
 - Have you ever heard of this school

443
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,880
 around the area of leads?

444
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,800
 Oh, I think it's around the area of leads.

445
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,080
 Batley Grammar School?

446
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,080
 - I know Batley.

447
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:11,920
 - You know Batley?

448
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,200
 I would very much believe that they have a grammar school.

449
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,480
 - Yeah, well, this is where he went to school.

450
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,320
 - Oh, yeah.

451
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,360
 - So very, very old school, obviously,

452
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,400
 because he went to it, yeah.

453
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,520
 And I looked into it to see if they'd produced

454
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,840
 any other sort of interesting drinks

455
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,640
 through their students, and it turns out that they did.

456
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,480
 - No.

457
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:32,960
 - Yeah, Richard John Reid, the co-founder

458
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,920
 of Innocent Smoothies and Innocent Drinks

459
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:36,760
 went to the very same school.

460
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,720
 - He went to Batley?

461
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,960
 - Yeah, he went to Batley Grammar School.

462
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,880
 - Batley Grammar, that's great.

463
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,480
 - And more so than the smoothies,

464
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,720
 he is sort of the person who is credited

465
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,720
 with pioneering wackaging.

466
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,480
 Wackaging, yeah.

467
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,560
 - Like putting the little hats on top, is that what that is?

468
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,600
 - No, it's now when the drink sort of says

469
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,240
 on the side and says put in the fridge.

470
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,080
 - Hi, I'm a smoothie.

471
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:55,920
 - Yeah, put me in the fridge.

472
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:00,320
 - Oh, it gives the personalities to the package.

473
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,040
 - It was them, wasn't it, who invented that?

474
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,920
 - Yeah, more specifically, this guy from Batley School

475
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,600
 was credited, yeah, Richard Reid.

476
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,800
 - I was so pro Batley School until you said that.

477
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,520
 I think they need to burn it down.

478
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,280
 - But also though, as soon as you said it,

479
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,960
 and you said he was the inventor of Innocence Mealy,

480
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,520
 I immediately just pictured him to be wearing

481
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,320
 one of these knitted hats,

482
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,240
 going around Batley Grammar School corridors

483
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,920
 in a little knitted woolly hat,

484
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,400
 going brrr, I'm cold, put me in the fridge.

485
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:31,000
 Oh, there's Richard again, there's bullying.

486
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,040
 - Has anyone heard of the soft drink Golaka Pei?

487
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:34,880
 - Golaka Pei.

488
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,720
 - Golaka Pei.

489
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,800
 - Oh, one word.

490
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,320
 - No, it's two words, Golaka,

491
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,720
 G-O-L-O-K-A-N-M-P-A-Y.

492
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,720
 - Golaka Pei, no?

493
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,000
 - No, what is it from?

494
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,400
 - It's from India.

495
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,000
 - Oh no.

496
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,840
 - Oh what?

497
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,680
 - Is it uriny?

498
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,520
 - It's very uriny.

499
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,720
 - Oh no, whose wee is in it?

500
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,640
 - It's cow urine, 5% by volume, cow urine.

501
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,960
 - Five percent, that's a bit piss heavy for a drink.

502
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,600
 - We should say we did a fact ages ago

503
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,760
 about the fact that cow urine is drunk more,

504
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,760
 over there is kind of, it's more normalized

505
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,600
 as a drink, isn't it?

506
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,320
 - Certainly more normalized than it is here, I would say.

507
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:14,120
 - But you wouldn't drink it as just cow urine,

508
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,640
 it's an ingredient in something.

509
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,120
 - I'm afraid some people do.

510
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:17,960
 - Yeah, you just drink it.

511
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,800
 - Straight?

512
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,640
 - Yeah.

513
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,960
 - So it's,

514
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,800
 - No.

515
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,640
 - We haven't tried it.

516
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,240
 - No, would you?

517
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,080
 - Yeah.

518
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,000
 - You would try it.

519
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,680
 - For just to be able to say.

520
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,600
 - Ethan, bring in the cow urine.

521
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,200
 (all laughing)

522
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,280
 - Ethan is Dan's gold-covered servant, by the way.

523
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,120
 (all laughing)

524
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,760
 - He's coming in like Julie Walters with two suits.

525
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,400
 (all laughing)

526
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,000
 - I love that it's milkmates busy milking the cow one morning,

527
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,240
 Dan is fractionally behind the milk boy.

528
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,520
 - Calling on the penis, yeah.

529
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,960
 (all laughing)

530
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,200
 - So yeah, we have said before,

531
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,240
 there's the Cow Commission of India,

532
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,000
 and this is, they're linked to like Hindu nationalist groups,

533
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,240
 and they think that according to their traditional medicine,

534
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,840
 cow urine is supposed to be an antidote for all sorts of,

535
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,920
 I mean, anything you can think of,

536
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,560
 inflammation, eczema, arthritis, leprosy.

537
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,960
 - A bit of cow piss sorts it out.

538
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,520
 - A bit of cow piss is supposed to sort it out.

539
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,480
 Currently no concrete scientific evidence that it works,

540
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,800
 but you can buy a soft drink called Golaka Pei,

541
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,760
 which contains 5% urine,

542
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,320
 but at least it does contain other herbs.

543
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,120
 - That's nice for them to put those in, isn't it?

544
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:29,200
 - Yeah, such as Tulsi Brahmi and Shank Pushpi,

545
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,040
 and orange and lemon as well.

546
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,960
 - So herbs, orange, lemon, and cow whey.

547
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,840
 - Yeah, that's a drink.

548
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,680
 - I'm afraid so.

549
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,280
 - And a drink not exclusively used for getting better,

550
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,880
 like some people will just have that on the go.

551
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,840
 - Like Luca's own, I suppose.

552
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,160
 - Yeah, yes, yes.

553
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,800
 - 'Cause that is a good illness drink.

554
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,640
 - It's an illness drink,

555
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,000
 but some people are having it day to day life.

556
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,960
 - Absolutely.

557
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,480
 - Do you think, sorry to bring the tone down

558
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,440
 on this quite high brow podcast,

559
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,440
 do you think they taste wildly different, can we, in pig whey?

560
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,360
 - No, but I reckon probably an expert would be able to.

561
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,560
 I reckon you'll be able to learn.

562
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,360
 - You reckon there's somebody that could have a sip of both.

563
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,200
 - Absolutely.

564
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,760
 - Be able to point out like how people can point out

565
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,480
 Coke and Pepsi.

566
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,960
 Someone's out there doing it with pig and cow whey.

567
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,040
 - Yeah, 'cause I could do Coke and Diet Coke, I reckon.

568
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,000
 - Oh yeah, oh, Diet Coke.

569
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,320
 Well, Diet Coke tastes like this.

570
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,680
 (all laughing)

571
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:23,240
 - I can do tea and coffee, I don't even know what you're down to.

572
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:27,040
 - Oh, Andy, you really thought that was a big thing, did you?

573
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,760
 I don't want to brag, guys, but I know the difference.

574
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,720
 - Like on your first go.

575
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:35,000
 - Diet Coke and Diet Coke are more similar to each other

576
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,600
 than I think you're in a pig urine whey.

577
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,440
 - Please go.

578
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,280
 - Please go.

579
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,860
 (upbeat music)

580
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:50,000
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is James.

581
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,680
 - Okay, my fact this week is that Brazilian footballer,

582
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:55,640
 Formiga, is the only athlete to ever compete

583
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,400
 in a team sport in seven Olympics.

584
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,360
 But when she was born, it was illegal for women

585
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,700
 to play football in Brazil.

586
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,800
 - This is such a good fact.

587
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,760
 This is such a good fact about such a good player.

588
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,440
 - Oh yeah, do you know about Formiga?

589
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,040
 - Yeah, so, and also, as you say,

590
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,200
 it was illegal when she was born,

591
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,440
 and so women's football wasn't in the Olympics.

592
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:20,320
 So that means that she has played in every Olympics

593
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,040
 where women's football has existed.

594
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:22,880
 - Right.

595
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,720
 - So the next Olympics will be the first one

596
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,760
 in women's football history not to feature Formiga.

597
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,200
 - Do you like her for a hundred meters run

598
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,640
 that have been in every race since 1896?

599
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,480
 - Yeah.

600
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,320
 - Yeah.

601
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,160
 - It's like that, isn't it?

602
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,000
 - It's unreal.

603
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,840
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

604
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,560
 - So, '96 was her first one.

605
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:45,560
 - Yes, so she was born in '78, I think, yeah.

606
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:50,400
 And Brazil had a law from 1941 until 1979,

607
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,600
 and they didn't really make it proper until 1981,

608
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,840
 that girls and women were not allowed to play football,

609
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,200
 but wasn't just professional,

610
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,720
 they weren't allowed to play in schools

611
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,440
 or even play for fun.

612
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,560
 So my daughter, on Friday,

613
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,000
 will go to her first football lesson.

614
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,600
 She's 18, 19 months old,

615
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,160
 and if she was Formiga, it would have been illegal,

616
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,920
 she could have been arrested for going and playing football.

617
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,920
 - It's absolutely insane,

618
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,760
 'cause there's a very famous player called Marta, right?

619
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,960
 And she wasn't allowed to play football,

620
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,960
 actively discouraged, she really wanted to.

621
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,320
 So she used to just on the street,

622
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:28,640
 just have a balled up bits of shopping bags,

623
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,320
 basically to use as a ball, playing on her own.

624
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:34,320
 Then she would sort of sneak in to play with other teams,

625
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,120
 which were boys entirely,

626
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,600
 and it was a horrible experience for her.

627
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,160
 If she ever scored a goal, it was seen as a terrible thing.

628
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,480
 Like, you've embarrassed that boy.

629
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,520
 - It's an attack on the men's score.

630
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,720
 - It's an attack on the men's score.

631
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,400
 And so, never ever was she given this moment

632
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,400
 of sort of, you know, you've done good.

633
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,400
 - It was an incredible press conference, Marta gave,

634
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,680
 'cause she retired after the World Cup just gone,

635
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,320
 and it was really quite emotional watching

636
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,120
 because she's touching on, I mean,

637
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,800
 women's football across the globe, as we all know,

638
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,520
 has been hugely under-platformed,

639
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:07,320
 under-represented, hugely disrespected as a sport,

640
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,160
 bad enough in this country with the FA banning it

641
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:12,600
 for 15 years, but in Brazil, as you say,

642
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:16,080
 with that very sort of paternalistic, moralism,

643
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:20,040
 sort of society existing, it was an actual attack on,

644
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:23,320
 and it's all down to that it wasn't appropriate

645
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:26,640
 for a woman with her build to be playing football.

646
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,800
 But yeah, Famigo was 19 at her first one,

647
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,520
 43 at the last of the World Cup.

648
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,480
 43 represent in your country.

649
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,360
 - And she only ever missed one World Cup,

650
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,880
 which was the 1991.

651
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,320
 She's done seven of those as well.

652
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,440
 - Unbelievable.

653
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,000
 - The thing is as well that Marta was

654
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,160
 Brazil's leading scorer in history.

655
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,320
 She scored 115 goals,

656
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:52,800
 Neymar's the second with 79, Pelé 77.

657
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:57,160
 And Famigo had the highest number of appearances,

658
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:01,840
 which was 234, which is insane.

659
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,680
 - It's unreal.

660
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,400
 - It's more than 100 games, more than Cafu,

661
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,080
 who's got the highest in the men's game.

662
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,280
 - Yeah, and Marta, just with the stats,

663
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,520
 she's the current record holder for the most goals

664
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,480
 ever scored in a World Cup, in one World Cup,

665
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,880
 which is 17 goals, and that's for both men

666
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,720
 and women's football.

667
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,520
 - That's a lot. - For one World Cup,

668
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,360
 that's a lot.

669
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,200
 - It's mad, isn't it?

670
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,040
 - Do you?

671
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:27,040
 - You find it like Neymar recently surpassed Pelé's record,

672
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:32,100
 and like the huge notice that that gets,

673
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,080
 that it's always like screaming from the rooftops,

674
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,520
 who's the goat in football?

675
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,560
 We always end up talking about men.

676
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:40,380
 The goats are often in the women's game,

677
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,520
 because they've had to be.

678
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,840
 It's truly incredible.

679
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,680
 - I watched it.

680
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,520
 - Sorry, sorry.

681
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,360
 - What?

682
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,360
 - Please.

683
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,900
 - Go on, you watch some football.

684
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,180
 (all laughing)

685
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:52,740
 - Just as I watched last night,

686
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,480
 just as a nice bit of timing,

687
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,340
 the series Welcome to Wrexham

688
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:58,760
 is currently airing its second series,

689
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:01,600
 and one of the episodes that comes up mid-series,

690
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,440
 which I watched last night,

691
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,740
 it's the latest episode as of recording,

692
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,740
 it was all about the Wrexham women's team.

693
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:07,580
 - Yeah, so good at it.

694
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:09,260
 - No, far better than any,

695
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,940
 they make it to the,

696
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,500
 as far as we are in the series right now,

697
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,120
 they've just made it to the top of their league,

698
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:17,620
 but they take on the closest ranking team,

699
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:20,180
 and they beat them 11 to one, I think it was.

700
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:22,340
 And yeah, it's just astonishing.

701
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:24,900
 And it's so good, I guess that it's now changing,

702
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:25,740
 isn't it?

703
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,180
 - It's ever growing, but it's thanks to players,

704
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:29,540
 like for me, you go for like Marta,

705
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:31,700
 like in our own coaching, like Kelly Smith,

706
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,820
 or, well, even if you go right far back

707
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,460
 to sort of dick curl ladies,

708
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,300
 who were all sort of...

709
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,580
 - Early 20th century team,

710
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:39,660
 the dick curl ladies, yeah.

711
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,300
 - Basically the ones pre-war,

712
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:43,540
 that were getting all of the big crowds,

713
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:44,860
 and then the war happened,

714
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:45,700
 and everyone was like,

715
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,140
 "No, we need to make the men feel good."

716
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:47,980
 - Yeah.

717
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:51,500
 - So it was banned in the UK women playing football.

718
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,380
 Basically, they weren't allowed to play

719
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:56,740
 on FA affiliated grounds, which was all the grounds.

720
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:59,460
 And that ban was from 1921 until the '70s,

721
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,140
 so like you say, about 50 years.

722
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:04,880
 But there was also bans in France, in Norway, in Germany,

723
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,500
 and usually the case was that this,

724
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,060
 they thought that sport was unsuitable

725
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:10,680
 for the female body, like you say,

726
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,540
 but in West Germany's case,

727
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:15,100
 they specifically said that it was a women's soul

728
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:15,940
 that would be in Germany.

729
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:18,060
 - Oh, and I think that's quite nice

730
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,780
 as a sort of novel way of like,

731
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:21,660
 oh, we've had loads of complaints about the body,

732
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,740
 and they're like, "Oh, damaging women all this time."

733
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:24,580
 - What are we gonna say there?

734
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:25,420
 What are we gonna say?

735
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:27,020
 - They might have meant the soul of their feet,

736
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:29,260
 but it's not how it's spelled.

737
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,900
 But you don't get footballers who are like,

738
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,420
 "Oh, they're not playing this week

739
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:34,500
 because they injured their soul."

740
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,300
 - And I think that would be nice.

741
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,140
 I think, and also,

742
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,740
 I think spiritual stuff should be taken,

743
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:41,020
 like the referee should be able to say,

744
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:41,860
 immoral.

745
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:44,020
 - Immoral play.

746
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,540
 - Yeah, I didn't see the play,

747
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:47,900
 but your aura has turned a nasty shade of red,

748
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:48,740
 and I think--

749
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:49,580
 - I'm just a ref going, I'm going,

750
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:50,420
 "I'm getting bad vibes."

751
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,260
 - Yeah, exactly.

752
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,100
 - Red card.

753
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,260
 - That'd be really fun.

754
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:56,020
 - Of all the countries as well,

755
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:59,380
 to say bad for the soul of a woman,

756
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:00,580
 you wouldn't expect Germany.

757
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:01,420
 That's not very,

758
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:03,220
 it's not particularly Germanic to say, is it?

759
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,580
 - Yeah, it's not very quantifiable.

760
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:05,420
 - Of the soul.

761
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,420
 You'd expect that from one

762
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:09,660
 of the more romantic language countries.

763
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:11,300
 - Nietzsche wouldn't agree.

764
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,140
 - Well.

765
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:12,980
 - Well.

766
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:13,820
 (laughing)

767
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:15,500
 - And he, honestly.

768
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:18,820
 - Here's the thing.

769
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,580
 So, there was a recent study,

770
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:21,540
 and I quite like this,

771
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:23,180
 it's assessed that women's football

772
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,780
 is better to watch than men's.

773
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:28,380
 So it's a Swedish sports company who conducted this,

774
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,860
 they're called Speedeo,

775
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:32,420
 and they compare the women's Euros in the men's World Cup,

776
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:34,740
 and they tried to do it as mathematically as possible.

777
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:38,020
 So what they found is that women are less risk averse

778
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:40,580
 than men in the style of play.

779
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,060
 And again, they're just comparing women's Euros

780
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:42,900
 and men's World Cup.

781
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,460
 But those are two, obviously, big international tournaments.

782
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,540
 - Okay, so for instance,

783
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:49,020
 the men's teams might deliberately hold back

784
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,660
 and try and not concede goals,

785
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:52,060
 whereas the women's team aren't bothered.

786
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:52,900
 - That's it.

787
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:55,060
 So when the women's Euros passes,

788
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:57,580
 moved teams forward 3.7 meters,

789
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:00,540
 and in the men's World Cup, it was 2.5 meters.

790
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:01,380
 - Really?

791
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,220
 - That doesn't sound like a lot,

792
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:04,900
 but yeah, that's a big difference.

793
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:09,140
 - I do love you to be the commentator of the World Cup.

794
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:12,940
 - And I believe that was a 2.6 meter pass.

795
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:13,780
 - Oh, yes.

796
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:16,340
 - You're running along the sidelines with that wheel,

797
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:18,580
 that pizza cutter wheel.

798
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:19,740
 - Massive great spreadsheet.

799
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:21,460
 I'm trying to keep track of everyone.

800
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:23,100
 So is that a massive difference?

801
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:26,340
 - Well, I mean, down 2.5, 3.7.

802
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:27,180
 Sorry, I forgot.

803
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:28,420
 I'm talking to the man who can tell the difference

804
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,220
 between Coke and Diet Coke, of course,

805
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:32,380
 you would know the meters' differential.

806
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:35,740
 - That's 50% more per pass, you know, almost 50% more.

807
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:38,460
 Yeah, it's not like 10 centimeters shy of being 50% more,

808
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:42,100
 but still, but one stats expert said, I just love this.

809
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,660
 It's almost like the men are playing a game of chess

810
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:46,020
 and the women are playing something

811
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,980
 a bit more interesting than chess.

812
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,700
 (laughing)

813
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,420
 Can I say piss off because actually,

814
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:52,860
 some of us like watching chess.

815
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:55,780
 - Like 3D chess like they have in Star Wars.

816
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:56,700
 - Star Wars.

817
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:57,540
 - Wars.

818
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:58,380
 - Shit.

819
00:26:58,380 --> 00:26:59,700
 - No, oh yeah.

820
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:00,740
 - Probably both.

821
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:03,780
 - Well, it's, now we're on my home turf, I'm afraid.

822
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:04,620
 - You're all wrong.

823
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,940
 It's Harry Potter 1, remember?

824
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:08,580
 - We're on the big statues, moving forward.

825
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:11,100
 - We will get emails just to say in Star Wars,

826
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,220
 they have the hologram chest, don't they?

827
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,060
 With the monsters.

828
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:15,820
 And I think in Star Trek, I don't know what they have.

829
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:18,060
 - You've lost me here, lads, I'll be honest with you.

830
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:18,900
 You've lost me here.

831
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:19,740
 - Go back to football.

832
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:20,580
 - I think so.

833
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:23,620
 It is definitely like quite a different game in terms,

834
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:25,620
 like it feels at the ground,

835
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:27,500
 it's a very different experience watching the game.

836
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:30,300
 It's a far more inclusive, positive atmosphere,

837
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:33,380
 but actually on the pitch, that's interesting.

838
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:34,460
 - So you play, don't you?

839
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:35,300
 - Yeah.

840
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,340
 - How far do you normally pass?

841
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:40,260
 - Oh, I reckon I'm working at the moment with a good 2.7,

842
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,940
 I would say, yeah, 2.7.

843
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:45,020
 Now, I think we've heard a lot in the World Cup,

844
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:47,700
 a lot of people observing that there was a bit less diving

845
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:48,860
 and a bit less sort of,

846
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:51,300
 gonna get emails here from blokes, as we always do,

847
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,540
 but going, "Oh, really, we don't dive."

848
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:56,020
 Actually, no, on this podcast, you won't,

849
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:57,420
 you probably get quite nice people.

850
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:58,420
 - No, no, it's the first time I've,

851
00:27:58,420 --> 00:27:59,780
 I reckon as a learning about football.

852
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:02,060
 - I think metoxic masculinity is probably quite low

853
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,540
 on the listenership on here.

854
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:05,180
 - Oh, excuse me, I'm currently doing the inbox,

855
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:07,220
 can I tell you, the number of laddie emails.

856
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:08,060
 - It's full of not all men.

857
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:08,900
 - Yeah, really?

858
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,220
 (laughing)

859
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:12,180
 - One thing I found about watching women's games

860
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,900
 as opposed to men's games is that everyone

861
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,860
 who's at the ground is watching the game.

862
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:16,700
 - Oh, yeah, yeah.

863
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,580
 - So like, if you go and watch a men's football match,

864
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:21,220
 quite often you're watching the opposing fans.

865
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:22,060
 - Yeah.

866
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:23,380
 - Or, you know, they, well, you're there to--

867
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:24,220
 - They're watching you?

868
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:26,060
 - Yeah, you're kind of singing and chanting.

869
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:27,260
 - Rehearsing the chant.

870
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:28,100
 - Yeah.

871
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:28,940
 - Rehearsing.

872
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:31,220
 - Let's not remember, it's not singing and chanting,

873
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:33,420
 it's doing a lot of hand gestures at each other.

874
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,620
 - Oh, yeah, yeah.

875
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,140
 - Regardless of what's happening on the pitch.

876
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:37,380
 - Unsupported ones.

877
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:40,020
 - Yeah, yeah, it's not, it's not thumbs up.

878
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,260
 It's not thumbs up, I think.

879
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,300
 (laughing)

880
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,940
 It's not a heart shake from across the stands.

881
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:45,780
 - Yeah, 'cause you could, I mean,

882
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:48,260
 your whole end of the stands could do a great big heart.

883
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,180
 - If you ever go and watch, if you ever go and watch Leeds,

884
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:51,020
 that's what they do.

885
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:53,220
 - I'd love it, Addy's just there shouting across the game,

886
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,220
 "I love your shirt."

887
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,060
 - Yeah, yeah.

888
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:57,460
 - I'm like, "Shirt, where's that from?"

889
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:59,060
 - But yeah, and I went to watch,

890
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:00,540
 I think it was a World Cup in France,

891
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:02,420
 but everyone there was watching the game.

892
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:03,260
 - Right.

893
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:05,100
 - And really no one is doing anything else.

894
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,740
 - Yeah, but it is interesting to hear the actual

895
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:10,100
 clinical differences of the on-pitch play.

896
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:12,980
 - Maybe if the men's players kick the ball

897
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:15,980
 a bit less far or further, actually,

898
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:19,060
 then it might improve the mood in the stands.

899
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,300
 - Yeah, maybe they would need to make

900
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,380
 all those hand gestures.

901
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,740
 (laughing)

902
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:23,580
 - Maybe, cool.

903
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:25,500
 - Formiga is Portuguese for aunt.

904
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,340
 - Oh, yeah?

905
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:27,180
 - Yeah.

906
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:28,020
 - 'Cause she's got six legs.

907
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:28,860
 (laughing)

908
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:29,700
 - She's got six legs.

909
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,500
 - And she can carry 19 times her own body weight,

910
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,340
 can't she?

911
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:34,860
 - And actually, I just realized that an old word for aunt

912
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,980
 was pismaya because they smell of urine.

913
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:37,820
 - Oh, yeah.

914
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:38,660
 - Oh, look at this.

915
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:39,500
 - There we go.

916
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,020
 - So she's called aunt.

917
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,340
 That was a nickname that was given to her

918
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:43,660
 when she was at school.

919
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:45,100
 And it was when she was playing football,

920
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,900
 they said that she used to play tenaciously

921
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:47,740
 and unselfishly.

922
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:50,060
 She was much like how an aunt would operate

923
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:51,540
 within its own colony.

924
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:54,020
 Yeah, so she was very much busy all the time

925
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,500
 and always helping out.

926
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,340
 She hated it.

927
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:58,180
 Hated it as a kid.

928
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:59,460
 She learned to just accept it,

929
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:01,500
 but she said, "In the beginning, I didn't like it very much."

930
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,500
 You know, I thought it was weird.

931
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,940
 - It's quite as if she's small, doesn't it, I guess?

932
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:05,900
 - Yeah, the actual reasoning for it is nice,

933
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,100
 but to be called aunt.

934
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,380
 - Yeah, well, she said, "I don't have an antennae."

935
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,220
 Like, why would I?

936
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:11,060
 - That's true.

937
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:13,820
 - She's getting a bit hung up on where are my mandibles?

938
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:14,660
 - Yeah.

939
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:15,940
 (laughing)

940
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:19,300
 - Can I see if, Macy, I wonder if you've seen this movie.

941
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,140
 - Okay.

942
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:22,740
 - It's called, it's called--

943
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:23,580
 - Titanic.

944
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:26,340
 (laughing)

945
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:27,180
 - Fend it right back.

946
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:28,020
 - Yeah.

947
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:32,740
 - It's called, "Escape to Victory."

948
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:34,060
 - No, I've not seen this film.

949
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:34,900
 - Has no one seen this film?

950
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:35,740
 - What class?

951
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:36,580
 - It's very famous.

952
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:37,420
 - Is it?

953
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:38,620
 - I've never heard of this film before.

954
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:40,900
 It's stars, Sylvester Stallone.

955
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:41,740
 - I'm Pele.

956
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:44,300
 - Michael Cain, Pele and Bobby Moore.

957
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,140
 - What?

958
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:47,940
 - I mean, that is the real expendable.

959
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,900
 - So is it a football, or it sounds like a prison?

960
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:50,740
 - It is.

961
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:52,540
 - It is, it's a prison movie whereby--

962
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:53,700
 - There's "Gate Through Football."

963
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:56,660
 - They set up a match during the match

964
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:58,700
 as part of the match prep.

965
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,620
 But I just love there's a Stallone, Michael Cain,

966
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:01,620
 Bobby Moore, and--

967
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:02,900
 - That's mad.

968
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:03,940
 - Yeah, I know.

969
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:06,260
 - Oh my God, I didn't see this film.

970
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:07,420
 - I know, I really need to see it.

971
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:09,100
 - Is it any good?

972
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,220
 - It's a classic.

973
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:13,020
 - Yeah, I can read between those lights.

974
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:13,860
 - Yeah.

975
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:14,700
 (laughing)

976
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,420
 - It's one of the things they used to show it on like,

977
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:17,740
 Sunday evening.

978
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:20,100
 - Can I just say, if anybody ever went,

979
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,180
 "Macy Adam, I haven't seen a comedy, what's it like?"

980
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:24,260
 And somebody went, "It's classic."

981
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:25,540
 (laughing)

982
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:27,380
 - I think that would be absolutely harrowing.

983
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:28,780
 (laughing)

984
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:31,580
 - He'd rather be made by Nazis for this one.

985
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:33,820
 (laughing)

986
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:35,260
 - One for the tour poster.

987
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,500
 - One last thing on Pelle,

988
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,700
 just while we're on him very quickly.

989
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:43,060
 Pelle's last ever match, 1977, he played,

990
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,300
 and it was an exhibition match,

991
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:47,540
 and it was the New York Cosmos against Santos,

992
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:50,820
 and two teams that he used to play for.

993
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:53,340
 So, in order to make sure that he wasn't siding

994
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:54,940
 with any particular team,

995
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:56,660
 in the first half, he played with one team,

996
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:58,140
 and in the second half, he played with the other team.

997
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:58,980
 - Lovely.

998
00:31:58,980 --> 00:31:59,820
 - It's final match ever.

999
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,100
 - Absolutely love that.

1000
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:03,300
 Only Pelle could get away with doing that, though.

1001
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,140
 - Yeah.

1002
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:04,980
 - I think so.

1003
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:05,820
 - So, he didn't change ends.

1004
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:06,660
 - Oh, yes.

1005
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:08,540
 - Which must give you a slight advantage, right?

1006
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:09,380
 Possibly.

1007
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:11,900
 - Also, probably being Pelle gives you a slight advantage.

1008
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,460
 - Yeah, that's why he was so good.

1009
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:14,700
 (laughing)

1010
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:15,620
 - When I was at school,

1011
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:17,580
 we used to obviously play football for the schools,

1012
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:19,780
 and a lot of the schools would have pictures

1013
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:21,300
 that were on massive slants.

1014
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:22,140
 - Oh, my God.

1015
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,340
 - And so, like, you'd be in the first half,

1016
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:24,540
 you'd be winning five, nearly.

1017
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:26,860
 You'd end up losing, like, 21-five.

1018
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:28,300
 - I played a league in Brighton,

1019
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:29,980
 and we played on one the other day.

1020
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:31,860
 If you've ever been to Whitehawk's ground,

1021
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:33,620
 it's a fantastic club, it's Whitehawk,

1022
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:37,420
 but their ground is on a slope, sort of, left to right,

1023
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:40,580
 and up to that, like, you could ski down it.

1024
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:41,420
 You could ski down it.

1025
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:44,460
 - There was one that I played at school in Bolton.

1026
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:46,260
 This was, I think it was in primary school,

1027
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:48,860
 and it was, like, slanted, like you say,

1028
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:50,220
 from one wing to the other.

1029
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,060
 - Yeah.

1030
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:51,900
 - You can imagine that.

1031
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:52,780
 And we were all primary school kids,

1032
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:54,420
 so we didn't really know how to play football,

1033
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:56,820
 and so the ball would just always end up rolling

1034
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:59,020
 to the bottom at all 22 kids.

1035
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:00,300
 (laughing)

1036
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,340
 - It's part of the pitch.

1037
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:03,700
 - A lot of corner balls from one specific corner.

1038
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,740
 (laughing)

1039
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:07,320
 (upbeat music)

1040
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:12,460
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three.

1041
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:14,060
 That is Andy.

1042
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:17,020
 - My fact is that American schools have a sport

1043
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:19,500
 of competitive meat judging.

1044
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,620
 - No.

1045
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:21,460
 No.

1046
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,300
 - Wait.

1047
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,380
 (laughing)

1048
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:24,220
 - Meat judging.

1049
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:25,060
 - Meat judging.

1050
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:26,220
 It's less dodgy than it sounds.

1051
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,060
 - Absolutely believe.

1052
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:29,820
 - It's made, I should say,

1053
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:32,700
 this was sent in by an audience member called Kevin Fegan.

1054
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:33,880
 So thank you, Kevin.

1055
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,020
 - Kevin Fegan.

1056
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:36,460
 (laughing)

1057
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:37,300
 - Fegan.

1058
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,120
 - Yeah.

1059
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:38,960
 - Kevin Fegan.

1060
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:39,940
 - Yeah, like Kevin Keegan, but with an F.

1061
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:40,780
 - Yeah.

1062
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:41,600
 - Oh, all right.

1063
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,440
 But he's not a vegan.

1064
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,260
 - Yeah.

1065
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:44,100
 - He didn't say it as evil.

1066
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,220
 - He's a vegetarian.

1067
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:46,260
 (laughing)

1068
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,540
 - God, come on.

1069
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:48,580
 - Kevin, if you're American--

1070
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:50,380
 - If you think I'm better than that, mate,

1071
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:51,220
 you've not had any episodes.

1072
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,060
 - I loved it.

1073
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:52,900
 I loved it.

1074
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,420
 - What's Kevin saying?

1075
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:57,540
 - Kevin's saying, well, that's what it is.

1076
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:58,380
 That's the fact.

1077
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:59,220
 - That there's meat judging.

1078
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,040
 - It's competitive meat judging.

1079
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,740
 And I think this might be the most American sport possible.

1080
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:03,980
 - How can you judge meat?

1081
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:05,340
 What's the criteria?

1082
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:07,580
 - Oh, well, is this a pig or is it a cow?

1083
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:08,420
 (laughing)

1084
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:10,660
 - Step one, that's the absolute baseline.

1085
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:11,500
 No, no, no.

1086
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,580
 This is, okay, it's a college sport.

1087
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:15,340
 It's an intercollegiate sport, right?

1088
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:17,860
 So it's sort of students who are playing it.

1089
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:21,180
 And they, like all over the country,

1090
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:23,500
 teams of students practice all year,

1091
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,020
 and then they get to the competition.

1092
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:26,220
 And what you have to do is,

1093
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:29,220
 you're presented with a range of meat carcasses,

1094
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:31,660
 and you have to judge the yield,

1095
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:33,220
 how much meat you'll get out of it,

1096
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:35,060
 how much fat there is in it,

1097
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:38,260
 the consumer experience, the age of the carcass,

1098
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:40,100
 and you have to do all this by sight only.

1099
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:40,940
 - Sight only.

1100
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:42,860
 - Oh, so they don't just put a slab of meat in front of you

1101
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:44,500
 and you go, pork?

1102
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,780
 - No, no, no, no.

1103
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:47,780
 - Not just guess if it's beef or pork or lamb.

1104
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:50,140
 I'll just say, I reckon I'd be all right at this.

1105
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:52,140
 - Andy, do you think as someone who can tell the difference

1106
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:54,460
 between diet cooking and no cooking,

1107
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,740
 that you won't be good at the spot?

1108
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:56,580
 - I think I might.

1109
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:57,780
 - Yeah, I think.

1110
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:58,620
 - It sounds amazing.

1111
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:00,180
 - It's like meat chess, basically.

1112
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:04,460
 It's really like, you get 10 minutes to inspect each carcass.

1113
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:05,700
 You know, they're hanging up in front of you.

1114
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,140
 You're not really touching them much.

1115
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:09,460
 - You're in like a big cold fridge.

1116
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:10,780
 - Like a couple of butchers.

1117
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:15,780
 You're in that, and then you're asked to guess yield.

1118
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,820
 - Yeah, I mean, all sorts.

1119
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,740
 - How many portions you get?

1120
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:23,060
 - My favorite one is, and this is purely by sight,

1121
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:27,540
 you have to go and evaluate whether a table of 10 cuts

1122
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,540
 that are laid down fit a checklist

1123
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:32,460
 of the United States Department of Agricultural Standards.

1124
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:34,460
 - Who's revising this?

1125
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:36,300
 - Oh, people put so much work in it.

1126
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,300
 They train sometimes for 12 hours a day

1127
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,140
 leading up to the competition.

1128
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:40,780
 - Whilst they're in college.

1129
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:42,860
 Have you seen how expensive college is in America?

1130
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:45,580
 How fuming would these parents be if they knew?

1131
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:46,780
 Are you revising?

1132
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:48,460
 Well, I've been looking at my chickens.

1133
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:49,580
 (laughing)

1134
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,460
 They must get a scholarship, I guess, right?

1135
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:52,300
 You know, like if you're--

1136
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:53,460
 - You can't get a meat scholarship.

1137
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:56,100
 Sure, like, surely not.

1138
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:58,980
 - You only play also, they're kind of competitors.

1139
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:01,340
 They're kind of like the Mayflies of the sporting world.

1140
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:03,100
 They get, you get one season.

1141
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:03,940
 That's it.

1142
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:04,820
 You can't play twice.

1143
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:06,940
 You can't play in two consecutive years.

1144
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:08,020
 Not like Farmiga, who can play.

1145
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:09,660
 - You can't be the Farmiga without each other.

1146
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:12,340
 (laughing)

1147
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:14,220
 - Which is a nightmare for the coaches

1148
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:17,380
 that pick their star meat examiners.

1149
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:19,340
 - Trying them up for one season and then they're out.

1150
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:21,220
 - Then you're back, yeah, you're just back to the start.

1151
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,060
 Finding fresh blood, you have to.

1152
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:25,260
 - Why would you bother, genuinely,

1153
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:26,500
 why would you bother pursuing this

1154
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,980
 if you can't become one of the great meat judges

1155
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,340
 who can't do it year in, year out?

1156
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:33,060
 - There are talent scouts who come to the competitions.

1157
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:33,900
 - You're lying.

1158
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:34,740
 - No, I'm not.

1159
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:35,820
 I swear, I swear.

1160
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:38,260
 They, I mean, a lot of the students

1161
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:40,780
 are already studying agriculture, that kind of thing.

1162
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:43,940
 So a lot of the competitors will end up going into meat

1163
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:46,140
 professionally, you know, the U.S.

1164
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:49,100
 - Oh, so they might be scouted to go into these top jobs

1165
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,780
 because of how well they did at the meat judges.

1166
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:53,100
 - If you're the head of a meat company

1167
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:55,180
 and you really want the best meat judges

1168
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:57,780
 to be part of your company, you'll pay lots of money.

1169
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:00,780
 - So you'll go to some intercollegiate competition

1170
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:04,100
 and be like, wow, Steven's very good at clocking.

1171
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,500
 - Yeah, wow.

1172
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:09,700
 - And 80% of them go into food and livestock industry jobs

1173
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:11,020
 after college.

1174
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,860
 - I mean, 20% don't know.

1175
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:13,700
 (laughing)

1176
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:14,540
 - There might be some savants who have studied it.

1177
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:16,780
 - 20% just doing it for food.

1178
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:17,860
 They're going into equipment.

1179
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,420
 - They're studying poetry.

1180
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:21,100
 The meat is pure passion for them.

1181
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,460
 And then, yeah, exactly.

1182
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:23,780
 - It's just a side hobby.

1183
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:24,620
 - I just love it.

1184
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:25,460
 I love it so much.

1185
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:27,700
 - But you do, you do get like the formiga of this,

1186
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:29,980
 even though the span is just one season.

1187
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:33,740
 So there is, there is one person called Maddie Ainsley.

1188
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:37,460
 And Maddie Ainsley did seven competitions like for me.

1189
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:38,380
 - 'Cause around the country.

1190
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:39,220
 - You go around the country.

1191
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:40,060
 - You go around the country.

1192
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:40,900
 - There are seven different competitions.

1193
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:41,740
 - Within the year.

1194
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:43,140
 So this is taking up a lot of your year.

1195
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:44,900
 This is not like one meat competition.

1196
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,780
 And she won five of the sevens.

1197
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:47,620
 - That's great.

1198
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:48,460
 - She's the all star.

1199
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:49,300
 - It's going to go all bad day.

1200
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,140
 - Yeah.

1201
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:51,180
 - Wow, that's great.

1202
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:54,220
 There was one guy called Rody Hawkins,

1203
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:56,820
 who was a former meat judge from Tennessee.

1204
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:57,660
 And this is the only--

1205
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:59,100
 - That can't be a sentence.

1206
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,060
 (laughing)

1207
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:03,380
 Rody Hawkins, meat judge from Tennessee.

1208
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:05,980
 This is like if Chuck GPT wrote a novel.

1209
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:08,620
 (laughing)

1210
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:11,060
 - He was a former meat judge from Tennessee.

1211
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:13,380
 - Right, an American novel.

1212
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:16,060
 Rody Hawkins from Tennessee.

1213
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:18,220
 - He's the only famous one I could find

1214
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:21,060
 who went from meat judging to greater things.

1215
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:24,780
 He co-invented Lunchables, which is a famous--

1216
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:25,620
 - Sorry.

1217
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:26,460
 - They're good.

1218
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:27,820
 - No, no, no, come on.

1219
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:29,940
 He's judging the quality of meat.

1220
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,980
 And he came out with Lunchables.

1221
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:33,660
 (laughing)

1222
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:34,900
 - It's like a little plastic toast.

1223
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:36,620
 - Processed.

1224
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:38,900
 - With some squares of processed ham

1225
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,620
 and some squares of processed cheese

1226
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:41,900
 and some crackers.

1227
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:42,740
 - Right.

1228
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:44,180
 - Yeah, must've been up all night thinking about it.

1229
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:46,180
 (laughing)

1230
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:49,340
 - I read a Sports Illustrated article on meat judging.

1231
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:50,180
 - That was great.

1232
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:51,180
 - It's an amazing article.

1233
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:54,180
 And there's a bit that explains exactly what it takes

1234
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:56,060
 to enter these competitions and be a meat.

1235
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:59,580
 So to be a meat judge, quick decision making,

1236
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:02,180
 critical reasoning, self assurance,

1237
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:04,780
 and above all the ability to quiet one's mind

1238
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:07,220
 for up to six hours standing in frigid temperatures

1239
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:08,380
 in total silence.

1240
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:09,900
 And according to a judge from 2015--

1241
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:12,540
 - Feels like the fourth point is quite a big step up.

1242
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:14,180
 I was like self assurance, yeah.

1243
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:15,660
 And then you read the fourth one and I was like,

1244
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:17,100
 ah, down, stop me.

1245
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,940
 - Fifth ability to judge meat.

1246
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:19,780
 (laughing)

1247
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:20,620
 - Exactly.

1248
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:23,060
 But what the quote from the judge from 2015 said,

1249
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,620
 and this is to do with the total silence,

1250
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:26,820
 you have to fight your own demons

1251
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,340
 in the meat judging cooler.

1252
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:30,180
 - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1253
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:32,540
 - I don't want to fight demons in a meat judging cooler.

1254
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:34,580
 - Who are the demons in the meat judging cooler?

1255
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:35,420
 - All yours.

1256
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:36,260
 It's just the internal voices.

1257
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:38,060
 - The internal voices in the six hours

1258
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:40,340
 of silence as you stare and trying to work out

1259
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:41,740
 if it's agriculturally sound.

1260
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:42,660
 - There are moments where,

1261
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:44,540
 so this might have been in the same piece.

1262
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:46,940
 There was a student from Texas Tech.

1263
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:48,220
 She was called Taylor Schertz.

1264
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:50,700
 She was a second year student.

1265
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:51,540
 What's that?

1266
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:53,420
 (laughing)

1267
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:56,500
 Again, I think a rom-com set in the meat judging world

1268
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,100
 would be, genuinely would be good.

1269
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:58,940
 - Meat cute.

1270
00:39:58,940 --> 00:39:59,780
 - Meat cute.

1271
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:00,620
 There we go.

1272
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:01,660
 - Oh, God.

1273
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:04,100
 - The heads bump over a frozen beef cart.

1274
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,660
 (laughing)

1275
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:07,300
 - No, so she, at one point,

1276
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:09,620
 was the foremost meat judge in the country.

1277
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:11,980
 And I think, I don't know what year this was.

1278
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:14,140
 She was competing, but there was a competition in Houston.

1279
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:17,460
 This just shows you how brutal meat judging is, right?

1280
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,060
 She was in the top 10 nationally.

1281
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:20,220
 She was doing brilliantly.

1282
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:24,980
 And then she misjudged the age of one beef carcass

1283
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:27,060
 and plummeted down to 36.

1284
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:28,380
 - Wow. - To 36 position.

1285
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:29,620
 So, you know, just, it can be--

1286
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:31,740
 - How wrong did she get it really wrong?

1287
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:32,580
 (laughing)

1288
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:36,260
 - This meat is from 1743.

1289
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:38,140
 - I think this meat's alive.

1290
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:40,340
 (laughing)

1291
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:41,940
 - I don't know, it doesn't relate,

1292
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:44,540
 but it just goes to show it's, it's tough.

1293
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:45,900
 I think they have some in Australia too.

1294
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,860
 I think there is meat judging there too.

1295
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:48,700
 - Wow.

1296
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:51,780
 - It sounds like you have to judge the hot carcass weight.

1297
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:52,620
 - Yeah.

1298
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:54,940
 - The amount of kidney fat, amount of heart fat,

1299
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:56,420
 area of rib eye muscle.

1300
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,740
 - All from just looking at it.

1301
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:58,580
 - Yeah.

1302
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:00,140
 - If you got stuck in a freezer,

1303
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:01,980
 like one of these big butcher freezers,

1304
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:05,100
 let's say you're kind of, the door closes itself,

1305
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:07,740
 but you put your foot there to stop it from closing,

1306
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:10,500
 but then you slip on a sausage or something.

1307
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:13,660
 And your foot goes out of the way and the door closes.

1308
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:15,500
 It doesn't open from the inside.

1309
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,740
 What's the best thing inside the freezer

1310
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:20,900
 to help you get through that door, I would say?

1311
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:21,740
 - Do you know the answer?

1312
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:23,300
 - Yeah, this is a real thing that happened last.

1313
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:24,900
 - Oh, wasn't, yeah, wasn't there a guy

1314
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:27,700
 who beat his way out with something?

1315
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,140
 (laughing)

1316
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:30,580
 - Is there a bone?

1317
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:31,780
 - Oh, a bone.

1318
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:32,620
 - Interesting.

1319
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:34,780
 - A skeleton key bone that you can,

1320
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:38,820
 yeah, he calves, he's a whittler.

1321
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:40,060
 - Well, you get the wishbone

1322
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:41,580
 and you wish that you can get one.

1323
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:44,140
 (laughing)

1324
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:46,660
 - It's not having a poo and using the frozen poo too.

1325
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:47,660
 - No, I don't.

1326
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:50,300
 - Dan, you're in a freezer, everything's frozen.

1327
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:52,700
 There's no need to have the poo.

1328
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:54,540
 - If only I had something to freeze.

1329
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:55,740
 (laughing)

1330
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:57,860
 Guess I gotta take a shit.

1331
00:41:57,860 --> 00:42:01,540
 - That's the only logical thing to do here.

1332
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:02,760
 Shit my way out.

1333
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:06,340
 - Dan, this lift has been stopped for just 30 seconds.

1334
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:07,180
 Wait to see it.

1335
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:09,820
 - No, no, no, I insist, I'll get us out of this.

1336
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:13,500
 - I must freeze the poo to fashion it into a presser

1337
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,200
 to press the button for help.

1338
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,940
 (laughing)

1339
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:20,340
 - A room full of frozen meats.

1340
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:22,560
 I'll find my own tools, thank you.

1341
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,820
 (laughing)

1342
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:27,220
 - So you say no to that though.

1343
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:28,260
 - Why did I never broadcast your Desert Island Dicks

1344
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:29,100
 episode, Dan?

1345
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:30,740
 (laughing)

1346
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:32,420
 - No music for me, thank you, Laura.

1347
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:33,460
 - My next track.

1348
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:34,300
 (laughing)

1349
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:36,220
 - So your luxury item is...

1350
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,480
 (laughing)

1351
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:42,260
 - No, it wasn't that.

1352
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:43,100
 - What happened?

1353
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:43,940
 - What?

1354
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:44,780
 - This really happened.

1355
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:46,860
 - Now this really happened to a guy called Mr. McCabe

1356
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:50,140
 who's a butcher and apparently the beef is too slippery.

1357
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:51,340
 If you grab a frozen beef,

1358
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:53,460
 it's kind of too slippy to bash your way out.

1359
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:54,500
 - Okay.

1360
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:56,660
 - If you get a big sort of chunk of lamb,

1361
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:59,140
 you can't really, you can't get any purchase on it

1362
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:01,180
 and it's often too big.

1363
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:04,940
 But the perfect thing is a black pudding.

1364
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:06,580
 If you get a full black pudding,

1365
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:08,820
 especially one made by the Royal Butcher,

1366
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:12,660
 H.M. Sheridan of Ballata, Aberdeenshire.

1367
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:13,900
 These are exactly the right size.

1368
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:14,740
 - That's specific.

1369
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:15,580
 Did he tell you this last?

1370
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:17,540
 - What a weird secret sponsorship.

1371
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:19,660
 (laughing)

1372
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:21,340
 - Are you getting money on the side?

1373
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:24,380
 - Apparently it's almost exactly the same size

1374
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:26,260
 because you know one of those police battering rams

1375
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:28,260
 that you knock down on the dance floor.

1376
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:29,100
 It's like that.

1377
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:33,460
 And this guy managed to knock his way out of the freezer

1378
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:36,540
 and he said, I'm really lucky.

1379
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:38,540
 We sell about two or three each week

1380
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:40,020
 and this was the last one we had.

1381
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:40,860
 - Oh wow.

1382
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:41,700
 - So if he'd have sold one more,

1383
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:42,820
 he would have been stuck there forever.

1384
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:43,660
 - That's brilliant.

1385
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:45,940
 - Are they buying them as battering rams?

1386
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:47,420
 Is that Aberdeen police?

1387
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:49,340
 (laughing)

1388
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:51,500
 - As he leaves the freezer, he looks back

1389
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:52,980
 and he's down in the corner.

1390
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:53,820
 - Daddy, you're coming.

1391
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:55,220
 No, thank you.

1392
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:57,060
 - I'll get myself now.

1393
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:57,900
 - 20 more shits.

1394
00:43:57,900 --> 00:43:59,180
 I should have a battered ram out of this.

1395
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:00,540
 - I've got a sister.

1396
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:02,620
 - Type we went to an escape room with you, daddy.

1397
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:04,260
 (laughing)

1398
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:05,500
 - Yeah, no lab back there.

1399
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:07,700
 - How about this?

1400
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:08,860
 How about putting a door handle

1401
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:09,820
 on the other side of the door?

1402
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:12,100
 - Yeah, I mean, why do we not?

1403
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:14,180
 - Honestly, most of them do have.

1404
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:15,020
 - Okay, most do.

1405
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:16,740
 - Any that I've been in have got a big red button

1406
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:18,060
 that you can press and get out.

1407
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:19,220
 - That's cool, yeah.

1408
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:21,540
 - Sorry, how many freezers have you been in

1409
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:23,500
 that the door's shut and you have to let yourself out of?

1410
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:24,340
 - A couple.

1411
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:25,180
 (laughing)

1412
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:26,020
 - Okay.

1413
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:27,820
 - I used to work in kitchens and stuff.

1414
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:29,460
 - Oh, okay, okay.

1415
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:34,060
 Have you guys heard of wretchtubklat?

1416
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:35,140
 - Wretchtubklat.

1417
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:35,980
 - The rapper.

1418
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:36,820
 - I don't even know.

1419
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:37,700
 (laughing)

1420
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:39,500
 I don't even know what you're saying.

1421
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:41,460
 - Wretchtubklat.

1422
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:42,780
 How do you spell klat?

1423
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:44,980
 - K-L-A-T.

1424
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:48,260
 - This sounds like it's something from the Netherlands.

1425
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:49,540
 - It's actually Australia.

1426
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:50,740
 - Oh, okay, this is wrong.

1427
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:53,540
 - Wretchtubklat, is it a kind of meat, a rare meat?

1428
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:54,380
 - No.

1429
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:57,700
 - Is it a town like one of those weird sort of outback towns?

1430
00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:58,540
 - No.

1431
00:44:58,540 --> 00:44:59,700
 - A society?

1432
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:00,540
 - No.

1433
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:01,380
 - It's part of a kangaroo?

1434
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:02,220
 - No.

1435
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:03,940
 - What, is it anything to do with what anything

1436
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:04,780
 we're talking about?

1437
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:06,260
 - Is it a way of cheating at cricket?

1438
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:09,420
 - It's, oh, there we are.

1439
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:11,780
 James single-handedly lowering our Australian audience

1440
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:13,500
 to zero as the weeks go by.

1441
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:16,180
 No, what is it?

1442
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:19,180
 It is a secret butcher language.

1443
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:21,740
 - No wonder we haven't heard it, it's a secret.

1444
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:23,500
 - It's a butcher language, that's great.

1445
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:24,700
 - It's a secret butcher language.

1446
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:27,620
 Okay, so what do you think the secret language is?

1447
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:30,700
 - Oh, it's in meat displays in the window.

1448
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:31,540
 - Oh, I see.

1449
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:33,260
 - So you arrange the sofas.

1450
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:34,900
 - And it means I'm available.

1451
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:36,820
 - Yeah, it's like a traffic light party,

1452
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:37,660
 but for butchers only.

1453
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:39,580
 - Yeah, yeah, but for butchers.

1454
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:42,020
 - Well, the clue is in the name, Wretchtubklat.

1455
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:43,900
 - Oh, if you read it backwards,

1456
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:45,060
 or is it an anagram?

1457
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:47,260
 - Wretchtub, butcher, but talk butcher.

1458
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:48,900
 Butcher talk.

1459
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:51,580
 Butcher talk is the secret language that is shared.

1460
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:54,540
 And this has been going since the 1960s.

1461
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:56,500
 Butchers all over Australia use this,

1462
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:59,060
 and it's been in Australian movies as well.

1463
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:01,460
 Whereby they talk backwards to each other

1464
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:04,460
 so that they can say stuff that the customer can't hear

1465
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:07,380
 in order to, yeah, absolutely.

1466
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:08,220
 - In order to talk.

1467
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:09,540
 - Quick, get the age sauce.

1468
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:11,980
 (all laughing)

1469
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:12,820
 - In order to what?

1470
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:17,820
 - So you might say, on steltuck, knee, et, poos,

1471
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:21,380
 (all laughing)

1472
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:24,380
 and that means no cutlets in the shop.

1473
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:25,540
 And you would say that out loud

1474
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:28,140
 so that everyone, sometimes a massive butchers in Australia

1475
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:30,100
 might have 20 butchers, the serving people,

1476
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:31,940
 and they would know to just immediately eliminate that

1477
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:32,780
 as part of the process.

1478
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:34,660
 - Ah, I see, but you don't upset the customer.

1479
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:37,020
 - Exactly, and you don't want to upset the customer.

1480
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:40,260
 On dug kuf e kaff.

1481
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:42,380
 Oh, good food.

1482
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:43,220
 - Fake.

1483
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:44,820
 - It's no good, fuck face.

1484
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:47,220
 (all laughing)

1485
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:49,100
 - Really good that they've worked that out.

1486
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:51,140
 - It's pretty, like the rest of it,

1487
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:54,340
 like as the examples, it's pretty misogynistic, I have to say.

1488
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:55,980
 - Why is it needed though?

1489
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:58,460
 - Well, largely because if there's a difficult customer,

1490
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:00,580
 they want to be able to say difficult customer.

1491
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:01,420
 - To be rude about it.

1492
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:03,940
 - It feels like, but the most of customer facing roles

1493
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:06,220
 that haven't had to do this, has there?

1494
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:08,300
 - Yeah, no, but I guess you're all in one line

1495
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:11,580
 and if you need to get a message down the line to,

1496
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:12,580
 everyone hears it in the shop.

1497
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:14,620
 - So you're already sticking up for these sexist butchers.

1498
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:17,340
 - I'm not, I'm telling you that it exists.

1499
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:18,500
 That's what I'm trying to say.

1500
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:20,540
 - It's actually in my rom-com now,

1501
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:21,500
 the meat judging rom-com.

1502
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:23,380
 I think there should be a nice, like maybe the lovers

1503
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:27,020
 speak to each other using a butcher talk,

1504
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:27,860
 whatever it was called.

1505
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:28,700
 - Yeah, yeah.

1506
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:29,540
 - Something clatch.

1507
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:30,380
 - Yeah, retch tub clatch.

1508
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:31,220
 - Retch tub clatch.

1509
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:32,700
 - Yeah, subtitled the entire movie

1510
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:35,220
 so that you can see what makes it more classy, I guess.

1511
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:37,700
 - Yeah, but it just says no good, fuck face.

1512
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:38,540
 But along the bottom of the,

1513
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:40,660
 that's nice and romantic, isn't it?

1514
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:42,940
 - That's the closing line, that's it.

1515
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:44,300
 - And the kiss, and...

1516
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:45,380
 - Frankly, my dear.

1517
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:46,820
 (all laughing)

1518
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:48,300
 - I don't do cook-a-club.

1519
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:50,900
 (upbeat music)

1520
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:56,380
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show.

1521
00:47:56,380 --> 00:47:57,660
 And that is my fact.

1522
00:47:57,660 --> 00:48:01,300
 My fact this week is that the first wireless headset microphone

1523
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:03,420
 was made for Kate Bush.

1524
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:06,260
 And it was made out of an old coat hanger.

1525
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:07,820
 - Oh, wow.

1526
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:08,980
 First of all, how?

1527
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:11,140
 - Well, you're just making it sort of go around the ears,

1528
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:11,980
 aren't you?

1529
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:14,180
 You need the perfect bit that actually,

1530
00:48:14,180 --> 00:48:15,180
 that you use the hanger.

1531
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:16,020
 - Yeah.

1532
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:18,260
 - You would attach the microphone, which would be--

1533
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:20,340
 - Oh, so you're just wearing a coat hanger around your ear?

1534
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:21,300
 - Exactly. - Oh, okay.

1535
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:22,140
 - Yeah, yeah.

1536
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:23,340
 - It's basically those Madonna mics, right?

1537
00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:24,180
 - Yeah.

1538
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:26,220
 - Those steps mics, I would call them, but yes.

1539
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:27,060
 - Yeah, Brittany Mike.

1540
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:27,900
 - Brittany Mike.

1541
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:28,740
 - Brittany Mike.

1542
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:29,900
 It should be called a Bush Mike, basically,

1543
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:31,900
 because she is the founder.

1544
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:34,140
 - Does it quite roll up too well, does it?

1545
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:35,540
 (all laughing)

1546
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:38,020
 At best, you're thinking of a problematic president,

1547
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:40,420
 at worst, if you're thinking of something much,

1548
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:42,220
 much more than what you are.

1549
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:44,380
 - But yeah, so this is, so it's interesting to know

1550
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:47,100
 that we know the very first time anyone wore

1551
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:49,580
 one of these Madonna Brittany mics,

1552
00:48:49,580 --> 00:48:50,420
 and it was Kate Bush.

1553
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:53,700
 It was on her tour, The Tour of Life, in 1979.

1554
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:56,500
 It was a song called Moving, which was the opening number,

1555
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:58,180
 and the reason that she needed it

1556
00:48:58,180 --> 00:49:00,540
 was because there was so much choreography.

1557
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:03,260
 There was so much costume change and everything,

1558
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:05,500
 movement that she needed her hands

1559
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:06,500
 for everything that she did.

1560
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:07,900
 She couldn't hold a microphone.

1561
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:10,620
 So it was one of the sound engineers.

1562
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:12,820
 Two names come up when you look into it.

1563
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:14,540
 It's a bit hard to nail it down,

1564
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:17,740
 but one person was called Martin Fisher.

1565
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:18,700
 A lot of people said it was him.

1566
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:20,300
 Some people say it was Gordon Patterson.

1567
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:21,380
 It was definitely one of the two,

1568
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:23,300
 and it was on this tour that it was done,

1569
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:27,140
 and it was done on Kate Bush's only ever tour that she did.

1570
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:27,980
 - She only did one tour.

1571
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:29,140
 - She's never done another tour.

1572
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:30,580
 She's done a residency.

1573
00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:32,060
 - She's not allowed to travel to Zarkite.

1574
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:32,900
 - Oh, really?

1575
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:34,540
 - Yeah, she's not into it.

1576
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:37,060
 And it's a shame because it sounds like

1577
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:39,380
 she might've been one of the greatest touring acts

1578
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:40,660
 that you could ever see.

1579
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:41,500
 I mean, this--

1580
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:43,140
 - What would she have invented on her future tours?

1581
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:44,380
 - Exactly, yeah.

1582
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:46,780
 But listen, so this, the Tour of Life,

1583
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:48,060
 as I say it was called,

1584
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:49,620
 this is like a few highlights

1585
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:51,860
 that you would've seen in that show, right?

1586
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:54,340
 So we opened with Whalesong that was playing

1587
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:56,980
 with Kate Bush's shadow projected dancing

1588
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:58,660
 while the curtains were starting to part

1589
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:00,180
 and revealing the stage.

1590
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:02,340
 And then after a song or two,

1591
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:05,260
 the whole theater was filled with the sound of heartbeats

1592
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:07,060
 and red lights.

1593
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:12,060
 There was large oval upholstered red satin egg womb-like ball

1594
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:14,980
 that would be rolled onto stage with Kate inside

1595
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:16,860
 where she would sing the song Room for the Life

1596
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:18,540
 as she was rolled around the stage,

1597
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:21,260
 hence not being able to use her hands.

1598
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:23,660
 There was a moment where she was singing a song

1599
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:26,140
 called Violin where she was chased around the stage

1600
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:28,740
 by two dancers dressed as giant violins.

1601
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:30,780
 There was poetry readings from her brother.

1602
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:33,980
 A magician came out and did an act with a floating wand.

1603
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:36,980
 She came out as a World War II pilot.

1604
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:40,420
 She came out as a Wild Western cowboy-esque looking thing

1605
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:44,340
 with a rifle and she would shoot ribbons at the dancers.

1606
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:46,020
 I mean, the whole thing with every song

1607
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:47,660
 had a theme and a production to it

1608
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:49,780
 and it was a spectacle, basically.

1609
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:51,900
 - She's probably still writing the second song.

1610
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:52,740
 (laughing)

1611
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:54,420
 - Yeah, exactly.

1612
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:57,220
 - I did go and sit, do you know about,

1613
00:50:57,220 --> 00:51:00,780
 what would it have been about 2016, maybe 2015,

1614
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:03,460
 something like that, nearly 10 years ago,

1615
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:08,460
 she did a night of about 20 nights at Hammersmith Apollo

1616
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:11,260
 and me and my mum managed to get tickets.

1617
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:14,100
 It was like, you know, when you get set up all the laptops,

1618
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:16,740
 it's like NASA space station trying to get tickets.

1619
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:17,580
 - F5, F5, F5.

1620
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:19,900
 - We got them, literally, we got them

1621
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:22,620
 and that was pretty, pretty good.

1622
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:24,260
 It was the first time she performed live

1623
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:26,540
 in somewhere like 25 years, unreal.

1624
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:30,740
 And she flew, she flew at the, no, she did, she flew.

1625
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:32,860
 So she did this song at the end

1626
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:36,500
 where suddenly like a big crash of thunder happened

1627
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:39,260
 and I don't, I mean, obviously she'll have been attached

1628
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:43,460
 to it, but like, you know the room I'm talking about,

1629
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:45,260
 the Apollo, right?

1630
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:47,220
 I don't know, 'cause she wasn't attached

1631
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:49,340
 to the ceiling directly above the audience,

1632
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:52,220
 but she flew right out to like,

1633
00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:55,340
 what looked like touching distance to touch in the circle.

1634
00:51:55,340 --> 00:51:57,980
 And she's, I think, you know, she wouldn't mind

1635
00:51:57,980 --> 00:51:59,700
 of saying this, she's getting on his arcade.

1636
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:01,620
 Like, it was-- - She's 50 something now.

1637
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:03,500
 - I gasped purely out of admiration,

1638
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:05,700
 purely out of concern for her welfare

1639
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:07,780
 as she flew directly towards us.

1640
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:09,180
 We were in the circle.

1641
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:12,380
 It was like, absolutely terrifying

1642
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:14,180
 and incredible and mesmerising.

1643
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:16,300
 - Yeah, I think she's in her 60s now.

1644
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:18,020
 - Blimey. - Yeah, yeah.

1645
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:21,180
 - Was that by any chance, Wuthering Heights,

1646
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:22,020
 when she was doing that song?

1647
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:23,860
 - No, it wasn't that song, no, no.

1648
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:26,420
 It was like a, it was a really aggressive song.

1649
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:29,420
 It was that big crash of thunder and then she just sort of,

1650
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:31,140
 I think it was called the dawn of something

1651
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:32,780
 and she just flew out to us

1652
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:34,500
 and she looked like a big crow.

1653
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:37,380
 - And at the time, did you think she's flying?

1654
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:38,220
 - Yeah. - You did?

1655
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:39,060
 - Yeah, I did.

1656
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:40,260
 - I would as well with Kate Bush.

1657
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:41,500
 She has mystical qualities.

1658
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:43,580
 - Yeah, yeah, it was so good.

1659
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:45,980
 - Maybe she did, maybe she invented something.

1660
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:46,820
 - There we go.

1661
00:52:46,820 --> 00:52:48,860
 - We don't have yet, like the bush rocket,

1662
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:51,260
 which kind of flies her up in the air.

1663
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:52,100
 Something hidden.

1664
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:53,500
 - Maybe that's why she doesn't talk

1665
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:56,780
 'cause she's like, I don't want everybody to know about it.

1666
00:52:56,780 --> 00:52:57,620
 - Yeah.

1667
00:52:57,620 --> 00:53:02,340
 I've invented flying, but I don't want to, I don't want to brag.

1668
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:07,340
 - So she, Kate Bush, shares a birthday with Emily Bronte,

1669
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:08,620
 who wrote "Wuthering Heights".

1670
00:53:08,620 --> 00:53:09,900
 - No. - Which is her...

1671
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:10,740
 - It's interesting.

1672
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:12,260
 - I'm not gonna say it's her big song,

1673
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:14,100
 but it's one of the biggest, isn't it?

1674
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:14,940
 - That is big.

1675
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:15,780
 - That was the breakthrough song.

1676
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:16,620
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

1677
00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:17,460
 - That is big.

1678
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:21,700
 - And 30th of July, 1818 and 1958, respectively.

1679
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:22,540
 - That's amazing.

1680
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:23,540
 - And can I just tell you a quick thing

1681
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:24,780
 about the word "wuthering"?

1682
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:25,620
 - Oh yeah. - Yes, please.

1683
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:26,460
 - What does it mean?

1684
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:27,300
 - Yeah, no idea.

1685
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:29,340
 - Is it like any "wuthering"?

1686
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:30,180
 - "Wuthering Heights".

1687
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:31,020
 - "Wuthering Heights"?

1688
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:33,020
 - To fly to the circle of a venue.

1689
00:53:33,020 --> 00:53:33,860
 - That's it, that's it.

1690
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:35,180
 - Yeah. - The "wuthering height".

1691
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:36,940
 - It feels, on a matter of peocly,

1692
00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:38,660
 it feels like "wuthering" almost.

1693
00:53:38,660 --> 00:53:39,500
 - Yeah.

1694
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:41,260
 - Like the wind, especially 'cause of the book,

1695
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:43,940
 it feels like the moors are blowing stuff and...

1696
00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:45,100
 - That's pretty much it, is it?

1697
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:46,780
 - But it's pretty much, she, I think,

1698
00:53:46,780 --> 00:53:50,460
 was just about the first to say "wuthering", 'cause it was...

1699
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:52,180
 - Is it "wuthering" but with a Yorkshire accent?

1700
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:53,020
 - It's not. - It's not.

1701
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:53,860
 (laughing)

1702
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:54,700
 - It's not from there.

1703
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:57,180
 - It's a book dictated by Nora.

1704
00:53:57,180 --> 00:53:59,900
 - It was previously used much more as "wuthering",

1705
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:02,220
 with an H, an extra H, "wuthering",

1706
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:03,260
 which meant rushing along,

1707
00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:04,580
 and it was usually a reference to wind,

1708
00:54:04,580 --> 00:54:05,620
 like just like you were saying, James,

1709
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:10,260
 and a "witherer" was a lusty, a strong, or a stout person.

1710
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:11,860
 - Really, 'cause like "withered" now

1711
00:54:11,860 --> 00:54:13,380
 is the opposite of lusty and strong.

1712
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:14,780
 - And it's again with an extra H,

1713
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:16,580
 so it's a "witherer", you know,

1714
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:18,540
 that was in the Francis Groves Dictionary

1715
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:20,460
 of the Volga Tongue, his one was.

1716
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:23,660
 And there was also a word to make a whizzing

1717
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:25,820
 or a rushing noise, which was "to wuther".

1718
00:54:25,820 --> 00:54:26,660
 - To wuther.

1719
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:28,260
 - So it could have been "wuthering heights".

1720
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:29,580
 - That's "wuthering heights".

1721
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:31,460
 - It sounds like something Elmer Fudd would write.

1722
00:54:31,460 --> 00:54:32,460
 (laughing)

1723
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:33,780
 - "Wuthering heights".

1724
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:36,260
 - It does sound like, "Watch out, I'm watering here!"

1725
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:38,100
 (laughing)

1726
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:39,100
 - She hadn't read the book

1727
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:41,820
 when she wrote "Wuthering Heights", Kate Bush.

1728
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:42,660
 - Really?

1729
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:44,020
 - She gets a lot of the plot points in.

1730
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:44,860
 - Oh, she does?

1731
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:45,700
 - She must have read the spark notes or something.

1732
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:48,580
 - She'd watched "The Adaptation" on the BBC,

1733
00:54:48,580 --> 00:54:50,780
 which was really big the year before.

1734
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:52,100
 It was absolutely massive.

1735
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:54,540
 And she wrote the song based on the book

1736
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:56,140
 and then later on read the book.

1737
00:54:56,140 --> 00:54:57,340
 - Oh, but that's dangerous,

1738
00:54:57,340 --> 00:54:59,380
 'cause sometimes they really change the plot, don't they?

1739
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:00,500
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1740
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:03,580
 - I did, in me, a-level drama.

1741
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:06,980
 We had to do, what's that Noel Coward play with Elvira?

1742
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:07,820
 "Blide Spirit".

1743
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:08,660
 - "Blide Spirit".

1744
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:11,580
 - In the film, there's a car crash at the end,

1745
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:13,300
 and I hadn't read the rest of the play,

1746
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:15,540
 and I just wrote about the car crash at the end.

1747
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:16,580
 (laughing)

1748
00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:18,580
 I got called into Mrs. Bray's office,

1749
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:20,900
 and she was like, "So can you just tell me again?"

1750
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:24,500
 Which bit inspired you to talk about the car crash scene?

1751
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:27,980
 And I was literally just chatting pure,

1752
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:31,060
 I was woodering on, and she was like, "Yep, yep."

1753
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:33,460
 And so it's not in the play, maybe,

1754
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:36,100
 it's only in the film. - That's incredible.

1755
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:37,900
 - And she made me write it all again.

1756
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:39,460
 - I had the exact same experience

1757
00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:42,140
 with Winnie the Pooh and "The Blustery Day" as--

1758
00:55:42,140 --> 00:55:44,100
 - Oh, come on. - In your A-levels.

1759
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:45,940
 (laughing)

1760
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:46,980
 - Fortunately, the--

1761
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:48,340
 - Did you think Winnie was a Pooh?

1762
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:51,380
 (laughing)

1763
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:53,380
 - Piglet uses him to beat his way out of a freezer,

1764
00:55:53,380 --> 00:55:55,220
 doesn't he? (laughing)

1765
00:55:55,220 --> 00:55:56,260
 - No, fortunately, in my case,

1766
00:55:56,260 --> 00:55:58,580
 the screen adaption was very close to the source material,

1767
00:55:58,580 --> 00:56:03,420
 so I got away with it, but it was, I know that fear, yeah.

1768
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:06,420
 - I searched on the newspaper archives,

1769
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:09,020
 newspapers.com and the British newspaper archives

1770
00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:11,180
 for the first mention of Kate Bush.

1771
00:56:11,180 --> 00:56:12,740
 And the first mention I could find

1772
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:15,100
 was from the Burton Observer and Chronicle,

1773
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:17,260
 and it was from the week that "Wuthering Heights" came out,

1774
00:56:17,260 --> 00:56:19,500
 because she was pretty unknown at that stage.

1775
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:22,700
 And in the first week, it went to, I think,

1776
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:24,540
 like number 29 in the charts.

1777
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:27,500
 It wasn't like huge, but it was there.

1778
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:30,580
 And the review said,

1779
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:33,780
 how do we stop Emily Bronte spinning in her grave?

1780
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:35,700
 The easiest way would be to call back

1781
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:39,100
 in all the copies of Kate Bush's "Wuthering Heights".

1782
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:40,940
 Singing the role of ghostly Kathy,

1783
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:43,380
 she appeals for Heathcliff to let her in.

1784
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:45,140
 If Heathcliff has any sense,

1785
00:56:45,140 --> 00:56:48,060
 he'll plug his ears with cotton wool and go to bed.

1786
00:56:48,060 --> 00:56:49,540
 - Wow. - What a tit.

1787
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:52,100
 - I believe that's the first review of that.

1788
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:52,940
 - Who wrote that?

1789
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:54,580
 - It was in the Burton Observer,

1790
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:55,940
 and it was just initials.

1791
00:56:55,940 --> 00:56:57,740
 I think it was said A-H or something,

1792
00:56:57,740 --> 00:56:59,100
 so I didn't say who the person was.

1793
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:02,300
 - Oh, God, I bet A-H is just constantly hoping

1794
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:03,540
 they never get revealed.

1795
00:57:03,540 --> 00:57:04,860
 (laughing)

1796
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:06,340
 - No, it must be a different A-H.

1797
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:08,980
 There was loads of people with A-H at the Burton.

1798
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:10,900
 - I really tried to look in the Burton Observer

1799
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:13,060
 and Chronicle history to see if anyone

1800
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:14,420
 who'd worked there had these initials,

1801
00:57:14,420 --> 00:57:15,260
 and they couldn't find them.

1802
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:16,940
 - Wow, you were trying to get a witch hunt going.

1803
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:17,900
 - Oh, God. - I was gonna email them

1804
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:19,460
 and say, "What do you think about it?"

1805
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:20,380
 - Yeah. - But this is so weird

1806
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:21,620
 because there's another connection there.

1807
00:57:21,620 --> 00:57:24,420
 The novel got shocking reviews when it came out.

1808
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:25,260
 - Really? - Yeah.

1809
00:57:25,260 --> 00:57:27,260
 So one said, "The only consolation

1810
00:57:27,260 --> 00:57:28,500
 which we have in reflecting on it

1811
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:30,940
 is that it will never be generally read."

1812
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:32,220
 - Oh, wow. - And another wrote,

1813
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:35,300
 "How a human being could have attempted

1814
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:37,620
 such a book as the present without committing suicide

1815
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:40,100
 before he had finished a dozen chapters is a mystery."

1816
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:40,940
 - Wow. - Wow.

1817
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:42,460
 - I mean, admittedly, I do own a copy

1818
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:43,820
 and haven't read it, so.

1819
00:57:43,820 --> 00:57:45,060
 - Did you not read it at school?

1820
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:46,700
 - No, we didn't. - Really?

1821
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:48,700
 - No, we didn't either.

1822
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:50,380
 - Really? - I've read it.

1823
00:57:50,380 --> 00:57:53,540
 It is, look, I'm an Ambronte fan.

1824
00:57:53,540 --> 00:57:54,860
 I'm gonna put my cards on the table.

1825
00:57:54,860 --> 00:57:55,940
 I prefer Anne.

1826
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:57,580
 I think Emily's a bit overrated.

1827
00:57:57,580 --> 00:57:58,420
 - Wow. - See, this is

1828
00:57:58,420 --> 00:57:59,780
 what we get like this far. - A-H.

1829
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:00,900
 (laughing)

1830
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:03,540
 - I'm A-H-M, yeah, yeah. - He is, yeah.

1831
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:04,980
 - That is his initials. - Yeah.

1832
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:07,180
 - I mean, is it possible that A-H was paying tribute

1833
00:58:07,180 --> 00:58:10,340
 to he actually, or she actually loved the song

1834
00:58:10,340 --> 00:58:12,780
 and just wanted to reflect the original review

1835
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:13,900
 of the rap for the book itself? - I see.

1836
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:15,420
 - No way, no way.

1837
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:17,340
 - Nah. - Seems implausible.

1838
00:58:17,340 --> 00:58:19,260
 - A-H is listening at home going, "Yes, yes, buy it,

1839
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:21,860
 "buy that, yes, please." (laughing)

1840
00:58:21,860 --> 00:58:24,820
 - But a wireless mic born from a coat hanger.

1841
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:25,660
 - Yeah.

1842
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:28,420
 - That's exciting, 'cause now they're everywhere.

1843
00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:30,100
 - Yeah, yeah.

1844
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:31,300
 Just on microphones.

1845
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:32,140
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

1846
00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:35,220
 - In the 1930s, the BBC had a special microphone

1847
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:37,780
 which was only for the use of the royal family.

1848
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:39,580
 - Oh. - And it's in the BBC

1849
00:58:39,580 --> 00:58:41,700
 to this day, it's an artifact of,

1850
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:44,100
 so it was when they started doing royal broadcasts

1851
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:45,620
 at Christmas, I think that was in the '30s.

1852
00:58:45,620 --> 00:58:46,540
 - Yeah, yeah. - I think it was George V.

1853
00:58:46,540 --> 00:58:47,900
 He started doing that. - Yeah, yeah.

1854
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:49,780
 - And I think a BBC sound engineer

1855
00:58:49,780 --> 00:58:53,140
 saw the standard microphone that they were going to do it with

1856
00:58:53,140 --> 00:58:55,500
 and thought, "This is not good enough for the king."

1857
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:56,580
 - Wow. - And just,

1858
00:58:56,580 --> 00:59:00,860
 and quickly put some regal blue velvet cloth over it,

1859
00:59:00,860 --> 00:59:03,060
 which you would think would slightly dampen the--

1860
00:59:03,060 --> 00:59:04,060
 - It might help, it stops at some point.

1861
00:59:04,060 --> 00:59:05,180
 - It actually helps, yeah.

1862
00:59:05,180 --> 00:59:06,220
 - Maybe a good point.

1863
00:59:06,220 --> 00:59:07,500
 And anyway, as the years went by,

1864
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:08,660
 they got more and more elaborate.

1865
00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:12,900
 And so they ended up with this beautiful, weird-looking thing

1866
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:15,460
 which was in a kind of gilded cage.

1867
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:16,300
 - Wow. - Yeah.

1868
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:17,140
 - It's from Dan's home.

1869
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:17,980
 - It's from Dan's home.

1870
00:59:17,980 --> 00:59:19,580
 (all laughing)

1871
00:59:19,580 --> 00:59:20,580
 - That's really cool.

1872
00:59:20,580 --> 00:59:23,060
 Is it because they worried that, like,

1873
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:25,220
 non-regal spets might get into it or something?

1874
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:27,860
 - No, I think it was just that we have to make it fancy

1875
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:29,700
 for the king or queen to use.

1876
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:31,620
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Kate Bush met the queen.

1877
00:59:31,620 --> 00:59:33,540
 Went to Buckingham Palace in 2005.

1878
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:34,740
 She asked for her autograph.

1879
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:35,860
 - Who asked for whose autograph?

1880
00:59:35,860 --> 00:59:37,300
 - Bush asked for a queen. - Oh, okay.

1881
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:39,060
 - Yeah. - She's the queen.

1882
00:59:39,060 --> 00:59:40,780
 Huge fan.

1883
00:59:40,780 --> 00:59:42,100
 - I mean, it's plausible, isn't it?

1884
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:43,420
 - It is plausible.

1885
00:59:43,420 --> 00:59:45,060
 - And what did the queen do?

1886
00:59:45,060 --> 00:59:46,380
 - Fuck off. - Yeah, exactly.

1887
00:59:46,380 --> 00:59:48,220
 - The queen's not allowed to give out autographs.

1888
00:59:48,220 --> 00:59:49,180
 I think. - She's not.

1889
00:59:49,180 --> 00:59:51,020
 - Okay, someone tries to do credit card for all of that.

1890
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:51,860
 - You're not allowed to, yeah.

1891
00:59:51,860 --> 00:59:53,460
 - That's just scamming the queen.

1892
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:54,660
 (all laughing)

1893
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:55,500
 - No, what is it?

1894
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:58,220
 - She said, (speaking foreign language)

1895
00:59:58,220 --> 00:59:59,460
 - Oh, right.

1896
00:59:59,460 --> 01:00:00,300
 (all laughing)

1897
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:01,500
 - If you were gonna try and scam the queen,

1898
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:02,820
 you did the mum's maiden name.

1899
01:00:02,820 --> 01:00:04,980
 - Yeah, post-lion, yeah. - And often, she did haven't--

1900
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:06,500
 - And then you could, the name of the first--

1901
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:08,300
 - Streety grew up on? - Yeah.

1902
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:10,580
 - The actual heirs that just have like a first name.

1903
01:00:10,580 --> 01:00:12,860
 - Charles Windsor and stuff like that, I guess.

1904
01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:14,200
 - Oh, yeah.

1905
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:16,060
 - I think if you had the queen's autograph,

1906
01:00:16,060 --> 01:00:18,820
 you might be able to start wars against other countries.

1907
01:00:18,820 --> 01:00:19,660
 - Yes, that's true.

1908
01:00:19,660 --> 01:00:20,500
 - Oh, yeah, that's probably--

1909
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:21,340
 - That's a big thing.

1910
01:00:21,340 --> 01:00:22,180
 And Kate Bush, as we know--

1911
01:00:22,180 --> 01:00:23,020
 - It's arguably more--

1912
01:00:23,020 --> 01:00:24,100
 - She does want to do that.

1913
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:25,820
 She has tried several times.

1914
01:00:25,820 --> 01:00:27,540
 - I would say that poses a bigger threat as well

1915
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:29,460
 than just logging into the queen's Amazon prime.

1916
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:30,540
 (all laughing)

1917
01:00:30,540 --> 01:00:32,260
 - I can't imagine anyone called Bush

1918
01:00:32,260 --> 01:00:33,340
 starting a legal war.

1919
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:34,180
 (all laughing)

1920
01:00:34,180 --> 01:00:35,580
 - That sounds very unlikely.

1921
01:00:35,580 --> 01:00:37,060
 - No, no.

1922
01:00:37,060 --> 01:00:39,640
 (upbeat music)

1923
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:42,620
 - Okay, that's it.

1924
01:00:42,620 --> 01:00:43,580
 That is all of our facts.

1925
01:00:43,580 --> 01:00:44,820
 Thank you so much for listening.

1926
01:00:44,820 --> 01:00:46,660
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us

 we can be found on our Twitter accounts.

1930
01:00:50,820 --> 01:00:52,860
 I'm on @Sriberland, James--
