00:00:00,00:00:03,"Hi guys, just before we start this show, we wanted to let you know we've got a really"
00:00:03,00:00:06,exciting guest on today. We were really looking forward to recording with this person.
00:00:06,00:00:12,"It's a new, up and coming comic and creative talent called Stephen Fry."
00:00:12,00:00:19,"Yeah. I've not heard of him. Well, I think you will have in a couple of years. He's new on the scene."
00:00:19,00:00:23,"Cool. Okay. Well, that's very exciting. And he has this new book out, which is called Heroes."
00:00:23,00:00:28,"It's a fantastic book. It's all about the Greek heroes. So Jason and Hercules,"
00:00:28,00:00:35,"slash Hercules and Pegasus, all these familiar characters, but written in the incredible comic"
00:00:35,00:00:40,wit and stylings of Stephen Fry. It's really funny. It's fantastic for kids. And if you're an
00:00:40,00:00:45,"adult who just wants to revisit these stories, I highly recommend it. There you go. That's Heroes"
00:00:45,00:00:51,by Stephen Fry. And then please do also buy book of the year by us. And we should just say this
00:00:51,00:00:55,is a special extended version of the podcast because Stephen had so much to say and we wanted to
00:00:55,00:01:00,hear it. We figured you guys would want to hear it. And so enjoy this episode of no such
00:01:00,00:01:03,things a fish plus. Okay. On with the show.
00:01:03,00:01:23,"Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast coming to you"
00:01:23,00:01:29,"from the QI offices in Covenant Garden. My name is Dan Schreiber. I am sitting here with Anica Zinsky,"
00:01:29,00:01:34,"Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkend, and a special guest. And the man who gave us the name,"
00:01:34,00:01:39,"the QI Elbs. It's Stephen Fry. And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our"
00:01:39,00:01:44,"four favorite facts from the last seven days. And in no particular order, here we go. Starting with"
00:01:44,00:01:49,"you, Stephen. All right. Yes, I have a fact here. There was a make of toilet paper in Victorian"
00:01:49,00:01:56,"England that was so posh every sheet had a watermark to deter counterfeited. Actually, it was so posh,"
00:01:56,00:02:00,"it wouldn't have been called toilet paper. It would have been called lavatory paper. If you remember,"
00:02:00,00:02:05,"toilet is deeply non-use. As is the word posh. So in fact, it was probably make of lavatory paper that"
00:02:05,00:02:10,"was so classy with every sheet had a watermark. But anyway, that's the point. And what does that"
00:02:10,00:02:15,"tell us about Victorians and Bathroom Habits? I wonder the revolutionary custom. Well, this was"
00:02:15,00:02:21,"on the first toilet papers or lavatory papers, wasn't it? Yeah. What was used before that then? Well,"
00:02:21,00:02:25,"there is. We know all the stories of, you know, swans necks and goose necks. Yeah, corncops,"
00:02:25,00:02:31,"I think we mentioned before. Yeah. I just wondered what, so for example, this is in the 19th century."
00:02:31,00:02:37,"So this was well after, for example, Jane Austen died. So what are the regency gentry? Or just"
00:02:37,00:02:42,"the middle classes? I mean, I can't imagine Jane Austen using a corn cob is all I'm trying to say."
00:02:42,00:02:49,"The way they're called Dolly. I know the French used lace, which is weird because it got holes in it,"
00:02:49,00:02:54,"but apparently they did. I know that in many Middle Eastern customers, the hand was always used and"
00:02:54,00:03:00,"that's why you don't use the cacan literally the shithand if they may say so. Yeah, cacan did,"
00:03:00,00:03:06,and it's interesting. I don't know many people have watched Peter Jackson's reconstruction
00:03:06,00:03:10,"of, you know, recalorisation of some of that extraordinary museum. First of all, war footage and they"
00:03:10,00:03:16,may remember seeing those men perched on a bar having a poo with their bottoms sort of hanging over. Yes.
00:03:16,00:03:21,"It's a reminded one, obviously, of the very everyday nature of war includes naturally, the very"
00:03:21,00:03:28,everyday nature of emptying the barrels. And there I think one of the comments was from a veteran
00:03:28,00:03:34,speaking that there was no paper. So our grandfathers and great-grandfathers who thought in that war
00:03:34,00:03:38,and survived would have all had that same experience. Yeah. And we don't talk about it. Was the
00:03:38,00:03:44,"wipers times? Was that? That's a good point. Yeah. That wasn't signford. It wasn't. No, it was just a"
00:03:44,00:03:49,"classic Tommy mispronunciation of Ibrahim. Oh, it's not that. Did you think that? I thought you"
00:03:49,00:03:54,"would read it and then wipe your butt. Well, that will be a full lot of me as they say. But a very"
00:03:54,00:03:59,"happy one. Yeah. So there is a first world war toilet paper fact, which is that both sides printed"
00:03:59,00:04:07,toilet paper with propaganda on it. So the Germans issued sheets with a series of lying reports
00:04:07,00:04:11,by our enemies. And British manufacturers did the same thing. And swap them on the other side.
00:04:11,00:04:16,"No, just for you to wipe your bottom with British propaganda. And I don't offer a fact. Because you"
00:04:16,00:04:20,"know when we're young and I don't suppose cartoonists still do, but escaping prisoners always used"
00:04:20,00:04:26,"to have suits with arrows on them. Yeah. Government property arrows. Well, when I was a young"
00:04:26,00:04:31,"and unfortunate criminal convicted and inside a prison, the laboratory paper there was in those"
00:04:31,00:04:37,"sort of boxes where there are other crispy leaves intertwined and interleaved, in fact. And they had"
00:04:37,00:04:43,those arrows on. As did the cigarette rolling papers that's got from the shop. But we all had those
00:04:43,00:04:48,arrows. Surely prisons only plus the arrows. Wouldn't that take some when you left for the
00:04:48,00:04:51,"finger? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. I'll show you Daniel Bird. Yeah. Yeah."
00:04:51,00:04:59,"American, they get like little tattoos, don't they, to show what they've done. Yes, if you just"
00:04:59,00:05:04,"have a piece of arrow of time paper, it's the same job. Well, have we mentioned that they used to,"
00:05:04,00:05:10,"so before toilet paper was invented, they used to wipe their bombs on the Farmer's Almaniac,"
00:05:10,00:05:15,"didn't they, in America famously. And the Sears catalogue, and they both used to come with a hole"
00:05:15,00:05:20,in them so you could hang it up and then use it as lurals. Yeah. And I was actually listening to a
00:05:20,00:05:26,"podcast, which was saying there are two reasons that suddenly lural was necessary and was taken on."
00:05:26,00:05:30,"One was that we invented plumbing, so suddenly you can't flush a corner on the cob down the"
00:05:30,00:05:35,"loo. And the other was the Sears catalogue started coming laminated, started coming with glossy,"
00:05:35,00:05:39,"glossy paper. Oh, right. It didn't work at all. Yeah, it was absorbing, but not absorbing."
00:05:39,00:05:46,"The important distinction. I find white troze food illustrated, very uncomfortable every month."
00:05:46,00:05:53,But this does bring us to a sensitive point about the wiping bottoms. Most people never
00:05:53,00:05:58,"taught her to wipe the bottom. I assume unless there's some memory of a mother during potty training,"
00:05:58,00:06:02,actually explaining it. But there was a new story just the other day about the fact that women are
00:06:02,00:06:06,being told how to wipe their bottoms. And some people on social media were very angry at being told.
00:06:06,00:06:14,"But the answer is, and you know, this is all too distressing to hear. But that forwards to back"
00:06:14,00:06:20,"is the correct female way. It's as a woman, you just are told that. You chant it, practically."
00:06:21,00:06:26,"I think I'm right in saying, guys, we don't do that. Do we? I get the other way. Exactly."
00:06:26,00:06:31,"You go back to... But it doesn't matter for you, obviously. No, we don't have the other, the little..."
00:06:31,00:06:34,You'd have to really miss your target and get it up your way through.
00:06:34,00:06:43,"Frank can open about this. Absolutely. So it's a health issue for women, obviously."
00:06:43,00:06:46,"I'm so glad you're here, Steve. I'm sorry. I'm sorry."
00:06:49,00:06:54,"We go and we go on. But it's interesting. We say, bringing the levels up and everything,"
00:06:54,00:06:59,"to an alien species looking at us, why they would be very puzzled at the fact that we have these very"
00:06:59,00:07:06,"normal and necessary actions that are part of every day, like eating and drinking and having a"
00:07:06,00:07:11,"pony and a pea. And indeed, making love in order to whatever whole cohesion or whatever"
00:07:11,00:07:15,"one wants to go, in order to propagate the species. And those are the very things that have the taboos."
00:07:16,00:07:22,"Whereas murder and cruelty, we can use those words we can tell us in the traffic was acting as cruel."
00:07:22,00:07:27,"Oh god, it was murder. Is it my hand? Murder kills people. That's the thing we should have a taboo of"
00:07:27,00:07:31,"murder. Whereas if you say it was shitting bad traffic, we could do swear."
00:07:31,00:07:40,Which frame of reference is the dangerous one? Not the pooing. So I'm sure to the very useful
00:07:40,00:07:46,Martian watching that this should teach us something about how completely screwed up we are. It's so wrong to
00:07:46,00:07:52,"be obsessed. Well, I think wasn't the people who invented Lew Roll on a role for the first time,"
00:07:52,00:07:57,"in fact, invented it in the 1890s and 1890s, I think. And they didn't admit to it. And they did it"
00:07:57,00:08:02,under a shell company. They only admitted to it in 1902 because it was such a shameful thing to
00:08:02,00:08:11,"have invented. I met someone who worked for Dalton, the porcelain company, in Staffordshire. And I asked"
00:08:11,00:08:15,"Mr. Parsley and I said, ""Oh, is a picture he did Staffordshire dogs or something in the governmental"
00:08:15,00:08:19,"pieces?"" You know, and I said, ""There are all the mental things."" I said, ""What sort of things do you"
00:08:19,00:08:25,"specialize in?"" He said, ""Mother Quiley, heavy wear."" I didn't quite know what heavy wear was. And I said,"
00:08:25,00:08:31,"""It worked out what he meant was bathrooms and lavatories."" It was heavy wear. The proper porcelain."
00:08:31,00:08:38,"Really? Just speaking of the late 1800s and which way to wipe, I saw the patent for the first toilet"
00:08:38,00:08:44,roll. And it sort of answers the question of which way you meant to hang the roll. Does the paper come
00:08:44,00:08:49,"down underneath or does it go over? So which do you think it is? Well, I was thought forward, so you"
00:08:49,00:08:53,"can grab it and that's the way hotels do it because they do a little coy, provocative peek."
00:08:53,00:09:01,Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. That's correct. It's that way in the patent. It's not a great question.
00:09:01,00:09:07,But the thing about the little peek is supposed to be having works in a hotel. It's so that the
00:09:07,00:09:12,housekeepers can tell if the room has been serviced. So it's the last thing they do. And so if that's
00:09:12,00:09:17,"done, it means they know that it's fine. So if I was a housekeeper, I'd just do that. Do the rooms"
00:09:17,00:09:23,very quickly. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. So if they got in and they saw that there were sort of one
00:09:23,00:09:28,"towel position and then all men say, well, that could have just been the person staying here. Let me"
00:09:28,00:09:33,"check the bathroom. So there was a, sorry, no, I'm just thinking so. Yes, the first company to make"
00:09:33,00:09:39,"Lurel disclaimed it or hid it. I wonder when it was first advertised them, when it was first allowed"
00:09:39,00:09:44,into magazines and then into television. We all familiar with Andrex and his puppy and everything.
00:09:44,00:09:50,And I'm old enough to remember the Hullabaloo when it was allowed to have female sanitary
00:09:50,00:09:55,products as they call them advertised on TV. And everyone said that was the beginning of the end.
00:09:55,00:09:58,It's disgusting. I don't see that. But presumably there may have been a similar moment when
00:09:58,00:10:03,"Leverty paper was first advertised. Yeah. Well, but there's only you never, you still never see"
00:10:03,00:10:07,"Lurel paper or sanitary pads with the thing on them that they're supposed to clear up. I mean,"
00:10:07,00:10:12,I wonder if men think that we have blue periods. Because the only thing you see is a drop of blue
00:10:12,00:10:17,"That's only Picasso has a blue period. There is one that says for your bum, this isn't there."
00:10:17,00:10:22,"There was one that has a, but yes, I thought, remember my friend, you and I, we wanted to do"
00:10:22,00:10:27,"women in, when we were heavy voiceover, performance in the 80s and doing all kinds of"
00:10:27,00:10:31,"adverts and things. We thought, why don't they do that? Be brilliant. Wipes your bottom"
00:10:31,00:10:37,beautifully. That was all you need. It just wipes your bottom. Brilliant. So this company is Scots who
00:10:37,00:10:41,did this Lurel and they couldn't advertise. I know that much at least. And they sold it under the
00:10:41,00:10:45,"counter in the chemists. So you'd have to go in and they would just kind of, they would even put it"
00:10:45,00:10:49,"on the shelf. Technically, actually, it should have been placed over the counter according to the"
00:10:49,00:10:54,"patent. Yeah. And the outside Lurel would be a string with, with newspaper news. You say the holes"
00:10:54,00:11:01,"in the CSCenter. Yeah. I found a man, this is a two years ago, this is in 2016, it was a man who"
00:11:01,00:11:06,was fined in court after paying for a takeaway with a ten pound note that he had printed onto
00:11:06,00:11:14,some toilet paper. It's incredible cut spa. He used this computer and he just used the desktop
00:11:14,00:11:19,computer and a normal printer and he just put the Lurel into the printer. Wow. His defence
00:11:19,00:11:23,"barrister said, this is going to be the most expensive takeaway of Mr Coban's life."
00:11:23,00:11:30,"Is the great achievement of Peter Bezlegett and not Peter, but is it Joseph? I mean, don't know,"
00:11:30,00:11:35,is the great achievement of Joseph Bezlegett to be undone by the arrival of Moist laboratory
00:11:35,00:11:40,"because this seems to be now considered unflashable and the interview everybody uses it, a lot of"
00:11:40,00:11:46,"people use it. Yes. Yeah. And there was a report just recently saying there is, they did tests,"
00:11:46,00:11:54,there is no style of moist paper or wipe that is suitable for our sewers without creating
00:11:54,00:12:01,"blocks that cost millions. The fat birds, yeah. Everything has a, everything costs a shadow in this"
00:12:01,00:12:07,"world. There is no such thing as a free lunch, there is a free bottom wipe. It's got it somewhere,"
00:12:07,00:12:11,isn't it? It was the number one cause I think they found of those big fat birds that they were
00:12:11,00:12:17,"finding in the sewers. As in, if you took percentages of what made it up, the fat, the wet wipes,"
00:12:17,00:12:22,"which were largely I think more for babies than they are for adults, for cleaning nappies,"
00:12:22,00:12:27,that's what they found. And I read that we basically have KFC to blame for that. Colonel Sanders
00:12:27,00:12:31,"is the person who took the wet wipe and first introduced it into restaurants, and that's spread"
00:12:31,00:12:38,"around the world. Yeah. So before we were, I think that's what you make. Another voice over is"
00:12:38,00:12:45,coming back to you. They do make sense though. I mean it is bizarre and I think people in other countries
00:12:45,00:12:52,think we're bizarre that we use dry paper to get rid of that when it makes no sense not to apply
00:12:52,00:12:56,water. I mean we wash our hands if we think there might be one bacteria on it and we cover our
00:12:56,00:13:03,"bottoms with it. Forward the B day. Yes. It will indeed. Yeah. The answer but no one has room for a B day,"
00:13:03,00:13:07,but what they do have room for and these becoming more and more popular. A little installation. So
00:13:07,00:13:13,it's a now quite cheap of a Japanese style. You know the kind of thing. Yes. If you join into your
00:13:13,00:13:19,"plumbing, it's a seat and you have a remote control and you press buttons and it oscillates a jet"
00:13:19,00:13:26,up the jacksy and it has a female setting and a male setting and it can also offer hot air to
00:13:26,00:13:32,dry zero madams backside. And these are becoming more and more popular and consider very healthy and
00:13:32,00:13:36,of course there is nothing goes into the sewer except once you've dropped in there in nature's way.
00:13:36,00:13:41,So there is obviously it costs energy because they're electric. Yeah. But those are going to be
00:13:41,00:13:47,more and more popular. It's so funny you're just because your voice is so perfect for talking
00:13:47,00:13:50,and selling things as you did that. I thought your voice would be fantastic for that with
00:13:50,00:13:57,Sarah or Madame enjoy a jet up the jacksy. There's a great story about one of my heroes one of my
00:13:57,00:14:01,cinematic heroes as well. Many people's cinematic here a billy wilder of the great. Oh yeah.
00:14:01,00:14:07,"Director, you know, some like it hot. Yeah. Some sort of a boulevard, whatever. Many many great films"
00:14:07,00:14:13,and I think he was in Paris with Marilyn Monroe and Tony Curtis and Jack lemon and trying to keep
00:14:13,00:14:17,control particularly of Tony Curtis and Marilyn Monroe and his wife Audrey who might met
00:14:17,00:14:23,"fun enough. She told me this story was true. Had said to him, honey, I want you when you're in Paris"
00:14:23,00:14:30,to get a proper Parisian bidet because the you know the wall cuts have got one or whoever it was.
00:14:30,00:14:35,Some family that she sort of keeping up with the Jonesed with and she felt that they wanted and he
00:14:35,00:14:40,"said sure, honey, I get you. I get you don't problem. Anyway, he was so busy. He was so busy in Paris"
00:14:40,00:14:44,that he just didn't get hold of it and he didn't even have time to look at a plumbing supply shop and
00:14:44,00:14:51,have a bidet shipped over from Paris to Beverly Hills and on in the car on the way to
00:14:51,00:14:57,Wassie or whatever the airport was then in Paris. He suddenly remembered and he stopped off
00:14:57,00:15:06,at a bureau de post to send a telegram to prepare for disappointments and honey tried everywhere
00:15:06,00:15:20,no bidets in Paris suggest doing handstand in shower. I love bidet which you might all know this but
00:15:20,00:15:26,"is named after a small extinct donkey or horse. How did you know it? Yeah, so bidet is French for"
00:15:26,00:15:32,this species of small horse and so small that the idea is with a bidet you'd be straddling it like
00:15:32,00:15:37,"like this little wing. Was it a real animal? Yeah, it's a real animal. In Italian the word for bidet"
00:15:37,00:15:43,"translates as hygienic little horse. Same thing, yeah. But I didn't think it was based on an"
00:15:43,00:15:54,"extinct real animal which people rode to clean. No, no, no, no, no, no. No, like a burrito looks like"
00:15:54,00:15:58,a little donkey but it doesn't mean people eat donkeys in the way they are burritos. Got tide
00:15:58,00:16:03,travelers when you go back open the toilet there's a corn of coal and there's a donkey. What am I
00:16:03,00:16:10,meant to do here? There's toilet paper that we were talking about the main facts. It was shown
00:16:10,00:16:17,at the 1878 Paris exposition and it won the highest prize. So it was seen as such an innovation
00:16:17,00:16:25,"in anti-counterfeasing, in actual quality of lavatory loo roll. So the watermark was the maker of"
00:16:25,00:16:30,"the, it wasn't that you could have it in your own family crest. It was the, it was the watermark of"
00:16:30,00:16:34,"the manufacturer of the roll. Promo, that's right. Promo, exactly, yeah. And that's where they were,"
00:16:34,00:16:38,"right? Yeah, yeah. And there's the best they made. They must, they had amazing inventions in the"
00:16:38,00:16:43,"Victorian era. Do you know the travelator I think was there? Sometimes it's, yeah. Sometimes it's"
00:16:43,00:16:47,"the simplest of their actions that are the best though, isn't it? You're right. We do still all use"
00:16:47,00:16:50,"loo rolls. Yeah, we don't use it. There was a period when they were, they called themselves"
00:16:50,00:16:56,"'medicated', which is a suspect not a legally enforceable meaning for word. But IZile"
00:16:56,00:17:01,"medicated, we had at my crept school, which was the hideously tissy we wanted, and Bronco,"
00:17:01,00:17:08,"they claimed to be medicated, what they were medicated with, I don't know. The first package"
00:17:08,00:17:13,"toilet paper was made by Gayati, Joseph Gayati, and he called it the therapeutic paper."
00:17:13,00:17:19,"Somewhat it named after Queen Victoria. What an honor. Victorian brands of toilet paper, I just"
00:17:19,00:17:24,"found a list of a few, and they included things like Baldog and Sampson and Virilla. That is great."
00:17:24,00:17:30,"But there were also others called Victoria and Queen and Gloria Victus. Good, it was close. Yeah."
00:17:30,00:17:36,"Can I tell you about one, because this is a Victorian invention. Oh yeah. And a Victorian"
00:17:36,00:17:41,"invention that actually was made that I had never heard of before, but bifocals for horses."
00:17:42,00:17:49,"And they got these. So this was in the 1880s, 1887. Someone went into a pharmacy and said,"
00:17:49,00:17:56,"""My horse has gone shortsighted, I'm a cab driver."" But the thing is, he likes to read the paper, so..."
00:17:56,00:18:02,"Wake up, walking into things. He's not getting as many tips as he used to. And it was actually"
00:18:02,00:18:06,"tried out, and there are pictures of this horse. There are photographs of this horse wearing"
00:18:06,00:18:11,"these bifocals, which apparently it didn't like at first, but then it refused to go without them."
00:18:12,00:18:16,"And it got taken up by a handsome cab driver's, because what they actually did was"
00:18:16,00:18:20,"make the road seem like it was rising up in the horse's face, and so they used to pick up their"
00:18:20,00:18:28,"hooves much higher. And that looked, you know, that was my posh. So they started burying them."
00:18:28,00:18:33,"So that actually happened? My focals, as we know, were invented by Benjamin Franklin, weren't they?"
00:18:33,00:18:42,"Oh, yes, yes. But not quite one. That's rather interesting. Another bit of a bizarre invention from the"
00:18:42,00:18:47,"Victorian times. They used to, if you went to a pub or any kind of restaurant, the opposite of today,"
00:18:47,00:18:52,"smoking, the smell of smoke was actively encouraged, and it made the place feel like somewhere you"
00:18:52,00:18:56,"wanted to be, somewhere that was happening. So a lot of problem was, if a restaurant started"
00:18:56,00:19:02,"its day, it was not full of smoke. So someone invented an automatic smoking machine. The machine"
00:19:02,00:19:06,"would have lip cigarettes, sort of bellows, exactly, and it would come out. And so the idea is that it"
00:19:06,00:19:11,"would sort of cover the restaurant in this mist of smoke. And you go, oh, it can go off. Fantastic."
00:19:11,00:19:16,What happening? What a happening restaurant. Wow. Do we know if that got made?
00:19:16,00:19:20,"No, I mean, it got made, but I don't know if it was six, I don't know if they made more than one."
00:19:20,00:19:24,"Oh, but they made a model of it. That is amazing. They used to have competitive smoking and"
00:19:24,00:19:30,"pubs in the UK in the early 20th century. Yeah, and you would have a pipe and you'd have to keep it."
00:19:30,00:19:34,"Oh, yes, that went on way, way into my lifetime. Oh, yeah. To keep it in America, they had it to,"
00:19:34,00:19:39,"yeah, everyone had an identical clay pipe. The whole point was it had to be sort of controlled,"
00:19:39,00:19:46,"a clay pipe, an identical quantity of pipe tobacco. And it was their job to light it and keep it"
00:19:46,00:19:51,"going for as long as possible and staggering along. You know, you or I would have just kind of"
00:19:51,00:19:55,"gone out in seconds, but they could keep it going for hours and hours, putting their fingers"
00:19:55,00:20:03,"over the top of the bowl and just load. It's lost art. It is. I was the very last pipe smoker of the year,"
00:20:03,00:20:10,"ever. Oh, yes, yes. So it used to be a very popular thing every year. It was a big dinner at the"
00:20:10,00:20:15,"Savoy Hotel, sponsored by Alfred Dunhill, who in those days were primarily tobacco nests."
00:20:15,00:20:20,"Yeah, our fashion house, of course. But their shop in Germain Street was filled with huge jars of"
00:20:20,00:20:27,tobacco. And they would call them your sort. Snuff and tobacco were called a sort. So you'd hear
00:20:27,00:20:31,"someone come in and they go, ""Hello, you're gracious."" ""Oh, sorry, come in."" ""Have you got any of my sort in?"""
00:20:31,00:20:37,So it would be a mixture of Cavendish and these strange names that these particular types of
00:20:37,00:20:48,"tobacco had. And anyway, it was actually QI. It was the very first QI. I agreed to do an interview"
00:20:48,00:20:55,"for the independent, I think it was, to publicise QI as a new programme. And I went to the Gratio Club,"
00:20:55,00:21:01,and at the time I had decided to try and cut down cigarette smoking. But I always carried a pipe
00:21:01,00:21:06,"with me. I always loved smoking, but the first pipe of the day I really enjoyed. So I had a pipe,"
00:21:06,00:21:11,"and I really felt like smoking and in those days you could smoke anywhere. And so I let the pipe,"
00:21:11,00:21:14,"and the photographer was taking pictures on me, and it was on the front of the independent"
00:21:14,00:21:20,"that next day, or whatever, the following week. And immediately I got a letter from the pipe smoking."
00:21:20,00:21:28,"So it's a desperate thing. Finally, because the old days they had Harold Wilson and Eric Morker,"
00:21:28,00:21:32,and all these kind of people who'd be the pipe smokers of the year. But it was running thin on the
00:21:32,00:21:39,"ground, and Russ Aberton. And finally, they said, ""Well, I don't really regularly smoke."" And"
00:21:39,00:21:43,"they made me a special pipe, which I still have, which is in the shape of a BBC microphone."
00:21:43,00:21:48,"You can disassemble it like the man with a golden gun, and he's a very apparatus, and turn"
00:21:48,00:21:54,"into a pipe. And it was really, really fun. Are you technically the reigning? I am."
00:21:54,00:22:02,"Yeah, I think they gave a very special lifetime pipe award to the comedy writer Lawrence Marx,"
00:22:02,00:22:07,"who was also on the board of the pipe smoking association. And obviously we all deprecate smoking now,"
00:22:07,00:22:13,"and I don't smoke anymore, and I haven't for 12 years, I think it is. But I sometimes think,"
00:22:13,00:22:16,"you know, when I had a bit of a cancer scare the earlier this year, I kind of think,"
00:22:16,00:22:22,"when I got my death sentence, I would probably just order a pipe online, and a great, you know,"
00:22:22,00:22:29,"big, great vat of tobacco, and just carry on again. But I probably wouldn't actually,"
00:22:29,00:22:34,"I mean, it probably tastes horrible in my mouth, but it is a memory of that. But I'm old enough to"
00:22:34,00:22:39,"remember smoking cinema, smoking the tube, smoking buses, smoking absolutely everywhere,"
00:22:39,00:22:45,"even in church. You know, their grand families had their box pews with brass, brass,"
00:22:45,00:22:50,"off trays, so they were in the square, and they had a cigar, obviously, to the sermon. But it was"
00:22:50,00:22:55,"short, it was really, I mean, apart from pipes, you know, with a wall to rally, it was really"
00:22:55,00:22:59,"Oscar Wilde's generation that made cigarettes popular, and they were considered very decadent"
00:22:59,00:23:04,"and extraordinary. And that was in the 1890s, but by 15 years later, virtually old, 20 years later,"
00:23:04,00:23:09,"it was the middle of the first world war. Everyone did it. I mean, it was just everybody."
00:23:09,00:23:13,"But if we've only had about a century of it, basically. And now, of course, it looks weird,"
00:23:13,00:23:18,"if you keep doing it in, you know, like, again, that Peter Jackson thing, you just saw all those"
00:23:18,00:23:22,"Thomas smoking away. I love those things, which it's like, throughout all of history, no one"
00:23:22,00:23:27,"smoked, and then for 100 years, everyone smoked, and then for the rest of time, no one will smoke"
00:23:27,00:23:32,"again, so it's just, even though to us, it's a normal thing. It's completely unusual in the"
00:23:32,00:23:37,"history of, there's that amazing moment as well, that America experienced, and it's covered in a"
00:23:37,00:23:41,"Adam Curtis documentary, Power of Nightmares, I think, that the documentary is called, and the idea"
00:23:41,00:23:46,"was that they realized in America that it was only men smoking, and they needed women to smoke as well."
00:23:46,00:23:50,"Oh, just Freud's brother in law, isn't it? Yes, it is. Yeah, and the idea was that they empowered"
00:23:50,00:23:55,"the women of America to start smoking, saying that they were something like sticks of freedom,"
00:23:55,00:24:01,"or liberty, liberty of torches, the very first photograph of them, he paid for them to walk down Fifth"
00:24:01,00:24:06,"Avenue with cigarettes, yes, to very famous picture. I think, yes, it's the same member of the Freud"
00:24:06,00:24:14,"family who invented bacon and eggs, but he was the father of the advertising. The father of healthy"
00:24:22,00:24:28,"okay, it's time for fact number two, and that is Andy. My fact is that in 1972, a Canadian DJ held a"
00:24:28,00:24:34,"contest to choose a Canadian national simile, like as American as apple pie. The winning entry was,"
00:24:34,00:24:42,as Canadian as possible under the circumstances. So they don't know what similes are for us.
00:24:42,00:24:50,"Yeah, this was a DJ called Peter Zasky, and he was a great Canadian broadcaster and he"
00:24:50,00:24:57,"hosted shows for decades, and lots of aspects of Canadian life he analysed and examined, and he"
00:24:57,00:25:03,"hosted this competition. A 17-year-old student came up with that slogan as Canadian as possible,"
00:25:03,00:25:10,"and weirdly, Zasky, he just speaking about smoking, he won throws an essay called How to Quit Smoking"
00:25:10,00:25:19,"in 50 Years or Less. Brilliant, I like it. Yeah, humorists and Canada, lots of those. Do you believe"
00:25:19,00:25:23,"me? Of course, he was writing humorists, but all those comedians like Dan Atcroyden,"
00:25:23,00:25:28,"they were honest, and there were so many of them. Yeah, they have an unfair reputation, don't they,"
00:25:28,00:25:34,"for being dull, given that I'm not saying I believe that it is a reputation they have."
00:25:34,00:25:39,"Is it? I think nice, but a bit dull. I remember when I first went to Toronto,"
00:25:39,00:25:44,"years and years and years ago, and I called up my friend and colleague, we were working together,"
00:25:44,00:25:48,"all the time then, Hugh Laurie, and he had never been at that point too. And he asked what it was like,"
00:25:48,00:25:56,"I said, I think probably I can best describe how Toronto is by saying that I asked the front desk,"
00:25:56,00:26:01,"you know, what attractions they were to see, and they said, well, there's a the Bali Footwear Museum,"
00:26:01,00:26:08,"and we laughed at that, and then two days later I said, I can give you a clearer idea of Toronto now."
00:26:08,00:26:15,"I had nothing better to do than go to Bali Footwear Museum, but in fairness to Toronto,"
00:26:15,00:26:22,"it is improved enormously, that's what God said. The museum or the whole city, one the world series,"
00:26:22,00:26:27,"twice in a row, the Blue Jays, and it became a, you know, and now it's, yeah, it's pretty,"
00:26:27,00:26:31,"I just spent three months in Niagara on the Lake, which is beautiful. Oh, wow."
00:26:31,00:26:38,"Just on the right on the American border. Oh, really? And that was stunning. And they are very"
00:26:38,00:26:44,"aware of how the world looks at them, and they know that they're a bit overflight and a bit of work,"
00:26:44,00:26:49,"I was, you know, and do you find, they are actually factually like that, aren't they? I mean, there was a study"
00:26:49,00:26:54,"done looking at people's Twitter feeds, and it was only comparing American and Canadian Twitter feeds,"
00:26:54,00:26:59,"but the preponderance of words on American Twitter feeds were negative things, so like,"
00:26:59,00:27:03,"hate and damn and bored and annoying, and then on Canadian feeds, they're all just saying words"
00:27:03,00:27:09,"like favourite and gorgeous. Who even says gorgeous anymore? Great, amazing. In Ontario, they have"
00:27:09,00:27:15,"the Apology Act that came in in 2009, and that's because people apologise all the time, and then"
00:27:15,00:27:19,"law now is that an apology is not allowed to be considered an admission of guilt, because what would"
00:27:19,00:27:24,"happen is you'd have a little car crash or something, and they go, sorry, sorry, and they go, well, he said,"
00:27:24,00:27:28,"sorry, that's the admission of liability, and of course it is, it is just a natural instinct. That's"
00:27:28,00:27:34,"so good. Just on the boredom thing, there is a town in Canada called Ocatokes. I don't,"
00:27:34,00:27:42,"has anyone been? No, no. Well, they had a Taurus slogan, and it was, there are a number of things to do"
00:27:42,00:27:54,in Ocatokes. Very nice. And that number is zero. My friend John Sessions did his post-graduate
00:27:54,00:28:02,"doctorate at University in Canada, and he waxes very, very miracle on his contempt for some of the more"
00:28:02,00:28:08,"dull sides of it. Back then, in the 80s, I guess, or in the 80s, even in his case. And I happened to be in"
00:28:08,00:28:13,"Oxford at the Oxford, I was filming there, and there's the Oxford University press shop on the"
00:28:13,00:28:23,"high or the broader one. And I was ordering the new Oxford English Dictionary, the second edition"
00:28:23,00:28:30,"of the whole thing, and there was a special price for a early buyer of it, and it wasn't in the shop,"
00:28:30,00:28:35,"it was in the depository in Northampton, and they would send it to any address, and it was, I didn't"
00:28:35,00:28:40,"know, £1200 or something. It's a huge number of volumes of this massive dictionary, and I was terribly"
00:28:40,00:28:44,"pleased with it, and then I was looking around, and I saw one of those Oxford books, you know,"
00:28:44,00:28:50,"you have Oxford books of the quotations, and so on. This was the Oxford book of Canadian political"
00:28:50,00:28:59,anecdotes. And I thought I must understand John Sessions in the scene. How could you fill a book with
00:28:59,00:29:04,"Canadians? Anyway, I thought it was the most amazing, so I took it up to the front of the desk,"
00:29:04,00:29:09,"and then who should come into the shop? Jeremy Paxman, who's been across the road at All Souls,"
00:29:09,00:29:14,"having a lunch, because he was doing a book on the British establishment. So we what hoed and said"
00:29:14,00:29:19,"her though, and I sort of vague the new, and I said, look at this book I've got here, it's the Oxford"
00:29:19,00:29:24,"book of Canadian political anecdotes, and he said, and then the assistant behind the desk said,"
00:29:24,00:29:34,"that'll be 1217 hours. And Jeremy Paxman could only see that book. And I said, oh yes, very"
00:29:34,00:29:39,"rare book. I mean, Canadian political anecdotes, Jeremy, come on. And he was like, I can't"
00:29:39,00:29:46,"bad. And the assistant bless him, he joined in, said, oh yes, yes, very, very rare. So I signed it,"
00:29:46,00:29:51,"and Paxman went off pulling and he said, doing all those Paxmony books, sort of expressions,"
00:29:51,00:29:57,"and then it wasn't until two years later, I was filming again in Oxford, and I'd been asked to do"
00:29:57,00:30:03,"this spectator diary, you know. And so I told that story in the spectator diary, and about two days later,"
00:30:03,00:30:09,"I got this furious letter from Jeremy Paxman, I have been dining out. How mad you are. I know I'd"
00:30:09,00:30:19,"discover. There's something else Canadians are very well known for, is saying A, are you all right,"
00:30:19,00:30:24,"it's nice weather today, A, but not in that accent, in a Canadian accent. The Canadian alphabet A,"
00:30:24,00:30:34,"exactly. So the University of British Columbia has an official A lab, which is, it's their syntax"
00:30:34,00:30:37,"of speech lab, it's where you go, if you want to study the linguistics of that kind of thing,"
00:30:37,00:30:44,"and it's called the A lab. Oh, very good. Yes, and I think it's first, so it goes back a long time,"
00:30:44,00:30:51,"it goes back to before Canada was a country at all, so 1773, it appeared in an Irish play,"
00:30:51,00:30:56,"and you know Irish people went to Canada, and then it appeared in a book in the 1830s that was"
00:30:56,00:31:01,"completely littered with it. But yeah, it's real wise, they might do that. So I think there's"
00:31:01,00:31:07,"been a suggestion that there is a small bit of England where there's a similar inflection,"
00:31:07,00:31:11,"and I can't remember where it is actually, but people took it from there. Because the accent is not"
00:31:11,00:31:17,"dissimilar as it creeps over the border into Wisconsin, and North Dakota, you think, that movie Fargo,"
00:31:17,00:31:21,"and the wonderful Frances McDormand performance of there, who got a question here, police work there,"
00:31:21,00:31:27,"kind of it's got that similar kind of slight, and there the reason is supposedly the Scandal"
00:31:27,00:31:33,"region input into Wisconsin, and they're all called Sorenson, in favour of the Bill Macy County,"
00:31:33,00:31:38,"it's called Gunderson, I think, isn't it? They've all got names like that. It's just the size of the"
00:31:38,00:31:45,"place. I think America's big, but Canada fans out into a greater width than up into the Arctic Circle."
00:31:45,00:31:50,"There's a great story, isn't there? So it's like a gap year where a woman writes to her sister,"
00:31:50,00:31:57,"who's Canadian, and says, ""My son, your nephew's got his gap year, and he's he'd be landing in Newfoundland,"
00:31:57,00:32:04,"well, if you could pick him up, and her sister lived in British Columbia."" So she sent her"
00:32:04,00:32:11,"a reply back saying, ""Why do you, your nearer?"" ""We are nearer here in Britain to that coast,"
00:32:11,00:32:20,"and we're all so good."" I was reading about Lumberjack's classic, Canadian. I love that a female Lumberjack"
00:32:20,00:32:26,"is a Lumberjil, I think that's a lovely term, but I've discovered there's a thing they, the clothing,"
00:32:26,00:32:30,"I was reading about their clothing, and there have been Lumberjack trousers invented, which I've"
00:32:30,00:32:36,"never seen before, and the idea is that they are chainsaw proof. You can't chainsaw through them,"
00:32:36,00:32:41,"and there are videos on YouTube of Lumberjack's showing you, and they all start the video by going,"
00:32:41,00:32:44,"""Do not do this at home, do not do this at home, do not do this at home."" And they"
00:32:44,00:32:48,"rev it up, and the chainsaw gets going, and they just slam it down onto their trousers,"
00:32:48,00:32:53,"and the fabric, it's eight layers of a plastic that are, there's a whole science video you can"
00:32:53,00:32:57,"watch about the beauty of the science of how it works, and you can watch it and immediately get"
00:32:57,00:33:04,"chewed up in the trousers, and store the chainsaw immediately. It's extraordinary, and"
00:33:04,00:33:09,"scary, in the first person to try it. And yet, it can set a dream. Yes, exactly."
00:33:09,00:33:13,"You have imagined a fact that you were going out, and you're also Lumberjack wife, and put out your"
00:33:13,00:33:18,"other pair of trousers that morning, just off to do my filming, honey. Oh, great, have fun!"
00:33:18,00:33:24,"So, I was looking up other slogans in Canada, and place name slogans,"
00:33:25,00:33:30,"so Ottawa launched a new slogan in 2001, and the slogan was, ""Technically beautiful."""
00:33:30,00:33:44,"What they were trying to say is that it's technologically advanced, it's great,"
00:33:44,00:33:49,"with a Canadian broadcasting corporation, they responded, saying the response to the slogan"
00:33:49,00:33:54,"might be described as technically mixed. I do have to share with you, just on the basis of that,"
00:33:54,00:34:01,"so as you interrupt. But this thing of getting yourself a phrase, a logo, a strapline,"
00:34:01,00:34:05,"what have you wanted to call it, as a country, a city, a state, and when I was touring across"
00:34:05,00:34:10,"all the American states, for BBC documentary years ago, you noticed every time we crossed a"
00:34:10,00:34:15,"state line that they would say, ""Welcome to Mississippi,"" and it would have its official name,"
00:34:15,00:34:20,"the Magnolia State, and there'd be some phrase like, ""Come play,"" or something like that, you know."
00:34:21,00:34:26,And the one that I really wanted to congratulate was Kentucky. Kentucky is probably known for two
00:34:26,00:34:31,"things. I mean, the blue grass state is its official nickname, but they wanted a kind of one that"
00:34:31,00:34:36,"expressed what it was to be a Kentucky. And you think of two things, you think of the Kentucky"
00:34:36,00:34:42,"Derby, and you think of Bourbon, and they came up with a two word phrase that incorporated both"
00:34:42,00:34:48,"that, both those two things, and it's beautiful. Horse throat, because you'll have a horse throat"
00:34:48,00:34:53,"if you drink Bourbon, and they have lots of horse throat. I know, it's unbridled spirit."
00:34:53,00:35:00,"Isn't that great? Oh, genius. Whoever thought of that deserves it."
00:35:00,00:35:04,"Did I have the case of Makers Mark? Yours would have been runner-up, I hope you could run better"
00:35:04,00:35:12,than horse throat. You're good. You've got the idea. They're weirdly interesting
00:35:13,00:35:18,"identity, aren't they, though, in state slogans, and it really took off in the 20s and 30s, I think,"
00:35:18,00:35:24,"and they've all got state symbols. And in fact, I've put down here Mexico, but I think I meant to write"
00:35:24,00:35:29,"New Mexico, because Mexico is not a state of America. New Mexico is the only U.S. state that has,"
00:35:29,00:35:38,"and it's legally enshrined, a official state question. And the state question is red or green."
00:35:39,00:35:45,"And do you know why? Is it a game show or something? No, it's because Chile is very important in the"
00:35:45,00:35:50,"cuisine. And apparently, you know, you're asking a restaurant red or green, and that's what you"
00:35:50,00:35:56,"go for, so they've got a state question. We could have tomato sauce or brown sauce as the British"
00:35:56,00:36:04,"one. As Danny Baker does on the show, we never had brown sauce. And I wasn't making a point,"
00:36:04,00:36:08,"I didn't. It's going to disapprove of brown sauce, and they're my very closest friends, and my admire,"
00:36:08,00:36:13,and they'll regularly buy it. I just have never tried it. Have you sensed it? I've never
00:36:13,00:36:17,"watched strictly come done, so it's just one of those things that I've never got round two,"
00:36:17,00:36:23,"and I'm very strong-feeding, I never will. It does upset some people, because they're excited."
00:36:23,00:36:26,"Did they bring your brown sauce to try? I haven't tasted it, isn't it? It's perfectly"
00:36:26,00:36:31,"nice. It's slightly vinegry for me, but it makes me cough a bit when it first breath in, you know? I"
00:36:31,00:36:36,"think it's because that's two quintessentially British things. Yes. Stephen Fry and brown sauce,"
00:36:36,00:36:40,"it feels like they should be together, isn't it? Well, you see, this is it, whenever there's a binary"
00:36:40,00:36:45,"question, like, you know, tomato ketchup or brown sauce, I will immediately assume there isn't,"
00:36:45,00:36:54,"I'll say, mustard. Really annoying people. Some more Canadian things, but it's very cold in"
00:36:54,00:37:01,"Canada, famous. They're coldest they've ever had is -62.8 degrees, and that was in a place called"
00:37:01,00:37:07,"Snag in Yukon, and the residents would walk around like zombies, because if they walked too fast,"
00:37:07,00:37:13,"they would get out of breath, and the something to do with the way that the air went meant that you"
00:37:13,00:37:20,"could hear things from a massive distance, so it was very, very dry air and very, very dense in"
00:37:20,00:37:25,"nature, like as in underwater travels. Yeah, absolutely, and it meant that you could hear people talking"
00:37:25,00:37:30,"from five kilometres away, you could overhear the conversations. Oh no, with a lot of fallings out,"
00:37:30,00:37:34,neighbors bitching about people in the next town. You're walking so slowly that you can't get to
00:37:34,00:37:42,"them to say, ""Hey, hey, have not put on winter weight thanks very much."" I did a film in Winnipeg once,"
00:37:42,00:37:49,"and then that gets to -40, which is very, very cold. I told my father that my brother, who's"
00:37:49,00:37:54,"there, said, ""Is that centigrade or Fahrenheit?"" My father, who's a physicist, really,"
00:37:54,00:37:58,"came back straight away, said, ""I'm making a difference."" My brother was very cross about this."
00:37:58,00:38:03,"I mean, it doesn't make any difference. It makes a difference. Of course, it makes a difference,"
00:38:03,00:38:08,"and my father just happened to know and was not giving it away, that -40 is exactly, I say,"
00:38:08,00:38:14,"that's great, and that's our night. It's the one point where they're identical, so when it's -40,"
00:38:14,00:38:20,it doesn't make any difference. Which you're using Celsius or Fahrenheit. I hope you never reveal
00:38:20,00:38:23,"the reason. No, it's the kind of person who, if you've got cold in the kitchen, would open the fridge,"
00:38:23,00:38:28,"you know, like a true physicist, to warm the room. Yes. And those of us who are superstitious about"
00:38:28,00:38:32,"these things would go, ""But surely he's going to make the room colder."" You go, ""Don't you know anything"
00:38:32,00:38:38,"about thermodynamics? You can only make it warmer."" I was wondering about national stereotypes,"
00:38:38,00:38:43,"and we're like across the world, and how old they are, and partly because I'm reading Martin"
00:38:43,00:38:48,"Chasawit at the moment, which has amazing descriptions of Americans in it. And it's just so interesting"
00:38:48,00:38:54,"that his descriptions are hilarious, and exactly what you describe. Very satirical. The so satirical."
00:38:54,00:38:59,"So it's brilliant. So one of my favourite scenes is where Martin has just gone to America spoiler,"
00:38:59,00:39:03,"and he's hanging out with Americans for the first time, and he's astonished at how much they eat,"
00:39:03,00:39:08,"and how fast they eat. And I just loved his quote that said, ""The poultry, there was a turkey at"
00:39:08,00:39:13,"the top, a pair of ducks at the bottom, and two fows in the middle, disappeared as rapidly as if"
00:39:13,00:39:18,"every bird had had the use of its wings, and had flown in desperation down a human throat."""
00:39:18,00:39:24,"He was sadly disappointed in America, though, Dickens, wasn't it? In his matches,"
00:39:24,00:39:29,there's that wonderful bit in Chasawit. Have you come up to it yet? The Water Tows Society.
00:39:29,00:39:33,Yes. Which is really... The Water Tows Society is an American
00:39:33,00:39:40,"Athenian Society, a homerole for island society. And Chasawit is invited to, as someone who"
00:39:40,00:39:46,"apparently believes in homerole for the Irish, and all the Americans say how cruel the lion of"
00:39:46,00:39:53,"Albion with its paws and its claws tearing at the throat of the free Irish, and the Water Tows Society"
00:39:53,00:40:00,"exists to spread the gospel of freedom for all people. And Chasawit got up and said, ""Yes,"
00:40:00,00:40:08,"and I know you must all feel the same about your slaves and your Indians."" And there was a terrible"
00:40:08,00:40:14,"silence, and they burned the Water Tows meeting all down to the ground, and the societies never heard"
00:40:14,00:40:20,"of again. And his Dickens really, having a go at the fact that Americans were all very good at"
00:40:20,00:40:26,"saying how... ""Tut, tut, tut, look at you and island, but the moment the torch was right back on them."""
00:40:26,00:40:31,"Yeah, the hypocrisy of it is amazing. And he, as well, just speaking, have been the first fact about"
00:40:31,00:40:36,anti-counterfeit measures of the watermark. Wasn't a large part of his life dominated by stopping
00:40:36,00:40:43,"the copying of his books and reselling, and that took a huge part of his hatred for America,"
00:40:43,00:40:46,"again, because that's where it wasn't. He tried to get twain and all sorts of..."
00:40:46,00:40:50,"He very first, but when he was a young man, and never been heard of, and he was just doing the text"
00:40:50,00:40:54,"to a famous illustrator, and he did the text of the proceedings of the Pickwood Club,"
00:40:54,00:40:58,"and slowly it just took off, and everyone said, ""Who is this? Right at the right?"""
00:40:58,00:41:02,"Yes, the drawings are very nice, but the writing... Before it had even finished,"
00:41:02,00:41:07,"it seared nice form. There were the pinkal wick papers, the piggy wick chronicles."
00:41:07,00:41:14,"There were so many of these pirate versions floating around, and Dickens was always furious at that."
00:41:14,00:41:19,"Yes, yeah. I love the idea of sort of back alley editions of Dickens. You think you're buying"
00:41:19,00:41:24,"some uncut pickwick. You get at home and open the papers, and it turns out you've got some pinkal wick."
00:41:24,00:41:30,"If you read the diaries of the James family, for example, Henry Jameson, his brother William,"
00:41:30,00:41:35,"the famous university, the psychiatrist, I mean, and the all-cotts and all the new England literary"
00:41:35,00:41:43,"families, they would gather together on a Sunday, and the previous Saturday, one of them would have"
00:41:43,00:41:49,"gone down to the docks to get the latest Dickens, and they would arrive in bundles, and they'd be"
00:41:49,00:41:54,"cut open, and you would, you know, you race home with it, bring up many people around from, you know,"
00:41:54,00:42:00,"who are of a similar literary bento, or excited and read the next chapter. And it was like the most"
00:42:00,00:42:05,"exciting thing. And Henry James talks about remembering this as a boy sitting under the table, and"
00:42:05,00:42:11,"in particular, the one that we now most laugh at, or is probably least regarded as a great Dickens novel,"
00:42:11,00:42:18,"is the old curiosity shop, and partly because of Oscar Wilde's famous comment is that you have to have"
00:42:18,00:42:28,a heart of stone to read of the death of Little Nell without laughing. But there was so excited
00:42:28,00:42:34,"about Little Nell, that there was a riot at the docks in Boston. Everyone shouting, ""Is Nell dead?"
00:42:34,00:42:39,"Is Nell dead?"" And it was like, you know, later on there was the JR in Dallas, and there had been"
00:42:39,00:42:43,"such things, and I guess people want to know what the finale of this Game of Thrones episode is,"
00:42:43,00:42:49,really nothing touch that exciting. And am I right in saying they people on the ship actually
00:42:49,00:42:54,"announced it. It wasn't even the point of taking at home and reading. Someone said, ""Yeah,"
00:42:54,00:43:01,"it's a little bit smaller. Little Nell died. Bill Hayden is the mole. Colour defect."""
00:43:01,00:43:09,"Sorry, don't broadcast them. Don't broadcast them. We need to get a new captain of this ship."
00:43:09,00:43:14,"This guy is really an erasure in the merger of Roger Acroix, who does the murder."
00:43:14,00:43:16,"Oh, gosh. A policeman in Uncle Poro's Christmas."
00:43:16,00:43:21,Somebody unwinded.
00:43:21,00:43:31,"Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Chuzensky."
00:43:31,00:43:35,"Yes, my fact this week is that the scholar who first discovered that the Noah's Ark story"
00:43:35,00:43:41,"predates the Bible, got so excited by it that he stripped off his clothes and ran naked around"
00:43:41,00:43:51,"the British Museum. And this was just how thrilling it was. This was in 1853, and this amazing discovery"
00:43:51,00:43:57,"was made, which was basically the palaces of this great Assyrian king and the Library of Nineveh,"
00:43:57,00:44:02,"and this person found them, and then this scholar called George Smith back in the British Museum."
00:44:02,00:44:07,"He was very devout Christian, translated this tablet and realised this is the Noah's story,"
00:44:07,00:44:13,"and freaked out. Apparently took some clothes off and ran around the museum, but it was fair enough"
00:44:13,00:44:18,"because it was a big deal. Yeah, the excitement was so great for him that was his only way of expressing"
00:44:18,00:44:24,"he wasn't an odist basically, it was just, it was too much in the moment."
00:44:24,00:44:30,"Certain he was completely stark as he may have been. I think he took off some clothes, some sources say,"
00:44:30,00:44:34,"you know, maybe he kept his willy in. I tell you what though, they get excited about things"
00:44:34,00:44:39,"in very odd ways at the British Museum. I have a friend who James and I know, and I think Steven"
00:44:39,00:44:43,"you might have met him, he's called Irving Phil. Oh, yeah, the great, yeah, the great, the great,"
00:44:43,00:44:49,"which, the Kuneiform, yeah, and I was, I was behind the scenes with him at the museum, and he"
00:44:49,00:44:55,"showed me a sort of a cast of the of the tablet, the Kuneiform Noah's Ark tablet that he used to"
00:44:55,00:45:00,"study because he actually studied it further, decoded certain aspects of it that had not been seen"
00:45:00,00:45:05,"before, which was the actual measurements from Noah's Ark and they recreated it, which is amazing."
00:45:05,00:45:09,"But while we were sitting there in the very beginning of our meeting, he suddenly got an email"
00:45:09,00:45:15,"and jumped up from a seat and he went quick, run, and we ran through the corridor. I was chasing him."
00:45:15,00:45:19,"- He didn't make it at the time. - No, we're all, all because of him. - He's in the nippers and he bearded"
00:45:19,00:45:26,"individual all the way through. - Yeah, so what it looks wonderful. But so he sort of ran down the corridor"
00:45:26,00:45:30,"and then he cut into the kitchen and we stopped, what happened? And he said there's just"
00:45:30,00:45:35,"been an announcement, there's orange juice in the fridge for any member of a sack. And so you've got"
00:45:35,00:45:40,"to be quick, everyone gets to it before I do. And we quickly had two cups and went back into his room."
00:45:40,00:45:45,So that is classic academic everyone. I first went to Cambridge to do an interview at Cambridge.
00:45:45,00:45:49,I saw these two old dons in black gowns and I thought I'll follow them and I'll hear them talking about
00:45:49,00:45:56,"Aristotle or something really, really intellectual. And one of them was saying, ""No, no, it comes in a"
00:45:56,00:46:03,"small packet about the size of a single play record, a 45 RPM record. And it's full of community"
00:46:03,00:46:09,"little pieces that come to life when you pour boiling water in them. And I assure you, it's singularly"
00:46:09,00:46:16,"toothed. A chicken noodle. The company is called Nor with a K, a silent K. And that's what they were"
00:46:16,00:46:21,"talking about. I was thinking, ""Wow, that's not what I expected."" But it was very pleasing as I thought."
00:46:21,00:46:26,"But so this academic, what was it, do you, do you know his name? - George Smith. - Yes."
00:46:26,00:46:33,And was it the cognitive dissonance isn't quite the way? Was it the shock that the Bible might not
00:46:33,00:46:38,"story might not be true or that it is true, but not as the Bible tells it? - It's confusing because"
00:46:38,00:46:43,"he was pleased. Whereas I would have thought, yes, I was shocking, but I think it was almost like good,"
00:46:43,00:46:49,this is verifying that the Bible was the truth perhaps. - He was obsessed with his tablets. - Yes.
00:46:49,00:46:55,"- Because of course the Greeks also run the same time they had a flood, myth, dukele, and imperial. - Yes."
00:46:55,00:47:01,"And the same thing, they had a wooden chest, it's called in, the way it's translated, but he might"
00:47:01,00:47:05,"as well be called an ark, because an ark is a chest as much as it is anything else. The ark of"
00:47:05,00:47:12,"the covenant is a chest after all, it's a strange word. And so the dukele and imperial was the daughter"
00:47:12,00:47:17,"of Pandora, the first woman. So it's a very early thing that mankind displeased the gods and they"
00:47:17,00:47:22,sent the flood. And dukele and imperial survived because they were warned about it. And then when
00:47:22,00:47:28,"they landed, it wasn't on, well we think now, Mount Ararat, the supposedly the ark landed,"
00:47:28,00:47:32,"they said many people believed Noah's Ark was a Mount Ararat, but it landed somewhere in, and"
00:47:32,00:47:37,"they were told by Athena, I think it was, they were told to throw the bones of their mother over"
00:47:37,00:47:41,"their shoulders. And they didn't know what that meant. And they were very confused. They said,"
00:47:41,00:47:45,"""Oh, the bones of my mother, it's the stones of the mother earth."" So they threw stones and"
00:47:45,00:47:50,"whatever, pure, threw a stone over her shoulder, a woman sprang up out of the ground and wherever,"
00:47:50,00:47:55,"to carry in a man's sprang up. So it's always one of those, you know, auto-ethonic stories."
00:47:55,00:47:59,"- But you don't want to take that literally, actually. - But it's a similar thing of a punishment,"
00:47:59,00:48:07,"and the Philemon and Bauchist stories also gather with another flood. And so they exist, you know,"
00:48:07,00:48:12,"at least two versions in Greek myth. Many others in other Mediterranean myths, it's Sumerian,"
00:48:12,00:48:17,"Akkadian, Babylonian, I think. - I mean, I think these guys stole a lot from the Babylonians,"
00:48:17,00:48:20,"in fact, the Assyrian, so they probably got it. But yeah, they all have been passed down"
00:48:20,00:48:25,"for one or another. - Is it like that 5,000 BC? Was it when there was all those civilizations,"
00:48:25,00:48:31,"the Mayans, and all these cities, something were evacuated. These great, there seems to have been a plague"
00:48:31,00:48:38,"that was common across early civilizations. - How amazing is that? It's passed down. - Yes, and of course,"
00:48:38,00:48:43,"yeah, that's so... - But this myth is particularly bizarre. So this is how the Assyrian"
00:48:43,00:48:48,myth had it in the Library of Nineveh when they found it. And I didn't realize this is in the
00:48:48,00:48:54,"epic of Gilgamesh, so the very famous discovery, my famous discovery that was made there. And the belief,"
00:48:54,00:49:00,"the story as it was told was that there was this huge flood. And before the flood, then God had"
00:49:00,00:49:04,"delivered all his messages to people via these fish, these weird fish creatures. So they were right"
00:49:04,00:49:09,"near the Persian Gulf, and the idea was these huge fish creatures used to come out of the Persian"
00:49:09,00:49:13,"Gulf in the day, and they'd go and they'd tell the Assyrians what to do. They'd be like, don't drink that,"
00:49:13,00:49:19,"be nice to your mum, et cetera. And then this huge flood came, and it basically poisoned the"
00:49:19,00:49:23,"fish creatures, so they never came back. And after the flood, there was lots of disease because it,"
00:49:23,00:49:27,"you know, floods will cause disease. And it was thought that was part of the God's punishment."
00:49:27,00:49:33,"From that moment on, the God stopped visiting them with these fish creatures. And so, yeah,"
00:49:33,00:49:36,"that was the thing, and that was why he had to have human scholars, who were the ones who then"
00:49:36,00:49:40,"received messages from the God's via strange, critical ways. - And in the Hebrew myth as well,"
00:49:40,00:49:45,"it's the same thing that God provides a rainbow at the end of the, as a covenant, that he will not"
00:49:45,00:49:51,"interfere again. So it also marks the slight withdrawal of God from the people of Israel,"
00:49:51,00:49:56,"these chosen people, at that moment, that he's more distant from a few prophets. - It's like a show"
00:49:56,00:50:04,"creator handing over, you know, it's like Russell T. Davis to Stephen Moffert. - So is the vibe not,"
00:50:04,00:50:08,"all right, fine, is that's how you want to do it? I'll leave you to it. Is it a bitter kind of God"
00:50:08,00:50:11,"saying, fine, whatever, get on with it then. - There's still some things that are punished,"
00:50:11,00:50:18,"and in the same way that the real punishment is a transgression of Zenia in Greek mythology,"
00:50:18,00:50:23,"which is the guest friendship, and you honor you as a host to a stranger who comes to your door,"
00:50:23,00:50:29,"and that that's really what the story of Philemon about this is about, and that's why they're"
00:50:29,00:50:34,"visiting with a flood because everyone in the village turns away Zeus and Hermes, who appear as"
00:50:34,00:50:38,"travelers, except these old couple who welcome them, and that actually is closer to the story of"
00:50:38,00:50:43,"Latin, his wife, in the sins, you know, the city of the plain, the Sodom and Gomorrah. If you remember,"
00:50:43,00:50:48,"angels come, you're looking puzzled as if you haven't read the Bible, maybe, and but... - From Tabbat,"
00:50:48,00:50:51,"many times. - That famous goal is the way to do it, isn't it?"
00:50:51,00:50:57,"You certainly have heard of Sodom and Gomorrah, and what happens is angels come, go to sort of,"
00:50:57,00:51:02,"they hear about what wicked city the cities of the plain are, at the bottom of the Dead Sea."
00:51:02,00:51:06,"There's still sea signs when you travel down the road that Jordan sings, Sodom, that way,"
00:51:07,00:51:15,"very pleasing, but anyway, yeah, the angels arrived, and were treated very, very rudely, and even more"
00:51:15,00:51:21,"rudely by one particular citizen of Sodom, who wanted to know the angel, and that is where the phrase"
00:51:21,00:51:25,"to know them in the biblical sense comes from. In other words, he tried to seduce this angel,"
00:51:25,00:51:29,"and Sodomy, Sodomite, and the whole idea that Sodom was this place, because of that one reference"
00:51:29,00:51:35,"in the Bible of someone who wanted to know the angel, and they punished the city with Philemon,"
00:51:35,00:51:41,"and except for the holy couple, just like Duke Daniel and Berkes who were, I mean Philemon,"
00:51:41,00:51:47,"who were a lot and his wife, and they were allowed to, but they mustn't look back, and it was exactly"
00:51:47,00:51:52,"the same in the Greek myth. - There's no news stories, they're all boys, didn't we? - He said"
00:51:52,00:51:57,"that they have the rainbow at the end of Noah's eyes. - Yes, he sends that as a covenant, doesn't he?"
00:51:57,00:52:03,"- Yeah, he then, according to Genesis, he began to be a husbandman and planted a vineyard."
00:52:03,00:52:10,"- Noah's vineyard, yes. - Yeah, he then drank wine, and was drunken, and he was uncovered within his tent,"
00:52:10,00:52:14,"so he basically, once he finished, he got drunken, got naked. - That's what you do. - Well,"
00:52:14,00:52:20,"you see finally a story in the Bible to which everyone, you know, they've done a Noah."
00:52:20,00:52:25,"- You know the fish creature that you're talking about, so I'm going off memory here, but"
00:52:25,00:52:31,"depictions I've seen of it is, it's a sort of reverse mermaid, it's a fish head with legs, so it was"
00:52:31,00:52:36,"a partial human-based thing, and it's used as those ancient alien kind of things, that was a higher"
00:52:36,00:52:43,"knowledge that was coming to educate and create these amazing civilizations at the time. Yeah,"
00:52:43,00:52:47,"no one keen on that minor chat, great, all right? - No, no, no, something is a fish man."
00:52:47,00:52:54,"It's interesting, though, because, of course, all the evangelists who became part of the temperance"
00:52:54,00:53:00,"movement at the end of the 19th century believed everything in the Bible, but they had to,"
00:53:00,00:53:05,"they had to rule out wine, and wine is unquestionably approved of, throughout the Bible, not only is"
00:53:05,00:53:11,"Noah the first example of it, but Christ's first miracle is turning water into wine at the wedding"
00:53:11,00:53:15,"in Canaan, so it is clear, and indeed, obviously, the last supper and everything that becomes so,"
00:53:15,00:53:20,"it's quite difficult to believe in all the Bible, but decide that alcohol is terrible."
00:53:20,00:53:25,"- Yeah, really vindicated. - Well, there's some translations where they changed it to grape juice,"
00:53:25,00:53:30,"but problems like that, yeah. - Yes, that's it. - That's what kind of a boy you'd have to be to make the"
00:53:30,00:53:38,"Bible less sexy. - Very well. - Well, having to talk to these people. - This guy, George Smith,"
00:53:38,00:53:43,"who decided to come here, so he's an amazing guy, because he left education at the age of 14."
00:53:43,00:53:49,"He became an engraver of banknotes at the Bank of England, so as a result, he had an incredible"
00:53:49,00:53:54,"eye. He could detect incredible details in banknotes that he was engraving, that other people"
00:53:54,00:54:02,"couldn't spot, and also he was obsessed with these canary form tablets. So he, firstly, you know,"
00:54:02,00:54:08,"he delivered this lecture saying the Noah's Ark story is a Hebrew adaptation of a much older story,"
00:54:08,00:54:13,which created huge controversy because it was quite soon after on the origin of species.
00:54:13,00:54:17,It was another way of... - And geology was also doing its damages to undermine
00:54:17,00:54:23,"him. - Yes. - What, yes, was it Ruskin called those damned hammers, chipping away at every truth that"
00:54:23,00:54:29,"was understood. - So he was kind of a controversial figure, but then the amazing thing was in this"
00:54:29,00:54:33,"tablet that he had translated of the Noah's Ark story, there was a section that was missing."
00:54:33,00:54:39,"There were about 17 lines that were missing from the tablet just ended there, and the daily"
00:54:39,00:54:45,"telegraph offered a thousand guineas to whoever found this missing 11 lines of canary form tablet,"
00:54:45,00:54:49,"obviously with him in mind, because he was the expert, he knew all about it, and he went there,"
00:54:49,00:54:56,"he went to what is now Mosul, which is where the library... - The library. - Yeah, and it was where"
00:54:56,00:55:03,"the library had been of King Sinacarib, is that it? - Was it Ashabhanepal? - Sorry, Ashabhanepal."
00:55:03,00:55:07,"Where the Library of King Ashabhanepal had been, and he got to the site of the library."
00:55:07,00:55:12,"It was a huge site, it was about three miles across the whole city, and so it was like looking for a,"
00:55:12,00:55:17,"you know, really was needle in haystack stuff. He looked, and he went to the pit of the old libraries,"
00:55:17,00:55:21,"the likeliest place he'd find it, and he found it had been used as a quarry, and it was a complete"
00:55:21,00:55:27,"mess of rubble, you know, different fragments from all over all different centuries, but he started"
00:55:27,00:55:33,"looking, and the amazing thing was he found it, he found a tiny... - He must have never. Only he could have"
00:55:33,00:55:38,"found it. - Yeah, exactly. He found the 17 lines which completed the Noah's Ark story,"
00:55:38,00:55:44,and he brought it back. - Did they see a naked man running back out of the quarry? - Wow. - Fabulous.
00:55:44,00:55:50,"- Yeah. - Imagine that feeling. - Wow. - Yeah. - And also, that's kind of a nice mirroring of"
00:55:50,00:55:55,"actually what happened in terms of collecting the information for the library at the time,"
00:55:55,00:56:00,"so in the Assyrian culture. So this is like 3,000 years ago, and Ashabhanepal wanted to collect all"
00:56:00,00:56:05,"human knowledge ever at that point, and he'd collect all these tablets, and when and got scholars"
00:56:05,00:56:09,"to write them, and if there was something missing, he'd say, ""Oh, there's this story that I've heard"
00:56:09,00:56:14,"about and I don't have it."" He'd put a call out to everyone in his kingdom, saying, ""Everyone go hunting."""
00:56:14,00:56:18,"So all the Assyrians knew what he was looking for, and they'd be a reward, and they'd just go scouting"
00:56:18,00:56:22,"out for it. - And it's one of the biggest kind of kingdoms that had ever existed, right? It was"
00:56:22,00:56:28,"all of North Africa and all of the Middle East, all the way across to New York. - Yeah, it was huge."
00:56:28,00:56:31,"- And Sinecrum was after him all before him. - Before him was his father, I think. - He was destroyed,"
00:56:31,00:56:36,"because that famous Byron poem, isn't it, ""The destruction of Sinecrum?"" The Assyrian came down like a wolf"
00:56:36,00:56:42,"on the fold, and his girls were shining in Scarleton gold. - Oh, really? How was he, what he was killed?"
00:56:42,00:56:46,"- That's called the destruction of Sinecrum, I think. - Oh, really? - Someone listening one, though."
00:56:46,00:56:54,"- Aren't the Assyrians named after Noah's grandson? - Is it Assyrian? - Oh, grand son, yeah. - Assyrian."
00:56:54,00:57:00,"- Is that one of the tribes, isn't it? - Yeah, Assyrian, and that's where Assyrian comes from."
00:57:00,00:57:03,"- So there's... - Well, she's from Shem, of course."
00:57:03,00:57:09,"- She might. So, and as in Haam Shem, and if you're anti-Semitic,"
00:57:09,00:57:13,"it technically means you don't like Arabs as much as anything, because they are"
00:57:13,00:57:19,"before the split between Abraham and Ishmael, who were the patriarchs of the two different"
00:57:19,00:57:24,"peoples. There was Abraham and Ishmael. Ishmael went out and founded the Arab people, as it were."
00:57:24,00:57:32,- And Abraham was the patriarch of the Jewish people. - So you're even more prejudiced than you
00:57:32,00:57:36,"actually thought? - Yeah, it's just they were anti-Semitic. - Yeah, they also had,"
00:57:36,00:57:40,"with the Kineiform tablet, something interesting. They were used constantly, so they"
00:57:40,00:57:44,"wouldn't fire them and make them a solid, because they wanted to reuse them. So once a tablet had"
00:57:44,00:57:49,"been read, they could remold it and make it better. But what that meant was, if they were ever"
00:57:49,00:57:53,"attacked the Assyrians, and let's say their places were burnt down, by burning down their"
00:57:53,00:57:58,"libraries, they were actually preserving their information, because the clay would be fired up."
00:57:58,00:58:01,"- Baked? - Yes. - So they would bake the information, indeed."
00:58:01,00:58:05,"- That's the whole reason, the whole library, and the reason it survives, is because of that,"
00:58:05,00:58:09,"it's such a funny irony. And it's such a good thing, because the Assyrians were eventually taken"
00:58:09,00:58:15,"down by the Babylonians, and I think it's like from the Iranian area, the current Iranian,"
00:58:15,00:58:20,"the needs, and the Babylonians. - Needs, yes. - Needs. Needs. Needs and Persians with the two groups"
00:58:20,00:58:26,that made up the government run as in Dorothy Parker's famous remark. - One man's meat is another man's
00:58:26,00:58:32,"Persian. - Oh, well, maybe she'd argue with, I think, I can't remember who was saying this,"
00:58:32,00:58:36,but the needs weren't particularly cultured. So the Babylonians would have taken these tablets and
00:58:36,00:58:40,"preserved them and gone, oh my god, this is learning. But the needs just weren't solid, let's burn"
00:58:40,00:58:44,"the whole thing down. And then ironically, they managed by doing that to complete preserve them"
00:58:44,00:58:50,"forever. So in your face. - They're so revealing, aren't they, about what it is to be human,"
00:58:50,00:58:56,"because like almost all ancient forms of writing, 95% of it is taxation and accounting,"
00:58:56,00:59:02,"and storage of grain. But then you get this fabulous bit, the bit that Irving Finkel is so excited"
00:59:02,00:59:08,"by the children's, the equivalent of the exercise book, where you have the little clay tablet that he"
00:59:08,00:59:14,"has in the British Museum, which you can go and see, which are children writing insults about"
00:59:14,00:59:19,"their teachers, because that's their practicing. I mean, it's just delicious, it's so good. - Real"
00:59:19,00:59:23,"insight, it's just fun. - Yeah, there is one story, which I haven't found any, I've found it in one"
00:59:23,00:59:29,"source only, and it's, so I think it's not true, but it's of a clay bottle, and there was an apprentice"
00:59:29,00:59:34,"at the British Museum who would not rest until he had deciphered this inscription on the bottle,"
00:59:34,00:59:41,"and it turned out to be, please replace, stop it in bottle. - 90% sure it's a joke. - That's like that"
00:59:41,00:59:53,"wooden post that had toti emel esto written on it, four letter words, toti emel e-m-u-l esto,"
00:59:53,01:00:00,"and but look at this, it sort looks Latin, you know, simul is so white emel, but esto is not quite right,"
01:00:00,01:00:06,"late Latin, maybe pig Latin might have esto, toti all something, and at some point I said no,"
01:00:06,01:00:20,"it's toti emel esto. - Okay, it is time for our final"
01:00:20,01:00:25,"fact of the show, and that is James. - Okay, my fact this week is that the rarest frog in England"
01:00:25,01:00:34,has a distinctive Norfolk accent. - Very pleasant now. - I heard birds having local
01:00:34,01:00:41,"accents. - Yeah, well actually I'm sure you can tell us about the California Western literal frog."
01:00:41,01:00:46,"- Oh, the one which you hear in Hollywood. - Yeah, the only frog that I dig was rivet. - Because it"
01:00:46,01:00:50,was used by sound recorders to do backgrounds for the jungle and everything wasn't it. - Is that right?
01:00:50,01:00:55,- I think I saw that on cue. - I think it was on cue. - That's my memory.
01:00:55,01:01:04,"- So this is the northern pull frog. It was extinct in England, in Norfolk, and they found out"
01:01:04,01:01:11,"doing 10 years of research that they had this distinctive call, which is common to the Norfolk area."
01:01:11,01:01:18,"It's a unique accent, and that and some genetics made them realize that it was endemic to Norfolk,"
01:01:18,01:01:21,"which meant that they could bring it back, and they've just recently put it back into some"
01:01:21,01:01:26,"pools in Norfolk. - Wonderful in the broads or the fins, presumably. - Yeah, in the broads, yeah."
01:01:26,01:01:30,- Very satisfied. - And does it bear any resemblance to the human Norfolk accent?
01:01:30,01:01:36,- It's just a slightly deeper ribbit. - One single comment about it being fond of its
01:01:36,01:01:43,"sister the most from God, and I will be very cross indeed. - So humans can tell if frogs are"
01:01:43,01:01:50,"excited or not, this is a really interesting thing. So humans can tell basically if almost all"
01:01:50,01:01:55,vertebrates really are excited or not. So this was an experiment done by scientists. They played
01:01:55,01:02:00,"recordings of aroused and non-aroused frogs, and aroused just means... - Not exactly in some way."
01:02:00,01:02:06,"- Yeah, exactly. - And this was people who spoke different languages as well. So I think some"
01:02:06,01:02:12,"English and some Mandarin and some of a third language, and 90% of them could tell which the"
01:02:12,01:02:17,aroused ones were. And the reason that we think this is is because we think there are universal
01:02:17,01:02:24,"vocal elements. So when we're excited or as it's, we speak higher and faster, and frogs do the"
01:02:24,01:02:29,"same thing. So we think there are vocal signals that are the same, even in different taxa,"
01:02:30,01:02:35,"which is really interesting. - But frogs are a sort of index species, all kinds of the health of"
01:02:35,01:02:40,"wetlands and everything, and tens of thousands of, and there's a runny,"
01:02:40,01:02:46,"whatever it is, a runny form virus at the moment that's threatening from everywhere."
01:02:46,01:02:50,"- Yeah, really? - They're really sad, yeah. - Yeah, they're all dying out. - Everything is."
01:02:50,01:02:56,"- And also, we're running out of ponds. - Yes, in the UK. - Let alone natural wetlands,"
01:02:56,01:03:00,"the good old suburban ones, you mean? - Yeah, there are half as many ponds in the UK"
01:03:00,01:03:05,"than the wet 50 years ago. Norfolk has lost 8,000 ponds since the 1950s. - Have you"
01:03:05,01:03:10,"know my parents have a pond in Norfolk? - It does have frogs. - It does have frogs, and it"
01:03:10,01:03:14,"frogs born, and it's always rather amazing, and they try and protect the frogs born from the various"
01:03:14,01:03:18,"predators that like to eat it. - But if you combine two ponds into one large a pond, you have"
01:03:18,01:03:23,technically destroyed a pond. - So is it possible there are... - It made the lake. - It's just one
01:03:23,01:03:28,massive lake. - I know it seems unlikely. - I don't think that's what's happened. I don't think Norfolk
01:03:28,01:03:33,"is now one huge lake, and no other ponds. - Well, when I was a boy, you definitely, I mean, it sort"
01:03:33,01:03:36,"of hurts you, I don't know my brother and I have yet, nothing better to do. We'd go and hunt for"
01:03:36,01:03:41,"sticklebacks and mutes, and all those sort of creatures. - Well, every village would have a pond,"
01:03:41,01:03:44,"and most farms would have a pond, because it's where you would get your water from, and that's right."
01:03:44,01:03:50,"- Yes, yes. - Like a titty-ditty bang bang one, you know, one that truly scrumptious gets stuck in a car,"
01:03:50,01:03:55,"that sort of one, you know, ducks, and... - Was it in Norfolk, where there's that myth about a lake,"
01:03:55,01:04:00,"where the reflection of the moon is in it, and the myth was that they used to tell visitors to"
01:04:00,01:04:04,"the area that they've been trying to catch that big white thing in the middle of the lake for years,"
01:04:04,01:04:07,"and they should have a go, because they just couldn't get it, and it was their trick they played,"
01:04:07,01:04:15,"- It was like it's a wheelchair. - And wheelchair... - I thought it was an impotator, but it was harder. - I thought it was a samasatch. - Sure, sure."
01:04:15,01:04:18,"- One of those ones, in which you have a gun, do you have to be doing it? - Yeah."
01:04:18,01:04:25,"- Don't confuse Norfolk with the language with Norfolk, which is N-O-R-F-U-K, which is a language"
01:04:25,01:04:31,"spoken on Norfolk Island. - Oh, would you do that? - Oh, just off-Australia, yeah. - In the Pacific, yeah."
01:04:31,01:04:37,"- Yeah. - And it's a blend of 18th century English and Tahitian. - Is that right? - That sounds good, doesn't it? - Yeah."
01:04:37,01:04:42,"- And you don't confuse it. Do you think people are showing up? - Yeah, they're going, ""Hey, got light bulb?"""
01:04:42,01:04:48,"- That's the wrong action for a honorable city. - Do you know where you can find a Norfolk accent,"
01:04:48,01:04:54,"not in Norfolk, is in parts of New England, because so when the Pilgrim Fathers went over and say"
01:04:54,01:04:58,"they're a lot of them are from East Anglia, a lot from Norfolk, and there are certain quirks of"
01:04:58,01:05:03,"the accent, New England accent, that are only seen in Norfolk, so I think, and a few phrases."
01:05:03,01:05:11,"One of them was good on you, apparently. Good on you. Another one was, ""How much did you give for it?"""
01:05:11,01:05:16,"As opposed to, ""How much did you pay for it?"" Which apparently is a quintessentially Norfolk thing."
01:05:16,01:05:19,"- And the ""do you,"" the, I don't know what that sort of aggressive present is really peculiar,"
01:05:19,01:05:24,"when the ""do you"" not as a question, but as an invitation or even a command, ""do you sit down?"""
01:05:24,01:05:27,"Meaning, ""sit down."" - Yeah, that's weird. - ""Do you come in? Do you come in? All you"
01:05:27,01:05:34,"must be cold, do you come in?"" That just means ""come in."" All there's ""do"" meaning ""if,"" which is"
01:05:34,01:05:38,"a very strange Norfolk thing, say, ""You want to come in? Do you get cold?"" - Really?"
01:05:38,01:05:44,"""The ""do"" means ""if you don't."" - Oh, wow. The ""lest."" - Yeah. Yeah, my sister's"
01:05:44,01:05:48,"nanny was sort of sort of Norfolk, and she I used to do it in Raichelle, or no, not really,"
01:05:48,01:05:53,"she was only, but, you know, sort of teaser and things like that. And ""don't,"" she said, ""you"
01:05:53,01:05:57,"stop having ""do I'll tell your father? Do I'll tell your father?"" - Oh, really? - It was really, really"
01:05:57,01:06:02,"extraordinary. - I read a really funny blog on the British Library website, so the British Library"
01:06:02,01:06:06,"have done this amazing thing, which is they want to preserve dialects before they'll disappear,"
01:06:06,01:06:11,so they've got loads of volunteers over the last few years to go and record things that they say
01:06:11,01:06:15,"in their own local dialect, and they've kept these recordings, so you can go online, it's brilliant."
01:06:15,01:06:21,"Go to it, it's called the Evolving English Word Bank, but it's really great. The only problem"
01:06:21,01:06:25,with it is the kind of people who are going around the British Library and volunteering stuff.
01:06:25,01:06:28,"You can tell when you listen to the recordings, they're not the kind of people who are using the"
01:06:28,01:06:34,"street slang of the modern day. So you have, like, a listen to one, it's so good. It's this, obviously,"
01:06:34,01:06:40,"really extra-learned, nervous sounding nerdy old man. It says, ""I've got two examples of words"
01:06:40,01:06:46,"I'd like preserved that are used by pupils at a school in Oxford, where I'm from. The first word"
01:06:46,01:06:56,"is bear, spelled B-A-R-E, which now means a lot, and the second word is jokes, that is jokes,"
01:06:56,01:07:03,"which is now used as a word meaning fun."" And then he gave an example. He said, ""So a pupil in school"
01:07:03,01:07:09,"recently wrote, 'I am a seed.' He was learning about germination. I am a seed, and when it's winter,"
01:07:09,01:07:14,"I don't sprout because there's bear snow on the ground, but if I wait until it's warm,"
01:07:14,01:07:21,"everything will be jokes."" And it's just if that's what's preserved as how people are using bear"
01:07:21,01:07:27,"and jokes in the future. There is an amazing book, which this is more just for people listening right"
01:07:27,01:07:34,"now, Susie Dent. Oh, wonderful. Yeah, she wrote this song. Yeah, she wrote fantastic book recently,"
01:07:34,01:07:40,"which was she went to every sort of, she went to hang out with builders and people who work in"
01:07:41,01:07:46,"transport, and the current slang being used by all of them, she documented down in this book. So"
01:07:46,01:07:51,"it's sort of fresh slang, preserving a time. It's a really beautiful book for her. Very important"
01:07:51,01:07:59,that. I love books on thieves canton and those sort of slangs of the 17th century and onwards.
01:07:59,01:08:05,"And I want to just memorialize the great Dennis Norton, because you reminded me of a story he told you,"
01:08:05,01:08:11,"you remember the great comic writer and who died in his late 90s, just recently, he told me this"
01:08:11,01:08:16,"famous story when he was at school. He had a very good English teacher, very advanced for his"
01:08:16,01:08:24,"damn, and this is way back in the 20s and 30s, I guess. And he said, right, we're going to do re-enforced"
01:08:24,01:08:30,"meaning class and then we're going to re-enforced what some people say. London, it's a pretty poor"
01:08:30,01:08:36,"ordinary school in the East End, where Dennis grew up. And he said, I'll illustrate this by telling"
01:08:36,01:08:42,"a story of these two road builders, Navis, you know, and one of them sees a poster on the wall and it says,"
01:08:42,01:08:47,"""One man, one vote."" He goes, ""What's that about?"" And his mate says, ""What do you mean to me? It's"
01:08:47,01:08:51,"one man, one vote, isn't it?"" He said, ""Well, I don't get it. One man, one vote."" How does that?"
01:08:51,01:08:57,"I don't say that. I mean, you got one man? You got one vote. No, no, I still don't get it."
01:08:57,01:09:01,"""One fucking man, one fucking vote."" Oh!"
01:09:01,01:09:14,"""Good way to seem cool in front of your pupils, telling that story. As soon as you drop a swear word as a"
01:09:14,01:09:20,"teacher, you've got that respect."" Well done. Because every generation thinks they've invented it."
01:09:20,01:09:24,Yes. That's the extraordinary thing. We knew the idea that one's grandfather was saying
01:09:24,01:09:28,"that the F word ""all the time"" in the trenches, which I remember being so shocked by, and I read"
01:09:28,01:09:34,"""Goodbye to all that,"" you know, the rubber graves. And he thought he'd heard all the swearing he could"
01:09:34,01:09:39,"ever hear at school, you know, in the showers, after the rugby game. And then he said the first moment,"
01:09:39,01:09:45,"he was, you know, training with other cadets and listening to NCOs and Sarge and Simon,"
01:09:45,01:09:52,"he'd just never imagine people would swear that much. And of course that's, you don't see that,"
01:09:52,01:09:55,"because it's a sanitized version, just as you didn't see them wiping their bottoms and"
01:09:55,01:10:01,"we got better things to do, obviously. But it is important to remember, because certainly some of"
01:10:01,01:10:05,my generation thinks the First World War has one's grandfather's generation. Obviously most people
01:10:05,01:10:10,"listening are far too young to that. They'd be your great-grandfathers, possibly even great-great-grandfathers."
01:10:10,01:10:14,"But I knew people, maybe at my school there were, there were people who fought in the First World War,"
01:10:14,01:10:20,"and to my channel shame. I remember this man, Mr. Sorden, who shook his hands all the time and"
01:10:20,01:10:27,"slightly gaped with his mouth, and he was the brother of the headmaster's wife. And he was,"
01:10:27,01:10:32,"we teased him mercilessly. And then one day one of the masters said, ""You do know, you want a"
01:10:32,01:10:37,"military cross in the First World War."" It was one of the bravest men he would ever meet. He was"
01:10:37,01:10:43,"destroyed by watching a whole trench of his friends blown up in front of his eyes. I just remember thinking,"
01:10:43,01:10:49,"""Oh dear, what was mocking him and doing his early imitating and trembling hands?"" And so obviously"
01:10:49,01:10:53,"you think of them as a very extraordinary generation, but you don't think of them as just like us. So what we"
01:10:53,01:10:58,"do think that they did swear, they did live colorful lives as Pieds Piax and shows literally colorful"
01:10:58,01:11:03,"in a sense. Yeah, that was brilliant, wasn't it? Pieds Jackson thing, I think we didn't see it. It's"
01:11:03,01:11:10,"amazing when you see war suddenly with a blue sky. Yes, yes. So counterintuitive, you just thought"
01:11:10,01:11:18,"it's going to be mucky and dark, but yeah, they fought on sunny days. We should wrap up shortly. We can."
01:11:18,01:11:22,"We can do one last thing. Go on, Andy, have you? Yeah, got a frog. It's a cool frog and I didn't want to"
01:11:22,01:11:29,"imagine the frog. Have you heard of the northern spring peeper? No. No. Okay, so it's very cool. It's"
01:11:29,01:11:38,"it lives in ponds and the temperature frequently drops below freezing problem, but the frog"
01:11:38,01:11:45,hibernates and it has a it has evolved a way to stay alive while it has frozen. The temperature
01:11:45,01:11:49,"inside it, if it gets to minus two or three Celsius, the frog can survive because the water inside"
01:11:49,01:11:55,"it is super cool. So it's still liquid. If it gets any colder than that, it's still not a problem."
01:11:55,01:12:01,The water under the frog skin freezes and its stomach becomes a solid ball of ice. So about half
01:12:01,01:12:07,"the water inside the frog freezes. It can survive for a week like this and it's because, so normally"
01:12:07,01:12:11,the problem is you get ice crystals inside your cells and the cells rupture and you die. That's
01:12:12,01:12:18,"what happens. As soon as the ice crystals start to form inside the frog, the frog's liver goes"
01:12:18,01:12:25,into an emergency rapid response action. It produces a load of glucose in it. It spreads it
01:12:25,01:12:29,throughout the body and it prevents the crystals forming in the cells. But the glucose levels in
01:12:29,01:12:34,"its core organs shoot up 50 times as much. Wow. As soon as the first ice crystal forms, the frog"
01:12:34,01:12:39,"liver goes, ah, we're freezing. Wow. React. Wonder if you get an alcoholic frog who's got liver"
01:12:39,01:12:47,"damage, whether it's less good or fast. Incipient diabetes as well. Wow. Well, I'll, I mean,"
01:12:47,01:12:51,I've got a story to tell about a frog and it is your company's because it's really not very of a sound.
01:12:51,01:13:00,"There's a librarian who's busy and she, a hen comes into the library and goes, boop,"
01:13:00,01:13:07,"and a librarian thinks, okay, and grabs a book and gives it to her and the hen goes off and then"
01:13:07,01:13:12,"the hen comes back really quick, you know, a few hours later and goes boop, boop, boop, boop, boop."
01:13:12,01:13:16,She gives her three books and two under one wing and one under the other and off goes the hen
01:13:16,01:13:21,"and then the hen comes back and goes boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop. And it dumps the three books"
01:13:21,01:13:25,that had been given and so she gives another six books and it's lunchtime in the library and
01:13:25,01:13:30,"I've got to see this extraordinary literary hen and follows it down the street, down the little"
01:13:30,01:13:36,alleyways and then up up into a door and the door's left open and so the librarian watches the hen
01:13:36,01:13:41,"with these books tucked under its wing, going all the way up to the top of the stairs and into a room,"
01:13:41,01:13:45,the door's closed but the librarian kneels down and looks through the keyhole and there on a bed
01:13:45,01:13:52,is a frog with a little spotty bandage around its forehead and a thermometer in its mouth and the
01:13:52,01:13:56,"hen takes the monadratum reads it and then hands the book to the frog and the frog says,"
01:13:56,01:14:00,"""Reddit."" ""Reddit."" ""Reddit."" ""Reddit."""
01:14:00,01:14:04,Oh that's a fantastic fact to end on.
