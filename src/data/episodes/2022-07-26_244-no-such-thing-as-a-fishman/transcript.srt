00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
 Hi guys, just before we start this show, we wanted to let you know we've got a really

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,880
 exciting guest on today. We were really looking forward to recording with this person.

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:12,480
 It's a new, up and coming comic and creative talent called Stephen Fry.

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:19,040
 Yeah. I've not heard of him. Well, I think you will have in a couple of years. He's new on the scene.

5
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:23,760
 Cool. Okay. Well, that's very exciting. And he has this new book out, which is called Heroes.

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,960
 It's a fantastic book. It's all about the Greek heroes. So Jason and Hercules,

7
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:35,520
 slash Hercules and Pegasus, all these familiar characters, but written in the incredible comic

8
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,880
 wit and stylings of Stephen Fry. It's really funny. It's fantastic for kids. And if you're an

9
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:45,280
 adult who just wants to revisit these stories, I highly recommend it. There you go. That's Heroes

10
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:51,280
 by Stephen Fry. And then please do also buy book of the year by us. And we should just say this

11
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,520
 is a special extended version of the podcast because Stephen had so much to say and we wanted to

12
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,000
 hear it. We figured you guys would want to hear it. And so enjoy this episode of no such

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,200
 things a fish plus. Okay. On with the show.

14
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:23,520
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

15
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:29,360
 from the QI offices in Covenant Garden. My name is Dan Schreiber. I am sitting here with Anica Zinsky,

16
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,400
 Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkend, and a special guest. And the man who gave us the name,

17
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,600
 the QI Elbs. It's Stephen Fry. And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our

18
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,960
 four favorite facts from the last seven days. And in no particular order, here we go. Starting with

19
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,920
 you, Stephen. All right. Yes, I have a fact here. There was a make of toilet paper in Victorian

20
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:56,240
 England that was so posh every sheet had a watermark to deter counterfeited. Actually, it was so posh,

21
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,000
 it wouldn't have been called toilet paper. It would have been called lavatory paper. If you remember,

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,440
 toilet is deeply non-use. As is the word posh. So in fact, it was probably make of lavatory paper that

23
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:10,000
 was so classy with every sheet had a watermark. But anyway, that's the point. And what does that

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,360
 tell us about Victorians and Bathroom Habits? I wonder the revolutionary custom. Well, this was

25
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:21,040
 on the first toilet papers or lavatory papers, wasn't it? Yeah. What was used before that then? Well,

26
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,440
 there is. We know all the stories of, you know, swans necks and goose necks. Yeah, corncops,

27
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:31,200
 I think we mentioned before. Yeah. I just wondered what, so for example, this is in the 19th century.

28
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:37,680
 So this was well after, for example, Jane Austen died. So what are the regency gentry? Or just

29
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,960
 the middle classes? I mean, I can't imagine Jane Austen using a corn cob is all I'm trying to say.

30
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:49,200
 The way they're called Dolly. I know the French used lace, which is weird because it got holes in it,

31
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,320
 but apparently they did. I know that in many Middle Eastern customers, the hand was always used and

32
00:02:54,320 --> 00:03:00,960
 that's why you don't use the cacan literally the shithand if they may say so. Yeah, cacan did,

33
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:06,080
 and it's interesting. I don't know many people have watched Peter Jackson's reconstruction

34
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,720
 of, you know, recalorisation of some of that extraordinary museum. First of all, war footage and they

35
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:16,320
 may remember seeing those men perched on a bar having a poo with their bottoms sort of hanging over. Yes.

36
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:21,600
 It's a reminded one, obviously, of the very everyday nature of war includes naturally, the very

37
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:28,240
 everyday nature of emptying the barrels. And there I think one of the comments was from a veteran

38
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:34,400
 speaking that there was no paper. So our grandfathers and great-grandfathers who thought in that war

39
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,960
 and survived would have all had that same experience. Yeah. And we don't talk about it. Was the

40
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:44,480
 wipers times? Was that? That's a good point. Yeah. That wasn't signford. It wasn't. No, it was just a

41
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,520
 classic Tommy mispronunciation of Ibrahim. Oh, it's not that. Did you think that? I thought you

42
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:54,400
 would read it and then wipe your butt. Well, that will be a full lot of me as they say. But a very

43
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,840
 happy one. Yeah. So there is a first world war toilet paper fact, which is that both sides printed

44
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:07,120
 toilet paper with propaganda on it. So the Germans issued sheets with a series of lying reports

45
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,920
 by our enemies. And British manufacturers did the same thing. And swap them on the other side.

46
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,480
 No, just for you to wipe your bottom with British propaganda. And I don't offer a fact. Because you

47
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:20,800
 know when we're young and I don't suppose cartoonists still do, but escaping prisoners always used

48
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:26,080
 to have suits with arrows on them. Yeah. Government property arrows. Well, when I was a young

49
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:31,760
 and unfortunate criminal convicted and inside a prison, the laboratory paper there was in those

50
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:37,360
 sort of boxes where there are other crispy leaves intertwined and interleaved, in fact. And they had

51
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:43,760
 those arrows on. As did the cigarette rolling papers that's got from the shop. But we all had those

52
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:48,880
 arrows. Surely prisons only plus the arrows. Wouldn't that take some when you left for the

53
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,920
 finger? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. I'll show you Daniel Bird. Yeah. Yeah.

54
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:59,040
 American, they get like little tattoos, don't they, to show what they've done. Yes, if you just

55
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:04,560
 have a piece of arrow of time paper, it's the same job. Well, have we mentioned that they used to,

56
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:10,000
 so before toilet paper was invented, they used to wipe their bombs on the Farmer's Almaniac,

57
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,040
 didn't they, in America famously. And the Sears catalogue, and they both used to come with a hole

58
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:20,560
 in them so you could hang it up and then use it as lurals. Yeah. And I was actually listening to a

59
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:26,160
 podcast, which was saying there are two reasons that suddenly lural was necessary and was taken on.

60
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,000
 One was that we invented plumbing, so suddenly you can't flush a corner on the cob down the

61
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,120
 loo. And the other was the Sears catalogue started coming laminated, started coming with glossy,

62
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,680
 glossy paper. Oh, right. It didn't work at all. Yeah, it was absorbing, but not absorbing.

63
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:46,720
 The important distinction. I find white troze food illustrated, very uncomfortable every month.

64
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:53,680
 But this does bring us to a sensitive point about the wiping bottoms. Most people never

65
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,720
 taught her to wipe the bottom. I assume unless there's some memory of a mother during potty training,

66
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,560
 actually explaining it. But there was a new story just the other day about the fact that women are

67
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,800
 being told how to wipe their bottoms. And some people on social media were very angry at being told.

68
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:14,720
 But the answer is, and you know, this is all too distressing to hear. But that forwards to back

69
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:20,480
 is the correct female way. It's as a woman, you just are told that. You chant it, practically.

70
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,320
 I think I'm right in saying, guys, we don't do that. Do we? I get the other way. Exactly.

71
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:31,120
 You go back to... But it doesn't matter for you, obviously. No, we don't have the other, the little...

72
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,000
 You'd have to really miss your target and get it up your way through.

73
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:43,600
 Frank can open about this. Absolutely. So it's a health issue for women, obviously.

74
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,720
 I'm so glad you're here, Steve. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

75
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:54,240
 We go and we go on. But it's interesting. We say, bringing the levels up and everything,

76
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,680
 to an alien species looking at us, why they would be very puzzled at the fact that we have these very

77
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:06,800
 normal and necessary actions that are part of every day, like eating and drinking and having a

78
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,440
 pony and a pea. And indeed, making love in order to whatever whole cohesion or whatever

79
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,680
 one wants to go, in order to propagate the species. And those are the very things that have the taboos.

80
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:22,720
 Whereas murder and cruelty, we can use those words we can tell us in the traffic was acting as cruel.

81
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,760
 Oh god, it was murder. Is it my hand? Murder kills people. That's the thing we should have a taboo of

82
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,760
 murder. Whereas if you say it was shitting bad traffic, we could do swear.

83
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:40,800
 Which frame of reference is the dangerous one? Not the pooing. So I'm sure to the very useful

84
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:46,800
 Martian watching that this should teach us something about how completely screwed up we are. It's so wrong to

85
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:52,800
 be obsessed. Well, I think wasn't the people who invented Lew Roll on a role for the first time,

86
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,920
 in fact, invented it in the 1890s and 1890s, I think. And they didn't admit to it. And they did it

87
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:02,880
 under a shell company. They only admitted to it in 1902 because it was such a shameful thing to

88
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:11,360
 have invented. I met someone who worked for Dalton, the porcelain company, in Staffordshire. And I asked

89
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,760
 Mr. Parsley and I said, "Oh, is a picture he did Staffordshire dogs or something in the governmental

90
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:19,600
 pieces?" You know, and I said, "There are all the mental things." I said, "What sort of things do you

91
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:25,440
 specialize in?" He said, "Mother Quiley, heavy wear." I didn't quite know what heavy wear was. And I said,

92
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:31,040
 "It worked out what he meant was bathrooms and lavatories." It was heavy wear. The proper porcelain.

93
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:38,880
 Really? Just speaking of the late 1800s and which way to wipe, I saw the patent for the first toilet

94
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:44,480
 roll. And it sort of answers the question of which way you meant to hang the roll. Does the paper come

95
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,840
 down underneath or does it go over? So which do you think it is? Well, I was thought forward, so you

96
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:53,440
 can grab it and that's the way hotels do it because they do a little coy, provocative peek.

97
00:08:53,440 --> 00:09:01,520
 Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. That's correct. It's that way in the patent. It's not a great question.

98
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:07,920
 But the thing about the little peek is supposed to be having works in a hotel. It's so that the

99
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:12,880
 housekeepers can tell if the room has been serviced. So it's the last thing they do. And so if that's

100
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,840
 done, it means they know that it's fine. So if I was a housekeeper, I'd just do that. Do the rooms

101
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:23,760
 very quickly. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. So if they got in and they saw that there were sort of one

102
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,880
 towel position and then all men say, well, that could have just been the person staying here. Let me

103
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,680
 check the bathroom. So there was a, sorry, no, I'm just thinking so. Yes, the first company to make

104
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:39,440
 Lurel disclaimed it or hid it. I wonder when it was first advertised them, when it was first allowed

105
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:44,480
 into magazines and then into television. We all familiar with Andrex and his puppy and everything.

106
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:50,560
 And I'm old enough to remember the Hullabaloo when it was allowed to have female sanitary

107
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:55,120
 products as they call them advertised on TV. And everyone said that was the beginning of the end.

108
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,880
 It's disgusting. I don't see that. But presumably there may have been a similar moment when

109
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:03,040
 Leverty paper was first advertised. Yeah. Well, but there's only you never, you still never see

110
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,920
 Lurel paper or sanitary pads with the thing on them that they're supposed to clear up. I mean,

111
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,480
 I wonder if men think that we have blue periods. Because the only thing you see is a drop of blue

112
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,440
 That's only Picasso has a blue period. There is one that says for your bum, this isn't there.

113
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,320
 There was one that has a, but yes, I thought, remember my friend, you and I, we wanted to do

114
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,120
 women in, when we were heavy voiceover, performance in the 80s and doing all kinds of

115
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,680
 adverts and things. We thought, why don't they do that? Be brilliant. Wipes your bottom

116
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:37,120
 beautifully. That was all you need. It just wipes your bottom. Brilliant. So this company is Scots who

117
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,600
 did this Lurel and they couldn't advertise. I know that much at least. And they sold it under the

118
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,840
 counter in the chemists. So you'd have to go in and they would just kind of, they would even put it

119
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:49,280
 on the shelf. Technically, actually, it should have been placed over the counter according to the

120
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:54,960
 patent. Yeah. And the outside Lurel would be a string with, with newspaper news. You say the holes

121
00:10:54,960 --> 00:11:01,600
 in the CSCenter. Yeah. I found a man, this is a two years ago, this is in 2016, it was a man who

122
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,640
 was fined in court after paying for a takeaway with a ten pound note that he had printed onto

123
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:14,240
 some toilet paper. It's incredible cut spa. He used this computer and he just used the desktop

124
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:19,520
 computer and a normal printer and he just put the Lurel into the printer. Wow. His defence

125
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:23,680
 barrister said, this is going to be the most expensive takeaway of Mr Coban's life.

126
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:30,480
 Is the great achievement of Peter Bezlegett and not Peter, but is it Joseph? I mean, don't know,

127
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,200
 is the great achievement of Joseph Bezlegett to be undone by the arrival of Moist laboratory

128
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:40,720
 because this seems to be now considered unflashable and the interview everybody uses it, a lot of

129
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:46,000
 people use it. Yes. Yeah. And there was a report just recently saying there is, they did tests,

130
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:54,240
 there is no style of moist paper or wipe that is suitable for our sewers without creating

131
00:11:54,240 --> 00:12:01,440
 blocks that cost millions. The fat birds, yeah. Everything has a, everything costs a shadow in this

132
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:07,840
 world. There is no such thing as a free lunch, there is a free bottom wipe. It's got it somewhere,

133
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:11,600
 isn't it? It was the number one cause I think they found of those big fat birds that they were

134
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:17,040
 finding in the sewers. As in, if you took percentages of what made it up, the fat, the wet wipes,

135
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:22,000
 which were largely I think more for babies than they are for adults, for cleaning nappies,

136
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,760
 that's what they found. And I read that we basically have KFC to blame for that. Colonel Sanders

137
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,920
 is the person who took the wet wipe and first introduced it into restaurants, and that's spread

138
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:38,400
 around the world. Yeah. So before we were, I think that's what you make. Another voice over is

139
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:45,920
 coming back to you. They do make sense though. I mean it is bizarre and I think people in other countries

140
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:52,240
 think we're bizarre that we use dry paper to get rid of that when it makes no sense not to apply

141
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,480
 water. I mean we wash our hands if we think there might be one bacteria on it and we cover our

142
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:03,040
 bottoms with it. Forward the B day. Yes. It will indeed. Yeah. The answer but no one has room for a B day,

143
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,200
 but what they do have room for and these becoming more and more popular. A little installation. So

144
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:13,440
 it's a now quite cheap of a Japanese style. You know the kind of thing. Yes. If you join into your

145
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:19,440
 plumbing, it's a seat and you have a remote control and you press buttons and it oscillates a jet

146
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:26,080
 up the jacksy and it has a female setting and a male setting and it can also offer hot air to

147
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:32,080
 dry zero madams backside. And these are becoming more and more popular and consider very healthy and

148
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:36,880
 of course there is nothing goes into the sewer except once you've dropped in there in nature's way.

149
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:41,600
 So there is obviously it costs energy because they're electric. Yeah. But those are going to be

150
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:47,600
 more and more popular. It's so funny you're just because your voice is so perfect for talking

151
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,960
 and selling things as you did that. I thought your voice would be fantastic for that with

152
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:57,440
 Sarah or Madame enjoy a jet up the jacksy. There's a great story about one of my heroes one of my

153
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,760
 cinematic heroes as well. Many people's cinematic here a billy wilder of the great. Oh yeah.

154
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:07,840
 Director, you know, some like it hot. Yeah. Some sort of a boulevard, whatever. Many many great films

155
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:13,520
 and I think he was in Paris with Marilyn Monroe and Tony Curtis and Jack lemon and trying to keep

156
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:17,840
 control particularly of Tony Curtis and Marilyn Monroe and his wife Audrey who might met

157
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:23,840
 fun enough. She told me this story was true. Had said to him, honey, I want you when you're in Paris

158
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:30,400
 to get a proper Parisian bidet because the you know the wall cuts have got one or whoever it was.

159
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:35,840
 Some family that she sort of keeping up with the Jonesed with and she felt that they wanted and he

160
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:40,800
 said sure, honey, I get you. I get you don't problem. Anyway, he was so busy. He was so busy in Paris

161
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,880
 that he just didn't get hold of it and he didn't even have time to look at a plumbing supply shop and

162
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:51,520
 have a bidet shipped over from Paris to Beverly Hills and on in the car on the way to

163
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:57,360
 Wassie or whatever the airport was then in Paris. He suddenly remembered and he stopped off

164
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:06,480
 at a bureau de post to send a telegram to prepare for disappointments and honey tried everywhere

165
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:20,640
 no bidets in Paris suggest doing handstand in shower. I love bidet which you might all know this but

166
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:26,800
 is named after a small extinct donkey or horse. How did you know it? Yeah, so bidet is French for

167
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:32,400
 this species of small horse and so small that the idea is with a bidet you'd be straddling it like

168
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:37,680
 like this little wing. Was it a real animal? Yeah, it's a real animal. In Italian the word for bidet

169
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:43,680
 translates as hygienic little horse. Same thing, yeah. But I didn't think it was based on an

170
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:54,000
 extinct real animal which people rode to clean. No, no, no, no, no, no. No, like a burrito looks like

171
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,800
 a little donkey but it doesn't mean people eat donkeys in the way they are burritos. Got tide

172
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:03,760
 travelers when you go back open the toilet there's a corn of coal and there's a donkey. What am I

173
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:10,640
 meant to do here? There's toilet paper that we were talking about the main facts. It was shown

174
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:17,200
 at the 1878 Paris exposition and it won the highest prize. So it was seen as such an innovation

175
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:25,280
 in anti-counterfeasing, in actual quality of lavatory loo roll. So the watermark was the maker of

176
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:30,400
 the, it wasn't that you could have it in your own family crest. It was the, it was the watermark of

177
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:34,400
 the manufacturer of the roll. Promo, that's right. Promo, exactly, yeah. And that's where they were,

178
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:38,800
 right? Yeah, yeah. And there's the best they made. They must, they had amazing inventions in the

179
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:43,200
 Victorian era. Do you know the travelator I think was there? Sometimes it's, yeah. Sometimes it's

180
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:47,360
 the simplest of their actions that are the best though, isn't it? You're right. We do still all use

181
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,960
 loo rolls. Yeah, we don't use it. There was a period when they were, they called themselves

182
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:56,240
 'medicated', which is a suspect not a legally enforceable meaning for word. But IZile

183
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:01,360
 medicated, we had at my crept school, which was the hideously tissy we wanted, and Bronco,

184
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:08,240
 they claimed to be medicated, what they were medicated with, I don't know. The first package

185
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:13,280
 toilet paper was made by Gayati, Joseph Gayati, and he called it the therapeutic paper.

186
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:19,120
 Somewhat it named after Queen Victoria. What an honor. Victorian brands of toilet paper, I just

187
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:24,320
 found a list of a few, and they included things like Baldog and Sampson and Virilla. That is great.

188
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:30,880
 But there were also others called Victoria and Queen and Gloria Victus. Good, it was close. Yeah.

189
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:36,320
 Can I tell you about one, because this is a Victorian invention. Oh yeah. And a Victorian

190
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:41,200
 invention that actually was made that I had never heard of before, but bifocals for horses.

191
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:49,600
 And they got these. So this was in the 1880s, 1887. Someone went into a pharmacy and said,

192
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:56,720
 "My horse has gone shortsighted, I'm a cab driver." But the thing is, he likes to read the paper, so...

193
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:02,800
 Wake up, walking into things. He's not getting as many tips as he used to. And it was actually

194
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:06,560
 tried out, and there are pictures of this horse. There are photographs of this horse wearing

195
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:11,760
 these bifocals, which apparently it didn't like at first, but then it refused to go without them.

196
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,480
 And it got taken up by a handsome cab driver's, because what they actually did was

197
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,800
 make the road seem like it was rising up in the horse's face, and so they used to pick up their

198
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:28,800
 hooves much higher. And that looked, you know, that was my posh. So they started burying them.

199
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:33,920
 So that actually happened? My focals, as we know, were invented by Benjamin Franklin, weren't they?

200
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:42,080
 Oh, yes, yes. But not quite one. That's rather interesting. Another bit of a bizarre invention from the

201
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:47,280
 Victorian times. They used to, if you went to a pub or any kind of restaurant, the opposite of today,

202
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:52,080
 smoking, the smell of smoke was actively encouraged, and it made the place feel like somewhere you

203
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,000
 wanted to be, somewhere that was happening. So a lot of problem was, if a restaurant started

204
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 its day, it was not full of smoke. So someone invented an automatic smoking machine. The machine

205
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,800
 would have lip cigarettes, sort of bellows, exactly, and it would come out. And so the idea is that it

206
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:11,760
 would sort of cover the restaurant in this mist of smoke. And you go, oh, it can go off. Fantastic.

207
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:16,000
 What happening? What a happening restaurant. Wow. Do we know if that got made?

208
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 No, I mean, it got made, but I don't know if it was six, I don't know if they made more than one.

209
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,560
 Oh, but they made a model of it. That is amazing. They used to have competitive smoking and

210
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:30,240
 pubs in the UK in the early 20th century. Yeah, and you would have a pipe and you'd have to keep it.

211
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,880
 Oh, yes, that went on way, way into my lifetime. Oh, yeah. To keep it in America, they had it to,

212
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:39,840
 yeah, everyone had an identical clay pipe. The whole point was it had to be sort of controlled,

213
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:46,240
 a clay pipe, an identical quantity of pipe tobacco. And it was their job to light it and keep it

214
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:51,440
 going for as long as possible and staggering along. You know, you or I would have just kind of

215
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,760
 gone out in seconds, but they could keep it going for hours and hours, putting their fingers

216
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:03,920
 over the top of the bowl and just load. It's lost art. It is. I was the very last pipe smoker of the year,

217
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:10,480
 ever. Oh, yes, yes. So it used to be a very popular thing every year. It was a big dinner at the

218
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:15,360
 Savoy Hotel, sponsored by Alfred Dunhill, who in those days were primarily tobacco nests.

219
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:20,720
 Yeah, our fashion house, of course. But their shop in Germain Street was filled with huge jars of

220
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:27,520
 tobacco. And they would call them your sort. Snuff and tobacco were called a sort. So you'd hear

221
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:31,120
 someone come in and they go, "Hello, you're gracious." "Oh, sorry, come in." "Have you got any of my sort in?"

222
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:37,280
 So it would be a mixture of Cavendish and these strange names that these particular types of

223
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:48,000
 tobacco had. And anyway, it was actually QI. It was the very first QI. I agreed to do an interview

224
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:55,760
 for the independent, I think it was, to publicise QI as a new programme. And I went to the Gratio Club,

225
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:01,520
 and at the time I had decided to try and cut down cigarette smoking. But I always carried a pipe

226
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:06,000
 with me. I always loved smoking, but the first pipe of the day I really enjoyed. So I had a pipe,

227
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,120
 and I really felt like smoking and in those days you could smoke anywhere. And so I let the pipe,

228
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,720
 and the photographer was taking pictures on me, and it was on the front of the independent

229
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:20,240
 that next day, or whatever, the following week. And immediately I got a letter from the pipe smoking.

230
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:28,160
 So it's a desperate thing. Finally, because the old days they had Harold Wilson and Eric Morker,

231
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:32,240
 and all these kind of people who'd be the pipe smokers of the year. But it was running thin on the

232
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:39,440
 ground, and Russ Aberton. And finally, they said, "Well, I don't really regularly smoke." And

233
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,600
 they made me a special pipe, which I still have, which is in the shape of a BBC microphone.

234
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:48,480
 You can disassemble it like the man with a golden gun, and he's a very apparatus, and turn

235
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:54,960
 into a pipe. And it was really, really fun. Are you technically the reigning? I am.

236
00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:02,240
 Yeah, I think they gave a very special lifetime pipe award to the comedy writer Lawrence Marx,

237
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:07,520
 who was also on the board of the pipe smoking association. And obviously we all deprecate smoking now,

238
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:13,040
 and I don't smoke anymore, and I haven't for 12 years, I think it is. But I sometimes think,

239
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:16,480
 you know, when I had a bit of a cancer scare the earlier this year, I kind of think,

240
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:22,320
 when I got my death sentence, I would probably just order a pipe online, and a great, you know,

241
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:29,600
 big, great vat of tobacco, and just carry on again. But I probably wouldn't actually,

242
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:34,800
 I mean, it probably tastes horrible in my mouth, but it is a memory of that. But I'm old enough to

243
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:39,440
 remember smoking cinema, smoking the tube, smoking buses, smoking absolutely everywhere,

244
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:45,200
 even in church. You know, their grand families had their box pews with brass, brass,

245
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:50,160
 off trays, so they were in the square, and they had a cigar, obviously, to the sermon. But it was

246
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:55,280
 short, it was really, I mean, apart from pipes, you know, with a wall to rally, it was really

247
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:59,760
 Oscar Wilde's generation that made cigarettes popular, and they were considered very decadent

248
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:04,720
 and extraordinary. And that was in the 1890s, but by 15 years later, virtually old, 20 years later,

249
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:09,520
 it was the middle of the first world war. Everyone did it. I mean, it was just everybody.

250
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,520
 But if we've only had about a century of it, basically. And now, of course, it looks weird,

251
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:18,000
 if you keep doing it in, you know, like, again, that Peter Jackson thing, you just saw all those

252
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,560
 Thomas smoking away. I love those things, which it's like, throughout all of history, no one

253
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:27,760
 smoked, and then for 100 years, everyone smoked, and then for the rest of time, no one will smoke

254
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:32,400
 again, so it's just, even though to us, it's a normal thing. It's completely unusual in the

255
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:37,360
 history of, there's that amazing moment as well, that America experienced, and it's covered in a

256
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:41,680
 Adam Curtis documentary, Power of Nightmares, I think, that the documentary is called, and the idea

257
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:46,320
 was that they realized in America that it was only men smoking, and they needed women to smoke as well.

258
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:50,960
 Oh, just Freud's brother in law, isn't it? Yes, it is. Yeah, and the idea was that they empowered

259
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:55,600
 the women of America to start smoking, saying that they were something like sticks of freedom,

260
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:01,280
 or liberty, liberty of torches, the very first photograph of them, he paid for them to walk down Fifth

261
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:06,960
 Avenue with cigarettes, yes, to very famous picture. I think, yes, it's the same member of the Freud

262
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:14,000
 family who invented bacon and eggs, but he was the father of the advertising. The father of healthy

263
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:28,480
 okay, it's time for fact number two, and that is Andy. My fact is that in 1972, a Canadian DJ held a

264
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:34,480
 contest to choose a Canadian national simile, like as American as apple pie. The winning entry was,

265
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:42,400
 as Canadian as possible under the circumstances. So they don't know what similes are for us.

266
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:50,880
 Yeah, this was a DJ called Peter Zasky, and he was a great Canadian broadcaster and he

267
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:57,520
 hosted shows for decades, and lots of aspects of Canadian life he analysed and examined, and he

268
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:03,840
 hosted this competition. A 17-year-old student came up with that slogan as Canadian as possible,

269
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:10,240
 and weirdly, Zasky, he just speaking about smoking, he won throws an essay called How to Quit Smoking

270
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:19,840
 in 50 Years or Less. Brilliant, I like it. Yeah, humorists and Canada, lots of those. Do you believe

271
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,680
 me? Of course, he was writing humorists, but all those comedians like Dan Atcroyden,

272
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:28,240
 they were honest, and there were so many of them. Yeah, they have an unfair reputation, don't they,

273
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:34,160
 for being dull, given that I'm not saying I believe that it is a reputation they have.

274
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:39,760
 Is it? I think nice, but a bit dull. I remember when I first went to Toronto,

275
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:44,880
 years and years and years ago, and I called up my friend and colleague, we were working together,

276
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,960
 all the time then, Hugh Laurie, and he had never been at that point too. And he asked what it was like,

277
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:56,720
 I said, I think probably I can best describe how Toronto is by saying that I asked the front desk,

278
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:01,200
 you know, what attractions they were to see, and they said, well, there's a the Bali Footwear Museum,

279
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:08,160
 and we laughed at that, and then two days later I said, I can give you a clearer idea of Toronto now.

280
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:15,520
 I had nothing better to do than go to Bali Footwear Museum, but in fairness to Toronto,

281
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:22,160
 it is improved enormously, that's what God said. The museum or the whole city, one the world series,

282
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:27,680
 twice in a row, the Blue Jays, and it became a, you know, and now it's, yeah, it's pretty,

283
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:31,600
 I just spent three months in Niagara on the Lake, which is beautiful. Oh, wow.

284
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:38,720
 Just on the right on the American border. Oh, really? And that was stunning. And they are very

285
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:44,480
 aware of how the world looks at them, and they know that they're a bit overflight and a bit of work,

286
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:49,360
 I was, you know, and do you find, they are actually factually like that, aren't they? I mean, there was a study

287
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:54,080
 done looking at people's Twitter feeds, and it was only comparing American and Canadian Twitter feeds,

288
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:59,040
 but the preponderance of words on American Twitter feeds were negative things, so like,

289
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:03,200
 hate and damn and bored and annoying, and then on Canadian feeds, they're all just saying words

290
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:09,840
 like favourite and gorgeous. Who even says gorgeous anymore? Great, amazing. In Ontario, they have

291
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:15,360
 the Apology Act that came in in 2009, and that's because people apologise all the time, and then

292
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,920
 law now is that an apology is not allowed to be considered an admission of guilt, because what would

293
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:24,240
 happen is you'd have a little car crash or something, and they go, sorry, sorry, and they go, well, he said,

294
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,800
 sorry, that's the admission of liability, and of course it is, it is just a natural instinct. That's

295
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:34,960
 so good. Just on the boredom thing, there is a town in Canada called Ocatokes. I don't,

296
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:42,560
 has anyone been? No, no. Well, they had a Taurus slogan, and it was, there are a number of things to do

297
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:54,400
 in Ocatokes. Very nice. And that number is zero. My friend John Sessions did his post-graduate

298
00:27:54,400 --> 00:28:02,080
 doctorate at University in Canada, and he waxes very, very miracle on his contempt for some of the more

299
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:08,400
 dull sides of it. Back then, in the 80s, I guess, or in the 80s, even in his case. And I happened to be in

300
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:13,600
 Oxford at the Oxford, I was filming there, and there's the Oxford University press shop on the

301
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:23,280
 high or the broader one. And I was ordering the new Oxford English Dictionary, the second edition

302
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:30,160
 of the whole thing, and there was a special price for a early buyer of it, and it wasn't in the shop,

303
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:35,040
 it was in the depository in Northampton, and they would send it to any address, and it was, I didn't

304
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:40,240
 know, £1200 or something. It's a huge number of volumes of this massive dictionary, and I was terribly

305
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,800
 pleased with it, and then I was looking around, and I saw one of those Oxford books, you know,

306
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:50,240
 you have Oxford books of the quotations, and so on. This was the Oxford book of Canadian political

307
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:59,440
 anecdotes. And I thought I must understand John Sessions in the scene. How could you fill a book with

308
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:04,240
 Canadians? Anyway, I thought it was the most amazing, so I took it up to the front of the desk,

309
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:09,840
 and then who should come into the shop? Jeremy Paxman, who's been across the road at All Souls,

310
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:14,320
 having a lunch, because he was doing a book on the British establishment. So we what hoed and said

311
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:19,520
 her though, and I sort of vague the new, and I said, look at this book I've got here, it's the Oxford

312
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:24,560
 book of Canadian political anecdotes, and he said, and then the assistant behind the desk said,

313
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:34,000
 that'll be 1217 hours. And Jeremy Paxman could only see that book. And I said, oh yes, very

314
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,200
 rare book. I mean, Canadian political anecdotes, Jeremy, come on. And he was like, I can't

315
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:46,400
 bad. And the assistant bless him, he joined in, said, oh yes, yes, very, very rare. So I signed it,

316
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:51,920
 and Paxman went off pulling and he said, doing all those Paxmony books, sort of expressions,

317
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:57,760
 and then it wasn't until two years later, I was filming again in Oxford, and I'd been asked to do

318
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:03,280
 this spectator diary, you know. And so I told that story in the spectator diary, and about two days later,

319
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:09,840
 I got this furious letter from Jeremy Paxman, I have been dining out. How mad you are. I know I'd

320
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:19,760
 discover. There's something else Canadians are very well known for, is saying A, are you all right,

321
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:24,800
 it's nice weather today, A, but not in that accent, in a Canadian accent. The Canadian alphabet A,

322
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:34,880
 exactly. So the University of British Columbia has an official A lab, which is, it's their syntax

323
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,840
 of speech lab, it's where you go, if you want to study the linguistics of that kind of thing,

324
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:44,160
 and it's called the A lab. Oh, very good. Yes, and I think it's first, so it goes back a long time,

325
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:51,360
 it goes back to before Canada was a country at all, so 1773, it appeared in an Irish play,

326
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:56,560
 and you know Irish people went to Canada, and then it appeared in a book in the 1830s that was

327
00:30:56,560 --> 00:31:01,520
 completely littered with it. But yeah, it's real wise, they might do that. So I think there's

328
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:07,040
 been a suggestion that there is a small bit of England where there's a similar inflection,

329
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:11,280
 and I can't remember where it is actually, but people took it from there. Because the accent is not

330
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:17,040
 dissimilar as it creeps over the border into Wisconsin, and North Dakota, you think, that movie Fargo,

331
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:21,520
 and the wonderful Frances McDormand performance of there, who got a question here, police work there,

332
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:27,680
 kind of it's got that similar kind of slight, and there the reason is supposedly the Scandal

333
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:33,040
 region input into Wisconsin, and they're all called Sorenson, in favour of the Bill Macy County,

334
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:38,400
 it's called Gunderson, I think, isn't it? They've all got names like that. It's just the size of the

335
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:45,600
 place. I think America's big, but Canada fans out into a greater width than up into the Arctic Circle.

336
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:50,800
 There's a great story, isn't there? So it's like a gap year where a woman writes to her sister,

337
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:57,920
 who's Canadian, and says, "My son, your nephew's got his gap year, and he's he'd be landing in Newfoundland,

338
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:04,480
 well, if you could pick him up, and her sister lived in British Columbia." So she sent her

339
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:11,920
 a reply back saying, "Why do you, your nearer?" "We are nearer here in Britain to that coast,

340
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:20,240
 and we're all so good." I was reading about Lumberjack's classic, Canadian. I love that a female Lumberjack

341
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:26,160
 is a Lumberjil, I think that's a lovely term, but I've discovered there's a thing they, the clothing,

342
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:30,960
 I was reading about their clothing, and there have been Lumberjack trousers invented, which I've

343
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:36,640
 never seen before, and the idea is that they are chainsaw proof. You can't chainsaw through them,

344
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:41,680
 and there are videos on YouTube of Lumberjack's showing you, and they all start the video by going,

345
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:44,880
 "Do not do this at home, do not do this at home, do not do this at home." And they

346
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,960
 rev it up, and the chainsaw gets going, and they just slam it down onto their trousers,

347
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:53,680
 and the fabric, it's eight layers of a plastic that are, there's a whole science video you can

348
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:57,680
 watch about the beauty of the science of how it works, and you can watch it and immediately get

349
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:04,240
 chewed up in the trousers, and store the chainsaw immediately. It's extraordinary, and

350
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:09,040
 scary, in the first person to try it. And yet, it can set a dream. Yes, exactly.

351
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:13,760
 You have imagined a fact that you were going out, and you're also Lumberjack wife, and put out your

352
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:18,320
 other pair of trousers that morning, just off to do my filming, honey. Oh, great, have fun!

353
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:24,640
 So, I was looking up other slogans in Canada, and place name slogans,

354
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:30,720
 so Ottawa launched a new slogan in 2001, and the slogan was, "Technically beautiful."

355
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:44,000
 What they were trying to say is that it's technologically advanced, it's great,

356
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,840
 with a Canadian broadcasting corporation, they responded, saying the response to the slogan

357
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:54,640
 might be described as technically mixed. I do have to share with you, just on the basis of that,

358
00:33:54,640 --> 00:34:01,280
 so as you interrupt. But this thing of getting yourself a phrase, a logo, a strapline,

359
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:05,600
 what have you wanted to call it, as a country, a city, a state, and when I was touring across

360
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:10,160
 all the American states, for BBC documentary years ago, you noticed every time we crossed a

361
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:15,120
 state line that they would say, "Welcome to Mississippi," and it would have its official name,

362
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:20,160
 the Magnolia State, and there'd be some phrase like, "Come play," or something like that, you know.

363
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:26,880
 And the one that I really wanted to congratulate was Kentucky. Kentucky is probably known for two

364
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:31,440
 things. I mean, the blue grass state is its official nickname, but they wanted a kind of one that

365
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:36,000
 expressed what it was to be a Kentucky. And you think of two things, you think of the Kentucky

366
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:42,640
 Derby, and you think of Bourbon, and they came up with a two word phrase that incorporated both

367
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:48,000
 that, both those two things, and it's beautiful. Horse throat, because you'll have a horse throat

368
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,760
 if you drink Bourbon, and they have lots of horse throat. I know, it's unbridled spirit.

369
00:34:53,760 --> 00:35:00,080
 Isn't that great? Oh, genius. Whoever thought of that deserves it.

370
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:04,800
 Did I have the case of Makers Mark? Yours would have been runner-up, I hope you could run better

371
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:12,880
 than horse throat. You're good. You've got the idea. They're weirdly interesting

372
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:18,480
 identity, aren't they, though, in state slogans, and it really took off in the 20s and 30s, I think,

373
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:24,400
 and they've all got state symbols. And in fact, I've put down here Mexico, but I think I meant to write

374
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:29,840
 New Mexico, because Mexico is not a state of America. New Mexico is the only U.S. state that has,

375
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:38,480
 and it's legally enshrined, a official state question. And the state question is red or green.

376
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:45,600
 And do you know why? Is it a game show or something? No, it's because Chile is very important in the

377
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:50,400
 cuisine. And apparently, you know, you're asking a restaurant red or green, and that's what you

378
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:56,240
 go for, so they've got a state question. We could have tomato sauce or brown sauce as the British

379
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:04,160
 one. As Danny Baker does on the show, we never had brown sauce. And I wasn't making a point,

380
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:08,880
 I didn't. It's going to disapprove of brown sauce, and they're my very closest friends, and my admire,

381
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:13,760
 and they'll regularly buy it. I just have never tried it. Have you sensed it? I've never

382
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,680
 watched strictly come done, so it's just one of those things that I've never got round two,

383
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:23,680
 and I'm very strong-feeding, I never will. It does upset some people, because they're excited.

384
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,640
 Did they bring your brown sauce to try? I haven't tasted it, isn't it? It's perfectly

385
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:31,440
 nice. It's slightly vinegry for me, but it makes me cough a bit when it first breath in, you know? I

386
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:36,720
 think it's because that's two quintessentially British things. Yes. Stephen Fry and brown sauce,

387
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:40,640
 it feels like they should be together, isn't it? Well, you see, this is it, whenever there's a binary

388
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:45,280
 question, like, you know, tomato ketchup or brown sauce, I will immediately assume there isn't,

389
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:54,640
 I'll say, mustard. Really annoying people. Some more Canadian things, but it's very cold in

390
00:36:54,640 --> 00:37:01,520
 Canada, famous. They're coldest they've ever had is -62.8 degrees, and that was in a place called

391
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:07,600
 Snag in Yukon, and the residents would walk around like zombies, because if they walked too fast,

392
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:13,600
 they would get out of breath, and the something to do with the way that the air went meant that you

393
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:20,320
 could hear things from a massive distance, so it was very, very dry air and very, very dense in

394
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:25,280
 nature, like as in underwater travels. Yeah, absolutely, and it meant that you could hear people talking

395
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:30,480
 from five kilometres away, you could overhear the conversations. Oh no, with a lot of fallings out,

396
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:34,000
 neighbors bitching about people in the next town. You're walking so slowly that you can't get to

397
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:42,400
 them to say, "Hey, hey, have not put on winter weight thanks very much." I did a film in Winnipeg once,

398
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:49,360
 and then that gets to -40, which is very, very cold. I told my father that my brother, who's

399
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:54,560
 there, said, "Is that centigrade or Fahrenheit?" My father, who's a physicist, really,

400
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:58,560
 came back straight away, said, "I'm making a difference." My brother was very cross about this.

401
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:03,840
 I mean, it doesn't make any difference. It makes a difference. Of course, it makes a difference,

402
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:08,960
 and my father just happened to know and was not giving it away, that -40 is exactly, I say,

403
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:14,880
 that's great, and that's our night. It's the one point where they're identical, so when it's -40,

404
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:20,320
 it doesn't make any difference. Which you're using Celsius or Fahrenheit. I hope you never reveal

405
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:23,520
 the reason. No, it's the kind of person who, if you've got cold in the kitchen, would open the fridge,

406
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:28,400
 you know, like a true physicist, to warm the room. Yes. And those of us who are superstitious about

407
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,000
 these things would go, "But surely he's going to make the room colder." You go, "Don't you know anything

408
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:38,400
 about thermodynamics? You can only make it warmer." I was wondering about national stereotypes,

409
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:43,840
 and we're like across the world, and how old they are, and partly because I'm reading Martin

410
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:48,800
 Chasawit at the moment, which has amazing descriptions of Americans in it. And it's just so interesting

411
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:54,800
 that his descriptions are hilarious, and exactly what you describe. Very satirical. The so satirical.

412
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:59,520
 So it's brilliant. So one of my favourite scenes is where Martin has just gone to America spoiler,

413
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:03,200
 and he's hanging out with Americans for the first time, and he's astonished at how much they eat,

414
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:08,880
 and how fast they eat. And I just loved his quote that said, "The poultry, there was a turkey at

415
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:13,920
 the top, a pair of ducks at the bottom, and two fows in the middle, disappeared as rapidly as if

416
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:18,240
 every bird had had the use of its wings, and had flown in desperation down a human throat."

417
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:24,640
 He was sadly disappointed in America, though, Dickens, wasn't it? In his matches,

418
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:29,600
 there's that wonderful bit in Chasawit. Have you come up to it yet? The Water Tows Society.

419
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:33,520
 Yes. Which is really... The Water Tows Society is an American

420
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:40,000
 Athenian Society, a homerole for island society. And Chasawit is invited to, as someone who

421
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:46,480
 apparently believes in homerole for the Irish, and all the Americans say how cruel the lion of

422
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:53,280
 Albion with its paws and its claws tearing at the throat of the free Irish, and the Water Tows Society

423
00:39:53,280 --> 00:40:00,800
 exists to spread the gospel of freedom for all people. And Chasawit got up and said, "Yes,

424
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:08,960
 and I know you must all feel the same about your slaves and your Indians." And there was a terrible

425
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:14,880
 silence, and they burned the Water Tows meeting all down to the ground, and the societies never heard

426
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:20,080
 of again. And his Dickens really, having a go at the fact that Americans were all very good at

427
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:26,080
 saying how... "Tut, tut, tut, look at you and island, but the moment the torch was right back on them."

428
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:31,120
 Yeah, the hypocrisy of it is amazing. And he, as well, just speaking, have been the first fact about

429
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:36,480
 anti-counterfeit measures of the watermark. Wasn't a large part of his life dominated by stopping

430
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:43,120
 the copying of his books and reselling, and that took a huge part of his hatred for America,

431
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:46,960
 again, because that's where it wasn't. He tried to get twain and all sorts of...

432
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:50,800
 He very first, but when he was a young man, and never been heard of, and he was just doing the text

433
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:54,880
 to a famous illustrator, and he did the text of the proceedings of the Pickwood Club,

434
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:58,240
 and slowly it just took off, and everyone said, "Who is this? Right at the right?"

435
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:02,640
 Yes, the drawings are very nice, but the writing... Before it had even finished,

436
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:07,280
 it seared nice form. There were the pinkal wick papers, the piggy wick chronicles.

437
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:14,480
 There were so many of these pirate versions floating around, and Dickens was always furious at that.

438
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:19,280
 Yes, yeah. I love the idea of sort of back alley editions of Dickens. You think you're buying

439
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:24,400
 some uncut pickwick. You get at home and open the papers, and it turns out you've got some pinkal wick.

440
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:30,000
 If you read the diaries of the James family, for example, Henry Jameson, his brother William,

441
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:35,680
 the famous university, the psychiatrist, I mean, and the all-cotts and all the new England literary

442
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:43,040
 families, they would gather together on a Sunday, and the previous Saturday, one of them would have

443
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:49,680
 gone down to the docks to get the latest Dickens, and they would arrive in bundles, and they'd be

444
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:54,960
 cut open, and you would, you know, you race home with it, bring up many people around from, you know,

445
00:41:54,960 --> 00:42:00,960
 who are of a similar literary bento, or excited and read the next chapter. And it was like the most

446
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:05,600
 exciting thing. And Henry James talks about remembering this as a boy sitting under the table, and

447
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:11,520
 in particular, the one that we now most laugh at, or is probably least regarded as a great Dickens novel,

448
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:18,320
 is the old curiosity shop, and partly because of Oscar Wilde's famous comment is that you have to have

449
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:28,080
 a heart of stone to read of the death of Little Nell without laughing. But there was so excited

450
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:34,160
 about Little Nell, that there was a riot at the docks in Boston. Everyone shouting, "Is Nell dead?

451
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:39,600
 Is Nell dead?" And it was like, you know, later on there was the JR in Dallas, and there had been

452
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:43,680
 such things, and I guess people want to know what the finale of this Game of Thrones episode is,

453
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:49,440
 really nothing touch that exciting. And am I right in saying they people on the ship actually

454
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:54,000
 announced it. It wasn't even the point of taking at home and reading. Someone said, "Yeah,

455
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:01,760
 it's a little bit smaller. Little Nell died. Bill Hayden is the mole. Colour defect."

456
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:09,520
 Sorry, don't broadcast them. Don't broadcast them. We need to get a new captain of this ship.

457
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:14,000
 This guy is really an erasure in the merger of Roger Acroix, who does the murder.

458
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,400
 Oh, gosh. A policeman in Uncle Poro's Christmas.

459
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:21,280
 Somebody unwinded.

460
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:31,040
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Chuzensky.

461
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:35,920
 Yes, my fact this week is that the scholar who first discovered that the Noah's Ark story

462
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:41,120
 predates the Bible, got so excited by it that he stripped off his clothes and ran naked around

463
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:51,120
 the British Museum. And this was just how thrilling it was. This was in 1853, and this amazing discovery

464
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:57,680
 was made, which was basically the palaces of this great Assyrian king and the Library of Nineveh,

465
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:02,080
 and this person found them, and then this scholar called George Smith back in the British Museum.

466
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:07,280
 He was very devout Christian, translated this tablet and realised this is the Noah's story,

467
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:13,680
 and freaked out. Apparently took some clothes off and ran around the museum, but it was fair enough

468
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:18,800
 because it was a big deal. Yeah, the excitement was so great for him that was his only way of expressing

469
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:24,800
 he wasn't an odist basically, it was just, it was too much in the moment.

470
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:30,480
 Certain he was completely stark as he may have been. I think he took off some clothes, some sources say,

471
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:34,880
 you know, maybe he kept his willy in. I tell you what though, they get excited about things

472
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:39,280
 in very odd ways at the British Museum. I have a friend who James and I know, and I think Steven

473
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:43,680
 you might have met him, he's called Irving Phil. Oh, yeah, the great, yeah, the great, the great,

474
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:49,920
 which, the Kuneiform, yeah, and I was, I was behind the scenes with him at the museum, and he

475
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:55,920
 showed me a sort of a cast of the of the tablet, the Kuneiform Noah's Ark tablet that he used to

476
00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:00,800
 study because he actually studied it further, decoded certain aspects of it that had not been seen

477
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:05,440
 before, which was the actual measurements from Noah's Ark and they recreated it, which is amazing.

478
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:09,840
 But while we were sitting there in the very beginning of our meeting, he suddenly got an email

479
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:15,600
 and jumped up from a seat and he went quick, run, and we ran through the corridor. I was chasing him.

480
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:19,120
 - He didn't make it at the time. - No, we're all, all because of him. - He's in the nippers and he bearded

481
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:26,240
 individual all the way through. - Yeah, so what it looks wonderful. But so he sort of ran down the corridor

482
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:30,240
 and then he cut into the kitchen and we stopped, what happened? And he said there's just

483
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:35,040
 been an announcement, there's orange juice in the fridge for any member of a sack. And so you've got

484
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:40,080
 to be quick, everyone gets to it before I do. And we quickly had two cups and went back into his room.

485
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:45,120
 So that is classic academic everyone. I first went to Cambridge to do an interview at Cambridge.

486
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:49,920
 I saw these two old dons in black gowns and I thought I'll follow them and I'll hear them talking about

487
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:56,080
 Aristotle or something really, really intellectual. And one of them was saying, "No, no, it comes in a

488
00:45:56,080 --> 00:46:03,360
 small packet about the size of a single play record, a 45 RPM record. And it's full of community

489
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:09,200
 little pieces that come to life when you pour boiling water in them. And I assure you, it's singularly

490
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:16,800
 toothed. A chicken noodle. The company is called Nor with a K, a silent K. And that's what they were

491
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:21,760
 talking about. I was thinking, "Wow, that's not what I expected." But it was very pleasing as I thought.

492
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:26,720
 But so this academic, what was it, do you, do you know his name? - George Smith. - Yes.

493
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:33,200
 And was it the cognitive dissonance isn't quite the way? Was it the shock that the Bible might not

494
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:38,880
 story might not be true or that it is true, but not as the Bible tells it? - It's confusing because

495
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:43,520
 he was pleased. Whereas I would have thought, yes, I was shocking, but I think it was almost like good,

496
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:49,600
 this is verifying that the Bible was the truth perhaps. - He was obsessed with his tablets. - Yes.

497
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:55,680
 - Because of course the Greeks also run the same time they had a flood, myth, dukele, and imperial. - Yes.

498
00:46:55,680 --> 00:47:01,040
 And the same thing, they had a wooden chest, it's called in, the way it's translated, but he might

499
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:05,200
 as well be called an ark, because an ark is a chest as much as it is anything else. The ark of

500
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:12,000
 the covenant is a chest after all, it's a strange word. And so the dukele and imperial was the daughter

501
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:17,600
 of Pandora, the first woman. So it's a very early thing that mankind displeased the gods and they

502
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:22,800
 sent the flood. And dukele and imperial survived because they were warned about it. And then when

503
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:28,400
 they landed, it wasn't on, well we think now, Mount Ararat, the supposedly the ark landed,

504
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:32,800
 they said many people believed Noah's Ark was a Mount Ararat, but it landed somewhere in, and

505
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:37,600
 they were told by Athena, I think it was, they were told to throw the bones of their mother over

506
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:41,920
 their shoulders. And they didn't know what that meant. And they were very confused. They said,

507
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:45,840
 "Oh, the bones of my mother, it's the stones of the mother earth." So they threw stones and

508
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:50,320
 whatever, pure, threw a stone over her shoulder, a woman sprang up out of the ground and wherever,

509
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:55,040
 to carry in a man's sprang up. So it's always one of those, you know, auto-ethonic stories.

510
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:59,760
 - But you don't want to take that literally, actually. - But it's a similar thing of a punishment,

511
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:07,680
 and the Philemon and Bauchist stories also gather with another flood. And so they exist, you know,

512
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:12,000
 at least two versions in Greek myth. Many others in other Mediterranean myths, it's Sumerian,

513
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:17,600
 Akkadian, Babylonian, I think. - I mean, I think these guys stole a lot from the Babylonians,

514
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:20,720
 in fact, the Assyrian, so they probably got it. But yeah, they all have been passed down

515
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:25,040
 for one or another. - Is it like that 5,000 BC? Was it when there was all those civilizations,

516
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:31,600
 the Mayans, and all these cities, something were evacuated. These great, there seems to have been a plague

517
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:38,320
 that was common across early civilizations. - How amazing is that? It's passed down. - Yes, and of course,

518
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:43,840
 yeah, that's so... - But this myth is particularly bizarre. So this is how the Assyrian

519
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:48,000
 myth had it in the Library of Nineveh when they found it. And I didn't realize this is in the

520
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:54,480
 epic of Gilgamesh, so the very famous discovery, my famous discovery that was made there. And the belief,

521
00:48:54,480 --> 00:49:00,560
 the story as it was told was that there was this huge flood. And before the flood, then God had

522
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:04,720
 delivered all his messages to people via these fish, these weird fish creatures. So they were right

523
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:09,120
 near the Persian Gulf, and the idea was these huge fish creatures used to come out of the Persian

524
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:13,520
 Gulf in the day, and they'd go and they'd tell the Assyrians what to do. They'd be like, don't drink that,

525
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:19,360
 be nice to your mum, et cetera. And then this huge flood came, and it basically poisoned the

526
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:23,680
 fish creatures, so they never came back. And after the flood, there was lots of disease because it,

527
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:27,360
 you know, floods will cause disease. And it was thought that was part of the God's punishment.

528
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:33,040
 From that moment on, the God stopped visiting them with these fish creatures. And so, yeah,

529
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:36,560
 that was the thing, and that was why he had to have human scholars, who were the ones who then

530
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:40,320
 received messages from the God's via strange, critical ways. - And in the Hebrew myth as well,

531
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:45,680
 it's the same thing that God provides a rainbow at the end of the, as a covenant, that he will not

532
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:51,280
 interfere again. So it also marks the slight withdrawal of God from the people of Israel,

533
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:56,640
 these chosen people, at that moment, that he's more distant from a few prophets. - It's like a show

534
00:49:56,640 --> 00:50:04,320
 creator handing over, you know, it's like Russell T. Davis to Stephen Moffert. - So is the vibe not,

535
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:08,320
 all right, fine, is that's how you want to do it? I'll leave you to it. Is it a bitter kind of God

536
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:11,920
 saying, fine, whatever, get on with it then. - There's still some things that are punished,

537
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:18,560
 and in the same way that the real punishment is a transgression of Zenia in Greek mythology,

538
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:23,360
 which is the guest friendship, and you honor you as a host to a stranger who comes to your door,

539
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:29,040
 and that that's really what the story of Philemon about this is about, and that's why they're

540
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:34,080
 visiting with a flood because everyone in the village turns away Zeus and Hermes, who appear as

541
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:38,160
 travelers, except these old couple who welcome them, and that actually is closer to the story of

542
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:43,840
 Latin, his wife, in the sins, you know, the city of the plain, the Sodom and Gomorrah. If you remember,

543
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:48,960
 angels come, you're looking puzzled as if you haven't read the Bible, maybe, and but... - From Tabbat,

544
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:51,920
 many times. - That famous goal is the way to do it, isn't it?

545
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:57,840
 You certainly have heard of Sodom and Gomorrah, and what happens is angels come, go to sort of,

546
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:02,400
 they hear about what wicked city the cities of the plain are, at the bottom of the Dead Sea.

547
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:06,880
 There's still sea signs when you travel down the road that Jordan sings, Sodom, that way,

548
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:15,120
 very pleasing, but anyway, yeah, the angels arrived, and were treated very, very rudely, and even more

549
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:21,520
 rudely by one particular citizen of Sodom, who wanted to know the angel, and that is where the phrase

550
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:25,600
 to know them in the biblical sense comes from. In other words, he tried to seduce this angel,

551
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:29,760
 and Sodomy, Sodomite, and the whole idea that Sodom was this place, because of that one reference

552
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:35,280
 in the Bible of someone who wanted to know the angel, and they punished the city with Philemon,

553
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:41,600
 and except for the holy couple, just like Duke Daniel and Berkes who were, I mean Philemon,

554
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:47,840
 who were a lot and his wife, and they were allowed to, but they mustn't look back, and it was exactly

555
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:52,880
 the same in the Greek myth. - There's no news stories, they're all boys, didn't we? - He said

556
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:57,760
 that they have the rainbow at the end of Noah's eyes. - Yes, he sends that as a covenant, doesn't he?

557
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:03,520
 - Yeah, he then, according to Genesis, he began to be a husbandman and planted a vineyard.

558
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:10,400
 - Noah's vineyard, yes. - Yeah, he then drank wine, and was drunken, and he was uncovered within his tent,

559
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:14,960
 so he basically, once he finished, he got drunken, got naked. - That's what you do. - Well,

560
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:20,000
 you see finally a story in the Bible to which everyone, you know, they've done a Noah.

561
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:25,440
 - You know the fish creature that you're talking about, so I'm going off memory here, but

562
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:31,600
 depictions I've seen of it is, it's a sort of reverse mermaid, it's a fish head with legs, so it was

563
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:36,720
 a partial human-based thing, and it's used as those ancient alien kind of things, that was a higher

564
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:43,520
 knowledge that was coming to educate and create these amazing civilizations at the time. Yeah,

565
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:47,440
 no one keen on that minor chat, great, all right? - No, no, no, something is a fish man.

566
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:54,880
 It's interesting, though, because, of course, all the evangelists who became part of the temperance

567
00:52:54,880 --> 00:53:00,400
 movement at the end of the 19th century believed everything in the Bible, but they had to,

568
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:05,280
 they had to rule out wine, and wine is unquestionably approved of, throughout the Bible, not only is

569
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:11,040
 Noah the first example of it, but Christ's first miracle is turning water into wine at the wedding

570
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:15,680
 in Canaan, so it is clear, and indeed, obviously, the last supper and everything that becomes so,

571
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:20,960
 it's quite difficult to believe in all the Bible, but decide that alcohol is terrible.

572
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:25,200
 - Yeah, really vindicated. - Well, there's some translations where they changed it to grape juice,

573
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:30,400
 but problems like that, yeah. - Yes, that's it. - That's what kind of a boy you'd have to be to make the

574
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:38,160
 Bible less sexy. - Very well. - Well, having to talk to these people. - This guy, George Smith,

575
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:43,280
 who decided to come here, so he's an amazing guy, because he left education at the age of 14.

576
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:49,680
 He became an engraver of banknotes at the Bank of England, so as a result, he had an incredible

577
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:54,960
 eye. He could detect incredible details in banknotes that he was engraving, that other people

578
00:53:54,960 --> 00:54:02,720
 couldn't spot, and also he was obsessed with these canary form tablets. So he, firstly, you know,

579
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:08,880
 he delivered this lecture saying the Noah's Ark story is a Hebrew adaptation of a much older story,

580
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:13,280
 which created huge controversy because it was quite soon after on the origin of species.

581
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:17,920
 It was another way of... - And geology was also doing its damages to undermine

582
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:23,920
 him. - Yes. - What, yes, was it Ruskin called those damned hammers, chipping away at every truth that

583
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:29,200
 was understood. - So he was kind of a controversial figure, but then the amazing thing was in this

584
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:33,840
 tablet that he had translated of the Noah's Ark story, there was a section that was missing.

585
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:39,600
 There were about 17 lines that were missing from the tablet just ended there, and the daily

586
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:45,600
 telegraph offered a thousand guineas to whoever found this missing 11 lines of canary form tablet,

587
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:49,760
 obviously with him in mind, because he was the expert, he knew all about it, and he went there,

588
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:56,400
 he went to what is now Mosul, which is where the library... - The library. - Yeah, and it was where

589
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:03,120
 the library had been of King Sinacarib, is that it? - Was it Ashabhanepal? - Sorry, Ashabhanepal.

590
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:07,840
 Where the Library of King Ashabhanepal had been, and he got to the site of the library.

591
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:12,400
 It was a huge site, it was about three miles across the whole city, and so it was like looking for a,

592
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:17,680
 you know, really was needle in haystack stuff. He looked, and he went to the pit of the old libraries,

593
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:21,920
 the likeliest place he'd find it, and he found it had been used as a quarry, and it was a complete

594
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:27,920
 mess of rubble, you know, different fragments from all over all different centuries, but he started

595
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:33,520
 looking, and the amazing thing was he found it, he found a tiny... - He must have never. Only he could have

596
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:38,240
 found it. - Yeah, exactly. He found the 17 lines which completed the Noah's Ark story,

597
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:44,720
 and he brought it back. - Did they see a naked man running back out of the quarry? - Wow. - Fabulous.

598
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:50,400
 - Yeah. - Imagine that feeling. - Wow. - Yeah. - And also, that's kind of a nice mirroring of

599
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:55,120
 actually what happened in terms of collecting the information for the library at the time,

600
00:55:55,120 --> 00:56:00,720
 so in the Assyrian culture. So this is like 3,000 years ago, and Ashabhanepal wanted to collect all

601
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:05,760
 human knowledge ever at that point, and he'd collect all these tablets, and when and got scholars

602
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:09,600
 to write them, and if there was something missing, he'd say, "Oh, there's this story that I've heard

603
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:14,160
 about and I don't have it." He'd put a call out to everyone in his kingdom, saying, "Everyone go hunting."

604
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:18,320
 So all the Assyrians knew what he was looking for, and they'd be a reward, and they'd just go scouting

605
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:22,720
 out for it. - And it's one of the biggest kind of kingdoms that had ever existed, right? It was

606
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:28,080
 all of North Africa and all of the Middle East, all the way across to New York. - Yeah, it was huge.

607
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:31,600
 - And Sinecrum was after him all before him. - Before him was his father, I think. - He was destroyed,

608
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:36,400
 because that famous Byron poem, isn't it, "The destruction of Sinecrum?" The Assyrian came down like a wolf

609
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:42,720
 on the fold, and his girls were shining in Scarleton gold. - Oh, really? How was he, what he was killed?

610
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:46,640
 - That's called the destruction of Sinecrum, I think. - Oh, really? - Someone listening one, though.

611
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:54,080
 - Aren't the Assyrians named after Noah's grandson? - Is it Assyrian? - Oh, grand son, yeah. - Assyrian.

612
00:56:54,080 --> 00:57:00,320
 - Is that one of the tribes, isn't it? - Yeah, Assyrian, and that's where Assyrian comes from.

613
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:03,680
 - So there's... - Well, she's from Shem, of course.

614
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:09,360
 - She might. So, and as in Haam Shem, and if you're anti-Semitic,

615
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:13,280
 it technically means you don't like Arabs as much as anything, because they are

616
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:19,280
 before the split between Abraham and Ishmael, who were the patriarchs of the two different

617
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:24,480
 peoples. There was Abraham and Ishmael. Ishmael went out and founded the Arab people, as it were.

618
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:32,240
 - And Abraham was the patriarch of the Jewish people. - So you're even more prejudiced than you

619
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:36,000
 actually thought? - Yeah, it's just they were anti-Semitic. - Yeah, they also had,

620
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:40,480
 with the Kineiform tablet, something interesting. They were used constantly, so they

621
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:44,880
 wouldn't fire them and make them a solid, because they wanted to reuse them. So once a tablet had

622
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:49,200
 been read, they could remold it and make it better. But what that meant was, if they were ever

623
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:53,600
 attacked the Assyrians, and let's say their places were burnt down, by burning down their

624
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:58,240
 libraries, they were actually preserving their information, because the clay would be fired up.

625
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:01,280
 - Baked? - Yes. - So they would bake the information, indeed.

626
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:05,200
 - That's the whole reason, the whole library, and the reason it survives, is because of that,

627
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:09,280
 it's such a funny irony. And it's such a good thing, because the Assyrians were eventually taken

628
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:15,680
 down by the Babylonians, and I think it's like from the Iranian area, the current Iranian,

629
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:20,880
 the needs, and the Babylonians. - Needs, yes. - Needs. Needs. Needs and Persians with the two groups

630
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:26,480
 that made up the government run as in Dorothy Parker's famous remark. - One man's meat is another man's

631
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:32,560
 Persian. - Oh, well, maybe she'd argue with, I think, I can't remember who was saying this,

632
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:36,640
 but the needs weren't particularly cultured. So the Babylonians would have taken these tablets and

633
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:40,560
 preserved them and gone, oh my god, this is learning. But the needs just weren't solid, let's burn

634
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:44,320
 the whole thing down. And then ironically, they managed by doing that to complete preserve them

635
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:50,640
 forever. So in your face. - They're so revealing, aren't they, about what it is to be human,

636
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:56,400
 because like almost all ancient forms of writing, 95% of it is taxation and accounting,

637
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:02,800
 and storage of grain. But then you get this fabulous bit, the bit that Irving Finkel is so excited

638
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:08,080
 by the children's, the equivalent of the exercise book, where you have the little clay tablet that he

639
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:14,400
 has in the British Museum, which you can go and see, which are children writing insults about

640
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:19,200
 their teachers, because that's their practicing. I mean, it's just delicious, it's so good. - Real

641
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:23,520
 insight, it's just fun. - Yeah, there is one story, which I haven't found any, I've found it in one

642
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:29,120
 source only, and it's, so I think it's not true, but it's of a clay bottle, and there was an apprentice

643
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:34,320
 at the British Museum who would not rest until he had deciphered this inscription on the bottle,

644
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:41,520
 and it turned out to be, please replace, stop it in bottle. - 90% sure it's a joke. - That's like that

645
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:53,040
 wooden post that had toti emel esto written on it, four letter words, toti emel e-m-u-l esto,

646
00:59:53,040 --> 01:00:00,560
 and but look at this, it sort looks Latin, you know, simul is so white emel, but esto is not quite right,

647
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:06,480
 late Latin, maybe pig Latin might have esto, toti all something, and at some point I said no,

648
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:20,160
 it's toti emel esto. - Okay, it is time for our final

649
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:25,680
 fact of the show, and that is James. - Okay, my fact this week is that the rarest frog in England

650
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:34,160
 has a distinctive Norfolk accent. - Very pleasant now. - I heard birds having local

651
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:41,280
 accents. - Yeah, well actually I'm sure you can tell us about the California Western literal frog.

652
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:46,720
 - Oh, the one which you hear in Hollywood. - Yeah, the only frog that I dig was rivet. - Because it

653
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:50,880
 was used by sound recorders to do backgrounds for the jungle and everything wasn't it. - Is that right?

654
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:55,040
 - I think I saw that on cue. - I think it was on cue. - That's my memory.

655
01:00:55,040 --> 01:01:04,000
 - So this is the northern pull frog. It was extinct in England, in Norfolk, and they found out

656
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:11,840
 doing 10 years of research that they had this distinctive call, which is common to the Norfolk area.

657
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:18,080
 It's a unique accent, and that and some genetics made them realize that it was endemic to Norfolk,

658
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:21,760
 which meant that they could bring it back, and they've just recently put it back into some

659
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:26,320
 pools in Norfolk. - Wonderful in the broads or the fins, presumably. - Yeah, in the broads, yeah.

660
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:30,800
 - Very satisfied. - And does it bear any resemblance to the human Norfolk accent?

661
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:36,960
 - It's just a slightly deeper ribbit. - One single comment about it being fond of its

662
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:43,600
 sister the most from God, and I will be very cross indeed. - So humans can tell if frogs are

663
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:50,480
 excited or not, this is a really interesting thing. So humans can tell basically if almost all

664
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:55,120
 vertebrates really are excited or not. So this was an experiment done by scientists. They played

665
01:01:55,120 --> 01:02:00,640
 recordings of aroused and non-aroused frogs, and aroused just means... - Not exactly in some way.

666
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:06,560
 - Yeah, exactly. - And this was people who spoke different languages as well. So I think some

667
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:12,080
 English and some Mandarin and some of a third language, and 90% of them could tell which the

668
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:17,760
 aroused ones were. And the reason that we think this is is because we think there are universal

669
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:24,080
 vocal elements. So when we're excited or as it's, we speak higher and faster, and frogs do the

670
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:29,600
 same thing. So we think there are vocal signals that are the same, even in different taxa,

671
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:35,920
 which is really interesting. - But frogs are a sort of index species, all kinds of the health of

672
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:40,240
 wetlands and everything, and tens of thousands of, and there's a runny,

673
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:46,560
 whatever it is, a runny form virus at the moment that's threatening from everywhere.

674
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:50,800
 - Yeah, really? - They're really sad, yeah. - Yeah, they're all dying out. - Everything is.

675
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:56,400
 - And also, we're running out of ponds. - Yes, in the UK. - Let alone natural wetlands,

676
01:02:56,400 --> 01:03:00,320
 the good old suburban ones, you mean? - Yeah, there are half as many ponds in the UK

677
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:05,680
 than the wet 50 years ago. Norfolk has lost 8,000 ponds since the 1950s. - Have you

678
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:10,240
 know my parents have a pond in Norfolk? - It does have frogs. - It does have frogs, and it

679
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:14,000
 frogs born, and it's always rather amazing, and they try and protect the frogs born from the various

680
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:18,960
 predators that like to eat it. - But if you combine two ponds into one large a pond, you have

681
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:23,440
 technically destroyed a pond. - So is it possible there are... - It made the lake. - It's just one

682
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:28,240
 massive lake. - I know it seems unlikely. - I don't think that's what's happened. I don't think Norfolk

683
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:33,680
 is now one huge lake, and no other ponds. - Well, when I was a boy, you definitely, I mean, it sort

684
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:36,800
 of hurts you, I don't know my brother and I have yet, nothing better to do. We'd go and hunt for

685
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:41,280
 sticklebacks and mutes, and all those sort of creatures. - Well, every village would have a pond,

686
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:44,400
 and most farms would have a pond, because it's where you would get your water from, and that's right.

687
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:50,640
 - Yes, yes. - Like a titty-ditty bang bang one, you know, one that truly scrumptious gets stuck in a car,

688
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:55,600
 that sort of one, you know, ducks, and... - Was it in Norfolk, where there's that myth about a lake,

689
01:03:55,600 --> 01:04:00,640
 where the reflection of the moon is in it, and the myth was that they used to tell visitors to

690
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:04,240
 the area that they've been trying to catch that big white thing in the middle of the lake for years,

691
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:07,920
 and they should have a go, because they just couldn't get it, and it was their trick they played,

692
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:15,200
 - It was like it's a wheelchair. - And wheelchair... - I thought it was an impotator, but it was harder. - I thought it was a samasatch. - Sure, sure.

693
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:18,640
 - One of those ones, in which you have a gun, do you have to be doing it? - Yeah.

694
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:25,760
 - Don't confuse Norfolk with the language with Norfolk, which is N-O-R-F-U-K, which is a language

695
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:31,760
 spoken on Norfolk Island. - Oh, would you do that? - Oh, just off-Australia, yeah. - In the Pacific, yeah.

696
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:37,520
 - Yeah. - And it's a blend of 18th century English and Tahitian. - Is that right? - That sounds good, doesn't it? - Yeah.

697
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:42,640
 - And you don't confuse it. Do you think people are showing up? - Yeah, they're going, "Hey, got light bulb?"

698
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:48,320
 - That's the wrong action for a honorable city. - Do you know where you can find a Norfolk accent,

699
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:54,160
 not in Norfolk, is in parts of New England, because so when the Pilgrim Fathers went over and say

700
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:58,880
 they're a lot of them are from East Anglia, a lot from Norfolk, and there are certain quirks of

701
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:03,920
 the accent, New England accent, that are only seen in Norfolk, so I think, and a few phrases.

702
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:11,680
 One of them was good on you, apparently. Good on you. Another one was, "How much did you give for it?"

703
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:16,080
 As opposed to, "How much did you pay for it?" Which apparently is a quintessentially Norfolk thing.

704
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:19,360
 - And the "do you," the, I don't know what that sort of aggressive present is really peculiar,

705
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:24,720
 when the "do you" not as a question, but as an invitation or even a command, "do you sit down?"

706
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:27,920
 Meaning, "sit down." - Yeah, that's weird. - "Do you come in? Do you come in? All you

707
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:34,160
 must be cold, do you come in?" That just means "come in." All there's "do" meaning "if," which is

708
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:38,720
 a very strange Norfolk thing, say, "You want to come in? Do you get cold?" - Really?

709
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:44,960
 "The "do" means "if you don't." - Oh, wow. The "lest." - Yeah. Yeah, my sister's

710
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:48,960
 nanny was sort of sort of Norfolk, and she I used to do it in Raichelle, or no, not really,

711
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:53,680
 she was only, but, you know, sort of teaser and things like that. And "don't," she said, "you

712
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:57,840
 stop having "do I'll tell your father? Do I'll tell your father?" - Oh, really? - It was really, really

713
01:05:57,840 --> 01:06:02,480
 extraordinary. - I read a really funny blog on the British Library website, so the British Library

714
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:06,560
 have done this amazing thing, which is they want to preserve dialects before they'll disappear,

715
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:11,200
 so they've got loads of volunteers over the last few years to go and record things that they say

716
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:15,760
 in their own local dialect, and they've kept these recordings, so you can go online, it's brilliant.

717
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:21,200
 Go to it, it's called the Evolving English Word Bank, but it's really great. The only problem

718
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:25,040
 with it is the kind of people who are going around the British Library and volunteering stuff.

719
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:28,400
 You can tell when you listen to the recordings, they're not the kind of people who are using the

720
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:34,160
 street slang of the modern day. So you have, like, a listen to one, it's so good. It's this, obviously,

721
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:40,880
 really extra-learned, nervous sounding nerdy old man. It says, "I've got two examples of words

722
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:46,800
 I'd like preserved that are used by pupils at a school in Oxford, where I'm from. The first word

723
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:56,560
 is bear, spelled B-A-R-E, which now means a lot, and the second word is jokes, that is jokes,

724
01:06:56,560 --> 01:07:03,680
 which is now used as a word meaning fun." And then he gave an example. He said, "So a pupil in school

725
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:09,280
 recently wrote, 'I am a seed.' He was learning about germination. I am a seed, and when it's winter,

726
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:14,480
 I don't sprout because there's bear snow on the ground, but if I wait until it's warm,

727
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:21,360
 everything will be jokes." And it's just if that's what's preserved as how people are using bear

728
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:27,840
 and jokes in the future. There is an amazing book, which this is more just for people listening right

729
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:34,480
 now, Susie Dent. Oh, wonderful. Yeah, she wrote this song. Yeah, she wrote fantastic book recently,

730
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:40,800
 which was she went to every sort of, she went to hang out with builders and people who work in

731
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:46,560
 transport, and the current slang being used by all of them, she documented down in this book. So

732
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:51,600
 it's sort of fresh slang, preserving a time. It's a really beautiful book for her. Very important

733
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:59,200
 that. I love books on thieves canton and those sort of slangs of the 17th century and onwards.

734
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:05,760
 And I want to just memorialize the great Dennis Norton, because you reminded me of a story he told you,

735
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:11,360
 you remember the great comic writer and who died in his late 90s, just recently, he told me this

736
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:16,000
 famous story when he was at school. He had a very good English teacher, very advanced for his

737
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:24,960
 damn, and this is way back in the 20s and 30s, I guess. And he said, right, we're going to do re-enforced

738
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:30,160
 meaning class and then we're going to re-enforced what some people say. London, it's a pretty poor

739
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:36,560
 ordinary school in the East End, where Dennis grew up. And he said, I'll illustrate this by telling

740
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:42,720
 a story of these two road builders, Navis, you know, and one of them sees a poster on the wall and it says,

741
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:47,200
 "One man, one vote." He goes, "What's that about?" And his mate says, "What do you mean to me? It's

742
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:51,840
 one man, one vote, isn't it?" He said, "Well, I don't get it. One man, one vote." How does that?

743
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:57,920
 I don't say that. I mean, you got one man? You got one vote. No, no, I still don't get it.

744
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:01,520
 "One fucking man, one fucking vote." Oh!

745
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:14,480
 "Good way to seem cool in front of your pupils, telling that story. As soon as you drop a swear word as a

746
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:20,160
 teacher, you've got that respect." Well done. Because every generation thinks they've invented it.

747
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:24,320
 Yes. That's the extraordinary thing. We knew the idea that one's grandfather was saying

748
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:28,880
 that the F word "all the time" in the trenches, which I remember being so shocked by, and I read

749
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:34,320
 "Goodbye to all that," you know, the rubber graves. And he thought he'd heard all the swearing he could

750
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:39,520
 ever hear at school, you know, in the showers, after the rugby game. And then he said the first moment,

751
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:45,680
 he was, you know, training with other cadets and listening to NCOs and Sarge and Simon,

752
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:52,400
 he'd just never imagine people would swear that much. And of course that's, you don't see that,

753
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:55,360
 because it's a sanitized version, just as you didn't see them wiping their bottoms and

754
01:09:55,360 --> 01:10:01,360
 we got better things to do, obviously. But it is important to remember, because certainly some of

755
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:05,360
 my generation thinks the First World War has one's grandfather's generation. Obviously most people

756
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:10,320
 listening are far too young to that. They'd be your great-grandfathers, possibly even great-great-grandfathers.

757
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:14,880
 But I knew people, maybe at my school there were, there were people who fought in the First World War,

758
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:20,320
 and to my channel shame. I remember this man, Mr. Sorden, who shook his hands all the time and

759
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:27,120
 slightly gaped with his mouth, and he was the brother of the headmaster's wife. And he was,

760
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:32,640
 we teased him mercilessly. And then one day one of the masters said, "You do know, you want a

761
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:37,520
 military cross in the First World War." It was one of the bravest men he would ever meet. He was

762
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:43,360
 destroyed by watching a whole trench of his friends blown up in front of his eyes. I just remember thinking,

763
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:49,280
 "Oh dear, what was mocking him and doing his early imitating and trembling hands?" And so obviously

764
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:53,920
 you think of them as a very extraordinary generation, but you don't think of them as just like us. So what we

765
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:58,880
 do think that they did swear, they did live colorful lives as Pieds Piax and shows literally colorful

766
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:03,440
 in a sense. Yeah, that was brilliant, wasn't it? Pieds Jackson thing, I think we didn't see it. It's

767
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:10,640
 amazing when you see war suddenly with a blue sky. Yes, yes. So counterintuitive, you just thought

768
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:18,240
 it's going to be mucky and dark, but yeah, they fought on sunny days. We should wrap up shortly. We can.

769
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:22,480
 We can do one last thing. Go on, Andy, have you? Yeah, got a frog. It's a cool frog and I didn't want to

770
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:29,920
 imagine the frog. Have you heard of the northern spring peeper? No. No. Okay, so it's very cool. It's

771
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:38,640
 it lives in ponds and the temperature frequently drops below freezing problem, but the frog

772
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:45,040
 hibernates and it has a it has evolved a way to stay alive while it has frozen. The temperature

773
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:49,760
 inside it, if it gets to minus two or three Celsius, the frog can survive because the water inside

774
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:55,120
 it is super cool. So it's still liquid. If it gets any colder than that, it's still not a problem.

775
01:11:55,120 --> 01:12:01,360
 The water under the frog skin freezes and its stomach becomes a solid ball of ice. So about half

776
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:07,600
 the water inside the frog freezes. It can survive for a week like this and it's because, so normally

777
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:11,520
 the problem is you get ice crystals inside your cells and the cells rupture and you die. That's

778
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:18,560
 what happens. As soon as the ice crystals start to form inside the frog, the frog's liver goes

779
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:25,440
 into an emergency rapid response action. It produces a load of glucose in it. It spreads it

780
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:29,680
 throughout the body and it prevents the crystals forming in the cells. But the glucose levels in

781
01:12:29,680 --> 01:12:34,640
 its core organs shoot up 50 times as much. Wow. As soon as the first ice crystal forms, the frog

782
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:39,440
 liver goes, ah, we're freezing. Wow. React. Wonder if you get an alcoholic frog who's got liver

783
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:47,200
 damage, whether it's less good or fast. Incipient diabetes as well. Wow. Well, I'll, I mean,

784
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:51,520
 I've got a story to tell about a frog and it is your company's because it's really not very of a sound.

785
01:12:51,520 --> 01:13:00,560
 There's a librarian who's busy and she, a hen comes into the library and goes, boop,

786
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:07,440
 and a librarian thinks, okay, and grabs a book and gives it to her and the hen goes off and then

787
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:12,080
 the hen comes back really quick, you know, a few hours later and goes boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

788
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:16,400
 She gives her three books and two under one wing and one under the other and off goes the hen

789
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:21,040
 and then the hen comes back and goes boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop. And it dumps the three books

790
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:25,040
 that had been given and so she gives another six books and it's lunchtime in the library and

791
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:30,480
 I've got to see this extraordinary literary hen and follows it down the street, down the little

792
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:36,720
 alleyways and then up up into a door and the door's left open and so the librarian watches the hen

793
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:41,360
 with these books tucked under its wing, going all the way up to the top of the stairs and into a room,

794
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:45,920
 the door's closed but the librarian kneels down and looks through the keyhole and there on a bed

795
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:52,160
 is a frog with a little spotty bandage around its forehead and a thermometer in its mouth and the

796
01:13:52,160 --> 01:13:56,960
 hen takes the monadratum reads it and then hands the book to the frog and the frog says,

797
01:13:56,960 --> 01:14:00,160
 "Reddit." "Reddit." "Reddit." "Reddit."

798
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:04,160
 Oh that's a fantastic fact to end on.

799
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:06,560
 A new story.

800
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:11,680
 Okay that's it. That is all of our facts. Thank you so much for listening.

801
