00:00:08,00:00:13,[upbeat music]
00:00:13,00:00:18,"Hello and welcome to another episode of ""No Such Thing as a Fish"""
00:00:18,00:00:22,a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Brighton!
00:00:22,00:00:27,[cheering]
00:00:27,00:00:29,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:29,00:00:33,"I am sitting here with Anna Chazinski, Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin,"
00:00:33,00:00:37,and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts
00:00:37,00:00:41,"from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:41,00:00:43,"Starting with you, Andy."
00:00:43,00:00:49,My fact is that babies who live in London are more rude than babies from the West Midlands.
00:00:49,00:00:51,[laughing]
00:00:51,00:00:55,"So what do they, what do the London babies do?"
00:00:55,00:00:56,They come at you with a knife.
00:00:56,00:01:00,"They don't say ""thank you"" and they don't say ""sorry""."
00:01:00,00:01:05,"And this is a study by Liverpool University, which studied two and a half thousand babies."
00:01:05,00:01:11,"Sorry, it must be babies of a certain age because they don't think any like one month old babies say that's true."
00:01:11,00:01:14,It's all about the first words that they learn and it turns out that babies in London
00:01:14,00:01:19,"and Wales weirdly are least likely to include the word ""thank you"" among their first words."
00:01:19,00:01:23,"And normally babies are quite polite, as in the word ""sorry"" crops up quite a lot."
00:01:23,00:01:28,"Well they're always fucking up, so I'm not surprised."
00:01:28,00:01:33,"If I shut myself seven times a day, I'd apologise all the time as well."
00:01:33,00:01:35,[laughing]
00:01:35,00:01:36,Hang on.
00:01:36,00:01:38,They've not shat themselves.
00:01:38,00:01:42,"They haven't gone ""oh god, I am so sorry""."
00:01:42,00:01:45,They've just gone to the toilet.
00:01:45,00:01:47,That's what's showing yourself?
00:01:47,00:01:49,"No, that sounds like..."
00:01:49,00:01:52,"If I went to the toilet seven times a day, I wouldn't complain."
00:01:52,00:01:56,"No, when it's in your pants, it's shitting yourself."
00:01:56,00:01:58,My son doesn't say...
00:01:58,00:02:00,"And he's a Londoner, I guess."
00:02:00,00:02:02,What does he say?
00:02:02,00:02:04,"He says, ""No, like a lot""."
00:02:04,00:02:05,Wow.
00:02:05,00:02:07,"Yeah, you'll be like, ""Can I have a hug?"" No."
00:02:07,00:02:08,It's really cut me.
00:02:08,00:02:12,"Actually, ""No"" is one of the more common first words of babies."
00:02:12,00:02:16,"And there are quite a few babies, a high percentage who have no as the first word,"
00:02:16,00:02:19,say nothing else for the first three months.
00:02:19,00:02:21,"Pretty much they just say, ""No, no, no, no, no."
00:02:21,00:02:24,"Like Bohemian rap street."""
00:02:24,00:02:25,Or to a limited.
00:02:25,00:02:27,"They're just like, ""No, no, no."""
00:02:27,00:02:28,Wow.
00:02:28,00:02:29,"He just says, ""No."""
00:02:29,00:02:33,"He says, ""Mummy, daddy, and guys have shat myself, sorry."""
00:02:33,00:02:38,Do we know why this is the case?
00:02:38,00:02:39,Is there any...
00:02:39,00:02:40,And they're not we're doing other ways.
00:02:40,00:02:42,"They just don't like to say, ""Please, and thank you."""
00:02:42,00:02:43,"Yeah, they're not..."
00:02:43,00:02:46,I don't think that notice will be impolite in other ways.
00:02:46,00:02:48,"It's just, yeah, I don't know what the reason behind it is, actually."
00:02:48,00:02:50,"Presumably, their parents aren't teaching it to."
00:02:50,00:02:52,The more is it quite random what baby knows?
00:02:52,00:02:53,I don't know if you're going to say...
00:02:53,00:02:55,The first word is just a random word.
00:02:55,00:02:58,It's got to be a word you've heard before.
00:02:58,00:03:00,"I mean, they..."
00:03:00,00:03:02,So I would have assumed the baby's first word
00:03:02,00:03:04,or something the parents are attempting to teach them.
00:03:04,00:03:05,Exactly.
00:03:05,00:03:06,Or is it just something that the baby picks up?
00:03:06,00:03:07,It's from what they hear around them.
00:03:07,00:03:11,So it means that babies in London are not hearing those words as regularly.
00:03:11,00:03:12,I think that was a suggestion anyway.
00:03:12,00:03:15,"Other common first words, or early words at least,"
00:03:15,00:03:21,"include carrot, cake, doggie, quack, banana, and bird poo."
00:03:21,00:03:23,Oh.
00:03:23,00:03:24,Really?
00:03:24,00:03:27,Who's saying that a lot to their children?
00:03:27,00:03:28,Is that London-specific?
00:03:28,00:03:31,"I know that was in this study, it was all regular things."
00:03:31,00:03:34,"And another thing is that this is in all regions, actually."
00:03:34,00:03:37,One of the names that children are most likely to learn
00:03:37,00:03:41,after Mummy and Daddy is Pepper.
00:03:41,00:03:46,That's my son learnt that before he said Mummy and Daddy.
00:03:46,00:03:48,"I'm not lying, Pepper is..."
00:03:48,00:03:49,He loves Pepper.
00:03:49,00:03:50,He loves Pepper a lot.
00:03:50,00:03:52,"Yeah, Pepper is his hero."
00:03:52,00:03:53,Turneric is the other one.
00:03:53,00:03:55,"He says a lot, isn't it?"
00:03:55,00:04:00,That's a London baby all right.
00:04:00,00:04:06,"There's surprisingly clever babies, aren't they?"
00:04:06,00:04:09,They can count from extraordinarily young.
00:04:09,00:04:12,"So they can count at five months old to an extent,"
00:04:12,00:04:14,"which I find incredible, because if you look at a five-month old,"
00:04:14,00:04:16,they can barely move their head.
00:04:16,00:04:20,"And they're tiny, but there was this study done,"
00:04:20,00:04:23,"which basically showed five months old this screen on a stage,"
00:04:23,00:04:26,"there's a big screen on a stage, and then they took out a Mickey Mouse doll,"
00:04:26,00:04:28,"and they showed it to the kid, and then they put it behind the screen,"
00:04:28,00:04:30,"and they took out a second Mickey Mouse doll,"
00:04:30,00:04:34,"put that behind the screen, and then they lifted the screen up."
00:04:34,00:04:36,"And if there were two Mickey Mouse dolls there,"
00:04:36,00:04:39,"the kid was fine, looked away quite quickly."
00:04:39,00:04:41,"If there were three Mickey Mouse dolls there,"
00:04:41,00:04:43,"then the kid would stare at it for ages,"
00:04:43,00:04:45,which is the only way that we know if a baby is confused
00:04:45,00:04:47,"or surprised or anything, as they just stare for a long time,"
00:04:47,00:04:50,"because it's so confused, because it knows it's counted to,"
00:04:50,00:04:51,and you reveal three.
00:04:51,00:04:54,"On the thing about them being surprised and looking at things,"
00:04:54,00:04:59,"so this is why Peekaboo is such a great game for babies,"
00:04:59,00:05:01,"and for all of us, actually."
00:05:01,00:05:06,"No, so basically they are surprised when things,"
00:05:06,00:05:10,"they like sort of testing, there's a theory of object permanence,"
00:05:10,00:05:13,"which is that, you know, things are still there even when you can't see them."
00:05:13,00:05:16,"So even if you're hiding, when you appear again,"
00:05:16,00:05:20,it's sort of surprise and confirmation at the same time that you're correct.
00:05:20,00:05:26,"So babies laugh more in normal Peekaboo than they do in trial versions of Peekaboo,"
00:05:26,00:05:29,"where they add out hides, and then they reappear as a different person."
00:05:29,00:05:32,That's not funny to a baby.
00:05:32,00:05:36,They like Peekaboo because it's predictable.
00:05:36,00:05:41,"Okay, because they know that it's wrong if they're a different person."
00:05:41,00:05:45,"Exactly, so they're like sort of, yes, standard stuff."
00:05:45,00:05:48,"I also did not know that, so they'd love the big bank theory, for example,"
00:05:48,00:05:52,"because it's very basic, obvious stuff."
00:05:52,00:05:56,"The TV show, all the actual theory."
00:05:56,00:06:01,Very obvious.
00:06:01,00:06:04,Did you know that Peekaboo is a style of boxing?
00:06:04,00:06:07,It's a style of boxing where you put your hands in front of your face.
00:06:07,00:06:11,"Okay, and then do you whip your hands away and give the man a shot?"
00:06:11,00:06:13,"No, no, you're doing it, and then you whip your hands out of the way"
00:06:13,00:06:17,and it's Mike Tyson there instead.
00:06:17,00:06:20,It's not that you cover your eyes because obviously that's very bad boxing.
00:06:20,00:06:21,No.
00:06:21,00:06:24,"They're quite interpunching, actually, babies, aren't they?"
00:06:24,00:06:26,Or they can get quite aggressive.
00:06:26,00:06:31,So this was another study that was done about how our adult behaviour can impact
00:06:31,00:06:33,very young children's behaviour.
00:06:33,00:06:37,"And they did this experiment with really young kids, with like young toddlers."
00:06:37,00:06:43,"And what they did was they had some kids watch an adult beat up a punching bag clown,"
00:06:43,00:06:45,"you know, like a big toy clown."
00:06:45,00:06:47,So I would have loved to be in the adult in this experiment.
00:06:47,00:06:50,So the adult got to beat the crap out of this clown and then some other babies...
00:06:50,00:06:56,"You're not allowed back in McDonald's, are you?"
00:06:56,00:07:00,So there was another clown which didn't get beaten up where the adult just treated it nicely.
00:07:00,00:07:03,And there was another control group that did nothing.
00:07:03,00:07:06,"And the kids who'd seen an adult beating up the clown, not only did they then"
00:07:06,00:07:10,"when they were unleashed on the clown beat it to shreds, like really attacked it."
00:07:10,00:07:14,But they improvised new weapons out of whatever they could see.
00:07:14,00:07:18,To really try and make it so there was like a dark gun was left in the room
00:07:18,00:07:20,and there's some quite dramatic footage.
00:07:20,00:07:24,That's not improvising a weapon.
00:07:24,00:07:26,Picking up a dark gun.
00:07:26,00:07:32,"Yeah, they didn't build the dark gun out of a mop and an orange."
00:07:32,00:07:34,Maybe they did.
00:07:34,00:07:35,There was a dark gun in the corner of the room.
00:07:35,00:07:36,You can watch it on YouTube.
00:07:36,00:07:39,There's like a two-year-old kid who goes up to the clown and holds a dark gun
00:07:39,00:07:44,to his head and starts whispering scary stuff on his head.
00:07:44,00:07:45,That's the most...
00:07:45,00:07:49,"And then lots of people said, ""But it's okay, it's a punching bag clown, it's what they're for."""
00:07:49,00:07:52,"And so they repeated the experiment, but using a real person dressed as a clown"
00:07:52,00:07:54,and they'd also beat the crap out of him.
00:07:54,00:07:55,Really?
00:07:55,00:07:57,"Oh my god, that's amazing."
00:07:57,00:08:02,"Actually, on aggressiveness in children, I don't have kids, so I don't know if this is common."
00:08:02,00:08:08,But I was surprised to read that they often bang their head against the bed or the crib or the wall.
00:08:08,00:08:10,And they'll do this around six months of age.
00:08:10,00:08:14,Quite a lot of children will just start head-banging things.
00:08:14,00:08:17,"And apparently, the reason they do it can last up to 15 minutes."
00:08:17,00:08:20,And the reason they do it is it gives them a surge of adrenaline.
00:08:20,00:08:23,"Because if you get hurt, for instance, you get some adrenaline"
00:08:23,00:08:27,and then that helps them to sleep afterwards because they get the surge of adrenaline
00:08:27,00:08:29,and then it gives them a kind of a downer.
00:08:29,00:08:31,Apparently this is true.
00:08:31,00:08:32,They're like this.
00:08:32,00:08:35,"And from the reaction, I think it's not a common thing."
00:08:35,00:08:38,I've not seen my son do that.
00:08:38,00:08:41,"But apparently, because it is quite relatively..."
00:08:41,00:08:45,"It does happen, but whenever any parent sees it, they're like, holy fuck."
00:08:45,00:08:47,There's a thing that kids have.
00:08:47,00:08:48,I haven't got any research on this.
00:08:48,00:08:51,I just remember learning this at the time when I had my son.
00:08:51,00:08:56,"That kids at the beginning, they have no separation between what's..."
00:08:56,00:09:00,"Their vision is quite solid, so 3D objects are not so great."
00:09:00,00:09:04,But one of the things is perception of size is a thing that they don't fully get.
00:09:04,00:09:09,And then they hit a certain age where suddenly they realize that they're tiny and everyone else is massive.
00:09:09,00:09:11,And it freaks them out.
00:09:11,00:09:13,They're suddenly surrounded by giants.
00:09:13,00:09:16,And it's a really traumatising moment for kids.
00:09:16,00:09:20,So you can really take advantage of that moment when you...
00:09:20,00:09:28,"Well, there is this weird thing that we think that they see everything upside down at first."
00:09:28,00:09:29,Really?
00:09:29,00:09:30,Yeah.
00:09:30,00:09:33,So you know this is a thing where you see things upside down because that's the way the light hits your restaurant.
00:09:33,00:09:35,It hits it in the wrong... it hits it upside down.
00:09:35,00:09:38,And then your brain reverses the image and you see a correct image.
00:09:38,00:09:41,"But actually, the light enters your eyes and shows you an upside down image."
00:09:41,00:09:45,"So we think that before babies work out how to flip the images because they're idiots,"
00:09:45,00:09:49,they can't see the right way up for the first week of their life.
00:09:49,00:09:51,So everything is upside down for them.
00:09:51,00:09:52,That's crazy.
00:09:52,00:09:56,"And also they can do mirror-rising, which I only learned this recently."
00:09:56,00:09:58,"And to any parent, I think this is quite standard."
00:09:58,00:10:01,"I learned it from a parent who was like, ""Oh yeah, she's at a stage where she's doing mirror-riding."""
00:10:01,00:10:03,She was Australian.
00:10:03,00:10:07,"But to her, everything did look upside down because she was Australian."
00:10:07,00:10:08,True.
00:10:08,00:10:14,"But yeah, a lot of kids, toddler age, the natural way they write is proper mirror-riding,"
00:10:14,00:10:17,"like Leonardo da Vinci did, that we can't possibly do naturally as humans."
00:10:17,00:10:19,And then they just grow out of doing it.
00:10:19,00:10:20,You make kids that do this?
00:10:20,00:10:21,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:10:21,00:10:22,It's incredible.
00:10:22,00:10:23,That's crazy.
00:10:23,00:10:25,We're going to have to move on shortly to our next fact.
00:10:25,00:10:29,"I just, one small interesting thing, just on the idea of rudeness and babies,"
00:10:29,00:10:33,"in Thailand, because of superstitions, there's a common thing that's done,"
00:10:33,00:10:36,which is you never say that a newborn baby is beautiful.
00:10:36,00:10:38,You always call it ugly.
00:10:38,00:10:43,"So for the first, it's the idea that by calling them ugly ghosts would be scared away and so on."
00:10:43,00:10:48,"And yeah, so for the first few weeks of a baby's life, they're just being called but ugly."
00:10:48,00:10:50,"In the Philippines, is that?"
00:10:50,00:10:51,"No, that was in Thailand."
00:10:51,00:10:52,Thailand.
00:10:52,00:10:54,"I don't know if it happened in Hong Kong, because I used to get called."
00:10:54,00:10:56,Definitely happened in Bolton.
00:10:56,00:10:59,I was a genuinely ugly baby.
00:10:59,00:11:04,"And one of my best friends, her mum, came to see me, first person to see me after I was born."
00:11:04,00:11:06,And she tells me the story now.
00:11:06,00:11:10,"She said, I just couldn't bring myself to even find the words to say that you were in any way beautiful."
00:11:10,00:11:12,"Or you were just, you were just so ugly."
00:11:12,00:11:19,"And the first thing that was said about me was she looked me went, oh, how interesting."
00:11:19,00:11:22,And then you worked for the company quite interesting.
00:11:22,00:11:24,That's how it all began.
00:11:24,00:11:25,In her face.
00:11:25,00:11:29,"Just on, another thing on rudeness and how rudeness can affect us."
00:11:29,00:11:33,So there's lots of studies that are done that have shown that it's extremely infectious
00:11:33,00:11:35,in a way that we can totally understand.
00:11:35,00:11:40,"Because what it does is if someone's rude to you, it takes a lot of mental energy to respond to that."
00:11:40,00:11:44,"It's quite draining, working out your impulse control and not punching them in the face."
00:11:44,00:11:47,"And then you become weaker, your impulses come weaker."
00:11:47,00:11:50,So therefore you're then rude to the next person.
00:11:50,00:11:55,"And it's to the extent that, and it really damages our mental faculties in various other ways."
00:11:55,00:11:57,So it also makes us stupider.
00:11:57,00:12:02,"So as soon as someone's rude to you, it makes you stupid to the extent that if you even read words"
00:12:02,00:12:04,that sound like they're rude.
00:12:04,00:12:09,So there was a study where people were asked to read the words interrupt obnoxious and bother.
00:12:09,00:12:11,I don't know how rude that is.
00:12:11,00:12:15,"But after that, they performed five times worse on a mental task."
00:12:15,00:12:19,"So I have fewer to read, for instance, the Daily Mail."
00:12:19,00:12:20,Yeah.
00:12:20,00:12:23,Or watch a Winnie the Pooh episode.
00:12:23,00:12:24,Is that rude?
00:12:24,00:12:26,"Oh, bother."
00:12:28,00:12:32,"Okay, we need to move on to our second fact of the show."
00:12:32,00:12:33,And that is my fact.
00:12:33,00:12:40,"My fact this week is in 17th century Japan, the super rich would protect their homes from burglars"
00:12:40,00:12:43,by installing musical floorboards.
00:12:43,00:12:47,So like the piano and big.
00:12:47,00:12:48,Yeah.
00:12:48,00:12:50,"No, this is not quite that."
00:12:50,00:12:52,These were called nightingale floors.
00:12:52,00:12:56,"And the idea was that they worked out that in Japan,"
00:12:56,00:12:59,"if you had a palace and you were worried about, let's say,"
00:12:59,00:13:03,"you're at the head of the palace being murdered by ninjas or anyone good at creeping in,"
00:13:03,00:13:06,what you would do is you would have creaky floorboards.
00:13:06,00:13:11,And the creaky floorboards were alert everyone to the fact that someone was there.
00:13:11,00:13:15,"Now, some people just have creaky floorboards, but these were specifically designed"
00:13:15,00:13:17,and they were very expensive to install.
00:13:17,00:13:21,And what it was was underneath the floorboard that was a nail that went along a bracket.
00:13:21,00:13:25,And it produced a frequency sound that sounded a lot like a nightingale singing a song.
00:13:25,00:13:26,The bird.
00:13:26,00:13:28,The nightingale bird.
00:13:28,00:13:29,You can see clips on YouTube.
00:13:29,00:13:32,I was opposed to the Victorian dance.
00:13:32,00:13:36,[Laughter]
00:13:36,00:13:38,"Like, they were all confused."
00:13:38,00:13:40,[Laughter]
00:13:40,00:13:41,Some global clarified.
00:13:41,00:13:42,"Yeah, so it was really cool."
00:13:42,00:13:49,And my favorite thing about this whole fact is obviously there are people patrolling the grounds of the palace.
00:13:49,00:13:50,So what did they do?
00:13:50,00:13:52,Because they need to walk over these floorboards.
00:13:52,00:13:58,So what they ended up doing was agreeing on a system of rhythm that would effectively be playing a song as you walked.
00:13:58,00:14:02,"And if they heard the rhythm, they'd be like, oh, it's Mike, you know, as opposed to..."
00:14:02,00:14:03,"Oh, wow."
00:14:03,00:14:04,That's clever.
00:14:04,00:14:08,They have in Japan quite exciting sort of burglar defenders even today.
00:14:08,00:14:13,"They have in shops, modern day shops in Japan often have this bright orange sphere"
00:14:13,00:14:15,that's next to the till if you're buying something.
00:14:15,00:14:17,"And what it actually is, it's a paintball."
00:14:17,00:14:21,And they're trained as shopkeepers in Japan to throw this paintball at someone
00:14:21,00:14:22,if they try to rob the shop.
00:14:22,00:14:27,"And the idea is that it will leave this mark on them, and then they'll be identifiable."
00:14:27,00:14:29,So just look for the guy covered in orange paint.
00:14:29,00:14:31,And they probably get trained in it.
00:14:31,00:14:36,"They get told to throw it actually at the person's feet, because then it will splash up onto them."
00:14:36,00:14:38,And they're more likely to get covered in paint.
00:14:38,00:14:42,"And then if you missed the robber, then you have to run out to their getaway car"
00:14:42,00:14:45,and throw the anti-crime ball at the car instead.
00:14:45,00:14:47,That is pretty cool.
00:14:47,00:14:48,"And the police can find it, yeah."
00:14:48,00:14:53,"I was looking at kind of weird home innovations that have been done, because this is a cool floor."
00:14:53,00:14:55,Have you guys heard about the self-slucing house?
00:14:55,00:14:57,The self-slucing house.
00:14:57,00:14:58,The self-slucing house.
00:14:58,00:15:00,Slucing. Slucing. Slucing.
00:15:00,00:15:04,The self-slucing house would be a house that solved the crime after it had been burgled.
00:15:04,00:15:06,It would be a Sherlock home.
00:15:15,00:15:19,"Yeah, this was no-slucing."
00:15:19,00:15:21,I don't want my house-slucing.
00:15:21,00:15:22,It's self-slucing.
00:15:22,00:15:24,Are you going to explain what a slew-slucing is to that?
00:15:24,00:15:25,"Yeah, could you tell what it is?"
00:15:25,00:15:26,Slucing is itself.
00:15:26,00:15:29,So this was okay.
00:15:29,00:15:34,"So it washes, rinses and dries itself."
00:15:34,00:15:35,Right?
00:15:35,00:15:40,So this was invented in 1980 by a woman from Oregon called Francis Gabe.
00:15:40,00:15:42,And it was basically the whole house.
00:15:42,00:15:45,It was a massive dishwasher.
00:15:45,00:15:48,And so there was only one of these ever built amazingly.
00:15:48,00:15:49,And she lived in it.
00:15:49,00:15:50,It was the prototype.
00:15:50,00:15:53,"And it had a, she was a genuine inventor and a true eccentric."
00:15:53,00:15:55,Because there was a sprinkling in every room.
00:15:55,00:15:57,So she would go around with an umbrella.
00:15:57,00:16:00,And she pressed a bus in each room.
00:16:00,00:16:03,And it just soaked the whole room with sudsy water.
00:16:03,00:16:05,And then she pressed another bus in.
00:16:05,00:16:08,And then a second spray would blast it with warm water.
00:16:08,00:16:11,So all the water runs off in the floor.
00:16:11,00:16:13,"You know, through drains."
00:16:13,00:16:16,"And then jets of warm water, dry the house."
00:16:16,00:16:17,Warm air.
00:16:17,00:16:18,Warm air.
00:16:18,00:16:19,So what did I say?
00:16:19,00:16:20,Warm air will dry the house.
00:16:20,00:16:21,Warm air.
00:16:21,00:16:23,So jets of warm air.
00:16:23,00:16:25,Dry the house.
00:16:25,00:16:29,But the water that runs off through the drains
00:16:29,00:16:31,goes through the dog house and the dog gets washed too.
00:16:31,00:16:32,No.
00:16:32,00:16:36,And where do you put the tablet?
00:16:38,00:16:42,"But then, well, even if, like, things like electronic tablets, for instance,"
00:16:42,00:16:44,anything electronic would just get...
00:16:44,00:16:45,That's true.
00:16:45,00:16:47,A lot of her life was spent devoted to...
00:16:47,00:16:49,Buying new products.
00:16:49,00:16:53,Devoting ways to not wash the bed or the books as well.
00:16:53,00:16:55,So she had to invent waterproof jackets for books.
00:16:55,00:16:57,So she had to invent a waterproof cover for the bed.
00:16:57,00:17:00,"And the floor, it was more bothered than it was worth, frankly."
00:17:00,00:17:02,"But it did happen, it's real."
00:17:02,00:17:03,That's really good.
00:17:03,00:17:06,"Did you know on floors, these to cover floors with herbs?"
00:17:06,00:17:09,This is just another thing about when you watch period dramas
00:17:09,00:17:11,that they need to start getting right.
00:17:11,00:17:14,"The first use for mint, really, in this country in medieval times,"
00:17:14,00:17:16,"was you sprinkled it on the floor,"
00:17:16,00:17:18,"because this is when people would sort of stop washing a bit,"
00:17:18,00:17:21,"late medieval chewed at times, and everything sank."
00:17:21,00:17:23,And so what you had was you had lots of mint and herbs
00:17:23,00:17:25,that you strewed over floors.
00:17:25,00:17:26,That's really good.
00:17:26,00:17:29,"And like, shake and vac."
00:17:29,00:17:32,Are there those crisps where you shake the soul in?
00:17:32,00:17:37,"Now, admittedly, that is not a 2019 reference."
00:17:37,00:17:40,Is this as old as these Renaissance books?
00:17:40,00:17:42,It was what you used to do is when you hoovered.
00:17:42,00:17:44,This was in probably the '70s.
00:17:44,00:17:47,"So even before I was born, but you would put this weird,"
00:17:47,00:17:51,"like almost like washing tablet smell stuff on your carpet,"
00:17:51,00:17:54,"and then you would hoover over it, and it would make it smell like the '70s."
00:17:54,00:17:55,"Exactly, yeah."
00:17:55,00:17:56,It's like that.
00:17:56,00:17:58,Like the '70s.
00:17:58,00:18:00,The royal family had a herb struer.
00:18:00,00:18:01,It was one of the royal court.
00:18:01,00:18:04,"It was introduced by Charles II in 1660,"
00:18:04,00:18:06,and lasted for a couple of hundred years.
00:18:06,00:18:08,"One, you know, you had the groom of the stool."
00:18:08,00:18:09,You had your laden waiting.
00:18:09,00:18:10,You had your herbs struer.
00:18:10,00:18:12,And they had to strew herbs all over the floor.
00:18:12,00:18:13,"All right, amazing."
00:18:13,00:18:16,I have a thing on sort of alternative alarm systems
00:18:16,00:18:20,to what would be seen as an average one to use.
00:18:20,00:18:22,This is a very weird one.
00:18:22,00:18:26,"There was in Marbella, there was a lady who was in her house,"
00:18:26,00:18:28,and she got...
00:18:28,00:18:31,"Robbers came in, tied her up, and she was on the bed,"
00:18:31,00:18:32,and they were stealing all the stuff.
00:18:32,00:18:35,"And then what happened was, and this is the story that they tell,"
00:18:35,00:18:38,they suddenly started noticing that the woman on the bed
00:18:38,00:18:41,was in a lot of family photos surrounding the bed
00:18:41,00:18:44,"and bits of the house with the actor, Dolph Lungren,"
00:18:44,00:18:48,"who is in Rocky IV, he's the big Russian dude,"
00:18:48,00:18:51,quickly realizing that that was the husband of the woman
00:18:51,00:18:53,"that they had on the bed, and thought,"
00:18:53,00:18:55,"""We've got to get the hell outta here right now."""
00:18:55,00:18:57,And they bolted for that reason.
00:18:57,00:18:59,"These are really good ideas, and if I live on my own,"
00:18:59,00:19:02,"then I get a load of photos with me and Mike Tyson,"
00:19:02,00:19:05,and just pretend that we're a couple.
00:19:05,00:19:08,And then could happen.
00:19:08,00:19:12,"And then when the burglars come, then they'll run away."
00:19:12,00:19:14,"But when he gets wind of that,"
00:19:14,00:19:17,I think you are in serious trouble.
00:19:17,00:19:20,And we're going to have to move on to our next fact very shortly.
00:19:20,00:19:22,"I've got one thing about burglars,"
00:19:22,00:19:27,"is that just sort of, I like stories of burglars being caught."
00:19:27,00:19:30,"So there was, in 2015, a burglar was taunting police,"
00:19:30,00:19:33,because they'd launched an appeal to try and trace him on Facebook.
00:19:33,00:19:36,And he was so cocky that he wrote on Facebook
00:19:36,00:19:39,"in answer to the police comment, ""Haha, catch me if you can."
00:19:39,00:19:41,"""You won't see me slipping."""
00:19:41,00:19:44,"And then a news agency later spoke to him,"
00:19:44,00:19:46,"and he said, ""I've been walking around near home,"
00:19:46,00:19:47,"""so they're not trying too hard."""
00:19:47,00:19:49,And he was arrested later that day.
00:19:49,00:19:52,"That's just the Facebook thing, a very similar thing."
00:19:52,00:19:55,There was a guy who had his house burgled.
00:19:55,00:19:57,"He got back, and it was nothing he can do."
00:19:57,00:19:59,So he went on his computer.
00:19:59,00:20:01,"And it turned out that while the burglar was there,"
00:20:01,00:20:03,he had logged into his own Facebook account.
00:20:03,00:20:06,And failed to log back out.
00:20:06,00:20:08,"Oh, wow."
00:20:08,00:20:09,Cool.
00:20:09,00:20:12,"Between 2013 and 2016, the police in East Kilbride,"
00:20:12,00:20:15,"Devon, Warwickshire, Camden, and Bristol,"
00:20:15,00:20:17,all issued warnings about secret signs
00:20:17,00:20:19,that burglars were using.
00:20:19,00:20:21,And so what they would do is they would put little signs
00:20:21,00:20:23,"on the floor next to some houses,"
00:20:23,00:20:26,and they might be telling people that this has already been burgled
00:20:26,00:20:29,or that a medium-sized dog lived here.
00:20:29,00:20:32,"Isn't married to Dolph Lindgren, boy."
00:20:32,00:20:37,One of the men supposedly occupants are nervous and afraid.
00:20:37,00:20:40,"But then in 2016, West Mercer Police pointed out"
00:20:40,00:20:42,"that all these secret signs, so-called,"
00:20:42,00:20:44,were actually made by utility companies.
00:20:44,00:20:48,And the sign that they said meant nothing worth stealing
00:20:48,00:20:50,actually meant new landposts to go here.
00:20:50,00:20:55,[LAUGHTER]
00:20:55,00:20:57,"OK, we need to move on to fact number three."
00:20:57,00:20:59,And that is James.
00:20:59,00:21:03,"OK, my fact this week is that, according to its ingredients list,"
00:21:03,00:21:07,Peperami contains 108% pork.
00:21:07,00:21:13,[LAUGHTER]
00:21:13,00:21:15,"But actually, his pepperami is less good at mass"
00:21:15,00:21:18,than a five-month-old child.
00:21:18,00:21:19,How is it possible?
00:21:19,00:21:22,I saw this in an old copy of New Scientist
00:21:22,00:21:24,and apparently actually it is true.
00:21:24,00:21:27,So this is more of a recipe than an ingredients list.
00:21:27,00:21:31,"And basically, if you're making salami or some kind of cured meat like that,"
00:21:31,00:21:34,then a lot of it is through desiccation is how it cures.
00:21:34,00:21:37,So you would have a load of pork and then you would dry it out
00:21:37,00:21:39,so it would lose a load of the water.
00:21:39,00:21:42,So it is possible to use 108 kilograms of pork
00:21:42,00:21:44,to make 100 kilograms of pepperami.
00:21:44,00:21:45,So it is true.
00:21:45,00:21:49,A sausage can lose up to 50% of its weight during the curing process.
00:21:49,00:21:52,And pepperami are very crafty with their advertising campaigns.
00:21:52,00:21:55,"So in 2017, they launched a mass-porking campaign."
00:21:55,00:21:58,"It's weird, because to me that sounds like an enormous PR error."
00:21:58,00:21:59,[LAUGHTER]
00:21:59,00:22:01,"It was a different time, wasn't it?"
00:22:01,00:22:02,[LAUGHTER]
00:22:02,00:22:04,"Well, they were trying to, supposedly,"
00:22:04,00:22:06,doing it to highlight the growing pothole problem in London.
00:22:06,00:22:08,And they cordoned off a hundred potholes
00:22:08,00:22:10,and filled them with pepperamis.
00:22:10,00:22:11,Great.
00:22:11,00:22:13,"It is as tough as tarmac, isn't it?"
00:22:13,00:22:15,[LAUGHTER]
00:22:15,00:22:16,Weird.
00:22:16,00:22:18,They've got strong history in advertising.
00:22:18,00:22:21,"So I hadn't realized that the pepperami man,"
00:22:21,00:22:24,"like the living creature that is the pepperami guy,"
00:22:24,00:22:26,was voiced by Adrian Ebonson.
00:22:26,00:22:30,"He was this, you know, big epitome of manhood, wasn't he?"
00:22:30,00:22:32,And they've had to review him now.
00:22:32,00:22:35,So he used to be this really masculine macho bloke.
00:22:35,00:22:37,"Oh, not the pepperami guy as well."
00:22:37,00:22:38,I'm so sorry.
00:22:38,00:22:40,"Oh, he's not being you tree, does he?"
00:22:40,00:22:41,[LAUGHTER]
00:22:41,00:22:42,"Oh, yes."
00:22:42,00:22:44,"No, God, I don't want to spend that room"
00:22:44,00:22:45,about the pepperami guy.
00:22:45,00:22:46,No.
00:22:46,00:22:48,"No, it's pepperami too, actually."
00:22:48,00:22:49,[LAUGHTER]
00:22:49,00:22:50,Yeah.
00:22:50,00:22:54,[APPLAUSE]
00:22:54,00:22:58,He's-- he has been modernized because of us.
00:22:58,00:22:59,What is he doing at Tuxedo?
00:22:59,00:23:02,He's just a dedicated pork man.
00:23:02,00:23:04,They're just making him have a less innuendo
00:23:04,00:23:07,and macho behaviour to cater to a younger generation
00:23:07,00:23:09,and less tolerant of 90s culture.
00:23:09,00:23:10,I'm dried meat.
00:23:10,00:23:14,[LAUGHTER]
00:23:14,00:23:16,So dried meat is pretty much the old--
00:23:16,00:23:19,one of the oldest meals we know about existing.
00:23:19,00:23:23,"So let's see the iceman, a longstanding friend of the podcast,"
00:23:23,00:23:27,and a dead mummy found in the Alps.
00:23:27,00:23:29,One of his last meals was go to jerky.
00:23:29,00:23:30,Hi.
00:23:30,00:23:31,And so it's amazing how they found it out.
00:23:31,00:23:34,"So they, you know, they found him frozen up in the Alps"
00:23:34,00:23:38,"very well preserved, not perfectly preserved, he's a mummy."
00:23:38,00:23:41,"But they thought well, we could find out what he was eating."
00:23:41,00:23:43,And his stomach wasn't where it should have been.
00:23:43,00:23:46,So his stomach was pushed way up under his ribs
00:23:46,00:23:49,"because it had moved a bit in the 5,000 years since he died."
00:23:49,00:23:51,"So they had to defrost him for a bit,"
00:23:51,00:23:53,because he's normally kept on ice to keep him that way.
00:23:53,00:23:55,And then they had to use an endoscope
00:23:55,00:23:59,to pull out these blobs from his stomach and intestines.
00:23:59,00:24:01,And they had to analyse that and found out
00:24:01,00:24:03,that it was dried strips of goat meat.
00:24:03,00:24:05,And that was one of his last meals.
00:24:05,00:24:06,Wow.
00:24:06,00:24:07,Amazing.
00:24:07,00:24:11,"And it's so well preserved, you could probably re-eat that, couldn't you?"
00:24:11,00:24:12,It's jerky.
00:24:12,00:24:14,"It's jerky, jerky last forever."
00:24:14,00:24:15,Yeah.
00:24:15,00:24:16,It's amazing.
00:24:16,00:24:19,"On a low case, just me."
00:24:19,00:24:23,"It's amazing your funding biz keeping turned down, isn't it Anna?"
00:24:23,00:24:25,Are you still wanting to study iceman?
00:24:25,00:24:28,Jerky sounds nice.
00:24:28,00:24:30,"Just on, this is kind of a salami."
00:24:30,00:24:34,Do you know that salami brought down the people responsible
00:24:34,00:24:37,for the biggest diamondized of all time?
00:24:37,00:24:39,They were foiled by a piece of salami.
00:24:39,00:24:41,This is in 2003.
00:24:41,00:24:44,"And basically it was this group of robbers who broke into the vaults,"
00:24:44,00:24:46,two floors beneath the Antwerp Diamond Centre.
00:24:46,00:24:50,And they stole $100 million worth of like diamonds and jewelry
00:24:50,00:24:51,and all of that.
00:24:51,00:24:52,It's the biggest ice ever.
00:24:52,00:24:54,"And they didn't know how to get them, whatever."
00:24:54,00:24:57,"But in the area, there happened to be a guy living there"
00:24:57,00:25:00,who always had people dumping rubbish on his land
00:25:00,00:25:02,and used to get really angry about it and constantly calling the police
00:25:02,00:25:03,and winging about it.
00:25:03,00:25:06,So he called the police the next day after this big diamond ice
00:25:06,00:25:07,"and said, oh, I'm really annoyed."
00:25:07,00:25:09,I've got rubbish on my land again.
00:25:09,00:25:12,"There's all this, well, there's some salami for a start."
00:25:12,00:25:13,Someone's truck salami on my land.
00:25:13,00:25:15,"And there's also some diamond centre envelope,"
00:25:15,00:25:16,which could someone take away.
00:25:16,00:25:18,"And the police went, somewhat."
00:25:18,00:25:19,Okay.
00:25:19,00:25:23,"And it turned out the high skies had gone, they'd robbed all this stuff."
00:25:23,00:25:25,And then they'd eaten some salami sandwiches earlier
00:25:25,00:25:26,that they hadn't finished.
00:25:26,00:25:28,And then they just tossed them in the ground.
00:25:28,00:25:31,And they found these salamiers and they did the DNA tests.
00:25:31,00:25:33,And they traced it back to the guy who'd eaten them.
00:25:33,00:25:34,Wow.
00:25:34,00:25:36,And then they said they found the guy who'd eaten salami.
00:25:36,00:25:37,The rest of the pig.
00:25:37,00:25:38,It's so unfair.
00:25:38,00:25:43,They've been missing from his side.
00:25:43,00:25:47,"Not only that, they found the main guy who'd done it"
00:25:47,00:25:50,who was this guy called Nuta Bartolo.
00:25:50,00:25:53,But then they went to his house and they found the salami receipt
00:25:53,00:25:55,from the butcher's way he'd got it.
00:25:55,00:25:57,So then they went to the butcher's and they could tell
00:25:57,00:25:59,"where the receipt, what time it had been bought."
00:25:59,00:26:02,They checked the CCTV and they also then found the guy who'd bought it.
00:26:02,00:26:03,So there you go.
00:26:03,00:26:04,"Two birds, one salami."
00:26:04,00:26:06,That's so cool.
00:26:06,00:26:07,Amazing.
00:26:07,00:26:11,"Just on pigs, you know that some people have the ability"
00:26:11,00:26:14,"to, if you give them a plate of pork and they start eating it,"
00:26:14,00:26:16,tell you the gender of the animal.
00:26:16,00:26:17,"Oh, come on."
00:26:17,00:26:18,Yeah.
00:26:18,00:26:19,It's a genuine thing.
00:26:19,00:26:24,"It's all to do with a receptor, which is called Andrewsterstone."
00:26:24,00:26:27,And that's not how you say it.
00:26:27,00:26:30,"So now that we've got that out of the way, let's do the right version."
00:26:30,00:26:31,Andrewster known.
00:26:31,00:26:33,It's a steroid similar to testosterone.
00:26:33,00:26:35,And it's found in male pigs.
00:26:35,00:26:39,And there are certain people who are able to detect that way more than other people.
00:26:39,00:26:43,"Now most meats, weirdly, if a pig is castrated, then that thing,"
00:26:43,00:26:50,"that angestra trombodon gets knocked down, and so you can't usually tell."
00:26:50,00:26:54,"However, the European Union is going to say that castration is inhumane."
00:26:54,00:26:58,"So a lot more people who have this will be able, as they eat to go, I'm eating a man."
00:26:58,00:27:00,So is it a nice taste?
00:27:00,00:27:01,"No, it's a horrible taste."
00:27:01,00:27:04,So these people are just not going to be able to eat meat anymore?
00:27:04,00:27:05,"Exactly, they're tasting."
00:27:05,00:27:08,"Well, no, they'll have to ask for specifically female pigs to eat."
00:27:08,00:27:09,You can't do that in a restaurant.
00:27:09,00:27:10,Yeah.
00:27:10,00:27:15,"You can't let say, take these sausages back and bring me a male one."
00:27:15,00:27:16,"No, but it's true."
00:27:16,00:27:17,It's a genuine thing.
00:27:17,00:27:18,That's amazing.
00:27:18,00:27:19,And it tastes horrible.
00:27:19,00:27:21,So that's why they do get rid of it as well.
00:27:21,00:27:22,That's amazing.
00:27:22,00:27:24,Do you know what the longest salami ever was?
00:27:24,00:27:27,"Well, it was a salami, but do you know how long it was?"
00:27:27,00:27:28,Have a bash.
00:27:28,00:27:31,"5,000 metres."
00:27:31,00:27:32,"5,000 metres."
00:27:32,00:27:33,"5,000 metres."
00:27:33,00:27:35,"5,000 metres."
00:27:35,00:27:36,There isn't room for that.
00:27:36,00:27:40,"Anywhere, no one's got 5 kilometres of space to put a salami in."
00:27:40,00:27:43,"Yeah, but for a picnic, you could have it for a picnic, can you?"
00:27:43,00:27:45,"Well, if you wind it round."
00:27:45,00:27:49,"Well, if you had a very, very long picnic and a very big space,"
00:27:49,00:27:53,"if you were having it on a runway at an airport,"
00:27:53,00:27:55,you could take the salami there.
00:27:55,00:27:56,Exactly.
00:27:56,00:27:58,"Well, I mean, it's still long."
00:27:58,00:28:02,"It's not that long, but it's 1,152 metres and 16 centimetres."
00:28:02,00:28:04,"That's a long bit of meat, isn't it?"
00:28:04,00:28:07,"That's an extremely long salami, because down, guess, 5,000 metres."
00:28:07,00:28:10,"We're all thinking, oh, it's not 10 miles, is it?"
00:28:10,00:28:14,It was made by a Belgian company called Cox Fresh.
00:28:14,00:28:17,[LAUGHTER]
00:28:17,00:28:23,That was founded by a Belgian man in 1935 called Charles de Koch.
00:28:23,00:28:29,"And in 2016, they renamed Cox Fresh Charles,"
00:28:29,00:28:31,which I think is sensible.
00:28:31,00:28:32,Very wise.
00:28:32,00:28:35,Do we know what happened to the salami that they made?
00:28:35,00:28:40,"No, I don't. I imagine they sliced it up and then ate it."
00:28:40,00:28:42,Story checks out.
00:28:42,00:28:43,[LAUGHTER]
00:28:43,00:28:46,"And you said that, like, the end of the bedtime story."
00:28:46,00:28:47,[LAUGHTER]
00:28:47,00:28:48,And they all ate it up.
00:28:48,00:28:50,"OK, son, good night."
00:28:50,00:28:52,"What do you mean, no?"
00:28:52,00:28:54,[LAUGHTER]
00:28:54,00:28:56,Stop banging your head on that thing.
00:28:56,00:28:58,[LAUGHTER]
00:28:58,00:29:00,"Yeah, have a nice clown to kill."
00:29:00,00:29:03,[LAUGHTER]
00:29:03,00:29:05,This is just another one that you'll like.
00:29:05,00:29:07,James gets very immature facts.
00:29:07,00:29:12,"In Taipei, Taipei was named the world design capital in 2016."
00:29:12,00:29:16,"And to celebrate, they had literally a massive sausage party."
00:29:16,00:29:18,It was at the Taiwan Design Centre.
00:29:18,00:29:21,And they made it all completely sausage-themed.
00:29:21,00:29:25,So it featured a smoky-centred sausage mist that descends upon visitors
00:29:25,00:29:26,as they enter.
00:29:26,00:29:27,[LAUGHTER]
00:29:27,00:29:30,"That sounds quite nice, doesn't it, really?"
00:29:30,00:29:35,I'm so glad we picked Bryson home of vegetarianism to bring these facts.
00:29:35,00:29:38,They had a sausage festoon chandelier.
00:29:38,00:29:39,Very classy.
00:29:39,00:29:41,And then some sausage carnival games.
00:29:41,00:29:45,And the whole sausage fest was put together by a designer called Alice Wang.
00:29:45,00:29:48,[LAUGHTER]
00:29:48,00:29:51,"Oh, we're going to have to move on. Should we go for it?"
00:29:51,00:29:52,Yeah.
00:29:52,00:29:54,"OK, it is time for our final fact of the show."
00:29:54,00:29:56,And that is Chazinski.
00:29:56,00:30:01,My fact this week is that baby songbirds have inbuilt nappies.
00:30:01,00:30:04,This is great. They don't need pamphlets.
00:30:04,00:30:06,"They've already got them within themselves, literally."
00:30:06,00:30:08,They're called fecal sacs.
00:30:08,00:30:10,And they are for particularly common--
00:30:10,00:30:12,"So quite as good branding as pamphlets, isn't it?"
00:30:12,00:30:15,[LAUGHTER]
00:30:15,00:30:17,They need to work on their PR strategies.
00:30:17,00:30:20,"It's most common in passerine birds, which are basically songbirds."
00:30:20,00:30:22,So birds like robins and bluebirds.
00:30:22,00:30:27,"And they're basically-- it's only for nestlings, so it's only when they're babies and they're in the nest."
00:30:27,00:30:31,"And you can't leave your poo just all over the nest, because that's very unhygienic."
00:30:31,00:30:37,And so what the little nestlings do when they need to go to the loo is they turn their rear end towards their parent.
00:30:37,00:30:38,They point their ass out their parent.
00:30:38,00:30:43,And they eject this white bag of poo that's encased in a mucus membrane.
00:30:43,00:30:46,"And they eject it out the parent, which flies away and disposes of it."
00:30:46,00:30:47,It's incredible.
00:30:47,00:30:48,Yeah.
00:30:48,00:30:49,It's really cool.
00:30:49,00:30:50,They sometimes eat it.
00:30:50,00:30:52,"Sometimes eat it as well, yeah?"
00:30:52,00:30:54,"For a really cool reason, right?"
00:30:54,00:30:58,"Well, no, because sometimes the baby has not digested everything inside it."
00:30:58,00:31:03,So what you are effectively getting is like a packaged dim sum of just--
00:31:03,00:31:06,[LAUGHTER]
00:31:06,00:31:09,It's just like a capsule and you take it in.
00:31:09,00:31:12,"And so the birds get a lot of nutrients from it, because yeah, it's not fully digested."
00:31:12,00:31:13,"Yeah, yeah."
00:31:13,00:31:18,"And also, the other advantage is if you swallow it, or indeed if you take it away,"
00:31:18,00:31:23,"it means that no predators will find it, because it smells, and it would attract predators otherwise."
00:31:23,00:31:24,Yeah.
00:31:24,00:31:26,"And literally, it comes with a handle."
00:31:26,00:31:27,"No, it doesn't."
00:31:27,00:31:27,It does.
00:31:27,00:31:28,It comes with a little handle.
00:31:28,00:31:29,What?
00:31:29,00:31:30,It's amazing.
00:31:30,00:31:31,Like a briefcase.
00:31:31,00:31:32,[LAUGHTER]
00:31:32,00:31:33,Yeah.
00:31:33,00:31:35,"Or a plastic bag, or--"
00:31:35,00:31:36,Yeah.
00:31:36,00:31:38,"And if you put a handle, really, is what it is."
00:31:38,00:31:39,[LAUGHTER]
00:31:39,00:31:41,And do they-- can they swap their beak through the handle?
00:31:41,00:31:43,It doesn't feel like it's going to be that big.
00:31:43,00:31:45,I think they grab the handle with the beak and then they take it away.
00:31:45,00:31:50,"Or they have to do a lot of it, because every baby bird produces one fecal-like every hour throughout the day."
00:31:50,00:31:56,So a lot of the parent's job is just distributing this stuff all around away from the nest to trick predators.
00:31:56,00:31:57,Or avoid predators.
00:31:57,00:32:00,That's the other reason for eating it is so that they don't have to leave.
00:32:00,00:32:01,Because they're lazy.
00:32:01,00:32:02,"No, no, no."
00:32:02,00:32:06,"As in, you're immediately disposing of the evidence that would draw predators."
00:32:06,00:32:08,So quickly eat the poo of your child.
00:32:08,00:32:11,And then there are-- there's no kids here.
00:32:11,00:32:16,"You know, you can't see no what, even when surrounded by muggers, I would not--"
00:32:16,00:32:17,[LAUGHTER]
00:32:17,00:32:22,Most muggers don't track their victims by sniffing out their baby's feces.
00:32:22,00:32:25,"We've never heard of police, give it out for a guy."
00:32:25,00:32:28,"Well, fortunately, the potential victim ate his own shit."
00:32:28,00:32:31,[LAUGHTER]
00:32:31,00:32:37,Blue birds have been seen festooning fence posts and utility poles with these fecal sex.
00:32:37,00:32:38,Wow.
00:32:38,00:32:40,Like a dog walker might do with a dog poo fight.
00:32:40,00:32:42,"Oh, cool."
00:32:42,00:32:44,"And there was white white white, they do that."
00:32:44,00:32:45,"No, we don't know."
00:32:45,00:32:48,"It could be to say that this is my territory, for instance."
00:32:48,00:32:52,"Or it could be like, they're claiming they were going to walk back that way and put it in a bin."
00:32:52,00:32:54,And then they forgot.
00:32:54,00:32:55,Yeah.
00:32:55,00:32:56,I think black birds do this as well.
00:32:56,00:33:00,And I've found that there's a black bird in Tibet.
00:33:00,00:33:02,It's the Tibetan black bird.
00:33:02,00:33:05,"And that, like a species."
00:33:05,00:33:06,It's a species.
00:33:06,00:33:08,It's called the Tibetan black bird.
00:33:08,00:33:11,It's Latin name is Tertus Maximus.
00:33:11,00:33:14,[LAUGHTER]
00:33:14,00:33:15,"Well, they're Tertus, Tertus."
00:33:15,00:33:16,"Quo's, aren't they?"
00:33:16,00:33:17,Right.
00:33:17,00:33:18,I think that's the thrushes.
00:33:18,00:33:19,"The thrushes is Tertus, Tertus."
00:33:19,00:33:20,Yeah.
00:33:20,00:33:21,Yeah.
00:33:21,00:33:22,Very sturdy.
00:33:22,00:33:25,The great horn bill is another bird that does exciting stuff with poo.
00:33:25,00:33:27,So this is-- they look very cool.
00:33:27,00:33:28,They've got big bills.
00:33:28,00:33:32,"They hang around in India, Southeast Asia, that part of the world."
00:33:32,00:33:35,"And they do a cool thing when they're rearing their chicks,"
00:33:35,00:33:38,which is that they build themselves a little prison.
00:33:38,00:33:41,The mother basically goes into this big hollow in a large--
00:33:41,00:33:43,in a big factory trunk.
00:33:43,00:33:44,So it builds a big hollow.
00:33:44,00:33:46,And then she seals up the hole opening with her own feces.
00:33:46,00:33:48,So she makes plaster out of her feces.
00:33:48,00:33:51,She closes them all in to the completely trapped.
00:33:51,00:33:54,And she creates this tiny little slit in the feces.
00:33:54,00:33:56,"And that is where her mate, the father,"
00:33:56,00:33:58,will come and deliver food to all of them.
00:33:58,00:34:00,So they have to sit inside this prison for ages.
00:34:00,00:34:02,The mate delivers food through this little letterbox.
00:34:02,00:34:05,And it's also where she has to avoid the feces of her chicks.
00:34:05,00:34:07,"So every time one of the chicks poos,"
00:34:07,00:34:09,then they have to squash it out this letterbox.
00:34:09,00:34:12,"And then you also receive food through the same entrance,"
00:34:12,00:34:14,which is a very hygienic tool.
00:34:14,00:34:16,People have been doing that in my letterbox as well.
00:34:16,00:34:17,I'm not sure.
00:34:17,00:34:23,"Yeah, Sally, I don't know if they migrate all the way to North London."
00:34:23,00:34:25,"So, keeping another explanation."
00:34:25,00:34:29,I was looking at a bird that benefits from other animals poo.
00:34:29,00:34:34,So there's a vulture in Egypt called the Egyptian Vulture.
00:34:34,00:34:35,Amazing.
00:34:35,00:34:39,"Well, do they get these names?"
00:34:39,00:34:45,And so what it does is it goes to cow dung.
00:34:45,00:34:48,And it finds the yellow bits of cow dung.
00:34:48,00:34:52,And it starts eating it and sort of scrubbing its face inside.
00:34:52,00:34:55,And the reason for that is it's helping its beak to go
00:34:55,00:34:57,to the brightest yellow that it can go.
00:34:57,00:35:00,So it's effectively a sort of make up that it puts on to itself.
00:35:00,00:35:03,"But sort of actually enhances the yellowness anyway of their beak,"
00:35:03,00:35:05,like a exfoliating kind of thing.
00:35:05,00:35:07,And is that a do-it-right mate?
00:35:07,00:35:10,"Didn't read that far in the article, but yeah, I'm at it."
00:35:10,00:35:11,"Oh, yeah, it is."
00:35:11,00:35:13,"Yeah, we both did read the article."
00:35:13,00:35:14,Great.
00:35:14,00:35:17,"So it's the carotenoids inside the poo,"
00:35:17,00:35:19,which makes them go more orange.
00:35:19,00:35:20,Yeah.
00:35:20,00:35:22,And it is to attract mates.
00:35:22,00:35:23,"Mm-hmm, sexy."
00:35:23,00:35:24,It belongs to a sexy orange beak.
00:35:24,00:35:29,Did you know that you drink some dinosaur urine every day?
00:35:29,00:35:33,"Yeah, it goes with my 70,000 year old beef jerky."
00:35:33,00:35:35,[LAUGHTER]
00:35:35,00:35:37,"This is, I think we can calculate it,"
00:35:37,00:35:40,that dinosaurs were around for 186 million years.
00:35:40,00:35:42,"Basically, they had time to drink so much"
00:35:42,00:35:45,that almost every single molecule of water on the planet
00:35:45,00:35:47,has at some point been through a dinosaur's kidney.
00:35:47,00:35:48,So cool.
00:35:48,00:35:50,So that's a cool thing you can think.
00:35:50,00:35:53,Next time you're having a glass of water.
00:35:53,00:35:55,"We should talk, I think, because we're talking about bird poo."
00:35:55,00:35:57,It feels like we're talking about Guano.
00:35:57,00:35:58,The most--
00:35:58,00:35:59,"Yeah, we agreed."
00:35:59,00:36:02,Guano is basically as held up the Peruvian economy
00:36:02,00:36:04,for about 200 years.
00:36:04,00:36:06,"Well, we say held up, even it supported it rather than delayed it."
00:36:06,00:36:08,"It supported it, yes."
00:36:08,00:36:11,"So this is bird poo, and it is specifically,"
00:36:11,00:36:13,and burp is an extremely useful fertilizer.
00:36:13,00:36:15,You probably know you spread it on your fields.
00:36:15,00:36:17,So it's exported worldwide.
00:36:17,00:36:19,And a huge percentage comes from Peru.
00:36:19,00:36:23,And that is because it has booby pelicans
00:36:23,00:36:27,and guane cormorants who produce the best guano.
00:36:27,00:36:29,And it's because they have 80% of the world's anchovy
00:36:29,00:36:31,and this feeds them up.
00:36:31,00:36:33,"And basically, there are a few little islands that are just"
00:36:33,00:36:36,coven in it that get harvested for their poo the whole time.
00:36:36,00:36:39,"So there's this one tiny island, Guana Pesua,"
00:36:39,00:36:42,where there are only two gods allowed to live on it.
00:36:42,00:36:44,One of them has been living on it for 13 years.
00:36:44,00:36:46,He's the only person allowed.
00:36:46,00:36:48,And he's there to fight off anyone who wants to steal the bird poo.
00:36:48,00:36:51,And then I think it's the case that it's only like every 10 years.
00:36:51,00:36:54,It's suddenly hundreds of harvesters are allowed to come
00:36:54,00:36:56,and scrape it off the rocks and sell it.
00:36:56,00:36:58,And then they have to go away and wait for it to regrow.
00:36:58,00:37:01,There are birds living there as well as in their constantly depotits.
00:37:01,00:37:03,"Yeah, constantly leaving it there, yeah."
00:37:03,00:37:05,They're not just shipping it in.
00:37:05,00:37:06,These islands are incredible.
00:37:06,00:37:09,Some of them have covered 200 feet deep in poo.
00:37:09,00:37:10,Whoa!
00:37:10,00:37:13,And the guy is actually living on the island as well.
00:37:13,00:37:15,"Yeah, he lives there the whole time."
00:37:15,00:37:17,He does say he misses his family.
00:37:17,00:37:21,"So America passed a law in the, I think the late 19th century,"
00:37:21,00:37:25,which legally allowed it to seize any island which had Guano on it.
00:37:25,00:37:27,It was so important for them to lie there.
00:37:27,00:37:29,"And when you say legally, it was according to American rules."
00:37:29,00:37:30,"Was it an ex, isn't it?"
00:37:30,00:37:31,"It was, yeah."
00:37:31,00:37:35,"But in 15 years, Britain imported two million tons of Guano"
00:37:35,00:37:40,with just a whole thousands of ships just full of Guano
00:37:40,00:37:43,"bringing, you know, and fertiliser yields rocketed."
00:37:43,00:37:44,Yeah.
00:37:44,00:37:47,It was most of their income.
00:37:47,00:37:50,"For about 40 years, was that?"
00:37:50,00:37:54,"And there was a guy, there's a guy we mentioned sometimes called William Buckland,"
00:37:54,00:37:55,who was a naturalist.
00:37:55,00:37:58,And he was around at the beginning of the 19th century.
00:37:58,00:38:01,And he once pranked his Oxford College using Guano.
00:38:01,00:38:03,So it was in about 1804.
00:38:03,00:38:05,"He got hold of some of this, which was pretty new then."
00:38:05,00:38:12,And he spread it on the grass in the main lawn of his college by night.
00:38:12,00:38:15,And he spelled out five letters.
00:38:15,00:38:17,And that grass grew incredibly powerfully.
00:38:17,00:38:18,Go on.
00:38:18,00:38:20,Which letters do you think he spelled out?
00:38:20,00:38:21,Was it just Guano?
00:38:21,00:38:22,Guano.
00:38:22,00:38:23,"Guano, yes."
00:38:23,00:38:24,"Yes, it was."
00:38:24,00:38:26,It's not the best reveal I've ever had.
00:38:26,00:38:27,"Oh, yeah."
00:38:27,00:38:31,"I'm kicking myself for building that up to be a big one, you know?"
00:38:31,00:38:32,Yeah.
00:38:32,00:38:36,"But they let Guano be strongly up saying Guano in sort of super grass, as it were."
00:38:36,00:38:37,Really?
00:38:37,00:38:38,Very cool.
00:38:38,00:38:40,"And that's where the band got the name, isn't it?"
00:38:40,00:38:42,Hmm.
00:38:42,00:38:50,"You know, there's a theory that in Antarctica, that in order for penguins, when they're about to go into breeding season,"
00:38:50,00:38:57,"the way they need ice to be melted in order for them to have a nice patch, they all get together, and they poo the ice away."
00:38:57,00:38:58,Yeah.
00:38:58,00:39:01,"So they all stand and huddle, and they all go for it, and then the heat."
00:39:01,00:39:03,The heat of the poo melts the ice.
00:39:03,00:39:04,"And then, yeah, that's it."
00:39:04,00:39:06,But you say this is a theory or--
00:39:06,00:39:07,"Yes, it's a theory."
00:39:07,00:39:08,"No, no, no, they definitely do it."
00:39:08,00:39:11,The thing is that we don't think they do it intentionally.
00:39:11,00:39:13,Exactly. So it's a theory that they're doing it intentionally.
00:39:13,00:39:21,"That is like the scene in Alien Resurrection, where I'm sorry to go all film nerdy here, but the aliens all kill one of the other aliens,"
00:39:21,00:39:22,because they've all got acid for blood.
00:39:22,00:39:29,"So to make their escape from the lab they're in, they deliberately kill one, and then it burns through the floor of the room that they're in."
00:39:29,00:39:30,Hmm.
00:39:30,00:39:31,And that's what the penguins are doing.
00:39:31,00:39:32,"Yeah, like that."
00:39:32,00:39:33,Yeah.
00:39:33,00:39:34,It's kind of what they're doing.
00:39:34,00:39:37,It's always exactly the same as what the penguins are.
00:39:37,00:39:40,They're using their bodily fluids to get through a floor surface.
00:39:40,00:39:44,But that film's not going to do nearly as well if they're just shitting on the lines.
00:39:44,00:39:46,[LAUGHTER]
00:39:46,00:39:48,Alien squashing over the floor.
00:39:48,00:39:51,[LAUGHTER]
00:39:51,00:39:57,"I found another-- and Anna, there's a beetle, which is called the three-lined potato beetle, and in order to protect it from."
00:39:57,00:39:58,Why is it from?
00:39:58,00:39:59,"I mean, it's from."
00:39:59,00:40:01,[LAUGHTER]
00:40:02,00:40:04,Yeah.
00:40:04,00:40:05,"You know, no, do you?"
00:40:05,00:40:08,[LAUGHTER]
00:40:08,00:40:09,So it's a beetle.
00:40:09,00:40:11,[LAUGHTER]
00:40:11,00:40:13,"And no one knows where it's from, but it's--"
00:40:13,00:40:16,[LAUGHTER]
00:40:16,00:40:21,"And so what it does is it has a big problem with predators, obviously, like all beetles."
00:40:21,00:40:25,"It's constantly predatored on, and it has--"
00:40:25,00:40:26,[LAUGHTER]
00:40:26,00:40:27,--professor slowed down.
00:40:27,00:40:30,[LAUGHTER]
00:40:31,00:40:33,"But no, please don't slow down."
00:40:33,00:40:36,"You know that theory we mentioned earlier, that the boy you have--"
00:40:36,00:40:38,"--people are rude to you, the stupider you get."
00:40:38,00:40:41,[LAUGHTER]
00:40:41,00:40:43,You're saying we've been shooting ourselves in the foot really haven't we?
00:40:43,00:40:45,We've been shooting five years at five years in.
00:40:45,00:40:47,There's almost nothing left.
00:40:47,00:40:49,You brought this on yourselves.
00:40:49,00:40:55,"Yeah, so basically, in order to protect itself, it eats toxins, and then the toxins are pooed out."
00:40:55,00:40:59,"And then it grabs the poo, and it smothers its back in the poo."
00:40:59,00:41:04,"So it means that no animal would ever eat it, because they would die from the poison of it."
00:41:04,00:41:08,"But then weirdly, there's a symbiotic relationship with an ant that eats that,"
00:41:08,00:41:11,but then protects the beetle as a trade-off.
00:41:11,00:41:14,"So no one's going to eat it, but it's never going to get a shag, is it?"
00:41:14,00:41:16,Really.
00:41:16,00:41:18,There's not a way to attract people.
00:41:18,00:41:20,There's a smearing poo on yourself.
00:41:20,00:41:22,It's not a controversial statement.
00:41:22,00:41:25,[LAUGHTER]
00:41:25,00:41:26,"We need to wrap up, guys."
00:41:26,00:41:30,"Could I just give, just because this is a bit about nappies, bird nappies,"
00:41:30,00:41:32,just a thing I learned about human nappies.
00:41:32,00:41:35,So people toilet train their kids differently all around the world.
00:41:35,00:41:38,"And I was reading about a few of the different countries, the ways they do it."
00:41:38,00:41:43,"So in 2012, a study looked at Vietnam, and found that all the mothers they looked at there,"
00:41:43,00:41:46,"trained their kids to, we, on command, when they whistled."
00:41:46,00:41:48,They made it so that they looked for the signs.
00:41:48,00:41:50,That must have been very awkward at a football match.
00:41:50,00:41:53,[LAUGHTER]
00:41:53,00:41:56,"There was very clever so the mothers basically, when they saw their baby,"
00:41:56,00:41:58,"like, it was going to weigh your poo, then they take it to the toilet,"
00:41:58,00:42:01,"hold it over the toilet or the potty, and they'd whistle while they pooed."
00:42:01,00:42:04,"And it's a bit of a Pavlovian thing, where the babies were eventually trained"
00:42:04,00:42:07,"to only or poo, only when their mothers whistled."
00:42:07,00:42:10,And so they could just schedule their poo's in.
00:42:10,00:42:14,"It's terrifying power that your mother will hold over you, though, in later life."
00:42:14,00:42:16,[LAUGHTER]
00:42:16,00:42:22,"If you bring someone home that your mom doesn't like,"
00:42:22,00:42:25,you could just embarrass you royally in front of them.
00:42:25,00:42:26,Yeah.
00:42:26,00:42:31,"Mind you, as a woman in the #MeToo era, what a great way to deter wolf whistlers."
00:42:31,00:42:34,[LAUGHTER]
00:42:34,00:42:36,They're not going to do that for long.
00:42:36,00:42:39,[APPLAUSE]
00:42:39,00:42:40,"OK, that is it."
