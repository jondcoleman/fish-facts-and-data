00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,680
 Hello and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish"

7
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:22,680
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Brighton!

8
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,440
 [cheering]

9
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,120
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

10
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:33,480
 I am sitting here with Anna Chazinski, Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin,

11
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,080
 and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts

12
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:41,440
 from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go.

13
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,680
 Starting with you, Andy.

14
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:49,480
 My fact is that babies who live in London are more rude than babies from the West Midlands.

15
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,680
 [laughing]

16
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,120
 So what do they, what do the London babies do?

17
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,720
 They come at you with a knife.

18
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:00,640
 They don't say "thank you" and they don't say "sorry".

19
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,720
 And this is a study by Liverpool University, which studied two and a half thousand babies.

20
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:11,080
 Sorry, it must be babies of a certain age because they don't think any like one month old babies say that's true.

21
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,520
 It's all about the first words that they learn and it turns out that babies in London

22
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:19,800
 and Wales weirdly are least likely to include the word "thank you" among their first words.

23
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,520
 And normally babies are quite polite, as in the word "sorry" crops up quite a lot.

24
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,520
 Well they're always fucking up, so I'm not surprised.

25
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:33,520
 If I shut myself seven times a day, I'd apologise all the time as well.

26
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,520
 [laughing]

27
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,520
 Hang on.

28
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,520
 They've not shat themselves.

29
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,520
 They haven't gone "oh god, I am so sorry".

30
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,520
 They've just gone to the toilet.

31
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,520
 That's what's showing yourself?

32
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,520
 No, that sounds like...

33
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,520
 If I went to the toilet seven times a day, I wouldn't complain.

34
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:56,520
 No, when it's in your pants, it's shitting yourself.

35
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,520
 My son doesn't say...

36
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,520
 And he's a Londoner, I guess.

37
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,520
 What does he say?

38
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,520
 He says, "No, like a lot".

39
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,520
 Wow.

40
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,520
 Yeah, you'll be like, "Can I have a hug?" No.

41
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,520
 It's really cut me.

42
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,520
 Actually, "No" is one of the more common first words of babies.

43
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:16,520
 And there are quite a few babies, a high percentage who have no as the first word,

44
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,520
 say nothing else for the first three months.

45
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,520
 Pretty much they just say, "No, no, no, no, no.

46
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,520
 Like Bohemian rap street."

47
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,520
 Or to a limited.

48
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,520
 They're just like, "No, no, no."

49
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,520
 Wow.

50
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,520
 He just says, "No."

51
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,520
 He says, "Mummy, daddy, and guys have shat myself, sorry."

52
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:38,520
 Do we know why this is the case?

53
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,520
 Is there any...

54
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,520
 And they're not we're doing other ways.

55
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,520
 They just don't like to say, "Please, and thank you."

56
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,520
 Yeah, they're not...

57
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,520
 I don't think that notice will be impolite in other ways.

58
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,520
 It's just, yeah, I don't know what the reason behind it is, actually.

59
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,520
 Presumably, their parents aren't teaching it to.

60
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,520
 The more is it quite random what baby knows?

61
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,520
 I don't know if you're going to say...

62
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,520
 The first word is just a random word.

63
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,520
 It's got to be a word you've heard before.

64
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,520
 I mean, they...

65
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,520
 So I would have assumed the baby's first word

66
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,520
 or something the parents are attempting to teach them.

67
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,520
 Exactly.

68
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,520
 Or is it just something that the baby picks up?

69
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,520
 It's from what they hear around them.

70
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:11,520
 So it means that babies in London are not hearing those words as regularly.

71
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,520
 I think that was a suggestion anyway.

72
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,520
 Other common first words, or early words at least,

73
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:21,520
 include carrot, cake, doggie, quack, banana, and bird poo.

74
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,520
 Oh.

75
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,520
 Really?

76
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,520
 Who's saying that a lot to their children?

77
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,520
 Is that London-specific?

78
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,520
 I know that was in this study, it was all regular things.

79
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,520
 And another thing is that this is in all regions, actually.

80
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,520
 One of the names that children are most likely to learn

81
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:41,520
 after Mummy and Daddy is Pepper.

82
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:46,520
 That's my son learnt that before he said Mummy and Daddy.

83
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,520
 I'm not lying, Pepper is...

84
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,520
 He loves Pepper.

85
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,520
 He loves Pepper a lot.

86
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,520
 Yeah, Pepper is his hero.

87
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,520
 Turneric is the other one.

88
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,520
 He says a lot, isn't it?

89
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:00,520
 That's a London baby all right.

90
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:06,520
 There's surprisingly clever babies, aren't they?

91
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,520
 They can count from extraordinarily young.

92
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,520
 So they can count at five months old to an extent,

93
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,520
 which I find incredible, because if you look at a five-month old,

94
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,520
 they can barely move their head.

95
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:20,520
 And they're tiny, but there was this study done,

96
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:23,520
 which basically showed five months old this screen on a stage,

97
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,520
 there's a big screen on a stage, and then they took out a Mickey Mouse doll,

98
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,520
 and they showed it to the kid, and then they put it behind the screen,

99
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,520
 and they took out a second Mickey Mouse doll,

100
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,520
 put that behind the screen, and then they lifted the screen up.

101
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,520
 And if there were two Mickey Mouse dolls there,

102
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,520
 the kid was fine, looked away quite quickly.

103
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,520
 If there were three Mickey Mouse dolls there,

104
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,520
 then the kid would stare at it for ages,

105
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,520
 which is the only way that we know if a baby is confused

106
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,520
 or surprised or anything, as they just stare for a long time,

107
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,520
 because it's so confused, because it knows it's counted to,

108
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,520
 and you reveal three.

109
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,520
 On the thing about them being surprised and looking at things,

110
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:59,520
 so this is why Peekaboo is such a great game for babies,

111
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,520
 and for all of us, actually.

112
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,520
 No, so basically they are surprised when things,

113
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:10,520
 they like sort of testing, there's a theory of object permanence,

114
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,520
 which is that, you know, things are still there even when you can't see them.

115
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,520
 So even if you're hiding, when you appear again,

116
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:20,520
 it's sort of surprise and confirmation at the same time that you're correct.

117
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:26,520
 So babies laugh more in normal Peekaboo than they do in trial versions of Peekaboo,

118
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,520
 where they add out hides, and then they reappear as a different person.

119
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,520
 That's not funny to a baby.

120
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:36,520
 They like Peekaboo because it's predictable.

121
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:41,520
 Okay, because they know that it's wrong if they're a different person.

122
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,520
 Exactly, so they're like sort of, yes, standard stuff.

123
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,520
 I also did not know that, so they'd love the big bank theory, for example,

124
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:52,520
 because it's very basic, obvious stuff.

125
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:56,520
 The TV show, all the actual theory.

126
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:01,520
 Very obvious.

127
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,520
 Did you know that Peekaboo is a style of boxing?

128
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,520
 It's a style of boxing where you put your hands in front of your face.

129
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,520
 Okay, and then do you whip your hands away and give the man a shot?

130
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,520
 No, no, you're doing it, and then you whip your hands out of the way

131
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,520
 and it's Mike Tyson there instead.

132
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,520
 It's not that you cover your eyes because obviously that's very bad boxing.

133
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,520
 No.

134
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,520
 They're quite interpunching, actually, babies, aren't they?

135
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,520
 Or they can get quite aggressive.

136
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:31,520
 So this was another study that was done about how our adult behaviour can impact

137
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,520
 very young children's behaviour.

138
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,520
 And they did this experiment with really young kids, with like young toddlers.

139
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:43,520
 And what they did was they had some kids watch an adult beat up a punching bag clown,

140
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,520
 you know, like a big toy clown.

141
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,520
 So I would have loved to be in the adult in this experiment.

142
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,520
 So the adult got to beat the crap out of this clown and then some other babies...

143
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:56,520
 You're not allowed back in McDonald's, are you?

144
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:00,520
 So there was another clown which didn't get beaten up where the adult just treated it nicely.

145
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,520
 And there was another control group that did nothing.

146
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,520
 And the kids who'd seen an adult beating up the clown, not only did they then

147
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:10,520
 when they were unleashed on the clown beat it to shreds, like really attacked it.

148
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:14,520
 But they improvised new weapons out of whatever they could see.

149
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:18,520
 To really try and make it so there was like a dark gun was left in the room

150
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,520
 and there's some quite dramatic footage.

151
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:24,520
 That's not improvising a weapon.

152
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,520
 Picking up a dark gun.

153
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:32,520
 Yeah, they didn't build the dark gun out of a mop and an orange.

154
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,520
 Maybe they did.

155
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,520
 There was a dark gun in the corner of the room.

156
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,520
 You can watch it on YouTube.

157
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:39,520
 There's like a two-year-old kid who goes up to the clown and holds a dark gun

158
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:44,520
 to his head and starts whispering scary stuff on his head.

159
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,520
 That's the most...

160
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,520
 And then lots of people said, "But it's okay, it's a punching bag clown, it's what they're for."

161
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,520
 And so they repeated the experiment, but using a real person dressed as a clown

162
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,520
 and they'd also beat the crap out of him.

163
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,520
 Really?

164
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,520
 Oh my god, that's amazing.

165
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:02,520
 Actually, on aggressiveness in children, I don't have kids, so I don't know if this is common.

166
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:08,520
 But I was surprised to read that they often bang their head against the bed or the crib or the wall.

167
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,520
 And they'll do this around six months of age.

168
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:14,520
 Quite a lot of children will just start head-banging things.

169
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,520
 And apparently, the reason they do it can last up to 15 minutes.

170
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,520
 And the reason they do it is it gives them a surge of adrenaline.

171
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,520
 Because if you get hurt, for instance, you get some adrenaline

172
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,520
 and then that helps them to sleep afterwards because they get the surge of adrenaline

173
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,520
 and then it gives them a kind of a downer.

174
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,520
 Apparently this is true.

175
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,520
 They're like this.

176
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,520
 And from the reaction, I think it's not a common thing.

177
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,520
 I've not seen my son do that.

178
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,520
 But apparently, because it is quite relatively...

179
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:45,520
 It does happen, but whenever any parent sees it, they're like, holy fuck.

180
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,520
 There's a thing that kids have.

181
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,520
 I haven't got any research on this.

182
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,520
 I just remember learning this at the time when I had my son.

183
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:56,520
 That kids at the beginning, they have no separation between what's...

184
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:00,520
 Their vision is quite solid, so 3D objects are not so great.

185
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:04,520
 But one of the things is perception of size is a thing that they don't fully get.

186
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:09,520
 And then they hit a certain age where suddenly they realize that they're tiny and everyone else is massive.

187
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,520
 And it freaks them out.

188
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,520
 They're suddenly surrounded by giants.

189
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,520
 And it's a really traumatising moment for kids.

190
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:20,520
 So you can really take advantage of that moment when you...

191
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:28,520
 Well, there is this weird thing that we think that they see everything upside down at first.

192
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,520
 Really?

193
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,520
 Yeah.

194
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,520
 So you know this is a thing where you see things upside down because that's the way the light hits your restaurant.

195
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,520
 It hits it in the wrong... it hits it upside down.

196
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,520
 And then your brain reverses the image and you see a correct image.

197
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:41,520
 But actually, the light enters your eyes and shows you an upside down image.

198
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:45,520
 So we think that before babies work out how to flip the images because they're idiots,

199
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:49,520
 they can't see the right way up for the first week of their life.

200
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,520
 So everything is upside down for them.

201
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,520
 That's crazy.

202
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:56,520
 And also they can do mirror-rising, which I only learned this recently.

203
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,520
 And to any parent, I think this is quite standard.

204
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:01,520
 I learned it from a parent who was like, "Oh yeah, she's at a stage where she's doing mirror-riding."

205
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,520
 She was Australian.

206
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:07,520
 But to her, everything did look upside down because she was Australian.

207
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,520
 True.

208
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:14,520
 But yeah, a lot of kids, toddler age, the natural way they write is proper mirror-riding,

209
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,520
 like Leonardo da Vinci did, that we can't possibly do naturally as humans.

210
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,520
 And then they just grow out of doing it.

211
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,520
 You make kids that do this?

212
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,520
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

213
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,520
 It's incredible.

214
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,520
 That's crazy.

215
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,520
 We're going to have to move on shortly to our next fact.

216
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:29,520
 I just, one small interesting thing, just on the idea of rudeness and babies,

217
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:33,520
 in Thailand, because of superstitions, there's a common thing that's done,

218
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,520
 which is you never say that a newborn baby is beautiful.

219
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,520
 You always call it ugly.

220
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:43,520
 So for the first, it's the idea that by calling them ugly ghosts would be scared away and so on.

221
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:48,520
 And yeah, so for the first few weeks of a baby's life, they're just being called but ugly.

222
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,520
 In the Philippines, is that?

223
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,520
 No, that was in Thailand.

224
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,520
 Thailand.

225
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,520
 I don't know if it happened in Hong Kong, because I used to get called.

226
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,520
 Definitely happened in Bolton.

227
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:59,520
 I was a genuinely ugly baby.

228
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:04,520
 And one of my best friends, her mum, came to see me, first person to see me after I was born.

229
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,520
 And she tells me the story now.

230
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:10,520
 She said, I just couldn't bring myself to even find the words to say that you were in any way beautiful.

231
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,520
 Or you were just, you were just so ugly.

232
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:19,520
 And the first thing that was said about me was she looked me went, oh, how interesting.

233
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,520
 And then you worked for the company quite interesting.

234
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,520
 That's how it all began.

235
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,520
 In her face.

236
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:29,520
 Just on, another thing on rudeness and how rudeness can affect us.

237
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:33,520
 So there's lots of studies that are done that have shown that it's extremely infectious

238
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,520
 in a way that we can totally understand.

239
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:40,520
 Because what it does is if someone's rude to you, it takes a lot of mental energy to respond to that.

240
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:44,520
 It's quite draining, working out your impulse control and not punching them in the face.

241
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,520
 And then you become weaker, your impulses come weaker.

242
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,520
 So therefore you're then rude to the next person.

243
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:55,520
 And it's to the extent that, and it really damages our mental faculties in various other ways.

244
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,520
 So it also makes us stupider.

245
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:02,520
 So as soon as someone's rude to you, it makes you stupid to the extent that if you even read words

246
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,520
 that sound like they're rude.

247
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:09,520
 So there was a study where people were asked to read the words interrupt obnoxious and bother.

248
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,520
 I don't know how rude that is.

249
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:15,520
 But after that, they performed five times worse on a mental task.

250
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:19,520
 So I have fewer to read, for instance, the Daily Mail.

251
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,520
 Yeah.

252
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:23,520
 Or watch a Winnie the Pooh episode.

253
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,520
 Is that rude?

254
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,520
 Oh, bother.

255
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:32,520
 Okay, we need to move on to our second fact of the show.

256
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,520
 And that is my fact.

257
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:40,520
 My fact this week is in 17th century Japan, the super rich would protect their homes from burglars

258
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,520
 by installing musical floorboards.

259
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:47,520
 So like the piano and big.

260
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,520
 Yeah.

261
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,520
 No, this is not quite that.

262
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,520
 These were called nightingale floors.

263
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:56,520
 And the idea was that they worked out that in Japan,

264
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:59,520
 if you had a palace and you were worried about, let's say,

265
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:03,520
 you're at the head of the palace being murdered by ninjas or anyone good at creeping in,

266
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:06,520
 what you would do is you would have creaky floorboards.

267
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:11,520
 And the creaky floorboards were alert everyone to the fact that someone was there.

268
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:15,520
 Now, some people just have creaky floorboards, but these were specifically designed

269
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,520
 and they were very expensive to install.

270
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:21,520
 And what it was was underneath the floorboard that was a nail that went along a bracket.

271
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:25,520
 And it produced a frequency sound that sounded a lot like a nightingale singing a song.

272
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,520
 The bird.

273
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,520
 The nightingale bird.

274
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,520
 You can see clips on YouTube.

275
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,520
 I was opposed to the Victorian dance.

276
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:36,520
 [Laughter]

277
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,520
 Like, they were all confused.

278
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,520
 [Laughter]

279
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,520
 Some global clarified.

280
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,520
 Yeah, so it was really cool.

281
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:49,520
 And my favorite thing about this whole fact is obviously there are people patrolling the grounds of the palace.

282
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,520
 So what did they do?

283
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,520
 Because they need to walk over these floorboards.

284
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:58,520
 So what they ended up doing was agreeing on a system of rhythm that would effectively be playing a song as you walked.

285
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:02,520
 And if they heard the rhythm, they'd be like, oh, it's Mike, you know, as opposed to...

286
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,520
 Oh, wow.

287
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,520
 That's clever.

288
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:08,520
 They have in Japan quite exciting sort of burglar defenders even today.

289
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:13,520
 They have in shops, modern day shops in Japan often have this bright orange sphere

290
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,520
 that's next to the till if you're buying something.

291
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,520
 And what it actually is, it's a paintball.

292
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:21,520
 And they're trained as shopkeepers in Japan to throw this paintball at someone

293
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,520
 if they try to rob the shop.

294
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:27,520
 And the idea is that it will leave this mark on them, and then they'll be identifiable.

295
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,520
 So just look for the guy covered in orange paint.

296
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,520
 And they probably get trained in it.

297
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:36,520
 They get told to throw it actually at the person's feet, because then it will splash up onto them.

298
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,520
 And they're more likely to get covered in paint.

299
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:42,520
 And then if you missed the robber, then you have to run out to their getaway car

300
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:45,520
 and throw the anti-crime ball at the car instead.

301
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,520
 That is pretty cool.

302
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,520
 And the police can find it, yeah.

303
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:53,520
 I was looking at kind of weird home innovations that have been done, because this is a cool floor.

304
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,520
 Have you guys heard about the self-slucing house?

305
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,520
 The self-slucing house.

306
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,520
 The self-slucing house.

307
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,520
 Slucing. Slucing. Slucing.

308
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:04,520
 The self-slucing house would be a house that solved the crime after it had been burgled.

309
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,520
 It would be a Sherlock home.

310
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:19,520
 Yeah, this was no-slucing.

311
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,520
 I don't want my house-slucing.

312
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,520
 It's self-slucing.

313
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,520
 Are you going to explain what a slew-slucing is to that?

314
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,520
 Yeah, could you tell what it is?

315
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,520
 Slucing is itself.

316
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,520
 So this was okay.

317
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:34,520
 So it washes, rinses and dries itself.

318
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,520
 Right?

319
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:40,520
 So this was invented in 1980 by a woman from Oregon called Francis Gabe.

320
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,520
 And it was basically the whole house.

321
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:45,520
 It was a massive dishwasher.

322
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:48,520
 And so there was only one of these ever built amazingly.

323
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,520
 And she lived in it.

324
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,520
 It was the prototype.

325
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,520
 And it had a, she was a genuine inventor and a true eccentric.

326
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,520
 Because there was a sprinkling in every room.

327
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,520
 So she would go around with an umbrella.

328
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:00,520
 And she pressed a bus in each room.

329
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:03,520
 And it just soaked the whole room with sudsy water.

330
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,520
 And then she pressed another bus in.

331
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,520
 And then a second spray would blast it with warm water.

332
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,520
 So all the water runs off in the floor.

333
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,520
 You know, through drains.

334
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,520
 And then jets of warm water, dry the house.

335
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,520
 Warm air.

336
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,520
 Warm air.

337
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,520
 So what did I say?

338
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,520
 Warm air will dry the house.

339
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,520
 Warm air.

340
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,520
 So jets of warm air.

341
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,520
 Dry the house.

342
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:29,520
 But the water that runs off through the drains

343
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,520
 goes through the dog house and the dog gets washed too.

344
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,520
 No.

345
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:36,520
 And where do you put the tablet?

346
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:42,520
 But then, well, even if, like, things like electronic tablets, for instance,

347
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,520
 anything electronic would just get...

348
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,520
 That's true.

349
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,520
 A lot of her life was spent devoted to...

350
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,520
 Buying new products.

351
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:53,520
 Devoting ways to not wash the bed or the books as well.

352
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,520
 So she had to invent waterproof jackets for books.

353
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,520
 So she had to invent a waterproof cover for the bed.

354
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:00,520
 And the floor, it was more bothered than it was worth, frankly.

355
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,520
 But it did happen, it's real.

356
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,520
 That's really good.

357
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,520
 Did you know on floors, these to cover floors with herbs?

358
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,520
 This is just another thing about when you watch period dramas

359
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,520
 that they need to start getting right.

360
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,520
 The first use for mint, really, in this country in medieval times,

361
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,520
 was you sprinkled it on the floor,

362
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,520
 because this is when people would sort of stop washing a bit,

363
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,520
 late medieval chewed at times, and everything sank.

364
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,520
 And so what you had was you had lots of mint and herbs

365
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,520
 that you strewed over floors.

366
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,520
 That's really good.

367
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,520
 And like, shake and vac.

368
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,520
 Are there those crisps where you shake the soul in?

369
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:37,520
 Now, admittedly, that is not a 2019 reference.

370
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,520
 Is this as old as these Renaissance books?

371
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,520
 It was what you used to do is when you hoovered.

372
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,520
 This was in probably the '70s.

373
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,520
 So even before I was born, but you would put this weird,

374
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,520
 like almost like washing tablet smell stuff on your carpet,

375
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,520
 and then you would hoover over it, and it would make it smell like the '70s.

376
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,520
 Exactly, yeah.

377
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,520
 It's like that.

378
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,520
 Like the '70s.

379
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,520
 The royal family had a herb struer.

380
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,520
 It was one of the royal court.

381
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,520
 It was introduced by Charles II in 1660,

382
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,520
 and lasted for a couple of hundred years.

383
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,520
 One, you know, you had the groom of the stool.

384
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,520
 You had your laden waiting.

385
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,520
 You had your herbs struer.

386
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,520
 And they had to strew herbs all over the floor.

387
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,520
 All right, amazing.

388
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,520
 I have a thing on sort of alternative alarm systems

389
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:20,520
 to what would be seen as an average one to use.

390
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,520
 This is a very weird one.

391
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:26,520
 There was in Marbella, there was a lady who was in her house,

392
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,520
 and she got...

393
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,520
 Robbers came in, tied her up, and she was on the bed,

394
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,520
 and they were stealing all the stuff.

395
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,520
 And then what happened was, and this is the story that they tell,

396
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,520
 they suddenly started noticing that the woman on the bed

397
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,520
 was in a lot of family photos surrounding the bed

398
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,520
 and bits of the house with the actor, Dolph Lungren,

399
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:48,520
 who is in Rocky IV, he's the big Russian dude,

400
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,520
 quickly realizing that that was the husband of the woman

401
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,520
 that they had on the bed, and thought,

402
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,520
 "We've got to get the hell outta here right now."

403
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,520
 And they bolted for that reason.

404
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,520
 These are really good ideas, and if I live on my own,

405
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,520
 then I get a load of photos with me and Mike Tyson,

406
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,520
 and just pretend that we're a couple.

407
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,520
 And then could happen.

408
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:12,520
 And then when the burglars come, then they'll run away.

409
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,520
 But when he gets wind of that,

410
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,520
 I think you are in serious trouble.

411
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,520
 And we're going to have to move on to our next fact very shortly.

412
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,520
 I've got one thing about burglars,

413
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:27,520
 is that just sort of, I like stories of burglars being caught.

414
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,520
 So there was, in 2015, a burglar was taunting police,

415
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:33,520
 because they'd launched an appeal to try and trace him on Facebook.

416
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,520
 And he was so cocky that he wrote on Facebook

417
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,520
 in answer to the police comment, "Haha, catch me if you can.

418
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,520
 "You won't see me slipping."

419
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,520
 And then a news agency later spoke to him,

420
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,520
 and he said, "I've been walking around near home,

421
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,520
 "so they're not trying too hard."

422
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,520
 And he was arrested later that day.

423
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,520
 That's just the Facebook thing, a very similar thing.

424
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:55,520
 There was a guy who had his house burgled.

425
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,520
 He got back, and it was nothing he can do.

426
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,520
 So he went on his computer.

427
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,520
 And it turned out that while the burglar was there,

428
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,520
 he had logged into his own Facebook account.

429
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,520
 And failed to log back out.

430
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,520
 Oh, wow.

431
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,520
 Cool.

432
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,520
 Between 2013 and 2016, the police in East Kilbride,

433
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:15,520
 Devon, Warwickshire, Camden, and Bristol,

434
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,520
 all issued warnings about secret signs

435
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,520
 that burglars were using.

436
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,520
 And so what they would do is they would put little signs

437
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,520
 on the floor next to some houses,

438
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,520
 and they might be telling people that this has already been burgled

439
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,520
 or that a medium-sized dog lived here.

440
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,520
 Isn't married to Dolph Lindgren, boy.

441
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:37,520
 One of the men supposedly occupants are nervous and afraid.

442
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,520
 But then in 2016, West Mercer Police pointed out

443
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,520
 that all these secret signs, so-called,

444
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,520
 were actually made by utility companies.

445
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:48,520
 And the sign that they said meant nothing worth stealing

446
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,520
 actually meant new landposts to go here.

447
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:55,520
 [LAUGHTER]

448
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,520
 OK, we need to move on to fact number three.

449
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,520
 And that is James.

450
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,520
 OK, my fact this week is that, according to its ingredients list,

451
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,520
 Peperami contains 108% pork.

452
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:13,520
 [LAUGHTER]

453
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,520
 But actually, his pepperami is less good at mass

454
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,520
 than a five-month-old child.

455
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,520
 How is it possible?

456
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,520
 I saw this in an old copy of New Scientist

457
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,520
 and apparently actually it is true.

458
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:27,520
 So this is more of a recipe than an ingredients list.

459
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,520
 And basically, if you're making salami or some kind of cured meat like that,

460
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,520
 then a lot of it is through desiccation is how it cures.

461
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:37,520
 So you would have a load of pork and then you would dry it out

462
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,520
 so it would lose a load of the water.

463
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,520
 So it is possible to use 108 kilograms of pork

464
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,520
 to make 100 kilograms of pepperami.

465
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,520
 So it is true.

466
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:49,520
 A sausage can lose up to 50% of its weight during the curing process.

467
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,520
 And pepperami are very crafty with their advertising campaigns.

468
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,520
 So in 2017, they launched a mass-porking campaign.

469
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,520
 It's weird, because to me that sounds like an enormous PR error.

470
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,520
 [LAUGHTER]

471
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,520
 It was a different time, wasn't it?

472
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,520
 [LAUGHTER]

473
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,520
 Well, they were trying to, supposedly,

474
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,520
 doing it to highlight the growing pothole problem in London.

475
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,520
 And they cordoned off a hundred potholes

476
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,520
 and filled them with pepperamis.

477
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,520
 Great.

478
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,520
 It is as tough as tarmac, isn't it?

479
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,520
 [LAUGHTER]

480
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,520
 Weird.

481
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,520
 They've got strong history in advertising.

482
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,520
 So I hadn't realized that the pepperami man,

483
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,520
 like the living creature that is the pepperami guy,

484
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,520
 was voiced by Adrian Ebonson.

485
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:30,520
 He was this, you know, big epitome of manhood, wasn't he?

486
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,520
 And they've had to review him now.

487
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:35,520
 So he used to be this really masculine macho bloke.

488
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,520
 Oh, not the pepperami guy as well.

489
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,520
 I'm so sorry.

490
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,520
 Oh, he's not being you tree, does he?

491
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,520
 [LAUGHTER]

492
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,520
 Oh, yes.

493
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,520
 No, God, I don't want to spend that room

494
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,520
 about the pepperami guy.

495
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,520
 No.

496
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,520
 No, it's pepperami too, actually.

497
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,520
 [LAUGHTER]

498
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,520
 Yeah.

499
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:54,520
 [APPLAUSE]

500
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:58,520
 He's-- he has been modernized because of us.

501
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,520
 What is he doing at Tuxedo?

502
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,520
 He's just a dedicated pork man.

503
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,520
 They're just making him have a less innuendo

504
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:07,520
 and macho behaviour to cater to a younger generation

505
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,520
 and less tolerant of 90s culture.

506
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,520
 I'm dried meat.

507
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:14,520
 [LAUGHTER]

508
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,520
 So dried meat is pretty much the old--

509
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,520
 one of the oldest meals we know about existing.

510
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,520
 So let's see the iceman, a longstanding friend of the podcast,

511
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,520
 and a dead mummy found in the Alps.

512
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,520
 One of his last meals was go to jerky.

513
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,520
 Hi.

514
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,520
 And so it's amazing how they found it out.

515
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,520
 So they, you know, they found him frozen up in the Alps

516
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:38,520
 very well preserved, not perfectly preserved, he's a mummy.

517
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,520
 But they thought well, we could find out what he was eating.

518
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,520
 And his stomach wasn't where it should have been.

519
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,520
 So his stomach was pushed way up under his ribs

520
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:49,520
 because it had moved a bit in the 5,000 years since he died.

521
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,520
 So they had to defrost him for a bit,

522
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,520
 because he's normally kept on ice to keep him that way.

523
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,520
 And then they had to use an endoscope

524
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:59,520
 to pull out these blobs from his stomach and intestines.

525
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,520
 And they had to analyse that and found out

526
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,520
 that it was dried strips of goat meat.

527
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,520
 And that was one of his last meals.

528
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,520
 Wow.

529
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,520
 Amazing.

530
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:11,520
 And it's so well preserved, you could probably re-eat that, couldn't you?

531
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,520
 It's jerky.

532
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,520
 It's jerky, jerky last forever.

533
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,520
 Yeah.

534
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,520
 It's amazing.

535
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,520
 On a low case, just me.

536
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,520
 It's amazing your funding biz keeping turned down, isn't it Anna?

537
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,520
 Are you still wanting to study iceman?

538
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,520
 Jerky sounds nice.

539
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,520
 Just on, this is kind of a salami.

540
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:34,520
 Do you know that salami brought down the people responsible

541
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:37,520
 for the biggest diamondized of all time?

542
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,520
 They were foiled by a piece of salami.

543
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,520
 This is in 2003.

544
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,520
 And basically it was this group of robbers who broke into the vaults,

545
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,520
 two floors beneath the Antwerp Diamond Centre.

546
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:50,520
 And they stole $100 million worth of like diamonds and jewelry

547
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,520
 and all of that.

548
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,520
 It's the biggest ice ever.

549
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,520
 And they didn't know how to get them, whatever.

550
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:57,520
 But in the area, there happened to be a guy living there

551
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,520
 who always had people dumping rubbish on his land

552
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,520
 and used to get really angry about it and constantly calling the police

553
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,520
 and winging about it.

554
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,520
 So he called the police the next day after this big diamond ice

555
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,520
 and said, oh, I'm really annoyed.

556
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,520
 I've got rubbish on my land again.

557
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,520
 There's all this, well, there's some salami for a start.

558
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,520
 Someone's truck salami on my land.

559
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,520
 And there's also some diamond centre envelope,

560
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,520
 which could someone take away.

561
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,520
 And the police went, somewhat.

562
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,520
 Okay.

563
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:23,520
 And it turned out the high skies had gone, they'd robbed all this stuff.

564
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,520
 And then they'd eaten some salami sandwiches earlier

565
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,520
 that they hadn't finished.

566
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,520
 And then they just tossed them in the ground.

567
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,520
 And they found these salamiers and they did the DNA tests.

568
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,520
 And they traced it back to the guy who'd eaten them.

569
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,520
 Wow.

570
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,520
 And then they said they found the guy who'd eaten salami.

571
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,520
 The rest of the pig.

572
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,520
 It's so unfair.

573
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:43,520
 They've been missing from his side.

574
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:47,520
 Not only that, they found the main guy who'd done it

575
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,520
 who was this guy called Nuta Bartolo.

576
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:53,520
 But then they went to his house and they found the salami receipt

577
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,520
 from the butcher's way he'd got it.

578
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,520
 So then they went to the butcher's and they could tell

579
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,520
 where the receipt, what time it had been bought.

580
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,520
 They checked the CCTV and they also then found the guy who'd bought it.

581
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,520
 So there you go.

582
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,520
 Two birds, one salami.

583
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,520
 That's so cool.

584
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,520
 Amazing.

585
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:11,520
 Just on pigs, you know that some people have the ability

586
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,520
 to, if you give them a plate of pork and they start eating it,

587
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,520
 tell you the gender of the animal.

588
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,520
 Oh, come on.

589
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,520
 Yeah.

590
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,520
 It's a genuine thing.

591
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:24,520
 It's all to do with a receptor, which is called Andrewsterstone.

592
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:27,520
 And that's not how you say it.

593
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,520
 So now that we've got that out of the way, let's do the right version.

594
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,520
 Andrewster known.

595
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,520
 It's a steroid similar to testosterone.

596
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,520
 And it's found in male pigs.

597
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:39,520
 And there are certain people who are able to detect that way more than other people.

598
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:43,520
 Now most meats, weirdly, if a pig is castrated, then that thing,

599
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:50,520
 that angestra trombodon gets knocked down, and so you can't usually tell.

600
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:54,520
 However, the European Union is going to say that castration is inhumane.

601
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:58,520
 So a lot more people who have this will be able, as they eat to go, I'm eating a man.

602
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,520
 So is it a nice taste?

603
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,520
 No, it's a horrible taste.

604
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,520
 So these people are just not going to be able to eat meat anymore?

605
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,520
 Exactly, they're tasting.

606
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,520
 Well, no, they'll have to ask for specifically female pigs to eat.

607
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,520
 You can't do that in a restaurant.

608
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,520
 Yeah.

609
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:15,520
 You can't let say, take these sausages back and bring me a male one.

610
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,520
 No, but it's true.

611
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,520
 It's a genuine thing.

612
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,520
 That's amazing.

613
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,520
 And it tastes horrible.

614
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,520
 So that's why they do get rid of it as well.

615
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,520
 That's amazing.

616
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,520
 Do you know what the longest salami ever was?

617
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:27,520
 Well, it was a salami, but do you know how long it was?

618
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,520
 Have a bash.

619
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:31,520
 5,000 metres.

620
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,520
 5,000 metres.

621
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,520
 5,000 metres.

622
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,520
 5,000 metres.

623
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,520
 There isn't room for that.

624
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:40,520
 Anywhere, no one's got 5 kilometres of space to put a salami in.

625
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,520
 Yeah, but for a picnic, you could have it for a picnic, can you?

626
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,520
 Well, if you wind it round.

627
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:49,520
 Well, if you had a very, very long picnic and a very big space,

628
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:53,520
 if you were having it on a runway at an airport,

629
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,520
 you could take the salami there.

630
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,520
 Exactly.

631
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,520
 Well, I mean, it's still long.

632
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:02,520
 It's not that long, but it's 1,152 metres and 16 centimetres.

633
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,520
 That's a long bit of meat, isn't it?

634
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:07,520
 That's an extremely long salami, because down, guess, 5,000 metres.

635
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,520
 We're all thinking, oh, it's not 10 miles, is it?

636
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:14,520
 It was made by a Belgian company called Cox Fresh.

637
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:17,520
 [LAUGHTER]

638
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:23,520
 That was founded by a Belgian man in 1935 called Charles de Koch.

639
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:29,520
 And in 2016, they renamed Cox Fresh Charles,

640
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,520
 which I think is sensible.

641
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,520
 Very wise.

642
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:35,520
 Do we know what happened to the salami that they made?

643
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:40,520
 No, I don't. I imagine they sliced it up and then ate it.

644
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,520
 Story checks out.

645
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,520
 [LAUGHTER]

646
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,520
 And you said that, like, the end of the bedtime story.

647
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,520
 [LAUGHTER]

648
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,520
 And they all ate it up.

649
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,520
 OK, son, good night.

650
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,520
 What do you mean, no?

651
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,520
 [LAUGHTER]

652
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,520
 Stop banging your head on that thing.

653
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,520
 [LAUGHTER]

654
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,520
 Yeah, have a nice clown to kill.

655
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:03,520
 [LAUGHTER]

656
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,520
 This is just another one that you'll like.

657
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,520
 James gets very immature facts.

658
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:12,520
 In Taipei, Taipei was named the world design capital in 2016.

659
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:16,520
 And to celebrate, they had literally a massive sausage party.

660
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,520
 It was at the Taiwan Design Centre.

661
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:21,520
 And they made it all completely sausage-themed.

662
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:25,520
 So it featured a smoky-centred sausage mist that descends upon visitors

663
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,520
 as they enter.

664
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,520
 [LAUGHTER]

665
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,520
 That sounds quite nice, doesn't it, really?

666
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:35,520
 I'm so glad we picked Bryson home of vegetarianism to bring these facts.

667
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,520
 They had a sausage festoon chandelier.

668
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,520
 Very classy.

669
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,520
 And then some sausage carnival games.

670
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:45,520
 And the whole sausage fest was put together by a designer called Alice Wang.

671
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,520
 [LAUGHTER]

672
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:51,520
 Oh, we're going to have to move on. Should we go for it?

673
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,520
 Yeah.

674
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,520
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show.

675
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,520
 And that is Chazinski.

676
00:29:56,520 --> 00:30:01,520
 My fact this week is that baby songbirds have inbuilt nappies.

677
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,520
 This is great. They don't need pamphlets.

678
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,520
 They've already got them within themselves, literally.

679
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,520
 They're called fecal sacs.

680
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,520
 And they are for particularly common--

681
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,520
 So quite as good branding as pamphlets, isn't it?

682
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:15,520
 [LAUGHTER]

683
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,520
 They need to work on their PR strategies.

684
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,520
 It's most common in passerine birds, which are basically songbirds.

685
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,520
 So birds like robins and bluebirds.

686
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:27,520
 And they're basically-- it's only for nestlings, so it's only when they're babies and they're in the nest.

687
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:31,520
 And you can't leave your poo just all over the nest, because that's very unhygienic.

688
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:37,520
 And so what the little nestlings do when they need to go to the loo is they turn their rear end towards their parent.

689
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,520
 They point their ass out their parent.

690
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:43,520
 And they eject this white bag of poo that's encased in a mucus membrane.

691
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,520
 And they eject it out the parent, which flies away and disposes of it.

692
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,520
 It's incredible.

693
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,520
 Yeah.

694
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,520
 It's really cool.

695
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,520
 They sometimes eat it.

696
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,520
 Sometimes eat it as well, yeah?

697
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,520
 For a really cool reason, right?

698
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:58,520
 Well, no, because sometimes the baby has not digested everything inside it.

699
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:03,520
 So what you are effectively getting is like a packaged dim sum of just--

700
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:06,520
 [LAUGHTER]

701
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:09,520
 It's just like a capsule and you take it in.

702
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:12,520
 And so the birds get a lot of nutrients from it, because yeah, it's not fully digested.

703
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,520
 Yeah, yeah.

704
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:18,520
 And also, the other advantage is if you swallow it, or indeed if you take it away,

705
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:23,520
 it means that no predators will find it, because it smells, and it would attract predators otherwise.

706
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,520
 Yeah.

707
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,520
 And literally, it comes with a handle.

708
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,520
 No, it doesn't.

709
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:27,520
 It does.

710
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,520
 It comes with a little handle.

711
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,520
 What?

712
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,520
 It's amazing.

713
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,520
 Like a briefcase.

714
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,520
 [LAUGHTER]

715
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,520
 Yeah.

716
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,520
 Or a plastic bag, or--

717
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,520
 Yeah.

718
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,520
 And if you put a handle, really, is what it is.

719
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,520
 [LAUGHTER]

720
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,520
 And do they-- can they swap their beak through the handle?

721
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,520
 It doesn't feel like it's going to be that big.

722
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,520
 I think they grab the handle with the beak and then they take it away.

723
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:50,520
 Or they have to do a lot of it, because every baby bird produces one fecal-like every hour throughout the day.

724
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:56,520
 So a lot of the parent's job is just distributing this stuff all around away from the nest to trick predators.

725
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,520
 Or avoid predators.

726
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:00,520
 That's the other reason for eating it is so that they don't have to leave.

727
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,520
 Because they're lazy.

728
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,520
 No, no, no.

729
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:06,520
 As in, you're immediately disposing of the evidence that would draw predators.

730
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,520
 So quickly eat the poo of your child.

731
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:11,520
 And then there are-- there's no kids here.

732
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:16,520
 You know, you can't see no what, even when surrounded by muggers, I would not--

733
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,520
 [LAUGHTER]

734
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:22,520
 Most muggers don't track their victims by sniffing out their baby's feces.

735
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:25,520
 We've never heard of police, give it out for a guy.

736
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:28,520
 Well, fortunately, the potential victim ate his own shit.

737
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:31,520
 [LAUGHTER]

738
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:37,520
 Blue birds have been seen festooning fence posts and utility poles with these fecal sex.

739
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,520
 Wow.

740
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,520
 Like a dog walker might do with a dog poo fight.

741
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,520
 Oh, cool.

742
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,520
 And there was white white white, they do that.

743
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,520
 No, we don't know.

744
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:48,520
 It could be to say that this is my territory, for instance.

745
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:52,520
 Or it could be like, they're claiming they were going to walk back that way and put it in a bin.

746
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,520
 And then they forgot.

747
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,520
 Yeah.

748
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,520
 I think black birds do this as well.

749
00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:00,520
 And I've found that there's a black bird in Tibet.

750
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,520
 It's the Tibetan black bird.

751
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:05,520
 And that, like a species.

752
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,520
 It's a species.

753
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,520
 It's called the Tibetan black bird.

754
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:11,520
 It's Latin name is Tertus Maximus.

755
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:14,520
 [LAUGHTER]

756
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,520
 Well, they're Tertus, Tertus.

757
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,520
 Quo's, aren't they?

758
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,520
 Right.

759
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,520
 I think that's the thrushes.

760
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,520
 The thrushes is Tertus, Tertus.

761
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,520
 Yeah.

762
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,520
 Yeah.

763
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,520
 Very sturdy.

764
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:25,520
 The great horn bill is another bird that does exciting stuff with poo.

765
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,520
 So this is-- they look very cool.

766
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,520
 They've got big bills.

767
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:32,520
 They hang around in India, Southeast Asia, that part of the world.

768
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:35,520
 And they do a cool thing when they're rearing their chicks,

769
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:38,520
 which is that they build themselves a little prison.

770
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:41,520
 The mother basically goes into this big hollow in a large--

771
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,520
 in a big factory trunk.

772
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,520
 So it builds a big hollow.

773
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,520
 And then she seals up the hole opening with her own feces.

774
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,520
 So she makes plaster out of her feces.

775
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:51,520
 She closes them all in to the completely trapped.

776
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:54,520
 And she creates this tiny little slit in the feces.

777
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,520
 And that is where her mate, the father,

778
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,520
 will come and deliver food to all of them.

779
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,520
 So they have to sit inside this prison for ages.

780
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,520
 The mate delivers food through this little letterbox.

781
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:05,520
 And it's also where she has to avoid the feces of her chicks.

782
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,520
 So every time one of the chicks poos,

783
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,520
 then they have to squash it out this letterbox.

784
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,520
 And then you also receive food through the same entrance,

785
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,520
 which is a very hygienic tool.

786
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,520
 People have been doing that in my letterbox as well.

787
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,520
 I'm not sure.

788
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:23,520
 Yeah, Sally, I don't know if they migrate all the way to North London.

789
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,520
 So, keeping another explanation.

790
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:29,520
 I was looking at a bird that benefits from other animals poo.

791
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:34,520
 So there's a vulture in Egypt called the Egyptian Vulture.

792
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,520
 Amazing.

793
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:39,520
 Well, do they get these names?

794
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:45,520
 And so what it does is it goes to cow dung.

795
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:48,520
 And it finds the yellow bits of cow dung.

796
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:52,520
 And it starts eating it and sort of scrubbing its face inside.

797
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:55,520
 And the reason for that is it's helping its beak to go

798
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,520
 to the brightest yellow that it can go.

799
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:00,520
 So it's effectively a sort of make up that it puts on to itself.

800
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:03,520
 But sort of actually enhances the yellowness anyway of their beak,

801
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,520
 like a exfoliating kind of thing.

802
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,520
 And is that a do-it-right mate?

803
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,520
 Didn't read that far in the article, but yeah, I'm at it.

804
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:11,520
 Oh, yeah, it is.

805
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,520
 Yeah, we both did read the article.

806
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,520
 Great.

807
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:17,520
 So it's the carotenoids inside the poo,

808
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,520
 which makes them go more orange.

809
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,520
 Yeah.

810
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,520
 And it is to attract mates.

811
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,520
 Mm-hmm, sexy.

812
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,520
 It belongs to a sexy orange beak.

813
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:29,520
 Did you know that you drink some dinosaur urine every day?

814
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:33,520
 Yeah, it goes with my 70,000 year old beef jerky.

815
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,520
 [LAUGHTER]

816
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,520
 This is, I think we can calculate it,

817
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,520
 that dinosaurs were around for 186 million years.

818
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,520
 Basically, they had time to drink so much

819
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:45,520
 that almost every single molecule of water on the planet

820
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,520
 has at some point been through a dinosaur's kidney.

821
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,520
 So cool.

822
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,520
 So that's a cool thing you can think.

823
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:53,520
 Next time you're having a glass of water.

824
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,520
 We should talk, I think, because we're talking about bird poo.

825
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,520
 It feels like we're talking about Guano.

826
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,520
 The most--

827
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,520
 Yeah, we agreed.

828
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,520
 Guano is basically as held up the Peruvian economy

829
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,520
 for about 200 years.

830
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,520
 Well, we say held up, even it supported it rather than delayed it.

831
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,520
 It supported it, yes.

832
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:11,520
 So this is bird poo, and it is specifically,

833
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,520
 and burp is an extremely useful fertilizer.

834
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,520
 You probably know you spread it on your fields.

835
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,520
 So it's exported worldwide.

836
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,520
 And a huge percentage comes from Peru.

837
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:23,520
 And that is because it has booby pelicans

838
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:27,520
 and guane cormorants who produce the best guano.

839
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,520
 And it's because they have 80% of the world's anchovy

840
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,520
 and this feeds them up.

841
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,520
 And basically, there are a few little islands that are just

842
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:36,520
 coven in it that get harvested for their poo the whole time.

843
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:39,520
 So there's this one tiny island, Guana Pesua,

844
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:42,520
 where there are only two gods allowed to live on it.

845
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,520
 One of them has been living on it for 13 years.

846
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,520
 He's the only person allowed.

847
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,520
 And he's there to fight off anyone who wants to steal the bird poo.

848
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:51,520
 And then I think it's the case that it's only like every 10 years.

849
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:54,520
 It's suddenly hundreds of harvesters are allowed to come

850
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,520
 and scrape it off the rocks and sell it.

851
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,520
 And then they have to go away and wait for it to regrow.

852
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:01,520
 There are birds living there as well as in their constantly depotits.

853
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,520
 Yeah, constantly leaving it there, yeah.

854
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,520
 They're not just shipping it in.

855
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,520
 These islands are incredible.

856
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:09,520
 Some of them have covered 200 feet deep in poo.

857
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,520
 Whoa!

858
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:13,520
 And the guy is actually living on the island as well.

859
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,520
 Yeah, he lives there the whole time.

860
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,520
 He does say he misses his family.

861
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:21,520
 So America passed a law in the, I think the late 19th century,

862
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:25,520
 which legally allowed it to seize any island which had Guano on it.

863
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,520
 It was so important for them to lie there.

864
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,520
 And when you say legally, it was according to American rules.

865
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,520
 Was it an ex, isn't it?

866
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,520
 It was, yeah.

867
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:35,520
 But in 15 years, Britain imported two million tons of Guano

868
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:40,520
 with just a whole thousands of ships just full of Guano

869
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:43,520
 bringing, you know, and fertiliser yields rocketed.

870
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,520
 Yeah.

871
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:47,520
 It was most of their income.

872
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,520
 For about 40 years, was that?

873
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:54,520
 And there was a guy, there's a guy we mentioned sometimes called William Buckland,

874
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,520
 who was a naturalist.

875
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,520
 And he was around at the beginning of the 19th century.

876
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:01,520
 And he once pranked his Oxford College using Guano.

877
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,520
 So it was in about 1804.

878
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,520
 He got hold of some of this, which was pretty new then.

879
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:12,520
 And he spread it on the grass in the main lawn of his college by night.

880
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:15,520
 And he spelled out five letters.

881
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,520
 And that grass grew incredibly powerfully.

882
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,520
 Go on.

883
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,520
 Which letters do you think he spelled out?

884
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,520
 Was it just Guano?

885
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,520
 Guano.

886
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:23,520
 Guano, yes.

887
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,520
 Yes, it was.

888
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,520
 It's not the best reveal I've ever had.

889
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,520
 Oh, yeah.

890
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:31,520
 I'm kicking myself for building that up to be a big one, you know?

891
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,520
 Yeah.

892
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:36,520
 But they let Guano be strongly up saying Guano in sort of super grass, as it were.

893
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,520
 Really?

894
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,520
 Very cool.

895
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,520
 And that's where the band got the name, isn't it?

896
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,520
 Hmm.

897
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:50,520
 You know, there's a theory that in Antarctica, that in order for penguins, when they're about to go into breeding season,

898
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:57,520
 the way they need ice to be melted in order for them to have a nice patch, they all get together, and they poo the ice away.

899
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,520
 Yeah.

900
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:01,520
 So they all stand and huddle, and they all go for it, and then the heat.

901
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,520
 The heat of the poo melts the ice.

902
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,520
 And then, yeah, that's it.

903
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,520
 But you say this is a theory or--

904
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,520
 Yes, it's a theory.

905
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,520
 No, no, no, they definitely do it.

906
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:11,520
 The thing is that we don't think they do it intentionally.

907
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,520
 Exactly. So it's a theory that they're doing it intentionally.

908
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:21,520
 That is like the scene in Alien Resurrection, where I'm sorry to go all film nerdy here, but the aliens all kill one of the other aliens,

909
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,520
 because they've all got acid for blood.

910
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:29,520
 So to make their escape from the lab they're in, they deliberately kill one, and then it burns through the floor of the room that they're in.

911
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,520
 Hmm.

912
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,520
 And that's what the penguins are doing.

913
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,520
 Yeah, like that.

914
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,520
 Yeah.

915
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,520
 It's kind of what they're doing.

916
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:37,520
 It's always exactly the same as what the penguins are.

917
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:40,520
 They're using their bodily fluids to get through a floor surface.

918
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:44,520
 But that film's not going to do nearly as well if they're just shitting on the lines.

919
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,520
 [LAUGHTER]

920
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:48,520
 Alien squashing over the floor.

921
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:51,520
 [LAUGHTER]

922
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:57,520
 I found another-- and Anna, there's a beetle, which is called the three-lined potato beetle, and in order to protect it from.

923
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,520
 Why is it from?

924
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,520
 I mean, it's from.

925
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,520
 [LAUGHTER]

926
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,520
 Yeah.

927
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,520
 You know, no, do you?

928
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:08,520
 [LAUGHTER]

929
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,520
 So it's a beetle.

930
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,520
 [LAUGHTER]

931
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,520
 And no one knows where it's from, but it's--

932
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,520
 [LAUGHTER]

933
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:21,520
 And so what it does is it has a big problem with predators, obviously, like all beetles.

934
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:25,520
 It's constantly predatored on, and it has--

935
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,520
 [LAUGHTER]

936
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,520
 --professor slowed down.

937
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,520
 [LAUGHTER]

938
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,520
 But no, please don't slow down.

939
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,520
 You know that theory we mentioned earlier, that the boy you have--

940
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,520
 --people are rude to you, the stupider you get.

941
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:41,520
 [LAUGHTER]

942
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,520
 You're saying we've been shooting ourselves in the foot really haven't we?

943
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,520
 We've been shooting five years at five years in.

944
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,520
 There's almost nothing left.

945
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,520
 You brought this on yourselves.

946
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:55,520
 Yeah, so basically, in order to protect itself, it eats toxins, and then the toxins are pooed out.

947
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:59,520
 And then it grabs the poo, and it smothers its back in the poo.

948
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:04,520
 So it means that no animal would ever eat it, because they would die from the poison of it.

949
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:08,520
 But then weirdly, there's a symbiotic relationship with an ant that eats that,

950
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:11,520
 but then protects the beetle as a trade-off.

951
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:14,520
 So no one's going to eat it, but it's never going to get a shag, is it?

952
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,520
 Really.

953
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,520
 There's not a way to attract people.

954
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,520
 There's a smearing poo on yourself.

955
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,520
 It's not a controversial statement.

956
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:25,520
 [LAUGHTER]

957
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,520
 We need to wrap up, guys.

958
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:30,520
 Could I just give, just because this is a bit about nappies, bird nappies,

959
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,520
 just a thing I learned about human nappies.

960
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:35,520
 So people toilet train their kids differently all around the world.

961
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,520
 And I was reading about a few of the different countries, the ways they do it.

962
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:43,520
 So in 2012, a study looked at Vietnam, and found that all the mothers they looked at there,

963
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:46,520
 trained their kids to, we, on command, when they whistled.

964
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,520
 They made it so that they looked for the signs.

965
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,520
 That must have been very awkward at a football match.

966
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:53,520
 [LAUGHTER]

967
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,520
 There was very clever so the mothers basically, when they saw their baby,

968
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,520
 like, it was going to weigh your poo, then they take it to the toilet,

969
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:01,520
 hold it over the toilet or the potty, and they'd whistle while they pooed.

970
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,520
 And it's a bit of a Pavlovian thing, where the babies were eventually trained

971
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:07,520
 to only or poo, only when their mothers whistled.

972
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,520
 And so they could just schedule their poo's in.

973
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:14,520
 It's terrifying power that your mother will hold over you, though, in later life.

974
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,520
 [LAUGHTER]

975
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:22,520
 If you bring someone home that your mom doesn't like,

976
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:25,520
 you could just embarrass you royally in front of them.

977
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,520
 Yeah.

978
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:31,520
 Mind you, as a woman in the #MeToo era, what a great way to deter wolf whistlers.

979
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:34,520
 [LAUGHTER]

980
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,520
 They're not going to do that for long.

981
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:39,520
 [APPLAUSE]

982
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:40,520
 OK, that is it.

983
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:41,520
 That is all of our facts.
