00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.400
 [horn honking]

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.920
 [horn honking in foreign language]

 [upbeat music]

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.680
 Hello and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish"

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.680
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Brighton!

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.440
 [cheering]

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.120
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.480
 I am sitting here with Anna Chazinski, Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin,

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.080
 and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.440
 from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.680
 Starting with you, Andy.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.480
 My fact is that babies who live in London are more rude than babies from the West Midlands.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.680
 [laughing]

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.120
 So what do they, what do the London babies do?

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.720
 They come at you with a knife.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.640
 They don't say "thank you" and they don't say "sorry".

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.720
 And this is a study by Liverpool University, which studied two and a half thousand babies.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.080
 Sorry, it must be babies of a certain age because they don't think any like one month old babies say that's true.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.520
 It's all about the first words that they learn and it turns out that babies in London

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.800
 and Wales weirdly are least likely to include the word "thank you" among their first words.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.520
 And normally babies are quite polite, as in the word "sorry" crops up quite a lot.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.520
 Well they're always fucking up, so I'm not surprised.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.520
 If I shut myself seven times a day, I'd apologise all the time as well.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.520
 [laughing]

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.520
 Hang on.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.520
 They've not shat themselves.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.520
 They haven't gone "oh god, I am so sorry".

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.520
 They've just gone to the toilet.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.520
 That's what's showing yourself?

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.520
 No, that sounds like...

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.520
 If I went to the toilet seven times a day, I wouldn't complain.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.520
 No, when it's in your pants, it's shitting yourself.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.520
 My son doesn't say...

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.520
 And he's a Londoner, I guess.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.520
 What does he say?

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.520
 He says, "No, like a lot".

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.520
 Wow.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.520
 Yeah, you'll be like, "Can I have a hug?" No.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:08.520
 It's really cut me.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.520
 Actually, "No" is one of the more common first words of babies.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.520
 And there are quite a few babies, a high percentage who have no as the first word,

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.520
 say nothing else for the first three months.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.520
 Pretty much they just say, "No, no, no, no, no.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.520
 Like Bohemian rap street."

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.520
 Or to a limited.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.520
 They're just like, "No, no, no."

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.520
 Wow.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:29.520
 He just says, "No."

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.520
 He says, "Mummy, daddy, and guys have shat myself, sorry."

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.520
 Do we know why this is the case?

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.520
 Is there any...

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.520
 And they're not we're doing other ways.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.520
 They just don't like to say, "Please, and thank you."

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.520
 Yeah, they're not...

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.520
 I don't think that notice will be impolite in other ways.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.520
 It's just, yeah, I don't know what the reason behind it is, actually.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.520
 Presumably, their parents aren't teaching it to.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.520
 The more is it quite random what baby knows?

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:53.520
 I don't know if you're going to say...

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.520
 The first word is just a random word.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.520
 It's got to be a word you've heard before.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.520
 I mean, they...

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.520
 So I would have assumed the baby's first word

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.520
 or something the parents are attempting to teach them.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.520
 Exactly.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.520
 Or is it just something that the baby picks up?

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:07.520
 It's from what they hear around them.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.520
 So it means that babies in London are not hearing those words as regularly.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.520
 I think that was a suggestion anyway.

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.520
 Other common first words, or early words at least,

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:21.520
 include carrot, cake, doggie, quack, banana, and bird poo.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.520
 Oh.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.520
 Really?

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.520
 Who's saying that a lot to their children?

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.520
 Is that London-specific?

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.520
 I know that was in this study, it was all regular things.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.520
 And another thing is that this is in all regions, actually.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.520
 One of the names that children are most likely to learn

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:41.520
 after Mummy and Daddy is Pepper.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.520
 That's my son learnt that before he said Mummy and Daddy.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.520
 I'm not lying, Pepper is...

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.520
 He loves Pepper.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.520
 He loves Pepper a lot.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.520
 Yeah, Pepper is his hero.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.520
 Turneric is the other one.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.520
 He says a lot, isn't it?

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:00.520
 That's a London baby all right.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:06.520
 There's surprisingly clever babies, aren't they?

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.520
 They can count from extraordinarily young.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.520
 So they can count at five months old to an extent,

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.520
 which I find incredible, because if you look at a five-month old,

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.520
 they can barely move their head.

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:20.520
 And they're tiny, but there was this study done,

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:23.520
 which basically showed five months old this screen on a stage,

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.520
 there's a big screen on a stage, and then they took out a Mickey Mouse doll,

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.520
 and they showed it to the kid, and then they put it behind the screen,

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.520
 and they took out a second Mickey Mouse doll,

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.520
 put that behind the screen, and then they lifted the screen up.

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.520
 And if there were two Mickey Mouse dolls there,

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.520
 the kid was fine, looked away quite quickly.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.520
 If there were three Mickey Mouse dolls there,

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.520
 then the kid would stare at it for ages,

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.520
 which is the only way that we know if a baby is confused

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.520
 or surprised or anything, as they just stare for a long time,

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.520
 because it's so confused, because it knows it's counted to,

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:51.520
 and you reveal three.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.520
 On the thing about them being surprised and looking at things,

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:59.520
 so this is why Peekaboo is such a great game for babies,

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.520
 and for all of us, actually.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:06.520
 No, so basically they are surprised when things,

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.520
 they like sort of testing, there's a theory of object permanence,

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.520
 which is that, you know, things are still there even when you can't see them.

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.520
 So even if you're hiding, when you appear again,

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.520
 it's sort of surprise and confirmation at the same time that you're correct.

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:26.520
 So babies laugh more in normal Peekaboo than they do in trial versions of Peekaboo,

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.520
 where they add out hides, and then they reappear as a different person.

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.520
 That's not funny to a baby.

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.520
 They like Peekaboo because it's predictable.

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:41.520
 Okay, because they know that it's wrong if they're a different person.

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.520
 Exactly, so they're like sort of, yes, standard stuff.

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.520
 I also did not know that, so they'd love the big bank theory, for example,

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:52.520
 because it's very basic, obvious stuff.

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.520
 The TV show, all the actual theory.

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:01.520
 Very obvious.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.520
 Did you know that Peekaboo is a style of boxing?

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.520
 It's a style of boxing where you put your hands in front of your face.

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.520
 Okay, and then do you whip your hands away and give the man a shot?

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.520
 No, no, you're doing it, and then you whip your hands out of the way

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.520
 and it's Mike Tyson there instead.

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:20.520
 It's not that you cover your eyes because obviously that's very bad boxing.

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:21.520
 No.

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.520
 They're quite interpunching, actually, babies, aren't they?

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:26.520
 Or they can get quite aggressive.

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:31.520
 So this was another study that was done about how our adult behaviour can impact

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.520
 very young children's behaviour.

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:37.520
 And they did this experiment with really young kids, with like young toddlers.

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:43.520
 And what they did was they had some kids watch an adult beat up a punching bag clown,

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.520
 you know, like a big toy clown.

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.520
 So I would have loved to be in the adult in this experiment.

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:50.520
 So the adult got to beat the crap out of this clown and then some other babies...

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:56.520
 You're not allowed back in McDonald's, are you?

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:00.520
 So there was another clown which didn't get beaten up where the adult just treated it nicely.

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:03.520
 And there was another control group that did nothing.

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:06.520
 And the kids who'd seen an adult beating up the clown, not only did they then

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:10.520
 when they were unleashed on the clown beat it to shreds, like really attacked it.

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:14.520
 But they improvised new weapons out of whatever they could see.

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:18.520
 To really try and make it so there was like a dark gun was left in the room

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:20.520
 and there's some quite dramatic footage.

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:24.520
 That's not improvising a weapon.

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:26.520
 Picking up a dark gun.

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:32.520
 Yeah, they didn't build the dark gun out of a mop and an orange.

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:34.520
 Maybe they did.

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:35.520
 There was a dark gun in the corner of the room.

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:36.520
 You can watch it on YouTube.

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:39.520
 There's like a two-year-old kid who goes up to the clown and holds a dark gun

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:44.520
 to his head and starts whispering scary stuff on his head.

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:45.520
 That's the most...

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:49.520
 And then lots of people said, "But it's okay, it's a punching bag clown, it's what they're for."

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.520
 And so they repeated the experiment, but using a real person dressed as a clown

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:54.520
 and they'd also beat the crap out of him.

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:55.520
 Really?

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:57.520
 Oh my god, that's amazing.

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:02.520
 Actually, on aggressiveness in children, I don't have kids, so I don't know if this is common.

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:08.520
 But I was surprised to read that they often bang their head against the bed or the crib or the wall.

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:10.520
 And they'll do this around six months of age.

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:14.520
 Quite a lot of children will just start head-banging things.

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:17.520
 And apparently, the reason they do it can last up to 15 minutes.

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:20.520
 And the reason they do it is it gives them a surge of adrenaline.

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:23.520
 Because if you get hurt, for instance, you get some adrenaline

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:27.520
 and then that helps them to sleep afterwards because they get the surge of adrenaline

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:29.520
 and then it gives them a kind of a downer.

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:31.520
 Apparently this is true.

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:32.520
 They're like this.

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:35.520
 And from the reaction, I think it's not a common thing.

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:38.520
 I've not seen my son do that.

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:41.520
 But apparently, because it is quite relatively...

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:45.520
 It does happen, but whenever any parent sees it, they're like, holy fuck.

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:47.520
 There's a thing that kids have.

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:48.520
 I haven't got any research on this.

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:51.520
 I just remember learning this at the time when I had my son.

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:56.520
 That kids at the beginning, they have no separation between what's...

00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:00.520
 Their vision is quite solid, so 3D objects are not so great.

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:04.520
 But one of the things is perception of size is a thing that they don't fully get.

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:09.520
 And then they hit a certain age where suddenly they realize that they're tiny and everyone else is massive.

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:11.520
 And it freaks them out.

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:13.520
 They're suddenly surrounded by giants.

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:16.520
 And it's a really traumatising moment for kids.

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:20.520
 So you can really take advantage of that moment when you...

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:28.520
 Well, there is this weird thing that we think that they see everything upside down at first.

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:29.520
 Really?

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:30.520
 Yeah.

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:33.520
 So you know this is a thing where you see things upside down because that's the way the light hits your restaurant.

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:35.520
 It hits it in the wrong... it hits it upside down.

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:38.520
 And then your brain reverses the image and you see a correct image.

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:41.520
 But actually, the light enters your eyes and shows you an upside down image.

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:45.520
 So we think that before babies work out how to flip the images because they're idiots,

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:49.520
 they can't see the right way up for the first week of their life.

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:51.520
 So everything is upside down for them.

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:52.520
 That's crazy.

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:56.520
 And also they can do mirror-rising, which I only learned this recently.

00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:58.520
 And to any parent, I think this is quite standard.

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:01.520
 I learned it from a parent who was like, "Oh yeah, she's at a stage where she's doing mirror-riding."

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:03.520
 She was Australian.

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:07.520
 But to her, everything did look upside down because she was Australian.

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:08.520
 True.

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:14.520
 But yeah, a lot of kids, toddler age, the natural way they write is proper mirror-riding,

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:17.520
 like Leonardo da Vinci did, that we can't possibly do naturally as humans.

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:19.520
 And then they just grow out of doing it.

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:20.520
 You make kids that do this?

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:21.520
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:22.520
 It's incredible.

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:23.520
 That's crazy.

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:25.520
 We're going to have to move on shortly to our next fact.

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:29.520
 I just, one small interesting thing, just on the idea of rudeness and babies,

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:33.520
 in Thailand, because of superstitions, there's a common thing that's done,

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:36.520
 which is you never say that a newborn baby is beautiful.

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:38.520
 You always call it ugly.

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:43.520
 So for the first, it's the idea that by calling them ugly ghosts would be scared away and so on.

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:48.520
 And yeah, so for the first few weeks of a baby's life, they're just being called but ugly.

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:50.520
 In the Philippines, is that?

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:51.520
 No, that was in Thailand.

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:52.520
 Thailand.

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:54.520
 I don't know if it happened in Hong Kong, because I used to get called.

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:56.520
 Definitely happened in Bolton.

00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:59.520
 I was a genuinely ugly baby.

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:04.520
 And one of my best friends, her mum, came to see me, first person to see me after I was born.

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:06.520
 And she tells me the story now.

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:10.520
 She said, I just couldn't bring myself to even find the words to say that you were in any way beautiful.

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:12.520
 Or you were just, you were just so ugly.

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:19.520
 And the first thing that was said about me was she looked me went, oh, how interesting.

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:22.520
 And then you worked for the company quite interesting.

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:24.520
 That's how it all began.

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:25.520
 In her face.

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:29.520
 Just on, another thing on rudeness and how rudeness can affect us.

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:33.520
 So there's lots of studies that are done that have shown that it's extremely infectious

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:35.520
 in a way that we can totally understand.

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:40.520
 Because what it does is if someone's rude to you, it takes a lot of mental energy to respond to that.

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:44.520
 It's quite draining, working out your impulse control and not punching them in the face.

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:47.520
 And then you become weaker, your impulses come weaker.

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:50.520
 So therefore you're then rude to the next person.

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:55.520
 And it's to the extent that, and it really damages our mental faculties in various other ways.

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:57.520
 So it also makes us stupider.

00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:02.520
 So as soon as someone's rude to you, it makes you stupid to the extent that if you even read words

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:04.520
 that sound like they're rude.

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:09.520
 So there was a study where people were asked to read the words interrupt obnoxious and bother.

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:11.520
 I don't know how rude that is.

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:15.520
 But after that, they performed five times worse on a mental task.

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:19.520
 So I have fewer to read, for instance, the Daily Mail.

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:20.520
 Yeah.

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:23.520
 Or watch a Winnie the Pooh episode.

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:24.520
 Is that rude?

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:26.520
 Oh, bother.

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:32.520
 Okay, we need to move on to our second fact of the show.

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:33.520
 And that is my fact.

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:40.520
 My fact this week is in 17th century Japan, the super rich would protect their homes from burglars

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:43.520
 by installing musical floorboards.

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:47.520
 So like the piano and big.

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:48.520
 Yeah.

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:50.520
 No, this is not quite that.

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:52.520
 These were called nightingale floors.

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:56.520
 And the idea was that they worked out that in Japan,

00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:59.520
 if you had a palace and you were worried about, let's say,

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:03.520
 you're at the head of the palace being murdered by ninjas or anyone good at creeping in,

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:06.520
 what you would do is you would have creaky floorboards.

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:11.520
 And the creaky floorboards were alert everyone to the fact that someone was there.

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:15.520
 Now, some people just have creaky floorboards, but these were specifically designed

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:17.520
 and they were very expensive to install.

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:21.520
 And what it was was underneath the floorboard that was a nail that went along a bracket.

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:25.520
 And it produced a frequency sound that sounded a lot like a nightingale singing a song.

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:26.520
 The bird.

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:28.520
 The nightingale bird.

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:29.520
 You can see clips on YouTube.

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:32.520
 I was opposed to the Victorian dance.

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:36.520
 [Laughter]

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:38.520
 Like, they were all confused.

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:40.520
 [Laughter]

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:41.520
 Some global clarified.

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:42.520
 Yeah, so it was really cool.

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:49.520
 And my favorite thing about this whole fact is obviously there are people patrolling the grounds of the palace.

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:50.520
 So what did they do?

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:52.520
 Because they need to walk over these floorboards.

00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:58.520
 So what they ended up doing was agreeing on a system of rhythm that would effectively be playing a song as you walked.

00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:02.520
 And if they heard the rhythm, they'd be like, oh, it's Mike, you know, as opposed to...

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:03.520
 Oh, wow.

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:04.520
 That's clever.

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:08.520
 They have in Japan quite exciting sort of burglar defenders even today.

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:13.520
 They have in shops, modern day shops in Japan often have this bright orange sphere

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:15.520
 that's next to the till if you're buying something.

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:17.520
 And what it actually is, it's a paintball.

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:21.520
 And they're trained as shopkeepers in Japan to throw this paintball at someone

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:22.520
 if they try to rob the shop.

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:27.520
 And the idea is that it will leave this mark on them, and then they'll be identifiable.

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:29.520
 So just look for the guy covered in orange paint.

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:31.520
 And they probably get trained in it.

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:36.520
 They get told to throw it actually at the person's feet, because then it will splash up onto them.

00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:38.520
 And they're more likely to get covered in paint.

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:42.520
 And then if you missed the robber, then you have to run out to their getaway car

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:45.520
 and throw the anti-crime ball at the car instead.

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:47.520
 That is pretty cool.

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:48.520
 And the police can find it, yeah.

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:53.520
 I was looking at kind of weird home innovations that have been done, because this is a cool floor.

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:55.520
 Have you guys heard about the self-slucing house?

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:57.520
 The self-slucing house.

00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:58.520
 The self-slucing house.

00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:00.520
 Slucing. Slucing. Slucing.

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:04.520
 The self-slucing house would be a house that solved the crime after it had been burgled.

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:06.520
 It would be a Sherlock home.

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:19.520
 Yeah, this was no-slucing.

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:21.520
 I don't want my house-slucing.

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:22.520
 It's self-slucing.

00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:24.520
 Are you going to explain what a slew-slucing is to that?

00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:25.520
 Yeah, could you tell what it is?

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:26.520
 Slucing is itself.

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:29.520
 So this was okay.

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:34.520
 So it washes, rinses and dries itself.

00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:35.520
 Right?

00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:40.520
 So this was invented in 1980 by a woman from Oregon called Francis Gabe.

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:42.520
 And it was basically the whole house.

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:45.520
 It was a massive dishwasher.

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:48.520
 And so there was only one of these ever built amazingly.

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:49.520
 And she lived in it.

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:50.520
 It was the prototype.

00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:53.520
 And it had a, she was a genuine inventor and a true eccentric.

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:55.520
 Because there was a sprinkling in every room.

00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:57.520
 So she would go around with an umbrella.

00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:00.520
 And she pressed a bus in each room.

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:03.520
 And it just soaked the whole room with sudsy water.

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:05.520
 And then she pressed another bus in.

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:08.520
 And then a second spray would blast it with warm water.

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:11.520
 So all the water runs off in the floor.

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:13.520
 You know, through drains.

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:16.520
 And then jets of warm water, dry the house.

00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:17.520
 Warm air.

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:18.520
 Warm air.

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:19.520
 So what did I say?

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:20.520
 Warm air will dry the house.

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:21.520
 Warm air.

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:23.520
 So jets of warm air.

00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:25.520
 Dry the house.

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:29.520
 But the water that runs off through the drains

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:31.520
 goes through the dog house and the dog gets washed too.

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:32.520
 No.

00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:36.520
 And where do you put the tablet?

00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:42.520
 But then, well, even if, like, things like electronic tablets, for instance,

00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:44.520
 anything electronic would just get...

00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:45.520
 That's true.

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:47.520
 A lot of her life was spent devoted to...

00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:49.520
 Buying new products.

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:53.520
 Devoting ways to not wash the bed or the books as well.

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:55.520
 So she had to invent waterproof jackets for books.

00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:57.520
 So she had to invent a waterproof cover for the bed.

00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:00.520
 And the floor, it was more bothered than it was worth, frankly.

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:02.520
 But it did happen, it's real.

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:03.520
 That's really good.

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:06.520
 Did you know on floors, these to cover floors with herbs?

00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:09.520
 This is just another thing about when you watch period dramas

00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:11.520
 that they need to start getting right.

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:14.520
 The first use for mint, really, in this country in medieval times,

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:16.520
 was you sprinkled it on the floor,

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:18.520
 because this is when people would sort of stop washing a bit,

00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:21.520
 late medieval chewed at times, and everything sank.

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:23.520
 And so what you had was you had lots of mint and herbs

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:25.520
 that you strewed over floors.

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:26.520
 That's really good.

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:29.520
 And like, shake and vac.

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:32.520
 Are there those crisps where you shake the soul in?

00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:37.520
 Now, admittedly, that is not a 2019 reference.

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:40.520
 Is this as old as these Renaissance books?

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:42.520
 It was what you used to do is when you hoovered.

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:44.520
 This was in probably the '70s.

00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:47.520
 So even before I was born, but you would put this weird,

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:51.520
 like almost like washing tablet smell stuff on your carpet,

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:54.520
 and then you would hoover over it, and it would make it smell like the '70s.

00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:55.520
 Exactly, yeah.

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:56.520
 It's like that.

00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:58.520
 Like the '70s.

00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:00.520
 The royal family had a herb struer.

00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:01.520
 It was one of the royal court.

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:04.520
 It was introduced by Charles II in 1660,

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:06.520
 and lasted for a couple of hundred years.

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:08.520
 One, you know, you had the groom of the stool.

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:09.520
 You had your laden waiting.

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:10.520
 You had your herbs struer.

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:12.520
 And they had to strew herbs all over the floor.

00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:13.520
 All right, amazing.

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:16.520
 I have a thing on sort of alternative alarm systems

00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:20.520
 to what would be seen as an average one to use.

00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:22.520
 This is a very weird one.

00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:26.520
 There was in Marbella, there was a lady who was in her house,

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:28.520
 and she got...

00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:31.520
 Robbers came in, tied her up, and she was on the bed,

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:32.520
 and they were stealing all the stuff.

00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:35.520
 And then what happened was, and this is the story that they tell,

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:38.520
 they suddenly started noticing that the woman on the bed

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:41.520
 was in a lot of family photos surrounding the bed

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:44.520
 and bits of the house with the actor, Dolph Lungren,

00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:48.520
 who is in Rocky IV, he's the big Russian dude,

00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:51.520
 quickly realizing that that was the husband of the woman

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:53.520
 that they had on the bed, and thought,

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:55.520
 "We've got to get the hell outta here right now."

00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:57.520
 And they bolted for that reason.

00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:59.520
 These are really good ideas, and if I live on my own,

00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:02.520
 then I get a load of photos with me and Mike Tyson,

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:05.520
 and just pretend that we're a couple.

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:08.520
 And then could happen.

00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:12.520
 And then when the burglars come, then they'll run away.

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:14.520
 But when he gets wind of that,

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:17.520
 I think you are in serious trouble.

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:20.520
 And we're going to have to move on to our next fact very shortly.

00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:22.520
 I've got one thing about burglars,

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:27.520
 is that just sort of, I like stories of burglars being caught.

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:30.520
 So there was, in 2015, a burglar was taunting police,

00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:33.520
 because they'd launched an appeal to try and trace him on Facebook.

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:36.520
 And he was so cocky that he wrote on Facebook

00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:39.520
 in answer to the police comment, "Haha, catch me if you can.

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:41.520
 "You won't see me slipping."

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:44.520
 And then a news agency later spoke to him,

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:46.520
 and he said, "I've been walking around near home,

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:47.520
 "so they're not trying too hard."

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:49.520
 And he was arrested later that day.

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:52.520
 That's just the Facebook thing, a very similar thing.

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:55.520
 There was a guy who had his house burgled.

00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:57.520
 He got back, and it was nothing he can do.

00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:59.520
 So he went on his computer.

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:01.520
 And it turned out that while the burglar was there,

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:03.520
 he had logged into his own Facebook account.

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:06.520
 And failed to log back out.

00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:08.520
 Oh, wow.

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:09.520
 Cool.

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:12.520
 Between 2013 and 2016, the police in East Kilbride,

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:15.520
 Devon, Warwickshire, Camden, and Bristol,

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:17.520
 all issued warnings about secret signs

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:19.520
 that burglars were using.

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:21.520
 And so what they would do is they would put little signs

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:23.520
 on the floor next to some houses,

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:26.520
 and they might be telling people that this has already been burgled

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:29.520
 or that a medium-sized dog lived here.

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:32.520
 Isn't married to Dolph Lindgren, boy.

00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:37.520
 One of the men supposedly occupants are nervous and afraid.

00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:40.520
 But then in 2016, West Mercer Police pointed out

00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:42.520
 that all these secret signs, so-called,

00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:44.520
 were actually made by utility companies.

00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:48.520
 And the sign that they said meant nothing worth stealing

00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:50.520
 actually meant new landposts to go here.

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:55.520
 [LAUGHTER]

00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:57.520
 OK, we need to move on to fact number three.

00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:59.520
 And that is James.

00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:03.520
 OK, my fact this week is that, according to its ingredients list,

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:07.520
 Peperami contains 108% pork.

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:13.520
 [LAUGHTER]

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:15.520
 But actually, his pepperami is less good at mass

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:18.520
 than a five-month-old child.

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:19.520
 How is it possible?

00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:22.520
 I saw this in an old copy of New Scientist

00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:24.520
 and apparently actually it is true.

00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:27.520
 So this is more of a recipe than an ingredients list.

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:31.520
 And basically, if you're making salami or some kind of cured meat like that,

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:34.520
 then a lot of it is through desiccation is how it cures.

00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:37.520
 So you would have a load of pork and then you would dry it out

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:39.520
 so it would lose a load of the water.

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:42.520
 So it is possible to use 108 kilograms of pork

00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:44.520
 to make 100 kilograms of pepperami.

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:45.520
 So it is true.

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:49.520
 A sausage can lose up to 50% of its weight during the curing process.

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:52.520
 And pepperami are very crafty with their advertising campaigns.

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:55.520
 So in 2017, they launched a mass-porking campaign.

00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:58.520
 It's weird, because to me that sounds like an enormous PR error.

00:21:58.520 --> 00:21:59.520
 [LAUGHTER]

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:01.520
 It was a different time, wasn't it?

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:02.520
 [LAUGHTER]

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:04.520
 Well, they were trying to, supposedly,

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:06.520
 doing it to highlight the growing pothole problem in London.

00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:08.520
 And they cordoned off a hundred potholes

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:10.520
 and filled them with pepperamis.

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:11.520
 Great.

00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:13.520
 It is as tough as tarmac, isn't it?

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:15.520
 [LAUGHTER]

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:16.520
 Weird.

00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:18.520
 They've got strong history in advertising.

00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:21.520
 So I hadn't realized that the pepperami man,

00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:24.520
 like the living creature that is the pepperami guy,

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:26.520
 was voiced by Adrian Ebonson.

00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:30.520
 He was this, you know, big epitome of manhood, wasn't he?

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:32.520
 And they've had to review him now.

00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:35.520
 So he used to be this really masculine macho bloke.

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:37.520
 Oh, not the pepperami guy as well.

00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:38.520
 I'm so sorry.

00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:40.520
 Oh, he's not being you tree, does he?

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:41.520
 [LAUGHTER]

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:42.520
 Oh, yes.

00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:44.520
 No, God, I don't want to spend that room

00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:45.520
 about the pepperami guy.

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:46.520
 No.

00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:48.520
 No, it's pepperami too, actually.

00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:49.520
 [LAUGHTER]

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:50.520
 Yeah.

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:54.520
 [APPLAUSE]

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:58.520
 He's-- he has been modernized because of us.

00:22:58.520 --> 00:22:59.520
 What is he doing at Tuxedo?

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:02.520
 He's just a dedicated pork man.

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:04.520
 They're just making him have a less innuendo

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:07.520
 and macho behaviour to cater to a younger generation

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:09.520
 and less tolerant of 90s culture.

00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:10.520
 I'm dried meat.

00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:14.520
 [LAUGHTER]

00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:16.520
 So dried meat is pretty much the old--

00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:19.520
 one of the oldest meals we know about existing.

00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:23.520
 So let's see the iceman, a longstanding friend of the podcast,

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:27.520
 and a dead mummy found in the Alps.

00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:29.520
 One of his last meals was go to jerky.

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:30.520
 Hi.

00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:31.520
 And so it's amazing how they found it out.

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:34.520
 So they, you know, they found him frozen up in the Alps

00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:38.520
 very well preserved, not perfectly preserved, he's a mummy.

00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:41.520
 But they thought well, we could find out what he was eating.

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:43.520
 And his stomach wasn't where it should have been.

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:46.520
 So his stomach was pushed way up under his ribs

00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:49.520
 because it had moved a bit in the 5,000 years since he died.

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:51.520
 So they had to defrost him for a bit,

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:53.520
 because he's normally kept on ice to keep him that way.

00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:55.520
 And then they had to use an endoscope

00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:59.520
 to pull out these blobs from his stomach and intestines.

00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:01.520
 And they had to analyse that and found out

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:03.520
 that it was dried strips of goat meat.

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:05.520
 And that was one of his last meals.

00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:06.520
 Wow.

00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:07.520
 Amazing.

00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:11.520
 And it's so well preserved, you could probably re-eat that, couldn't you?

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:12.520
 It's jerky.

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:14.520
 It's jerky, jerky last forever.

00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:15.520
 Yeah.

00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:16.520
 It's amazing.

00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:19.520
 On a low case, just me.

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:23.520
 It's amazing your funding biz keeping turned down, isn't it Anna?

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:25.520
 Are you still wanting to study iceman?

00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:28.520
 Jerky sounds nice.

00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:30.520
 Just on, this is kind of a salami.

00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:34.520
 Do you know that salami brought down the people responsible

00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:37.520
 for the biggest diamondized of all time?

00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:39.520
 They were foiled by a piece of salami.

00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:41.520
 This is in 2003.

00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:44.520
 And basically it was this group of robbers who broke into the vaults,

00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:46.520
 two floors beneath the Antwerp Diamond Centre.

00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:50.520
 And they stole $100 million worth of like diamonds and jewelry

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:51.520
 and all of that.

00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:52.520
 It's the biggest ice ever.

00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:54.520
 And they didn't know how to get them, whatever.

00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:57.520
 But in the area, there happened to be a guy living there

00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:00.520
 who always had people dumping rubbish on his land

00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:02.520
 and used to get really angry about it and constantly calling the police

00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:03.520
 and winging about it.

00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:06.520
 So he called the police the next day after this big diamond ice

00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:07.520
 and said, oh, I'm really annoyed.

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:09.520
 I've got rubbish on my land again.

00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:12.520
 There's all this, well, there's some salami for a start.

00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:13.520
 Someone's truck salami on my land.

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:15.520
 And there's also some diamond centre envelope,

00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:16.520
 which could someone take away.

00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:18.520
 And the police went, somewhat.

00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:19.520
 Okay.

00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:23.520
 And it turned out the high skies had gone, they'd robbed all this stuff.

00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:25.520
 And then they'd eaten some salami sandwiches earlier

00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:26.520
 that they hadn't finished.

00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:28.520
 And then they just tossed them in the ground.

00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:31.520
 And they found these salamiers and they did the DNA tests.

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:33.520
 And they traced it back to the guy who'd eaten them.

00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:34.520
 Wow.

00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:36.520
 And then they said they found the guy who'd eaten salami.

00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:37.520
 The rest of the pig.

00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:38.520
 It's so unfair.

00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:43.520
 They've been missing from his side.

00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:47.520
 Not only that, they found the main guy who'd done it

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:50.520
 who was this guy called Nuta Bartolo.

00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:53.520
 But then they went to his house and they found the salami receipt

00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:55.520
 from the butcher's way he'd got it.

00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:57.520
 So then they went to the butcher's and they could tell

00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:59.520
 where the receipt, what time it had been bought.

00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:02.520
 They checked the CCTV and they also then found the guy who'd bought it.

00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:03.520
 So there you go.

00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:04.520
 Two birds, one salami.

00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:06.520
 That's so cool.

00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:07.520
 Amazing.

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:11.520
 Just on pigs, you know that some people have the ability

00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:14.520
 to, if you give them a plate of pork and they start eating it,

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:16.520
 tell you the gender of the animal.

00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:17.520
 Oh, come on.

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:18.520
 Yeah.

00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:19.520
 It's a genuine thing.

00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:24.520
 It's all to do with a receptor, which is called Andrewsterstone.

00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:27.520
 And that's not how you say it.

00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:30.520
 So now that we've got that out of the way, let's do the right version.

00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:31.520
 Andrewster known.

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:33.520
 It's a steroid similar to testosterone.

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:35.520
 And it's found in male pigs.

00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:39.520
 And there are certain people who are able to detect that way more than other people.

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:43.520
 Now most meats, weirdly, if a pig is castrated, then that thing,

00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:50.520
 that angestra trombodon gets knocked down, and so you can't usually tell.

00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:54.520
 However, the European Union is going to say that castration is inhumane.

00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:58.520
 So a lot more people who have this will be able, as they eat to go, I'm eating a man.

00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:00.520
 So is it a nice taste?

00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:01.520
 No, it's a horrible taste.

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:04.520
 So these people are just not going to be able to eat meat anymore?

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:05.520
 Exactly, they're tasting.

00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:08.520
 Well, no, they'll have to ask for specifically female pigs to eat.

00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:09.520
 You can't do that in a restaurant.

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:10.520
 Yeah.

00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:15.520
 You can't let say, take these sausages back and bring me a male one.

00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:16.520
 No, but it's true.

00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:17.520
 It's a genuine thing.

00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:18.520
 That's amazing.

00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:19.520
 And it tastes horrible.

00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:21.520
 So that's why they do get rid of it as well.

00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:22.520
 That's amazing.

00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:24.520
 Do you know what the longest salami ever was?

00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:27.520
 Well, it was a salami, but do you know how long it was?

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:28.520
 Have a bash.

00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:31.520
 5,000 metres.

00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:32.520
 5,000 metres.

00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:33.520
 5,000 metres.

00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:35.520
 5,000 metres.

00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:36.520
 There isn't room for that.

00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:40.520
 Anywhere, no one's got 5 kilometres of space to put a salami in.

00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:43.520
 Yeah, but for a picnic, you could have it for a picnic, can you?

00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:45.520
 Well, if you wind it round.

00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:49.520
 Well, if you had a very, very long picnic and a very big space,

00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:53.520
 if you were having it on a runway at an airport,

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:55.520
 you could take the salami there.

00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:56.520
 Exactly.

00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:58.520
 Well, I mean, it's still long.

00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:02.520
 It's not that long, but it's 1,152 metres and 16 centimetres.

00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:04.520
 That's a long bit of meat, isn't it?

00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:07.520
 That's an extremely long salami, because down, guess, 5,000 metres.

00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:10.520
 We're all thinking, oh, it's not 10 miles, is it?

00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:14.520
 It was made by a Belgian company called Cox Fresh.

00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:17.520
 [LAUGHTER]

00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:23.520
 That was founded by a Belgian man in 1935 called Charles de Koch.

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:29.520
 And in 2016, they renamed Cox Fresh Charles,

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:31.520
 which I think is sensible.

00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:32.520
 Very wise.

00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:35.520
 Do we know what happened to the salami that they made?

00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:40.520
 No, I don't. I imagine they sliced it up and then ate it.

00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:42.520
 Story checks out.

00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:43.520
 [LAUGHTER]

00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:46.520
 And you said that, like, the end of the bedtime story.

00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:47.520
 [LAUGHTER]

00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:48.520
 And they all ate it up.

00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:50.520
 OK, son, good night.

00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:52.520
 What do you mean, no?

00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:54.520
 [LAUGHTER]

00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:56.520
 Stop banging your head on that thing.

00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:58.520
 [LAUGHTER]

00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:00.520
 Yeah, have a nice clown to kill.

00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:03.520
 [LAUGHTER]

00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:05.520
 This is just another one that you'll like.

00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:07.520
 James gets very immature facts.

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:12.520
 In Taipei, Taipei was named the world design capital in 2016.

00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:16.520
 And to celebrate, they had literally a massive sausage party.

00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:18.520
 It was at the Taiwan Design Centre.

00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:21.520
 And they made it all completely sausage-themed.

00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:25.520
 So it featured a smoky-centred sausage mist that descends upon visitors

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:26.520
 as they enter.

00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:27.520
 [LAUGHTER]

00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:30.520
 That sounds quite nice, doesn't it, really?

00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:35.520
 I'm so glad we picked Bryson home of vegetarianism to bring these facts.

00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:38.520
 They had a sausage festoon chandelier.

00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:39.520
 Very classy.

00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:41.520
 And then some sausage carnival games.

00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:45.520
 And the whole sausage fest was put together by a designer called Alice Wang.

00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:48.520
 [LAUGHTER]

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:51.520
 Oh, we're going to have to move on. Should we go for it?

00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:52.520
 Yeah.

00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:54.520
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show.

00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:56.520
 And that is Chazinski.

00:29:56.520 --> 00:30:01.520
 My fact this week is that baby songbirds have inbuilt nappies.

00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:04.520
 This is great. They don't need pamphlets.

00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:06.520
 They've already got them within themselves, literally.

00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:08.520
 They're called fecal sacs.

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:10.520
 And they are for particularly common--

00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:12.520
 So quite as good branding as pamphlets, isn't it?

00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:15.520
 [LAUGHTER]

00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:17.520
 They need to work on their PR strategies.

00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:20.520
 It's most common in passerine birds, which are basically songbirds.

00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:22.520
 So birds like robins and bluebirds.

00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:27.520
 And they're basically-- it's only for nestlings, so it's only when they're babies and they're in the nest.

00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:31.520
 And you can't leave your poo just all over the nest, because that's very unhygienic.

00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:37.520
 And so what the little nestlings do when they need to go to the loo is they turn their rear end towards their parent.

00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:38.520
 They point their ass out their parent.

00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:43.520
 And they eject this white bag of poo that's encased in a mucus membrane.

00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:46.520
 And they eject it out the parent, which flies away and disposes of it.

00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:47.520
 It's incredible.

00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:48.520
 Yeah.

00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:49.520
 It's really cool.

00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:50.520
 They sometimes eat it.

00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:52.520
 Sometimes eat it as well, yeah?

00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:54.520
 For a really cool reason, right?

00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:58.520
 Well, no, because sometimes the baby has not digested everything inside it.

00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:03.520
 So what you are effectively getting is like a packaged dim sum of just--

00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:06.520
 [LAUGHTER]

00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:09.520
 It's just like a capsule and you take it in.

00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:12.520
 And so the birds get a lot of nutrients from it, because yeah, it's not fully digested.

00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:13.520
 Yeah, yeah.

00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:18.520
 And also, the other advantage is if you swallow it, or indeed if you take it away,

00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:23.520
 it means that no predators will find it, because it smells, and it would attract predators otherwise.

00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:24.520
 Yeah.

00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:26.520
 And literally, it comes with a handle.

00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:27.520
 No, it doesn't.

00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:27.520
 It does.

00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:28.520
 It comes with a little handle.

00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:29.520
 What?

00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:30.520
 It's amazing.

00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:31.520
 Like a briefcase.

00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:32.520
 [LAUGHTER]

00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:33.520
 Yeah.

00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:35.520
 Or a plastic bag, or--

00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:36.520
 Yeah.

00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:38.520
 And if you put a handle, really, is what it is.

00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:39.520
 [LAUGHTER]

00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:41.520
 And do they-- can they swap their beak through the handle?

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:43.520
 It doesn't feel like it's going to be that big.

00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:45.520
 I think they grab the handle with the beak and then they take it away.

00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:50.520
 Or they have to do a lot of it, because every baby bird produces one fecal-like every hour throughout the day.

00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:56.520
 So a lot of the parent's job is just distributing this stuff all around away from the nest to trick predators.

00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:57.520
 Or avoid predators.

00:31:57.520 --> 00:32:00.520
 That's the other reason for eating it is so that they don't have to leave.

00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:01.520
 Because they're lazy.

00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:02.520
 No, no, no.

00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:06.520
 As in, you're immediately disposing of the evidence that would draw predators.

00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:08.520
 So quickly eat the poo of your child.

00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:11.520
 And then there are-- there's no kids here.

00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:16.520
 You know, you can't see no what, even when surrounded by muggers, I would not--

00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:17.520
 [LAUGHTER]

00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:22.520
 Most muggers don't track their victims by sniffing out their baby's feces.

00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:25.520
 We've never heard of police, give it out for a guy.

00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:28.520
 Well, fortunately, the potential victim ate his own shit.

00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:31.520
 [LAUGHTER]

00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:37.520
 Blue birds have been seen festooning fence posts and utility poles with these fecal sex.

00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:38.520
 Wow.

00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:40.520
 Like a dog walker might do with a dog poo fight.

00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:42.520
 Oh, cool.

00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:44.520
 And there was white white white, they do that.

00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:45.520
 No, we don't know.

00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:48.520
 It could be to say that this is my territory, for instance.

00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:52.520
 Or it could be like, they're claiming they were going to walk back that way and put it in a bin.

00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:54.520
 And then they forgot.

00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:55.520
 Yeah.

00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:56.520
 I think black birds do this as well.

00:32:56.520 --> 00:33:00.520
 And I've found that there's a black bird in Tibet.

00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:02.520
 It's the Tibetan black bird.

00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:05.520
 And that, like a species.

00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:06.520
 It's a species.

00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:08.520
 It's called the Tibetan black bird.

00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:11.520
 It's Latin name is Tertus Maximus.

00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:14.520
 [LAUGHTER]

00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:15.520
 Well, they're Tertus, Tertus.

00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:16.520
 Quo's, aren't they?

00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:17.520
 Right.

00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:18.520
 I think that's the thrushes.

00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:19.520
 The thrushes is Tertus, Tertus.

00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:20.520
 Yeah.

00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:21.520
 Yeah.

00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:22.520
 Very sturdy.

00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:25.520
 The great horn bill is another bird that does exciting stuff with poo.

00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:27.520
 So this is-- they look very cool.

00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:28.520
 They've got big bills.

00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:32.520
 They hang around in India, Southeast Asia, that part of the world.

00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:35.520
 And they do a cool thing when they're rearing their chicks,

00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:38.520
 which is that they build themselves a little prison.

00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:41.520
 The mother basically goes into this big hollow in a large--

00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:43.520
 in a big factory trunk.

00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:44.520
 So it builds a big hollow.

00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:46.520
 And then she seals up the hole opening with her own feces.

00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:48.520
 So she makes plaster out of her feces.

00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:51.520
 She closes them all in to the completely trapped.

00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:54.520
 And she creates this tiny little slit in the feces.

00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:56.520
 And that is where her mate, the father,

00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:58.520
 will come and deliver food to all of them.

00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:00.520
 So they have to sit inside this prison for ages.

00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:02.520
 The mate delivers food through this little letterbox.

00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:05.520
 And it's also where she has to avoid the feces of her chicks.

00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:07.520
 So every time one of the chicks poos,

00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:09.520
 then they have to squash it out this letterbox.

00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:12.520
 And then you also receive food through the same entrance,

00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:14.520
 which is a very hygienic tool.

00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:16.520
 People have been doing that in my letterbox as well.

00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:17.520
 I'm not sure.

00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:23.520
 Yeah, Sally, I don't know if they migrate all the way to North London.

00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:25.520
 So, keeping another explanation.

00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:29.520
 I was looking at a bird that benefits from other animals poo.

00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:34.520
 So there's a vulture in Egypt called the Egyptian Vulture.

00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:35.520
 Amazing.

00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:39.520
 Well, do they get these names?

00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:45.520
 And so what it does is it goes to cow dung.

00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:48.520
 And it finds the yellow bits of cow dung.

00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:52.520
 And it starts eating it and sort of scrubbing its face inside.

00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:55.520
 And the reason for that is it's helping its beak to go

00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:57.520
 to the brightest yellow that it can go.

00:34:57.520 --> 00:35:00.520
 So it's effectively a sort of make up that it puts on to itself.

00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:03.520
 But sort of actually enhances the yellowness anyway of their beak,

00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:05.520
 like a exfoliating kind of thing.

00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:07.520
 And is that a do-it-right mate?

00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:10.520
 Didn't read that far in the article, but yeah, I'm at it.

00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:11.520
 Oh, yeah, it is.

00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:13.520
 Yeah, we both did read the article.

00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:14.520
 Great.

00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:17.520
 So it's the carotenoids inside the poo,

00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:19.520
 which makes them go more orange.

00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:20.520
 Yeah.

00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:22.520
 And it is to attract mates.

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:23.520
 Mm-hmm, sexy.

00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:24.520
 It belongs to a sexy orange beak.

00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:29.520
 Did you know that you drink some dinosaur urine every day?

00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:33.520
 Yeah, it goes with my 70,000 year old beef jerky.

00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:35.520
 [LAUGHTER]

00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:37.520
 This is, I think we can calculate it,

00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:40.520
 that dinosaurs were around for 186 million years.

00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:42.520
 Basically, they had time to drink so much

00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:45.520
 that almost every single molecule of water on the planet

00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:47.520
 has at some point been through a dinosaur's kidney.

00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:48.520
 So cool.

00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:50.520
 So that's a cool thing you can think.

00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:53.520
 Next time you're having a glass of water.

00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:55.520
 We should talk, I think, because we're talking about bird poo.

00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:57.520
 It feels like we're talking about Guano.

00:35:57.520 --> 00:35:58.520
 The most--

00:35:58.520 --> 00:35:59.520
 Yeah, we agreed.

00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:02.520
 Guano is basically as held up the Peruvian economy

00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:04.520
 for about 200 years.

00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:06.520
 Well, we say held up, even it supported it rather than delayed it.

00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:08.520
 It supported it, yes.

00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:11.520
 So this is bird poo, and it is specifically,

00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:13.520
 and burp is an extremely useful fertilizer.

00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:15.520
 You probably know you spread it on your fields.

00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:17.520
 So it's exported worldwide.

00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:19.520
 And a huge percentage comes from Peru.

00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:23.520
 And that is because it has booby pelicans

00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:27.520
 and guane cormorants who produce the best guano.

00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:29.520
 And it's because they have 80% of the world's anchovy

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:31.520
 and this feeds them up.

00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:33.520
 And basically, there are a few little islands that are just

00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:36.520
 coven in it that get harvested for their poo the whole time.

00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:39.520
 So there's this one tiny island, Guana Pesua,

00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:42.520
 where there are only two gods allowed to live on it.

00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:44.520
 One of them has been living on it for 13 years.

00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:46.520
 He's the only person allowed.

00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:48.520
 And he's there to fight off anyone who wants to steal the bird poo.

00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:51.520
 And then I think it's the case that it's only like every 10 years.

00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:54.520
 It's suddenly hundreds of harvesters are allowed to come

00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:56.520
 and scrape it off the rocks and sell it.

00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:58.520
 And then they have to go away and wait for it to regrow.

00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:01.520
 There are birds living there as well as in their constantly depotits.

00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:03.520
 Yeah, constantly leaving it there, yeah.

00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:05.520
 They're not just shipping it in.

00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:06.520
 These islands are incredible.

00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:09.520
 Some of them have covered 200 feet deep in poo.

00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:10.520
 Whoa!

00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:13.520
 And the guy is actually living on the island as well.

00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:15.520
 Yeah, he lives there the whole time.

00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:17.520
 He does say he misses his family.

00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:21.520
 So America passed a law in the, I think the late 19th century,

00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:25.520
 which legally allowed it to seize any island which had Guano on it.

00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:27.520
 It was so important for them to lie there.

00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:29.520
 And when you say legally, it was according to American rules.

00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:30.520
 Was it an ex, isn't it?

00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:31.520
 It was, yeah.

00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:35.520
 But in 15 years, Britain imported two million tons of Guano

00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:40.520
 with just a whole thousands of ships just full of Guano

00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:43.520
 bringing, you know, and fertiliser yields rocketed.

00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:44.520
 Yeah.

00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:47.520
 It was most of their income.

00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:50.520
 For about 40 years, was that?

00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:54.520
 And there was a guy, there's a guy we mentioned sometimes called William Buckland,

00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:55.520
 who was a naturalist.

00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:58.520
 And he was around at the beginning of the 19th century.

00:37:58.520 --> 00:38:01.520
 And he once pranked his Oxford College using Guano.

00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:03.520
 So it was in about 1804.

00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:05.520
 He got hold of some of this, which was pretty new then.

00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:12.520
 And he spread it on the grass in the main lawn of his college by night.

00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:15.520
 And he spelled out five letters.

00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:17.520
 And that grass grew incredibly powerfully.

00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:18.520
 Go on.

00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:20.520
 Which letters do you think he spelled out?

00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:21.520
 Was it just Guano?

00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:22.520
 Guano.

00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:23.520
 Guano, yes.

00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:24.520
 Yes, it was.

00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:26.520
 It's not the best reveal I've ever had.

00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:27.520
 Oh, yeah.

00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:31.520
 I'm kicking myself for building that up to be a big one, you know?

00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:32.520
 Yeah.

00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:36.520
 But they let Guano be strongly up saying Guano in sort of super grass, as it were.

00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:37.520
 Really?

00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:38.520
 Very cool.

00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:40.520
 And that's where the band got the name, isn't it?

00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:42.520
 Hmm.

00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:50.520
 You know, there's a theory that in Antarctica, that in order for penguins, when they're about to go into breeding season,

00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:57.520
 the way they need ice to be melted in order for them to have a nice patch, they all get together, and they poo the ice away.

00:38:57.520 --> 00:38:58.520
 Yeah.

00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:01.520
 So they all stand and huddle, and they all go for it, and then the heat.

00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:03.520
 The heat of the poo melts the ice.

00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:04.520
 And then, yeah, that's it.

00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:06.520
 But you say this is a theory or--

00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:07.520
 Yes, it's a theory.

00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:08.520
 No, no, no, they definitely do it.

00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:11.520
 The thing is that we don't think they do it intentionally.

00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:13.520
 Exactly. So it's a theory that they're doing it intentionally.

00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:21.520
 That is like the scene in Alien Resurrection, where I'm sorry to go all film nerdy here, but the aliens all kill one of the other aliens,

00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:22.520
 because they've all got acid for blood.

00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:29.520
 So to make their escape from the lab they're in, they deliberately kill one, and then it burns through the floor of the room that they're in.

00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:30.520
 Hmm.

00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:31.520
 And that's what the penguins are doing.

00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:32.520
 Yeah, like that.

00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:33.520
 Yeah.

00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:34.520
 It's kind of what they're doing.

00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:37.520
 It's always exactly the same as what the penguins are.

00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:40.520
 They're using their bodily fluids to get through a floor surface.

00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:44.520
 But that film's not going to do nearly as well if they're just shitting on the lines.

00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:46.520
 [LAUGHTER]

00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:48.520
 Alien squashing over the floor.

00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:51.520
 [LAUGHTER]

00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:57.520
 I found another-- and Anna, there's a beetle, which is called the three-lined potato beetle, and in order to protect it from.

00:39:57.520 --> 00:39:58.520
 Why is it from?

00:39:58.520 --> 00:39:59.520
 I mean, it's from.

00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:01.520
 [LAUGHTER]

00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:04.520
 Yeah.

00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:05.520
 You know, no, do you?

00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:08.520
 [LAUGHTER]

00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:09.520
 So it's a beetle.

00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:11.520
 [LAUGHTER]

00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:13.520
 And no one knows where it's from, but it's--

00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:16.520
 [LAUGHTER]

00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:21.520
 And so what it does is it has a big problem with predators, obviously, like all beetles.

00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:25.520
 It's constantly predatored on, and it has--

00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:26.520
 [LAUGHTER]

00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:27.520
 --professor slowed down.

00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:30.520
 [LAUGHTER]

00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:33.520
 But no, please don't slow down.

00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:36.520
 You know that theory we mentioned earlier, that the boy you have--

00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:38.520
 --people are rude to you, the stupider you get.

00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:41.520
 [LAUGHTER]

00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:43.520
 You're saying we've been shooting ourselves in the foot really haven't we?

00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:45.520
 We've been shooting five years at five years in.

00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:47.520
 There's almost nothing left.

00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:49.520
 You brought this on yourselves.

00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:55.520
 Yeah, so basically, in order to protect itself, it eats toxins, and then the toxins are pooed out.

00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:59.520
 And then it grabs the poo, and it smothers its back in the poo.

00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:04.520
 So it means that no animal would ever eat it, because they would die from the poison of it.

00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:08.520
 But then weirdly, there's a symbiotic relationship with an ant that eats that,

00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:11.520
 but then protects the beetle as a trade-off.

00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:14.520
 So no one's going to eat it, but it's never going to get a shag, is it?

00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:16.520
 Really.

00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:18.520
 There's not a way to attract people.

00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:20.520
 There's a smearing poo on yourself.

00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:22.520
 It's not a controversial statement.

00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:25.520
 [LAUGHTER]

00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:26.520
 We need to wrap up, guys.

00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:30.520
 Could I just give, just because this is a bit about nappies, bird nappies,

00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:32.520
 just a thing I learned about human nappies.

00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:35.520
 So people toilet train their kids differently all around the world.

00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:38.520
 And I was reading about a few of the different countries, the ways they do it.

00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:43.520
 So in 2012, a study looked at Vietnam, and found that all the mothers they looked at there,

00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:46.520
 trained their kids to, we, on command, when they whistled.

00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:48.520
 They made it so that they looked for the signs.

00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:50.520
 That must have been very awkward at a football match.

00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:53.520
 [LAUGHTER]

00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:56.520
 There was very clever so the mothers basically, when they saw their baby,

00:41:56.520 --> 00:41:58.520
 like, it was going to weigh your poo, then they take it to the toilet,

00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:01.520
 hold it over the toilet or the potty, and they'd whistle while they pooed.

00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:04.520
 And it's a bit of a Pavlovian thing, where the babies were eventually trained

00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:07.520
 to only or poo, only when their mothers whistled.

00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:10.520
 And so they could just schedule their poo's in.

00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:14.520
 It's terrifying power that your mother will hold over you, though, in later life.

00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:16.520
 [LAUGHTER]

00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:22.520
 If you bring someone home that your mom doesn't like,

00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:25.520
 you could just embarrass you royally in front of them.

00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:26.520
 Yeah.

00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:31.520
 Mind you, as a woman in the #MeToo era, what a great way to deter wolf whistlers.

00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:36.520
