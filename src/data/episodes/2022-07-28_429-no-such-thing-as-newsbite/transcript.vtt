00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.520
 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of no such thing as a fish. It is the super long bank holiday

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.400
 for the Queens Jubilee and so

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:16.160
 We have decided that we are going to take a weekend off and instead of this week

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:22.080
 You're gonna get another one of my compilations from all the best bits from the last year or so of fish

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.400
 Which didn't make it into the final show because they were too silly because they've got the facts wrong

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.400
 Or just basically because there wasn't enough space

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.580
 Since it's the Queens Jubilee

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:38.440
 I can guarantee that for once this compilation doesn't contain anything libelous to the British royal family

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.800
 But I can't guarantee it won't for the next one so you better make the most of this

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.020
 Your Royal Highness if you're listening anyway

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:52.120
 Just one more quick thing before we start this week's show and that is that we have a couple of live dates coming up

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.240
 They will be in Inverness, Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Glasgow and Cardiff

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:03.120
 They are post-poned gigs from earlier in the year that will be happening towards the end of August and the start of September

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.160
 We would love to see you there if you live in any of those places

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.120
 Then get your tickets fast if you don't live in any of those places

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.120
 But you can get to those places then get the tickets as well

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.720
 Because it's gonna be a whole lot of fun in loads of facts loads of silliness

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.960
 And the best way to get your tickets is to go to qi.com/fishevents

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.520
 Anyway, hope you enjoyed this week's show and what else is there to say but on with the podcast

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:37.080
 Mike Tess from Dennis. Hello. Hello Mike Tess from Harkin. Hello. Hello. Hello. Mike Tess from Andy. Hello. Hello. Hello

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.440
 What an awesome chat we're having. Hello. Hello. Hello

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:52.800
 Yeah, he's been trying to think of puns based on TV shows and dugs. Heal or No Heal. The Barkfest show. Oh yeah, Heal or No Heal. Oh Barkfest. Barkfest is a good, yeah. Yeah

00:01:52.800 --> 00:02:03.600
 I'm trying to do something with one of the big news night show. Why don't you just... News bite. Right, come on. News bite. Very nice. There we go. Off we go. Off we go. Off we go.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.280
 He's been sat there for the last 20 minutes trying to think of that.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.960
 All right, we good? Are we recording? We're recording.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:36.000
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from the qi offices in Covent Garden.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:42.240
 My name is Dan Schreiber. I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin and Anna Tyshinski.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.120
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:03:00.400
 And in a particular order, here we go. Starting with fact number one, that is Barkin.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.480
 That won't make any sense.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:15.200
 One thing I found on Alan Withie's page is a thing that he thinks might be the first ever beard and mustache show.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:23.840
 And this was in 1873. What? Yeah, members of the public came to watch bearded men stand on a stage and have their beards judged.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:29.840
 Yeah, so this was set up by a guy called William Holland and it happened in London.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:35.520
 It had quite a bit of momentum behind it. Journalists who couldn't make it to the day because they were busy

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:42.320
 were writing in trying to influence the judges saying a beard has to be like this and giving opinion pieces about who a winner should be.

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:48.000
 So they thought it was going to be massive and it really, really wasn't. It was barely attended.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:56.880
 They thought they were going to have 30 entrants to it, including Mr. Charles Chaplin, who sent in fragments of his beard because he couldn't physically be there.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.480
 Um, it's definitely not. What? Chris, did Charlie Chaplin have a beard? I thought he had a mustache.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:09.760
 Exactly. He says in brackets in his article, but unlikely to be that Charles Chaplin and I agree because this happened 16 years before Chaplin was born.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.240
 Okay, so he couldn't even enter the beautiful baby competition.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:20.240
 Should we go on to some more steady ground and start talking about poos?

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:27.680
 It feels like that's more kind of our direction usually. All right, brings on to solid ground.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:36.000
 Can I just say, can I say that sometime today I got a text from Dan being like, just heads up.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.920
 These are all the facts on copper lights we've already covered.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:49.200
 Why is this bloody podcast? Well, it's literally they've got a massive excel list of all the copper light facts.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:55.840
 It wasn't on any of the other facts, not on, you know, immediate air heart, not on just copper light.

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:04.880
 It's quite impressive. It was so right. That was pretty outrageous that we've never mentioned immediate air heart before, but we have mentioned copper lights 50 different times.

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:13.120
 I think they come out of the tunnels to mate, don't they, moles? I think that's one weird thing about them.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:18.960
 So they're because you can't really have sex inside a tiny little tunnel. So you have to come outside.

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:24.880
 So you could say they're mounting out of the molehill, couldn't you? Yes. Yes.

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:31.120
 Why would why have they not built a big sex dungeon in the mole burrows? I think I've got the birth room.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:37.920
 I think you missed my pun just there. They're mounting out of the molehill. Did you?

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:42.320
 That's why they haven't built it. Yes, so that we can make puns about them coming to service.

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:49.040
 They're very big on comedy fans. Torval and Dean were figure skaters. Famous.

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:56.400
 Who are they? And I know their name. I know they skate, but in what context do they skate? Were they professionals or are they an entertainment thing?

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:02.640
 Oh, yeah. They won the gold medal at the Sarajevo Olympics, whatever that was. Jane Torval and Christopher. Christopher Dees.

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.560
 And for Britain? Or for Britain?

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:10.480
 Yeah, that's basically why they're a really, really big deal here. Probably international listeners are thinking, who the hell are Torval and Dean?

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:17.120
 But guys, they're a huge deal here, because yeah, everyone loved them. They won the Winter Olympics in the 80s.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.640
 And I always thought they were a husband and wife, and

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:25.360
 No. Oh, cousin, father and daughter.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:31.200
 Brothers. You've got it.

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.520
 Detective and villain.

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:43.120
 It's none of the above. It's nothing. It's owner and pet. No, it's nothing.

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:48.480
 It's they were just friends and they've snogged once at the back of a bus when they were 14 before they were even partners.

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:53.600
 And then that was the end and they were just really great friends, but they had to spend so much of their lives together.

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:58.800
 So they both say their spouses took it took a lot to persuade them that this was okay.

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:04.640
 And they I think just it was only shortly before they won gold that they gave up their jobs.

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:08.400
 I think he was a policeman and she was a worked in insurance. So he was a detective.

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:19.360
 He said when they got it, they I think when they won, when they won, I think it was one of the most watched TV programs ever in Britain.

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:28.640
 It was massive and Dean said afterwards or said in an interview since that the moment that he won it and they won it and breaking all of these records.

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:34.880
 So they got perfect scores throughout that which no one had ever got before and he said nothing had ever affected him so much in his life.

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:39.920
 And then he specifically said, sure, having children is a life changing event, but this was the crowning moment.

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.520
 And I wonder why his partner thinks that.

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:49.840
 Do you know who the first Europeans, I should say, to climb Kilimanjaro were?

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:57.200
 So they were called Mayor and the Purcheller and they climbed it in 1889.

00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:03.760
 But to celebrate the 100 year celebration, they decided who this is, the organizing committee.

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:05.600
 It just says in my notes, I don't know who that is.

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:12.400
 But they decided to award posthumous certificates to the African porters who helped them to get to the top.

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.560
 So obviously they didn't go by themselves.

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:19.200
 So they went to this village called Murangu, which is near the bottom of the mountain.

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:22.800
 And they asked the locals, you know, do you know who did this?

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:24.080
 And they went, oh, this guy did it.

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:33.360
 And there's a guy called Yohani Kinyala Laou who apparently had taken these guys to the top 100 years earlier.

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:34.880
 When he was 18 years old.

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:40.720
 So he was given the certificate despite the fact that if he was that person,

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:42.560
 he would be the oldest man who ever lived.

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:49.360
 He continued to live for another seven years, which means that if this was the guy,

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:56.960
 he died at the age of 125, which would make him the oldest person male or female to have ever lived by three years.

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:57.440
 Wow.

00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:57.920
 I believe it.

00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.680
 It's possible.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:04.880
 I mean, gosh, that clean mountain air really is good for you, isn't it?

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:12.160
 The other option is he was nine years old when he went up and was just under the oldest person ever.

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:14.960
 But no, it's probably a misrememberance.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:16.640
 It sounds like a lie.

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:22.080
 There was a baby born at an Irish petrol station this year.

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:26.560
 It was in Kildare and it was awarded free petrol for a year.

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:27.600
 The baby was?

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.280
 Well, I just parents, I guess.

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:33.440
 Wow, that's great.

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:38.800
 So it wasn't like, you know, sometimes people get christening presents of a case of champagne

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.880
 and, you know, they can't enjoy it for 18 years.

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:41.680
 It's not one of those.

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:44.320
 It's been kept in the cellar for when the baby turned 17.

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:47.840
 They have to do maximum driving.

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:52.640
 These parents have to be driving as much as they possibly can in the area of the service station.

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:54.880
 Right, I'm going to tell you a sort of similar fact,

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:58.800
 which none of you are going to care about or have any interest in whatsoever.

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:02.080
 But I guarantee you there's a slither of audience that might care.

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:07.280
 There was a massive show that came out on Netflix last year called Selling Sunset.

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:10.320
 Huge show on Netflix and has a big following.

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:12.880
 And it's all about real estate agents in America.

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:16.640
 And they're all sort of very beautiful Hollywood characters in it.

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:17.120
 Right.

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:19.920
 They all have really odd names, like one called a manza.

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:23.040
 I just haven't heard a manza before, not Amanda, a manza.

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:25.680
 And then there's a lady called Christelle.

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:27.680
 Right, again, very weird name.

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.920
 Turns out the reason Christelle is called that

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:33.040
 is because her mum went into labor at a shell petrol station.

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:36.480
 And she was delivered there by a member of staff called Chris.

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:39.840
 So she became Christelle.

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:42.960
 Now, it means nothing to you three here, but I'm telling you,

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.600
 it's just blown the minds of about six people.

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:49.920
 Had a really embarrassing thing when I was staying in Sussex last year,

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:55.520
 where there was a post box, which I thought was a post box that it looked like a red post box.

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:57.440
 So I thought it was somewhere where you post letters.

00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:00.000
 And it was like outside the house.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
 So I thought, oh my God, this is so cool.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.760
 The Royal Mail have installed a post box,

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:06.480
 but like in the property of this tiny little cottage.

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:09.200
 And so I posted a few letters into it.

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:11.760
 And then the owner of the property I was renting off came

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:14.240
 and delivered them back to me about three days later.

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:17.920
 I was like, so you seem to have got these letters in my post box?

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:21.680
 Which is where the letter is the letter box for the house.

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:23.120
 It's the letter box for the house.

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:23.600
 Yeah.

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:26.080
 Because what I thought you were going to say is every couple of years

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:30.080
 you see it in the tab lights of some old man who like for 25 years

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:32.480
 has been posting his letters in a dog poo bed.

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:35.840
 Like literally, it's such a common story.

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:39.760
 They did smell pretty bad as he goes back.

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:40.640
 Come to think of it.

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:46.560
 So one of the people who was trapped in Wuhan in China

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:48.560
 when it got shut down because of coronavirus

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:54.800
 was a Mr. Bean impersonator who happened to be there.

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:56.640
 He was at a lab, wasn't he?

00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:58.240
 And he left a fridge open.

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:04.240
 He's a British comic called Nigel Dixon.

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:07.440
 And his job for a living is that he impersonates Mr. Bean.

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:11.680
 So he's extraordinarily popular in China right now

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:14.080
 since the pandemic happened on Weibo.

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:17.360
 He's got hundreds of millions of views for each of the videos

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:18.080
 that he puts up.

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:21.440
 He basically did all these videos about how to treat lockdown,

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:22.960
 you know, how to stay healthy and lockdown.

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:26.560
 So all done with the Mr. Bean suit on, you know, the tie.

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:29.920
 It was him being Mr. Bean on this thing.

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:32.800
 But one of the things that he then did sort of as himself

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:35.200
 without Mr. Bean is he released a video

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:38.560
 which reportedly was him delivering propaganda

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:42.560
 about the fact that China was doing fantastic in the pandemic.

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:44.560
 And this was in early 2020.

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:48.320
 So he said things like once people were waiting for hospital beds,

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:50.080
 now beds are waiting for people.

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:52.800
 And it sickens me to hear of other countries blaming China.

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:53.920
 But for what?

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:56.080
 We're now hearing of cases where people around the world

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:59.360
 have contracted their virus with no obvious connections to China.

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:02.880
 And this was a part of a state's propaganda channel,

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:05.200
 an official channel with China.

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:08.960
 So basically because Mr. Bean as a TV show,

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:10.800
 and I say this is someone who grew up in Hong Kong,

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:14.640
 Han Daoxian Shen, he is ginormous in China.

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:17.120
 This guy, they suddenly had their own Mr. Bean

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:19.040
 who could be used as propaganda.

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:23.520
 But wait a minute, Mr. Bean doesn't talk, does he?

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:25.200
 I thought that was the whole part of Mr. Bean.

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:35.840
 Wow, that is very depressing.

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:37.840
 Yeah, well he's massive there and it was lucky for them

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:41.680
 because he was trapped literally at the heartbeat of coronavirus

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:43.760
 in Wuhan and he defended them.

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:47.680
 And we don't know if that was just him defending them on his own

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:50.560
 or whether or not it was because he was making it specifically

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:52.400
 for Xi'anhua, a news agency

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:54.560
 which is an official Chinese state run media agency.

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:56.480
 Who knows? We don't know.

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:58.720
 Oh, that sounds legally covered dead.

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:01.280
 Thank you for trying yourself on an embarrassing hand grenade.

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:09.280
 Here's a thing, here's a puzzle for you all.

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:14.080
 It's a word you have to guess, five letters.

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:16.560
 It's G-R-A blank blank.

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:18.160
 G-R.

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:21.040
 Is this your, James, are you trying to do an audio version of work?

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:24.960
 Once a week, this is going to be the next big thing.

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:26.960
 Okay, this is going to be great.

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:27.680
 At the tube.

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:29.440
 Okay, okay, I'll say grass.

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:30.720
 Straight in there.

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:31.360
 Anyone?

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:32.880
 Do you want us to say grave?

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:35.600
 I wanted you to say whatever you wanted to say,

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:37.360
 but now you've said grave, Anna.

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:43.120
 That signifies a high mortality salience in you.

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:45.520
 Not in Dan and Andy.

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:49.040
 And apparently this is a test that psychologists use

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:52.080
 to see how much you're thinking about your own mortality.

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:55.280
 And what you can find is that people who think more

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:58.720
 about their own mortality tend to be more conservative.

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:03.920
 So the idea is that the more you think about death,

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:07.360
 the more you kind of try and conserve your own worldview

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:11.520
 and the more kind of entrenched you are in the current system.

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:12.640
 Not saying that this is you, Anna,

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:14.320
 but this is the idea of the researchers.

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:17.920
 And they said that people who did this test

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:20.480
 and went for grave as opposed to grass or grape,

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:23.840
 if they were asked to set bail,

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:25.840
 like pretend to be a judge and set bail

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:27.440
 for a supposed prostitute,

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:31.200
 then they would give an average bail of $455

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:33.360
 compared to $50 who would have said,

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:35.360
 the people who would have said grass or grape.

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:37.920
 So you're a much more conservative person

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:39.360
 according to these researchers.

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:41.600
 To be fair, James, when I said the word grass just there,

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:45.200
 what I actually was thinking of was a patch of grass

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:49.280
 on the plot of land where my mortal remains will be buried.

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:50.640
 So I don't know if that...

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:52.800
 And Dan was thinking that in the way

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:56.480
 that people crush grapes with their feet to make wine,

00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:58.640
 so death is crushing above us

00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:01.360
 and pushing us down and down deeper into the earth

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:03.120
 before we meet our maker.

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:06.480
 Now I was thinking about like, I love green grapes.

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:11.440
 On actually silly mountaineering clothes,

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:13.760
 do you remember in 2016 on International Women's Day

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:16.240
 what a group of Chinese mountaineers did?

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:16.480
 No.

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:19.600
 A group of Chinese male mountaineers

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:24.000
 to celebrate climbed up a mountain

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.400
 wearing dresses and heels in order to experience

00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:28.800
 the struggles and strife of being a woman.

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:31.200
 But yeah, they wore like hot pants and many skirts.

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:31.840
 Hot pants.

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:34.560
 Yeah, so I don't think it was quite the same outfits

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:36.880
 as people in the 1700s.

00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:37.680
 Suspenders.

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:41.360
 This is all the women that I've seen on the internet wear.

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:42.960
 Exactly, exactly.

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:45.520
 They were all wearing very high stilettos and stuff.

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:48.000
 All going, God, it really is hard

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.440
 being a woman climbing a mountain, isn't it?

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:50.960
 Wow, this branch of string fell is at the top.

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:51.920
 It better be worth it.

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:54.000
 What a...

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.080
 As James, you were saying, extraordinary character,

00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:56.960
 Peter O'Toole.

00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:59.520
 His stories are very wild.

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:02.560
 He was a very, particularly in his younger years,

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:08.800
 a tour de force of partying and booze and letharioism.

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:11.440
 He was just a big old character.

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:13.200
 He accidentally, in a boating accident,

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:15.600
 cut the top of his finger off.

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:20.160
 And so he put the tip of his finger into some brandy

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:22.160
 and then he pushed it back into place

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:24.080
 and wrapped it with a bandage.

00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:25.920
 And then weeks later, he removed it

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:28.160
 and found that he'd put it back on the wrong way round.

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:30.640
 And that's where the story ends.

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:32.800
 And I don't know, I've looked at photos.

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:35.840
 I don't see a backward finger on Peter O'Toole.

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:39.440
 Was it nail in or upside down?

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:41.520
 See, the story just doesn't give us any more.

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:42.400
 Yeah, it's hard to...

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:43.760
 No, I think it must be backwards.

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:48.000
 So let's imagine the nail would be facing front.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.120
 It doesn't say how much of the finger it was either.

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:53.280
 It could have been just the very, very, very tip.

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:55.520
 Like, I've cut the very tip of my finger, right?

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:56.160
 Exactly.

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:58.720
 It might not be the whole nail.

00:17:58.720 --> 00:17:59.120
 Exactly.

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:00.960
 But you would assume if it was very, very tip,

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:01.840
 you wouldn't tell it was the wrong way round.

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:02.240
 Exactly.

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:04.240
 You kind of need a distinguishing feature, don't you?

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:04.880
 Like a nail.

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:05.680
 That's true.

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:06.160
 Yeah.

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:08.960
 If you heard him drumming his fingers on the table,

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:12.080
 would you get three taps and then a squelch

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:13.840
 as the soft bit at the front?

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:16.800
 Loved, loved.

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:18.080
 I don't know if he loved a fight,

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:22.160
 but he certainly was in them enough to have some opinion

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:25.840
 that was probably, you know, in favour of.

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:27.120
 Otherwise, you might avoid it,

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:28.240
 but it just seems like he was just constantly...

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:30.000
 That's going to count me out again, Dan.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.360
 He's going to sue, Dan.

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:33.120
 I mean, he's been dead since 2000 or something.

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:33.680
 He's...

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:34.240
 We're fine.

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:35.840
 Who was a hell of a sentence?

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:36.880
 I loved it.

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:38.000
 I didn't give up as well.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.200
 I kept going.

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:40.000
 Passion.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:40.400
 But I...

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:42.160
 I think his kids are going to get in touch going.

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:43.360
 He did not love a fight.

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:45.440
 He quite liked a fight, actually.

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:47.440
 But I read it.

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:50.560
 So I found he was very good friends with Brian Blessed,

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:52.160
 another great actor.

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:53.200
 Was he?

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:53.920
 Very good friends.

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:56.240
 And I read an article where Brian was talking

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:58.080
 about his relationship with Peter at all.

00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:00.560
 And basically, and it's a very long article,

00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:03.120
 every single encounter ended up with Brian

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:04.240
 beating the shit out of him.

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:06.160
 That was the thread of it.

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:09.680
 And it even starts with him beating someone else up

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:11.280
 when he first meets Peter O'Toole.

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:15.120
 So he says that they first met at a party in the mid-50s.

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:16.160
 These are his words,

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:19.040
 where I'd memorably just punched Harold Pinter's lights out.

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:23.440
 He got one right on the side of the jaw.

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:24.880
 And Peter O'Toole comes over and says,

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:25.840
 "Wow, that's really good."

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:28.640
 And then Peter O'Toole, because he's this drunken man,

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:31.440
 any time he was on set with Brian Blessed on various movies,

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:32.880
 Brian would just beat him up.

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:35.680
 And those cases of him dragging him around the house

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:38.400
 as he was crying and throwing his arms around.

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:41.120
 But Peter O'Toole supposedly loved him.

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:43.040
 He said he was the only person who was, you know,

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:45.360
 properly honest and loved him.

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:46.160
 And they were very...

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:47.520
 It actually sounds like...

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:49.440
 Are you sure that Peter O'Toole loved to fight?

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:50.480
 What you've described there is the fact

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:52.480
 that Brian Blessed was a very violent man.

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:57.280
 So if you'd actually given my very interestingly

00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:58.880
 long sentence a chance earlier,

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:03.040
 what I was trying to say was he was always in fights,

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:05.680
 which makes it suggest that he likes a fight,

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:08.320
 even though he was not necessarily the one instigating it.

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:08.720
 Otherwise, why would he not...

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:11.360
 Or at least he had an opinion on it.

00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:13.760
 At least he had an opinion on it.

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:17.280
 One last thing on middle finger is if you do ASL,

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:18.320
 American Sign Language,

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:23.120
 then you can kind of make what you're saying profane

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:24.800
 by doing it with your middle finger.

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:28.720
 So for instance, if you do the sign for mother,

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:31.280
 but instead of pointing with the fingers

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:32.160
 you're supposed to point with,

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:33.680
 you point with your middle finger,

00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:36.160
 it means motherfucker, for instance.

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:39.200
 And there's a few other things.

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:43.120
 Like for instance, the sign for a hearing person

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:45.680
 is kind of you do a little gesture around your mouth.

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:49.200
 And if you do it with your middle finger,

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:51.600
 then it's like, say, fucking hearing people.

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:54.480
 You know what I mean? It's a way of saying

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:57.120
 like what you want to say is actually quite profane.

00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:59.680
 And they think this might be quite a new thing

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:03.600
 because there is a very old ASL symbol,

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:08.880
 which is having your forearm facing upwards

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:10.400
 and then doing the middle finger.

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:13.760
 And that is the sign for the CS Tower

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:16.160
 or the CN Tower in North America,

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:17.280
 those two big buildings.

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:20.240
 Basically, you have to do the middle finger

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:22.800
 and that is the sign for those buildings.

00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:25.920
 For the CN, for the towers?

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:29.200
 So the CN Tower in Seattle or the CS Tower,

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:30.720
 which is in I think Chicago,

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:31.840
 but I can't remember.

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:33.200
 If you want to do a sign for that,

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:35.520
 you basically just do the finger.

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:38.640
 Do you think that's because the CN Tower is CNT?

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:42.640
 It really is not that.

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:46.480
 It's because it's got a spiky bit at the top.

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:48.720
 Yeah, yeah, whatever.

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:50.960
 I'm going to assume it's calling someone the C word.

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:52.160
 That's rude.

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:56.160
 My favorite river that I've recently read about

00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:57.760
 is the Congo River,

00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:00.320
 only because it's so unfathomably deep.

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:02.880
 And I kind of mean unfathomably literally there.

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:05.040
 So it's the deepest river in the world.

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:07.600
 It's 220 meters deep at the bottom.

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:10.560
 There's no light can penetrate that low.

00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:14.160
 And I realized that if you put all of London

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:16.320
 into the deepest bit of the Congo River,

00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:18.800
 only six buildings poke out of the top of it.

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:23.120
 So building you see the tip of is the cheese grater.

00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:25.200
 That's 225 meters.

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:27.520
 And then the rest of us are all submerged.

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:29.360
 Is the shard submerged?

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:31.680
 Yeah, shards are taller.

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:33.680
 Shards are the highest, I think, tallest.

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:37.760
 But yeah, so if that does happen,

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:40.000
 we all have to flee to the top of the shard, I guess.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.680
 That's going to be the least of our problems

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:45.040
 if all of the buildings in London

00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:46.640
 get taken to the Congo River.

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:49.520
 I don't know how we've woken up

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:51.840
 with this situation being as it is, but...

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:54.240
 You've got to deal with it.

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:55.120
 That's really cool.

00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:57.200
 That's good. Yeah, I don't think of rivers being

00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:58.240
 anywhere near that deep.

00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:01.360
 And I guess the point is that most of them are not, but this one is.

00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:02.240
 Yeah. Yeah.

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:04.560
 Okay, I'm done. I can't touch the bottom, Andy, even on tiptoes.

00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:09.840
 There was advice literature about beards

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:11.360
 that you could get back in the day

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:14.480
 in the time of the Beard Mania.

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:18.560
 And one of the best ones, again, to Dr. Whitty,

00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:22.240
 was don't a manual of mistakes and improprieties,

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:24.880
 more or less prevalent in conduct and speech.

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:26.720
 And this was like a little pamphlet.

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:30.160
 On every page, it told you stuff you weren't allowed to do.

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:32.800
 At no stage did it tell you what you could do instead.

00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:34.400
 It only told you what you couldn't do.

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:37.920
 And on one page, it says that if men have beards or whiskers,

00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:41.040
 you should be careful to wash them after smoking

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:44.240
 and should not get in the habit of pulling your whiskers

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:47.440
 or justing your hair or otherwise fingering yourself.

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:50.400
 Sensible advice then, sensible advice now.

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:53.600
 Yeah. Some things don't age.

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:55.440
 But what am I supposed to do with these fingers?

00:23:55.440 --> 00:24:00.480
 The funny thing about omelettes is that I've had maybe 20, 30,

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:01.840
 maybe even 40 different kinds of omelettes.

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:03.360
 They all tasted the same.

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:05.840
 I've never had an omelette that I can differentiate.

00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:07.920
 This is a taste bud thing, isn't it, Athena?

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:11.600
 I mean, that sounds like you need to get your taste buds looked at.

00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:14.640
 But specifically, a cheese omelette, a mushy one, a spinach omelette,

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:16.160
 it's a small egg to me.

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:17.760
 Don't you feel that way?

00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:20.080
 I do feel that way, actually.

00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:22.000
 You can taste the mushroom within it, right?

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.800
 But at the same time, I think what the egg does

00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:26.000
 is it overpowers everything.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.280
 So it doesn't matter what you put in it.

00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:28.320
 It's just an omelette.

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:29.360
 It is powerful.

00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:30.800
 You should try eggless omelette.

00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:31.840
 That's what you need.

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:33.600
 Oh, that's the cheese sandwich.

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:35.440
 That's what that is and it's better.

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:38.640
 On the Challenger expedition, which I had never read about,

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:41.040
 they collected 4,800 new species.

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:44.160
 They found the Marianas Trench on the expedition.

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:45.120
 That's incredible.

00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:45.520
 Yeah.

00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:47.920
 Did they just have 7 miles of cable or whatever it was?

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:49.600
 I actually don't know how long--

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:50.720
 Solnar, I think, maybe?

00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:51.360
 Yeah.

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:52.320
 In the 1880s?

00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:53.520
 Yeah, so it was weird.

00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:54.320
 No, maybe.

00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:55.040
 I'm not sure.

00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:56.240
 That's incredible.

00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:58.000
 Yeah, I can't remember anything about it,

00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.360
 but it does sound like an amazing expedition.

00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:00.400
 Yeah, yeah.

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:04.720
 Maybe it was I once dropped a can of Coke into the ocean,

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:07.440
 very shallow, and it hit the bottom and came back up.

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:08.640
 So maybe that's what they did.

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:09.520
 Maybe they had sort of a--

00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:10.640
 What are you even talking about?

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:12.240
 Well, maybe they got over the Marianas Trench

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:13.520
 dropping a can of soda over it.

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:14.800
 Was it Diet Coke?

00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:15.840
 It was-- I can't remember actually.

00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:18.320
 Just Diet Coke floats and normal Coke sinks.

00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:20.080
 Ah, so it must have been sealed?

00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:21.280
 Yeah, sealed, yeah.

00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:23.520
 Hang on, it went to the bottom and it came back up again.

00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:23.760
 Yeah.

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:25.520
 And you're suggesting that maybe they timed

00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:26.960
 how long it took to come back?

00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:29.040
 I'm just trying to spitball how this happened,

00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:31.520
 and I just know that I've had practical experience with--

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:32.320
 Did that?

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:34.320
 What practical experience have you had, Andy?

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:35.840
 Well--

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:37.440
 Yeah, people in glass houses.

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:38.800
 I've never dropped a can.

00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:39.840
 Compared to the rest of us,

00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:40.720
 that is an expert.

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:43.680
 With his one experiment.

00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:44.640
 So hang on.

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:46.000
 It went all the way to the bottom.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:46.720
 Who knows?

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:47.440
 No, no, no.

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:49.520
 You know, because this is your experiment,

00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:50.480
 it went all the way to the bottom

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:51.920
 and it came all the way back up to the top.

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:54.080
 Well, what I did was I did it in a swimming pool

00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:55.440
 and then in shallow water,

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:56.720
 and then when we were out on a boat,

00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:57.920
 we put a Coke can in.

00:25:57.920 --> 00:25:59.920
 It disappeared for something like five minutes

00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:01.040
 and then it bobbed back up.

00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:01.920
 That's really interesting.

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:03.440
 Could be a change in pressure, I guess.

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:04.560
 Could be an octopus holding it.

00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:08.240
 Read the back.

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:09.200
 Hate Diet Coke.

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:10.640
 Toss it back up.

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:13.200
 Why has Diet Coke never come down?

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:14.000
 What's going on?

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.360
 Wow.

00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:17.360
 That's proper science, I would say.

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:18.000
 That is proper science.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:18.480
 That was a proper science experiment.

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:22.720
 Yeah, you would have been on this expedition.

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:24.800
 I'm not suggesting that this is a real thing.

00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:27.600
 Do you know where the largest

00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:29.680
 man-made waterfall in the world is?

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:31.200
 Do you know who owns it?

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:31.840
 Man-made?

00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:34.400
 Who owns the largest man-made waterfall in the world?

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:35.840
 So we're more likely to get who owns it

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:37.440
 rather than where it is, is what you're saying.

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:39.120
 Is it a squillionaire who we've heard of?

00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:40.000
 Yes.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000
 Have they recently been to space?

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.840
 They have not.

00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:44.560
 Mosque.

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:45.280
 Elon Musk.

00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:45.520
 No.

00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:47.120
 Bill Gates.

00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:50.640
 No, think of someone who has got no taste whatsoever.

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:51.280
 Trump.

00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:51.840
 Trump, you're kidding.

00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:53.360
 How did you all get that straight away?

00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:56.000
 Amazing.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000
 I feel like that clue was too easy to get.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.760
 This is at the Trump National Westchester Golf Course.

00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:05.520
 And basically every one of his courses has a fake waterfall

00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:08.320
 and each one is more tacky than the previous.

00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:09.280
 And they're so huge.

00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:10.800
 If you're playing anywhere near them,

00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:12.160
 you can't hear anyone speak

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:14.400
 because there's so much water going over the top of them.

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:19.840
 And this one at Westchester is the world's biggest.

00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:22.320
 There is one at Changi Airport,

00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:24.640
 which looks really big to me

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:26.080
 and possibly could be bigger,

00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:27.680
 but according to Guinness Book of Records,

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:28.400
 this is the biggest.

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:29.120
 Wow.

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:30.240
 Do you know how tall it is?

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:30.720
 Did you say?

00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:32.160
 I don't.

00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:38.480
 I think it's 5,000 gallons go over every minute or second

00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:39.600
 because I'm going off memory.

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:40.240
 But there's a lot of water.

00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:41.040
 Okay, working out from that.

00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:41.280
 Yeah.

00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:45.840
 But another fake waterfall can be found in Australia

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:48.080
 and can be seen on our TV from time to time.

00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:49.200
 Can you guess where that might be?

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:50.640
 Credits of neighbors.

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:52.080
 No.

00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:53.440
 The Herbal Lessons is adverse.

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:55.200
 It's on TV.

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:55.760
 On TV.

00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:56.400
 In Australia.

00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:57.680
 So when do we see Australia on TV?

00:27:57.680 --> 00:27:58.800
 Oh, so maybe Eris Rock?

00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:01.600
 Is there like a weird bit of water that comes down?

00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:03.120
 Water comes down there occasionally,

00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:04.640
 but Eris Rock, I don't know if you know,

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:06.640
 or Uluru, is not a fake rock.

00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:07.440
 So hang on.

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:09.440
 It's a fake rock that we see on our TV sometimes.

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:11.040
 A fake waterfall.

00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:12.000
 Fake waterfall.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.920
 But there's Australia that's on British TV sometimes.

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:15.200
 Very famous waterfall.

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:15.840
 Famous, famous.

00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:16.400
 Our source.

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:17.120
 It's fake.

00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:17.680
 It's fake.

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:19.200
 Is it known that it's fake

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:20.560
 or is this a secret you're busting open?

00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:23.040
 I'm not busting it wide open,

00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:24.400
 but I think some people know.

00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:26.240
 It's a Sydney Opera House.

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:28.320
 It's not a waterfall.

00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:29.200
 No, but I'm wondering.

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:31.200
 I thought there's a feature somewhere.

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:32.320
 I bet it's fake.

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:33.360
 We've been there.

00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:34.800
 Yeah, I didn't see a waterfall.

00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:38.080
 I'm just naming things in Australia now.

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:38.640
 Yeah, give us a tiny bit more.

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:39.360
 Crocodile.D.

00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:43.760
 There's often a attractive young TV personality

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:44.800
 underneath it.

00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:45.200
 Neighbours.

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:46.400
 No.

00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:49.200
 No, but you can't just say neighbours.

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:51.840
 Oh, I'm a celebrity.

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:52.640
 I know you are Andy,

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:53.920
 but do you know the name of the show?

00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:56.000
 Okay, so I'm a celebrity.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:56.720
 Get me out of here.

00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:58.960
 Yes, so they have that kind of place

00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:00.320
 where they all go for a shower

00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:01.760
 underneath a waterfall.

00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:03.040
 And it turned out recently,

00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:04.960
 they found out that this is a completely

00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:06.160
 fake waterfall,

00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:07.760
 and they can turn the taps on and off

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:08.800
 whenever they want to.

00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:09.840
 No, you're kidding.

00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:12.400
 And whenever anyone goes for a waterfall shower,

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:14.320
 they just turn the taps on and they get washed.

00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:15.600
 That is brilliant.

00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:16.880
 Do they that was like

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:18.960
 Mylene Klaas literally turning a hot water tap

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:19.600
 as the producers?

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:20.800
 No, it's the producers.

00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:21.600
 What a shame of that.

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:22.960
 What a shower that would be.

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:25.040
 So which poor producer has to stand there

00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:27.040
 watching the dry waterfall 24 hours a day

00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:28.400
 in case someone stands under it?

00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:31.760
 I guess it's not that bad a job, is it?

00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:33.520
 It's one for an intern, I think.

00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:36.080
 It's really sad though,

00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:38.320
 because President McKinley used to genuinely

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:39.360
 really love handshakes.

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:39.840
 He used to...

00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:42.480
 It said that it was his favorite thing to do

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:44.000
 was shake people's hands.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.880
 And this guy basically used it as a tactic,

00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:48.240
 as a way to...

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:50.000
 Yeah, because it was him that was killed

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:50.720
 this way, right?

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:51.520
 McKinley.

00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:52.160
 Yeah.

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:52.880
 And he was killed...

00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:55.280
 It was at a fun fair, wasn't it?

00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:56.160
 He was at the Buffalo...

00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:57.200
 Not a fun fair.

00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:59.440
 Well, it was like the Buffalo World Fair.

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:01.120
 So it was one of those places...

00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:02.560
 Sorry, Dan, it was a really big difference

00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:05.440
 between fun fairs and the Buffalo World Fair.

00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:07.520
 They were fun, I think, because, you know...

00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:10.240
 It was fun space fair.

00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:12.000
 Dan was just using it as a descriptor.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.240
 It was a fun fair, not for William McKinley,

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:15.440
 but for everyone else there.

00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:17.360
 It's like the fun fair down at Frinsbury Park,

00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:20.320
 as opposed to, you know, this massive world fair

00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:21.680
 where they were showing off, you know,

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:24.880
 American industry and, like, Belle or whoever else.

00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:28.320
 My poor kids.

00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:29.440
 Yeah, this is fun.

00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:30.960
 This is fun.

00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:33.360
 Dad.

00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:34.960
 Speaking of concrete, there was a woman

00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:38.560
 that called Sarah Goopy, and in 1811,

00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:41.440
 she invented a new way of making piling for bridges.

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:44.000
 So when you make a bridge, you need to kind of

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.760
 fire some stuff into the ground,

00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:49.360
 so they'll hold it solid and put some concrete in there

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:51.120
 to make the foundations.

00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:53.120
 And so she came up with a new way of doing this,

00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:55.600
 and she was a friend of Isambar Kingdom Brunel,

00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:59.440
 and so Brunel basically used all of her piling tactics

00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:00.480
 for all of his bridges,

00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:04.560
 but she didn't patent it because she said,

00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:06.880
 "It is unpleasant to speak of oneself.

00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:09.600
 It may seem boastful, particularly in a woman."

00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:12.720
 So she decided not to patent it,

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:15.520
 and this kind of technique was used in a load of bridges.

00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:16.160
 Come on, Goopy.

00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:18.640
 She did come up with a few things that she did patent,

00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:22.720
 so she came up with a method of keeping ships free of barnacles,

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:24.720
 which made her 40 grams from the government,

00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:25.760
 because it was so important.

00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:26.960
 Wow. I'm sure.

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:29.040
 I mean, that's so important, that as well.

00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:29.600
 Exactly.

00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:31.280
 That's not a lot of money for how important that is.

00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:33.600
 She must have identified there was a Goopy in the market.

00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:35.600
 A Gaffin in the market.

00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:36.160
 Yeah, no, no.

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:36.960
 Yeah, we did Gaffin.

00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:37.360
 No, no, no.

00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:37.600
 A Gaffin.

00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:38.160
 A Gaffin, yeah.

00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:39.920
 It feels like it's not the right Goopy pun

00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:41.520
 when we're talking about ships and water.

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:49.760
 Here's another quite French politician, Gaston Daffaer,

00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:53.040
 and he was a participant in the last duel

00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:54.560
 that ever took place in France.

00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:56.240
 This was in 1967.

00:31:56.240 --> 00:32:01.920
 And Daffaer had insulted René Rivière in the French parliament.

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:05.920
 He'd said, "T'es et vous abloutir,"

00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:08.000
 which means, apparently, "Shut up, stupid."

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.360
 And so they decided they were going to have a duel.

00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:15.600
 And Daffaer vowed that he wouldn't kill Rivière

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:17.680
 because it was the night before his wedding

00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:19.120
 that they'd organized this duel.

00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:21.840
 But he said, "I will only wound you

00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:24.560
 and spoil your wedding night very considerably."

00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:27.280
 Otherwise, it wouldn't be Daffaer.

00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:28.720
 Just stunning.

00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:31.920
 And James, what was the upshot of the duel?

00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:36.160
 So Daffaer won, but there were a couple of nicks

00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:37.280
 that he put on Rivière.

00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:38.160
 He wasn't like it.

00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:39.840
 He didn't chop his penis off or anything.

00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:41.600
 It was just like a few cuts.

00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:44.480
 And then the guy who was officiating the duel,

00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:47.200
 who was France's secretary of state for foreign affairs,

00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:49.760
 decided this is enough.

00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:50.320
 Enough's enough.

00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:53.120
 We're going to call it a win for Daffaer.

00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:54.960
 I've actually been up a lookout tree.

00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:59.440
 Yeah, so in Australia, sort of south of Perth,

00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:01.200
 there is three trees.

00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:02.880
 The Dave Evans Bicentennial tree.

00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:04.880
 There's the Glossestra tree and the Diamond tree.

00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:06.000
 I don't know which one I was up

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000
 because I went as a kid as like 10 or so.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.720
 So basically, the way you get up these trees

00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:12.480
 is that they slammed in these metal bars

00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:13.920
 and they would go circular around it

00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:15.360
 and you would climb to the top

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:16.720
 and then you'd have that hut there.

00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:18.480
 And it was petrifying,

00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:19.760
 but I had sort of kid confidence

00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:21.280
 to get up to the top.

00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:21.920
 And you climb.

00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:23.520
 And so you climb on these metal bars.

00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:24.880
 Is it climbing on all fours?

00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:26.240
 Yeah, you're climbing on all fours.

00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:28.000
 And there's nothing underneath you.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.280
 Like there's no, there's no meshing.

00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:31.360
 Were you employed by the Forestry Commission?

00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:32.800
 They open it up to the public.

00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:35.920
 So it's no longer a used tree for those purposes.

00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:37.840
 And so tourists can just rock up and go.

00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:39.760
 And they say, don't go up if you're afraid of heights

00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:43.440
 or if you might have a heart attack or if you're a kid.

00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:44.800
 I don't know why I was allowed up.

00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:46.400
 And I do remember we went to the top.

00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:49.920
 My sister and I, and there was a couple sitting,

00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:54.640
 shivering, petrified in the corner of the hut at the top.

00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:55.360
 And we went down.

00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:55.920
 Too scared to go back down?

00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:56.720
 Too scared to go back down.

00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:57.440
 It was petrifying.

00:33:57.440 --> 00:33:58.080
 Oh no.

00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:00.160
 Like it was, if you look down, I mean it's...

00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:01.840
 But is it, when you go back down,

00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:03.200
 presumably you have to climb back.

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:04.160
 Like you're descending a ladder.

00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:04.640
 Yeah.

00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:05.040
 Right.

00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:05.360
 Exactly.

00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:06.560
 But with much more of an angle I guess.

00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:06.720
 Yeah.

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:07.360
 And here's the thing.

00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:09.680
 There was no system whereby you would go up one way

00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:10.480
 and come down the other.

00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:11.040
 Oh sure.

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:12.880
 You would bump into people coming up on the way.

00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:13.280
 Yeah, yeah.

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:15.360
 So would you have to go all the way back up?

00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:17.040
 Like if you're only 40% of the way down

00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:18.080
 and they're 60% of the way up,

00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:19.760
 is it like you have to climb all the way back up to the top?

00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:22.640
 I remember shimming past someone who leaned into the tree.

00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:24.080
 Yeah, yeah.

00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:26.640
 It does sound horrific.

00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:28.320
 This, I mean I would absolutely love to do it.

00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:30.400
 But also, why did you call it the Glossester Tree?

00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:31.520
 Is that what they call it in Australia?

00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:33.120
 No, I'd probably just pronounce it weirdly, hey.

00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:34.720
 Well I thought maybe all Australians do

00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:36.640
 because they can't pronounce, you know,

00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:37.840
 in this place names.

00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:38.640
 Glossester, yeah.

00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:39.520
 It would have been the Glossester Tree.

00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:41.040
 I certainly have called it the Glossester Tree.

00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:45.040
 I was once skiing with my in-laws and I was at the top

00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:47.200
 and I didn't, I don't like other people seeing me skiing

00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:48.240
 because I'm so bad at it.

00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:49.360
 And I get really embarrassed

00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:51.200
 because I keep falling over and stuff.

00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:53.840
 And my father-in-law went down the first bit

00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:55.040
 and then he stopped.

00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:57.360
 I'm like, oh fuck's sake, he's waiting for me

00:34:57.360 --> 00:35:00.000
 because he's trying to be polite and he wants to wait.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.920
 So anyway, I was like, I'm not going.

00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:02.480
 I'm not going.

00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:04.080
 So I waited at the top and I waited at the top

00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:05.520
 for about 40 minutes.

00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:07.280
 And then eventually he went down

00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:09.120
 and then I kind of followed him down.

00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:10.240
 And then I spoke to him afterwards

00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:12.160
 and he said he was too scared to go back down

00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:14.320
 and then he was just trying to get up the courage to go down.

00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:14.880
 Oh my God.

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:18.320
 And I thought that he was just spying to see

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:19.360
 if I was going to fall over.

00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:20.160
 God.

00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:21.200
 So funny.

00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:22.640
 That's very...

00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:24.240
 That's such a weird situation.

00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:27.040
 Just all the women in the family,

00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:28.320
 the bottom-going, why?

00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:29.840
 What are those two doing?

00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:31.680
 That is a moment where you go to Polina.

00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:32.640
 You've married your father.

00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:35.200
 Yeah, yeah.

00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:40.640
 There was a mountainer who made kit out of balloon material.

00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:44.240
 So George Finch was an Aussie mountain climber

00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:46.960
 and he went on the Mallory expedition in 1922

00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:49.120
 and invented the Eiderdown coat,

00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:50.560
 the puffer jacket, essentially,

00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:52.240
 from hot air balloon material

00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:54.880
 when everyone else on the trip was wearing tweed.

00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:57.600
 So it's a really radical thing to a veteran.

00:35:57.600 --> 00:35:59.520
 And all the other mountaineers laughed at him.

00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:00.560
 It's really, you know...

00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:02.000
 He wasn't wearing a basket on his feet.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.440
 But imagine being laughed at by a lot of people wearing tweed.

00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:05.840
 I know.

00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:08.160
 Sounds like my school days.

00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:12.000
 And he was really looked down on by the other mountaineers.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:13.920
 So he was observed repairing his own boots

00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:17.360
 very, you know, very unclassy behavior.

00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:19.200
 And the deputy leader of the expedition

00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:21.040
 who was called Colonel Edward Strut said,

00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:22.960
 "I always knew the fellow was a shit."

00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:25.520
 Just thought he was invented a new jacket

00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:27.360
 and he's cleaned, repaired his own boots.

00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:28.880
 What a way with words this guy had.

00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:32.560
 Yeah, but he had the last laugh

00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:34.560
 because obviously no wind got through his amazing jacket

00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:36.480
 and he was feeling a lot warmer.

00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:37.280
 Yeah.

00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:40.800
 So today there's still something like 500 lookouts in America

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:43.680
 and they reckon it's a 50/50 split of men and women.

00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:43.920
 Yeah.

00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:45.920
 And they reckon it kind of was that in,

00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:47.280
 not the very earliest period,

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:50.240
 but as soon as the sort of ceiling was broke

00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:52.000
 and the first woman started doing it,

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.800
 which was this lady who was called Halle Morse Daggett

00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:57.840
 and she became the first female to serve in the Forest Service.

00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:00.320
 And it's an amazing recommendation that she got in order.

00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:00.960
 Did you read that letter?

00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:02.000
 Yeah, I think so.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:02.800
 It's incredible.

00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:04.240
 This guy who was the ranger,

00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:06.320
 he wrote a letter to his boss saying that he thought

00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:08.000
 that Daggett would be the best person for the job.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:09.920
 But obviously there were three people applying

00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:10.720
 and two of them were men.

00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:12.320
 It should have gone to one of them.

00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:12.960
 Is that me?

00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:13.440
 He should.

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:14.640
 Yeah, I agree.

00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:16.560
 I think we could all agree on that then.

00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:17.040
 No, no, no.

00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:17.760
 I'm backtracking.

00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:21.600
 So how on earth did this woman get the job?

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:22.480
 I don't understand.

00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:24.080
 Oh, I am still furious about this.

00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:27.760
 So what he wrote in the letter was,

00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:30.640
 "The novelty of the proposition which has been unloaded upon me

00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:33.040
 and which I am now endeavouring to pass up to you

00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:35.200
 may perhaps take your breath away."

00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:36.960
 Like just like even that thought alone.

00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:38.800
 Like the fair the end where he said,

00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:41.200
 "She is absolutely devoid of the timidity

00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:44.000
 which is ordinarily associated with her sex."

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:47.280
 Okay, but she's not afraid of anything

00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:48.960
 that walks, creeps or flies.

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:51.040
 She is a perfect lady in every respect.

00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:52.640
 Wow.

00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:53.600
 That's a perfect lady.

00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:57.360
 General Motors, they make artificial stalactites

00:37:57.360 --> 00:37:58.800
 out of their car byproducts.

00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:00.400
 Weird wine.

00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:01.040
 And pretty weird.

00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:01.600
 For wear.

00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:02.480
 For the bats.

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:03.120
 Yeah.

00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:03.360
 Cool.

00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:04.880
 For bats to cling onto.

00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:07.600
 So they've installed a couple of hundred of these across the USA.

00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:08.720
 They put them in caves

00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:10.560
 because it gives the bats more surface area

00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:12.960
 to spread out and hang from.

00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:15.280
 And that means when the bats have more space

00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:16.880
 they don't all cluster together

00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:18.400
 because when they cluster together

00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:20.240
 they spread this disease amongst themselves

00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:21.520
 called white nose syndrome

00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:22.720
 which is kind of fungus.

00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:24.080
 That's very bad for the bats.

00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:25.680
 And as we know, if we've learned anything,

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:27.920
 it's that you should try and keep the bats healthy.

00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:31.360
 And so General Motors have started installing these.

00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:31.680
 Right.

00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:32.960
 What do they, I thought you were going to say

00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:35.840
 there was some sort of amazing benefit for General Motors

00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:37.040
 as a company to do this.

00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:37.680
 PR.

00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:38.240
 Just PR.

00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:39.840
 The intangible benefits of PR

00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:40.560
 are huge then.

00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:42.720
 I'm talking about them now.

00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:43.440
 General Motors.

00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:46.480
 The bats tell their other bat friends

00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:48.000
 and they tell their other bat friends

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:49.120
 and before you know it.

00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:49.840
 There we go.

00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:51.600
 Is the car market big in the bat world?

00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:52.240
 Do they particularly like?

00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:53.120
 Yeah, the Batmobile.

00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:53.760
 Come on.

00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:54.320
 Good point.

00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:56.240
 It's just the one model, isn't it?

00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:56.720
 That's true.

00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:59.440
 You'll get letters.

00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:00.560
 There are loads of models there.

00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:01.040
 Oh my God.

00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:02.880
 It does look like models in the Batmobile.

00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:03.600
 Sorry.

00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:04.720
 No, thank you for saving me

00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:06.640
 because I saw you think about letting me

00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:07.600
 drop myself in there.

00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:13.920
 [Music]

00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:15.360
 There's another wives tale that you tell

00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:17.600
 if something is a fossil by licking it.

00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:21.120
 Yeah, is it supposed to have air holes

00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:23.600
 and it's stickier to your tongue or something?

00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:24.880
 I've got to tell you I've been on so many

00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:26.640
 archaeological sites and once in a while

00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:28.160
 some of the undergrads will be like,

00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:30.960
 like nobody knows what on earth it means.

00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:33.360
 They've just got stone to their tongues.

00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:35.520
 It's, I don't think it's very interesting.

00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:36.400
 But what's the idea?

00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:39.280
 As in what are you meant to get from it?

00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:40.560
 It's supposed to be different.

00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:42.400
 I think it's supposed to stick more

00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:43.680
 if it's actually a fossil.

00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:44.800
 It's supposed to be like...

00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:46.080
 It's not.

00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:46.960
 Oh, what is it now?

00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:48.880
 It's supposed to have little tiny holes in it

00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:50.480
 that when you put your tongue into it

00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:52.000
 it kind of sticks to your tongue.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.880
 And I worry very much that your undergrads

00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:56.160
 might have heard this on QI.

00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:59.600
 I think we might...

00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:01.280
 Oh my God, I think you're right.

00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:02.800
 We might have a retraction to make

00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:03.600
 if that's not true.

00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:08.240
 Yeah, yeah, we've thunked your undergrads accidentally

00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:09.040
 and I'm sorry.

00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:12.000
 The best method is actually just to see

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:12.960
 if it will break apart,

00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:14.240
 which is kind of similar with the crop.

00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:16.240
 Because if it's bone it will just snap.

00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:17.040
 But obviously you don't really want

00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:19.680
 to be snapping fossils, for obvious reasons.

00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:20.000
 Yeah.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:21.840
 But I've definitely been on archaeological...

00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:23.600
 I've got two fossils then if you do that.

00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:24.400
 Definitely.

00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:24.800
 Charged up.

00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:27.440
 You're not coming with me on a tube, James.

00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:31.200
 What we found, 16 finds.

00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:33.200
 I swear we started with eight.

00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:36.320
 But no, yeah, I was on an expedition

00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:38.960
 and we had this massive argument

00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:41.920
 about if something was a fossil or a stone.

00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:44.560
 And I might have accidentally dropped it

00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:45.840
 and it made such a loud noise.

00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:47.280
 We were like, "That's a stone."

00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:51.280
 But then another time a professor was

00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:52.240
 massively arguing with me.

00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:53.680
 And I was like, "I swear it's a fossil."

00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:55.680
 As you can tell, I think everything is a fossil.

00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:57.120
 Even when it's stone.

00:40:57.120 --> 00:40:57.920
 And he was like, "No, it's not.

00:40:57.920 --> 00:40:59.120
 It's a stone. It's a stone."

00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:01.680
 And then he went, "Look, you can't break it."

00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:04.000
 And then he broke it and he was like, "Oh, let's just pretend that I don't."

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:08.160
 So much history destroyed.

00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:12.000
 By the professor, that was the best fit.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:12.640
 But yeah.

00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:15.760
 Other marine worms do that kind of dissolving thing, don't they?

00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:17.440
 There's a worm called the zombie worm,

00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:20.800
 which feeds off skeletons of mostly whales

00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:23.360
 but other dead ocean animals at the bottom of the sea.

00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:26.240
 And that sends acid out onto the bone,

00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:27.760
 which kind of melts it.

00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:29.920
 Well, it dissolves it.

00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:32.640
 And then they just live inside whale bones forever and ever.

00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:33.360
 And they're really cool.

00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:34.720
 The thing I like about them is that the males

00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:36.960
 just live inside the females forever.

00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:38.080
 So there'll be one female

00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:40.240
 and then they'll have about 100 males living inside them.

00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:41.280
 No, really?

00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:42.320
 And they just live there.

00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:45.920
 And they feed off her yolk of her eggs.

00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:47.200
 And then eventually they inseminate her.

00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:50.000
 Because they were looking for the males, right?

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.560
 Because they knew they found the sperm inside the females.

00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:54.000
 So they were like, "Well, where are the males?"

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.680
 And it turned out the sperm was the males.

00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:59.520
 It's like they're the little guys who live inside the female.

00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:00.480
 That's incredible.

00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:02.240
 Do the males ever leave the female

00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:04.320
 and find they're a new female?

00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:05.280
 Do they ever break up?

00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:05.760
 I don't think.

00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:06.800
 I think you haven't got a choice.

00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:09.120
 It's very much an arranged marriage to the situation.

00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:12.000
 But what about when the female gives birth

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.000
 or when she lays eggs that then hatch?

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:16.080
 Yeah, they must have to swim around

00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:17.200
 to find another female, unfortunately.

00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:18.000
 How do they...

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:18.400
 Yeah.

00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:19.440
 Do they get...

00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:21.280
 When they hatch, when a female hatches,

00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:24.080
 as in when a female, one of these fish hatches,

00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:25.040
 how do they get new males?

00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:25.760
 I guess, yeah, you're right.

00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:26.800
 They just swim around and they...

00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:27.440
 Find them.

00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:28.720
 Oh, yeah, I don't actually know.

00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:31.520
 They probably just look for some tasty bones

00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:33.200
 where everyone else is hanging around.

00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:35.360
 That's where the term boning comes from.

00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:37.440
 What am I talking about?

00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:40.000
 The interesting thing is that they do...

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.640
 They live on whale bones.

00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:45.840
 But also, they've been found living on the food,

00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:48.240
 the bones of the food that people throw on the boat.

00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:48.560
 Really?

00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:49.040
 Yeah.

00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:51.200
 And that is where the phrase "throw me a bone" comes from.

00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:57.120
 There was lots of reasons that people climb Mont Blanc.

00:42:57.120 --> 00:42:58.960
 This was from a book called "Killing Dragons,

00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:01.040
 the Conquest of the Alps" by Fergus Fleming.

00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:04.960
 In 1818, there was a Russian count called Matsefsky,

00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:08.480
 who did it because he wanted to improve his poetry skills.

00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:11.920
 Yeah, do you think?

00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:12.160
 No.

00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:12.800
 I don't know.

00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:14.000
 What's he practicing there?

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:14.800
 Is it the writing of?

00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:15.360
 Is it the speaking of poetry?

00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:17.440
 I think he's thinking seeing all that beauty

00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:18.640
 will help life poetry.

00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:19.840
 Yeah, I kind of get that though.

00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:21.680
 Being inspired by amazing stuff,

00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:24.000
 because there is a Shelley poem called Mont Blanc,

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:27.040
 which is one of the worst Shelley poems.

00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:28.480
 There's a, what is it?

00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:29.680
 What is he writing with Blanc?

00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:32.000
 Blanc Mont.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:35.760
 There was someone I knew who had a tutor,

00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:37.600
 who, you know, an English literature tutor,

00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:41.680
 who said poetry is better than sex,

00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:43.760
 apart from Shelley's Mont Blanc.

00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:45.040
 Sex is better than Mont Blanc.

00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:50.640
 There was a guy called John Oljo,

00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:52.160
 and he climbed because he wanted to see

00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:54.320
 a better reflection of the mountain in the lake.

00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:57.600
 So he thought he couldn't see it properly from the ground,

00:43:57.600 --> 00:43:59.760
 so he had to go to the top so they could see it.

00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:01.120
 So you know the lake was there,

00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:01.920
 if it was halfway up the mountain.

00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:02.800
 It's strange, isn't it?

00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:05.840
 And also, can you really see the mountain reflection

00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:07.040
 from a lake that's below you?

00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:07.600
 Maybe you can.

00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:08.000
 I don't know.

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.400
 There was a guy called Comte Henri de Tully,

00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:13.120
 who climbed because he wanted to cheer himself up

00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:14.160
 after a failed affair.

00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:17.920
 And there was a guy called Edward Boutal Wildbraham,

00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:20.720
 who climbed Mont Blanc because he had been told not to.

00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:22.000
 Cool.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:22.560
 Wow.

00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:24.320
 That's literally all I know about it.

00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:26.000
 Was he an eight-year-old in a strop?

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:26.640
 What have you done?

00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:28.400
 Isn't that amazing?

00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:30.320
 It's like proper reverse psychology.

00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:32.240
 Don't climb that mountain.

00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:33.600
 It's mad.

00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:34.720
 It's bigger.

00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:36.480
 Do you think the tallest curtains ever made

00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:40.000
 are taller than the widest curtains ever made are wide?

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:40.480
 Okay.

00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:40.960
 Or do you...?

00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:41.440
 No.

00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:44.480
 No, I would think width is easier to make than height.

00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:46.240
 John?

00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:46.960
 I'm going to go height.

00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:50.560
 Okay, well, the obvious answer is,

00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:51.760
 I'm afraid the correct one here.

00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:56.640
 I wish I could have some kind of exclusive minority report for you,

00:44:56.640 --> 00:45:00.880
 but no, the tallest curtains are only half as high

00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:02.720
 as the widest curtains are wide.

00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:06.160
 That's actually still a surprisingly large proportion

00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:07.040
 of the widest curtains.

00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:07.760
 That's quite tall.

00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:10.000
 Also, they're 65 metres tall.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:11.120
 I mean, that's incredible.

00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:13.760
 Also, all you need to do is just flip it the other way up,

00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:15.120
 and then you've got the tallest curtain.

00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:16.960
 Yeah, that's a really good point.

00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:21.360
 Just turn your landscape curtains into portrait curtains,

00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:22.800
 and they're much taller.

00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:24.880
 There has been a new kind of paper invented

00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:27.840
 made from biomaterials.

00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:31.200
 So you take parts of people's body,

00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:32.480
 and you kind of squish it down

00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:34.480
 and do a load of chemical stuff to it,

00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:36.720
 and you can get this new kind of paper.

00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:39.040
 And the idea is that they can use it

00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:41.040
 by kind of folding it into certain ways,

00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:43.280
 and it will help to heal wounds,

00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:45.760
 or it will help the body to regenerate organ tissue,

00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:46.320
 stuff like that.

00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:49.280
 So it's a way of using origami inside the human body.

00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:52.400
 And it's really interesting the way they discovered this.

00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:54.000
 There was a guy called Adam Jacobs,

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.240
 and it's one of those discoveries

00:45:56.240 --> 00:45:58.320
 where it was an accidental discovery,

00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:04.160
 because he'd actually created an ink made from an ovary

00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:06.480
 that he was going to use for a 3D printer,

00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:10.080
 and he spilled the ink, and it kind of hardened

00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:11.200
 and turned into this paper,

00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:12.480
 and he realised that he could use that.

00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:14.320
 And I know there are more questions to be asked

00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:15.760
 at the start of that sentence.

00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:16.240
 Sure.

00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:20.080
 You saw questions appear on our faces

00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:21.600
 one after the other.

00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:22.880
 What ovary?

00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:25.440
 Well, that's the way that they make these biomaterials

00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:28.720
 is they take body parts from people.

00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:29.920
 Is it a human ovary?

00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:30.720
 Human ovary.

00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:32.480
 Actually, I think it was a pig ovary this one,

00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:33.680
 but the hope is in the future

00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:35.760
 they'll be able to use human body parts as well,

00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:37.840
 or maybe stem cells to create them.

00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:40.240
 So is the idea that you would sacrifice, let's say, a finger,

00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:42.960
 but you would get a cool new power?

00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:44.400
 No, no, no.

00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:46.560
 It's almost like you haven't understood anything I've said.

00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:53.920
 It's more like you would get stem cells to create some kind of biomaterials,

00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:56.400
 and then that would turn into a paper kind of material,

00:46:56.400 --> 00:47:00.560
 and you'd be able to fold it and help to cover wounds or...

00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:03.760
 Or swallow it, and it springs into a fake heart inside you or something.

00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:05.440
 That is closer to what might happen

00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:06.240
 than what Andy said.

00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:09.760
 James said you can make it from a body part,

00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:12.560
 so if in extremis you cut off your own finger...

00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:14.000
 Yeah, but you'd only be using the finger

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.560
 to make some paper bandage to put over that...

00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:17.760
 Yeah, you're a missing finger.

00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:20.640
 Oh, I see. I see it's a problem that's solving its own creation.

00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:21.920
 It's a false economy, really.

00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:22.880
 Yeah, you're right.

00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:24.640
 Pretty cool, though.

00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:25.280
 Amazing.

00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:30.560
 Until the 70s and 80s, a lot of geographers assumed that elephants couldn't swim,

00:47:30.560 --> 00:47:33.600
 and so when you found elephant bones on an island,

00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:35.040
 there must have been a land bridge,

00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:37.280
 because otherwise there's no way they could have got across.

00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:40.320
 There's a debate about how elephants got to Sri Lanka, isn't there?

00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:43.840
 And lots of other places used to have elephants like Malta and Crete and Cyprus.

00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:46.320
 None of which I think have elephants now.

00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:50.080
 I've been to Malta and it's quite a small island.

00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:53.280
 You would struggle to hide a wild elephant population on it.

00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:56.480
 They also have British homestars there, don't they?

00:47:56.480 --> 00:47:59.600
 Which is an extinct shop in the UK,

00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:01.760
 but it still goes on in Malta.

00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:04.560
 Do you reckon there was a land bridge once from the UK to Malta

00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:06.160
 where British homestars...

00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:14.000
 Frantically taking their reasonably-priced outer rain garments with them.

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:16.400
 God, you're right.

00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:17.920
 Malta is one of those funny places, though,

00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:19.440
 because they've got a BHS.

00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:21.040
 They've still got a mother care.

00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:23.520
 I don't think there's a mother care on the British mainland anymore.

00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:27.840
 And it's just like that thing where a species goes extinct on the mainland,

00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:28.800
 but it survives on the island.

00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:31.040
 Yeah, but the thing is, because it's an island,

00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:33.520
 they get either very, very big or very, very small.

00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:35.520
 So the mother care is really tiny,

00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:38.000
 whereas the British homestars is massive.

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:39.040
 That's so funny.

00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:41.200
 Do you know, when I got there, when I got to Malta,

00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:44.400
 I shared a cab from the airport to the main town,

00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:46.320
 because some guy just approached me and said,

00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:47.280
 "Do you want to share a cab?"

00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:49.520
 And then he turned out, he said he didn't have any money.

00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:52.400
 It was all a bit dodgy, but he...

00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:53.680
 You've been duped, my friend.

00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:56.880
 He was a really peculiar guy,

00:48:56.880 --> 00:49:01.200
 because he said he was there for some kind of corporate espionage purposes.

00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:02.560
 Right?

00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:04.080
 And he said that's what he does,

00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:06.160
 and he goes around to make sure that, for example,

00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:08.240
 the Maltese mother care aren't selling.

00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:10.320
 He's probably from Chinese homestars.

00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:14.640
 It was so unclear what he was doing,

00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:16.640
 and then he found out I had some kind of job in the media,

00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:18.880
 and he didn't say a word for the rest of the journey,

00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:20.080
 except to clarify, perhaps,

00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:22.640
 that he didn't have any money to pay for the cab at the end of it.

00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:25.040
 Sounds like he really didn't want you to mention him publicly,

00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:28.560
 so it's a good thing that this will be going out to a few hundred thousand people.

00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:31.680
 I have one last thing, which is,

00:49:31.680 --> 00:49:36.240
 I think I have found the only copperlight street in the world.

00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:40.320
 Okay, what do you mean, like it's paved with poo?

00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:43.120
 No, it's called Copperlight Street.

00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:46.320
 As far as I can tell, I've gone on Google Maps,

00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:47.760
 and I've put copperlight in,

00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:51.760
 and there's only one place in the world that has it on its sign.

00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:53.040
 Is it in Light Regis?

00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:53.920
 Oh, no.

00:49:53.920 --> 00:50:00.160
 It's an Ipswich, which is in Suffolk for anyone overseas listening.

00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:03.200
 And yeah, it's Copperlight Street.

00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:07.040
 It was named that because there was a guy called Edward Packer,

00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:11.840
 who started basically a fossil feces factory,

00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:13.600
 burning it up and using the energy.

00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:20.880
 He was known as the Golden Muck Man of Ipswich, or the Copperlight King.

00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:22.160
 Yeah, the Copperlight King.

00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:24.000
 Man, what a great name.

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:26.000
 Where are they finding enough fossils to...

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:29.520
 Yeah, I guess back in the day in the 1800s, they're everywhere, right?

00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:30.880
 Somewhere near Ipswich, I guess.

00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:33.120
 Norwich, no.

00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:37.280
 I can't believe the way you researched, Dan,

00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:39.040
 is you just type in all the keywords

00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:40.880
 that were researching that week into Google Maps

00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:43.120
 to see if there were places named after them.

00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:44.880
 Adam, do you think this is genius,

00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:47.760
 or are you just disappointed with your teammate?

00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:49.040
 I wish I thought of it first.

00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:52.400
 Seven years, it's finally paid off.

00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:54.000
 Copperlight Street, you wouldn't have thought.

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:56.160
 The only one in the world.

00:50:57.520 --> 00:51:00.160
 Looking at that list, that massive list of Copperlight Facts,

00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:02.480
 I just imagined Dan being like, "Yeah, we're running out of facts."

00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:04.800
 So I'm just going to not Google it,

00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:06.480
 I'm going to literally Google Earth it.

00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:08.640
 Do you want to think outside of the box here?

00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:14.800
 Okay, that's it.

00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:16.240
 That's all of our facts.

00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:18.800
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:20.880
 If you would like to speak to me,

00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:22.400
 you can go to Twitter,

00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:24.720
 and you can look for @JamesHarken,

 and I will be there.

00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:28.160
 If you would like to speak to Andrew Hunter Murray,

00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:32.480
 you can go to @AndrewHunterM on that very same website,

 and Dan is there as well at Shriverland.

00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:37.280
 If you would like to speak to Anna,

00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:39.840
 you can email her or indeed any of us

00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:42.880
 on the address podcast@qi.com,

00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:45.120
 and if you'd like to learn more about the podcast,

00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:48.240
 you can go to knowsuchthingasafish.com,

00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:52.240
 and that is also the place where you can get tickets to the shows,

00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:54.640
 which I mentioned at the top of this show.

00:51:54.640 --> 00:51:59.120
 The easier place to go for those as well is qi.com/fishevents.

00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:00.800
 We will be back again next week

00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:03.520
 with another episode of No Such Things as a Fish,

00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:04.960
 another normal episode.

00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:05.920
 But in the meantime,

00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:08.080
 hope you enjoy your bank holiday weekend

00:52:08.080 --> 00:52:09.040
 if you're in the UK,

00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:10.400
 and wherever you are in the world,

00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:12.080
 hope you're having a great time.

00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:13.520
 We will see you again next week.

00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:15.040
 Good bye!

00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:18.020
 (upbeat music)

00:52:18.020 --> 00:52:20.600
 (upbeat music)

00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:23.180
 (upbeat music)

00:52:23.180 --> 00:52:25.760
