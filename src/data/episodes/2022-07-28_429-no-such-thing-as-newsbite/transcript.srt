00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,520
 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of no such thing as a fish. It is the super long bank holiday

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,400
 for the Queens Jubilee and so

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:16,160
 We have decided that we are going to take a weekend off and instead of this week

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:22,080
 You're gonna get another one of my compilations from all the best bits from the last year or so of fish

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:27,400
 Which didn't make it into the final show because they were too silly because they've got the facts wrong

6
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,400
 Or just basically because there wasn't enough space

7
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,580
 Since it's the Queens Jubilee

8
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:38,440
 I can guarantee that for once this compilation doesn't contain anything libelous to the British royal family

9
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,800
 But I can't guarantee it won't for the next one so you better make the most of this

10
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,020
 Your Royal Highness if you're listening anyway

11
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:52,120
 Just one more quick thing before we start this week's show and that is that we have a couple of live dates coming up

12
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,240
 They will be in Inverness, Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Glasgow and Cardiff

13
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:03,120
 They are post-poned gigs from earlier in the year that will be happening towards the end of August and the start of September

14
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,160
 We would love to see you there if you live in any of those places

15
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:11,120
 Then get your tickets fast if you don't live in any of those places

16
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,120
 But you can get to those places then get the tickets as well

17
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:17,720
 Because it's gonna be a whole lot of fun in loads of facts loads of silliness

18
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:22,960
 And the best way to get your tickets is to go to qi.com/fishevents

19
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,520
 Anyway, hope you enjoyed this week's show and what else is there to say but on with the podcast

20
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:37,080
 Mike Tess from Dennis. Hello. Hello Mike Tess from Harkin. Hello. Hello. Hello. Mike Tess from Andy. Hello. Hello. Hello

21
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,440
 What an awesome chat we're having. Hello. Hello. Hello

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:52,800
 Yeah, he's been trying to think of puns based on TV shows and dugs. Heal or No Heal. The Barkfest show. Oh yeah, Heal or No Heal. Oh Barkfest. Barkfest is a good, yeah. Yeah

23
00:01:52,800 --> 00:02:03,600
 I'm trying to do something with one of the big news night show. Why don't you just... News bite. Right, come on. News bite. Very nice. There we go. Off we go. Off we go. Off we go.

24
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,280
 He's been sat there for the last 20 minutes trying to think of that.

25
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,960
 All right, we good? Are we recording? We're recording.

26
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:36,000
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from the qi offices in Covent Garden.

27
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:42,240
 My name is Dan Schreiber. I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin and Anna Tyshinski.

28
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:47,120
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

29
00:02:47,120 --> 00:03:00,400
 And in a particular order, here we go. Starting with fact number one, that is Barkin.

30
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,480
 That won't make any sense.

31
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:15,200
 One thing I found on Alan Withie's page is a thing that he thinks might be the first ever beard and mustache show.

32
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:23,840
 And this was in 1873. What? Yeah, members of the public came to watch bearded men stand on a stage and have their beards judged.

33
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:29,840
 Yeah, so this was set up by a guy called William Holland and it happened in London.

34
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:35,520
 It had quite a bit of momentum behind it. Journalists who couldn't make it to the day because they were busy

35
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:42,320
 were writing in trying to influence the judges saying a beard has to be like this and giving opinion pieces about who a winner should be.

36
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:48,000
 So they thought it was going to be massive and it really, really wasn't. It was barely attended.

37
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:56,880
 They thought they were going to have 30 entrants to it, including Mr. Charles Chaplin, who sent in fragments of his beard because he couldn't physically be there.

38
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,480
 Um, it's definitely not. What? Chris, did Charlie Chaplin have a beard? I thought he had a mustache.

39
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:09,760
 Exactly. He says in brackets in his article, but unlikely to be that Charles Chaplin and I agree because this happened 16 years before Chaplin was born.

40
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,240
 Okay, so he couldn't even enter the beautiful baby competition.

41
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:20,240
 Should we go on to some more steady ground and start talking about poos?

42
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:27,680
 It feels like that's more kind of our direction usually. All right, brings on to solid ground.

43
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:36,000
 Can I just say, can I say that sometime today I got a text from Dan being like, just heads up.

44
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,920
 These are all the facts on copper lights we've already covered.

45
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:49,200
 Why is this bloody podcast? Well, it's literally they've got a massive excel list of all the copper light facts.

46
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:55,840
 It wasn't on any of the other facts, not on, you know, immediate air heart, not on just copper light.

47
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:04,880
 It's quite impressive. It was so right. That was pretty outrageous that we've never mentioned immediate air heart before, but we have mentioned copper lights 50 different times.

48
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:13,120
 I think they come out of the tunnels to mate, don't they, moles? I think that's one weird thing about them.

49
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,960
 So they're because you can't really have sex inside a tiny little tunnel. So you have to come outside.

50
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:24,880
 So you could say they're mounting out of the molehill, couldn't you? Yes. Yes.

51
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:31,120
 Why would why have they not built a big sex dungeon in the mole burrows? I think I've got the birth room.

52
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:37,920
 I think you missed my pun just there. They're mounting out of the molehill. Did you?

53
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:42,320
 That's why they haven't built it. Yes, so that we can make puns about them coming to service.

54
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:49,040
 They're very big on comedy fans. Torval and Dean were figure skaters. Famous.

55
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:56,400
 Who are they? And I know their name. I know they skate, but in what context do they skate? Were they professionals or are they an entertainment thing?

56
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:02,640
 Oh, yeah. They won the gold medal at the Sarajevo Olympics, whatever that was. Jane Torval and Christopher. Christopher Dees.

57
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,560
 And for Britain? Or for Britain?

58
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:10,480
 Yeah, that's basically why they're a really, really big deal here. Probably international listeners are thinking, who the hell are Torval and Dean?

59
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:17,120
 But guys, they're a huge deal here, because yeah, everyone loved them. They won the Winter Olympics in the 80s.

60
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,640
 And I always thought they were a husband and wife, and

61
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:25,360
 No. Oh, cousin, father and daughter.

62
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:31,200
 Brothers. You've got it.

63
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,520
 Detective and villain.

64
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,120
 It's none of the above. It's nothing. It's owner and pet. No, it's nothing.

65
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,480
 It's they were just friends and they've snogged once at the back of a bus when they were 14 before they were even partners.

66
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:53,600
 And then that was the end and they were just really great friends, but they had to spend so much of their lives together.

67
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:58,800
 So they both say their spouses took it took a lot to persuade them that this was okay.

68
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:04,640
 And they I think just it was only shortly before they won gold that they gave up their jobs.

69
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:08,400
 I think he was a policeman and she was a worked in insurance. So he was a detective.

70
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:19,360
 He said when they got it, they I think when they won, when they won, I think it was one of the most watched TV programs ever in Britain.

71
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:28,640
 It was massive and Dean said afterwards or said in an interview since that the moment that he won it and they won it and breaking all of these records.

72
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:34,880
 So they got perfect scores throughout that which no one had ever got before and he said nothing had ever affected him so much in his life.

73
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,920
 And then he specifically said, sure, having children is a life changing event, but this was the crowning moment.

74
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,520
 And I wonder why his partner thinks that.

75
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:49,840
 Do you know who the first Europeans, I should say, to climb Kilimanjaro were?

76
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:57,200
 So they were called Mayor and the Purcheller and they climbed it in 1889.

77
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:03,760
 But to celebrate the 100 year celebration, they decided who this is, the organizing committee.

78
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,600
 It just says in my notes, I don't know who that is.

79
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:12,400
 But they decided to award posthumous certificates to the African porters who helped them to get to the top.

80
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,560
 So obviously they didn't go by themselves.

81
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,200
 So they went to this village called Murangu, which is near the bottom of the mountain.

82
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,800
 And they asked the locals, you know, do you know who did this?

83
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,080
 And they went, oh, this guy did it.

84
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:33,360
 And there's a guy called Yohani Kinyala Laou who apparently had taken these guys to the top 100 years earlier.

85
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,880
 When he was 18 years old.

86
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:40,720
 So he was given the certificate despite the fact that if he was that person,

87
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,560
 he would be the oldest man who ever lived.

88
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:49,360
 He continued to live for another seven years, which means that if this was the guy,

89
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:56,960
 he died at the age of 125, which would make him the oldest person male or female to have ever lived by three years.

90
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,440
 Wow.

91
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:57,920
 I believe it.

92
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,680
 It's possible.

93
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,880
 I mean, gosh, that clean mountain air really is good for you, isn't it?

94
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:12,160
 The other option is he was nine years old when he went up and was just under the oldest person ever.

95
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,960
 But no, it's probably a misrememberance.

96
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,640
 It sounds like a lie.

97
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:22,080
 There was a baby born at an Irish petrol station this year.

98
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,560
 It was in Kildare and it was awarded free petrol for a year.

99
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,600
 The baby was?

100
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,280
 Well, I just parents, I guess.

101
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:33,440
 Wow, that's great.

102
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,800
 So it wasn't like, you know, sometimes people get christening presents of a case of champagne

103
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,880
 and, you know, they can't enjoy it for 18 years.

104
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,680
 It's not one of those.

105
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,320
 It's been kept in the cellar for when the baby turned 17.

106
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,840
 They have to do maximum driving.

107
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:52,640
 These parents have to be driving as much as they possibly can in the area of the service station.

108
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,880
 Right, I'm going to tell you a sort of similar fact,

109
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,800
 which none of you are going to care about or have any interest in whatsoever.

110
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,080
 But I guarantee you there's a slither of audience that might care.

111
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:07,280
 There was a massive show that came out on Netflix last year called Selling Sunset.

112
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:10,320
 Huge show on Netflix and has a big following.

113
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,880
 And it's all about real estate agents in America.

114
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,640
 And they're all sort of very beautiful Hollywood characters in it.

115
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,120
 Right.

116
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,920
 They all have really odd names, like one called a manza.

117
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,040
 I just haven't heard a manza before, not Amanda, a manza.

118
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,680
 And then there's a lady called Christelle.

119
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,680
 Right, again, very weird name.

120
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,920
 Turns out the reason Christelle is called that

121
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,040
 is because her mum went into labor at a shell petrol station.

122
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,480
 And she was delivered there by a member of staff called Chris.

123
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,840
 So she became Christelle.

124
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,960
 Now, it means nothing to you three here, but I'm telling you,

125
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,600
 it's just blown the minds of about six people.

126
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,920
 Had a really embarrassing thing when I was staying in Sussex last year,

127
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:55,520
 where there was a post box, which I thought was a post box that it looked like a red post box.

128
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,440
 So I thought it was somewhere where you post letters.

129
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,000
 And it was like outside the house.

130
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 So I thought, oh my God, this is so cool.

131
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,760
 The Royal Mail have installed a post box,

132
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,480
 but like in the property of this tiny little cottage.

133
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,200
 And so I posted a few letters into it.

134
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,760
 And then the owner of the property I was renting off came

135
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,240
 and delivered them back to me about three days later.

136
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,920
 I was like, so you seem to have got these letters in my post box?

137
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,680
 Which is where the letter is the letter box for the house.

138
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,120
 It's the letter box for the house.

139
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:23,600
 Yeah.

140
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,080
 Because what I thought you were going to say is every couple of years

141
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:30,080
 you see it in the tab lights of some old man who like for 25 years

142
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,480
 has been posting his letters in a dog poo bed.

143
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,840
 Like literally, it's such a common story.

144
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:39,760
 They did smell pretty bad as he goes back.

145
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,640
 Come to think of it.

146
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:46,560
 So one of the people who was trapped in Wuhan in China

147
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,560
 when it got shut down because of coronavirus

148
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:54,800
 was a Mr. Bean impersonator who happened to be there.

149
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,640
 He was at a lab, wasn't he?

150
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,240
 And he left a fridge open.

151
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:04,240
 He's a British comic called Nigel Dixon.

152
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,440
 And his job for a living is that he impersonates Mr. Bean.

153
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,680
 So he's extraordinarily popular in China right now

154
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,080
 since the pandemic happened on Weibo.

155
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:17,360
 He's got hundreds of millions of views for each of the videos

156
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,080
 that he puts up.

157
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:21,440
 He basically did all these videos about how to treat lockdown,

158
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,960
 you know, how to stay healthy and lockdown.

159
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:26,560
 So all done with the Mr. Bean suit on, you know, the tie.

160
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,920
 It was him being Mr. Bean on this thing.

161
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,800
 But one of the things that he then did sort of as himself

162
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,200
 without Mr. Bean is he released a video

163
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,560
 which reportedly was him delivering propaganda

164
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,560
 about the fact that China was doing fantastic in the pandemic.

165
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,560
 And this was in early 2020.

166
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,320
 So he said things like once people were waiting for hospital beds,

167
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,080
 now beds are waiting for people.

168
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,800
 And it sickens me to hear of other countries blaming China.

169
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:53,920
 But for what?

170
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,080
 We're now hearing of cases where people around the world

171
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:59,360
 have contracted their virus with no obvious connections to China.

172
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,880
 And this was a part of a state's propaganda channel,

173
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,200
 an official channel with China.

174
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,960
 So basically because Mr. Bean as a TV show,

175
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,800
 and I say this is someone who grew up in Hong Kong,

176
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,640
 Han Daoxian Shen, he is ginormous in China.

177
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:17,120
 This guy, they suddenly had their own Mr. Bean

178
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,040
 who could be used as propaganda.

179
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,520
 But wait a minute, Mr. Bean doesn't talk, does he?

180
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,200
 I thought that was the whole part of Mr. Bean.

181
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:35,840
 Wow, that is very depressing.

182
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,840
 Yeah, well he's massive there and it was lucky for them

183
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:41,680
 because he was trapped literally at the heartbeat of coronavirus

184
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,760
 in Wuhan and he defended them.

185
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,680
 And we don't know if that was just him defending them on his own

186
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,560
 or whether or not it was because he was making it specifically

187
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,400
 for Xi'anhua, a news agency

188
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,560
 which is an official Chinese state run media agency.

189
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,480
 Who knows? We don't know.

190
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,720
 Oh, that sounds legally covered dead.

191
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,280
 Thank you for trying yourself on an embarrassing hand grenade.

192
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:09,280
 Here's a thing, here's a puzzle for you all.

193
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:14,080
 It's a word you have to guess, five letters.

194
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,560
 It's G-R-A blank blank.

195
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,160
 G-R.

196
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,040
 Is this your, James, are you trying to do an audio version of work?

197
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,960
 Once a week, this is going to be the next big thing.

198
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,960
 Okay, this is going to be great.

199
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,680
 At the tube.

200
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,440
 Okay, okay, I'll say grass.

201
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,720
 Straight in there.

202
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,360
 Anyone?

203
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,880
 Do you want us to say grave?

204
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,600
 I wanted you to say whatever you wanted to say,

205
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,360
 but now you've said grave, Anna.

206
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:43,120
 That signifies a high mortality salience in you.

207
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,520
 Not in Dan and Andy.

208
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:49,040
 And apparently this is a test that psychologists use

209
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,080
 to see how much you're thinking about your own mortality.

210
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:55,280
 And what you can find is that people who think more

211
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:58,720
 about their own mortality tend to be more conservative.

212
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:03,920
 So the idea is that the more you think about death,

213
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,360
 the more you kind of try and conserve your own worldview

214
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,520
 and the more kind of entrenched you are in the current system.

215
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,640
 Not saying that this is you, Anna,

216
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,320
 but this is the idea of the researchers.

217
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,920
 And they said that people who did this test

218
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,480
 and went for grave as opposed to grass or grape,

219
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,840
 if they were asked to set bail,

220
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,840
 like pretend to be a judge and set bail

221
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,440
 for a supposed prostitute,

222
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,200
 then they would give an average bail of $455

223
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,360
 compared to $50 who would have said,

224
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,360
 the people who would have said grass or grape.

225
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,920
 So you're a much more conservative person

226
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,360
 according to these researchers.

227
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,600
 To be fair, James, when I said the word grass just there,

228
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,200
 what I actually was thinking of was a patch of grass

229
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:49,280
 on the plot of land where my mortal remains will be buried.

230
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,640
 So I don't know if that...

231
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,800
 And Dan was thinking that in the way

232
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,480
 that people crush grapes with their feet to make wine,

233
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,640
 so death is crushing above us

234
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,360
 and pushing us down and down deeper into the earth

235
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,120
 before we meet our maker.

236
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,480
 Now I was thinking about like, I love green grapes.

237
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,440
 On actually silly mountaineering clothes,

238
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,760
 do you remember in 2016 on International Women's Day

239
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,240
 what a group of Chinese mountaineers did?

240
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:16,480
 No.

241
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,600
 A group of Chinese male mountaineers

242
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,000
 to celebrate climbed up a mountain

243
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,400
 wearing dresses and heels in order to experience

244
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,800
 the struggles and strife of being a woman.

245
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,200
 But yeah, they wore like hot pants and many skirts.

246
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:31,840
 Hot pants.

247
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,560
 Yeah, so I don't think it was quite the same outfits

248
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,880
 as people in the 1700s.

249
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,680
 Suspenders.

250
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,360
 This is all the women that I've seen on the internet wear.

251
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,960
 Exactly, exactly.

252
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,520
 They were all wearing very high stilettos and stuff.

253
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:48,000
 All going, God, it really is hard

254
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,440
 being a woman climbing a mountain, isn't it?

255
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,960
 Wow, this branch of string fell is at the top.

256
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,920
 It better be worth it.

257
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,000
 What a...

258
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,080
 As James, you were saying, extraordinary character,

259
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:56,960
 Peter O'Toole.

260
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,520
 His stories are very wild.

261
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,560
 He was a very, particularly in his younger years,

262
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:08,800
 a tour de force of partying and booze and letharioism.

263
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,440
 He was just a big old character.

264
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,200
 He accidentally, in a boating accident,

265
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,600
 cut the top of his finger off.

266
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:20,160
 And so he put the tip of his finger into some brandy

267
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,160
 and then he pushed it back into place

268
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,080
 and wrapped it with a bandage.

269
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,920
 And then weeks later, he removed it

270
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,160
 and found that he'd put it back on the wrong way round.

271
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,640
 And that's where the story ends.

272
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,800
 And I don't know, I've looked at photos.

273
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,840
 I don't see a backward finger on Peter O'Toole.

274
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:39,440
 Was it nail in or upside down?

275
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,520
 See, the story just doesn't give us any more.

276
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,400
 Yeah, it's hard to...

277
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,760
 No, I think it must be backwards.

278
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:48,000
 So let's imagine the nail would be facing front.

279
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,120
 It doesn't say how much of the finger it was either.

280
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,280
 It could have been just the very, very, very tip.

281
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,520
 Like, I've cut the very tip of my finger, right?

282
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,160
 Exactly.

283
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,720
 It might not be the whole nail.

284
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,120
 Exactly.

285
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,960
 But you would assume if it was very, very tip,

286
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,840
 you wouldn't tell it was the wrong way round.

287
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,240
 Exactly.

288
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,240
 You kind of need a distinguishing feature, don't you?

289
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:04,880
 Like a nail.

290
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,680
 That's true.

291
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,160
 Yeah.

292
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,960
 If you heard him drumming his fingers on the table,

293
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,080
 would you get three taps and then a squelch

294
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,840
 as the soft bit at the front?

295
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,800
 Loved, loved.

296
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,080
 I don't know if he loved a fight,

297
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:22,160
 but he certainly was in them enough to have some opinion

298
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,840
 that was probably, you know, in favour of.

299
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,120
 Otherwise, you might avoid it,

300
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,240
 but it just seems like he was just constantly...

301
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,000
 That's going to count me out again, Dan.

302
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,360
 He's going to sue, Dan.

303
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,120
 I mean, he's been dead since 2000 or something.

304
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:33,680
 He's...

305
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,240
 We're fine.

306
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,840
 Who was a hell of a sentence?

307
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:36,880
 I loved it.

308
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,000
 I didn't give up as well.

309
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,200
 I kept going.

310
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,000
 Passion.

311
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,400
 But I...

312
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,160
 I think his kids are going to get in touch going.

313
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,360
 He did not love a fight.

314
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,440
 He quite liked a fight, actually.

315
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,440
 But I read it.

316
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,560
 So I found he was very good friends with Brian Blessed,

317
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,160
 another great actor.

318
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,200
 Was he?

319
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:53,920
 Very good friends.

320
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,240
 And I read an article where Brian was talking

321
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,080
 about his relationship with Peter at all.

322
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,560
 And basically, and it's a very long article,

323
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:03,120
 every single encounter ended up with Brian

324
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,240
 beating the shit out of him.

325
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,160
 That was the thread of it.

326
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,680
 And it even starts with him beating someone else up

327
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,280
 when he first meets Peter O'Toole.

328
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:15,120
 So he says that they first met at a party in the mid-50s.

329
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,160
 These are his words,

330
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,040
 where I'd memorably just punched Harold Pinter's lights out.

331
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:23,440
 He got one right on the side of the jaw.

332
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,880
 And Peter O'Toole comes over and says,

333
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,840
 "Wow, that's really good."

334
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,640
 And then Peter O'Toole, because he's this drunken man,

335
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,440
 any time he was on set with Brian Blessed on various movies,

336
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,880
 Brian would just beat him up.

337
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,680
 And those cases of him dragging him around the house

338
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:38,400
 as he was crying and throwing his arms around.

339
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,120
 But Peter O'Toole supposedly loved him.

340
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,040
 He said he was the only person who was, you know,

341
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,360
 properly honest and loved him.

342
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,160
 And they were very...

343
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,520
 It actually sounds like...

344
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,440
 Are you sure that Peter O'Toole loved to fight?

345
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,480
 What you've described there is the fact

346
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,480
 that Brian Blessed was a very violent man.

347
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:57,280
 So if you'd actually given my very interestingly

348
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,880
 long sentence a chance earlier,

349
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:03,040
 what I was trying to say was he was always in fights,

350
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,680
 which makes it suggest that he likes a fight,

351
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,320
 even though he was not necessarily the one instigating it.

352
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:08,720
 Otherwise, why would he not...

353
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,360
 Or at least he had an opinion on it.

354
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,760
 At least he had an opinion on it.

355
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,280
 One last thing on middle finger is if you do ASL,

356
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,320
 American Sign Language,

357
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:23,120
 then you can kind of make what you're saying profane

358
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,800
 by doing it with your middle finger.

359
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,720
 So for instance, if you do the sign for mother,

360
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,280
 but instead of pointing with the fingers

361
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,160
 you're supposed to point with,

362
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,680
 you point with your middle finger,

363
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,160
 it means motherfucker, for instance.

364
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:39,200
 And there's a few other things.

365
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,120
 Like for instance, the sign for a hearing person

366
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,680
 is kind of you do a little gesture around your mouth.

367
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:49,200
 And if you do it with your middle finger,

368
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,600
 then it's like, say, fucking hearing people.

369
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,480
 You know what I mean? It's a way of saying

370
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,120
 like what you want to say is actually quite profane.

371
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,680
 And they think this might be quite a new thing

372
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:03,600
 because there is a very old ASL symbol,

373
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:08,880
 which is having your forearm facing upwards

374
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,400
 and then doing the middle finger.

375
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,760
 And that is the sign for the CS Tower

376
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,160
 or the CN Tower in North America,

377
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,280
 those two big buildings.

378
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,240
 Basically, you have to do the middle finger

379
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,800
 and that is the sign for those buildings.

380
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,920
 For the CN, for the towers?

381
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:29,200
 So the CN Tower in Seattle or the CS Tower,

382
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,720
 which is in I think Chicago,

383
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,840
 but I can't remember.

384
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,200
 If you want to do a sign for that,

385
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,520
 you basically just do the finger.

386
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,640
 Do you think that's because the CN Tower is CNT?

387
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,640
 It really is not that.

388
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,480
 It's because it's got a spiky bit at the top.

389
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,720
 Yeah, yeah, whatever.

390
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,960
 I'm going to assume it's calling someone the C word.

391
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,160
 That's rude.

392
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:56,160
 My favorite river that I've recently read about

393
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,760
 is the Congo River,

394
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,320
 only because it's so unfathomably deep.

395
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,880
 And I kind of mean unfathomably literally there.

396
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,040
 So it's the deepest river in the world.

397
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,600
 It's 220 meters deep at the bottom.

398
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,560
 There's no light can penetrate that low.

399
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:14,160
 And I realized that if you put all of London

400
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,320
 into the deepest bit of the Congo River,

401
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,800
 only six buildings poke out of the top of it.

402
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:23,120
 So building you see the tip of is the cheese grater.

403
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,200
 That's 225 meters.

404
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,520
 And then the rest of us are all submerged.

405
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,360
 Is the shard submerged?

406
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,680
 Yeah, shards are taller.

407
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,680
 Shards are the highest, I think, tallest.

408
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:37,760
 But yeah, so if that does happen,

409
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,000
 we all have to flee to the top of the shard, I guess.

410
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,680
 That's going to be the least of our problems

411
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,040
 if all of the buildings in London

412
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,640
 get taken to the Congo River.

413
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,520
 I don't know how we've woken up

414
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,840
 with this situation being as it is, but...

415
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,240
 You've got to deal with it.

416
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,120
 That's really cool.

417
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,200
 That's good. Yeah, I don't think of rivers being

418
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,240
 anywhere near that deep.

419
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,360
 And I guess the point is that most of them are not, but this one is.

420
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,240
 Yeah. Yeah.

421
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,560
 Okay, I'm done. I can't touch the bottom, Andy, even on tiptoes.

422
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:09,840
 There was advice literature about beards

423
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,360
 that you could get back in the day

424
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,480
 in the time of the Beard Mania.

425
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,560
 And one of the best ones, again, to Dr. Whitty,

426
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:22,240
 was don't a manual of mistakes and improprieties,

427
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,880
 more or less prevalent in conduct and speech.

428
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,720
 And this was like a little pamphlet.

429
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,160
 On every page, it told you stuff you weren't allowed to do.

430
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,800
 At no stage did it tell you what you could do instead.

431
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,400
 It only told you what you couldn't do.

432
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,920
 And on one page, it says that if men have beards or whiskers,

433
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:41,040
 you should be careful to wash them after smoking

434
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:44,240
 and should not get in the habit of pulling your whiskers

435
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,440
 or justing your hair or otherwise fingering yourself.

436
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,400
 Sensible advice then, sensible advice now.

437
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,600
 Yeah. Some things don't age.

438
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,440
 But what am I supposed to do with these fingers?

439
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:00,480
 The funny thing about omelettes is that I've had maybe 20, 30,

440
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,840
 maybe even 40 different kinds of omelettes.

441
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,360
 They all tasted the same.

442
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,840
 I've never had an omelette that I can differentiate.

443
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,920
 This is a taste bud thing, isn't it, Athena?

444
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:11,600
 I mean, that sounds like you need to get your taste buds looked at.

445
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,640
 But specifically, a cheese omelette, a mushy one, a spinach omelette,

446
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,160
 it's a small egg to me.

447
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,760
 Don't you feel that way?

448
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,080
 I do feel that way, actually.

449
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,000
 You can taste the mushroom within it, right?

450
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,800
 But at the same time, I think what the egg does

451
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,000
 is it overpowers everything.

452
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,280
 So it doesn't matter what you put in it.

453
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,320
 It's just an omelette.

454
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,360
 It is powerful.

455
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,800
 You should try eggless omelette.

456
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,840
 That's what you need.

457
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,600
 Oh, that's the cheese sandwich.

458
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,440
 That's what that is and it's better.

459
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,640
 On the Challenger expedition, which I had never read about,

460
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,040
 they collected 4,800 new species.

461
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,160
 They found the Marianas Trench on the expedition.

462
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,120
 That's incredible.

463
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:45,520
 Yeah.

464
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,920
 Did they just have 7 miles of cable or whatever it was?

465
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,600
 I actually don't know how long--

466
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,720
 Solnar, I think, maybe?

467
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,360
 Yeah.

468
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,320
 In the 1880s?

469
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,520
 Yeah, so it was weird.

470
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,320
 No, maybe.

471
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,040
 I'm not sure.

472
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,240
 That's incredible.

473
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,000
 Yeah, I can't remember anything about it,

474
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,360
 but it does sound like an amazing expedition.

475
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,400
 Yeah, yeah.

476
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,720
 Maybe it was I once dropped a can of Coke into the ocean,

477
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,440
 very shallow, and it hit the bottom and came back up.

478
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,640
 So maybe that's what they did.

479
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,520
 Maybe they had sort of a--

480
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,640
 What are you even talking about?

481
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,240
 Well, maybe they got over the Marianas Trench

482
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,520
 dropping a can of soda over it.

483
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,800
 Was it Diet Coke?

484
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,840
 It was-- I can't remember actually.

485
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,320
 Just Diet Coke floats and normal Coke sinks.

486
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,080
 Ah, so it must have been sealed?

487
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,280
 Yeah, sealed, yeah.

488
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,520
 Hang on, it went to the bottom and it came back up again.

489
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:23,760
 Yeah.

490
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,520
 And you're suggesting that maybe they timed

491
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,960
 how long it took to come back?

492
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,040
 I'm just trying to spitball how this happened,

493
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,520
 and I just know that I've had practical experience with--

494
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,320
 Did that?

495
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,320
 What practical experience have you had, Andy?

496
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,840
 Well--

497
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,440
 Yeah, people in glass houses.

498
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,800
 I've never dropped a can.

499
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,840
 Compared to the rest of us,

500
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,720
 that is an expert.

501
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,680
 With his one experiment.

502
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,640
 So hang on.

503
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,000
 It went all the way to the bottom.

504
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:46,720
 Who knows?

505
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,440
 No, no, no.

506
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,520
 You know, because this is your experiment,

507
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,480
 it went all the way to the bottom

508
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,920
 and it came all the way back up to the top.

509
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,080
 Well, what I did was I did it in a swimming pool

510
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,440
 and then in shallow water,

511
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,720
 and then when we were out on a boat,

512
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,920
 we put a Coke can in.

513
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,920
 It disappeared for something like five minutes

514
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,040
 and then it bobbed back up.

515
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:01,920
 That's really interesting.

516
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,440
 Could be a change in pressure, I guess.

517
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,560
 Could be an octopus holding it.

518
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:08,240
 Read the back.

519
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,200
 Hate Diet Coke.

520
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,640
 Toss it back up.

521
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,200
 Why has Diet Coke never come down?

522
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,000
 What's going on?

523
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,360
 Wow.

524
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,360
 That's proper science, I would say.

525
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,000
 That is proper science.

526
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,480
 That was a proper science experiment.

527
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,720
 Yeah, you would have been on this expedition.

528
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,800
 I'm not suggesting that this is a real thing.

529
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,600
 Do you know where the largest

530
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,680
 man-made waterfall in the world is?

531
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,200
 Do you know who owns it?

532
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:31,840
 Man-made?

533
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,400
 Who owns the largest man-made waterfall in the world?

534
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,840
 So we're more likely to get who owns it

535
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,440
 rather than where it is, is what you're saying.

536
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,120
 Is it a squillionaire who we've heard of?

537
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,000
 Yes.

538
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 Have they recently been to space?

539
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,840
 They have not.

540
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,560
 Mosque.

541
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,280
 Elon Musk.

542
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:45,520
 No.

543
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,120
 Bill Gates.

544
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,640
 No, think of someone who has got no taste whatsoever.

545
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,280
 Trump.

546
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:51,840
 Trump, you're kidding.

547
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,360
 How did you all get that straight away?

548
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,000
 Amazing.

549
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 I feel like that clue was too easy to get.

550
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,760
 This is at the Trump National Westchester Golf Course.

551
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,520
 And basically every one of his courses has a fake waterfall

552
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,320
 and each one is more tacky than the previous.

553
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,280
 And they're so huge.

554
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,800
 If you're playing anywhere near them,

555
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,160
 you can't hear anyone speak

556
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,400
 because there's so much water going over the top of them.

557
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:19,840
 And this one at Westchester is the world's biggest.

558
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,320
 There is one at Changi Airport,

559
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,640
 which looks really big to me

560
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,080
 and possibly could be bigger,

561
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,680
 but according to Guinness Book of Records,

562
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,400
 this is the biggest.

563
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,120
 Wow.

564
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,240
 Do you know how tall it is?

565
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:30,720
 Did you say?

566
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,160
 I don't.

567
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:38,480
 I think it's 5,000 gallons go over every minute or second

568
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,600
 because I'm going off memory.

569
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,240
 But there's a lot of water.

570
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,040
 Okay, working out from that.

571
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:41,280
 Yeah.

572
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:45,840
 But another fake waterfall can be found in Australia

573
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,080
 and can be seen on our TV from time to time.

574
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,200
 Can you guess where that might be?

575
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,640
 Credits of neighbors.

576
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,080
 No.

577
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,440
 The Herbal Lessons is adverse.

578
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,200
 It's on TV.

579
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:55,760
 On TV.

580
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,400
 In Australia.

581
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,680
 So when do we see Australia on TV?

582
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,800
 Oh, so maybe Eris Rock?

583
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,600
 Is there like a weird bit of water that comes down?

584
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,120
 Water comes down there occasionally,

585
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,640
 but Eris Rock, I don't know if you know,

586
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,640
 or Uluru, is not a fake rock.

587
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,440
 So hang on.

588
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,440
 It's a fake rock that we see on our TV sometimes.

589
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,040
 A fake waterfall.

590
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,000
 Fake waterfall.

591
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,920
 But there's Australia that's on British TV sometimes.

592
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,200
 Very famous waterfall.

593
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:15,840
 Famous, famous.

594
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,400
 Our source.

595
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,120
 It's fake.

596
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:17,680
 It's fake.

597
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,200
 Is it known that it's fake

598
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,560
 or is this a secret you're busting open?

599
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,040
 I'm not busting it wide open,

600
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,400
 but I think some people know.

601
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,240
 It's a Sydney Opera House.

602
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,320
 It's not a waterfall.

603
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,200
 No, but I'm wondering.

604
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,200
 I thought there's a feature somewhere.

605
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,320
 I bet it's fake.

606
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,360
 We've been there.

607
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,800
 Yeah, I didn't see a waterfall.

608
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:38,080
 I'm just naming things in Australia now.

609
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:38,640
 Yeah, give us a tiny bit more.

610
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,360
 Crocodile.D.

611
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:43,760
 There's often a attractive young TV personality

612
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,800
 underneath it.

613
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,200
 Neighbours.

614
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,400
 No.

615
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:49,200
 No, but you can't just say neighbours.

616
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,840
 Oh, I'm a celebrity.

617
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,640
 I know you are Andy,

618
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,920
 but do you know the name of the show?

619
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:56,000
 Okay, so I'm a celebrity.

620
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,720
 Get me out of here.

621
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,960
 Yes, so they have that kind of place

622
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,320
 where they all go for a shower

623
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,760
 underneath a waterfall.

624
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,040
 And it turned out recently,

625
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,960
 they found out that this is a completely

626
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,160
 fake waterfall,

627
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,760
 and they can turn the taps on and off

628
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,800
 whenever they want to.

629
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,840
 No, you're kidding.

630
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,400
 And whenever anyone goes for a waterfall shower,

631
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,320
 they just turn the taps on and they get washed.

632
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,600
 That is brilliant.

633
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,880
 Do they that was like

634
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,960
 Mylene Klaas literally turning a hot water tap

635
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:19,600
 as the producers?

636
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,800
 No, it's the producers.

637
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,600
 What a shame of that.

638
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,960
 What a shower that would be.

639
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,040
 So which poor producer has to stand there

640
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,040
 watching the dry waterfall 24 hours a day

641
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,400
 in case someone stands under it?

642
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,760
 I guess it's not that bad a job, is it?

643
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,520
 It's one for an intern, I think.

644
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,080
 It's really sad though,

645
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,320
 because President McKinley used to genuinely

646
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,360
 really love handshakes.

647
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:39,840
 He used to...

648
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,480
 It said that it was his favorite thing to do

649
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,000
 was shake people's hands.

650
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,880
 And this guy basically used it as a tactic,

651
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,240
 as a way to...

652
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,000
 Yeah, because it was him that was killed

653
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:50,720
 this way, right?

654
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,520
 McKinley.

655
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,160
 Yeah.

656
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:52,880
 And he was killed...

657
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,280
 It was at a fun fair, wasn't it?

658
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,160
 He was at the Buffalo...

659
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,200
 Not a fun fair.

660
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,440
 Well, it was like the Buffalo World Fair.

661
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,120
 So it was one of those places...

662
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,560
 Sorry, Dan, it was a really big difference

663
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:05,440
 between fun fairs and the Buffalo World Fair.

664
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,520
 They were fun, I think, because, you know...

665
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,240
 It was fun space fair.

666
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,000
 Dan was just using it as a descriptor.

667
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,240
 It was a fun fair, not for William McKinley,

668
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,440
 but for everyone else there.

669
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,360
 It's like the fun fair down at Frinsbury Park,

670
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,320
 as opposed to, you know, this massive world fair

671
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,680
 where they were showing off, you know,

672
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:24,880
 American industry and, like, Belle or whoever else.

673
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:28,320
 My poor kids.

674
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,440
 Yeah, this is fun.

675
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,960
 This is fun.

676
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,360
 Dad.

677
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,960
 Speaking of concrete, there was a woman

678
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,560
 that called Sarah Goopy, and in 1811,

679
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:41,440
 she invented a new way of making piling for bridges.

680
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,000
 So when you make a bridge, you need to kind of

681
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,760
 fire some stuff into the ground,

682
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,360
 so they'll hold it solid and put some concrete in there

683
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,120
 to make the foundations.

684
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,120
 And so she came up with a new way of doing this,

685
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,600
 and she was a friend of Isambar Kingdom Brunel,

686
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,440
 and so Brunel basically used all of her piling tactics

687
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,480
 for all of his bridges,

688
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,560
 but she didn't patent it because she said,

689
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,880
 "It is unpleasant to speak of oneself.

690
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,600
 It may seem boastful, particularly in a woman."

691
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,720
 So she decided not to patent it,

692
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,520
 and this kind of technique was used in a load of bridges.

693
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,160
 Come on, Goopy.

694
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,640
 She did come up with a few things that she did patent,

695
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,720
 so she came up with a method of keeping ships free of barnacles,

696
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,720
 which made her 40 grams from the government,

697
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,760
 because it was so important.

698
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,960
 Wow. I'm sure.

699
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,040
 I mean, that's so important, that as well.

700
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:29,600
 Exactly.

701
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,280
 That's not a lot of money for how important that is.

702
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,600
 She must have identified there was a Goopy in the market.

703
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,600
 A Gaffin in the market.

704
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,160
 Yeah, no, no.

705
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:36,960
 Yeah, we did Gaffin.

706
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,360
 No, no, no.

707
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:37,600
 A Gaffin.

708
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,160
 A Gaffin, yeah.

709
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,920
 It feels like it's not the right Goopy pun

710
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,520
 when we're talking about ships and water.

711
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:49,760
 Here's another quite French politician, Gaston Daffaer,

712
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,040
 and he was a participant in the last duel

713
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,560
 that ever took place in France.

714
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,240
 This was in 1967.

715
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:01,920
 And Daffaer had insulted René Rivière in the French parliament.

716
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:05,920
 He'd said, "T'es et vous abloutir,"

717
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,000
 which means, apparently, "Shut up, stupid."

718
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,360
 And so they decided they were going to have a duel.

719
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:15,600
 And Daffaer vowed that he wouldn't kill Rivière

720
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,680
 because it was the night before his wedding

721
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,120
 that they'd organized this duel.

722
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,840
 But he said, "I will only wound you

723
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,560
 and spoil your wedding night very considerably."

724
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:27,280
 Otherwise, it wouldn't be Daffaer.

725
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,720
 Just stunning.

726
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,920
 And James, what was the upshot of the duel?

727
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:36,160
 So Daffaer won, but there were a couple of nicks

728
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,280
 that he put on Rivière.

729
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,160
 He wasn't like it.

730
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,840
 He didn't chop his penis off or anything.

731
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,600
 It was just like a few cuts.

732
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,480
 And then the guy who was officiating the duel,

733
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,200
 who was France's secretary of state for foreign affairs,

734
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,760
 decided this is enough.

735
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,320
 Enough's enough.

736
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:53,120
 We're going to call it a win for Daffaer.

737
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,960
 I've actually been up a lookout tree.

738
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:59,440
 Yeah, so in Australia, sort of south of Perth,

739
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,200
 there is three trees.

740
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,880
 The Dave Evans Bicentennial tree.

741
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,880
 There's the Glossestra tree and the Diamond tree.

742
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,000
 I don't know which one I was up

743
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 because I went as a kid as like 10 or so.

744
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,720
 So basically, the way you get up these trees

745
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,480
 is that they slammed in these metal bars

746
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,920
 and they would go circular around it

747
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,360
 and you would climb to the top

748
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,720
 and then you'd have that hut there.

749
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,480
 And it was petrifying,

750
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,760
 but I had sort of kid confidence

751
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,280
 to get up to the top.

752
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:21,920
 And you climb.

753
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,520
 And so you climb on these metal bars.

754
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,880
 Is it climbing on all fours?

755
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,240
 Yeah, you're climbing on all fours.

756
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,000
 And there's nothing underneath you.

757
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,280
 Like there's no, there's no meshing.

758
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,360
 Were you employed by the Forestry Commission?

759
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,800
 They open it up to the public.

760
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:35,920
 So it's no longer a used tree for those purposes.

761
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,840
 And so tourists can just rock up and go.

762
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,760
 And they say, don't go up if you're afraid of heights

763
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:43,440
 or if you might have a heart attack or if you're a kid.

764
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,800
 I don't know why I was allowed up.

765
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,400
 And I do remember we went to the top.

766
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,920
 My sister and I, and there was a couple sitting,

767
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:54,640
 shivering, petrified in the corner of the hut at the top.

768
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,360
 And we went down.

769
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:55,920
 Too scared to go back down?

770
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,720
 Too scared to go back down.

771
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,440
 It was petrifying.

772
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,080
 Oh no.

773
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,160
 Like it was, if you look down, I mean it's...

774
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,840
 But is it, when you go back down,

775
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,200
 presumably you have to climb back.

776
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,160
 Like you're descending a ladder.

777
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:04,640
 Yeah.

778
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,040
 Right.

779
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:05,360
 Exactly.

780
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,560
 But with much more of an angle I guess.

781
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:06,720
 Yeah.

782
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,360
 And here's the thing.

783
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,680
 There was no system whereby you would go up one way

784
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:10,480
 and come down the other.

785
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,040
 Oh sure.

786
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,880
 You would bump into people coming up on the way.

787
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,280
 Yeah, yeah.

788
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,360
 So would you have to go all the way back up?

789
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,040
 Like if you're only 40% of the way down

790
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,080
 and they're 60% of the way up,

791
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,760
 is it like you have to climb all the way back up to the top?

792
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,640
 I remember shimming past someone who leaned into the tree.

793
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,080
 Yeah, yeah.

794
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:26,640
 It does sound horrific.

795
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,320
 This, I mean I would absolutely love to do it.

796
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,400
 But also, why did you call it the Glossester Tree?

797
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,520
 Is that what they call it in Australia?

798
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,120
 No, I'd probably just pronounce it weirdly, hey.

799
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,720
 Well I thought maybe all Australians do

800
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:36,640
 because they can't pronounce, you know,

801
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:37,840
 in this place names.

802
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,640
 Glossester, yeah.

803
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:39,520
 It would have been the Glossester Tree.

804
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,040
 I certainly have called it the Glossester Tree.

805
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:45,040
 I was once skiing with my in-laws and I was at the top

806
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,200
 and I didn't, I don't like other people seeing me skiing

807
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,240
 because I'm so bad at it.

808
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,360
 And I get really embarrassed

809
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,200
 because I keep falling over and stuff.

810
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,840
 And my father-in-law went down the first bit

811
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,040
 and then he stopped.

812
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,360
 I'm like, oh fuck's sake, he's waiting for me

813
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:00,000
 because he's trying to be polite and he wants to wait.

814
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,920
 So anyway, I was like, I'm not going.

815
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:02,480
 I'm not going.

816
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,080
 So I waited at the top and I waited at the top

817
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,520
 for about 40 minutes.

818
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,280
 And then eventually he went down

819
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,120
 and then I kind of followed him down.

820
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,240
 And then I spoke to him afterwards

821
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,160
 and he said he was too scared to go back down

822
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,320
 and then he was just trying to get up the courage to go down.

823
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:14,880
 Oh my God.

824
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,320
 And I thought that he was just spying to see

825
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,360
 if I was going to fall over.

826
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,160
 God.

827
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,200
 So funny.

828
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,640
 That's very...

829
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,240
 That's such a weird situation.

830
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,040
 Just all the women in the family,

831
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,320
 the bottom-going, why?

832
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,840
 What are those two doing?

833
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,680
 That is a moment where you go to Polina.

834
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,640
 You've married your father.

835
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,200
 Yeah, yeah.

836
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:40,640
 There was a mountainer who made kit out of balloon material.

837
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:44,240
 So George Finch was an Aussie mountain climber

838
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,960
 and he went on the Mallory expedition in 1922

839
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,120
 and invented the Eiderdown coat,

840
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,560
 the puffer jacket, essentially,

841
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,240
 from hot air balloon material

842
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,880
 when everyone else on the trip was wearing tweed.

843
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,600
 So it's a really radical thing to a veteran.

844
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,520
 And all the other mountaineers laughed at him.

845
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,560
 It's really, you know...

846
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,000
 He wasn't wearing a basket on his feet.

847
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,440
 But imagine being laughed at by a lot of people wearing tweed.

848
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:05,840
 I know.

849
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:08,160
 Sounds like my school days.

850
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:12,000
 And he was really looked down on by the other mountaineers.

851
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,920
 So he was observed repairing his own boots

852
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,360
 very, you know, very unclassy behavior.

853
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,200
 And the deputy leader of the expedition

854
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,040
 who was called Colonel Edward Strut said,

855
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,960
 "I always knew the fellow was a shit."

856
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,520
 Just thought he was invented a new jacket

857
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,360
 and he's cleaned, repaired his own boots.

858
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,880
 What a way with words this guy had.

859
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,560
 Yeah, but he had the last laugh

860
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,560
 because obviously no wind got through his amazing jacket

861
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,480
 and he was feeling a lot warmer.

862
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,280
 Yeah.

863
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,800
 So today there's still something like 500 lookouts in America

864
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,680
 and they reckon it's a 50/50 split of men and women.

865
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:43,920
 Yeah.

866
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,920
 And they reckon it kind of was that in,

867
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,280
 not the very earliest period,

868
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,240
 but as soon as the sort of ceiling was broke

869
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,000
 and the first woman started doing it,

870
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,800
 which was this lady who was called Halle Morse Daggett

871
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,840
 and she became the first female to serve in the Forest Service.

872
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,320
 And it's an amazing recommendation that she got in order.

873
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:00,960
 Did you read that letter?

874
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,000
 Yeah, I think so.

875
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:02,800
 It's incredible.

876
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,240
 This guy who was the ranger,

877
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,320
 he wrote a letter to his boss saying that he thought

878
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,000
 that Daggett would be the best person for the job.

879
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,920
 But obviously there were three people applying

880
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:10,720
 and two of them were men.

881
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,320
 It should have gone to one of them.

882
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:12,960
 Is that me?

883
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:13,440
 He should.

884
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,640
 Yeah, I agree.

885
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,560
 I think we could all agree on that then.

886
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,040
 No, no, no.

887
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:17,760
 I'm backtracking.

888
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:21,600
 So how on earth did this woman get the job?

889
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,480
 I don't understand.

890
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,080
 Oh, I am still furious about this.

891
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:27,760
 So what he wrote in the letter was,

892
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,640
 "The novelty of the proposition which has been unloaded upon me

893
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,040
 and which I am now endeavouring to pass up to you

894
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,200
 may perhaps take your breath away."

895
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,960
 Like just like even that thought alone.

896
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,800
 Like the fair the end where he said,

897
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,200
 "She is absolutely devoid of the timidity

898
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,000
 which is ordinarily associated with her sex."

899
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,280
 Okay, but she's not afraid of anything

900
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,960
 that walks, creeps or flies.

901
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,040
 She is a perfect lady in every respect.

902
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,640
 Wow.

903
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,600
 That's a perfect lady.

904
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:57,360
 General Motors, they make artificial stalactites

905
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,800
 out of their car byproducts.

906
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,400
 Weird wine.

907
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,040
 And pretty weird.

908
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:01,600
 For wear.

909
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,480
 For the bats.

910
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,120
 Yeah.

911
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:03,360
 Cool.

912
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,880
 For bats to cling onto.

913
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,600
 So they've installed a couple of hundred of these across the USA.

914
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,720
 They put them in caves

915
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,560
 because it gives the bats more surface area

916
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,960
 to spread out and hang from.

917
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,280
 And that means when the bats have more space

918
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,880
 they don't all cluster together

919
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,400
 because when they cluster together

920
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,240
 they spread this disease amongst themselves

921
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,520
 called white nose syndrome

922
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,720
 which is kind of fungus.

923
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,080
 That's very bad for the bats.

924
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,680
 And as we know, if we've learned anything,

925
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,920
 it's that you should try and keep the bats healthy.

926
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:31,360
 And so General Motors have started installing these.

927
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:31,680
 Right.

928
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,960
 What do they, I thought you were going to say

929
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,840
 there was some sort of amazing benefit for General Motors

930
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,040
 as a company to do this.

931
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:37,680
 PR.

932
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:38,240
 Just PR.

933
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,840
 The intangible benefits of PR

934
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:40,560
 are huge then.

935
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,720
 I'm talking about them now.

936
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,440
 General Motors.

937
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:46,480
 The bats tell their other bat friends

938
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,000
 and they tell their other bat friends

939
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,120
 and before you know it.

940
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:49,840
 There we go.

941
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,600
 Is the car market big in the bat world?

942
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,240
 Do they particularly like?

943
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,120
 Yeah, the Batmobile.

944
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:53,760
 Come on.

945
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,320
 Good point.

946
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,240
 It's just the one model, isn't it?

947
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:56,720
 That's true.

948
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,440
 You'll get letters.

949
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,560
 There are loads of models there.

950
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,040
 Oh my God.

951
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,880
 It does look like models in the Batmobile.

952
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:03,600
 Sorry.

953
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,720
 No, thank you for saving me

954
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,640
 because I saw you think about letting me

955
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,600
 drop myself in there.

956
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:13,920
 [Music]

957
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,360
 There's another wives tale that you tell

958
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,600
 if something is a fossil by licking it.

959
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:21,120
 Yeah, is it supposed to have air holes

960
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,600
 and it's stickier to your tongue or something?

961
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,880
 I've got to tell you I've been on so many

962
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,640
 archaeological sites and once in a while

963
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,160
 some of the undergrads will be like,

964
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,960
 like nobody knows what on earth it means.

965
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,360
 They've just got stone to their tongues.

966
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,520
 It's, I don't think it's very interesting.

967
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,400
 But what's the idea?

968
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,280
 As in what are you meant to get from it?

969
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,560
 It's supposed to be different.

970
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,400
 I think it's supposed to stick more

971
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,680
 if it's actually a fossil.

972
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,800
 It's supposed to be like...

973
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,080
 It's not.

974
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:46,960
 Oh, what is it now?

975
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,880
 It's supposed to have little tiny holes in it

976
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,480
 that when you put your tongue into it

977
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,000
 it kind of sticks to your tongue.

978
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,880
 And I worry very much that your undergrads

979
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,160
 might have heard this on QI.

980
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,600
 I think we might...

981
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,280
 Oh my God, I think you're right.

982
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,800
 We might have a retraction to make

983
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,600
 if that's not true.

984
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:08,240
 Yeah, yeah, we've thunked your undergrads accidentally

985
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,040
 and I'm sorry.

986
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:12,000
 The best method is actually just to see

987
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:12,960
 if it will break apart,

988
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,240
 which is kind of similar with the crop.

989
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,240
 Because if it's bone it will just snap.

990
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,040
 But obviously you don't really want

991
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,680
 to be snapping fossils, for obvious reasons.

992
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,000
 Yeah.

993
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,840
 But I've definitely been on archaeological...

994
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,600
 I've got two fossils then if you do that.

995
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,400
 Definitely.

996
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:24,800
 Charged up.

997
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,440
 You're not coming with me on a tube, James.

998
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:31,200
 What we found, 16 finds.

999
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,200
 I swear we started with eight.

1000
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,320
 But no, yeah, I was on an expedition

1001
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,960
 and we had this massive argument

1002
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,920
 about if something was a fossil or a stone.

1003
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,560
 And I might have accidentally dropped it

1004
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,840
 and it made such a loud noise.

1005
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,280
 We were like, "That's a stone."

1006
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:51,280
 But then another time a professor was

1007
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,240
 massively arguing with me.

1008
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,680
 And I was like, "I swear it's a fossil."

1009
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,680
 As you can tell, I think everything is a fossil.

1010
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,120
 Even when it's stone.

1011
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:57,920
 And he was like, "No, it's not.

1012
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,120
 It's a stone. It's a stone."

1013
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:01,680
 And then he went, "Look, you can't break it."

1014
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,000
 And then he broke it and he was like, "Oh, let's just pretend that I don't."

1015
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,160
 So much history destroyed.

1016
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:12,000
 By the professor, that was the best fit.

1017
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:12,640
 But yeah.

1018
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:15,760
 Other marine worms do that kind of dissolving thing, don't they?

1019
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,440
 There's a worm called the zombie worm,

1020
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,800
 which feeds off skeletons of mostly whales

1021
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,360
 but other dead ocean animals at the bottom of the sea.

1022
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:26,240
 And that sends acid out onto the bone,

1023
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,760
 which kind of melts it.

1024
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,920
 Well, it dissolves it.

1025
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,640
 And then they just live inside whale bones forever and ever.

1026
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,360
 And they're really cool.

1027
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,720
 The thing I like about them is that the males

1028
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,960
 just live inside the females forever.

1029
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,080
 So there'll be one female

1030
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,240
 and then they'll have about 100 males living inside them.

1031
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,280
 No, really?

1032
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,320
 And they just live there.

1033
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:45,920
 And they feed off her yolk of her eggs.

1034
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,200
 And then eventually they inseminate her.

1035
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:50,000
 Because they were looking for the males, right?

1036
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,560
 Because they knew they found the sperm inside the females.

1037
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,000
 So they were like, "Well, where are the males?"

1038
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,680
 And it turned out the sperm was the males.

1039
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:59,520
 It's like they're the little guys who live inside the female.

1040
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,480
 That's incredible.

1041
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,240
 Do the males ever leave the female

1042
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,320
 and find they're a new female?

1043
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,280
 Do they ever break up?

1044
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:05,760
 I don't think.

1045
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,800
 I think you haven't got a choice.

1046
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,120
 It's very much an arranged marriage to the situation.

1047
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:12,000
 But what about when the female gives birth

1048
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
 or when she lays eggs that then hatch?

1049
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,080
 Yeah, they must have to swim around

1050
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,200
 to find another female, unfortunately.

1051
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,000
 How do they...

1052
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:18,400
 Yeah.

1053
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,440
 Do they get...

1054
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,280
 When they hatch, when a female hatches,

1055
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:24,080
 as in when a female, one of these fish hatches,

1056
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,040
 how do they get new males?

1057
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:25,760
 I guess, yeah, you're right.

1058
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:26,800
 They just swim around and they...

1059
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:27,440
 Find them.

1060
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,720
 Oh, yeah, I don't actually know.

1061
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,520
 They probably just look for some tasty bones

1062
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,200
 where everyone else is hanging around.

1063
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,360
 That's where the term boning comes from.

1064
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,440
 What am I talking about?

1065
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:40,000
 The interesting thing is that they do...

1066
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,640
 They live on whale bones.

1067
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:45,840
 But also, they've been found living on the food,

1068
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:48,240
 the bones of the food that people throw on the boat.

1069
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:48,560
 Really?

1070
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,040
 Yeah.

1071
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,200
 And that is where the phrase "throw me a bone" comes from.

1072
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:57,120
 There was lots of reasons that people climb Mont Blanc.

1073
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,960
 This was from a book called "Killing Dragons,

1074
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:01,040
 the Conquest of the Alps" by Fergus Fleming.

1075
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:04,960
 In 1818, there was a Russian count called Matsefsky,

1076
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:08,480
 who did it because he wanted to improve his poetry skills.

1077
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:11,920
 Yeah, do you think?

1078
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:12,160
 No.

1079
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:12,800
 I don't know.

1080
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,000
 What's he practicing there?

1081
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:14,800
 Is it the writing of?

1082
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:15,360
 Is it the speaking of poetry?

1083
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:17,440
 I think he's thinking seeing all that beauty

1084
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:18,640
 will help life poetry.

1085
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,840
 Yeah, I kind of get that though.

1086
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:21,680
 Being inspired by amazing stuff,

1087
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:24,000
 because there is a Shelley poem called Mont Blanc,

1088
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,040
 which is one of the worst Shelley poems.

1089
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,480
 There's a, what is it?

1090
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,680
 What is he writing with Blanc?

1091
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:32,000
 Blanc Mont.

1092
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,760
 There was someone I knew who had a tutor,

1093
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,600
 who, you know, an English literature tutor,

1094
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:41,680
 who said poetry is better than sex,

1095
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:43,760
 apart from Shelley's Mont Blanc.

1096
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,040
 Sex is better than Mont Blanc.

1097
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:50,640
 There was a guy called John Oljo,

1098
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,160
 and he climbed because he wanted to see

1099
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,320
 a better reflection of the mountain in the lake.

1100
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,600
 So he thought he couldn't see it properly from the ground,

1101
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,760
 so he had to go to the top so they could see it.

1102
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,120
 So you know the lake was there,

1103
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:01,920
 if it was halfway up the mountain.

1104
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:02,800
 It's strange, isn't it?

1105
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,840
 And also, can you really see the mountain reflection

1106
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,040
 from a lake that's below you?

1107
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:07,600
 Maybe you can.

1108
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:08,000
 I don't know.

1109
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,400
 There was a guy called Comte Henri de Tully,

1110
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,120
 who climbed because he wanted to cheer himself up

1111
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:14,160
 after a failed affair.

1112
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:17,920
 And there was a guy called Edward Boutal Wildbraham,

1113
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,720
 who climbed Mont Blanc because he had been told not to.

1114
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,000
 Cool.

1115
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:22,560
 Wow.

1116
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,320
 That's literally all I know about it.

1117
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,000
 Was he an eight-year-old in a strop?

1118
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:26,640
 What have you done?

1119
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,400
 Isn't that amazing?

1120
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,320
 It's like proper reverse psychology.

1121
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,240
 Don't climb that mountain.

1122
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,600
 It's mad.

1123
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:34,720
 It's bigger.

1124
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,480
 Do you think the tallest curtains ever made

1125
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:40,000
 are taller than the widest curtains ever made are wide?

1126
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:40,480
 Okay.

1127
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:40,960
 Or do you...?

1128
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:41,440
 No.

1129
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:44,480
 No, I would think width is easier to make than height.

1130
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,240
 John?

1131
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:46,960
 I'm going to go height.

1132
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:50,560
 Okay, well, the obvious answer is,

1133
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:51,760
 I'm afraid the correct one here.

1134
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:56,640
 I wish I could have some kind of exclusive minority report for you,

1135
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:00,880
 but no, the tallest curtains are only half as high

1136
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,720
 as the widest curtains are wide.

1137
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:06,160
 That's actually still a surprisingly large proportion

1138
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:07,040
 of the widest curtains.

1139
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:07,760
 That's quite tall.

1140
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:10,000
 Also, they're 65 metres tall.

1141
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,120
 I mean, that's incredible.

1142
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:13,760
 Also, all you need to do is just flip it the other way up,

1143
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,120
 and then you've got the tallest curtain.

1144
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:16,960
 Yeah, that's a really good point.

1145
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:21,360
 Just turn your landscape curtains into portrait curtains,

1146
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:22,800
 and they're much taller.

1147
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,880
 There has been a new kind of paper invented

1148
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:27,840
 made from biomaterials.

1149
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:31,200
 So you take parts of people's body,

1150
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:32,480
 and you kind of squish it down

1151
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,480
 and do a load of chemical stuff to it,

1152
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,720
 and you can get this new kind of paper.

1153
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:39,040
 And the idea is that they can use it

1154
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:41,040
 by kind of folding it into certain ways,

1155
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,280
 and it will help to heal wounds,

1156
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,760
 or it will help the body to regenerate organ tissue,

1157
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:46,320
 stuff like that.

1158
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:49,280
 So it's a way of using origami inside the human body.

1159
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:52,400
 And it's really interesting the way they discovered this.

1160
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,000
 There was a guy called Adam Jacobs,

1161
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,240
 and it's one of those discoveries

1162
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,320
 where it was an accidental discovery,

1163
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:04,160
 because he'd actually created an ink made from an ovary

1164
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,480
 that he was going to use for a 3D printer,

1165
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:10,080
 and he spilled the ink, and it kind of hardened

1166
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:11,200
 and turned into this paper,

1167
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:12,480
 and he realised that he could use that.

1168
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:14,320
 And I know there are more questions to be asked

1169
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:15,760
 at the start of that sentence.

1170
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:16,240
 Sure.

1171
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:20,080
 You saw questions appear on our faces

1172
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:21,600
 one after the other.

1173
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:22,880
 What ovary?

1174
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,440
 Well, that's the way that they make these biomaterials

1175
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:28,720
 is they take body parts from people.

1176
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:29,920
 Is it a human ovary?

1177
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:30,720
 Human ovary.

1178
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,480
 Actually, I think it was a pig ovary this one,

1179
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:33,680
 but the hope is in the future

1180
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:35,760
 they'll be able to use human body parts as well,

1181
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,840
 or maybe stem cells to create them.

1182
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:40,240
 So is the idea that you would sacrifice, let's say, a finger,

1183
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,960
 but you would get a cool new power?

1184
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,400
 No, no, no.

1185
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,560
 It's almost like you haven't understood anything I've said.

1186
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:53,920
 It's more like you would get stem cells to create some kind of biomaterials,

1187
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:56,400
 and then that would turn into a paper kind of material,

1188
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:00,560
 and you'd be able to fold it and help to cover wounds or...

1189
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:03,760
 Or swallow it, and it springs into a fake heart inside you or something.

1190
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,440
 That is closer to what might happen

1191
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:06,240
 than what Andy said.

1192
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:09,760
 James said you can make it from a body part,

1193
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:12,560
 so if in extremis you cut off your own finger...

1194
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:14,000
 Yeah, but you'd only be using the finger

1195
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,560
 to make some paper bandage to put over that...

1196
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:17,760
 Yeah, you're a missing finger.

1197
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:20,640
 Oh, I see. I see it's a problem that's solving its own creation.

1198
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:21,920
 It's a false economy, really.

1199
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:22,880
 Yeah, you're right.

1200
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,640
 Pretty cool, though.

1201
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:25,280
 Amazing.

1202
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:30,560
 Until the 70s and 80s, a lot of geographers assumed that elephants couldn't swim,

1203
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:33,600
 and so when you found elephant bones on an island,

1204
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,040
 there must have been a land bridge,

1205
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:37,280
 because otherwise there's no way they could have got across.

1206
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:40,320
 There's a debate about how elephants got to Sri Lanka, isn't there?

1207
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:43,840
 And lots of other places used to have elephants like Malta and Crete and Cyprus.

1208
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:46,320
 None of which I think have elephants now.

1209
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:50,080
 I've been to Malta and it's quite a small island.

1210
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:53,280
 You would struggle to hide a wild elephant population on it.

1211
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:56,480
 They also have British homestars there, don't they?

1212
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:59,600
 Which is an extinct shop in the UK,

1213
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,760
 but it still goes on in Malta.

1214
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:04,560
 Do you reckon there was a land bridge once from the UK to Malta

1215
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:06,160
 where British homestars...

1216
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:14,000
 Frantically taking their reasonably-priced outer rain garments with them.

1217
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,400
 God, you're right.

1218
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:17,920
 Malta is one of those funny places, though,

1219
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,440
 because they've got a BHS.

1220
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,040
 They've still got a mother care.

1221
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:23,520
 I don't think there's a mother care on the British mainland anymore.

1222
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:27,840
 And it's just like that thing where a species goes extinct on the mainland,

1223
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:28,800
 but it survives on the island.

1224
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:31,040
 Yeah, but the thing is, because it's an island,

1225
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:33,520
 they get either very, very big or very, very small.

1226
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,520
 So the mother care is really tiny,

1227
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:38,000
 whereas the British homestars is massive.

1228
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,040
 That's so funny.

1229
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:41,200
 Do you know, when I got there, when I got to Malta,

1230
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:44,400
 I shared a cab from the airport to the main town,

1231
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,320
 because some guy just approached me and said,

1232
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:47,280
 "Do you want to share a cab?"

1233
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,520
 And then he turned out, he said he didn't have any money.

1234
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:52,400
 It was all a bit dodgy, but he...

1235
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:53,680
 You've been duped, my friend.

1236
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:56,880
 He was a really peculiar guy,

1237
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:01,200
 because he said he was there for some kind of corporate espionage purposes.

1238
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:02,560
 Right?

1239
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:04,080
 And he said that's what he does,

1240
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:06,160
 and he goes around to make sure that, for example,

1241
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,240
 the Maltese mother care aren't selling.

1242
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,320
 He's probably from Chinese homestars.

1243
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:14,640
 It was so unclear what he was doing,

1244
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:16,640
 and then he found out I had some kind of job in the media,

1245
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:18,880
 and he didn't say a word for the rest of the journey,

1246
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,080
 except to clarify, perhaps,

1247
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:22,640
 that he didn't have any money to pay for the cab at the end of it.

1248
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:25,040
 Sounds like he really didn't want you to mention him publicly,

1249
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:28,560
 so it's a good thing that this will be going out to a few hundred thousand people.

1250
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:31,680
 I have one last thing, which is,

1251
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:36,240
 I think I have found the only copperlight street in the world.

1252
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:40,320
 Okay, what do you mean, like it's paved with poo?

1253
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:43,120
 No, it's called Copperlight Street.

1254
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:46,320
 As far as I can tell, I've gone on Google Maps,

1255
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:47,760
 and I've put copperlight in,

1256
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:51,760
 and there's only one place in the world that has it on its sign.

1257
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:53,040
 Is it in Light Regis?

1258
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:53,920
 Oh, no.

1259
00:49:53,920 --> 00:50:00,160
 It's an Ipswich, which is in Suffolk for anyone overseas listening.

1260
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:03,200
 And yeah, it's Copperlight Street.

1261
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:07,040
 It was named that because there was a guy called Edward Packer,

1262
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:11,840
 who started basically a fossil feces factory,

1263
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:13,600
 burning it up and using the energy.

1264
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:20,880
 He was known as the Golden Muck Man of Ipswich, or the Copperlight King.

1265
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:22,160
 Yeah, the Copperlight King.

1266
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:24,000
 Man, what a great name.

1267
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
 Where are they finding enough fossils to...

1268
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,520
 Yeah, I guess back in the day in the 1800s, they're everywhere, right?

1269
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:30,880
 Somewhere near Ipswich, I guess.

1270
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:33,120
 Norwich, no.

1271
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:37,280
 I can't believe the way you researched, Dan,

1272
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:39,040
 is you just type in all the keywords

1273
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:40,880
 that were researching that week into Google Maps

1274
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:43,120
 to see if there were places named after them.

1275
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:44,880
 Adam, do you think this is genius,

1276
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:47,760
 or are you just disappointed with your teammate?

1277
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,040
 I wish I thought of it first.

1278
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:52,400
 Seven years, it's finally paid off.

1279
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,000
 Copperlight Street, you wouldn't have thought.

1280
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,160
 The only one in the world.

1281
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:00,160
 Looking at that list, that massive list of Copperlight Facts,

1282
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,480
 I just imagined Dan being like, "Yeah, we're running out of facts."

1283
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,800
 So I'm just going to not Google it,

1284
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,480
 I'm going to literally Google Earth it.

1285
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,640
 Do you want to think outside of the box here?

1286
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:14,800
 Okay, that's it.

1287
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,240
 That's all of our facts.

1288
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,800
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,880

 another normal episode.

1307
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:05,920
 But in the meantime,

1308
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:08,080
 hope you enjoy your bank holiday weekend

1309
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:09,040

1315
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:20,600
 (upbeat music)

1316
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:23,180
 (upbeat music)

1317
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:25,760
