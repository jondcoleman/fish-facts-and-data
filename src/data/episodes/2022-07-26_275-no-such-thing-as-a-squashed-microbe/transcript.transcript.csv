00:00:07,00:00:14,"[ forgot to sing ""Horororora""]"
00:00:14,00:00:19,"Hello, and welcome to another episode of ""No Such Thing as a Fish"" a weekly podcast"
00:00:19,00:00:22,this week coming to you live from Oxford!
00:00:22,00:00:29,[ Cheers and applause ]
00:00:29,00:00:35,"My name is Dan Schreiber, and I am sitting here with Anna Chazinski, Andrew Huntson Murray,"
00:00:35,00:00:40,"and James Harkin, and once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite"
00:00:40,00:00:45,"facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:45,00:00:47,"Starting with you, Andy."
00:00:47,00:00:56,"My fact is, that hippos sometimes poo into rivers so much that all the fish downstream die."
00:00:56,00:00:59,This is such cool science.
00:00:59,00:01:01,What if you're a fish?
00:01:01,00:01:02,Yeah.
00:01:02,00:01:03,What if you're a fish?
00:01:03,00:01:04,This is a horror story if you're a fish?
00:01:04,00:01:05,"Yes, true."
00:01:05,00:01:08,"So, quick shout out to the scientists who did this, the team who did this was scientist Chris"
00:01:08,00:01:13,"Dustin and Amanda Subulloski, and the hippos poo a lot into rivers."
00:01:13,00:01:18,"Basically, pooing is one of the main things that hippos do, and they do it for, you know,"
00:01:18,00:01:24,"all sorts of purposes, communication, and mostly to get it out of their bodies, mostly for"
00:01:24,00:01:32,"pooing purposes, but is technically called organic matter loading, if one I call it, surely it's"
00:01:32,00:01:33,unloading.
00:01:33,00:01:36,"Depends what, if you're loading the river?"
00:01:36,00:01:37,I guess.
00:01:37,00:01:38,"Oh, yes."
00:01:38,00:01:39,"No, I don't know."
00:01:39,00:01:40,"No, you're right."
00:01:40,00:01:41,You're right.
00:01:41,00:01:43,"Well, I'm not sure I am."
00:01:43,00:01:49,"But, so they eat a lot of grass, and they eat it at night because it's cooler when they're"
00:01:49,00:01:53,"out of the river feeding, and in the daytime, they wallow in the river to stay cool."
00:01:53,00:01:56,So this was on a river called the Mara between Kenya and Tanzania.
00:01:56,00:02:03,"There are 4,000 hippos living in this river, and these hippos deposit 8,500 kilos of waste"
00:02:03,00:02:09,"every day into quite a short section of river, and it turns into this huge sludge at the"
00:02:09,00:02:13,"bottom of the river, and then in the dry season, the river shrinks and dries up a bit."
00:02:13,00:02:19,"But then when it rains, this massive tidal wave of hippo poo gets churned up, and all"
00:02:19,00:02:22,"of this sludge gets washed down, and it doesn't have much oxygen in it because of all"
00:02:22,00:02:25,"the bacteria, which have been consuming the poo."
00:02:25,00:02:29,"So the oxygen levels in the water plummet, all the fish die."
00:02:29,00:02:34,"So it's bad news if you're a fish, but it's good news if you're something that eats fish,"
00:02:34,00:02:36,and don't mind a little bit of pooey aftertaste.
00:02:36,00:02:37,Yeah.
00:02:37,00:02:40,"You're definitely sending that back, if you're at a restaurant."
00:02:40,00:02:41,The fish looks great.
00:02:41,00:02:46,It's just the hippo shit all over at this.
00:02:46,00:02:51,"So things like stalks, fultches, crocodiles, hyenas, but they eat these fish really quickly"
00:02:51,00:02:52,once they die off.
00:02:52,00:02:57,"And actually, the researcher says if you weren't there to see it, you wouldn't know it's happening"
00:02:57,00:02:59,because it happens so quickly that they come and eat all this stuff.
00:02:59,00:03:00,Wow.
00:03:00,00:03:05,It's a really good way of the nutrition cycle almost happening through the ecosystem.
00:03:05,00:03:06,Yeah.
00:03:06,00:03:09,"The researchers who did this, it was in Kenya, wasn't it?"
00:03:09,00:03:11,And they couldn't do it themselves.
00:03:11,00:03:14,They couldn't go and analyze the poo themselves because hippo is very dangerous.
00:03:14,00:03:17,"They're the most dangerous of the large mammals in the world, actually, in Africa."
00:03:17,00:03:22,"So they kill estimates seem to vary between 503,000 people in Africa every year."
00:03:22,00:03:24,But so the researchers didn't really want to go near that.
00:03:24,00:03:29,"So they sent in some boats, and they got advice from a mass eye guy who said, ""Disguise"
00:03:29,00:03:31,"your boats as crocodiles."""
00:03:31,00:03:36,"And so they disguised their boats as crocodile heads, which went around collecting data on"
00:03:36,00:03:37,their poo.
00:03:37,00:03:38,That's amazing.
00:03:38,00:03:40,Because they get along quite well hippos and crocodiles.
00:03:40,00:03:41,They do.
00:03:41,00:03:45,"But actually, it's a bit of a relationship that seems a bit skewed towards the hippo in"
00:03:45,00:03:50,that the crocodile just needs to be a bit passive when it comes to a hippo and they're interacting.
00:03:50,00:03:56,"I've seen footage of a baby hippo using the back of a crocodile, basically as a teething"
00:03:56,00:03:57,ring just to...
00:03:57,00:04:00,But they do some of the hippo babies.
00:04:00,00:04:05,It's quite bold for it to be chewing on a crocodile as a ring because they do occasionally
00:04:05,00:04:08,"flip around and swallow a baby, which I imagine doesn't happen with the natural baby's"
00:04:08,00:04:09,teething ring.
00:04:09,00:04:12,So this is very rarely...
00:04:12,00:04:13,Yeah.
00:04:13,00:04:15,You'd have a very strong case.
00:04:15,00:04:16,Yeah.
00:04:16,00:04:20,"There's a few products on Amazon with one star of the year going, ""Hey, my fucking kid."""
00:04:20,00:04:27,"So she brought down toys around, isn't it?"
00:04:27,00:04:32,"But yeah, in this case, it's because the children, obviously, they could take on."
00:04:32,00:04:37,It's when a mother is babysitting near a crocodile and they're watching the biting going on.
00:04:37,00:04:38,So the crocodile has to just put up there?
00:04:38,00:04:41,"Just take it because they're like, ""I don't want to start anything here."""
00:04:41,00:04:45,"I think I read that a hippo can bite a crocodile in two, which doesn't sound plausible,"
00:04:45,00:04:46,"but they're very, very powerful draws."
00:04:46,00:04:47,"They're very strong draws, don't they?"
00:04:47,00:04:49,They're going to easily snap a boat into it if they want to.
00:04:49,00:04:54,"Like, you know, not a cruise ship, but a robot or something."
00:04:54,00:04:58,Just back to the organic matter loading thing.
00:04:58,00:05:03,"So the thing they do, which is really communicative with other hippos, is that they use their tail"
00:05:03,00:05:07,as a propeller and they spray it over a very wide area.
00:05:07,00:05:08,Spray that poo.
00:05:08,00:05:12,They put it over a wide area because their tail is going round and round and round like a propeller.
00:05:12,00:05:13,"Like, it hits in the fan, isn't it?"
00:05:13,00:05:16,It is exactly that.
00:05:16,00:05:17,That's it.
00:05:17,00:05:20,"Yeah, they do seem to spray it around willy-nilly."
00:05:20,00:05:22,"And the use of the flirting, don't they, they're spraying."
00:05:22,00:05:26,"So they both, both sides, both genders float with their feces."
00:05:26,00:05:29,"So the males will mark their territory with this big spray of poo,"
00:05:29,00:05:31,which they can spray a couple of meters with their tail.
00:05:31,00:05:37,"And then the female, if she's impressed, will respond by turning round to face him with her ass,"
00:05:37,00:05:43,"so to not face him, and to, and then she'll do the whizzing, the poo whizzing."
00:05:43,00:05:46,And it's called submissive defecation.
00:05:46,00:05:48,Do you know that hippos can't get cholera?
00:05:48,00:05:52,And they think that one of the reasons is because they throw their poo around so much.
00:05:52,00:05:56,So I surmise if humans start throwing their poo's around.
00:05:56,00:05:59,"Eventually, after thousands of years, and millions of deaths,"
00:05:59,00:06:03,you'll have humans who are covered in poo but can't get cholera.
00:06:03,00:06:06,"Look, no one's saying that it's going to be great to, it's like Brexit."
00:06:06,00:06:11,"No one's saying that it's going to be great to start off with, but eventually."
00:06:11,00:06:14,"The cholera is, well, because it moves the poo far away from them."
00:06:14,00:06:18,"Well, because they have a lot of contacts to the bacteria or whatever it is."
00:06:18,00:06:20,"If they could get cholera, they'd be dead, is that right?"
00:06:20,00:06:22,Right. So they've got some sort of immunity.
00:06:22,00:06:23,Yeah.
00:06:23,00:06:24,OK.
00:06:24,00:06:25,"Because they do eat it as well, don't they?"
00:06:25,00:06:27,"Go on, really."
00:06:27,00:06:29,"Babies eat their mother's feces, because they have that unfortunate thing,"
00:06:29,00:06:33,"which some species have, where babies are born without any functioning intestines."
00:06:33,00:06:36,They don't have any live bacteria in their insides.
00:06:36,00:06:38,The only way they can get that is to eat their mother's poo.
00:06:38,00:06:42,"So as soon as they're born, they've got to start showing down on that."
00:06:42,00:06:46,There is a lot of time.
00:06:46,00:06:51,"We briefly mentioned hippo testicles before, but I found out just a little bit more about them."
00:06:51,00:06:54,So I thought we should return to that wellsprung.
00:06:54,00:06:57,"So there's a great article in Discover Magazine, which is headlined"
00:06:57,00:07:00,why it's nearly impossible to castrate a hippo.
00:07:00,00:07:04,"So the problem, first of all, you're going to get pretty close to it."
00:07:04,00:07:05,That's true.
00:07:05,00:07:08,I can't do that with a remote control crocodile shaped boat.
00:07:08,00:07:11,"Although you won't be able to use the jars, does that?"
00:07:11,00:07:13,Yeah.
00:07:13,00:07:16,"But there are a problem in some places, obviously,"
00:07:16,00:07:17,because they are a bit of a pest.
00:07:17,00:07:19,They're very prolific breeders as well.
00:07:19,00:07:21,So they can produce 25 calves in 40 years.
00:07:21,00:07:24,"So before you know it, you've got loads of hippos."
00:07:24,00:07:28,"So the problem with castration, as a, you know,"
00:07:28,00:07:31,"to spread it across, you know, loads of hippos in a pest area,"
00:07:31,00:07:36,is that their testicles are hidden inside their bodies.
00:07:36,00:07:38,"And there's a paper in the journal Theory of Genology,"
00:07:38,00:07:41,which names all the difficulties in castrating hippos.
00:07:41,00:07:46,"Number one, the penis is apparently discreet."
00:07:46,00:07:47,I've used that excuse.
00:07:47,00:07:51,It's just being polite.
00:07:51,00:07:56,And also the testicles are not in the same place
00:07:56,00:07:58,from one hippo to the next.
00:07:58,00:08:02,So they can vary by up to 16 inches between different animals.
00:08:02,00:08:05,"So if you cut in, trying to remove the hippos' testicles, they're not there."
00:08:05,00:08:11,So a game of pin the testicles on the hippo could lead to a pretty much stick-pin anyway.
00:08:11,00:08:13,"You're correct, yeah."
00:08:13,00:08:16,"But the problem is that they can retract further during surgery,"
00:08:16,00:08:18,"which we've said, they can retract them further into their body,"
00:08:18,00:08:21,they can flee the surgeon's knife.
00:08:21,00:08:23,"And also, it's very hard to anesthetize a hippo."
00:08:23,00:08:25,"I mean, there are so many problems."
00:08:25,00:08:26,"Yeah, just don't do it."
00:08:26,00:08:27,Don't castrate them.
00:08:27,00:08:29,"Although they are a pest, as you say."
00:08:29,00:08:34,"And they are a particular pest, of course, in Colombia, right?"
00:08:34,00:08:37,So this hippo's known for really hanging out in Africa.
00:08:37,00:08:40,But Pablo Escobar in Colombia had this zoo.
00:08:40,00:08:44,"The Pablo Escobar massive Colombian drug lord, obviously, was shot in 1993,"
00:08:44,00:08:47,left behind his massive menagerie of weird animals.
00:08:47,00:08:49,And they got rid of most of them.
00:08:49,00:08:51,"But people didn't notice at the time, I don't think,"
00:08:51,00:08:53,that he had a bunch of hippos living in his lake.
00:08:53,00:08:55,"I mean, you don't notice it."
00:08:55,00:08:56,Didn't spot him. Didn't spot him.
00:08:56,00:08:58,They look like rocks.
00:08:58,00:09:01,"And so, and they've bred."
00:09:01,00:09:05,"And it was, eventually everyone's attention was drawn to this in 2007."
00:09:05,00:09:07,"So he died in 1993, 2007."
00:09:07,00:09:11,"Fisherman started calling the local council, or whatever it is."
00:09:11,00:09:13,And reporting--
00:09:13,00:09:15,My fish tastes a bit like hippo-shit.
00:09:15,00:09:21,Sales have really plummeted.
00:09:21,00:09:23,"No, they're calling up and reporting creatures"
00:09:23,00:09:25,with tiny ears and huge mouths.
00:09:25,00:09:28,"And they genuinely didn't know what they were, these people."
00:09:28,00:09:29,And they were hippos.
00:09:29,00:09:32,And so now there are about 60 of them
00:09:32,00:09:34,that are just living in this tiny area in the rivers and lakes.
00:09:34,00:09:36,"And apparently, you'll be in this nearby town."
00:09:36,00:09:38,And you'll see a hippo just wandering down the road.
00:09:38,00:09:40,"Wow, it's very exciting."
00:09:40,00:09:41,"That's very, very."
00:09:41,00:09:44,We're going to have to move on in a second.
00:09:44,00:09:46,I've found an interesting thing.
00:09:46,00:09:52,The first pharaoh of the United Egypt was killed by a hippo.
00:09:52,00:09:53,"He was called, yeah, King Menors."
00:09:53,00:09:55,"And we only know it from a single line,"
00:09:55,00:09:58,"as far as I can tell, by historian called Manatho,"
00:09:58,00:10:01,"who just simply wrote, Menors was the first king."
00:10:01,00:10:03,He was snatched and killed by hippopotamus.
00:10:03,00:10:03,And nothing else.
00:10:03,00:10:05,We don't know.
00:10:05,00:10:06,We don't know the circumstances.
00:10:06,00:10:08,We don't know what he was doing at the time.
00:10:08,00:10:10,What a legacy.
00:10:10,00:10:13,"We do know what it's like to be swallowed by a hippo,"
00:10:13,00:10:15,or to half swallowed.
00:10:15,00:10:17,Because there was a guy a few years ago
00:10:17,00:10:20,"called Chris Broughton, who was on the Zambezi."
00:10:20,00:10:23,"And basically, he said, before he knew it,"
00:10:23,00:10:25,he was inside a hippo.
00:10:25,00:10:28,"I said, I was aware that my legs were being surrounded by water,"
00:10:28,00:10:30,but my top half was almost dry.
00:10:30,00:10:32,I seem to be trapped in something slimy.
00:10:32,00:10:35,"There was a terrible sulfurous smell, like rotten eggs,"
00:10:35,00:10:37,and a tremendous pressure against my chest.
00:10:37,00:10:40,"My arms were trapped, but I managed to free one"
00:10:40,00:10:43,and felt around my palm pass through the wiery bristles
00:10:43,00:10:45,of the hippo's snout.
00:10:45,00:10:47,"It was only then that I realized I was underwater,"
00:10:47,00:10:49,trapped up to my waist in his mouth.
00:10:49,00:10:50,Wow.
00:10:50,00:10:52,It's not amazing that we know what that's like.
00:10:52,00:10:53,And then he managed to get himself.
00:10:53,00:10:55,He rigged as much as he could.
00:10:55,00:10:57,"He managed to get free, and there were people there"
00:10:57,00:10:58,who could drag him away.
00:10:58,00:10:59,Wow.
00:10:59,00:11:02,So his arm was going up through the hippo's air waves
00:11:02,00:11:03,and out of its nose?
00:11:03,00:11:04,Yeah.
00:11:04,00:11:05,"No, through their mouth."
00:11:05,00:11:07,He had to reach further into the hippo
00:11:07,00:11:10,and then back out through.
00:11:10,00:11:13,"I thought he was coming up through the nose, out of the nose."
00:11:13,00:11:18,He clambered his way out of the ear in the end.
00:11:18,00:11:28,"If God he didn't go through the anus, he would have been propelled."
00:11:28,00:11:33,"OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is Chazinski."
00:11:33,00:11:36,My fact this week is that there are monks in India
00:11:36,00:11:40,who avoid going out in the rain in case they splash through puddles
00:11:40,00:11:42,and upset the microbes in them.
00:11:42,00:11:46,And these are Jane monks and people who follow Janism.
00:11:46,00:11:48,"So you know, Jane's the people who basically don't believe"
00:11:48,00:11:50,in harming any living creature.
00:11:50,00:11:52,And this goes right down to all bacteria
00:11:52,00:11:55,which basically live in everything and on everything.
00:11:55,00:11:56,"And so as soon as the monsoon comes,"
00:11:56,00:11:59,you're not allowed to leave your house if you're Jane
00:11:59,00:12:01,because you might immediately be killing stuff
00:12:01,00:12:04,"because they believe that these tiny creatures,"
00:12:04,00:12:07,"which they called Nagoda, and they believed in hundreds,"
00:12:07,00:12:10,"thousands of years before we even discovered microorganisms,"
00:12:10,00:12:12,they believe that these tiny creatures
00:12:12,00:12:15,"existed sort of everywhere in puddles, in damp environments."
00:12:15,00:12:20,"And if you touch them, then they're going to get upset, even die."
00:12:20,00:12:21,And so they can't go out in the rain.
00:12:21,00:12:23,"And if you hurt them in any way, then you go to hell."
00:12:23,00:12:25,Is that the idea or...?
00:12:25,00:12:27,"You just won't be reincarnated, I don't think,"
00:12:27,00:12:28,as well as you might have.
00:12:28,00:12:31,"It's not as bad as hurting a human, which is a higher being,"
00:12:31,00:12:33,but it's still not ideal.
00:12:33,00:12:37,So these guys are the ones who sweep the streets
00:12:37,00:12:40,"so that they don't stand on any insects and stuff, is that right?"
00:12:40,00:12:43,And they wear masks so they don't inhale them.
00:12:43,00:12:45,They don't go out at night because you men...
00:12:45,00:12:49,"Someone said they don't go out at night because the light's not good enough,"
00:12:49,00:12:51,and so you can't see what you're eating.
00:12:51,00:12:53,"And so you might think you're eating a piece of bread,"
00:12:53,00:12:55,but it could be a bunch of small insects.
00:12:55,00:12:57,Which...
00:12:57,00:12:59,"I'm no gormonde, but..."
00:12:59,00:13:02,I think I can tell the difference.
00:13:02,00:13:06,It's incredibly hard life being a Jane.
00:13:06,00:13:09,"So Jane monks, you know, it's an older sister religion of Buddhism."
00:13:09,00:13:13,"So they're very, very, very keen to avoid the pleasures of the flesh,"
00:13:13,00:13:14,extremely keen.
00:13:14,00:13:16,So Buddhist monks shave their heads.
00:13:16,00:13:20,Jane monks pluck out their hairs one by one in a deliberately painful ceremony.
00:13:20,00:13:22,Buddhist monks beg for their food.
00:13:22,00:13:24,Jane monks are not allowed to beg.
00:13:24,00:13:26,They're not even allowed to beg.
00:13:26,00:13:30,"There's a hand gesture you can make, a bit like they arch their right hand over their shoulder."
00:13:30,00:13:32,Which I think is like this.
00:13:32,00:13:36,"It's kind of like the beginning of ""I'm a little teapot."""
00:13:36,00:13:39,"And that's to show hunger, but they cannot directly ask for food."
00:13:39,00:13:40,"Oh, really?"
00:13:40,00:13:44,"But then if you do that gesture, then people do sometimes give you something, don't they?"
00:13:44,00:13:46,"Yeah, people say that's, oh, he's hungry, yeah."
00:13:46,00:13:50,"Yeah, because there is the thing, there are basically two main variants of Janeism."
00:13:50,00:13:53,"And one is called Digambar, and one is Fettambar."
00:13:53,00:13:56,And the Digambars are the Skyclad or Naked Jains.
00:13:56,00:13:59,And they are not allowed to own any material possessions.
00:13:59,00:14:01,And this is if you really strictly adhere.
00:14:01,00:14:03,So this is the monk and the nuns.
00:14:03,00:14:06,"So they have to be naked all the time, if they're those monks,"
00:14:06,00:14:09,"because you're not allowed to own clothes, because they're material possessions."
00:14:09,00:14:11,"And that causes some... You can have a iPhone, though, can you?"
00:14:11,00:14:13,"Obviously, you can have an iPhone."
00:14:13,00:14:14,Where would you keep it?
00:14:14,00:14:18,It's not going to that.
00:14:18,00:14:20,"Could you rent a Tuxedo, for example?"
00:14:20,00:14:21,Because then you don't own it.
00:14:21,00:14:22,You don't own it. You just rent it?
00:14:22,00:14:23,"Oh, yeah."
00:14:23,00:14:25,But how would you pay for it?
00:14:25,00:14:26,"Good point, no money."
00:14:26,00:14:30,"I don't know if Tuxedo rental existed 3,000 years ago, and they sort of founded it."
00:14:30,00:14:32,So maybe they've updated it.
00:14:32,00:14:34,But those ones can't even own a bowl.
00:14:34,00:14:37,"So they have to ask for water by cupping their hands,"
00:14:37,00:14:39,and then it all slides through their fingers before they can drink it.
00:14:39,00:14:42,"I think they're allowed to drink from God, aren't they?"
00:14:42,00:14:43,"Are they? I think so, yeah."
00:14:43,00:14:46,I think one sector is the other sector.
00:14:46,00:14:47,I believe so. Wow.
00:14:47,00:14:50,"Because the other sector, which are allowed to work clothes,"
00:14:50,00:14:53,"are still only allowed to wear white, aren't they?"
00:14:53,00:14:55,And this thing about how they don't want to hurt any animals.
00:14:55,00:14:59,"This, if you look back in their stories of their history,"
00:14:59,00:15:02,there were 24 Jane Ford makers.
00:15:02,00:15:04,They were the prophets who kind of started the whole thing.
00:15:04,00:15:08,And one of them was so bothered about not harming anything at all
00:15:08,00:15:12,"that before he was born, he floated perfectly still in his mother's womb,"
00:15:12,00:15:15,sending not so much as a ripple throughout the amniotic fluid
00:15:15,00:15:18,to avoid harming his mother.
00:15:18,00:15:19,Wow.
00:15:19,00:15:20,So thoughtful.
00:15:20,00:15:22,They're the epitome of thoughtful.
00:15:22,00:15:24,"They're what we all should strive towards, really."
00:15:24,00:15:27,"And so some of them wear a mask to stop inhaling insects,"
00:15:27,00:15:29,"but there's controversy about the masks,"
00:15:29,00:15:32,because some people say that it's a good thing to wear a mask
00:15:32,00:15:35,because the breath from your mouth is hot.
00:15:35,00:15:37,"And if you don't wear a cloth, you might scorch microscopic beings"
00:15:37,00:15:42,"in the air, kind of like Godzilla."
00:15:42,00:15:44,Kind of. He didn't wear clothes either.
00:15:44,00:15:46,He didn't wear clothes.
00:15:46,00:15:49,"So some people say that if you do wear a cloth,"
00:15:49,00:15:52,"that might be a bad thing, because your breath is moist,"
00:15:52,00:15:56,and that might give rise to microorganisms in the cloth.
00:15:56,00:15:59,And then there will be more living and dying because of you breathing.
00:15:59,00:16:00,So they'll die when you handle it.
00:16:00,00:16:01,So problem.
00:16:01,00:16:03,"It's a tightrope, isn't it, that you've got to walk?"
00:16:03,00:16:05,And it's slightly tougher for women.
00:16:05,00:16:07,"Although I will say, I think they have much more egalitarian views"
00:16:07,00:16:09,than a lot of mainstream religions.
00:16:09,00:16:11,"And generally, they're kind of great."
00:16:11,00:16:12,But they do have this slight thing
00:16:12,00:16:17,"where if you believe in the naked shanism, the sky-clad James,"
00:16:17,00:16:22,"then women can't quite attain proper enlightenment, proper nirvana."
00:16:22,00:16:25,"And that is because women can't be naked,"
00:16:25,00:16:26,"because it's inconvenient for them, apparently."
00:16:26,00:16:28,I don't understand why it's more inconvenient for women
00:16:28,00:16:30,to be naked than for men to be naked.
00:16:30,00:16:32,It seems equally inconvenient.
00:16:32,00:16:35,"But also, so one, women can't be naked, because it's inconvenient."
00:16:35,00:16:39,"And two, women can't be naked, because they are intrinsically harmful."
00:16:39,00:16:46,And this is actually based in the understandable belief
00:16:46,00:16:49,that women's periods kill loads of creatures as they happen.
00:16:49,00:16:51,So as-- and I don't know what it--
00:16:51,00:16:53,I think maybe you think it's just sort of--
00:16:53,00:16:55,I'm noticing that body form advert.
00:16:55,00:16:59,[LAUGHTER]
00:16:59,00:17:00,"Well, that was the idea."
00:17:00,00:17:02,The inspiration was basically the death
00:17:02,00:17:04,"of thousands and thousands of these tiny organisms,"
00:17:04,00:17:06,so you couldn't quite achieve nirvana as a woman.
00:17:06,00:17:09,But you could come still quite close.
00:17:09,00:17:11,I've got a tangential fact about Jainism.
00:17:11,00:17:13,And it's actually to do with a lot of Eastern religions.
00:17:13,00:17:16,So we may have mentioned before that swastikers
00:17:16,00:17:18,"are quite big in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism,"
00:17:18,00:17:19,and they're big in Jainism.
00:17:19,00:17:21,"And I found out in the course of researching this,"
00:17:21,00:17:24,"I didn't know this, in the year 2013."
00:17:24,00:17:25,"And in fact, a few years since then,"
00:17:25,00:17:30,"there was a day called Learn to Love the Swastika,"
00:17:30,00:17:33,which was aiming to rehabilitate the swastika
00:17:33,00:17:35,because it's an ancient symbol.
00:17:35,00:17:36,But it seems to be working.
00:17:36,00:17:39,"You see the lot more of it, these days."
00:17:39,00:17:41,It's going really well.
00:17:41,00:17:43,But to raise awareness of the symbol
00:17:43,00:17:45,"and its history as a peaceful symbol,"
00:17:45,00:17:47,tattoo artists around the world
00:17:47,00:17:49,offered people free swastika tattoos.
00:17:49,00:17:50,It's just true.
00:17:50,00:17:51,This happened.
00:17:51,00:17:53,And there were lots of articles about it.
00:17:53,00:17:56,"And there was a report from La Journal International,"
00:17:56,00:17:58,"which said this, ""When a beamy journalist questioned"
00:17:58,00:18:00,one of the tattooists about the probability
00:18:00,00:18:03,"that neo-nazis might take advantage of the event,"
00:18:03,00:18:05,"the latter answered that even if that was the case,"
00:18:05,00:18:09,"these people will leave with a symbol of love on their body."""
00:18:09,00:18:11,"You've just got to let some things go, don't you?"
00:18:11,00:18:14,I think you've got to leave the swastika behind.
00:18:14,00:18:17,There was a guy in America that I read about years ago
00:18:17,00:18:19,who went through World War II.
00:18:19,00:18:22,"And he lived in, I believe it was Ohio in America,"
00:18:22,00:18:24,whose name was Adolf Hitler.
00:18:24,00:18:26,And he refused to change his name.
00:18:26,00:18:29,"He ended up becoming famous for it, people interviewing him,"
00:18:29,00:18:32,"saying, ""Why have you not changed your name from Adolf Hitler?"""
00:18:32,00:18:36,"And his response was, ""I'm not going to let one guy"
00:18:36,00:18:41,"ruin the good name of Adolf Hitler."""
00:18:41,00:18:46,"Just on mic-- sorry, I thought it was distraction."
00:18:46,00:18:48,Just on microbes.
00:18:48,00:18:50,I was looking up lots of stuff about microbes
00:18:50,00:18:52,because of the puddles and microbes in them.
00:18:52,00:18:55,Did you know the Oregon has an official state microbe?
00:18:56,00:18:58,"No, I didn't know that."
00:18:58,00:19:01,What is it? It's bakers yeast.
00:19:01,00:19:06,"Because it's very important to craft brewers and craft bakers,"
00:19:06,00:19:08,if they exist.
00:19:08,00:19:11,But lots of states have discussed having a state microbe.
00:19:11,00:19:13,"And I think so far, Oregon's the only one which said,"
00:19:13,00:19:15,"""Well, they've got the best one, haven't they?"""
00:19:15,00:19:17,They've got a good one. There are other good ones.
00:19:17,00:19:20,"So Wisconsin proposed in its parliament,"
00:19:20,00:19:23,"Lactococcus Lactis, which is very crucial for cheese production,"
00:19:23,00:19:24,"because you get a lot of cheese in Wisconsin,"
00:19:24,00:19:26,but that didn't get through.
00:19:26,00:19:30,"Hawaii suggested a bacterium, which was found on a native shrub,"
00:19:30,00:19:34,but then there was a rival camp who wanted a different state microbe.
00:19:34,00:19:37,I was a huge argument in the Hawaiian parliament about some people
00:19:37,00:19:39,"said, ""No, we want this one, which lives in a symbiotic relationship"
00:19:39,00:19:41,"with a squid."""
00:19:41,00:19:43,"And all the people-- all the people who wanted the shrub ones said,"
00:19:43,00:19:44,"""Yeah, well, the shrub lives in Hawaii."
00:19:44,00:19:47,"It's a native to Hawaii, and the squid lives everywhere."""
00:19:47,00:19:49,"The squid one is Vibrio fish scary, isn't it?"
00:19:49,00:19:51,I love that microbe. They should definitely have gone with that.
00:19:51,00:19:52,"I know, I know. The other one, actually."
00:19:52,00:19:54,"Oh, here we go again."
00:19:54,00:19:55,"All right, let's take this outside."
00:19:55,00:19:56,The one on the bush.
00:19:56,00:19:57,I like the one on the bush.
00:19:57,00:20:00,Are they going to such a massive route that they scrap the whole thing?
00:20:00,00:20:03,Do we think America hasn't got its priority straight?
00:20:03,00:20:05,Fills that they've got bigger fish to fry.
00:20:05,00:20:07,We're going to have to move on very shortly.
00:20:07,00:20:10,Can I just talk about how you couldn't kill a microbe if you really wanted to?
00:20:10,00:20:11,"Yes, yeah."
00:20:11,00:20:14,"Because the repaying the arse and antibiotics are struggling,"
00:20:14,00:20:17,"and so people have been really looking into how else we can kill microbes,"
00:20:17,00:20:19,and they're quite hard to squash.
00:20:19,00:20:21,"So actually, this is something that James probably have got wrong,"
00:20:21,00:20:25,"because they're so small, obviously, they're like a thousandth of a millimeter"
00:20:25,00:20:29,"that you can't, they'll get into a crevice before you can probably squash them."
00:20:29,00:20:31,"So there's a scientist called Elena Ivanova,"
00:20:31,00:20:35,"and she works in Australia, and she's worked really, really hard to create surfaces"
00:20:35,00:20:40,so smooth that bacteria will just slide off them without being able to hold on.
00:20:40,00:20:44,"But some of them can still cling on, so that's failed."
00:20:44,00:20:47,"And she was really panicking about why I don't know how to kill these microbes,"
00:20:47,00:20:50,but they're still clinging to my society surfaces.
00:20:50,00:20:52,And so she wrote to another scientist and asked if he had any ideas.
00:20:52,00:20:56,"And he said, try the cicada wing, and what an earth."
00:20:56,00:21:01,"But she got a cicada wing, so you know, cicadas, they took a wing off."
00:21:01,00:21:05,"And it turns out that if you put a bacterium onto the wing of a cicada,"
00:21:05,00:21:09,"it gets punctured all over, spills all its guts out, little bacteria guts,"
00:21:09,00:21:13,"and at least to a quick death, and gecko skin is even better."
00:21:13,00:21:17,"It's really hard to kill them, and it's really hard to kill them by stamping."
00:21:17,00:21:21,You can do it if you really put a huge amount of pressure on.
00:21:21,00:21:22,You can't kill them.
00:21:22,00:21:25,"If you press food, there's a process called Pascalization,"
00:21:25,00:21:28,"and if you press food with 87,000 pounds per square inch."
00:21:28,00:21:29,Right.
00:21:29,00:21:32,You just make all the bacteria go pop.
00:21:32,00:21:35,I'm not going into your restaurant.
00:21:35,00:21:40,"We serve extremely flat food, extremely competitive prices."
00:21:40,00:21:41,How heavy is that?
00:21:41,00:21:43,"Sorry? 87,000 pounds."
00:21:43,00:21:44,It's a lot.
00:21:44,00:21:46,It's more than all four of us put together.
00:21:46,00:21:48,"OK, it's a lot more."
00:21:48,00:21:49,"Yeah, by as I imagine."
00:21:49,00:21:51,"But it depends how we arrange it, right?"
00:21:51,00:21:55,"So if I was wearing one stiletto shoe and you all climbed on my shoulders,"
00:21:55,00:22:00,then I think that might be enough concentration of weight.
00:22:00,00:22:02,If we were all hippos.
00:22:02,00:22:03,"And that, yeah."
00:22:03,00:22:05,But it's not a good idea to do it.
00:22:05,00:22:08,"So Science ABC, they looked into it, and they said,"
00:22:08,00:22:11,stomping around your house in a bid to sanitize or sterilize your floor
00:22:11,00:22:13,is a bad idea.
00:22:13,00:22:15,"Honestly, you don't want your family to see you,"
00:22:15,00:22:16,and think you've lost your mind.
00:22:16,00:22:19,[LAUGHTER]
00:22:19,00:22:21,"OK, we need to move on to our next fact."
00:22:21,00:22:23,It is time for fact number three.
00:22:23,00:22:24,And that is my fact.
00:22:24,00:22:28,"My fact this week is that during the Second World War,"
00:22:28,00:22:32,"while American pilots were flying over enemy territory,"
00:22:32,00:22:34,"not only were they shooting at that enemy,"
00:22:34,00:22:39,but they were also often making ice cream at the same time.
00:22:39,00:22:40,How are they doing it?
00:22:40,00:22:42,They weren't just churning it while they were.
00:22:42,00:22:43,"No, exactly."
00:22:43,00:22:45,So this was a big thing during World War II
00:22:45,00:22:47,that I'd never read about before.
00:22:47,00:22:49,Ice cream was massive for the troops.
00:22:49,00:22:51,"It was to help them with calories and sustenance,"
00:22:51,00:22:54,and it was a food that got banned by most other countries.
00:22:54,00:22:57,"Britain, for example, banned ice cream during the war."
00:22:57,00:22:58,"Yeah, as a sustenance thing."
00:22:58,00:23:00,"As a rationing thing, basically, because it's sugar,"
00:23:00,00:23:02,and we don't need to use all that sugar.
00:23:02,00:23:03,"Yeah, exactly."
00:23:03,00:23:07,They suggested a carrot on a stick as an alternative.
00:23:07,00:23:08,That didn't go down.
00:23:08,00:23:09,On a stick?
00:23:09,00:23:10,The carrot is the stick.
00:23:10,00:23:11,Yeah.
00:23:11,00:23:12,What was the point of shoving a stick up a carrot?
00:23:12,00:23:14,So it looks like an ice cream.
00:23:14,00:23:16,"I'm just saying that carrots can be used as a stick,"
00:23:16,00:23:19,because carrots don't melt in the same way that magnums do.
00:23:19,00:23:20,Yeah.
00:23:20,00:23:24,"You would have been court-martialed at this point, mate."
00:23:24,00:23:25,Just stick with the program.
00:23:25,00:23:28,It's a waste of sticks.
00:23:28,00:23:31,Surely we need sticks for the war effect.
00:23:31,00:23:33,Do you know weaponry had come on quite a lot further than that?
00:23:33,00:23:36,That's a lot more.
00:23:36,00:23:39,All in the stick battalion following me.
00:23:39,00:23:42,So what this was is that they were constantly
00:23:42,00:23:45,making ice cream in very creative ways during the war.
00:23:45,00:23:46,And one of the things that they discovered
00:23:46,00:23:48,"is that you could take a sort of drum,"
00:23:48,00:23:50,"put all the ingredients inside of it,"
00:23:50,00:23:52,and attach it to the back of a plane.
00:23:52,00:23:57,"So as you flew over, you were reaching about 30,000 feet up"
00:23:57,00:23:58,"in the air, very cold up there."
00:23:58,00:24:00,So you had the coldness to make it freeze.
00:24:00,00:24:03,"But also, the vibration of the engine, the machine gun"
00:24:03,00:24:06,"going, were churning all the ice cream products around."
00:24:06,00:24:10,So by the time that you'd down some enemy planes
00:24:10,00:24:13,"and landed back on your aircraft in the ocean,"
00:24:13,00:24:15,you could go and have a big scoop of ice cream off
00:24:15,00:24:16,the back of your airplane.
00:24:16,00:24:17,That's so cool.
00:24:17,00:24:20,"There was a guy called Jay Hunter Reinberg,"
00:24:20,00:24:22,"who was one of the first people, maybe the first person"
00:24:22,00:24:23,to do this.
00:24:23,00:24:26,And the first time he put the ice cream too close to his engine
00:24:26,00:24:28,so it couldn't get cold enough.
00:24:28,00:24:29,And so it was a bit like Goopy.
00:24:29,00:24:31,"They still let it, of course."
00:24:31,00:24:37,"But then the second time, he flew 33,000 feet over Palau."
00:24:37,00:24:39,"And so he went high, high enough."
00:24:39,00:24:40,"So it was really, really cold."
00:24:40,00:24:42,"And the good advantage of that is, number one,"
00:24:42,00:24:44,it meant that the ice cream froze.
00:24:44,00:24:46,"But number two, it meant that none of the Japanese aircraft"
00:24:46,00:24:48,"could shoot him, because he was so high."
00:24:48,00:24:49,And so they just kept shooting at him
00:24:49,00:24:51,and the bullets couldn't reach him.
00:24:51,00:24:53,So he was just watching it all going on below him.
00:24:53,00:24:55,- Wow. - Wow.
00:24:55,00:24:55,- Wow.
00:24:55,00:24:59,- I kind of didn't realize how easy ice cream is to make.
00:24:59,00:25:00,I haven't tried it.
00:25:00,00:25:01,I haven't just read about it still.
00:25:01,00:25:03,"So maybe it's not-- - Yeah, it sounds at the moment."
00:25:03,00:25:05,It sounds like you need a plane.
00:25:05,00:25:05,So--
00:25:05,00:25:07,[LAUGHTER]
00:25:07,00:25:10,Imagine if you got your pilot's license just for that.
00:25:10,00:25:12,But you can-- I was reading a--
00:25:12,00:25:15,"there was a thing in the New Yorker by someone who said,"
00:25:15,00:25:17,she went to a friend's house and the friend said for dinner.
00:25:17,00:25:18,"And the friend said, great, who's"
00:25:18,00:25:20,for ice cream for pudding?
00:25:20,00:25:22,"And everyone was like, yeah, great."
00:25:22,00:25:23,And so the friend went away and she came back.
00:25:23,00:25:26,And she had one ziplock bag.
00:25:26,00:25:29,And then another much larger ziplock bag.
00:25:29,00:25:31,"And basically, she filled the small ziplock bag"
00:25:31,00:25:33,with vanilla extract and sugar.
00:25:33,00:25:34,And then she closed that.
00:25:34,00:25:35,"And then inside the larger one, she filled that"
00:25:35,00:25:36,with ice and salt.
00:25:36,00:25:40,"And salt is the crucial ingredient for making ice cream, isn't it?"
00:25:40,00:25:42,And then she shook the bag about a bit.
00:25:42,00:25:43,"Got tired, passed it around the table."
00:25:43,00:25:45,"So it's quite a fun past the past,"
00:25:45,00:25:47,or kind of dinner party experience.
00:25:47,00:25:50,"And by the time it got back around to, that's ice cream."
00:25:50,00:25:53,But it's because ice and salt makes an endothermic reaction.
00:25:53,00:25:56,So it sucks all the heat out of your ziplock bag
00:25:56,00:25:57,with vanilla in it.
00:25:57,00:25:58,This doesn't sound like a great party.
00:25:58,00:25:59,I have to say.
00:25:59,00:26:01,[LAUGHTER]
00:26:01,00:26:04,"So just other things that during World War II,"
00:26:04,00:26:07,they used ice cream for the US Navy.
00:26:07,00:26:10,"So in order to get ice cream to a lot of people,"
00:26:10,00:26:13,they had a lot of the Navy ships that were out and about.
00:26:13,00:26:15,"There was one specific ship, which they"
00:26:15,00:26:18,"spent $1 million converting at the time, which"
00:26:18,00:26:22,was effectively an ocean ice cream factory.
00:26:22,00:26:23,And that's all it did.
00:26:23,00:26:24,It created ice cream.
00:26:24,00:26:27,It could do 10 gallons every seven minutes.
00:26:27,00:26:30,And it would just go to various different Navy ships
00:26:30,00:26:31,and deliver them ice cream.
00:26:31,00:26:32,Yeah.
00:26:32,00:26:33,It's about--
00:26:33,00:26:35,I was just looking at that amount that it could do.
00:26:35,00:26:37,It's the equivalent of doing one Ben and Jerry's
00:26:37,00:26:39,tub every five seconds.
00:26:39,00:26:40,Wow.
00:26:40,00:26:43,Didn't need to only be in extremely rough seas all the time
00:26:43,00:26:44,to turn it up.
00:26:44,00:26:46,"No, because you've got the engine kind of going round"
00:26:46,00:26:48,the propellers and stuff like that.
00:26:48,00:26:49,So it was still powered by the engine.
00:26:49,00:26:49,Yeah.
00:26:49,00:26:51,"And also, the enemy could always hear it coming"
00:26:51,00:26:54,because of the chimes in the back of the air.
00:26:54,00:26:57,"It was a flawed system, yeah."
00:26:57,00:27:00,"But there's reports, apparently, of these ships"
00:27:00,00:27:02,"that when they were attacked by the Japanese,"
00:27:02,00:27:05,"for torpedo hit it, there are a few accounts of sailors"
00:27:05,00:27:07,"before they were abandoning ship and jumping overboard,"
00:27:07,00:27:10,"running to the bit of the ship that had the ice cream,"
00:27:10,00:27:12,"scooping as much as they could into their helmets,"
00:27:12,00:27:15,"eating that, and then jumping off."
00:27:15,00:27:17,So just a quick bowl of ice cream before--
00:27:17,00:27:20,"That was in the USS Lexington, which"
00:27:20,00:27:22,"had a lot of ice cream on board, wasn't it?"
00:27:22,00:27:22,Yes.
00:27:22,00:27:23,Yeah.
00:27:23,00:27:24,"This is-- I should just very quickly say,"
00:27:24,00:27:26,I've gotten a lot of this information
00:27:26,00:27:27,from the Atlantic online.
00:27:27,00:27:28,But the ocean?
00:27:28,00:27:30,Yeah.
00:27:30,00:27:32,I speak to oceans.
00:27:32,00:27:35,"Just on-- you mentioned chimes just now, James."
00:27:35,00:27:37,So there used to be--
00:27:37,00:27:39,"I didn't know this-- in the UK, I believe--"
00:27:39,00:27:41,"250,000 ice cream vans."
00:27:41,00:27:43,"And as I say that, that sounds insane."
00:27:43,00:27:45,"Today, there are a few of them, 2,500."
00:27:45,00:27:49,"And one of the main threats to them is, can you guess?"
00:27:49,00:27:50,The sun.
00:27:50,00:27:52,"Yes, yes."
00:27:52,00:27:54,"I kind of, I guess."
00:27:54,00:27:54,Yeah.
00:27:54,00:27:56,I've got children growing up.
00:27:56,00:27:57,Yeah.
00:27:57,00:27:59,"But more come to replace them, that doesn't make sense."
00:27:59,00:28:00,"Yeah, exactly."
00:28:00,00:28:03,"Is it the health code, people?"
00:28:03,00:28:05,"Yeah, all of these are really good answers."
00:28:05,00:28:08,But there's one thing that you haven't mentioned yet.
00:28:08,00:28:10,Double glazing.
00:28:10,00:28:14,Because you can't hear the chimes if you're double glazed.
00:28:14,00:28:15,Yes.
00:28:15,00:28:18,"In 2017, the head of the trade body, the ice cream association,"
00:28:18,00:28:22,"by the way, awesome, said that new homes are so energy efficient."
00:28:22,00:28:24,"They've got double, sometimes even triple glazing."
00:28:24,00:28:27,And children might not hear a van right outside their house
00:28:27,00:28:28,when it's playing a chimes.
00:28:28,00:28:32,"So they launched an app for smartphones called Vantut,"
00:28:32,00:28:37,which alerts you on your phone with an electronic jingle
00:28:37,00:28:38,if there's an ice cream van nearby.
00:28:38,00:28:40,"No, it's really cool."
00:28:40,00:28:40,That's so cool.
00:28:40,00:28:45,"In the 1980s, in Glasgow, there was an ice cream war"
00:28:45,00:28:48,between two gangs who were selling drugs and stolen goods
00:28:48,00:28:50,from ice cream vans.
00:28:50,00:28:51,Ooh.
00:28:51,00:28:52,Yeah.
00:28:52,00:28:54,So it was really a drugs war.
00:28:54,00:28:57,"No, James said it was done from ice cream vans."
00:28:57,00:29:00,"Well, it was quite serious, actually."
00:29:00,00:29:01,But it was all in the news.
00:29:01,00:29:03,And everyone was having to go at the Strathclyde police
00:29:03,00:29:05,because they weren't solving all these crimes.
00:29:05,00:29:08,"And the local newspapers called the police,"
00:29:08,00:29:10,the Sirius Chimes Squad.
00:29:10,00:29:11,Oh.
00:29:11,00:29:14,They should have called for Magnum PI.
00:29:14,00:29:16,Ah.
00:29:16,00:29:17,Thank you guys.
00:29:17,00:29:18,Very strong.
00:29:18,00:29:25,"So the jingle used to be, before it was playing music,"
00:29:25,00:29:29,"it used to be a man shouting, ""Hokie Pokie."""
00:29:29,00:29:30,Because it's really cool.
00:29:30,00:29:33,"That is the Italian for ""Oh, Chipoke."""
00:29:33,00:29:35,So it's a bastardisation of that.
00:29:35,00:29:39,"And ""Oh, Chipoke"" means, ""Oh, how small."""
00:29:39,00:29:43,I have heard that a few times this time.
00:29:43,00:29:45,Because about 1/10 of Italian immigrants
00:29:45,00:29:48,"in the 1890s were selling ice cream, weren't they?"
00:29:48,00:29:50,"Yeah, I think about 10%."
00:29:50,00:29:51,"Well, about 10% of vendors, and they were basically"
00:29:51,00:29:53,all ice cream vendors.
00:29:53,00:29:54,And so that came about.
00:29:54,00:29:57,But in the 19th century-- so the ice cream was.
00:29:57,00:29:59,It's not the first time it's been associated with a vice.
00:29:59,00:30:01,"Because in the 19th century, ice cream parlors"
00:30:01,00:30:03,became a very big thing.
00:30:03,00:30:04,This is especially in America.
00:30:04,00:30:07,"And it was because women, basically,"
00:30:07,00:30:10,weren't really allowed to go to places on their own.
00:30:10,00:30:11,And I see a chaperone.
00:30:11,00:30:12,And this started becoming more and more
00:30:12,00:30:14,of a thing as a century progressed.
00:30:14,00:30:15,"So you'd turn up to a restaurant and they'd be like,"
00:30:15,00:30:16,where's the chaperone?
00:30:16,00:30:18,And then they'd kick you out.
00:30:18,00:30:21,"And so they sort of came up with ice cream parlors, which"
00:30:21,00:30:24,became a place that women were allowed to hang out by themselves.
00:30:24,00:30:29,And they were called parlors to mimic the homey cozy life
00:30:29,00:30:31,that we ladies desire.
00:30:31,00:30:33,And--
00:30:33,00:30:37,"But they, of course, turned into hotbeds of vice immediately."
00:30:37,00:30:39,So there was all this disapproval because it
00:30:39,00:30:41,"was thought that without formal chaperones,"
00:30:41,00:30:42,women were just turning up and keeping
00:30:42,00:30:46,awful company and going out with really bad men.
00:30:46,00:30:48,And there were rumors about ice cream
00:30:48,00:30:51,drugged with passion-exciting vanilla.
00:30:51,00:30:54,"And lots of-- there was one journalist who wrote,"
00:30:54,00:30:56,"I think, in the New York Times, that he"
00:30:56,00:30:57,went into an ice cream parlor.
00:30:57,00:31:00,And he saw a man and woman deep in conversation
00:31:00,00:31:03,"who were evidently man and wife, though not each others."
00:31:03,00:31:08,It's amazing that vanilla was so--
00:31:08,00:31:11,because that's the shittest of all the flavors these days.
00:31:11,00:31:11,Isn't it?
00:31:11,00:31:13,Very raunchy back then.
00:31:13,00:31:16,"Yeah, I love the hall of a hornetto, please."
00:31:16,00:31:17,You could say.
00:31:17,00:31:18,"Yeah, you could."
00:31:18,00:31:22,"You could, you could."
00:31:22,00:31:23,We're going to have to move on shortly.
00:31:23,00:31:28,"Before Connets, they used to sell ice cream in penny licks."
00:31:28,00:31:29,And these were little-- this was in London.
00:31:29,00:31:32,"They used to sell them in little glasses,"
00:31:32,00:31:33,but they're a little bit bigger.
00:31:33,00:31:36,And they're almost like sundae-- what you put Sundays in.
00:31:36,00:31:38,What they would do is they would give you your penny
00:31:38,00:31:41,"liquor, put ice cream in it, and then you would return it"
00:31:41,00:31:43,"to them, and then they'd give it a quick wipe,"
00:31:43,00:31:46,and then put some more ice cream for the next person
00:31:46,00:31:46,to do it.
00:31:46,00:31:48,"Sometimes not even a wipe, right?"
00:31:48,00:31:49,It was--
00:31:49,00:31:50,That was bad for the bacteria.
00:31:50,00:31:53,"And that is why ice cream cones became quite popular, wasn't it?"
00:31:53,00:31:55,"Yeah, because they were banned in 1899"
00:31:55,00:31:58,because they were causing the spread of tuberculosis.
00:31:58,00:31:59,Right.
00:31:59,00:32:00,But right.
00:32:00,00:32:01,That was bad.
00:32:01,00:32:04,"And then the cone came about, and it was a huge deal."
00:32:04,00:32:07,So this was the 1904 World's Fair that the ice cream cone
00:32:07,00:32:09,was invented.
00:32:09,00:32:12,So there were instances of appearing kind of in a few cookbooks
00:32:12,00:32:14,"in the 19th century, but it was suddenly made popular"
00:32:14,00:32:15,at the World's Fair.
00:32:15,00:32:17,And it was this huge thing in the 1904 World's Fair.
00:32:17,00:32:20,"So if any of you have ever seen Meet Me In St. Louis,"
00:32:20,00:32:22,"and I don't know why, the song is pronounced like that,"
00:32:22,00:32:25,but it was about the World's Fair that was in St. Louis.
00:32:25,00:32:26,And it was a huge deal.
00:32:26,00:32:30,So they had sort of like bears made of prunes at the World's Fair
00:32:30,00:32:31,and what they had.
00:32:31,00:32:35,Just what everyone's always want to say.
00:32:35,00:32:37,What's the point of the bear made of prunes?
00:32:37,00:32:39,Everyone loves a prune.
00:32:39,00:32:40,"Yeah, true."
00:32:40,00:32:41,A bears and exotic thing.
00:32:41,00:32:42,There you go.
00:32:42,00:32:43,I think they did actual snarling.
00:32:43,00:32:47,They had a massive landscape sculptured entirely from butter.
00:32:47,00:32:49,They were showing the new refrigeration technology.
00:32:49,00:32:53,"So they had a milk made, milking a cow,"
00:32:53,00:32:55,but all of it was made of butter.
00:32:55,00:32:57,"And they had Roosevelt on a horse, Teddy Roosevelt,"
00:32:57,00:32:59,"the president at the time, on a horse."
00:32:59,00:33:00,"What was he made of, peaches?"
00:33:00,00:33:00,It's all butter.
00:33:00,00:33:01,It's all butter.
00:33:01,00:33:02,"OK, it's all butter."
00:33:02,00:33:05,"But anyway, sorry, they made the ice cream cone there."
00:33:05,00:33:06,"Because there was ice cream on display,"
00:33:06,00:33:08,and no one had thought of eating it like on the hoof.
00:33:08,00:33:10,And then they realized people wanted to try it.
00:33:10,00:33:15,"And so, near by waffle vendor, curled his waffle round"
00:33:15,00:33:17,"into a cone shape and said, try this."
00:33:17,00:33:19,"And hence, the cone was invented."
00:33:19,00:33:21,But there's this great historian who's really looked into this.
00:33:21,00:33:24,And she's found seven different people
00:33:24,00:33:27,who claim to have invented it at that one fair.
00:33:27,00:33:30,"They're like, so there was a Syrian guy, a Lebanese guy,"
00:33:30,00:33:33,"a Turkish guy, someone from Ohio, all saying they'd done it."
00:33:33,00:33:36,But there was born the ice cream cone.
00:33:36,00:33:38,"Well, it's a simple history of the ice cream."
00:33:38,00:33:43,And you know that it's better to eat ice cream by licking it
00:33:43,00:33:45,than with a spoon.
00:33:45,00:33:45,"So, yeah."
00:33:45,00:33:49,And the reason is that the flavor in ice cream
00:33:49,00:33:52,is released when the fat content comes out of it.
00:33:52,00:33:54,And that comes when it warms up.
00:33:54,00:33:56,"And because your tongue is warmer than a spoon,"
00:33:56,00:33:58,"and it's got a larger surface area,"
00:33:58,00:34:01,"it's better to put it on there, and then it kind of melts"
00:34:01,00:34:03,"and you get the flavor, whereas if you do it with a spoon,"
00:34:03,00:34:04,then it's still cold when it goes in your mouth
00:34:04,00:34:05,"and you don't get all the flavor,"
00:34:05,00:34:07,because you swallow it before you can.
00:34:07,00:34:08,Just a tip.
00:34:08,00:34:09,It's a top tip.
00:34:09,00:34:11,Yeah.
00:34:11,00:34:12,There's a guy who can tell the difference
00:34:12,00:34:20,between 12% and 11.5% pot of fat in ice cream.
00:34:20,00:34:23,He gets invited to a lot of parties.
00:34:23,00:34:25,"He's an official ice cream taste tester,"
00:34:25,00:34:26,and he was called John Harrison.
00:34:26,00:34:28,"He was the ice cream taste tester for dryers,"
00:34:28,00:34:31,"from 1980 to 2010, so for 30 years."
00:34:31,00:34:33,And he had his tongue insured for $1 million.
00:34:33,00:34:36,"In fact, the company had his tongue insured for $1 million."
00:34:36,00:34:37,So they always say this.
00:34:37,00:34:40,We've ensured your tongue for $1 million.
00:34:40,00:34:41,What's the risk?
00:34:41,00:34:45,There isn't a gang of roving tongue thieves.
00:34:45,00:34:48,"It's a very precious tongue, I'd get it if I could."
00:34:48,00:34:49,He would know that.
00:34:49,00:34:52,[LAUGHTER]
00:34:52,00:34:55,No.
00:34:55,00:34:57,"And before you can explain what that means,"
00:34:57,00:35:00,it is time for fact number four.
00:35:05,00:35:08,Our final fact of the evening is James.
00:35:08,00:35:12,"OK, my back this week is that in 1997,"
00:35:12,00:35:15,a town in Saskatchewan held a referendum
00:35:15,00:35:17,on whether the end of a toilet paper
00:35:17,00:35:21,should hang under or over the roll.
00:35:21,00:35:23,"And luckily, that was the last time anyone ever"
00:35:23,00:35:26,asked a stupid question by means of a referendum ever again.
00:35:26,00:35:29,[LAUGHTER]
00:35:29,00:35:32,"So this was a local election in Saskatoon, which"
00:35:32,00:35:35,"in Saskatchewan, and they were trying out new voting machines,"
00:35:35,00:35:36,basically.
00:35:36,00:35:39,"And so what they wanted to do was have a trial question,"
00:35:39,00:35:41,which was nothing to do with any kind of politics
00:35:41,00:35:44,and wouldn't get people riled up.
00:35:44,00:35:47,"And so they said, what do you think"
00:35:47,00:35:50,should be the official town microbe?
00:35:50,00:35:53,"The question was, are you in favor of toilet paper"
00:35:53,00:35:55,in all public washrooms being installed
00:35:55,00:35:59,with the loose end coming up and over the front of the roll?
00:35:59,00:36:02,And the answer was 80% over.
00:36:02,00:36:04,"OK, and so they said they didn't want it to be political."
00:36:04,00:36:07,"Oh, we've got a few over fans in here."
00:36:07,00:36:08,"Oh, OK."
00:36:08,00:36:09,That was definitely 52%.
00:36:09,00:36:11,"In Sunderland, they feel completely the other way about it,"
00:36:11,00:36:13,all right?
00:36:13,00:36:16,"But yeah, one teenager did a science project about it"
00:36:16,00:36:19,and did a survey and found that liberals usually
00:36:19,00:36:22,go for over while conservatives usually go for unforeseen.
00:36:22,00:36:23,Really?
00:36:23,00:36:26,"Actually, it was quite political after all."
00:36:26,00:36:30,"And was it enacted, as in did all public washrooms"
00:36:30,00:36:35,follow the overwhelming mandate of--
00:36:35,00:36:38,"I think it became the rule, but I'm sure there isn't a person"
00:36:38,00:36:41,who goes around checking them all.
00:36:41,00:36:42,So it wasn't legally binding.
00:36:42,00:36:45,[LAUGHTER]
00:36:45,00:36:47,"It might be for me to criticize the people's choice,"
00:36:47,00:36:50,but I think they got that absolutely wrong.
00:36:50,00:36:52,"Oh, really?"
00:36:52,00:36:53,"The toilet roll thing, that's insane."
00:36:53,00:36:56,"And there's no wonder liberals go for over the top,"
00:36:56,00:36:57,"because over the top, waste so much more"
00:36:57,00:36:59,"rule, because it easily gets--"
00:36:59,00:37:01,Don't waste more?
00:37:01,00:37:02,"Yeah, it absolutely does."
00:37:02,00:37:02,It just waste more.
00:37:02,00:37:05,"It falls down more easily, especially if you've got a cat."
00:37:05,00:37:06,It's not cascading down.
00:37:06,00:37:07,"Oh, yeah."
00:37:07,00:37:10,"Like, no, if you've got a character, you have a cat."
00:37:10,00:37:12,You've got a cat or if you get home drunk.
00:37:12,00:37:13,"You're not one of those guys, guys."
00:37:13,00:37:15,So what was the moment that no such thing
00:37:15,00:37:16,as a fish really ended?
00:37:16,00:37:19,[LAUGHTER]
00:37:19,00:37:20,Wow.
00:37:20,00:37:21,Wow.
00:37:21,00:37:23,I feel tense.
00:37:23,00:37:25,Some more referendums that have happened.
00:37:25,00:37:25,"Oh, yeah."
00:37:25,00:37:29,"So since that will work, sell that."
00:37:29,00:37:30,"No, but it's really interesting."
00:37:30,00:37:32,So lots of-- America is really big on this.
00:37:32,00:37:35,"So in the USA, they have extra referendums"
00:37:35,00:37:37,kind of attached to votes that they're having.
00:37:37,00:37:39,"So you might have a state or a national election,"
00:37:39,00:37:41,"and you'll just depend a few extra votes,"
00:37:41,00:37:42,"which are yes, no, things normally."
00:37:42,00:37:44,So and some of them are quite fun.
00:37:44,00:37:49,"So in 2006, Arizona voted on whether to give a million dollars"
00:37:49,00:37:53,to a single resident chosen by lottery simply for voting
00:37:53,00:37:54,to encourage turnout.
00:37:54,00:37:56,"Yes, and I guess we get a million dollars."
00:37:56,00:37:58,"It was called the Arizona Voter Reward Act,"
00:37:58,00:37:59,and they rejected it.
00:37:59,00:38:00,Classic.
00:38:00,00:38:01,"Oh, really?"
00:38:01,00:38:01,Yeah.
00:38:01,00:38:02,Classic human.
00:38:02,00:38:04,"They think, what if it's not me?"
00:38:04,00:38:07,[LAUGHTER]
00:38:07,00:38:10,"There was a great one, which was in Castlewood, Virginia."
00:38:10,00:38:12,And this was in 1997.
00:38:12,00:38:16,"And the question for the vote was, should we exist?"
00:38:16,00:38:17,And school.
00:38:17,00:38:18,Yeah.
00:38:18,00:38:22,And they decided they shouldn't.
00:38:22,00:38:24,And they no longer do.
00:38:24,00:38:26,What are you talking about?
00:38:26,00:38:28,"Well, I think it was quite a tiny community"
00:38:28,00:38:29,"that was right next to a bigger community,"
00:38:29,00:38:32,but it came with a lot of extra taxes off the back of existing.
00:38:32,00:38:34,"So they said, let's not exist."
00:38:34,00:38:37,So they abolished themselves and became part of Russell County.
00:38:37,00:38:37,Yes.
00:38:37,00:38:40,But they had literally only existed for a couple of years.
00:38:40,00:38:43,"They'd signed this big petition saying, we want to exist."
00:38:43,00:38:44,We want to exist.
00:38:44,00:38:45,We want autonomy.
00:38:45,00:38:46,We want a government.
00:38:46,00:38:47,Great.
00:38:47,00:38:47,Let's do it.
00:38:47,00:38:49,"So they bloody did it, and then straight away."
00:38:49,00:38:50,"They were like, taxes."
00:38:50,00:38:52,"What do you talk about, fuck off?"
00:38:52,00:38:53,[LAUGHTER]
00:38:53,00:38:56,"Literally, immediately, the second administration"
00:38:56,00:38:59,"they put in power was this mayor called Roy Castle,"
00:38:59,00:39:02,whose whole platform was to abolish their existence.
00:39:02,00:39:03,Wow.
00:39:03,00:39:04,Wow.
00:39:04,00:39:05,So people are able to change their minds
00:39:05,00:39:08,and have another vote a bit later if they feel like that.
00:39:08,00:39:09,I do.
00:39:09,00:39:10,I do.
00:39:10,00:39:13,[APPLAUSE]
00:39:13,00:39:15,"Shuttle, very subtle."
00:39:15,00:39:16,"By the way, this show isn't going out"
00:39:16,00:39:18,"for about three more months, so fuck does it."
00:39:18,00:39:19,"Oh, fine."
00:39:19,00:39:20,Yeah.
00:39:20,00:39:22,"You'll be able to trade this for food,"
00:39:22,00:39:23,this episode of the podcast.
00:39:23,00:39:26,[LAUGHTER]
00:39:26,00:39:28,You'll be all sitting around your carrot sticks at home.
00:39:28,00:39:32,[LAUGHTER]
00:39:32,00:39:33,It's on a stick.
00:39:33,00:39:33,It's on a stick.
00:39:33,00:39:34,It's on a stick.
00:39:34,00:39:36,"I mean, you can make carrot intersticks."
00:39:36,00:39:38,That's the weird thing.
00:39:38,00:39:41,Just some other good referendums.
00:39:41,00:39:43,"In 1993, San Francisco had a referendum,"
00:39:43,00:39:45,and it was on whether one specific policeman could
00:39:45,00:39:48,patrol with a ventriloquist dummy.
00:39:48,00:39:51,And they got pretty into this.
00:39:51,00:39:54,"So this is this great guy called Bob Geary,"
00:39:54,00:39:56,"who was a community policeman, and he"
00:39:56,00:40:00,was given the remit to make policing more creative and ingenious.
00:40:00,00:40:02,And he did that by spending a lot of money
00:40:02,00:40:06,on a big wooden ventriloquist dummy and going about.
00:40:06,00:40:08,And he probably learned how to do it.
00:40:08,00:40:08,He got all these tapes.
00:40:08,00:40:10,He practiced in front of the mirror.
00:40:10,00:40:13,"And he called it, and he called it Brendan O'Smarty,"
00:40:13,00:40:15,as sort of like a flip on the idea of a dummy.
00:40:15,00:40:18,"And he dressed it up in police uniform with a water pistol,"
00:40:18,00:40:19,patroled the streets.
00:40:19,00:40:21,"And then eventually, the person in charge of police"
00:40:21,00:40:24,complained and said he had to leave it in the car.
00:40:24,00:40:27,And so he got enough signatures for a referendum.
00:40:27,00:40:28,And it happened.
00:40:28,00:40:30,"And bizarrely, the result--"
00:40:30,00:40:33,"I find so unfathomable, the result of the referendum"
00:40:33,00:40:37,was just 51% to 49% in favor.
00:40:37,00:40:40,Who were the 49% voting against a policeman having a dummy?
00:40:40,00:40:43,"I reckon it's probably the other policeman who,"
00:40:43,00:40:45,when they call for backup and Brendan O'Smarty walks out.
00:40:45,00:40:52,With his water pistol.
00:40:52,00:40:54,"Hello, there's a very, very, very small fire"
00:40:54,00:40:55,that needs putting out.
00:40:55,00:40:57,He said Brendan.
00:40:57,00:41:01,"He cost $1,700, which in 1993 was not nothing."
00:41:01,00:41:05,"He already owns it, so he doesn't need to buy a new one, does he?"
00:41:05,00:41:06,I guess not.
00:41:06,00:41:06,No.
00:41:06,00:41:07,Still.
00:41:07,00:41:11,I'm part of the 49% saying no to officer explanation.
00:41:11,00:41:12,"It was to entertain children, wasn't it?"
00:41:12,00:41:13,"Oh, yeah."
00:41:13,00:41:15,"To entertain people, I think."
00:41:15,00:41:18,And he did manage to apprehend criminals with it.
00:41:18,00:41:19,"No, it was dog."
00:41:19,00:41:21,"Apparently, there was more than one suspect"
00:41:21,00:41:24,that he took down with the dummy in one hand
00:41:24,00:41:25,and the suspect in the other hand.
00:41:25,00:41:26,Are you kidding?
00:41:26,00:41:26,No.
00:41:26,00:41:31,Did he do a good cop bad cop with the dummy?
00:41:31,00:41:32,"Look, I managed to hold him off you,"
00:41:32,00:41:34,but I can only restrain him for so long.
00:41:34,00:41:37,[LAUGHTER]
00:41:37,00:41:40,Let me out of-- let me out.
00:41:40,00:41:43,"I'm going to-- he's going to shout, let me out of-- let me out of--"
00:41:43,00:41:45,"well, I'm drinking a glass of water now."
00:41:45,00:41:49,[LAUGHTER]
00:41:49,00:41:53,There was another just speaking of entertainers in Sao Paulo.
00:41:53,00:41:56,"There was a Brazilian clown who was called Tirerica,"
00:41:56,00:41:58,who won an election.
00:41:58,00:42:01,And he was going for a federal deputy.
00:42:01,00:42:02,And this was in 2010.
00:42:02,00:42:06,"He-- it was a question as well, which was, does anyone really"
00:42:06,00:42:08,want to know what happens behind government doors?
00:42:08,00:42:09,That was simply it.
00:42:09,00:42:11,"And everyone went, yes, someone's going to tell us the truth."
00:42:11,00:42:14,"And it won him the election, but he was a clown."
00:42:14,00:42:16,And did he reveal-- did he--
00:42:16,00:42:17,I should have read the rest of the article earlier.
00:42:17,00:42:20,[LAUGHTER]
00:42:20,00:42:23,Can I talk about House of Lords votes?
00:42:23,00:42:25,Because they're quite weird.
00:42:25,00:42:28,"So first of all, so that Lords aren't allowed to vote"
00:42:28,00:42:31,"for MPs, which is fair enough."
00:42:31,00:42:33,There was actually quite a good article
00:42:33,00:42:36,looking at funny voting comments over the years.
00:42:36,00:42:39,"And apparently, in 1948, then someone"
00:42:39,00:42:43,in America said that he got in touch with the House of Commons.
00:42:43,00:42:45,Because he was interested in the qualifications
00:42:45,00:42:47,for voting in England.
00:42:47,00:42:49,So he called the reference library in the House of Commons.
00:42:49,00:42:52,And he received the following pronouncement.
00:42:52,00:42:54,"In Great Britain, any adult 21 years"
00:42:54,00:42:58,or over may register and vote except peers and lunatics.
00:42:58,00:43:00,And we make an exception for the latter
00:43:00,00:43:03,if they have a moment of lucidity.
00:43:03,00:43:07,And that bombup was in 2016.
00:43:07,00:43:09,"Well, they can't vote for MPs."
00:43:09,00:43:10,But they do have their own elections.
00:43:10,00:43:12,And they're often quite weird.
00:43:12,00:43:14,"So in 2016, there was a by-election in the House of Lords."
00:43:14,00:43:17,It was to replace a Lib Dem peer called Eric Lubbock.
00:43:17,00:43:21,It was actually a very cool guy who wanted to leave his body
00:43:21,00:43:23,to bathe his dog's home to bury their diet.
00:43:23,00:43:24,But that's--
00:43:24,00:43:26,[LAUGHTER]
00:43:26,00:43:28,"Besides the point, anyway, he died."
00:43:28,00:43:30,So someone had to replace him.
00:43:30,00:43:33,And the only people who qualified to vote to replace him
00:43:33,00:43:35,"are the other Lib Dem hereditary peers,"
00:43:35,00:43:37,of which there were three.
00:43:37,00:43:38,And there were seven candidates.
00:43:38,00:43:42,So they had a proper election where three people voted
00:43:42,00:43:44,for seven candidates.
00:43:44,00:43:45,Wow.
00:43:45,00:43:47,I think the only election where there are more candidates
00:43:47,00:43:48,than voters.
00:43:48,00:43:49,That was really good.
00:43:49,00:43:53,"There was, in 1862, there was a referendum in Greece"
00:43:53,00:43:55,because the people overthrew King Otto
00:43:55,00:43:57,and decided to hold a referendum to decide who
00:43:57,00:43:58,would take his place.
00:43:58,00:44:01,"There were 240,000 votes counted."
00:44:01,00:44:05,And the winner was a guy who got six of them.
00:44:05,00:44:09,And that's because the Greeks voted 95% for Prince Alfred
00:44:09,00:44:12,"who was British, but Britain, France, and Russia"
00:44:12,00:44:15,had signed a treaty saying that no person from any of those countries
00:44:15,00:44:17,was allowed to take over.
00:44:17,00:44:21,"OK, so the guy who got six votes was William of Denmark,"
00:44:21,00:44:25,who took over on Julie Raid for 50 years.
00:44:25,00:44:28,Did he say how many votes the first guy got Alfred?
00:44:28,00:44:31,"He got 95% of 240,000, so I'm sure you can work that out."
00:44:31,00:44:33,Yeah.
00:44:33,00:44:37,There were 93 people who voted for having a republic
00:44:37,00:44:38,rather than any King at all.
00:44:38,00:44:43,And there was one vote to bring back King Otto.
00:44:43,00:44:46,I wonder who that was from.
00:44:46,00:44:47,We're going to have to wrap up in a sec.
00:44:47,00:44:50,"Oh, I've got one last fact about presidential elections,"
00:44:50,00:44:52,which is just not really on referendum's.
00:44:52,00:44:54,But this was sent in by someone in the audience tonight.
00:44:54,00:44:56,Someone called Charlie Guinness.
00:44:56,00:44:57,Genness?
00:44:57,00:44:59,"Oh, yeah."
00:44:59,00:45:00,And it's this.
00:45:00,00:45:04,"Is that, in the 1948 US presidential election,"
00:45:04,00:45:07,"the Democrats commissioned a Papier Mache Donke,"
00:45:07,00:45:09,which was designed to have smoke belching from its nostrils
00:45:09,00:45:12,to make it look impressive and intimidating.
00:45:12,00:45:15,"Unfortunately, all the smoke came out of its back end, instead."
00:45:15,00:45:18,[LAUGHTER]
00:45:18,00:45:19,Amazing.
00:45:19,00:45:22,That's a good fact.
00:45:22,00:45:23,"OK, that is it."
