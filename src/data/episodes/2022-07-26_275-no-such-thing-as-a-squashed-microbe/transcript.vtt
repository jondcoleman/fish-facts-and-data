00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.560
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish" a weekly podcast

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.560
 this week coming to you live from Oxford!

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:29.000
 [ Cheers and applause ]

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.240
 My name is Dan Schreiber, and I am sitting here with Anna Chazinski, Andrew Huntson Murray,

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:40.120
 and James Harkin, and once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.640
 facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.640
 Starting with you, Andy.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:56.400
 My fact is, that hippos sometimes poo into rivers so much that all the fish downstream die.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.600
 This is such cool science.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.360
 What if you're a fish?

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:02.360
 Yeah.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.360
 What if you're a fish?

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.360
 This is a horror story if you're a fish?

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.360
 Yes, true.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.800
 So, quick shout out to the scientists who did this, the team who did this was scientist Chris

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.240
 Dustin and Amanda Subulloski, and the hippos poo a lot into rivers.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.280
 Basically, pooing is one of the main things that hippos do, and they do it for, you know,

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:24.280
 all sorts of purposes, communication, and mostly to get it out of their bodies, mostly for

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:32.680
 pooing purposes, but is technically called organic matter loading, if one I call it, surely it's

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:33.680
 unloading.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.960
 Depends what, if you're loading the river?

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:37.960
 I guess.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:38.960
 Oh, yes.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:39.960
 No, I don't know.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:40.960
 No, you're right.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:41.960
 You're right.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.960
 Well, I'm not sure I am.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.240
 But, so they eat a lot of grass, and they eat it at night because it's cooler when they're

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.700
 out of the river feeding, and in the daytime, they wallow in the river to stay cool.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.620
 So this was on a river called the Mara between Kenya and Tanzania.

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:03.580
 There are 4,000 hippos living in this river, and these hippos deposit 8,500 kilos of waste

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:09.460
 every day into quite a short section of river, and it turns into this huge sludge at the

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.820
 bottom of the river, and then in the dry season, the river shrinks and dries up a bit.

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:19.300
 But then when it rains, this massive tidal wave of hippo poo gets churned up, and all

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.820
 of this sludge gets washed down, and it doesn't have much oxygen in it because of all

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.740
 the bacteria, which have been consuming the poo.

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.780
 So the oxygen levels in the water plummet, all the fish die.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.180
 So it's bad news if you're a fish, but it's good news if you're something that eats fish,

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.620
 and don't mind a little bit of pooey aftertaste.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:37.620
 Yeah.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.660
 You're definitely sending that back, if you're at a restaurant.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:41.980
 The fish looks great.

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.100
 It's just the hippo shit all over at this.

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:51.300
 So things like stalks, fultches, crocodiles, hyenas, but they eat these fish really quickly

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.620
 once they die off.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.180
 And actually, the researcher says if you weren't there to see it, you wouldn't know it's happening

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.900
 because it happens so quickly that they come and eat all this stuff.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:00.900
 Wow.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.580
 It's a really good way of the nutrition cycle almost happening through the ecosystem.

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:06.580
 Yeah.

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.100
 The researchers who did this, it was in Kenya, wasn't it?

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.180
 And they couldn't do it themselves.

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.260
 They couldn't go and analyze the poo themselves because hippo is very dangerous.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.940
 They're the most dangerous of the large mammals in the world, actually, in Africa.

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.660
 So they kill estimates seem to vary between 503,000 people in Africa every year.

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.980
 But so the researchers didn't really want to go near that.

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.860
 So they sent in some boats, and they got advice from a mass eye guy who said, "Disguise

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.620
 your boats as crocodiles."

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.100
 And so they disguised their boats as crocodile heads, which went around collecting data on

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.100
 their poo.

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:38.100
 That's amazing.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.140
 Because they get along quite well hippos and crocodiles.

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.140
 They do.

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.740
 But actually, it's a bit of a relationship that seems a bit skewed towards the hippo in

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:50.460
 that the crocodile just needs to be a bit passive when it comes to a hippo and they're interacting.

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:56.700
 I've seen footage of a baby hippo using the back of a crocodile, basically as a teething

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:57.940
 ring just to...

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.300
 But they do some of the hippo babies.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:05.780
 It's quite bold for it to be chewing on a crocodile as a ring because they do occasionally

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.740
 flip around and swallow a baby, which I imagine doesn't happen with the natural baby's

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:09.740
 teething ring.

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.220
 So this is very rarely...

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:13.220
 Yeah.

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.220
 You'd have a very strong case.

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:16.220
 Yeah.

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.220
 There's a few products on Amazon with one star of the year going, "Hey, my fucking kid."

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:27.140
 So she brought down toys around, isn't it?

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:32.220
 But yeah, in this case, it's because the children, obviously, they could take on.

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:37.220
 It's when a mother is babysitting near a crocodile and they're watching the biting going on.

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:38.780
 So the crocodile has to just put up there?

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.020
 Just take it because they're like, "I don't want to start anything here."

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.180
 I think I read that a hippo can bite a crocodile in two, which doesn't sound plausible,

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.660
 but they're very, very powerful draws.

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:47.660
 They're very strong draws, don't they?

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.980
 They're going to easily snap a boat into it if they want to.

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:54.180
 Like, you know, not a cruise ship, but a robot or something.

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.300
 Just back to the organic matter loading thing.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:03.700
 So the thing they do, which is really communicative with other hippos, is that they use their tail

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.700
 as a propeller and they spray it over a very wide area.

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:08.700
 Spray that poo.

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.300
 They put it over a wide area because their tail is going round and round and round like a propeller.

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:13.940
 Like, it hits in the fan, isn't it?

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.300
 It is exactly that.

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:17.300
 That's it.

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.060
 Yeah, they do seem to spray it around willy-nilly.

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.260
 And the use of the flirting, don't they, they're spraying.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:26.100
 So they both, both sides, both genders float with their feces.

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.540
 So the males will mark their territory with this big spray of poo,

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:31.900
 which they can spray a couple of meters with their tail.

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:37.420
 And then the female, if she's impressed, will respond by turning round to face him with her ass,

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:43.100
 so to not face him, and to, and then she'll do the whizzing, the poo whizzing.

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.700
 And it's called submissive defecation.

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.860
 Do you know that hippos can't get cholera?

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:52.700
 And they think that one of the reasons is because they throw their poo around so much.

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:56.140
 So I surmise if humans start throwing their poo's around.

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:59.780
 Eventually, after thousands of years, and millions of deaths,

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:03.380
 you'll have humans who are covered in poo but can't get cholera.

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.180
 Look, no one's saying that it's going to be great to, it's like Brexit.

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:11.380
 No one's saying that it's going to be great to start off with, but eventually.

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:14.380
 The cholera is, well, because it moves the poo far away from them.

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:18.340
 Well, because they have a lot of contacts to the bacteria or whatever it is.

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:20.380
 If they could get cholera, they'd be dead, is that right?

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.620
 Right. So they've got some sort of immunity.

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:23.140
 Yeah.

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:24.140
 OK.

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:25.780
 Because they do eat it as well, don't they?

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:27.260
 Go on, really.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.820
 Babies eat their mother's feces, because they have that unfortunate thing,

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:33.540
 which some species have, where babies are born without any functioning intestines.

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:36.260
 They don't have any live bacteria in their insides.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.500
 The only way they can get that is to eat their mother's poo.

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:42.500
 So as soon as they're born, they've got to start showing down on that.

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.500
 There is a lot of time.

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:51.340
 We briefly mentioned hippo testicles before, but I found out just a little bit more about them.

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:54.740
 So I thought we should return to that wellsprung.

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:57.780
 So there's a great article in Discover Magazine, which is headlined

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:00.620
 why it's nearly impossible to castrate a hippo.

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:04.300
 So the problem, first of all, you're going to get pretty close to it.

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:05.300
 That's true.

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:08.820
 I can't do that with a remote control crocodile shaped boat.

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:11.980
 Although you won't be able to use the jars, does that?

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:13.460
 Yeah.

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:16.020
 But there are a problem in some places, obviously,

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:17.940
 because they are a bit of a pest.

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:19.420
 They're very prolific breeders as well.

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:21.780
 So they can produce 25 calves in 40 years.

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:24.740
 So before you know it, you've got loads of hippos.

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:28.580
 So the problem with castration, as a, you know,

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:31.860
 to spread it across, you know, loads of hippos in a pest area,

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:36.020
 is that their testicles are hidden inside their bodies.

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:38.820
 And there's a paper in the journal Theory of Genology,

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:41.940
 which names all the difficulties in castrating hippos.

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:46.460
 Number one, the penis is apparently discreet.

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:47.500
 I've used that excuse.

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:51.660
 It's just being polite.

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:56.580
 And also the testicles are not in the same place

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:58.220
 from one hippo to the next.

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:02.180
 So they can vary by up to 16 inches between different animals.

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:05.500
 So if you cut in, trying to remove the hippos' testicles, they're not there.

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:11.020
 So a game of pin the testicles on the hippo could lead to a pretty much stick-pin anyway.

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:13.180
 You're correct, yeah.

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:16.220
 But the problem is that they can retract further during surgery,

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:18.460
 which we've said, they can retract them further into their body,

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:21.980
 they can flee the surgeon's knife.

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:23.980
 And also, it's very hard to anesthetize a hippo.

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:25.100
 I mean, there are so many problems.

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:26.460
 Yeah, just don't do it.

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:27.580
 Don't castrate them.

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:29.820
 Although they are a pest, as you say.

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:34.300
 And they are a particular pest, of course, in Colombia, right?

00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:37.420
 So this hippo's known for really hanging out in Africa.

00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:40.020
 But Pablo Escobar in Colombia had this zoo.

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:44.220
 The Pablo Escobar massive Colombian drug lord, obviously, was shot in 1993,

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:47.860
 left behind his massive menagerie of weird animals.

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:49.500
 And they got rid of most of them.

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:51.220
 But people didn't notice at the time, I don't think,

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:53.980
 that he had a bunch of hippos living in his lake.

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:55.500
 I mean, you don't notice it.

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:56.780
 Didn't spot him. Didn't spot him.

00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:58.020
 They look like rocks.

00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:01.620
 And so, and they've bred.

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:05.500
 And it was, eventually everyone's attention was drawn to this in 2007.

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:07.900
 So he died in 1993, 2007.

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:11.980
 Fisherman started calling the local council, or whatever it is.

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:13.060
 And reporting--

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:15.100
 My fish tastes a bit like hippo-shit.

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:21.460
 Sales have really plummeted.

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:23.500
 No, they're calling up and reporting creatures

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:25.940
 with tiny ears and huge mouths.

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:28.340
 And they genuinely didn't know what they were, these people.

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:29.420
 And they were hippos.

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:32.020
 And so now there are about 60 of them

00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:34.300
 that are just living in this tiny area in the rivers and lakes.

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:36.260
 And apparently, you'll be in this nearby town.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.900
 And you'll see a hippo just wandering down the road.

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:40.900
 Wow, it's very exciting.

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:41.740
 That's very, very.

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:44.580
 We're going to have to move on in a second.

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:46.100
 I've found an interesting thing.

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:52.380
 The first pharaoh of the United Egypt was killed by a hippo.

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:53.900
 He was called, yeah, King Menors.

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:55.900
 And we only know it from a single line,

00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:58.460
 as far as I can tell, by historian called Manatho,

00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:01.020
 who just simply wrote, Menors was the first king.

00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:03.100
 He was snatched and killed by hippopotamus.

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:03.900
 And nothing else.

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:05.340
 We don't know.

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:06.700
 We don't know the circumstances.

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:08.860
 We don't know what he was doing at the time.

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:10.380
 What a legacy.

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:13.420
 We do know what it's like to be swallowed by a hippo,

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:15.740
 or to half swallowed.

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:17.020
 Because there was a guy a few years ago

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:20.420
 called Chris Broughton, who was on the Zambezi.

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:23.220
 And basically, he said, before he knew it,

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:25.300
 he was inside a hippo.

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:28.180
 I said, I was aware that my legs were being surrounded by water,

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:30.300
 but my top half was almost dry.

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:32.780
 I seem to be trapped in something slimy.

00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:35.740
 There was a terrible sulfurous smell, like rotten eggs,

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:37.980
 and a tremendous pressure against my chest.

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:40.380
 My arms were trapped, but I managed to free one

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:43.540
 and felt around my palm pass through the wiery bristles

00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:45.020
 of the hippo's snout.

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:47.420
 It was only then that I realized I was underwater,

00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:49.740
 trapped up to my waist in his mouth.

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:50.740
 Wow.

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:52.540
 It's not amazing that we know what that's like.

00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:53.780
 And then he managed to get himself.

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:55.020
 He rigged as much as he could.

00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:57.420
 He managed to get free, and there were people there

00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:58.420
 who could drag him away.

00:10:58.420 --> 00:10:59.260
 Wow.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.260
 So his arm was going up through the hippo's air waves

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:03.500
 and out of its nose?

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:04.020
 Yeah.

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:05.260
 No, through their mouth.

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.300
 He had to reach further into the hippo

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:10.740
 and then back out through.

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:13.860
 I thought he was coming up through the nose, out of the nose.

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:18.180
 He clambered his way out of the ear in the end.

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:28.740
 If God he didn't go through the anus, he would have been propelled.

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:33.820
 OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is Chazinski.

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:36.460
 My fact this week is that there are monks in India

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:40.620
 who avoid going out in the rain in case they splash through puddles

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:42.900
 and upset the microbes in them.

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:46.540
 And these are Jane monks and people who follow Janism.

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:48.460
 So you know, Jane's the people who basically don't believe

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:50.420
 in harming any living creature.

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:52.700
 And this goes right down to all bacteria

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:55.140
 which basically live in everything and on everything.

00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:56.820
 And so as soon as the monsoon comes,

00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:59.620
 you're not allowed to leave your house if you're Jane

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:01.700
 because you might immediately be killing stuff

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:04.220
 because they believe that these tiny creatures,

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:07.700
 which they called Nagoda, and they believed in hundreds,

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:10.900
 thousands of years before we even discovered microorganisms,

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:12.500
 they believe that these tiny creatures

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:15.900
 existed sort of everywhere in puddles, in damp environments.

00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:20.060
 And if you touch them, then they're going to get upset, even die.

00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:21.180
 And so they can't go out in the rain.

00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:23.780
 And if you hurt them in any way, then you go to hell.

00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:25.180
 Is that the idea or...?

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:27.220
 You just won't be reincarnated, I don't think,

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:28.900
 as well as you might have.

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:31.740
 It's not as bad as hurting a human, which is a higher being,

00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:33.860
 but it's still not ideal.

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:37.060
 So these guys are the ones who sweep the streets

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:40.940
 so that they don't stand on any insects and stuff, is that right?

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:43.060
 And they wear masks so they don't inhale them.

00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:45.300
 They don't go out at night because you men...

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:49.540
 Someone said they don't go out at night because the light's not good enough,

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:51.140
 and so you can't see what you're eating.

00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:53.460
 And so you might think you're eating a piece of bread,

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:55.940
 but it could be a bunch of small insects.

00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:57.100
 Which...

00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:59.740
 I'm no gormonde, but...

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:02.260
 I think I can tell the difference.

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:06.180
 It's incredibly hard life being a Jane.

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:09.980
 So Jane monks, you know, it's an older sister religion of Buddhism.

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:13.500
 So they're very, very, very keen to avoid the pleasures of the flesh,

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:14.340
 extremely keen.

00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:16.140
 So Buddhist monks shave their heads.

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:20.780
 Jane monks pluck out their hairs one by one in a deliberately painful ceremony.

00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:22.820
 Buddhist monks beg for their food.

00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:24.820
 Jane monks are not allowed to beg.

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:26.260
 They're not even allowed to beg.

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:30.900
 There's a hand gesture you can make, a bit like they arch their right hand over their shoulder.

00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:32.300
 Which I think is like this.

00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:36.460
 It's kind of like the beginning of "I'm a little teapot."

00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:39.500
 And that's to show hunger, but they cannot directly ask for food.

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:40.740
 Oh, really?

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:44.420
 But then if you do that gesture, then people do sometimes give you something, don't they?

00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:46.300
 Yeah, people say that's, oh, he's hungry, yeah.

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:50.020
 Yeah, because there is the thing, there are basically two main variants of Janeism.

00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:53.460
 And one is called Digambar, and one is Fettambar.

00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:56.700
 And the Digambars are the Skyclad or Naked Jains.

00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:59.500
 And they are not allowed to own any material possessions.

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:01.700
 And this is if you really strictly adhere.

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:03.460
 So this is the monk and the nuns.

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:06.380
 So they have to be naked all the time, if they're those monks,

00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:09.300
 because you're not allowed to own clothes, because they're material possessions.

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:11.660
 And that causes some... You can have a iPhone, though, can you?

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:13.140
 Obviously, you can have an iPhone.

00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:14.260
 Where would you keep it?

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:18.220
 It's not going to that.

00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:20.540
 Could you rent a Tuxedo, for example?

00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:21.540
 Because then you don't own it.

00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:22.740
 You don't own it. You just rent it?

00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:23.540
 Oh, yeah.

00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:25.180
 But how would you pay for it?

00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:26.700
 Good point, no money.

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:30.740
 I don't know if Tuxedo rental existed 3,000 years ago, and they sort of founded it.

00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:32.380
 So maybe they've updated it.

00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:34.060
 But those ones can't even own a bowl.

00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:37.260
 So they have to ask for water by cupping their hands,

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.740
 and then it all slides through their fingers before they can drink it.

00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:42.340
 I think they're allowed to drink from God, aren't they?

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:43.980
 Are they? I think so, yeah.

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:46.060
 I think one sector is the other sector.

00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:47.500
 I believe so. Wow.

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:50.980
 Because the other sector, which are allowed to work clothes,

00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:53.020
 are still only allowed to wear white, aren't they?

00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:55.940
 And this thing about how they don't want to hurt any animals.

00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:59.860
 This, if you look back in their stories of their history,

00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:02.260
 there were 24 Jane Ford makers.

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.780
 They were the prophets who kind of started the whole thing.

00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:08.540
 And one of them was so bothered about not harming anything at all

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:12.700
 that before he was born, he floated perfectly still in his mother's womb,

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:15.860
 sending not so much as a ripple throughout the amniotic fluid

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:18.380
 to avoid harming his mother.

00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:19.740
 Wow.

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:20.740
 So thoughtful.

00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:22.340
 They're the epitome of thoughtful.

00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:24.100
 They're what we all should strive towards, really.

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:27.700
 And so some of them wear a mask to stop inhaling insects,

00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:29.220
 but there's controversy about the masks,

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:32.620
 because some people say that it's a good thing to wear a mask

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:35.060
 because the breath from your mouth is hot.

00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:37.980
 And if you don't wear a cloth, you might scorch microscopic beings

00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:42.340
 in the air, kind of like Godzilla.

00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:44.060
 Kind of. He didn't wear clothes either.

00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:46.620
 He didn't wear clothes.

00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:49.420
 So some people say that if you do wear a cloth,

00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:52.500
 that might be a bad thing, because your breath is moist,

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:56.260
 and that might give rise to microorganisms in the cloth.

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:59.180
 And then there will be more living and dying because of you breathing.

00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:00.540
 So they'll die when you handle it.

00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:01.580
 So problem.

00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:03.860
 It's a tightrope, isn't it, that you've got to walk?

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:05.380
 And it's slightly tougher for women.

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:07.900
 Although I will say, I think they have much more egalitarian views

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:09.780
 than a lot of mainstream religions.

00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:11.500
 And generally, they're kind of great.

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:12.820
 But they do have this slight thing

00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:17.180
 where if you believe in the naked shanism, the sky-clad James,

00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:22.860
 then women can't quite attain proper enlightenment, proper nirvana.

00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:25.260
 And that is because women can't be naked,

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:26.900
 because it's inconvenient for them, apparently.

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:28.900
 I don't understand why it's more inconvenient for women

00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:30.780
 to be naked than for men to be naked.

00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:32.340
 It seems equally inconvenient.

00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:35.620
 But also, so one, women can't be naked, because it's inconvenient.

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:39.620
 And two, women can't be naked, because they are intrinsically harmful.

00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:46.060
 And this is actually based in the understandable belief

00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:49.820
 that women's periods kill loads of creatures as they happen.

00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:51.380
 So as-- and I don't know what it--

00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:53.660
 I think maybe you think it's just sort of--

00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:55.700
 I'm noticing that body form advert.

00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:59.340
 [LAUGHTER]

00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:00.300
 Well, that was the idea.

00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:02.060
 The inspiration was basically the death

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:04.580
 of thousands and thousands of these tiny organisms,

00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:06.660
 so you couldn't quite achieve nirvana as a woman.

00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:09.180
 But you could come still quite close.

00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:11.620
 I've got a tangential fact about Jainism.

00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:13.740
 And it's actually to do with a lot of Eastern religions.

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:16.100
 So we may have mentioned before that swastikers

00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:18.940
 are quite big in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism,

00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:19.980
 and they're big in Jainism.

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:21.860
 And I found out in the course of researching this,

00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:24.220
 I didn't know this, in the year 2013.

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:25.740
 And in fact, a few years since then,

00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:30.060
 there was a day called Learn to Love the Swastika,

00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:33.620
 which was aiming to rehabilitate the swastika

00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:35.020
 because it's an ancient symbol.

00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:36.980
 But it seems to be working.

00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:39.140
 You see the lot more of it, these days.

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:41.460
 It's going really well.

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:43.500
 But to raise awareness of the symbol

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:45.580
 and its history as a peaceful symbol,

00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:47.060
 tattoo artists around the world

00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:49.780
 offered people free swastika tattoos.

00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:50.780
 It's just true.

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:51.980
 This happened.

00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:53.700
 And there were lots of articles about it.

00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:56.020
 And there was a report from La Journal International,

00:17:56.020 --> 00:17:58.460
 which said this, "When a beamy journalist questioned

00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:00.380
 one of the tattooists about the probability

00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:03.100
 that neo-nazis might take advantage of the event,

00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:05.140
 the latter answered that even if that was the case,

00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:09.660
 these people will leave with a symbol of love on their body."

00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:11.780
 You've just got to let some things go, don't you?

00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:14.860
 I think you've got to leave the swastika behind.

00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:17.140
 There was a guy in America that I read about years ago

00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:19.900
 who went through World War II.

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:22.900
 And he lived in, I believe it was Ohio in America,

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:24.820
 whose name was Adolf Hitler.

00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:26.580
 And he refused to change his name.

00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:29.940
 He ended up becoming famous for it, people interviewing him,

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:32.820
 saying, "Why have you not changed your name from Adolf Hitler?"

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:36.900
 And his response was, "I'm not going to let one guy

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:41.780
 ruin the good name of Adolf Hitler."

00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:46.060
 Just on mic-- sorry, I thought it was distraction.

00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:48.260
 Just on microbes.

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:50.660
 I was looking up lots of stuff about microbes

00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:52.700
 because of the puddles and microbes in them.

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:55.980
 Did you know the Oregon has an official state microbe?

00:18:56.980 --> 00:18:58.620
 No, I didn't know that.

00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:01.660
 What is it? It's bakers yeast.

00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:06.460
 Because it's very important to craft brewers and craft bakers,

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:08.020
 if they exist.

00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:11.460
 But lots of states have discussed having a state microbe.

00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:13.540
 And I think so far, Oregon's the only one which said,

00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:15.300
 "Well, they've got the best one, haven't they?"

00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:17.260
 They've got a good one. There are other good ones.

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:20.220
 So Wisconsin proposed in its parliament,

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:23.340
 Lactococcus Lactis, which is very crucial for cheese production,

00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:24.660
 because you get a lot of cheese in Wisconsin,

00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:26.300
 but that didn't get through.

00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:30.780
 Hawaii suggested a bacterium, which was found on a native shrub,

00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:34.300
 but then there was a rival camp who wanted a different state microbe.

00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:37.420
 I was a huge argument in the Hawaiian parliament about some people

00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:39.780
 said, "No, we want this one, which lives in a symbiotic relationship

00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:41.020
 with a squid."

00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:43.260
 And all the people-- all the people who wanted the shrub ones said,

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:44.860
 "Yeah, well, the shrub lives in Hawaii.

00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:47.180
 It's a native to Hawaii, and the squid lives everywhere."

00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:49.540
 The squid one is Vibrio fish scary, isn't it?

00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:51.340
 I love that microbe. They should definitely have gone with that.

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:52.860
 I know, I know. The other one, actually.

00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:54.460
 Oh, here we go again.

00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:55.660
 All right, let's take this outside.

00:19:55.660 --> 00:19:56.460
 The one on the bush.

00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:57.340
 I like the one on the bush.

00:19:57.340 --> 00:20:00.100
 Are they going to such a massive route that they scrap the whole thing?

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:03.540
 Do we think America hasn't got its priority straight?

00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:05.700
 Fills that they've got bigger fish to fry.

00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:07.300
 We're going to have to move on very shortly.

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:10.060
 Can I just talk about how you couldn't kill a microbe if you really wanted to?

00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:11.220
 Yes, yeah.

00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:14.780
 Because the repaying the arse and antibiotics are struggling,

00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:17.420
 and so people have been really looking into how else we can kill microbes,

00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:19.100
 and they're quite hard to squash.

00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:21.740
 So actually, this is something that James probably have got wrong,

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:25.660
 because they're so small, obviously, they're like a thousandth of a millimeter

00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:29.500
 that you can't, they'll get into a crevice before you can probably squash them.

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:31.820
 So there's a scientist called Elena Ivanova,

00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:35.700
 and she works in Australia, and she's worked really, really hard to create surfaces

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:40.580
 so smooth that bacteria will just slide off them without being able to hold on.

00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:44.620
 But some of them can still cling on, so that's failed.

00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:47.820
 And she was really panicking about why I don't know how to kill these microbes,

00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:50.220
 but they're still clinging to my society surfaces.

00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:52.980
 And so she wrote to another scientist and asked if he had any ideas.

00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:56.780
 And he said, try the cicada wing, and what an earth.

00:20:56.780 --> 00:21:01.300
 But she got a cicada wing, so you know, cicadas, they took a wing off.

00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:05.380
 And it turns out that if you put a bacterium onto the wing of a cicada,

00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:09.780
 it gets punctured all over, spills all its guts out, little bacteria guts,

00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:13.460
 and at least to a quick death, and gecko skin is even better.

00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:17.260
 It's really hard to kill them, and it's really hard to kill them by stamping.

00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:21.140
 You can do it if you really put a huge amount of pressure on.

00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:22.580
 You can't kill them.

00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:25.100
 If you press food, there's a process called Pascalization,

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:28.860
 and if you press food with 87,000 pounds per square inch.

00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:29.860
 Right.

00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:32.460
 You just make all the bacteria go pop.

00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:35.220
 I'm not going into your restaurant.

00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:40.020
 We serve extremely flat food, extremely competitive prices.

00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:41.420
 How heavy is that?

00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:43.660
 Sorry? 87,000 pounds.

00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:44.420
 It's a lot.

00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:46.340
 It's more than all four of us put together.

00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:48.420
 OK, it's a lot more.

00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:49.620
 Yeah, by as I imagine.

00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:51.700
 But it depends how we arrange it, right?

00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:55.980
 So if I was wearing one stiletto shoe and you all climbed on my shoulders,

00:21:55.980 --> 00:22:00.180
 then I think that might be enough concentration of weight.

00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:02.820
 If we were all hippos.

00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:03.780
 And that, yeah.

00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:05.700
 But it's not a good idea to do it.

00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:08.420
 So Science ABC, they looked into it, and they said,

00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:11.500
 stomping around your house in a bid to sanitize or sterilize your floor

00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:13.660
 is a bad idea.

00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:15.300
 Honestly, you don't want your family to see you,

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:16.540
 and think you've lost your mind.

00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:19.300
 [LAUGHTER]

00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:21.580
 OK, we need to move on to our next fact.

00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:23.380
 It is time for fact number three.

00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:24.860
 And that is my fact.

00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:28.620
 My fact this week is that during the Second World War,

00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:32.140
 while American pilots were flying over enemy territory,

00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:34.740
 not only were they shooting at that enemy,

00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:39.540
 but they were also often making ice cream at the same time.

00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:40.860
 How are they doing it?

00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:42.780
 They weren't just churning it while they were.

00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:43.500
 No, exactly.

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:45.700
 So this was a big thing during World War II

00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:47.340
 that I'd never read about before.

00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:49.140
 Ice cream was massive for the troops.

00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:51.860
 It was to help them with calories and sustenance,

00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:54.540
 and it was a food that got banned by most other countries.

00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:57.300
 Britain, for example, banned ice cream during the war.

00:22:57.300 --> 00:22:58.660
 Yeah, as a sustenance thing.

00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:00.980
 As a rationing thing, basically, because it's sugar,

00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:02.700
 and we don't need to use all that sugar.

00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:03.580
 Yeah, exactly.

00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:07.740
 They suggested a carrot on a stick as an alternative.

00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:08.340
 That didn't go down.

00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:09.020
 On a stick?

00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:10.180
 The carrot is the stick.

00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:11.180
 Yeah.

00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:12.980
 What was the point of shoving a stick up a carrot?

00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:14.700
 So it looks like an ice cream.

00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:16.860
 I'm just saying that carrots can be used as a stick,

00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:19.580
 because carrots don't melt in the same way that magnums do.

00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:20.620
 Yeah.

00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:24.740
 You would have been court-martialed at this point, mate.

00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:25.820
 Just stick with the program.

00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:28.140
 It's a waste of sticks.

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:31.460
 Surely we need sticks for the war effect.

00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:33.980
 Do you know weaponry had come on quite a lot further than that?

00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:36.100
 That's a lot more.

00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:39.820
 All in the stick battalion following me.

00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:42.580
 So what this was is that they were constantly

00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:45.060
 making ice cream in very creative ways during the war.

00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:46.380
 And one of the things that they discovered

00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:48.660
 is that you could take a sort of drum,

00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:50.540
 put all the ingredients inside of it,

00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:52.860
 and attach it to the back of a plane.

00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:57.060
 So as you flew over, you were reaching about 30,000 feet up

00:23:57.060 --> 00:23:58.540
 in the air, very cold up there.

00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:00.780
 So you had the coldness to make it freeze.

00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:03.660
 But also, the vibration of the engine, the machine gun

00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:06.780
 going, were churning all the ice cream products around.

00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:10.060
 So by the time that you'd down some enemy planes

00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:13.380
 and landed back on your aircraft in the ocean,

00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:15.460
 you could go and have a big scoop of ice cream off

00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:16.540
 the back of your airplane.

00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:17.740
 That's so cool.

00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:20.260
 There was a guy called Jay Hunter Reinberg,

00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:22.740
 who was one of the first people, maybe the first person

00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:23.860
 to do this.

00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:26.820
 And the first time he put the ice cream too close to his engine

00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:28.540
 so it couldn't get cold enough.

00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:29.780
 And so it was a bit like Goopy.

00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:31.500
 They still let it, of course.

00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:37.140
 But then the second time, he flew 33,000 feet over Palau.

00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:39.060
 And so he went high, high enough.

00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:40.620
 So it was really, really cold.

00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:42.460
 And the good advantage of that is, number one,

00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:44.020
 it meant that the ice cream froze.

00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:46.820
 But number two, it meant that none of the Japanese aircraft

00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:48.700
 could shoot him, because he was so high.

00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:49.980
 And so they just kept shooting at him

00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:51.260
 and the bullets couldn't reach him.

00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:53.700
 So he was just watching it all going on below him.

00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:55.020
 - Wow. - Wow.

00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:55.860
 - Wow.

00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:59.740
 - I kind of didn't realize how easy ice cream is to make.

00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:00.580
 I haven't tried it.

00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:01.660
 I haven't just read about it still.

00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:03.940
 So maybe it's not-- - Yeah, it sounds at the moment.

00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:05.100
 It sounds like you need a plane.

00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:05.940
 So--

00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:07.780
 [LAUGHTER]

00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:10.820
 Imagine if you got your pilot's license just for that.

00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:12.620
 But you can-- I was reading a--

00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:15.060
 there was a thing in the New Yorker by someone who said,

00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:17.700
 she went to a friend's house and the friend said for dinner.

00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:18.940
 And the friend said, great, who's

00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:20.500
 for ice cream for pudding?

00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:22.260
 And everyone was like, yeah, great.

00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:23.900
 And so the friend went away and she came back.

00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:26.620
 And she had one ziplock bag.

00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:29.020
 And then another much larger ziplock bag.

00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:31.300
 And basically, she filled the small ziplock bag

00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:33.140
 with vanilla extract and sugar.

00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:34.180
 And then she closed that.

00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:35.980
 And then inside the larger one, she filled that

00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:36.860
 with ice and salt.

00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:40.380
 And salt is the crucial ingredient for making ice cream, isn't it?

00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:42.180
 And then she shook the bag about a bit.

00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:43.700
 Got tired, passed it around the table.

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:45.260
 So it's quite a fun past the past,

00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:47.380
 or kind of dinner party experience.

00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:50.060
 And by the time it got back around to, that's ice cream.

00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:53.260
 But it's because ice and salt makes an endothermic reaction.

00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:56.180
 So it sucks all the heat out of your ziplock bag

00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:57.500
 with vanilla in it.

00:25:57.500 --> 00:25:58.700
 This doesn't sound like a great party.

00:25:58.700 --> 00:25:59.300
 I have to say.

00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:01.500
 [LAUGHTER]

00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:04.700
 So just other things that during World War II,

00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:07.580
 they used ice cream for the US Navy.

00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:10.540
 So in order to get ice cream to a lot of people,

00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:13.100
 they had a lot of the Navy ships that were out and about.

00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:15.140
 There was one specific ship, which they

00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:18.220
 spent $1 million converting at the time, which

00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:22.460
 was effectively an ocean ice cream factory.

00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:23.740
 And that's all it did.

00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:24.780
 It created ice cream.

00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:27.340
 It could do 10 gallons every seven minutes.

00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:30.100
 And it would just go to various different Navy ships

00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:31.900
 and deliver them ice cream.

00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:32.420
 Yeah.

00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:33.220
 It's about--

00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:35.060
 I was just looking at that amount that it could do.

00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:37.380
 It's the equivalent of doing one Ben and Jerry's

00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:39.060
 tub every five seconds.

00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:40.060
 Wow.

00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:43.140
 Didn't need to only be in extremely rough seas all the time

00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:44.500
 to turn it up.

00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:46.500
 No, because you've got the engine kind of going round

00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:48.100
 the propellers and stuff like that.

00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:49.540
 So it was still powered by the engine.

00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:49.860
 Yeah.

00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:51.660
 And also, the enemy could always hear it coming

00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:54.980
 because of the chimes in the back of the air.

00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:57.460
 It was a flawed system, yeah.

00:26:57.460 --> 00:27:00.780
 But there's reports, apparently, of these ships

00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:02.460
 that when they were attacked by the Japanese,

00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:05.300
 for torpedo hit it, there are a few accounts of sailors

00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:07.500
 before they were abandoning ship and jumping overboard,

00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:10.060
 running to the bit of the ship that had the ice cream,

00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:12.380
 scooping as much as they could into their helmets,

00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:15.220
 eating that, and then jumping off.

00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:17.980
 So just a quick bowl of ice cream before--

00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:20.460
 That was in the USS Lexington, which

00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:22.060
 had a lot of ice cream on board, wasn't it?

00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:22.580
 Yes.

00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:23.100
 Yeah.

00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:24.340
 This is-- I should just very quickly say,

00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:26.100
 I've gotten a lot of this information

00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:27.540
 from the Atlantic online.

00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:28.860
 But the ocean?

00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:30.380
 Yeah.

00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:32.820
 I speak to oceans.

00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:35.020
 Just on-- you mentioned chimes just now, James.

00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:37.260
 So there used to be--

00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:39.060
 I didn't know this-- in the UK, I believe--

00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:41.300
 250,000 ice cream vans.

00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:43.740
 And as I say that, that sounds insane.

00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:45.860
 Today, there are a few of them, 2,500.

00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:49.580
 And one of the main threats to them is, can you guess?

00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:50.700
 The sun.

00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:52.540
 Yes, yes.

00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:54.180
 I kind of, I guess.

00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:54.700
 Yeah.

00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:56.780
 I've got children growing up.

00:27:56.780 --> 00:27:57.780
 Yeah.

00:27:57.780 --> 00:27:59.540
 But more come to replace them, that doesn't make sense.

00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:00.780
 Yeah, exactly.

00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:03.780
 Is it the health code, people?

00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:05.740
 Yeah, all of these are really good answers.

00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:08.780
 But there's one thing that you haven't mentioned yet.

00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:10.340
 Double glazing.

00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:14.700
 Because you can't hear the chimes if you're double glazed.

00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:15.220
 Yes.

00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:18.900
 In 2017, the head of the trade body, the ice cream association,

00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:22.860
 by the way, awesome, said that new homes are so energy efficient.

00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:24.620
 They've got double, sometimes even triple glazing.

00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:27.380
 And children might not hear a van right outside their house

00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:28.460
 when it's playing a chimes.

00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:32.820
 So they launched an app for smartphones called Vantut,

00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:37.100
 which alerts you on your phone with an electronic jingle

00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:38.820
 if there's an ice cream van nearby.

00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:40.060
 No, it's really cool.

00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:40.820
 That's so cool.

00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:45.580
 In the 1980s, in Glasgow, there was an ice cream war

00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:48.660
 between two gangs who were selling drugs and stolen goods

00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:50.580
 from ice cream vans.

00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:51.340
 Ooh.

00:28:51.340 --> 00:28:52.180
 Yeah.

00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:54.580
 So it was really a drugs war.

00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:57.940
 No, James said it was done from ice cream vans.

00:28:57.940 --> 00:29:00.220
 Well, it was quite serious, actually.

00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:01.540
 But it was all in the news.

00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:03.980
 And everyone was having to go at the Strathclyde police

00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:05.980
 because they weren't solving all these crimes.

00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:08.340
 And the local newspapers called the police,

00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:10.260
 the Sirius Chimes Squad.

00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:11.460
 Oh.

00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:14.300
 They should have called for Magnum PI.

00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:16.300
 Ah.

00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:17.780
 Thank you guys.

00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:18.580
 Very strong.

00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:25.500
 So the jingle used to be, before it was playing music,

00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:29.180
 it used to be a man shouting, "Hokie Pokie."

00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:30.460
 Because it's really cool.

00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:33.380
 That is the Italian for "Oh, Chipoke."

00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:35.140
 So it's a bastardisation of that.

00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:39.780
 And "Oh, Chipoke" means, "Oh, how small."

00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:43.380
 I have heard that a few times this time.

00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:45.340
 Because about 1/10 of Italian immigrants

00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:48.860
 in the 1890s were selling ice cream, weren't they?

00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:50.260
 Yeah, I think about 10%.

00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:51.940
 Well, about 10% of vendors, and they were basically

00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:53.180
 all ice cream vendors.

00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:54.340
 And so that came about.

00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:57.220
 But in the 19th century-- so the ice cream was.

00:29:57.220 --> 00:29:59.300
 It's not the first time it's been associated with a vice.

00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:01.940
 Because in the 19th century, ice cream parlors

00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:03.220
 became a very big thing.

00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:04.700
 This is especially in America.

00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:07.580
 And it was because women, basically,

00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:10.100
 weren't really allowed to go to places on their own.

00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:11.260
 And I see a chaperone.

00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:12.620
 And this started becoming more and more

00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:14.100
 of a thing as a century progressed.

00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:15.700
 So you'd turn up to a restaurant and they'd be like,

00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:16.740
 where's the chaperone?

00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:18.380
 And then they'd kick you out.

00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:21.500
 And so they sort of came up with ice cream parlors, which

00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:24.940
 became a place that women were allowed to hang out by themselves.

00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:29.060
 And they were called parlors to mimic the homey cozy life

00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:31.700
 that we ladies desire.

00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:33.700
 And--

00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:37.580
 But they, of course, turned into hotbeds of vice immediately.

00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:39.380
 So there was all this disapproval because it

00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:41.060
 was thought that without formal chaperones,

00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:42.620
 women were just turning up and keeping

00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:46.340
 awful company and going out with really bad men.

00:30:46.340 --> 00:30:48.500
 And there were rumors about ice cream

00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:51.140
 drugged with passion-exciting vanilla.

00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:54.940
 And lots of-- there was one journalist who wrote,

00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:56.300
 I think, in the New York Times, that he

00:30:56.300 --> 00:30:57.740
 went into an ice cream parlor.

00:30:57.740 --> 00:31:00.220
 And he saw a man and woman deep in conversation

00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:03.940
 who were evidently man and wife, though not each others.

00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:08.580
 It's amazing that vanilla was so--

00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:11.180
 because that's the shittest of all the flavors these days.

00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:11.980
 Isn't it?

00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:13.620
 Very raunchy back then.

00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:16.580
 Yeah, I love the hall of a hornetto, please.

00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:17.620
 You could say.

00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:18.620
 Yeah, you could.

00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:22.020
 You could, you could.

00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:23.940
 We're going to have to move on shortly.

00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:28.060
 Before Connets, they used to sell ice cream in penny licks.

00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:29.540
 And these were little-- this was in London.

00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:32.460
 They used to sell them in little glasses,

00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:33.940
 but they're a little bit bigger.

00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:36.700
 And they're almost like sundae-- what you put Sundays in.

00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:38.980
 What they would do is they would give you your penny

00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:41.540
 liquor, put ice cream in it, and then you would return it

00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:43.740
 to them, and then they'd give it a quick wipe,

00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:46.060
 and then put some more ice cream for the next person

00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:46.580
 to do it.

00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:48.500
 Sometimes not even a wipe, right?

00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:49.100
 It was--

00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:50.300
 That was bad for the bacteria.

00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:53.660
 And that is why ice cream cones became quite popular, wasn't it?

00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:55.660
 Yeah, because they were banned in 1899

00:31:55.660 --> 00:31:58.300
 because they were causing the spread of tuberculosis.

00:31:58.300 --> 00:31:59.660
 Right.

00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:00.380
 But right.

00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:01.460
 That was bad.

00:32:01.460 --> 00:32:04.380
 And then the cone came about, and it was a huge deal.

00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:07.820
 So this was the 1904 World's Fair that the ice cream cone

00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:09.340
 was invented.

00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:12.420
 So there were instances of appearing kind of in a few cookbooks

00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:14.580
 in the 19th century, but it was suddenly made popular

00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:15.780
 at the World's Fair.

00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:17.980
 And it was this huge thing in the 1904 World's Fair.

00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:20.700
 So if any of you have ever seen Meet Me In St. Louis,

00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:22.580
 and I don't know why, the song is pronounced like that,

00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:25.500
 but it was about the World's Fair that was in St. Louis.

00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:26.780
 And it was a huge deal.

00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:30.860
 So they had sort of like bears made of prunes at the World's Fair

00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:31.980
 and what they had.

00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:35.300
 Just what everyone's always want to say.

00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:37.460
 What's the point of the bear made of prunes?

00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:39.100
 Everyone loves a prune.

00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:40.300
 Yeah, true.

00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:41.420
 A bears and exotic thing.

00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:42.100
 There you go.

00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:43.740
 I think they did actual snarling.

00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:47.180
 They had a massive landscape sculptured entirely from butter.

00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:49.740
 They were showing the new refrigeration technology.

00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:53.020
 So they had a milk made, milking a cow,

00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:55.300
 but all of it was made of butter.

00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:57.860
 And they had Roosevelt on a horse, Teddy Roosevelt,

00:32:57.860 --> 00:32:59.060
 the president at the time, on a horse.

00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:00.340
 What was he made of, peaches?

00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:00.860
 It's all butter.

00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:01.540
 It's all butter.

00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:02.660
 OK, it's all butter.

00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:05.180
 But anyway, sorry, they made the ice cream cone there.

00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:06.780
 Because there was ice cream on display,

00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:08.980
 and no one had thought of eating it like on the hoof.

00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:10.860
 And then they realized people wanted to try it.

00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:15.060
 And so, near by waffle vendor, curled his waffle round

00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:17.380
 into a cone shape and said, try this.

00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:19.180
 And hence, the cone was invented.

00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:21.940
 But there's this great historian who's really looked into this.

00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:24.300
 And she's found seven different people

00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:27.220
 who claim to have invented it at that one fair.

00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:30.020
 They're like, so there was a Syrian guy, a Lebanese guy,

00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:33.300
 a Turkish guy, someone from Ohio, all saying they'd done it.

00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:36.300
 But there was born the ice cream cone.

00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:38.660
 Well, it's a simple history of the ice cream.

00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:43.620
 And you know that it's better to eat ice cream by licking it

00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:45.020
 than with a spoon.

00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:45.820
 So, yeah.

00:33:45.820 --> 00:33:49.300
 And the reason is that the flavor in ice cream

00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:52.540
 is released when the fat content comes out of it.

00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:54.340
 And that comes when it warms up.

00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:56.980
 And because your tongue is warmer than a spoon,

00:33:56.980 --> 00:33:58.940
 and it's got a larger surface area,

00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:01.020
 it's better to put it on there, and then it kind of melts

00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:03.100
 and you get the flavor, whereas if you do it with a spoon,

00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:04.980
 then it's still cold when it goes in your mouth

00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:05.980
 and you don't get all the flavor,

00:34:05.980 --> 00:34:07.580
 because you swallow it before you can.

00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:08.820
 Just a tip.

00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:09.860
 It's a top tip.

00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:11.260
 Yeah.

00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:12.620
 There's a guy who can tell the difference

00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:20.340
 between 12% and 11.5% pot of fat in ice cream.

00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:23.500
 He gets invited to a lot of parties.

00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:25.580
 He's an official ice cream taste tester,

00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:26.940
 and he was called John Harrison.

00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:28.860
 He was the ice cream taste tester for dryers,

00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:31.700
 from 1980 to 2010, so for 30 years.

00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:33.900
 And he had his tongue insured for $1 million.

00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:36.380
 In fact, the company had his tongue insured for $1 million.

00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:37.380
 So they always say this.

00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:40.220
 We've ensured your tongue for $1 million.

00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:41.980
 What's the risk?

00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:45.380
 There isn't a gang of roving tongue thieves.

00:34:45.380 --> 00:34:48.340
 It's a very precious tongue, I'd get it if I could.

00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:49.300
 He would know that.

00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:52.460
 [LAUGHTER]

00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:55.500
 No.

00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:57.460
 And before you can explain what that means,

00:34:57.460 --> 00:35:00.700
 it is time for fact number four.

00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:08.620
 Our final fact of the evening is James.

00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:12.620
 OK, my back this week is that in 1997,

00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:15.620
 a town in Saskatchewan held a referendum

00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:17.500
 on whether the end of a toilet paper

00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:21.340
 should hang under or over the roll.

00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:23.900
 And luckily, that was the last time anyone ever

00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:26.940
 asked a stupid question by means of a referendum ever again.

00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:29.740
 [LAUGHTER]

00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:32.460
 So this was a local election in Saskatoon, which

00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:35.860
 in Saskatchewan, and they were trying out new voting machines,

00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:36.540
 basically.

00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:39.380
 And so what they wanted to do was have a trial question,

00:35:39.380 --> 00:35:41.540
 which was nothing to do with any kind of politics

00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:44.340
 and wouldn't get people riled up.

00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:47.100
 And so they said, what do you think

00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:50.900
 should be the official town microbe?

00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:53.380
 The question was, are you in favor of toilet paper

00:35:53.380 --> 00:35:55.700
 in all public washrooms being installed

00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:59.100
 with the loose end coming up and over the front of the roll?

00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:02.580
 And the answer was 80% over.

00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:04.820
 OK, and so they said they didn't want it to be political.

00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:07.300
 Oh, we've got a few over fans in here.

00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:08.300
 Oh, OK.

00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:09.780
 That was definitely 52%.

00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:11.580
 In Sunderland, they feel completely the other way about it,

00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:13.580
 all right?

00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:16.380
 But yeah, one teenager did a science project about it

00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:19.300
 and did a survey and found that liberals usually

00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:22.940
 go for over while conservatives usually go for unforeseen.

00:36:22.940 --> 00:36:23.740
 Really?

00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:26.340
 Actually, it was quite political after all.

00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:30.460
 And was it enacted, as in did all public washrooms

00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:35.740
 follow the overwhelming mandate of--

00:36:35.740 --> 00:36:38.940
 I think it became the rule, but I'm sure there isn't a person

00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:41.140
 who goes around checking them all.

00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:42.540
 So it wasn't legally binding.

00:36:42.540 --> 00:36:45.580
 [LAUGHTER]

00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:47.740
 It might be for me to criticize the people's choice,

00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:50.940
 but I think they got that absolutely wrong.

00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:52.100
 Oh, really?

00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:53.740
 The toilet roll thing, that's insane.

00:36:53.740 --> 00:36:56.420
 And there's no wonder liberals go for over the top,

00:36:56.420 --> 00:36:57.860
 because over the top, waste so much more

00:36:57.860 --> 00:36:59.700
 rule, because it easily gets--

00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:01.140
 Don't waste more?

00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:02.100
 Yeah, it absolutely does.

00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:02.940
 It just waste more.

00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:05.260
 It falls down more easily, especially if you've got a cat.

00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:06.500
 It's not cascading down.

00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:07.500
 Oh, yeah.

00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:10.620
 Like, no, if you've got a character, you have a cat.

00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:12.180
 You've got a cat or if you get home drunk.

00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:13.780
 You're not one of those guys, guys.

00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:15.940
 So what was the moment that no such thing

00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:16.980
 as a fish really ended?

00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:19.500
 [LAUGHTER]

00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:20.260
 Wow.

00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:21.260
 Wow.

00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:23.300
 I feel tense.

00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:25.140
 Some more referendums that have happened.

00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:25.980
 Oh, yeah.

00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:29.220
 So since that will work, sell that.

00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:30.660
 No, but it's really interesting.

00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:32.740
 So lots of-- America is really big on this.

00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:35.940
 So in the USA, they have extra referendums

00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:37.580
 kind of attached to votes that they're having.

00:37:37.580 --> 00:37:39.700
 So you might have a state or a national election,

00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:41.460
 and you'll just depend a few extra votes,

00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:42.940
 which are yes, no, things normally.

00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:44.500
 So and some of them are quite fun.

00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:49.420
 So in 2006, Arizona voted on whether to give a million dollars

00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:53.780
 to a single resident chosen by lottery simply for voting

00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:54.860
 to encourage turnout.

00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:56.780
 Yes, and I guess we get a million dollars.

00:37:56.780 --> 00:37:58.820
 It was called the Arizona Voter Reward Act,

00:37:58.820 --> 00:37:59.900
 and they rejected it.

00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:00.420
 Classic.

00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:01.180
 Oh, really?

00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:01.740
 Yeah.

00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:02.900
 Classic human.

00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:04.780
 They think, what if it's not me?

00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:07.180
 [LAUGHTER]

00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:10.500
 There was a great one, which was in Castlewood, Virginia.

00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:12.460
 And this was in 1997.

00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:16.460
 And the question for the vote was, should we exist?

00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:17.860
 And school.

00:38:17.860 --> 00:38:18.340
 Yeah.

00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:22.260
 And they decided they shouldn't.

00:38:22.260 --> 00:38:24.460
 And they no longer do.

00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:26.220
 What are you talking about?

00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:28.020
 Well, I think it was quite a tiny community

00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:29.620
 that was right next to a bigger community,

00:38:29.620 --> 00:38:32.380
 but it came with a lot of extra taxes off the back of existing.

00:38:32.380 --> 00:38:34.100
 So they said, let's not exist.

00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:37.380
 So they abolished themselves and became part of Russell County.

00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:37.900
 Yes.

00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:40.300
 But they had literally only existed for a couple of years.

00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:43.620
 They'd signed this big petition saying, we want to exist.

00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:44.100
 We want to exist.

00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:45.340
 We want autonomy.

00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:46.660
 We want a government.

00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:47.060
 Great.

00:38:47.060 --> 00:38:47.820
 Let's do it.

00:38:47.820 --> 00:38:49.900
 So they bloody did it, and then straight away.

00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:50.940
 They were like, taxes.

00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:52.740
 What do you talk about, fuck off?

00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:53.740
 [LAUGHTER]

00:38:53.740 --> 00:38:56.540
 Literally, immediately, the second administration

00:38:56.540 --> 00:38:59.980
 they put in power was this mayor called Roy Castle,

00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:02.740
 whose whole platform was to abolish their existence.

00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:03.220
 Wow.

00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:04.060
 Wow.

00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:05.620
 So people are able to change their minds

00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:08.580
 and have another vote a bit later if they feel like that.

00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:09.060
 I do.

00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:10.060
 I do.

00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:13.540
 [APPLAUSE]

00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:15.020
 Shuttle, very subtle.

00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:16.900
 By the way, this show isn't going out

00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:18.660
 for about three more months, so fuck does it.

00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:19.660
 Oh, fine.

00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:20.660
 Yeah.

00:39:20.660 --> 00:39:22.060
 You'll be able to trade this for food,

00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:23.380
 this episode of the podcast.

00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:26.180
 [LAUGHTER]

00:39:26.180 --> 00:39:28.900
 You'll be all sitting around your carrot sticks at home.

00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:32.380
 [LAUGHTER]

00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:33.060
 It's on a stick.

00:39:33.060 --> 00:39:33.820
 It's on a stick.

00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:34.900
 It's on a stick.

00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:36.660
 I mean, you can make carrot intersticks.

00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:38.860
 That's the weird thing.

00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:41.020
 Just some other good referendums.

00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:43.420
 In 1993, San Francisco had a referendum,

00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:45.900
 and it was on whether one specific policeman could

00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:48.260
 patrol with a ventriloquist dummy.

00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:51.740
 And they got pretty into this.

00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:54.420
 So this is this great guy called Bob Geary,

00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:56.260
 who was a community policeman, and he

00:39:56.260 --> 00:40:00.420
 was given the remit to make policing more creative and ingenious.

00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:02.540
 And he did that by spending a lot of money

00:40:02.540 --> 00:40:06.180
 on a big wooden ventriloquist dummy and going about.

00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:08.140
 And he probably learned how to do it.

00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:08.940
 He got all these tapes.

00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:10.140
 He practiced in front of the mirror.

00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:13.020
 And he called it, and he called it Brendan O'Smarty,

00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:15.580
 as sort of like a flip on the idea of a dummy.

00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:18.300
 And he dressed it up in police uniform with a water pistol,

00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:19.900
 patroled the streets.

00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:21.940
 And then eventually, the person in charge of police

00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:24.780
 complained and said he had to leave it in the car.

00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:27.340
 And so he got enough signatures for a referendum.

00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:28.380
 And it happened.

00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:30.100
 And bizarrely, the result--

00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:33.140
 I find so unfathomable, the result of the referendum

00:40:33.140 --> 00:40:37.300
 was just 51% to 49% in favor.

00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:40.940
 Who were the 49% voting against a policeman having a dummy?

00:40:40.940 --> 00:40:43.060
 I reckon it's probably the other policeman who,

00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:45.980
 when they call for backup and Brendan O'Smarty walks out.

00:40:45.980 --> 00:40:52.180
 With his water pistol.

00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:54.820
 Hello, there's a very, very, very small fire

00:40:54.820 --> 00:40:55.780
 that needs putting out.

00:40:55.780 --> 00:40:57.180
 He said Brendan.

00:40:57.180 --> 00:41:01.980
 He cost $1,700, which in 1993 was not nothing.

00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:05.180
 He already owns it, so he doesn't need to buy a new one, does he?

00:41:05.180 --> 00:41:06.020
 I guess not.

00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:06.940
 No.

00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:07.620
 Still.

00:41:07.620 --> 00:41:11.340
 I'm part of the 49% saying no to officer explanation.

00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:12.940
 It was to entertain children, wasn't it?

00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:13.940
 Oh, yeah.

00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:15.980
 To entertain people, I think.

00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:18.780
 And he did manage to apprehend criminals with it.

00:41:18.780 --> 00:41:19.700
 No, it was dog.

00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:21.580
 Apparently, there was more than one suspect

00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:24.100
 that he took down with the dummy in one hand

00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:25.300
 and the suspect in the other hand.

00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:26.180
 Are you kidding?

00:41:26.180 --> 00:41:26.980
 No.

00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:31.060
 Did he do a good cop bad cop with the dummy?

00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:32.860
 Look, I managed to hold him off you,

00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:34.820
 but I can only restrain him for so long.

00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:37.860
 [LAUGHTER]

00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:40.940
 Let me out of-- let me out.

00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:43.340
 I'm going to-- he's going to shout, let me out of-- let me out of--

00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:45.300
 well, I'm drinking a glass of water now.

00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:49.380
 [LAUGHTER]

00:41:49.380 --> 00:41:53.020
 There was another just speaking of entertainers in Sao Paulo.

00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:56.820
 There was a Brazilian clown who was called Tirerica,

00:41:56.820 --> 00:41:58.980
 who won an election.

00:41:58.980 --> 00:42:01.340
 And he was going for a federal deputy.

00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:02.860
 And this was in 2010.

00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:06.420
 He-- it was a question as well, which was, does anyone really

00:42:06.420 --> 00:42:08.980
 want to know what happens behind government doors?

00:42:08.980 --> 00:42:09.900
 That was simply it.

00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:11.860
 And everyone went, yes, someone's going to tell us the truth.

00:42:11.860 --> 00:42:14.020
 And it won him the election, but he was a clown.

00:42:14.020 --> 00:42:16.180
 And did he reveal-- did he--

00:42:16.180 --> 00:42:17.940
 I should have read the rest of the article earlier.

00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:20.980
 [LAUGHTER]

00:42:20.980 --> 00:42:23.460
 Can I talk about House of Lords votes?

00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:25.540
 Because they're quite weird.

00:42:25.540 --> 00:42:28.740
 So first of all, so that Lords aren't allowed to vote

00:42:28.740 --> 00:42:31.180
 for MPs, which is fair enough.

00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:33.100
 There was actually quite a good article

00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:36.420
 looking at funny voting comments over the years.

00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:39.500
 And apparently, in 1948, then someone

00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:43.580
 in America said that he got in touch with the House of Commons.

00:42:43.580 --> 00:42:45.340
 Because he was interested in the qualifications

00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:47.100
 for voting in England.

00:42:47.100 --> 00:42:49.500
 So he called the reference library in the House of Commons.

00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:52.020
 And he received the following pronouncement.

00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:54.780
 In Great Britain, any adult 21 years

00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:58.540
 or over may register and vote except peers and lunatics.

00:42:58.540 --> 00:43:00.020
 And we make an exception for the latter

00:43:00.020 --> 00:43:03.380
 if they have a moment of lucidity.

00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:07.220
 And that bombup was in 2016.

00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:09.220
 Well, they can't vote for MPs.

00:43:09.220 --> 00:43:10.580
 But they do have their own elections.

00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:12.020
 And they're often quite weird.

00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:14.580
 So in 2016, there was a by-election in the House of Lords.

00:43:14.580 --> 00:43:17.620
 It was to replace a Lib Dem peer called Eric Lubbock.

00:43:17.620 --> 00:43:21.100
 It was actually a very cool guy who wanted to leave his body

00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:23.460
 to bathe his dog's home to bury their diet.

00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:24.220
 But that's--

00:43:24.220 --> 00:43:26.220
 [LAUGHTER]

00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:28.740
 Besides the point, anyway, he died.

00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:30.660
 So someone had to replace him.

00:43:30.660 --> 00:43:33.060
 And the only people who qualified to vote to replace him

00:43:33.060 --> 00:43:35.340
 are the other Lib Dem hereditary peers,

00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:37.020
 of which there were three.

00:43:37.020 --> 00:43:38.340
 And there were seven candidates.

00:43:38.340 --> 00:43:42.700
 So they had a proper election where three people voted

00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:44.220
 for seven candidates.

00:43:44.220 --> 00:43:45.220
 Wow.

00:43:45.220 --> 00:43:47.420
 I think the only election where there are more candidates

00:43:47.420 --> 00:43:48.260
 than voters.

00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:49.260
 That was really good.

00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:53.060
 There was, in 1862, there was a referendum in Greece

00:43:53.060 --> 00:43:55.220
 because the people overthrew King Otto

00:43:55.220 --> 00:43:57.180
 and decided to hold a referendum to decide who

00:43:57.180 --> 00:43:58.700
 would take his place.

00:43:58.700 --> 00:44:01.900
 There were 240,000 votes counted.

00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:05.820
 And the winner was a guy who got six of them.

00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:09.540
 And that's because the Greeks voted 95% for Prince Alfred

00:44:09.540 --> 00:44:12.260
 who was British, but Britain, France, and Russia

00:44:12.260 --> 00:44:15.700
 had signed a treaty saying that no person from any of those countries

00:44:15.700 --> 00:44:17.580
 was allowed to take over.

00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:21.420
 OK, so the guy who got six votes was William of Denmark,

00:44:21.420 --> 00:44:25.260
 who took over on Julie Raid for 50 years.

00:44:25.260 --> 00:44:28.100
 Did he say how many votes the first guy got Alfred?

00:44:28.100 --> 00:44:31.700
 He got 95% of 240,000, so I'm sure you can work that out.

00:44:31.700 --> 00:44:33.700
 Yeah.

00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:37.100
 There were 93 people who voted for having a republic

00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:38.820
 rather than any King at all.

00:44:38.820 --> 00:44:43.380
 And there was one vote to bring back King Otto.

00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:46.540
 I wonder who that was from.

00:44:46.540 --> 00:44:47.780
 We're going to have to wrap up in a sec.

00:44:47.780 --> 00:44:50.500
 Oh, I've got one last fact about presidential elections,

00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:52.500
 which is just not really on referendum's.

00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:54.940
 But this was sent in by someone in the audience tonight.

00:44:54.940 --> 00:44:56.380
 Someone called Charlie Guinness.

00:44:56.380 --> 00:44:57.780
 Genness?

00:44:57.780 --> 00:44:59.740
 Oh, yeah.

00:44:59.740 --> 00:45:00.900
 And it's this.

00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:04.220
 Is that, in the 1948 US presidential election,

00:45:04.220 --> 00:45:07.260
 the Democrats commissioned a Papier Mache Donke,

00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:09.980
 which was designed to have smoke belching from its nostrils

00:45:09.980 --> 00:45:12.140
 to make it look impressive and intimidating.

00:45:12.140 --> 00:45:15.300
 Unfortunately, all the smoke came out of its back end, instead.

00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:18.140
 [LAUGHTER]

00:45:18.140 --> 00:45:19.140
 Amazing.

00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:22.140
 That's a good fact.

00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:23.260
 OK, that is it.

00:45:23.260 --> 00:45:24.740
 That is all of our facts.

00:45:24.740 --> 00:45:26.380
