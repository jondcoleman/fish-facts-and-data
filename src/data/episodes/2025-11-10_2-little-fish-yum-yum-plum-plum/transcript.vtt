00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:19.640
 Hi everyone, welcome to the second episode of Little Fish.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:25.640
 Little Fish is a show where we list your facts, things that you've sent in to thepodcast@qiu.com

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:32.040
 inbox Andy has sifted through them and he has found the very sweetest plums, sent them

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.720
 over to the rest of us and we're going to go through them today and chat about them.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:37.720
 Are they true?

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:38.720
 Are they not true?

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.800
 Do we know more about the subject?

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.920
 Have we never heard of any of these words before in our life?

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.560
 We will see as we move on.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.840
 So who is going to do the first fight?

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.560
 It can't be me because I did the intro.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:50.560
 It has to be one of you two.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:56.920
 I'll go on, I'll throw a plum your way then, jump in, let's see how sweet you find it.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:04.000
 Yum yum, plum plum, my face, sorry.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.240
 One of these days, one of these catchphrases will pay our handy and everyone will be

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.360
 saying yum yum plum plum, it'll be the new six seven.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:20.440
 You'll see James when I'm opening nightclubs around the country shouting yum yum plum plum.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.760
 Okay, this is from the unimprovably named Nathan Gallimore Strong.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.960
 I think friend of this parish, I think we may have heard from him before.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.960
 But he says, "The windiest place in the UK is the butt of Lewis."

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.040
 That's it, thanks Nathan.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:41.640
 There you go and it's basically, it's on the Isle of Lewis, Lewis and Harris, and the

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.440
 butt is on a very, very northern tip of Lewis and during this trip he also wrote his first

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:52.080
 finicular railway, so congratulations Nathan, it's a little bit contentious this fact, I

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.080
 did do some follow up.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.920
 I always thought it was further north, so is it Cape Rath or something that's in the far

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:59.920
 north of Scotland?

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.680
 I always thought that was the windiest place.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.080
 Well, I think on average, Shetland is windier.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.200
 Oh yeah, so it's been, the butt of Lewis has been named by the Guinness Book of Records

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.560
 a few years ago, so they have their methodology.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:18.920
 I still consider Shetland to be part of Denmark, because you have well controversial political

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.480
 opinion, and if you're listening Danes, is it Denmark on Norway?

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:30.040
 There was one of them where we got it as maybe a dowry or something from some Scandinavian

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.680
 country, but the rules were that they were allowed to buy it back at any stage, like when

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.320
 we first got out of it, Shetland or ARKV, they said, "Yeah, you can have it, but as soon as

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.680
 we can get 12 marks together, we're going to buy it back."

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.080
 I think it's still true that, in theory, they could buy it back if they want to.

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.080
 Really?

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.080
 To know that.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.080
 Okay.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.600
 Well, so if you're listening Vikings, get the money together.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.600
 How windy?

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.600
 How windy is this?

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:58.400
 It's really windy.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.800
 The thing is, how do you measure how windy something is?

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.160
 Is it average speed over the year?

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.360
 Maybe for me now, because I live by sea side, I could judge it.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:15.160
 If I saw where Margate lives on a list, then I think I could then judge it by personal experience.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.760
 Yeah, yeah, because it's quite windy where you are.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:17.760
 Oh, it's wild.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.400
 The wind in Margate is insane.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.600
 And it comes out of nowhere.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.200
 We have this amazing...

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.080
 You can't see it coming.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.680
 We were sitting one time at Margate.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.400
 There's these things which are called the steps that go onto the beach and you often

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.400
 skate.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.840
 Lots of beaches out there, Dutch out of all these things called the steps.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.080
 If you've ever been to Rome, they have a Margate tribute, which is called the Spanner Steps.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.080
 Do they?

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.080
 Oh, there you go.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.120
 See, yeah, it's coming out Margate.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.920
 So we were sitting on what felt like a normal day and we were with our neighbours.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.760
 These seagulls get coming and eating our fish and chips.

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.480
 And Chloe did this thing where she picked up the final few chips and she threw them out

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:57.480
 to the ocean.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.320
 And just at that moment, this giant gust of wind came, blew the chips to the left, right

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:09.640
 onto a couple that were kissing on the steps and about 12 seagulls just darted into them.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.640
 She had to run after them, go, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, they were literally being

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.400
 attacked by these goals.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.400
 Is that a true story?

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.400
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.400
 Yeah.

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.400
 So one of my favourite moments.

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.400
 In fact, I have a photo.

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.400
 Well, that might...

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.400
 Damn, that sounds very windy.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.520
 Yeah, so that's how I'd be able to tell.

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:31.880
 But the strongest gust ever recorded in the UK was at Cairn Gorms Summit in 1986, which

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.760
 was a mountain in the Highlands, which was 173 miles an hour.

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:37.760
 Woo!

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.240
 I think that's the strongest any gust.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:44.000
 Any individual gust has been recorded, but I think in general, it's normally Shetland that

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 is the windiest on average.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 I believe.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 Yeah, imagine.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000
 I know.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 I know.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.040
 You'd be lifted off into the air when you'd be lifted off in the air.

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.040
 Oh, yeah.

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.800
 Don't wear your big coat.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.120
 Thank you, Nathan.

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.120
 Yeah, great fact.

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.120
 Great fact.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:06.560
 Who's a fact from Josh Glendening, who says, "A soldier who spent too long on the toilet

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:11.160
 because of an upset stomach caused the start of World War II?"

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.400
 So do we know about this incident?

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.400
 No.

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:18.360
 Okay, this was called the Marco Polo Bridge incident, it was 1937, often considered to be the

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:23.920
 start of the Second Sino-Japanese War, which then evolved into World War II.

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:30.080
 And so the story goes that in the 1930s, Japan had invaded and put it in a puppet government

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.080
 and named it Manchuria.

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.080
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.080
 Yeah.

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:39.080
 So in July 1937, there was a Japanese private, Shumura Kikojuro, who was stationed near the bridge,

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.640
 and he went missing.

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:47.240
 So a few soldiers accused the Chinese military of having taken him and were holding him hostage.

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:51.200
 And so they started climbing over the walls to find him.

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:56.080
 They started asking questions and getting a bit of an aggressive response.

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.840
 And it just kind of built up tensions.

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:02.680
 Meanwhile, the soldier comes back after a while, saying, "Sorry, my stomach was gone.

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.560
 I had to dip into the forest and just relieve myself."

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:11.400
 And in that time, enough of a fight started that it went into a full-blown war.

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:12.400
 War.

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:16.200
 I just feel like we've missed one or two steps here.

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:17.200
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.680
 I mean, it's probably some political things happening.

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.160
 There were a few political things.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:25.480
 Also, there's another theory that he was visiting a brothel that he hadn't gone to the toilet.

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:26.480
 Yeah.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:30.200
 And a lot of historians, but this has been pooped by a lot of historians.

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.200
 P pooped?

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:32.200
 It's very good.

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:37.120
 It's the idea that this was staged, so he was told to go away so that they could pretend

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.680
 he was missing so that they could find an excuse to go in.

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:41.680
 But so, yeah.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:45.000
 I've heard this story before, and I think it rings relatively true.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.440
 The basics are true, aren't they?

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:47.440
 Only.

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:49.120
 I read a couple of years ago.

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.960
 I read Surah Anthony Beaver's History of the Second World War.

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:52.960
 How did he mention it?

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.800
 He says this is the exclusive course.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:56.800
 Does he?

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:57.800
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.600
 It says everything else would have been absolutely fine.

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:01.600
 And yeah.

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.840
 There were two chapters on this guy's dodgy tummy.

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:04.840
 That's right.

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:05.840
 Just a little bit.

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:07.840
 And then there was a skirmish.

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:11.600
 Does he go into the Sino-Japanese, or does he start in 1939?

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:12.600
 Oh, no.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:17.280
 He goes into extraordinary detail about the whole global nature of it.

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:18.280
 Yeah.

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:19.280
 It starts with a soldier actually.

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:22.760
 Page one is about the soldier who I think he was.

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:27.360
 And career, or he gets drafted into the Japanese army when they invade.

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:31.960
 And then Japan locks horns with China, and then he's taken prisoner after some fight by

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:36.480
 the Russians, and then he ends up serving in three or four different armies, always being

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:38.320
 pressed into a different army over the course of the war.

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.040
 It's an absolute nightmare scenario for him.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:43.720
 And he's used as an example of how this war affected absolutely everyone.

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:44.720
 Yeah.

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:47.880
 But his account is sort of grimly funny.

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:48.880
 Wow.

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:51.680
 And then he was taken prisoner by the Russians, and it just goes on and on and on.

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:52.680
 Right.

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:53.680
 Yeah.

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:54.960
 Like the forest gump of war.

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:55.960
 I suppose so.

00:07:55.960 --> 00:08:00.840
 And this guy, your private, don't was taking a forest dump.

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:03.400
 That's why you get the big bugs, Adi.

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:04.400
 Yum, yum.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:05.400
 Plum, plum.

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:14.960
 Okay, my first fight comes from Ian Jones, and he says, "I am a pediatric surgeon."

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.760
 That's not his fight.

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:20.480
 His fight is about the Fanon Steel incision.

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:21.480
 You gave me a load of German.

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:27.800
 You gave me just some German ones last week as well, and the German is not my first, second,

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:31.680
 third, or indeed a hundred and ninety-third language.

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:34.320
 But this incision is one that this person did.

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:39.080
 It's basically, it's the most common way of doing a cesarean, but you'd use it for some

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:40.320
 other surgery down there.

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:46.040
 But it's in the shape of a panhandle, and it's on the bikini line, and it gives you good

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:49.040
 access to the pelvis and stuff like that.

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:57.200
 Now the incision is called Fanon Steel, because Fanon Steel in German means Panhandle, okay?

00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:06.080
 But the surgeon who first described it was called Herman Johannes Fanon Steel.

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:12.920
 So he invented it, it has the same name as him, but according to him, it's named after

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:14.880
 the fact that it's the shape of a panhandle.

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:20.840
 Now Ian Jones' personal theory, which I agree, is that he deliberately drew the incision

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:26.560
 in the shape of a panhandle so that he could name it after himself.

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:28.280
 People do do this sometimes, don't they?

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:31.000
 Wasn't there an element of the period at Gallium?

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
 Gallium, and it was named after a guy who's...

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.080
 So he said that he named it after France, because it's gold.

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:45.840
 But actually, I think he was called Le Coc, or something similar, which is chicken, and

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:48.440
 Gallus Gallus is the Latin for chicken.

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:49.440
 That's it, that's it.

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:55.560
 So yeah, like people do do it, and to be honest, it's such a coincidence, I've never seen

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:57.480
 the word Fanon Steel before.

00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:02.040
 I mean, what if actually the surgery would be much better and easier to conduct if it was

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:04.840
 a completely different shape that doesn't look like a panhandle?

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:05.840
 Yes.

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:09.800
 It could be that, you know, all these years, people who are having caissarians are having

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:12.120
 the wrong shape just because of his...

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:13.480
 Well, we should look into that.

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:14.480
 That's insane.

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:15.480
 That's really...

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:16.480
 That's a really good fact.

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:17.480
 That's very good.

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:18.480
 And great theory.

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:20.800
 I can give you more on surgeons.

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:21.800
 Yeah.

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:22.800
 Yeah, go on.

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:28.080
 John Casimir Félix Guillon was born in Rayunion.

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:33.640
 He came up with a new way of removing bloodestones through the paradigm, but he's more famous

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:38.320
 for being the probable inspiration for this song Frerajacca.

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:39.320
 No way!

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:40.320
 Wow.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:41.800
 My little one sings that nonstop at the moment.

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:45.240
 Did they know that it's about removing bloodestones through the paradigm?

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:47.880
 No, but we never get to the third version of the song, so...

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:50.400
 So what are the lines of your Frerajacca, Frerajacca?

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:51.400
 Dormaboo.

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:52.400
 Dormaboo.

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:53.400
 Sonema, Matina.

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:54.400
 Sonema, Matina.

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:55.880
 Ding, dang, dong, ding, dang, dong.

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:56.880
 So is that...

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:59.640
 We've had a patient come in complaining of severe...

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:03.120
 It's the sound of the bloodestones falling into the pan.

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:06.400
 It's the ding, dang, dong.

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:07.400
 Good.

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:08.400
 Good.

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:09.400
 Wow.

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:16.880
 Is the perineum, the bit in between the genital and the other genital opening?

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:18.520
 What's the grondal?

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:21.000
 It might just be you, Dan.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.480
 I thought that was another term for that, OK?

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:24.960
 I've never come across that.

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:25.960
 Have you not?

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:31.040
 So the band that does our theme tune and pre-yes, Ash, who wrote our song and sings the song,

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:33.040
 he was originally in a band called Grondal.

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:36.160
 And I'm pretty sure it was too much to...

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:37.160
 Wow.

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:38.160
 Is Aussie slang?

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:39.160
 No, no, no, no.

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:42.240
 All right, Mr. Shriver, let's get you up on the chair and just have a quick look at the

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:43.240
 grondal, sir.

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:46.440
 Oh, you got a bad case of the Frerajac, is there, mate?

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:48.520
 Dan, let's have another fact.

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:49.520
 OK.

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:53.560
 Here's not so much a fact, but a great pub quiz question.

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:54.560
 All right.

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:56.160
 So this is from John Dunn.

00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:02.000
 He says, "My favourite pub, the Metrophysical Poet."

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.960
 He says, "My favourite pub quiz question is, and here's a question now, and I'm going to

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:13.240
 ask it to you too, what are furthest north, south, east, and west states of the United States?"

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:14.240
 Come on, mate.

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:15.240
 Yeah, you're OK.

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:16.240
 I think I was born yesterday.

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:17.240
 All right.

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:18.480
 So let's start with south.

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:19.920
 What's the...

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:21.160
 What's the...

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:22.160
 Softest?

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:23.160
 Softest.

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:24.160
 Um...

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:25.120
 I'm going to say Dakota.

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.120
 You have to go to...

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:27.120
 No.

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:35.720
 It's a trick question.

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:36.720
 OK.

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:38.720
 Well, for me, it has to be North Carolina.

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:39.720
 OK.

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:41.400
 No, it must be Hawaii.

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:42.400
 It is Hawaii.

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:43.400
 Oh, very good.

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:44.400
 Correct.

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:48.160
 What is the north-fist state?

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:49.160
 No.

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:52.600
 I think that has to be South Dakota.

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:58.120
 OK, playing seriously for a second, I'll say Alaska.

00:12:58.120 --> 00:12:59.120
 Correct.

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:00.120
 It is Alaska.

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:01.120
 It is, that is correct.

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:02.120
 OK.

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:03.120
 So, one each.

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:04.120
 Yep.

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:05.120
 Westest.

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:07.120
 Westest.

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:08.360
 I would say Alaska.

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:09.360
 Alaska.

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:10.360
 Correct.

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:11.360
 It is Alaska.

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:12.360
 Oh.

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:13.360
 Yeah.

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:14.360
 Interestingly, it's got north and west.

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:15.360
 Yeah.

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:16.360
 So, OK.

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:18.880
 That's two, one, but you probably might have said the same.

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:19.880
 I would.

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:21.520
 And also, I'm going to get the next one right.

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:22.520
 OK.

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:26.160
 So, I'll get this one to Andy.

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:27.200
 Most Eastest.

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:33.040
 I feel like it's going to be a trick, but I'll say--

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:34.040
 West Virginia.

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:35.040
 West Virginia.

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:36.040
 Yeah.

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:39.960
 No, I'll say one of those ones over on the far right-hand side.

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:40.960
 I'll say Rhode Island.

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:41.960
 Rhode Island.

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:42.960
 Incorrect.

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:43.960
 James.

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:46.880
 I'm going to say it's Alaska again.

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:47.880
 Correct.

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:49.880
 I'll see Aleutian Islands go over the international date life.

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:50.880
 I'll have to say.

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:51.880
 Yeah.

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:52.880
 Is that amazing?

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:53.880
 South of the only one.

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:55.880
 Hawaii that is not claimed by Alaska.

00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:59.280
 So, north, east, west are all Alaska.

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:00.280
 Yeah.

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:01.280
 OK.

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:02.280
 Here's one.

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:09.880
 Kathy Oliver from Ontario, which is at least in the same hemisphere as most of Alaska.

00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:14.680
 She said, my husband and I love your podcast, and it keeps us entertained on drives to my various

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:19.440
 treatments over the last two years, which leads me to a fact idea for you when you get

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:25.560
 to stem cell transplant, you will stink of creamed corn for a couple of days.

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:26.560
 Wow.

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:27.560
 OK.

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:33.680
 So, the stem cells are frozen using a substance called dimethyl sulfoxide, the MSO, and it stops

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:40.080
 them from getting damaged, but it has this peculiar odor that smells to most people like

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:41.080
 creamed corn.

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:47.760
 The MSO actually is very pungent, but to such an extent that you can taste it by touching

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:48.760
 it.

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:53.360
 It had a Petri dish of the MSO now, and you put your finger in it, you'd be able to taste

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:54.360
 it.

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:55.360
 Wow.

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:59.200
 And that's because it directly triggers the nerves that normally react to taste.

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:00.200
 That's insane.

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:01.200
 Yeah.

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:02.200
 That's absolutely insane.

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:03.840
 How many different foods does that work with?

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:05.200
 This is not a food.

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:06.200
 OK.

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:09.400
 This is a chemical, and I don't know of any food stuff.

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:13.360
 I guess garlic could do it like that, maybe, because that seems to go through your skin,

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:14.360
 but that's just, I guess.

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:15.360
 I mean, I don't know.

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:16.360
 The theory about that.

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:18.200
 I don't remember you walking around with an onion in your salt to see if you could taste

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:19.200
 it.

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:20.200
 It's your research.

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:21.200
 Yeah, yeah.

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:23.280
 I've got two pictures for you off the back of this.

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:24.280
 Oh, yeah.

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:27.120
 So number one, there should be a Googleful smells.

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:28.440
 That should just be a Googleful smells.

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:33.680
 How do you, what do you, what do you search as in what do you tie, you're not typing.

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:34.680
 You're not typing.

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:37.680
 Well, you're typing with your nose.

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:41.160
 So what do you put in that you're trying to find like, I haven't worked out all the

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:42.160
 details yet.

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:44.760
 Is it like shazam instead of a phone?

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:50.920
 You hold a giant nose, that's the area where you are and it goes, hmm, it's crumpets.

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:52.320
 That's exactly what it is.

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:53.320
 Very nice.

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:54.320
 Okay, brilliant.

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:55.320
 That's good.

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:56.320
 Right.

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:57.320
 We solved that one.

00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:58.320
 Well, I feel like I came up with that idea.

00:15:58.320 --> 00:15:59.320
 Really.

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:00.320
 Like, we were on the room.

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:01.320
 Three-way split.

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:02.320
 Really great.

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:03.320
 Great work, everyone.

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:04.800
 See you for the first set of quarterly results.

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:05.800
 Okay.

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:08.520
 So second idea off the back of that, the touch restaurant, right?

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:12.240
 You don't eat anything, but you just go in and you put your fingers through holes

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:16.080
 in the table into various different foods that you can then taste.

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:17.080
 Yeah.

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:18.080
 Right.

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:24.320
 Okay, but the only thing on the menu is DMSO so far, so far, maybe some garlic.

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:26.440
 But you've got to wear it for a month.

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:29.800
 But I think that will be good if we can find enough foods that you can taste through your

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:30.800
 fingertips.

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:31.800
 Yeah.

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:32.800
 That would be awesome.

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:34.560
 I've got to say, I'm in on the shazam nose.

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:37.240
 Andy, I'll let you develop this a bit more before committing.

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:40.880
 I'm sharing it with you guys three ways no matter what, including the debts.

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:41.880
 Okay.

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:48.600
 I just want to say to everyone listening to this, I'm happy to share my shazam nose with

00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:50.840
 everyone who's listening to this.

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:55.640
 We can all have 0.0 1%, that's really generous.

00:16:55.640 --> 00:17:01.520
 But one of you listening will have to make it.

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:04.800
 Here's nice.

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:05.800
 Do you want to do another one?

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:06.800
 I'm the other one.

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:07.800
 Don't you want to jump in?

00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:09.960
 Yeah, I've got one here.

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:16.200
 So this is from Edward Maloy, who says this is their favorite fact, Norwich, is the only

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:18.920
 city in history to be excommunicated.

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:24.400
 In 1274, after a riot in the cathedral, Pope Gregory X excommunicated the entire city until

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:29.040
 they repented and repaired the damage done to church property.

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:34.920
 Clearly, it has had a lasting effect as Norwich is now the least religious city in England

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:36.400
 per the 2011 census.

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:38.400
 Is that right?

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:39.400
 Kind of right.

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:42.400
 So it's almost right.

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:47.120
 I didn't fully get an answer to the excommunication.

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:51.120
 But Norwich is very much not a religious city anymore.

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:54.160
 It's interesting because there's a saying about Norwich, which is that it has a church

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:57.200
 for every week of the year and a pub for every day.

00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:58.200
 So a lot of churches.

00:17:58.200 --> 00:17:59.720
 That must be Norfolk, right?

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:00.720
 There's no way.

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:01.720
 There's strings.

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:03.720
 52 churches in Norwich, 11.

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:04.720
 Maybe there is.

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:05.720
 Maybe.

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:06.720
 Yeah.

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:07.720
 Yeah, absolutely.

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:08.720
 I take that back.

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:11.560
 I don't think there's exactly 365 pubs either.

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:15.560
 But it's the L.A. of Norfolk, I would say, Norwich.

00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:16.560
 Right.

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:17.560
 Do you say so?

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:19.800
 It's the mega city of Norfolk, isn't it?

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:20.800
 Of Norfolk?

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:21.800
 Oh, yeah.

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:22.800
 There's Kingsland, of course.

00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:23.800
 Oh, yeah.

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:24.800
 Of course, there's Kingsland.

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:25.800
 That's fair.

00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:26.800
 There's Kingsland.

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:32.200
 Well, a census was done in 2021, and it showed that those who said that they don't have

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:35.800
 any religion, don't believe in any religion, was 53.5%.

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:36.800
 Wow.

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:46.760
 So 76,973 people, and that's a jump from a decade ago when it was 42.5, and that's 56,000

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:47.760
 people.

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:50.920
 So it's the second least religious city in the UK.

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:53.120
 Oh, I think I know this one.

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:54.120
 Town or city.

00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:55.120
 Yeah.

00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:56.120
 Isn't it?

00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:57.120
 It's somewhere called Satan.

00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:58.120
 Satan food.

00:18:58.120 --> 00:18:59.120
 What?

00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:00.120
 There's the least religious.

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:01.120
 That's not a city though.

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:02.120
 That's not a city though.

00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:03.120
 No, it's not a city.

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:04.120
 It's a parish, isn't it?

00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:05.120
 No.

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:06.120
 What?

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:09.800
 I think it's got an amusingly apt name, the least religious place in the UK, but I can't

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:10.800
 remember what the name is.

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:11.800
 I would have.

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:16.120
 Without knowing that little clue, I would have said most likely it would be somewhere like

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:20.800
 Brighton or Bristol, like somewhere where lots of cool young people live.

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:21.800
 So, yeah.

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:22.800
 Strongly secular.

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:23.800
 Hmm.

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:24.800
 Do you want to have another guest, Andy?

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:25.800
 James has it right.

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:26.800
 But do you want to have another guest?

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:27.800
 No.

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:28.800
 I'm going to stick with Satan food.

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:29.800
 I think.

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:30.800
 Okay.

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:31.800
 Brighton and Hope.

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:32.800
 Wow.

00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:37.120
 55.2% of people declaring no religion.

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:38.120
 Gosh.

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:39.120
 Yeah.

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:40.920
 Alistair Crowley had his funeral there.

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:41.920
 In Brighton.

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:42.920
 Yeah, it might have something to do with that.

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:43.920
 It is.

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:44.920
 Was he from that?

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:48.440
 No, but I think he passed away in Hastings and I think his body ended up in Brighton for

00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:49.440
 some reason.

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:50.440
 He was cremated there.

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:51.440
 Yeah.

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:52.440
 Not so far, is it?

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:53.440
 No.

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:54.440
 It's on the coast.

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:55.440
 Very windy.

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:56.440
 Is it?

00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:59.520
 Do you want to release those ashes and they're a couple making out?

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:00.680
 Here's one from me.

00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:05.760
 I already have a bone to pick with Andrew Hunter Murray, it's episode two and I already

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:09.080
 have a bone to pick because you sent us these facts.

00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:12.480
 And listen, think back to audience facts one.

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:17.280
 When I said, here's one from Wayne Height or is it Holt because it looks like it should

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:18.280
 be Holt?

00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:24.400
 Well, this week I have one from Wayne Holt, H-O-L-T.

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:28.400
 I assume it's the same person and I assume one of them is a misspelling.

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:30.480
 I've got to track.

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:37.040
 Although I did have a eyesight check yesterday and I need reading glasses so maybe you need

00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:38.040
 to check.

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:39.040
 Can you check?

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:40.040
 Is that a Height and a Holt?

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:42.040
 Yeah, it's a Height and a Holt.

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:43.040
 Right.

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:44.040
 Yeah.

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:45.040
 Okay.

00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:46.200
 Wayne does write in a few writes in frequently.

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:48.080
 We have a few frequent flies in the fishing box.

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:50.280
 Does he change his name every time you write it?

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:51.280
 I've got to track.

00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:56.600
 You've got to work on your pseudonyms, Wayne.

00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:57.840
 What's the fact, James?

00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:02.440
 Well, actually the fact is to do a spelling.

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:04.440
 Oh, no.

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:12.040
 The fact is that in concert the band Divo sometimes performed as their own opening act to pretending

00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:18.080
 to be a Christian soft rock band called Dove, the band of love, which is an anagram of

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:19.080
 Divo.

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:20.080
 Very nice.

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:21.080
 That's really good.

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:22.640
 I'm really sorry, James.

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:24.640
 They're both from Wayne Height.

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:25.880
 Wayne Holt doesn't exist.

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:27.520
 That's not a real person.

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:28.520
 I've mistyped his name.

00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:32.480
 There will be a Wayne Holt out there if you're listening, Wayne.

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:34.240
 Well, how's Wayne going to solve the situation?

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:36.120
 Wayne's only going to confuse matters.

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:37.120
 Yeah.

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:40.520
 If you happen to be listening to fish and you're called Wayne Holt, write in.

00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:41.520
 Yeah.

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:42.520
 Let us know you exist.

00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:43.520
 Yeah.

00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:44.520
 Simple.

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:45.520
 Should I do one?

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:46.520
 Yeah.

00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:53.440
 This is from Jessica Eringayson from Texas and she writes that Napoleon and Lord Wellington

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:57.000
 are kind of related and it's America's fault.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.000
 Okay.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.640
 This is admittedly quite tenuous, but the story is is that Napoleon had a younger brother

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:08.880
 called Jerome who visited the US when he was in his late teens and he eloped with a lady

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:14.680
 called Elizabeth Patterson, then Napoleon wanted Jerome to come back and marry a European

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:19.440
 princess because it was part of his plan to consolidate power while he was conquesting

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:20.440
 territories.

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:21.440
 Right?

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:22.480
 So he brought Jerome back.

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:27.360
 Elizabeth stays, but then Elizabeth hops on a boat and Napoleon bans it from landing.

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:31.800
 So she has no choice but to go and port in London.

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:33.480
 So that's where she lands.

00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:37.440
 Jerome remarries and basically they never see each other again.

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:38.440
 Wow.

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:42.440
 Now, the tenuous link that we've been given here from Jessica is that while she was in

00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:45.320
 London, she was living with a lady called Marianne.

00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:47.160
 Marianne was her sister-in-law.

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:51.880
 Marianne's husband dies and she remarries Richard Wellesley, who's the elder brother of Arthur

00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:54.720
 Wellesley, who defeat Napoleon at Waterloo.

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:55.720
 Good Lord.

00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:56.720
 Yeah.

00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:58.720
 It's more world, isn't it?

00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:03.760
 I've signed to think it's a slightly bigger world than I was imagining.

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:04.760
 Okay.

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:06.640
 I mean, I was lost so long ago.

00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:07.640
 Yeah.

00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:09.240
 It's just about clung on till the end.

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:10.240
 I tell you what, though.

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:13.120
 I did recently visit the room where Wellington died.

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:14.120
 Did you?

00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:15.120
 Yeah.

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:16.120
 I went down to Walma Castle in Kent.

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:17.600
 Oh, it's a good day out.

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:18.600
 Hmm.

00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:19.600
 It's really good.

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:20.600
 It's a proper castle.

00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:21.600
 It's 400 years old.

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:24.440
 It's not one of these sort of plastic castles that you get these days, you know, sort of like fake

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:26.440
 castles, which is just to state the home with a view.

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:27.440
 That's Disneyland.

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:28.440
 Disneyland.

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:29.440
 It's not Disneyland.

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:30.440
 It's no, it's proper.

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:34.480
 And they had, there's a thing called being the Wharton of the Sync Ports.

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:36.480
 It looks like it's Sank, French or five, but it's not.

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:37.480
 It's Wharton of the Sync Ports.

00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:38.480
 That's how it's done.

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:39.480
 But it does mean five, right?

00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:40.480
 There were five pots.

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:43.600
 It does mean five, and it's spelled like the French or five, but it is, I swear to God,

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:45.440
 they pronounce it Wharton of the Sync Ports.

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:46.440
 Okay.

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:47.440
 I swear.

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:51.000
 And it said to the lady, nice to be visiting the Sank Ports, she said Sank Ports.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.920
 Anyway, she probably said that a hundred times a day for 20 years.

00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:56.680
 You don't want to be calling your pot Sank anyway.

00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:58.320
 You're absolutely right.

00:23:58.320 --> 00:23:59.800
 It's a crazy choice.

00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:03.800
 But there is this honorary possession called Wharton of the Sync Ports, and Wellington

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:04.800
 was that.

00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:05.800
 So was the Queen Mum.

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:10.080
 The old Queen Mum, and actually, when I visited, they had a Queen Mum lookalike there

00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:11.080
 for the day.

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:12.080
 Did they?

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:13.080
 Yeah.

00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:14.080
 Along with the kind of...

00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:15.080
 That kind of work must be dry enough a bit.

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:20.000
 Well, I made this sort of casual joke about Jen, and she looks so disapproving.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.440
 Because you know, the Queen Mum, she loved her Jen.

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:23.440
 She liked to drink.

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:24.440
 I can't, Andy.

00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:26.440
 This was a tough day for you.

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:31.000
 First of all, you walk in and mispronounce Sank Ports, and then you make a perfectly harmless

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.680
 joke about Jen, so the Queen Mum lookalike.

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:35.880
 And then I find out Wellington's dead.

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:38.760
 It was awful.

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:42.960
 It was terrible, but no, it's a really evocative ring, because they've got this tiny bed.

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:47.120
 There's this camp bed, there's a military camp bed that is still there from the day he died,

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:51.680
 and he must have died in about 1850, but he took this bed with him wherever he went.

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:56.040
 When he went up to London to be the Prime Minister, that military camp bed went with him.

00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:57.040
 How interesting.

00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:00.960
 He slept in that bed in Downing Street, and then when he became warden with the Sank Ports,

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:04.040
 he brought the bed back to Warmer Castle, and that's the bed where he died.

00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:09.000
 I went to the place where Napoleon surrendered, which is in France somewhere.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.680
 Is it Ilderae or somewhere?

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:11.680
 I can't remember.

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:14.480
 I yield to France, yield to Ilderae, something like that.

00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:20.280
 I might be misremembering this, but I seem to remember that he had quite a non-onate bed

00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:21.760
 as well.

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:28.360
 I remember being there and thinking, "Wow, for someone who's so important in history,

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:29.360
 what a shit bed."

00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:30.360
 These military beds.

00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:34.560
 I think it's the military like they used to the campaigning lifestyle.

00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:37.600
 I saw the bed that Abraham Lincoln died in.

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:38.600
 Really?

00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:41.600
 It's when we were in DC.

00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:45.440
 We had a bit of time off, because he was shot in the fourth theatre, but then he was taken

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:46.880
 to a house, not too far away.

00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:50.280
 He could just need a little nap, and I'd go, "That's all right."

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:51.280
 Just butterscotch.

00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:57.560
 No, they brought it to a house, and so he died in a bed that was, his legs were hanging

00:25:57.560 --> 00:25:58.560
 off the edge, basically.

00:25:58.560 --> 00:25:59.560
 He was tall.

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:03.520
 He was super tall, and the bed was quite small, and you can visit his bed.

00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:04.520
 You can visit this.

00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:05.520
 Yeah.

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:06.520
 Okay.

00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:07.520
 Here we are.

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:08.520
 Okay.

00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:14.360
 We sell replica beds of the great beds of history, and we're going to clean up on the finance

00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:17.640
 bros who want to think that they're living like Napoleon or Wellington.

00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:18.640
 Or Lincoln.

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:23.160
 I mean, those are three perfect examples of beds of the greats, right?

00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:24.160
 Yes.

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:28.280
 Like, you too can conquer Europe with our £9,000 bed.

00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:29.280
 Yeah.

00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:30.280
 Yeah.

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:31.280
 And we'll just sell them in military campbed.

00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:32.280
 What do you think?

00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:33.280
 I love it.

00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:34.280
 Okay.

00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:35.280
 All right.

00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:39.680
 We're going to have not point, not, not one percent.

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:40.680
 Okay.

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:44.800
 So I think that's enough facts for the day that we've been sent in, but we still have one

00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:45.800
 more thing to do.

00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:50.360
 And that is to name some custodians of the archive.

00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:56.640
 So anyone who is in our top tier on Patreon becomes a custodian of a fact from no such thing

00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:57.640
 as a fish.

00:26:57.640 --> 00:26:58.640
 It's very exciting.

00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:00.200
 I'm a custodian myself.

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:05.200
 If you'd remember listening back to episode one of this little fish, but there will

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:07.480
 be more custodians names today.

00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:11.920
 We will tell you your name, which you might already know.

00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:14.740
 And then we'll tell you the fact that you're the custodian of.

00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:21.120
 So Andrew, who is going to be our first nonfish member who is a custodian of a fish fact?

00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:23.320
 I just want to say that was incredibly slick jokes.

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:28.040
 And the concept of the shout out is clearly very well embedded in your head.

00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:30.800
 First up today for a shout out is Rachel Not.

00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:36.440
 And her fact is the first ever sandwich that we know about contained wine.

00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:37.440
 Congratulations, Rachel.

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:38.440
 Yes.

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:39.960
 That is now your fact forever.

00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:41.200
 Bill out of the elder.

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:42.200
 Is it?

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:43.200
 Bill out?

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:44.200
 Bill out?

00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:45.200
 Yes, something.

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:46.200
 Bill out.

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:47.600
 And it was, um, it was more of a wrap.

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:48.600
 It was more of a wrap.

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:52.480
 It had like, um, currency or something, right?

00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:53.480
 It sounds delicious.

00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:54.480
 Yeah.

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:55.480
 I think we said this at the time.

00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:56.480
 11 years ago.

00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:57.480
 Perfect covered on the show.

00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:58.480
 Anyway, yeah.

00:27:58.480 --> 00:27:59.480
 Rachel, that's your fact.

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:03.160
 And the sandwich is in the out of sandwich who we just covered again a week or two ago in

00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:04.160
 recorded.

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:05.160
 Yes, we did, of course.

00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:06.560
 Well, we're on a big wheel, aren't we?

00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:07.560
 We are.

00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:08.560
 Dan, have you got one?

00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:09.560
 Uh, yeah.

00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:14.160
 This is a fact that is now going to belong to Silas Gill.

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:19.680
 And that is in 2003, three people in Mexico died of acne.

00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:20.680
 Oh.

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:21.680
 Oh.

00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:25.440
 If you put a gun to my head and said, you've got a thousand guesses as to the Christian

00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:29.120
 name of the second ever person to become a friend of the podcast.

00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:31.800
 Silas would have not been one of my thousand guesses.

00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:32.800
 No.

00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:33.800
 It's just a terrific name.

00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:38.560
 Because I think these in order of the people who signed up so literally, I think Rachel and

00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:45.040
 Silas had to have had the hand hovering over the Patreon button as the time struck midnight.

00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:46.040
 Yeah.

00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:47.040
 Wow.

00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:51.680
 And we should say Silas isn't especially fish friendly name, Silas Marna, by friend of the

00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:52.680
 podcast.

00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:53.680
 Samuel Taylor Colouridge.

00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:54.680
 You're jelly-ed.

00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:55.680
 That's right.

00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:58.760
 Um, okay.

00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:03.520
 So the third custodian this week, this is a Dan Schreiber fact.

00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:10.160
 And the fact is that amongst the other scientists called Einstein, there are M E Einstein who came

00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:17.640
 up with a formula for predicting the composition of a pork carcass and rosemary Einstein who co-investigated

00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:24.440
 the use of cannabis, alcohol and tobacco on 300 young persons at her university.

00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:25.440
 Could have done with it.

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:26.440
 That it done.

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:28.680
 We're going to need a bigger certificate.

00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:34.920
 But drumroll, that fact now is under the custodianship of Helen Cosgrove Davis.

00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:35.920
 Actually.

00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:36.920
 There he is.

00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:37.920
 Nice.

00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:38.920
 That was a great episode.

00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:42.520
 That was a fact I took from a Mark Abrams book of the ignoble prizes who James and I are going

00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:43.520
 to be seeing tomorrow.

00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:44.520
 He's in London.

00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:45.520
 Well, a lot of it will.

00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:46.520
 Yeah.

00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:50.680
 Along with Kate Smollaker who did the paper about the first case of homosexual necrophilia

00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:51.680
 in the Maladduck.

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:55.120
 Yep. And who raised awareness for pubic lice because they might be going extinct.

00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:57.560
 It's going to be a spicy lunch tomorrow.

00:29:57.560 --> 00:29:58.560
 Oh.

00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:01.520
 As long as he's not cooking, I don't really mind.

00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:03.520
 Oh, congratulations, Helen.

00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:07.600
 That's the longest fact that's become custodian so far.

00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:09.560
 Until the next damn fact.

00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:12.960
 Shall I round us off with one more?

00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:13.960
 Yeah, go on there.

00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:14.960
 All right.

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:18.920
 This is a fact that is now under the stewardship of Darcy.

00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:19.920
 Mr. Darcy.

00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:22.800
 I can only assume fits William, if you're listening.

00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:23.800
 Congratulations.

00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:28.840
 And it's one of my facts is that the first contact lenses cost as much as a car.

00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:33.880
 Yes, you went to the museum, didn't you, to see the British Optical Association Museum.

00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:38.600
 Those were the days where we used to do proper research.

00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:39.600
 Episode two.

00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:40.600
 Quickly under that.

00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:41.600
 Yeah.

00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:42.600
 Although we're on a big wheel.

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:43.600
 I went back there recently.

00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:44.600
 No.

00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:45.600
 For a party.

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:46.600
 Yeah.

00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:47.600
 Yeah.

00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:48.600
 They were finishing their refurbishment of the museum.

00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:49.600
 It's really good.

00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:52.720
 They were the datesment of the headquarters of the British Optical Association.

00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:57.840
 And they invited some celebs along and they also know so they invited me.

00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:01.480
 Well, who are the other big celebs who are at the party?

00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:02.480
 I can't name names.

00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:03.480
 I'm sorry.

00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:06.440
 It's very much an eyes-wide shot situation, everyone was in masks.

00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:08.560
 Ironically, considering they're optometrists.

00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:09.560
 Brilliant.

00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:13.160
 Does everyone wear masks in an eyes-wide shot?

00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:14.160
 They do.

00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:15.160
 Okay, good.

00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:16.160
 In sodium scenes, not the whole way through.

00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:17.160
 Yeah.

00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:19.160
 That was very much a reach of a reference for me.

00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:21.440
 You know when you try and do a reference or something, but you know.

00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:24.200
 You mean like when you say Samuel Taylor Coleridge wrote...

00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:25.200
 Silas Marner.

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:26.200
 Silas Marner.

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:27.200
 Yep.

00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:28.200
 Exactly.

00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:29.200
 Exactly.

00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:31.800
 Because the thing is normally in a podcast, I would say that and then I cut it out because

00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:32.800
 I knew I got it wrong.

00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:33.800
 Yeah.

00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:34.800
 Because I check it later.

00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:35.800
 Yeah.

00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:37.720
 But I've referenced it twice now, so it's going to have to stay in.

00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:39.600
 You've really shot yourself in the third.

00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:40.600
 Okay.

00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:41.600
 Well, they are.

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:44.520
 The next four custodians of facts in the nose, such things as fish, archive.

00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:46.160
 Read the names again, Andy.

00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:47.160
 It's Rachel Not.

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:49.640
 It's Gilles, Helen Colesgrove Davis and Darcy.
