00:00:00,00:00:19,"Hi everyone, welcome to the second episode of Little Fish."
00:00:19,00:00:25,"Little Fish is a show where we list your facts, things that you've sent in to thepodcast@qiu.com"
00:00:25,00:00:32,"inbox Andy has sifted through them and he has found the very sweetest plums, sent them"
00:00:32,00:00:36,over to the rest of us and we're going to go through them today and chat about them.
00:00:36,00:00:37,Are they true?
00:00:37,00:00:38,Are they not true?
00:00:38,00:00:40,Do we know more about the subject?
00:00:40,00:00:43,Have we never heard of any of these words before in our life?
00:00:43,00:00:45,We will see as we move on.
00:00:45,00:00:47,So who is going to do the first fight?
00:00:47,00:00:49,It can't be me because I did the intro.
00:00:49,00:00:50,It has to be one of you two.
00:00:50,00:00:56,"I'll go on, I'll throw a plum your way then, jump in, let's see how sweet you find it."
00:00:56,00:01:04,"Yum yum, plum plum, my face, sorry."
00:01:04,00:01:08,"One of these days, one of these catchphrases will pay our handy and everyone will be"
00:01:08,00:01:13,"saying yum yum plum plum, it'll be the new six seven."
00:01:13,00:01:20,You'll see James when I'm opening nightclubs around the country shouting yum yum plum plum.
00:01:20,00:01:24,"Okay, this is from the unimprovably named Nathan Gallimore Strong."
00:01:24,00:01:28,"I think friend of this parish, I think we may have heard from him before."
00:01:28,00:01:32,"But he says, ""The windiest place in the UK is the butt of Lewis."""
00:01:32,00:01:35,"That's it, thanks Nathan."
00:01:35,00:01:41,"There you go and it's basically, it's on the Isle of Lewis, Lewis and Harris, and the"
00:01:41,00:01:46,"butt is on a very, very northern tip of Lewis and during this trip he also wrote his first"
00:01:46,00:01:52,"finicular railway, so congratulations Nathan, it's a little bit contentious this fact, I"
00:01:52,00:01:53,did do some follow up.
00:01:53,00:01:58,"I always thought it was further north, so is it Cape Rath or something that's in the far"
00:01:58,00:01:59,north of Scotland?
00:01:59,00:02:01,I always thought that was the windiest place.
00:02:01,00:02:05,"Well, I think on average, Shetland is windier."
00:02:05,00:02:09,"Oh yeah, so it's been, the butt of Lewis has been named by the Guinness Book of Records"
00:02:09,00:02:12,"a few years ago, so they have their methodology."
00:02:12,00:02:18,"I still consider Shetland to be part of Denmark, because you have well controversial political"
00:02:18,00:02:23,"opinion, and if you're listening Danes, is it Denmark on Norway?"
00:02:23,00:02:30,There was one of them where we got it as maybe a dowry or something from some Scandinavian
00:02:30,00:02:35,"country, but the rules were that they were allowed to buy it back at any stage, like when"
00:02:35,00:02:40,"we first got out of it, Shetland or ARKV, they said, ""Yeah, you can have it, but as soon as"
00:02:40,00:02:44,"we can get 12 marks together, we're going to buy it back."""
00:02:44,00:02:48,"I think it's still true that, in theory, they could buy it back if they want to."
00:02:48,00:02:49,Really?
00:02:49,00:02:50,To know that.
00:02:50,00:02:51,Okay.
00:02:51,00:02:55,"Well, so if you're listening Vikings, get the money together."
00:02:55,00:02:56,How windy?
00:02:56,00:02:57,How windy is this?
00:02:57,00:02:58,It's really windy.
00:02:58,00:03:02,"The thing is, how do you measure how windy something is?"
00:03:02,00:03:05,Is it average speed over the year?
00:03:05,00:03:09,"Maybe for me now, because I live by sea side, I could judge it."
00:03:09,00:03:15,"If I saw where Margate lives on a list, then I think I could then judge it by personal experience."
00:03:15,00:03:16,"Yeah, yeah, because it's quite windy where you are."
00:03:16,00:03:17,"Oh, it's wild."
00:03:17,00:03:19,The wind in Margate is insane.
00:03:19,00:03:20,And it comes out of nowhere.
00:03:20,00:03:22,We have this amazing...
00:03:22,00:03:27,You can't see it coming.
00:03:27,00:03:28,We were sitting one time at Margate.
00:03:28,00:03:31,There's these things which are called the steps that go onto the beach and you often
00:03:31,00:03:32,skate.
00:03:32,00:03:36,"Lots of beaches out there, Dutch out of all these things called the steps."
00:03:36,00:03:40,"If you've ever been to Rome, they have a Margate tribute, which is called the Spanner Steps."
00:03:40,00:03:41,Do they?
00:03:41,00:03:42,"Oh, there you go."
00:03:42,00:03:44,"See, yeah, it's coming out Margate."
00:03:44,00:03:48,So we were sitting on what felt like a normal day and we were with our neighbours.
00:03:48,00:03:51,These seagulls get coming and eating our fish and chips.
00:03:51,00:03:56,And Chloe did this thing where she picked up the final few chips and she threw them out
00:03:56,00:03:57,to the ocean.
00:03:57,00:04:02,"And just at that moment, this giant gust of wind came, blew the chips to the left, right"
00:04:02,00:04:09,onto a couple that were kissing on the steps and about 12 seagulls just darted into them.
00:04:09,00:04:13,"She had to run after them, go, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, they were literally being"
00:04:13,00:04:15,attacked by these goals.
00:04:15,00:04:16,Is that a true story?
00:04:16,00:04:17,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:04:17,00:04:18,Yeah.
00:04:18,00:04:19,So one of my favourite moments.
00:04:19,00:04:20,"In fact, I have a photo."
00:04:20,00:04:21,"Well, that might..."
00:04:21,00:04:22,"Damn, that sounds very windy."
00:04:22,00:04:24,"Yeah, so that's how I'd be able to tell."
00:04:24,00:04:31,"But the strongest gust ever recorded in the UK was at Cairn Gorms Summit in 1986, which"
00:04:31,00:04:36,"was a mountain in the Highlands, which was 173 miles an hour."
00:04:36,00:04:37,Woo!
00:04:37,00:04:39,I think that's the strongest any gust.
00:04:39,00:04:44,"Any individual gust has been recorded, but I think in general, it's normally Shetland that"
00:04:44,00:04:46,is the windiest on average.
00:04:46,00:04:47,I believe.
00:04:47,00:04:48,"Yeah, imagine."
00:04:48,00:04:49,I know.
00:04:49,00:04:50,I know.
00:04:50,00:04:52,You'd be lifted off into the air when you'd be lifted off in the air.
00:04:52,00:04:53,"Oh, yeah."
00:04:53,00:04:56,Don't wear your big coat.
00:04:56,00:04:58,"Thank you, Nathan."
00:04:58,00:04:59,"Yeah, great fact."
00:04:59,00:05:00,Great fact.
00:05:00,00:05:06,"Who's a fact from Josh Glendening, who says, ""A soldier who spent too long on the toilet"
00:05:06,00:05:11,"because of an upset stomach caused the start of World War II?"""
00:05:11,00:05:12,So do we know about this incident?
00:05:12,00:05:13,No.
00:05:13,00:05:18,"Okay, this was called the Marco Polo Bridge incident, it was 1937, often considered to be the"
00:05:18,00:05:23,"start of the Second Sino-Japanese War, which then evolved into World War II."
00:05:23,00:05:30,"And so the story goes that in the 1930s, Japan had invaded and put it in a puppet government"
00:05:30,00:05:31,and named it Manchuria.
00:05:31,00:05:32,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:05:32,00:05:33,Yeah.
00:05:33,00:05:39,"So in July 1937, there was a Japanese private, Shumura Kikojuro, who was stationed near the bridge,"
00:05:39,00:05:40,and he went missing.
00:05:40,00:05:47,So a few soldiers accused the Chinese military of having taken him and were holding him hostage.
00:05:47,00:05:51,And so they started climbing over the walls to find him.
00:05:51,00:05:56,They started asking questions and getting a bit of an aggressive response.
00:05:56,00:05:58,And it just kind of built up tensions.
00:05:58,00:06:02,"Meanwhile, the soldier comes back after a while, saying, ""Sorry, my stomach was gone."
00:06:02,00:06:06,"I had to dip into the forest and just relieve myself."""
00:06:06,00:06:11,"And in that time, enough of a fight started that it went into a full-blown war."
00:06:11,00:06:12,War.
00:06:12,00:06:16,I just feel like we've missed one or two steps here.
00:06:16,00:06:17,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:06:17,00:06:19,"I mean, it's probably some political things happening."
00:06:19,00:06:21,There were a few political things.
00:06:21,00:06:25,"Also, there's another theory that he was visiting a brothel that he hadn't gone to the toilet."
00:06:25,00:06:26,Yeah.
00:06:26,00:06:30,"And a lot of historians, but this has been pooped by a lot of historians."
00:06:30,00:06:31,P pooped?
00:06:31,00:06:32,It's very good.
00:06:32,00:06:37,"It's the idea that this was staged, so he was told to go away so that they could pretend"
00:06:37,00:06:40,he was missing so that they could find an excuse to go in.
00:06:40,00:06:41,"But so, yeah."
00:06:41,00:06:45,"I've heard this story before, and I think it rings relatively true."
00:06:45,00:06:46,"The basics are true, aren't they?"
00:06:46,00:06:47,Only.
00:06:47,00:06:49,I read a couple of years ago.
00:06:49,00:06:51,I read Surah Anthony Beaver's History of the Second World War.
00:06:51,00:06:52,How did he mention it?
00:06:52,00:06:55,He says this is the exclusive course.
00:06:55,00:06:56,Does he?
00:06:56,00:06:57,"Oh, yeah, yeah."
00:06:57,00:07:00,It says everything else would have been absolutely fine.
00:07:00,00:07:01,And yeah.
00:07:01,00:07:03,There were two chapters on this guy's dodgy tummy.
00:07:03,00:07:04,That's right.
00:07:04,00:07:05,Just a little bit.
00:07:05,00:07:07,And then there was a skirmish.
00:07:07,00:07:11,"Does he go into the Sino-Japanese, or does he start in 1939?"
00:07:11,00:07:12,"Oh, no."
00:07:12,00:07:17,He goes into extraordinary detail about the whole global nature of it.
00:07:17,00:07:18,Yeah.
00:07:18,00:07:19,It starts with a soldier actually.
00:07:19,00:07:22,Page one is about the soldier who I think he was.
00:07:22,00:07:27,"And career, or he gets drafted into the Japanese army when they invade."
00:07:27,00:07:31,"And then Japan locks horns with China, and then he's taken prisoner after some fight by"
00:07:31,00:07:36,"the Russians, and then he ends up serving in three or four different armies, always being"
00:07:36,00:07:38,pressed into a different army over the course of the war.
00:07:38,00:07:40,It's an absolute nightmare scenario for him.
00:07:40,00:07:43,And he's used as an example of how this war affected absolutely everyone.
00:07:43,00:07:44,Yeah.
00:07:44,00:07:47,But his account is sort of grimly funny.
00:07:47,00:07:48,Wow.
00:07:48,00:07:51,"And then he was taken prisoner by the Russians, and it just goes on and on and on."
00:07:51,00:07:52,Right.
00:07:52,00:07:53,Yeah.
00:07:53,00:07:54,Like the forest gump of war.
00:07:54,00:07:55,I suppose so.
00:07:55,00:08:00,"And this guy, your private, don't was taking a forest dump."
00:08:00,00:08:03,"That's why you get the big bugs, Adi."
00:08:03,00:08:04,"Yum, yum."
00:08:04,00:08:05,"Plum, plum."
00:08:05,00:08:14,"Okay, my first fight comes from Ian Jones, and he says, ""I am a pediatric surgeon."""
00:08:14,00:08:16,That's not his fight.
00:08:16,00:08:20,His fight is about the Fanon Steel incision.
00:08:20,00:08:21,You gave me a load of German.
00:08:21,00:08:27,"You gave me just some German ones last week as well, and the German is not my first, second,"
00:08:27,00:08:31,"third, or indeed a hundred and ninety-third language."
00:08:31,00:08:34,But this incision is one that this person did.
00:08:34,00:08:39,"It's basically, it's the most common way of doing a cesarean, but you'd use it for some"
00:08:39,00:08:40,other surgery down there.
00:08:40,00:08:46,"But it's in the shape of a panhandle, and it's on the bikini line, and it gives you good"
00:08:46,00:08:49,access to the pelvis and stuff like that.
00:08:49,00:08:57,"Now the incision is called Fanon Steel, because Fanon Steel in German means Panhandle, okay?"
00:08:57,00:09:06,But the surgeon who first described it was called Herman Johannes Fanon Steel.
00:09:06,00:09:12,"So he invented it, it has the same name as him, but according to him, it's named after"
00:09:12,00:09:14,the fact that it's the shape of a panhandle.
00:09:14,00:09:20,"Now Ian Jones' personal theory, which I agree, is that he deliberately drew the incision"
00:09:20,00:09:26,in the shape of a panhandle so that he could name it after himself.
00:09:26,00:09:28,"People do do this sometimes, don't they?"
00:09:28,00:09:31,Wasn't there an element of the period at Gallium?
00:09:31,00:09:35,"Gallium, and it was named after a guy who's..."
00:09:35,00:09:39,"So he said that he named it after France, because it's gold."
00:09:39,00:09:45,"But actually, I think he was called Le Coc, or something similar, which is chicken, and"
00:09:45,00:09:48,Gallus Gallus is the Latin for chicken.
00:09:48,00:09:49,"That's it, that's it."
00:09:49,00:09:55,"So yeah, like people do do it, and to be honest, it's such a coincidence, I've never seen"
00:09:55,00:09:57,the word Fanon Steel before.
00:09:57,00:10:02,"I mean, what if actually the surgery would be much better and easier to conduct if it was"
00:10:02,00:10:04,a completely different shape that doesn't look like a panhandle?
00:10:04,00:10:05,Yes.
00:10:05,00:10:09,"It could be that, you know, all these years, people who are having caissarians are having"
00:10:09,00:10:12,the wrong shape just because of his...
00:10:12,00:10:13,"Well, we should look into that."
00:10:13,00:10:14,That's insane.
00:10:14,00:10:15,That's really...
00:10:15,00:10:16,That's a really good fact.
00:10:16,00:10:17,That's very good.
00:10:17,00:10:18,And great theory.
00:10:18,00:10:20,I can give you more on surgeons.
00:10:20,00:10:21,Yeah.
00:10:21,00:10:22,"Yeah, go on."
00:10:22,00:10:28,John Casimir Félix Guillon was born in Rayunion.
00:10:28,00:10:33,"He came up with a new way of removing bloodestones through the paradigm, but he's more famous"
00:10:33,00:10:38,for being the probable inspiration for this song Frerajacca.
00:10:38,00:10:39,No way!
00:10:39,00:10:40,Wow.
00:10:40,00:10:41,My little one sings that nonstop at the moment.
00:10:41,00:10:45,Did they know that it's about removing bloodestones through the paradigm?
00:10:45,00:10:47,"No, but we never get to the third version of the song, so..."
00:10:47,00:10:50,"So what are the lines of your Frerajacca, Frerajacca?"
00:10:50,00:10:51,Dormaboo.
00:10:51,00:10:52,Dormaboo.
00:10:52,00:10:53,"Sonema, Matina."
00:10:53,00:10:54,"Sonema, Matina."
00:10:54,00:10:55,"Ding, dang, dong, ding, dang, dong."
00:10:55,00:10:56,So is that...
00:10:56,00:10:59,We've had a patient come in complaining of severe...
00:10:59,00:11:03,It's the sound of the bloodestones falling into the pan.
00:11:03,00:11:06,"It's the ding, dang, dong."
00:11:06,00:11:07,Good.
00:11:07,00:11:08,Good.
00:11:08,00:11:09,Wow.
00:11:09,00:11:16,"Is the perineum, the bit in between the genital and the other genital opening?"
00:11:16,00:11:18,What's the grondal?
00:11:18,00:11:21,"It might just be you, Dan."
00:11:21,00:11:23,"I thought that was another term for that, OK?"
00:11:23,00:11:24,I've never come across that.
00:11:24,00:11:25,Have you not?
00:11:25,00:11:31,"So the band that does our theme tune and pre-yes, Ash, who wrote our song and sings the song,"
00:11:31,00:11:33,he was originally in a band called Grondal.
00:11:33,00:11:36,And I'm pretty sure it was too much to...
00:11:36,00:11:37,Wow.
00:11:37,00:11:38,Is Aussie slang?
00:11:38,00:11:39,"No, no, no, no."
00:11:39,00:11:42,"All right, Mr. Shriver, let's get you up on the chair and just have a quick look at the"
00:11:42,00:11:43,"grondal, sir."
00:11:43,00:11:46,"Oh, you got a bad case of the Frerajac, is there, mate?"
00:11:46,00:11:48,"Dan, let's have another fact."
00:11:48,00:11:49,OK.
00:11:49,00:11:53,"Here's not so much a fact, but a great pub quiz question."
00:11:53,00:11:54,All right.
00:11:54,00:11:56,So this is from John Dunn.
00:11:56,00:12:02,"He says, ""My favourite pub, the Metrophysical Poet."""
00:12:02,00:12:05,"He says, ""My favourite pub quiz question is, and here's a question now, and I'm going to"
00:12:05,00:12:13,"ask it to you too, what are furthest north, south, east, and west states of the United States?"""
00:12:13,00:12:14,"Come on, mate."
00:12:14,00:12:15,"Yeah, you're OK."
00:12:15,00:12:16,I think I was born yesterday.
00:12:16,00:12:17,All right.
00:12:17,00:12:18,So let's start with south.
00:12:18,00:12:19,What's the...
00:12:19,00:12:21,What's the...
00:12:21,00:12:22,Softest?
00:12:22,00:12:23,Softest.
00:12:23,00:12:24,Um...
00:12:24,00:12:25,I'm going to say Dakota.
00:12:25,00:12:26,You have to go to...
00:12:26,00:12:27,No.
00:12:27,00:12:35,It's a trick question.
00:12:35,00:12:36,OK.
00:12:36,00:12:38,"Well, for me, it has to be North Carolina."
00:12:38,00:12:39,OK.
00:12:39,00:12:41,"No, it must be Hawaii."
00:12:41,00:12:42,It is Hawaii.
00:12:42,00:12:43,"Oh, very good."
00:12:43,00:12:44,Correct.
00:12:44,00:12:48,What is the north-fist state?
00:12:48,00:12:49,No.
00:12:49,00:12:52,I think that has to be South Dakota.
00:12:52,00:12:58,"OK, playing seriously for a second, I'll say Alaska."
00:12:58,00:12:59,Correct.
00:12:59,00:13:00,It is Alaska.
00:13:00,00:13:01,"It is, that is correct."
00:13:01,00:13:02,OK.
00:13:02,00:13:03,"So, one each."
00:13:03,00:13:04,Yep.
00:13:04,00:13:05,Westest.
00:13:05,00:13:07,Westest.
00:13:07,00:13:08,I would say Alaska.
00:13:08,00:13:09,Alaska.
00:13:09,00:13:10,Correct.
00:13:10,00:13:11,It is Alaska.
00:13:11,00:13:12,Oh.
00:13:12,00:13:13,Yeah.
00:13:13,00:13:14,"Interestingly, it's got north and west."
00:13:14,00:13:15,Yeah.
00:13:15,00:13:16,"So, OK."
00:13:16,00:13:18,"That's two, one, but you probably might have said the same."
00:13:18,00:13:19,I would.
00:13:19,00:13:21,"And also, I'm going to get the next one right."
00:13:21,00:13:22,OK.
00:13:22,00:13:26,"So, I'll get this one to Andy."
00:13:26,00:13:27,Most Eastest.
00:13:27,00:13:33,"I feel like it's going to be a trick, but I'll say--"
00:13:33,00:13:34,West Virginia.
00:13:34,00:13:35,West Virginia.
00:13:35,00:13:36,Yeah.
00:13:36,00:13:39,"No, I'll say one of those ones over on the far right-hand side."
00:13:39,00:13:40,I'll say Rhode Island.
00:13:40,00:13:41,Rhode Island.
00:13:41,00:13:42,Incorrect.
00:13:42,00:13:43,James.
00:13:43,00:13:46,I'm going to say it's Alaska again.
00:13:46,00:13:47,Correct.
00:13:47,00:13:49,I'll see Aleutian Islands go over the international date life.
00:13:49,00:13:50,I'll have to say.
00:13:50,00:13:51,Yeah.
00:13:51,00:13:52,Is that amazing?
00:13:52,00:13:53,South of the only one.
00:13:53,00:13:55,Hawaii that is not claimed by Alaska.
00:13:55,00:13:59,"So, north, east, west are all Alaska."
00:13:59,00:14:00,Yeah.
00:14:00,00:14:01,OK.
00:14:01,00:14:02,Here's one.
00:14:02,00:14:09,"Kathy Oliver from Ontario, which is at least in the same hemisphere as most of Alaska."
00:14:09,00:14:14,"She said, my husband and I love your podcast, and it keeps us entertained on drives to my various"
00:14:14,00:14:19,"treatments over the last two years, which leads me to a fact idea for you when you get"
00:14:19,00:14:25,"to stem cell transplant, you will stink of creamed corn for a couple of days."
00:14:25,00:14:26,Wow.
00:14:26,00:14:27,OK.
00:14:27,00:14:33,"So, the stem cells are frozen using a substance called dimethyl sulfoxide, the MSO, and it stops"
00:14:33,00:14:40,"them from getting damaged, but it has this peculiar odor that smells to most people like"
00:14:40,00:14:41,creamed corn.
00:14:41,00:14:47,"The MSO actually is very pungent, but to such an extent that you can taste it by touching"
00:14:47,00:14:48,it.
00:14:48,00:14:53,"It had a Petri dish of the MSO now, and you put your finger in it, you'd be able to taste"
00:14:53,00:14:54,it.
00:14:54,00:14:55,Wow.
00:14:55,00:14:59,And that's because it directly triggers the nerves that normally react to taste.
00:14:59,00:15:00,That's insane.
00:15:00,00:15:01,Yeah.
00:15:01,00:15:02,That's absolutely insane.
00:15:02,00:15:03,How many different foods does that work with?
00:15:03,00:15:05,This is not a food.
00:15:05,00:15:06,OK.
00:15:06,00:15:09,"This is a chemical, and I don't know of any food stuff."
00:15:09,00:15:13,"I guess garlic could do it like that, maybe, because that seems to go through your skin,"
00:15:13,00:15:14,"but that's just, I guess."
00:15:14,00:15:15,"I mean, I don't know."
00:15:15,00:15:16,The theory about that.
00:15:16,00:15:18,I don't remember you walking around with an onion in your salt to see if you could taste
00:15:18,00:15:19,it.
00:15:19,00:15:20,It's your research.
00:15:20,00:15:21,"Yeah, yeah."
00:15:21,00:15:23,I've got two pictures for you off the back of this.
00:15:23,00:15:24,"Oh, yeah."
00:15:24,00:15:27,"So number one, there should be a Googleful smells."
00:15:27,00:15:28,That should just be a Googleful smells.
00:15:28,00:15:33,"How do you, what do you, what do you search as in what do you tie, you're not typing."
00:15:33,00:15:34,You're not typing.
00:15:34,00:15:37,"Well, you're typing with your nose."
00:15:37,00:15:41,"So what do you put in that you're trying to find like, I haven't worked out all the"
00:15:41,00:15:42,details yet.
00:15:42,00:15:44,Is it like shazam instead of a phone?
00:15:44,00:15:50,"You hold a giant nose, that's the area where you are and it goes, hmm, it's crumpets."
00:15:50,00:15:52,That's exactly what it is.
00:15:52,00:15:53,Very nice.
00:15:53,00:15:54,"Okay, brilliant."
00:15:54,00:15:55,That's good.
00:15:55,00:15:56,Right.
00:15:56,00:15:57,We solved that one.
00:15:57,00:15:58,"Well, I feel like I came up with that idea."
00:15:58,00:15:59,Really.
00:15:59,00:16:00,"Like, we were on the room."
00:16:00,00:16:01,Three-way split.
00:16:01,00:16:02,Really great.
00:16:02,00:16:03,"Great work, everyone."
00:16:03,00:16:04,See you for the first set of quarterly results.
00:16:04,00:16:05,Okay.
00:16:05,00:16:08,"So second idea off the back of that, the touch restaurant, right?"
00:16:08,00:16:12,"You don't eat anything, but you just go in and you put your fingers through holes"
00:16:12,00:16:16,in the table into various different foods that you can then taste.
00:16:16,00:16:17,Yeah.
00:16:17,00:16:18,Right.
00:16:18,00:16:24,"Okay, but the only thing on the menu is DMSO so far, so far, maybe some garlic."
00:16:24,00:16:26,But you've got to wear it for a month.
00:16:26,00:16:29,But I think that will be good if we can find enough foods that you can taste through your
00:16:29,00:16:30,fingertips.
00:16:30,00:16:31,Yeah.
00:16:31,00:16:32,That would be awesome.
00:16:32,00:16:34,"I've got to say, I'm in on the shazam nose."
00:16:34,00:16:37,"Andy, I'll let you develop this a bit more before committing."
00:16:37,00:16:40,"I'm sharing it with you guys three ways no matter what, including the debts."
00:16:40,00:16:41,Okay.
00:16:41,00:16:48,"I just want to say to everyone listening to this, I'm happy to share my shazam nose with"
00:16:48,00:16:50,everyone who's listening to this.
00:16:50,00:16:55,"We can all have 0.0 1%, that's really generous."
00:16:55,00:17:01,But one of you listening will have to make it.
00:17:01,00:17:04,Here's nice.
00:17:04,00:17:05,Do you want to do another one?
00:17:05,00:17:06,I'm the other one.
00:17:06,00:17:07,Don't you want to jump in?
00:17:07,00:17:09,"Yeah, I've got one here."
00:17:09,00:17:16,"So this is from Edward Maloy, who says this is their favorite fact, Norwich, is the only"
00:17:16,00:17:18,city in history to be excommunicated.
00:17:18,00:17:24,"In 1274, after a riot in the cathedral, Pope Gregory X excommunicated the entire city until"
00:17:24,00:17:29,they repented and repaired the damage done to church property.
00:17:29,00:17:34,"Clearly, it has had a lasting effect as Norwich is now the least religious city in England"
00:17:34,00:17:36,per the 2011 census.
00:17:36,00:17:38,Is that right?
00:17:38,00:17:39,Kind of right.
00:17:39,00:17:42,So it's almost right.
00:17:42,00:17:47,I didn't fully get an answer to the excommunication.
00:17:47,00:17:51,But Norwich is very much not a religious city anymore.
00:17:51,00:17:54,"It's interesting because there's a saying about Norwich, which is that it has a church"
00:17:54,00:17:57,for every week of the year and a pub for every day.
00:17:57,00:17:58,So a lot of churches.
00:17:58,00:17:59,"That must be Norfolk, right?"
00:17:59,00:18:00,There's no way.
00:18:00,00:18:01,There's strings.
00:18:01,00:18:03,"52 churches in Norwich, 11."
00:18:03,00:18:04,Maybe there is.
00:18:04,00:18:05,Maybe.
00:18:05,00:18:06,Yeah.
00:18:06,00:18:07,"Yeah, absolutely."
00:18:07,00:18:08,I take that back.
00:18:08,00:18:11,I don't think there's exactly 365 pubs either.
00:18:11,00:18:15,"But it's the L.A. of Norfolk, I would say, Norwich."
00:18:15,00:18:16,Right.
00:18:16,00:18:17,Do you say so?
00:18:17,00:18:19,"It's the mega city of Norfolk, isn't it?"
00:18:19,00:18:20,Of Norfolk?
00:18:20,00:18:21,"Oh, yeah."
00:18:21,00:18:22,"There's Kingsland, of course."
00:18:22,00:18:23,"Oh, yeah."
00:18:23,00:18:24,"Of course, there's Kingsland."
00:18:24,00:18:25,That's fair.
00:18:25,00:18:26,There's Kingsland.
00:18:26,00:18:32,"Well, a census was done in 2021, and it showed that those who said that they don't have"
00:18:32,00:18:35,"any religion, don't believe in any religion, was 53.5%."
00:18:35,00:18:36,Wow.
00:18:36,00:18:46,"So 76,973 people, and that's a jump from a decade ago when it was 42.5, and that's 56,000"
00:18:46,00:18:47,people.
00:18:47,00:18:50,So it's the second least religious city in the UK.
00:18:50,00:18:53,"Oh, I think I know this one."
00:18:53,00:18:54,Town or city.
00:18:54,00:18:55,Yeah.
00:18:55,00:18:56,Isn't it?
00:18:56,00:18:57,It's somewhere called Satan.
00:18:57,00:18:58,Satan food.
00:18:58,00:18:59,What?
00:18:59,00:19:00,There's the least religious.
00:19:00,00:19:01,That's not a city though.
00:19:01,00:19:02,That's not a city though.
00:19:02,00:19:03,"No, it's not a city."
00:19:03,00:19:04,"It's a parish, isn't it?"
00:19:04,00:19:05,No.
00:19:05,00:19:06,What?
00:19:06,00:19:09,"I think it's got an amusingly apt name, the least religious place in the UK, but I can't"
00:19:09,00:19:10,remember what the name is.
00:19:10,00:19:11,I would have.
00:19:11,00:19:16,"Without knowing that little clue, I would have said most likely it would be somewhere like"
00:19:16,00:19:20,"Brighton or Bristol, like somewhere where lots of cool young people live."
00:19:20,00:19:21,"So, yeah."
00:19:21,00:19:22,Strongly secular.
00:19:22,00:19:23,Hmm.
00:19:23,00:19:24,"Do you want to have another guest, Andy?"
00:19:24,00:19:25,James has it right.
00:19:25,00:19:26,But do you want to have another guest?
00:19:26,00:19:27,No.
00:19:27,00:19:28,I'm going to stick with Satan food.
00:19:28,00:19:29,I think.
00:19:29,00:19:30,Okay.
00:19:30,00:19:31,Brighton and Hope.
00:19:31,00:19:32,Wow.
00:19:32,00:19:37,55.2% of people declaring no religion.
00:19:37,00:19:38,Gosh.
00:19:38,00:19:39,Yeah.
00:19:39,00:19:40,Alistair Crowley had his funeral there.
00:19:40,00:19:41,In Brighton.
00:19:41,00:19:42,"Yeah, it might have something to do with that."
00:19:42,00:19:43,It is.
00:19:43,00:19:44,Was he from that?
00:19:44,00:19:48,"No, but I think he passed away in Hastings and I think his body ended up in Brighton for"
00:19:48,00:19:49,some reason.
00:19:49,00:19:50,He was cremated there.
00:19:50,00:19:51,Yeah.
00:19:51,00:19:52,"Not so far, is it?"
00:19:52,00:19:53,No.
00:19:53,00:19:54,It's on the coast.
00:19:54,00:19:55,Very windy.
00:19:55,00:19:56,Is it?
00:19:56,00:19:59,Do you want to release those ashes and they're a couple making out?
00:19:59,00:20:00,Here's one from me.
00:20:00,00:20:05,"I already have a bone to pick with Andrew Hunter Murray, it's episode two and I already"
00:20:05,00:20:09,have a bone to pick because you sent us these facts.
00:20:09,00:20:12,"And listen, think back to audience facts one."
00:20:12,00:20:17,"When I said, here's one from Wayne Height or is it Holt because it looks like it should"
00:20:17,00:20:18,be Holt?
00:20:18,00:20:24,"Well, this week I have one from Wayne Holt, H-O-L-T."
00:20:24,00:20:28,I assume it's the same person and I assume one of them is a misspelling.
00:20:28,00:20:30,I've got to track.
00:20:30,00:20:37,Although I did have a eyesight check yesterday and I need reading glasses so maybe you need
00:20:37,00:20:38,to check.
00:20:38,00:20:39,Can you check?
00:20:39,00:20:40,Is that a Height and a Holt?
00:20:40,00:20:42,"Yeah, it's a Height and a Holt."
00:20:42,00:20:43,Right.
00:20:43,00:20:44,Yeah.
00:20:44,00:20:45,Okay.
00:20:45,00:20:46,Wayne does write in a few writes in frequently.
00:20:46,00:20:48,We have a few frequent flies in the fishing box.
00:20:48,00:20:50,Does he change his name every time you write it?
00:20:50,00:20:51,I've got to track.
00:20:51,00:20:56,"You've got to work on your pseudonyms, Wayne."
00:20:56,00:20:57,"What's the fact, James?"
00:20:57,00:21:02,"Well, actually the fact is to do a spelling."
00:21:02,00:21:04,"Oh, no."
00:21:04,00:21:12,The fact is that in concert the band Divo sometimes performed as their own opening act to pretending
00:21:12,00:21:18,"to be a Christian soft rock band called Dove, the band of love, which is an anagram of"
00:21:18,00:21:19,Divo.
00:21:19,00:21:20,Very nice.
00:21:20,00:21:21,That's really good.
00:21:21,00:21:22,"I'm really sorry, James."
00:21:22,00:21:24,They're both from Wayne Height.
00:21:24,00:21:25,Wayne Holt doesn't exist.
00:21:25,00:21:27,That's not a real person.
00:21:27,00:21:28,I've mistyped his name.
00:21:28,00:21:32,"There will be a Wayne Holt out there if you're listening, Wayne."
00:21:32,00:21:34,"Well, how's Wayne going to solve the situation?"
00:21:34,00:21:36,Wayne's only going to confuse matters.
00:21:36,00:21:37,Yeah.
00:21:37,00:21:40,"If you happen to be listening to fish and you're called Wayne Holt, write in."
00:21:40,00:21:41,Yeah.
00:21:41,00:21:42,Let us know you exist.
00:21:42,00:21:43,Yeah.
00:21:43,00:21:44,Simple.
00:21:44,00:21:45,Should I do one?
00:21:45,00:21:46,Yeah.
00:21:46,00:21:53,This is from Jessica Eringayson from Texas and she writes that Napoleon and Lord Wellington
00:21:53,00:21:57,are kind of related and it's America's fault.
00:21:57,00:21:58,Okay.
00:21:58,00:22:03,"This is admittedly quite tenuous, but the story is is that Napoleon had a younger brother"
00:22:03,00:22:08,called Jerome who visited the US when he was in his late teens and he eloped with a lady
00:22:08,00:22:14,"called Elizabeth Patterson, then Napoleon wanted Jerome to come back and marry a European"
00:22:14,00:22:19,princess because it was part of his plan to consolidate power while he was conquesting
00:22:19,00:22:20,territories.
00:22:20,00:22:21,Right?
00:22:21,00:22:22,So he brought Jerome back.
00:22:22,00:22:27,"Elizabeth stays, but then Elizabeth hops on a boat and Napoleon bans it from landing."
00:22:27,00:22:31,So she has no choice but to go and port in London.
00:22:31,00:22:33,So that's where she lands.
00:22:33,00:22:37,Jerome remarries and basically they never see each other again.
00:22:37,00:22:38,Wow.
00:22:38,00:22:42,"Now, the tenuous link that we've been given here from Jessica is that while she was in"
00:22:42,00:22:45,"London, she was living with a lady called Marianne."
00:22:45,00:22:47,Marianne was her sister-in-law.
00:22:47,00:22:51,"Marianne's husband dies and she remarries Richard Wellesley, who's the elder brother of Arthur"
00:22:51,00:22:54,"Wellesley, who defeat Napoleon at Waterloo."
00:22:54,00:22:55,Good Lord.
00:22:55,00:22:56,Yeah.
00:22:56,00:22:58,"It's more world, isn't it?"
00:22:58,00:23:03,I've signed to think it's a slightly bigger world than I was imagining.
00:23:03,00:23:04,Okay.
00:23:04,00:23:06,"I mean, I was lost so long ago."
00:23:06,00:23:07,Yeah.
00:23:07,00:23:09,It's just about clung on till the end.
00:23:09,00:23:10,"I tell you what, though."
00:23:10,00:23:13,I did recently visit the room where Wellington died.
00:23:13,00:23:14,Did you?
00:23:14,00:23:15,Yeah.
00:23:15,00:23:16,I went down to Walma Castle in Kent.
00:23:16,00:23:17,"Oh, it's a good day out."
00:23:17,00:23:18,Hmm.
00:23:18,00:23:19,It's really good.
00:23:19,00:23:20,It's a proper castle.
00:23:20,00:23:21,It's 400 years old.
00:23:21,00:23:24,"It's not one of these sort of plastic castles that you get these days, you know, sort of like fake"
00:23:24,00:23:26,"castles, which is just to state the home with a view."
00:23:26,00:23:27,That's Disneyland.
00:23:27,00:23:28,Disneyland.
00:23:28,00:23:29,It's not Disneyland.
00:23:29,00:23:30,"It's no, it's proper."
00:23:30,00:23:34,"And they had, there's a thing called being the Wharton of the Sync Ports."
00:23:34,00:23:36,"It looks like it's Sank, French or five, but it's not."
00:23:36,00:23:37,It's Wharton of the Sync Ports.
00:23:37,00:23:38,That's how it's done.
00:23:38,00:23:39,"But it does mean five, right?"
00:23:39,00:23:40,There were five pots.
00:23:40,00:23:43,"It does mean five, and it's spelled like the French or five, but it is, I swear to God,"
00:23:43,00:23:45,they pronounce it Wharton of the Sync Ports.
00:23:45,00:23:46,Okay.
00:23:46,00:23:47,I swear.
00:23:47,00:23:51,"And it said to the lady, nice to be visiting the Sank Ports, she said Sank Ports."
00:23:51,00:23:53,"Anyway, she probably said that a hundred times a day for 20 years."
00:23:53,00:23:56,You don't want to be calling your pot Sank anyway.
00:23:56,00:23:58,You're absolutely right.
00:23:58,00:23:59,It's a crazy choice.
00:23:59,00:24:03,"But there is this honorary possession called Wharton of the Sync Ports, and Wellington"
00:24:03,00:24:04,was that.
00:24:04,00:24:05,So was the Queen Mum.
00:24:05,00:24:10,"The old Queen Mum, and actually, when I visited, they had a Queen Mum lookalike there"
00:24:10,00:24:11,for the day.
00:24:11,00:24:12,Did they?
00:24:12,00:24:13,Yeah.
00:24:13,00:24:14,Along with the kind of...
00:24:14,00:24:15,That kind of work must be dry enough a bit.
00:24:15,00:24:20,"Well, I made this sort of casual joke about Jen, and she looks so disapproving."
00:24:20,00:24:22,"Because you know, the Queen Mum, she loved her Jen."
00:24:22,00:24:23,She liked to drink.
00:24:23,00:24:24,"I can't, Andy."
00:24:24,00:24:26,This was a tough day for you.
00:24:26,00:24:31,"First of all, you walk in and mispronounce Sank Ports, and then you make a perfectly harmless"
00:24:31,00:24:33,"joke about Jen, so the Queen Mum lookalike."
00:24:33,00:24:35,And then I find out Wellington's dead.
00:24:35,00:24:38,It was awful.
00:24:38,00:24:42,"It was terrible, but no, it's a really evocative ring, because they've got this tiny bed."
00:24:42,00:24:47,"There's this camp bed, there's a military camp bed that is still there from the day he died,"
00:24:47,00:24:51,"and he must have died in about 1850, but he took this bed with him wherever he went."
00:24:51,00:24:56,"When he went up to London to be the Prime Minister, that military camp bed went with him."
00:24:56,00:24:57,How interesting.
00:24:57,00:25:00,"He slept in that bed in Downing Street, and then when he became warden with the Sank Ports,"
00:25:00,00:25:04,"he brought the bed back to Warmer Castle, and that's the bed where he died."
00:25:04,00:25:09,"I went to the place where Napoleon surrendered, which is in France somewhere."
00:25:09,00:25:10,Is it Ilderae or somewhere?
00:25:10,00:25:11,I can't remember.
00:25:11,00:25:14,"I yield to France, yield to Ilderae, something like that."
00:25:14,00:25:20,"I might be misremembering this, but I seem to remember that he had quite a non-onate bed"
00:25:20,00:25:21,as well.
00:25:21,00:25:28,"I remember being there and thinking, ""Wow, for someone who's so important in history,"
00:25:28,00:25:29,"what a shit bed."""
00:25:29,00:25:30,These military beds.
00:25:30,00:25:34,I think it's the military like they used to the campaigning lifestyle.
00:25:34,00:25:37,I saw the bed that Abraham Lincoln died in.
00:25:37,00:25:38,Really?
00:25:38,00:25:41,It's when we were in DC.
00:25:41,00:25:45,"We had a bit of time off, because he was shot in the fourth theatre, but then he was taken"
00:25:45,00:25:46,"to a house, not too far away."
00:25:46,00:25:50,"He could just need a little nap, and I'd go, ""That's all right."""
00:25:50,00:25:51,Just butterscotch.
00:25:51,00:25:57,"No, they brought it to a house, and so he died in a bed that was, his legs were hanging"
00:25:57,00:25:58,"off the edge, basically."
00:25:58,00:25:59,He was tall.
00:25:59,00:26:03,"He was super tall, and the bed was quite small, and you can visit his bed."
00:26:03,00:26:04,You can visit this.
00:26:04,00:26:05,Yeah.
00:26:05,00:26:06,Okay.
00:26:06,00:26:07,Here we are.
00:26:07,00:26:08,Okay.
00:26:08,00:26:14,"We sell replica beds of the great beds of history, and we're going to clean up on the finance"
00:26:14,00:26:17,bros who want to think that they're living like Napoleon or Wellington.
00:26:17,00:26:18,Or Lincoln.
00:26:18,00:26:23,"I mean, those are three perfect examples of beds of the greats, right?"
00:26:23,00:26:24,Yes.
00:26:24,00:26:28,"Like, you too can conquer Europe with our £9,000 bed."
00:26:28,00:26:29,Yeah.
00:26:29,00:26:30,Yeah.
00:26:30,00:26:31,And we'll just sell them in military campbed.
00:26:31,00:26:32,What do you think?
00:26:32,00:26:33,I love it.
00:26:33,00:26:34,Okay.
00:26:34,00:26:35,All right.
00:26:35,00:26:39,"We're going to have not point, not, not one percent."
00:26:39,00:26:40,Okay.
00:26:40,00:26:44,"So I think that's enough facts for the day that we've been sent in, but we still have one"
00:26:44,00:26:45,more thing to do.
00:26:45,00:26:50,And that is to name some custodians of the archive.
00:26:50,00:26:56,So anyone who is in our top tier on Patreon becomes a custodian of a fact from no such thing
00:26:56,00:26:57,as a fish.
00:26:57,00:26:58,It's very exciting.
00:26:58,00:27:00,I'm a custodian myself.
00:27:00,00:27:05,"If you'd remember listening back to episode one of this little fish, but there will"
00:27:05,00:27:07,be more custodians names today.
00:27:07,00:27:11,"We will tell you your name, which you might already know."
00:27:11,00:27:14,And then we'll tell you the fact that you're the custodian of.
00:27:14,00:27:21,"So Andrew, who is going to be our first nonfish member who is a custodian of a fish fact?"
00:27:21,00:27:23,I just want to say that was incredibly slick jokes.
00:27:23,00:27:28,And the concept of the shout out is clearly very well embedded in your head.
00:27:28,00:27:30,First up today for a shout out is Rachel Not.
00:27:30,00:27:36,And her fact is the first ever sandwich that we know about contained wine.
00:27:36,00:27:37,"Congratulations, Rachel."
00:27:37,00:27:38,Yes.
00:27:38,00:27:39,That is now your fact forever.
00:27:39,00:27:41,Bill out of the elder.
00:27:41,00:27:42,Is it?
00:27:42,00:27:43,Bill out?
00:27:43,00:27:44,Bill out?
00:27:44,00:27:45,"Yes, something."
00:27:45,00:27:46,Bill out.
00:27:46,00:27:47,"And it was, um, it was more of a wrap."
00:27:47,00:27:48,It was more of a wrap.
00:27:48,00:27:52,"It had like, um, currency or something, right?"
00:27:52,00:27:53,It sounds delicious.
00:27:53,00:27:54,Yeah.
00:27:54,00:27:55,I think we said this at the time.
00:27:55,00:27:56,11 years ago.
00:27:56,00:27:57,Perfect covered on the show.
00:27:57,00:27:58,"Anyway, yeah."
00:27:58,00:27:59,"Rachel, that's your fact."
00:27:59,00:28:03,And the sandwich is in the out of sandwich who we just covered again a week or two ago in
00:28:03,00:28:04,recorded.
00:28:04,00:28:05,"Yes, we did, of course."
00:28:05,00:28:06,"Well, we're on a big wheel, aren't we?"
00:28:06,00:28:07,We are.
00:28:07,00:28:08,"Dan, have you got one?"
00:28:08,00:28:09,"Uh, yeah."
00:28:09,00:28:14,This is a fact that is now going to belong to Silas Gill.
00:28:14,00:28:19,"And that is in 2003, three people in Mexico died of acne."
00:28:19,00:28:20,Oh.
00:28:20,00:28:21,Oh.
00:28:21,00:28:25,"If you put a gun to my head and said, you've got a thousand guesses as to the Christian"
00:28:25,00:28:29,name of the second ever person to become a friend of the podcast.
00:28:29,00:28:31,Silas would have not been one of my thousand guesses.
00:28:31,00:28:32,No.
00:28:32,00:28:33,It's just a terrific name.
00:28:33,00:28:38,"Because I think these in order of the people who signed up so literally, I think Rachel and"
00:28:38,00:28:45,Silas had to have had the hand hovering over the Patreon button as the time struck midnight.
00:28:45,00:28:46,Yeah.
00:28:46,00:28:47,Wow.
00:28:47,00:28:51,"And we should say Silas isn't especially fish friendly name, Silas Marna, by friend of the"
00:28:51,00:28:52,podcast.
00:28:52,00:28:53,Samuel Taylor Colouridge.
00:28:53,00:28:54,You're jelly-ed.
00:28:54,00:28:55,That's right.
00:28:55,00:28:58,"Um, okay."
00:28:58,00:29:03,"So the third custodian this week, this is a Dan Schreiber fact."
00:29:03,00:29:10,"And the fact is that amongst the other scientists called Einstein, there are M E Einstein who came"
00:29:10,00:29:17,up with a formula for predicting the composition of a pork carcass and rosemary Einstein who co-investigated
00:29:17,00:29:24,"the use of cannabis, alcohol and tobacco on 300 young persons at her university."
00:29:24,00:29:25,Could have done with it.
00:29:25,00:29:26,That it done.
00:29:26,00:29:28,We're going to need a bigger certificate.
00:29:28,00:29:34,"But drumroll, that fact now is under the custodianship of Helen Cosgrove Davis."
00:29:34,00:29:35,Actually.
00:29:35,00:29:36,There he is.
00:29:36,00:29:37,Nice.
00:29:37,00:29:38,That was a great episode.
00:29:38,00:29:42,That was a fact I took from a Mark Abrams book of the ignoble prizes who James and I are going
00:29:42,00:29:43,to be seeing tomorrow.
00:29:43,00:29:44,He's in London.
00:29:44,00:29:45,"Well, a lot of it will."
00:29:45,00:29:46,Yeah.
00:29:46,00:29:50,Along with Kate Smollaker who did the paper about the first case of homosexual necrophilia
00:29:50,00:29:51,in the Maladduck.
00:29:51,00:29:55,Yep. And who raised awareness for pubic lice because they might be going extinct.
00:29:55,00:29:57,It's going to be a spicy lunch tomorrow.
00:29:57,00:29:58,Oh.
00:29:58,00:30:01,"As long as he's not cooking, I don't really mind."
00:30:01,00:30:03,"Oh, congratulations, Helen."
00:30:03,00:30:07,That's the longest fact that's become custodian so far.
00:30:07,00:30:09,Until the next damn fact.
00:30:09,00:30:12,Shall I round us off with one more?
00:30:12,00:30:13,"Yeah, go on there."
00:30:13,00:30:14,All right.
00:30:14,00:30:18,This is a fact that is now under the stewardship of Darcy.
00:30:18,00:30:19,Mr. Darcy.
00:30:19,00:30:22,"I can only assume fits William, if you're listening."
00:30:22,00:30:23,Congratulations.
00:30:23,00:30:28,And it's one of my facts is that the first contact lenses cost as much as a car.
00:30:28,00:30:33,"Yes, you went to the museum, didn't you, to see the British Optical Association Museum."
00:30:33,00:30:38,Those were the days where we used to do proper research.
00:30:38,00:30:39,Episode two.
00:30:39,00:30:40,Quickly under that.
00:30:40,00:30:41,Yeah.
00:30:41,00:30:42,Although we're on a big wheel.
00:30:42,00:30:43,I went back there recently.
00:30:43,00:30:44,No.
00:30:44,00:30:45,For a party.
00:30:45,00:30:46,Yeah.
00:30:46,00:30:47,Yeah.
00:30:47,00:30:48,They were finishing their refurbishment of the museum.
00:30:48,00:30:49,It's really good.
00:30:49,00:30:52,They were the datesment of the headquarters of the British Optical Association.
00:30:52,00:30:57,And they invited some celebs along and they also know so they invited me.
00:30:57,00:31:01,"Well, who are the other big celebs who are at the party?"
00:31:01,00:31:02,I can't name names.
00:31:02,00:31:03,I'm sorry.
00:31:03,00:31:06,"It's very much an eyes-wide shot situation, everyone was in masks."
00:31:06,00:31:08,"Ironically, considering they're optometrists."
00:31:08,00:31:09,Brilliant.
00:31:09,00:31:13,Does everyone wear masks in an eyes-wide shot?
00:31:13,00:31:14,They do.
00:31:14,00:31:15,"Okay, good."
00:31:15,00:31:16,"In sodium scenes, not the whole way through."
00:31:16,00:31:17,Yeah.
00:31:17,00:31:19,That was very much a reach of a reference for me.
00:31:19,00:31:21,"You know when you try and do a reference or something, but you know."
00:31:21,00:31:24,You mean like when you say Samuel Taylor Coleridge wrote...
00:31:24,00:31:25,Silas Marner.
00:31:25,00:31:26,Silas Marner.
00:31:26,00:31:27,Yep.
00:31:27,00:31:28,Exactly.
00:31:28,00:31:29,Exactly.
00:31:29,00:31:31,"Because the thing is normally in a podcast, I would say that and then I cut it out because"
00:31:31,00:31:32,I knew I got it wrong.
00:31:32,00:31:33,Yeah.
