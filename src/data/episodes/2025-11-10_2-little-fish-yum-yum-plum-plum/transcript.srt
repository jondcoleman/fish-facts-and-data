00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,640
 Hi everyone, welcome to the second episode of Little Fish.

2
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:25,640
 Little Fish is a show where we list your facts, things that you've sent in to thepodcast@qiu.com

3
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:32,040
 inbox Andy has sifted through them and he has found the very sweetest plums, sent them

4
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,720
 over to the rest of us and we're going to go through them today and chat about them.

5
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:37,720
 Are they true?

6
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:38,720
 Are they not true?

7
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,800
 Do we know more about the subject?

8
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,920
 Have we never heard of any of these words before in our life?

9
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,560
 We will see as we move on.

10
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,840
 So who is going to do the first fight?

11
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,560
 It can't be me because I did the intro.

12
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,560
 It has to be one of you two.

13
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:56,920
 I'll go on, I'll throw a plum your way then, jump in, let's see how sweet you find it.

14
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:04,000
 Yum yum, plum plum, my face, sorry.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,240
 One of these days, one of these catchphrases will pay our handy and everyone will be

16
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:13,360
 saying yum yum plum plum, it'll be the new six seven.

17
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:20,440
 You'll see James when I'm opening nightclubs around the country shouting yum yum plum plum.

18
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:24,760
 Okay, this is from the unimprovably named Nathan Gallimore Strong.

19
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:28,960
 I think friend of this parish, I think we may have heard from him before.

20
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,960
 But he says, "The windiest place in the UK is the butt of Lewis."

21
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,040
 That's it, thanks Nathan.

22
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:41,640
 There you go and it's basically, it's on the Isle of Lewis, Lewis and Harris, and the

23
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:46,440
 butt is on a very, very northern tip of Lewis and during this trip he also wrote his first

24
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:52,080
 finicular railway, so congratulations Nathan, it's a little bit contentious this fact, I

25
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,080
 did do some follow up.

26
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:58,920
 I always thought it was further north, so is it Cape Rath or something that's in the far

27
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,920
 north of Scotland?

28
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,680
 I always thought that was the windiest place.

29
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,080
 Well, I think on average, Shetland is windier.

30
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:09,200
 Oh yeah, so it's been, the butt of Lewis has been named by the Guinness Book of Records

31
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,560
 a few years ago, so they have their methodology.

32
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:18,920
 I still consider Shetland to be part of Denmark, because you have well controversial political

33
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:23,480
 opinion, and if you're listening Danes, is it Denmark on Norway?

34
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:30,040
 There was one of them where we got it as maybe a dowry or something from some Scandinavian

35
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:35,680
 country, but the rules were that they were allowed to buy it back at any stage, like when

36
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,320
 we first got out of it, Shetland or ARKV, they said, "Yeah, you can have it, but as soon as

37
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:44,680
 we can get 12 marks together, we're going to buy it back."

38
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,080
 I think it's still true that, in theory, they could buy it back if they want to.

39
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,080
 Really?

40
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,080
 To know that.

41
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,080
 Okay.

42
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:55,600
 Well, so if you're listening Vikings, get the money together.

43
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,600
 How windy?

44
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,600
 How windy is this?

45
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,400
 It's really windy.

46
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,800
 The thing is, how do you measure how windy something is?

47
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,160
 Is it average speed over the year?

48
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:09,360
 Maybe for me now, because I live by sea side, I could judge it.

49
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:15,160
 If I saw where Margate lives on a list, then I think I could then judge it by personal experience.

50
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,760
 Yeah, yeah, because it's quite windy where you are.

51
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,760
 Oh, it's wild.

52
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,400
 The wind in Margate is insane.

53
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,600
 And it comes out of nowhere.

54
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,200
 We have this amazing...

55
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:27,080
 You can't see it coming.

56
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,680
 We were sitting one time at Margate.

57
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,400
 There's these things which are called the steps that go onto the beach and you often

58
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,400
 skate.

59
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,840
 Lots of beaches out there, Dutch out of all these things called the steps.

60
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,080
 If you've ever been to Rome, they have a Margate tribute, which is called the Spanner Steps.

61
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,080
 Do they?

62
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,080
 Oh, there you go.

63
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,120
 See, yeah, it's coming out Margate.

64
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:48,920
 So we were sitting on what felt like a normal day and we were with our neighbours.

65
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,760
 These seagulls get coming and eating our fish and chips.

66
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,480
 And Chloe did this thing where she picked up the final few chips and she threw them out

67
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,480
 to the ocean.

68
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:02,320
 And just at that moment, this giant gust of wind came, blew the chips to the left, right

69
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:09,640
 onto a couple that were kissing on the steps and about 12 seagulls just darted into them.

70
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:13,640
 She had to run after them, go, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, they were literally being

71
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,400
 attacked by these goals.

72
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,400
 Is that a true story?

73
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,400
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

74
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,400
 Yeah.

75
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,400
 So one of my favourite moments.

76
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,400
 In fact, I have a photo.

77
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,400
 Well, that might...

78
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,400
 Damn, that sounds very windy.

79
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,520
 Yeah, so that's how I'd be able to tell.

80
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:31,880
 But the strongest gust ever recorded in the UK was at Cairn Gorms Summit in 1986, which

81
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:36,760
 was a mountain in the Highlands, which was 173 miles an hour.

82
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,760
 Woo!

83
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,240
 I think that's the strongest any gust.

84
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:44,000
 Any individual gust has been recorded, but I think in general, it's normally Shetland that

85
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 is the windiest on average.

86
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 I believe.

87
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 Yeah, imagine.

88
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 I know.

89
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 I know.

90
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,040
 You'd be lifted off into the air when you'd be lifted off in the air.

91
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,040
 Oh, yeah.

92
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,800
 Don't wear your big coat.

93
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,120
 Thank you, Nathan.

94
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,120
 Yeah, great fact.

95
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,120
 Great fact.

96
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:06,560
 Who's a fact from Josh Glendening, who says, "A soldier who spent too long on the toilet

97
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,160
 because of an upset stomach caused the start of World War II?"

98
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,400
 So do we know about this incident?

99
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,400
 No.

100
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:18,360
 Okay, this was called the Marco Polo Bridge incident, it was 1937, often considered to be the

101
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:23,920
 start of the Second Sino-Japanese War, which then evolved into World War II.

102
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:30,080
 And so the story goes that in the 1930s, Japan had invaded and put it in a puppet government

103
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,080
 and named it Manchuria.

104
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,080
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

105
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,080
 Yeah.

106
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:39,080
 So in July 1937, there was a Japanese private, Shumura Kikojuro, who was stationed near the bridge,

107
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,640
 and he went missing.

108
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:47,240
 So a few soldiers accused the Chinese military of having taken him and were holding him hostage.

109
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:51,200
 And so they started climbing over the walls to find him.

110
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:56,080
 They started asking questions and getting a bit of an aggressive response.

111
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,840
 And it just kind of built up tensions.

112
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:02,680
 Meanwhile, the soldier comes back after a while, saying, "Sorry, my stomach was gone.

113
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,560
 I had to dip into the forest and just relieve myself."

114
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,400
 And in that time, enough of a fight started that it went into a full-blown war.

115
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,400
 War.

116
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,200
 I just feel like we've missed one or two steps here.

117
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,200
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

118
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,680
 I mean, it's probably some political things happening.

119
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,160
 There were a few political things.

120
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:25,480
 Also, there's another theory that he was visiting a brothel that he hadn't gone to the toilet.

121
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,480
 Yeah.

122
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:30,200
 And a lot of historians, but this has been pooped by a lot of historians.

123
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,200
 P pooped?

124
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,200
 It's very good.

125
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:37,120
 It's the idea that this was staged, so he was told to go away so that they could pretend

126
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,680
 he was missing so that they could find an excuse to go in.

127
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,680
 But so, yeah.

128
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,000
 I've heard this story before, and I think it rings relatively true.

129
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,440
 The basics are true, aren't they?

130
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,440
 Only.

131
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,120
 I read a couple of years ago.

132
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,960
 I read Surah Anthony Beaver's History of the Second World War.

133
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,960
 How did he mention it?

134
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,800
 He says this is the exclusive course.

135
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,800
 Does he?

136
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,800
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

137
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,600
 It says everything else would have been absolutely fine.

138
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,600
 And yeah.

139
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,840
 There were two chapters on this guy's dodgy tummy.

140
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,840
 That's right.

141
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,840
 Just a little bit.

142
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,840
 And then there was a skirmish.

143
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,600
 Does he go into the Sino-Japanese, or does he start in 1939?

144
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,600
 Oh, no.

145
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:17,280
 He goes into extraordinary detail about the whole global nature of it.

146
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,280
 Yeah.

147
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,280
 It starts with a soldier actually.

148
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,760
 Page one is about the soldier who I think he was.

149
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:27,360
 And career, or he gets drafted into the Japanese army when they invade.

150
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,960
 And then Japan locks horns with China, and then he's taken prisoner after some fight by

151
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:36,480
 the Russians, and then he ends up serving in three or four different armies, always being

152
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,320
 pressed into a different army over the course of the war.

153
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,040
 It's an absolute nightmare scenario for him.

154
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:43,720
 And he's used as an example of how this war affected absolutely everyone.

155
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,720
 Yeah.

156
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,880
 But his account is sort of grimly funny.

157
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,880
 Wow.

158
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,680
 And then he was taken prisoner by the Russians, and it just goes on and on and on.

159
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,680
 Right.

160
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,680
 Yeah.

161
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,960
 Like the forest gump of war.

162
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,960
 I suppose so.

163
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:00,840
 And this guy, your private, don't was taking a forest dump.

164
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,400
 That's why you get the big bugs, Adi.

165
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,400
 Yum, yum.

166
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,400
 Plum, plum.

167
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:14,960
 Okay, my first fight comes from Ian Jones, and he says, "I am a pediatric surgeon."

168
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,760
 That's not his fight.

169
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:20,480
 His fight is about the Fanon Steel incision.

170
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,480
 You gave me a load of German.

171
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:27,800
 You gave me just some German ones last week as well, and the German is not my first, second,

172
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,680
 third, or indeed a hundred and ninety-third language.

173
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,320
 But this incision is one that this person did.

174
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,080
 It's basically, it's the most common way of doing a cesarean, but you'd use it for some

175
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,320
 other surgery down there.

176
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:46,040
 But it's in the shape of a panhandle, and it's on the bikini line, and it gives you good

177
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,040
 access to the pelvis and stuff like that.

178
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:57,200
 Now the incision is called Fanon Steel, because Fanon Steel in German means Panhandle, okay?

179
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:06,080
 But the surgeon who first described it was called Herman Johannes Fanon Steel.

180
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:12,920
 So he invented it, it has the same name as him, but according to him, it's named after

181
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,880
 the fact that it's the shape of a panhandle.

182
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:20,840
 Now Ian Jones' personal theory, which I agree, is that he deliberately drew the incision

183
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:26,560
 in the shape of a panhandle so that he could name it after himself.

184
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,280
 People do do this sometimes, don't they?

185
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:31,000
 Wasn't there an element of the period at Gallium?

186
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 Gallium, and it was named after a guy who's...

187
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,080
 So he said that he named it after France, because it's gold.

188
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:45,840
 But actually, I think he was called Le Coc, or something similar, which is chicken, and

189
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,440
 Gallus Gallus is the Latin for chicken.

190
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,440
 That's it, that's it.

191
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:55,560
 So yeah, like people do do it, and to be honest, it's such a coincidence, I've never seen

192
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,480
 the word Fanon Steel before.

193
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:02,040
 I mean, what if actually the surgery would be much better and easier to conduct if it was

194
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,840
 a completely different shape that doesn't look like a panhandle?

195
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,840
 Yes.

196
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:09,800
 It could be that, you know, all these years, people who are having caissarians are having

197
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,120
 the wrong shape just because of his...

198
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,480
 Well, we should look into that.

199
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,480
 That's insane.

200
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,480
 That's really...

201
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,480
 That's a really good fact.

202
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,480
 That's very good.

203
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,480
 And great theory.

204
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,800
 I can give you more on surgeons.

205
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,800
 Yeah.

206
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,800
 Yeah, go on.

207
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:28,080
 John Casimir Félix Guillon was born in Rayunion.

208
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:33,640
 He came up with a new way of removing bloodestones through the paradigm, but he's more famous

209
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:38,320
 for being the probable inspiration for this song Frerajacca.

210
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,320
 No way!

211
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,320
 Wow.

212
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,800
 My little one sings that nonstop at the moment.

213
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,240
 Did they know that it's about removing bloodestones through the paradigm?

214
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,880
 No, but we never get to the third version of the song, so...

215
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,400
 So what are the lines of your Frerajacca, Frerajacca?

216
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,400
 Dormaboo.

217
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,400
 Dormaboo.

218
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,400
 Sonema, Matina.

219
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,400
 Sonema, Matina.

220
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,880
 Ding, dang, dong, ding, dang, dong.

221
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,880
 So is that...

222
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,640
 We've had a patient come in complaining of severe...

223
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:03,120
 It's the sound of the bloodestones falling into the pan.

224
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,400
 It's the ding, dang, dong.

225
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,400
 Good.

226
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,400
 Good.

227
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,400
 Wow.

228
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:16,880
 Is the perineum, the bit in between the genital and the other genital opening?

229
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,520
 What's the grondal?

230
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,000
 It might just be you, Dan.

231
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,480
 I thought that was another term for that, OK?

232
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,960
 I've never come across that.

233
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,960
 Have you not?

234
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:31,040
 So the band that does our theme tune and pre-yes, Ash, who wrote our song and sings the song,

235
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,040
 he was originally in a band called Grondal.

236
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,160
 And I'm pretty sure it was too much to...

237
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,160
 Wow.

238
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,160
 Is Aussie slang?

239
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,160
 No, no, no, no.

240
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:42,240
 All right, Mr. Shriver, let's get you up on the chair and just have a quick look at the

241
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,240
 grondal, sir.

242
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,440
 Oh, you got a bad case of the Frerajac, is there, mate?

243
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,520
 Dan, let's have another fact.

244
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,520
 OK.

245
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:53,560
 Here's not so much a fact, but a great pub quiz question.

246
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,560
 All right.

247
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,160
 So this is from John Dunn.

248
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:02,000
 He says, "My favourite pub, the Metrophysical Poet."

249
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,960
 He says, "My favourite pub quiz question is, and here's a question now, and I'm going to

250
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:13,240
 ask it to you too, what are furthest north, south, east, and west states of the United States?"

251
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,240
 Come on, mate.

252
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,240
 Yeah, you're OK.

253
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,240
 I think I was born yesterday.

254
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,240
 All right.

255
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,480
 So let's start with south.

256
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,920
 What's the...

257
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,160
 What's the...

258
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,160
 Softest?

259
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,160
 Softest.

260
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,160
 Um...

261
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,120
 I'm going to say Dakota.

262
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,120
 You have to go to...

263
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,120
 No.

264
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:35,720
 It's a trick question.

265
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,720
 OK.

266
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,720
 Well, for me, it has to be North Carolina.

267
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,720
 OK.

268
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,400
 No, it must be Hawaii.

269
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,400
 It is Hawaii.

270
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,400
 Oh, very good.

271
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,400
 Correct.

272
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:48,160
 What is the north-fist state?

273
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,160
 No.

274
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:52,600
 I think that has to be South Dakota.

275
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:58,120
 OK, playing seriously for a second, I'll say Alaska.

276
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,120
 Correct.

277
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,120
 It is Alaska.

278
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,120
 It is, that is correct.

279
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,120
 OK.

280
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,120
 So, one each.

281
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,120
 Yep.

282
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,120
 Westest.

283
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,120
 Westest.

284
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,360
 I would say Alaska.

285
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,360
 Alaska.

286
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,360
 Correct.

287
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,360
 It is Alaska.

288
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,360
 Oh.

289
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,360
 Yeah.

290
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,360
 Interestingly, it's got north and west.

291
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,360
 Yeah.

292
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,360
 So, OK.

293
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,880
 That's two, one, but you probably might have said the same.

294
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,880
 I would.

295
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,520
 And also, I'm going to get the next one right.

296
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,520
 OK.

297
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:26,160
 So, I'll get this one to Andy.

298
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,200
 Most Eastest.

299
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:33,040
 I feel like it's going to be a trick, but I'll say--

300
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,040
 West Virginia.

301
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,040
 West Virginia.

302
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,040
 Yeah.

303
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:39,960
 No, I'll say one of those ones over on the far right-hand side.

304
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,960
 I'll say Rhode Island.

305
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,960
 Rhode Island.

306
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,960
 Incorrect.

307
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,960
 James.

308
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,880
 I'm going to say it's Alaska again.

309
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,880
 Correct.

310
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,880
 I'll see Aleutian Islands go over the international date life.

311
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,880
 I'll have to say.

312
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,880
 Yeah.

313
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,880
 Is that amazing?

314
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,880
 South of the only one.

315
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,880
 Hawaii that is not claimed by Alaska.

316
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:59,280
 So, north, east, west are all Alaska.

317
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,280
 Yeah.

318
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,280
 OK.

319
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,280
 Here's one.

320
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:09,880
 Kathy Oliver from Ontario, which is at least in the same hemisphere as most of Alaska.

321
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:14,680
 She said, my husband and I love your podcast, and it keeps us entertained on drives to my various

322
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:19,440
 treatments over the last two years, which leads me to a fact idea for you when you get

323
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:25,560
 to stem cell transplant, you will stink of creamed corn for a couple of days.

324
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,560
 Wow.

325
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,560
 OK.

326
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:33,680
 So, the stem cells are frozen using a substance called dimethyl sulfoxide, the MSO, and it stops

327
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:40,080
 them from getting damaged, but it has this peculiar odor that smells to most people like

328
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,080
 creamed corn.

329
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:47,760
 The MSO actually is very pungent, but to such an extent that you can taste it by touching

330
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,760
 it.

331
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:53,360
 It had a Petri dish of the MSO now, and you put your finger in it, you'd be able to taste

332
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,360
 it.

333
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,360
 Wow.

334
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,200
 And that's because it directly triggers the nerves that normally react to taste.

335
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,200
 That's insane.

336
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,200
 Yeah.

337
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,200
 That's absolutely insane.

338
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,840
 How many different foods does that work with?

339
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,200
 This is not a food.

340
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,200
 OK.

341
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:09,400
 This is a chemical, and I don't know of any food stuff.

342
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:13,360
 I guess garlic could do it like that, maybe, because that seems to go through your skin,

343
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,360
 but that's just, I guess.

344
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,360
 I mean, I don't know.

345
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,360
 The theory about that.

346
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,200
 I don't remember you walking around with an onion in your salt to see if you could taste

347
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,200
 it.

348
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,200
 It's your research.

349
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,200
 Yeah, yeah.

350
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,280
 I've got two pictures for you off the back of this.

351
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,280
 Oh, yeah.

352
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:27,120
 So number one, there should be a Googleful smells.

353
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,440
 That should just be a Googleful smells.

354
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:33,680
 How do you, what do you, what do you search as in what do you tie, you're not typing.

355
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,680
 You're not typing.

356
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,680
 Well, you're typing with your nose.

357
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,160
 So what do you put in that you're trying to find like, I haven't worked out all the

358
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,160
 details yet.

359
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,760
 Is it like shazam instead of a phone?

360
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:50,920
 You hold a giant nose, that's the area where you are and it goes, hmm, it's crumpets.

361
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,320
 That's exactly what it is.

362
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,320
 Very nice.

363
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,320
 Okay, brilliant.

364
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,320
 That's good.

365
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,320
 Right.

366
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,320
 We solved that one.

367
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,320
 Well, I feel like I came up with that idea.

368
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,320
 Really.

369
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,320
 Like, we were on the room.

370
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,320
 Three-way split.

371
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,320
 Really great.

372
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,320
 Great work, everyone.

373
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,800
 See you for the first set of quarterly results.

374
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,800
 Okay.

375
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,520
 So second idea off the back of that, the touch restaurant, right?

376
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:12,240
 You don't eat anything, but you just go in and you put your fingers through holes

377
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,080
 in the table into various different foods that you can then taste.

378
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,080
 Yeah.

379
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,080
 Right.

380
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:24,320
 Okay, but the only thing on the menu is DMSO so far, so far, maybe some garlic.

381
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,440
 But you've got to wear it for a month.

382
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,800
 But I think that will be good if we can find enough foods that you can taste through your

383
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,800
 fingertips.

384
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,800
 Yeah.

385
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,800
 That would be awesome.

386
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,560
 I've got to say, I'm in on the shazam nose.

387
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,240
 Andy, I'll let you develop this a bit more before committing.

388
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:40,880
 I'm sharing it with you guys three ways no matter what, including the debts.

389
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:41,880
 Okay.

390
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:48,600
 I just want to say to everyone listening to this, I'm happy to share my shazam nose with

391
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,840
 everyone who's listening to this.

392
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:55,640
 We can all have 0.0 1%, that's really generous.

393
00:16:55,640 --> 00:17:01,520
 But one of you listening will have to make it.

394
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,800
 Here's nice.

395
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,800
 Do you want to do another one?

396
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,800
 I'm the other one.

397
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,800
 Don't you want to jump in?

398
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,960
 Yeah, I've got one here.

399
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:16,200
 So this is from Edward Maloy, who says this is their favorite fact, Norwich, is the only

400
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,920
 city in history to be excommunicated.

401
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:24,400
 In 1274, after a riot in the cathedral, Pope Gregory X excommunicated the entire city until

402
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:29,040
 they repented and repaired the damage done to church property.

403
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:34,920
 Clearly, it has had a lasting effect as Norwich is now the least religious city in England

404
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,400
 per the 2011 census.

405
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,400
 Is that right?

406
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,400
 Kind of right.

407
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,400
 So it's almost right.

408
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,120
 I didn't fully get an answer to the excommunication.

409
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:51,120
 But Norwich is very much not a religious city anymore.

410
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,160
 It's interesting because there's a saying about Norwich, which is that it has a church

411
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,200
 for every week of the year and a pub for every day.

412
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,200
 So a lot of churches.

413
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,720
 That must be Norfolk, right?

414
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,720
 There's no way.

415
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,720
 There's strings.

416
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,720
 52 churches in Norwich, 11.

417
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,720
 Maybe there is.

418
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,720
 Maybe.

419
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,720
 Yeah.

420
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,720
 Yeah, absolutely.

421
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,720
 I take that back.

422
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,560
 I don't think there's exactly 365 pubs either.

423
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:15,560
 But it's the L.A. of Norfolk, I would say, Norwich.

424
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,560
 Right.

425
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,560
 Do you say so?

426
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,800
 It's the mega city of Norfolk, isn't it?

427
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,800
 Of Norfolk?

428
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,800
 Oh, yeah.

429
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,800
 There's Kingsland, of course.

430
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,800
 Oh, yeah.

431
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,800
 Of course, there's Kingsland.

432
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,800
 That's fair.

433
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,800
 There's Kingsland.

434
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:32,200
 Well, a census was done in 2021, and it showed that those who said that they don't have

435
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,800
 any religion, don't believe in any religion, was 53.5%.

436
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,800
 Wow.

437
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:46,760
 So 76,973 people, and that's a jump from a decade ago when it was 42.5, and that's 56,000

438
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,760
 people.

439
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,920
 So it's the second least religious city in the UK.

440
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,120
 Oh, I think I know this one.

441
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,120
 Town or city.

442
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,120
 Yeah.

443
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,120
 Isn't it?

444
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,120
 It's somewhere called Satan.

445
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,120
 Satan food.

446
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,120
 What?

447
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,120
 There's the least religious.

448
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,120
 That's not a city though.

449
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,120
 That's not a city though.

450
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,120
 No, it's not a city.

451
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,120
 It's a parish, isn't it?

452
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,120
 No.

453
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,120
 What?

454
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,800
 I think it's got an amusingly apt name, the least religious place in the UK, but I can't

455
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,800
 remember what the name is.

456
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,800
 I would have.

457
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:16,120
 Without knowing that little clue, I would have said most likely it would be somewhere like

458
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:20,800
 Brighton or Bristol, like somewhere where lots of cool young people live.

459
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,800
 So, yeah.

460
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,800
 Strongly secular.

461
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,800
 Hmm.

462
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,800
 Do you want to have another guest, Andy?

463
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,800
 James has it right.

464
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,800
 But do you want to have another guest?

465
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,800
 No.

466
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,800
 I'm going to stick with Satan food.

467
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,800
 I think.

468
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,800
 Okay.

469
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,800
 Brighton and Hope.

470
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,800
 Wow.

471
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:37,120
 55.2% of people declaring no religion.

472
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,120
 Gosh.

473
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,120
 Yeah.

474
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,920
 Alistair Crowley had his funeral there.

475
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,920
 In Brighton.

476
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,920
 Yeah, it might have something to do with that.

477
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,920
 It is.

478
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,920
 Was he from that?

479
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:48,440
 No, but I think he passed away in Hastings and I think his body ended up in Brighton for

480
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,440
 some reason.

481
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,440
 He was cremated there.

482
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,440
 Yeah.

483
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,440
 Not so far, is it?

484
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,440
 No.

485
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,440
 It's on the coast.

486
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,440
 Very windy.

487
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,440
 Is it?

488
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:59,520
 Do you want to release those ashes and they're a couple making out?

489
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,680
 Here's one from me.

490
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:05,760
 I already have a bone to pick with Andrew Hunter Murray, it's episode two and I already

491
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,080
 have a bone to pick because you sent us these facts.

492
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:12,480
 And listen, think back to audience facts one.

493
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,280
 When I said, here's one from Wayne Height or is it Holt because it looks like it should

494
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,280
 be Holt?

495
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:24,400
 Well, this week I have one from Wayne Holt, H-O-L-T.

496
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,400
 I assume it's the same person and I assume one of them is a misspelling.

497
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,480
 I've got to track.

498
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:37,040
 Although I did have a eyesight check yesterday and I need reading glasses so maybe you need

499
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,040
 to check.

500
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,040
 Can you check?

501
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,040
 Is that a Height and a Holt?

502
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,040
 Yeah, it's a Height and a Holt.

503
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,040
 Right.

504
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,040
 Yeah.

505
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,040
 Okay.

506
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,200
 Wayne does write in a few writes in frequently.

507
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,080
 We have a few frequent flies in the fishing box.

508
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,280
 Does he change his name every time you write it?

509
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,280
 I've got to track.

510
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:56,600
 You've got to work on your pseudonyms, Wayne.

511
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,840
 What's the fact, James?

512
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:02,440
 Well, actually the fact is to do a spelling.

513
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,440
 Oh, no.

514
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:12,040
 The fact is that in concert the band Divo sometimes performed as their own opening act to pretending

515
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:18,080
 to be a Christian soft rock band called Dove, the band of love, which is an anagram of

516
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,080
 Divo.

517
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,080
 Very nice.

518
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,080
 That's really good.

519
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,640
 I'm really sorry, James.

520
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,640
 They're both from Wayne Height.

521
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,880
 Wayne Holt doesn't exist.

522
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,520
 That's not a real person.

523
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,520
 I've mistyped his name.

524
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:32,480
 There will be a Wayne Holt out there if you're listening, Wayne.

525
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,240
 Well, how's Wayne going to solve the situation?

526
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,120
 Wayne's only going to confuse matters.

527
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,120
 Yeah.

528
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,520
 If you happen to be listening to fish and you're called Wayne Holt, write in.

529
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,520
 Yeah.

530
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,520
 Let us know you exist.

531
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,520
 Yeah.

532
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,520
 Simple.

533
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,520
 Should I do one?

534
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,520
 Yeah.

535
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:53,440
 This is from Jessica Eringayson from Texas and she writes that Napoleon and Lord Wellington

536
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,000
 are kind of related and it's America's fault.

537
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 Okay.

538
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,640
 This is admittedly quite tenuous, but the story is is that Napoleon had a younger brother

539
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:08,880
 called Jerome who visited the US when he was in his late teens and he eloped with a lady

540
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:14,680
 called Elizabeth Patterson, then Napoleon wanted Jerome to come back and marry a European

541
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:19,440
 princess because it was part of his plan to consolidate power while he was conquesting

542
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,440
 territories.

543
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,440
 Right?

544
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,480
 So he brought Jerome back.

545
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:27,360
 Elizabeth stays, but then Elizabeth hops on a boat and Napoleon bans it from landing.

546
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:31,800
 So she has no choice but to go and port in London.

547
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,480
 So that's where she lands.

548
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:37,440
 Jerome remarries and basically they never see each other again.

549
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,440
 Wow.

550
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:42,440
 Now, the tenuous link that we've been given here from Jessica is that while she was in

551
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,320
 London, she was living with a lady called Marianne.

552
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,160
 Marianne was her sister-in-law.

553
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:51,880
 Marianne's husband dies and she remarries Richard Wellesley, who's the elder brother of Arthur

554
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,720
 Wellesley, who defeat Napoleon at Waterloo.

555
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,720
 Good Lord.

556
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,720
 Yeah.

557
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,720
 It's more world, isn't it?

558
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,760
 I've signed to think it's a slightly bigger world than I was imagining.

559
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,760
 Okay.

560
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,640
 I mean, I was lost so long ago.

561
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,640
 Yeah.

562
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,240
 It's just about clung on till the end.

563
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,240
 I tell you what, though.

564
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,120
 I did recently visit the room where Wellington died.

565
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,120
 Did you?

566
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,120
 Yeah.

567
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,120
 I went down to Walma Castle in Kent.

568
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,600
 Oh, it's a good day out.

569
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,600
 Hmm.

570
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,600
 It's really good.

571
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,600
 It's a proper castle.

572
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,600
 It's 400 years old.

573
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,440
 It's not one of these sort of plastic castles that you get these days, you know, sort of like fake

574
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,440
 castles, which is just to state the home with a view.

575
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,440
 That's Disneyland.

576
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,440
 Disneyland.

577
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,440
 It's not Disneyland.

578
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,440
 It's no, it's proper.

579
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:34,480
 And they had, there's a thing called being the Wharton of the Sync Ports.

580
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,480
 It looks like it's Sank, French or five, but it's not.

581
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,480
 It's Wharton of the Sync Ports.

582
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,480
 That's how it's done.

583
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,480
 But it does mean five, right?

584
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,480
 There were five pots.

585
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,600
 It does mean five, and it's spelled like the French or five, but it is, I swear to God,

586
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,440
 they pronounce it Wharton of the Sync Ports.

587
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,440
 Okay.

588
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,440
 I swear.

589
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,000
 And it said to the lady, nice to be visiting the Sank Ports, she said Sank Ports.

590
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,920
 Anyway, she probably said that a hundred times a day for 20 years.

591
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,680
 You don't want to be calling your pot Sank anyway.

592
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,320
 You're absolutely right.

593
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,800
 It's a crazy choice.

594
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:03,800
 But there is this honorary possession called Wharton of the Sync Ports, and Wellington

595
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,800
 was that.

596
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,800
 So was the Queen Mum.

597
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:10,080
 The old Queen Mum, and actually, when I visited, they had a Queen Mum lookalike there

598
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,080
 for the day.

599
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,080
 Did they?

600
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,080
 Yeah.

601
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,080
 Along with the kind of...

602
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,080
 That kind of work must be dry enough a bit.

603
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:20,000
 Well, I made this sort of casual joke about Jen, and she looks so disapproving.

604
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,440
 Because you know, the Queen Mum, she loved her Jen.

605
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,440
 She liked to drink.

606
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,440
 I can't, Andy.

607
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,440
 This was a tough day for you.

608
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:31,000
 First of all, you walk in and mispronounce Sank Ports, and then you make a perfectly harmless

609
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,680
 joke about Jen, so the Queen Mum lookalike.

610
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,880
 And then I find out Wellington's dead.

611
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,760
 It was awful.

612
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:42,960
 It was terrible, but no, it's a really evocative ring, because they've got this tiny bed.

613
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:47,120
 There's this camp bed, there's a military camp bed that is still there from the day he died,

614
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:51,680
 and he must have died in about 1850, but he took this bed with him wherever he went.

615
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:56,040
 When he went up to London to be the Prime Minister, that military camp bed went with him.

616
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,040
 How interesting.

617
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:00,960
 He slept in that bed in Downing Street, and then when he became warden with the Sank Ports,

618
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,040
 he brought the bed back to Warmer Castle, and that's the bed where he died.

619
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:09,000
 I went to the place where Napoleon surrendered, which is in France somewhere.

620
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,680
 Is it Ilderae or somewhere?

621
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,680
 I can't remember.

622
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,480
 I yield to France, yield to Ilderae, something like that.

623
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:20,280
 I might be misremembering this, but I seem to remember that he had quite a non-onate bed

624
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,760
 as well.

625
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:28,360
 I remember being there and thinking, "Wow, for someone who's so important in history,

626
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,360
 what a shit bed."

627
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,360
 These military beds.

628
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:34,560
 I think it's the military like they used to the campaigning lifestyle.

629
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:37,600
 I saw the bed that Abraham Lincoln died in.

630
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,600
 Really?

631
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,600
 It's when we were in DC.

632
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,440
 We had a bit of time off, because he was shot in the fourth theatre, but then he was taken

633
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,880
 to a house, not too far away.

634
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,280
 He could just need a little nap, and I'd go, "That's all right."

635
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,280
 Just butterscotch.

636
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:57,560
 No, they brought it to a house, and so he died in a bed that was, his legs were hanging

637
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,560
 off the edge, basically.

638
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,560
 He was tall.

639
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:03,520
 He was super tall, and the bed was quite small, and you can visit his bed.

640
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,520
 You can visit this.

641
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,520
 Yeah.

642
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,520
 Okay.

643
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,520
 Here we are.

644
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,520
 Okay.

645
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:14,360
 We sell replica beds of the great beds of history, and we're going to clean up on the finance

646
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:17,640
 bros who want to think that they're living like Napoleon or Wellington.

647
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,640
 Or Lincoln.

648
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:23,160
 I mean, those are three perfect examples of beds of the greats, right?

649
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,160
 Yes.

650
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:28,280
 Like, you too can conquer Europe with our £9,000 bed.

651
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,280
 Yeah.

652
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,280
 Yeah.

653
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,280
 And we'll just sell them in military campbed.

654
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,280
 What do you think?

655
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,280
 I love it.

656
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,280
 Okay.

657
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,280
 All right.

658
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:39,680
 We're going to have not point, not, not one percent.

659
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,680
 Okay.

660
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:44,800
 So I think that's enough facts for the day that we've been sent in, but we still have one

661
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,800
 more thing to do.

662
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:50,360
 And that is to name some custodians of the archive.

663
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:56,640
 So anyone who is in our top tier on Patreon becomes a custodian of a fact from no such thing

664
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,640
 as a fish.

665
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,640
 It's very exciting.

666
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,200
 I'm a custodian myself.

667
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:05,200
 If you'd remember listening back to episode one of this little fish, but there will

668
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,480
 be more custodians names today.

669
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:11,920
 We will tell you your name, which you might already know.

670
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:14,740
 And then we'll tell you the fact that you're the custodian of.

671
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:21,120
 So Andrew, who is going to be our first nonfish member who is a custodian of a fish fact?

672
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,320
 I just want to say that was incredibly slick jokes.

673
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:28,040
 And the concept of the shout out is clearly very well embedded in your head.

674
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,800
 First up today for a shout out is Rachel Not.

675
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:36,440
 And her fact is the first ever sandwich that we know about contained wine.

676
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,440
 Congratulations, Rachel.

677
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,440
 Yes.

678
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,960
 That is now your fact forever.

679
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,200
 Bill out of the elder.

680
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,200
 Is it?

681
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,200
 Bill out?

682
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,200
 Bill out?

683
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,200
 Yes, something.

684
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,200
 Bill out.

685
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,600
 And it was, um, it was more of a wrap.

686
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,600
 It was more of a wrap.

687
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:52,480
 It had like, um, currency or something, right?

688
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,480
 It sounds delicious.

689
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,480
 Yeah.

690
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,480
 I think we said this at the time.

691
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,480
 11 years ago.

692
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,480
 Perfect covered on the show.

693
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,480
 Anyway, yeah.

694
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,480
 Rachel, that's your fact.

695
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:03,160
 And the sandwich is in the out of sandwich who we just covered again a week or two ago in

696
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,160
 recorded.

697
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,160
 Yes, we did, of course.

698
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,560
 Well, we're on a big wheel, aren't we?

699
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,560
 We are.

700
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,560
 Dan, have you got one?

701
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,560
 Uh, yeah.

702
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:14,160
 This is a fact that is now going to belong to Silas Gill.

703
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:19,680
 And that is in 2003, three people in Mexico died of acne.

704
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,680
 Oh.

705
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,680
 Oh.

706
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:25,440
 If you put a gun to my head and said, you've got a thousand guesses as to the Christian

707
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,120
 name of the second ever person to become a friend of the podcast.

708
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,800
 Silas would have not been one of my thousand guesses.

709
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,800
 No.

710
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,800
 It's just a terrific name.

711
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:38,560
 Because I think these in order of the people who signed up so literally, I think Rachel and

712
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:45,040
 Silas had to have had the hand hovering over the Patreon button as the time struck midnight.

713
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,040
 Yeah.

714
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,040
 Wow.

715
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:51,680
 And we should say Silas isn't especially fish friendly name, Silas Marna, by friend of the

716
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,680
 podcast.

717
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,680
 Samuel Taylor Colouridge.

718
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,680
 You're jelly-ed.

719
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,680
 That's right.

720
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,760
 Um, okay.

721
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:03,520
 So the third custodian this week, this is a Dan Schreiber fact.

722
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:10,160
 And the fact is that amongst the other scientists called Einstein, there are M E Einstein who came

723
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:17,640
 up with a formula for predicting the composition of a pork carcass and rosemary Einstein who co-investigated

724
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:24,440
 the use of cannabis, alcohol and tobacco on 300 young persons at her university.

725
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,440
 Could have done with it.

726
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,440
 That it done.

727
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,680
 We're going to need a bigger certificate.

728
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:34,920
 But drumroll, that fact now is under the custodianship of Helen Cosgrove Davis.

729
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:35,920
 Actually.

730
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,920
 There he is.

731
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,920
 Nice.

732
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,920
 That was a great episode.

733
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:42,520
 That was a fact I took from a Mark Abrams book of the ignoble prizes who James and I are going

734
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,520
 to be seeing tomorrow.

735
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,520
 He's in London.

736
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,520
 Well, a lot of it will.

737
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,520
 Yeah.

738
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:50,680
 Along with Kate Smollaker who did the paper about the first case of homosexual necrophilia

739
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,680
 in the Maladduck.

740
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:55,120
 Yep. And who raised awareness for pubic lice because they might be going extinct.

741
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,560
 It's going to be a spicy lunch tomorrow.

742
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,560
 Oh.

743
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:01,520
 As long as he's not cooking, I don't really mind.

744
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,520
 Oh, congratulations, Helen.

745
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:07,600
 That's the longest fact that's become custodian so far.

746
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,560
 Until the next damn fact.

747
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:12,960
 Shall I round us off with one more?

748
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:13,960
 Yeah, go on there.

749
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:14,960
 All right.

750
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,920
 This is a fact that is now under the stewardship of Darcy.

751
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:19,920
 Mr. Darcy.

752
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,800
 I can only assume fits William, if you're listening.

753
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,800
 Congratulations.

754
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:28,840
 And it's one of my facts is that the first contact lenses cost as much as a car.

755
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:33,880
 Yes, you went to the museum, didn't you, to see the British Optical Association Museum.

756
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:38,600
 Those were the days where we used to do proper research.

757
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,600
 Episode two.

758
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,600
 Quickly under that.

759
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,600
 Yeah.

760
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,600
 Although we're on a big wheel.

761
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,600
 I went back there recently.

762
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,600
 No.

763
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,600
 For a party.

764
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,600
 Yeah.

765
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,600
 Yeah.

766
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,600
 They were finishing their refurbishment of the museum.

767
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,600
 It's really good.

768
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,720
 They were the datesment of the headquarters of the British Optical Association.

769
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:57,840
 And they invited some celebs along and they also know so they invited me.

770
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:01,480
 Well, who are the other big celebs who are at the party?

771
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,480
 I can't name names.

772
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,480
 I'm sorry.

773
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:06,440
 It's very much an eyes-wide shot situation, everyone was in masks.

774
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,560
 Ironically, considering they're optometrists.

775
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,560
 Brilliant.

776
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:13,160
 Does everyone wear masks in an eyes-wide shot?

777
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,160
 They do.

778
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,160
 Okay, good.

779
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,160
 In sodium scenes, not the whole way through.

780
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,160
 Yeah.

781
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,160
 That was very much a reach of a reference for me.

782
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,440
 You know when you try and do a reference or something, but you know.

783
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,200
 You mean like when you say Samuel Taylor Coleridge wrote...

784
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,200
 Silas Marner.

785
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,200
 Silas Marner.

786
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,200
 Yep.

787
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,200
 Exactly.

788
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,200
 Exactly.

789
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,800
 Because the thing is normally in a podcast, I would say that and then I cut it out because

790
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,800
 I knew I got it wrong.

791
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,800
 Yeah.

792
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,800
 Because I check it later.

793
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,800
 Yeah.

794
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,720
 But I've referenced it twice now, so it's going to have to stay in.

795
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,600
 You've really shot yourself in the third.

796
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,600
 Okay.

797
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,600
 Well, they are.

798
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,520
 The next four custodians of facts in the nose, such things as fish, archive.

799
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,160
 Read the names again, Andy.

800
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,160
 It's Rachel Not.

801
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,640
 It's Gilles, Helen Colesgrove Davis and Darcy.

802
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:53,600
 For absolute legends, the first four people to sign up for our friend of the podcast here

803
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,840
 on Patreon.

804
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:59,680
 And you too can get your name mentioned on this show if you sign up to that tier.

805
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:02,120
 But for now, it is time for us to say goodbye.

806
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,120
 So, bye, Dan.

807
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,280
 It's goodbye from me.

808
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,280
 And it's goodbye from him.

809
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,280
 Bye.

810
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,280
 Bye.

811
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,280
 Bye.

812
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:18,280
