00:00:00,00:00:20,"Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast"
00:00:20,00:00:23,coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.
00:00:23,00:00:28,"My name is Dan Schreiber, and I am sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray,"
00:00:28,00:00:32,"and Anna Chazinsky, and once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our"
00:00:32,00:00:39,"four favorite facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:39,00:00:44,"Starting this week with my fact, my fact this week is that at rush hour, there are more"
00:00:44,00:00:49,people under the ground in London than there are above the ground in Edinburgh.
00:00:49,00:00:51,"Wow, that's great."
00:00:51,00:00:52,No.
00:00:52,00:00:53,And you don't mean dead people do you?
00:00:53,00:00:54,"No, I don't."
00:00:54,00:00:58,"I mean, rush hour, I mean the London Underground system."
00:00:58,00:01:03,There are more people on trains below the ground than there are people in total every day.
00:01:03,00:01:08,"Actually, you might have underestimated that because did you count people living in basement"
00:01:08,00:01:09,flats?
00:01:09,00:01:11,"No, I didn't."
00:01:11,00:01:12,You didn't.
00:01:12,00:01:14,I bet there are even more people.
00:01:14,00:01:16,What about dead people?
00:01:16,00:01:17,That's cold.
00:01:17,00:01:19,We can't go there.
00:01:19,00:01:23,"Actually, you know you just said dead people, and vaguely about population."
00:01:23,00:01:27,"I found out this week that the thing about there, this is probably something everyone else"
00:01:27,00:01:28,knows.
00:01:28,00:01:32,But the thing about there being more people alive today than had ever lived in the past is
00:01:32,00:01:34,so far wrong.
00:01:34,00:01:35,It's ridiculously wrong.
00:01:35,00:01:40,"So, you know you always hear that fact, and I think there's something like about 100 billion"
00:01:40,00:01:44,"people have been alive on earth, and obviously there isn't nearly that many people alive today,"
00:01:44,00:01:45,and so it's just rubbish.
00:01:45,00:01:46,Okay.
00:01:46,00:01:47,And let's come from.
00:01:47,00:01:48,Wow.
00:01:48,00:01:49,"Anyway, sorry about to you."
00:01:49,00:01:51,Busted a myth right at the top of the show.
00:01:51,00:01:52,That's exciting.
00:01:52,00:01:53,Is this people on the London Underground?
00:01:53,00:01:54,Yep.
00:01:54,00:01:55,This is people on the London Underground.
00:01:55,00:01:59,I read this fact in a Bill Bryson book called The Road to Little Dribbling.
00:01:59,00:02:01,It was his last tour of the UK.
00:02:01,00:02:06,"It was a follow-up to notes from a small island, and in it he's on the London Underground."
00:02:06,00:02:11,"He got the fact from Time Out, which is a magazine in London, and in it it said that daily"
00:02:11,00:02:16,"there were 600,000 people on the London Underground, and the population of Edinburgh is something"
00:02:16,00:02:17,"like 460,000."
00:02:17,00:02:20,Isn't it at any given moment on the Underground?
00:02:20,00:02:23,"Well, we thought that, and that's when I sent you guys that fact, but then I took it to"
00:02:23,00:02:27,"our calculations master, James, and said, ""Is that possible?"""
00:02:27,00:02:31,"And James worked out that that can't be right, but you said that it would be right for rush"
00:02:31,00:02:32,hour.
00:02:32,00:02:33,Yeah.
00:02:33,00:02:36,"I think the maximum that you might get at rush hour would be about 600,000."
00:02:36,00:02:39,"And do we think the population of Edinburgh is around 500,000?"
00:02:39,00:02:40,Something like that?
00:02:40,00:02:41,"Yeah, just under, yeah."
00:02:41,00:02:49,"I looked at some other 600,000s at the moment, and Ed Sheeran's shape of you just passed"
00:02:49,00:02:57,"around 600,000 downloads quite recently, but it's also been streamed 121 million times since"
00:02:57,00:02:58,it was released.
00:02:58,00:02:59,No way.
00:02:59,00:03:00,Yeah.
00:03:00,00:03:03,"And it's three minutes, 50 something long."
00:03:03,00:03:10,"And so if you add up all of those streamings together, it takes you to 893 years that people"
00:03:10,00:03:12,have been listening to that song.
00:03:12,00:03:18,"And so if you go into the future 893 years, then that's 100 years after Wally is set."
00:03:18,00:03:19,Oh.
00:03:19,00:03:24,And it's the time when scientists decimate that the radiation levels in Chernobyl will be
00:03:24,00:03:26,back down to normal.
00:03:26,00:03:28,That long for Chernobyl to be back?
00:03:28,00:03:29,"Well done, Ed Sheeran."
00:03:29,00:03:30,Wow.
00:03:30,00:03:31,What did I say?
00:03:31,00:03:32,Thanks for clearing up Chernobyl.
00:03:32,00:03:33,Yeah.
00:03:33,00:03:34,I've understood.
00:03:34,00:03:35,Yeah.
00:03:35,00:03:40,"But I mean, if we go by what happens in Wally, it doesn't look like a place to inhabit anymore."
00:03:40,00:03:43,"But it's 100 years after Wally, so maybe."
00:03:43,00:03:44,It's sorted itself out.
00:03:44,00:03:45,Sorted itself out.
00:03:45,00:03:46,Got back down.
00:03:46,00:03:48,That's the sequel.
00:03:48,00:03:50,"I've got a quibble with your fact, Dan."
00:03:50,00:03:51,Uh-oh.
00:03:51,00:03:52,Sure.
00:03:52,00:03:54,Half London Underground is overground.
00:03:54,00:03:55,"Oh, yes."
00:03:55,00:03:57,"So I'm just full stalling people right again, say."
00:03:57,00:03:58,Oh.
00:03:58,00:03:59,I know.
00:03:59,00:04:00,Really half of it is.
00:04:00,00:04:01,"More than half, I think."
00:04:01,00:04:01,More than half.
00:04:01,00:04:02,Yeah.
00:04:02,00:04:03,"God, how did we not think of that?"
00:04:03,00:04:04,"Didn't think of that, bit."
00:04:04,00:04:05,Yeah.
00:04:05,00:04:06,Wow.
00:04:06,00:04:07,"Oh, sorry."
00:04:07,00:04:09,"I've been keeping that under my hat as a sort of cool thing to bring up, which wouldn't"
00:04:09,00:04:12,necessarily invalidate the whole section.
00:04:12,00:04:13,But let's face it.
00:04:13,00:04:16,"The rush hour, no one's in those weird out-of-bit things."
00:04:16,00:04:17,"Yeah, exactly."
00:04:17,00:04:18,The weird out-of-the-car.
00:04:18,00:04:22,The tube does go.
00:04:22,00:04:23,It goes much further.
00:04:23,00:04:28,"I got offered a stand-up gig ages ago, and it was in Zone 9, which I didn't know existed."
00:04:28,00:04:30,"But I was like, sure, I can see it on the map."
00:04:30,00:04:32,It took something like two hours to get there.
00:04:32,00:04:33,Yeah.
00:04:33,00:04:39,"And when we emerged from the train, because you, as you say, some of it goes overground,"
00:04:39,00:04:42,"we emerged, and there were cows in my window."
00:04:42,00:04:45,There was literally a field with sheep and cows.
00:04:45,00:04:47,You can see that on the tube.
00:04:47,00:04:49,It used to go even further.
00:04:49,00:04:50,"Sorry, you had a joke."
00:04:50,00:04:53,I was just going to say this sounds like a really hot gig you were at.
00:04:53,00:04:56,[LAUGHTER]
00:04:56,00:05:02,"It was 1,000-seater barns somewhere."
00:05:02,00:05:04,You couldn't hear all the booze because of all the moose.
00:05:04,00:05:07,[LAUGHTER]
00:05:07,00:05:09,"No, it used to go even further than that, though."
00:05:09,00:05:12,"It used to-- the metropolitan line, which I think is the one that goes up to Zone 9."
00:05:12,00:05:14,So most stations don't have Zone 9.
00:05:14,00:05:17,Metropolitan line used to go 40 miles out of London.
00:05:17,00:05:18,Wow.
00:05:18,00:05:19,It used to go all the way to Ellsbury.
00:05:19,00:05:24,"We should say, for overseas people, Covent Garden, where we work, is in Zone 1."
00:05:24,00:05:26,"And then if you get a bit further out of London, North London, like--"
00:05:26,00:05:28,"You get to Zone 2, Zone 2."
00:05:28,00:05:30,"And then what comes after that, Dad?"
00:05:30,00:05:33,"So, interestingly, if you go to where I live, it's Zone 3."
00:05:33,00:05:36,And is that further out or closer in than Zone 2?
00:05:36,00:05:38,And that's just-- that's one further out.
00:05:38,00:05:39,OK.
00:05:39,00:05:41,"Yeah, but two further out than Zone 1."
00:05:41,00:05:44,"So, yeah, it's-- and then it works its way out to Zone 9."
00:05:44,00:05:45,Wow.
00:05:45,00:05:46,"Yeah, it's great."
00:05:46,00:05:48,"There's quite a few in between that, but we don't have time."
00:05:48,00:05:49,[LAUGHTER]
00:05:49,00:05:50,And they're one of the ones in between.
00:05:50,00:05:54,"So you go four, five."
00:05:54,00:06:01,"If you go out to one of the far zones, so this will be a number higher than four and five even,"
00:06:01,00:06:08,"you can get to the station Roding Valley, which is the least used station on the entire underground."
00:06:08,00:06:13,"And they have about 712 passengers a day, OK."
00:06:13,00:06:19,"And it's not as many as Edinburgh, but it is the same population as Elmington, the highest"
00:06:19,00:06:20,village in Warwickshire.
00:06:20,00:06:21,It is.
00:06:21,00:06:23,Exactly the same population.
00:06:23,00:06:25,According to the 2011 census.
00:06:25,00:06:29,"So, how are they getting from Elmington to Roding Valley?"
00:06:29,00:06:30,I see what you mean.
00:06:30,00:06:32,It's not the same people.
00:06:32,00:06:34,"Ah, that was confusing."
00:06:34,00:06:40,"And one person who does live in Elmington is Les Wexner, who's the man behind Victoria's"
00:06:40,00:06:41,secret.
00:06:41,00:06:42,Wow.
00:06:42,00:06:43,Oh.
00:06:43,00:06:46,"Not Victoria, the train station in London, though."
00:06:46,00:06:47,[LAUGHTER]
00:06:47,00:06:48,No.
00:06:48,00:06:49,Right.
00:06:49,00:06:50,What is Victoria's secret?
00:06:50,00:06:53,"Well, it's actually 65 metres underground."
00:06:53,00:06:54,[LAUGHTER]
00:06:54,00:07:00,Did you know that over 47 million litres of water pumped out of the underground every day?
00:07:00,00:07:01,"Oh, yeah."
00:07:01,00:07:02,"Oh, yeah."
00:07:02,00:07:03,"Yeah, because it's that far down."
00:07:03,00:07:06,"So, lots of water, lots of water in the ground, and it keeps on pouring in."
00:07:06,00:07:07,They keep on pumping it out.
00:07:07,00:07:09,"Why did they pump it out, too?"
00:07:09,00:07:10,Zoned 10.
00:07:10,00:07:11,[LAUGHTER]
00:07:11,00:07:12,I don't know.
00:07:12,00:07:14,"Um, that's really cool."
00:07:14,00:07:16,"So, it's pouring in."
00:07:16,00:07:17,"You never see it, do you?"
00:07:17,00:07:18,No.
00:07:18,00:07:21,They do quite a good job of keeping it away from the public sections.
00:07:21,00:07:22,Yeah.
00:07:22,00:07:23,Yeah.
00:07:23,00:07:24,Yeah.
00:07:24,00:07:25,They're impressive.
00:07:25,00:07:26,There are rivers that go through some of the stations out there.
00:07:26,00:07:27,Yeah.
00:07:27,00:07:28,Slow and square.
00:07:28,00:07:29,"If you look above the platform, there's a tube."
00:07:29,00:07:30,And that tube has a river in it.
00:07:30,00:07:31,No way.
00:07:31,00:07:32,Yeah.
00:07:32,00:07:34,"Oh, what is it called?"
00:07:34,00:07:35,"It's not the fleet, is it?"
00:07:35,00:07:36,"It's, no, it's the Westbourne."
00:07:36,00:07:37,"Oh, that fleet."
00:07:37,00:07:38,It goes through Farringdon.
00:07:38,00:07:39,Right.
00:07:39,00:07:41,And they just look like sewers these days.
00:07:41,00:07:42,But they used to be rivers.
00:07:42,00:07:44,They used to be London's subsidiary rivers.
00:07:44,00:07:46,"So, there's not like pedalos and stuff."
00:07:46,00:07:47,[LAUGHTER]
00:07:47,00:07:49,Now there's some pedalos for rats.
00:07:49,00:07:50,Very horrible.
00:07:50,00:07:54,"And you can go to, um, certain shops in central London"
00:07:54,00:07:56,where the owners have in their basement.
00:07:56,00:07:59,"They've dug through the ground, and you can see the river passing."
00:07:59,00:08:00,Really?
00:08:00,00:08:03,"Yeah, so they sort of do it as an attraction that you can go"
00:08:03,00:08:06,"and see within their shop, the rivers of London, that no longer exist."
00:08:06,00:08:07,"Oh, why?"
00:08:07,00:08:08,Yeah.
00:08:08,00:08:10,"Um, when they were building the New York subway,"
00:08:10,00:08:13,"the guys who were building it were called sandhogs,"
00:08:13,00:08:14,because they dug through lots of sand.
00:08:14,00:08:18,"And I was reading a newspaper report from 1916,"
00:08:18,00:08:22,"and it was about this guy called Marshall Maybe,"
00:08:22,00:08:26,"who was working in the tunnel to, like, dig the subway."
00:08:26,00:08:28,"And there was a pocket of compressed air,"
00:08:28,00:08:30,which suddenly kind of escaped.
00:08:30,00:08:33,"So he's, like, got this big shield up in the tunnel in front of him,"
00:08:33,00:08:35,"and they're using this shield to, like, push forward"
00:08:35,00:08:36,and make the tunnel bigger.
00:08:36,00:08:40,"And he said he saw an 18-inch pocket of air suddenly appear,"
00:08:40,00:08:42,and it sucked him towards it.
00:08:42,00:08:43,Whoa.
00:08:43,00:08:44,He was sucked into it.
00:08:44,00:08:46,"He was blasted up through the ground,"
00:08:46,00:08:49,"so he was blasted up through a 12-feet of riverbed,"
00:08:49,00:08:51,"and then blasted up through the river itself,"
00:08:51,00:08:55,and then hurled up 25 feet in the air above the river.
00:08:55,00:08:58,"He wasn't grinding through earth, 12 feet of earth, wasn't he?"
00:08:58,00:09:00,"Yeah, that's what riverbed's made of."
00:09:00,00:09:01,Yeah.
00:09:01,00:09:04,It's more plausible for him to be blasted through 12-feet
00:09:04,00:09:06,of earth and 12-feet of concrete or steel or whatever.
00:09:06,00:09:09,"No, I was thinking was it just a tunnel,"
00:09:09,00:09:11,"like it was a hole that he was blasted through,"
00:09:11,00:09:12,just happened to be going through.
00:09:12,00:09:13,"Oh, believe it."
00:09:13,00:09:14,So here we go.
00:09:14,00:09:16,Let me-- there's a hole in two with him and everything.
00:09:16,00:09:18,"There's a nice interview with his wife saying,"
00:09:18,00:09:19,"""It's okay. He's fine."""
00:09:19,00:09:21,He's looking forward to going back to work.
00:09:21,00:09:23,This is what the New York Times said at the time.
00:09:23,00:09:26,There's a pocket of compressed air to prevent
00:09:26,00:09:28,the river's bottom from caving in.
00:09:28,00:09:32,So they have some-- I don't know how that works.
00:09:32,00:09:36,"But somehow, it happened, guys,"
00:09:36,00:09:38,"and this compressed air got loose,"
00:09:38,00:09:41,"and he saw an 18-inch hole,"
00:09:41,00:09:43,"and before we knew it, he was being sucked towards it."
00:09:43,00:09:45,"Two of his colleagues actually also got sucked in,"
00:09:45,00:09:46,and they did perish.
00:09:46,00:09:47,"Oh, no."
00:09:47,00:09:49,"He survived by blasting up,"
00:09:49,00:09:51,putting his arm out in front of him and blasting up
00:09:51,00:09:52,through the riverbed.
00:09:52,00:09:55,So it's a whole bit deeper.
00:09:55,00:09:58,12 feet of riverbed.
00:09:58,00:10:01,"And then got shot through, and then out in the air."
00:10:01,00:10:03,"Then there's enough force left over,"
00:10:03,00:10:05,"shot through the river for itself,"
00:10:05,00:10:06,"and then, yeah, 25 feet."
00:10:06,00:10:07,25 feet.
00:10:07,00:10:09,25 feet.
00:10:09,00:10:11,The New York Times is a favourite.
00:10:11,00:10:12,What year is this?
00:10:12,00:10:13,What year is this?
00:10:13,00:10:17,"Yeah, and what date was this?"
00:10:17,00:10:19,"February 19, 16, right?"
00:10:19,00:10:21,Not April.
00:10:21,00:10:24,"Yeah, it was a little bit insane,"
00:10:24,00:10:26,but there you go.
00:10:26,00:10:27,There's a picture of the guy.
00:10:27,00:10:28,Oh.
00:10:28,00:10:29,Pictures don't lie.
00:10:29,00:10:30,"What, mid-flight?"
00:10:30,00:10:31,"No, mid-flight."
00:10:31,00:10:32,Yeah.
00:10:32,00:10:34,That's extraordinary.
00:10:34,00:10:35,Did you say that was in New York?
00:10:35,00:10:36,Yeah.
00:10:36,00:10:38,"It was soft ground, so that's why they were called soft ground."
00:10:38,00:10:40,"Oh, well, if it was soft ground, I see."
00:10:40,00:10:42,"Yeah, it was still a riverbed though."
00:10:42,00:10:44,I had a 25 feet after 12 beds of...
00:10:44,00:10:45,And a river.
00:10:45,00:10:46,And a river.
00:10:46,00:10:49,I don't know how it possibly happened.
00:10:49,00:10:52,"I was imagining him being carried up in the bubble of air,"
00:10:52,00:10:54,like in a cropped submarine or something.
00:10:54,00:10:56,That was amazing.
00:10:56,00:10:57,"Oh, my God."
00:10:57,00:11:00,Do you know what the underground was used for during the Second World War?
00:11:00,00:11:03,It was hospitals?
00:11:03,00:11:04,I thought Bum Shelter.
00:11:04,00:11:05,Yeah.
00:11:05,00:11:06,"That was definitely used as Bum Shelters,"
00:11:06,00:11:11,but also the central line was converted into a fighter aircraft factory.
00:11:11,00:11:13,"Oh, really?"
00:11:13,00:11:16,It stretched for two miles and it had its own train system.
00:11:16,00:11:18,I don't know if it was the actual tube trains.
00:11:18,00:11:21,How did they get the aircraft up the escalator?
00:11:21,00:11:24,"What they did is they had some compressed air,"
00:11:24,00:11:27,and they would just blast them up into the sky.
00:11:27,00:11:28,Isn't that amazing?
00:11:28,00:11:30,And that was an official secret until the 1980s.
00:11:30,00:11:31,"I'm with Adder, actually."
00:11:31,00:11:33,How did they get them out?
00:11:33,00:11:35,"Well, in piecemeal, I imagine."
00:11:35,00:11:36,"Oh, OK."
00:11:36,00:11:37,Or they had a lift or something.
00:11:37,00:11:38,Right.
00:11:38,00:11:42,Did you know that Roosevelt had his own underground station built?
00:11:42,00:11:45,"Or there was an underground station built underneath the Waldorf Historia,"
00:11:45,00:11:48,which is the really famous hotel in New York.
00:11:48,00:11:51,And it was just for people staying at the Waldorf Historia.
00:11:51,00:11:52,So it was one station.
00:11:52,00:11:54,And if you didn't want to go with the plebs to ground central station
00:11:54,00:11:56,"or one of the proper tube stations,"
00:11:56,00:11:59,you could just get a lift underground in your hotel.
00:11:59,00:12:01,"And it said, if you brought your own carriage with you,"
00:12:01,00:12:03,so if you had your own carriage.
00:12:03,00:12:04,What do you do with your carriage?
00:12:04,00:12:05,Who's the beep people?
00:12:05,00:12:07,Those who had their own trains?
00:12:07,00:12:08,What do you do with your trains?
00:12:08,00:12:10,You attach it to the back of the tubes.
00:12:10,00:12:12,And Roosevelt was...
00:12:12,00:12:14,And Roosevelt was...
00:12:14,00:12:16,This is sounding nearly as plausible as your man...
00:12:16,00:12:17,And we're just coming up.
00:12:17,00:12:18,And we're just coming up.
00:12:18,00:12:19,You're not supposed to do that.
00:12:19,00:12:21,So he's been the morning hallucinating.
00:12:21,00:12:23,"Oh, Anna, you've got dance notes there."
00:12:23,00:12:26,So this is...
00:12:26,00:12:30,"This is researched on by this guy called Dan Brooker,"
00:12:30,00:12:31,who's looked into this.
00:12:31,00:12:34,He's a tour guide on the New York metro system.
00:12:34,00:12:37,"And he said that FDR used it to hide his disability,"
00:12:37,00:12:39,so people didn't have to see him kind of walking from the tube.
00:12:39,00:12:43,And so there would be trains that led to this private underground station
00:12:43,00:12:46,"that could fit his big, arm-a-plated car,"
00:12:46,00:12:48,which would then drive off the train onto the platform
00:12:48,00:12:50,and straight into the elevator.
00:12:50,00:12:53,And then his limousine would be lifted up the elevator
00:12:53,00:12:57,and backed out into the grand ballroom of the door.
00:12:57,00:12:59,So he would drive into an elevator?
00:12:59,00:13:00,Yeah.
00:13:00,00:13:01,In a limousine.
00:13:01,00:13:02,Yeah.
00:13:02,00:13:03,It was already a big lift.
00:13:03,00:13:04,And it's not on it.
00:13:04,00:13:06,But then you get to the lift and there's actually a plane in there
00:13:06,00:13:09,"and he's like, ""Oh, wait for the next one."""
00:13:09,00:13:11,"I don't know, I know."
00:13:11,00:13:12,Yeah.
00:13:12,00:13:14,"So, yeah, this researcher says it,"
00:13:14,00:13:16,but it was definitely then Roosevelt definitely used it
00:13:16,00:13:17,to hide his disability.
00:13:17,00:13:19,They used to have first-class and third-class
00:13:19,00:13:21,"on a couple of London underground lights,"
00:13:21,00:13:24,but no second-class very weirdly.
00:13:24,00:13:27,"Ah, see, that's why I had to explain the zone system earlier."
00:13:27,00:13:30,It was a very good example of numbers being left out.
00:13:30,00:13:33,"Yeah, and you would have to wait at particular bits of the platform"
00:13:33,00:13:35,depending on what class ticket you had.
00:13:35,00:13:38,"Why did they not have a second class, I wonder?"
00:13:38,00:13:42,It was because there's a stipulation in a railway regulation act
00:13:42,00:13:43,"in the mid-19th century,"
00:13:43,00:13:46,which said all train companies have to offer third-class accommodation.
00:13:46,00:13:47,"Oh, I see."
00:13:47,00:13:48,So four people can afford it.
00:13:48,00:13:52,And then eventually they just got rid of first-class.
00:13:52,00:13:56,"So now all the London underground characters are third-class, basically."
00:13:56,00:13:57,Are they?
00:13:57,00:13:58,Would you say that?
00:13:58,00:13:59,I suppose that might be true.
00:13:59,00:14:00,"Yeah, it's a bit of a stretch."
00:14:00,00:14:02,They definitely got rid of first-class on the lines where they had it.
00:14:02,00:14:04,Do we know if they had any luxuries?
00:14:04,00:14:05,"Yeah, you did."
00:14:05,00:14:09,You had two gas lamps instead of one.
00:14:09,00:14:10,Damn!
00:14:10,00:14:13,It's a bit like that from the other week
00:14:13,00:14:15,where you can have two castles in first class.
00:14:15,00:14:16,Yes.
00:14:16,00:14:18,(LAUGHTER)
00:14:18,00:14:19,Shoot me that scene.
00:14:19,00:14:21,We've probably gone enough on that.
00:14:21,00:14:24,I have one story about an underground man.
00:14:24,00:14:25,Sure.
00:14:25,00:14:26,"Sure, why not?"
00:14:26,00:14:28,So this is a story from 1998.
00:14:28,00:14:33,It's the report of a man who broke the record
00:14:33,00:14:36,for the length of time spent in a wooden box underground.
00:14:36,00:14:37,Okay.
00:14:37,00:14:39,What more than dead people?
00:14:39,00:14:40,No.
00:14:40,00:14:41,For the living people.
00:14:41,00:14:43,For the living people category.
00:14:43,00:14:44,He was called Jeff Smith.
00:14:44,00:14:45,He was 37 years old.
00:14:45,00:14:48,And he beat the European record of 101 days.
00:14:48,00:14:53,He stayed underground for 150 days.
00:14:53,00:14:58,And the record that he broke was set by his mother.
00:14:58,00:14:59,"Oh, my God."
00:14:59,00:15:01,How many days did she do?
00:15:01,00:15:03,She did 101.
00:15:03,00:15:04,And he beat her.
00:15:04,00:15:08,And then the landlord of the pub in the garden of which
00:15:08,00:15:11,he was buried underground for three months.
00:15:11,00:15:12,(LAUGHTER)
00:15:12,00:15:15,"Said, when his mother did it, he was seven years old."
00:15:15,00:15:16,He's now 37.
00:15:16,00:15:18,"And for the last 30 years, it's been his ambition"
00:15:18,00:15:20,to go and bury himself in a box.
00:15:20,00:15:21,(LAUGHTER)
00:15:21,00:15:24,Did he have some awful rivalry with his mother?
00:15:24,00:15:25,I don't know.
00:15:25,00:15:28,I think he was proud to keep the family record alive.
00:15:28,00:15:31,And how do they keep him alive?
00:15:31,00:15:34,He's obviously got air tubes.
00:15:34,00:15:37,They probably just pull peanuts down a tube
00:15:37,00:15:39,or something because he's in the pub.
00:15:39,00:15:40,What do you remember?
00:15:40,00:15:44,There was a book we have in the office
00:15:44,00:15:46,"from a friend of ours, John Bonderson,"
00:15:46,00:15:47,called Barry DeLive.
00:15:47,00:15:49,And they used to make caskets for people
00:15:49,00:15:51,who were petrified of being buried alive.
00:15:51,00:15:55,"So one, had an ability that you could ring a bell"
00:15:55,00:15:56,if you woke up in your casket.
00:15:56,00:15:59,"And while you were waiting for them to dig you out,"
00:15:59,00:16:01,it had a tube where they could send a sausage down.
00:16:01,00:16:04,(LAUGHTER)
00:16:04,00:16:06,"No, so he had an air tube."
00:16:06,00:16:09,"And he said, through the air tube inserted in the box,"
00:16:09,00:16:11,"""I am very pleased to have reached this day."
00:16:11,00:16:13,"My mother would be proud of me."""
00:16:13,00:16:16,"If you were in that beer garden and you had a few points,"
00:16:16,00:16:18,you would start pouring beer down his tube.
00:16:18,00:16:21,I think the beer would be the last of his worries.
00:16:21,00:16:22,Going down that tube.
00:16:22,00:16:24,That's a good point.
00:16:24,00:16:27,Well done for not drowning.
00:16:27,00:16:29,(LAUGHTER)
00:16:29,00:16:32,Imagine if you were one day away from getting the record
00:16:32,00:16:34,and then a massive Erbubble.
00:16:34,00:16:38,(LAUGHTER)
00:16:38,00:16:48,"Okay, it is time for fact number two."
00:16:48,00:16:50,And that is James.
00:16:50,00:16:52,"Okay, my fact this week is that every month,"
00:16:52,00:16:54,"the same number of people on average,"
00:16:54,00:16:58,Google how to make love as how to make slime.
00:16:58,00:16:59,Yeah.
00:16:59,00:17:01,I only know one of those things.
00:17:01,00:17:02,See which one?
00:17:02,00:17:03,Slime.
00:17:03,00:17:04,Yeah.
00:17:04,00:17:07,Sometimes they could be the same thing this month.
00:17:07,00:17:09,Let's try and know how to make slime.
00:17:09,00:17:13,"So this is an article on Mondovo.com,"
00:17:13,00:17:15,"which is a digital marketing company,"
00:17:15,00:17:19,where they look to the 1000 most asked questions on Google
00:17:19,00:17:23,and checked how much an advertiser would have to pay
00:17:23,00:17:25,for someone to click on their adverts for them.
00:17:25,00:17:27,"So if you look at the most Google question,"
00:17:27,00:17:29,"which is what is my IP,"
00:17:29,00:17:34,"an advertiser would be 0.12 dollars per click,"
00:17:34,00:17:36,"and when it's Valentine's Day,"
00:17:36,00:17:38,would be $12.33 per click.
00:17:38,00:17:40,So that's what they were looking at.
00:17:40,00:17:42,"But really, I just want to talk about slime."
00:17:42,00:17:47,"It is weird though that I didn't realise there's this slime craze at all,"
00:17:47,00:17:50,"and maybe that's because I'm not a young child or a parent,"
00:17:50,00:17:52,"but there is, and there are all these stories"
00:17:52,00:17:54,"in America of glue shortages,"
00:17:54,00:17:55,"which people are saying are rubbish,"
00:17:55,00:17:57,"but it is true that Wal-Mart's have had to say,"
00:17:57,00:17:59,"look, we have run out of glue in some of our stores,"
00:17:59,00:18:02,"and we are trying to keep up with demand as quickly as possible,"
00:18:02,00:18:05,because kids have just started making slime all over the place.
00:18:05,00:18:06,It's amazing.
00:18:06,00:18:09,"And there are Instagram accounts run by teenagers,"
00:18:09,00:18:11,"which have got hundreds of thousands of followers,"
00:18:11,00:18:14,and it's just them gloping slime and touching it
00:18:14,00:18:15,and making the glopinises with it.
00:18:15,00:18:17,"And there are all these different slime accounts,"
00:18:17,00:18:19,"and there are slime confession accounts,"
00:18:19,00:18:23,"which apparently post drama about other slime accounts saying,"
00:18:23,00:18:26,so-and-so didn't invent this new kind of angel slime
00:18:26,00:18:27,or crunchy slime or whatever.
00:18:27,00:18:29,"Wait, that doesn't sound like a confession."
00:18:29,00:18:31,That sounds like slime accusation.
00:18:31,00:18:32,"Yeah, I get."
00:18:32,00:18:33,What happens on the slime confessions?
00:18:33,00:18:35,I admit I didn't make that slime.
00:18:35,00:18:37,"Yeah, it's just the rebuttal."
00:18:37,00:18:38,"No, slime confession."
00:18:38,00:18:40,It's just sort of secondary accounts posted.
00:18:40,00:18:42,"And you get asked,"
00:18:42,00:18:44,"because people just put their fingers in the video,"
00:18:44,00:18:45,touching the slime.
00:18:45,00:18:48,"And they get hundreds of messages from people saying,"
00:18:48,00:18:50,"""Give us a face reveal,"" is what it's called."
00:18:50,00:18:51,"Oh, and show your face."
00:18:51,00:18:53,Do you ever get the face reveal?
00:18:53,00:18:55,"I think people are a bit wary of showing their face,"
00:18:55,00:18:56,especially because they're teenagers.
00:18:56,00:18:58,"They say, ""I don't want to show my face to 100,000 people."""
00:18:58,00:18:59,Just look at the slime.
00:18:59,00:19:00,Really?
00:19:00,00:19:03,That's almost what the majority of YouTubers are.
00:19:03,00:19:05,"I mean, that's the age where they are."
00:19:05,00:19:07,These guys are only about the slime down.
00:19:07,00:19:08,They're not there for the fame.
00:19:08,00:19:11,They're not there for the slime light.
00:19:11,00:19:14,Hell!
00:19:14,00:19:17,Oh dear.
00:19:17,00:19:18,Is it broken?
00:19:18,00:19:20,We've broken the podcast.
00:19:20,00:19:21,It's finally happened.
00:19:21,00:19:23,"Yes, incredible."
00:19:23,00:19:24,That is amazing.
00:19:24,00:19:25,"I didn't know about that, actually."
00:19:25,00:19:27,I haven't seen that in my Googling of slime.
00:19:27,00:19:33,"Yeah, for 2016, it was the top 10 how-to searches in the world"
00:19:33,00:19:35,"were made in America, but I think it was the world."
00:19:35,00:19:38,"How-to and all the others are, like, how to file my taxes"
00:19:38,00:19:40,"or how to, I don't know, whatever else."
00:19:40,00:19:41,And then it's how to make slime.
00:19:41,00:19:43,So they are also divided by regions.
00:19:43,00:19:46,So you can find out what people are Googling how to do in various places.
00:19:46,00:19:50,"So, Sheffield wanted to know mostly how to pluck your eyebrows."
00:19:50,00:19:53,People in Cardiff and Leeds wanted to know how to work out percentages.
00:19:53,00:19:58,"And in Bradford, the most common how-to search was how-to age lace."
00:19:58,00:20:03,"How-to age, that was the most common thing people wanted to know how to do."
00:20:03,00:20:04,In Bradford.
00:20:04,00:20:07,"In Bradford, they're all about lace in Bradford."
00:20:07,00:20:09,And ageing lace.
00:20:09,00:20:10,What is ageing lace?
00:20:10,00:20:13,I guess to make it look older than it is.
00:20:13,00:20:15,Or is it telling how old it is?
00:20:15,00:20:16,"Oh, yeah."
00:20:16,00:20:17,"Oh, yeah."
00:20:17,00:20:21,"That does feel to me like one or two people Googling a lot, doesn't it?"
00:20:21,00:20:22,Yeah.
00:20:22,00:20:23,Yeah.
00:20:23,00:20:25,I've forgotten again.
00:20:25,00:20:31,"It's interesting, because all this slime was very much part of,"
00:20:31,00:20:34,"I guess, more James and my childhood than YouTube."
00:20:34,00:20:38,"But the toys that we all had, or used to have them, Teenage Beauty Ninja Turtles,"
00:20:38,00:20:40,used to come with it because they were born out of ooze.
00:20:40,00:20:42,"So, used to get this little slime with it."
00:20:42,00:20:44,"The Ghostbusters toys, used to get..."
00:20:44,00:20:46,"Yeah, slimer."
00:20:46,00:20:47,"Yes, slimer exactly."
00:20:47,00:20:49,It was such a huge part of toys.
00:20:49,00:20:51,I don't know if it is so much these days.
00:20:51,00:20:52,That was gung vintage.
00:20:52,00:20:55,Like get your own back with Dave Benson Phillips.
00:20:55,00:20:56,"Oh, yeah."
00:20:56,00:20:57,It was always evolving out of being gunged.
00:20:57,00:20:58,Wasn't it more like putty?
00:20:58,00:21:01,"So, the slime I remember getting was more like putty with toys."
00:21:01,00:21:02,That's the farty one.
00:21:02,00:21:03,That's the one that you go.
00:21:03,00:21:05,When you put your finger inside.
00:21:05,00:21:06,I don't think I've got the slime.
00:21:06,00:21:07,That was the...
00:21:07,00:21:09,"Yeah, the slime was the predated..."
00:21:09,00:21:10,"The party, did it?"
00:21:10,00:21:11,The party putty.
00:21:11,00:21:12,"Yeah, okay."
00:21:12,00:21:15,"One theory about why kids like slime so much,"
00:21:15,00:21:18,"especially in the 90s and early 2000s,"
00:21:18,00:21:21,is because it was a time when kids stopped going outside.
00:21:21,00:21:25,"And when, you know, kids in the 60s and 70s would go out,"
00:21:25,00:21:28,"they'd be messing around with bits of gung and, you know,"
00:21:28,00:21:30,bits of mud and all that kind of thing.
00:21:30,00:21:32,And then this was a generation that didn't really play out.
00:21:32,00:21:34,"So, they were indoors a lot."
00:21:34,00:21:36,"So, they had to make do with gung."
00:21:36,00:21:37,That's amazing.
00:21:37,00:21:38,Yeah.
00:21:38,00:21:39,"Don't know if it's true, it's a theory."
00:21:39,00:21:40,It's a really good theory.
00:21:40,00:21:41,"Yeah, like it."
00:21:41,00:21:44,"The first film I could find that contains the word ""slime"" in the title"
00:21:44,00:21:48,"is a film called ""The Slime People"" from 1963."
00:21:48,00:21:49,It was not very well received.
00:21:49,00:21:51,It got 2.5 on IMDb.
00:21:51,00:21:53,"And apparently, according to Wikipedia,"
00:21:53,00:21:56,it was infamous for its extensive use of fog machines
00:21:56,00:21:58,with the fog becoming so thick towards the end
00:21:58,00:22:00,that it's virtually impossible to see anything out.
00:22:00,00:22:07,"It started this guy called Robert Hutton, who only got..."
00:22:07,00:22:09,Lots of the first half of the film started.
00:22:09,00:22:14,Robert Hutton apparently only got work.
00:22:14,00:22:17,This is going to this random book on films.
00:22:17,00:22:20,He only got work because he had a startling resemblance to Jimmy Stewart.
00:22:20,00:22:22,"And when Jimmy Stewart was called up for World War II,"
00:22:22,00:22:26,he was just casting lots of films that Jimmy Stewart was supposed to be in.
00:22:26,00:22:27,That's amazing.
00:22:27,00:22:28,That's really good.
00:22:28,00:22:29,That's really good.
00:22:29,00:22:31,Have you guys ever seen The Blob?
00:22:31,00:22:32,Yeah.
00:22:32,00:22:36,So The Blob is one of the first ever B-movie sci-fi horror films.
00:22:36,00:22:39,And it's one of Steve McQueen's first ever films as an actor.
00:22:39,00:22:40,I did not know he was in The Blob.
00:22:40,00:22:41,"Yeah, and it's about..."
00:22:41,00:22:44,"Basically, it's about a blob which comes down from space"
00:22:44,00:22:45,and it starts eating things
00:22:45,00:22:47,and it just absorbs things and then gets bigger.
00:22:47,00:22:49,So the producer has just died.
00:22:49,00:22:52,"It's kind of like a slime, basically, as The Blob."
00:22:52,00:22:54,"It's sort of this sentient ooze, which just..."
00:22:54,00:22:55,It's one of those things.
00:22:55,00:22:59,"Yeah. But these days, there is still blob fest every year"
00:22:59,00:23:00,in a town where they shot loads of it.
00:23:00,00:23:02,And you can eat blob burgers.
00:23:02,00:23:04,And you can pay a small fee.
00:23:04,00:23:06,And you can run screaming out of the cinema
00:23:06,00:23:08,that everyone runs screaming out of in the film
00:23:08,00:23:10,when the blob oozes into it.
00:23:10,00:23:12,What if you want to keep watching the film?
00:23:12,00:23:13,You can't.
00:23:13,00:23:16,Do you know that The Blob was based on a true story?
00:23:16,00:23:17,No.
00:23:17,00:23:18,"Okay, yeah."
00:23:18,00:23:19,"No, it really was."
00:23:19,00:23:21,Can I give you a dance move?
00:23:21,00:23:24,It was a local report somewhere in America.
00:23:24,00:23:27,Some weird substance had been found
00:23:27,00:23:30,"that was kind of jelly-like, probably natural, I guess."
00:23:30,00:23:32,"It probably is, like, frog sperm or something."
00:23:32,00:23:35,But the FBI were brought in to investigate it.
00:23:35,00:23:38,And then it was in the local news and then it got in national news
00:23:38,00:23:40,and then they turned it into the story.
00:23:40,00:23:41,I didn't know that.
00:23:41,00:23:42,That's very cool.
00:23:42,00:23:43,Did it eat people?
00:23:43,00:23:44,"No, no."
00:23:44,00:23:47,I think that was a fictional adaptation.
00:23:47,00:23:53,"So in Paris, in the 19th century, they used to have fruit orchards"
00:23:53,00:23:58,and they used to use snail slime to put branding on their apples.
00:23:58,00:23:59,No.
00:23:59,00:24:00,Yeah.
00:24:00,00:24:03,So what you would do is you'd grow an apple on a tree
00:24:03,00:24:04,and put it in a paper bag.
00:24:04,00:24:06,So it was very pale when it grew.
00:24:06,00:24:09,And then you take the paper bag off and you get a stencil
00:24:09,00:24:12,and you put snail slime in the stencil bit.
00:24:12,00:24:14,And then you would let it grow a little bit longer.
00:24:14,00:24:17,"And the rest of the apple would go a nice colour,"
00:24:17,00:24:19,but the bit where the snail slime was wouldn't go the colour
00:24:19,00:24:21,and so you could have little brands.
00:24:21,00:24:22,No way!
00:24:22,00:24:23,That is amazing.
00:24:23,00:24:24,That is so cool.
00:24:24,00:24:26,Why did we stop doing that?
00:24:26,00:24:27,I don't know.
00:24:27,00:24:28,We should bring it back.
00:24:28,00:24:29,We should bring it back.
00:24:29,00:24:32,We invented sticky labels and it's better than having an apple.
00:24:32,00:24:33,But it's snail slime.
00:24:33,00:24:37,We don't have to individually bag every apple on your tree.
00:24:37,00:24:39,That is why we didn't do it.
00:24:39,00:24:42,"I just think that is incredible, though."
00:24:42,00:24:46,"Snail slime is non-uternian fluid, which we've talked about before."
00:24:46,00:24:49,So it's a fluid that doesn't really act in the way you'd expect something like water to act.
00:24:49,00:24:53,"And the reason that's really good for snails is that when they excrete it,"
00:24:53,00:24:56,it helps them stick to the ground when they're staying still
00:24:56,00:24:57,and root them in the ground.
00:24:57,00:25:00,And then it helps them move when they want to move.
00:25:00,00:25:03,"Because under pressure, it becomes really lubricated and it becomes really slippery."
00:25:03,00:25:06,"Yeah, they use it like a hoverboard."
00:25:06,00:25:08,I was thinking like a water slide.
00:25:08,00:25:12,"Yeah, that's probably better actually."
00:25:12,00:25:14,"But you're not hovering, are they?"
00:25:14,00:25:16,"No, but they're not touching the earth."
00:25:16,00:25:18,But neither are you if you're in shoes.
00:25:18,00:25:20,These are my hover boots.
00:25:20,00:25:26,So loads of people have started using snail slime for beauty.
00:25:26,00:25:27,This is a big trend now.
00:25:27,00:25:32,So there have been some spars which have let snails crawl over your face for a fee.
00:25:32,00:25:34,You pay the fee not the snail.
00:25:34,00:25:39,"I read once at the battle of, I think it was a battle of Cressy."
00:25:39,00:25:43,They use snails to crawl over the wounds of people on the battlefield
00:25:43,00:25:45,because it has antibacterial stuff in it.
00:25:45,00:25:47,"No, what the enemy's getting closer."
00:25:47,00:25:48,"Come on, come on."
00:25:48,00:25:54,"Well, they have methods of getting slime out of snails now"
00:25:54,00:25:56,because they used to do it in quite a cruel way.
00:25:56,00:25:59,They used to put them in water which had lots of salt and vinegar in
00:25:59,00:26:02,and they freak out and they'd slime loads because it really hurt them.
00:26:02,00:26:07,"But now they've developed in Italian snail farms, a special steam bath."
00:26:07,00:26:10,It's like a spa for snails.
00:26:10,00:26:12,It's how they're pitching it.
00:26:12,00:26:14,I bet that's not how it really is for the snails.
00:26:14,00:26:16,"It is, they're in these domes which are full of steam."
00:26:16,00:26:19,"And apparently they take their shell off, put it in the locker."
00:26:19,00:26:24,Where do they keep the pound coin?
00:26:24,00:26:30,So it's quite nice that people in spars are using slime from snails
00:26:30,00:26:33,which of themselves been to a spa already.
00:26:33,00:26:35,That's so nice.
00:26:35,00:26:38,And then the people excrete sweat which they then give back to the snail
00:26:38,00:26:40,to pop on their faces.
00:26:40,00:26:49,"Okay, it is time for fact number three."
00:26:49,00:26:52,That is Chazinski.
00:26:52,00:26:55,My fact this week is that old faithful Giza and Yellowstone
00:26:55,00:26:57,used to be used as a washing machine.
00:26:57,00:27:02,And this is another true fact of mine this week.
00:27:02,00:27:07,"So old faithful is this Giza in Yellowstone National Park,"
00:27:07,00:27:10,which is very famous because it's quite reliable when it erupts.
00:27:10,00:27:12,So you can go and see it and I've seen it and it's amazing.
00:27:12,00:27:16,"And in the 1800s when people visited Yellowstone,"
00:27:16,00:27:19,"and it was often soldiers because there were a lot of soldiers placed in the area,"
00:27:19,00:27:26,then they would chuck their soil or their dirty clothes into the crater of the Giza.
00:27:26,00:27:28,And then it's very hot in there.
00:27:28,00:27:31,So it would get all the shummi around in there and then blast it out.
00:27:31,00:27:34,"And it's essentially, I think it's about 90 degrees."
00:27:34,00:27:36,And it erupts every 80 minutes.
00:27:36,00:27:39,So it's like putting your clothes on a 90 degree cycle for 80 minutes.
00:27:39,00:27:43,"Yeah, and that's not suitable for woolens as well."
00:27:43,00:27:46,90 degrees is too hot.
00:27:46,00:27:47,They did see.
00:27:47,00:27:50,All of the travellers said that you had to not put your woolen clothes in there
00:27:50,00:27:52,because they would actually get shredded up a little bit.
00:27:52,00:27:56,"Yeah, they were completely torn to shreds."
00:27:56,00:28:00,"Yes, because it stinks of raw sulfuric rotten eggs all over the shop."
00:28:00,00:28:05,And someone did acknowledge that it wasn't that good away at cleaning clothes.
00:28:05,00:28:10,"So there was one book I was reading about the history of Yellowstone said,"
00:28:10,00:28:13,many articles that go into her chambers never came out again.
00:28:13,00:28:17,"So Giza laundering was often seen as an enterprise, both futile and costly."
00:28:17,00:28:18,Wow.
00:28:18,00:28:21,"And they would, I mean, I've been the seat to see that as well."
00:28:21,00:28:23,"But really, an explosion, isn't it?"
00:28:23,00:28:25,So they would have gone flying.
00:28:25,00:28:26,Yeah.
00:28:26,00:28:28,"I would do it, definitely, but with some old t-shirts and things like that."
00:28:28,00:28:29,"Well, you shouldn't do it."
00:28:29,00:28:30,It's very clear.
00:28:30,00:28:32,You shouldn't put things in the Giza's in Yellowstone.
00:28:32,00:28:33,Really?
00:28:33,00:28:34,"They make it very, very clear."
00:28:34,00:28:35,I've never been.
00:28:35,00:28:36,So I think I'm clear.
00:28:36,00:28:37,I think I'm allowed to do it.
00:28:37,00:28:38,No one's told me not to yet.
00:28:38,00:28:41,"But when you go, because you have to stay on the wattboards, don't you?"
00:28:41,00:28:42,Yeah.
00:28:42,00:28:48,And then you'll see just like a hat here and a shoe here that have just either blown over or...
00:28:48,00:28:49,"Oh, really?"
00:28:49,00:28:52,"Are there people trying to emulate this, though?"
00:28:52,00:28:53,I don't think so.
00:28:53,00:28:54,"Oh, is it left over?"
00:28:54,00:28:56,Because stuff used to get sucked down and disappear.
00:28:56,00:28:59,So it might be 150-year-old shoes left over from these socks.
00:28:59,00:29:00,It might be.
00:29:00,00:29:03,They mostly look like baseball caps from the current era.
00:29:03,00:29:04,Okay.
00:29:04,00:29:06,This is an amazing fact.
00:29:06,00:29:07,It's incredible.
00:29:07,00:29:11,You could wash the dishes by dropping them into like Mount Etner or something.
00:29:11,00:29:14,And it'll shimmy them around and then explain them out.
00:29:14,00:29:16,"Well, they try to wash dishes in Giza's as well."
00:29:16,00:29:17,Do they?
00:29:17,00:29:18,Everything with them.
00:29:18,00:29:19,It's truly bizarre.
00:29:19,00:29:23,Surely you would know that they would smash on being blasted out.
00:29:23,00:29:27,"Well, for instance, you would get some Giza's which are just like a puddle of water,"
00:29:27,00:29:29,which it's just kind of bubbling.
00:29:29,00:29:31,Wouldn't necessarily be firing out massive amounts.
00:29:31,00:29:32,Okay.
00:29:32,00:29:34,"Yeah, was it specifically old faithful?"
00:29:34,00:29:36,"No, lots of Giza's, they did this in."
00:29:36,00:29:38,"So there was one Giza that was called the handkerchief Giza,"
00:29:38,00:29:40,because you'd chuck your handkerchiefs in.
00:29:40,00:29:41,Right.
00:29:41,00:29:44,"And people used to chuck in soap just to make them explode, I think."
00:29:44,00:29:45,Did they?
00:29:45,00:29:47,I think that would prompt them to explode.
00:29:47,00:29:48,"Yes, it does."
00:29:48,00:29:51,It gets between the molecules in some way and court actually causes Giza's to explode.
00:29:51,00:29:52,It's mad.
00:29:52,00:29:53,That's amazing.
00:29:53,00:29:54,Yeah.
00:29:54,00:29:55,It's really odd.
00:29:55,00:29:58,I was reading about the fact that they have discovered that Yellowstone.
00:29:58,00:29:59,This is quite a while ago.
00:29:59,00:30:02,Yellowstone is actually what is classified as a super volcano.
00:30:02,00:30:06,Because the whole thing effectively is one massive volcano.
00:30:06,00:30:11,"It's very scary because the last time it went off, it produced so much ash"
00:30:11,00:30:18,"that you could have covered New York State in, I think it was 20 meters of ash."
00:30:18,00:30:22,"And I'm not sure if they've actually verified this, but I think this is the main theory."
00:30:22,00:30:24,There's the Gallatin Mountains.
00:30:24,00:30:30,And suddenly in between the mountain range is a 60 mile to 70 mile gap of mountain.
00:30:30,00:30:31,It's just missing.
00:30:31,00:30:32,It's not there.
00:30:32,00:30:34,And they think it was from the explosion.
00:30:34,00:30:35,Wow.
00:30:35,00:30:37,It just wiped out 60 miles of mountain range.
00:30:37,00:30:40,So do you reckon that mountain kind of flew up somewhere and landed somewhere else?
00:30:40,00:30:41,Yes.
00:30:41,00:30:47,Do you know what happens when lava explodes out of a volcano?
00:30:47,00:30:48,If a die.
00:30:48,00:30:53,Does it go up and then cool down and then fall down like promise kind of stuff or?
00:30:53,00:30:59,"Kind of, but some of it, a third of the liquid rock, falls back into the volcano."
00:30:59,00:31:03,It just goes in just straight up and back down again.
00:31:03,00:31:04,Wow.
00:31:04,00:31:07,Can I just read you really quickly one last anecdote?
00:31:07,00:31:11,Obviously the only research I did for this was people putting stuff in geysers for fun.
00:31:11,00:31:12,Yeah.
00:31:12,00:31:14,"So just one last anecdote, which I really enjoyed."
00:31:14,00:31:17,"And this was from a guy called Norton, who was a travel writer."
00:31:17,00:31:20,He was one of the first people to write about visiting Yellowstone National Park.
00:31:20,00:31:26,"And he went with Rich Companion, who he nicknamed Prince Telegraph, because he owned all these Telegraph lines."
00:31:26,00:31:28,And he was obviously some posh tof.
00:31:28,00:31:34,And so Norton recorded that Prince Telegraph couldn't be bothered to wash up the crockery on the day that it was his turn.
00:31:34,00:31:42,So he dumped it in a small shallow looking geyser and smoked a pipe by the side of the geyser in the hope that it would wash the crockery.
00:31:42,00:31:46,And the geyser suddenly started spitting and like whirling all the contents of the crockery around.
00:31:46,00:31:50,"And they, so the rest of the group hadn't realised that Prince Telegraph had done this."
00:31:50,00:31:52,They just heard this shout from him.
00:31:52,00:31:54,And they turned around and saw him.
00:31:54,00:31:56,He was making an agonizing cry for help.
00:31:56,00:32:02,"They beheld him with his hat off an eyes peeled, dancing around his dishpan and a frantic attempt to save the culinary outfit."
00:32:02,00:32:09,"He would plunge his hand into the boiling water, yell with pain and out would come a spoon, another plunge and yell and a tin plate."
00:32:09,00:32:13,And apparently he just kept on throwing his head down into this water and scrambling around.
00:32:13,00:32:15,And all their crockery got sucked into the geyser.
00:32:15,00:32:16,You've got to let it go mate.
00:32:16,00:32:17,Yeah.
00:32:17,00:32:19,I would say a spoon is not worth it for losing your hands.
00:32:19,00:32:24,"Also, if it was a porcelain plate, maybe, but a tin plate, you're going from hot to hot to hot."
00:32:24,00:32:25,"Oh, yeah."
00:32:25,00:32:27,"Yeah, but he's taken all their crockery."
00:32:27,00:32:30,What if they're stuck in Yellowstone without anything to eat off?
00:32:30,00:32:31,Yeah.
00:32:31,00:32:33,I guess they'll have to have finger food from then on.
00:32:33,00:32:38,And it does have a trout jacuzzi.
00:32:38,00:32:41,Is this like your sauna for snails?
00:32:41,00:32:42,Yeah.
00:32:42,00:32:47,And the is starting up a whole spa for different animals on you.
00:32:47,00:32:50,You've got the weight room for a camel.
00:32:50,00:32:53,Does it have different settings?
00:32:53,00:32:56,"Like, can they turn on the bubble?"
00:32:56,00:32:59,What it is is that sometimes there are little eruptions.
00:32:59,00:33:06,"In this trout jacuzzi, which stir up lots of crustaceans and other little insects that trout like to eat."
00:33:06,00:33:11,And so the trout know that this is happening and they swim around whenever there's a little upburst of liquid.
00:33:11,00:33:13,So it's like having a jacuzzi.
00:33:13,00:33:14,"Well, like sausages."
00:33:14,00:33:19,Which would be the best jacuzzi in the world ever.
00:33:25,00:33:30,"OK, it is time for our final fact of the show and that is Andy."
00:33:30,00:33:37,"My fact is that there are three world's largest porch swings in Nebraska, Louisiana and Ontario."
00:33:37,00:33:40,And none of them is on a porch.
00:33:40,00:33:46,This is the fact that it was sent in actually sent in by a guy called Jeremy Michael Voss on Twitter.
00:33:46,00:33:50,"And there are lots of porch swings, which are supposed to be the world's largest."
00:33:50,00:33:53,And you can see them all and they're nowhere near a porch.
00:33:53,00:33:54,Surely we've measured them.
00:33:54,00:33:56,"Yeah, I was going to say the same."
00:33:56,00:33:59,"Surely we know from all those pictures, which is the biggest."
00:33:59,00:34:02,"Not quite, but they're sort of all similar size."
00:34:02,00:34:04,They're all identical inside.
00:34:04,00:34:06,Very weird that someone wouldn't...
00:34:06,00:34:12,"It could be that one's the tallest, one's the widest and one's the whatever, the other..."
00:34:12,00:34:19,"Could be that no one could be asked to measure them, because they're just big porch swings."
00:34:19,00:34:21,Professional measures are better things to do.
00:34:21,00:34:25,"I don't actually know which of them is the largest, but there are all these sort of world's largest things all over the place."
00:34:25,00:34:28,And there are lots of conflicts between people aren't there.
00:34:28,00:34:29,So how large are they?
00:34:29,00:34:31,And I don't mean the exact measurements.
00:34:31,00:34:36,"I mean, if I was sitting on one, is it like when you go to those places where they have big chairs and big tables and you're meant to look like a..."
00:34:36,00:34:38,Which places are these then?
00:34:38,00:34:42,You can go to places that make you feel like one of the borrowers where they have just giant furniture.
00:34:42,00:34:43,Can you?
00:34:43,00:34:44,Yeah.
00:34:44,00:34:47,"Dan is looking at me, like there's one of these places on every corner."
00:34:47,00:34:50,It's weird that I've never been to one.
00:34:50,00:34:51,So what do you mean?
00:34:51,00:34:56,The world's largest chair is a really epic battle between lots of different places.
00:34:56,00:34:59,It started in 1905.
00:34:59,00:35:01,I strapped yourselves in.
00:35:01,00:35:03,This is kind of a long anecdote.
00:35:03,00:35:08,"So it started in 1905 and Gardner, Massachusetts erected a 12 foot tall chair."
00:35:08,00:35:14,And then a place called Thomasville North Carolina made one that was 13 feet six inches.
00:35:14,00:35:18,And then those two places just got more and more bigger and bigger chairs.
00:35:18,00:35:22,Eventually there was an 18 foot chair in Thomasville.
00:35:22,00:35:25,But then the war happened.
00:35:25,00:35:31,"And then after the war, there were various largest chairs in Bennington, Vermont, Washington, D.C.,"
00:35:31,00:35:37,"Boris Town, Tennessee, Binghampton, New York, Wingdale, New York, Aniston, Alabama."
00:35:37,00:35:43,"Aniston, Alabama had the biggest chair until 2001 when it was destroyed by a storm."
00:35:43,00:35:47,So all these other towns in America had all the biggest chair at various times.
00:35:47,00:35:50,But now the world's biggest chair is in Italy.
00:35:50,00:35:52,And it's 65 feet tall.
00:35:52,00:35:53,65 feet.
00:35:53,00:35:54,Wow.
00:35:54,00:35:59,And it could be even bigger if it wasn't for that dastardly war that interrupted them.
00:35:59,00:36:04,That's the most that anyone's ever glossed over the second world war.
00:36:04,00:36:09,He was telling the biggest story.
00:36:09,00:36:12,Is that the one that's in Italy?
00:36:12,00:36:14,Is that a place called Manzano?
00:36:14,00:36:15,"Yes, that's right."
00:36:15,00:36:18,"There's a fact about it, which is, I can't believe this."
00:36:18,00:36:21,Is that a third of the world's chairs are manufactured there.
00:36:21,00:36:26,"They might do, though, because some, like in China, where there's Sock City and there's, like,"
00:36:26,00:36:30,there's some villages and towns that just decide that's what we do.
00:36:30,00:36:32,Everything here is chair-based or Sock City.
00:36:32,00:36:35,"Yeah, but if you think about how many chairs there must be in the world,"
00:36:35,00:36:38,"everyone in the world on average is going to welcome at least a chair, aren't they?"
00:36:38,00:36:44,"Yeah, but I think like how many chairs are you sitting on right now?"
00:36:44,00:36:45,What?
00:36:45,00:36:46,"What, yeah?"
00:36:46,00:36:47,How many socks are you wearing?
00:36:47,00:36:49,"Well, yeah, I do see your point."
00:36:49,00:36:50,Yeah.
00:36:50,00:36:55,"But there are, is it three?"
00:36:55,00:36:57,"No, I do see that point."
00:36:57,00:37:01,"But like around this table, there's more than what two chairs per person."
00:37:01,00:37:02,"Yeah, that's true."
00:37:02,00:37:06,"And also, there's too much variety in chairs for them all to be coming from the same factory"
00:37:06,00:37:07,"or a Sock sort of the same, aren't they?"
00:37:07,00:37:09,"Yeah, I don't think it can be."
00:37:09,00:37:11,Socks aren't all the same.
00:37:11,00:37:15,"I mean, not even the two that I'm wearing at the same time."
00:37:15,00:37:18,So there is a thing in America.
00:37:18,00:37:22,A lot of these are roadside attractions where they would try and get people into your town or whatever.
00:37:22,00:37:25,So there are a few world largest balls of twine.
00:37:25,00:37:26,"Oh, yeah."
00:37:26,00:37:27,There's a huge thing.
00:37:27,00:37:30,"On Wikipedia, there's one entry about the world largest ball of twine."
00:37:30,00:37:31,And this is what it says.
00:37:31,00:37:36,"It says, ""The world's largest ball of twine in Corker City was built as a response to the"
00:37:36,00:37:40,Minnesota town of Darwin's efforts to grab the title.
00:37:40,00:37:43,"That reads very much like someone from Corker City."""
00:37:43,00:37:45,And it's unhappy with Darwin.
00:37:45,00:37:47,And they're usually the ball of twine.
00:37:47,00:37:49,"Is it usually just one person really, isn't it?"
00:37:49,00:37:54,It's kind of just like over years and years and years just making these balls of twine.
00:37:54,00:37:55,It thinks so.
00:37:55,00:37:56,Weirdly pointless.
00:37:56,00:37:58,"What a great life, that would be."
00:37:58,00:38:00,"Everything we do is a little bit pointless, isn't it?"
00:38:00,00:38:01,I think this is a little pointless.
00:38:01,00:38:03,"We're all going to die in the end, aren't they?"
00:38:03,00:38:08,"I know, but I'm not sure I want to continue doing this on campus."
00:38:08,00:38:10,But this is always the thing.
00:38:10,00:38:13,"The thing I find very odd with a lot of these, like the world's largest chair."
00:38:13,00:38:14,It's not a chair.
00:38:14,00:38:16,It's a model of a chair.
00:38:16,00:38:17,"No, but it's still a chair."
00:38:17,00:38:18,You can sit on it.
00:38:18,00:38:19,Yeah.
00:38:19,00:38:21,"What about the world's largest banana, which is a model of a banana?"
00:38:21,00:38:23,"No, no, because that the world's largest banana."
00:38:23,00:38:27,"No, no, no, that's different because you'd have to make the inside of a banana out of banana."
00:38:27,00:38:28,I see.
00:38:28,00:38:30,I think I see the distinction you're drawing and I think it's fair.
00:38:30,00:38:31,Thank you.
00:38:31,00:38:32,"Oh, I was coming around to you all the way."
00:38:32,00:38:33,"No, no."
00:38:33,00:38:35,"So this guy's made the world's largest knitting needles, he claims."
00:38:35,00:38:38,They're 13 feet long and I actually don't think they are knitting needles.
00:38:38,00:38:40,"Wait, but what disqualify, what disqualify is it?"
00:38:40,00:38:42,Because you can't knit with them.
00:38:42,00:38:44,I don't either use of the thing for the thing.
00:38:44,00:38:46,I bet he has done some knitting with it.
00:38:46,00:38:48,The world's largest judgment.
00:38:48,00:38:49,"Yeah, the world's largest."
00:38:49,00:38:54,"In the knitting needle one, I often see these things because we spend a lot of time on the internet."
00:38:54,00:38:59,But I have often seen world's most largest functional knitting needle as a actual record.
00:38:59,00:39:00,Right.
00:39:00,00:39:01,That's interesting.
00:39:01,00:39:02,Okay.
00:39:02,00:39:03,Now I'm intrigued.
00:39:03,00:39:07,It's so weird how niche our knowledge is that I mentioned the world's largest knitting needle.
00:39:07,00:39:13,James is often covered across the world's largest functional line.
00:39:13,00:39:16,What are our lives?
00:39:16,00:39:18,They're just pointless.
00:39:18,00:39:19,Escapedes to the death.
00:39:19,00:39:20,We've reached.
00:39:20,00:39:21,We've reached.
00:39:21,00:39:27,Marching towards oblivion with our giant missing needle.
00:39:27,00:39:29,Australia has a load of these things.
00:39:29,00:39:32,There's an incredible Wikipedia page about the big things of Australia.
00:39:32,00:39:33,Okay.
00:39:33,00:39:34,It's what they're called.
00:39:34,00:39:37,And they're about 150.
00:39:37,00:39:40,"What's the famous as a big pineapple, I think?"
00:39:40,00:39:42,"Yeah, they've got the world's largest artificial prawn."
00:39:42,00:39:46,"World's largest artificial trout, artificial banana, artificial eagle."
00:39:46,00:39:47,That's weird.
00:39:47,00:39:51,I thought I'd been to the world's largest artificial prawn.
00:39:51,00:39:52,But it wasn't.
00:39:52,00:39:53,I've never been to Australia.
00:39:53,00:39:54,It was.
00:39:54,00:39:55,I thought it was in.
00:39:55,00:39:56,Maybe it's a touring prawn.
00:39:56,00:40:00,"It's pretty big, James."
00:40:00,00:40:05,"It could probably have made it, of course, in the time since you've seen it."
00:40:05,00:40:08,"I thought it was imploring the keys, but I'm."
00:40:08,00:40:11,And they're the coast.
00:40:11,00:40:12,I think about it.
00:40:12,00:40:14,It might have been a crayfish.
00:40:14,00:40:15,It's so embarrassing.
00:40:15,00:40:17,There's one of these things done.
00:40:17,00:40:18,There's one thing.
00:40:18,00:40:20,"It's called the big A is rock, right?"
00:40:20,00:40:23,And it's a one to 40 scale model of A is rock.
00:40:23,00:40:24,Which way is the scale?
00:40:24,00:40:25,It's smaller.
00:40:25,00:40:26,"Oh, right."
00:40:26,00:40:35,"So Wikipedia points out it's technically not a big thing, as it is substantially smaller than the idea that it's modeled on."
00:40:35,00:40:37,Can I bring it back to swings quickly?
00:40:37,00:40:38,Yeah.
00:40:38,00:40:46,"It was a very big year last year for the swing 2016, because the swing was inducted into the toy Hall of Fame."
00:40:46,00:40:47,"Oh, awesome."
00:40:47,00:40:48,Yeah.
00:40:48,00:40:49,They inducted a few things in one go.
00:40:49,00:40:52,"So the little peoples, I don't know if you know that."
00:40:52,00:40:53,It's a type of toy.
00:40:53,00:40:55,It's made by Fisher Price.
00:40:55,00:40:59,That was inducted Dungeons and Dragons was inducted.
00:40:59,00:41:06,"The little people, they've tied for the most nominations because there's a big final round and then they pick three."
00:41:06,00:41:12,So the magic eight ball ties with the little people for the most nominations of something that's not made it into the ball.
00:41:12,00:41:14,So the magic eight ball is still isn't in there.
00:41:14,00:41:15,Still not in there.
00:41:15,00:41:16,Yeah.
00:41:16,00:41:20,"And then when you shake it, it goes not looking good."
00:41:20,00:41:22,So the swing was up against this year.
00:41:22,00:41:25,This is who it had to beat to get into the Hall of Fame.
00:41:25,00:41:28,"It was up against Uno, the car game."
00:41:28,00:41:29,"Oh, yeah."
00:41:29,00:41:31,It was up against Care Bears.
00:41:31,00:41:36,It was up against Rockham Sockham Robots.
00:41:36,00:41:37,I don't know if you remember that.
00:41:37,00:41:38,Transformers.
00:41:38,00:41:39,Coloring books.
00:41:39,00:41:41,"Oh, they're an adult thing really these days."
00:41:41,00:41:42,"Yeah, that might have disqualified it."
00:41:42,00:41:43,And bubble wrap.
00:41:43,00:41:46,So it managed to defeat bubble wrap.
00:41:46,00:41:49,"Bubble wrap is not a tie, I wouldn't say."
00:41:49,00:41:50,"Well, it's in the past."
00:41:50,00:41:53,"They have put the stick into the toy Hall of Fame, haven't they?"
00:41:53,00:41:54,Yes.
00:41:54,00:41:57,"No, that was the, that got awarded the oldest toy."
00:41:57,00:41:59,All the lifetime achievement award.
00:41:59,00:42:01,"It was something like that, yeah."
00:42:01,00:42:04,"But yeah, so the swing has finally made it in."
00:42:04,00:42:06,Have you guys heard of Keaking?
00:42:06,00:42:07,What is Keaking?
00:42:07,00:42:09,It's competitive swinging in Estonia.
00:42:09,00:42:10,And it's a really big deal.
00:42:10,00:42:12,And it's the coolest thing ever.
00:42:12,00:42:13,I could barely watch it.
00:42:13,00:42:16,"So it's swinging, but all the way over."
00:42:16,00:42:18,"But the solid swings, aren't they?"
00:42:18,00:42:19,"They're solid, yeah."
00:42:19,00:42:20,So they're on poles.
00:42:20,00:42:24,But the challenge is to have as long a pole as possible on your swing.
00:42:24,00:42:27,"So the, the, instead of rope coming down,"
00:42:27,00:42:30,they're like big knitting needles.
00:42:30,00:42:32,I understand now.
00:42:32,00:42:34,"But it's terrifying, right?"
00:42:34,00:42:37,"Because as you swing up, that your feet are strapped onto the swing."
00:42:37,00:42:41,"But as you swing up to the point where you're almost going over the top,"
00:42:41,00:42:45,"you just, as you can imagine, you hang upside down there just before you fall back."
00:42:45,00:42:47,"Oh, yes, those, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:42:47,00:42:48,And they're ridiculously high.
00:42:48,00:42:53,"So the, the world record at the moment is a sort of knitting needle of 7.03 meters."
00:42:53,00:42:59,"So that means that you'll be hanging upside down 14 meters high, which is about five stories high."
00:42:59,00:43:00,Yeah.
00:43:00,00:43:03,"That is, you can almost get up to the world's tallest chair from up there."
00:43:03,00:43:04,Yes.
00:43:04,00:43:10,"So there's some orangutans in the Netherlands in the Uwenhans,"
00:43:10,00:43:14,"Deer and Park Rinan, which have obviously pronounced wrong, which is a zoo."
00:43:14,00:43:17,And they've forgotten how to swing in trees.
00:43:17,00:43:20,"Because they're, they just didn't have any trees in where they're living."
00:43:20,00:43:22,So they've forgotten how to do it.
00:43:22,00:43:24,But then they got them some trees.
00:43:24,00:43:26,"And they were like, great, we got some trees."
00:43:26,00:43:29,But now the orangutans didn't know how to swing in them.
00:43:29,00:43:35,So they hired an Olympic gymnast to swing in the trees.
00:43:35,00:43:38,And to try and like show them what to do.
00:43:38,00:43:39,That is incredible.
00:43:39,00:43:42,The idea is to encourage them into doing that.
00:43:42,00:43:45,"It's not exercise. Like, why do they want them to do it?"
00:43:45,00:43:47,"Well, yeah, because that's what orangutans do."
00:43:47,00:43:49,"And what you want from a zoo, isn't it?"
00:43:49,00:43:51,"When you see an orangutan, you want it to be swinging."
00:43:51,00:43:52,Or trees.
00:43:52,00:43:54,Does this woman dress up?
00:43:54,00:43:55,Is it a woman or a man?
00:43:55,00:43:56,It was a guy.
00:43:56,00:43:58,Does he dress up as an orangutan?
00:43:58,00:44:00,I don't think he does now.
00:44:00,00:44:02,"But you, that would make sense, wouldn't it?"
00:44:02,00:44:07,"I really hope they come back in a few months and the orangutans are all landing, you know, perfectly in the nose."
00:44:07,00:44:17,"Okay, that is it. That is all of our facts."
00:44:17,00:44:19,Thank you so much for listening.
