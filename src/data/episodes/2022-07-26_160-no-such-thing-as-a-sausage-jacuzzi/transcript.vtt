00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.280
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.560
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.660
 My name is Dan Schreiber, and I am sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray,

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.720
 and Anna Chazinsky, and once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:39.080
 four favorite facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:44.540
 Starting this week with my fact, my fact this week is that at rush hour, there are more

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.660
 people under the ground in London than there are above the ground in Edinburgh.

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.660
 Wow, that's great.

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:52.660
 No.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:53.660
 And you don't mean dead people do you?

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:54.660
 No, I don't.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.120
 I mean, rush hour, I mean the London Underground system.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.180
 There are more people on trains below the ground than there are people in total every day.

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.580
 Actually, you might have underestimated that because did you count people living in basement

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.580
 flats?

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.080
 No, I didn't.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.080
 You didn't.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.080
 I bet there are even more people.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.120
 What about dead people?

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.120
 That's cold.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.120
 We can't go there.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.500
 Actually, you know you just said dead people, and vaguely about population.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.220
 I found out this week that the thing about there, this is probably something everyone else

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.220
 knows.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.320
 But the thing about there being more people alive today than had ever lived in the past is

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.320
 so far wrong.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.320
 It's ridiculously wrong.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.320
 So, you know you always hear that fact, and I think there's something like about 100 billion

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.860
 people have been alive on earth, and obviously there isn't nearly that many people alive today,

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:45.860
 and so it's just rubbish.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:46.860
 Okay.

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:47.860
 And let's come from.

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:48.860
 Wow.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:49.860
 Anyway, sorry about to you.

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.760
 Busted a myth right at the top of the show.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:52.760
 That's exciting.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:53.760
 Is this people on the London Underground?

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:54.760
 Yep.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:55.760
 This is people on the London Underground.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.960
 I read this fact in a Bill Bryson book called The Road to Little Dribbling.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.800
 It was his last tour of the UK.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.760
 It was a follow-up to notes from a small island, and in it he's on the London Underground.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.320
 He got the fact from Time Out, which is a magazine in London, and in it it said that daily

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:16.960
 there were 600,000 people on the London Underground, and the population of Edinburgh is something

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:17.960
 like 460,000.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.440
 Isn't it at any given moment on the Underground?

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.840
 Well, we thought that, and that's when I sent you guys that fact, but then I took it to

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.560
 our calculations master, James, and said, "Is that possible?"

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.680
 And James worked out that that can't be right, but you said that it would be right for rush

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:32.680
 hour.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:33.680
 Yeah.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.640
 I think the maximum that you might get at rush hour would be about 600,000.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.400
 And do we think the population of Edinburgh is around 500,000?

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.400
 Something like that?

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.400
 Yeah, just under, yeah.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:49.200
 I looked at some other 600,000s at the moment, and Ed Sheeran's shape of you just passed

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:57.880
 around 600,000 downloads quite recently, but it's also been streamed 121 million times since

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:58.880
 it was released.

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:59.880
 No way.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:00.880
 Yeah.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.920
 And it's three minutes, 50 something long.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:10.120
 And so if you add up all of those streamings together, it takes you to 893 years that people

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.360
 have been listening to that song.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:18.640
 And so if you go into the future 893 years, then that's 100 years after Wally is set.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:19.640
 Oh.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.320
 And it's the time when scientists decimate that the radiation levels in Chernobyl will be

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.360
 back down to normal.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.160
 That long for Chernobyl to be back?

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.160
 Well done, Ed Sheeran.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.160
 Wow.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.160
 What did I say?

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.160
 Thanks for clearing up Chernobyl.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.160
 Yeah.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.160
 I've understood.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.160
 Yeah.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:40.920
 But I mean, if we go by what happens in Wally, it doesn't look like a place to inhabit anymore.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.880
 But it's 100 years after Wally, so maybe.

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:44.880
 It's sorted itself out.

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:45.880
 Sorted itself out.

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:46.880
 Got back down.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.720
 That's the sequel.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.600
 I've got a quibble with your fact, Dan.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:51.600
 Uh-oh.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.600
 Sure.

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.120
 Half London Underground is overground.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.120
 Oh, yes.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.640
 So I'm just full stalling people right again, say.

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:58.640
 Oh.

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:59.640
 I know.

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:00.640
 Really half of it is.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:01.640
 More than half, I think.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.640
 More than half.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:02.640
 Yeah.

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:03.640
 God, how did we not think of that?

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:04.640
 Didn't think of that, bit.

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:05.640
 Yeah.

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:06.640
 Wow.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:07.640
 Oh, sorry.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.600
 I've been keeping that under my hat as a sort of cool thing to bring up, which wouldn't

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.760
 necessarily invalidate the whole section.

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:13.760
 But let's face it.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.240
 The rush hour, no one's in those weird out-of-bit things.

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:17.240
 Yeah, exactly.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:18.760
 The weird out-of-the-car.

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.720
 The tube does go.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:23.720
 It goes much further.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.280
 I got offered a stand-up gig ages ago, and it was in Zone 9, which I didn't know existed.

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.520
 But I was like, sure, I can see it on the map.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.720
 It took something like two hours to get there.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:33.720
 Yeah.

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:39.280
 And when we emerged from the train, because you, as you say, some of it goes overground,

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.840
 we emerged, and there were cows in my window.

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.840
 There was literally a field with sheep and cows.

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.040
 You can see that on the tube.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.640
 It used to go even further.

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:50.880
 Sorry, you had a joke.

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.920
 I was just going to say this sounds like a really hot gig you were at.

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.920
 [LAUGHTER]

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:02.160
 It was 1,000-seater barns somewhere.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.440
 You couldn't hear all the booze because of all the moose.

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.640
 [LAUGHTER]

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.120
 No, it used to go even further than that, though.

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.800
 It used to-- the metropolitan line, which I think is the one that goes up to Zone 9.

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.600
 So most stations don't have Zone 9.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.680
 Metropolitan line used to go 40 miles out of London.

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:18.480
 Wow.

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:19.720
 It used to go all the way to Ellsbury.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.400
 We should say, for overseas people, Covent Garden, where we work, is in Zone 1.

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.920
 And then if you get a bit further out of London, North London, like--

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.640
 You get to Zone 2, Zone 2.

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.000
 And then what comes after that, Dad?

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.960
 So, interestingly, if you go to where I live, it's Zone 3.

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.600
 And is that further out or closer in than Zone 2?

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.680
 And that's just-- that's one further out.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:39.200
 OK.

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.040
 Yeah, but two further out than Zone 1.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.880
 So, yeah, it's-- and then it works its way out to Zone 9.

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:45.400
 Wow.

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:46.160
 Yeah, it's great.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.200
 There's quite a few in between that, but we don't have time.

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:49.200
 [LAUGHTER]

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.960
 And they're one of the ones in between.

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.320
 So you go four, five.

00:05:54.320 --> 00:06:01.280
 If you go out to one of the far zones, so this will be a number higher than four and five even,

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:08.240
 you can get to the station Roding Valley, which is the least used station on the entire underground.

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:13.880
 And they have about 712 passengers a day, OK.

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:19.280
 And it's not as many as Edinburgh, but it is the same population as Elmington, the highest

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:20.280
 village in Warwickshire.

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:21.280
 It is.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.960
 Exactly the same population.

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:25.880
 According to the 2011 census.

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:29.720
 So, how are they getting from Elmington to Roding Valley?

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:30.720
 I see what you mean.

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.080
 It's not the same people.

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.080
 Ah, that was confusing.

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:40.080
 And one person who does live in Elmington is Les Wexner, who's the man behind Victoria's

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.080
 secret.

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:42.080
 Wow.

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.080
 Oh.

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.320
 Not Victoria, the train station in London, though.

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:47.320
 [LAUGHTER]

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:48.320
 No.

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:49.320
 Right.

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:50.320
 What is Victoria's secret?

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:53.320
 Well, it's actually 65 metres underground.

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:54.320
 [LAUGHTER]

00:06:54.320 --> 00:07:00.560
 Did you know that over 47 million litres of water pumped out of the underground every day?

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:01.560
 Oh, yeah.

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:02.560
 Oh, yeah.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:03.560
 Yeah, because it's that far down.

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.400
 So, lots of water, lots of water in the ground, and it keeps on pouring in.

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:07.400
 They keep on pumping it out.

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.600
 Why did they pump it out, too?

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:10.600
 Zoned 10.

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:11.600
 [LAUGHTER]

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:12.600
 I don't know.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.600
 Um, that's really cool.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.600
 So, it's pouring in.

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:17.600
 You never see it, do you?

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:18.600
 No.

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:21.600
 They do quite a good job of keeping it away from the public sections.

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:22.600
 Yeah.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:23.600
 Yeah.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:24.600
 Yeah.

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:25.600
 They're impressive.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:26.600
 There are rivers that go through some of the stations out there.

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:27.600
 Yeah.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:28.600
 Slow and square.

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:29.600
 If you look above the platform, there's a tube.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:30.600
 And that tube has a river in it.

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:31.600
 No way.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:32.600
 Yeah.

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.600
 Oh, what is it called?

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:35.600
 It's not the fleet, is it?

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:36.600
 It's, no, it's the Westbourne.

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:37.600
 Oh, that fleet.

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:38.600
 It goes through Farringdon.

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:39.600
 Right.

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:41.600
 And they just look like sewers these days.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:42.600
 But they used to be rivers.

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:44.600
 They used to be London's subsidiary rivers.

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.600
 So, there's not like pedalos and stuff.

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:47.600
 [LAUGHTER]

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.600
 Now there's some pedalos for rats.

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:50.600
 Very horrible.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:54.600
 And you can go to, um, certain shops in central London

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:56.600
 where the owners have in their basement.

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:59.600
 They've dug through the ground, and you can see the river passing.

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:00.600
 Really?

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:03.600
 Yeah, so they sort of do it as an attraction that you can go

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:06.600
 and see within their shop, the rivers of London, that no longer exist.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:07.600
 Oh, why?

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:08.600
 Yeah.

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:10.600
 Um, when they were building the New York subway,

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:13.600
 the guys who were building it were called sandhogs,

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:14.600
 because they dug through lots of sand.

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:18.600
 And I was reading a newspaper report from 1916,

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:22.600
 and it was about this guy called Marshall Maybe,

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:26.600
 who was working in the tunnel to, like, dig the subway.

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:28.600
 And there was a pocket of compressed air,

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:30.600
 which suddenly kind of escaped.

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:33.600
 So he's, like, got this big shield up in the tunnel in front of him,

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.600
 and they're using this shield to, like, push forward

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:36.600
 and make the tunnel bigger.

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:40.600
 And he said he saw an 18-inch pocket of air suddenly appear,

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:42.600
 and it sucked him towards it.

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:43.600
 Whoa.

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:44.600
 He was sucked into it.

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:46.600
 He was blasted up through the ground,

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:49.600
 so he was blasted up through a 12-feet of riverbed,

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.600
 and then blasted up through the river itself,

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:55.600
 and then hurled up 25 feet in the air above the river.

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:58.600
 He wasn't grinding through earth, 12 feet of earth, wasn't he?

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.600
 Yeah, that's what riverbed's made of.

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:01.600
 Yeah.

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:04.600
 It's more plausible for him to be blasted through 12-feet

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.600
 of earth and 12-feet of concrete or steel or whatever.

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:09.600
 No, I was thinking was it just a tunnel,

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.600
 like it was a hole that he was blasted through,

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:12.600
 just happened to be going through.

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:13.600
 Oh, believe it.

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:14.600
 So here we go.

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:16.600
 Let me-- there's a hole in two with him and everything.

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:18.600
 There's a nice interview with his wife saying,

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:19.600
 "It's okay. He's fine."

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.600
 He's looking forward to going back to work.

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.600
 This is what the New York Times said at the time.

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:26.600
 There's a pocket of compressed air to prevent

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.600
 the river's bottom from caving in.

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:32.600
 So they have some-- I don't know how that works.

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:36.600
 But somehow, it happened, guys,

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:38.600
 and this compressed air got loose,

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:41.600
 and he saw an 18-inch hole,

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:43.600
 and before we knew it, he was being sucked towards it.

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:45.600
 Two of his colleagues actually also got sucked in,

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:46.600
 and they did perish.

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:47.600
 Oh, no.

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:49.600
 He survived by blasting up,

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.600
 putting his arm out in front of him and blasting up

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:52.600
 through the riverbed.

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:55.600
 So it's a whole bit deeper.

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:58.600
 12 feet of riverbed.

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:01.600
 And then got shot through, and then out in the air.

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.600
 Then there's enough force left over,

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.600
 shot through the river for itself,

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:06.600
 and then, yeah, 25 feet.

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:07.600
 25 feet.

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.600
 25 feet.

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.600
 The New York Times is a favourite.

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:12.600
 What year is this?

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:13.600
 What year is this?

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:17.600
 Yeah, and what date was this?

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.600
 February 19, 16, right?

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:21.600
 Not April.

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:24.600
 Yeah, it was a little bit insane,

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.600
 but there you go.

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:27.600
 There's a picture of the guy.

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:28.600
 Oh.

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:29.600
 Pictures don't lie.

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:30.600
 What, mid-flight?

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:31.600
 No, mid-flight.

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:32.600
 Yeah.

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.600
 That's extraordinary.

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:35.600
 Did you say that was in New York?

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:36.600
 Yeah.

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:38.600
 It was soft ground, so that's why they were called soft ground.

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:40.600
 Oh, well, if it was soft ground, I see.

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:42.600
 Yeah, it was still a riverbed though.

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.600
 I had a 25 feet after 12 beds of...

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:45.600
 And a river.

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:46.600
 And a river.

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:49.600
 I don't know how it possibly happened.

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:52.600
 I was imagining him being carried up in the bubble of air,

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:54.600
 like in a cropped submarine or something.

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:56.600
 That was amazing.

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:57.600
 Oh, my God.

00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:00.600
 Do you know what the underground was used for during the Second World War?

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:03.600
 It was hospitals?

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:04.600
 I thought Bum Shelter.

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:05.600
 Yeah.

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:06.600
 That was definitely used as Bum Shelters,

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:11.600
 but also the central line was converted into a fighter aircraft factory.

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.600
 Oh, really?

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:16.600
 It stretched for two miles and it had its own train system.

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:18.600
 I don't know if it was the actual tube trains.

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:21.600
 How did they get the aircraft up the escalator?

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:24.600
 What they did is they had some compressed air,

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:27.600
 and they would just blast them up into the sky.

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:28.600
 Isn't that amazing?

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:30.600
 And that was an official secret until the 1980s.

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:31.600
 I'm with Adder, actually.

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:33.600
 How did they get them out?

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:35.600
 Well, in piecemeal, I imagine.

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:36.600
 Oh, OK.

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:37.600
 Or they had a lift or something.

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:38.600
 Right.

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:42.600
 Did you know that Roosevelt had his own underground station built?

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:45.600
 Or there was an underground station built underneath the Waldorf Historia,

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:48.600
 which is the really famous hotel in New York.

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:51.600
 And it was just for people staying at the Waldorf Historia.

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:52.600
 So it was one station.

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:54.600
 And if you didn't want to go with the plebs to ground central station

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:56.600
 or one of the proper tube stations,

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:59.600
 you could just get a lift underground in your hotel.

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:01.600
 And it said, if you brought your own carriage with you,

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:03.600
 so if you had your own carriage.

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:04.600
 What do you do with your carriage?

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:05.600
 Who's the beep people?

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.600
 Those who had their own trains?

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:08.600
 What do you do with your trains?

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:10.600
 You attach it to the back of the tubes.

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.600
 And Roosevelt was...

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:14.600
 And Roosevelt was...

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:16.600
 This is sounding nearly as plausible as your man...

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:17.600
 And we're just coming up.

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:18.600
 And we're just coming up.

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:19.600
 You're not supposed to do that.

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.600
 So he's been the morning hallucinating.

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.600
 Oh, Anna, you've got dance notes there.

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:26.600
 So this is...

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:30.600
 This is researched on by this guy called Dan Brooker,

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:31.600
 who's looked into this.

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:34.600
 He's a tour guide on the New York metro system.

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:37.600
 And he said that FDR used it to hide his disability,

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.600
 so people didn't have to see him kind of walking from the tube.

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:43.600
 And so there would be trains that led to this private underground station

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:46.600
 that could fit his big, arm-a-plated car,

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:48.600
 which would then drive off the train onto the platform

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:50.600
 and straight into the elevator.

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:53.600
 And then his limousine would be lifted up the elevator

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:57.600
 and backed out into the grand ballroom of the door.

00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:59.600
 So he would drive into an elevator?

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:00.600
 Yeah.

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:01.600
 In a limousine.

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:02.600
 Yeah.

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:03.600
 It was already a big lift.

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:04.600
 And it's not on it.

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:06.600
 But then you get to the lift and there's actually a plane in there

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:09.600
 and he's like, "Oh, wait for the next one."

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:11.600
 I don't know, I know.

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:12.600
 Yeah.

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:14.600
 So, yeah, this researcher says it,

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:16.600
 but it was definitely then Roosevelt definitely used it

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:17.600
 to hide his disability.

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:19.600
 They used to have first-class and third-class

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:21.600
 on a couple of London underground lights,

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:24.600
 but no second-class very weirdly.

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:27.600
 Ah, see, that's why I had to explain the zone system earlier.

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:30.600
 It was a very good example of numbers being left out.

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:33.600
 Yeah, and you would have to wait at particular bits of the platform

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:35.600
 depending on what class ticket you had.

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:38.600
 Why did they not have a second class, I wonder?

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:42.600
 It was because there's a stipulation in a railway regulation act

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:43.600
 in the mid-19th century,

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:46.600
 which said all train companies have to offer third-class accommodation.

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:47.600
 Oh, I see.

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:48.600
 So four people can afford it.

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:52.600
 And then eventually they just got rid of first-class.

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:56.600
 So now all the London underground characters are third-class, basically.

00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:57.600
 Are they?

00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:58.600
 Would you say that?

00:13:58.600 --> 00:13:59.600
 I suppose that might be true.

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:00.600
 Yeah, it's a bit of a stretch.

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:02.600
 They definitely got rid of first-class on the lines where they had it.

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:04.600
 Do we know if they had any luxuries?

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:05.600
 Yeah, you did.

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:09.600
 You had two gas lamps instead of one.

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:10.600
 Damn!

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:13.600
 It's a bit like that from the other week

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:15.600
 where you can have two castles in first class.

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:16.600
 Yes.

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:18.600
 (LAUGHTER)

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:19.600
 Shoot me that scene.

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:21.600
 We've probably gone enough on that.

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:24.600
 I have one story about an underground man.

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:25.600
 Sure.

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:26.600
 Sure, why not?

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:28.600
 So this is a story from 1998.

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:33.600
 It's the report of a man who broke the record

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:36.600
 for the length of time spent in a wooden box underground.

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:37.600
 Okay.

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:39.600
 What more than dead people?

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:40.600
 No.

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:41.600
 For the living people.

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:43.600
 For the living people category.

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:44.600
 He was called Jeff Smith.

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:45.600
 He was 37 years old.

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:48.600
 And he beat the European record of 101 days.

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:53.600
 He stayed underground for 150 days.

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:58.600
 And the record that he broke was set by his mother.

00:14:58.600 --> 00:14:59.600
 Oh, my God.

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:01.600
 How many days did she do?

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:03.600
 She did 101.

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:04.600
 And he beat her.

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:08.600
 And then the landlord of the pub in the garden of which

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:11.600
 he was buried underground for three months.

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:12.600
 (LAUGHTER)

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:15.600
 Said, when his mother did it, he was seven years old.

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:16.600
 He's now 37.

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:18.600
 And for the last 30 years, it's been his ambition

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.600
 to go and bury himself in a box.

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:21.600
 (LAUGHTER)

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:24.600
 Did he have some awful rivalry with his mother?

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:25.600
 I don't know.

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:28.600
 I think he was proud to keep the family record alive.

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:31.600
 And how do they keep him alive?

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:34.600
 He's obviously got air tubes.

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:37.600
 They probably just pull peanuts down a tube

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:39.600
 or something because he's in the pub.

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:40.600
 What do you remember?

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:44.600
 There was a book we have in the office

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:46.600
 from a friend of ours, John Bonderson,

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:47.600
 called Barry DeLive.

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.600
 And they used to make caskets for people

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:51.600
 who were petrified of being buried alive.

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:55.600
 So one, had an ability that you could ring a bell

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:56.600
 if you woke up in your casket.

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:59.600
 And while you were waiting for them to dig you out,

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:01.600
 it had a tube where they could send a sausage down.

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:04.600
 (LAUGHTER)

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:06.600
 No, so he had an air tube.

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:09.600
 And he said, through the air tube inserted in the box,

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:11.600
 "I am very pleased to have reached this day.

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:13.600
 My mother would be proud of me."

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:16.600
 If you were in that beer garden and you had a few points,

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:18.600
 you would start pouring beer down his tube.

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:21.600
 I think the beer would be the last of his worries.

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:22.600
 Going down that tube.

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:24.600
 That's a good point.

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:27.600
 Well done for not drowning.

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:29.600
 (LAUGHTER)

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:32.600
 Imagine if you were one day away from getting the record

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:34.600
 and then a massive Erbubble.

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:38.600
 (LAUGHTER)

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:48.600
 Okay, it is time for fact number two.

00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:50.600
 And that is James.

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:52.600
 Okay, my fact this week is that every month,

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:54.600
 the same number of people on average,

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:58.600
 Google how to make love as how to make slime.

00:16:58.600 --> 00:16:59.600
 Yeah.

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:01.600
 I only know one of those things.

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:02.600
 See which one?

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:03.600
 Slime.

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:04.600
 Yeah.

00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:07.600
 Sometimes they could be the same thing this month.

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:09.600
 Let's try and know how to make slime.

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:13.600
 So this is an article on Mondovo.com,

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:15.600
 which is a digital marketing company,

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:19.600
 where they look to the 1000 most asked questions on Google

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:23.600
 and checked how much an advertiser would have to pay

00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:25.600
 for someone to click on their adverts for them.

00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:27.600
 So if you look at the most Google question,

00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:29.600
 which is what is my IP,

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:34.600
 an advertiser would be 0.12 dollars per click,

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:36.600
 and when it's Valentine's Day,

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:38.600
 would be $12.33 per click.

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:40.600
 So that's what they were looking at.

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:42.600
 But really, I just want to talk about slime.

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:47.600
 It is weird though that I didn't realise there's this slime craze at all,

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:50.600
 and maybe that's because I'm not a young child or a parent,

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:52.600
 but there is, and there are all these stories

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:54.600
 in America of glue shortages,

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:55.600
 which people are saying are rubbish,

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:57.600
 but it is true that Wal-Mart's have had to say,

00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:59.600
 look, we have run out of glue in some of our stores,

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:02.600
 and we are trying to keep up with demand as quickly as possible,

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:05.600
 because kids have just started making slime all over the place.

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:06.600
 It's amazing.

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:09.600
 And there are Instagram accounts run by teenagers,

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:11.600
 which have got hundreds of thousands of followers,

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:14.600
 and it's just them gloping slime and touching it

00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:15.600
 and making the glopinises with it.

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:17.600
 And there are all these different slime accounts,

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:19.600
 and there are slime confession accounts,

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:23.600
 which apparently post drama about other slime accounts saying,

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:26.600
 so-and-so didn't invent this new kind of angel slime

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:27.600
 or crunchy slime or whatever.

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:29.600
 Wait, that doesn't sound like a confession.

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:31.600
 That sounds like slime accusation.

00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:32.600
 Yeah, I get.

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:33.600
 What happens on the slime confessions?

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:35.600
 I admit I didn't make that slime.

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:37.600
 Yeah, it's just the rebuttal.

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:38.600
 No, slime confession.

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:40.600
 It's just sort of secondary accounts posted.

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:42.600
 And you get asked,

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:44.600
 because people just put their fingers in the video,

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:45.600
 touching the slime.

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:48.600
 And they get hundreds of messages from people saying,

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:50.600
 "Give us a face reveal," is what it's called.

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:51.600
 Oh, and show your face.

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:53.600
 Do you ever get the face reveal?

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:55.600
 I think people are a bit wary of showing their face,

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:56.600
 especially because they're teenagers.

00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:58.600
 They say, "I don't want to show my face to 100,000 people."

00:18:58.600 --> 00:18:59.600
 Just look at the slime.

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:00.600
 Really?

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:03.600
 That's almost what the majority of YouTubers are.

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:05.600
 I mean, that's the age where they are.

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:07.600
 These guys are only about the slime down.

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:08.600
 They're not there for the fame.

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:11.600
 They're not there for the slime light.

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:14.600
 Hell!

00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:17.600
 Oh dear.

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:18.600
 Is it broken?

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:20.600
 We've broken the podcast.

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:21.600
 It's finally happened.

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:23.600
 Yes, incredible.

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:24.600
 That is amazing.

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:25.600
 I didn't know about that, actually.

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:27.600
 I haven't seen that in my Googling of slime.

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:33.600
 Yeah, for 2016, it was the top 10 how-to searches in the world

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:35.600
 were made in America, but I think it was the world.

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:38.600
 How-to and all the others are, like, how to file my taxes

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:40.600
 or how to, I don't know, whatever else.

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:41.600
 And then it's how to make slime.

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:43.600
 So they are also divided by regions.

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:46.600
 So you can find out what people are Googling how to do in various places.

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:50.600
 So, Sheffield wanted to know mostly how to pluck your eyebrows.

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:53.600
 People in Cardiff and Leeds wanted to know how to work out percentages.

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:58.600
 And in Bradford, the most common how-to search was how-to age lace.

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:03.600
 How-to age, that was the most common thing people wanted to know how to do.

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:04.600
 In Bradford.

00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:07.600
 In Bradford, they're all about lace in Bradford.

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:09.600
 And ageing lace.

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:10.600
 What is ageing lace?

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:13.600
 I guess to make it look older than it is.

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:15.600
 Or is it telling how old it is?

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:16.600
 Oh, yeah.

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:17.600
 Oh, yeah.

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:21.600
 That does feel to me like one or two people Googling a lot, doesn't it?

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:22.600
 Yeah.

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:23.600
 Yeah.

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:25.600
 I've forgotten again.

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:31.600
 It's interesting, because all this slime was very much part of,

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:34.600
 I guess, more James and my childhood than YouTube.

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:38.600
 But the toys that we all had, or used to have them, Teenage Beauty Ninja Turtles,

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:40.600
 used to come with it because they were born out of ooze.

00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:42.600
 So, used to get this little slime with it.

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:44.600
 The Ghostbusters toys, used to get...

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:46.600
 Yeah, slimer.

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:47.600
 Yes, slimer exactly.

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:49.600
 It was such a huge part of toys.

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:51.600
 I don't know if it is so much these days.

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:52.600
 That was gung vintage.

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:55.600
 Like get your own back with Dave Benson Phillips.

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:56.600
 Oh, yeah.

00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:57.600
 It was always evolving out of being gunged.

00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:58.600
 Wasn't it more like putty?

00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:01.600
 So, the slime I remember getting was more like putty with toys.

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:02.600
 That's the farty one.

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:03.600
 That's the one that you go.

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:05.600
 When you put your finger inside.

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:06.600
 I don't think I've got the slime.

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:07.600
 That was the...

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:09.600
 Yeah, the slime was the predated...

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:10.600
 The party, did it?

00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:11.600
 The party putty.

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:12.600
 Yeah, okay.

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:15.600
 One theory about why kids like slime so much,

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:18.600
 especially in the 90s and early 2000s,

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:21.600
 is because it was a time when kids stopped going outside.

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:25.600
 And when, you know, kids in the 60s and 70s would go out,

00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:28.600
 they'd be messing around with bits of gung and, you know,

00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:30.600
 bits of mud and all that kind of thing.

00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:32.600
 And then this was a generation that didn't really play out.

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:34.600
 So, they were indoors a lot.

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:36.600
 So, they had to make do with gung.

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:37.600
 That's amazing.

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:38.600
 Yeah.

00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:39.600
 Don't know if it's true, it's a theory.

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:40.600
 It's a really good theory.

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:41.600
 Yeah, like it.

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:44.600
 The first film I could find that contains the word "slime" in the title

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:48.600
 is a film called "The Slime People" from 1963.

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:49.600
 It was not very well received.

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:51.600
 It got 2.5 on IMDb.

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:53.600
 And apparently, according to Wikipedia,

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:56.600
 it was infamous for its extensive use of fog machines

00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:58.600
 with the fog becoming so thick towards the end

00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:00.600
 that it's virtually impossible to see anything out.

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:07.600
 It started this guy called Robert Hutton, who only got...

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:09.600
 Lots of the first half of the film started.

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:14.600
 Robert Hutton apparently only got work.

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:17.600
 This is going to this random book on films.

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:20.600
 He only got work because he had a startling resemblance to Jimmy Stewart.

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:22.600
 And when Jimmy Stewart was called up for World War II,

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:26.600
 he was just casting lots of films that Jimmy Stewart was supposed to be in.

00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:27.600
 That's amazing.

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:28.600
 That's really good.

00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:29.600
 That's really good.

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:31.600
 Have you guys ever seen The Blob?

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:32.600
 Yeah.

00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:36.600
 So The Blob is one of the first ever B-movie sci-fi horror films.

00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:39.600
 And it's one of Steve McQueen's first ever films as an actor.

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:40.600
 I did not know he was in The Blob.

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:41.600
 Yeah, and it's about...

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:44.600
 Basically, it's about a blob which comes down from space

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:45.600
 and it starts eating things

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:47.600
 and it just absorbs things and then gets bigger.

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:49.600
 So the producer has just died.

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:52.600
 It's kind of like a slime, basically, as The Blob.

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:54.600
 It's sort of this sentient ooze, which just...

00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:55.600
 It's one of those things.

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:59.600
 Yeah. But these days, there is still blob fest every year

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:00.600
 in a town where they shot loads of it.

00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:02.600
 And you can eat blob burgers.

00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:04.600
 And you can pay a small fee.

00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:06.600
 And you can run screaming out of the cinema

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:08.600
 that everyone runs screaming out of in the film

00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:10.600
 when the blob oozes into it.

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:12.600
 What if you want to keep watching the film?

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:13.600
 You can't.

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:16.600
 Do you know that The Blob was based on a true story?

00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:17.600
 No.

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:18.600
 Okay, yeah.

00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:19.600
 No, it really was.

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:21.600
 Can I give you a dance move?

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:24.600
 It was a local report somewhere in America.

00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:27.600
 Some weird substance had been found

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:30.600
 that was kind of jelly-like, probably natural, I guess.

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:32.600
 It probably is, like, frog sperm or something.

00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:35.600
 But the FBI were brought in to investigate it.

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:38.600
 And then it was in the local news and then it got in national news

00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:40.600
 and then they turned it into the story.

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:41.600
 I didn't know that.

00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:42.600
 That's very cool.

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:43.600
 Did it eat people?

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:44.600
 No, no.

00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:47.600
 I think that was a fictional adaptation.

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:53.600
 So in Paris, in the 19th century, they used to have fruit orchards

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:58.600
 and they used to use snail slime to put branding on their apples.

00:23:58.600 --> 00:23:59.600
 No.

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:00.600
 Yeah.

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:03.600
 So what you would do is you'd grow an apple on a tree

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:04.600
 and put it in a paper bag.

00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:06.600
 So it was very pale when it grew.

00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:09.600
 And then you take the paper bag off and you get a stencil

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:12.600
 and you put snail slime in the stencil bit.

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:14.600
 And then you would let it grow a little bit longer.

00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:17.600
 And the rest of the apple would go a nice colour,

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:19.600
 but the bit where the snail slime was wouldn't go the colour

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:21.600
 and so you could have little brands.

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:22.600
 No way!

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:23.600
 That is amazing.

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:24.600
 That is so cool.

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:26.600
 Why did we stop doing that?

00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:27.600
 I don't know.

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:28.600
 We should bring it back.

00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:29.600
 We should bring it back.

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:32.600
 We invented sticky labels and it's better than having an apple.

00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:33.600
 But it's snail slime.

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:37.600
 We don't have to individually bag every apple on your tree.

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:39.600
 That is why we didn't do it.

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:42.600
 I just think that is incredible, though.

00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:46.600
 Snail slime is non-uternian fluid, which we've talked about before.

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:49.600
 So it's a fluid that doesn't really act in the way you'd expect something like water to act.

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:53.600
 And the reason that's really good for snails is that when they excrete it,

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:56.600
 it helps them stick to the ground when they're staying still

00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:57.600
 and root them in the ground.

00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:00.600
 And then it helps them move when they want to move.

00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:03.600
 Because under pressure, it becomes really lubricated and it becomes really slippery.

00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:06.600
 Yeah, they use it like a hoverboard.

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:08.600
 I was thinking like a water slide.

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:12.600
 Yeah, that's probably better actually.

00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:14.600
 But you're not hovering, are they?

00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:16.600
 No, but they're not touching the earth.

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:18.600
 But neither are you if you're in shoes.

00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:20.600
 These are my hover boots.

00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:26.600
 So loads of people have started using snail slime for beauty.

00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:27.600
 This is a big trend now.

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:32.600
 So there have been some spars which have let snails crawl over your face for a fee.

00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:34.600
 You pay the fee not the snail.

00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:39.600
 I read once at the battle of, I think it was a battle of Cressy.

00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:43.600
 They use snails to crawl over the wounds of people on the battlefield

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:45.600
 because it has antibacterial stuff in it.

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:47.600
 No, what the enemy's getting closer.

00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:48.600
 Come on, come on.

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:54.600
 Well, they have methods of getting slime out of snails now

00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:56.600
 because they used to do it in quite a cruel way.

00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:59.600
 They used to put them in water which had lots of salt and vinegar in

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:02.600
 and they freak out and they'd slime loads because it really hurt them.

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:07.600
 But now they've developed in Italian snail farms, a special steam bath.

00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:10.600
 It's like a spa for snails.

00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:12.600
 It's how they're pitching it.

00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:14.600
 I bet that's not how it really is for the snails.

00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:16.600
 It is, they're in these domes which are full of steam.

00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:19.600
 And apparently they take their shell off, put it in the locker.

00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:24.600
 Where do they keep the pound coin?

00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:30.600
 So it's quite nice that people in spars are using slime from snails

00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:33.600
 which of themselves been to a spa already.

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:35.600
 That's so nice.

00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:38.600
 And then the people excrete sweat which they then give back to the snail

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:40.600
 to pop on their faces.

00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:49.600
 Okay, it is time for fact number three.

00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:52.600
 That is Chazinski.

00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:55.600
 My fact this week is that old faithful Giza and Yellowstone

00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:57.600
 used to be used as a washing machine.

00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:02.600
 And this is another true fact of mine this week.

00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:07.600
 So old faithful is this Giza in Yellowstone National Park,

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:10.600
 which is very famous because it's quite reliable when it erupts.

00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:12.600
 So you can go and see it and I've seen it and it's amazing.

00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:16.600
 And in the 1800s when people visited Yellowstone,

00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:19.600
 and it was often soldiers because there were a lot of soldiers placed in the area,

00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:26.600
 then they would chuck their soil or their dirty clothes into the crater of the Giza.

00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:28.600
 And then it's very hot in there.

00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:31.600
 So it would get all the shummi around in there and then blast it out.

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:34.600
 And it's essentially, I think it's about 90 degrees.

00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:36.600
 And it erupts every 80 minutes.

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:39.600
 So it's like putting your clothes on a 90 degree cycle for 80 minutes.

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:43.600
 Yeah, and that's not suitable for woolens as well.

00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:46.600
 90 degrees is too hot.

00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:47.600
 They did see.

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:50.600
 All of the travellers said that you had to not put your woolen clothes in there

00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:52.600
 because they would actually get shredded up a little bit.

00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:56.600
 Yeah, they were completely torn to shreds.

00:27:56.600 --> 00:28:00.600
 Yes, because it stinks of raw sulfuric rotten eggs all over the shop.

00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:05.600
 And someone did acknowledge that it wasn't that good away at cleaning clothes.

00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:10.600
 So there was one book I was reading about the history of Yellowstone said,

00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:13.600
 many articles that go into her chambers never came out again.

00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:17.600
 So Giza laundering was often seen as an enterprise, both futile and costly.

00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:18.600
 Wow.

00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:21.600
 And they would, I mean, I've been the seat to see that as well.

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:23.600
 But really, an explosion, isn't it?

00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:25.600
 So they would have gone flying.

00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:26.600
 Yeah.

00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:28.600
 I would do it, definitely, but with some old t-shirts and things like that.

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:29.600
 Well, you shouldn't do it.

00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:30.600
 It's very clear.

00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:32.600
 You shouldn't put things in the Giza's in Yellowstone.

00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:33.600
 Really?

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:34.600
 They make it very, very clear.

00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:35.600
 I've never been.

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:36.600
 So I think I'm clear.

00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:37.600
 I think I'm allowed to do it.

00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:38.600
 No one's told me not to yet.

00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:41.600
 But when you go, because you have to stay on the wattboards, don't you?

00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:42.600
 Yeah.

00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:48.600
 And then you'll see just like a hat here and a shoe here that have just either blown over or...

00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:49.600
 Oh, really?

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:52.600
 Are there people trying to emulate this, though?

00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:53.600
 I don't think so.

00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:54.600
 Oh, is it left over?

00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:56.600
 Because stuff used to get sucked down and disappear.

00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:59.600
 So it might be 150-year-old shoes left over from these socks.

00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:00.600
 It might be.

00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:03.600
 They mostly look like baseball caps from the current era.

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:04.600
 Okay.

00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:06.600
 This is an amazing fact.

00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:07.600
 It's incredible.

00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:11.600
 You could wash the dishes by dropping them into like Mount Etner or something.

00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:14.600
 And it'll shimmy them around and then explain them out.

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:16.600
 Well, they try to wash dishes in Giza's as well.

00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:17.600
 Do they?

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:18.600
 Everything with them.

00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:19.600
 It's truly bizarre.

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:23.600
 Surely you would know that they would smash on being blasted out.

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:27.600
 Well, for instance, you would get some Giza's which are just like a puddle of water,

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:29.600
 which it's just kind of bubbling.

00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:31.600
 Wouldn't necessarily be firing out massive amounts.

00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:32.600
 Okay.

00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:34.600
 Yeah, was it specifically old faithful?

00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:36.600
 No, lots of Giza's, they did this in.

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:38.600
 So there was one Giza that was called the handkerchief Giza,

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:40.600
 because you'd chuck your handkerchiefs in.

00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:41.600
 Right.

00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:44.600
 And people used to chuck in soap just to make them explode, I think.

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:45.600
 Did they?

00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:47.600
 I think that would prompt them to explode.

00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:48.600
 Yes, it does.

00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:51.600
 It gets between the molecules in some way and court actually causes Giza's to explode.

00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:52.600
 It's mad.

00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:53.600
 That's amazing.

00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:54.600
 Yeah.

00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:55.600
 It's really odd.

00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:58.600
 I was reading about the fact that they have discovered that Yellowstone.

00:29:58.600 --> 00:29:59.600
 This is quite a while ago.

00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:02.600
 Yellowstone is actually what is classified as a super volcano.

00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:06.600
 Because the whole thing effectively is one massive volcano.

00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:11.600
 It's very scary because the last time it went off, it produced so much ash

00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:18.600
 that you could have covered New York State in, I think it was 20 meters of ash.

00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:22.600
 And I'm not sure if they've actually verified this, but I think this is the main theory.

00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:24.600
 There's the Gallatin Mountains.

00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:30.600
 And suddenly in between the mountain range is a 60 mile to 70 mile gap of mountain.

00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:31.600
 It's just missing.

00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:32.600
 It's not there.

00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:34.600
 And they think it was from the explosion.

00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:35.600
 Wow.

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:37.600
 It just wiped out 60 miles of mountain range.

00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:40.600
 So do you reckon that mountain kind of flew up somewhere and landed somewhere else?

00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:41.600
 Yes.

00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:47.600
 Do you know what happens when lava explodes out of a volcano?

00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:48.600
 If a die.

00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:53.600
 Does it go up and then cool down and then fall down like promise kind of stuff or?

00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:59.600
 Kind of, but some of it, a third of the liquid rock, falls back into the volcano.

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:03.600
 It just goes in just straight up and back down again.

00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:04.600
 Wow.

00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:07.600
 Can I just read you really quickly one last anecdote?

00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:11.600
 Obviously the only research I did for this was people putting stuff in geysers for fun.

00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:12.600
 Yeah.

00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:14.600
 So just one last anecdote, which I really enjoyed.

00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:17.600
 And this was from a guy called Norton, who was a travel writer.

00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:20.600
 He was one of the first people to write about visiting Yellowstone National Park.

00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:26.600
 And he went with Rich Companion, who he nicknamed Prince Telegraph, because he owned all these Telegraph lines.

00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:28.600
 And he was obviously some posh tof.

00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:34.600
 And so Norton recorded that Prince Telegraph couldn't be bothered to wash up the crockery on the day that it was his turn.

00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:42.600
 So he dumped it in a small shallow looking geyser and smoked a pipe by the side of the geyser in the hope that it would wash the crockery.

00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:46.600
 And the geyser suddenly started spitting and like whirling all the contents of the crockery around.

00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:50.600
 And they, so the rest of the group hadn't realised that Prince Telegraph had done this.

00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:52.600
 They just heard this shout from him.

00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:54.600
 And they turned around and saw him.

00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:56.600
 He was making an agonizing cry for help.

00:31:56.600 --> 00:32:02.600
 They beheld him with his hat off an eyes peeled, dancing around his dishpan and a frantic attempt to save the culinary outfit.

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:09.600
 He would plunge his hand into the boiling water, yell with pain and out would come a spoon, another plunge and yell and a tin plate.

00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:13.600
 And apparently he just kept on throwing his head down into this water and scrambling around.

00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:15.600
 And all their crockery got sucked into the geyser.

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:16.600
 You've got to let it go mate.

00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:17.600
 Yeah.

00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:19.600
 I would say a spoon is not worth it for losing your hands.

00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:24.600
 Also, if it was a porcelain plate, maybe, but a tin plate, you're going from hot to hot to hot.

00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:25.600
 Oh, yeah.

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:27.600
 Yeah, but he's taken all their crockery.

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:30.600
 What if they're stuck in Yellowstone without anything to eat off?

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:31.600
 Yeah.

00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:33.600
 I guess they'll have to have finger food from then on.

00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:38.600
 And it does have a trout jacuzzi.

00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:41.600
 Is this like your sauna for snails?

00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:42.600
 Yeah.

00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:47.600
 And the is starting up a whole spa for different animals on you.

00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:50.600
 You've got the weight room for a camel.

00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:53.600
 Does it have different settings?

00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:56.600
 Like, can they turn on the bubble?

00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:59.600
 What it is is that sometimes there are little eruptions.

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:06.600
 In this trout jacuzzi, which stir up lots of crustaceans and other little insects that trout like to eat.

00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:11.600
 And so the trout know that this is happening and they swim around whenever there's a little upburst of liquid.

00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:13.600
 So it's like having a jacuzzi.

00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:14.600
 Well, like sausages.

00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:19.600
 Which would be the best jacuzzi in the world ever.

00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:30.600
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show and that is Andy.

00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:37.600
 My fact is that there are three world's largest porch swings in Nebraska, Louisiana and Ontario.

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:40.600
 And none of them is on a porch.

00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:46.600
 This is the fact that it was sent in actually sent in by a guy called Jeremy Michael Voss on Twitter.

00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:50.600
 And there are lots of porch swings, which are supposed to be the world's largest.

00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:53.600
 And you can see them all and they're nowhere near a porch.

00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:54.600
 Surely we've measured them.

00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:56.600
 Yeah, I was going to say the same.

00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:59.600
 Surely we know from all those pictures, which is the biggest.

00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:02.600
 Not quite, but they're sort of all similar size.

00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:04.600
 They're all identical inside.

00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:06.600
 Very weird that someone wouldn't...

00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:12.600
 It could be that one's the tallest, one's the widest and one's the whatever, the other...

00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:19.600
 Could be that no one could be asked to measure them, because they're just big porch swings.

00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:21.600
 Professional measures are better things to do.

00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:25.600
 I don't actually know which of them is the largest, but there are all these sort of world's largest things all over the place.

00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:28.600
 And there are lots of conflicts between people aren't there.

00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:29.600
 So how large are they?

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:31.600
 And I don't mean the exact measurements.

00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:36.600
 I mean, if I was sitting on one, is it like when you go to those places where they have big chairs and big tables and you're meant to look like a...

00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:38.600
 Which places are these then?

00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:42.600
 You can go to places that make you feel like one of the borrowers where they have just giant furniture.

00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:43.600
 Can you?

00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:44.600
 Yeah.

00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:47.600
 Dan is looking at me, like there's one of these places on every corner.

00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:50.600
 It's weird that I've never been to one.

00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:51.600
 So what do you mean?

00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:56.600
 The world's largest chair is a really epic battle between lots of different places.

00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:59.600
 It started in 1905.

00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:01.600
 I strapped yourselves in.

00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:03.600
 This is kind of a long anecdote.

00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:08.600
 So it started in 1905 and Gardner, Massachusetts erected a 12 foot tall chair.

00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:14.600
 And then a place called Thomasville North Carolina made one that was 13 feet six inches.

00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:18.600
 And then those two places just got more and more bigger and bigger chairs.

00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:22.600
 Eventually there was an 18 foot chair in Thomasville.

00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:25.600
 But then the war happened.

00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:31.600
 And then after the war, there were various largest chairs in Bennington, Vermont, Washington, D.C.,

00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:37.600
 Boris Town, Tennessee, Binghampton, New York, Wingdale, New York, Aniston, Alabama.

00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:43.600
 Aniston, Alabama had the biggest chair until 2001 when it was destroyed by a storm.

00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:47.600
 So all these other towns in America had all the biggest chair at various times.

00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:50.600
 But now the world's biggest chair is in Italy.

00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:52.600
 And it's 65 feet tall.

00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:53.600
 65 feet.

00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:54.600
 Wow.

00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:59.600
 And it could be even bigger if it wasn't for that dastardly war that interrupted them.

00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:04.600
 That's the most that anyone's ever glossed over the second world war.

00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:09.600
 He was telling the biggest story.

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:12.600
 Is that the one that's in Italy?

00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:14.600
 Is that a place called Manzano?

00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:15.600
 Yes, that's right.

00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:18.600
 There's a fact about it, which is, I can't believe this.

00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:21.600
 Is that a third of the world's chairs are manufactured there.

00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:26.600
 They might do, though, because some, like in China, where there's Sock City and there's, like,

00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:30.600
 there's some villages and towns that just decide that's what we do.

00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:32.600
 Everything here is chair-based or Sock City.

00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:35.600
 Yeah, but if you think about how many chairs there must be in the world,

00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:38.600
 everyone in the world on average is going to welcome at least a chair, aren't they?

00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:44.600
 Yeah, but I think like how many chairs are you sitting on right now?

00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:45.600
 What?

00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:46.600
 What, yeah?

00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:47.600
 How many socks are you wearing?

00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:49.600
 Well, yeah, I do see your point.

00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:50.600
 Yeah.

00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:55.600
 But there are, is it three?

00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:57.600
 No, I do see that point.

00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:01.600
 But like around this table, there's more than what two chairs per person.

00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:02.600
 Yeah, that's true.

00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:06.600
 And also, there's too much variety in chairs for them all to be coming from the same factory

00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:07.600
 or a Sock sort of the same, aren't they?

00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:09.600
 Yeah, I don't think it can be.

00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:11.600
 Socks aren't all the same.

00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:15.600
 I mean, not even the two that I'm wearing at the same time.

00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:18.600
 So there is a thing in America.

00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:22.600
 A lot of these are roadside attractions where they would try and get people into your town or whatever.

00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:25.600
 So there are a few world largest balls of twine.

00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:26.600
 Oh, yeah.

00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:27.600
 There's a huge thing.

00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:30.600
 On Wikipedia, there's one entry about the world largest ball of twine.

00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:31.600
 And this is what it says.

00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:36.600
 It says, "The world's largest ball of twine in Corker City was built as a response to the

00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:40.600
 Minnesota town of Darwin's efforts to grab the title.

00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:43.600
 That reads very much like someone from Corker City."

00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:45.600
 And it's unhappy with Darwin.

00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:47.600
 And they're usually the ball of twine.

00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:49.600
 Is it usually just one person really, isn't it?

00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:54.600
 It's kind of just like over years and years and years just making these balls of twine.

00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:55.600
 It thinks so.

00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:56.600
 Weirdly pointless.

00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:58.600
 What a great life, that would be.

00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:00.600
 Everything we do is a little bit pointless, isn't it?

00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:01.600
 I think this is a little pointless.

00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:03.600
 We're all going to die in the end, aren't they?

00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:08.600
 I know, but I'm not sure I want to continue doing this on campus.

00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:10.600
 But this is always the thing.

00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:13.600
 The thing I find very odd with a lot of these, like the world's largest chair.

00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:14.600
 It's not a chair.

00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:16.600
 It's a model of a chair.

00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:17.600
 No, but it's still a chair.

00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:18.600
 You can sit on it.

00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:19.100
 Yeah.

00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:21.600
 What about the world's largest banana, which is a model of a banana?

00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:23.600
 No, no, because that the world's largest banana.

00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:27.600
 No, no, no, that's different because you'd have to make the inside of a banana out of banana.

00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:28.600
 I see.

00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:30.600
 I think I see the distinction you're drawing and I think it's fair.

00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:31.600
 Thank you.

00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:32.600
 Oh, I was coming around to you all the way.

00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:33.600
 No, no.

00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:35.600
 So this guy's made the world's largest knitting needles, he claims.

00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:38.600
 They're 13 feet long and I actually don't think they are knitting needles.

00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:40.600
 Wait, but what disqualify, what disqualify is it?

00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:42.600
 Because you can't knit with them.

00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:44.600
 I don't either use of the thing for the thing.

00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:46.600
 I bet he has done some knitting with it.

00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:48.600
 The world's largest judgment.

00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:49.600
 Yeah, the world's largest.

00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:54.600
 In the knitting needle one, I often see these things because we spend a lot of time on the internet.

00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:59.600
 But I have often seen world's most largest functional knitting needle as a actual record.

00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:00.600
 Right.

00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:01.600
 That's interesting.

00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:02.600
 Okay.

00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:03.600
 Now I'm intrigued.

00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:07.600
 It's so weird how niche our knowledge is that I mentioned the world's largest knitting needle.

00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:13.600
 James is often covered across the world's largest functional line.

00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:16.600
 What are our lives?

00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:18.600
 They're just pointless.

00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:19.600
 Escapedes to the death.

00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:20.600
 We've reached.

00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:21.600
 We've reached.

00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:27.600
 Marching towards oblivion with our giant missing needle.

00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:29.600
 Australia has a load of these things.

00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:32.600
 There's an incredible Wikipedia page about the big things of Australia.

00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:33.600
 Okay.

00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:34.600
 It's what they're called.

00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:37.600
 And they're about 150.

00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:40.600
 What's the famous as a big pineapple, I think?

00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:42.600
 Yeah, they've got the world's largest artificial prawn.

00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:46.600
 World's largest artificial trout, artificial banana, artificial eagle.

00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:47.600
 That's weird.

00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:51.600
 I thought I'd been to the world's largest artificial prawn.

00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:52.600
 But it wasn't.

00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:53.600
 I've never been to Australia.

00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:54.600
 It was.

00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:55.600
 I thought it was in.

00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:56.600
 Maybe it's a touring prawn.

00:39:56.600 --> 00:40:00.600
 It's pretty big, James.

00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:05.600
 It could probably have made it, of course, in the time since you've seen it.

00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:08.600
 I thought it was imploring the keys, but I'm.

00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:11.600
 And they're the coast.

00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:12.600
 I think about it.

00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:14.600
 It might have been a crayfish.

00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:15.600
 It's so embarrassing.

00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:17.600
 There's one of these things done.

00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:18.600
 There's one thing.

00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:20.600
 It's called the big A is rock, right?

00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:23.600
 And it's a one to 40 scale model of A is rock.

00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:24.600
 Which way is the scale?

00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:25.600
 It's smaller.

00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:26.600
 Oh, right.

00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:35.600
 So Wikipedia points out it's technically not a big thing, as it is substantially smaller than the idea that it's modeled on.

00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:37.600
 Can I bring it back to swings quickly?

00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:38.600
 Yeah.

00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:46.600
 It was a very big year last year for the swing 2016, because the swing was inducted into the toy Hall of Fame.

00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:47.600
 Oh, awesome.

00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:48.600
 Yeah.

00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:49.600
 They inducted a few things in one go.

00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:52.600
 So the little peoples, I don't know if you know that.

00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:53.600
 It's a type of toy.

00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:55.600
 It's made by Fisher Price.

00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:59.600
 That was inducted Dungeons and Dragons was inducted.

00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:06.600
 The little people, they've tied for the most nominations because there's a big final round and then they pick three.

00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:12.600
 So the magic eight ball ties with the little people for the most nominations of something that's not made it into the ball.

00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:14.600
 So the magic eight ball is still isn't in there.

00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:15.600
 Still not in there.

00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:16.600
 Yeah.

00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:20.600
 And then when you shake it, it goes not looking good.

00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:22.600
 So the swing was up against this year.

00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:25.600
 This is who it had to beat to get into the Hall of Fame.

00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:28.600
 It was up against Uno, the car game.

00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:29.600
 Oh, yeah.

00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:31.600
 It was up against Care Bears.

00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:36.600
 It was up against Rockham Sockham Robots.

00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:37.600
 I don't know if you remember that.

00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:38.600
 Transformers.

00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:39.600
 Coloring books.

00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:41.600
 Oh, they're an adult thing really these days.

00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:42.600
 Yeah, that might have disqualified it.

00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:43.600
 And bubble wrap.

00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:46.600
 So it managed to defeat bubble wrap.

00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:49.600
 Bubble wrap is not a tie, I wouldn't say.

00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:50.600
 Well, it's in the past.

00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:53.600
 They have put the stick into the toy Hall of Fame, haven't they?

00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:54.600
 Yes.

00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:57.600
 No, that was the, that got awarded the oldest toy.

00:41:57.600 --> 00:41:59.600
 All the lifetime achievement award.

00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:01.600
 It was something like that, yeah.

00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:04.600
 But yeah, so the swing has finally made it in.

00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:06.600
 Have you guys heard of Keaking?

00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:07.600
 What is Keaking?

00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:09.600
 It's competitive swinging in Estonia.

00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:10.600
 And it's a really big deal.

00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:12.600
 And it's the coolest thing ever.

00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:13.600
 I could barely watch it.

00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:16.600
 So it's swinging, but all the way over.

00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:18.600
 But the solid swings, aren't they?

00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:19.600
 They're solid, yeah.

00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:20.600
 So they're on poles.

00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:24.600
 But the challenge is to have as long a pole as possible on your swing.

00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:27.600
 So the, the, instead of rope coming down,

00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:30.600
 they're like big knitting needles.

00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:32.600
 I understand now.

00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:34.600
 But it's terrifying, right?

00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:37.600
 Because as you swing up, that your feet are strapped onto the swing.

00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:41.600
 But as you swing up to the point where you're almost going over the top,

00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:45.600
 you just, as you can imagine, you hang upside down there just before you fall back.

00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:47.600
 Oh, yes, those, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:48.600
 And they're ridiculously high.

00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:53.600
 So the, the world record at the moment is a sort of knitting needle of 7.03 meters.

00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:59.600
 So that means that you'll be hanging upside down 14 meters high, which is about five stories high.

00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:00.600
 Yeah.

00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:03.600
 That is, you can almost get up to the world's tallest chair from up there.

00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:04.600
 Yes.

00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:10.600
 So there's some orangutans in the Netherlands in the Uwenhans,

00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:14.600
 Deer and Park Rinan, which have obviously pronounced wrong, which is a zoo.

00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:17.600
 And they've forgotten how to swing in trees.

00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:20.600
 Because they're, they just didn't have any trees in where they're living.

00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:22.600
 So they've forgotten how to do it.

00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:24.600
 But then they got them some trees.

00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:26.600
 And they were like, great, we got some trees.

00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:29.600
 But now the orangutans didn't know how to swing in them.

00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:35.600
 So they hired an Olympic gymnast to swing in the trees.

00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:38.600
 And to try and like show them what to do.

00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:39.600
 That is incredible.

00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:42.600
 The idea is to encourage them into doing that.

00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:45.600
 It's not exercise. Like, why do they want them to do it?

00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:47.600
 Well, yeah, because that's what orangutans do.

00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:49.600
 And what you want from a zoo, isn't it?

00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:51.600
 When you see an orangutan, you want it to be swinging.

00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:52.600
 Or trees.

00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:54.600
 Does this woman dress up?

00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:55.600
 Is it a woman or a man?

00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:56.600
 It was a guy.

00:43:56.600 --> 00:43:58.600
 Does he dress up as an orangutan?

00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:00.600
 I don't think he does now.

00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:02.600
 But you, that would make sense, wouldn't it?

00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:07.600
 I really hope they come back in a few months and the orangutans are all landing, you know, perfectly in the nose.

00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:17.600
 Okay, that is it. That is all of our facts.

00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:19.600
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:27.600
