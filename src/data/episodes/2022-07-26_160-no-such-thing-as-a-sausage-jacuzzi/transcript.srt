00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,280
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

2
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,560
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

3
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:28,660
 My name is Dan Schreiber, and I am sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray,

4
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:32,720
 and Anna Chazinsky, and once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our

5
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:39,080
 four favorite facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go.

6
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:44,540
 Starting this week with my fact, my fact this week is that at rush hour, there are more

7
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:49,660
 people under the ground in London than there are above the ground in Edinburgh.

8
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:51,660
 Wow, that's great.

9
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:52,660
 No.

10
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:53,660
 And you don't mean dead people do you?

11
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:54,660
 No, I don't.

12
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:58,120
 I mean, rush hour, I mean the London Underground system.

13
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:03,180
 There are more people on trains below the ground than there are people in total every day.

14
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:08,580
 Actually, you might have underestimated that because did you count people living in basement

15
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:09,580
 flats?

16
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,080
 No, I didn't.

17
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,080
 You didn't.

18
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,080
 I bet there are even more people.

19
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,120
 What about dead people?

20
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,120
 That's cold.

21
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,120
 We can't go there.

22
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:23,500
 Actually, you know you just said dead people, and vaguely about population.

23
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:27,220
 I found out this week that the thing about there, this is probably something everyone else

24
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:28,220
 knows.

25
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:32,320
 But the thing about there being more people alive today than had ever lived in the past is

26
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,320
 so far wrong.

27
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,320
 It's ridiculously wrong.

28
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:40,320
 So, you know you always hear that fact, and I think there's something like about 100 billion

29
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,860
 people have been alive on earth, and obviously there isn't nearly that many people alive today,

30
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:45,860
 and so it's just rubbish.

31
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:46,860
 Okay.

32
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:47,860
 And let's come from.

33
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:48,860
 Wow.

34
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:49,860
 Anyway, sorry about to you.

35
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,760
 Busted a myth right at the top of the show.

36
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,760
 That's exciting.

37
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,760
 Is this people on the London Underground?

38
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,760
 Yep.

39
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,760
 This is people on the London Underground.

40
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:59,960
 I read this fact in a Bill Bryson book called The Road to Little Dribbling.

41
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,800
 It was his last tour of the UK.

42
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:06,760
 It was a follow-up to notes from a small island, and in it he's on the London Underground.

43
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:11,320
 He got the fact from Time Out, which is a magazine in London, and in it it said that daily

44
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:16,960
 there were 600,000 people on the London Underground, and the population of Edinburgh is something

45
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,960
 like 460,000.

46
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,440
 Isn't it at any given moment on the Underground?

47
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,840
 Well, we thought that, and that's when I sent you guys that fact, but then I took it to

48
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,560
 our calculations master, James, and said, "Is that possible?"

49
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,680
 And James worked out that that can't be right, but you said that it would be right for rush

50
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,680
 hour.

51
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,680
 Yeah.

52
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,640
 I think the maximum that you might get at rush hour would be about 600,000.

53
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,400
 And do we think the population of Edinburgh is around 500,000?

54
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,400
 Something like that?

55
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,400
 Yeah, just under, yeah.

56
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:49,200
 I looked at some other 600,000s at the moment, and Ed Sheeran's shape of you just passed

57
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:57,880
 around 600,000 downloads quite recently, but it's also been streamed 121 million times since

58
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,880
 it was released.

59
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,880
 No way.

60
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,880
 Yeah.

61
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,920
 And it's three minutes, 50 something long.

62
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:10,120
 And so if you add up all of those streamings together, it takes you to 893 years that people

63
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,360
 have been listening to that song.

64
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:18,640
 And so if you go into the future 893 years, then that's 100 years after Wally is set.

65
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,640
 Oh.

66
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:24,320
 And it's the time when scientists decimate that the radiation levels in Chernobyl will be

67
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,360
 back down to normal.

68
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,160
 That long for Chernobyl to be back?

69
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,160
 Well done, Ed Sheeran.

70
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,160
 Wow.

71
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,160
 What did I say?

72
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,160
 Thanks for clearing up Chernobyl.

73
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,160
 Yeah.

74
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,160
 I've understood.

75
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,160
 Yeah.

76
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:40,920
 But I mean, if we go by what happens in Wally, it doesn't look like a place to inhabit anymore.

77
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,880
 But it's 100 years after Wally, so maybe.

78
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,880
 It's sorted itself out.

79
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,880
 Sorted itself out.

80
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,880
 Got back down.

81
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,720
 That's the sequel.

82
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,600
 I've got a quibble with your fact, Dan.

83
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,600
 Uh-oh.

84
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,600
 Sure.

85
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,120
 Half London Underground is overground.

86
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,120
 Oh, yes.

87
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,640
 So I'm just full stalling people right again, say.

88
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,640
 Oh.

89
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,640
 I know.

90
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,640
 Really half of it is.

91
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,640
 More than half, I think.

92
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:01,640
 More than half.

93
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,640
 Yeah.

94
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,640
 God, how did we not think of that?

95
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,640
 Didn't think of that, bit.

96
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,640
 Yeah.

97
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,640
 Wow.

98
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,640
 Oh, sorry.

99
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,600
 I've been keeping that under my hat as a sort of cool thing to bring up, which wouldn't

100
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,760
 necessarily invalidate the whole section.

101
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,760
 But let's face it.

102
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,240
 The rush hour, no one's in those weird out-of-bit things.

103
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,240
 Yeah, exactly.

104
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,760
 The weird out-of-the-car.

105
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:22,720
 The tube does go.

106
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,720
 It goes much further.

107
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:28,280
 I got offered a stand-up gig ages ago, and it was in Zone 9, which I didn't know existed.

108
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,520
 But I was like, sure, I can see it on the map.

109
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,720
 It took something like two hours to get there.

110
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,720
 Yeah.

111
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:39,280
 And when we emerged from the train, because you, as you say, some of it goes overground,

112
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,840
 we emerged, and there were cows in my window.

113
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,840
 There was literally a field with sheep and cows.

114
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,040
 You can see that on the tube.

115
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,640
 It used to go even further.

116
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,880
 Sorry, you had a joke.

117
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,920
 I was just going to say this sounds like a really hot gig you were at.

118
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,920
 [LAUGHTER]

119
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:02,160
 It was 1,000-seater barns somewhere.

120
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,440
 You couldn't hear all the booze because of all the moose.

121
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,640
 [LAUGHTER]

122
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,120
 No, it used to go even further than that, though.

123
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,800
 It used to-- the metropolitan line, which I think is the one that goes up to Zone 9.

124
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,600
 So most stations don't have Zone 9.

125
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,680
 Metropolitan line used to go 40 miles out of London.

126
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,480
 Wow.

127
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,720
 It used to go all the way to Ellsbury.

128
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:24,400
 We should say, for overseas people, Covent Garden, where we work, is in Zone 1.

129
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,920
 And then if you get a bit further out of London, North London, like--

130
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,640
 You get to Zone 2, Zone 2.

131
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,000
 And then what comes after that, Dad?

132
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,960
 So, interestingly, if you go to where I live, it's Zone 3.

133
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,600
 And is that further out or closer in than Zone 2?

134
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,680
 And that's just-- that's one further out.

135
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,200
 OK.

136
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,040
 Yeah, but two further out than Zone 1.

137
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,880
 So, yeah, it's-- and then it works its way out to Zone 9.

138
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,400
 Wow.

139
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,160
 Yeah, it's great.

140
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,200
 There's quite a few in between that, but we don't have time.

141
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,200
 [LAUGHTER]

142
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,960
 And they're one of the ones in between.

143
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,320
 So you go four, five.

144
00:05:54,320 --> 00:06:01,280
 If you go out to one of the far zones, so this will be a number higher than four and five even,

145
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:08,240
 you can get to the station Roding Valley, which is the least used station on the entire underground.

146
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:13,880
 And they have about 712 passengers a day, OK.

147
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:19,280
 And it's not as many as Edinburgh, but it is the same population as Elmington, the highest

148
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,280
 village in Warwickshire.

149
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,280
 It is.

150
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,960
 Exactly the same population.

151
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,880
 According to the 2011 census.

152
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:29,720
 So, how are they getting from Elmington to Roding Valley?

153
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,720
 I see what you mean.

154
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,080
 It's not the same people.

155
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,080
 Ah, that was confusing.

156
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:40,080
 And one person who does live in Elmington is Les Wexner, who's the man behind Victoria's

157
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,080
 secret.

158
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,080
 Wow.

159
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,080
 Oh.

160
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,320
 Not Victoria, the train station in London, though.

161
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,320
 [LAUGHTER]

162
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,320
 No.

163
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,320
 Right.

164
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,320
 What is Victoria's secret?

165
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,320
 Well, it's actually 65 metres underground.

166
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,320
 [LAUGHTER]

167
00:06:54,320 --> 00:07:00,560
 Did you know that over 47 million litres of water pumped out of the underground every day?

168
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,560
 Oh, yeah.

169
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,560
 Oh, yeah.

170
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,560
 Yeah, because it's that far down.

171
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,400
 So, lots of water, lots of water in the ground, and it keeps on pouring in.

172
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,400
 They keep on pumping it out.

173
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,600
 Why did they pump it out, too?

174
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,600
 Zoned 10.

175
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,600
 [LAUGHTER]

176
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,600
 I don't know.

177
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,600
 Um, that's really cool.

178
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,600
 So, it's pouring in.

179
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,600
 You never see it, do you?

180
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,600
 No.

181
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,600
 They do quite a good job of keeping it away from the public sections.

182
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,600
 Yeah.

183
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,600
 Yeah.

184
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,600
 Yeah.

185
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,600
 They're impressive.

186
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,600
 There are rivers that go through some of the stations out there.

187
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,600
 Yeah.

188
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,600
 Slow and square.

189
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,600
 If you look above the platform, there's a tube.

190
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,600
 And that tube has a river in it.

191
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,600
 No way.

192
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,600
 Yeah.

193
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,600
 Oh, what is it called?

194
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,600
 It's not the fleet, is it?

195
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,600
 It's, no, it's the Westbourne.

196
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,600
 Oh, that fleet.

197
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,600
 It goes through Farringdon.

198
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,600
 Right.

199
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,600
 And they just look like sewers these days.

200
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,600
 But they used to be rivers.

201
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,600
 They used to be London's subsidiary rivers.

202
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,600
 So, there's not like pedalos and stuff.

203
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,600
 [LAUGHTER]

204
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,600
 Now there's some pedalos for rats.

205
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,600
 Very horrible.

206
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,600
 And you can go to, um, certain shops in central London

207
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,600
 where the owners have in their basement.

208
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,600
 They've dug through the ground, and you can see the river passing.

209
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,600
 Really?

210
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,600
 Yeah, so they sort of do it as an attraction that you can go

211
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,600
 and see within their shop, the rivers of London, that no longer exist.

212
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,600
 Oh, why?

213
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,600
 Yeah.

214
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,600
 Um, when they were building the New York subway,

215
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,600
 the guys who were building it were called sandhogs,

216
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,600
 because they dug through lots of sand.

217
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:18,600
 And I was reading a newspaper report from 1916,

218
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:22,600
 and it was about this guy called Marshall Maybe,

219
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:26,600
 who was working in the tunnel to, like, dig the subway.

220
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,600
 And there was a pocket of compressed air,

221
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,600
 which suddenly kind of escaped.

222
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,600
 So he's, like, got this big shield up in the tunnel in front of him,

223
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,600
 and they're using this shield to, like, push forward

224
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,600
 and make the tunnel bigger.

225
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,600
 And he said he saw an 18-inch pocket of air suddenly appear,

226
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,600
 and it sucked him towards it.

227
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,600
 Whoa.

228
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,600
 He was sucked into it.

229
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,600
 He was blasted up through the ground,

230
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,600
 so he was blasted up through a 12-feet of riverbed,

231
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,600
 and then blasted up through the river itself,

232
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,600
 and then hurled up 25 feet in the air above the river.

233
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,600
 He wasn't grinding through earth, 12 feet of earth, wasn't he?

234
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,600
 Yeah, that's what riverbed's made of.

235
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,600
 Yeah.

236
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,600
 It's more plausible for him to be blasted through 12-feet

237
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,600
 of earth and 12-feet of concrete or steel or whatever.

238
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,600
 No, I was thinking was it just a tunnel,

239
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,600
 like it was a hole that he was blasted through,

240
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,600
 just happened to be going through.

241
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,600
 Oh, believe it.

242
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,600
 So here we go.

243
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,600
 Let me-- there's a hole in two with him and everything.

244
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,600
 There's a nice interview with his wife saying,

245
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,600
 "It's okay. He's fine."

246
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,600
 He's looking forward to going back to work.

247
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,600
 This is what the New York Times said at the time.

248
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,600
 There's a pocket of compressed air to prevent

249
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,600
 the river's bottom from caving in.

250
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,600
 So they have some-- I don't know how that works.

251
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,600
 But somehow, it happened, guys,

252
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,600
 and this compressed air got loose,

253
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,600
 and he saw an 18-inch hole,

254
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,600
 and before we knew it, he was being sucked towards it.

255
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,600
 Two of his colleagues actually also got sucked in,

256
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,600
 and they did perish.

257
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,600
 Oh, no.

258
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,600
 He survived by blasting up,

259
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,600
 putting his arm out in front of him and blasting up

260
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,600
 through the riverbed.

261
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,600
 So it's a whole bit deeper.

262
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,600
 12 feet of riverbed.

263
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,600
 And then got shot through, and then out in the air.

264
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,600
 Then there's enough force left over,

265
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,600
 shot through the river for itself,

266
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,600
 and then, yeah, 25 feet.

267
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,600
 25 feet.

268
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,600
 25 feet.

269
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,600
 The New York Times is a favourite.

270
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,600
 What year is this?

271
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,600
 What year is this?

272
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,600
 Yeah, and what date was this?

273
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,600
 February 19, 16, right?

274
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,600
 Not April.

275
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,600
 Yeah, it was a little bit insane,

276
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,600
 but there you go.

277
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,600
 There's a picture of the guy.

278
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,600
 Oh.

279
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,600
 Pictures don't lie.

280
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,600
 What, mid-flight?

281
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,600
 No, mid-flight.

282
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,600
 Yeah.

283
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,600
 That's extraordinary.

284
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,600
 Did you say that was in New York?

285
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,600
 Yeah.

286
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,600
 It was soft ground, so that's why they were called soft ground.

287
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,600
 Oh, well, if it was soft ground, I see.

288
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,600
 Yeah, it was still a riverbed though.

289
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,600
 I had a 25 feet after 12 beds of...

290
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,600
 And a river.

291
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,600
 And a river.

292
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,600
 I don't know how it possibly happened.

293
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,600
 I was imagining him being carried up in the bubble of air,

294
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,600
 like in a cropped submarine or something.

295
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,600
 That was amazing.

296
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,600
 Oh, my God.

297
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,600
 Do you know what the underground was used for during the Second World War?

298
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,600
 It was hospitals?

299
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,600
 I thought Bum Shelter.

300
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,600
 Yeah.

301
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,600
 That was definitely used as Bum Shelters,

302
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:11,600
 but also the central line was converted into a fighter aircraft factory.

303
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,600
 Oh, really?

304
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,600
 It stretched for two miles and it had its own train system.

305
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,600
 I don't know if it was the actual tube trains.

306
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,600
 How did they get the aircraft up the escalator?

307
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,600
 What they did is they had some compressed air,

308
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,600
 and they would just blast them up into the sky.

309
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,600
 Isn't that amazing?

310
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,600
 And that was an official secret until the 1980s.

311
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,600
 I'm with Adder, actually.

312
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,600
 How did they get them out?

313
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,600
 Well, in piecemeal, I imagine.

314
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,600
 Oh, OK.

315
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,600
 Or they had a lift or something.

316
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,600
 Right.

317
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,600
 Did you know that Roosevelt had his own underground station built?

318
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,600
 Or there was an underground station built underneath the Waldorf Historia,

319
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,600
 which is the really famous hotel in New York.

320
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,600
 And it was just for people staying at the Waldorf Historia.

321
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,600
 So it was one station.

322
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,600
 And if you didn't want to go with the plebs to ground central station

323
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,600
 or one of the proper tube stations,

324
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,600
 you could just get a lift underground in your hotel.

325
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,600
 And it said, if you brought your own carriage with you,

326
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,600
 so if you had your own carriage.

327
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,600
 What do you do with your carriage?

328
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,600
 Who's the beep people?

329
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,600
 Those who had their own trains?

330
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,600
 What do you do with your trains?

331
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,600
 You attach it to the back of the tubes.

332
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,600
 And Roosevelt was...

333
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,600
 And Roosevelt was...

334
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,600
 This is sounding nearly as plausible as your man...

335
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,600
 And we're just coming up.

336
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,600
 And we're just coming up.

337
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,600
 You're not supposed to do that.

338
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,600
 So he's been the morning hallucinating.

339
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,600
 Oh, Anna, you've got dance notes there.

340
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,600
 So this is...

341
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:30,600
 This is researched on by this guy called Dan Brooker,

342
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,600
 who's looked into this.

343
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,600
 He's a tour guide on the New York metro system.

344
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,600
 And he said that FDR used it to hide his disability,

345
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,600
 so people didn't have to see him kind of walking from the tube.

346
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,600
 And so there would be trains that led to this private underground station

347
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,600
 that could fit his big, arm-a-plated car,

348
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,600
 which would then drive off the train onto the platform

349
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,600
 and straight into the elevator.

350
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,600
 And then his limousine would be lifted up the elevator

351
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,600
 and backed out into the grand ballroom of the door.

352
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,600
 So he would drive into an elevator?

353
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,600
 Yeah.

354
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,600
 In a limousine.

355
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,600
 Yeah.

356
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,600
 It was already a big lift.

357
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,600
 And it's not on it.

358
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,600
 But then you get to the lift and there's actually a plane in there

359
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,600
 and he's like, "Oh, wait for the next one."

360
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,600
 I don't know, I know.

361
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,600
 Yeah.

362
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,600
 So, yeah, this researcher says it,

363
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,600
 but it was definitely then Roosevelt definitely used it

364
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,600
 to hide his disability.

365
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,600
 They used to have first-class and third-class

366
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,600
 on a couple of London underground lights,

367
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,600
 but no second-class very weirdly.

368
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,600
 Ah, see, that's why I had to explain the zone system earlier.

369
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,600
 It was a very good example of numbers being left out.

370
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,600
 Yeah, and you would have to wait at particular bits of the platform

371
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,600
 depending on what class ticket you had.

372
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,600
 Why did they not have a second class, I wonder?

373
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:42,600
 It was because there's a stipulation in a railway regulation act

374
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,600
 in the mid-19th century,

375
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,600
 which said all train companies have to offer third-class accommodation.

376
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,600
 Oh, I see.

377
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,600
 So four people can afford it.

378
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:52,600
 And then eventually they just got rid of first-class.

379
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,600
 So now all the London underground characters are third-class, basically.

380
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,600
 Are they?

381
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,600
 Would you say that?

382
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,600
 I suppose that might be true.

383
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,600
 Yeah, it's a bit of a stretch.

384
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,600
 They definitely got rid of first-class on the lines where they had it.

385
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,600
 Do we know if they had any luxuries?

386
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,600
 Yeah, you did.

387
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,600
 You had two gas lamps instead of one.

388
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,600
 Damn!

389
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,600
 It's a bit like that from the other week

390
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,600
 where you can have two castles in first class.

391
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,600
 Yes.

392
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,600
 (LAUGHTER)

393
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,600
 Shoot me that scene.

394
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,600
 We've probably gone enough on that.

395
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,600
 I have one story about an underground man.

396
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,600
 Sure.

397
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,600
 Sure, why not?

398
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,600
 So this is a story from 1998.

399
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:33,600
 It's the report of a man who broke the record

400
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,600
 for the length of time spent in a wooden box underground.

401
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,600
 Okay.

402
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,600
 What more than dead people?

403
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,600
 No.

404
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,600
 For the living people.

405
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,600
 For the living people category.

406
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,600
 He was called Jeff Smith.

407
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,600
 He was 37 years old.

408
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,600
 And he beat the European record of 101 days.

409
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:53,600
 He stayed underground for 150 days.

410
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,600
 And the record that he broke was set by his mother.

411
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,600
 Oh, my God.

412
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,600
 How many days did she do?

413
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,600
 She did 101.

414
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,600
 And he beat her.

415
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:08,600
 And then the landlord of the pub in the garden of which

416
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,600
 he was buried underground for three months.

417
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,600
 (LAUGHTER)

418
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,600
 Said, when his mother did it, he was seven years old.

419
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,600
 He's now 37.

420
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,600
 And for the last 30 years, it's been his ambition

421
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,600
 to go and bury himself in a box.

422
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,600
 (LAUGHTER)

423
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,600
 Did he have some awful rivalry with his mother?

424
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,600
 I don't know.

425
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,600
 I think he was proud to keep the family record alive.

426
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,600
 And how do they keep him alive?

427
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,600
 He's obviously got air tubes.

428
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,600
 They probably just pull peanuts down a tube

429
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,600
 or something because he's in the pub.

430
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,600
 What do you remember?

431
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:44,600
 There was a book we have in the office

432
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,600
 from a friend of ours, John Bonderson,

433
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,600
 called Barry DeLive.

434
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,600
 And they used to make caskets for people

435
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,600
 who were petrified of being buried alive.

436
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,600
 So one, had an ability that you could ring a bell

437
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,600
 if you woke up in your casket.

438
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,600
 And while you were waiting for them to dig you out,

439
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,600
 it had a tube where they could send a sausage down.

440
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,600
 (LAUGHTER)

441
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,600
 No, so he had an air tube.

442
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,600
 And he said, through the air tube inserted in the box,

443
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,600
 "I am very pleased to have reached this day.

444
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,600
 My mother would be proud of me."

445
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,600
 If you were in that beer garden and you had a few points,

446
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,600
 you would start pouring beer down his tube.

447
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,600
 I think the beer would be the last of his worries.

448
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,600
 Going down that tube.

449
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,600
 That's a good point.

450
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,600
 Well done for not drowning.

451
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,600
 (LAUGHTER)

452
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,600
 Imagine if you were one day away from getting the record

453
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,600
 and then a massive Erbubble.

454
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:38,600
 (LAUGHTER)

455
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:48,600
 Okay, it is time for fact number two.

456
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,600
 And that is James.

457
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,600
 Okay, my fact this week is that every month,

458
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,600
 the same number of people on average,

459
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:58,600
 Google how to make love as how to make slime.

460
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,600
 Yeah.

461
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,600
 I only know one of those things.

462
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,600
 See which one?

463
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,600
 Slime.

464
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,600
 Yeah.

465
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,600
 Sometimes they could be the same thing this month.

466
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,600
 Let's try and know how to make slime.

467
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:13,600
 So this is an article on Mondovo.com,

468
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,600
 which is a digital marketing company,

469
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,600
 where they look to the 1000 most asked questions on Google

470
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,600
 and checked how much an advertiser would have to pay

471
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,600
 for someone to click on their adverts for them.

472
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,600
 So if you look at the most Google question,

473
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,600
 which is what is my IP,

474
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:34,600
 an advertiser would be 0.12 dollars per click,

475
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,600
 and when it's Valentine's Day,

476
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,600
 would be $12.33 per click.

477
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,600
 So that's what they were looking at.

478
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,600
 But really, I just want to talk about slime.

479
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:47,600
 It is weird though that I didn't realise there's this slime craze at all,

480
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,600
 and maybe that's because I'm not a young child or a parent,

481
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,600
 but there is, and there are all these stories

482
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,600
 in America of glue shortages,

483
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,600
 which people are saying are rubbish,

484
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,600
 but it is true that Wal-Mart's have had to say,

485
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,600
 look, we have run out of glue in some of our stores,

486
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,600
 and we are trying to keep up with demand as quickly as possible,

487
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,600
 because kids have just started making slime all over the place.

488
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,600
 It's amazing.

489
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,600
 And there are Instagram accounts run by teenagers,

490
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,600
 which have got hundreds of thousands of followers,

491
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,600
 and it's just them gloping slime and touching it

492
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,600
 and making the glopinises with it.

493
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,600
 And there are all these different slime accounts,

494
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,600
 and there are slime confession accounts,

495
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,600
 which apparently post drama about other slime accounts saying,

496
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,600
 so-and-so didn't invent this new kind of angel slime

497
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,600
 or crunchy slime or whatever.

498
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,600
 Wait, that doesn't sound like a confession.

499
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,600
 That sounds like slime accusation.

500
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,600
 Yeah, I get.

501
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,600
 What happens on the slime confessions?

502
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,600
 I admit I didn't make that slime.

503
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,600
 Yeah, it's just the rebuttal.

504
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,600
 No, slime confession.

505
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,600
 It's just sort of secondary accounts posted.

506
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,600
 And you get asked,

507
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,600
 because people just put their fingers in the video,

508
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,600
 touching the slime.

509
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,600
 And they get hundreds of messages from people saying,

510
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,600
 "Give us a face reveal," is what it's called.

511
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,600
 Oh, and show your face.

512
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,600
 Do you ever get the face reveal?

513
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,600
 I think people are a bit wary of showing their face,

514
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,600
 especially because they're teenagers.

515
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,600
 They say, "I don't want to show my face to 100,000 people."

516
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,600
 Just look at the slime.

517
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,600
 Really?

518
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,600
 That's almost what the majority of YouTubers are.

519
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,600
 I mean, that's the age where they are.

520
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,600
 These guys are only about the slime down.

521
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,600
 They're not there for the fame.

522
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,600
 They're not there for the slime light.

523
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,600
 Hell!

524
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,600
 Oh dear.

525
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,600
 Is it broken?

526
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,600
 We've broken the podcast.

527
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,600
 It's finally happened.

528
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,600
 Yes, incredible.

529
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,600
 That is amazing.

530
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,600
 I didn't know about that, actually.

531
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,600
 I haven't seen that in my Googling of slime.

532
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:33,600
 Yeah, for 2016, it was the top 10 how-to searches in the world

533
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,600
 were made in America, but I think it was the world.

534
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,600
 How-to and all the others are, like, how to file my taxes

535
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,600
 or how to, I don't know, whatever else.

536
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,600
 And then it's how to make slime.

537
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,600
 So they are also divided by regions.

538
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,600
 So you can find out what people are Googling how to do in various places.

539
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:50,600
 So, Sheffield wanted to know mostly how to pluck your eyebrows.

540
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,600
 People in Cardiff and Leeds wanted to know how to work out percentages.

541
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:58,600
 And in Bradford, the most common how-to search was how-to age lace.

542
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:03,600
 How-to age, that was the most common thing people wanted to know how to do.

543
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,600
 In Bradford.

544
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,600
 In Bradford, they're all about lace in Bradford.

545
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,600
 And ageing lace.

546
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,600
 What is ageing lace?

547
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,600
 I guess to make it look older than it is.

548
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,600
 Or is it telling how old it is?

549
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,600
 Oh, yeah.

550
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,600
 Oh, yeah.

551
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,600
 That does feel to me like one or two people Googling a lot, doesn't it?

552
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,600
 Yeah.

553
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,600
 Yeah.

554
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,600
 I've forgotten again.

555
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:31,600
 It's interesting, because all this slime was very much part of,

556
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,600
 I guess, more James and my childhood than YouTube.

557
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:38,600
 But the toys that we all had, or used to have them, Teenage Beauty Ninja Turtles,

558
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,600
 used to come with it because they were born out of ooze.

559
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,600
 So, used to get this little slime with it.

560
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,600
 The Ghostbusters toys, used to get...

561
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,600
 Yeah, slimer.

562
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,600
 Yes, slimer exactly.

563
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,600
 It was such a huge part of toys.

564
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,600
 I don't know if it is so much these days.

565
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,600
 That was gung vintage.

566
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,600
 Like get your own back with Dave Benson Phillips.

567
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,600
 Oh, yeah.

568
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,600
 It was always evolving out of being gunged.

569
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,600
 Wasn't it more like putty?

570
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,600
 So, the slime I remember getting was more like putty with toys.

571
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,600
 That's the farty one.

572
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,600
 That's the one that you go.

573
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,600
 When you put your finger inside.

574
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,600
 I don't think I've got the slime.

575
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,600
 That was the...

576
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,600
 Yeah, the slime was the predated...

577
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,600
 The party, did it?

578
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,600
 The party putty.

579
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,600
 Yeah, okay.

580
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,600
 One theory about why kids like slime so much,

581
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,600
 especially in the 90s and early 2000s,

582
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,600
 is because it was a time when kids stopped going outside.

583
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,600
 And when, you know, kids in the 60s and 70s would go out,

584
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,600
 they'd be messing around with bits of gung and, you know,

585
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,600
 bits of mud and all that kind of thing.

586
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,600
 And then this was a generation that didn't really play out.

587
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,600
 So, they were indoors a lot.

588
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,600
 So, they had to make do with gung.

589
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,600
 That's amazing.

590
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,600
 Yeah.

591
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,600
 Don't know if it's true, it's a theory.

592
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,600
 It's a really good theory.

593
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,600
 Yeah, like it.

594
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,600
 The first film I could find that contains the word "slime" in the title

595
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:48,600
 is a film called "The Slime People" from 1963.

596
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,600
 It was not very well received.

597
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,600
 It got 2.5 on IMDb.

598
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,600
 And apparently, according to Wikipedia,

599
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,600
 it was infamous for its extensive use of fog machines

600
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,600
 with the fog becoming so thick towards the end

601
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,600
 that it's virtually impossible to see anything out.

602
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:07,600
 It started this guy called Robert Hutton, who only got...

603
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,600
 Lots of the first half of the film started.

604
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:14,600
 Robert Hutton apparently only got work.

605
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,600
 This is going to this random book on films.

606
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,600
 He only got work because he had a startling resemblance to Jimmy Stewart.

607
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,600
 And when Jimmy Stewart was called up for World War II,

608
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:26,600
 he was just casting lots of films that Jimmy Stewart was supposed to be in.

609
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,600
 That's amazing.

610
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,600
 That's really good.

611
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,600
 That's really good.

612
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,600
 Have you guys ever seen The Blob?

613
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,600
 Yeah.

614
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:36,600
 So The Blob is one of the first ever B-movie sci-fi horror films.

615
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,600
 And it's one of Steve McQueen's first ever films as an actor.

616
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,600
 I did not know he was in The Blob.

617
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,600
 Yeah, and it's about...

618
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,600
 Basically, it's about a blob which comes down from space

619
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,600
 and it starts eating things

620
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,600
 and it just absorbs things and then gets bigger.

621
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,600
 So the producer has just died.

622
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,600
 It's kind of like a slime, basically, as The Blob.

623
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,600
 It's sort of this sentient ooze, which just...

624
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,600
 It's one of those things.

625
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,600
 Yeah. But these days, there is still blob fest every year

626
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,600
 in a town where they shot loads of it.

627
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,600
 And you can eat blob burgers.

628
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,600
 And you can pay a small fee.

629
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,600
 And you can run screaming out of the cinema

630
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,600
 that everyone runs screaming out of in the film

631
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,600
 when the blob oozes into it.

632
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,600
 What if you want to keep watching the film?

633
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,600
 You can't.

634
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,600
 Do you know that The Blob was based on a true story?

635
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,600
 No.

636
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,600
 Okay, yeah.

637
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,600
 No, it really was.

638
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,600
 Can I give you a dance move?

639
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,600
 It was a local report somewhere in America.

640
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,600
 Some weird substance had been found

641
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,600
 that was kind of jelly-like, probably natural, I guess.

642
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,600
 It probably is, like, frog sperm or something.

643
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,600
 But the FBI were brought in to investigate it.

644
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,600
 And then it was in the local news and then it got in national news

645
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,600
 and then they turned it into the story.

646
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,600
 I didn't know that.

647
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,600
 That's very cool.

648
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,600
 Did it eat people?

649
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,600
 No, no.

650
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:47,600
 I think that was a fictional adaptation.

651
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:53,600
 So in Paris, in the 19th century, they used to have fruit orchards

652
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:58,600
 and they used to use snail slime to put branding on their apples.

653
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,600
 No.

654
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,600
 Yeah.

655
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,600
 So what you would do is you'd grow an apple on a tree

656
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,600
 and put it in a paper bag.

657
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,600
 So it was very pale when it grew.

658
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,600
 And then you take the paper bag off and you get a stencil

659
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,600
 and you put snail slime in the stencil bit.

660
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,600
 And then you would let it grow a little bit longer.

661
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:17,600
 And the rest of the apple would go a nice colour,

662
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,600
 but the bit where the snail slime was wouldn't go the colour

663
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,600
 and so you could have little brands.

664
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,600
 No way!

665
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,600
 That is amazing.

666
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,600
 That is so cool.

667
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,600
 Why did we stop doing that?

668
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,600
 I don't know.

669
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,600
 We should bring it back.

670
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,600
 We should bring it back.

671
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,600
 We invented sticky labels and it's better than having an apple.

672
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,600
 But it's snail slime.

673
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,600
 We don't have to individually bag every apple on your tree.

674
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,600
 That is why we didn't do it.

675
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,600
 I just think that is incredible, though.

676
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:46,600
 Snail slime is non-uternian fluid, which we've talked about before.

677
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,600
 So it's a fluid that doesn't really act in the way you'd expect something like water to act.

678
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,600
 And the reason that's really good for snails is that when they excrete it,

679
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,600
 it helps them stick to the ground when they're staying still

680
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,600
 and root them in the ground.

681
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,600
 And then it helps them move when they want to move.

682
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,600
 Because under pressure, it becomes really lubricated and it becomes really slippery.

683
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,600
 Yeah, they use it like a hoverboard.

684
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,600
 I was thinking like a water slide.

685
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:12,600
 Yeah, that's probably better actually.

686
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,600
 But you're not hovering, are they?

687
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,600
 No, but they're not touching the earth.

688
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,600
 But neither are you if you're in shoes.

689
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,600
 These are my hover boots.

690
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:26,600
 So loads of people have started using snail slime for beauty.

691
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,600
 This is a big trend now.

692
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:32,600
 So there have been some spars which have let snails crawl over your face for a fee.

693
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,600
 You pay the fee not the snail.

694
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:39,600
 I read once at the battle of, I think it was a battle of Cressy.

695
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,600
 They use snails to crawl over the wounds of people on the battlefield

696
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,600
 because it has antibacterial stuff in it.

697
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,600
 No, what the enemy's getting closer.

698
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,600
 Come on, come on.

699
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:54,600
 Well, they have methods of getting slime out of snails now

700
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,600
 because they used to do it in quite a cruel way.

701
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,600
 They used to put them in water which had lots of salt and vinegar in

702
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,600
 and they freak out and they'd slime loads because it really hurt them.

703
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:07,600
 But now they've developed in Italian snail farms, a special steam bath.

704
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,600
 It's like a spa for snails.

705
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,600
 It's how they're pitching it.

706
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,600
 I bet that's not how it really is for the snails.

707
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,600
 It is, they're in these domes which are full of steam.

708
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,600
 And apparently they take their shell off, put it in the locker.

709
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:24,600
 Where do they keep the pound coin?

710
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:30,600
 So it's quite nice that people in spars are using slime from snails

711
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,600
 which of themselves been to a spa already.

712
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,600
 That's so nice.

713
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,600
 And then the people excrete sweat which they then give back to the snail

714
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,600
 to pop on their faces.

715
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:49,600
 Okay, it is time for fact number three.

716
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,600
 That is Chazinski.

717
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,600
 My fact this week is that old faithful Giza and Yellowstone

718
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,600
 used to be used as a washing machine.

719
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:02,600
 And this is another true fact of mine this week.

720
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:07,600
 So old faithful is this Giza in Yellowstone National Park,

721
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,600
 which is very famous because it's quite reliable when it erupts.

722
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,600
 So you can go and see it and I've seen it and it's amazing.

723
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:16,600
 And in the 1800s when people visited Yellowstone,

724
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,600
 and it was often soldiers because there were a lot of soldiers placed in the area,

725
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:26,600
 then they would chuck their soil or their dirty clothes into the crater of the Giza.

726
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,600
 And then it's very hot in there.

727
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:31,600
 So it would get all the shummi around in there and then blast it out.

728
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,600
 And it's essentially, I think it's about 90 degrees.

729
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,600
 And it erupts every 80 minutes.

730
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,600
 So it's like putting your clothes on a 90 degree cycle for 80 minutes.

731
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,600
 Yeah, and that's not suitable for woolens as well.

732
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,600
 90 degrees is too hot.

733
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,600
 They did see.

734
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,600
 All of the travellers said that you had to not put your woolen clothes in there

735
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,600
 because they would actually get shredded up a little bit.

736
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:56,600
 Yeah, they were completely torn to shreds.

737
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:00,600
 Yes, because it stinks of raw sulfuric rotten eggs all over the shop.

738
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:05,600
 And someone did acknowledge that it wasn't that good away at cleaning clothes.

739
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:10,600
 So there was one book I was reading about the history of Yellowstone said,

740
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,600
 many articles that go into her chambers never came out again.

741
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,600
 So Giza laundering was often seen as an enterprise, both futile and costly.

742
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,600
 Wow.

743
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:21,600
 And they would, I mean, I've been the seat to see that as well.

744
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,600
 But really, an explosion, isn't it?

745
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,600
 So they would have gone flying.

746
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,600
 Yeah.

747
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,600
 I would do it, definitely, but with some old t-shirts and things like that.

748
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,600
 Well, you shouldn't do it.

749
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,600
 It's very clear.

750
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,600
 You shouldn't put things in the Giza's in Yellowstone.

751
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,600
 Really?

752
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,600
 They make it very, very clear.

753
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,600
 I've never been.

754
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,600
 So I think I'm clear.

755
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,600
 I think I'm allowed to do it.

756
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,600
 No one's told me not to yet.

757
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,600
 But when you go, because you have to stay on the wattboards, don't you?

758
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,600
 Yeah.

759
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:48,600
 And then you'll see just like a hat here and a shoe here that have just either blown over or...

760
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,600
 Oh, really?

761
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,600
 Are there people trying to emulate this, though?

762
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,600
 I don't think so.

763
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,600
 Oh, is it left over?

764
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,600
 Because stuff used to get sucked down and disappear.

765
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,600
 So it might be 150-year-old shoes left over from these socks.

766
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,600
 It might be.

767
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,600
 They mostly look like baseball caps from the current era.

768
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,600
 Okay.

769
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,600
 This is an amazing fact.

770
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,600
 It's incredible.

771
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:11,600
 You could wash the dishes by dropping them into like Mount Etner or something.

772
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,600
 And it'll shimmy them around and then explain them out.

773
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,600
 Well, they try to wash dishes in Giza's as well.

774
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,600
 Do they?

775
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,600
 Everything with them.

776
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,600
 It's truly bizarre.

777
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:23,600
 Surely you would know that they would smash on being blasted out.

778
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,600
 Well, for instance, you would get some Giza's which are just like a puddle of water,

779
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,600
 which it's just kind of bubbling.

780
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,600
 Wouldn't necessarily be firing out massive amounts.

781
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,600
 Okay.

782
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,600
 Yeah, was it specifically old faithful?

783
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,600
 No, lots of Giza's, they did this in.

784
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,600
 So there was one Giza that was called the handkerchief Giza,

785
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,600
 because you'd chuck your handkerchiefs in.

786
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,600
 Right.

787
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,600
 And people used to chuck in soap just to make them explode, I think.

788
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,600
 Did they?

789
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,600
 I think that would prompt them to explode.

790
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,600
 Yes, it does.

791
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,600
 It gets between the molecules in some way and court actually causes Giza's to explode.

792
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,600
 It's mad.

793
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,600
 That's amazing.

794
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,600
 Yeah.

795
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,600
 It's really odd.

796
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,600
 I was reading about the fact that they have discovered that Yellowstone.

797
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,600
 This is quite a while ago.

798
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,600
 Yellowstone is actually what is classified as a super volcano.

799
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:06,600
 Because the whole thing effectively is one massive volcano.

800
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:11,600
 It's very scary because the last time it went off, it produced so much ash

801
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:18,600
 that you could have covered New York State in, I think it was 20 meters of ash.

802
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:22,600
 And I'm not sure if they've actually verified this, but I think this is the main theory.

803
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,600
 There's the Gallatin Mountains.

804
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:30,600
 And suddenly in between the mountain range is a 60 mile to 70 mile gap of mountain.

805
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,600
 It's just missing.

806
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,600
 It's not there.

807
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,600
 And they think it was from the explosion.

808
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,600
 Wow.

809
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,600
 It just wiped out 60 miles of mountain range.

810
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,600
 So do you reckon that mountain kind of flew up somewhere and landed somewhere else?

811
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,600
 Yes.

812
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:47,600
 Do you know what happens when lava explodes out of a volcano?

813
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,600
 If a die.

814
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:53,600
 Does it go up and then cool down and then fall down like promise kind of stuff or?

815
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:59,600
 Kind of, but some of it, a third of the liquid rock, falls back into the volcano.

816
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:03,600
 It just goes in just straight up and back down again.

817
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,600
 Wow.

818
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,600
 Can I just read you really quickly one last anecdote?

819
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,600
 Obviously the only research I did for this was people putting stuff in geysers for fun.

820
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,600
 Yeah.

821
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,600
 So just one last anecdote, which I really enjoyed.

822
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:17,600
 And this was from a guy called Norton, who was a travel writer.

823
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,600
 He was one of the first people to write about visiting Yellowstone National Park.

824
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:26,600
 And he went with Rich Companion, who he nicknamed Prince Telegraph, because he owned all these Telegraph lines.

825
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,600
 And he was obviously some posh tof.

826
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:34,600
 And so Norton recorded that Prince Telegraph couldn't be bothered to wash up the crockery on the day that it was his turn.

827
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:42,600
 So he dumped it in a small shallow looking geyser and smoked a pipe by the side of the geyser in the hope that it would wash the crockery.

828
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:46,600
 And the geyser suddenly started spitting and like whirling all the contents of the crockery around.

829
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:50,600
 And they, so the rest of the group hadn't realised that Prince Telegraph had done this.

830
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,600
 They just heard this shout from him.

831
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,600
 And they turned around and saw him.

832
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,600
 He was making an agonizing cry for help.

833
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:02,600
 They beheld him with his hat off an eyes peeled, dancing around his dishpan and a frantic attempt to save the culinary outfit.

834
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:09,600
 He would plunge his hand into the boiling water, yell with pain and out would come a spoon, another plunge and yell and a tin plate.

835
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:13,600
 And apparently he just kept on throwing his head down into this water and scrambling around.

836
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,600
 And all their crockery got sucked into the geyser.

837
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,600
 You've got to let it go mate.

838
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,600
 Yeah.

839
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,600
 I would say a spoon is not worth it for losing your hands.

840
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:24,600
 Also, if it was a porcelain plate, maybe, but a tin plate, you're going from hot to hot to hot.

841
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,600
 Oh, yeah.

842
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,600
 Yeah, but he's taken all their crockery.

843
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,600
 What if they're stuck in Yellowstone without anything to eat off?

844
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,600
 Yeah.

845
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,600
 I guess they'll have to have finger food from then on.

846
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:38,600
 And it does have a trout jacuzzi.

847
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,600
 Is this like your sauna for snails?

848
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,600
 Yeah.

849
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:47,600
 And the is starting up a whole spa for different animals on you.

850
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,600
 You've got the weight room for a camel.

851
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,600
 Does it have different settings?

852
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,600
 Like, can they turn on the bubble?

853
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,600
 What it is is that sometimes there are little eruptions.

854
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:06,600
 In this trout jacuzzi, which stir up lots of crustaceans and other little insects that trout like to eat.

855
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:11,600
 And so the trout know that this is happening and they swim around whenever there's a little upburst of liquid.

856
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,600
 So it's like having a jacuzzi.

857
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,600
 Well, like sausages.

858
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:19,600
 Which would be the best jacuzzi in the world ever.

859
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:30,600
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show and that is Andy.

860
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:37,600
 My fact is that there are three world's largest porch swings in Nebraska, Louisiana and Ontario.

861
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,600
 And none of them is on a porch.

862
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:46,600
 This is the fact that it was sent in actually sent in by a guy called Jeremy Michael Voss on Twitter.

863
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:50,600
 And there are lots of porch swings, which are supposed to be the world's largest.

864
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:53,600
 And you can see them all and they're nowhere near a porch.

865
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,600
 Surely we've measured them.

866
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,600
 Yeah, I was going to say the same.

867
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,600
 Surely we know from all those pictures, which is the biggest.

868
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,600
 Not quite, but they're sort of all similar size.

869
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,600
 They're all identical inside.

870
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,600
 Very weird that someone wouldn't...

871
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:12,600
 It could be that one's the tallest, one's the widest and one's the whatever, the other...

872
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:19,600
 Could be that no one could be asked to measure them, because they're just big porch swings.

873
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,600
 Professional measures are better things to do.

874
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:25,600
 I don't actually know which of them is the largest, but there are all these sort of world's largest things all over the place.

875
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,600
 And there are lots of conflicts between people aren't there.

876
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,600
 So how large are they?

877
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,600
 And I don't mean the exact measurements.

878
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:36,600
 I mean, if I was sitting on one, is it like when you go to those places where they have big chairs and big tables and you're meant to look like a...

879
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,600
 Which places are these then?

880
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:42,600
 You can go to places that make you feel like one of the borrowers where they have just giant furniture.

881
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,600
 Can you?

882
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,600
 Yeah.

883
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:47,600
 Dan is looking at me, like there's one of these places on every corner.

884
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:50,600
 It's weird that I've never been to one.

885
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,600
 So what do you mean?

886
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:56,600
 The world's largest chair is a really epic battle between lots of different places.

887
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:59,600
 It started in 1905.

888
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,600
 I strapped yourselves in.

889
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,600
 This is kind of a long anecdote.

890
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:08,600
 So it started in 1905 and Gardner, Massachusetts erected a 12 foot tall chair.

891
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:14,600
 And then a place called Thomasville North Carolina made one that was 13 feet six inches.

892
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:18,600
 And then those two places just got more and more bigger and bigger chairs.

893
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:22,600
 Eventually there was an 18 foot chair in Thomasville.

894
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,600
 But then the war happened.

895
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:31,600
 And then after the war, there were various largest chairs in Bennington, Vermont, Washington, D.C.,

896
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:37,600
 Boris Town, Tennessee, Binghampton, New York, Wingdale, New York, Aniston, Alabama.

897
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:43,600
 Aniston, Alabama had the biggest chair until 2001 when it was destroyed by a storm.

898
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:47,600
 So all these other towns in America had all the biggest chair at various times.

899
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:50,600
 But now the world's biggest chair is in Italy.

900
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,600
 And it's 65 feet tall.

901
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,600
 65 feet.

902
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,600
 Wow.

903
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:59,600
 And it could be even bigger if it wasn't for that dastardly war that interrupted them.

904
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:04,600
 That's the most that anyone's ever glossed over the second world war.

905
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:09,600
 He was telling the biggest story.

906
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,600
 Is that the one that's in Italy?

907
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,600
 Is that a place called Manzano?

908
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,600
 Yes, that's right.

909
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,600
 There's a fact about it, which is, I can't believe this.

910
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:21,600
 Is that a third of the world's chairs are manufactured there.

911
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:26,600
 They might do, though, because some, like in China, where there's Sock City and there's, like,

912
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:30,600
 there's some villages and towns that just decide that's what we do.

913
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,600
 Everything here is chair-based or Sock City.

914
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:35,600
 Yeah, but if you think about how many chairs there must be in the world,

915
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,600
 everyone in the world on average is going to welcome at least a chair, aren't they?

916
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:44,600
 Yeah, but I think like how many chairs are you sitting on right now?

917
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,600
 What?

918
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,600
 What, yeah?

919
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,600
 How many socks are you wearing?

920
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,600
 Well, yeah, I do see your point.

921
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,600
 Yeah.

922
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:55,600
 But there are, is it three?

923
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,600
 No, I do see that point.

924
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:01,600
 But like around this table, there's more than what two chairs per person.

925
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,600
 Yeah, that's true.

926
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:06,600
 And also, there's too much variety in chairs for them all to be coming from the same factory

927
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,600
 or a Sock sort of the same, aren't they?

928
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,600
 Yeah, I don't think it can be.

929
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,600
 Socks aren't all the same.

930
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:15,600
 I mean, not even the two that I'm wearing at the same time.

931
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,600
 So there is a thing in America.

932
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:22,600
 A lot of these are roadside attractions where they would try and get people into your town or whatever.

933
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:25,600
 So there are a few world largest balls of twine.

934
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,600
 Oh, yeah.

935
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,600
 There's a huge thing.

936
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:30,600
 On Wikipedia, there's one entry about the world largest ball of twine.

937
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,600
 And this is what it says.

938
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:36,600
 It says, "The world's largest ball of twine in Corker City was built as a response to the

939
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:40,600
 Minnesota town of Darwin's efforts to grab the title.

940
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:43,600
 That reads very much like someone from Corker City."

941
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,600
 And it's unhappy with Darwin.

942
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,600
 And they're usually the ball of twine.

943
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,600
 Is it usually just one person really, isn't it?

944
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:54,600
 It's kind of just like over years and years and years just making these balls of twine.

945
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,600
 It thinks so.

946
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,600
 Weirdly pointless.

947
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,600
 What a great life, that would be.

948
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,600
 Everything we do is a little bit pointless, isn't it?

949
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,600
 I think this is a little pointless.

950
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,600
 We're all going to die in the end, aren't they?

951
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:08,600
 I know, but I'm not sure I want to continue doing this on campus.

952
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,600
 But this is always the thing.

953
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:13,600
 The thing I find very odd with a lot of these, like the world's largest chair.

954
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,600
 It's not a chair.

955
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,600
 It's a model of a chair.

956
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,600
 No, but it's still a chair.

957
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,600
 You can sit on it.

958
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,100
 Yeah.

959
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,600
 What about the world's largest banana, which is a model of a banana?

960
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,600
 No, no, because that the world's largest banana.

961
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:27,600
 No, no, no, that's different because you'd have to make the inside of a banana out of banana.

962
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,600
 I see.

963
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,600
 I think I see the distinction you're drawing and I think it's fair.

964
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,600
 Thank you.

965
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,600
 Oh, I was coming around to you all the way.

966
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,600
 No, no.

967
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,600
 So this guy's made the world's largest knitting needles, he claims.

968
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:38,600
 They're 13 feet long and I actually don't think they are knitting needles.

969
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,600
 Wait, but what disqualify, what disqualify is it?

970
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,600
 Because you can't knit with them.

971
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,600
 I don't either use of the thing for the thing.

972
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,600
 I bet he has done some knitting with it.

973
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,600
 The world's largest judgment.

974
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,600
 Yeah, the world's largest.

975
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:54,600
 In the knitting needle one, I often see these things because we spend a lot of time on the internet.

976
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:59,600
 But I have often seen world's most largest functional knitting needle as a actual record.

977
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,600
 Right.

978
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,600
 That's interesting.

979
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,600
 Okay.

980
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,600
 Now I'm intrigued.

981
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:07,600
 It's so weird how niche our knowledge is that I mentioned the world's largest knitting needle.

982
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:13,600
 James is often covered across the world's largest functional line.

983
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,600
 What are our lives?

984
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,600
 They're just pointless.

985
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,600
 Escapedes to the death.

986
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,600
 We've reached.

987
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,600
 We've reached.

988
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:27,600
 Marching towards oblivion with our giant missing needle.

989
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,600
 Australia has a load of these things.

990
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:32,600
 There's an incredible Wikipedia page about the big things of Australia.

991
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,600
 Okay.

992
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,600
 It's what they're called.

993
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:37,600
 And they're about 150.

994
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:40,600
 What's the famous as a big pineapple, I think?

995
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,600
 Yeah, they've got the world's largest artificial prawn.

996
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:46,600
 World's largest artificial trout, artificial banana, artificial eagle.

997
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,600
 That's weird.

998
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:51,600
 I thought I'd been to the world's largest artificial prawn.

999
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,600
 But it wasn't.

1000
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,600
 I've never been to Australia.

1001
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,600
 It was.

1002
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,600
 I thought it was in.

1003
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,600
 Maybe it's a touring prawn.

1004
00:39:56,600 --> 00:40:00,600
 It's pretty big, James.

1005
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:05,600
 It could probably have made it, of course, in the time since you've seen it.

1006
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:08,600
 I thought it was imploring the keys, but I'm.

1007
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,600
 And they're the coast.

1008
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,600
 I think about it.

1009
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,600
 It might have been a crayfish.

1010
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,600
 It's so embarrassing.

1011
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,600
 There's one of these things done.

1012
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,600
 There's one thing.

1013
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,600
 It's called the big A is rock, right?

1014
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:23,600
 And it's a one to 40 scale model of A is rock.

1015
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,600
 Which way is the scale?

1016
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,600
 It's smaller.

1017
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,600
 Oh, right.

1018
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:35,600
 So Wikipedia points out it's technically not a big thing, as it is substantially smaller than the idea that it's modeled on.

1019
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,600
 Can I bring it back to swings quickly?

1020
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,600
 Yeah.

1021
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:46,600
 It was a very big year last year for the swing 2016, because the swing was inducted into the toy Hall of Fame.

1022
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,600
 Oh, awesome.

1023
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,600
 Yeah.

1024
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,600
 They inducted a few things in one go.

1025
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:52,600
 So the little peoples, I don't know if you know that.

1026
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,600
 It's a type of toy.

1027
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,600
 It's made by Fisher Price.

1028
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:59,600
 That was inducted Dungeons and Dragons was inducted.

1029
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:06,600
 The little people, they've tied for the most nominations because there's a big final round and then they pick three.

1030
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:12,600
 So the magic eight ball ties with the little people for the most nominations of something that's not made it into the ball.

1031
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,600
 So the magic eight ball is still isn't in there.

1032
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,600
 Still not in there.

1033
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,600
 Yeah.

1034
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:20,600
 And then when you shake it, it goes not looking good.

1035
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,600
 So the swing was up against this year.

1036
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:25,600
 This is who it had to beat to get into the Hall of Fame.

1037
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:28,600
 It was up against Uno, the car game.

1038
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,600
 Oh, yeah.

1039
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,600
 It was up against Care Bears.

1040
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:36,600
 It was up against Rockham Sockham Robots.

1041
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,600
 I don't know if you remember that.

1042
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,600
 Transformers.

1043
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,600
 Coloring books.

1044
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,600
 Oh, they're an adult thing really these days.

1045
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,600
 Yeah, that might have disqualified it.

1046
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,600
 And bubble wrap.

1047
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:46,600
 So it managed to defeat bubble wrap.

1048
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:49,600
 Bubble wrap is not a tie, I wouldn't say.

1049
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:50,600
 Well, it's in the past.

1050
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:53,600
 They have put the stick into the toy Hall of Fame, haven't they?

1051
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,600
 Yes.

1052
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:57,600
 No, that was the, that got awarded the oldest toy.

1053
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,600
 All the lifetime achievement award.

1054
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,600
 It was something like that, yeah.

1055
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:04,600
 But yeah, so the swing has finally made it in.

1056
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,600
 Have you guys heard of Keaking?

1057
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,600
 What is Keaking?

1058
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,600
 It's competitive swinging in Estonia.

1059
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,600
 And it's a really big deal.

1060
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,600
 And it's the coolest thing ever.

1061
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:13,600
 I could barely watch it.

1062
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:16,600
 So it's swinging, but all the way over.

1063
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,600
 But the solid swings, aren't they?

1064
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:19,600
 They're solid, yeah.

1065
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,600
 So they're on poles.

1066
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:24,600
 But the challenge is to have as long a pole as possible on your swing.

1067
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:27,600
 So the, the, instead of rope coming down,

1068
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:30,600
 they're like big knitting needles.

1069
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,600
 I understand now.

1070
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,600
 But it's terrifying, right?

1071
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:37,600
 Because as you swing up, that your feet are strapped onto the swing.

1072
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:41,600
 But as you swing up to the point where you're almost going over the top,

1073
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:45,600
 you just, as you can imagine, you hang upside down there just before you fall back.

1074
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,600
 Oh, yes, those, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1075
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:48,600
 And they're ridiculously high.

1076
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:53,600
 So the, the world record at the moment is a sort of knitting needle of 7.03 meters.

1077
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:59,600
 So that means that you'll be hanging upside down 14 meters high, which is about five stories high.

1078
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:00,600
 Yeah.

1079
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:03,600
 That is, you can almost get up to the world's tallest chair from up there.

1080
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:04,600
 Yes.

1081
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:10,600
 So there's some orangutans in the Netherlands in the Uwenhans,

1082
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:14,600
 Deer and Park Rinan, which have obviously pronounced wrong, which is a zoo.

1083
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:17,600
 And they've forgotten how to swing in trees.

1084
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:20,600
 Because they're, they just didn't have any trees in where they're living.

1085
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,600
 So they've forgotten how to do it.

1086
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,600
 But then they got them some trees.

1087
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:26,600
 And they were like, great, we got some trees.

1088
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:29,600
 But now the orangutans didn't know how to swing in them.

1089
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:35,600
 So they hired an Olympic gymnast to swing in the trees.

1090
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:38,600
 And to try and like show them what to do.

1091
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:39,600
 That is incredible.

1092
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:42,600
 The idea is to encourage them into doing that.

1093
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:45,600
 It's not exercise. Like, why do they want them to do it?

1094
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:47,600
 Well, yeah, because that's what orangutans do.

1095
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,600
 And what you want from a zoo, isn't it?

1096
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,600
 When you see an orangutan, you want it to be swinging.

1097
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:52,600
 Or trees.

1098
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,600
 Does this woman dress up?

1099
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:55,600
 Is it a woman or a man?

1100
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:56,600
 It was a guy.

1101
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,600
 Does he dress up as an orangutan?

1102
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,600
 I don't think he does now.

1103
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,600
 But you, that would make sense, wouldn't it?

1104
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:07,600
 I really hope they come back in a few months and the orangutans are all landing, you know, perfectly in the nose.

1105
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:17,600
 Okay, that is it. That is all of our facts.

1106
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,600
