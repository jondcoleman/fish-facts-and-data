1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,680
 - Hi guys, just before we start the show,

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,000
 here is a warning, we have a special guest on today.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,440
 - Yes, very exciting guest, a author, a published author.

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,960
 - A published author, I can't believe we've pinned her down.

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,280
 But one of the ways we haven't pinned her down

7
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,080
 is that she works in the office with us.

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,120
 It's Ann Miller, you will have heard her before.

9
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,920
 - That's right, Ann Miller has just released

10
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,920
 her debut children's book, it's so good.

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,880
 It's called Mickey and the Animal Spies,

12
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,720
 and it is the story of a young girl

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,760
 who gets recruited into a secret organization called Cobra.

14
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,280
 But it is not manned by humans, but by animals.

15
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,760
 - That's right, I realized I'm not a child,

16
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,480
 but I have actually read it and I genuinely loved it.

17
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,920
 It's like a fantasy book that you wish you'd had

18
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,200
 if you were sort of 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 34.

19
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,600
 - I'm not a child either, however,

20
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,840
 I do have the reading level of a seven year old,

21
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,640
 and I have to say I think any kid who gets this book

22
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,200
 will be fascinated, they'll know more's code at the end of it,

23
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,760
 and they will just want more,

24
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,680
 and they're gonna get more because it's part of a trilogy.

25
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,560
 - It is, yes, and it does have code scattered throughout it.

26
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,320
 So it's almost at a mini-activity book,

27
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,160
 and yeah, it features some cracking animals,

28
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,440
 it gets cats in it, there's rats,

29
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,400
 there's complex characters who maybe you don't love at first,

30
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,040
 but you grow very fond of.

31
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,840
 There is a Cobra, 'cause it's very funny pun

32
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,160
 on the real life Cobra organization,

33
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,600
 and then Cobra the snake.

34
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,640
 It's a brilliant book, go get it.

35
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,680
 And to get it, you should go on the internet,

36
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,000
 where you can buy books,

37
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,560
 or you should go to a bookshop where you can also buy books,

38
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,320
 and just ask for Mickey and the Animal Spies.

39
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,480
 - By Anne Miller, who joins us on today's show,

40
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,760
 so let's get to it, on with the episode.

41
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,340
 (upbeat music)

42
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:45,000
 (upbeat music)

43
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:57,660
 - Hello, and welcome to another episode

44
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,300
 of "No Such Thing as a Fish",

45
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,980
 a weekly podcast coming to you

46
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:03,740
 from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

47
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:06,140
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here

48
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:09,820
 with Anna Chazinski, Andrew Hunter Murray, and Anne Miller,

49
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:12,180
 and once again, we have gathered around the microphones

50
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,180
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

51
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,780
 and in no particular order, here we go.

52
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,220
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Anne.

53
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:26,280
 - My fact is that even the dust at GCHQ is classified.

54
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,020
 (laughing)

55
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,540
 - So what does this mean?

56
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:32,620
 - So I went to a great exhibition on at the Science Museum,

57
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,340
 which is 100 years of GCHQ,

58
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,860
 and they've got things that they've never been seen before.

59
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:38,500
 And one of the facts I found there is that

60
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,540
 when they have things need to be taken out of service,

61
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,220
 and machines, paperwork, things like that,

62
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:44,380
 it gets ground down to become electronic waste,

63
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,020
 and it's dust, but it's certified,

64
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,260
 so I can't just go in the bin,

65
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:49,900
 because it's so, so, so secret what they've ground up,

66
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,140
 even the ground up stuff is secret.

67
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,220
 (laughing)

68
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,340
 - So they dispose of it really securely somewhere, do they?

69
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,020
 - They do not discuss how they dispose of it.

70
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:57,860
 (laughing)

71
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,780
 - Can you imagine being a double agent

72
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,220
 and going to the Russians and go,

73
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:03,580
 "I've got my hands on, it's classified."

74
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,420
 - It does.

75
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,180
 - Yeah, and you show them the dust.

76
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,420
 I don't think they'd be happy.

77
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,740
 I don't think they'd consider it classified.

78
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:11,140
 - Well, they might, because another thing I found

79
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:14,260
 at the museum was these things called microdots.

80
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,620
 So this is very tiny coded messages,

81
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:17,740
 so it would look like it's like a little

82
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,060
 very small polka dot print,

83
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:21,020
 and when you bring out a lens, it will magnify it,

84
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:23,500
 and you can read like I saw Anna on the bridge

85
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,620
 at two o'clock, the meter five or something.

86
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,940
 So the dust, they get very, very small,

87
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:30,100
 and they're still very, very secret, so everything is.

88
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,700
 - If you're wearing a polka dot dress, for example,

89
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:35,180
 and you know that one of the dots is the microdot,

90
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:37,380
 you have to remember really carefully which one it is.

91
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,620
 - The best place to hide something is

92
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:40,820
 where lots of things look the same.

93
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:41,660
 - Yeah.

94
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:42,820
 - Sounds like a great exhibition.

95
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:46,460
 - We've got dust, we've got tiny dots you can't read.

96
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:49,060
 - I've got tons of machines as well.

97
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,500
 - I just like the idea, is it like the hardest jigsaw

98
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,620
 you've ever done piecing the dust back together?

99
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,580
 Do you think you collect the dust,

100
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:58,100
 spew it on the floor, and then have to put it back in order?

101
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:01,980
 - I suspect that you can't repeat the dust now,

102
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,260
 but maybe you could one day.

103
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:06,740
 - So the worst Ikea assembling, isn't it?

104
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:10,140
 - We've got you a computer, it is a dust war.

105
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:14,540
 - So this is not the first time that this kind of rubbish

106
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:16,580
 has been useful in espionage.

107
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:20,020
 So during the Cold War, there was an operation called Tamarisk,

108
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:21,300
 if you guys heard of this.

109
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,300
 So the USA and the UK and France,

110
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:27,140
 they all had military liaisons in East Germany,

111
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:29,300
 and the Soviets were allowed some in West Germany.

112
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,380
 So it was supposed to be a way of lowering tensions

113
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:34,180
 by having a bit of representation on either side,

114
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:36,660
 but basically it just turned into legalized espionage

115
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,340
 'cause obviously people sent spies to do that,

116
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,740
 to work in those missions.

117
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,740
 And the Western officers launched this operation

118
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:46,060
 where they would gather up paper from Soviet bins,

119
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:49,140
 and sometimes they had to gather up used toilet paper

120
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,500
 because a lot of people would not give

121
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,820
 a toilet paper in the Soviet mission,

122
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,300
 or on the Soviet side.

123
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:59,820
 So they would use confidential paper as toilet paper,

124
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,780
 and then the Western spies had to go through

125
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:05,700
 gathering pooey paper from bins basically,

126
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:08,060
 which had classified information on it.

127
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:08,900
 - That's useful though,

128
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,180
 'cause you can also report back on their diets.

129
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,020
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

130
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,460
 - You can call the information you possibly want.

131
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,300
 - Yeah.

132
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,740
 - Yeah, and it was one of the most successful operations

133
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:19,620
 of the whole Cold War was gathering information

134
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,220
 from pooey bins.

135
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,460
 (laughing)

136
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:23,660
 - But I think part of the thing is you don't,

137
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,740
 like there's so much work in, you know,

138
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,660
 making things secret, but there's other things you give away

139
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,580
 just by your choice of toilet paper, or your dust,

140
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,420
 and you've got to be--

141
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,260
 - Really?

142
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:34,140
 - Yeah, they all like scented toilet paper.

143
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,260
 They must have, you know,

144
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,100
 scented tastes.

145
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,420
 (laughing)

146
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:39,700
 Is that a useful thing to know?

147
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,540
 - Sure.

148
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,100
 - It's just what shops you might find, then.

149
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,540
 (laughing)

150
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:46,660
 - Did you know that GCHQ was not recognized officially

151
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:47,980
 until 1994?

152
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:48,820
 - Yeah.

153
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,660
 - So it was bizarre, GCHQ and MI5,

154
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,980
 until there was, like, an official acknowledgement,

155
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,700
 there was a parliamentary act, which basically said,

156
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:55,860
 what its role should be.

157
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,420
 Basically, all anyone knew was from me

158
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,660
 in Fleming and John LeCarrie.

159
00:05:58,660 --> 00:05:59,500
 - Yeah.

160
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,940
 And whenever a bone film comes out,

161
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:03,580
 recruitment applications peak at GCHQ.

162
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,020
 - Yeah, that might say, 'cause everyone's like,

163
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,220
 "Oh, give that a go."

164
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,700
 - Even though they said that James Bond

165
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,020
 wouldn't get a job there, haven't they?

166
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:09,860
 - Yeah, why?

167
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,460
 - 'Cause reading alcoholic.

168
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,660
 - And also not emotionally intelligent.

169
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:14,580
 - Oh.

170
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:15,820
 - Which is fair enough.

171
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:16,820
 - So I was reading an article,

172
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,420
 which was like an inside GCHQ,

173
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,660
 which I love this stuff.

174
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:20,860
 - There's not that much in them

175
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,380
 because they can't tell you that much.

176
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,820
 But the article was in the FT,

177
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:26,220
 and it interviewed the head of GCHQ,

178
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,060
 who's called Jeremy Fleming,

179
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:30,180
 as an Ian Fleming,

180
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,860
 and the article was written

181
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:35,180
 by the FT security editor, David Bond.

182
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,180
 - Oh God.

183
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,020
 - Oh God.

184
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:40,460
 - What is the argument to terminism to the mat?

185
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:45,300
 - Do you know that the head of IT at GCHQ is AI?

186
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,140
 - What?

187
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,540
 - Okay, that's not true, it turns out.

188
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,660
 I met Red the article.

189
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,740
 It's a guy called Al, but it looks like AI,

190
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:51,580
 when you read it.

191
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:52,660
 - I'll run by a robot.

192
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,940
 - But what's interesting about him is he's dyslexic.

193
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,620
 He's the head of IT, and he's dyslexic.

194
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,020
 And I was reading this in an article.

195
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,660
 - His name is actually LA, isn't it?

196
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,900
 (laughing)

197
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,580
 - So this is an article.

198
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:03,900
 - Written in the Times,

199
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,780
 a journalist was allowed into GCHQ to do this article,

200
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:09,180
 and it was very funny because they had,

201
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,180
 as the journalist went in,

202
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,540
 all these A4 bits of paper,

203
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,740
 blue tack to walls, saying caution,

204
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,260
 journalist interview,

205
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,580
 keep all conversations too official.

206
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,580
 (laughing)

207
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,100
 And everywhere this journalist went,

208
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:20,940
 that's where they saw.

209
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,140
 But they were doing an article about

210
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,620
 the neurodiversity program at GCHQ.

211
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,460
 So there are 300 men and women there

212
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:30,220
 who all have dyslexia or autism or aspergers,

213
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:32,180
 and face blindness, for example.

214
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,460
 So there's one lady who works there,

215
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:36,340
 who's a former chemist called Jill,

216
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:38,820
 and she's their intelligence analysis.

217
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:41,340
 She can do that, and she's ahead of it.

218
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:44,220
 But she struggles to recognize her employer's face

219
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,020
 who she's worked with for eight years,

220
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,460
 because of the face blindness disease that she has.

221
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,500
 So it's an extraordinary article

222
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,900
 about the people that they hire there.

223
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:52,900
 - I read one as well.

224
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,260
 And they said, "I don't listen for the day,"

225
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:56,540
 and like Dan was going to be careful what they say,

226
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,740
 and someone was told that he was allowed to go

227
00:07:58,740 --> 00:07:59,860
 around the building, and that was fine.

228
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,260
 He's allowed to go in for like six days,

229
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,740
 but he wasn't allowed to go into the canteen

230
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,740
 where people may be discussing things informally.

231
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:05,740
 (laughing)

232
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:08,260
 - Yes, but the fire in his vine for the canteen.

233
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:10,180
 - Just start him out, basically, eventually.

234
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,020
 - No, yeah.

235
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:13,220
 - And that's part of the thing with the baristas, isn't it?

236
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,060
 - Oh yeah.

237
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,900
 - Like they have a Costa coffee, and they're the coffee shop

238
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,420
 in GCHQ as well, and they have to go

239
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,780
 under a regular spy training.

240
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,620
 'Cause it's not like a regular.

241
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,100
 You can't just, like, - Yeah, that's really funny.

242
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,500
 - You've got different levels of security.

243
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,340
 You need to be able to pass.

244
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,300
 - You can write 007 on the side of the cup,

245
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,780
 and so is that 001?

246
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,940
 - Completely different age and person's hand up.

247
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,900
 I just blown two agents cover right there.

248
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:32,900
 (laughing)

249
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,460
 - They did have a building in London,

250
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:38,980
 which they ran for 66 years and never acknowledged

251
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,180
 until they just left.

252
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:43,460
 They left the last year, and it was apparently intentionally

253
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,060
 boring, you know, it was designed to look

254
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,300
 just like a really drab office block.

255
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,260
 This and James' Park actually is where it is.

256
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,660
 Anyway, they moved out in 2019, and then they said,

257
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,700
 "Ah, it was GCHQ, all along."

258
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,820
 But the BBC, the BBC sent some reporters

259
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,380
 to ask people in the area,

260
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,380
 "What do you think that building was?"

261
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:01,340
 And they said, "Oh, it's the spies, isn't it?"

262
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,180
 (laughing)

263
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,180
 "Am I sick, secret service?"

264
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,020
 "It's something they're all spies, anyway."

265
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:05,900
 - Every day, they were going in,

266
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,660
 like, with their trench coats on, and they're

267
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,500
 (laughing)

268
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,340
 - So that lasted.

269
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,260
 - Magnifying glass.

270
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,780
 (laughing)

271
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:15,420
 - You're having your book launch in a spy building.

272
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,540
 - In the original GCHQ building.

273
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:20,300
 - Yeah, so I've been, when I walk on my lunch break,

274
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,980
 I walk past this building, and you sort of look around

275
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,660
 at the plaques, and we're looking for facts,

276
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,340
 and there was a plaque on the wall that said,

277
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,140
 it was the original home of GCHQ.

278
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,740
 They only unveiled the plaque, I think, last year.

279
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,940
 The clique of Queen came to unveil it for the centenary,

280
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:31,780
 and here's the best bit.

281
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,060
 They're hidden messages on the plaque,

282
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,060
 because it's the GCHQ.

283
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:34,900
 - Oh!

284
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:35,740
 - Like, no one.

285
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:36,580
 - Yes.

286
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:37,740
 - What was so great?

287
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:38,580
 - I don't know.

288
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,140
 - Oh, they've just told you there's a hidden message,

289
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,380
 but can we go and find it?

290
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,380
 - We need to go and find it.

291
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,540
 I actually don't know what it is.

292
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,020
 I've been walking past that plaque many times,

293
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,180
 I never thought to look for a code,

294
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,460
 and now I'm trying to go a lunch break.

295
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,620
 - Yeah, I think we should.

296
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,460
 - I love the fact that you say,

297
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,740
 you wander around looking at plaques,

298
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:51,580
 looking at your eye facts,

299
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:53,140
 we're never off the clock here.

300
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,300
 - Oh, it's a bunch of things.

301
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,780
 The overnight lunch break clear my head.

302
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:56,620
 Oh.

303
00:09:56,620 --> 00:10:00,220
 - We're gonna have to move on in a sec to my next fact.

304
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,220
 - Just about the actual recruitment process,

305
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,060
 and what it takes.

306
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,220
 It's quite fun to read about.

307
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,900
 So the initial interview that you get for GCHQ

308
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,260
 is designed to test your knowledge of technical subjects,

309
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:10,900
 such as how a smartphone works.

310
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,700
 So I wouldn't pass that phase, but many do.

311
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:16,780
 And then you get this interrogation about your private life,

312
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:18,380
 and often you just out of university,

313
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:21,260
 and they interrogate you basically about your sexual history.

314
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:23,260
 And so one of the girls who joined,

315
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:25,020
 I think she was 22 at the time,

316
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,740
 she had the vetting officer knew more about me

317
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,460
 than anyone else alive.

318
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,380
 And you know, you have to discuss everyone,

319
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,660
 you've ever shacked with them,

320
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,540
 and all of your friends and family,

321
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:36,620
 you get drug tested, so you get a bit of hair clipped off.

322
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,180
 This seems like a real oversight.

323
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,660
 For instance, one person got this done,

324
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,940
 went to the hairdresser the next week,

325
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,100
 and the hairdresser was like,

326
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,740
 oh my god, you've got this random bull patch

327
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:44,820
 on the back of your head.

328
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,460
 And then you've got to come up with a cover story.

329
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:48,420
 They're like, oh yeah, just trying it out.

330
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:51,300
 That's probably your first test as a sponsor.

331
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,700
 That's another reason why James Bond

332
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,540
 probably wouldn't get in as a spy, actually,

333
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,140
 because the interview process to discuss

334
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:59,620
 everyone he'd ever slept with is still going on.

335
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:02,380
 He's still there, he's in a room somewhere.

336
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:04,740
 I read a piece of somebody who does recruitment for MI5,

337
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:07,020
 just known as Joe, and they basically explained

338
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,220
 that some candidates who come

339
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,020
 have got some strange ideas for what actually

340
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,540
 the job involves because of James Bond.

341
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:12,940
 I guess people are really scared to take this,

342
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,300
 that's not what the job is like.

343
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,860
 And some of the questions Joe was asked

344
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:18,300
 included, do I have to wear my own clothes to work?

345
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,380
 Should I wear a disguise instead?

346
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,580
 And do I need to dump my partner to work here?

347
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:23,820
 Because if I do, I will.

348
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,020
 [LAUGHTER]

349
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:32,860
 OK, it's time for fact number two, and that is Andy.

350
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:35,380
 My fact is that people drive more carefully

351
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:38,300
 if they have a pavlova in the car than their own child.

352
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,020
 [LAUGHTER]

353
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:42,380
 So this is an experiment that was done.

354
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,420
 It was a survey done, slightly as a PR stunt,

355
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:46,580
 by an insurance firm in Australia.

356
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,500
 They asked drivers about their behavior.

357
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,460
 First of all, they just said, what makes you drive more carefully?

358
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,340
 Would you drive more carefully if your child was in the car?

359
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:56,260
 Half of all parents surveyed said, yes, absolutely.

360
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:58,900
 Only 12% of those people said they would be more cautious

361
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,820
 if they were driving a pavlova around.

362
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,620
 Pavlova, and a rang, and cream-based pudding.

363
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:04,380
 Yeah.

364
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,220
 OK, good.

365
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,980
 And a child is a smaller version of a person.

366
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,980
 Anyway, they tested it with a small sample,

367
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,460
 admittedly, only 20 drivers.

368
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,780
 But over an eight-day period, they

369
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:17,020
 were asked to drive alone, with a child, and with a pavlova.

370
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:20,220
 95% of them, 19 out of 20, drove more carefully

371
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:23,100
 with a pavlova on board, which was way more

372
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,860
 than were more careful with their children.

373
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:27,380
 And what did the school say when they dropped off a pavlova

374
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,020
 at school when they didn't have the time?

375
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,660
 Nobody noticed the difference.

376
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:31,580
 Very impressive.

377
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:32,660
 I think it makes sense.

378
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:33,780
 It makes perfect sense.

379
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:36,420
 Daniel, the one who's got a child, that's slightly worried.

380
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,260
 That's true.

381
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,540
 Why do you think it makes sense, or do you have to explain that?

382
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,860
 Well, if you've had anything in the back of a car,

383
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:44,060
 that is of a sensitive nature, of course,

384
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:46,100
 you're going to take corners less sharply of this.

385
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,580
 Of course.

386
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:48,380
 Of course.

387
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,580
 Babies are very resilient.

388
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:52,300
 Well, you can't put a seatbelt around a pavlova.

389
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:55,100
 You could probably get it some sort of transportation device.

390
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,180
 Like, almost cupcake carriers, but with a belt.

391
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:57,940
 You can see it.

392
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,380
 Yeah, that's true.

393
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,740
 So maybe this solves all the driving issues

394
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,540
 that we have in the world, just anyone who's

395
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,980
 a bit of a dangerous driver, pop a pavlova in the back.

396
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:08,100
 And we're just going to solve everything.

397
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:11,260
 I am looking at more Australian studies about drivers,

398
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:14,300
 and one was about how people, when they first get their license,

399
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,660
 are very cautious, very careful.

400
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:18,500
 And as we drive them for longer, some people are more distracted.

401
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,580
 We start some people, some people start

402
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,260
 to see it as time taken out of their day.

403
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,820
 So what they did was they parked by a road

404
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,260
 and they took photos of anyone they saw

405
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,940
 doing on correct procedure.

406
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:31,180
 And pictures they got included people eating cereal at the wheel,

407
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:33,340
 brushing their hair and reading books.

408
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:33,860
 Wow.

409
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:35,620
 Driving around Australia.

410
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:36,620
 That's what it says.

411
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:37,620
 That's speed reading.

412
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,980
 I mean.

413
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:39,980
 Yeah.

414
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:42,100
 Did you guys know there's no safety difference

415
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:45,060
 between using a phone while you're driving a handheld phone

416
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,260
 and a hands-free phone?

417
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:46,740
 Really?

418
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,260
 Yeah.

419
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,060
 So I actually learned this.

420
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,660
 I went to a magic show at the Welcome Center,

421
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:50,340
 and it was about--

422
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:52,620
 [LAUGHTER]

423
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:55,060
 I have fact check this afterwards.

424
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,020
 It was about the science of misdirection

425
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:59,020
 and the fact that we don't notice things

426
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:01,020
 and the fact that we can be so easily distracted.

427
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:03,500
 And study after study has found that if you're on a phone,

428
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,940
 you're four times more likely to be involved in an accident

429
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:08,940
 completely regardless of whether it's handheld or hands-free.

430
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:12,740
 And it's just because it's the concentration that's distracted,

431
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:14,260
 not your actual hand.

432
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,980
 And so it found that, for instance, specifically,

433
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,060
 if you're on the phone and someone on the phone says,

434
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:21,340
 oh, do you remember where you put the bananas or whatever?

435
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:22,460
 And you have to find--

436
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:22,700
 Yeah.

437
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,660
 We're going to need to slice them up for the path over.

438
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:25,660
 What do you want?

439
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,300
 Then you're at your heads and your kitchen,

440
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,740
 rather than your head and your kitchen,

441
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:32,060
 not literally, but, metaphorically.

442
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:34,500
 And that apparently reduces your field of vision

443
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,260
 to about a quarter.

444
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:37,900
 Your field of vision that you can concentrate on to about a quarter,

445
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,620
 if you imagine that other place?

446
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,940
 I was looking into a few road safety things as well.

447
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:46,820
 So this was for pedestrians, rather than for how you drive safely.

448
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:50,540
 There was one idea that was put forward back in the 1930s,

449
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,780
 which didn't, unfortunately, happen.

450
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,060
 But I love the idea of it.

451
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,140
 So imagine you hit by a car.

452
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,740
 And the car does a hit and run.

453
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:58,860
 Disappears on you.

454
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,820
 Cars, and we're going to be designed

455
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:03,660
 with this little disc that shoots out of the car

456
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:06,460
 when a hit and run happens so that the person, if they were

457
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:09,220
 so knocked out, they couldn't see the license plate or anything.

458
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:12,420
 Grab the disc, which has the details of the owner of the car.

459
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,420
 That's a great idea.

460
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:15,940
 Yeah, and they never implemented it.

461
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:16,540
 I don't know why.

462
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:19,180
 Possibly, maybe the disc might have decapitated.

463
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:22,020
 Someone has shot out of the car.

464
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:27,300
 Just involuntary business car dispersal, basically.

465
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:31,740
 I like this weird gadget that was added to Volvo's actually.

466
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,780
 In 2007, it was a car safety thing.

467
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,140
 It was a smart key.

468
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,780
 It was a remote smart key, which we have now.

469
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:39,340
 So you can open your car from 100 yards away or whatever.

470
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:43,020
 And it contained a highly sensitive heartbeat sensor.

471
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,580
 It advertised itself as a world first.

472
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,860
 And that meant that when you went to unlock your car,

473
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:49,220
 it told you if there was somebody hiding in it.

474
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,060
 Hide it.

475
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,140
 Yeah, that's right.

476
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:51,940
 It flashed.

477
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,780
 So if you have 50 yards in your car, you unlocked it.

478
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,500
 It would give you a little flash to say,

479
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,180
 there's a person in there, get your weapons out.

480
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:00,820
 Really, distinguish, like, human from like Volvo.

481
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,020
 No, it's specified.

482
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,900
 It will tell if there's a human or an animal.

483
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:07,020
 So you wouldn't know if it was just a mouse scottling around.

484
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,620
 Or a person hiding in your boots.

485
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:09,140
 Yeah.

486
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,540
 Better safe than sorry, though.

487
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:13,340
 But that's never a thing that I've ever thought to check.

488
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:16,020
 Well, it's a good way of making your extremely paranoid

489
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,940
 now when you get into your car.

490
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:20,180
 But you know there's always that thing where you're driving,

491
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,060
 where you have this panic that you're

492
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,820
 going to look in the rearview mirror

493
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,900
 and you'll see someone rising up behind you.

494
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,500
 That's the movie, right?

495
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,340
 I've never had that, and I think you got that.

496
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,180
 Yeah, of course.

497
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:31,340
 Every time you're driving on your own at night.

498
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,340
 No.

499
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,620
 I don't know the car, it's tapping isn't what you've got to watch for.

500
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:35,620
 Oh, wow.

501
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,460
 That was a ghost story when I was a kid.

502
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:37,980
 OK.

503
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:41,460
 Do you have a big rug on your back seat, which could cover a murder?

504
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:43,420
 Just remove the rug.

505
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,180
 Well, it might be, I think we've mentioned this,

506
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:48,180
 but when the Berlin Wall, when people were trying to get across,

507
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:52,060
 there was that couple where the lady who shouldn't have gone across

508
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:54,820
 was sewn into the seat of the car.

509
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:55,860
 Oh, yeah.

510
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,420
 So that's another spot you got to worry about.

511
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,580
 Yeah, check inside the seat.

512
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,220
 Check inside your seats.

513
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,900
 Check underneath the big rug.

514
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:04,660
 If you didn't spot him on the roof or where you got in,

515
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:05,660
 that's your own problem.

516
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:11,940
 This study that you were mentioning, Andy,

517
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,180
 this was done in Australia, right?

518
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:13,700
 Yeah.

519
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,900
 Yeah.

520
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:18,940
 And so, Australia is very proud of Pavlova, because we invented it.

521
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:22,460
 Been a lot of dispute with the New Zealanders about who invented it.

522
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:26,260
 And then I learned, neither of us did, it turns out it's German.

523
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,580
 Is the latest theory.

524
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:30,460
 I love that there's theories of Pavlova origin.

525
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:31,260
 Nice.

526
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,620
 So what, what, what, what's the German origin?

527
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:36,060
 It's named after Anna Pavlova, the ballerina,

528
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:38,860
 because she was touring in Australia and New Zealand

529
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,900
 at the same time in the late 20s.

530
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:43,700
 So that's why both countries think they invented it.

531
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,620
 But really, there had been Pavlova style recipes,

532
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:49,060
 you know, you need burang and cream and fruit

533
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:50,540
 since the 18th century in Germany.

534
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:54,980
 So one of them was called a "shown taught" or "foam cake".

535
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:57,860
 And another one was called "Spanish wind taught".

536
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:01,220
 So they had the thing that just didn't call it Pavlova.

537
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:04,420
 I don't know if I'd put the word "wind" in a recipe now,

538
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:07,380
 just unless it was sort of a bean recipe or something.

539
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:11,220
 She apparently, Anna Pavlova, had more food, named after her.

540
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,180
 The only one that I could find was frog legs,

541
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,540
 Ella Pavlova.

542
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:15,660
 Is it because she was a ballerina?

543
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:16,980
 Yeah, frog legs had legs.

544
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:19,220
 Yeah, well, it was famous for having good legs.

545
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:22,020
 Famously known as what people have legs.

546
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:25,220
 You know, so she was an excellent ballerina, not just a ballerina.

547
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:29,500
 It's so good and so popular that when she died in 1931,

548
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,060
 when she died of pneumonia, and in fact, when she died,

549
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:35,700
 she was diagnosed with pneumonia, told she'd have to have an operation.

550
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,620
 That would mean she could never dance again.

551
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,420
 And she said no, I'd rather be dead.

552
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:41,620
 So she died in 1931 of pneumonia.

553
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,940
 And the next show that she was scheduled to do, the audience came,

554
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,700
 and they put a spotlight on an empty stage

555
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,980
 and the spotlight followed around exactly where she would have been.

556
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:51,140
 And they just watched that and said, "Isn't that cool?"

557
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:53,300
 That's cool. Not a good excuse to die, though.

558
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,260
 The whole dancing thing, I would say.

559
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,020
 Well, if it's the one thing you love.

560
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:00,460
 If I came back home and said they were like, "Dan, you got pneumonia."

561
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:03,620
 "We'll give you an operation, but it means you can't podcast anymore."

562
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:06,700
 I think Fonella would have an issue if I said, actually.

563
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:07,940
 Send me to the grave.

564
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,940
 I'd love for you to have that operation.

565
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,580
 I just think for myself.

566
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:17,660
 OK, it is time for fact number three, and that is my fact.

567
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:20,860
 My fact this week is that Ringo Starr's grandmother

568
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:25,180
 performed exorcisms on him to cure him from being left-handed.

569
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:25,980
 Wow.

570
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:28,460
 She reported to child services, or was that that was before?

571
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,420
 It's a different time.

572
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:30,420
 Different time.

573
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:31,420
 Did it work?

574
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,420
 It did, yeah.

575
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:33,580
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

576
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,500
 Well, for many years it did.

577
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,260
 Because I thought that he said in one interview that he plays

578
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,820
 with the right-handed drum kit, but he sort of leads with his left hand.

579
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:41,820
 Yes.

580
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:42,820
 He does most other things left-handed.

581
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:43,820
 Yeah, exactly.

582
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:44,820
 Doesn't look like it partially works.

583
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:47,300
 Maybe by exorcisms, she actually just bought him the right-handed drum kit.

584
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,980
 I think that's why exorcisms will be easier for her.

585
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,940
 Why am she going around doing exorcisms?

586
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:55,780
 So Ringo Starr's grandmother, Annie Bauer, she was born in 1889.

587
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:59,540
 She was known in Liverpool as the voodoo queen of Liverpool,

588
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,700
 certainly within the family.

589
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,940
 That's what she was famous for.

590
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:04,620
 And she was sort of known as a sort of 20th century witch.

591
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,980
 She used to concoct her own remedies.

592
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:11,300
 She would make potions when she was sort of looking after sick people.

593
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,020
 She used to invoke Satan.

594
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:15,500
 She used to try and expel Satan from people.

595
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:19,140
 So to bring him out, doing exorcisms on various people.

596
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:22,020
 And so when she saw that her grandson was left-handed,

597
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,260
 she thought that's the devil.

598
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,020
 Left-handedness is associated with that.

599
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:25,900
 I'm going to get rid of him.

600
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:28,980
 And she spent years of him, the devil.

601
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:29,820
 Oh, sorry.

602
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:30,860
 Yeah, sorry.

603
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:35,060
 And so she spent ages trying to exercise it out of him.

604
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:39,340
 But what's truly interesting about this is that Ringo says it's for this reason

605
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:43,140
 that he developed what became the unique drumming style that he had

606
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:45,180
 because he drums on a right-handed drum kit.

607
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:48,660
 But as a left-hander, it takes him just a split second more,

608
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:51,540
 like a tiny microsecond more to get to that bit of the drum.

609
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,740
 And that gives him a sort of lazy drumming style

610
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:56,540
 that's slightly off time, which gives it a swing.

611
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:59,620
 So the negative interpretation is that had he not been exercised

612
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:01,740
 as a child, he might have been a better drummer?

613
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,660
 No, because he's an unbelievable drummer.

614
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:06,740
 Unless a less unique drummer.

615
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:09,220
 He's an incredible drummer.

616
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:11,580
 We should talk a bit about the book you've got this from, Dan,

617
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,580
 because this is from a book called "Is It Tune in?"

618
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:14,580
 Yeah.

619
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,980
 It's "The Bography of the Beatles" by Mark Lewison.

620
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:20,100
 This is an amazing book, because it's nearly 1,000 pages long

621
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,940
 and it ends in 1962.

622
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:22,540
 Yeah.

623
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,820
 End as they're releasing their first single.

624
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:28,700
 It is good to have that warning that it ends after 1,000 pages

625
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:31,780
 just as they start, I think, before you embark on the book.

626
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:34,660
 It's like that when you're reading a novel, and it's sort of really crunchy,

627
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:37,140
 and you're really near the end, and you're like, "They can't wrap this whole app."

628
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:40,300
 And you're like, "No! Turn the pages to the end.

629
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,940
 What they're going to cover their whole career?"

630
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:44,580
 And then they did quite well the end.

631
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:48,140
 I like the fact that he found the first fan of the Beatles,

632
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:48,940
 tracked her down.

633
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:52,020
 She was an Irish woman called Pat Morin, who lived in Liverpool,

634
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:56,180
 and there's another churchy devil connection here,

635
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:58,900
 because her father sent her to confession

636
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,060
 for talking about the Beatles too much.

637
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:01,580
 Cool.

638
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:03,380
 Which apparently classified as a sin.

639
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:05,540
 God, you're clutching its straws if that's your sin.

640
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:07,820
 You've got to start rebelling more.

641
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:12,020
 Well, they were all, because the Beatles had a very odd effect on girls

642
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:14,220
 in that period in the 1960s.

643
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:17,500
 There was a book that came out about them that said John Lennon was told.

644
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:20,620
 Girls in the audience were actively touching themselves

645
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:23,380
 in the audience and orgasming while they were playing on stage.

646
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,380
 They had this kind of craze.

647
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,860
 And that was in the 1960s.

648
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:27,660
 That's a very different world to what we...

649
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:29,100
 I don't know. It was a liberated time.

650
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,020
 Everyone was on air.

651
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,900
 But they were the people liberating...

652
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,500
 By causing a lot of public masturbation.

653
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:37,300
 So on the way people behaved around the Beatles,

654
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,340
 they had to be quite heavy security for them all the time.

655
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:43,540
 And in fact, they changed the way that the Japanese police operate.

656
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:46,700
 So the Japanese police today were white gloves.

657
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,780
 So if you ever go to the pan using the police, they wear white gloves,

658
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:50,540
 and a lot of people have wondered why...

659
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:52,180
 It's a Michael Jackson tribute, isn't it?

660
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:55,660
 And a lot of people think it's a Michael Jackson tribute,

661
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:58,180
 but actually a huge misconception.

662
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:00,940
 The Beatles went there in 1966.

663
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:04,740
 And the police chief, who was responsible for the police force there,

664
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:07,860
 said that there had to be a layer of propriety added between the police

665
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:10,420
 and the women, they were inevitably going to be touching

666
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:13,820
 as they dragged them away kicking and screaming from the Beatles.

667
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:16,140
 And so they all had to wear these white gloves.

668
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:19,780
 And he was interviewed in 2010, and he confirmed that.

669
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:22,740
 And it was to reinforce this thing called "ragitadashisha",

670
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,940
 which is sort of a notion of propriety.

671
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,900
 But that's interesting, because I think the Japanese subways

672
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,060
 famously very, very, very, very busy.

673
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:32,140
 And they have people whose job it is to push people into the carriages

674
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:33,140
 to make crown more people in.

675
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,580
 And I'm pretty sure they wear white gloves.

676
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,820
 So maybe it's a bit more polite rather than shoving you.

677
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:38,460
 I mean, officially shoving you.

678
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:41,660
 But that move is where they get the song.

679
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,500
 In fact, that's where they got the inspiration for their song.

680
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,700
 All you need is glove.

681
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:47,140
 Hmm, it's very strong.

682
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:49,500
 -Love me, dude. -Love me, dude.

683
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,940
 A lot of their songs have the word "love" in them.

684
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:52,300
 -Let's go through the world. -Let's go through the world.

685
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,340
 The glove album.

686
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,860
 So the Hamburg days were extraordinary.

687
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,540
 This is the two years before they basically

688
00:23:57,540 --> 00:24:00,020
 got into the charts in the very start of the '60s.

689
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:02,220
 And they lived in Hamburg, basically,

690
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:04,620
 in this storage room behind the stage

691
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,980
 where they performed in this CD bar.

692
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:09,340
 And they sort of lived on fold-out beds,

693
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:12,060
 and they had to shower in the public bathrooms in the bar.

694
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:14,460
 And that's where they actually got spotted by George Martin,

695
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:17,100
 I think, who basically sort of made the Beatles.

696
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,700
 But he thought they were kind of crap in a lot of ways.

697
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,780
 So he thought they couldn't write songs.

698
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,220
 They were really keen to write their own songs.

699
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:25,540
 And I think he wanted them to release a cover

700
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:28,380
 as their first kind of number one, or he intended.

701
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,980
 And he said their songwriting was crap.

702
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:33,580
 The first records we issued were "Love Me Do" and "P.S."

703
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:36,860
 "I Love You," which are not exactly cold-pulsar, are they?

704
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:38,860
 Which, actually, if you listen to this, it's fair enough.

705
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:40,420
 But yeah, he thought they were crap.

706
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:43,540
 When they were in Hamburg, they obviously

707
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,860
 were not making very much money at all.

708
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:46,980
 I think they got £2.50 per show.

709
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:48,980
 And they had to do four shows on a weeknight,

710
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:51,660
 five on a Saturday and six on a Sunday.

711
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,020
 It's like a Pantos catcher.

712
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:54,820
 Yeah, it really is.

713
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:56,740
 And then they got offered from a rival club.

714
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:58,860
 And so the boss of the first club they'd been working at,

715
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:02,620
 reported George Harrison to the police and got him deported.

716
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:05,340
 And then, the same manager had already had it in for them.

717
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:07,140
 He got McCartney, I can't believe this.

718
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:09,100
 He got McCartney and Pete Best arrested

719
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,700
 and deported for setting fire to a condom.

720
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:15,940
 Oh, I don't understand why.

721
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:18,500
 Surely it doesn't take two people to set fire to a condom.

722
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,460
 I want to hold a condom, I want to light the match.

723
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:23,740
 I'm trying to light a match with one hand.

724
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:25,100
 We should say we're talking about their Hamburg days,

725
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:27,500
 but Ringo wasn't there for their Hamburg days.

726
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,900
 So they were a five-man operation.

727
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:32,580
 Many people say the superior version.

728
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:35,140
 So that was with Pete Best and Stuart Zuckercliffe.

729
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:36,060
 Yeah.

730
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:38,180
 Just on the fact, Pete Best left the Beatles

731
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:40,700
 and he didn't go on to anything major.

732
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:43,420
 So Ringo Starr, as well as the Beatles,

733
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:46,220
 his other big thing was he was the voice of Thomas the Tank Engine.

734
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:47,540
 Series one.

735
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:49,940
 And I found another sort of rock connection

736
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:53,020
 of someone who left a band just before it got big.

737
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,580
 And it relates to Thomas the Tank Engine.

738
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:58,420
 Timothy Steffel was the lead singer of a band called Smile.

739
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:01,260
 And then he left because he thought the band was going nowhere.

740
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:04,260
 So the guitarist and the drummer brought in a new singer

741
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:05,660
 called Freddie Mercury.

742
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:08,540
 And that band was Queen, obviously.

743
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:12,380
 And so Smile was Roger Taylor, Brian May, and Timothy Steffel.

744
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:13,420
 Steffel left.

745
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:15,820
 But he found a second career as a model maker

746
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:18,140
 for all the trains on Thomas the Tank Engine.

747
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,940
 Oh, my God.

748
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,260
 Ringo Starr.

749
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:22,300
 That was incredible.

750
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,260
 That's really cool.

751
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:25,780
 Because the fact controller in Thomas the Tank Engine

752
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:29,420
 was played by Bill Wyman after he left the Rolling Stone.

753
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:30,420
 You're kidding.

754
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,900
 Yeah, I'm kidding.

755
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,420
 Done for God's sake.

756
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:35,140
 Sorry, I was getting so excited.

757
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:36,500
 I think it's time to come in three.

758
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,620
 Yeah, exactly.

759
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,660
 There's probably probably is one more rock connection

760
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,460
 to come up with the tank around the whereabouts.

761
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:42,980
 Listeners, find it.

762
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:46,060
 Just one-- another thing about Ringo's life post Beatles.

763
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:47,460
 Possibly the highlight of his career

764
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:50,100
 was when he did a pizza advert in 1995.

765
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,500
 This was a seminal moment, because it

766
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:55,900
 was when the stuffed crust of Pizza Hut fame came into being.

767
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:58,660
 And it was this great advert where he sort of threw out

768
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,380
 the addy's pretending he was getting the band back together.

769
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:02,260
 And it's like, oh, I've got to convince them.

770
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,260
 Oh, they'll never do it.

771
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:03,780
 Come on.

772
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:04,740
 You should watch the advert.

773
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:05,940
 Getting the band back together.

774
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:08,220
 Lenin had been dead for 14 years at this point.

775
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:12,460
 Yeah, it was a sick advert, OK?

776
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:14,700
 So he makes us seem like he's going to resurrect John Lenin's

777
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,860
 dead body.

778
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:17,500
 Probably needed his grandmother for that.

779
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:20,060
 [LAUGHTER]

780
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:23,020
 So he's in this advert saying, I'll get the band back together.

781
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:25,140
 Until it becomes clear at the end, what he's actually saying

782
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:29,740
 is, I'm going to convince them all to eat pizza crust first.

783
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:31,060
 And then there's this really awkward moment

784
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:33,660
 where in the final scene, his three apparent bandmates

785
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,860
 come on and start eating it crust first.

786
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:37,380
 Anyway, it's a humorous advert.

787
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:39,940
 The amusing thing is, he's never eaten a pizza in his life.

788
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:42,020
 He watched that advert as it goes towards his mouth,

789
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:44,180
 the advert ends, because he's allergic to all

790
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:45,500
 the ingredients of pizza.

791
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,780
 All the ingredients of pizza.

792
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:47,660
 Every ingredient.

793
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:49,700
 He's allergic to onions, garlic, spices.

794
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,020
 He's allergic to all this stuff.

795
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:53,020
 Never had a pizza, never had a curry.

796
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,780
 We need to move on.

797
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:57,180
 I can just mention one last thing, and then we'll move on.

798
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,940
 And so Pete Bess, the original drummer.

799
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:01,220
 He was kicked out, which was devastating for him.

800
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,620
 But he continued to be a musician

801
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:05,140
 after he got over a bit of a depressive stage.

802
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,500
 And he went on to release an album

803
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:10,820
 called Best of the Beatles, which a lot of people accidentally

804
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:13,460
 bought, by mistake, thinking it was a compilation

805
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,460
 of the greatest hits.

806
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,620
 Best of not the best of all.

807
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:16,620
 Exactly.

808
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:17,820
 He claimed the wrong word.

809
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:24,020
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show.

810
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:26,220
 And that is Juzinski.

811
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:28,540
 My fact this week is that baby albatrosses

812
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:34,060
 can take up to six days to peck their way out of their eggs.

813
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:37,500
 Imagine being trapped somewhere in the dark six days.

814
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,820
 It's like the Great Escape.

815
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:40,300
 And this is called Pipping.

816
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,140
 So what happens is they've got the egg tooth, which

817
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:44,140
 a lot of birds have, which is a sort of hard projection

818
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,180
 on their bills.

819
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:48,380
 And they peck away at the shell from the inside.

820
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:51,300
 And on average, albatross chicks take about 3.5 days

821
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,300
 to emerge, but some of them are weaker ones,

822
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:55,700
 the thicker-shelled ones, they take up to a week

823
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,020
 to make their way out.

824
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:58,060
 That's interesting, yeah.

825
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:59,540
 And I think part of them will emerge,

826
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:00,700
 and they can sort of be fed.

827
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:03,620
 So you do see eggs with sort of a head sticking out.

828
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:05,460
 And it's like you've gone on the couple of days left, mate.

829
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:07,020
 But if you're going to help them by feeding them,

830
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:08,860
 could you not help them open their egg?

831
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:11,220
 You've got to let kids learn for themselves.

832
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:13,060
 We're albatrosses to start.

833
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:15,140
 OK, time to fledge.

834
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:17,580
 I'm not ready to fledge them in the egg.

835
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:20,180
 They sometimes lose their eggs, albatrosses.

836
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:22,380
 So most of them keep them in a nest.

837
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:24,340
 And we should say there are 20 species of albatrosses,

838
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:25,140
 which I didn't like.

839
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:27,940
 But some of them waved albatrosses quite mobile,

840
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:29,980
 and they will move their egg around their territory

841
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:31,340
 with them as they go.

842
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:33,380
 And frequently they just lose them.

843
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:36,140
 So 80% of the anguish don't hatch are because they get lost.

844
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:36,700
 Really?

845
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:37,220
 Yeah.

846
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:39,460
 I think you always get in calls from sort of restaurants saying,

847
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:43,180
 excuse me, sorry, I think you left your egg on the wrong table.

848
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:45,540
 But albatrosses are generally, apart from the ones

849
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:46,900
 who lose their eggs, quite good parents.

850
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,780
 So albatrosses, a couple of them, they say,

851
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,300
 and these parents dropped to 50 years.

852
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,420
 But they're not completely monogamous.

853
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:55,060
 So they did a study of 75 different albatrosses.

854
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:57,540
 And 10% of them had different fathers

855
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:59,700
 to the albatross raising them.

856
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:02,020
 But both the male and the female albatrosses

857
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:03,820
 will go and be with other albatrosses.

858
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:06,160
 But they'll always come back to their home albatross.

859
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,300
 Yeah.

860
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:13,100
 But so they are 100% faithful, as a, let's say,

861
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:15,700
 in a married couple, as a married couple, let's say,

862
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:16,500
 in quotations.

863
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,860
 They pair for life.

864
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:20,860
 But if this is your view of faithfulness as a married man,

865
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:23,220
 then I dread to think of another's listening right now.

866
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:24,300
 No, no, no, no.

867
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,940
 What I dread was there was a book that came out

868
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:28,460
 called "The Thing with Feathers" by Noah Stryker.

869
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:31,060
 And Noah Stryker did basically a table

870
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:33,260
 of bird divorce rates for this book.

871
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:36,620
 He looked at 100 or so different species of birds,

872
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:38,380
 and he built the divorce rates.

873
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:41,620
 And at the top of the most faithful in terms

874
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:44,020
 of remaining with a single partner for their whole life

875
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,380
 was the albatross.

876
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:48,340
 And flamingos were right at the bottom.

877
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:50,500
 They have a 99% divorce rate.

878
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,740
 Wow.

879
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:53,100
 But basically, what we're saying is albatrosses

880
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,300
 have open marriages.

881
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,900
 Yeah, on both sides.

882
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:56,700
 Yeah, OK.

883
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,900
 Do you know why albatrosses tend not

884
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,540
 to go to divorce lawyers?

885
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:01,860
 Because the bill too big.

886
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,700
 The bills are huge.

887
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:06,300
 When one of us immediately guessed the punchline to your joke

888
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,940
 at it is worth reconsidering.

889
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,300
 That's quite an interesting thing, actually,

890
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,940
 about these open relationships.

891
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:14,500
 And this is related to the lason albatross

892
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,340
 which lives around the Hawaiian Islands.

893
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:17,940
 They have this weird gender imbalance.

894
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:20,300
 59% of them are female on there.

895
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:22,860
 And that's just because a lot of females immigrated there.

896
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:25,100
 So they often separate in their flying season.

897
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:29,580
 And this means that 31% of lason albatross pairs

898
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,220
 are female on female.

899
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:32,420
 They raise chicks together.

900
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:35,540
 So the males will inseminate a series of females

901
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:37,900
 and can only raise one egg at a time.

902
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:40,500
 And so the other women who've been abandoned by their man

903
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,180
 find another lady.

904
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:43,420
 And they raise the egg together.

905
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:45,140
 And they will stay together for a lifetime.

906
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:47,460
 Just like just like male female pairs.

907
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:49,460
 And they're pretty successful raising the chicks.

908
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:51,540
 The lason albatrosses are really interesting.

909
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:54,860
 They do their courting, viral dance

910
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:58,020
 that they have, which is an established dance.

911
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:01,180
 What they do is, when they're about three years of age,

912
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:05,180
 they go back to their birthplace and they all meet there

913
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:07,300
 and they learn the dance as a group.

914
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,660
 And then eventually, they find their partner

915
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:11,220
 when they're ready to court.

916
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,460
 It's this-- - They're very intricate.

917
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:14,300
 But it does take years of practice.

918
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:16,660
 So actually, we've got these people who listen

919
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:20,060
 to our show who are so great called Michelle and Chris.

920
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:22,980
 And they work with albatrosses out on Goff Island.

921
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,460
 These really endangered albatrosses.

922
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:25,460
 - Where's Goff Island, sorry?

923
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:27,260
 - Goff Island is in the South Atlantic.

924
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,100
 So yeah, they work with them.

925
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:30,660
 And anyway, one of them wrote to me and said that display

926
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:32,340
 is it's like head bobbing.

927
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:33,860
 It's wings spreading.

928
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:36,380
 They make these bubbling sounds in their throats.

929
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:38,100
 And yeah, they practice for years and years

930
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,180
 before they're ready.

931
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,100
 Imagine if you're flirting.

932
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,740
 You have to practice flirting for--

933
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:43,260
 - I mean, I did.

934
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,100
 (laughing)

935
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:47,100
 And for years and years, you know, you're interested.

936
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,980
 So this is bringing a lot of might be an albatross.

937
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:52,540
 They do have kind of singles bars where they go.

938
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:53,740
 Some side species do.

939
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:56,060
 Well, yeah, they have things all gams.

940
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:58,460
 So this is for Southern Bullers albatrosses.

941
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:59,860
 When they're aged about eight years old,

942
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:02,580
 the males all go ashore and they make a nest.

943
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:05,660
 And then the females visit and they have a look around

944
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:08,020
 and they're like, you know, whether they like it or not,

945
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:11,260
 but they only form a pair in their fourth year on shore.

946
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:12,740
 They've already been through three years

947
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:15,980
 of prospecting each other and checking each other out.

948
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:17,180
 - It's like university.

949
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:18,660
 - It's exactly like university.

950
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:19,660
 - Per-up at the end.

951
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:20,500
 - Yeah.

952
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:21,340
 And four years.

953
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:23,620
 So we know it's a Scottish or American university, for example.

954
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:27,180
 - So my favourite albatross is, have you heard of Albert,

955
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:28,580
 the lonely Scottish albatross?

956
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:29,580
 - No.

957
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:31,860
 - Albert, very sadly, was blown off course

958
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:34,620
 in the South Atlantic in 1967 and rocked off in Scotland

959
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:36,900
 where he's been living as a bachelor ever since.

960
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:39,140
 He's not yet found and made.

961
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:41,060
 - Can't he part with a puffin or something?

962
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,060
 Size difference.

963
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,260
 (laughing)

964
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:45,740
 And these things don't get in the way of true love.

965
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:47,340
 Yeah, so he's living between.

966
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:49,820
 Yeah, he lives between the Alter Hebrides and Shetland.

967
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,140
 - Are there people around where he is?

968
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:53,060
 Or is he just monitored?

969
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:54,500
 - He's been seen by Broadway shows,

970
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,300
 but I think he's a little weaker albatross.

971
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,140
 It's not people.

972
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:57,980
 - Oh my god.

973
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:58,820
 - He's just idea.

974
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:00,620
 - As a bird watcher, if you're spending your whole life

975
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:01,940
 around blue tits and sparrows,

976
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:04,700
 that is fucking exciting when a giant albatross

977
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,340
 appears on their horizon.

978
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:07,500
 'Cause they are massive.

979
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,060
 They've got, I think the Wingspan,

980
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:11,860
 the Wondering Albatross Wingspan is 3.5 meters, is it?

981
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:12,700
 - 3.5 meters.

982
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:13,700
 - They're ridiculously huge.

983
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:14,540
 - It's big.

984
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:16,620
 - Anyway, I just want to talk about the Tristan albatross,

985
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:18,180
 which is the second biggest albatross.

986
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:20,220
 So people thought it was in the same species

987
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:24,180
 as the Wondering, and then it split away in 1998.

988
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:27,100
 Anyway, these are the albatrosses that are friends

989
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:30,340
 and podcast listeners, Michelle and Chris look after

990
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:33,180
 on Goff Island, because the most amazing thing

991
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:34,340
 has been happening to them.

992
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:37,340
 So they're obviously huge, but they don't have any natural

993
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:39,140
 predators 'cause they're alone on this island.

994
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:40,780
 And so they have no defense mechanisms.

995
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:45,260
 So invasive mice arrived on the island a few decades ago,

996
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:47,020
 and they've just been eating them.

997
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:47,860
 - Oh no.

998
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:49,780
 - So these, it's unbelievable.

999
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:53,300
 So these tiny little mice, you'll get a 20 gram mouse,

1000
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:56,780
 and it will just eat away at 10 kilogram albatross chick.

1001
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:58,340
 Or sometimes I'll even eat the adults,

1002
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:00,060
 so that adults will stay with the chicks

1003
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:01,500
 and let themselves be eaten by mice

1004
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,020
 because they're so afraid to leave.

1005
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:03,860
 - Wow.

1006
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,460
 - That chick is really, really sad,

1007
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,220
 and so they become critically endangered

1008
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:08,060
 because of this.

1009
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:08,900
 - But they must have.

1010
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:09,740
 - They sit there.

1011
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,780
 - What do you mean they have no, they can move?

1012
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:12,620
 - They sit there.

1013
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:13,900
 - Have they lost the ability to think,

1014
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:17,460
 if I smack it with my giant wing, it will fling off.

1015
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:19,740
 - They don't have the ability to think that.

1016
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:20,580
 - It's incredible.

1017
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:21,580
 So what is happening, too?

1018
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:23,580
 - So what's happening is this team of people

1019
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,660
 have gone out there, and so these three guys,

1020
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:27,180
 two of whom are Michelle and Christopher,

1021
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:29,340
 are now trying to save the albatross

1022
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:31,140
 is essentially by killing all the mice.

1023
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:33,100
 And we're getting them back guys.

1024
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,900
 But it's, yeah, it's a good cause there.

1025
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:38,740
 I think there are 1,500 to 2,400 pairs left at the moment,

1026
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:41,100
 and it's quite funny when you look them up on Wikipedia,

1027
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:44,020
 it said, "Cause albatrosses fly hundreds of thousands

1028
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:47,620
 of miles so far, but they only breed in this tiny island."

1029
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:52,300
 So they have an occurrence range of 5.4 million square miles,

1030
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:54,660
 and a breeding range of 31 square miles.

1031
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:55,660
 - Wow.

1032
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:59,340
 - So flipped on a different way of talking about it,

1033
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:01,300
 there's another podcast out there talking about

1034
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:03,540
 two mice murderers on Godfatherland.

1035
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:05,420
 - Yeah, they moved in.

1036
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:06,700
 - They've gone, they live on this island,

1037
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:08,820
 they just murder mice all day.

1038
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:11,060
 - I mean, the mice are impressive, they're like super mice.

1039
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:13,340
 So to be fair, they are, I think they're the biggest mice

1040
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,180
 in the world.

1041
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:15,020
 - Wow.

1042
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:17,100
 - In fact, 'cause they've got island gigantism,

1043
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:18,980
 they know where you've got nothing threatening you,

1044
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:19,900
 you're the only ones there.

1045
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:20,740
 - So they're huge.

1046
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:22,540
 If you're on the mouse's side, they're doing bloody well.

1047
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:24,500
 - Sounds like your two friends are very small.

1048
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:27,060
 (laughing)

1049
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:27,900
 - They are.

1050
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,740
 They've got island dwarfism, these two humans.

1051
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:31,420
 They've been there too long.

1052
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:33,020
 - Have you guys heard of wisdom?

1053
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:33,860
 - Wisdom, the albatross.

1054
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:34,820
 - Yes, I believe I embody it.

1055
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:36,660
 - Well, I'm not sure.

1056
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:39,140
 So wisdom is a laser in albatross,

1057
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:40,540
 like the ones we were talking earlier.

1058
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:42,660
 So she's the oldest albatross in the world.

1059
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:45,020
 She was first ringed in 1956.

1060
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:46,100
 She's still alive.

1061
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:48,460
 So she's at least 64 years old.

1062
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:50,100
 And in fact, we know she's a bit older,

1063
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,300
 'cause when she was ringed, the scientist who ringed her

1064
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:54,140
 said, "Well, she's about five years old."

1065
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:56,140
 She was still alive in 2018.

1066
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:57,780
 And this is the really cool thing.

1067
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:01,060
 The biologist who first found her in 1956 and ringed her

1068
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:03,780
 was an ornithologist called Chandler Robbins.

1069
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:05,340
 Okay, so he ringed her, went away.

1070
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:08,380
 Then in 2002, 46 years later,

1071
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:10,580
 he tries to ring another albatross and says,

1072
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:12,700
 "Oh, this is already ringed."

1073
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:15,660
 And it's the bird I ringed 46 years ago.

1074
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:16,900
 That is a bit annoying, though, isn't it?

1075
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:19,740
 If you're hoping to get to an albatross.

1076
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:22,500
 It wasn't his second albatross.

1077
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,900
 It's whole life for the same albatross.

1078
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:25,740
 It's incredible.

1079
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:27,620
 He is an amazing figure in terms of

1080
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:28,780
 Ornithology and Birdwatching.

1081
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:31,300
 He died in 2017, Asian 98.

1082
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:32,420
 And that's partly, you know,

1083
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:34,140
 albatrosses often outlive the research

1084
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:34,980
 that's working on them.

1085
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:35,820
 That's incredible.

1086
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:36,980
 That's a long lived year.

1087
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:38,900
 Do they live, do they have albatross years?

1088
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,100
 Like, you know, had dog years,

1089
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,180
 different to human years?

1090
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:42,980
 I think they just live a really long time.

1091
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:45,740
 So they're like, they're in conjo-- they're year is our year.

1092
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:47,700
 Well, we don't know because people,

1093
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,020
 dog years aren't really a thing,

1094
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:50,620
 except for the fact that dogs are our pets.

1095
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:52,500
 And so we speculate about that kind of bullshit,

1096
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,380
 whereas people don't have many pet albatrosses.

1097
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:55,340
 It's not official.

1098
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:56,340
 Dog years is not unofficial.

1099
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:57,740
 Well, what do you think dog years means?

1100
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:59,700
 They don't know their own birthdays.

1101
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,260
 No, it's about celebrations.

1102
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:04,260
 It's about time passage and lifespan, right?

1103
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:05,100
 Yes, that's true.

1104
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:07,260
 So the lifespan is about 60.

1105
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,540
 Yeah, in albatross years?

1106
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:09,940
 Oh, my god.

1107
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:12,540
 We're going to have to wrap up in a second.

1108
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,300
 Just one more thing, albatrosses,

1109
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,420
 when Western explorers first discovered them,

1110
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:18,020
 they thought they were sheep.

1111
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:19,180
 No, flying sheep.

1112
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:21,900
 That's right, just big old flying sheep, really?

1113
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,620
 Well, this is according to these researchers

1114
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:25,020
 they were in touch with, but apparently,

1115
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:26,700
 the explorer Marian de Fresno,

1116
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:31,060
 when he visited in 1772, he visited Prince Edward Island.

1117
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:33,500
 And he just saw these huge white figures

1118
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,060
 wandering around the grass and said,

1119
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:36,620
 "Well, there's a whole bunch of sheep here."

1120
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:37,460
 Great.

1121
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:39,060
 So did he get really close up to them?

1122
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:41,660
 He did, I think the man's an idiot.

1123
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:42,500
 He was stroking.

1124
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:45,620
 He was going, "This wool is not the same as ours."

1125
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:47,460
 They measure their speed with their nostrils.

1126
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:49,540
 They have these tubes inside their nose.

1127
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:51,980
 And it's exactly the same as how planes measure their speed.

1128
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:54,300
 So planes have things called pito tubes,

1129
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:56,540
 which measure airflow and pressure at the end of that tube.

1130
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:58,380
 And that tells you how fast the plane is moving.

1131
00:38:58,380 --> 00:38:59,220
 Wow.

1132
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:00,220
 And albatrosses can do the same thing.

1133
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:01,220
 Wow.

1134
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:02,220
 Yeah.

1135
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:03,220
 Wonder where they need to know their speed.

1136
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:05,700
 Do you think they get back and go, cracked 70?

1137
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:06,700
 Personal best.

1138
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:09,500
 I don't know, mate, there's a bill here for speeding.

1139
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,740
 And it's a huge bill.

1140
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:12,740
 [LAUGHTER]

1141
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:18,900
 OK, that is it.

1142
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:19,820
 That is all of our facts.

1143
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:21,100

 Or no such thing as a fish.com.

1155
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:43,180
 We have everything up there from our previous episodes

1156
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:45,460
 to behind-the-scenes documentary footage

1157
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:46,980
 that you can download.

1158
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:50,140
 And hey, why not also go to amazon.co.uk

1159
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:53,220
 and get Andy's new book, as we said at the top of the show.

1160
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:54,540
 It's out now.

1161
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:55,300
 Kids will love it.

1162
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,500
 Mickey and the animal spies.

1163
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:59,660
 It's called, it's all this GCHQ kind of stuff in it

1164
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:01,340
 with codes to crack and more code.

1165
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:04,340
 You'll learn more code by the end of the book, which is amazing.

1166
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:06,260
 And yeah, so go and get it for your kids.

1167
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:07,180
 It's awesome.

1168
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,660
 OK, we'll be back again next week.

1169
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:09,380
 We'll see you then.

1170
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:11,060
 Goodbye.
