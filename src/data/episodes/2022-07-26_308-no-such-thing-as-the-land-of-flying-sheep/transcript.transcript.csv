00:00:02,00:00:05,"- Hi guys, just before we start the show,"
00:00:05,00:00:09,"here is a warning, we have a special guest on today."
00:00:09,00:00:12,"- Yes, very exciting guest, a author, a published author."
00:00:12,00:00:15,"- A published author, I can't believe we've pinned her down."
00:00:15,00:00:17,But one of the ways we haven't pinned her down
00:00:17,00:00:19,is that she works in the office with us.
00:00:19,00:00:21,"It's Ann Miller, you will have heard her before."
00:00:21,00:00:22,"- That's right, Ann Miller has just released"
00:00:22,00:00:25,"her debut children's book, it's so good."
00:00:25,00:00:27,"It's called Mickey and the Animal Spies,"
00:00:27,00:00:30,and it is the story of a young girl
00:00:30,00:00:35,who gets recruited into a secret organization called Cobra.
00:00:35,00:00:39,"But it is not manned by humans, but by animals."
00:00:39,00:00:40,"- That's right, I realized I'm not a child,"
00:00:40,00:00:43,but I have actually read it and I genuinely loved it.
00:00:43,00:00:45,It's like a fantasy book that you wish you'd had
00:00:45,00:00:50,"if you were sort of 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 34."
00:00:50,00:00:51,"- I'm not a child either, however,"
00:00:51,00:00:53,"I do have the reading level of a seven year old,"
00:00:53,00:00:56,and I have to say I think any kid who gets this book
00:00:56,00:00:59,"will be fascinated, they'll know more's code at the end of it,"
00:00:59,00:01:00,"and they will just want more,"
00:01:00,00:01:02,and they're gonna get more because it's part of a trilogy.
00:01:02,00:01:05,"- It is, yes, and it does have code scattered throughout it."
00:01:05,00:01:07,"So it's almost at a mini-activity book,"
00:01:07,00:01:09,"and yeah, it features some cracking animals,"
00:01:09,00:01:11,"it gets cats in it, there's rats,"
00:01:11,00:01:14,"there's complex characters who maybe you don't love at first,"
00:01:14,00:01:16,but you grow very fond of.
00:01:16,00:01:18,"There is a Cobra, 'cause it's very funny pun"
00:01:18,00:01:21,"on the real life Cobra organization,"
00:01:21,00:01:22,and then Cobra the snake.
00:01:22,00:01:24,"It's a brilliant book, go get it."
00:01:24,00:01:27,"And to get it, you should go on the internet,"
00:01:27,00:01:29,"where you can buy books,"
00:01:29,00:01:31,"or you should go to a bookshop where you can also buy books,"
00:01:31,00:01:34,and just ask for Mickey and the Animal Spies.
00:01:34,00:01:37,"- By Anne Miller, who joins us on today's show,"
00:01:37,00:01:39,"so let's get to it, on with the episode."
00:01:39,00:01:42,(upbeat music)
00:01:42,00:01:45,(upbeat music)
00:01:45,00:01:57,"- Hello, and welcome to another episode"
00:01:57,00:01:59,"of ""No Such Thing as a Fish"","
00:01:59,00:02:00,a weekly podcast coming to you
00:02:00,00:02:03,from the QI offices in Covent Garden.
00:02:03,00:02:06,"My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here"
00:02:06,00:02:09,"with Anna Chazinski, Andrew Hunter Murray, and Anne Miller,"
00:02:09,00:02:12,"and once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:02:12,00:02:15,"with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,"
00:02:15,00:02:18,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:02:18,00:02:22,"Starting with fact number one, and that is Anne."
00:02:22,00:02:26,- My fact is that even the dust at GCHQ is classified.
00:02:26,00:02:28,(laughing)
00:02:28,00:02:29,- So what does this mean?
00:02:29,00:02:32,"- So I went to a great exhibition on at the Science Museum,"
00:02:32,00:02:34,"which is 100 years of GCHQ,"
00:02:34,00:02:35,and they've got things that they've never been seen before.
00:02:35,00:02:38,And one of the facts I found there is that
00:02:38,00:02:40,"when they have things need to be taken out of service,"
00:02:40,00:02:42,"and machines, paperwork, things like that,"
00:02:42,00:02:44,"it gets ground down to become electronic waste,"
00:02:44,00:02:46,"and it's dust, but it's certified,"
00:02:46,00:02:47,"so I can't just go in the bin,"
00:02:47,00:02:49,"because it's so, so, so secret what they've ground up,"
00:02:49,00:02:52,even the ground up stuff is secret.
00:02:52,00:02:53,(laughing)
00:02:53,00:02:55,"- So they dispose of it really securely somewhere, do they?"
00:02:55,00:02:57,- They do not discuss how they dispose of it.
00:02:57,00:02:57,(laughing)
00:02:57,00:02:59,- Can you imagine being a double agent
00:02:59,00:03:01,"and going to the Russians and go,"
00:03:01,00:03:03,"""I've got my hands on, it's classified."""
00:03:03,00:03:04,- It does.
00:03:04,00:03:06,"- Yeah, and you show them the dust."
00:03:06,00:03:07,I don't think they'd be happy.
00:03:07,00:03:08,I don't think they'd consider it classified.
00:03:08,00:03:11,"- Well, they might, because another thing I found"
00:03:11,00:03:14,at the museum was these things called microdots.
00:03:14,00:03:16,"So this is very tiny coded messages,"
00:03:16,00:03:17,so it would look like it's like a little
00:03:17,00:03:19,"very small polka dot print,"
00:03:19,00:03:21,"and when you bring out a lens, it will magnify it,"
00:03:21,00:03:23,and you can read like I saw Anna on the bridge
00:03:23,00:03:25,"at two o'clock, the meter five or something."
00:03:25,00:03:27,"So the dust, they get very, very small,"
00:03:27,00:03:30,"and they're still very, very secret, so everything is."
00:03:30,00:03:32,"- If you're wearing a polka dot dress, for example,"
00:03:32,00:03:35,"and you know that one of the dots is the microdot,"
00:03:35,00:03:37,you have to remember really carefully which one it is.
00:03:37,00:03:39,- The best place to hide something is
00:03:39,00:03:40,where lots of things look the same.
00:03:40,00:03:41,- Yeah.
00:03:41,00:03:42,- Sounds like a great exhibition.
00:03:42,00:03:46,"- We've got dust, we've got tiny dots you can't read."
00:03:46,00:03:49,- I've got tons of machines as well.
00:03:49,00:03:51,"- I just like the idea, is it like the hardest jigsaw"
00:03:51,00:03:53,you've ever done piecing the dust back together?
00:03:53,00:03:55,"Do you think you collect the dust,"
00:03:55,00:03:58,"spew it on the floor, and then have to put it back in order?"
00:03:58,00:04:01,"- I suspect that you can't repeat the dust now,"
00:04:01,00:04:03,but maybe you could one day.
00:04:03,00:04:06,"- So the worst Ikea assembling, isn't it?"
00:04:06,00:04:10,"- We've got you a computer, it is a dust war."
00:04:10,00:04:14,- So this is not the first time that this kind of rubbish
00:04:14,00:04:16,has been useful in espionage.
00:04:16,00:04:20,"So during the Cold War, there was an operation called Tamarisk,"
00:04:20,00:04:21,if you guys heard of this.
00:04:21,00:04:23,"So the USA and the UK and France,"
00:04:23,00:04:27,"they all had military liaisons in East Germany,"
00:04:27,00:04:29,and the Soviets were allowed some in West Germany.
00:04:29,00:04:31,So it was supposed to be a way of lowering tensions
00:04:31,00:04:34,"by having a bit of representation on either side,"
00:04:34,00:04:36,but basically it just turned into legalized espionage
00:04:36,00:04:39,"'cause obviously people sent spies to do that,"
00:04:39,00:04:40,to work in those missions.
00:04:40,00:04:42,And the Western officers launched this operation
00:04:42,00:04:46,"where they would gather up paper from Soviet bins,"
00:04:46,00:04:49,and sometimes they had to gather up used toilet paper
00:04:49,00:04:51,because a lot of people would not give
00:04:51,00:04:53,"a toilet paper in the Soviet mission,"
00:04:53,00:04:55,or on the Soviet side.
00:04:55,00:04:59,"So they would use confidential paper as toilet paper,"
00:04:59,00:05:02,and then the Western spies had to go through
00:05:02,00:05:05,"gathering pooey paper from bins basically,"
00:05:05,00:05:08,which had classified information on it.
00:05:08,00:05:08,"- That's useful though,"
00:05:08,00:05:11,'cause you can also report back on their diets.
00:05:11,00:05:12,- Yeah. - Yeah.
00:05:12,00:05:14,- You can call the information you possibly want.
00:05:14,00:05:15,- Yeah.
00:05:15,00:05:16,"- Yeah, and it was one of the most successful operations"
00:05:16,00:05:19,of the whole Cold War was gathering information
00:05:19,00:05:21,from pooey bins.
00:05:21,00:05:22,(laughing)
00:05:22,00:05:23,"- But I think part of the thing is you don't,"
00:05:23,00:05:25,"like there's so much work in, you know,"
00:05:25,00:05:27,"making things secret, but there's other things you give away"
00:05:27,00:05:30,"just by your choice of toilet paper, or your dust,"
00:05:30,00:05:31,and you've got to be--
00:05:31,00:05:32,- Really?
00:05:32,00:05:34,"- Yeah, they all like scented toilet paper."
00:05:34,00:05:35,"They must have, you know,"
00:05:35,00:05:36,scented tastes.
00:05:36,00:05:38,(laughing)
00:05:38,00:05:39,Is that a useful thing to know?
00:05:39,00:05:40,- Sure.
00:05:40,00:05:42,"- It's just what shops you might find, then."
00:05:42,00:05:43,(laughing)
00:05:43,00:05:46,- Did you know that GCHQ was not recognized officially
00:05:46,00:05:47,until 1994?
00:05:47,00:05:48,- Yeah.
00:05:48,00:05:50,"- So it was bizarre, GCHQ and MI5,"
00:05:50,00:05:52,"until there was, like, an official acknowledgement,"
00:05:52,00:05:54,"there was a parliamentary act, which basically said,"
00:05:54,00:05:55,what its role should be.
00:05:55,00:05:57,"Basically, all anyone knew was from me"
00:05:57,00:05:58,in Fleming and John LeCarrie.
00:05:58,00:05:59,- Yeah.
00:05:59,00:06:00,"And whenever a bone film comes out,"
00:06:00,00:06:03,recruitment applications peak at GCHQ.
00:06:03,00:06:05,"- Yeah, that might say, 'cause everyone's like,"
00:06:05,00:06:06,"""Oh, give that a go."""
00:06:06,00:06:07,- Even though they said that James Bond
00:06:07,00:06:09,"wouldn't get a job there, haven't they?"
00:06:09,00:06:09,"- Yeah, why?"
00:06:09,00:06:11,- 'Cause reading alcoholic.
00:06:11,00:06:13,- And also not emotionally intelligent.
00:06:13,00:06:14,- Oh.
00:06:14,00:06:15,- Which is fair enough.
00:06:15,00:06:16,"- So I was reading an article,"
00:06:16,00:06:18,"which was like an inside GCHQ,"
00:06:18,00:06:19,which I love this stuff.
00:06:19,00:06:20,- There's not that much in them
00:06:20,00:06:22,because they can't tell you that much.
00:06:22,00:06:23,"But the article was in the FT,"
00:06:23,00:06:26,"and it interviewed the head of GCHQ,"
00:06:26,00:06:28,"who's called Jeremy Fleming,"
00:06:28,00:06:30,"as an Ian Fleming,"
00:06:30,00:06:31,and the article was written
00:06:31,00:06:35,"by the FT security editor, David Bond."
00:06:35,00:06:36,- Oh God.
00:06:36,00:06:37,- Oh God.
00:06:37,00:06:40,- What is the argument to terminism to the mat?
00:06:40,00:06:45,- Do you know that the head of IT at GCHQ is AI?
00:06:45,00:06:46,- What?
00:06:46,00:06:47,"- Okay, that's not true, it turns out."
00:06:47,00:06:48,I met Red the article.
00:06:48,00:06:50,"It's a guy called Al, but it looks like AI,"
00:06:50,00:06:51,when you read it.
00:06:51,00:06:52,- I'll run by a robot.
00:06:52,00:06:54,- But what's interesting about him is he's dyslexic.
00:06:54,00:06:56,"He's the head of IT, and he's dyslexic."
00:06:56,00:06:58,And I was reading this in an article.
00:06:58,00:06:59,"- His name is actually LA, isn't it?"
00:06:59,00:07:00,(laughing)
00:07:00,00:07:02,- So this is an article.
00:07:02,00:07:03,"- Written in the Times,"
00:07:03,00:07:06,"a journalist was allowed into GCHQ to do this article,"
00:07:06,00:07:09,"and it was very funny because they had,"
00:07:09,00:07:10,"as the journalist went in,"
00:07:10,00:07:11,"all these A4 bits of paper,"
00:07:11,00:07:13,"blue tack to walls, saying caution,"
00:07:13,00:07:15,"journalist interview,"
00:07:15,00:07:17,keep all conversations too official.
00:07:17,00:07:18,(laughing)
00:07:18,00:07:20,"And everywhere this journalist went,"
00:07:20,00:07:20,that's where they saw.
00:07:20,00:07:22,But they were doing an article about
00:07:22,00:07:24,the neurodiversity program at GCHQ.
00:07:24,00:07:26,So there are 300 men and women there
00:07:26,00:07:30,"who all have dyslexia or autism or aspergers,"
00:07:30,00:07:32,"and face blindness, for example."
00:07:32,00:07:34,"So there's one lady who works there,"
00:07:34,00:07:36,"who's a former chemist called Jill,"
00:07:36,00:07:38,and she's their intelligence analysis.
00:07:38,00:07:41,"She can do that, and she's ahead of it."
00:07:41,00:07:44,But she struggles to recognize her employer's face
00:07:44,00:07:46,"who she's worked with for eight years,"
00:07:46,00:07:48,because of the face blindness disease that she has.
00:07:48,00:07:50,So it's an extraordinary article
00:07:50,00:07:51,about the people that they hire there.
00:07:51,00:07:52,- I read one as well.
00:07:52,00:07:54,"And they said, ""I don't listen for the day,"""
00:07:54,00:07:56,"and like Dan was going to be careful what they say,"
00:07:56,00:07:58,and someone was told that he was allowed to go
00:07:58,00:07:59,"around the building, and that was fine."
00:07:59,00:08:01,"He's allowed to go in for like six days,"
00:08:01,00:08:02,but he wasn't allowed to go into the canteen
00:08:02,00:08:04,where people may be discussing things informally.
00:08:04,00:08:05,(laughing)
00:08:05,00:08:08,"- Yes, but the fire in his vine for the canteen."
00:08:08,00:08:10,"- Just start him out, basically, eventually."
00:08:10,00:08:11,"- No, yeah."
00:08:11,00:08:13,"- And that's part of the thing with the baristas, isn't it?"
00:08:13,00:08:14,- Oh yeah.
00:08:14,00:08:15,"- Like they have a Costa coffee, and they're the coffee shop"
00:08:15,00:08:17,"in GCHQ as well, and they have to go"
00:08:17,00:08:18,under a regular spy training.
00:08:18,00:08:20,'Cause it's not like a regular.
00:08:20,00:08:22,"You can't just, like, - Yeah, that's really funny."
00:08:22,00:08:23,- You've got different levels of security.
00:08:23,00:08:24,You need to be able to pass.
00:08:24,00:08:26,"- You can write 007 on the side of the cup,"
00:08:26,00:08:27,and so is that 001?
00:08:27,00:08:29,- Completely different age and person's hand up.
00:08:29,00:08:31,I just blown two agents cover right there.
00:08:31,00:08:32,(laughing)
00:08:32,00:08:34,"- They did have a building in London,"
00:08:34,00:08:38,which they ran for 66 years and never acknowledged
00:08:38,00:08:40,until they just left.
00:08:40,00:08:43,"They left the last year, and it was apparently intentionally"
00:08:43,00:08:45,"boring, you know, it was designed to look"
00:08:45,00:08:47,just like a really drab office block.
00:08:47,00:08:49,This and James' Park actually is where it is.
00:08:49,00:08:51,"Anyway, they moved out in 2019, and then they said,"
00:08:51,00:08:53,"""Ah, it was GCHQ, all along."""
00:08:53,00:08:56,"But the BBC, the BBC sent some reporters"
00:08:56,00:08:58,"to ask people in the area,"
00:08:58,00:08:59,"""What do you think that building was?"""
00:08:59,00:09:01,"And they said, ""Oh, it's the spies, isn't it?"""
00:09:01,00:09:02,(laughing)
00:09:02,00:09:03,"""Am I sick, secret service?"""
00:09:03,00:09:05,"""It's something they're all spies, anyway."""
00:09:05,00:09:05,"- Every day, they were going in,"
00:09:05,00:09:07,"like, with their trench coats on, and they're"
00:09:07,00:09:08,(laughing)
00:09:08,00:09:09,- So that lasted.
00:09:09,00:09:10,- Magnifying glass.
00:09:10,00:09:11,(laughing)
00:09:11,00:09:15,- You're having your book launch in a spy building.
00:09:15,00:09:17,- In the original GCHQ building.
00:09:17,00:09:20,"- Yeah, so I've been, when I walk on my lunch break,"
00:09:20,00:09:21,"I walk past this building, and you sort of look around"
00:09:21,00:09:23,"at the plaques, and we're looking for facts,"
00:09:23,00:09:25,"and there was a plaque on the wall that said,"
00:09:25,00:09:27,it was the original home of GCHQ.
00:09:27,00:09:28,"They only unveiled the plaque, I think, last year."
00:09:28,00:09:30,"The clique of Queen came to unveil it for the centenary,"
00:09:30,00:09:31,and here's the best bit.
00:09:31,00:09:33,"They're hidden messages on the plaque,"
00:09:33,00:09:34,because it's the GCHQ.
00:09:34,00:09:34,- Oh!
00:09:34,00:09:35,"- Like, no one."
00:09:35,00:09:36,- Yes.
00:09:36,00:09:37,- What was so great?
00:09:37,00:09:38,- I don't know.
00:09:38,00:09:40,"- Oh, they've just told you there's a hidden message,"
00:09:40,00:09:41,but can we go and find it?
00:09:41,00:09:42,- We need to go and find it.
00:09:42,00:09:43,I actually don't know what it is.
00:09:43,00:09:45,"I've been walking past that plaque many times,"
00:09:45,00:09:46,"I never thought to look for a code,"
00:09:46,00:09:47,and now I'm trying to go a lunch break.
00:09:47,00:09:48,"- Yeah, I think we should."
00:09:48,00:09:49,"- I love the fact that you say,"
00:09:49,00:09:50,"you wander around looking at plaques,"
00:09:50,00:09:51,"looking at your eye facts,"
00:09:51,00:09:53,we're never off the clock here.
00:09:53,00:09:54,"- Oh, it's a bunch of things."
00:09:54,00:09:55,The overnight lunch break clear my head.
00:09:55,00:09:56,Oh.
00:09:56,00:10:00,- We're gonna have to move on in a sec to my next fact.
00:10:00,00:10:02,"- Just about the actual recruitment process,"
00:10:02,00:10:03,and what it takes.
00:10:03,00:10:04,It's quite fun to read about.
00:10:04,00:10:06,So the initial interview that you get for GCHQ
00:10:06,00:10:09,"is designed to test your knowledge of technical subjects,"
00:10:09,00:10:10,such as how a smartphone works.
00:10:10,00:10:13,"So I wouldn't pass that phase, but many do."
00:10:13,00:10:16,"And then you get this interrogation about your private life,"
00:10:16,00:10:18,"and often you just out of university,"
00:10:18,00:10:21,and they interrogate you basically about your sexual history.
00:10:21,00:10:23,"And so one of the girls who joined,"
00:10:23,00:10:25,"I think she was 22 at the time,"
00:10:25,00:10:26,she had the vetting officer knew more about me
00:10:26,00:10:28,than anyone else alive.
00:10:28,00:10:30,"And you know, you have to discuss everyone,"
00:10:30,00:10:31,"you've ever shacked with them,"
00:10:31,00:10:33,"and all of your friends and family,"
00:10:33,00:10:36,"you get drug tested, so you get a bit of hair clipped off."
00:10:36,00:10:38,This seems like a real oversight.
00:10:38,00:10:39,"For instance, one person got this done,"
00:10:39,00:10:40,"went to the hairdresser the next week,"
00:10:40,00:10:42,"and the hairdresser was like,"
00:10:42,00:10:43,"oh my god, you've got this random bull patch"
00:10:43,00:10:44,on the back of your head.
00:10:44,00:10:46,And then you've got to come up with a cover story.
00:10:46,00:10:48,"They're like, oh yeah, just trying it out."
00:10:48,00:10:51,That's probably your first test as a sponsor.
00:10:51,00:10:52,That's another reason why James Bond
00:10:52,00:10:54,"probably wouldn't get in as a spy, actually,"
00:10:54,00:10:56,because the interview process to discuss
00:10:56,00:10:59,everyone he'd ever slept with is still going on.
00:10:59,00:11:02,"He's still there, he's in a room somewhere."
00:11:02,00:11:04,"I read a piece of somebody who does recruitment for MI5,"
00:11:04,00:11:07,"just known as Joe, and they basically explained"
00:11:07,00:11:08,that some candidates who come
00:11:08,00:11:10,have got some strange ideas for what actually
00:11:10,00:11:11,the job involves because of James Bond.
00:11:11,00:11:12,"I guess people are really scared to take this,"
00:11:12,00:11:14,that's not what the job is like.
00:11:14,00:11:15,And some of the questions Joe was asked
00:11:15,00:11:18,"included, do I have to wear my own clothes to work?"
00:11:18,00:11:20,Should I wear a disguise instead?
00:11:20,00:11:22,And do I need to dump my partner to work here?
00:11:22,00:11:23,"Because if I do, I will."
00:11:23,00:11:26,[LAUGHTER]
00:11:26,00:11:32,"OK, it's time for fact number two, and that is Andy."
00:11:32,00:11:35,My fact is that people drive more carefully
00:11:35,00:11:38,if they have a pavlova in the car than their own child.
00:11:38,00:11:40,[LAUGHTER]
00:11:40,00:11:42,So this is an experiment that was done.
00:11:42,00:11:44,"It was a survey done, slightly as a PR stunt,"
00:11:44,00:11:46,by an insurance firm in Australia.
00:11:46,00:11:48,They asked drivers about their behavior.
00:11:48,00:11:51,"First of all, they just said, what makes you drive more carefully?"
00:11:51,00:11:53,Would you drive more carefully if your child was in the car?
00:11:53,00:11:56,"Half of all parents surveyed said, yes, absolutely."
00:11:56,00:11:58,Only 12% of those people said they would be more cautious
00:11:58,00:12:00,if they were driving a pavlova around.
00:12:00,00:12:03,"Pavlova, and a rang, and cream-based pudding."
00:12:03,00:12:04,Yeah.
00:12:04,00:12:05,"OK, good."
00:12:05,00:12:07,And a child is a smaller version of a person.
00:12:07,00:12:09,"Anyway, they tested it with a small sample,"
00:12:09,00:12:11,"admittedly, only 20 drivers."
00:12:11,00:12:12,"But over an eight-day period, they"
00:12:12,00:12:17,"were asked to drive alone, with a child, and with a pavlova."
00:12:17,00:12:20,"95% of them, 19 out of 20, drove more carefully"
00:12:20,00:12:23,"with a pavlova on board, which was way more"
00:12:23,00:12:24,than were more careful with their children.
00:12:24,00:12:27,And what did the school say when they dropped off a pavlova
00:12:27,00:12:29,at school when they didn't have the time?
00:12:29,00:12:30,Nobody noticed the difference.
00:12:30,00:12:31,Very impressive.
00:12:31,00:12:32,I think it makes sense.
00:12:32,00:12:33,It makes perfect sense.
00:12:33,00:12:36,"Daniel, the one who's got a child, that's slightly worried."
00:12:36,00:12:37,That's true.
00:12:37,00:12:39,"Why do you think it makes sense, or do you have to explain that?"
00:12:39,00:12:41,"Well, if you've had anything in the back of a car,"
00:12:41,00:12:44,"that is of a sensitive nature, of course,"
00:12:44,00:12:46,you're going to take corners less sharply of this.
00:12:46,00:12:47,Of course.
00:12:47,00:12:48,Of course.
00:12:48,00:12:49,Babies are very resilient.
00:12:49,00:12:52,"Well, you can't put a seatbelt around a pavlova."
00:12:52,00:12:55,You could probably get it some sort of transportation device.
00:12:55,00:12:57,"Like, almost cupcake carriers, but with a belt."
00:12:57,00:12:57,You can see it.
00:12:57,00:12:59,"Yeah, that's true."
00:12:59,00:13:01,So maybe this solves all the driving issues
00:13:01,00:13:03,"that we have in the world, just anyone who's"
00:13:03,00:13:05,"a bit of a dangerous driver, pop a pavlova in the back."
00:13:05,00:13:08,And we're just going to solve everything.
00:13:08,00:13:11,"I am looking at more Australian studies about drivers,"
00:13:11,00:13:14,"and one was about how people, when they first get their license,"
00:13:14,00:13:15,"are very cautious, very careful."
00:13:15,00:13:18,"And as we drive them for longer, some people are more distracted."
00:13:18,00:13:20,"We start some people, some people start"
00:13:20,00:13:22,to see it as time taken out of their day.
00:13:22,00:13:23,So what they did was they parked by a road
00:13:23,00:13:25,and they took photos of anyone they saw
00:13:25,00:13:27,doing on correct procedure.
00:13:27,00:13:31,"And pictures they got included people eating cereal at the wheel,"
00:13:31,00:13:33,brushing their hair and reading books.
00:13:33,00:13:33,Wow.
00:13:33,00:13:35,Driving around Australia.
00:13:35,00:13:36,That's what it says.
00:13:36,00:13:37,That's speed reading.
00:13:37,00:13:38,I mean.
00:13:38,00:13:39,Yeah.
00:13:39,00:13:42,Did you guys know there's no safety difference
00:13:42,00:13:45,between using a phone while you're driving a handheld phone
00:13:45,00:13:46,and a hands-free phone?
00:13:46,00:13:46,Really?
00:13:46,00:13:47,Yeah.
00:13:47,00:13:48,So I actually learned this.
00:13:48,00:13:49,"I went to a magic show at the Welcome Center,"
00:13:49,00:13:50,and it was about--
00:13:50,00:13:52,[LAUGHTER]
00:13:52,00:13:55,I have fact check this afterwards.
00:13:55,00:13:57,It was about the science of misdirection
00:13:57,00:13:59,and the fact that we don't notice things
00:13:59,00:14:01,and the fact that we can be so easily distracted.
00:14:01,00:14:03,"And study after study has found that if you're on a phone,"
00:14:03,00:14:05,you're four times more likely to be involved in an accident
00:14:05,00:14:08,completely regardless of whether it's handheld or hands-free.
00:14:08,00:14:12,"And it's just because it's the concentration that's distracted,"
00:14:12,00:14:14,not your actual hand.
00:14:14,00:14:15,"And so it found that, for instance, specifically,"
00:14:15,00:14:18,"if you're on the phone and someone on the phone says,"
00:14:18,00:14:21,"oh, do you remember where you put the bananas or whatever?"
00:14:21,00:14:22,And you have to find--
00:14:22,00:14:22,Yeah.
00:14:22,00:14:24,We're going to need to slice them up for the path over.
00:14:24,00:14:25,What do you want?
00:14:25,00:14:27,"Then you're at your heads and your kitchen,"
00:14:27,00:14:29,"rather than your head and your kitchen,"
00:14:29,00:14:32,"not literally, but, metaphorically."
00:14:32,00:14:34,And that apparently reduces your field of vision
00:14:34,00:14:35,to about a quarter.
00:14:35,00:14:37,"Your field of vision that you can concentrate on to about a quarter,"
00:14:37,00:14:39,if you imagine that other place?
00:14:39,00:14:41,I was looking into a few road safety things as well.
00:14:41,00:14:46,"So this was for pedestrians, rather than for how you drive safely."
00:14:46,00:14:50,"There was one idea that was put forward back in the 1930s,"
00:14:50,00:14:52,"which didn't, unfortunately, happen."
00:14:52,00:14:54,But I love the idea of it.
00:14:54,00:14:56,So imagine you hit by a car.
00:14:56,00:14:57,And the car does a hit and run.
00:14:57,00:14:58,Disappears on you.
00:14:58,00:15:00,"Cars, and we're going to be designed"
00:15:00,00:15:03,with this little disc that shoots out of the car
00:15:03,00:15:06,"when a hit and run happens so that the person, if they were"
00:15:06,00:15:09,"so knocked out, they couldn't see the license plate or anything."
00:15:09,00:15:12,"Grab the disc, which has the details of the owner of the car."
00:15:12,00:15:14,That's a great idea.
00:15:14,00:15:15,"Yeah, and they never implemented it."
00:15:15,00:15:16,I don't know why.
00:15:16,00:15:19,"Possibly, maybe the disc might have decapitated."
00:15:19,00:15:22,Someone has shot out of the car.
00:15:22,00:15:27,"Just involuntary business car dispersal, basically."
00:15:27,00:15:31,I like this weird gadget that was added to Volvo's actually.
00:15:31,00:15:33,"In 2007, it was a car safety thing."
00:15:33,00:15:35,It was a smart key.
00:15:35,00:15:36,"It was a remote smart key, which we have now."
00:15:36,00:15:39,So you can open your car from 100 yards away or whatever.
00:15:39,00:15:43,And it contained a highly sensitive heartbeat sensor.
00:15:43,00:15:44,It advertised itself as a world first.
00:15:44,00:15:46,"And that meant that when you went to unlock your car,"
00:15:46,00:15:49,it told you if there was somebody hiding in it.
00:15:49,00:15:50,Hide it.
00:15:50,00:15:51,"Yeah, that's right."
00:15:51,00:15:51,It flashed.
00:15:51,00:15:53,"So if you have 50 yards in your car, you unlocked it."
00:15:53,00:15:55,"It would give you a little flash to say,"
00:15:55,00:15:58,"there's a person in there, get your weapons out."
00:15:58,00:16:00,"Really, distinguish, like, human from like Volvo."
00:16:00,00:16:02,"No, it's specified."
00:16:02,00:16:03,It will tell if there's a human or an animal.
00:16:03,00:16:07,So you wouldn't know if it was just a mouse scottling around.
00:16:07,00:16:08,Or a person hiding in your boots.
00:16:08,00:16:09,Yeah.
00:16:09,00:16:10,"Better safe than sorry, though."
00:16:10,00:16:13,But that's never a thing that I've ever thought to check.
00:16:13,00:16:16,"Well, it's a good way of making your extremely paranoid"
00:16:16,00:16:17,now when you get into your car.
00:16:17,00:16:20,"But you know there's always that thing where you're driving,"
00:16:20,00:16:21,where you have this panic that you're
00:16:21,00:16:22,going to look in the rearview mirror
00:16:22,00:16:24,and you'll see someone rising up behind you.
00:16:24,00:16:26,"That's the movie, right?"
00:16:26,00:16:28,"I've never had that, and I think you got that."
00:16:28,00:16:29,"Yeah, of course."
00:16:29,00:16:31,Every time you're driving on your own at night.
00:16:31,00:16:32,No.
00:16:32,00:16:34,"I don't know the car, it's tapping isn't what you've got to watch for."
00:16:34,00:16:35,"Oh, wow."
00:16:35,00:16:37,That was a ghost story when I was a kid.
00:16:37,00:16:37,OK.
00:16:37,00:16:41,"Do you have a big rug on your back seat, which could cover a murder?"
00:16:41,00:16:43,Just remove the rug.
00:16:43,00:16:45,"Well, it might be, I think we've mentioned this,"
00:16:45,00:16:48,"but when the Berlin Wall, when people were trying to get across,"
00:16:48,00:16:52,there was that couple where the lady who shouldn't have gone across
00:16:52,00:16:54,was sewn into the seat of the car.
00:16:54,00:16:55,"Oh, yeah."
00:16:55,00:16:57,So that's another spot you got to worry about.
00:16:57,00:16:58,"Yeah, check inside the seat."
00:16:58,00:17:00,Check inside your seats.
00:17:00,00:17:01,Check underneath the big rug.
00:17:01,00:17:04,"If you didn't spot him on the roof or where you got in,"
00:17:04,00:17:05,that's your own problem.
00:17:05,00:17:11,"This study that you were mentioning, Andy,"
00:17:11,00:17:13,"this was done in Australia, right?"
00:17:13,00:17:13,Yeah.
00:17:13,00:17:14,Yeah.
00:17:14,00:17:18,"And so, Australia is very proud of Pavlova, because we invented it."
00:17:18,00:17:22,Been a lot of dispute with the New Zealanders about who invented it.
00:17:22,00:17:26,"And then I learned, neither of us did, it turns out it's German."
00:17:26,00:17:27,Is the latest theory.
00:17:27,00:17:30,I love that there's theories of Pavlova origin.
00:17:30,00:17:31,Nice.
00:17:31,00:17:33,"So what, what, what, what's the German origin?"
00:17:33,00:17:36,"It's named after Anna Pavlova, the ballerina,"
00:17:36,00:17:38,because she was touring in Australia and New Zealand
00:17:38,00:17:40,at the same time in the late 20s.
00:17:40,00:17:43,So that's why both countries think they invented it.
00:17:43,00:17:46,"But really, there had been Pavlova style recipes,"
00:17:46,00:17:49,"you know, you need burang and cream and fruit"
00:17:49,00:17:50,since the 18th century in Germany.
00:17:50,00:17:54,"So one of them was called a ""shown taught"" or ""foam cake""."
00:17:54,00:17:57,"And another one was called ""Spanish wind taught""."
00:17:57,00:18:01,So they had the thing that just didn't call it Pavlova.
00:18:01,00:18:04,"I don't know if I'd put the word ""wind"" in a recipe now,"
00:18:04,00:18:07,just unless it was sort of a bean recipe or something.
00:18:07,00:18:11,"She apparently, Anna Pavlova, had more food, named after her."
00:18:11,00:18:13,"The only one that I could find was frog legs,"
00:18:13,00:18:14,Ella Pavlova.
00:18:14,00:18:15,Is it because she was a ballerina?
00:18:15,00:18:16,"Yeah, frog legs had legs."
00:18:16,00:18:19,"Yeah, well, it was famous for having good legs."
00:18:19,00:18:22,Famously known as what people have legs.
00:18:22,00:18:25,"You know, so she was an excellent ballerina, not just a ballerina."
00:18:25,00:18:29,"It's so good and so popular that when she died in 1931,"
00:18:29,00:18:32,"when she died of pneumonia, and in fact, when she died,"
00:18:32,00:18:35,"she was diagnosed with pneumonia, told she'd have to have an operation."
00:18:35,00:18:37,That would mean she could never dance again.
00:18:37,00:18:39,"And she said no, I'd rather be dead."
00:18:39,00:18:41,So she died in 1931 of pneumonia.
00:18:41,00:18:44,"And the next show that she was scheduled to do, the audience came,"
00:18:44,00:18:46,and they put a spotlight on an empty stage
00:18:46,00:18:48,and the spotlight followed around exactly where she would have been.
00:18:48,00:18:51,"And they just watched that and said, ""Isn't that cool?"""
00:18:51,00:18:53,"That's cool. Not a good excuse to die, though."
00:18:53,00:18:55,"The whole dancing thing, I would say."
00:18:55,00:18:57,"Well, if it's the one thing you love."
00:18:57,00:19:00,"If I came back home and said they were like, ""Dan, you got pneumonia."""
00:19:00,00:19:03,"""We'll give you an operation, but it means you can't podcast anymore."""
00:19:03,00:19:06,"I think Fonella would have an issue if I said, actually."
00:19:06,00:19:07,Send me to the grave.
00:19:07,00:19:09,I'd love for you to have that operation.
00:19:09,00:19:11,I just think for myself.
00:19:11,00:19:17,"OK, it is time for fact number three, and that is my fact."
00:19:17,00:19:20,My fact this week is that Ringo Starr's grandmother
00:19:20,00:19:25,performed exorcisms on him to cure him from being left-handed.
00:19:25,00:19:25,Wow.
00:19:25,00:19:28,"She reported to child services, or was that that was before?"
00:19:28,00:19:29,It's a different time.
00:19:29,00:19:30,Different time.
00:19:30,00:19:31,Did it work?
00:19:31,00:19:32,"It did, yeah."
00:19:32,00:19:33,"Oh, yeah, yeah."
00:19:33,00:19:35,"Well, for many years it did."
00:19:35,00:19:38,Because I thought that he said in one interview that he plays
00:19:38,00:19:40,"with the right-handed drum kit, but he sort of leads with his left hand."
00:19:40,00:19:41,Yes.
00:19:41,00:19:42,He does most other things left-handed.
00:19:42,00:19:43,"Yeah, exactly."
00:19:43,00:19:44,Doesn't look like it partially works.
00:19:44,00:19:47,"Maybe by exorcisms, she actually just bought him the right-handed drum kit."
00:19:47,00:19:49,I think that's why exorcisms will be easier for her.
00:19:49,00:19:51,Why am she going around doing exorcisms?
00:19:51,00:19:55,"So Ringo Starr's grandmother, Annie Bauer, she was born in 1889."
00:19:55,00:19:59,"She was known in Liverpool as the voodoo queen of Liverpool,"
00:19:59,00:20:00,certainly within the family.
00:20:00,00:20:01,That's what she was famous for.
00:20:01,00:20:04,And she was sort of known as a sort of 20th century witch.
00:20:04,00:20:06,She used to concoct her own remedies.
00:20:06,00:20:11,She would make potions when she was sort of looking after sick people.
00:20:11,00:20:13,She used to invoke Satan.
00:20:13,00:20:15,She used to try and expel Satan from people.
00:20:15,00:20:19,"So to bring him out, doing exorcisms on various people."
00:20:19,00:20:22,"And so when she saw that her grandson was left-handed,"
00:20:22,00:20:23,she thought that's the devil.
00:20:23,00:20:25,Left-handedness is associated with that.
00:20:25,00:20:25,I'm going to get rid of him.
00:20:25,00:20:28,"And she spent years of him, the devil."
00:20:28,00:20:29,"Oh, sorry."
00:20:29,00:20:30,"Yeah, sorry."
00:20:30,00:20:35,And so she spent ages trying to exercise it out of him.
00:20:35,00:20:39,But what's truly interesting about this is that Ringo says it's for this reason
00:20:39,00:20:43,that he developed what became the unique drumming style that he had
00:20:43,00:20:45,because he drums on a right-handed drum kit.
00:20:45,00:20:48,"But as a left-hander, it takes him just a split second more,"
00:20:48,00:20:51,like a tiny microsecond more to get to that bit of the drum.
00:20:51,00:20:53,And that gives him a sort of lazy drumming style
00:20:53,00:20:56,"that's slightly off time, which gives it a swing."
00:20:56,00:20:59,So the negative interpretation is that had he not been exercised
00:20:59,00:21:01,"as a child, he might have been a better drummer?"
00:21:01,00:21:03,"No, because he's an unbelievable drummer."
00:21:03,00:21:06,Unless a less unique drummer.
00:21:06,00:21:09,He's an incredible drummer.
00:21:09,00:21:11,"We should talk a bit about the book you've got this from, Dan,"
00:21:11,00:21:13,"because this is from a book called ""Is It Tune in?"""
00:21:13,00:21:14,Yeah.
00:21:14,00:21:16,"It's ""The Bography of the Beatles"" by Mark Lewison."
00:21:16,00:21:20,"This is an amazing book, because it's nearly 1,000 pages long"
00:21:20,00:21:21,and it ends in 1962.
00:21:21,00:21:22,Yeah.
00:21:22,00:21:24,End as they're releasing their first single.
00:21:24,00:21:28,"It is good to have that warning that it ends after 1,000 pages"
00:21:28,00:21:31,"just as they start, I think, before you embark on the book."
00:21:31,00:21:34,"It's like that when you're reading a novel, and it's sort of really crunchy,"
00:21:34,00:21:37,"and you're really near the end, and you're like, ""They can't wrap this whole app."""
00:21:37,00:21:40,"And you're like, ""No! Turn the pages to the end."
00:21:40,00:21:41,"What they're going to cover their whole career?"""
00:21:41,00:21:44,And then they did quite well the end.
00:21:44,00:21:48,"I like the fact that he found the first fan of the Beatles,"
00:21:48,00:21:48,tracked her down.
00:21:48,00:21:52,"She was an Irish woman called Pat Morin, who lived in Liverpool,"
00:21:52,00:21:56,"and there's another churchy devil connection here,"
00:21:56,00:21:58,because her father sent her to confession
00:21:58,00:22:01,for talking about the Beatles too much.
00:22:01,00:22:01,Cool.
00:22:01,00:22:03,Which apparently classified as a sin.
00:22:03,00:22:05,"God, you're clutching its straws if that's your sin."
00:22:05,00:22:07,You've got to start rebelling more.
00:22:07,00:22:12,"Well, they were all, because the Beatles had a very odd effect on girls"
00:22:12,00:22:14,in that period in the 1960s.
00:22:14,00:22:17,There was a book that came out about them that said John Lennon was told.
00:22:17,00:22:20,Girls in the audience were actively touching themselves
00:22:20,00:22:23,in the audience and orgasming while they were playing on stage.
00:22:23,00:22:24,They had this kind of craze.
00:22:24,00:22:25,And that was in the 1960s.
00:22:25,00:22:27,That's a very different world to what we...
00:22:27,00:22:29,I don't know. It was a liberated time.
00:22:29,00:22:30,Everyone was on air.
00:22:30,00:22:31,But they were the people liberating...
00:22:31,00:22:33,By causing a lot of public masturbation.
00:22:33,00:22:37,"So on the way people behaved around the Beatles,"
00:22:37,00:22:39,they had to be quite heavy security for them all the time.
00:22:39,00:22:43,"And in fact, they changed the way that the Japanese police operate."
00:22:43,00:22:46,So the Japanese police today were white gloves.
00:22:46,00:22:48,"So if you ever go to the pan using the police, they wear white gloves,"
00:22:48,00:22:50,and a lot of people have wondered why...
00:22:50,00:22:52,"It's a Michael Jackson tribute, isn't it?"
00:22:52,00:22:55,"And a lot of people think it's a Michael Jackson tribute,"
00:22:55,00:22:58,but actually a huge misconception.
00:22:58,00:23:00,The Beatles went there in 1966.
00:23:00,00:23:04,"And the police chief, who was responsible for the police force there,"
00:23:04,00:23:07,said that there had to be a layer of propriety added between the police
00:23:07,00:23:10,"and the women, they were inevitably going to be touching"
00:23:10,00:23:13,as they dragged them away kicking and screaming from the Beatles.
00:23:13,00:23:16,And so they all had to wear these white gloves.
00:23:16,00:23:19,"And he was interviewed in 2010, and he confirmed that."
00:23:19,00:23:22,"And it was to reinforce this thing called ""ragitadashisha"","
00:23:22,00:23:24,which is sort of a notion of propriety.
00:23:24,00:23:26,"But that's interesting, because I think the Japanese subways"
00:23:26,00:23:29,"famously very, very, very, very busy."
00:23:29,00:23:32,And they have people whose job it is to push people into the carriages
00:23:32,00:23:33,to make crown more people in.
00:23:33,00:23:34,And I'm pretty sure they wear white gloves.
00:23:34,00:23:36,So maybe it's a bit more polite rather than shoving you.
00:23:36,00:23:38,"I mean, officially shoving you."
00:23:38,00:23:41,But that move is where they get the song.
00:23:41,00:23:43,"In fact, that's where they got the inspiration for their song."
00:23:43,00:23:44,All you need is glove.
00:23:44,00:23:47,"Hmm, it's very strong."
00:23:47,00:23:49,"-Love me, dude. -Love me, dude."
00:23:49,00:23:50,"A lot of their songs have the word ""love"" in them."
00:23:50,00:23:52,-Let's go through the world. -Let's go through the world.
00:23:52,00:23:54,The glove album.
00:23:54,00:23:55,So the Hamburg days were extraordinary.
00:23:55,00:23:57,This is the two years before they basically
00:23:57,00:24:00,got into the charts in the very start of the '60s.
00:24:00,00:24:02,"And they lived in Hamburg, basically,"
00:24:02,00:24:04,in this storage room behind the stage
00:24:04,00:24:06,where they performed in this CD bar.
00:24:06,00:24:09,"And they sort of lived on fold-out beds,"
00:24:09,00:24:12,and they had to shower in the public bathrooms in the bar.
00:24:12,00:24:14,"And that's where they actually got spotted by George Martin,"
00:24:14,00:24:17,"I think, who basically sort of made the Beatles."
00:24:17,00:24:19,But he thought they were kind of crap in a lot of ways.
00:24:19,00:24:21,So he thought they couldn't write songs.
00:24:21,00:24:23,They were really keen to write their own songs.
00:24:23,00:24:25,And I think he wanted them to release a cover
00:24:25,00:24:28,"as their first kind of number one, or he intended."
00:24:28,00:24:30,And he said their songwriting was crap.
00:24:30,00:24:33,"The first records we issued were ""Love Me Do"" and ""P.S."""
00:24:33,00:24:36,"""I Love You,"" which are not exactly cold-pulsar, are they?"
00:24:36,00:24:38,"Which, actually, if you listen to this, it's fair enough."
00:24:38,00:24:40,"But yeah, he thought they were crap."
00:24:40,00:24:43,"When they were in Hamburg, they obviously"
00:24:43,00:24:44,were not making very much money at all.
00:24:44,00:24:46,I think they got £2.50 per show.
00:24:46,00:24:48,"And they had to do four shows on a weeknight,"
00:24:48,00:24:51,five on a Saturday and six on a Sunday.
00:24:51,00:24:53,It's like a Pantos catcher.
00:24:53,00:24:54,"Yeah, it really is."
00:24:54,00:24:56,And then they got offered from a rival club.
00:24:56,00:24:58,"And so the boss of the first club they'd been working at,"
00:24:58,00:25:02,reported George Harrison to the police and got him deported.
00:25:02,00:25:05,"And then, the same manager had already had it in for them."
00:25:05,00:25:07,"He got McCartney, I can't believe this."
00:25:07,00:25:09,He got McCartney and Pete Best arrested
00:25:09,00:25:11,and deported for setting fire to a condom.
00:25:11,00:25:15,"Oh, I don't understand why."
00:25:15,00:25:18,Surely it doesn't take two people to set fire to a condom.
00:25:18,00:25:20,"I want to hold a condom, I want to light the match."
00:25:20,00:25:23,I'm trying to light a match with one hand.
00:25:23,00:25:25,"We should say we're talking about their Hamburg days,"
00:25:25,00:25:27,but Ringo wasn't there for their Hamburg days.
00:25:27,00:25:29,So they were a five-man operation.
00:25:29,00:25:32,Many people say the superior version.
00:25:32,00:25:35,So that was with Pete Best and Stuart Zuckercliffe.
00:25:35,00:25:36,Yeah.
00:25:36,00:25:38,"Just on the fact, Pete Best left the Beatles"
00:25:38,00:25:40,and he didn't go on to anything major.
00:25:40,00:25:43,"So Ringo Starr, as well as the Beatles,"
00:25:43,00:25:46,his other big thing was he was the voice of Thomas the Tank Engine.
00:25:46,00:25:47,Series one.
00:25:47,00:25:49,And I found another sort of rock connection
00:25:49,00:25:53,of someone who left a band just before it got big.
00:25:53,00:25:54,And it relates to Thomas the Tank Engine.
00:25:54,00:25:58,Timothy Steffel was the lead singer of a band called Smile.
00:25:58,00:26:01,And then he left because he thought the band was going nowhere.
00:26:01,00:26:04,So the guitarist and the drummer brought in a new singer
00:26:04,00:26:05,called Freddie Mercury.
00:26:05,00:26:08,"And that band was Queen, obviously."
00:26:08,00:26:12,"And so Smile was Roger Taylor, Brian May, and Timothy Steffel."
00:26:12,00:26:13,Steffel left.
00:26:13,00:26:15,But he found a second career as a model maker
00:26:15,00:26:18,for all the trains on Thomas the Tank Engine.
00:26:18,00:26:19,"Oh, my God."
00:26:19,00:26:21,Ringo Starr.
00:26:21,00:26:22,That was incredible.
00:26:22,00:26:23,That's really cool.
00:26:23,00:26:25,Because the fact controller in Thomas the Tank Engine
00:26:25,00:26:29,was played by Bill Wyman after he left the Rolling Stone.
00:26:29,00:26:30,You're kidding.
00:26:30,00:26:31,"Yeah, I'm kidding."
00:26:31,00:26:33,Done for God's sake.
00:26:33,00:26:35,"Sorry, I was getting so excited."
00:26:35,00:26:36,I think it's time to come in three.
00:26:36,00:26:37,"Yeah, exactly."
00:26:37,00:26:39,There's probably probably is one more rock connection
00:26:39,00:26:41,to come up with the tank around the whereabouts.
00:26:41,00:26:42,"Listeners, find it."
00:26:42,00:26:46,Just one-- another thing about Ringo's life post Beatles.
00:26:46,00:26:47,Possibly the highlight of his career
00:26:47,00:26:50,was when he did a pizza advert in 1995.
00:26:50,00:26:51,"This was a seminal moment, because it"
00:26:51,00:26:55,was when the stuffed crust of Pizza Hut fame came into being.
00:26:55,00:26:58,And it was this great advert where he sort of threw out
00:26:58,00:27:00,the addy's pretending he was getting the band back together.
00:27:00,00:27:02,"And it's like, oh, I've got to convince them."
00:27:02,00:27:03,"Oh, they'll never do it."
00:27:03,00:27:03,Come on.
00:27:03,00:27:04,You should watch the advert.
00:27:04,00:27:05,Getting the band back together.
00:27:05,00:27:08,Lenin had been dead for 14 years at this point.
00:27:08,00:27:12,"Yeah, it was a sick advert, OK?"
00:27:12,00:27:14,So he makes us seem like he's going to resurrect John Lenin's
00:27:14,00:27:15,dead body.
00:27:15,00:27:17,Probably needed his grandmother for that.
00:27:17,00:27:20,[LAUGHTER]
00:27:20,00:27:23,"So he's in this advert saying, I'll get the band back together."
00:27:23,00:27:25,"Until it becomes clear at the end, what he's actually saying"
00:27:25,00:27:29,"is, I'm going to convince them all to eat pizza crust first."
00:27:29,00:27:31,And then there's this really awkward moment
00:27:31,00:27:33,"where in the final scene, his three apparent bandmates"
00:27:33,00:27:35,come on and start eating it crust first.
00:27:35,00:27:37,"Anyway, it's a humorous advert."
00:27:37,00:27:39,"The amusing thing is, he's never eaten a pizza in his life."
00:27:39,00:27:42,"He watched that advert as it goes towards his mouth,"
00:27:42,00:27:44,"the advert ends, because he's allergic to all"
00:27:44,00:27:45,the ingredients of pizza.
00:27:45,00:27:46,All the ingredients of pizza.
00:27:46,00:27:47,Every ingredient.
00:27:47,00:27:49,"He's allergic to onions, garlic, spices."
00:27:49,00:27:51,He's allergic to all this stuff.
00:27:51,00:27:53,"Never had a pizza, never had a curry."
00:27:53,00:27:54,We need to move on.
00:27:54,00:27:57,"I can just mention one last thing, and then we'll move on."
00:27:57,00:27:58,"And so Pete Bess, the original drummer."
00:27:58,00:28:01,"He was kicked out, which was devastating for him."
00:28:01,00:28:02,But he continued to be a musician
00:28:02,00:28:05,after he got over a bit of a depressive stage.
00:28:05,00:28:06,And he went on to release an album
00:28:06,00:28:10,"called Best of the Beatles, which a lot of people accidentally"
00:28:10,00:28:13,"bought, by mistake, thinking it was a compilation"
00:28:13,00:28:14,of the greatest hits.
00:28:14,00:28:15,Best of not the best of all.
00:28:15,00:28:16,Exactly.
00:28:16,00:28:17,He claimed the wrong word.
00:28:17,00:28:24,"OK, it is time for our final fact of the show."
00:28:24,00:28:26,And that is Juzinski.
00:28:26,00:28:28,My fact this week is that baby albatrosses
00:28:28,00:28:34,can take up to six days to peck their way out of their eggs.
00:28:34,00:28:37,Imagine being trapped somewhere in the dark six days.
00:28:37,00:28:38,It's like the Great Escape.
00:28:38,00:28:40,And this is called Pipping.
00:28:40,00:28:42,"So what happens is they've got the egg tooth, which"
00:28:42,00:28:44,"a lot of birds have, which is a sort of hard projection"
00:28:44,00:28:45,on their bills.
00:28:45,00:28:48,And they peck away at the shell from the inside.
00:28:48,00:28:51,"And on average, albatross chicks take about 3.5 days"
00:28:51,00:28:53,"to emerge, but some of them are weaker ones,"
00:28:53,00:28:55,"the thicker-shelled ones, they take up to a week"
00:28:55,00:28:57,to make their way out.
00:28:57,00:28:58,"That's interesting, yeah."
00:28:58,00:28:59,"And I think part of them will emerge,"
00:28:59,00:29:00,and they can sort of be fed.
00:29:00,00:29:03,So you do see eggs with sort of a head sticking out.
00:29:03,00:29:05,"And it's like you've gone on the couple of days left, mate."
00:29:05,00:29:07,"But if you're going to help them by feeding them,"
00:29:07,00:29:08,could you not help them open their egg?
00:29:08,00:29:11,You've got to let kids learn for themselves.
00:29:11,00:29:13,We're albatrosses to start.
00:29:13,00:29:15,"OK, time to fledge."
00:29:15,00:29:17,I'm not ready to fledge them in the egg.
00:29:17,00:29:20,"They sometimes lose their eggs, albatrosses."
00:29:20,00:29:22,So most of them keep them in a nest.
00:29:22,00:29:24,"And we should say there are 20 species of albatrosses,"
00:29:24,00:29:25,which I didn't like.
00:29:25,00:29:27,"But some of them waved albatrosses quite mobile,"
00:29:27,00:29:29,and they will move their egg around their territory
00:29:29,00:29:31,with them as they go.
00:29:31,00:29:33,And frequently they just lose them.
00:29:33,00:29:36,So 80% of the anguish don't hatch are because they get lost.
00:29:36,00:29:36,Really?
00:29:36,00:29:37,Yeah.
00:29:37,00:29:39,"I think you always get in calls from sort of restaurants saying,"
00:29:39,00:29:43,"excuse me, sorry, I think you left your egg on the wrong table."
00:29:43,00:29:45,"But albatrosses are generally, apart from the ones"
00:29:45,00:29:46,"who lose their eggs, quite good parents."
00:29:46,00:29:48,"So albatrosses, a couple of them, they say,"
00:29:48,00:29:50,and these parents dropped to 50 years.
00:29:50,00:29:52,But they're not completely monogamous.
00:29:52,00:29:55,So they did a study of 75 different albatrosses.
00:29:55,00:29:57,And 10% of them had different fathers
00:29:57,00:29:59,to the albatross raising them.
00:29:59,00:30:02,But both the male and the female albatrosses
00:30:02,00:30:03,will go and be with other albatrosses.
00:30:03,00:30:06,But they'll always come back to their home albatross.
00:30:06,00:30:07,Yeah.
00:30:07,00:30:13,"But so they are 100% faithful, as a, let's say,"
00:30:13,00:30:15,"in a married couple, as a married couple, let's say,"
00:30:15,00:30:16,in quotations.
00:30:16,00:30:17,They pair for life.
00:30:17,00:30:20,"But if this is your view of faithfulness as a married man,"
00:30:20,00:30:23,then I dread to think of another's listening right now.
00:30:23,00:30:24,"No, no, no, no."
00:30:24,00:30:25,What I dread was there was a book that came out
00:30:25,00:30:28,"called ""The Thing with Feathers"" by Noah Stryker."
00:30:28,00:30:31,And Noah Stryker did basically a table
00:30:31,00:30:33,of bird divorce rates for this book.
00:30:33,00:30:36,"He looked at 100 or so different species of birds,"
00:30:36,00:30:38,and he built the divorce rates.
00:30:38,00:30:41,And at the top of the most faithful in terms
00:30:41,00:30:44,of remaining with a single partner for their whole life
00:30:44,00:30:45,was the albatross.
00:30:45,00:30:48,And flamingos were right at the bottom.
00:30:48,00:30:50,They have a 99% divorce rate.
00:30:50,00:30:51,Wow.
00:30:51,00:30:53,"But basically, what we're saying is albatrosses"
00:30:53,00:30:54,have open marriages.
00:30:54,00:30:55,"Yeah, on both sides."
00:30:55,00:30:56,"Yeah, OK."
00:30:56,00:30:58,Do you know why albatrosses tend not
00:30:58,00:31:00,to go to divorce lawyers?
00:31:00,00:31:01,Because the bill too big.
00:31:01,00:31:03,The bills are huge.
00:31:03,00:31:06,When one of us immediately guessed the punchline to your joke
00:31:06,00:31:08,at it is worth reconsidering.
00:31:08,00:31:10,"That's quite an interesting thing, actually,"
00:31:10,00:31:11,about these open relationships.
00:31:11,00:31:14,And this is related to the lason albatross
00:31:14,00:31:16,which lives around the Hawaiian Islands.
00:31:16,00:31:17,They have this weird gender imbalance.
00:31:17,00:31:20,59% of them are female on there.
00:31:20,00:31:22,And that's just because a lot of females immigrated there.
00:31:22,00:31:25,So they often separate in their flying season.
00:31:25,00:31:29,And this means that 31% of lason albatross pairs
00:31:29,00:31:31,are female on female.
00:31:31,00:31:32,They raise chicks together.
00:31:32,00:31:35,So the males will inseminate a series of females
00:31:35,00:31:37,and can only raise one egg at a time.
00:31:37,00:31:40,And so the other women who've been abandoned by their man
00:31:40,00:31:42,find another lady.
00:31:42,00:31:43,And they raise the egg together.
00:31:43,00:31:45,And they will stay together for a lifetime.
00:31:45,00:31:47,Just like just like male female pairs.
00:31:47,00:31:49,And they're pretty successful raising the chicks.
00:31:49,00:31:51,The lason albatrosses are really interesting.
00:31:51,00:31:54,"They do their courting, viral dance"
00:31:54,00:31:58,"that they have, which is an established dance."
00:31:58,00:32:01,"What they do is, when they're about three years of age,"
00:32:01,00:32:05,they go back to their birthplace and they all meet there
00:32:05,00:32:07,and they learn the dance as a group.
00:32:07,00:32:09,"And then eventually, they find their partner"
00:32:09,00:32:11,when they're ready to court.
00:32:11,00:32:12,It's this-- - They're very intricate.
00:32:12,00:32:14,But it does take years of practice.
00:32:14,00:32:16,"So actually, we've got these people who listen"
00:32:16,00:32:20,to our show who are so great called Michelle and Chris.
00:32:20,00:32:22,And they work with albatrosses out on Goff Island.
00:32:22,00:32:24,These really endangered albatrosses.
00:32:24,00:32:25,"- Where's Goff Island, sorry?"
00:32:25,00:32:27,- Goff Island is in the South Atlantic.
00:32:27,00:32:28,"So yeah, they work with them."
00:32:28,00:32:30,"And anyway, one of them wrote to me and said that display"
00:32:30,00:32:32,is it's like head bobbing.
00:32:32,00:32:33,It's wings spreading.
00:32:33,00:32:36,They make these bubbling sounds in their throats.
00:32:36,00:32:38,"And yeah, they practice for years and years"
00:32:38,00:32:39,before they're ready.
00:32:39,00:32:40,Imagine if you're flirting.
00:32:40,00:32:41,You have to practice flirting for--
00:32:41,00:32:43,"- I mean, I did."
00:32:43,00:32:44,(laughing)
00:32:44,00:32:47,"And for years and years, you know, you're interested."
00:32:47,00:32:49,So this is bringing a lot of might be an albatross.
00:32:49,00:32:52,They do have kind of singles bars where they go.
00:32:52,00:32:53,Some side species do.
00:32:53,00:32:56,"Well, yeah, they have things all gams."
00:32:56,00:32:58,So this is for Southern Bullers albatrosses.
00:32:58,00:32:59,"When they're aged about eight years old,"
00:32:59,00:33:02,the males all go ashore and they make a nest.
00:33:02,00:33:05,And then the females visit and they have a look around
00:33:05,00:33:08,"and they're like, you know, whether they like it or not,"
00:33:08,00:33:11,but they only form a pair in their fourth year on shore.
00:33:11,00:33:12,They've already been through three years
00:33:12,00:33:15,of prospecting each other and checking each other out.
00:33:15,00:33:17,- It's like university.
00:33:17,00:33:18,- It's exactly like university.
00:33:18,00:33:19,- Per-up at the end.
00:33:19,00:33:20,- Yeah.
00:33:20,00:33:21,And four years.
00:33:21,00:33:23,"So we know it's a Scottish or American university, for example."
00:33:23,00:33:27,"- So my favourite albatross is, have you heard of Albert,"
00:33:27,00:33:28,the lonely Scottish albatross?
00:33:28,00:33:29,- No.
00:33:29,00:33:31,"- Albert, very sadly, was blown off course"
00:33:31,00:33:34,in the South Atlantic in 1967 and rocked off in Scotland
00:33:34,00:33:36,where he's been living as a bachelor ever since.
00:33:36,00:33:39,He's not yet found and made.
00:33:39,00:33:41,- Can't he part with a puffin or something?
00:33:41,00:33:42,Size difference.
00:33:42,00:33:43,(laughing)
00:33:43,00:33:45,And these things don't get in the way of true love.
00:33:45,00:33:47,"Yeah, so he's living between."
00:33:47,00:33:49,"Yeah, he lives between the Alter Hebrides and Shetland."
00:33:49,00:33:51,- Are there people around where he is?
00:33:51,00:33:53,Or is he just monitored?
00:33:53,00:33:54,"- He's been seen by Broadway shows,"
00:33:54,00:33:56,but I think he's a little weaker albatross.
00:33:56,00:33:57,It's not people.
00:33:57,00:33:57,- Oh my god.
00:33:57,00:33:58,- He's just idea.
00:33:58,00:34:00,"- As a bird watcher, if you're spending your whole life"
00:34:00,00:34:01,"around blue tits and sparrows,"
00:34:01,00:34:04,that is fucking exciting when a giant albatross
00:34:04,00:34:06,appears on their horizon.
00:34:06,00:34:07,'Cause they are massive.
00:34:07,00:34:09,"They've got, I think the Wingspan,"
00:34:09,00:34:11,"the Wondering Albatross Wingspan is 3.5 meters, is it?"
00:34:11,00:34:12,- 3.5 meters.
00:34:12,00:34:13,- They're ridiculously huge.
00:34:13,00:34:14,- It's big.
00:34:14,00:34:16,"- Anyway, I just want to talk about the Tristan albatross,"
00:34:16,00:34:18,which is the second biggest albatross.
00:34:18,00:34:20,So people thought it was in the same species
00:34:20,00:34:24,"as the Wondering, and then it split away in 1998."
00:34:24,00:34:27,"Anyway, these are the albatrosses that are friends"
00:34:27,00:34:30,"and podcast listeners, Michelle and Chris look after"
00:34:30,00:34:33,"on Goff Island, because the most amazing thing"
00:34:33,00:34:34,has been happening to them.
00:34:34,00:34:37,"So they're obviously huge, but they don't have any natural"
00:34:37,00:34:39,predators 'cause they're alone on this island.
00:34:39,00:34:40,And so they have no defense mechanisms.
00:34:40,00:34:45,"So invasive mice arrived on the island a few decades ago,"
00:34:45,00:34:47,and they've just been eating them.
00:34:47,00:34:47,- Oh no.
00:34:47,00:34:49,"- So these, it's unbelievable."
00:34:49,00:34:53,"So these tiny little mice, you'll get a 20 gram mouse,"
00:34:53,00:34:56,and it will just eat away at 10 kilogram albatross chick.
00:34:56,00:34:58,"Or sometimes I'll even eat the adults,"
00:34:58,00:35:00,so that adults will stay with the chicks
00:35:00,00:35:01,and let themselves be eaten by mice
00:35:01,00:35:03,because they're so afraid to leave.
00:35:03,00:35:03,- Wow.
00:35:03,00:35:05,"- That chick is really, really sad,"
00:35:05,00:35:07,and so they become critically endangered
00:35:07,00:35:08,because of this.
00:35:08,00:35:08,- But they must have.
00:35:08,00:35:09,- They sit there.
00:35:09,00:35:11,"- What do you mean they have no, they can move?"
00:35:11,00:35:12,- They sit there.
00:35:12,00:35:13,"- Have they lost the ability to think,"
00:35:13,00:35:17,"if I smack it with my giant wing, it will fling off."
00:35:17,00:35:19,- They don't have the ability to think that.
00:35:19,00:35:20,- It's incredible.
00:35:20,00:35:21,"So what is happening, too?"
00:35:21,00:35:23,- So what's happening is this team of people
00:35:23,00:35:25,"have gone out there, and so these three guys,"
00:35:25,00:35:27,"two of whom are Michelle and Christopher,"
00:35:27,00:35:29,are now trying to save the albatross
00:35:29,00:35:31,is essentially by killing all the mice.
00:35:31,00:35:33,And we're getting them back guys.
00:35:33,00:35:34,"But it's, yeah, it's a good cause there."
00:35:34,00:35:38,"I think there are 1,500 to 2,400 pairs left at the moment,"
00:35:38,00:35:41,"and it's quite funny when you look them up on Wikipedia,"
00:35:41,00:35:44,"it said, ""Cause albatrosses fly hundreds of thousands"
00:35:44,00:35:47,"of miles so far, but they only breed in this tiny island."""
00:35:47,00:35:52,"So they have an occurrence range of 5.4 million square miles,"
00:35:52,00:35:54,and a breeding range of 31 square miles.
00:35:54,00:35:55,- Wow.
00:35:55,00:35:59,"- So flipped on a different way of talking about it,"
00:35:59,00:36:01,there's another podcast out there talking about
00:36:01,00:36:03,two mice murderers on Godfatherland.
00:36:03,00:36:05,"- Yeah, they moved in."
00:36:05,00:36:06,"- They've gone, they live on this island,"
00:36:06,00:36:08,they just murder mice all day.
00:36:08,00:36:11,"- I mean, the mice are impressive, they're like super mice."
00:36:11,00:36:13,"So to be fair, they are, I think they're the biggest mice"
00:36:13,00:36:14,in the world.
00:36:14,00:36:15,- Wow.
00:36:15,00:36:17,"- In fact, 'cause they've got island gigantism,"
00:36:17,00:36:18,"they know where you've got nothing threatening you,"
00:36:18,00:36:19,you're the only ones there.
00:36:19,00:36:20,- So they're huge.
00:36:20,00:36:22,"If you're on the mouse's side, they're doing bloody well."
00:36:22,00:36:24,- Sounds like your two friends are very small.
00:36:24,00:36:27,(laughing)
00:36:27,00:36:27,- They are.
00:36:27,00:36:29,"They've got island dwarfism, these two humans."
00:36:29,00:36:31,They've been there too long.
00:36:31,00:36:33,- Have you guys heard of wisdom?
00:36:33,00:36:33,"- Wisdom, the albatross."
00:36:33,00:36:34,"- Yes, I believe I embody it."
00:36:34,00:36:36,"- Well, I'm not sure."
00:36:36,00:36:39,"So wisdom is a laser in albatross,"
00:36:39,00:36:40,like the ones we were talking earlier.
00:36:40,00:36:42,So she's the oldest albatross in the world.
00:36:42,00:36:45,She was first ringed in 1956.
00:36:45,00:36:46,She's still alive.
00:36:46,00:36:48,So she's at least 64 years old.
00:36:48,00:36:50,"And in fact, we know she's a bit older,"
00:36:50,00:36:52,"'cause when she was ringed, the scientist who ringed her"
00:36:52,00:36:54,"said, ""Well, she's about five years old."""
00:36:54,00:36:56,She was still alive in 2018.
00:36:56,00:36:57,And this is the really cool thing.
00:36:57,00:37:01,The biologist who first found her in 1956 and ringed her
00:37:01,00:37:03,was an ornithologist called Chandler Robbins.
00:37:03,00:37:05,"Okay, so he ringed her, went away."
00:37:05,00:37:08,"Then in 2002, 46 years later,"
00:37:08,00:37:10,"he tries to ring another albatross and says,"
00:37:10,00:37:12,"""Oh, this is already ringed."""
00:37:12,00:37:15,And it's the bird I ringed 46 years ago.
00:37:15,00:37:16,"That is a bit annoying, though, isn't it?"
00:37:16,00:37:19,If you're hoping to get to an albatross.
00:37:19,00:37:22,It wasn't his second albatross.
00:37:22,00:37:24,It's whole life for the same albatross.
00:37:24,00:37:25,It's incredible.
00:37:25,00:37:27,He is an amazing figure in terms of
00:37:27,00:37:28,Ornithology and Birdwatching.
00:37:28,00:37:31,"He died in 2017, Asian 98."
00:37:31,00:37:32,"And that's partly, you know,"
00:37:32,00:37:34,albatrosses often outlive the research
00:37:34,00:37:34,that's working on them.
00:37:34,00:37:35,That's incredible.
00:37:35,00:37:36,That's a long lived year.
00:37:36,00:37:38,"Do they live, do they have albatross years?"
00:37:38,00:37:40,"Like, you know, had dog years,"
00:37:40,00:37:41,different to human years?
00:37:41,00:37:42,I think they just live a really long time.
00:37:42,00:37:45,"So they're like, they're in conjo-- they're year is our year."
00:37:45,00:37:47,"Well, we don't know because people,"
00:37:47,00:37:49,"dog years aren't really a thing,"
00:37:49,00:37:50,except for the fact that dogs are our pets.
00:37:50,00:37:52,"And so we speculate about that kind of bullshit,"
00:37:52,00:37:54,whereas people don't have many pet albatrosses.
00:37:54,00:37:55,It's not official.
00:37:55,00:37:56,Dog years is not unofficial.
00:37:56,00:37:57,"Well, what do you think dog years means?"
00:37:57,00:37:59,They don't know their own birthdays.
00:37:59,00:38:01,"No, it's about celebrations."
00:38:01,00:38:04,"It's about time passage and lifespan, right?"
00:38:04,00:38:05,"Yes, that's true."
00:38:05,00:38:07,So the lifespan is about 60.
00:38:07,00:38:08,"Yeah, in albatross years?"
00:38:08,00:38:09,"Oh, my god."
00:38:09,00:38:12,We're going to have to wrap up in a second.
00:38:12,00:38:14,"Just one more thing, albatrosses,"
00:38:14,00:38:16,"when Western explorers first discovered them,"
00:38:16,00:38:18,they thought they were sheep.
00:38:18,00:38:19,"No, flying sheep."
00:38:19,00:38:21,"That's right, just big old flying sheep, really?"
00:38:21,00:38:23,"Well, this is according to these researchers"
00:38:23,00:38:25,"they were in touch with, but apparently,"
00:38:25,00:38:26,"the explorer Marian de Fresno,"
00:38:26,00:38:31,"when he visited in 1772, he visited Prince Edward Island."
00:38:31,00:38:33,And he just saw these huge white figures
00:38:33,00:38:35,"wandering around the grass and said,"
00:38:35,00:38:36,"""Well, there's a whole bunch of sheep here."""
00:38:36,00:38:37,Great.
00:38:37,00:38:39,So did he get really close up to them?
00:38:39,00:38:41,"He did, I think the man's an idiot."
00:38:41,00:38:42,He was stroking.
00:38:42,00:38:45,"He was going, ""This wool is not the same as ours."""
00:38:45,00:38:47,They measure their speed with their nostrils.
00:38:47,00:38:49,They have these tubes inside their nose.
00:38:49,00:38:51,And it's exactly the same as how planes measure their speed.
00:38:51,00:38:54,"So planes have things called pito tubes,"
00:38:54,00:38:56,which measure airflow and pressure at the end of that tube.
00:38:56,00:38:58,And that tells you how fast the plane is moving.
00:38:58,00:38:59,Wow.
00:38:59,00:39:00,And albatrosses can do the same thing.
00:39:00,00:39:01,Wow.
00:39:01,00:39:02,Yeah.
00:39:02,00:39:03,Wonder where they need to know their speed.
00:39:03,00:39:05,"Do you think they get back and go, cracked 70?"
00:39:05,00:39:06,Personal best.
00:39:06,00:39:09,"I don't know, mate, there's a bill here for speeding."
00:39:09,00:39:10,And it's a huge bill.
00:39:11,00:39:12,[LAUGHTER]
00:39:12,00:39:18,"OK, that is it."
00:39:18,00:39:19,That is all of our facts.
