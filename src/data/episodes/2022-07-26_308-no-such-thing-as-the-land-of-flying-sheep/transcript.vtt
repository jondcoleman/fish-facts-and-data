00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.680
 - Hi guys, just before we start the show,

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.000
 here is a warning, we have a special guest on today.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.440
 - Yes, very exciting guest, a author, a published author.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.960
 - A published author, I can't believe we've pinned her down.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.280
 But one of the ways we haven't pinned her down

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.080
 is that she works in the office with us.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.120
 It's Ann Miller, you will have heard her before.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.920
 - That's right, Ann Miller has just released

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.920
 her debut children's book, it's so good.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.880
 It's called Mickey and the Animal Spies,

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.720
 and it is the story of a young girl

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.760
 who gets recruited into a secret organization called Cobra.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.280
 But it is not manned by humans, but by animals.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.760
 - That's right, I realized I'm not a child,

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.480
 but I have actually read it and I genuinely loved it.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.920
 It's like a fantasy book that you wish you'd had

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.200
 if you were sort of 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 34.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.600
 - I'm not a child either, however,

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.840
 I do have the reading level of a seven year old,

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.640
 and I have to say I think any kid who gets this book

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.200
 will be fascinated, they'll know more's code at the end of it,

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.760
 and they will just want more,

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.680
 and they're gonna get more because it's part of a trilogy.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.560
 - It is, yes, and it does have code scattered throughout it.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.320
 So it's almost at a mini-activity book,

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.160
 and yeah, it features some cracking animals,

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.440
 it gets cats in it, there's rats,

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.400
 there's complex characters who maybe you don't love at first,

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.040
 but you grow very fond of.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.840
 There is a Cobra, 'cause it's very funny pun

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.160
 on the real life Cobra organization,

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.600
 and then Cobra the snake.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.640
 It's a brilliant book, go get it.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.680
 And to get it, you should go on the internet,

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.000
 where you can buy books,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.560
 or you should go to a bookshop where you can also buy books,

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.320
 and just ask for Mickey and the Animal Spies.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.480
 - By Anne Miller, who joins us on today's show,

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.760
 so let's get to it, on with the episode.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.340
 (upbeat music)

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.000
 (upbeat music)

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:57.660
 - Hello, and welcome to another episode

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.300
 of "No Such Thing as a Fish",

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:00.980
 a weekly podcast coming to you

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.740
 from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.140
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.820
 with Anna Chazinski, Andrew Hunter Murray, and Anne Miller,

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.180
 and once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.180
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.780
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.220
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Anne.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.280
 - My fact is that even the dust at GCHQ is classified.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.020
 (laughing)

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.540
 - So what does this mean?

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.620
 - So I went to a great exhibition on at the Science Museum,

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.340
 which is 100 years of GCHQ,

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.860
 and they've got things that they've never been seen before.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.500
 And one of the facts I found there is that

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.540
 when they have things need to be taken out of service,

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.220
 and machines, paperwork, things like that,

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.380
 it gets ground down to become electronic waste,

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.020
 and it's dust, but it's certified,

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.260
 so I can't just go in the bin,

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.900
 because it's so, so, so secret what they've ground up,

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.140
 even the ground up stuff is secret.

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.220
 (laughing)

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.340
 - So they dispose of it really securely somewhere, do they?

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.020
 - They do not discuss how they dispose of it.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.860
 (laughing)

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.780
 - Can you imagine being a double agent

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.220
 and going to the Russians and go,

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.580
 "I've got my hands on, it's classified."

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:04.420
 - It does.

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.180
 - Yeah, and you show them the dust.

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.420
 I don't think they'd be happy.

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:08.740
 I don't think they'd consider it classified.

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.140
 - Well, they might, because another thing I found

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.260
 at the museum was these things called microdots.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.620
 So this is very tiny coded messages,

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:17.740
 so it would look like it's like a little

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:19.060
 very small polka dot print,

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.020
 and when you bring out a lens, it will magnify it,

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.500
 and you can read like I saw Anna on the bridge

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.620
 at two o'clock, the meter five or something.

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.940
 So the dust, they get very, very small,

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.100
 and they're still very, very secret, so everything is.

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.700
 - If you're wearing a polka dot dress, for example,

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.180
 and you know that one of the dots is the microdot,

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.380
 you have to remember really carefully which one it is.

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.620
 - The best place to hide something is

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:40.820
 where lots of things look the same.

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:41.660
 - Yeah.

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:42.820
 - Sounds like a great exhibition.

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.460
 - We've got dust, we've got tiny dots you can't read.

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:49.060
 - I've got tons of machines as well.

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.500
 - I just like the idea, is it like the hardest jigsaw

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.620
 you've ever done piecing the dust back together?

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.580
 Do you think you collect the dust,

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.100
 spew it on the floor, and then have to put it back in order?

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.980
 - I suspect that you can't repeat the dust now,

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.260
 but maybe you could one day.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.740
 - So the worst Ikea assembling, isn't it?

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:10.140
 - We've got you a computer, it is a dust war.

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.540
 - So this is not the first time that this kind of rubbish

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.580
 has been useful in espionage.

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:20.020
 So during the Cold War, there was an operation called Tamarisk,

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:21.300
 if you guys heard of this.

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.300
 So the USA and the UK and France,

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.140
 they all had military liaisons in East Germany,

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:29.300
 and the Soviets were allowed some in West Germany.

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.380
 So it was supposed to be a way of lowering tensions

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.180
 by having a bit of representation on either side,

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.660
 but basically it just turned into legalized espionage

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.340
 'cause obviously people sent spies to do that,

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:40.740
 to work in those missions.

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.740
 And the Western officers launched this operation

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.060
 where they would gather up paper from Soviet bins,

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.140
 and sometimes they had to gather up used toilet paper

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.500
 because a lot of people would not give

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.820
 a toilet paper in the Soviet mission,

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:55.300
 or on the Soviet side.

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.820
 So they would use confidential paper as toilet paper,

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.780
 and then the Western spies had to go through

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.700
 gathering pooey paper from bins basically,

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.060
 which had classified information on it.

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.900
 - That's useful though,

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.180
 'cause you can also report back on their diets.

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:12.020
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.460
 - You can call the information you possibly want.

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:15.300
 - Yeah.

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:16.740
 - Yeah, and it was one of the most successful operations

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.620
 of the whole Cold War was gathering information

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.220
 from pooey bins.

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:22.460
 (laughing)

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:23.660
 - But I think part of the thing is you don't,

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.740
 like there's so much work in, you know,

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.660
 making things secret, but there's other things you give away

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.580
 just by your choice of toilet paper, or your dust,

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:31.420
 and you've got to be--

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:32.260
 - Really?

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.140
 - Yeah, they all like scented toilet paper.

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:35.260
 They must have, you know,

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:36.100
 scented tastes.

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:38.420
 (laughing)

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:39.700
 Is that a useful thing to know?

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:40.540
 - Sure.

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:42.100
 - It's just what shops you might find, then.

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:43.540
 (laughing)

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:46.660
 - Did you know that GCHQ was not recognized officially

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:47.980
 until 1994?

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:48.820
 - Yeah.

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:50.660
 - So it was bizarre, GCHQ and MI5,

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:52.980
 until there was, like, an official acknowledgement,

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:54.700
 there was a parliamentary act, which basically said,

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:55.860
 what its role should be.

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.420
 Basically, all anyone knew was from me

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:58.660
 in Fleming and John LeCarrie.

00:05:58.660 --> 00:05:59.500
 - Yeah.

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:00.940
 And whenever a bone film comes out,

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.580
 recruitment applications peak at GCHQ.

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.020
 - Yeah, that might say, 'cause everyone's like,

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:06.220
 "Oh, give that a go."

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:07.700
 - Even though they said that James Bond

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.020
 wouldn't get a job there, haven't they?

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:09.860
 - Yeah, why?

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:11.460
 - 'Cause reading alcoholic.

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:13.660
 - And also not emotionally intelligent.

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:14.580
 - Oh.

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:15.820
 - Which is fair enough.

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:16.820
 - So I was reading an article,

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:18.420
 which was like an inside GCHQ,

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:19.660
 which I love this stuff.

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:20.860
 - There's not that much in them

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:22.380
 because they can't tell you that much.

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:23.820
 But the article was in the FT,

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:26.220
 and it interviewed the head of GCHQ,

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:28.060
 who's called Jeremy Fleming,

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:30.180
 as an Ian Fleming,

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:31.860
 and the article was written

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:35.180
 by the FT security editor, David Bond.

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:36.180
 - Oh God.

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:37.020
 - Oh God.

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:40.460
 - What is the argument to terminism to the mat?

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:45.300
 - Do you know that the head of IT at GCHQ is AI?

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:46.140
 - What?

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:47.540
 - Okay, that's not true, it turns out.

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:48.660
 I met Red the article.

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:50.740
 It's a guy called Al, but it looks like AI,

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:51.580
 when you read it.

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:52.660
 - I'll run by a robot.

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:54.940
 - But what's interesting about him is he's dyslexic.

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:56.620
 He's the head of IT, and he's dyslexic.

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:58.020
 And I was reading this in an article.

00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:59.660
 - His name is actually LA, isn't it?

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:00.900
 (laughing)

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:02.580
 - So this is an article.

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:03.900
 - Written in the Times,

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.780
 a journalist was allowed into GCHQ to do this article,

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:09.180
 and it was very funny because they had,

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:10.180
 as the journalist went in,

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:11.540
 all these A4 bits of paper,

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:13.740
 blue tack to walls, saying caution,

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:15.260
 journalist interview,

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.580
 keep all conversations too official.

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:18.580
 (laughing)

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:20.100
 And everywhere this journalist went,

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:20.940
 that's where they saw.

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:22.140
 But they were doing an article about

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:24.620
 the neurodiversity program at GCHQ.

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:26.460
 So there are 300 men and women there

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:30.220
 who all have dyslexia or autism or aspergers,

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:32.180
 and face blindness, for example.

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:34.460
 So there's one lady who works there,

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:36.340
 who's a former chemist called Jill,

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:38.820
 and she's their intelligence analysis.

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:41.340
 She can do that, and she's ahead of it.

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:44.220
 But she struggles to recognize her employer's face

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:46.020
 who she's worked with for eight years,

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:48.460
 because of the face blindness disease that she has.

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:50.500
 So it's an extraordinary article

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:51.900
 about the people that they hire there.

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:52.900
 - I read one as well.

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:54.260
 And they said, "I don't listen for the day,"

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.540
 and like Dan was going to be careful what they say,

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:58.740
 and someone was told that he was allowed to go

00:07:58.740 --> 00:07:59.860
 around the building, and that was fine.

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:01.260
 He's allowed to go in for like six days,

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:02.740
 but he wasn't allowed to go into the canteen

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:04.740
 where people may be discussing things informally.

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:05.740
 (laughing)

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:08.260
 - Yes, but the fire in his vine for the canteen.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.180
 - Just start him out, basically, eventually.

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:11.020
 - No, yeah.

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:13.220
 - And that's part of the thing with the baristas, isn't it?

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:14.060
 - Oh yeah.

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:15.900
 - Like they have a Costa coffee, and they're the coffee shop

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:17.420
 in GCHQ as well, and they have to go

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:18.780
 under a regular spy training.

00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:20.620
 'Cause it's not like a regular.

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:22.100
 You can't just, like, - Yeah, that's really funny.

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:23.500
 - You've got different levels of security.

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:24.340
 You need to be able to pass.

00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:26.300
 - You can write 007 on the side of the cup,

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:27.780
 and so is that 001?

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:29.940
 - Completely different age and person's hand up.

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:31.900
 I just blown two agents cover right there.

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:32.900
 (laughing)

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:34.460
 - They did have a building in London,

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:38.980
 which they ran for 66 years and never acknowledged

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:40.180
 until they just left.

00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:43.460
 They left the last year, and it was apparently intentionally

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:45.060
 boring, you know, it was designed to look

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:47.300
 just like a really drab office block.

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:49.260
 This and James' Park actually is where it is.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.660
 Anyway, they moved out in 2019, and then they said,

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:53.700
 "Ah, it was GCHQ, all along."

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:56.820
 But the BBC, the BBC sent some reporters

00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:58.380
 to ask people in the area,

00:08:58.380 --> 00:08:59.380
 "What do you think that building was?"

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:01.340
 And they said, "Oh, it's the spies, isn't it?"

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:02.180
 (laughing)

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:03.180
 "Am I sick, secret service?"

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:05.020
 "It's something they're all spies, anyway."

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:05.900
 - Every day, they were going in,

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:07.660
 like, with their trench coats on, and they're

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:08.500
 (laughing)

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:09.340
 - So that lasted.

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:10.260
 - Magnifying glass.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:11.780
 (laughing)

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:15.420
 - You're having your book launch in a spy building.

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:17.540
 - In the original GCHQ building.

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:20.300
 - Yeah, so I've been, when I walk on my lunch break,

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:21.980
 I walk past this building, and you sort of look around

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:23.660
 at the plaques, and we're looking for facts,

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:25.340
 and there was a plaque on the wall that said,

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:27.140
 it was the original home of GCHQ.

00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:28.740
 They only unveiled the plaque, I think, last year.

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:30.940
 The clique of Queen came to unveil it for the centenary,

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:31.780
 and here's the best bit.

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:33.060
 They're hidden messages on the plaque,

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:34.060
 because it's the GCHQ.

00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:34.900
 - Oh!

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:35.740
 - Like, no one.

00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:36.580
 - Yes.

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:37.740
 - What was so great?

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:38.580
 - I don't know.

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:40.140
 - Oh, they've just told you there's a hidden message,

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:41.380
 but can we go and find it?

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:42.380
 - We need to go and find it.

00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:43.540
 I actually don't know what it is.

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:45.020
 I've been walking past that plaque many times,

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:46.180
 I never thought to look for a code,

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:47.460
 and now I'm trying to go a lunch break.

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:48.620
 - Yeah, I think we should.

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:49.460
 - I love the fact that you say,

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:50.740
 you wander around looking at plaques,

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:51.580
 looking at your eye facts,

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:53.140
 we're never off the clock here.

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:54.300
 - Oh, it's a bunch of things.

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:55.780
 The overnight lunch break clear my head.

00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:56.620
 Oh.

00:09:56.620 --> 00:10:00.220
 - We're gonna have to move on in a sec to my next fact.

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:02.220
 - Just about the actual recruitment process,

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:03.060
 and what it takes.

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:04.220
 It's quite fun to read about.

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:06.900
 So the initial interview that you get for GCHQ

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:09.260
 is designed to test your knowledge of technical subjects,

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:10.900
 such as how a smartphone works.

00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:13.700
 So I wouldn't pass that phase, but many do.

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:16.780
 And then you get this interrogation about your private life,

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:18.380
 and often you just out of university,

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:21.260
 and they interrogate you basically about your sexual history.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.260
 And so one of the girls who joined,

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.020
 I think she was 22 at the time,

00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:26.740
 she had the vetting officer knew more about me

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:28.460
 than anyone else alive.

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:30.380
 And you know, you have to discuss everyone,

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:31.660
 you've ever shacked with them,

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:33.540
 and all of your friends and family,

00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:36.620
 you get drug tested, so you get a bit of hair clipped off.

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:38.180
 This seems like a real oversight.

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:39.660
 For instance, one person got this done,

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:40.940
 went to the hairdresser the next week,

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:42.100
 and the hairdresser was like,

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:43.740
 oh my god, you've got this random bull patch

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:44.820
 on the back of your head.

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:46.460
 And then you've got to come up with a cover story.

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:48.420
 They're like, oh yeah, just trying it out.

00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:51.300
 That's probably your first test as a sponsor.

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:52.700
 That's another reason why James Bond

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:54.540
 probably wouldn't get in as a spy, actually,

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:56.140
 because the interview process to discuss

00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:59.620
 everyone he'd ever slept with is still going on.

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:02.380
 He's still there, he's in a room somewhere.

00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:04.740
 I read a piece of somebody who does recruitment for MI5,

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:07.020
 just known as Joe, and they basically explained

00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:08.220
 that some candidates who come

00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:10.020
 have got some strange ideas for what actually

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:11.540
 the job involves because of James Bond.

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:12.940
 I guess people are really scared to take this,

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:14.300
 that's not what the job is like.

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:15.860
 And some of the questions Joe was asked

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:18.300
 included, do I have to wear my own clothes to work?

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:20.380
 Should I wear a disguise instead?

00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:22.580
 And do I need to dump my partner to work here?

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:23.820
 Because if I do, I will.

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:26.020
 [LAUGHTER]

00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:32.860
 OK, it's time for fact number two, and that is Andy.

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:35.380
 My fact is that people drive more carefully

00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:38.300
 if they have a pavlova in the car than their own child.

00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:40.020
 [LAUGHTER]

00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:42.380
 So this is an experiment that was done.

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:44.420
 It was a survey done, slightly as a PR stunt,

00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:46.580
 by an insurance firm in Australia.

00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:48.500
 They asked drivers about their behavior.

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:51.460
 First of all, they just said, what makes you drive more carefully?

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:53.340
 Would you drive more carefully if your child was in the car?

00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:56.260
 Half of all parents surveyed said, yes, absolutely.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.900
 Only 12% of those people said they would be more cautious

00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:00.820
 if they were driving a pavlova around.

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:03.620
 Pavlova, and a rang, and cream-based pudding.

00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:04.380
 Yeah.

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:05.220
 OK, good.

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:07.980
 And a child is a smaller version of a person.

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:09.980
 Anyway, they tested it with a small sample,

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:11.460
 admittedly, only 20 drivers.

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:12.780
 But over an eight-day period, they

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:17.020
 were asked to drive alone, with a child, and with a pavlova.

00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:20.220
 95% of them, 19 out of 20, drove more carefully

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:23.100
 with a pavlova on board, which was way more

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:24.860
 than were more careful with their children.

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:27.380
 And what did the school say when they dropped off a pavlova

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:29.020
 at school when they didn't have the time?

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:30.660
 Nobody noticed the difference.

00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:31.580
 Very impressive.

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:32.660
 I think it makes sense.

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:33.780
 It makes perfect sense.

00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:36.420
 Daniel, the one who's got a child, that's slightly worried.

00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:37.260
 That's true.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.540
 Why do you think it makes sense, or do you have to explain that?

00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:41.860
 Well, if you've had anything in the back of a car,

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:44.060
 that is of a sensitive nature, of course,

00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:46.100
 you're going to take corners less sharply of this.

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:47.580
 Of course.

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:48.380
 Of course.

00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:49.580
 Babies are very resilient.

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:52.300
 Well, you can't put a seatbelt around a pavlova.

00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:55.100
 You could probably get it some sort of transportation device.

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:57.180
 Like, almost cupcake carriers, but with a belt.

00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:57.940
 You can see it.

00:12:57.940 --> 00:12:59.380
 Yeah, that's true.

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:01.740
 So maybe this solves all the driving issues

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:03.540
 that we have in the world, just anyone who's

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:05.980
 a bit of a dangerous driver, pop a pavlova in the back.

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:08.100
 And we're just going to solve everything.

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:11.260
 I am looking at more Australian studies about drivers,

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.300
 and one was about how people, when they first get their license,

00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:15.660
 are very cautious, very careful.

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:18.500
 And as we drive them for longer, some people are more distracted.

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:20.580
 We start some people, some people start

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:22.260
 to see it as time taken out of their day.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:23.820
 So what they did was they parked by a road

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:25.260
 and they took photos of anyone they saw

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.940
 doing on correct procedure.

00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:31.180
 And pictures they got included people eating cereal at the wheel,

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:33.340
 brushing their hair and reading books.

00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:33.860
 Wow.

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:35.620
 Driving around Australia.

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:36.620
 That's what it says.

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:37.620
 That's speed reading.

00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:38.980
 I mean.

00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:39.980
 Yeah.

00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:42.100
 Did you guys know there's no safety difference

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:45.060
 between using a phone while you're driving a handheld phone

00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:46.260
 and a hands-free phone?

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:46.740
 Really?

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:47.260
 Yeah.

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:48.060
 So I actually learned this.

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:49.660
 I went to a magic show at the Welcome Center,

00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:50.340
 and it was about--

00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:52.620
 [LAUGHTER]

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:55.060
 I have fact check this afterwards.

00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:57.020
 It was about the science of misdirection

00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:59.020
 and the fact that we don't notice things

00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:01.020
 and the fact that we can be so easily distracted.

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:03.500
 And study after study has found that if you're on a phone,

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:05.940
 you're four times more likely to be involved in an accident

00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:08.940
 completely regardless of whether it's handheld or hands-free.

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:12.740
 And it's just because it's the concentration that's distracted,

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:14.260
 not your actual hand.

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:15.980
 And so it found that, for instance, specifically,

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:18.060
 if you're on the phone and someone on the phone says,

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:21.340
 oh, do you remember where you put the bananas or whatever?

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:22.460
 And you have to find--

00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:22.700
 Yeah.

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:24.660
 We're going to need to slice them up for the path over.

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:25.660
 What do you want?

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:27.300
 Then you're at your heads and your kitchen,

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:29.740
 rather than your head and your kitchen,

00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:32.060
 not literally, but, metaphorically.

00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:34.500
 And that apparently reduces your field of vision

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:35.260
 to about a quarter.

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.900
 Your field of vision that you can concentrate on to about a quarter,

00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:39.620
 if you imagine that other place?

00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:41.940
 I was looking into a few road safety things as well.

00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:46.820
 So this was for pedestrians, rather than for how you drive safely.

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:50.540
 There was one idea that was put forward back in the 1930s,

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:52.780
 which didn't, unfortunately, happen.

00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:54.060
 But I love the idea of it.

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:56.140
 So imagine you hit by a car.

00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:57.740
 And the car does a hit and run.

00:14:57.740 --> 00:14:58.860
 Disappears on you.

00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:00.820
 Cars, and we're going to be designed

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:03.660
 with this little disc that shoots out of the car

00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:06.460
 when a hit and run happens so that the person, if they were

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:09.220
 so knocked out, they couldn't see the license plate or anything.

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:12.420
 Grab the disc, which has the details of the owner of the car.

00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:14.420
 That's a great idea.

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:15.940
 Yeah, and they never implemented it.

00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:16.540
 I don't know why.

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:19.180
 Possibly, maybe the disc might have decapitated.

00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:22.020
 Someone has shot out of the car.

00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:27.300
 Just involuntary business car dispersal, basically.

00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:31.740
 I like this weird gadget that was added to Volvo's actually.

00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:33.780
 In 2007, it was a car safety thing.

00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:35.140
 It was a smart key.

00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:36.780
 It was a remote smart key, which we have now.

00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:39.340
 So you can open your car from 100 yards away or whatever.

00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:43.020
 And it contained a highly sensitive heartbeat sensor.

00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:44.580
 It advertised itself as a world first.

00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:46.860
 And that meant that when you went to unlock your car,

00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:49.220
 it told you if there was somebody hiding in it.

00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:50.060
 Hide it.

00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:51.140
 Yeah, that's right.

00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:51.940
 It flashed.

00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:53.780
 So if you have 50 yards in your car, you unlocked it.

00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:55.500
 It would give you a little flash to say,

00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:58.180
 there's a person in there, get your weapons out.

00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:00.820
 Really, distinguish, like, human from like Volvo.

00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:02.020
 No, it's specified.

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:03.900
 It will tell if there's a human or an animal.

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:07.020
 So you wouldn't know if it was just a mouse scottling around.

00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:08.620
 Or a person hiding in your boots.

00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:09.140
 Yeah.

00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:10.540
 Better safe than sorry, though.

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:13.340
 But that's never a thing that I've ever thought to check.

00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:16.020
 Well, it's a good way of making your extremely paranoid

00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:17.940
 now when you get into your car.

00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:20.180
 But you know there's always that thing where you're driving,

00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:21.060
 where you have this panic that you're

00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:22.820
 going to look in the rearview mirror

00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:24.900
 and you'll see someone rising up behind you.

00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:26.500
 That's the movie, right?

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:28.340
 I've never had that, and I think you got that.

00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:29.180
 Yeah, of course.

00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:31.340
 Every time you're driving on your own at night.

00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:32.340
 No.

00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:34.620
 I don't know the car, it's tapping isn't what you've got to watch for.

00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:35.620
 Oh, wow.

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:37.460
 That was a ghost story when I was a kid.

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:37.980
 OK.

00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:41.460
 Do you have a big rug on your back seat, which could cover a murder?

00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:43.420
 Just remove the rug.

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:45.180
 Well, it might be, I think we've mentioned this,

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:48.180
 but when the Berlin Wall, when people were trying to get across,

00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:52.060
 there was that couple where the lady who shouldn't have gone across

00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:54.820
 was sewn into the seat of the car.

00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:55.860
 Oh, yeah.

00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:57.420
 So that's another spot you got to worry about.

00:16:57.420 --> 00:16:58.580
 Yeah, check inside the seat.

00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:00.220
 Check inside your seats.

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:01.900
 Check underneath the big rug.

00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:04.660
 If you didn't spot him on the roof or where you got in,

00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:05.660
 that's your own problem.

00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:11.940
 This study that you were mentioning, Andy,

00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:13.180
 this was done in Australia, right?

00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:13.700
 Yeah.

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:14.900
 Yeah.

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:18.940
 And so, Australia is very proud of Pavlova, because we invented it.

00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:22.460
 Been a lot of dispute with the New Zealanders about who invented it.

00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:26.260
 And then I learned, neither of us did, it turns out it's German.

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:27.580
 Is the latest theory.

00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:30.460
 I love that there's theories of Pavlova origin.

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:31.260
 Nice.

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:33.620
 So what, what, what, what's the German origin?

00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:36.060
 It's named after Anna Pavlova, the ballerina,

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:38.860
 because she was touring in Australia and New Zealand

00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:40.900
 at the same time in the late 20s.

00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:43.700
 So that's why both countries think they invented it.

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:46.620
 But really, there had been Pavlova style recipes,

00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:49.060
 you know, you need burang and cream and fruit

00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:50.540
 since the 18th century in Germany.

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:54.980
 So one of them was called a "shown taught" or "foam cake".

00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:57.860
 And another one was called "Spanish wind taught".

00:17:57.860 --> 00:18:01.220
 So they had the thing that just didn't call it Pavlova.

00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:04.420
 I don't know if I'd put the word "wind" in a recipe now,

00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:07.380
 just unless it was sort of a bean recipe or something.

00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:11.220
 She apparently, Anna Pavlova, had more food, named after her.

00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:13.180
 The only one that I could find was frog legs,

00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:14.540
 Ella Pavlova.

00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:15.660
 Is it because she was a ballerina?

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:16.980
 Yeah, frog legs had legs.

00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:19.220
 Yeah, well, it was famous for having good legs.

00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:22.020
 Famously known as what people have legs.

00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:25.220
 You know, so she was an excellent ballerina, not just a ballerina.

00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:29.500
 It's so good and so popular that when she died in 1931,

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:32.060
 when she died of pneumonia, and in fact, when she died,

00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:35.700
 she was diagnosed with pneumonia, told she'd have to have an operation.

00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:37.620
 That would mean she could never dance again.

00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:39.420
 And she said no, I'd rather be dead.

00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:41.620
 So she died in 1931 of pneumonia.

00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:44.940
 And the next show that she was scheduled to do, the audience came,

00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:46.700
 and they put a spotlight on an empty stage

00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:48.980
 and the spotlight followed around exactly where she would have been.

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:51.140
 And they just watched that and said, "Isn't that cool?"

00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:53.300
 That's cool. Not a good excuse to die, though.

00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:55.260
 The whole dancing thing, I would say.

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:57.020
 Well, if it's the one thing you love.

00:18:57.020 --> 00:19:00.460
 If I came back home and said they were like, "Dan, you got pneumonia."

00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:03.620
 "We'll give you an operation, but it means you can't podcast anymore."

00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:06.700
 I think Fonella would have an issue if I said, actually.

00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:07.940
 Send me to the grave.

00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:09.940
 I'd love for you to have that operation.

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:11.580
 I just think for myself.

00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:17.660
 OK, it is time for fact number three, and that is my fact.

00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:20.860
 My fact this week is that Ringo Starr's grandmother

00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:25.180
 performed exorcisms on him to cure him from being left-handed.

00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:25.980
 Wow.

00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:28.460
 She reported to child services, or was that that was before?

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:29.420
 It's a different time.

00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:30.420
 Different time.

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:31.420
 Did it work?

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:32.420
 It did, yeah.

00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:33.580
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:35.500
 Well, for many years it did.

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:38.260
 Because I thought that he said in one interview that he plays

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:40.820
 with the right-handed drum kit, but he sort of leads with his left hand.

00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:41.820
 Yes.

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:42.820
 He does most other things left-handed.

00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:43.820
 Yeah, exactly.

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:44.820
 Doesn't look like it partially works.

00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:47.300
 Maybe by exorcisms, she actually just bought him the right-handed drum kit.

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:49.980
 I think that's why exorcisms will be easier for her.

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:51.940
 Why am she going around doing exorcisms?

00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:55.780
 So Ringo Starr's grandmother, Annie Bauer, she was born in 1889.

00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:59.540
 She was known in Liverpool as the voodoo queen of Liverpool,

00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:00.700
 certainly within the family.

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:01.940
 That's what she was famous for.

00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:04.620
 And she was sort of known as a sort of 20th century witch.

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:06.980
 She used to concoct her own remedies.

00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:11.300
 She would make potions when she was sort of looking after sick people.

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:13.020
 She used to invoke Satan.

00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:15.500
 She used to try and expel Satan from people.

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:19.140
 So to bring him out, doing exorcisms on various people.

00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:22.020
 And so when she saw that her grandson was left-handed,

00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:23.260
 she thought that's the devil.

00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:25.020
 Left-handedness is associated with that.

00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:25.900
 I'm going to get rid of him.

00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:28.980
 And she spent years of him, the devil.

00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:29.820
 Oh, sorry.

00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:30.860
 Yeah, sorry.

00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:35.060
 And so she spent ages trying to exercise it out of him.

00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:39.340
 But what's truly interesting about this is that Ringo says it's for this reason

00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:43.140
 that he developed what became the unique drumming style that he had

00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:45.180
 because he drums on a right-handed drum kit.

00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:48.660
 But as a left-hander, it takes him just a split second more,

00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:51.540
 like a tiny microsecond more to get to that bit of the drum.

00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:53.740
 And that gives him a sort of lazy drumming style

00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:56.540
 that's slightly off time, which gives it a swing.

00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:59.620
 So the negative interpretation is that had he not been exercised

00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:01.740
 as a child, he might have been a better drummer?

00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:03.660
 No, because he's an unbelievable drummer.

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:06.740
 Unless a less unique drummer.

00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:09.220
 He's an incredible drummer.

00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:11.580
 We should talk a bit about the book you've got this from, Dan,

00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:13.580
 because this is from a book called "Is It Tune in?"

00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:14.580
 Yeah.

00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:16.980
 It's "The Bography of the Beatles" by Mark Lewison.

00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:20.100
 This is an amazing book, because it's nearly 1,000 pages long

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:21.940
 and it ends in 1962.

00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:22.540
 Yeah.

00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:24.820
 End as they're releasing their first single.

00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:28.700
 It is good to have that warning that it ends after 1,000 pages

00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:31.780
 just as they start, I think, before you embark on the book.

00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:34.660
 It's like that when you're reading a novel, and it's sort of really crunchy,

00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:37.140
 and you're really near the end, and you're like, "They can't wrap this whole app."

00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:40.300
 And you're like, "No! Turn the pages to the end.

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:41.940
 What they're going to cover their whole career?"

00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:44.580
 And then they did quite well the end.

00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:48.140
 I like the fact that he found the first fan of the Beatles,

00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:48.940
 tracked her down.

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:52.020
 She was an Irish woman called Pat Morin, who lived in Liverpool,

00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:56.180
 and there's another churchy devil connection here,

00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:58.900
 because her father sent her to confession

00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:01.060
 for talking about the Beatles too much.

00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:01.580
 Cool.

00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:03.380
 Which apparently classified as a sin.

00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:05.540
 God, you're clutching its straws if that's your sin.

00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:07.820
 You've got to start rebelling more.

00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:12.020
 Well, they were all, because the Beatles had a very odd effect on girls

00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:14.220
 in that period in the 1960s.

00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:17.500
 There was a book that came out about them that said John Lennon was told.

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:20.620
 Girls in the audience were actively touching themselves

00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:23.380
 in the audience and orgasming while they were playing on stage.

00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:24.380
 They had this kind of craze.

00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:25.860
 And that was in the 1960s.

00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:27.660
 That's a very different world to what we...

00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:29.100
 I don't know. It was a liberated time.

00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:30.020
 Everyone was on air.

00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:31.900
 But they were the people liberating...

00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:33.500
 By causing a lot of public masturbation.

00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:37.300
 So on the way people behaved around the Beatles,

00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:39.340
 they had to be quite heavy security for them all the time.

00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:43.540
 And in fact, they changed the way that the Japanese police operate.

00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:46.700
 So the Japanese police today were white gloves.

00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:48.780
 So if you ever go to the pan using the police, they wear white gloves,

00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:50.540
 and a lot of people have wondered why...

00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:52.180
 It's a Michael Jackson tribute, isn't it?

00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:55.660
 And a lot of people think it's a Michael Jackson tribute,

00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:58.180
 but actually a huge misconception.

00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:00.940
 The Beatles went there in 1966.

00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:04.740
 And the police chief, who was responsible for the police force there,

00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:07.860
 said that there had to be a layer of propriety added between the police

00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:10.420
 and the women, they were inevitably going to be touching

00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:13.820
 as they dragged them away kicking and screaming from the Beatles.

00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:16.140
 And so they all had to wear these white gloves.

00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:19.780
 And he was interviewed in 2010, and he confirmed that.

00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:22.740
 And it was to reinforce this thing called "ragitadashisha",

00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:24.940
 which is sort of a notion of propriety.

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:26.900
 But that's interesting, because I think the Japanese subways

00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:29.060
 famously very, very, very, very busy.

00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:32.140
 And they have people whose job it is to push people into the carriages

00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:33.140
 to make crown more people in.

00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:34.580
 And I'm pretty sure they wear white gloves.

00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:36.820
 So maybe it's a bit more polite rather than shoving you.

00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:38.460
 I mean, officially shoving you.

00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:41.660
 But that move is where they get the song.

00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:43.500
 In fact, that's where they got the inspiration for their song.

00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:44.700
 All you need is glove.

00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:47.140
 Hmm, it's very strong.

00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:49.500
 -Love me, dude. -Love me, dude.

00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:50.940
 A lot of their songs have the word "love" in them.

00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:52.300
 -Let's go through the world. -Let's go through the world.

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:54.340
 The glove album.

00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:55.860
 So the Hamburg days were extraordinary.

00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:57.540
 This is the two years before they basically

00:23:57.540 --> 00:24:00.020
 got into the charts in the very start of the '60s.

00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:02.220
 And they lived in Hamburg, basically,

00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:04.620
 in this storage room behind the stage

00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:06.980
 where they performed in this CD bar.

00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:09.340
 And they sort of lived on fold-out beds,

00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:12.060
 and they had to shower in the public bathrooms in the bar.

00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:14.460
 And that's where they actually got spotted by George Martin,

00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:17.100
 I think, who basically sort of made the Beatles.

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:19.700
 But he thought they were kind of crap in a lot of ways.

00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:21.780
 So he thought they couldn't write songs.

00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:23.220
 They were really keen to write their own songs.

00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:25.540
 And I think he wanted them to release a cover

00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:28.380
 as their first kind of number one, or he intended.

00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:30.980
 And he said their songwriting was crap.

00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:33.580
 The first records we issued were "Love Me Do" and "P.S."

00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:36.860
 "I Love You," which are not exactly cold-pulsar, are they?

00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:38.860
 Which, actually, if you listen to this, it's fair enough.

00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:40.420
 But yeah, he thought they were crap.

00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:43.540
 When they were in Hamburg, they obviously

00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:44.860
 were not making very much money at all.

00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:46.980
 I think they got £2.50 per show.

00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:48.980
 And they had to do four shows on a weeknight,

00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:51.660
 five on a Saturday and six on a Sunday.

00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:53.020
 It's like a Pantos catcher.

00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:54.820
 Yeah, it really is.

00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:56.740
 And then they got offered from a rival club.

00:24:56.740 --> 00:24:58.860
 And so the boss of the first club they'd been working at,

00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:02.620
 reported George Harrison to the police and got him deported.

00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:05.340
 And then, the same manager had already had it in for them.

00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:07.140
 He got McCartney, I can't believe this.

00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:09.100
 He got McCartney and Pete Best arrested

00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:11.700
 and deported for setting fire to a condom.

00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:15.940
 Oh, I don't understand why.

00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:18.500
 Surely it doesn't take two people to set fire to a condom.

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:20.460
 I want to hold a condom, I want to light the match.

00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:23.740
 I'm trying to light a match with one hand.

00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:25.100
 We should say we're talking about their Hamburg days,

00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:27.500
 but Ringo wasn't there for their Hamburg days.

00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:29.900
 So they were a five-man operation.

00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:32.580
 Many people say the superior version.

00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:35.140
 So that was with Pete Best and Stuart Zuckercliffe.

00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:36.060
 Yeah.

00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:38.180
 Just on the fact, Pete Best left the Beatles

00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:40.700
 and he didn't go on to anything major.

00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:43.420
 So Ringo Starr, as well as the Beatles,

00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:46.220
 his other big thing was he was the voice of Thomas the Tank Engine.

00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:47.540
 Series one.

00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:49.940
 And I found another sort of rock connection

00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:53.020
 of someone who left a band just before it got big.

00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:54.580
 And it relates to Thomas the Tank Engine.

00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:58.420
 Timothy Steffel was the lead singer of a band called Smile.

00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:01.260
 And then he left because he thought the band was going nowhere.

00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:04.260
 So the guitarist and the drummer brought in a new singer

00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:05.660
 called Freddie Mercury.

00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:08.540
 And that band was Queen, obviously.

00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:12.380
 And so Smile was Roger Taylor, Brian May, and Timothy Steffel.

00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:13.420
 Steffel left.

00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:15.820
 But he found a second career as a model maker

00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:18.140
 for all the trains on Thomas the Tank Engine.

00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:19.940
 Oh, my God.

00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:21.260
 Ringo Starr.

00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:22.300
 That was incredible.

00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:23.260
 That's really cool.

00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:25.780
 Because the fact controller in Thomas the Tank Engine

00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:29.420
 was played by Bill Wyman after he left the Rolling Stone.

00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:30.420
 You're kidding.

00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:31.900
 Yeah, I'm kidding.

00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:33.420
 Done for God's sake.

00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:35.140
 Sorry, I was getting so excited.

00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:36.500
 I think it's time to come in three.

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:37.620
 Yeah, exactly.

00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:39.660
 There's probably probably is one more rock connection

00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:41.460
 to come up with the tank around the whereabouts.

00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:42.980
 Listeners, find it.

00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:46.060
 Just one-- another thing about Ringo's life post Beatles.

00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:47.460
 Possibly the highlight of his career

00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:50.100
 was when he did a pizza advert in 1995.

00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:51.500
 This was a seminal moment, because it

00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:55.900
 was when the stuffed crust of Pizza Hut fame came into being.

00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:58.660
 And it was this great advert where he sort of threw out

00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:00.380
 the addy's pretending he was getting the band back together.

00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:02.260
 And it's like, oh, I've got to convince them.

00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:03.260
 Oh, they'll never do it.

00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:03.780
 Come on.

00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:04.740
 You should watch the advert.

00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:05.940
 Getting the band back together.

00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:08.220
 Lenin had been dead for 14 years at this point.

00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:12.460
 Yeah, it was a sick advert, OK?

00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:14.700
 So he makes us seem like he's going to resurrect John Lenin's

00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:15.860
 dead body.

00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:17.500
 Probably needed his grandmother for that.

00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:20.060
 [LAUGHTER]

00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:23.020
 So he's in this advert saying, I'll get the band back together.

00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:25.140
 Until it becomes clear at the end, what he's actually saying

00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:29.740
 is, I'm going to convince them all to eat pizza crust first.

00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:31.060
 And then there's this really awkward moment

00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:33.660
 where in the final scene, his three apparent bandmates

00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:35.860
 come on and start eating it crust first.

00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:37.380
 Anyway, it's a humorous advert.

00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:39.940
 The amusing thing is, he's never eaten a pizza in his life.

00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:42.020
 He watched that advert as it goes towards his mouth,

00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:44.180
 the advert ends, because he's allergic to all

00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:45.500
 the ingredients of pizza.

00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:46.780
 All the ingredients of pizza.

00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:47.660
 Every ingredient.

00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:49.700
 He's allergic to onions, garlic, spices.

00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:51.020
 He's allergic to all this stuff.

00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:53.020
 Never had a pizza, never had a curry.

00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:54.780
 We need to move on.

00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:57.180
 I can just mention one last thing, and then we'll move on.

00:27:57.180 --> 00:27:58.940
 And so Pete Bess, the original drummer.

00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:01.220
 He was kicked out, which was devastating for him.

00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:02.620
 But he continued to be a musician

00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:05.140
 after he got over a bit of a depressive stage.

00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:06.500
 And he went on to release an album

00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:10.820
 called Best of the Beatles, which a lot of people accidentally

00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:13.460
 bought, by mistake, thinking it was a compilation

00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:14.460
 of the greatest hits.

00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:15.620
 Best of not the best of all.

00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:16.620
 Exactly.

00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:17.820
 He claimed the wrong word.

00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:24.020
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show.

00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:26.220
 And that is Juzinski.

00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:28.540
 My fact this week is that baby albatrosses

00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:34.060
 can take up to six days to peck their way out of their eggs.

00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:37.500
 Imagine being trapped somewhere in the dark six days.

00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:38.820
 It's like the Great Escape.

00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:40.300
 And this is called Pipping.

00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:42.140
 So what happens is they've got the egg tooth, which

00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:44.140
 a lot of birds have, which is a sort of hard projection

00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:45.180
 on their bills.

00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:48.380
 And they peck away at the shell from the inside.

00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:51.300
 And on average, albatross chicks take about 3.5 days

00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:53.300
 to emerge, but some of them are weaker ones,

00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:55.700
 the thicker-shelled ones, they take up to a week

00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:57.020
 to make their way out.

00:28:57.020 --> 00:28:58.060
 That's interesting, yeah.

00:28:58.060 --> 00:28:59.540
 And I think part of them will emerge,

00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:00.700
 and they can sort of be fed.

00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:03.620
 So you do see eggs with sort of a head sticking out.

00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:05.460
 And it's like you've gone on the couple of days left, mate.

00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:07.020
 But if you're going to help them by feeding them,

00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:08.860
 could you not help them open their egg?

00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:11.220
 You've got to let kids learn for themselves.

00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:13.060
 We're albatrosses to start.

00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:15.140
 OK, time to fledge.

00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:17.580
 I'm not ready to fledge them in the egg.

00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:20.180
 They sometimes lose their eggs, albatrosses.

00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:22.380
 So most of them keep them in a nest.

00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:24.340
 And we should say there are 20 species of albatrosses,

00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:25.140
 which I didn't like.

00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:27.940
 But some of them waved albatrosses quite mobile,

00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:29.980
 and they will move their egg around their territory

00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:31.340
 with them as they go.

00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:33.380
 And frequently they just lose them.

00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:36.140
 So 80% of the anguish don't hatch are because they get lost.

00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:36.700
 Really?

00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:37.220
 Yeah.

00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:39.460
 I think you always get in calls from sort of restaurants saying,

00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:43.180
 excuse me, sorry, I think you left your egg on the wrong table.

00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:45.540
 But albatrosses are generally, apart from the ones

00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:46.900
 who lose their eggs, quite good parents.

00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:48.780
 So albatrosses, a couple of them, they say,

00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:50.300
 and these parents dropped to 50 years.

00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:52.420
 But they're not completely monogamous.

00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:55.060
 So they did a study of 75 different albatrosses.

00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:57.540
 And 10% of them had different fathers

00:29:57.540 --> 00:29:59.700
 to the albatross raising them.

00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:02.020
 But both the male and the female albatrosses

00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:03.820
 will go and be with other albatrosses.

00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:06.160
 But they'll always come back to their home albatross.

00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:07.300
 Yeah.

00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:13.100
 But so they are 100% faithful, as a, let's say,

00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:15.700
 in a married couple, as a married couple, let's say,

00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:16.500
 in quotations.

00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:17.860
 They pair for life.

00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:20.860
 But if this is your view of faithfulness as a married man,

00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:23.220
 then I dread to think of another's listening right now.

00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:24.300
 No, no, no, no.

00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:25.940
 What I dread was there was a book that came out

00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:28.460
 called "The Thing with Feathers" by Noah Stryker.

00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:31.060
 And Noah Stryker did basically a table

00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:33.260
 of bird divorce rates for this book.

00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:36.620
 He looked at 100 or so different species of birds,

00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:38.380
 and he built the divorce rates.

00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:41.620
 And at the top of the most faithful in terms

00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:44.020
 of remaining with a single partner for their whole life

00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:45.380
 was the albatross.

00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:48.340
 And flamingos were right at the bottom.

00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:50.500
 They have a 99% divorce rate.

00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:51.740
 Wow.

00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:53.100
 But basically, what we're saying is albatrosses

00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:54.300
 have open marriages.

00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:55.900
 Yeah, on both sides.

00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:56.700
 Yeah, OK.

00:30:56.700 --> 00:30:58.900
 Do you know why albatrosses tend not

00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:00.540
 to go to divorce lawyers?

00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:01.860
 Because the bill too big.

00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:03.700
 The bills are huge.

00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:06.300
 When one of us immediately guessed the punchline to your joke

00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:08.940
 at it is worth reconsidering.

00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:10.300
 That's quite an interesting thing, actually,

00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:11.940
 about these open relationships.

00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:14.500
 And this is related to the lason albatross

00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:16.340
 which lives around the Hawaiian Islands.

00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:17.940
 They have this weird gender imbalance.

00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:20.300
 59% of them are female on there.

00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:22.860
 And that's just because a lot of females immigrated there.

00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:25.100
 So they often separate in their flying season.

00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:29.580
 And this means that 31% of lason albatross pairs

00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:31.220
 are female on female.

00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:32.420
 They raise chicks together.

00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:35.540
 So the males will inseminate a series of females

00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:37.900
 and can only raise one egg at a time.

00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:40.500
 And so the other women who've been abandoned by their man

00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:42.180
 find another lady.

00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:43.420
 And they raise the egg together.

00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:45.140
 And they will stay together for a lifetime.

00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:47.460
 Just like just like male female pairs.

00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:49.460
 And they're pretty successful raising the chicks.

00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:51.540
 The lason albatrosses are really interesting.

00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:54.860
 They do their courting, viral dance

00:31:54.860 --> 00:31:58.020
 that they have, which is an established dance.

00:31:58.020 --> 00:32:01.180
 What they do is, when they're about three years of age,

00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:05.180
 they go back to their birthplace and they all meet there

00:32:05.180 --> 00:32:07.300
 and they learn the dance as a group.

00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:09.660
 And then eventually, they find their partner

00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:11.220
 when they're ready to court.

00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:12.460
 It's this-- - They're very intricate.

00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:14.300
 But it does take years of practice.

00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:16.660
 So actually, we've got these people who listen

00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:20.060
 to our show who are so great called Michelle and Chris.

00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:22.980
 And they work with albatrosses out on Goff Island.

00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:24.460
 These really endangered albatrosses.

00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:25.460
 - Where's Goff Island, sorry?

00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:27.260
 - Goff Island is in the South Atlantic.

00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:28.100
 So yeah, they work with them.

00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:30.660
 And anyway, one of them wrote to me and said that display

00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:32.340
 is it's like head bobbing.

00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:33.860
 It's wings spreading.

00:32:33.860 --> 00:32:36.380
 They make these bubbling sounds in their throats.

00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:38.100
 And yeah, they practice for years and years

00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:39.180
 before they're ready.

00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:40.100
 Imagine if you're flirting.

00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:41.740
 You have to practice flirting for--

00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:43.260
 - I mean, I did.

00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:44.100
 (laughing)

00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:47.100
 And for years and years, you know, you're interested.

00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:49.980
 So this is bringing a lot of might be an albatross.

00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:52.540
 They do have kind of singles bars where they go.

00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:53.740
 Some side species do.

00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:56.060
 Well, yeah, they have things all gams.

00:32:56.060 --> 00:32:58.460
 So this is for Southern Bullers albatrosses.

00:32:58.460 --> 00:32:59.860
 When they're aged about eight years old,

00:32:59.860 --> 00:33:02.580
 the males all go ashore and they make a nest.

00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:05.660
 And then the females visit and they have a look around

00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:08.020
 and they're like, you know, whether they like it or not,

00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:11.260
 but they only form a pair in their fourth year on shore.

00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:12.740
 They've already been through three years

00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:15.980
 of prospecting each other and checking each other out.

00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:17.180
 - It's like university.

00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:18.660
 - It's exactly like university.

00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:19.660
 - Per-up at the end.

00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:20.500
 - Yeah.

00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:21.340
 And four years.

00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:23.620
 So we know it's a Scottish or American university, for example.

00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:27.180
 - So my favourite albatross is, have you heard of Albert,

00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:28.580
 the lonely Scottish albatross?

00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:29.580
 - No.

00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:31.860
 - Albert, very sadly, was blown off course

00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:34.620
 in the South Atlantic in 1967 and rocked off in Scotland

00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:36.900
 where he's been living as a bachelor ever since.

00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:39.140
 He's not yet found and made.

00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:41.060
 - Can't he part with a puffin or something?

00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:42.060
 Size difference.

00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:43.260
 (laughing)

00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:45.740
 And these things don't get in the way of true love.

00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:47.340
 Yeah, so he's living between.

00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:49.820
 Yeah, he lives between the Alter Hebrides and Shetland.

00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:51.140
 - Are there people around where he is?

00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:53.060
 Or is he just monitored?

00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:54.500
 - He's been seen by Broadway shows,

00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:56.300
 but I think he's a little weaker albatross.

00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:57.140
 It's not people.

00:33:57.140 --> 00:33:57.980
 - Oh my god.

00:33:57.980 --> 00:33:58.820
 - He's just idea.

00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:00.620
 - As a bird watcher, if you're spending your whole life

00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:01.940
 around blue tits and sparrows,

00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:04.700
 that is fucking exciting when a giant albatross

00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:06.340
 appears on their horizon.

00:34:06.340 --> 00:34:07.500
 'Cause they are massive.

00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:09.060
 They've got, I think the Wingspan,

00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:11.860
 the Wondering Albatross Wingspan is 3.5 meters, is it?

00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:12.700
 - 3.5 meters.

00:34:12.700 --> 00:34:13.700
 - They're ridiculously huge.

00:34:13.700 --> 00:34:14.540
 - It's big.

00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:16.620
 - Anyway, I just want to talk about the Tristan albatross,

00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:18.180
 which is the second biggest albatross.

00:34:18.180 --> 00:34:20.220
 So people thought it was in the same species

00:34:20.220 --> 00:34:24.180
 as the Wondering, and then it split away in 1998.

00:34:24.180 --> 00:34:27.100
 Anyway, these are the albatrosses that are friends

00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:30.340
 and podcast listeners, Michelle and Chris look after

00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:33.180
 on Goff Island, because the most amazing thing

00:34:33.180 --> 00:34:34.340
 has been happening to them.

00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:37.340
 So they're obviously huge, but they don't have any natural

00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:39.140
 predators 'cause they're alone on this island.

00:34:39.140 --> 00:34:40.780
 And so they have no defense mechanisms.

00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:45.260
 So invasive mice arrived on the island a few decades ago,

00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:47.020
 and they've just been eating them.

00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:47.860
 - Oh no.

00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:49.780
 - So these, it's unbelievable.

00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:53.300
 So these tiny little mice, you'll get a 20 gram mouse,

00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:56.780
 and it will just eat away at 10 kilogram albatross chick.

00:34:56.780 --> 00:34:58.340
 Or sometimes I'll even eat the adults,

00:34:58.340 --> 00:35:00.060
 so that adults will stay with the chicks

00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:01.500
 and let themselves be eaten by mice

00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:03.020
 because they're so afraid to leave.

00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:03.860
 - Wow.

00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:05.460
 - That chick is really, really sad,

00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:07.220
 and so they become critically endangered

00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:08.060
 because of this.

00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:08.900
 - But they must have.

00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:09.740
 - They sit there.

00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:11.780
 - What do you mean they have no, they can move?

00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:12.620
 - They sit there.

00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:13.900
 - Have they lost the ability to think,

00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:17.460
 if I smack it with my giant wing, it will fling off.

00:35:17.460 --> 00:35:19.740
 - They don't have the ability to think that.

00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:20.580
 - It's incredible.

00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:21.580
 So what is happening, too?

00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:23.580
 - So what's happening is this team of people

00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:25.660
 have gone out there, and so these three guys,

00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:27.180
 two of whom are Michelle and Christopher,

00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:29.340
 are now trying to save the albatross

00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:31.140
 is essentially by killing all the mice.

00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:33.100
 And we're getting them back guys.

00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:34.900
 But it's, yeah, it's a good cause there.

00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:38.740
 I think there are 1,500 to 2,400 pairs left at the moment,

00:35:38.740 --> 00:35:41.100
 and it's quite funny when you look them up on Wikipedia,

00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:44.020
 it said, "Cause albatrosses fly hundreds of thousands

00:35:44.020 --> 00:35:47.620
 of miles so far, but they only breed in this tiny island."

00:35:47.620 --> 00:35:52.300
 So they have an occurrence range of 5.4 million square miles,

00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:54.660
 and a breeding range of 31 square miles.

00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:55.660
 - Wow.

00:35:55.660 --> 00:35:59.340
 - So flipped on a different way of talking about it,

00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:01.300
 there's another podcast out there talking about

00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:03.540
 two mice murderers on Godfatherland.

00:36:03.540 --> 00:36:05.420
 - Yeah, they moved in.

00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:06.700
 - They've gone, they live on this island,

00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:08.820
 they just murder mice all day.

00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:11.060
 - I mean, the mice are impressive, they're like super mice.

00:36:11.060 --> 00:36:13.340
 So to be fair, they are, I think they're the biggest mice

00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:14.180
 in the world.

00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:15.020
 - Wow.

00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:17.100
 - In fact, 'cause they've got island gigantism,

00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:18.980
 they know where you've got nothing threatening you,

00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:19.900
 you're the only ones there.

00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:20.740
 - So they're huge.

00:36:20.740 --> 00:36:22.540
 If you're on the mouse's side, they're doing bloody well.

00:36:22.540 --> 00:36:24.500
 - Sounds like your two friends are very small.

00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:27.060
 (laughing)

00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:27.900
 - They are.

00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:29.740
 They've got island dwarfism, these two humans.

00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:31.420
 They've been there too long.

00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:33.020
 - Have you guys heard of wisdom?

00:36:33.020 --> 00:36:33.860
 - Wisdom, the albatross.

00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:34.820
 - Yes, I believe I embody it.

00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:36.660
 - Well, I'm not sure.

00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:39.140
 So wisdom is a laser in albatross,

00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:40.540
 like the ones we were talking earlier.

00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:42.660
 So she's the oldest albatross in the world.

00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:45.020
 She was first ringed in 1956.

00:36:45.020 --> 00:36:46.100
 She's still alive.

00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:48.460
 So she's at least 64 years old.

00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:50.100
 And in fact, we know she's a bit older,

00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:52.300
 'cause when she was ringed, the scientist who ringed her

00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:54.140
 said, "Well, she's about five years old."

00:36:54.140 --> 00:36:56.140
 She was still alive in 2018.

00:36:56.140 --> 00:36:57.780
 And this is the really cool thing.

00:36:57.780 --> 00:37:01.060
 The biologist who first found her in 1956 and ringed her

00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:03.780
 was an ornithologist called Chandler Robbins.

00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:05.340
 Okay, so he ringed her, went away.

00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:08.380
 Then in 2002, 46 years later,

00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:10.580
 he tries to ring another albatross and says,

00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:12.700
 "Oh, this is already ringed."

00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:15.660
 And it's the bird I ringed 46 years ago.

00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:16.900
 That is a bit annoying, though, isn't it?

00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:19.740
 If you're hoping to get to an albatross.

00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:22.500
 It wasn't his second albatross.

00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:24.900
 It's whole life for the same albatross.

00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:25.740
 It's incredible.

00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:27.620
 He is an amazing figure in terms of

00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:28.780
 Ornithology and Birdwatching.

00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:31.300
 He died in 2017, Asian 98.

00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:32.420
 And that's partly, you know,

00:37:32.420 --> 00:37:34.140
 albatrosses often outlive the research

00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:34.980
 that's working on them.

00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:35.820
 That's incredible.

00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:36.980
 That's a long lived year.

00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:38.900
 Do they live, do they have albatross years?

00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:40.100
 Like, you know, had dog years,

00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:41.180
 different to human years?

00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:42.980
 I think they just live a really long time.

00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:45.740
 So they're like, they're in conjo-- they're year is our year.

00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:47.700
 Well, we don't know because people,

00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:49.020
 dog years aren't really a thing,

00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:50.620
 except for the fact that dogs are our pets.

00:37:50.620 --> 00:37:52.500
 And so we speculate about that kind of bullshit,

00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:54.380
 whereas people don't have many pet albatrosses.

00:37:54.380 --> 00:37:55.340
 It's not official.

00:37:55.340 --> 00:37:56.340
 Dog years is not unofficial.

00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:57.740
 Well, what do you think dog years means?

00:37:57.740 --> 00:37:59.700
 They don't know their own birthdays.

00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:01.260
 No, it's about celebrations.

00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:04.260
 It's about time passage and lifespan, right?

00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:05.100
 Yes, that's true.

00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:07.260
 So the lifespan is about 60.

00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:08.540
 Yeah, in albatross years?

00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:09.940
 Oh, my god.

00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:12.540
 We're going to have to wrap up in a second.

00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:14.300
 Just one more thing, albatrosses,

00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:16.420
 when Western explorers first discovered them,

00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:18.020
 they thought they were sheep.

00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:19.180
 No, flying sheep.

00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:21.900
 That's right, just big old flying sheep, really?

00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:23.620
 Well, this is according to these researchers

00:38:23.620 --> 00:38:25.020
 they were in touch with, but apparently,

00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:26.700
 the explorer Marian de Fresno,

00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:31.060
 when he visited in 1772, he visited Prince Edward Island.

00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:33.500
 And he just saw these huge white figures

00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:35.060
 wandering around the grass and said,

00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:36.620
 "Well, there's a whole bunch of sheep here."

00:38:36.620 --> 00:38:37.460
 Great.

00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:39.060
 So did he get really close up to them?

00:38:39.060 --> 00:38:41.660
 He did, I think the man's an idiot.

00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:42.500
 He was stroking.

00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:45.620
 He was going, "This wool is not the same as ours."

00:38:45.620 --> 00:38:47.460
 They measure their speed with their nostrils.

00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:49.540
 They have these tubes inside their nose.

00:38:49.540 --> 00:38:51.980
 And it's exactly the same as how planes measure their speed.

00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:54.300
 So planes have things called pito tubes,

00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:56.540
 which measure airflow and pressure at the end of that tube.

00:38:56.540 --> 00:38:58.380
 And that tells you how fast the plane is moving.

00:38:58.380 --> 00:38:59.220
 Wow.

00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:00.220
 And albatrosses can do the same thing.

00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:01.220
 Wow.

00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:02.220
 Yeah.

00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:03.220
 Wonder where they need to know their speed.

00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:05.700
 Do you think they get back and go, cracked 70?

00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:06.700
 Personal best.

00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:09.500
 I don't know, mate, there's a bill here for speeding.

00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:10.740
 And it's a huge bill.

00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:12.740
 [LAUGHTER]

00:39:12.740 --> 00:39:18.900
 OK, that is it.

00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:19.820
 That is all of our facts.

00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:21.100
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:22.900

 Or no such thing as a fish.com.

00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:43.180
 We have everything up there from our previous episodes

00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:45.460

00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:46.980
 that you can download.

00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:50.140
 And hey, why not also go to amazon.co.uk

00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:53.220
 and get Andy's new book, as we said at the top of the show.

00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:54.540
 It's out now.

00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:55.300
 Kids will love it.

00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:56.500
 Mickey and the animal spies.

00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:59.660
 It's called, it's all this GCHQ kind of stuff in it

00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:01.340
 with codes to crack and more code.

00:40:01.340 --> 00:40:04.340
 You'll learn more code by the end of the book, which is amazing.

00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:06.260
 And yeah, so go and get it for your kids.

00:40:06.260 --> 00:40:07.180
 It's awesome.

00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:08.660
 OK, we'll be back again next week.

00:40:08.660 --> 00:40:09.380
 We'll see you then.

00:40:09.380 --> 00:40:11.060
 Goodbye.
