00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680
 We run it on QI a few years ago.

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:02.160
 Yeah.

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.360
 And which was, there's no such thing as a fish.

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:05.680
 It's kind of a nice such thing as a fish.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.960
 No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.600
 It says it right there, first paragraph, no such thing as a fish.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:25.200
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.680
 a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.680
 My name is Dan Triber.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.240
 I'm sitting here with the regular three elves, Andy Murray, Anna Chazinski,

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.280
 and James Harkin.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.480
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.320
 to share our favorite facts from the last seven days.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.760
 So again, let's do it.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.720
 Our favorite facts, James.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.480
 My fact is that in 1903, a man called W. Reginald Bray

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.880
 posted himself.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:51.880
 Wow.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:52.640
 How?

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.640
 How?

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.720
 He stuck a stamp on himself and walked down to the post office

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.120
 and said, I want to be taken to a house, which happens to be his own house.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.240
 And they took him.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.240
 Yeah.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.920
 Was it a slow day for him?

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:05.920
 Finished his book?

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.960
 I didn't know what to do.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.680
 He was a bit of a wager, a bit of a practical joker.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.800
 And one of the things he did was he read through all of the post office

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.040
 guide and worked out what the smallest and largest things he could post were.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.800
 So he discovered that the smallest item that he could post was 1b.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.600
 And so he posted that.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.000
 And the largest was an elephant, but he couldn't find an elephant.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.600
 So he posted himself.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.600
 What year was this?

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.600
 1903.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.600
 1903.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.320
 It sounds like, because there's so many examples of people just testing the limits of the

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:40.320
 posting system.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.320
 Yeah.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.960
 Like just a bunch of practical jokers going, how far can we push this?

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.120
 There was a guy who sent an entire building's worth of bricks, because he was building a

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:54.760
 bank in a different city and the cheapest way was just to send the bricks via the post.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:55.760
 Oh my god.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:56.760
 Were they individually wrapped?

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.760
 No, I think that's what I hoped they were.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.760
 That would be a brilliant admin job for someone that's sticking the stamps on and putting them in.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.760
 Yeah, Alex would love that.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.600
 He sent them at 40 at a time.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.600
 They must have not introduced weight limits then.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.320
 That must have been when they did it by size.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.320
 That's where they brought it.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.320
 That's where they introduced the scales.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.760
 That's when they brought it in, Â£200 per day, the limit that they then imposed.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.000
 There's a weird history of people posting themselves.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 It's not just this guy.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.400
 There's been a few cents.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.000
 A guy called Mr. Seng.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.680
 I'm not sure where he was from.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.040
 He decided to post himself in a sealed box and he thought it would just be a 30-minute

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:36.980
 journey, but they put him in the wrong pile and he was stuck in there for three hours and

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.680
 he didn't make a hole in his box so he could hardly breathe and when they cut him out, he'd

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:46.080
 passed out and when they interviewed him in the newspaper afterwards, he said, "I tried

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.840
 to make a hole in the cardboard, but it was too thick and I didn't want to spoil the surprise

00:02:50.840 --> 00:03:00.440
 by shouting, 'Wow!' That was a real dedication to a surprise.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.620
 But then he couldn't really jump out and say surprise because he passed out.

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.440
 And was it a good surprise or was it like he was a burglar and he was going to jump out

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.760
 and then round sack of house?

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:18.320
 Well there was a guy who posted himself, what was it now, okay so there was a guy who decided

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.880
 he wanted to cross America and he was called Mr. McKinley, I don't know what his first

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:23.880
 name was.

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:29.240
 And he decided to be better to go in a box because he could charge the postage to his company

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.120
 rather than paying for the ticket which you have to pay for himself.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.200
 That's how I get to work every day, it's the same thing here.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.200
 Sorry going.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.080
 Yeah, you're always arriving by second post, don't you?

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.080
 Oh snap.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.080
 Oh snap.

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:49.800
 I won't mind but I'm very far the latest of it. So he built the $550 freight charge to

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.960
 his employer and climbed into the crate.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:56.200
 Of course by being in a plane he was lucky, he was in a plane which was like air conditioning

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.880
 and stuff but a lot of them, it's very dangerous because they're you know it's very cold

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.480
 for you to die in that.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.600
 Do you know you used to be able to send children by post, right?

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:06.600
 Yeah.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.800
 You used to be able to post children around the place.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.120
 Until 1920 was it in the US anyway?

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.120
 Yeah.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.120
 It was banned officially.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.120
 And until around then.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:19.560
 But you would buy the stamps and you would put the stamps on the child's jacket and then

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.560
 the child would sit in for example the mail van of the train and they were a bit of post.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.280
 And you could I think you could lump all your posts together because there are pictures

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:33.680
 of children with posts strapped to them and then they turn up and be like not only an icon.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.840
 Just going back to W Reginald Bray.

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:36.840
 Oh yeah.

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.680
 He has his own website which I didn't know.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:39.680
 He's amazing.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.000
 Yeah but the website is absolutely fantastic.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.840
 He collected a lot of autographs so he sent thousands of cards out to people asking them

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:53.240
 to be returned autographed to the Pope or his local railway station master and on the website

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:58.320
 it has this lovely line which is over the years Reginald amassed over 15,000 autographs declaring

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:03.000
 himself the autograph king, a title that was undisputed by his peers.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:12.200
 Imagine you were like his pretender.

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.720
 I think you wouldn't tell him that you had all these autographs and then you go up to him

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.440
 and go excuse me you the guy who's got the most autographs in the world.

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:23.280
 Which you mind just signing that and then when he signed it you have a beat.

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.040
 Yeah you have one over him.

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.040
 Oh that's good.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.040
 That's very cool.

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.040
 Yeah.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:56.280
 So I think you're not allowed to transport helium in any way because it's explosive isn't

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.280
 it?

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.280
 Yeah.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.040
 They were wrapping helium in a balloon.

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.040
 In a rubber.

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.040
 That's true.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.040
 Yeah.

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:07.080
 So one of the most common questions that gets us to the US postal system is can you mail

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.280
 a dog?

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:13.240
 They get this question all the time, says spokesperson Sue Brennan.

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.720
 The answer is no.

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:15.880
 Can't mail a dog.

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:16.880
 No.

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.320
 The whole point of postman and dogs is that they don't get along.

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:23.600
 Can you imagine a dog in a sorting office?

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:27.960
 It's actually they've worked out how many for some reason they've only done this in Germany

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:32.800
 but three thousand postman a year a bit and buy dogs in Germany and two thousand two

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:37.600
 hundred and fifty five pairs of trousers are torn resulting in eight million pounds worth

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:38.600
 of medical bills.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:44.000
 In 2001 the German post office started teaching dog psychology to postman.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.440
 It's just it's just a permanent ongoing war.

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:47.440
 Postman.

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:48.440
 Yeah.

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:49.440
 Dog battle.

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.320
 Because the postman are not allowed to carry weapons.

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:52.320
 And dogs are?

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:53.320
 They are weapons.

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:56.160
 Oh, that's that's not a mate.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:02.760
 That's like saying that was it Joe Lewis who had his his fists designated a weapon.

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:03.760
 Jackie Chan.

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:06.440
 I've always heard about this and I've never believed it.

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:07.440
 Is it true?

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:09.920
 I think I think when you say you've always heard it, I think it's me literally repeating

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:10.920
 it.

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:11.920
 Yeah.

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:12.920
 Most days.

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:17.440
 Jackie Chan told Wuppie Goldberg and a number of others on the view that when he's in

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:23.720
 America, he is considered his fists to be an illegal weapon.

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.760
 Do you get all of your facts from the view?

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:30.240
 Actually, no, I don't because they're a bit I remember watching an episode where they were

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:34.120
 talking about the possibility that the moon landings didn't happen that it was a hoax

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:38.400
 and Wuppie Goldberg was going, I don't want to like speculate about the truth about it,

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:42.960
 but all I'm saying is, you know, who was filming Neil when he went down on the ladder?

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:44.200
 Who was holding that camera?

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:45.200
 I don't want to speculate.

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:51.120
 It's like, Wuppie, you know, Wuppie Goldberg got her nickname due to her childhood flatulence.

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.120
 Oh, yeah.

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:53.120
 She was a big fighter.

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.120
 Yeah.

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:55.120
 She, Wuppie.

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.120
 Yeah, that's right.

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:57.120
 That's good.

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:58.120
 Yeah.

00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:59.120
 And she worked in a morgue, didn't she?

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:00.120
 Yeah, she.

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:01.120
 I might mention it.

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:02.600
 But putting makeup on corpses and then everyone, when she works in everyone's like, what's

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:03.600
 that smell?

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:04.600
 Yeah.

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:07.400
 It's not like people just woke up and walks out.

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:08.400
 Oh god.

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:09.400
 Who was it?

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:10.400
 Did someone send a load of wasps?

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:11.400
 Yes.

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:16.760
 You can make wasps go to sleep and they were sent on a flight and the flight was delayed

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:18.320
 or something and they all woke up.

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:24.800
 You can still buy parasitic wasps through the post and therefore, like pest control instead

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.520
 of using pesticides, you can use them.

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:30.640
 And then what do you get mail to you to get rid of the parasitic wasps in the infestation

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:31.960
 that you've now got?

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:34.160
 Then you get a spider to catch the fly.

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:35.160
 Fly, yeah.

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:39.440
 There was always a big flaw in that song because cows don't eat dogs.

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:48.360
 Okay, time for fact number two and that is my fact.

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:54.920
 My fact this week is that the oldest edible ham has just celebrated its 112th birthday.

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:56.280
 So how do we know it's edible?

00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:59.320
 Oh, because it's quite a famous ham.

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:04.160
 It first came to prominence when it celebrated its 100th birthday and someone has since

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:08.400
 bought it and I guess anytime it has a birthday now, people mention it.

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:12.760
 So I wanted to dispute this claim because my local butcher, Mr. Feller, best butcher in

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:13.760
 the world.

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:14.760
 You guys should all go to him.

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:18.400
 And we sponsored by Mr. Feller now.

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:22.040
 I have been past Mr. Feller's place in the cover market and I can confirm there is a very

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:23.040
 old ham in the winter.

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:29.480
 Yeah, so he claims I think he bought it in 1993 when it was 101.

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:33.800
 It cost him 990 pounds but he said he would have paid at least five grand for it because

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:34.800
 it was so special.

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:42.360
 It is now 125 he says and he says that when he bought it from the auctioneer that was selling

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:45.440
 off, they said they weren't sure it was edible, but he's the butcher.

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:46.440
 He should know.

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:47.440
 Why is he not in the news?

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:48.440
 Why is he not?

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:49.440
 It hasn't been proven.

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.440
 Hasn't officially verified.

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:52.440
 Is this like the autograph guy?

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:53.440
 Like no one else can be bothered.

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:57.640
 They're like, yeah, we have way older ham dude but like we don't need the title of world

00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:58.640
 oldest ham.

00:09:58.640 --> 00:09:59.640
 I think he's above that.

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:00.640
 Yeah.

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:01.640
 Wow.

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:07.160
 But to the world's tallest man who I think was certified the world's tallest man and then

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:12.480
 he refused to do the tests anymore so they stripped him of his title and I think there

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:16.920
 is another man who is now officially the world's tallest man but actually is slightly shorter

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:17.920
 than the previous man.

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:19.960
 Why did he refuse to be remeasured?

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:24.320
 He doesn't want the hassle of being the world's tallest man because when you're the world's

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:27.280
 tallest man, people come to see you as if you're an attraction.

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:33.800
 I remember reading this odd fact about the idea that there are no children in the town

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:38.800
 not because he's scared them away but just because there's too much hassle to have a super

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:41.840
 tall guy and kids in the same town.

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:44.240
 I can't remember the exact fact but it was...

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:50.040
 It's Operation Here's the Size of a Utrecht.

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:51.580
 Old things that have been eaten.

00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:56.760
 A German pensioner who received a tin of American lard 64 years ago in an aid package has

00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:00.180
 only just tasted it after discovering that it is still edible.

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:01.180
 Oh wow.

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:04.180
 I just didn't want to throw it away, said Hans Feldmeyer 87.

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:10.320
 So that's the spirit which makes people keep ham for decades when it's just the not very

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:11.320
 nice ham.

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:12.320
 Yeah.

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:17.000
 In 2005 we found a 4,000 year old bowl of noodles in China which I quite like that they're

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.720
 still in the bowl and that settled the debate because there's quite a heated debate I think

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:27.600
 between Chinese Arabs and Italians over who first came up with the noodle and that's the

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.000
 oldest evidence of a noodle.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.320
 So China's got it at the moment.

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:38.200
 Speaking of well preserved food there's obviously the Kiviac, the Inuit food which is made

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:41.520
 from orcs that are preserved in the hollowed out body of a seal.

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:44.420
 Yeah, so you stuff them in there for seven or eight months and they're completely preserved

00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:45.420
 then you get them out and eat them.

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:48.520
 Apparently they're pretty disgusting but that was them.

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:54.080
 So I do quite like the Wikipedia page which is so it's called Kiviac and at the top of

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:59.040
 the Wikipedia page it says not to be confused with Kiviac person.

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:02.920
 So sometimes I think Wikipedia goes overboard with their clarifications then.

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:08.280
 I don't think anyone's looks up there make Kiviac and you never told me you were a food

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:11.280
 stuff that gets preserved in a seal skin for eight months.

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:15.440
 Isn't there a thing with camels whereby if you have poisonous water you get the camel

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:20.840
 to drink it and then it vomits it back up and that makes it drinkable.

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:22.840
 Have you ever heard about this?

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:23.840
 I have not heard that.

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:24.840
 Why didn't you look it up?

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:27.000
 Drinkable because a camel has thrown off in it.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.000
 Why?

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.000
 Because it filters it.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.600
 There's something about it's poisonous food or it's water or it'sâ

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:39.720
 But as website I'm getting is six dangerous urban survival myths about water.

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:45.320
 Actually, I'm reading this page now and it doesn't mention Dan's insane camel

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:46.320
 theory.

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:47.520
 Wow, this is really interesting.

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:51.600
 You shouldn't necessarily cut open those big barrel cacti.

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:53.400
 The odds are that the inside will be tough and fibrous.

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:56.880
 The water contained will not be abundant and also there's a greater chance the water inside

00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:00.360
 will be better and acidic which could induce vomiting, diarrhea and cramp.

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:05.720
 Well, at least if you vomits it someone else could drink it.

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:11.480
 Imagine having a magic vomiting camel which purify anything.

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:12.840
 Yeah I think I've got it wrong somewhere.

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:15.320
 I think it's to do with food.

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:19.600
 Google food, camel vomit, survival.

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:26.280
 If anyone knows about this camel weird survival tip then send us a message to @tribalandor.

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:32.160
 I read a thing about how we have been making attempts to create food that last longer.

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:36.400
 So obviously this ham is kind of an anomaly in that it's very old and that's very notable.

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:41.480
 But in the army because they obviously have to have food that's nicely preserved but

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:42.800
 they want people to eat well.

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:46.760
 They've been intempting to make interesting long-lasting foods and sandwiches is one of the big

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:47.760
 things.

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:49.920
 Most soldiers apparently want sandwiches.

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:54.560
 They've currently made a sandwich which can last for two years and not go stale or soggy.

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:58.680
 And the people who made it are trying to work what they're calling an immortal peanut butter

00:13:58.680 --> 00:13:59.680
 and jelly sandwich.

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:00.680
 That's the dream.

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:01.760
 So we can be at war forever.

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:02.760
 Right.

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:04.760
 That's what they want.

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:09.720
 One soldier said they're the best two-year-old sandwiches I've ever eaten.

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:12.760
 Did you know that they fill all crisp packets with nitrogen instead of with oxygen?

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:15.600
 So that the crisps don't go off.

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:16.600
 Instead of with air.

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:17.600
 They don't put air in.

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:19.680
 They get rid of all the oxygen in the packets to keep them fresh.

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:20.680
 Yeah.

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:21.680
 Ash was telling me.

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:26.200
 Ash, who is the lead singer of Emperor Yes, who did our theme tune.

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:30.520
 He was saying that when sparkling water is transported overseas, they take the bubbles

00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:31.520
 out.

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:35.960
 And then they put the bubbles back in when they reach their country destination.

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:36.960
 Has no one heard this?

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:37.960
 You can.

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:38.960
 No.

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:39.960
 Okay.

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:40.960
 If anyone listening can help me out.

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:43.960
 The real water is they forgot to put the bubbles back in.

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:46.640
 That's when the bubbles have ended up in a different country.

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:52.880
 I do know that when they made you cut coffee, they sell the caffeine to soft drinks companies

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:53.880
 to put into soft drinks.

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:54.880
 Isn't that amazing?

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:55.880
 Yeah.

00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:57.680
 I would love to know what caffeine looks like.

00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:58.680
 Isn't it funny?

00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:03.520
 How you said that, and I just accepted it, and when Dan said it, I just immediately thought

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:04.520
 it was rubbish.

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:06.320
 It's the boy who cried both.

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:12.120
 Okay.

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:17.560
 It's time to move on to fact number three, and that is Chazinski.

00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:22.800
 Yes, my fact is that orangutans like playing on iPads, but gorillas do not.

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:23.800
 Really?

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:24.800
 Yeah.

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:30.000
 So, this actually started as an April Fools joke by the Sun, and the heading of their article

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.720
 was Planet of the Apps, saying how gorillas love playing Angry Birds.

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:34.720
 That would be good.

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:38.280
 And yeah, good old Sun, always wants to have a head with the wit.

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:42.080
 And it gave the idea, and some guy who worked at Milwaukee County Zoo read this article and

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:47.440
 thought, "Hey, actually, Apps rapes, good idea," and started showing gorillas iPads.

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:52.520
 But they didn't like it because so gorillas are feel threatened by direct eye contact and

00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:53.520
 face-to-face contact.

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:57.120
 So they do a lot of their interacting sight in a side-long way, and so that doesn't work

00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:59.560
 very well with iPads because you can already see it properly, and then as soon as you look

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:03.560
 at it, you feel like the birds trying to attack you, and they smash it.

00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:04.560
 Wow.

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:07.280
 Here's the thing about gorillas and eye contact.

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:11.520
 There was a zoo that gave out these glasses, do you remember that?

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:15.880
 And they were glasses with pinholes in, so you could still see them, but they had pictures

00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:18.520
 of eyes looking in different directions.

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:22.200
 And the idea was, you would look at the gorillas, but the gorillas wouldn't know that you were

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:23.200
 looking at them.

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:27.080
 Yeah, I think it's Rotterdam Zoo, isn't it, and I think I've been after a woman got attacked

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:28.080
 by a gorilla.

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:32.320
 The only downside, it seems, is that they play on these iPads about half an hour.

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:37.120
 But if you give it to them to hold, they have smashed quite a few in the past.

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:41.560
 So the zookeeper or the staff have to hold the iPad while the orangutans play on it.

00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:42.560
 That's right, I think the-

00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:43.560
 She's a bit of a hassle.

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:48.600
 I think I read the average length of an unsmashed iPad left alone with an orangutan

00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:51.600
 is 15 seconds.

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:52.600
 That's the limit.

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:58.040
 Wow, which is actually the battery life as well.

00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:00.280
 I really, really like orangutans.

00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:01.800
 I think they're brilliant.

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:03.520
 They're solitary, apparently.

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:08.280
 So they spend all of their time, they know their neighbours by sight, but avoid all contact

00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:09.280
 with them.

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:12.280
 So in that sense, not unlike Londoners.

00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:15.520
 But they also make a lot of noise to advertise their whereabouts so that they can avoid each

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:16.520
 other.

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:19.160
 It's something rather beautiful and tragic about that, isn't it?

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:22.000
 Just everyone going around saying, "Here I am, don't come near me."

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.000
 I can't.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.000
 They're British.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.000
 They're British.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.000
 Yeah.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.520
 They've come up with the idea of showing arangs in other zoos.

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:30.520
 Arangs?

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:34.240
 They don't like that, Andy.

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:35.240
 Yeah.

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:40.600
 They've come up with the idea of showing orangutans in other zoos pictures of orangutans they

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:43.920
 might like to have sex with, they might like to mate with, so that they can do breeding

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:48.600
 programmes rather than going to the hassle of transporting an orangutan across the country

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:51.240
 and then to find out they actually, they don't fancy each other.

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:53.160
 But can they fancy each other through a screen, no wonder?

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:54.160
 Yeah, basically.

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:55.160
 It's like Tinder.

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:56.160
 I don't know.

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:57.160
 Yeah.

00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:58.160
 Isn't that weird?

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:02.480
 Is that the younger ones take to the iPads much better than the older ones, the older ones

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:05.400
 are much more set in their ways, saying the same thing?

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:08.640
 An orangutan was the villain in the first ever detective story.

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:11.560
 Oh, what supposed to be the first thing to think about?

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:12.880
 The murder in the remog.

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:15.240
 Spoiler alert, the murderer isn't orangutan.

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:16.240
 Oh, I'm inspired.

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:21.040
 You can't say spoiler alert afterwards, can you?

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:26.800
 And by the way, it was Hamlet's Step Dad, spoiler alert.

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:35.280
 Um, Ash told me, uh, that, gone, gone, I'm apparently dolphins.

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:40.440
 When they, when they start communicating, the words that they'll use to communicate, the

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:46.000
 first word will be their name and then the second word will be the action they're doing.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.760
 So I'd be like, Dan, drinking and they all, they can pick their name as well.

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:51.480
 That does sound more familiar to me.

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:54.480
 I think I have heard that that dolphins use their names.

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:58.160
 That's how you know when someone's about to speak on university challenge.

00:18:58.160 --> 00:18:59.160
 It's a dolphin.

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:00.160
 It's a dolphin.

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:01.160
 It's going to be good on.

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:02.160
 Yeah.

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:03.160
 Thompson Edinburgh.

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:04.160
 Yeah.

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:05.160
 Flipper, UCL.

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:06.160
 [laughter]

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:07.160
 Yeah.

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:08.160
 Yeah.

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:12.000
 Quite useful for people who forget people's names, though.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.320
 Wouldn't that be a great social habit if everyone had to say their own name before they started

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:17.320
 speaking?

00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:18.320
 Yeah.

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:19.320
 My life would be a lot easier.

00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:20.320
 It's so much better, yeah.

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:23.600
 Um, under European regulations, pigs have to be mentally stimulated because I think

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:26.400
 pigs are quite intelligent, so they get easily bored.

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:30.520
 Um, so they've developed pig chase, the pig video game.

00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:31.520
 Have you guys seen this?

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:34.680
 And you can play a video game with a pig as a person.

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:39.120
 And they have this huge screen in their style and there's like a glowing light on it and

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:42.120
 you control the light and the pig snuffles up and follows the light.

00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:45.840
 And the aim is to get your finger on the eye pad to make contact with the pig snout on

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:49.880
 the light and then you guide it towards goal and then your score and there's a big display

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:50.880
 of fireworks.

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:51.880
 They're very good at it, apparently.

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:52.880
 That's great.

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:53.880
 I think it's a pig at a computer game.

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:54.880
 I've said that.

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:55.880
 I have a chance of winning.

00:19:55.880 --> 00:20:01.640
 You used to be able to play chickens at knots and crosses in America, um, they had these

00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:02.640
 machines.

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:04.120
 There was definitely one in Coney Island.

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:06.800
 I'm not sure whether the others were, but there were a few and it was impossible to beat

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:11.720
 them because it's impossible to lose at knots and crosses if you play the right move.

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:15.480
 They were trained to always go in the right place and so you would play these chickens at

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:17.840
 knots and crosses and you could never beat them.

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:18.840
 Wow.

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:22.240
 So if you can't beat a chicken at knots and crosses Andy, I don't fancy your chances

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:25.740
 playing a pig at Call of Duty.

00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:34.560
 Okay, now it's time for a final fact of the show and that is Andy Hunter Murray.

00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:41.280
 Okay, my fact is that the 1888 encyclopedia Britannica entry for Wales reads "See England."

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:46.040
 Does it mean a place where you can see England?

00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:47.040
 Maybe.

00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:54.200
 I think it's, so I just thought this would be time to rectify this, you know, historical

00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:57.360
 imbalance and poor treatment by Britannica.

00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:01.680
 But James, actually, you found something that makes this more complicated or that it's

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:05.480
 not just an example of England being totally, you know, anti-Well show.

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:12.920
 I've seen the assertion on a few websites and I found the text of the actual Britannica and

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:17.360
 it seems like the thing which is entitled England is actually about England and Wales, it's

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:18.880
 about South Britain.

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:23.620
 In the article for England, it says "legal phrasology is not quite consistent on this head,

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:28.560
 but the more accurate description of South Britain is England and Wales rather than England

00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:29.560
 only."

00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:34.000
 And in the article, they mention England and Wales as the whole thing rather than just England.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.000
 I see.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.000
 That's good.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.000
 You know?

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.000
 Yeah.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.000
 So I thought Wales, time for Wales.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.000
 I like Wales.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.320
 It's the largest underground trampoline.

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:45.520
 It's about to launch, yeah.

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:47.320
 Yeah, I think it's open now, I think.

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:48.320
 Yeah, about two weeks ago.

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:49.320
 No, sorry.

00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:50.320
 What?

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:51.320
 Oh my God.

00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:52.840
 It's larger than St Paul's Cathedral.

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:56.920
 And it's a place that's already famous because it has the world's longest zip buyer.

00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:57.920
 Oh wow.

00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:02.960
 We'll put photos of the underground trampoline out here because this is unbelievable.

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:08.280
 James, you've got a mug here which has a Welsh word on it.

00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:16.320
 Yeah, the Welsh train place, which is the longest single word train place in the UK on

00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:17.320
 Anglesy.

00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:18.880
 Yeah, can you say the word?

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:19.880
 I can try.

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:20.880
 Go for it.

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:25.720
 It might not be spot on, but it's something like Slamfea, Pugwinga, Kugera, Quiru and

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:27.760
 Robble, Anticilio, Gorgogoch.

00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:32.480
 Now, if you've spotted any mistakes in that, right in two James's personal mobile phone

00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:35.000
 number, which I'll read out now.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.240
 But the thing about that is that that was a manufactured name.

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:46.880
 Yeah, it's called Slamfea PG, Slamfea, Pugwinga, and they added all the extra bits, I think,

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:48.040
 as a publicity stunt.

00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:49.040
 They wanted a record.

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:50.040
 Oh, really?

00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:53.400
 Yeah, it was a very early publicity stunt where they tried to turn themselves into a notable

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:55.120
 town and it worked.

00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:57.320
 There is a place that's already done that.

00:22:57.320 --> 00:23:01.840
 There's a place called, oh God, what's it called?

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:06.720
 Britain, Ohio, which has an exclamation mark after Hamilton.

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:07.720
 But they changed it.

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:11.120
 They just voted on it in the '70s, just to put the exclamation mark in, yeah.

00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:12.920
 They hadn't just turned themselves into a musical.

00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:13.920
 No.

00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:14.920
 It sounds like a musical, doesn't it?

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:15.920
 Yeah.

00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:19.800
 But they wanted more tourists and they wanted more revenue from tourists, so they did that.

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:20.800
 And it worked.

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:21.800
 I think it worked.

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:22.800
 But also, yeah.

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:26.120
 That's the fact that they could come up with put an exclamation mark in their name.

00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:27.800
 Well, I mean, it's cost-effective, isn't it?

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:28.800
 Yeah.

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:30.960
 - Flamfer, blah, blah, blah.

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:32.880
 - We definitely get letters for that one.

00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:34.200
 (laughing)

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:35.440
 - Say the short one.

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:36.280
 - Flamfer PG.

00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:39.600
 I went there because I was in North Wales,

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:41.800
 and it was about a 50 mile drive from where I was,

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:43.360
 but I just wanted to go to that place.

00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:44.520
 - Okay. - Okay.

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:45.880
 - And I bought a mug.

00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:47.640
 So there we go. - There we go.

00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:48.680
 - Now if everyone did that,

00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:51.080
 they'd sell 60 million mugs a year.

00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:54.520
 So there was a town in America as well

00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:56.600
 that claimed to be the center of the universe.

00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:59.600
 Danny Wallistered this as a book, 'cause it just

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:01.680
 no one else knew where the center of the universe was.

00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:03.960
 - Yeah, it's a mess had something like,

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:06.520
 I've spoken to a lot of physicists and astrophysicists,

00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:08.000
 and they said that the universe

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.560
 doesn't really have a center.

00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:11.520
 So if nowhere else is claiming to have it,

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:12.880
 then I think we'll have it.

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:15.560
 And he claimed there was like a bench or a manhole cover

00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:16.840
 or something in the middle of the town.

00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:18.480
 He said, right, this is a center of the universe,

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:19.680
 and they put a little plaque up.

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:20.760
 - Amazing. - Good, good, good.

00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:22.720
 - I think that was quite fun.

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:23.720
 Yeah.

00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:26.840
 So, okay, that was pretty bold of Britannica to do that.

00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:28.680
 But you're saying that's a bit of a disputed?

00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:29.680
 - No, it's not disputed.

00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:30.960
 It's, they definitely did do that.

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:33.400
 And Wales obviously deserves its own section

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:36.360
 in that we have a 1911 Britannica in this office,

00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:38.880
 and that has a very large section on Wales.

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:40.720
 So they soon amended it.

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:43.880
 - Yeah, I was wondering if, when you told us this fact,

00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:45.480
 where there may be if you turned to England,

00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:48.080
 it would have an entry that was like C Wales,

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:49.760
 which did use to happen.

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:51.560
 So there's this guy's written this really good book

00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:54.880
 called Reading the OED, it's by Amon Shea,

00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:56.760
 and he read the whole OED recently.

00:24:56.760 --> 00:25:00.680
 It was before it was re-edited in 2007, I think.

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:02.720
 So he read the OED from before that

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:04.320
 and found a bunch of hilarious stuff.

00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:06.960
 One of which was the word un-poetic

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:09.640
 for which the entry just said C.F. below.

00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:13.040
 And the word below was un-poetical and it said C.F. above.

00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:14.240
 So that was quite a good one.

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:15.600
 - Oh, lovely.

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:17.120
 - There are other excellent ones.

00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:20.080
 So there's one that's created for the word

00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:25.080
 Disgibeline, which is D-I-S-G-H-I-B-E-L-L-I-N-E,

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:28.360
 and the definition is to distinguish

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:30.680
 as a gwealth from a gibeline.

00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:32.160
 (laughing)

00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:33.960
 - Well, someone was really proud of himself

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:34.800
 of coming up with that.

00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:36.160
 - Sounds like Leah, doesn't it, that.

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:39.280
 - Yeah. - It sounds like a milk gwealth.

00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:42.200
 - A gray whale, I'd like to be a friend.

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:43.440
 - A bit friend. - A bit friend, yeah.

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:44.280
 - Friend.

00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:47.680
 In the first edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica,

00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:52.480
 which is even more basic and rude than the 1888 one.

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:54.360
 Rude is in simple, not as in rude.

00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:56.360
 But the entry for woman just says,

00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:59.000
 the female of man, C.Homo.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.840
 And the entry on tobacco says that excessive use

00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:05.640
 is capable of quotes drying up the brain

00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:08.760
 to a little black lump consisting of mere membranes.

00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:09.600
 (laughing)

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:11.600
 - They should put that on cigarette packets, shouldn't they?

00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:13.320
 - Yeah. (laughing)

00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:15.800
 - There was a book, you know in the OED,

00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:18.640
 how you have sauces for each of the things.

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:21.640
 So it'll have, what was that word you just said?

00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:22.840
 - Discubiline. - Discubiline.

00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:24.080
 It would have discubiline,

00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:27.200
 and then it would have the sauce for where they found it,

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:28.480
 which book they found it in.

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:30.760
 There are 51 words in the OED,

00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:33.320
 which have the sauce, "Meandering's of Memory"

00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:34.960
 by someone called Nightlark.

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:37.400
 And no one knows what that book is.

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:39.200
 - Oh. - Did they know who Nightlark is?

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:40.760
 - No. - That's great.

00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:45.760
 - Just very quickly on this idea of the mysterious book,

00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:50.480
 yeah, I read this story when I was looking into stuff

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:53.440
 about posting yourself across the country.

00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:56.760
 In 1976, so starting in 1976,

00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:59.840
 residents in a small town called Circleville in Ohio,

00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:04.520
 population 13,000, they all started receiving

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:08.160
 these letters, accusing them of various misdeeds,

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:09.960
 and the letters were just anonymous.

00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:12.760
 No one knew, but everyone in the town was getting them.

00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:14.440
 - Wow. - And they had theories

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:15.960
 to who was sending them.

00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:20.000
 There was a theory that it was a writer called Ron Giuseppe,

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.480
 who was writing them, but then he mysteriously died.

00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:27.000
 But the letters continued coming to them until the 1990s,

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:27.960
 and then they just stopped.

00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:30.160
 - It's a bit like, I know what you did last summer.

00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:31.640
 - Yeah. - And I know what you did last summer,

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:33.680
 and I know what you did last summer.

00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:34.880
 - I don't know what they did last summer.

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:36.080
 I've never seen it.

00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:38.280
 - Oh. - They killed someone with a car.

00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:39.120
 - Spoiler alert.

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:41.880
 (all laughing)

00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:44.680
 - So bringing it back to Wales,

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:47.520
 it does at least get the chance to laugh in our faces

00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:50.400
 when we cook up, which we often do where Wales is concerned.

00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:53.440
 So street signs are a quite a famous example, aren't they?

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:57.120
 There was that sign that went up in Wales a couple of years ago.

00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:58.760
 So there was the English above,

00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:00.560
 which said something like, take the next left

00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:01.840
 if you want to get to X place,

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:04.960
 and then the translation in Welsh below actually translated as,

00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:06.440
 "I am not in the office at the moment,

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:08.280
 send any work to be translated."

00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:10.080
 (all laughing)

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:13.440
 - There's a sign between Cardiff and Penarth that tells cyclists

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:16.440
 that they've got a problem with an inflamed bladder.

00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:18.040
 That's what the translation is.

00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:21.560
 And there's a sign for pedestrians in Cardiff

00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:23.640
 that reads, "Look right in English."

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:26.360
 And the Welsh translation below is, "Look left."

00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:28.600
 (all laughing)

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:30.480
 - Okay, that's it.

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:31.320
 That's the end of our show.

00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:32.320
 Those are all of our facts.

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:33.480
 Thanks everyone for listening.

00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:36.240
 If you want to get in contact and talk more about the stuff

00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:37.960
 that we've been mentioning on this podcast,

00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:41.200
 you can get Andy on @AndrewHunterM, James.

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:42.480
 - @egshaped.

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:43.320
 - Anna.

00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:45.960
 - You can email podcast@QI.com.

00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:48.320
 - And if you want to get through to me to save me

00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:51.160
 from being fired for all of my missbacks,

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:53.960
 and want to help me out on the idea that maybe camels

00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:56.280
 do vomit up stuff that we can then re-eat,

00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:59.120
 that bubbles are taken out of sparkling water

00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:01.280
 and reintroduced into the bottle

00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:03.040
 on the other side of the journey.

00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:06.160
 I can be gone on @Shryberland.

00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:08.480
 You can also go to qi.com/podcast

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:10.200
 where we're gonna have all of the facts

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:12.080
 that we've been talking about as well as links

00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:15.600
 to further research, to extra videos and pictures

00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:17.680
 of that giant trampoline and so on.

00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:20.440
 And we've also got all the other episodes that we've done.

00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:22.400
 And you can explore those pages as well.

00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:23.760
 We'll be back again next week.

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:24.600
 Goodbye.

00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:27.840
 (upbeat music)

00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:30.960
 - Just to add a post podcast addendum to that,

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:33.800
 Dan and Andy are currently absent from the QI offices,

00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:36.360
 both performing shows in Edinburgh.

00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:38.040
 They've got two shows each,

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:42.280
 so Andy's got ostentatious and fully adur,

00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:44.360
 so obviously go to both of those multiple times

00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:46.920
 if you're listening, and Dan will be performing

00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:49.920
 his stand-up cock-blocked from outer space,

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:52.720
 and he's also gonna be in the Museum of Curiosity,

00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:54.280
 which is doing live shows at Edinburgh.

00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:56.040
 So anyone who's anywhere near there

00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:59.400
 should definitely go to see them, apparently there.

00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:01.040
 Apparently they're quite funny.

00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:04.880
 And if you'd like to buy any ham, please go to

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:08.200
 Mr. Fellas' Humshop in Oxford.

00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:09.680
 Do.

00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:11.680
 Best time in the country and the oldest.

00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:14.280
 (upbeat music)

00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:16.920
 âª You follow me âª

00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:19.420
 âª I follow you âª

00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:22.000
 (upbeat music)

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.580
 (upbeat music)
