1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,680
 We run it on QI a few years ago.

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:02,160
 Yeah.

3
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,360
 And which was, there's no such thing as a fish.

4
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:05,680
 It's kind of a nice such thing as a fish.

5
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,960
 No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life.

6
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,600
 It says it right there, first paragraph, no such thing as a fish.

7
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:25,200
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,

8
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,680
 a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

9
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:29,680
 My name is Dan Triber.

10
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:33,240
 I'm sitting here with the regular three elves, Andy Murray, Anna Chazinski,

11
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,280
 and James Harkin.

12
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,480
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

13
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,320
 to share our favorite facts from the last seven days.

14
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,760
 So again, let's do it.

15
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,720
 Our favorite facts, James.

16
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:48,480
 My fact is that in 1903, a man called W. Reginald Bray

17
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,880
 posted himself.

18
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,880
 Wow.

19
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:52,640
 How?

20
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,640
 How?

21
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,720
 He stuck a stamp on himself and walked down to the post office

22
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:01,120
 and said, I want to be taken to a house, which happens to be his own house.

23
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,240
 And they took him.

24
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,240
 Yeah.

25
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,920
 Was it a slow day for him?

26
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:05,920
 Finished his book?

27
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,960
 I didn't know what to do.

28
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:12,680
 He was a bit of a wager, a bit of a practical joker.

29
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:16,800
 And one of the things he did was he read through all of the post office

30
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:21,040
 guide and worked out what the smallest and largest things he could post were.

31
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,800
 So he discovered that the smallest item that he could post was 1b.

32
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,600
 And so he posted that.

33
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,000
 And the largest was an elephant, but he couldn't find an elephant.

34
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,600
 So he posted himself.

35
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,600
 What year was this?

36
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,600
 1903.

37
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,600
 1903.

38
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:39,320
 It sounds like, because there's so many examples of people just testing the limits of the

39
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,320
 posting system.

40
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,320
 Yeah.

41
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,960
 Like just a bunch of practical jokers going, how far can we push this?

42
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:49,120
 There was a guy who sent an entire building's worth of bricks, because he was building a

43
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:54,760
 bank in a different city and the cheapest way was just to send the bricks via the post.

44
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,760
 Oh my god.

45
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,760
 Were they individually wrapped?

46
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,760
 No, I think that's what I hoped they were.

47
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:02,760
 That would be a brilliant admin job for someone that's sticking the stamps on and putting them in.

48
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,760
 Yeah, Alex would love that.

49
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,600
 He sent them at 40 at a time.

50
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,600
 They must have not introduced weight limits then.

51
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,320
 That must have been when they did it by size.

52
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,320
 That's where they brought it.

53
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,320
 That's where they introduced the scales.

54
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:16,760
 That's when they brought it in, Â£200 per day, the limit that they then imposed.

55
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,000
 There's a weird history of people posting themselves.

56
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 It's not just this guy.

57
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,400
 There's been a few cents.

58
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,000
 A guy called Mr. Seng.

59
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,680
 I'm not sure where he was from.

60
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:30,040
 He decided to post himself in a sealed box and he thought it would just be a 30-minute

61
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:36,980
 journey, but they put him in the wrong pile and he was stuck in there for three hours and

62
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:40,680
 he didn't make a hole in his box so he could hardly breathe and when they cut him out, he'd

63
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:46,080
 passed out and when they interviewed him in the newspaper afterwards, he said, "I tried

64
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,840
 to make a hole in the cardboard, but it was too thick and I didn't want to spoil the surprise

65
00:02:50,840 --> 00:03:00,440
 by shouting, 'Wow!' That was a real dedication to a surprise.

66
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:05,620
 But then he couldn't really jump out and say surprise because he passed out.

67
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:10,440
 And was it a good surprise or was it like he was a burglar and he was going to jump out

68
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,760
 and then round sack of house?

69
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:18,320
 Well there was a guy who posted himself, what was it now, okay so there was a guy who decided

70
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:22,880
 he wanted to cross America and he was called Mr. McKinley, I don't know what his first

71
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,880
 name was.

72
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:29,240
 And he decided to be better to go in a box because he could charge the postage to his company

73
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,120
 rather than paying for the ticket which you have to pay for himself.

74
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,200
 That's how I get to work every day, it's the same thing here.

75
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,200
 Sorry going.

76
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:41,080
 Yeah, you're always arriving by second post, don't you?

77
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,080
 Oh snap.

78
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,080
 Oh snap.

79
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:49,800
 I won't mind but I'm very far the latest of it. So he built the $550 freight charge to

80
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,960
 his employer and climbed into the crate.

81
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:56,200
 Of course by being in a plane he was lucky, he was in a plane which was like air conditioning

82
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,880
 and stuff but a lot of them, it's very dangerous because they're you know it's very cold

83
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,480
 for you to die in that.

84
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:05,600
 Do you know you used to be able to send children by post, right?

85
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,600
 Yeah.

86
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,800
 You used to be able to post children around the place.

87
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,120
 Until 1920 was it in the US anyway?

88
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,120
 Yeah.

89
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,120
 It was banned officially.

90
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,120
 And until around then.

91
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:19,560
 But you would buy the stamps and you would put the stamps on the child's jacket and then

92
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:24,560
 the child would sit in for example the mail van of the train and they were a bit of post.

93
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,280
 And you could I think you could lump all your posts together because there are pictures

94
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:33,680
 of children with posts strapped to them and then they turn up and be like not only an icon.

95
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,840
 Just going back to W Reginald Bray.

96
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,840
 Oh yeah.

97
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,680
 He has his own website which I didn't know.

98
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,680
 He's amazing.

99
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,000
 Yeah but the website is absolutely fantastic.

100
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,840
 He collected a lot of autographs so he sent thousands of cards out to people asking them

101
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:53,240
 to be returned autographed to the Pope or his local railway station master and on the website

102
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:58,320
 it has this lovely line which is over the years Reginald amassed over 15,000 autographs declaring

103
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,000
 himself the autograph king, a title that was undisputed by his peers.

104
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:12,200
 Imagine you were like his pretender.

105
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,720
 I think you wouldn't tell him that you had all these autographs and then you go up to him

106
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,440
 and go excuse me you the guy who's got the most autographs in the world.

107
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,280
 Which you mind just signing that and then when he signed it you have a beat.

108
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,040
 Yeah you have one over him.

109
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,040
 Oh that's good.

110
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,040
 That's very cool.

111
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,040
 Yeah.

112
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:56,280
 So I think you're not allowed to transport helium in any way because it's explosive isn't

113
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,280
 it?

114
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,280
 Yeah.

115
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,040
 They were wrapping helium in a balloon.

116
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,040
 In a rubber.

117
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,040
 That's true.

118
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,040
 Yeah.

119
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:07,080
 So one of the most common questions that gets us to the US postal system is can you mail

120
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,280
 a dog?

121
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,240
 They get this question all the time, says spokesperson Sue Brennan.

122
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,720
 The answer is no.

123
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,880
 Can't mail a dog.

124
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,880
 No.

125
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,320
 The whole point of postman and dogs is that they don't get along.

126
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:23,600
 Can you imagine a dog in a sorting office?

127
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,960
 It's actually they've worked out how many for some reason they've only done this in Germany

128
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:32,800
 but three thousand postman a year a bit and buy dogs in Germany and two thousand two

129
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,600
 hundred and fifty five pairs of trousers are torn resulting in eight million pounds worth

130
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,600
 of medical bills.

131
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:44,000
 In 2001 the German post office started teaching dog psychology to postman.

132
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,440
 It's just it's just a permanent ongoing war.

133
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,440
 Postman.

134
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,440
 Yeah.

135
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,440
 Dog battle.

136
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,320
 Because the postman are not allowed to carry weapons.

137
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,320
 And dogs are?

138
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,320
 They are weapons.

139
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,160
 Oh, that's that's not a mate.

140
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:02,760
 That's like saying that was it Joe Lewis who had his his fists designated a weapon.

141
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,760
 Jackie Chan.

142
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,440
 I've always heard about this and I've never believed it.

143
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,440
 Is it true?

144
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,920
 I think I think when you say you've always heard it, I think it's me literally repeating

145
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,920
 it.

146
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,920
 Yeah.

147
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,920
 Most days.

148
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:17,440
 Jackie Chan told Wuppie Goldberg and a number of others on the view that when he's in

149
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:23,720
 America, he is considered his fists to be an illegal weapon.

150
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,760
 Do you get all of your facts from the view?

151
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:30,240
 Actually, no, I don't because they're a bit I remember watching an episode where they were

152
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,120
 talking about the possibility that the moon landings didn't happen that it was a hoax

153
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:38,400
 and Wuppie Goldberg was going, I don't want to like speculate about the truth about it,

154
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,960
 but all I'm saying is, you know, who was filming Neil when he went down on the ladder?

155
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,200
 Who was holding that camera?

156
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,200
 I don't want to speculate.

157
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:51,120
 It's like, Wuppie, you know, Wuppie Goldberg got her nickname due to her childhood flatulence.

158
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,120
 Oh, yeah.

159
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,120
 She was a big fighter.

160
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,120
 Yeah.

161
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,120
 She, Wuppie.

162
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,120
 Yeah, that's right.

163
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,120
 That's good.

164
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,120
 Yeah.

165
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,120
 And she worked in a morgue, didn't she?

166
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,120
 Yeah, she.

167
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,120
 I might mention it.

168
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,600
 But putting makeup on corpses and then everyone, when she works in everyone's like, what's

169
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,600
 that smell?

170
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,600
 Yeah.

171
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,400
 It's not like people just woke up and walks out.

172
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,400
 Oh god.

173
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,400
 Who was it?

174
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,400
 Did someone send a load of wasps?

175
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,400
 Yes.

176
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:16,760
 You can make wasps go to sleep and they were sent on a flight and the flight was delayed

177
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,320
 or something and they all woke up.

178
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:24,800
 You can still buy parasitic wasps through the post and therefore, like pest control instead

179
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,520
 of using pesticides, you can use them.

180
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,640
 And then what do you get mail to you to get rid of the parasitic wasps in the infestation

181
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,960
 that you've now got?

182
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,160
 Then you get a spider to catch the fly.

183
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,160
 Fly, yeah.

184
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:39,440
 There was always a big flaw in that song because cows don't eat dogs.

185
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:48,360
 Okay, time for fact number two and that is my fact.

186
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:54,920
 My fact this week is that the oldest edible ham has just celebrated its 112th birthday.

187
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,280
 So how do we know it's edible?

188
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:59,320
 Oh, because it's quite a famous ham.

189
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:04,160
 It first came to prominence when it celebrated its 100th birthday and someone has since

190
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,400
 bought it and I guess anytime it has a birthday now, people mention it.

191
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:12,760
 So I wanted to dispute this claim because my local butcher, Mr. Feller, best butcher in

192
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,760
 the world.

193
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,760
 You guys should all go to him.

194
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,400
 And we sponsored by Mr. Feller now.

195
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:22,040
 I have been past Mr. Feller's place in the cover market and I can confirm there is a very

196
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,040
 old ham in the winter.

197
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:29,480
 Yeah, so he claims I think he bought it in 1993 when it was 101.

198
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:33,800
 It cost him 990 pounds but he said he would have paid at least five grand for it because

199
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,800
 it was so special.

200
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:42,360
 It is now 125 he says and he says that when he bought it from the auctioneer that was selling

201
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,440
 off, they said they weren't sure it was edible, but he's the butcher.

202
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,440
 He should know.

203
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,440
 Why is he not in the news?

204
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,440
 Why is he not?

205
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,440
 It hasn't been proven.

206
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,440
 Hasn't officially verified.

207
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,440
 Is this like the autograph guy?

208
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,440
 Like no one else can be bothered.

209
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,640
 They're like, yeah, we have way older ham dude but like we don't need the title of world

210
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,640
 oldest ham.

211
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,640
 I think he's above that.

212
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,640
 Yeah.

213
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,640
 Wow.

214
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:07,160
 But to the world's tallest man who I think was certified the world's tallest man and then

215
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:12,480
 he refused to do the tests anymore so they stripped him of his title and I think there

216
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,920
 is another man who is now officially the world's tallest man but actually is slightly shorter

217
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,920
 than the previous man.

218
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,960
 Why did he refuse to be remeasured?

219
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:24,320
 He doesn't want the hassle of being the world's tallest man because when you're the world's

220
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,280
 tallest man, people come to see you as if you're an attraction.

221
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:33,800
 I remember reading this odd fact about the idea that there are no children in the town

222
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:38,800
 not because he's scared them away but just because there's too much hassle to have a super

223
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,840
 tall guy and kids in the same town.

224
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,240
 I can't remember the exact fact but it was...

225
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:50,040
 It's Operation Here's the Size of a Utrecht.

226
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,580
 Old things that have been eaten.

227
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:56,760
 A German pensioner who received a tin of American lard 64 years ago in an aid package has

228
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:00,180
 only just tasted it after discovering that it is still edible.

229
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,180
 Oh wow.

230
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:04,180
 I just didn't want to throw it away, said Hans Feldmeyer 87.

231
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:10,320
 So that's the spirit which makes people keep ham for decades when it's just the not very

232
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,320
 nice ham.

233
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,320
 Yeah.

234
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:17,000
 In 2005 we found a 4,000 year old bowl of noodles in China which I quite like that they're

235
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,720
 still in the bowl and that settled the debate because there's quite a heated debate I think

236
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:27,600
 between Chinese Arabs and Italians over who first came up with the noodle and that's the

237
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,000
 oldest evidence of a noodle.

238
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,320
 So China's got it at the moment.

239
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:38,200
 Speaking of well preserved food there's obviously the Kiviac, the Inuit food which is made

240
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,520
 from orcs that are preserved in the hollowed out body of a seal.

241
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,420
 Yeah, so you stuff them in there for seven or eight months and they're completely preserved

242
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,420
 then you get them out and eat them.

243
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:48,520
 Apparently they're pretty disgusting but that was them.

244
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:54,080
 So I do quite like the Wikipedia page which is so it's called Kiviac and at the top of

245
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:59,040
 the Wikipedia page it says not to be confused with Kiviac person.

246
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,920
 So sometimes I think Wikipedia goes overboard with their clarifications then.

247
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:08,280
 I don't think anyone's looks up there make Kiviac and you never told me you were a food

248
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:11,280
 stuff that gets preserved in a seal skin for eight months.

249
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:15,440
 Isn't there a thing with camels whereby if you have poisonous water you get the camel

250
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,840
 to drink it and then it vomits it back up and that makes it drinkable.

251
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,840
 Have you ever heard about this?

252
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,840
 I have not heard that.

253
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,840
 Why didn't you look it up?

254
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,000
 Drinkable because a camel has thrown off in it.

255
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 Why?

256
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 Because it filters it.

257
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,600
 There's something about it's poisonous food or it's water or it'sâ

258
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:39,720
 But as website I'm getting is six dangerous urban survival myths about water.

259
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:45,320
 Actually, I'm reading this page now and it doesn't mention Dan's insane camel

260
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,320
 theory.

261
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,520
 Wow, this is really interesting.

262
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:51,600
 You shouldn't necessarily cut open those big barrel cacti.

263
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,400
 The odds are that the inside will be tough and fibrous.

264
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,880
 The water contained will not be abundant and also there's a greater chance the water inside

265
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,360
 will be better and acidic which could induce vomiting, diarrhea and cramp.

266
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:05,720
 Well, at least if you vomits it someone else could drink it.

267
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:11,480
 Imagine having a magic vomiting camel which purify anything.

268
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,840
 Yeah I think I've got it wrong somewhere.

269
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,320
 I think it's to do with food.

270
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:19,600
 Google food, camel vomit, survival.

271
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:26,280
 If anyone knows about this camel weird survival tip then send us a message to @tribalandor.

272
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:32,160
 I read a thing about how we have been making attempts to create food that last longer.

273
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,400
 So obviously this ham is kind of an anomaly in that it's very old and that's very notable.

274
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:41,480
 But in the army because they obviously have to have food that's nicely preserved but

275
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,800
 they want people to eat well.

276
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,760
 They've been intempting to make interesting long-lasting foods and sandwiches is one of the big

277
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,760
 things.

278
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,920
 Most soldiers apparently want sandwiches.

279
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,560
 They've currently made a sandwich which can last for two years and not go stale or soggy.

280
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,680
 And the people who made it are trying to work what they're calling an immortal peanut butter

281
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,680
 and jelly sandwich.

282
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,680
 That's the dream.

283
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,760
 So we can be at war forever.

284
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,760
 Right.

285
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,760
 That's what they want.

286
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:09,720
 One soldier said they're the best two-year-old sandwiches I've ever eaten.

287
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,760
 Did you know that they fill all crisp packets with nitrogen instead of with oxygen?

288
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,600
 So that the crisps don't go off.

289
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,600
 Instead of with air.

290
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,600
 They don't put air in.

291
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,680
 They get rid of all the oxygen in the packets to keep them fresh.

292
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,680
 Yeah.

293
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,680
 Ash was telling me.

294
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:26,200
 Ash, who is the lead singer of Emperor Yes, who did our theme tune.

295
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:30,520
 He was saying that when sparkling water is transported overseas, they take the bubbles

296
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,520
 out.

297
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:35,960
 And then they put the bubbles back in when they reach their country destination.

298
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,960
 Has no one heard this?

299
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,960
 You can.

300
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,960
 No.

301
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,960
 Okay.

302
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,960
 If anyone listening can help me out.

303
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,960
 The real water is they forgot to put the bubbles back in.

304
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,640
 That's when the bubbles have ended up in a different country.

305
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:52,880
 I do know that when they made you cut coffee, they sell the caffeine to soft drinks companies

306
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,880
 to put into soft drinks.

307
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,880
 Isn't that amazing?

308
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,880
 Yeah.

309
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,680
 I would love to know what caffeine looks like.

310
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,680
 Isn't it funny?

311
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:03,520
 How you said that, and I just accepted it, and when Dan said it, I just immediately thought

312
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,520
 it was rubbish.

313
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,320
 It's the boy who cried both.

314
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:12,120
 Okay.

315
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:17,560
 It's time to move on to fact number three, and that is Chazinski.

316
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:22,800
 Yes, my fact is that orangutans like playing on iPads, but gorillas do not.

317
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,800
 Really?

318
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,800
 Yeah.

319
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:30,000
 So, this actually started as an April Fools joke by the Sun, and the heading of their article

320
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,720
 was Planet of the Apps, saying how gorillas love playing Angry Birds.

321
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,720
 That would be good.

322
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,280
 And yeah, good old Sun, always wants to have a head with the wit.

323
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:42,080
 And it gave the idea, and some guy who worked at Milwaukee County Zoo read this article and

324
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:47,440
 thought, "Hey, actually, Apps rapes, good idea," and started showing gorillas iPads.

325
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:52,520
 But they didn't like it because so gorillas are feel threatened by direct eye contact and

326
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,520
 face-to-face contact.

327
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:57,120
 So they do a lot of their interacting sight in a side-long way, and so that doesn't work

328
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,560
 very well with iPads because you can already see it properly, and then as soon as you look

329
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:03,560
 at it, you feel like the birds trying to attack you, and they smash it.

330
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,560
 Wow.

331
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,280
 Here's the thing about gorillas and eye contact.

332
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:11,520
 There was a zoo that gave out these glasses, do you remember that?

333
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:15,880
 And they were glasses with pinholes in, so you could still see them, but they had pictures

334
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,520
 of eyes looking in different directions.

335
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:22,200
 And the idea was, you would look at the gorillas, but the gorillas wouldn't know that you were

336
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,200
 looking at them.

337
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:27,080
 Yeah, I think it's Rotterdam Zoo, isn't it, and I think I've been after a woman got attacked

338
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,080
 by a gorilla.

339
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:32,320
 The only downside, it seems, is that they play on these iPads about half an hour.

340
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:37,120
 But if you give it to them to hold, they have smashed quite a few in the past.

341
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,560
 So the zookeeper or the staff have to hold the iPad while the orangutans play on it.

342
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,560
 That's right, I think the-

343
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,560
 She's a bit of a hassle.

344
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:48,600
 I think I read the average length of an unsmashed iPad left alone with an orangutan

345
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,600
 is 15 seconds.

346
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,600
 That's the limit.

347
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:58,040
 Wow, which is actually the battery life as well.

348
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,280
 I really, really like orangutans.

349
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,800
 I think they're brilliant.

350
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,520
 They're solitary, apparently.

351
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:08,280
 So they spend all of their time, they know their neighbours by sight, but avoid all contact

352
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,280
 with them.

353
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,280
 So in that sense, not unlike Londoners.

354
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:15,520
 But they also make a lot of noise to advertise their whereabouts so that they can avoid each

355
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,520
 other.

356
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:19,160
 It's something rather beautiful and tragic about that, isn't it?

357
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:22,000
 Just everyone going around saying, "Here I am, don't come near me."

358
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 I can't.

359
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 They're British.

360
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 They're British.

361
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 Yeah.

362
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,520
 They've come up with the idea of showing arangs in other zoos.

363
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,520
 Arangs?

364
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:34,240
 They don't like that, Andy.

365
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,240
 Yeah.

366
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:40,600
 They've come up with the idea of showing orangutans in other zoos pictures of orangutans they

367
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,920
 might like to have sex with, they might like to mate with, so that they can do breeding

368
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:48,600
 programmes rather than going to the hassle of transporting an orangutan across the country

369
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,240
 and then to find out they actually, they don't fancy each other.

370
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,160
 But can they fancy each other through a screen, no wonder?

371
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,160
 Yeah, basically.

372
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,160
 It's like Tinder.

373
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,160
 I don't know.

374
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,160
 Yeah.

375
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,160
 Isn't that weird?

376
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,480
 Is that the younger ones take to the iPads much better than the older ones, the older ones

377
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,400
 are much more set in their ways, saying the same thing?

378
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,640
 An orangutan was the villain in the first ever detective story.

379
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,560
 Oh, what supposed to be the first thing to think about?

380
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,880
 The murder in the remog.

381
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,240
 Spoiler alert, the murderer isn't orangutan.

382
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,240
 Oh, I'm inspired.

383
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:21,040
 You can't say spoiler alert afterwards, can you?

384
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:26,800
 And by the way, it was Hamlet's Step Dad, spoiler alert.

385
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:35,280
 Um, Ash told me, uh, that, gone, gone, I'm apparently dolphins.

386
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:40,440
 When they, when they start communicating, the words that they'll use to communicate, the

387
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:46,000
 first word will be their name and then the second word will be the action they're doing.

388
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,760
 So I'd be like, Dan, drinking and they all, they can pick their name as well.

389
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,480
 That does sound more familiar to me.

390
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,480
 I think I have heard that that dolphins use their names.

391
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,160
 That's how you know when someone's about to speak on university challenge.

392
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,160
 It's a dolphin.

393
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,160
 It's a dolphin.

394
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,160
 It's going to be good on.

395
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,160
 Yeah.

396
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,160
 Thompson Edinburgh.

397
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,160
 Yeah.

398
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,160
 Flipper, UCL.

399
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,160
 [laughter]

400
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,160
 Yeah.

401
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,160
 Yeah.

402
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,000
 Quite useful for people who forget people's names, though.

403
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,320
 Wouldn't that be a great social habit if everyone had to say their own name before they started

404
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,320
 speaking?

405
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,320
 Yeah.

406
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,320
 My life would be a lot easier.

407
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,320
 It's so much better, yeah.

408
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,600
 Um, under European regulations, pigs have to be mentally stimulated because I think

409
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,400
 pigs are quite intelligent, so they get easily bored.

410
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,520
 Um, so they've developed pig chase, the pig video game.

411
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,520
 Have you guys seen this?

412
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,680
 And you can play a video game with a pig as a person.

413
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:39,120
 And they have this huge screen in their style and there's like a glowing light on it and

414
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,120
 you control the light and the pig snuffles up and follows the light.

415
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:45,840
 And the aim is to get your finger on the eye pad to make contact with the pig snout on

416
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,880
 the light and then you guide it towards goal and then your score and there's a big display

417
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,880
 of fireworks.

418
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,880
 They're very good at it, apparently.

419
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,880
 That's great.

420
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,880
 I think it's a pig at a computer game.

421
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,880
 I've said that.

422
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,880
 I have a chance of winning.

423
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:01,640
 You used to be able to play chickens at knots and crosses in America, um, they had these

424
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,640
 machines.

425
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,120
 There was definitely one in Coney Island.

426
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,800
 I'm not sure whether the others were, but there were a few and it was impossible to beat

427
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:11,720
 them because it's impossible to lose at knots and crosses if you play the right move.

428
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:15,480
 They were trained to always go in the right place and so you would play these chickens at

429
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,840
 knots and crosses and you could never beat them.

430
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,840
 Wow.

431
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:22,240
 So if you can't beat a chicken at knots and crosses Andy, I don't fancy your chances

432
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,740
 playing a pig at Call of Duty.

433
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:34,560
 Okay, now it's time for a final fact of the show and that is Andy Hunter Murray.

434
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:41,280
 Okay, my fact is that the 1888 encyclopedia Britannica entry for Wales reads "See England."

435
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:46,040
 Does it mean a place where you can see England?

436
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,040
 Maybe.

437
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:54,200
 I think it's, so I just thought this would be time to rectify this, you know, historical

438
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,360
 imbalance and poor treatment by Britannica.

439
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:01,680
 But James, actually, you found something that makes this more complicated or that it's

440
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:05,480
 not just an example of England being totally, you know, anti-Well show.

441
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:12,920
 I've seen the assertion on a few websites and I found the text of the actual Britannica and

442
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:17,360
 it seems like the thing which is entitled England is actually about England and Wales, it's

443
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,880
 about South Britain.

444
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,620
 In the article for England, it says "legal phrasology is not quite consistent on this head,

445
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:28,560
 but the more accurate description of South Britain is England and Wales rather than England

446
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,560
 only."

447
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:34,000
 And in the article, they mention England and Wales as the whole thing rather than just England.

448
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 I see.

449
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 That's good.

450
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 You know?

451
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 Yeah.

452
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 So I thought Wales, time for Wales.

453
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 I like Wales.

454
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,320
 It's the largest underground trampoline.

455
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,520
 It's about to launch, yeah.

456
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,320
 Yeah, I think it's open now, I think.

457
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,320
 Yeah, about two weeks ago.

458
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,320
 No, sorry.

459
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,320
 What?

460
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,320
 Oh my God.

461
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,840
 It's larger than St Paul's Cathedral.

462
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:56,920
 And it's a place that's already famous because it has the world's longest zip buyer.

463
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,920
 Oh wow.

464
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:02,960
 We'll put photos of the underground trampoline out here because this is unbelievable.

465
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:08,280
 James, you've got a mug here which has a Welsh word on it.

466
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:16,320
 Yeah, the Welsh train place, which is the longest single word train place in the UK on

467
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,320
 Anglesy.

468
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,880
 Yeah, can you say the word?

469
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,880
 I can try.

470
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,880
 Go for it.

471
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:25,720
 It might not be spot on, but it's something like Slamfea, Pugwinga, Kugera, Quiru and

472
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,760
 Robble, Anticilio, Gorgogoch.

473
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:32,480
 Now, if you've spotted any mistakes in that, right in two James's personal mobile phone

474
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,000
 number, which I'll read out now.

475
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,240
 But the thing about that is that that was a manufactured name.

476
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:46,880
 Yeah, it's called Slamfea PG, Slamfea, Pugwinga, and they added all the extra bits, I think,

477
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,040
 as a publicity stunt.

478
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,040
 They wanted a record.

479
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,040
 Oh, really?

480
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:53,400
 Yeah, it was a very early publicity stunt where they tried to turn themselves into a notable

481
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,120
 town and it worked.

482
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,320
 There is a place that's already done that.

483
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:01,840
 There's a place called, oh God, what's it called?

484
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:06,720
 Britain, Ohio, which has an exclamation mark after Hamilton.

485
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,720
 But they changed it.

486
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:11,120
 They just voted on it in the '70s, just to put the exclamation mark in, yeah.

487
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,920
 They hadn't just turned themselves into a musical.

488
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,920
 No.

489
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,920
 It sounds like a musical, doesn't it?

490
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,920
 Yeah.

491
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:19,800
 But they wanted more tourists and they wanted more revenue from tourists, so they did that.

492
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,800
 And it worked.

493
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,800
 I think it worked.

494
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,800
 But also, yeah.

495
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:26,120
 That's the fact that they could come up with put an exclamation mark in their name.

496
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,800
 Well, I mean, it's cost-effective, isn't it?

497
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,800
 Yeah.

498
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,960
 - Flamfer, blah, blah, blah.

499
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,880
 - We definitely get letters for that one.

500
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,200
 (laughing)

501
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,440
 - Say the short one.

502
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,280
 - Flamfer PG.

503
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:39,600
 I went there because I was in North Wales,

504
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,800
 and it was about a 50 mile drive from where I was,

505
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,360
 but I just wanted to go to that place.

506
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,520
 - Okay. - Okay.

507
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,880
 - And I bought a mug.

508
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,640
 So there we go. - There we go.

509
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,680
 - Now if everyone did that,

510
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,080
 they'd sell 60 million mugs a year.

511
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:54,520
 So there was a town in America as well

512
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,600
 that claimed to be the center of the universe.

513
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,600
 Danny Wallistered this as a book, 'cause it just

514
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,680
 no one else knew where the center of the universe was.

515
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,960
 - Yeah, it's a mess had something like,

516
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,520
 I've spoken to a lot of physicists and astrophysicists,

517
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,000
 and they said that the universe

518
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,560
 doesn't really have a center.

519
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,520
 So if nowhere else is claiming to have it,

520
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,880
 then I think we'll have it.

521
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,560
 And he claimed there was like a bench or a manhole cover

522
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,840
 or something in the middle of the town.

523
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,480
 He said, right, this is a center of the universe,

524
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,680
 and they put a little plaque up.

525
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,760
 - Amazing. - Good, good, good.

526
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,720
 - I think that was quite fun.

527
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,720
 Yeah.

528
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,840
 So, okay, that was pretty bold of Britannica to do that.

529
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,680
 But you're saying that's a bit of a disputed?

530
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,680
 - No, it's not disputed.

531
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,960
 It's, they definitely did do that.

532
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,400
 And Wales obviously deserves its own section

533
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,360
 in that we have a 1911 Britannica in this office,

534
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,880
 and that has a very large section on Wales.

535
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,720
 So they soon amended it.

536
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,880
 - Yeah, I was wondering if, when you told us this fact,

537
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,480
 where there may be if you turned to England,

538
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,080
 it would have an entry that was like C Wales,

539
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,760
 which did use to happen.

540
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,560
 So there's this guy's written this really good book

541
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:54,880
 called Reading the OED, it's by Amon Shea,

542
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,760
 and he read the whole OED recently.

543
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:00,680
 It was before it was re-edited in 2007, I think.

544
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,720
 So he read the OED from before that

545
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,320
 and found a bunch of hilarious stuff.

546
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,960
 One of which was the word un-poetic

547
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,640
 for which the entry just said C.F. below.

548
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:13,040
 And the word below was un-poetical and it said C.F. above.

549
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,240
 So that was quite a good one.

550
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,600
 - Oh, lovely.

551
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,120
 - There are other excellent ones.

552
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,080
 So there's one that's created for the word

553
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:25,080
 Disgibeline, which is D-I-S-G-H-I-B-E-L-L-I-N-E,

554
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:28,360
 and the definition is to distinguish

555
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,680
 as a gwealth from a gibeline.

556
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,160
 (laughing)

557
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,960
 - Well, someone was really proud of himself

558
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:34,800
 of coming up with that.

559
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,160
 - Sounds like Leah, doesn't it, that.

560
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:39,280
 - Yeah. - It sounds like a milk gwealth.

561
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:42,200
 - A gray whale, I'd like to be a friend.

562
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,440
 - A bit friend. - A bit friend, yeah.

563
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,280
 - Friend.

564
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:47,680
 In the first edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica,

565
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:52,480
 which is even more basic and rude than the 1888 one.

566
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,360
 Rude is in simple, not as in rude.

567
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,360
 But the entry for woman just says,

568
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:59,000
 the female of man, C.Homo.

569
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,840
 And the entry on tobacco says that excessive use

570
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:05,640
 is capable of quotes drying up the brain

571
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,760
 to a little black lump consisting of mere membranes.

572
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,600
 (laughing)

573
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,600
 - They should put that on cigarette packets, shouldn't they?

574
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,320
 - Yeah. (laughing)

575
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,800
 - There was a book, you know in the OED,

576
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,640
 how you have sauces for each of the things.

577
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,640
 So it'll have, what was that word you just said?

578
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,840
 - Discubiline. - Discubiline.

579
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,080
 It would have discubiline,

580
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,200
 and then it would have the sauce for where they found it,

581
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,480
 which book they found it in.

582
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,760
 There are 51 words in the OED,

583
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,320
 which have the sauce, "Meandering's of Memory"

584
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,960
 by someone called Nightlark.

585
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,400
 And no one knows what that book is.

586
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,200
 - Oh. - Did they know who Nightlark is?

587
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,760
 - No. - That's great.

588
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:45,760
 - Just very quickly on this idea of the mysterious book,

589
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:50,480
 yeah, I read this story when I was looking into stuff

590
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,440
 about posting yourself across the country.

591
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,760
 In 1976, so starting in 1976,

592
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,840
 residents in a small town called Circleville in Ohio,

593
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:04,520
 population 13,000, they all started receiving

594
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:08,160
 these letters, accusing them of various misdeeds,

595
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,960
 and the letters were just anonymous.

596
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,760
 No one knew, but everyone in the town was getting them.

597
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,440
 - Wow. - And they had theories

598
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,960
 to who was sending them.

599
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:20,000
 There was a theory that it was a writer called Ron Giuseppe,

600
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,480
 who was writing them, but then he mysteriously died.

601
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:27,000
 But the letters continued coming to them until the 1990s,

602
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:27,960
 and then they just stopped.

603
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,160
 - It's a bit like, I know what you did last summer.

604
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,640
 - Yeah. - And I know what you did last summer,

605
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,680
 and I know what you did last summer.

606
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,880
 - I don't know what they did last summer.

607
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,080
 I've never seen it.

608
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,280
 - Oh. - They killed someone with a car.

609
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,120
 - Spoiler alert.

610
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,880
 (all laughing)

611
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,680
 - So bringing it back to Wales,

612
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:47,520
 it does at least get the chance to laugh in our faces

613
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,400
 when we cook up, which we often do where Wales is concerned.

614
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,440
 So street signs are a quite a famous example, aren't they?

615
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,120
 There was that sign that went up in Wales a couple of years ago.

616
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,760
 So there was the English above,

617
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,560
 which said something like, take the next left

618
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,840
 if you want to get to X place,

619
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,960
 and then the translation in Welsh below actually translated as,

620
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,440
 "I am not in the office at the moment,

621
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,280
 send any work to be translated."

622
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,080
 (all laughing)

623
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,440
 - There's a sign between Cardiff and Penarth that tells cyclists

624
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,440
 that they've got a problem with an inflamed bladder.

625
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,040
 That's what the translation is.

626
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:21,560
 And there's a sign for pedestrians in Cardiff

627
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,640
 that reads, "Look right in English."

628
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,360
 And the Welsh translation below is, "Look left."

629
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,600
 (all laughing)

630
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,480
 - Okay, that's it.

631
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,320
 That's the end of our show.

632
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,320
 Those are all of our facts.

633
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,480
 Thanks everyone for listening.

634
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:36,240
 If you want to get in contact and talk more about the stuff

635
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,960
 that we've been mentioning on this podcast,

636
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:41,200
 you can get Andy on @AndrewHunterM, James.

637
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,480
 - @egshaped.

638
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,320
 - Anna.

639
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,960
 - You can email podcast@QI.com.

640
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,320
 - And if you want to get through to me to save me

641
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,160
 from being fired for all of my missbacks,

642
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,960
 and want to help me out on the idea that maybe camels

643
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,280
 do vomit up stuff that we can then re-eat,

644
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:59,120
 that bubbles are taken out of sparkling water

645
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,280
 and reintroduced into the bottle

646
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,040
 on the other side of the journey.

647
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:06,160
 I can be gone on @Shryberland.

648
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,480
 You can also go to qi.com/podcast

649
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,200
 where we're gonna have all of the facts

650
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,080
 that we've been talking about as well as links

651
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,600
 to further research, to extra videos and pictures

652
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,680
 of that giant trampoline and so on.

653
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:20,440
 And we've also got all the other episodes that we've done.

654
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,400
 And you can explore those pages as well.

655
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,760
 We'll be back again next week.

656
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,600
 Goodbye.

657
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,840
 (upbeat music)

658
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,960
 - Just to add a post podcast addendum to that,

659
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,800
 Dan and Andy are currently absent from the QI offices,

660
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,360
 both performing shows in Edinburgh.

661
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,040
 They've got two shows each,

662
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:42,280
 so Andy's got ostentatious and fully adur,

663
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,360
 so obviously go to both of those multiple times

664
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,920
 if you're listening, and Dan will be performing

665
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,920
 his stand-up cock-blocked from outer space,

666
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,720
 and he's also gonna be in the Museum of Curiosity,

667
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,280
 which is doing live shows at Edinburgh.

668
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,040
 So anyone who's anywhere near there

669
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:59,400
 should definitely go to see them, apparently there.

670
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,040
 Apparently they're quite funny.

671
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,880
 And if you'd like to buy any ham, please go to

672
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,200
 Mr. Fellas' Humshop in Oxford.

673
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,680
 Do.

674
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,680
 Best time in the country and the oldest.

675
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:14,280
 (upbeat music)

676
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,920
 âª You follow me âª

677
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,420
 âª I follow you âª

678
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:22,000
 (upbeat music)

679
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,580
 (upbeat music)
