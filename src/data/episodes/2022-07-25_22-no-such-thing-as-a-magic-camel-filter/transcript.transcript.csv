00:00:00,00:00:01,We run it on QI a few years ago.
00:00:01,00:00:02,Yeah.
00:00:02,00:00:04,"And which was, there's no such thing as a fish."
00:00:04,00:00:05,It's kind of a nice such thing as a fish.
00:00:05,00:00:09,"No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life."
00:00:09,00:00:12,"It says it right there, first paragraph, no such thing as a fish."
00:00:12,00:00:25,"Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,"
00:00:25,00:00:28,a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.
00:00:28,00:00:29,My name is Dan Triber.
00:00:29,00:00:33,"I'm sitting here with the regular three elves, Andy Murray, Anna Chazinski,"
00:00:33,00:00:34,and James Harkin.
00:00:34,00:00:36,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:36,00:00:39,to share our favorite facts from the last seven days.
00:00:39,00:00:40,"So again, let's do it."
00:00:40,00:00:43,"Our favorite facts, James."
00:00:43,00:00:48,"My fact is that in 1903, a man called W. Reginald Bray"
00:00:48,00:00:50,posted himself.
00:00:50,00:00:51,Wow.
00:00:51,00:00:52,How?
00:00:52,00:00:53,How?
00:00:53,00:00:56,He stuck a stamp on himself and walked down to the post office
00:00:56,00:01:01,"and said, I want to be taken to a house, which happens to be his own house."
00:01:01,00:01:02,And they took him.
00:01:02,00:01:03,Yeah.
00:01:03,00:01:04,Was it a slow day for him?
00:01:04,00:01:05,Finished his book?
00:01:05,00:01:07,I didn't know what to do.
00:01:07,00:01:12,"He was a bit of a wager, a bit of a practical joker."
00:01:12,00:01:16,And one of the things he did was he read through all of the post office
00:01:16,00:01:21,guide and worked out what the smallest and largest things he could post were.
00:01:21,00:01:24,So he discovered that the smallest item that he could post was 1b.
00:01:24,00:01:26,And so he posted that.
00:01:26,00:01:29,"And the largest was an elephant, but he couldn't find an elephant."
00:01:29,00:01:30,So he posted himself.
00:01:30,00:01:31,What year was this?
00:01:31,00:01:32,1903.
00:01:32,00:01:33,1903.
00:01:33,00:01:39,"It sounds like, because there's so many examples of people just testing the limits of the"
00:01:39,00:01:40,posting system.
00:01:40,00:01:41,Yeah.
00:01:41,00:01:43,"Like just a bunch of practical jokers going, how far can we push this?"
00:01:43,00:01:49,"There was a guy who sent an entire building's worth of bricks, because he was building a"
00:01:49,00:01:54,bank in a different city and the cheapest way was just to send the bricks via the post.
00:01:54,00:01:55,Oh my god.
00:01:55,00:01:56,Were they individually wrapped?
00:01:56,00:01:58,"No, I think that's what I hoped they were."
00:01:58,00:02:02,That would be a brilliant admin job for someone that's sticking the stamps on and putting them in.
00:02:02,00:02:04,"Yeah, Alex would love that."
00:02:04,00:02:06,He sent them at 40 at a time.
00:02:06,00:02:08,They must have not introduced weight limits then.
00:02:08,00:02:10,That must have been when they did it by size.
00:02:10,00:02:11,That's where they brought it.
00:02:11,00:02:12,That's where they introduced the scales.
00:02:12,00:02:16,"That's when they brought it in, £200 per day, the limit that they then imposed."
00:02:16,00:02:19,There's a weird history of people posting themselves.
00:02:19,00:02:20,It's not just this guy.
00:02:20,00:02:21,There's been a few cents.
00:02:21,00:02:23,A guy called Mr. Seng.
00:02:23,00:02:24,I'm not sure where he was from.
00:02:24,00:02:30,He decided to post himself in a sealed box and he thought it would just be a 30-minute
00:02:30,00:02:36,"journey, but they put him in the wrong pile and he was stuck in there for three hours and"
00:02:36,00:02:40,"he didn't make a hole in his box so he could hardly breathe and when they cut him out, he'd"
00:02:40,00:02:46,"passed out and when they interviewed him in the newspaper afterwards, he said, ""I tried"
00:02:46,00:02:50,"to make a hole in the cardboard, but it was too thick and I didn't want to spoil the surprise"
00:02:50,00:03:00,"by shouting, 'Wow!' That was a real dedication to a surprise."
00:03:00,00:03:05,But then he couldn't really jump out and say surprise because he passed out.
00:03:05,00:03:10,And was it a good surprise or was it like he was a burglar and he was going to jump out
00:03:10,00:03:11,and then round sack of house?
00:03:11,00:03:18,"Well there was a guy who posted himself, what was it now, okay so there was a guy who decided"
00:03:18,00:03:22,"he wanted to cross America and he was called Mr. McKinley, I don't know what his first"
00:03:22,00:03:23,name was.
00:03:23,00:03:29,And he decided to be better to go in a box because he could charge the postage to his company
00:03:29,00:03:32,rather than paying for the ticket which you have to pay for himself.
00:03:32,00:03:35,"That's how I get to work every day, it's the same thing here."
00:03:35,00:03:36,Sorry going.
00:03:36,00:03:41,"Yeah, you're always arriving by second post, don't you?"
00:03:41,00:03:42,Oh snap.
00:03:42,00:03:43,Oh snap.
00:03:43,00:03:49,I won't mind but I'm very far the latest of it. So he built the $550 freight charge to
00:03:49,00:03:51,his employer and climbed into the crate.
00:03:51,00:03:56,"Of course by being in a plane he was lucky, he was in a plane which was like air conditioning"
00:03:56,00:03:59,"and stuff but a lot of them, it's very dangerous because they're you know it's very cold"
00:03:59,00:04:01,for you to die in that.
00:04:01,00:04:05,"Do you know you used to be able to send children by post, right?"
00:04:05,00:04:06,Yeah.
00:04:06,00:04:08,You used to be able to post children around the place.
00:04:08,00:04:11,Until 1920 was it in the US anyway?
00:04:11,00:04:12,Yeah.
00:04:12,00:04:13,It was banned officially.
00:04:13,00:04:14,And until around then.
00:04:14,00:04:19,But you would buy the stamps and you would put the stamps on the child's jacket and then
00:04:19,00:04:24,the child would sit in for example the mail van of the train and they were a bit of post.
00:04:24,00:04:27,And you could I think you could lump all your posts together because there are pictures
00:04:27,00:04:33,of children with posts strapped to them and then they turn up and be like not only an icon.
00:04:33,00:04:35,Just going back to W Reginald Bray.
00:04:35,00:04:36,Oh yeah.
00:04:36,00:04:38,He has his own website which I didn't know.
00:04:38,00:04:39,He's amazing.
00:04:39,00:04:43,Yeah but the website is absolutely fantastic.
00:04:43,00:04:47,He collected a lot of autographs so he sent thousands of cards out to people asking them
00:04:47,00:04:53,to be returned autographed to the Pope or his local railway station master and on the website
00:04:53,00:04:58,"it has this lovely line which is over the years Reginald amassed over 15,000 autographs declaring"
00:04:58,00:05:03,"himself the autograph king, a title that was undisputed by his peers."
00:05:03,00:05:12,Imagine you were like his pretender.
00:05:12,00:05:15,I think you wouldn't tell him that you had all these autographs and then you go up to him
00:05:15,00:05:19,and go excuse me you the guy who's got the most autographs in the world.
00:05:19,00:05:23,Which you mind just signing that and then when he signed it you have a beat.
00:05:23,00:05:25,Yeah you have one over him.
00:05:25,00:05:26,Oh that's good.
00:05:26,00:05:27,That's very cool.
00:05:27,00:05:28,Yeah.
00:05:28,00:05:56,So I think you're not allowed to transport helium in any way because it's explosive isn't
00:05:56,00:05:57,it?
00:05:57,00:05:58,Yeah.
00:05:58,00:06:00,They were wrapping helium in a balloon.
00:06:00,00:06:01,In a rubber.
00:06:01,00:06:02,That's true.
00:06:02,00:06:03,Yeah.
00:06:03,00:06:07,So one of the most common questions that gets us to the US postal system is can you mail
00:06:07,00:06:09,a dog?
00:06:09,00:06:13,"They get this question all the time, says spokesperson Sue Brennan."
00:06:13,00:06:14,The answer is no.
00:06:14,00:06:15,Can't mail a dog.
00:06:15,00:06:16,No.
00:06:16,00:06:19,The whole point of postman and dogs is that they don't get along.
00:06:19,00:06:23,Can you imagine a dog in a sorting office?
00:06:23,00:06:27,It's actually they've worked out how many for some reason they've only done this in Germany
00:06:27,00:06:32,but three thousand postman a year a bit and buy dogs in Germany and two thousand two
00:06:32,00:06:37,hundred and fifty five pairs of trousers are torn resulting in eight million pounds worth
00:06:37,00:06:38,of medical bills.
00:06:38,00:06:44,In 2001 the German post office started teaching dog psychology to postman.
00:06:44,00:06:46,It's just it's just a permanent ongoing war.
00:06:46,00:06:47,Postman.
00:06:47,00:06:48,Yeah.
00:06:48,00:06:49,Dog battle.
00:06:49,00:06:51,Because the postman are not allowed to carry weapons.
00:06:51,00:06:52,And dogs are?
00:06:52,00:06:53,They are weapons.
00:06:53,00:06:56,"Oh, that's that's not a mate."
00:06:56,00:07:02,That's like saying that was it Joe Lewis who had his his fists designated a weapon.
00:07:02,00:07:03,Jackie Chan.
00:07:03,00:07:06,I've always heard about this and I've never believed it.
00:07:06,00:07:07,Is it true?
00:07:07,00:07:09,"I think I think when you say you've always heard it, I think it's me literally repeating"
00:07:09,00:07:10,it.
00:07:10,00:07:11,Yeah.
00:07:11,00:07:12,Most days.
00:07:12,00:07:17,Jackie Chan told Wuppie Goldberg and a number of others on the view that when he's in
00:07:17,00:07:23,"America, he is considered his fists to be an illegal weapon."
00:07:23,00:07:25,Do you get all of your facts from the view?
00:07:25,00:07:30,"Actually, no, I don't because they're a bit I remember watching an episode where they were"
00:07:30,00:07:34,talking about the possibility that the moon landings didn't happen that it was a hoax
00:07:34,00:07:38,"and Wuppie Goldberg was going, I don't want to like speculate about the truth about it,"
00:07:38,00:07:42,"but all I'm saying is, you know, who was filming Neil when he went down on the ladder?"
00:07:42,00:07:44,Who was holding that camera?
00:07:44,00:07:45,I don't want to speculate.
00:07:45,00:07:51,"It's like, Wuppie, you know, Wuppie Goldberg got her nickname due to her childhood flatulence."
00:07:51,00:07:52,"Oh, yeah."
00:07:52,00:07:53,She was a big fighter.
00:07:53,00:07:54,Yeah.
00:07:54,00:07:55,"She, Wuppie."
00:07:55,00:07:56,"Yeah, that's right."
00:07:56,00:07:57,That's good.
00:07:57,00:07:58,Yeah.
00:07:58,00:07:59,"And she worked in a morgue, didn't she?"
00:07:59,00:08:00,"Yeah, she."
00:08:00,00:08:01,I might mention it.
00:08:01,00:08:02,"But putting makeup on corpses and then everyone, when she works in everyone's like, what's"
00:08:02,00:08:03,that smell?
00:08:03,00:08:04,Yeah.
00:08:04,00:08:07,It's not like people just woke up and walks out.
00:08:07,00:08:08,Oh god.
00:08:08,00:08:09,Who was it?
00:08:09,00:08:10,Did someone send a load of wasps?
00:08:10,00:08:11,Yes.
00:08:11,00:08:16,You can make wasps go to sleep and they were sent on a flight and the flight was delayed
00:08:16,00:08:18,or something and they all woke up.
00:08:18,00:08:24,"You can still buy parasitic wasps through the post and therefore, like pest control instead"
00:08:24,00:08:27,"of using pesticides, you can use them."
00:08:27,00:08:30,And then what do you get mail to you to get rid of the parasitic wasps in the infestation
00:08:30,00:08:31,that you've now got?
00:08:31,00:08:34,Then you get a spider to catch the fly.
00:08:34,00:08:35,"Fly, yeah."
00:08:35,00:08:39,There was always a big flaw in that song because cows don't eat dogs.
00:08:39,00:08:48,"Okay, time for fact number two and that is my fact."
00:08:48,00:08:54,My fact this week is that the oldest edible ham has just celebrated its 112th birthday.
00:08:54,00:08:56,So how do we know it's edible?
00:08:56,00:08:59,"Oh, because it's quite a famous ham."
00:08:59,00:09:04,It first came to prominence when it celebrated its 100th birthday and someone has since
00:09:04,00:09:08,"bought it and I guess anytime it has a birthday now, people mention it."
00:09:08,00:09:12,"So I wanted to dispute this claim because my local butcher, Mr. Feller, best butcher in"
00:09:12,00:09:13,the world.
00:09:13,00:09:14,You guys should all go to him.
00:09:14,00:09:18,And we sponsored by Mr. Feller now.
00:09:18,00:09:22,I have been past Mr. Feller's place in the cover market and I can confirm there is a very
00:09:22,00:09:23,old ham in the winter.
00:09:23,00:09:29,"Yeah, so he claims I think he bought it in 1993 when it was 101."
00:09:29,00:09:33,It cost him 990 pounds but he said he would have paid at least five grand for it because
00:09:33,00:09:34,it was so special.
00:09:34,00:09:42,It is now 125 he says and he says that when he bought it from the auctioneer that was selling
00:09:42,00:09:45,"off, they said they weren't sure it was edible, but he's the butcher."
00:09:45,00:09:46,He should know.
00:09:46,00:09:47,Why is he not in the news?
00:09:47,00:09:48,Why is he not?
00:09:48,00:09:49,It hasn't been proven.
00:09:49,00:09:50,Hasn't officially verified.
00:09:50,00:09:52,Is this like the autograph guy?
00:09:52,00:09:53,Like no one else can be bothered.
00:09:53,00:09:57,"They're like, yeah, we have way older ham dude but like we don't need the title of world"
00:09:57,00:09:58,oldest ham.
00:09:58,00:09:59,I think he's above that.
00:09:59,00:10:00,Yeah.
00:10:00,00:10:01,Wow.
00:10:01,00:10:07,But to the world's tallest man who I think was certified the world's tallest man and then
00:10:07,00:10:12,he refused to do the tests anymore so they stripped him of his title and I think there
00:10:12,00:10:16,is another man who is now officially the world's tallest man but actually is slightly shorter
00:10:16,00:10:17,than the previous man.
00:10:17,00:10:19,Why did he refuse to be remeasured?
00:10:19,00:10:24,He doesn't want the hassle of being the world's tallest man because when you're the world's
00:10:24,00:10:27,"tallest man, people come to see you as if you're an attraction."
00:10:27,00:10:33,I remember reading this odd fact about the idea that there are no children in the town
00:10:33,00:10:38,not because he's scared them away but just because there's too much hassle to have a super
00:10:38,00:10:41,tall guy and kids in the same town.
00:10:41,00:10:44,I can't remember the exact fact but it was...
00:10:44,00:10:50,It's Operation Here's the Size of a Utrecht.
00:10:50,00:10:51,Old things that have been eaten.
00:10:51,00:10:56,A German pensioner who received a tin of American lard 64 years ago in an aid package has
00:10:56,00:11:00,only just tasted it after discovering that it is still edible.
00:11:00,00:11:01,Oh wow.
00:11:01,00:11:04,"I just didn't want to throw it away, said Hans Feldmeyer 87."
00:11:04,00:11:10,So that's the spirit which makes people keep ham for decades when it's just the not very
00:11:10,00:11:11,nice ham.
00:11:11,00:11:12,Yeah.
00:11:12,00:11:17,"In 2005 we found a 4,000 year old bowl of noodles in China which I quite like that they're"
00:11:17,00:11:21,still in the bowl and that settled the debate because there's quite a heated debate I think
00:11:21,00:11:27,between Chinese Arabs and Italians over who first came up with the noodle and that's the
00:11:27,00:11:29,oldest evidence of a noodle.
00:11:29,00:11:31,So China's got it at the moment.
00:11:31,00:11:38,"Speaking of well preserved food there's obviously the Kiviac, the Inuit food which is made"
00:11:38,00:11:41,from orcs that are preserved in the hollowed out body of a seal.
00:11:41,00:11:44,"Yeah, so you stuff them in there for seven or eight months and they're completely preserved"
00:11:44,00:11:45,then you get them out and eat them.
00:11:45,00:11:48,Apparently they're pretty disgusting but that was them.
00:11:48,00:11:54,So I do quite like the Wikipedia page which is so it's called Kiviac and at the top of
00:11:54,00:11:59,the Wikipedia page it says not to be confused with Kiviac person.
00:11:59,00:12:02,So sometimes I think Wikipedia goes overboard with their clarifications then.
00:12:02,00:12:08,I don't think anyone's looks up there make Kiviac and you never told me you were a food
00:12:08,00:12:11,stuff that gets preserved in a seal skin for eight months.
00:12:11,00:12:15,Isn't there a thing with camels whereby if you have poisonous water you get the camel
00:12:15,00:12:20,to drink it and then it vomits it back up and that makes it drinkable.
00:12:20,00:12:22,Have you ever heard about this?
00:12:22,00:12:23,I have not heard that.
00:12:23,00:12:24,Why didn't you look it up?
00:12:24,00:12:27,Drinkable because a camel has thrown off in it.
00:12:27,00:12:28,Why?
00:12:28,00:12:29,Because it filters it.
00:12:29,00:12:32,There's something about it's poisonous food or it's water or it's—
00:12:32,00:12:39,But as website I'm getting is six dangerous urban survival myths about water.
00:12:39,00:12:45,"Actually, I'm reading this page now and it doesn't mention Dan's insane camel"
00:12:45,00:12:46,theory.
00:12:46,00:12:47,"Wow, this is really interesting."
00:12:47,00:12:51,You shouldn't necessarily cut open those big barrel cacti.
00:12:51,00:12:53,The odds are that the inside will be tough and fibrous.
00:12:53,00:12:56,The water contained will not be abundant and also there's a greater chance the water inside
00:12:56,00:13:00,"will be better and acidic which could induce vomiting, diarrhea and cramp."
00:13:00,00:13:05,"Well, at least if you vomits it someone else could drink it."
00:13:05,00:13:11,Imagine having a magic vomiting camel which purify anything.
00:13:11,00:13:12,Yeah I think I've got it wrong somewhere.
00:13:12,00:13:15,I think it's to do with food.
00:13:15,00:13:19,"Google food, camel vomit, survival."
00:13:19,00:13:26,If anyone knows about this camel weird survival tip then send us a message to @tribalandor.
00:13:26,00:13:32,I read a thing about how we have been making attempts to create food that last longer.
00:13:32,00:13:36,So obviously this ham is kind of an anomaly in that it's very old and that's very notable.
00:13:36,00:13:41,But in the army because they obviously have to have food that's nicely preserved but
00:13:41,00:13:42,they want people to eat well.
00:13:42,00:13:46,They've been intempting to make interesting long-lasting foods and sandwiches is one of the big
00:13:46,00:13:47,things.
00:13:47,00:13:49,Most soldiers apparently want sandwiches.
00:13:49,00:13:54,They've currently made a sandwich which can last for two years and not go stale or soggy.
00:13:54,00:13:58,And the people who made it are trying to work what they're calling an immortal peanut butter
00:13:58,00:13:59,and jelly sandwich.
00:13:59,00:14:00,That's the dream.
00:14:00,00:14:01,So we can be at war forever.
00:14:01,00:14:02,Right.
00:14:02,00:14:04,That's what they want.
00:14:04,00:14:09,One soldier said they're the best two-year-old sandwiches I've ever eaten.
00:14:09,00:14:12,Did you know that they fill all crisp packets with nitrogen instead of with oxygen?
00:14:12,00:14:15,So that the crisps don't go off.
00:14:15,00:14:16,Instead of with air.
00:14:16,00:14:17,They don't put air in.
00:14:17,00:14:19,They get rid of all the oxygen in the packets to keep them fresh.
00:14:19,00:14:20,Yeah.
00:14:20,00:14:21,Ash was telling me.
00:14:21,00:14:26,"Ash, who is the lead singer of Emperor Yes, who did our theme tune."
00:14:26,00:14:30,"He was saying that when sparkling water is transported overseas, they take the bubbles"
00:14:30,00:14:31,out.
00:14:31,00:14:35,And then they put the bubbles back in when they reach their country destination.
00:14:35,00:14:36,Has no one heard this?
00:14:36,00:14:37,You can.
00:14:37,00:14:38,No.
00:14:38,00:14:39,Okay.
00:14:39,00:14:40,If anyone listening can help me out.
00:14:40,00:14:43,The real water is they forgot to put the bubbles back in.
00:14:43,00:14:46,That's when the bubbles have ended up in a different country.
00:14:46,00:14:52,"I do know that when they made you cut coffee, they sell the caffeine to soft drinks companies"
00:14:52,00:14:53,to put into soft drinks.
00:14:53,00:14:54,Isn't that amazing?
00:14:54,00:14:55,Yeah.
00:14:55,00:14:57,I would love to know what caffeine looks like.
00:14:57,00:14:58,Isn't it funny?
00:14:58,00:15:03,"How you said that, and I just accepted it, and when Dan said it, I just immediately thought"
00:15:03,00:15:04,it was rubbish.
00:15:04,00:15:06,It's the boy who cried both.
00:15:06,00:15:12,Okay.
00:15:12,00:15:17,"It's time to move on to fact number three, and that is Chazinski."
00:15:17,00:15:22,"Yes, my fact is that orangutans like playing on iPads, but gorillas do not."
00:15:22,00:15:23,Really?
00:15:23,00:15:24,Yeah.
00:15:24,00:15:30,"So, this actually started as an April Fools joke by the Sun, and the heading of their article"
00:15:30,00:15:33,"was Planet of the Apps, saying how gorillas love playing Angry Birds."
00:15:33,00:15:34,That would be good.
00:15:34,00:15:38,"And yeah, good old Sun, always wants to have a head with the wit."
00:15:38,00:15:42,"And it gave the idea, and some guy who worked at Milwaukee County Zoo read this article and"
00:15:42,00:15:47,"thought, ""Hey, actually, Apps rapes, good idea,"" and started showing gorillas iPads."
00:15:47,00:15:52,But they didn't like it because so gorillas are feel threatened by direct eye contact and
00:15:52,00:15:53,face-to-face contact.
00:15:53,00:15:57,"So they do a lot of their interacting sight in a side-long way, and so that doesn't work"
00:15:57,00:15:59,"very well with iPads because you can already see it properly, and then as soon as you look"
00:15:59,00:16:03,"at it, you feel like the birds trying to attack you, and they smash it."
00:16:03,00:16:04,Wow.
00:16:04,00:16:07,Here's the thing about gorillas and eye contact.
00:16:07,00:16:11,"There was a zoo that gave out these glasses, do you remember that?"
00:16:11,00:16:15,"And they were glasses with pinholes in, so you could still see them, but they had pictures"
00:16:15,00:16:18,of eyes looking in different directions.
00:16:18,00:16:22,"And the idea was, you would look at the gorillas, but the gorillas wouldn't know that you were"
00:16:22,00:16:23,looking at them.
00:16:23,00:16:27,"Yeah, I think it's Rotterdam Zoo, isn't it, and I think I've been after a woman got attacked"
00:16:27,00:16:28,by a gorilla.
00:16:28,00:16:32,"The only downside, it seems, is that they play on these iPads about half an hour."
00:16:32,00:16:37,"But if you give it to them to hold, they have smashed quite a few in the past."
00:16:37,00:16:41,So the zookeeper or the staff have to hold the iPad while the orangutans play on it.
00:16:41,00:16:42,"That's right, I think the-"
00:16:42,00:16:43,She's a bit of a hassle.
00:16:43,00:16:48,I think I read the average length of an unsmashed iPad left alone with an orangutan
00:16:48,00:16:51,is 15 seconds.
00:16:51,00:16:52,That's the limit.
00:16:52,00:16:58,"Wow, which is actually the battery life as well."
00:16:58,00:17:00,"I really, really like orangutans."
00:17:00,00:17:01,I think they're brilliant.
00:17:01,00:17:03,"They're solitary, apparently."
00:17:03,00:17:08,"So they spend all of their time, they know their neighbours by sight, but avoid all contact"
00:17:08,00:17:09,with them.
00:17:09,00:17:12,"So in that sense, not unlike Londoners."
00:17:12,00:17:15,But they also make a lot of noise to advertise their whereabouts so that they can avoid each
00:17:15,00:17:16,other.
00:17:16,00:17:19,"It's something rather beautiful and tragic about that, isn't it?"
00:17:19,00:17:22,"Just everyone going around saying, ""Here I am, don't come near me."""
00:17:22,00:17:23,I can't.
00:17:23,00:17:24,They're British.
00:17:24,00:17:25,They're British.
00:17:25,00:17:26,Yeah.
00:17:26,00:17:29,They've come up with the idea of showing arangs in other zoos.
00:17:29,00:17:30,Arangs?
00:17:30,00:17:34,"They don't like that, Andy."
00:17:34,00:17:35,Yeah.
00:17:35,00:17:40,They've come up with the idea of showing orangutans in other zoos pictures of orangutans they
00:17:40,00:17:43,"might like to have sex with, they might like to mate with, so that they can do breeding"
00:17:43,00:17:48,programmes rather than going to the hassle of transporting an orangutan across the country
00:17:48,00:17:51,"and then to find out they actually, they don't fancy each other."
00:17:51,00:17:53,"But can they fancy each other through a screen, no wonder?"
00:17:53,00:17:54,"Yeah, basically."
00:17:54,00:17:55,It's like Tinder.
00:17:55,00:17:56,I don't know.
00:17:56,00:17:57,Yeah.
00:17:57,00:17:58,Isn't that weird?
00:17:58,00:18:02,"Is that the younger ones take to the iPads much better than the older ones, the older ones"
00:18:02,00:18:05,"are much more set in their ways, saying the same thing?"
00:18:05,00:18:08,An orangutan was the villain in the first ever detective story.
00:18:08,00:18:11,"Oh, what supposed to be the first thing to think about?"
00:18:11,00:18:12,The murder in the remog.
00:18:12,00:18:15,"Spoiler alert, the murderer isn't orangutan."
00:18:15,00:18:16,"Oh, I'm inspired."
00:18:16,00:18:21,"You can't say spoiler alert afterwards, can you?"
00:18:21,00:18:26,"And by the way, it was Hamlet's Step Dad, spoiler alert."
00:18:26,00:18:35,"Um, Ash told me, uh, that, gone, gone, I'm apparently dolphins."
00:18:35,00:18:40,"When they, when they start communicating, the words that they'll use to communicate, the"
00:18:40,00:18:46,first word will be their name and then the second word will be the action they're doing.
00:18:46,00:18:49,"So I'd be like, Dan, drinking and they all, they can pick their name as well."
00:18:49,00:18:51,That does sound more familiar to me.
00:18:51,00:18:54,I think I have heard that that dolphins use their names.
00:18:54,00:18:58,That's how you know when someone's about to speak on university challenge.
00:18:58,00:18:59,It's a dolphin.
00:18:59,00:19:00,It's a dolphin.
00:19:00,00:19:01,It's going to be good on.
00:19:01,00:19:02,Yeah.
00:19:02,00:19:03,Thompson Edinburgh.
00:19:03,00:19:04,Yeah.
00:19:04,00:19:05,"Flipper, UCL."
00:19:05,00:19:06,[laughter]
00:19:06,00:19:07,Yeah.
00:19:07,00:19:08,Yeah.
00:19:08,00:19:12,"Quite useful for people who forget people's names, though."
00:19:12,00:19:16,Wouldn't that be a great social habit if everyone had to say their own name before they started
00:19:16,00:19:17,speaking?
00:19:17,00:19:18,Yeah.
00:19:18,00:19:19,My life would be a lot easier.
00:19:19,00:19:20,"It's so much better, yeah."
00:19:20,00:19:23,"Um, under European regulations, pigs have to be mentally stimulated because I think"
00:19:23,00:19:26,"pigs are quite intelligent, so they get easily bored."
00:19:26,00:19:30,"Um, so they've developed pig chase, the pig video game."
00:19:30,00:19:31,Have you guys seen this?
00:19:31,00:19:34,And you can play a video game with a pig as a person.
00:19:34,00:19:39,And they have this huge screen in their style and there's like a glowing light on it and
00:19:39,00:19:42,you control the light and the pig snuffles up and follows the light.
00:19:42,00:19:45,And the aim is to get your finger on the eye pad to make contact with the pig snout on
00:19:45,00:19:49,the light and then you guide it towards goal and then your score and there's a big display
00:19:49,00:19:50,of fireworks.
00:19:50,00:19:51,"They're very good at it, apparently."
00:19:51,00:19:52,That's great.
00:19:52,00:19:53,I think it's a pig at a computer game.
00:19:53,00:19:54,I've said that.
00:19:54,00:19:55,I have a chance of winning.
00:19:55,00:20:01,"You used to be able to play chickens at knots and crosses in America, um, they had these"
00:20:01,00:20:02,machines.
00:20:02,00:20:04,There was definitely one in Coney Island.
00:20:04,00:20:06,"I'm not sure whether the others were, but there were a few and it was impossible to beat"
00:20:06,00:20:11,them because it's impossible to lose at knots and crosses if you play the right move.
00:20:11,00:20:15,They were trained to always go in the right place and so you would play these chickens at
00:20:15,00:20:17,knots and crosses and you could never beat them.
00:20:17,00:20:18,Wow.
00:20:18,00:20:22,"So if you can't beat a chicken at knots and crosses Andy, I don't fancy your chances"
00:20:22,00:20:25,playing a pig at Call of Duty.
00:20:25,00:20:34,"Okay, now it's time for a final fact of the show and that is Andy Hunter Murray."
00:20:34,00:20:41,"Okay, my fact is that the 1888 encyclopedia Britannica entry for Wales reads ""See England."""
00:20:41,00:20:46,Does it mean a place where you can see England?
00:20:46,00:20:47,Maybe.
00:20:47,00:20:54,"I think it's, so I just thought this would be time to rectify this, you know, historical"
00:20:54,00:20:57,imbalance and poor treatment by Britannica.
00:20:57,00:21:01,"But James, actually, you found something that makes this more complicated or that it's"
00:21:01,00:21:05,"not just an example of England being totally, you know, anti-Well show."
00:21:05,00:21:12,I've seen the assertion on a few websites and I found the text of the actual Britannica and
00:21:12,00:21:17,"it seems like the thing which is entitled England is actually about England and Wales, it's"
00:21:17,00:21:18,about South Britain.
00:21:18,00:21:23,"In the article for England, it says ""legal phrasology is not quite consistent on this head,"
00:21:23,00:21:28,but the more accurate description of South Britain is England and Wales rather than England
00:21:28,00:21:29,"only."""
00:21:29,00:21:34,"And in the article, they mention England and Wales as the whole thing rather than just England."
00:21:34,00:21:35,I see.
00:21:35,00:21:36,That's good.
00:21:36,00:21:37,You know?
00:21:37,00:21:38,Yeah.
00:21:38,00:21:39,"So I thought Wales, time for Wales."
00:21:39,00:21:40,I like Wales.
00:21:40,00:21:44,It's the largest underground trampoline.
00:21:44,00:21:45,"It's about to launch, yeah."
00:21:45,00:21:47,"Yeah, I think it's open now, I think."
00:21:47,00:21:48,"Yeah, about two weeks ago."
00:21:48,00:21:49,"No, sorry."
00:21:49,00:21:50,What?
00:21:50,00:21:51,Oh my God.
00:21:51,00:21:52,It's larger than St Paul's Cathedral.
00:21:52,00:21:56,And it's a place that's already famous because it has the world's longest zip buyer.
00:21:56,00:21:57,Oh wow.
00:21:57,00:22:02,We'll put photos of the underground trampoline out here because this is unbelievable.
00:22:02,00:22:08,"James, you've got a mug here which has a Welsh word on it."
00:22:08,00:22:16,"Yeah, the Welsh train place, which is the longest single word train place in the UK on"
00:22:16,00:22:17,Anglesy.
00:22:17,00:22:18,"Yeah, can you say the word?"
00:22:18,00:22:19,I can try.
00:22:19,00:22:20,Go for it.
00:22:20,00:22:25,"It might not be spot on, but it's something like Slamfea, Pugwinga, Kugera, Quiru and"
00:22:25,00:22:27,"Robble, Anticilio, Gorgogoch."
00:22:27,00:22:32,"Now, if you've spotted any mistakes in that, right in two James's personal mobile phone"
00:22:32,00:22:35,"number, which I'll read out now."
00:22:35,00:22:40,But the thing about that is that that was a manufactured name.
00:22:40,00:22:46,"Yeah, it's called Slamfea PG, Slamfea, Pugwinga, and they added all the extra bits, I think,"
00:22:46,00:22:48,as a publicity stunt.
00:22:48,00:22:49,They wanted a record.
00:22:49,00:22:50,"Oh, really?"
00:22:50,00:22:53,"Yeah, it was a very early publicity stunt where they tried to turn themselves into a notable"
00:22:53,00:22:55,town and it worked.
00:22:55,00:22:57,There is a place that's already done that.
00:22:57,00:23:01,"There's a place called, oh God, what's it called?"
00:23:01,00:23:06,"Britain, Ohio, which has an exclamation mark after Hamilton."
00:23:06,00:23:07,But they changed it.
00:23:07,00:23:11,"They just voted on it in the '70s, just to put the exclamation mark in, yeah."
00:23:11,00:23:12,They hadn't just turned themselves into a musical.
00:23:12,00:23:13,No.
00:23:13,00:23:14,"It sounds like a musical, doesn't it?"
00:23:14,00:23:15,Yeah.
00:23:15,00:23:19,"But they wanted more tourists and they wanted more revenue from tourists, so they did that."
00:23:19,00:23:20,And it worked.
00:23:20,00:23:21,I think it worked.
00:23:21,00:23:22,"But also, yeah."
00:23:22,00:23:26,That's the fact that they could come up with put an exclamation mark in their name.
00:23:26,00:23:27,"Well, I mean, it's cost-effective, isn't it?"
00:23:27,00:23:28,Yeah.
00:23:28,00:23:30,"- Flamfer, blah, blah, blah."
00:23:30,00:23:32,- We definitely get letters for that one.
00:23:32,00:23:34,(laughing)
00:23:34,00:23:35,- Say the short one.
00:23:35,00:23:36,- Flamfer PG.
00:23:36,00:23:39,"I went there because I was in North Wales,"
00:23:39,00:23:41,"and it was about a 50 mile drive from where I was,"
00:23:41,00:23:43,but I just wanted to go to that place.
00:23:43,00:23:44,- Okay. - Okay.
00:23:44,00:23:45,- And I bought a mug.
00:23:45,00:23:47,So there we go. - There we go.
00:23:47,00:23:48,"- Now if everyone did that,"
00:23:48,00:23:51,they'd sell 60 million mugs a year.
00:23:51,00:23:54,So there was a town in America as well
00:23:54,00:23:56,that claimed to be the center of the universe.
00:23:56,00:23:59,"Danny Wallistered this as a book, 'cause it just"
00:23:59,00:24:01,no one else knew where the center of the universe was.
00:24:01,00:24:03,"- Yeah, it's a mess had something like,"
00:24:03,00:24:06,"I've spoken to a lot of physicists and astrophysicists,"
00:24:06,00:24:08,and they said that the universe
00:24:08,00:24:09,doesn't really have a center.
00:24:09,00:24:11,"So if nowhere else is claiming to have it,"
00:24:11,00:24:12,then I think we'll have it.
00:24:12,00:24:15,And he claimed there was like a bench or a manhole cover
00:24:15,00:24:16,or something in the middle of the town.
00:24:16,00:24:18,"He said, right, this is a center of the universe,"
00:24:18,00:24:19,and they put a little plaque up.
00:24:19,00:24:20,"- Amazing. - Good, good, good."
00:24:20,00:24:22,- I think that was quite fun.
00:24:22,00:24:23,Yeah.
00:24:23,00:24:26,"So, okay, that was pretty bold of Britannica to do that."
00:24:26,00:24:28,But you're saying that's a bit of a disputed?
00:24:28,00:24:29,"- No, it's not disputed."
00:24:29,00:24:30,"It's, they definitely did do that."
00:24:30,00:24:33,And Wales obviously deserves its own section
00:24:33,00:24:36,"in that we have a 1911 Britannica in this office,"
00:24:36,00:24:38,and that has a very large section on Wales.
00:24:38,00:24:40,So they soon amended it.
00:24:40,00:24:43,"- Yeah, I was wondering if, when you told us this fact,"
00:24:43,00:24:45,"where there may be if you turned to England,"
00:24:45,00:24:48,"it would have an entry that was like C Wales,"
00:24:48,00:24:49,which did use to happen.
00:24:49,00:24:51,So there's this guy's written this really good book
00:24:51,00:24:54,"called Reading the OED, it's by Amon Shea,"
00:24:54,00:24:56,and he read the whole OED recently.
00:24:56,00:25:00,"It was before it was re-edited in 2007, I think."
00:25:00,00:25:02,So he read the OED from before that
00:25:02,00:25:04,and found a bunch of hilarious stuff.
00:25:04,00:25:06,One of which was the word un-poetic
00:25:06,00:25:09,for which the entry just said C.F. below.
00:25:09,00:25:13,And the word below was un-poetical and it said C.F. above.
00:25:13,00:25:14,So that was quite a good one.
00:25:14,00:25:15,"- Oh, lovely."
00:25:15,00:25:17,- There are other excellent ones.
00:25:17,00:25:20,So there's one that's created for the word
00:25:20,00:25:25,"Disgibeline, which is D-I-S-G-H-I-B-E-L-L-I-N-E,"
00:25:25,00:25:28,and the definition is to distinguish
00:25:28,00:25:30,as a gwealth from a gibeline.
00:25:30,00:25:32,(laughing)
00:25:32,00:25:33,"- Well, someone was really proud of himself"
00:25:33,00:25:34,of coming up with that.
00:25:34,00:25:36,"- Sounds like Leah, doesn't it, that."
00:25:36,00:25:39,- Yeah. - It sounds like a milk gwealth.
00:25:39,00:25:42,"- A gray whale, I'd like to be a friend."
00:25:42,00:25:43,"- A bit friend. - A bit friend, yeah."
00:25:43,00:25:44,- Friend.
00:25:44,00:25:47,"In the first edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica,"
00:25:47,00:25:52,which is even more basic and rude than the 1888 one.
00:25:52,00:25:54,"Rude is in simple, not as in rude."
00:25:54,00:25:56,"But the entry for woman just says,"
00:25:56,00:25:59,"the female of man, C.Homo."
00:25:59,00:26:02,And the entry on tobacco says that excessive use
00:26:02,00:26:05,is capable of quotes drying up the brain
00:26:05,00:26:08,to a little black lump consisting of mere membranes.
00:26:08,00:26:09,(laughing)
00:26:09,00:26:11,"- They should put that on cigarette packets, shouldn't they?"
00:26:11,00:26:13,- Yeah. (laughing)
00:26:13,00:26:15,"- There was a book, you know in the OED,"
00:26:15,00:26:18,how you have sauces for each of the things.
00:26:18,00:26:21,"So it'll have, what was that word you just said?"
00:26:21,00:26:22,- Discubiline. - Discubiline.
00:26:22,00:26:24,"It would have discubiline,"
00:26:24,00:26:27,"and then it would have the sauce for where they found it,"
00:26:27,00:26:28,which book they found it in.
00:26:28,00:26:30,"There are 51 words in the OED,"
00:26:30,00:26:33,"which have the sauce, ""Meandering's of Memory"""
00:26:33,00:26:34,by someone called Nightlark.
00:26:34,00:26:37,And no one knows what that book is.
00:26:37,00:26:39,- Oh. - Did they know who Nightlark is?
00:26:39,00:26:40,- No. - That's great.
00:26:40,00:26:45,"- Just very quickly on this idea of the mysterious book,"
00:26:45,00:26:50,"yeah, I read this story when I was looking into stuff"
00:26:50,00:26:53,about posting yourself across the country.
00:26:53,00:26:56,"In 1976, so starting in 1976,"
00:26:56,00:26:59,"residents in a small town called Circleville in Ohio,"
00:26:59,00:27:04,"population 13,000, they all started receiving"
00:27:04,00:27:08,"these letters, accusing them of various misdeeds,"
00:27:08,00:27:09,and the letters were just anonymous.
00:27:09,00:27:12,"No one knew, but everyone in the town was getting them."
00:27:12,00:27:14,- Wow. - And they had theories
00:27:14,00:27:15,to who was sending them.
00:27:15,00:27:20,"There was a theory that it was a writer called Ron Giuseppe,"
00:27:20,00:27:23,"who was writing them, but then he mysteriously died."
00:27:23,00:27:27,"But the letters continued coming to them until the 1990s,"
00:27:27,00:27:27,and then they just stopped.
00:27:27,00:27:30,"- It's a bit like, I know what you did last summer."
00:27:30,00:27:31,"- Yeah. - And I know what you did last summer,"
00:27:31,00:27:33,and I know what you did last summer.
00:27:33,00:27:34,- I don't know what they did last summer.
00:27:34,00:27:36,I've never seen it.
00:27:36,00:27:38,- Oh. - They killed someone with a car.
00:27:38,00:27:39,- Spoiler alert.
00:27:39,00:27:41,(all laughing)
00:27:42,00:27:44,"- So bringing it back to Wales,"
00:27:44,00:27:47,it does at least get the chance to laugh in our faces
00:27:47,00:27:50,"when we cook up, which we often do where Wales is concerned."
00:27:50,00:27:53,"So street signs are a quite a famous example, aren't they?"
00:27:53,00:27:57,There was that sign that went up in Wales a couple of years ago.
00:27:57,00:27:58,"So there was the English above,"
00:27:58,00:28:00,"which said something like, take the next left"
00:28:00,00:28:01,"if you want to get to X place,"
00:28:01,00:28:04,"and then the translation in Welsh below actually translated as,"
00:28:04,00:28:06,"""I am not in the office at the moment,"
00:28:06,00:28:08,"send any work to be translated."""
00:28:08,00:28:10,(all laughing)
00:28:10,00:28:13,- There's a sign between Cardiff and Penarth that tells cyclists
00:28:13,00:28:16,that they've got a problem with an inflamed bladder.
00:28:16,00:28:18,That's what the translation is.
00:28:18,00:28:21,And there's a sign for pedestrians in Cardiff
00:28:21,00:28:23,"that reads, ""Look right in English."""
00:28:23,00:28:26,"And the Welsh translation below is, ""Look left."""
00:28:26,00:28:28,(all laughing)
00:28:28,00:28:30,"- Okay, that's it."
00:28:30,00:28:31,That's the end of our show.
00:28:31,00:28:32,Those are all of our facts.
00:28:32,00:28:33,Thanks everyone for listening.
00:28:33,00:28:36,If you want to get in contact and talk more about the stuff
00:28:36,00:28:37,"that we've been mentioning on this podcast,"
00:28:37,00:28:41,"you can get Andy on @AndrewHunterM, James."
00:28:41,00:28:42,- @egshaped.
00:28:42,00:28:43,- Anna.
00:28:43,00:28:45,- You can email podcast@QI.com.
00:28:45,00:28:48,- And if you want to get through to me to save me
00:28:48,00:28:51,"from being fired for all of my missbacks,"
00:28:51,00:28:53,and want to help me out on the idea that maybe camels
00:28:53,00:28:56,"do vomit up stuff that we can then re-eat,"
00:28:56,00:28:59,that bubbles are taken out of sparkling water
00:28:59,00:29:01,and reintroduced into the bottle
00:29:01,00:29:03,on the other side of the journey.
00:29:03,00:29:06,I can be gone on @Shryberland.
00:29:06,00:29:08,You can also go to qi.com/podcast
00:29:08,00:29:10,where we're gonna have all of the facts
00:29:10,00:29:12,that we've been talking about as well as links
00:29:12,00:29:15,"to further research, to extra videos and pictures"
00:29:15,00:29:17,of that giant trampoline and so on.
00:29:17,00:29:20,And we've also got all the other episodes that we've done.
00:29:20,00:29:22,And you can explore those pages as well.
00:29:22,00:29:23,We'll be back again next week.
00:29:23,00:29:24,Goodbye.
00:29:24,00:29:27,(upbeat music)
00:29:27,00:29:30,"- Just to add a post podcast addendum to that,"
00:29:30,00:29:33,"Dan and Andy are currently absent from the QI offices,"
00:29:33,00:29:36,both performing shows in Edinburgh.
00:29:36,00:29:38,"They've got two shows each,"
00:29:38,00:29:42,"so Andy's got ostentatious and fully adur,"
00:29:42,00:29:44,so obviously go to both of those multiple times
00:29:44,00:29:46,"if you're listening, and Dan will be performing"
00:29:46,00:29:49,"his stand-up cock-blocked from outer space,"
00:29:49,00:29:52,"and he's also gonna be in the Museum of Curiosity,"
00:29:52,00:29:54,which is doing live shows at Edinburgh.
00:29:54,00:29:56,So anyone who's anywhere near there
00:29:56,00:29:59,"should definitely go to see them, apparently there."
00:29:59,00:30:01,Apparently they're quite funny.
00:30:01,00:30:04,"And if you'd like to buy any ham, please go to"
00:30:04,00:30:08,Mr. Fellas' Humshop in Oxford.
00:30:08,00:30:09,Do.
00:30:09,00:30:11,Best time in the country and the oldest.
