00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:19,560
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

3
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,680
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covenant Garden.

4
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,980
 My name is Dan Schlieber.

5
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:29,600
 I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, Anichezinski and James Harkin, and once again we

6
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,360
 have gathered around the microphones of our four favourite facts from the last seven

7
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,200
 days, and in no particular order, here we go.

8
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,200
 Starting with you, Anna.

9
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,880
 My fact this week is that travelling salesmen used to carry around miniature versions of

10
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,680
 everything they were selling.

11
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:47,680
 Right.

12
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,680
 Such an amazing fact.

13
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,080
 It is so cool.

14
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,080
 So I found this.

15
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:55,120
 I don't know how I ended up on this site, but I was on Tim's antique site.

16
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:01,520
 Tim's very well-respected antique stealers, and they had an article which was titled, "What

17
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,920
 is miniature furniture?"

18
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,440
 And it started by saying this question has been asked time and time again for Tim and

19
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,440
 Tim again.

20
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:17,120
 Tim's and Tim's again, and it says there's a whole myriad of answers, but we're here

21
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,840
 to answer definitively, and they said, "The vast majority of miniature furniture that

22
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:25,080
 you see in antique places was carried around by travelling salesmen because if you

23
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,840
 are going around the country, you're going to be away for weeks and weeks away from your

24
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,060
 workshop, then obviously it's a hassle to take all the full-size stuff with you."

25
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:36,120
 So they made up tiny samples, but perfectly sculpted samples.

26
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:40,500
 So incredibly good quality, you know, with the proper materials, well, but together samples.

27
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,920
 But there were so many different things they tried this way.

28
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:47,520
 So there are amazing pages online of, there's a great website called Collectors Weekly,

29
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,840
 which has a load of samples.

30
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,840
 It's so good.

31
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:56,040
 There were stoves, there were mini stoves and sewing machines and telephones, coffins.

32
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,040
 You can, I found on eBay in America, there's one going at the moment.

33
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,280
 It's eight inches long, it's selling for a few hundred dollars, and it's a travelling

34
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,280
 salesman's coffin.

35
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,280
 Oh, okay.

36
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,880
 As in a, it's a proper antique travelling salesman, yeah, yeah, yeah.

37
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,880
 Yeah, exactly.

38
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,680
 Have you seen the stuff that undertakers would take with them?

39
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,800
 Because it was not only, they'd have a briefcase full of miniature coffins, but you can also

40
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,720
 get, as antiques, their briefcase of a graveyard plot.

41
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:24,720
 And again, if you go online, you open up the briefcase and it's proper fake grass around

42
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,720
 it.

43
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:29,200
 And then it's got the grave stone as they would suggest that they'll make up your grave

44
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,200
 so you wouldn't die.

45
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,200
 Wow.

46
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,200
 That's so cool.

47
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:36,160
 And is there a sort of a, a horse and you roleplay the whole event?

48
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,160
 I don't know.

49
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,160
 Maybe they did.

50
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,720
 I didn't see any briefcases with the miniature horse in them.

51
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:47,040
 You could in the late 19th century by miniature step ladders and ironing boards.

52
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:52,040
 And this was from a guy called Holy Kirk Christianson in Denmark.

53
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:56,320
 And he had a woodworking company and he was making these step ladders and ironing boards.

54
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:59,680
 But then he thought, you know what, I prefer making these little things and making the big

55
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,680
 things.

56
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,200
 Why don't I start a company where I make lots of little things and he started the Lego

57
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,200
 company?

58
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,200
 No.

59
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,200
 Isn't that cool?

60
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,200
 That's very cool.

61
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,040
 He started off making miniature things with travelling salesmen and then he became a Lego

62
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,040
 guy.

63
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,040
 That's so cool.

64
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,040
 That is amazing.

65
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,520
 So these don't, because there were a lot of sort of miniature version tallies back in history,

66
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:23,040
 kind of like, I guess, how Lego came out, miniature gilletines from the French Revolution.

67
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,040
 Yeah.

68
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,680
 This is during the French Revolution.

69
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,760
 They used to sell them for kids to play with and with, and you sold dolls with it.

70
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,760
 You sold dolls with them?

71
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,760
 You would chop your dolls head off.

72
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,760
 No.

73
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,760
 Yes.

74
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,160
 But if you don't have it, if you're too poor to afford the dolls, you can just put your

75
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,160
 fingers through it.

76
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,160
 It makes you kind of finger-puff it.

77
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,920
 You did use to get those gilletines that you put your fingers in, didn't you?

78
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,240
 Like in a magic set and stuff.

79
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,240
 Yeah.

80
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,240
 And then it looks like you're going to chop them off and you don't actually chop them off.

81
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,240
 Yeah.

82
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:51,600
 Imagine if one in every ten gilletines was one of those and so it means that some people

83
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,600
 get away from their crimes.

84
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,600
 Like the opposite.

85
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,600
 On real gilletines.

86
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,600
 Yeah.

87
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,600
 That was really nice.

88
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,600
 Russian reprieve.

89
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,600
 Yeah.

90
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:03,160
 There was another reason for having miniature furniture that sometimes wasn't to show

91
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,920
 off your furniture and that was if it was practice furniture.

92
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,760
 So this is something if you're an antique dealer, you get good at distinguishing the proper

93
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,640
 miniatures from the apprentice pieces, so you can also buy them.

94
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,160
 And it's if you're auditioning an apprentice and then the craftsman would give the apprentice

95
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,400
 a really cheap, crappy piece of wood and say, "Make something awesome out of this."

96
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,400
 Completely understand.

97
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,240
 When you said practice furniture, I thought it was something you practiced sitting on.

98
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,440
 Oh, you got your real chair.

99
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,240
 You can't contrast it with a real chair.

100
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,240
 It's a cotton wool one.

101
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,080
 Would those apprentice pieces go out on the road as well?

102
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,080
 No.

103
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,080
 Ah, okay.

104
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,080
 No, they're just for the workshop.

105
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,080
 And then it kind of stopped, didn't it?

106
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,960
 Once we got photos, people just said round castle looks.

107
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,200
 Although you still get people selling things dorset, don't you?

108
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:50,040
 In 2010, in the UK, the dorset, dorset sales sector was officially valued at 4.7 billion

109
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:55,360
 a year in the UK, and that's only the legitimate things because people are obviously selling

110
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,960
 other things dorset, and in 2012, the number of complaints about dodgy dorset sales hit

111
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:06,840
 a record high with 35,000 complaints made, so people are still doing this all the time.

112
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:11,800
 I didn't know that you are technically a peddler, P-E-D-L-A-R.

113
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,560
 I didn't know that peddler was still a trade as in it's still properly termed, but you need

114
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,560
 a peddler's license to peddle.

115
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,560
 Because it's such an old fashioned term.

116
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,560
 Exactly, yeah.

117
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:26,000
 But you go to your local police authority and you tell them who you are, and you have to

118
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,440
 have lived in the area for a little while, I think, and it costs £12.25 to get a year's

119
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,440
 license peddling.

120
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,440
 Does it?

121
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,440
 Yeah.

122
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,440
 Wow.

123
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,960
 It just shows, like, obviously, what a common profession it was.

124
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:42,000
 How many synonyms there are for this job, so you could be a monger, obviously, and you could

125
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 be a solicitor.

126
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 That was an old word for it.

127
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 It was a lawyer.

128
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 A cost of monger.

129
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 You don't want to confuse those, though.

130
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 I don't.

131
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 My solicitor will be here in a minute.

132
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,200
 I'll be back soon with a load of dishcloths.

133
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,200
 (LAUGHTER)

134
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,200
 The tiny little judges chair.

135
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,200
 Yeah.

136
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:04,240
 Just to see what you're saying before monger, like, because obviously you have fish mongers

137
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,280
 and cuss mongers and all that kind of stuff.

138
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,160
 Would they dot-dot things, or is that just a seller of things, or what?

139
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:14,080
 I think it was a seller of things, but then it would often, like you say, the mongers coming

140
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,480
 down the street now.

141
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,480
 Cool.

142
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:20,480
 I've never heard it on its own without some kind of noun before it.

143
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,480
 No.

144
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,480
 Well, you don't mong nothing.

145
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,600
 So that's why it's often proceeded with the thing you're monging.

146
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,200
 What do you do if you sell mong beans?

147
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,200
 (LAUGHTER)

148
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,200
 A mong monger.

149
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,200
 A mong monger.

150
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,200
 A monger.

151
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,000
 Oh, that mong monger's a real monger.

152
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 (LAUGHTER)

153
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,960
 But yeah, you had, so in the, in the olden days, there are some peddlers that you don't

154
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,960
 have as much today.

155
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,960
 You had the tooth puller, and that was quite common.

156
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,360
 You'd have the tooth pullers who'd come around and bang on your door to pull your teeth

157
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,360
 out.

158
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,360
 Okay.

159
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,360
 Or wouldn't get off the horse.

160
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,360
 Would they tie your tooth to the door?

161
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,160
 Well, that's what you do, wouldn't you?

162
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,360
 You would tie your tooth to the door, and then when they open the door, they pull your

163
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,360
 tooth out.

164
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,360
 (LAUGHTER)

165
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,360
 You don't have to pay them anymore.

166
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,360
 (LAUGHTER)

167
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,360
 So you don't open the door until they've said who they are.

168
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,360
 They say it's the tooth puller, and you go, "Hang on a sec."

169
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,360
 (LAUGHTER)

170
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,280
 I think they tied it to the horse, because it just, it's just a specific that they don't

171
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,280
 get off their horse.

172
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,280
 It's quite a lot.

173
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,280
 So I imagine maybe they tie it to the reins of the horse and gallop away, or something?

174
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,280
 No.

175
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,280
 Come on.

176
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,040
 And then it's like galloping off of you still attached to it, like you're a just married

177
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,040
 car or something.

178
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,040
 (LAUGHTER)

179
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,240
 It's not as wobbly as I thought.

180
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,240
 (LAUGHTER)

181
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,640
 The tooth pullers, as well as being tooth pullers, were often travelling dentists.

182
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:31,320
 And you can also get some of the dentist kits, so they would have a whole selection of teeth.

183
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:35,520
 And because it was the 19th century, the teeth would be graded from sort of just light yellow

184
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,280
 to very dark, brownish, black.

185
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,880
 And they'd come to replace your teeth, so they'd open their briefcase and be like, "Hey,

186
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,880
 which do you want?"

187
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,880
 And you'd say, "Oh, that nice yellow one."

188
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,960
 And they'd say, "Mmm, I think, maybe more."

189
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,960
 Maybe she looks colour-chart, but...

190
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,960
 Yeah.

191
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:48,960
 Well, all the colours are just...

192
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,960
 (LAUGHTER)

193
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:57,960
 So, one famous travelling salesman of history was Jeremy Clarkson's dad, and he was

194
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,960
 famous, was he?

195
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,600
 Well, he is now, I would say, as the father of Jeremy Clarkson.

196
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,600
 Okay.

197
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:08,000
 But Jeremy Clarkson's dad, in fact, I think his parents, they specialised in selling teacosies.

198
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,200
 Didn't they sell Paddington Bear or something?

199
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,200
 Yeah, they did.

200
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:16,240
 And Jeremy Clarkson's first job was going door to door, so...

201
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,240
 This Paddington Bear!

202
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,240
 (LAUGHTER)

203
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,240
 Exactly that.

204
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,840
 He was a travelling salesman, selling Paddington Bear.

205
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,840
 And teacosies.

206
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,480
 What do we have combination of things to be selling?

207
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,480
 I know.

208
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,720
 Do they have a range of stuff in between Paddington Bear and teacosies?

209
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,160
 There are sources on the line that say condoms, but that seems like such a strange third element

210
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,160
 to add to the mix.

211
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:37,080
 Well, all these says to me is they must have been woolen cognomps.

212
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,080
 Yeah.

213
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,320
 A teacosie for some people is a condom for others.

214
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,320
 (LAUGHTER)

215
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,320
 It was the slogan on their van.

216
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,320
 (LAUGHTER)

217
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,480
 I can't believe that you would have a firm selling teacosies Paddington Bear or condoms,

218
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,480
 because it's two...

219
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,480
 One of them is too sexy.

220
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,480
 Yeah.

221
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,480
 Smaller condoms.

222
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,480
 (LAUGHTER)

223
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,960
 Some stuff on small things, very quickly.

224
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,960
 Oh, yeah.

225
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:05,960
 So, this year, in fact last year, there was the world's biggest ever historical tabletop

226
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,960
 war game.

227
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,960
 Cool.

228
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,520
 So, do you know what I mean by that, because then you look confused.

229
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,520
 Yeah, so...

230
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:15,280
 I don't think either of them knows, because they both said the word cool after what you said.

231
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,280
 So...

232
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,280
 Was it recreating a real battle?

233
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,520
 It's recreating a real battle with little soldiers.

234
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,560
 It's kind of like poor hammer, basically.

235
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:25,200
 Like that, not with orcs, with actual people.

236
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,200
 Boring.

237
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,200
 (LAUGHTER)

238
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:32,760
 So, there was more than 20,000 miniature soldiers, and it was at the University of Glasgow and

239
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:39,600
 they replayed the Battle of Waterloo on a 192 square metre historical map.

240
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,400
 And it took them a year to paint all the soldiers, this group of over 100 people.

241
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:48,480
 They'd been investigating the archaeology of the Waterloo Battlefield since 2015.

242
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,480
 Wow.

243
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,480
 And then they did this game.

244
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:57,400
 And there were 4,000 casualties in the battle, and the Allies won.

245
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,400
 Because it wasn't definite.

246
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,240
 They were going to do it properly, like a proper game, and it could have been that Napoleon

247
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,240
 would have won it.

248
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,240
 Oh.

249
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,640
 But the Allies won.

250
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:09,360
 And at one stage, the Duke of Wellington in the battle had a traffic cone on his head.

251
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,360
 (LAUGHTER)

252
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:14,280
 Because in Glasgow, which is where it was, famously, there's a statue there where they

253
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,960
 always put a traffic cone on them.

254
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,960
 That's so funny.

255
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,960
 That's so cool.

256
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:21,280
 Yeah, although that bit not historically accurate, right?

257
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,280
 Oh.

258
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,160
 I'm not sure they even had traffic cones.

259
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,160
 No.

260
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,160
 They've misread tricorn.

261
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,160
 It's been misplaced.

262
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,160
 They've come right on the way.

263
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,160
 (LAUGHTER)

264
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,160
 And do you know who invented, sorry, just while I'm on the subject.

265
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,800
 Do you know who invented the first set of rules for playing with toy soldiers?

266
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,800
 Ooh.

267
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,120
 Is there someone we would have heard of?

268
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,120
 Yes.

269
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,600
 Jeremy Clarkson's dad, isn't it?

270
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,920
 It's not, though.

271
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,920
 It's his mum.

272
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,920
 No, it's not.

273
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,560
 He's the novelist H.G. Wells.

274
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,560
 What?

275
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,960
 He did that yet.

276
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:51,600
 In 1913, he wrote a book called Little Wars, which had the first ever set of rules for

277
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,680
 playing with toy soldiers.

278
00:10:53,680 --> 00:11:00,960
 And the full title of the book was Little Wars, a game for boys from 12 years of age to 150.

279
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:05,360
 And for that more intelligent sort of girl who likes boys, games and books.

280
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,360
 (LAUGHTER)

281
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,760
 I've never met such a woman.

282
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:17,200
 OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is Andy.

283
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,640
 My fact is, that female grizzly bears can get half pregnant.

284
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,640
 Mm-hmm.

285
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,640
 Mm-hmm.

286
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,640
 Intriguing.

287
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,640
 What does that mean?

288
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:32,600
 It means they get pregnant, or they are fertilised, they're exorfertilised by a male during

289
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,600
 mating.

290
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,200
 And then they don't do anything about it.

291
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,200
 Several months.

292
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,200
 OK.

293
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,200
 Lazy.

294
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:44,880
 The egg is fertilised, and it turns into this tiny bundle of cells called a blastocyst.

295
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,880
 And that's normal.

296
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,960
 We have those, too.

297
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:52,200
 But in almost all mammals, that then develops into an embryo.

298
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:56,880
 But in bears, it just floats around in their uterus, doing absolutely nothing for months

299
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,480
 on end.

300
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,640
 And then the bears put on weight for winter, because they need to hibernate.

301
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,200
 They see how much weight they gain.

302
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:10,520
 And if they're up to the right level of body fat by the autumn, if they're 24% body fat,

303
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:13,800
 they will go to their den for winter, and the blastocyst will implant into the wall of

304
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,000
 their womb, and then it will develop into a cub.

305
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,160
 But if they're not, it just gets reabsorbed into the body of the female.

306
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,160
 Right.

307
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,320
 So they have this weird internal barometer of how well they're doing in terms of putting

308
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,320
 on weight for winter.

309
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,320
 Oh, my God.

310
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,320
 Have you seen the pictures?

311
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:31,000
 Are these specific pictures actually published by Katmai National Park in Alaska?

312
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 Is it Katmai?

313
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 K-A-T-M-A-I?

314
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,680
 That's how I would pronounce it, but we've never pronounced anything right on this show,

315
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,240
 so don't break a tradition there.

316
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:46,000
 So there are photos published by this National Park in Alaska, where the public votes every

317
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,040
 year on which bear wins the fastest, the best fattening bear, and you have to check it out,

318
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,840
 because they have these photos on their site of every bear in their National Park.

319
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:59,680
 And if you move this slider along the pictures, you can see the before and after, and it's

320
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,720
 only in the course of two months, and it is incredible.

321
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,720
 That's so cool.

322
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,840
 And it's like the opposite of fat shaming, isn't it?

323
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,840
 Exactly.

324
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,840
 Yeah.

325
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,200
 It's like they're going to a weight watchers meeting every week, and they've put on an extra

326
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,600
 free stone, and they're just getting applauded.

327
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:17,400
 And it is a huge amount they eat, and a huge amount they put on, so it's called Hyperfagia,

328
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:23,200
 wouldn't they just eat constantly for a while, and they gain about two stone per week.

329
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,840
 And so it's really fun to do.

330
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,720
 I spent most of my research scrolling back and forth in these photos.

331
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,720
 Yeah.

332
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,640
 It's interesting, with pregnancy and bears, I was reading about it zoos in America, polar bears,

333
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,840
 the polar bears that they have there, they don't know how to tell if they're pregnant.

334
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:41,920
 It's really hard to tell if a bear is pregnant, because they often have pseudo pregnancy,

335
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,680
 so it looks like they're pregnant.

336
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:48,960
 They have the hormones that show up in labs that say they're pregnant, but they're not.

337
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,800
 It just, it matches the same thing.

338
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,280
 So do you know how they find out if they have a pregnant polar bear?

339
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,280
 Oh no.

340
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:59,440
 But they just wait and see if a baby comes out. They often do, but that's not useful for them,

341
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,120
 because when it comes out, if none come out, then they're like, damn it, we need our breeding

342
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,120
 program to be better.

343
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,120
 Okay.

344
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,200
 They put them in a CT scanner.

345
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,200
 No.

346
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,360
 Oh, wouldn't that be exciting to see?

347
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,600
 They take some urine samples and they get, no, because he said the hormones is the same.

348
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,600
 Yeah.

349
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,280
 They squeeze, they run in very quickly, and they squeeze the middle of the bear, and then

350
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,880
 they run out before it tears them into.

351
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,880
 No.

352
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,880
 No.

353
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,800
 They send their poo to a dog called Elvis.

354
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,960
 Now, who's poo?

355
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,960
 They're the polar bears.

356
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,960
 All right.

357
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,960
 Okay.

358
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,960
 What?

359
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:40,040
 They send the poo to this dog called Elvis, who has a 90% rate of saying whether or not

360
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,040
 they're pregnant or not.

361
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,680
 I can't believe with every time.

362
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,680
 I know.

363
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,680
 What?

364
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,680
 Yeah.

365
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,680
 So this...

366
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,680
 How do they...

367
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,920
 They try to find out that Elvis can do that.

368
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:54,480
 They train this dog, Elvis, with another dog, and they kept, they gave them 200 samples to

369
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,760
 see whether they could break down.

370
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,920
 So there's more than 2,000 proteins in polar bear fecal samples, five are consistent with pregnancy,

371
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,440
 and that's what he was smelling out.

372
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,440
 And 90 has a 90...

373
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,440
 It's just one dog.

374
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,440
 This is not what the dog can do.

375
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,160
 The other dog just guessed it at some points, just faked it, just went, "Yup."

376
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,840
 And because they needed a reward or whatever, so they kicked him out of the system.

377
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,720
 It is just Elvis that they send it to.

378
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,720
 Oh, my goodness.

379
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,720
 Yeah.

380
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,720
 But yeah, that's what they have to do.

381
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,720
 One dog is helping them out.

382
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,720
 Elvis.

383
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,720
 Well done, Elvis.

384
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,720
 Yeah, amazing.

385
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,720
 Here are a dog.

386
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,640
 Do you say in how most mammals don't do this thing?

387
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:29,920
 It was called embryonic diapos, isn't it?

388
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,440
 Rodants do, quite a few of them bears do, as we know.

389
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:36,640
 Armadillos do weasels, badges, and kangaroos all do.

390
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:42,240
 And some people think that maybe humans do on a small level.

391
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:47,520
 So there have been a few case studies where women have had in vitro fertilization and then

392
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:52,120
 found out that they were pregnant more than a month later, like maybe two months later

393
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,320
 or stuff like that.

394
00:15:53,320 --> 00:16:00,120
 And they reckon it might be a very minor diapos that happens in humans, but still more research

395
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,120
 needed.

396
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,440
 It's a bit of a crap diapos, though, because it is only ever really a week or two weeks,

397
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,440
 maybe three.

398
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,480
 Whereas these bears can hold him for a year, can't they?

399
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,480
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

400
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,480
 Do you guys want to hear something mental?

401
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,480
 Yeah.

402
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,480
 Yeah.

403
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,480
 Okay.

404
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:18,560
 But sheep blasterists, these little bundles of cells, into the uteruses of mice.

405
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,560
 Okay.

406
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:23,800
 Now sheep can't do this diapos thing, they just can't do it, and mice can do it.

407
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:30,040
 And when these sheep blasterists were inserted into mouse uteruses, they went into pause mode.

408
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:33,440
 The mice were able to pause the blasterists of a different speed, okay?

409
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,440
 I'm not surprised.

410
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:38,040
 Ben, I mean, why is this stressful?

411
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,000
 Stressful situation for a mouse.

412
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,960
 It's a difficult birth, isn't it?

413
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:48,280
 But then they were removed, these blasterists, okay, after the mice paused them, and then they

414
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:55,560
 were put back into sort of, you know, petri-dished, you know, fertilisation, whatever, sort of artificial

415
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,040
 thing with sheep, and they grew into normal lambs.

416
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,040
 Right.

417
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,040
 So they were not inside the sheep?

418
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,040
 They're not back in the sheep.

419
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,720
 They were, I think they were put back in the sheep or put back in the test tube or whatever.

420
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:09,960
 They were grown into, they grew into normal lambs, having been in a mouse's uterus.

421
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,960
 Wow.

422
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,800
 I think it's pretty tasteless that you won't differentiate between a test tube and a

423
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,800
 sheep mate.

424
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,800
 [laughter]

425
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,800
 Bears or pregnancy?

426
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,520
 Let's go bears.

427
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,520
 Bear?

428
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,880
 Some brown bears have oral sex.

429
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,960
 Oh, yeah, okay, okay.

430
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,360
 So this is, this is in a zoo in Croatia.

431
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,360
 It's been noticed.

432
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,360
 They're both males.

433
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:37,360
 Over 116 hours of observation, these two males did it 28 times in 116 hours, once every

434
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,000
 four hours, over several days, impressive.

435
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 Oh, really?

436
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 Yeah.

437
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,760
 Official study on the matter has said it might have been because they've been deprived of

438
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:50,280
 suckling, and that the provider may have found a substitute for teatsucking that also resulted

439
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,360
 in a letdown of substitute milk.

440
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,360
 Right.

441
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,360
 [laughter]

442
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,360
 Right.

443
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,360
 [laughter]

444
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,360
 Oh, what a weirdism.

445
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,360
 Wow.

446
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,360
 For that process.

447
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,560
 Be a ward for the most disturbing factor of the year.

448
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,560
 [laughter]

449
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,560
 Good.

450
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:08,760
 Do you suffer from premature letdown of substitute milk?

451
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,760
 [laughter]

452
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:14,680
 I think that was presented in a safer work away as I could manage it.

453
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,680
 Oh, it was very good.

454
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,680
 Yeah, you did well.

455
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:20,200
 Well, maybe humans could learn from that, because...

456
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:25,880
 Maybe you should be taking lessons from that.

457
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,400
 This is why you're milk peddling.

458
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,400
 [laughter]

459
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,400
 I'm sorry.

460
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,400
 Don't have any of the milk.

461
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,400
 Will you take my substitute?

462
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,400
 [laughter]

463
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,280
 So we can learn some stuff from bears, though, if not that.

464
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:44,880
 We can learn a lot from their hibernation period, right, or their topper that they go into,

465
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,200
 so they are enormously fat, as we've said, when they'll go into this topper, and they'll

466
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,320
 dig their dens, and they'll just lie there, and they don't get...

467
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,840
 So there's lots of stuff that we think we should look into to find out why they don't

468
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:59,080
 get, for instance, muscle and bone deterioration.

469
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:02,320
 So if people are in hospital, let's say you're in a coma, or you're confined to hospital

470
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:07,200
 for months on end, you get terrible muscle wastage and bone wastage, and you get bedsoars,

471
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,040
 and they don't really get any of that.

472
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:12,120
 And also, they remain quite alert.

473
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:15,840
 So I think when animals properly hibernate, then you really can't wait them up.

474
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,160
 This is a good thing to be aware of with grizzly bears, actually.

475
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,840
 They will wake up as soon as you go anywhere near them, if they're in hibernation, and they

476
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,320
 can suddenly snap out of it and go for you.

477
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:32,160
 So I think people were studying grizzly bears, and they said, "I'm just thinking that

478
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,520
 the worst way that a grizzly bear can go for you is if it's not been suckly very well."

479
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:44,240
 They'll go for any part of you that's nearest, to be honest, but they did a...

480
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,240
 Oh my god.

481
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,440
 Well, no, just imagine that scenario happening.

482
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:54,360
 You've got your life, but you've got to walk back to camp, and they say, "How did you survive?

483
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,480
 You won't believe this, guys.

484
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,800
 I just got sucked out by a grizzly bear."

485
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,800
 Oh my god.

486
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:03,200
 I took 12 hours, 28 times.

487
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:08,040
 Poor thing, wanted to go back to sleep.

488
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,760
 Oh my god.

489
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,760
 Disgusting.

490
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,800
 Oh my god.

491
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:21,800
 I've got Disgusting Bear Story, just a match for Disgusting Bear Story.

492
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:27,080
 I found this really odd account from the 1700s, so there was a clergyman from court

493
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,480
 called Arthur O'Leary.

494
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:34,420
 And he was in Northern France, and he saw a dancing bear.

495
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,560
 And this was an incredible dancing bear.

496
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,560
 Everyone was talking about how amazing it was.

497
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:42,160
 It could sort of count in numbers by putting its paw on the ground.

498
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,840
 It would nod to gentleman.

499
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,760
 It just did all these sort of really graceful things, and this guy was thinking, "How is

500
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,760
 this possible?"

501
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:53,680
 Then the giveaway happened when the bear suddenly yelled out, "The devil take him.

502
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,560
 The guy has me persecuted."

503
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:59,000
 And it turned out what happened, and he yelled that in Irish, so this guy understood

504
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,720
 because he was from court.

505
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:08,480
 It turns out that a man had been washed up in France, and sewn into a bear suit of a real

506
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:13,480
 bear, and was made to perform, and was stuck inside, and that was his moment to get out.

507
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:17,080
 I don't know if he knew an Irishman was there, who'd understand his language, but yeah.

508
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:20,240
 This is the call from the mid-1980s.

509
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,240
 Yeah, this is amazing.

510
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,040
 Why did he wait so long to do it?

511
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:26,880
 Even if you don't understand Irish, you know if you're a human voice coming out of a bear

512
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,880
 that's something weird going on.

513
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,480
 Oh, it's just, you know, it was a dancing bear.

514
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,960
 They thought this was a very talented bear.

515
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,920
 But if you're spelling stuff out on the ground, you could spell out help.

516
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,920
 I am an Irishman.

517
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:38,960
 You're washed up on the beat, but you're, I mean, if you're French, you might not speak Irish.

518
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,960
 That's true.

519
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:44,560
 I guess my point is, I still don't think Irish sounded to French people like the growl

520
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,560
 of a bear.

521
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:48,560
 Yeah, I think if he just shouted something.

522
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:52,560
 Yeah, you probably pick up words from the people around you.

523
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,560
 Yeah, exactly.

524
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,560
 Bonjour!

525
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,560
 Bonjour!

526
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:58,280
 That is quite a story.

527
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,800
 It's bizarre, which I do not believe.

528
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,800
 Yeah.

529
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,800
 Neither do I.

530
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,800
 It's out there.

531
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,800
 Really good.

532
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,680
 And so just one or two things on pregnancy, maybe?

533
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,680
 Oh, yeah, cool.

534
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:10,080
 Um, do you guys think it's possible to get pregnant via a bullet?

535
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,800
 Um, there is.

536
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,120
 I've heard that, but it must be a myth.

537
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:18,400
 So there's a Civil War article, just out of the Civil War, American medical journal.

538
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,840
 There was a proper entry from a doctor called, um, Legand Capers.

539
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,720
 And he had been... Sorry, he was called Legand Capers.

540
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,720
 Oh, yeah.

541
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,720
 I guess he was.

542
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,720
 Legand got a weird name.

543
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,720
 He was treating a soldier.

544
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,720
 Yeah.

545
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,640
 He was a soldier who'd been shot in the Civil War, in a skirmish.

546
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,680
 And his testicle had been shot off, very, very painful, obviously.

547
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:41,040
 The doctor treated him as quickly as possible, dressed the wound.

548
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:44,960
 And then was immediately approached by a woman who said, oh, my daughter has been very badly

549
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,960
 wounded.

550
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,480
 A stray bullet had hit her in the abdominal cavity, right?

551
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,200
 Unfortunately, he didn't have time to treat her properly and the army was fleeing.

552
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:57,080
 So he left seven months later he returned and the woman was very heavily pregnant.

553
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,080
 Wow.

554
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:06,320
 The baby was born a little while later and the doctor observed that after the baby boy was

555
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:10,840
 born, inside the testicles of the baby boy was a bullet.

556
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,840
 Oh, man.

557
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,840
 What?

558
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,840
 This has, like, a pen and teller.

559
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,840
 What is it?

560
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:18,680
 And it was written the name of the very doctor.

561
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:28,800
 It was a hoax article.

562
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:34,040
 That's how the legend kind of entered the street, that's the first example of that story.

563
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,040
 Right.

564
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,040
 That is.

565
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,800
 I can't remember who made it up now.

566
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,280
 I was too involved in the story.

567
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:45,240
 The doctor, Legged, Legged, Legged and his capers.

568
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:51,120
 OK, it is time for fact number three and that is James.

569
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:58,080
 OK, my fact is that when the vandal sacked Rome in 455 AD, they agreed that they would just

570
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,520
 take the money and not damage any of the property.

571
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,520
 Sorry, funny.

572
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,520
 So.

573
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,520
 The vandal.

574
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,520
 Well, this is what I'm trying to do.

575
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,480
 I'm trying to rescue the reputation of the vandals.

576
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,480
 OK.

577
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:13,080
 And it is a little bit controversial because it obviously happened a long, long time ago and

578
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:17,560
 a lot of people who were writing about it were Roman, who wanted to say bad things about

579
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:24,400
 the vandals, but it does seem that the reputation that we have given the vandals for being vandals

580
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,800
 might not be fair.

581
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:32,160
 And actually, during this sack of Rome, they'd done a deal with Leo I, who was the Pope at

582
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,160
 the time.

583
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:38,400
 And he said, OK, you can come here because obviously we can't really defend ourselves, so you

584
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,400
 can come over.

585
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:43,560
 If you do, please leave all of our churches and all of our buildings intact, we'll give

586
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:47,560
 you the money, we'll give you the jewels, we'll give you the gold and silver, but please

587
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,560
 don't do that.

588
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:53,800
 And it seems for the most part, although there was a few deaths and they did take a few

589
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,800
 people as slaves.

590
00:24:54,800 --> 00:25:00,440
 For the most part, as far as pre-medieval sacks go, this was actually not one of the worst

591
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,440
 ones.

592
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,800
 But they did steal shed loads, right?

593
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:07,520
 Why don't we just use vandalism to mean stealing all the stuff somewhere and kidnapping

594
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,520
 quite a few of the people?

595
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:11,840
 But we're just using vandalism to mean the wrong thing, the one thing they didn't do was smash

596
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,840
 anything up.

597
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,000
 Really convinced by James' thesis on this.

598
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,600
 I had no idea that the vandals were relatively nice guys, who they were all Christians.

599
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,600
 They were?

600
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,600
 Good Christian boys and girls.

601
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,600
 With it, they weren't nice.

602
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,520
 Well, they were good Christians, if you believe the other Christians who didn't believe

603
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:30,320
 the same Christian stuff as they believed in their Christian self, just got vandal stuff.

604
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,320
 That's not relevant.

605
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:37,480
 But they had been pushed out of their native lands by the Huns, and the vandals were just

606
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:42,000
 trying to get down to North Africa, which is where they settled and they took over Carthage.

607
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:48,120
 And Ibiza where they lived for 80 years, which I always think is quite a long car.

608
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:52,000
 But yeah, they eventually did move down and they lived in North Africa, and they were

609
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,520
 kind of happy there.

610
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:57,160
 But they were, because they had Carthage and they had a really good fleet, they were occasionally

611
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:02,400
 stealing from people and going on little forays and stuff.

612
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,640
 But then in Rome, there was also a dodgy stuff going on.

613
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:11,720
 So the Roman Emperor Valentinian III was murdered by Petronius Maximus, because they had a little

614
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,560
 bit of beef between them.

615
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:19,840
 And when Petronius Maximus took over, he forced Valentinians Widow to marry him and forced

616
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,760
 Valentinians daughter to marry his son.

617
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:28,160
 And Valentinians daughter was supposed to get married to the king of the vandals son.

618
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:31,600
 And so the king of the vandals said, well, you know what, if you're going to cancel that

619
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,800
 marriage, I'm going to cancel our deal.

620
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:37,220
 And I'm going to come over and I'm going to sack your city and that's what he did.

621
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:41,240
 And then Petronius tried to run away from the vandals, but he was stoned by his own people

622
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,240
 and thrown into the tibre.

623
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,240
 Nice.

624
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,240
 I think it's fair.

625
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,240
 I think it's completely fair.

626
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,240
 There was a deal.

627
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,240
 Petronius Maximus broke it.

628
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,280
 The vandals had every right to sack the city.

629
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,280
 Yeah.

630
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,280
 Yeah.

631
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,280
 It's very game of Thrones, isn't it?

632
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,280
 It really is.

633
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,280
 Yeah.

634
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,280
 Yeah.

635
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:55,280
 Yeah.

636
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:55,280
 Yeah.

637
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:55,280
 Yeah.

638
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:55,280
 Yeah.

639
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,280
 Yeah.

640
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:56,280
 Yeah.

641
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,280
 Yeah.

642
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:57,280
 Yeah.

643
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,280
 Yeah.

644
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,280
 Yeah.

645
00:26:59,280 --> 00:26:59,280
 Yeah.

646
00:26:59,280 --> 00:26:59,280
 Yeah.

647
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,280
 Yeah.

648
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,280
 Yeah.

649
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:01,280
 Yeah.

650
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:01,280
 Yeah.

651
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,280
 Yeah.

652
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,280
 Yeah.

653
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,620
 - It's not from the people they murdered.

654
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:06,900
 - Apart from the people they murdered and the temple they were dead.

655
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,140
 - It was literally just that they didn't break stuff.

656
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:08,980
 - Yeah, yeah.

657
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:12,540
 He was also the same Pope who talked supposedly,

658
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:16,300
 talked to Tilla the Hun out of actually coming to Rome at all.

659
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,340
 They sent him out, they knew Tilla was on the way,

660
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,780
 and he met up with them and he said,

661
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:20,620
 "Would you mind not coming?"

662
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:21,780
 And Tilla went, "Ah, okay."

663
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:25,900
 And went off, there's two times that he's responsible for.

664
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:26,740
 - Yeah, I'll give you some--

665
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:28,220
 - Don't feel like there's more to that story, isn't there?

666
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:30,580
 It feels like there must have been more to the conversation

667
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:31,620
 than that.

668
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:32,460
 - Yeah.

669
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:34,260
 - He's called a black male, a bribery.

670
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,580
 I think he came up and he said, "You okay, Hun?"

671
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:39,340
 (laughing)

672
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:41,540
 - He just burst into tears.

673
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:43,020
 I didn't want to hurt anyone.

674
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,180
 It's gone out of hand.

675
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:45,660
 - I didn't know about sacking.

676
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:48,100
 I don't know why he said sack places.

677
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:48,940
 Why you sack places.

678
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,260
 - Why do you sack places?

679
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:52,220
 - You put everything in sacks when you're running off.

680
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:53,060
 - Yes.

681
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:53,900
 - Is it?

682
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:57,100
 - Yeah, it's from, I looked this up in the OED,

683
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,060
 and it's from the Latin verb sacare,

684
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:01,020
 which means put it in a bag.

685
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,380
 - Nice, put it in a bag.

686
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:03,220
 - Yeah.

687
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:05,820
 - Nothing, not everything fits in the sack.

688
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:07,420
 - All right, all right, clever plugs.

689
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:08,260
 - Not just.

690
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:11,020
 - Yeah, I mean, they've got other things, right?

691
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,340
 - Maybe you've been using the miniature sacks

692
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:14,980
 that the old sacks have been using.

693
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:15,980
 (laughing)

694
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:19,780
 - And then being a vandal was actually a good thing

695
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,220
 for quite a while, okay?

696
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:24,660
 So people thought that the vandals were kind of cool,

697
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:27,580
 and a lot of royal families claimed dissent

698
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,900
 from the vandals.

699
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:31,500
 The Swedish and the Danish royal families, for instance,

700
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:34,500
 continue to do so until only about 30 years or so ago.

701
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,340
 - Wow.

702
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:39,620
 - But there was then a person called Henri Gregois,

703
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:41,620
 who was a Bishop of Bois.

704
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,940
 And he used, is that I pronounced that?

705
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:44,780
 - I pronounced that.

706
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:47,040
 (laughing)

707
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:53,260
 - He used the term in 1794 to describe the destruction

708
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:55,900
 of artwork following the French Revolution.

709
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,620
 And so that's when the word vandalism

710
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:00,460
 became to mean sort of wrecking things.

711
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:01,300
 - Really?

712
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,860
 - Yeah, he got obsessed with it, didn't he?

713
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:04,420
 - I read that there was no one to defend

714
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:07,060
 the good name of the vandals, because at the time,

715
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:09,020
 there wasn't a geographical region,

716
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:12,020
 which was claiming dissent from them.

717
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,420
 Well, certainly not in that bit of France anyway.

718
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:14,860
 - Yeah, no, hadn't been for some time.

719
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:17,020
 But I mean, because they were quite crap in the end,

720
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:18,180
 and they didn't last very long.

721
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:20,700
 And actually, they should be grateful for De Bluah,

722
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,740
 'cause otherwise we wouldn't remember them at all,

723
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:23,740
 I don't think.

724
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,820
 They pretty much lasted 100 years,

725
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:27,740
 sort of fanning around in Carthagin,

726
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:29,580
 bits of North Africa, and the Iberian Peninsula.

727
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:30,420
 - Very often.

728
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:32,660
 - Peace loving people.

729
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,940
 - They were not a peace loving people.

730
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,460
 - They were reasonably peace.

731
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:39,260
 - I read it account where they butchered people up

732
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:41,420
 into tiny little pieces of meat.

733
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:43,780
 - You were judging them by modern standards,

734
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:45,780
 which is not the way it works, okay?

735
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:46,620
 - That's fair enough.

736
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:47,780
 - They were all doing that in those days.

737
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,540
 - Exactly, thank you.

738
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:51,260
 - Do you know who their main eyes were?

739
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:52,420
 - No, no.

740
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:54,860
 - Who they were in coalition with was the Allens.

741
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,860
 It was the vandal for the Allens, yeah.

742
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,900
 So the vandal kingdom was actually the vandal

743
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,460
 than the Allen kingdom in.

744
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:05,420
 - One more thing about the vandal is that George III married

745
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:08,060
 Charlotte of Mecklenburg, Strelitz.

746
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:10,780
 And she claimed dissent from the vandals.

747
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:11,620
 She was one of those.

748
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:14,980
 So we briefly had a queen who was a vandal.

749
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:17,500
 And it was really trendy at the time.

750
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,940
 And so in the late 1700s, they were going to make

751
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:21,780
 a British colony in North America,

752
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:23,860
 which they were going to call Vandalia.

753
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:26,620
 And there are still places in America called Vandalia,

754
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:28,780
 including one city that was briefly the capital

755
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:30,620
 of Illinois.

756
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,780
 And sports teams from the University of Idaho

757
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:35,620
 are always called the vandals because of this trendy time

758
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:37,180
 when everyone was called vandals.

759
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,020
 - That's awesome.

760
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:38,980
 - It was really good.

761
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,620
 - Oh, they've left them mark.

762
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:41,460
 - Yeah.

763
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:42,700
 - Very odd way.

764
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:46,780
 Can I have one favorite vandal who was the last king.

765
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:49,340
 So the guy who snacked Rome was actually really good.

766
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:51,420
 He was geyseric and he was impressive.

767
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:53,500
 The last king was a guy called Gelemmer.

768
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,740
 And he spent his whole time running away from people

769
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:58,500
 who were trying to beat his armies and fleeing.

770
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,860
 And at one point, the only reason his life was saved was

771
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:03,140
 'cause it was always the Byzantins who were after him.

772
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,980
 At one point, the only reason his life was saved was

773
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:07,460
 because he was fleeing John the Armenian,

774
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:08,940
 who was ruler.

775
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,100
 - Where was he from?

776
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:12,420
 (all laughing)

777
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:15,500
 - So he's fleeing John the Armenian, who was gonna get him,

778
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:18,100
 but then poor John the Armenian ended up being accidentally

779
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:20,900
 killed by one of his own bodyguards who'd got pissed

780
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,940
 and was trying to shoot a bird with an arrow

781
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:24,940
 and accidentally got John instead.

782
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:25,780
 - Wow.

783
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:26,740
 - So Gelemmer escapes John.

784
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:28,300
 This is Gelemmer, Mr. Vandal.

785
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:31,180
 And he fled to Algeria and he didn't like Algeria

786
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,260
 because the diet was bad and they lived quite

787
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:35,220
 ascetic lives and he was used to luxury.

788
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:38,060
 So then the ruler of the Byzantins said,

789
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:39,020
 "Do you want a surrender then?

790
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:40,860
 "If you hate it there, surrender to me."

791
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:42,340
 And he sent a letter back saying,

792
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:43,860
 "No, I refused a surrender,

793
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:47,220
 "but please send me some bread, a sponge, and a liar."

794
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,380
 And he explained.

795
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,220
 (all laughing)

796
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:52,140
 - This is like a T-cosy or condom in a panning to men.

797
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:54,380
 (all laughing)

798
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:57,060
 - He was a distant ancestor of Clarkson.

799
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:58,100
 - When you say a lie,

800
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,660
 you don't mean someone who turns up saying,

801
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:01,340
 "I haven't brought a bread or a sponge."

802
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:03,620
 (all laughing)

803
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:06,460
 - What are you holding my idea back then?

804
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:08,100
 No, he said he wanted the bread to eat.

805
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,260
 He said he needed the sponge to wash his eyes

806
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,740
 'cause they were so swollen with tears

807
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:13,060
 'cause he was so unhappy.

808
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:15,100
 And he said he wanted the liar to play

809
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,020
 alongside a lament that he had composed

810
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,940
 about what a tough time he was having.

811
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:22,700
 And the leader of the Byzantins cried in sympathy

812
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,420
 and sent him all the stuff he wanted.

813
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:25,580
 - Oh, that's good.

814
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,420
 - Nice guy.

815
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:28,540
 - Now that is a peace-loving people,

816
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:29,820
 the Byzantine people.

817
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,740
 (all laughing)

818
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:32,980
 - Well, that was Rome, wasn't it?

819
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:36,420
 I didn't realize that Rome didn't really collapse

820
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:38,940
 until 1453 AD.

821
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:41,580
 But the Byzantines were the, is that the Eastern lot?

822
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:42,780
 And they called themselves the Romans.

823
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:45,540
 They did not see, they didn't say we are the Byzantine Empire

824
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:47,180
 and what a shame about Rome.

825
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:48,380
 They completely saw themselves

826
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:50,620
 as the continuation of the Roman Empire.

827
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:52,100
 They just happened to all be Christians

828
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,700
 and have moved with the times.

829
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,260
 - It's weird 'cause we called the Christians Romans

830
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,100
 for a bit.

831
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,780
 We just decided no, saw it.

832
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:58,940
 As in 'cause these guys have been Christians

833
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:00,140
 for a hundred years or so.

834
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:01,300
 - Yeah.

835
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:03,900
 - Everyone's calling everyone stupid things, are they?

836
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:04,900
 (all laughing)

837
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:07,980
 And everyone called everyone barbarians as well.

838
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:11,980
 So barbarian, the word barbarian comes from the Greeks

839
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:14,460
 used it to mean anyone who wasn't Greek, right.

840
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:16,500
 And they gave it the word because they thought

841
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,900
 that everyone who spoke something that wasn't Greek

842
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:26,900
 was just going, (imitating barbarian music)

843
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:30,340
 and so then the Romans called all of the Germanic tribes

844
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:32,980
 barbarians, but actually the Romans were barbarians as well,

845
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:34,740
 according to the Greeks.

846
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:35,740
 - Okay.

847
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:36,580
 - They were all barbarians.

848
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:38,740
 - The Greeks even called other Greeks barbarians.

849
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:39,580
 - Did they?

850
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:41,580
 - So it was just people who didn't want exactly like you,

851
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,540
 basically, was barbarian.

852
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:46,060
 And there's that weird folk etymology that it was,

853
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:47,300
 people who had bids.

854
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,140
 - It was barbarian.

855
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:49,860
 - It was barbarian, but I don't think that is true.

856
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:50,700
 - Okay, no.

857
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:51,900
 - All right, we're just on beards.

858
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:55,020
 So there was something like, I read that was about seven sacks

859
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:57,420
 of Rome over a different periods of time.

860
00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:00,940
 And in 1527, there was one, but that's post,

861
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:03,820
 when you're saying Rome, the ancient Rome.

862
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:04,660
 - Yes, yes.

863
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:06,220
 - So, but it's still counted as Rome, I suppose.

864
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:07,060
 - Oh, it's still Rome.

865
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:07,900
 - It's still Rome.

866
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,060
 - It's still going into it.

867
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:09,900
 Congratulations, guys.

868
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,060
 - The city is still, is always Rome.

869
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:11,900
 - Yeah, yeah.

870
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:12,740
 - Okay, good.

871
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:13,580
 - I hope, 'cause I'm going next week,

872
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:15,060
 so it's gonna be very awkward if it disappeared

873
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,060
 a thousand years ago.

874
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:19,820
 But so, 1527, it was sacked so bad.

875
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:21,060
 That was a really, really bad one.

876
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,740
 It was a sacks city.

877
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:23,580
 - Exactly.

878
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:24,780
 - Yeah, big sack.

879
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:26,740
 That's the Pope at the time, Clement VII,

880
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:29,020
 grew a beard in mourning.

881
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:31,380
 It was sort of a display of mourning.

882
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:33,500
 And he had it until his death in 1534,

883
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:37,220
 but he kickstarted a trend amongst posts to have beards.

884
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:38,740
 'Cause they didn't have beards up until that point.

885
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:40,540
 There were a few that had, but the idea is,

886
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:43,460
 if you were a man of God, that you had to be clean shaven.

887
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:46,500
 But it was seen, he was so loved, I think,

888
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:50,780
 that for 24 subsequent popes, they all had a beard.

889
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:51,620
 - Right.

890
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:53,980
 - Yeah, so he started a trend of beards in popes, that's great.

891
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:56,220
 - Oh my God, so this whole hipster beard trend,

892
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:58,860
 we keep thinking he is gonna end clearly by dance face.

893
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:00,380
 It doesn't seem like he is.

894
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:03,540
 This could go on for the length of 24 popes, range.

895
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:04,380
 - Yeah.

896
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:05,220
 - That's a long trend.

897
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:07,140
 - And if you want to be a man of God,

898
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,780
 then you can get your free trail set.

899
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:09,620
 - Just spawn.

900
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:13,900
 (laughs)

901
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:16,500
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact to the show,

902
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:17,700
 and that is my fact.

903
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:21,420
 My fact this week is a people who have died from laughing

904
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:23,820
 include a fifth century Greek artist

905
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:26,180
 who couldn't stop laughing at his own painting,

906
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:29,500
 and an Australian dog trainer who died after reading

907
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:32,420
 the price difference of some commodities in 1915

908
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:34,580
 as compared to 1920.

909
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:35,500
 (laughs)

910
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,740
 They're very funny price deals.

911
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:37,580
 - Is that yes?

912
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:39,580
 - Would the price gone down or up?

913
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:40,860
 - I think they'd gone up.

914
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:42,980
 - Has anyone looked at the price commodities

915
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,700
 from 1915?

916
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:45,860
 - I think you have.

917
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:46,860
 (laughs)

918
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:49,900
 - Well, I just about managed to survive.

919
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:50,900
 No, I did.

920
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,300
 It was during the war, wasn't it?

921
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:55,500
 So everything went up in price,

922
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:58,380
 including wheat that increased by over 50%

923
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:00,740
 to more than six times the pre-war rate.

924
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,780
 - What, by 1920?

925
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:04,180
 1915, that was.

926
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:06,260
 - Yeah, compared to 1920, though.

927
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:07,260
 - I didn't check that.

928
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:08,740
 - Jane, you've just,

929
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:11,020
 like, you've done a half the research here.

930
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:12,380
 No, one, do you haven't died laughing?

931
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:14,420
 (laughs)

932
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:15,740
 - That's the thing, it's dangerous, right?

933
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,060
 We know it to be dangerous, so.

934
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:17,900
 - Very risky.

935
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,060
 - There are lots of stories on there

936
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:20,060
 about people dying laughing,

937
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:22,220
 but there are a lot of them, a pinch of salt.

938
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:23,860
 A lot of them seem to have had underlying

939
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:24,700
 medical conditions.

940
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:25,540
 - Yes.

941
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:26,380
 - That would have been aggravated.

942
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:28,900
 - Absolutely, but they did go out still counts.

943
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:29,740
 - In the last.

944
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:30,580
 - So nice, yeah.

945
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:32,420
 - There's an ancient story about a seeer

946
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:35,580
 called Kalkas, who died after another seeer

947
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:37,140
 had predicted his death,

948
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:38,980
 and then the other seeer had been proved wrong.

949
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:40,380
 His prediction had been so wrong,

950
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:42,020
 and Kalkas laughed and laughed and laughed,

951
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:43,260
 and then died.

952
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:46,060
 That's proving the prediction right.

953
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:48,860
 Is it one of those bullet testicle baby stories?

954
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:51,260
 - I think a lot of these are, aren't they?

955
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:52,100
 - Yeah.

956
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:54,860
 - So, when you tell us the story of the Greek artist?

957
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:57,540
 - The Greek artist was called Zeusus.

958
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:58,940
 Z-E-U-X-I-S.

959
00:36:58,940 --> 00:36:59,780
 - Zeusus.

960
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:01,020
 - Zeusus?

961
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:02,420
 - Like Zeusus.

962
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:03,660
 - Zeusus.

963
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:05,900
 - So the Greek artist is called Zeusus.

964
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:08,380
 - Phil century BC, was he from Manhattan?

965
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:10,780
 - Yeah, he was a Marx brother.

966
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:12,620
 He's Z-E-X-I-S.

967
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:15,620
 - He's Z-E-X-I-S.

968
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:16,660
 - He's coming around.

969
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:19,340
 - So he died laughing because he painted,

970
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:21,580
 'cause he heard you tried to pronounce his name.

971
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:24,380
 (laughing)

972
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:27,620
 He was painting the goddess Aphrodite.

973
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:28,460
 Aphrodite?

974
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:31,340
 Z-E-X-I-S and Aphrodite.

975
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:34,260
 And the old woman who commissioned it from him

976
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:37,260
 insisted that she be the model for the portrait.

977
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,300
 Which he thought was ridiculous.

978
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,300
 She didn't look like Aphrodite.

979
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,620
 So, he painted it.

980
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:42,700
 And I imagine it as he got to the end,

981
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:43,900
 final dab on the painting.

982
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:44,740
 He stood back.

983
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:46,460
 He thought this is so ridiculous

984
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:50,260
 that he went into laughter convulsions and died.

985
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:52,820
 Is the story that we, that we, to believe.

986
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:53,660
 - That's good.

987
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:54,500
 - Yeah.

988
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,540
 - When she got the painting for free,

989
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:56,780
 you just take it away, wouldn't you?

990
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:57,620
 - Yeah.

991
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:58,460
 - Roll it up.

992
00:37:58,460 --> 00:37:59,900
 (laughing)

993
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,300
 - He's amazing those who exist.

994
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:03,900
 There's one story that's related by plenty of the elder,

995
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:06,060
 which is that he was,

996
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:08,900
 he basically got into an art battle

997
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:12,100
 with another massive painter of the time.

998
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:12,940
 - What was it called?

999
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:14,420
 - He was called Pahasius.

1000
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:18,700
 So, Zwiexus and Pahasius decided to have an art off.

1001
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,700
 And they arrived to this battle,

1002
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:23,860
 both bringing the best painting that they could possibly do.

1003
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:28,860
 So, Zwiexus pulls back his painting to reveal grapes.

1004
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,820
 So he pulls a little sheet away, grapes are there.

1005
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:32,580
 The grapes are said to be so real

1006
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:34,540
 that birds fly down from the sky

1007
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:36,220
 and start pecking at the painting.

1008
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:37,060
 - Really?

1009
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:38,740
 - Huge, huge deal is doing really well.

1010
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:40,740
 Pahasius then says,

1011
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:43,100
 "Okay, well let me unveil my painting,"

1012
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:44,540
 which is behind these curtains,

1013
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:47,140
 only to reveal that the curtains themselves

1014
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:49,540
 are the painting so real.

1015
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:50,980
 - Oh M.G. - Yeah.

1016
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:52,380
 - Is an illusion.

1017
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:53,220
 And he won.

1018
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:54,220
 He beat Zwiexus.

1019
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:55,060
 - Yeah.

1020
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:57,580
 - I heard that Zwiexus was the one who was trying

1021
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:59,300
 to push the cloth away.

1022
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:00,380
 - Oh, right.

1023
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:01,780
 - Pahasius is painting.

1024
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:02,620
 - Okay.

1025
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:03,460
 - And so he was like,

1026
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:04,820
 "I'm going to show what yours looks like

1027
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:06,940
 and he couldn't do it because it was painted on the..."

1028
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:07,780
 - That makes sense.

1029
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:08,620
 - That's astonishing.

1030
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:10,460
 - There's another anecdote that says

1031
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:12,860
 he drew a boy holding the grapes

1032
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:15,500
 and the bird came down to try and peck the grapes,

1033
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:16,980
 but he was really unhappy about that.

1034
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,780
 Why might that be?

1035
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:20,100
 - Who Zwiexus was unhappy?

1036
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:20,940
 - Yes.

1037
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:22,820
 - Was he his painting?

1038
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:23,820
 - No.

1039
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,980
 He was unhappy with his own skill.

1040
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:27,860
 - Because the bird wasn't scared of the boy?

1041
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:28,700
 - Exactly.

1042
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,980
 Yeah, so the grapes were good enough,

1043
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:32,660
 but obviously the boy wasn't good enough

1044
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:34,340
 'cause the birds weren't scared.

1045
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:35,180
 I'm liking that.

1046
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:36,020
 - You're embarrassing.

1047
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:37,180
 - I can't.

1048
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:40,340
 - There are a few more famous ancients who died laughing.

1049
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:43,860
 So my favorite, which I think I read in Mary Bid's book,

1050
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:46,900
 was the fact that two famous figures in ancient Greece

1051
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:49,260
 were separately recorded as having died laughing

1052
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:52,620
 after seeing a donkey eating figs and drinking wine.

1053
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:53,460
 - Okay.

1054
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:54,300
 - It's funny.

1055
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,140
 - It's very funny.

1056
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:55,980
 - It's ridiculous.

1057
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:57,700
 It's obviously the same story that's been pitched

1058
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:58,980
 by two people.

1059
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:01,060
 So there's one of them, which is--

1060
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:04,300
 - It could be one very funny donkey doing the rounds.

1061
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:06,060
 - The greatest comedian of the third century BC.

1062
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:07,340
 - You have a lovely donkey of death.

1063
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:09,820
 - It could have been an Irishman in a donkey's seat.

1064
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:10,660
 (laughing)

1065
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:12,420
 - Just trying to say let me out.

1066
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:14,460
 They didn't speak Irish in ancient Greece.

1067
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:18,980
 So one was recorded by Valerius Maximus

1068
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:20,860
 in the first century AD,

1069
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:24,140
 but it was talking about Philharmon in the third century BC

1070
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:27,260
 who had, so he was this master chap

1071
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:30,380
 and his slave had put figs in the room with him

1072
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:33,260
 and he watched a donkey start eating the figs

1073
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:35,460
 and he was quite pissed off so he called his slave

1074
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:37,260
 and said come here, chase that donkey away.

1075
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:38,580
 I don't know why he couldn't get up

1076
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:40,060
 and chase the donkey away himself.

1077
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:41,820
 And the slave took a while to arrive.

1078
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:43,740
 So by the time the slave had got there

1079
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:45,940
 to chase the donkey away, all the figs had gone.

1080
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:48,420
 So Philharmon said, well you might as well

1081
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:50,180
 now give the donkey some wine.

1082
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:51,020
 (laughing)

1083
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:52,580
 'Cause he had a joke about how--

1084
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:53,420
 - Yeah, yeah.

1085
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:55,540
 - And then he found himself so hilarious

1086
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:58,500
 that he laughed, that he died apparently

1087
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:01,620
 crushing his feeble windpipe with his own panting.

1088
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:02,980
 And then-- - What?

1089
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:05,420
 - Can I just say, so he was laughing at his own joke?

1090
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:07,380
 - Yeah, absolutely, yeah.

1091
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:08,220
 - He was a funny guy.

1092
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:10,620
 And then exactly the same thing is told about the stoic

1093
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:12,060
 for lots of a chrysopus.

1094
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:14,740
 Apparently he died laughing at the very similar joke

1095
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:19,580
 that he told when a donkey was quoting his figs.

1096
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:21,980
 - Yeah, maybe it was just the classic funny thing

1097
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:24,500
 and that doesn't quite translate these days.

1098
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:27,420
 - It can't do, there must be something we're missing.

1099
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:29,380
 - Well, or it's like exactly what Anna says,

1100
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:30,540
 it's just one story.

1101
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:31,580
 (laughing)

1102
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:34,140
 - I think it's very funny, it's a funny joke.

1103
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:37,180
 - Someone else who supposedly died laughing

1104
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:41,500
 was Anthony Trollop, and he was supposedly reading

1105
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:44,500
 a book called "Vice Versa, a Lesson to Fathers"

1106
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:48,020
 by F. Anstey, and he found a bin in it

1107
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:50,740
 that was so funny that he died laughing.

1108
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:51,940
 But what I found really interesting

1109
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:54,500
 is that this is a really old book,

1110
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:59,380
 but it's about a businessman who finds an Indian magic stone

1111
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:01,860
 and swaps body with his young son.

1112
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:03,780
 He's basically freaky Friday.

1113
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:05,340
 - Wow, that's great.

1114
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:08,540
 - Big, all these movies, it's been going on 30.

1115
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:09,380
 - Yeah.

1116
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:12,900
 - My, as yet, unpicked up screenplay, "The Wrong Tree,"

1117
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:14,700
 which is a dog body swap comedy.

1118
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:15,980
 - Or does he swap with a tree?

1119
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:17,860
 - No, two dogs swap with each other.

1120
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:18,700
 - All right.

1121
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:19,660
 - But one of them is a big scary dog

1122
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:22,100
 and one of them is a small lap dog.

1123
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,380
 - Why is it the wrong tree?

1124
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:25,900
 - 'Cause they've both been, 'cause this is a magic tree,

1125
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:28,380
 which they're both running round.

1126
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:29,740
 - God, I thought this was a joke,

1127
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:31,020
 but actually it's becoming apparent

1128
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:32,020
 that you've actually got this.

1129
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:33,660
 - No, no, I want to jump in and say,

1130
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:34,500
 let's not indulge it,

1131
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:35,900
 'cause it's can go on for half an hour.

1132
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:36,740
 It's really detailed.

1133
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:37,580
 - I've got the copy right,

1134
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:38,900
 just to make that very, very clear.

1135
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:41,340
 - What about two grizzly bears who swap bodies

1136
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:42,500
 with each other?

1137
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:43,340
 (laughing)

1138
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:45,540
 - What, what was the mechanism by me?

1139
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:50,540
 (laughing)

1140
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:53,540
 - I got more recent one that's happened, 1988.

1141
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:54,980
 Someone passed away from laughing

1142
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:57,540
 while they were watching a fish called Wanda.

1143
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:58,940
 And they were watching a scene. - Funny film.

1144
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:00,100
 - Yeah, funny film. - Yeah.

1145
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:01,940
 They were watching a scene where Michael Palin

1146
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:04,260
 get some french fries stuffed up his nose.

1147
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:06,900
 So Michael Palin through a bit of comedy

1148
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:07,900
 led to someone's death.

1149
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:10,300
 And what is amazing about that is in the very first episode

1150
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:12,460
 of Monty Python, Palin was part of the team

1151
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:14,380
 that wrote about the funniest joke ever

1152
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:15,580
 that was used in war.

1153
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:18,340
 And it kind of life-imitated art there, really.

1154
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:21,860
 - On QI, the TV show that we all work for.

1155
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:24,980
 Someone wrote to us, probably about 10 years ago,

1156
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:26,980
 maybe longer, I think it's before all you guys,

1157
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:29,740
 all you two started and when Dan was still there.

1158
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:32,260
 And they said that their father was watching QI

1159
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:33,260
 and died laughing.

1160
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:34,580
 - No. - Yeah.

1161
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:36,820
 - And it was obviously said that the father had died,

1162
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:38,380
 but actually he really loved the show

1163
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:40,700
 and it was a fitting thing to happen.

1164
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:42,660
 - Do we know which moment?

1165
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:44,220
 Was it where the apocalypse is?

1166
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:45,340
 - So they're not specifying?

1167
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:46,340
 - No, it was before that.

1168
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:48,620
 I think it was when we brought a donkey on

1169
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:49,700
 in theettes of things.

1170
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:51,500
 (laughing)

1171
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:53,540
 - It was either the D series or the F series,

1172
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:55,540
 apparently none of that.

1173
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:56,700
 But yeah, that's, that happened.

1174
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:57,540
 - That's very cool.

1175
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:59,820
 - How nice that he wrote in to say that as well.

1176
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:02,220
 - But laughing was often seen as not a good thing

1177
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:03,140
 to be doing.

1178
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:06,060
 So there are lots of people who prescribed against it.

1179
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:09,180
 There was a 16th century doctor called La Joubert

1180
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:11,700
 who described laughter as quite a dangerous thing

1181
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:13,900
 'cause it could bring on fits and fainting and stuff.

1182
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:16,340
 And he described it as laughter.

1183
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:18,180
 He defined as sparkling of eyes,

1184
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:21,620
 redness of face, sweat coming out of the entire body.

1185
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:23,580
 If the use of tears, rising of veins

1186
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:25,340
 and emptying of bowels and bladder.

1187
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:27,100
 (laughing)

1188
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:28,700
 - Wow, that's why it's so dangerous

1189
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:30,340
 taking a cleaning job at Drongless.

1190
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:33,980
 'Cause people emptied their bowels and bladder

1191
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:34,820
 with their laughter.

1192
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:35,660
 - Is that a comedy club?

1193
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:36,580
 - Yes, it's a comedy club.

1194
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:37,740
 - Sorry, that was really funny,

1195
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:40,180
 but I was just trying to hold control of my bowels and bladder.

1196
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:41,900
 (laughing)

1197
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:44,620
 - Supposedly Newton never laughed.

1198
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:47,060
 There's a story that says that he only laughed once

1199
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:48,220
 in his life when he was asked,

1200
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:50,300
 what is the point of studying Euclid?

1201
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:53,220
 - It's classic.

1202
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:54,260
 - That is a funny one.

1203
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:57,180
 - And someone who doesn't laugh is called an age elast.

1204
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:58,340
 - Not really.

1205
00:44:58,340 --> 00:45:01,540
 - I love the word gelastic laughing related.

1206
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:03,620
 So I think there are people who have sort of

1207
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:05,780
 gelastic seizures where they can't prevent themselves

1208
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:07,620
 laughing even if the occasion doesn't call for it

1209
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:08,700
 or if it's very inappropriate.

1210
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:09,540
 - That's right.

1211
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:10,980
 And someone who's a misal gelast is someone

1212
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:12,420
 who hates laughter.

1213
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:13,500
 - Is that so?

1214
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:15,900
 - Gets really annoyed but gets irritated by it.

1215
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:18,300
 - It was also someone who loves that Japanese soup.

1216
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:20,420
 (laughing)

1217
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:23,580
 - I have a study, another study on laughter,

1218
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:27,460
 which found that the best way to make a baby laugh.

1219
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:28,300
 - Oh yeah.

1220
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:29,140
 - Yeah.

1221
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:30,300
 - And this works, baby's between about six months and two years.

1222
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:31,140
 - Should we guess?

1223
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:31,980
 - Yeah.

1224
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:33,820
 - Did they, are they ticklish?

1225
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:34,660
 - Oh, okay.

1226
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:37,900
 So this is normal comedy club rules that you can't tickle

1227
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:38,900
 the audience.

1228
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:41,140
 (laughing)

1229
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:43,900
 - And not used to do that, even if tickles.

1230
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:45,980
 - Okay, so is it, yeah, done.

1231
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:47,060
 Did you say peekaboo?

1232
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:49,460
 - Peekaboo, but I have a son so I've tested.

1233
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:50,300
 - Yeah, I'm making life.

1234
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:52,340
 - Have you tested the other methods?

1235
00:45:52,340 --> 00:45:54,940
 - Okay, so scientists measured what made babies laugh

1236
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:58,020
 and they tried four methods, one of which was peekaboo.

1237
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:01,820
 One of which, putting a cup on your head.

1238
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:03,260
 - Okay, I've done that.

1239
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:04,100
 - That is funny.

1240
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:04,940
 - That is really funny.

1241
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:07,980
 - James is doing it now, and I'm laughing.

1242
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:11,380
 - And I'm now just wondering how flat James's head must be.

1243
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:12,620
 - Still sitting there.

1244
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:14,860
 - I don't think I can really talk properly.

1245
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:17,540
 - Oh, okay, keep it there, keep it there.

1246
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:18,780
 So one of them is putting a cup on your head.

1247
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:20,260
 One of them is pretending a toy animal

1248
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:21,300
 is making the wrong noise.

1249
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:22,140
 Have you tried that?

1250
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:24,140
 Taking a toy cat and going, no.

1251
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:26,060
 Okay, that's worth trying.

1252
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:28,420
 And then the last one is apparently stuffing your mouth

1253
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:31,820
 with material, just like filling your mouth with cloth.

1254
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:34,860
 - Okay, apparently there are five categories

1255
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:37,100
 of action type laughter.

1256
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:39,420
 So there are categories of verbal laughter,

1257
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:40,620
 like types of joke that make you laugh.

1258
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:42,820
 And then things you can do to make someone laugh.

1259
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:45,740
 This I should specify is according to this 16th century

1260
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:49,620
 doctor, called Lauren Zubat, who had disapproved of laughter.

1261
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:52,540
 But he said, laughter is divided into five categories.

1262
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:55,340
 Category number one is exposure of the genitals.

1263
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:56,860
 (laughing)

1264
00:46:56,860 --> 00:46:57,700
 - One whole category.

1265
00:46:57,700 --> 00:47:01,460
 - Can it, it's an old faithful Louis C. K. Rides again.

1266
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:03,660
 (laughing)

1267
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:05,660
 - Category number two, a separate category,

1268
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:07,580
 exposure of the arse.

1269
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:10,380
 Different, different kind of humor altogether.

1270
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:11,220
 - It is different.

1271
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:12,700
 - Category number three is a pratful,

1272
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:14,380
 which is falling on the arse.

1273
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:17,020
 And then there are two more which are unrelated.

1274
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:19,540
 Misapprehension of taste, so mistaking something

1275
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:21,380
 that smells really bad for something

1276
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:22,460
 that smells really good.

1277
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:25,180
 - And stuffing your mouth full of cloth.

1278
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:28,180
 (laughing)

1279
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:29,500
 - That's correct.

1280
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:30,580
 I just love that.

1281
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:33,540
 Drop moaning someone and showing your testicles

1282
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:37,020
 or founding two completely different categories of comedy.

1283
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:37,940
 (laughing)

1284
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:39,700
 - They hated the category one stuff tonight,

1285
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:41,860
 but they really went for the category two.

1286
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:43,100
 (laughing)

1287
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:45,700
 (upbeat music)

1288
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:48,220
 - Okay, that's it.

1289
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:49,220
 That is all of our facts.

1290
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:50,540
