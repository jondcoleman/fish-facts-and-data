00:00:00,00:00:06,[in the background]
00:00:06,00:00:19,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast"
00:00:19,00:00:22,coming to you from the QI offices in Covenant Garden.
00:00:22,00:00:23,My name is Dan Schlieber.
00:00:23,00:00:29,"I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, Anichezinski and James Harkin, and once again we"
00:00:29,00:00:33,have gathered around the microphones of our four favourite facts from the last seven
00:00:33,00:00:38,"days, and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:38,00:00:39,"Starting with you, Anna."
00:00:39,00:00:44,My fact this week is that travelling salesmen used to carry around miniature versions of
00:00:44,00:00:46,everything they were selling.
00:00:46,00:00:47,Right.
00:00:47,00:00:48,Such an amazing fact.
00:00:48,00:00:50,It is so cool.
00:00:50,00:00:51,So I found this.
00:00:51,00:00:55,"I don't know how I ended up on this site, but I was on Tim's antique site."
00:00:55,00:01:01,"Tim's very well-respected antique stealers, and they had an article which was titled, ""What"
00:01:01,00:01:03,"is miniature furniture?"""
00:01:03,00:01:08,And it started by saying this question has been asked time and time again for Tim and
00:01:08,00:01:09,Tim again.
00:01:09,00:01:17,"Tim's and Tim's again, and it says there's a whole myriad of answers, but we're here"
00:01:17,00:01:20,"to answer definitively, and they said, ""The vast majority of miniature furniture that"
00:01:20,00:01:25,you see in antique places was carried around by travelling salesmen because if you
00:01:25,00:01:27,"are going around the country, you're going to be away for weeks and weeks away from your"
00:01:27,00:01:32,"workshop, then obviously it's a hassle to take all the full-size stuff with you."""
00:01:32,00:01:36,"So they made up tiny samples, but perfectly sculpted samples."
00:01:36,00:01:40,"So incredibly good quality, you know, with the proper materials, well, but together samples."
00:01:40,00:01:42,But there were so many different things they tried this way.
00:01:42,00:01:47,"So there are amazing pages online of, there's a great website called Collectors Weekly,"
00:01:47,00:01:48,which has a load of samples.
00:01:48,00:01:49,It's so good.
00:01:49,00:01:56,"There were stoves, there were mini stoves and sewing machines and telephones, coffins."
00:01:56,00:01:59,"You can, I found on eBay in America, there's one going at the moment."
00:01:59,00:02:03,"It's eight inches long, it's selling for a few hundred dollars, and it's a travelling"
00:02:03,00:02:04,salesman's coffin.
00:02:04,00:02:05,"Oh, okay."
00:02:05,00:02:07,"As in a, it's a proper antique travelling salesman, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:02:07,00:02:08,"Yeah, exactly."
00:02:08,00:02:11,Have you seen the stuff that undertakers would take with them?
00:02:11,00:02:15,"Because it was not only, they'd have a briefcase full of miniature coffins, but you can also"
00:02:15,00:02:19,"get, as antiques, their briefcase of a graveyard plot."
00:02:19,00:02:24,"And again, if you go online, you open up the briefcase and it's proper fake grass around"
00:02:24,00:02:25,it.
00:02:25,00:02:29,And then it's got the grave stone as they would suggest that they'll make up your grave
00:02:29,00:02:30,so you wouldn't die.
00:02:30,00:02:31,Wow.
00:02:31,00:02:32,That's so cool.
00:02:32,00:02:36,"And is there a sort of a, a horse and you roleplay the whole event?"
00:02:36,00:02:37,I don't know.
00:02:37,00:02:38,Maybe they did.
00:02:38,00:02:40,I didn't see any briefcases with the miniature horse in them.
00:02:40,00:02:47,You could in the late 19th century by miniature step ladders and ironing boards.
00:02:47,00:02:52,And this was from a guy called Holy Kirk Christianson in Denmark.
00:02:52,00:02:56,And he had a woodworking company and he was making these step ladders and ironing boards.
00:02:56,00:02:59,"But then he thought, you know what, I prefer making these little things and making the big"
00:02:59,00:03:00,things.
00:03:00,00:03:04,Why don't I start a company where I make lots of little things and he started the Lego
00:03:04,00:03:05,company?
00:03:05,00:03:06,No.
00:03:06,00:03:07,Isn't that cool?
00:03:07,00:03:08,That's very cool.
00:03:08,00:03:11,He started off making miniature things with travelling salesmen and then he became a Lego
00:03:11,00:03:12,guy.
00:03:12,00:03:13,That's so cool.
00:03:13,00:03:14,That is amazing.
00:03:14,00:03:18,"So these don't, because there were a lot of sort of miniature version tallies back in history,"
00:03:18,00:03:23,"kind of like, I guess, how Lego came out, miniature gilletines from the French Revolution."
00:03:23,00:03:24,Yeah.
00:03:24,00:03:25,This is during the French Revolution.
00:03:25,00:03:28,"They used to sell them for kids to play with and with, and you sold dolls with it."
00:03:28,00:03:29,You sold dolls with them?
00:03:29,00:03:30,You would chop your dolls head off.
00:03:30,00:03:31,No.
00:03:31,00:03:32,Yes.
00:03:32,00:03:35,"But if you don't have it, if you're too poor to afford the dolls, you can just put your"
00:03:35,00:03:36,fingers through it.
00:03:36,00:03:38,It makes you kind of finger-puff it.
00:03:38,00:03:40,"You did use to get those gilletines that you put your fingers in, didn't you?"
00:03:40,00:03:43,Like in a magic set and stuff.
00:03:43,00:03:44,Yeah.
00:03:44,00:03:46,And then it looks like you're going to chop them off and you don't actually chop them off.
00:03:46,00:03:47,Yeah.
00:03:47,00:03:51,Imagine if one in every ten gilletines was one of those and so it means that some people
00:03:51,00:03:52,get away from their crimes.
00:03:52,00:03:53,Like the opposite.
00:03:53,00:03:54,On real gilletines.
00:03:54,00:03:55,Yeah.
00:03:55,00:03:56,That was really nice.
00:03:56,00:03:57,Russian reprieve.
00:03:57,00:03:58,Yeah.
00:03:58,00:04:03,There was another reason for having miniature furniture that sometimes wasn't to show
00:04:03,00:04:05,off your furniture and that was if it was practice furniture.
00:04:05,00:04:09,"So this is something if you're an antique dealer, you get good at distinguishing the proper"
00:04:09,00:04:14,"miniatures from the apprentice pieces, so you can also buy them."
00:04:14,00:04:18,And it's if you're auditioning an apprentice and then the craftsman would give the apprentice
00:04:18,00:04:21,"a really cheap, crappy piece of wood and say, ""Make something awesome out of this."""
00:04:21,00:04:22,Completely understand.
00:04:22,00:04:25,"When you said practice furniture, I thought it was something you practiced sitting on."
00:04:25,00:04:27,"Oh, you got your real chair."
00:04:27,00:04:29,You can't contrast it with a real chair.
00:04:29,00:04:31,It's a cotton wool one.
00:04:31,00:04:34,Would those apprentice pieces go out on the road as well?
00:04:34,00:04:35,No.
00:04:35,00:04:36,"Ah, okay."
00:04:36,00:04:37,"No, they're just for the workshop."
00:04:37,00:04:38,"And then it kind of stopped, didn't it?"
00:04:38,00:04:40,"Once we got photos, people just said round castle looks."
00:04:40,00:04:44,"Although you still get people selling things dorset, don't you?"
00:04:44,00:04:50,"In 2010, in the UK, the dorset, dorset sales sector was officially valued at 4.7 billion"
00:04:50,00:04:55,"a year in the UK, and that's only the legitimate things because people are obviously selling"
00:04:55,00:05:00,"other things dorset, and in 2012, the number of complaints about dodgy dorset sales hit"
00:05:00,00:05:06,"a record high with 35,000 complaints made, so people are still doing this all the time."
00:05:06,00:05:11,"I didn't know that you are technically a peddler, P-E-D-L-A-R."
00:05:11,00:05:15,"I didn't know that peddler was still a trade as in it's still properly termed, but you need"
00:05:15,00:05:17,a peddler's license to peddle.
00:05:17,00:05:19,Because it's such an old fashioned term.
00:05:19,00:05:20,"Exactly, yeah."
00:05:20,00:05:26,"But you go to your local police authority and you tell them who you are, and you have to"
00:05:26,00:05:30,"have lived in the area for a little while, I think, and it costs Â£12.25 to get a year's"
00:05:30,00:05:31,license peddling.
00:05:31,00:05:32,Does it?
00:05:32,00:05:33,Yeah.
00:05:33,00:05:34,Wow.
00:05:34,00:05:35,"It just shows, like, obviously, what a common profession it was."
00:05:35,00:05:42,"How many synonyms there are for this job, so you could be a monger, obviously, and you could"
00:05:42,00:05:43,be a solicitor.
00:05:43,00:05:44,That was an old word for it.
00:05:44,00:05:45,It was a lawyer.
00:05:45,00:05:46,A cost of monger.
00:05:46,00:05:47,"You don't want to confuse those, though."
00:05:47,00:05:48,I don't.
00:05:48,00:05:49,My solicitor will be here in a minute.
00:05:49,00:05:53,I'll be back soon with a load of dishcloths.
00:05:53,00:05:54,(LAUGHTER)
00:05:54,00:05:56,The tiny little judges chair.
00:05:56,00:05:57,Yeah.
00:05:57,00:06:04,"Just to see what you're saying before monger, like, because obviously you have fish mongers"
00:06:04,00:06:06,and cuss mongers and all that kind of stuff.
00:06:06,00:06:09,"Would they dot-dot things, or is that just a seller of things, or what?"
00:06:09,00:06:14,"I think it was a seller of things, but then it would often, like you say, the mongers coming"
00:06:14,00:06:15,down the street now.
00:06:15,00:06:16,Cool.
00:06:16,00:06:20,I've never heard it on its own without some kind of noun before it.
00:06:20,00:06:21,No.
00:06:21,00:06:22,"Well, you don't mong nothing."
00:06:22,00:06:24,So that's why it's often proceeded with the thing you're monging.
00:06:24,00:06:27,What do you do if you sell mong beans?
00:06:27,00:06:28,(LAUGHTER)
00:06:28,00:06:29,A mong monger.
00:06:29,00:06:30,A mong monger.
00:06:30,00:06:31,A monger.
00:06:31,00:06:34,"Oh, that mong monger's a real monger."
00:06:34,00:06:35,(LAUGHTER)
00:06:35,00:06:39,"But yeah, you had, so in the, in the olden days, there are some peddlers that you don't"
00:06:39,00:06:40,have as much today.
00:06:40,00:06:42,"You had the tooth puller, and that was quite common."
00:06:42,00:06:45,You'd have the tooth pullers who'd come around and bang on your door to pull your teeth
00:06:45,00:06:46,out.
00:06:46,00:06:47,Okay.
00:06:47,00:06:48,Or wouldn't get off the horse.
00:06:48,00:06:49,Would they tie your tooth to the door?
00:06:49,00:06:51,"Well, that's what you do, wouldn't you?"
00:06:51,00:06:54,"You would tie your tooth to the door, and then when they open the door, they pull your"
00:06:54,00:06:55,tooth out.
00:06:55,00:06:56,(LAUGHTER)
00:06:56,00:06:57,You don't have to pay them anymore.
00:06:57,00:06:58,(LAUGHTER)
00:06:58,00:06:59,So you don't open the door until they've said who they are.
00:06:59,00:07:02,"They say it's the tooth puller, and you go, ""Hang on a sec."""
00:07:02,00:07:03,(LAUGHTER)
00:07:03,00:07:08,"I think they tied it to the horse, because it just, it's just a specific that they don't"
00:07:08,00:07:09,get off their horse.
00:07:09,00:07:10,It's quite a lot.
00:07:10,00:07:13,"So I imagine maybe they tie it to the reins of the horse and gallop away, or something?"
00:07:13,00:07:14,No.
00:07:14,00:07:15,Come on.
00:07:15,00:07:18,"And then it's like galloping off of you still attached to it, like you're a just married"
00:07:18,00:07:19,car or something.
00:07:19,00:07:20,(LAUGHTER)
00:07:20,00:07:22,It's not as wobbly as I thought.
00:07:22,00:07:23,(LAUGHTER)
00:07:23,00:07:26,"The tooth pullers, as well as being tooth pullers, were often travelling dentists."
00:07:26,00:07:31,"And you can also get some of the dentist kits, so they would have a whole selection of teeth."
00:07:31,00:07:35,"And because it was the 19th century, the teeth would be graded from sort of just light yellow"
00:07:35,00:07:38,"to very dark, brownish, black."
00:07:38,00:07:40,"And they'd come to replace your teeth, so they'd open their briefcase and be like, ""Hey,"
00:07:40,00:07:41,"which do you want?"""
00:07:41,00:07:42,"And you'd say, ""Oh, that nice yellow one."""
00:07:42,00:07:44,"And they'd say, ""Mmm, I think, maybe more."""
00:07:44,00:07:46,"Maybe she looks colour-chart, but..."
00:07:46,00:07:47,Yeah.
00:07:47,00:07:48,"Well, all the colours are just..."
00:07:48,00:07:49,(LAUGHTER)
00:07:49,00:07:57,"So, one famous travelling salesman of history was Jeremy Clarkson's dad, and he was"
00:07:57,00:07:58,"famous, was he?"
00:07:58,00:08:02,"Well, he is now, I would say, as the father of Jeremy Clarkson."
00:08:02,00:08:03,Okay.
00:08:03,00:08:08,"But Jeremy Clarkson's dad, in fact, I think his parents, they specialised in selling teacosies."
00:08:08,00:08:11,Didn't they sell Paddington Bear or something?
00:08:11,00:08:12,"Yeah, they did."
00:08:12,00:08:16,"And Jeremy Clarkson's first job was going door to door, so..."
00:08:16,00:08:17,This Paddington Bear!
00:08:17,00:08:18,(LAUGHTER)
00:08:18,00:08:20,Exactly that.
00:08:20,00:08:22,"He was a travelling salesman, selling Paddington Bear."
00:08:22,00:08:23,And teacosies.
00:08:23,00:08:25,What do we have combination of things to be selling?
00:08:25,00:08:26,I know.
00:08:26,00:08:28,Do they have a range of stuff in between Paddington Bear and teacosies?
00:08:28,00:08:33,"There are sources on the line that say condoms, but that seems like such a strange third element"
00:08:33,00:08:34,to add to the mix.
00:08:34,00:08:37,"Well, all these says to me is they must have been woolen cognomps."
00:08:37,00:08:38,Yeah.
00:08:38,00:08:41,A teacosie for some people is a condom for others.
00:08:41,00:08:42,(LAUGHTER)
00:08:42,00:08:44,It was the slogan on their van.
00:08:44,00:08:46,(LAUGHTER)
00:08:46,00:08:50,"I can't believe that you would have a firm selling teacosies Paddington Bear or condoms,"
00:08:50,00:08:51,because it's two...
00:08:51,00:08:52,One of them is too sexy.
00:08:52,00:08:53,Yeah.
00:08:53,00:08:54,Smaller condoms.
00:08:54,00:08:55,(LAUGHTER)
00:08:55,00:08:57,"Some stuff on small things, very quickly."
00:08:57,00:08:58,"Oh, yeah."
00:08:58,00:09:05,"So, this year, in fact last year, there was the world's biggest ever historical tabletop"
00:09:05,00:09:06,war game.
00:09:06,00:09:07,Cool.
00:09:07,00:09:10,"So, do you know what I mean by that, because then you look confused."
00:09:10,00:09:11,"Yeah, so..."
00:09:11,00:09:15,"I don't think either of them knows, because they both said the word cool after what you said."
00:09:15,00:09:16,So...
00:09:16,00:09:17,Was it recreating a real battle?
00:09:17,00:09:19,It's recreating a real battle with little soldiers.
00:09:19,00:09:21,"It's kind of like poor hammer, basically."
00:09:21,00:09:25,"Like that, not with orcs, with actual people."
00:09:25,00:09:26,Boring.
00:09:26,00:09:27,(LAUGHTER)
00:09:27,00:09:32,"So, there was more than 20,000 miniature soldiers, and it was at the University of Glasgow and"
00:09:32,00:09:39,they replayed the Battle of Waterloo on a 192 square metre historical map.
00:09:39,00:09:44,"And it took them a year to paint all the soldiers, this group of over 100 people."
00:09:44,00:09:48,They'd been investigating the archaeology of the Waterloo Battlefield since 2015.
00:09:48,00:09:49,Wow.
00:09:49,00:09:51,And then they did this game.
00:09:51,00:09:57,"And there were 4,000 casualties in the battle, and the Allies won."
00:09:57,00:09:58,Because it wasn't definite.
00:09:58,00:10:01,"They were going to do it properly, like a proper game, and it could have been that Napoleon"
00:10:01,00:10:02,would have won it.
00:10:02,00:10:03,Oh.
00:10:03,00:10:04,But the Allies won.
00:10:04,00:10:09,"And at one stage, the Duke of Wellington in the battle had a traffic cone on his head."
00:10:09,00:10:10,(LAUGHTER)
00:10:10,00:10:14,"Because in Glasgow, which is where it was, famously, there's a statue there where they"
00:10:14,00:10:15,always put a traffic cone on them.
00:10:15,00:10:16,That's so funny.
00:10:16,00:10:17,That's so cool.
00:10:17,00:10:21,"Yeah, although that bit not historically accurate, right?"
00:10:21,00:10:22,Oh.
00:10:22,00:10:24,I'm not sure they even had traffic cones.
00:10:24,00:10:25,No.
00:10:25,00:10:26,They've misread tricorn.
00:10:26,00:10:27,It's been misplaced.
00:10:27,00:10:28,They've come right on the way.
00:10:28,00:10:29,(LAUGHTER)
00:10:29,00:10:31,"And do you know who invented, sorry, just while I'm on the subject."
00:10:31,00:10:34,Do you know who invented the first set of rules for playing with toy soldiers?
00:10:34,00:10:35,Ooh.
00:10:35,00:10:37,Is there someone we would have heard of?
00:10:37,00:10:38,Yes.
00:10:38,00:10:39,"Jeremy Clarkson's dad, isn't it?"
00:10:39,00:10:40,"It's not, though."
00:10:40,00:10:41,It's his mum.
00:10:41,00:10:42,"No, it's not."
00:10:42,00:10:44,He's the novelist H.G. Wells.
00:10:44,00:10:45,What?
00:10:45,00:10:46,He did that yet.
00:10:46,00:10:51,"In 1913, he wrote a book called Little Wars, which had the first ever set of rules for"
00:10:51,00:10:53,playing with toy soldiers.
00:10:53,00:11:00,"And the full title of the book was Little Wars, a game for boys from 12 years of age to 150."
00:11:00,00:11:05,"And for that more intelligent sort of girl who likes boys, games and books."
00:11:05,00:11:06,(LAUGHTER)
00:11:06,00:11:08,I've never met such a woman.
00:11:08,00:11:17,"OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is Andy."
00:11:17,00:11:20,"My fact is, that female grizzly bears can get half pregnant."
00:11:20,00:11:21,Mm-hmm.
00:11:21,00:11:22,Mm-hmm.
00:11:22,00:11:23,Intriguing.
00:11:23,00:11:24,What does that mean?
00:11:24,00:11:32,"It means they get pregnant, or they are fertilised, they're exorfertilised by a male during"
00:11:32,00:11:33,mating.
00:11:33,00:11:37,And then they don't do anything about it.
00:11:37,00:11:38,Several months.
00:11:38,00:11:39,OK.
00:11:39,00:11:40,Lazy.
00:11:40,00:11:44,"The egg is fertilised, and it turns into this tiny bundle of cells called a blastocyst."
00:11:44,00:11:45,And that's normal.
00:11:45,00:11:46,"We have those, too."
00:11:46,00:11:52,"But in almost all mammals, that then develops into an embryo."
00:11:52,00:11:56,"But in bears, it just floats around in their uterus, doing absolutely nothing for months"
00:11:56,00:11:58,on end.
00:11:58,00:12:02,"And then the bears put on weight for winter, because they need to hibernate."
00:12:02,00:12:05,They see how much weight they gain.
00:12:05,00:12:10,"And if they're up to the right level of body fat by the autumn, if they're 24% body fat,"
00:12:10,00:12:13,"they will go to their den for winter, and the blastocyst will implant into the wall of"
00:12:13,00:12:16,"their womb, and then it will develop into a cub."
00:12:16,00:12:19,"But if they're not, it just gets reabsorbed into the body of the female."
00:12:19,00:12:20,Right.
00:12:20,00:12:24,So they have this weird internal barometer of how well they're doing in terms of putting
00:12:24,00:12:25,on weight for winter.
00:12:25,00:12:26,"Oh, my God."
00:12:26,00:12:27,Have you seen the pictures?
00:12:27,00:12:31,Are these specific pictures actually published by Katmai National Park in Alaska?
00:12:31,00:12:32,Is it Katmai?
00:12:32,00:12:33,K-A-T-M-A-I?
00:12:33,00:12:37,"That's how I would pronounce it, but we've never pronounced anything right on this show,"
00:12:37,00:12:40,so don't break a tradition there.
00:12:40,00:12:46,"So there are photos published by this National Park in Alaska, where the public votes every"
00:12:46,00:12:51,"year on which bear wins the fastest, the best fattening bear, and you have to check it out,"
00:12:51,00:12:55,because they have these photos on their site of every bear in their National Park.
00:12:55,00:12:59,"And if you move this slider along the pictures, you can see the before and after, and it's"
00:12:59,00:13:02,"only in the course of two months, and it is incredible."
00:13:02,00:13:03,That's so cool.
00:13:03,00:13:05,"And it's like the opposite of fat shaming, isn't it?"
00:13:05,00:13:06,Exactly.
00:13:06,00:13:07,Yeah.
00:13:07,00:13:10,"It's like they're going to a weight watchers meeting every week, and they've put on an extra"
00:13:10,00:13:12,"free stone, and they're just getting applauded."
00:13:12,00:13:17,"And it is a huge amount they eat, and a huge amount they put on, so it's called Hyperfagia,"
00:13:17,00:13:23,"wouldn't they just eat constantly for a while, and they gain about two stone per week."
00:13:23,00:13:24,And so it's really fun to do.
00:13:24,00:13:27,I spent most of my research scrolling back and forth in these photos.
00:13:27,00:13:28,Yeah.
00:13:28,00:13:33,"It's interesting, with pregnancy and bears, I was reading about it zoos in America, polar bears,"
00:13:33,00:13:36,"the polar bears that they have there, they don't know how to tell if they're pregnant."
00:13:36,00:13:41,"It's really hard to tell if a bear is pregnant, because they often have pseudo pregnancy,"
00:13:41,00:13:43,so it looks like they're pregnant.
00:13:43,00:13:48,"They have the hormones that show up in labs that say they're pregnant, but they're not."
00:13:48,00:13:50,"It just, it matches the same thing."
00:13:50,00:13:54,So do you know how they find out if they have a pregnant polar bear?
00:13:54,00:13:55,Oh no.
00:13:55,00:13:59,"But they just wait and see if a baby comes out. They often do, but that's not useful for them,"
00:13:59,00:14:03,"because when it comes out, if none come out, then they're like, damn it, we need our breeding"
00:14:03,00:14:04,program to be better.
00:14:04,00:14:05,Okay.
00:14:05,00:14:08,They put them in a CT scanner.
00:14:08,00:14:09,No.
00:14:09,00:14:11,"Oh, wouldn't that be exciting to see?"
00:14:11,00:14:15,"They take some urine samples and they get, no, because he said the hormones is the same."
00:14:15,00:14:16,Yeah.
00:14:16,00:14:20,"They squeeze, they run in very quickly, and they squeeze the middle of the bear, and then"
00:14:20,00:14:22,they run out before it tears them into.
00:14:22,00:14:23,No.
00:14:23,00:14:24,No.
00:14:24,00:14:28,They send their poo to a dog called Elvis.
00:14:28,00:14:31,"Now, who's poo?"
00:14:31,00:14:32,They're the polar bears.
00:14:32,00:14:33,All right.
00:14:33,00:14:34,Okay.
00:14:34,00:14:35,What?
00:14:35,00:14:40,"They send the poo to this dog called Elvis, who has a 90% rate of saying whether or not"
00:14:40,00:14:41,they're pregnant or not.
00:14:41,00:14:42,I can't believe with every time.
00:14:42,00:14:43,I know.
00:14:43,00:14:44,What?
00:14:44,00:14:45,Yeah.
00:14:45,00:14:46,So this...
00:14:46,00:14:47,How do they...
00:14:47,00:14:48,They try to find out that Elvis can do that.
00:14:48,00:14:54,"They train this dog, Elvis, with another dog, and they kept, they gave them 200 samples to"
00:14:54,00:14:55,see whether they could break down.
00:14:55,00:15:00,"So there's more than 2,000 proteins in polar bear fecal samples, five are consistent with pregnancy,"
00:15:00,00:15:02,and that's what he was smelling out.
00:15:02,00:15:03,And 90 has a 90...
00:15:03,00:15:04,It's just one dog.
00:15:04,00:15:05,This is not what the dog can do.
00:15:05,00:15:09,"The other dog just guessed it at some points, just faked it, just went, ""Yup."""
00:15:09,00:15:11,"And because they needed a reward or whatever, so they kicked him out of the system."
00:15:11,00:15:13,It is just Elvis that they send it to.
00:15:13,00:15:14,"Oh, my goodness."
00:15:14,00:15:15,Yeah.
00:15:15,00:15:16,"But yeah, that's what they have to do."
00:15:16,00:15:17,One dog is helping them out.
00:15:17,00:15:18,Elvis.
00:15:18,00:15:19,"Well done, Elvis."
00:15:19,00:15:20,"Yeah, amazing."
00:15:20,00:15:21,Here are a dog.
00:15:21,00:15:25,Do you say in how most mammals don't do this thing?
00:15:25,00:15:29,"It was called embryonic diapos, isn't it?"
00:15:29,00:15:32,"Rodants do, quite a few of them bears do, as we know."
00:15:32,00:15:36,"Armadillos do weasels, badges, and kangaroos all do."
00:15:36,00:15:42,And some people think that maybe humans do on a small level.
00:15:42,00:15:47,So there have been a few case studies where women have had in vitro fertilization and then
00:15:47,00:15:52,"found out that they were pregnant more than a month later, like maybe two months later"
00:15:52,00:15:53,or stuff like that.
00:15:53,00:16:00,"And they reckon it might be a very minor diapos that happens in humans, but still more research"
00:16:00,00:16:01,needed.
00:16:01,00:16:05,"It's a bit of a crap diapos, though, because it is only ever really a week or two weeks,"
00:16:05,00:16:06,maybe three.
00:16:06,00:16:08,"Whereas these bears can hold him for a year, can't they?"
00:16:08,00:16:09,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:16:09,00:16:10,Do you guys want to hear something mental?
00:16:10,00:16:11,Yeah.
00:16:11,00:16:12,Yeah.
00:16:12,00:16:13,Okay.
00:16:13,00:16:18,"But sheep blasterists, these little bundles of cells, into the uteruses of mice."
00:16:18,00:16:19,Okay.
00:16:19,00:16:23,"Now sheep can't do this diapos thing, they just can't do it, and mice can do it."
00:16:23,00:16:30,"And when these sheep blasterists were inserted into mouse uteruses, they went into pause mode."
00:16:30,00:16:33,"The mice were able to pause the blasterists of a different speed, okay?"
00:16:33,00:16:34,I'm not surprised.
00:16:34,00:16:38,"Ben, I mean, why is this stressful?"
00:16:38,00:16:40,Stressful situation for a mouse.
00:16:40,00:16:43,"It's a difficult birth, isn't it?"
00:16:43,00:16:48,"But then they were removed, these blasterists, okay, after the mice paused them, and then they"
00:16:48,00:16:55,"were put back into sort of, you know, petri-dished, you know, fertilisation, whatever, sort of artificial"
00:16:55,00:16:58,"thing with sheep, and they grew into normal lambs."
00:16:58,00:16:59,Right.
00:16:59,00:17:00,So they were not inside the sheep?
00:17:00,00:17:01,They're not back in the sheep.
00:17:01,00:17:04,"They were, I think they were put back in the sheep or put back in the test tube or whatever."
00:17:04,00:17:09,"They were grown into, they grew into normal lambs, having been in a mouse's uterus."
00:17:09,00:17:10,Wow.
00:17:10,00:17:13,I think it's pretty tasteless that you won't differentiate between a test tube and a
00:17:13,00:17:14,sheep mate.
00:17:14,00:17:15,[laughter]
00:17:15,00:17:17,Bears or pregnancy?
00:17:17,00:17:19,Let's go bears.
00:17:19,00:17:20,Bear?
00:17:20,00:17:23,Some brown bears have oral sex.
00:17:23,00:17:25,"Oh, yeah, okay, okay."
00:17:25,00:17:28,"So this is, this is in a zoo in Croatia."
00:17:28,00:17:29,It's been noticed.
00:17:29,00:17:30,They're both males.
00:17:30,00:17:37,"Over 116 hours of observation, these two males did it 28 times in 116 hours, once every"
00:17:37,00:17:41,"four hours, over several days, impressive."
00:17:41,00:17:42,"Oh, really?"
00:17:42,00:17:43,Yeah.
00:17:43,00:17:45,Official study on the matter has said it might have been because they've been deprived of
00:17:45,00:17:50,"suckling, and that the provider may have found a substitute for teatsucking that also resulted"
00:17:50,00:17:52,in a letdown of substitute milk.
00:17:52,00:17:53,Right.
00:17:53,00:17:54,[laughter]
00:17:54,00:17:55,Right.
00:17:55,00:17:56,[laughter]
00:17:56,00:17:57,"Oh, what a weirdism."
00:17:57,00:17:58,Wow.
00:17:58,00:17:59,For that process.
00:17:59,00:18:02,Be a ward for the most disturbing factor of the year.
00:18:02,00:18:03,[laughter]
00:18:03,00:18:04,Good.
00:18:04,00:18:08,Do you suffer from premature letdown of substitute milk?
00:18:08,00:18:09,[laughter]
00:18:09,00:18:14,I think that was presented in a safer work away as I could manage it.
00:18:14,00:18:15,"Oh, it was very good."
00:18:15,00:18:16,"Yeah, you did well."
00:18:16,00:18:20,"Well, maybe humans could learn from that, because..."
00:18:20,00:18:25,Maybe you should be taking lessons from that.
00:18:25,00:18:27,This is why you're milk peddling.
00:18:27,00:18:28,[laughter]
00:18:28,00:18:29,I'm sorry.
00:18:29,00:18:30,Don't have any of the milk.
00:18:30,00:18:33,Will you take my substitute?
00:18:33,00:18:36,[laughter]
00:18:36,00:18:40,"So we can learn some stuff from bears, though, if not that."
00:18:40,00:18:44,"We can learn a lot from their hibernation period, right, or their topper that they go into,"
00:18:44,00:18:49,"so they are enormously fat, as we've said, when they'll go into this topper, and they'll"
00:18:49,00:18:53,"dig their dens, and they'll just lie there, and they don't get..."
00:18:53,00:18:55,So there's lots of stuff that we think we should look into to find out why they don't
00:18:55,00:18:59,"get, for instance, muscle and bone deterioration."
00:18:59,00:19:02,"So if people are in hospital, let's say you're in a coma, or you're confined to hospital"
00:19:02,00:19:07,"for months on end, you get terrible muscle wastage and bone wastage, and you get bedsoars,"
00:19:07,00:19:09,and they don't really get any of that.
00:19:09,00:19:12,"And also, they remain quite alert."
00:19:12,00:19:15,"So I think when animals properly hibernate, then you really can't wait them up."
00:19:15,00:19:18,"This is a good thing to be aware of with grizzly bears, actually."
00:19:18,00:19:22,"They will wake up as soon as you go anywhere near them, if they're in hibernation, and they"
00:19:22,00:19:25,can suddenly snap out of it and go for you.
00:19:25,00:19:32,"So I think people were studying grizzly bears, and they said, ""I'm just thinking that"
00:19:32,00:19:36,"the worst way that a grizzly bear can go for you is if it's not been suckly very well."""
00:19:36,00:19:44,"They'll go for any part of you that's nearest, to be honest, but they did a..."
00:19:44,00:19:45,Oh my god.
00:19:45,00:19:48,"Well, no, just imagine that scenario happening."
00:19:48,00:19:54,"You've got your life, but you've got to walk back to camp, and they say, ""How did you survive?"
00:19:54,00:19:56,"You won't believe this, guys."
00:19:56,00:19:58,"I just got sucked out by a grizzly bear."""
00:19:58,00:19:59,Oh my god.
00:19:59,00:20:03,"I took 12 hours, 28 times."
00:20:03,00:20:08,"Poor thing, wanted to go back to sleep."
00:20:08,00:20:11,Oh my god.
00:20:11,00:20:15,Disgusting.
00:20:15,00:20:17,Oh my god.
00:20:17,00:20:21,"I've got Disgusting Bear Story, just a match for Disgusting Bear Story."
00:20:21,00:20:27,"I found this really odd account from the 1700s, so there was a clergyman from court"
00:20:27,00:20:29,called Arthur O'Leary.
00:20:29,00:20:34,"And he was in Northern France, and he saw a dancing bear."
00:20:34,00:20:36,And this was an incredible dancing bear.
00:20:36,00:20:38,Everyone was talking about how amazing it was.
00:20:38,00:20:42,It could sort of count in numbers by putting its paw on the ground.
00:20:42,00:20:43,It would nod to gentleman.
00:20:43,00:20:47,"It just did all these sort of really graceful things, and this guy was thinking, ""How is"
00:20:47,00:20:48,"this possible?"""
00:20:48,00:20:53,"Then the giveaway happened when the bear suddenly yelled out, ""The devil take him."
00:20:53,00:20:55,"The guy has me persecuted."""
00:20:55,00:20:59,"And it turned out what happened, and he yelled that in Irish, so this guy understood"
00:20:59,00:21:00,because he was from court.
00:21:00,00:21:08,"It turns out that a man had been washed up in France, and sewn into a bear suit of a real"
00:21:08,00:21:13,"bear, and was made to perform, and was stuck inside, and that was his moment to get out."
00:21:13,00:21:17,"I don't know if he knew an Irishman was there, who'd understand his language, but yeah."
00:21:17,00:21:20,This is the call from the mid-1980s.
00:21:20,00:21:21,"Yeah, this is amazing."
00:21:21,00:21:23,Why did he wait so long to do it?
00:21:23,00:21:26,"Even if you don't understand Irish, you know if you're a human voice coming out of a bear"
00:21:26,00:21:27,that's something weird going on.
00:21:27,00:21:29,"Oh, it's just, you know, it was a dancing bear."
00:21:29,00:21:30,They thought this was a very talented bear.
00:21:30,00:21:32,"But if you're spelling stuff out on the ground, you could spell out help."
00:21:32,00:21:33,I am an Irishman.
00:21:33,00:21:38,"You're washed up on the beat, but you're, I mean, if you're French, you might not speak Irish."
00:21:38,00:21:39,That's true.
00:21:39,00:21:44,"I guess my point is, I still don't think Irish sounded to French people like the growl"
00:21:44,00:21:45,of a bear.
00:21:45,00:21:48,"Yeah, I think if he just shouted something."
00:21:48,00:21:52,"Yeah, you probably pick up words from the people around you."
00:21:52,00:21:53,"Yeah, exactly."
00:21:53,00:21:54,Bonjour!
00:21:54,00:21:55,Bonjour!
00:21:55,00:21:58,That is quite a story.
00:21:58,00:21:59,"It's bizarre, which I do not believe."
00:21:59,00:22:00,Yeah.
00:22:00,00:22:01,Neither do I.
00:22:01,00:22:02,It's out there.
00:22:02,00:22:03,Really good.
00:22:03,00:22:05,"And so just one or two things on pregnancy, maybe?"
00:22:05,00:22:06,"Oh, yeah, cool."
00:22:06,00:22:10,"Um, do you guys think it's possible to get pregnant via a bullet?"
00:22:10,00:22:11,"Um, there is."
00:22:11,00:22:14,"I've heard that, but it must be a myth."
00:22:14,00:22:18,"So there's a Civil War article, just out of the Civil War, American medical journal."
00:22:18,00:22:22,"There was a proper entry from a doctor called, um, Legand Capers."
00:22:22,00:22:25,"And he had been... Sorry, he was called Legand Capers."
00:22:25,00:22:26,"Oh, yeah."
00:22:26,00:22:27,I guess he was.
00:22:27,00:22:28,Legand got a weird name.
00:22:28,00:22:29,He was treating a soldier.
00:22:29,00:22:30,Yeah.
00:22:30,00:22:34,"He was a soldier who'd been shot in the Civil War, in a skirmish."
00:22:34,00:22:37,"And his testicle had been shot off, very, very painful, obviously."
00:22:37,00:22:41,"The doctor treated him as quickly as possible, dressed the wound."
00:22:41,00:22:44,"And then was immediately approached by a woman who said, oh, my daughter has been very badly"
00:22:44,00:22:45,wounded.
00:22:45,00:22:48,"A stray bullet had hit her in the abdominal cavity, right?"
00:22:48,00:22:52,"Unfortunately, he didn't have time to treat her properly and the army was fleeing."
00:22:52,00:22:57,So he left seven months later he returned and the woman was very heavily pregnant.
00:22:57,00:22:58,Wow.
00:22:58,00:23:06,The baby was born a little while later and the doctor observed that after the baby boy was
00:23:06,00:23:10,"born, inside the testicles of the baby boy was a bullet."
00:23:10,00:23:11,"Oh, man."
00:23:11,00:23:12,What?
00:23:12,00:23:13,"This has, like, a pen and teller."
00:23:13,00:23:14,What is it?
00:23:14,00:23:18,And it was written the name of the very doctor.
00:23:18,00:23:28,It was a hoax article.
00:23:28,00:23:34,"That's how the legend kind of entered the street, that's the first example of that story."
00:23:34,00:23:35,Right.
00:23:35,00:23:36,That is.
00:23:36,00:23:37,I can't remember who made it up now.
00:23:37,00:23:39,I was too involved in the story.
00:23:39,00:23:45,"The doctor, Legged, Legged, Legged and his capers."
00:23:45,00:23:51,"OK, it is time for fact number three and that is James."
00:23:51,00:23:58,"OK, my fact is that when the vandal sacked Rome in 455 AD, they agreed that they would just"
00:23:58,00:24:01,take the money and not damage any of the property.
00:24:01,00:24:02,"Sorry, funny."
00:24:02,00:24:03,So.
00:24:03,00:24:04,The vandal.
00:24:04,00:24:05,"Well, this is what I'm trying to do."
00:24:05,00:24:08,I'm trying to rescue the reputation of the vandals.
00:24:08,00:24:09,OK.
00:24:09,00:24:13,"And it is a little bit controversial because it obviously happened a long, long time ago and"
00:24:13,00:24:17,"a lot of people who were writing about it were Roman, who wanted to say bad things about"
00:24:17,00:24:24,"the vandals, but it does seem that the reputation that we have given the vandals for being vandals"
00:24:24,00:24:26,might not be fair.
00:24:26,00:24:32,"And actually, during this sack of Rome, they'd done a deal with Leo I, who was the Pope at"
00:24:32,00:24:33,the time.
00:24:33,00:24:38,"And he said, OK, you can come here because obviously we can't really defend ourselves, so you"
00:24:38,00:24:39,can come over.
00:24:39,00:24:43,"If you do, please leave all of our churches and all of our buildings intact, we'll give"
00:24:43,00:24:47,"you the money, we'll give you the jewels, we'll give you the gold and silver, but please"
00:24:47,00:24:48,don't do that.
00:24:48,00:24:53,"And it seems for the most part, although there was a few deaths and they did take a few"
00:24:53,00:24:54,people as slaves.
00:24:54,00:25:00,"For the most part, as far as pre-medieval sacks go, this was actually not one of the worst"
00:25:00,00:25:01,ones.
00:25:01,00:25:02,"But they did steal shed loads, right?"
00:25:02,00:25:07,Why don't we just use vandalism to mean stealing all the stuff somewhere and kidnapping
00:25:07,00:25:08,quite a few of the people?
00:25:08,00:25:11,"But we're just using vandalism to mean the wrong thing, the one thing they didn't do was smash"
00:25:11,00:25:12,anything up.
00:25:12,00:25:15,Really convinced by James' thesis on this.
00:25:15,00:25:20,"I had no idea that the vandals were relatively nice guys, who they were all Christians."
00:25:20,00:25:21,They were?
00:25:21,00:25:22,Good Christian boys and girls.
00:25:22,00:25:23,"With it, they weren't nice."
00:25:23,00:25:26,"Well, they were good Christians, if you believe the other Christians who didn't believe"
00:25:26,00:25:30,"the same Christian stuff as they believed in their Christian self, just got vandal stuff."
00:25:30,00:25:31,That's not relevant.
00:25:31,00:25:37,"But they had been pushed out of their native lands by the Huns, and the vandals were just"
00:25:37,00:25:42,"trying to get down to North Africa, which is where they settled and they took over Carthage."
00:25:42,00:25:48,"And Ibiza where they lived for 80 years, which I always think is quite a long car."
00:25:48,00:25:52,"But yeah, they eventually did move down and they lived in North Africa, and they were"
00:25:52,00:25:53,kind of happy there.
00:25:53,00:25:57,"But they were, because they had Carthage and they had a really good fleet, they were occasionally"
00:25:57,00:26:02,stealing from people and going on little forays and stuff.
00:26:02,00:26:05,"But then in Rome, there was also a dodgy stuff going on."
00:26:05,00:26:11,"So the Roman Emperor Valentinian III was murdered by Petronius Maximus, because they had a little"
00:26:11,00:26:13,bit of beef between them.
00:26:13,00:26:19,"And when Petronius Maximus took over, he forced Valentinians Widow to marry him and forced"
00:26:19,00:26:22,Valentinians daughter to marry his son.
00:26:22,00:26:28,And Valentinians daughter was supposed to get married to the king of the vandals son.
00:26:28,00:26:31,"And so the king of the vandals said, well, you know what, if you're going to cancel that"
00:26:31,00:26:33,"marriage, I'm going to cancel our deal."
00:26:33,00:26:37,And I'm going to come over and I'm going to sack your city and that's what he did.
00:26:37,00:26:41,"And then Petronius tried to run away from the vandals, but he was stoned by his own people"
00:26:41,00:26:42,and thrown into the tibre.
00:26:42,00:26:43,Nice.
00:26:43,00:26:44,I think it's fair.
00:26:44,00:26:45,I think it's completely fair.
00:26:45,00:26:46,There was a deal.
00:26:46,00:26:47,Petronius Maximus broke it.
00:26:47,00:26:49,The vandals had every right to sack the city.
00:26:49,00:26:50,Yeah.
00:26:50,00:26:51,Yeah.
00:26:51,00:26:52,"It's very game of Thrones, isn't it?"
00:26:52,00:26:53,It really is.
00:26:53,00:26:54,Yeah.
00:26:54,00:26:55,Yeah.
00:26:55,00:26:55,Yeah.
00:26:55,00:26:55,Yeah.
00:26:55,00:26:55,Yeah.
00:26:55,00:26:55,Yeah.
00:26:55,00:26:56,Yeah.
00:26:56,00:26:56,Yeah.
00:26:56,00:26:57,Yeah.
00:26:57,00:26:57,Yeah.
00:26:57,00:26:58,Yeah.
00:26:58,00:26:59,Yeah.
00:26:59,00:26:59,Yeah.
00:26:59,00:26:59,Yeah.
00:26:59,00:27:00,Yeah.
00:27:00,00:27:01,Yeah.
00:27:01,00:27:01,Yeah.
00:27:01,00:27:01,Yeah.
00:27:01,00:27:02,Yeah.
00:27:02,00:27:03,Yeah.
00:27:03,00:27:04,- It's not from the people they murdered.
00:27:04,00:27:06,- Apart from the people they murdered and the temple they were dead.
00:27:06,00:27:08,- It was literally just that they didn't break stuff.
00:27:08,00:27:08,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:27:08,00:27:12,"He was also the same Pope who talked supposedly,"
00:27:12,00:27:16,talked to Tilla the Hun out of actually coming to Rome at all.
00:27:16,00:27:18,"They sent him out, they knew Tilla was on the way,"
00:27:18,00:27:19,"and he met up with them and he said,"
00:27:19,00:27:20,"""Would you mind not coming?"""
00:27:20,00:27:21,"And Tilla went, ""Ah, okay."""
00:27:21,00:27:25,"And went off, there's two times that he's responsible for."
00:27:25,00:27:26,"- Yeah, I'll give you some--"
00:27:26,00:27:28,"- Don't feel like there's more to that story, isn't there?"
00:27:28,00:27:30,It feels like there must have been more to the conversation
00:27:30,00:27:31,than that.
00:27:31,00:27:32,- Yeah.
00:27:32,00:27:34,"- He's called a black male, a bribery."
00:27:34,00:27:36,"I think he came up and he said, ""You okay, Hun?"""
00:27:36,00:27:39,(laughing)
00:27:39,00:27:41,- He just burst into tears.
00:27:41,00:27:43,I didn't want to hurt anyone.
00:27:43,00:27:44,It's gone out of hand.
00:27:44,00:27:45,- I didn't know about sacking.
00:27:45,00:27:48,I don't know why he said sack places.
00:27:48,00:27:48,Why you sack places.
00:27:48,00:27:50,- Why do you sack places?
00:27:50,00:27:52,- You put everything in sacks when you're running off.
00:27:52,00:27:53,- Yes.
00:27:53,00:27:53,- Is it?
00:27:53,00:27:57,"- Yeah, it's from, I looked this up in the OED,"
00:27:57,00:27:59,"and it's from the Latin verb sacare,"
00:27:59,00:28:01,which means put it in a bag.
00:28:01,00:28:02,"- Nice, put it in a bag."
00:28:02,00:28:03,- Yeah.
00:28:03,00:28:05,"- Nothing, not everything fits in the sack."
00:28:05,00:28:07,"- All right, all right, clever plugs."
00:28:07,00:28:08,- Not just.
00:28:08,00:28:11,"- Yeah, I mean, they've got other things, right?"
00:28:11,00:28:12,- Maybe you've been using the miniature sacks
00:28:12,00:28:14,that the old sacks have been using.
00:28:14,00:28:15,(laughing)
00:28:15,00:28:19,- And then being a vandal was actually a good thing
00:28:19,00:28:21,"for quite a while, okay?"
00:28:21,00:28:24,"So people thought that the vandals were kind of cool,"
00:28:24,00:28:27,and a lot of royal families claimed dissent
00:28:27,00:28:28,from the vandals.
00:28:28,00:28:31,"The Swedish and the Danish royal families, for instance,"
00:28:31,00:28:34,continue to do so until only about 30 years or so ago.
00:28:34,00:28:35,- Wow.
00:28:35,00:28:39,"- But there was then a person called Henri Gregois,"
00:28:39,00:28:41,who was a Bishop of Bois.
00:28:41,00:28:43,"And he used, is that I pronounced that?"
00:28:43,00:28:44,- I pronounced that.
00:28:44,00:28:47,(laughing)
00:28:47,00:28:53,- He used the term in 1794 to describe the destruction
00:28:53,00:28:55,of artwork following the French Revolution.
00:28:55,00:28:57,And so that's when the word vandalism
00:28:57,00:29:00,became to mean sort of wrecking things.
00:29:00,00:29:01,- Really?
00:29:01,00:29:02,"- Yeah, he got obsessed with it, didn't he?"
00:29:02,00:29:04,- I read that there was no one to defend
00:29:04,00:29:07,"the good name of the vandals, because at the time,"
00:29:07,00:29:09,"there wasn't a geographical region,"
00:29:09,00:29:12,which was claiming dissent from them.
00:29:12,00:29:13,"Well, certainly not in that bit of France anyway."
00:29:13,00:29:14,"- Yeah, no, hadn't been for some time."
00:29:14,00:29:17,"But I mean, because they were quite crap in the end,"
00:29:17,00:29:18,and they didn't last very long.
00:29:18,00:29:20,"And actually, they should be grateful for De Bluah,"
00:29:20,00:29:22,"'cause otherwise we wouldn't remember them at all,"
00:29:22,00:29:23,I don't think.
00:29:23,00:29:25,"They pretty much lasted 100 years,"
00:29:25,00:29:27,"sort of fanning around in Carthagin,"
00:29:27,00:29:29,"bits of North Africa, and the Iberian Peninsula."
00:29:29,00:29:30,- Very often.
00:29:30,00:29:32,- Peace loving people.
00:29:32,00:29:34,- They were not a peace loving people.
00:29:34,00:29:36,- They were reasonably peace.
00:29:36,00:29:39,- I read it account where they butchered people up
00:29:39,00:29:41,into tiny little pieces of meat.
00:29:41,00:29:43,"- You were judging them by modern standards,"
00:29:43,00:29:45,"which is not the way it works, okay?"
00:29:45,00:29:46,- That's fair enough.
00:29:46,00:29:47,- They were all doing that in those days.
00:29:47,00:29:49,"- Exactly, thank you."
00:29:49,00:29:51,- Do you know who their main eyes were?
00:29:51,00:29:52,"- No, no."
00:29:52,00:29:54,- Who they were in coalition with was the Allens.
00:29:54,00:29:56,"It was the vandal for the Allens, yeah."
00:29:56,00:29:58,So the vandal kingdom was actually the vandal
00:29:58,00:30:00,than the Allen kingdom in.
00:30:00,00:30:05,- One more thing about the vandal is that George III married
00:30:05,00:30:08,"Charlotte of Mecklenburg, Strelitz."
00:30:08,00:30:10,And she claimed dissent from the vandals.
00:30:10,00:30:11,She was one of those.
00:30:11,00:30:14,So we briefly had a queen who was a vandal.
00:30:14,00:30:17,And it was really trendy at the time.
00:30:17,00:30:19,"And so in the late 1700s, they were going to make"
00:30:19,00:30:21,"a British colony in North America,"
00:30:21,00:30:23,which they were going to call Vandalia.
00:30:23,00:30:26,"And there are still places in America called Vandalia,"
00:30:26,00:30:28,including one city that was briefly the capital
00:30:28,00:30:30,of Illinois.
00:30:30,00:30:32,And sports teams from the University of Idaho
00:30:32,00:30:35,are always called the vandals because of this trendy time
00:30:35,00:30:37,when everyone was called vandals.
00:30:37,00:30:38,- That's awesome.
00:30:38,00:30:38,- It was really good.
00:30:38,00:30:40,"- Oh, they've left them mark."
00:30:40,00:30:41,- Yeah.
00:30:41,00:30:42,- Very odd way.
00:30:42,00:30:46,Can I have one favorite vandal who was the last king.
00:30:46,00:30:49,So the guy who snacked Rome was actually really good.
00:30:49,00:30:51,He was geyseric and he was impressive.
00:30:51,00:30:53,The last king was a guy called Gelemmer.
00:30:53,00:30:55,And he spent his whole time running away from people
00:30:55,00:30:58,who were trying to beat his armies and fleeing.
00:30:58,00:31:00,"And at one point, the only reason his life was saved was"
00:31:00,00:31:03,'cause it was always the Byzantins who were after him.
00:31:03,00:31:04,"At one point, the only reason his life was saved was"
00:31:04,00:31:07,"because he was fleeing John the Armenian,"
00:31:07,00:31:08,who was ruler.
00:31:08,00:31:10,- Where was he from?
00:31:10,00:31:12,(all laughing)
00:31:12,00:31:15,"- So he's fleeing John the Armenian, who was gonna get him,"
00:31:15,00:31:18,but then poor John the Armenian ended up being accidentally
00:31:18,00:31:20,killed by one of his own bodyguards who'd got pissed
00:31:20,00:31:22,and was trying to shoot a bird with an arrow
00:31:22,00:31:24,and accidentally got John instead.
00:31:24,00:31:25,- Wow.
00:31:25,00:31:26,- So Gelemmer escapes John.
00:31:26,00:31:28,"This is Gelemmer, Mr. Vandal."
00:31:28,00:31:31,And he fled to Algeria and he didn't like Algeria
00:31:31,00:31:33,because the diet was bad and they lived quite
00:31:33,00:31:35,ascetic lives and he was used to luxury.
00:31:35,00:31:38,"So then the ruler of the Byzantins said,"
00:31:38,00:31:39,"""Do you want a surrender then?"
00:31:39,00:31:40,"""If you hate it there, surrender to me."""
00:31:40,00:31:42,"And he sent a letter back saying,"
00:31:42,00:31:43,"""No, I refused a surrender,"
00:31:43,00:31:47,"""but please send me some bread, a sponge, and a liar."""
00:31:47,00:31:48,And he explained.
00:31:48,00:31:49,(all laughing)
00:31:49,00:31:52,- This is like a T-cosy or condom in a panning to men.
00:31:52,00:31:54,(all laughing)
00:31:54,00:31:57,- He was a distant ancestor of Clarkson.
00:31:57,00:31:58,"- When you say a lie,"
00:31:58,00:31:59,"you don't mean someone who turns up saying,"
00:31:59,00:32:01,"""I haven't brought a bread or a sponge."""
00:32:01,00:32:03,(all laughing)
00:32:03,00:32:06,- What are you holding my idea back then?
00:32:06,00:32:08,"No, he said he wanted the bread to eat."
00:32:08,00:32:10,He said he needed the sponge to wash his eyes
00:32:10,00:32:11,'cause they were so swollen with tears
00:32:11,00:32:13,'cause he was so unhappy.
00:32:13,00:32:15,And he said he wanted the liar to play
00:32:15,00:32:17,alongside a lament that he had composed
00:32:17,00:32:18,about what a tough time he was having.
00:32:18,00:32:22,And the leader of the Byzantins cried in sympathy
00:32:22,00:32:24,and sent him all the stuff he wanted.
00:32:24,00:32:25,"- Oh, that's good."
00:32:25,00:32:26,- Nice guy.
00:32:26,00:32:28,"- Now that is a peace-loving people,"
00:32:28,00:32:29,the Byzantine people.
00:32:29,00:32:31,(all laughing)
00:32:31,00:32:32,"- Well, that was Rome, wasn't it?"
00:32:32,00:32:36,I didn't realize that Rome didn't really collapse
00:32:36,00:32:38,until 1453 AD.
00:32:38,00:32:41,"But the Byzantines were the, is that the Eastern lot?"
00:32:41,00:32:42,And they called themselves the Romans.
00:32:42,00:32:45,"They did not see, they didn't say we are the Byzantine Empire"
00:32:45,00:32:47,and what a shame about Rome.
00:32:47,00:32:48,They completely saw themselves
00:32:48,00:32:50,as the continuation of the Roman Empire.
00:32:50,00:32:52,They just happened to all be Christians
00:32:52,00:32:53,and have moved with the times.
00:32:53,00:32:55,- It's weird 'cause we called the Christians Romans
00:32:55,00:32:56,for a bit.
00:32:56,00:32:57,"We just decided no, saw it."
00:32:57,00:32:58,As in 'cause these guys have been Christians
00:32:58,00:33:00,for a hundred years or so.
00:33:00,00:33:01,- Yeah.
00:33:01,00:33:03,"- Everyone's calling everyone stupid things, are they?"
00:33:03,00:33:04,(all laughing)
00:33:04,00:33:07,And everyone called everyone barbarians as well.
00:33:07,00:33:11,"So barbarian, the word barbarian comes from the Greeks"
00:33:11,00:33:14,"used it to mean anyone who wasn't Greek, right."
00:33:14,00:33:16,And they gave it the word because they thought
00:33:16,00:33:18,that everyone who spoke something that wasn't Greek
00:33:18,00:33:26,"was just going, (imitating barbarian music)"
00:33:26,00:33:30,and so then the Romans called all of the Germanic tribes
00:33:30,00:33:32,"barbarians, but actually the Romans were barbarians as well,"
00:33:32,00:33:34,according to the Greeks.
00:33:34,00:33:35,- Okay.
00:33:35,00:33:36,- They were all barbarians.
00:33:36,00:33:38,- The Greeks even called other Greeks barbarians.
00:33:38,00:33:39,- Did they?
00:33:39,00:33:41,"- So it was just people who didn't want exactly like you,"
00:33:41,00:33:43,"basically, was barbarian."
00:33:43,00:33:46,"And there's that weird folk etymology that it was,"
00:33:46,00:33:47,people who had bids.
00:33:47,00:33:48,- It was barbarian.
00:33:48,00:33:49,"- It was barbarian, but I don't think that is true."
00:33:49,00:33:50,"- Okay, no."
00:33:50,00:33:51,"- All right, we're just on beards."
00:33:51,00:33:55,"So there was something like, I read that was about seven sacks"
00:33:55,00:33:57,of Rome over a different periods of time.
00:33:57,00:34:00,"And in 1527, there was one, but that's post,"
00:34:00,00:34:03,"when you're saying Rome, the ancient Rome."
00:34:03,00:34:04,"- Yes, yes."
00:34:04,00:34:06,"- So, but it's still counted as Rome, I suppose."
00:34:06,00:34:07,"- Oh, it's still Rome."
00:34:07,00:34:07,- It's still Rome.
00:34:07,00:34:09,- It's still going into it.
00:34:09,00:34:09,"Congratulations, guys."
00:34:09,00:34:11,"- The city is still, is always Rome."
00:34:11,00:34:11,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:34:11,00:34:12,"- Okay, good."
00:34:12,00:34:13,"- I hope, 'cause I'm going next week,"
00:34:13,00:34:15,so it's gonna be very awkward if it disappeared
00:34:15,00:34:16,a thousand years ago.
00:34:16,00:34:19,"But so, 1527, it was sacked so bad."
00:34:19,00:34:21,"That was a really, really bad one."
00:34:21,00:34:22,It was a sacks city.
00:34:22,00:34:23,- Exactly.
00:34:23,00:34:24,"- Yeah, big sack."
00:34:24,00:34:26,"That's the Pope at the time, Clement VII,"
00:34:26,00:34:29,grew a beard in mourning.
00:34:29,00:34:31,It was sort of a display of mourning.
00:34:31,00:34:33,"And he had it until his death in 1534,"
00:34:33,00:34:37,but he kickstarted a trend amongst posts to have beards.
00:34:37,00:34:38,'Cause they didn't have beards up until that point.
00:34:38,00:34:40,"There were a few that had, but the idea is,"
00:34:40,00:34:43,"if you were a man of God, that you had to be clean shaven."
00:34:43,00:34:46,"But it was seen, he was so loved, I think,"
00:34:46,00:34:50,"that for 24 subsequent popes, they all had a beard."
00:34:50,00:34:51,- Right.
00:34:51,00:34:53,"- Yeah, so he started a trend of beards in popes, that's great."
00:34:53,00:34:56,"- Oh my God, so this whole hipster beard trend,"
00:34:56,00:34:58,we keep thinking he is gonna end clearly by dance face.
00:34:58,00:35:00,It doesn't seem like he is.
00:35:00,00:35:03,"This could go on for the length of 24 popes, range."
00:35:03,00:35:04,- Yeah.
00:35:04,00:35:05,- That's a long trend.
00:35:05,00:35:07,"- And if you want to be a man of God,"
00:35:07,00:35:08,then you can get your free trail set.
00:35:08,00:35:09,- Just spawn.
00:35:09,00:35:13,(laughs)
00:35:13,00:35:16,"- Okay, it is time for our final fact to the show,"
00:35:16,00:35:17,and that is my fact.
00:35:17,00:35:21,My fact this week is a people who have died from laughing
00:35:21,00:35:23,include a fifth century Greek artist
00:35:23,00:35:26,"who couldn't stop laughing at his own painting,"
00:35:26,00:35:29,and an Australian dog trainer who died after reading
00:35:29,00:35:32,the price difference of some commodities in 1915
00:35:32,00:35:34,as compared to 1920.
00:35:34,00:35:35,(laughs)
00:35:35,00:35:36,They're very funny price deals.
00:35:36,00:35:37,- Is that yes?
00:35:37,00:35:39,- Would the price gone down or up?
00:35:39,00:35:40,- I think they'd gone up.
00:35:40,00:35:42,- Has anyone looked at the price commodities
00:35:42,00:35:44,from 1915?
00:35:44,00:35:45,- I think you have.
00:35:45,00:35:46,(laughs)
00:35:46,00:35:49,"- Well, I just about managed to survive."
00:35:49,00:35:50,"No, I did."
00:35:50,00:35:52,"It was during the war, wasn't it?"
00:35:52,00:35:55,"So everything went up in price,"
00:35:55,00:35:58,including wheat that increased by over 50%
00:35:58,00:36:00,to more than six times the pre-war rate.
00:36:00,00:36:02,"- What, by 1920?"
00:36:02,00:36:04,"1915, that was."
00:36:04,00:36:06,"- Yeah, compared to 1920, though."
00:36:06,00:36:07,- I didn't check that.
00:36:07,00:36:08,"- Jane, you've just,"
00:36:08,00:36:11,"like, you've done a half the research here."
00:36:11,00:36:12,"No, one, do you haven't died laughing?"
00:36:12,00:36:14,(laughs)
00:36:14,00:36:15,"- That's the thing, it's dangerous, right?"
00:36:15,00:36:17,"We know it to be dangerous, so."
00:36:17,00:36:17,- Very risky.
00:36:17,00:36:19,- There are lots of stories on there
00:36:19,00:36:20,"about people dying laughing,"
00:36:20,00:36:22,"but there are a lot of them, a pinch of salt."
00:36:22,00:36:23,A lot of them seem to have had underlying
00:36:23,00:36:24,medical conditions.
00:36:24,00:36:25,- Yes.
00:36:25,00:36:26,- That would have been aggravated.
00:36:26,00:36:28,"- Absolutely, but they did go out still counts."
00:36:28,00:36:29,- In the last.
00:36:29,00:36:30,"- So nice, yeah."
00:36:30,00:36:32,- There's an ancient story about a seeer
00:36:32,00:36:35,"called Kalkas, who died after another seeer"
00:36:35,00:36:37,"had predicted his death,"
00:36:37,00:36:38,and then the other seeer had been proved wrong.
00:36:38,00:36:40,"His prediction had been so wrong,"
00:36:40,00:36:42,"and Kalkas laughed and laughed and laughed,"
00:36:42,00:36:43,and then died.
00:36:43,00:36:46,That's proving the prediction right.
00:36:46,00:36:48,Is it one of those bullet testicle baby stories?
00:36:48,00:36:51,"- I think a lot of these are, aren't they?"
00:36:51,00:36:52,- Yeah.
00:36:52,00:36:54,"- So, when you tell us the story of the Greek artist?"
00:36:54,00:36:57,- The Greek artist was called Zeusus.
00:36:57,00:36:58,Z-E-U-X-I-S.
00:36:58,00:36:59,- Zeusus.
00:36:59,00:37:01,- Zeusus?
00:37:01,00:37:02,- Like Zeusus.
00:37:02,00:37:03,- Zeusus.
00:37:03,00:37:05,- So the Greek artist is called Zeusus.
00:37:05,00:37:08,"- Phil century BC, was he from Manhattan?"
00:37:08,00:37:10,"- Yeah, he was a Marx brother."
00:37:10,00:37:12,He's Z-E-X-I-S.
00:37:12,00:37:15,- He's Z-E-X-I-S.
00:37:15,00:37:16,- He's coming around.
00:37:16,00:37:19,"- So he died laughing because he painted,"
00:37:19,00:37:21,'cause he heard you tried to pronounce his name.
00:37:21,00:37:24,(laughing)
00:37:24,00:37:27,He was painting the goddess Aphrodite.
00:37:27,00:37:28,Aphrodite?
00:37:28,00:37:31,Z-E-X-I-S and Aphrodite.
00:37:31,00:37:34,And the old woman who commissioned it from him
00:37:34,00:37:37,insisted that she be the model for the portrait.
00:37:37,00:37:38,Which he thought was ridiculous.
00:37:38,00:37:39,She didn't look like Aphrodite.
00:37:39,00:37:40,"So, he painted it."
00:37:40,00:37:42,"And I imagine it as he got to the end,"
00:37:42,00:37:43,final dab on the painting.
00:37:43,00:37:44,He stood back.
00:37:44,00:37:46,He thought this is so ridiculous
00:37:46,00:37:50,that he went into laughter convulsions and died.
00:37:50,00:37:52,"Is the story that we, that we, to believe."
00:37:52,00:37:53,- That's good.
00:37:53,00:37:54,- Yeah.
00:37:54,00:37:55,"- When she got the painting for free,"
00:37:55,00:37:56,"you just take it away, wouldn't you?"
00:37:56,00:37:57,- Yeah.
00:37:57,00:37:58,- Roll it up.
00:37:58,00:37:59,(laughing)
00:37:59,00:38:01,- He's amazing those who exist.
00:38:01,00:38:03,"There's one story that's related by plenty of the elder,"
00:38:03,00:38:06,"which is that he was,"
00:38:06,00:38:08,he basically got into an art battle
00:38:08,00:38:12,with another massive painter of the time.
00:38:12,00:38:12,- What was it called?
00:38:12,00:38:14,- He was called Pahasius.
00:38:14,00:38:18,"So, Zwiexus and Pahasius decided to have an art off."
00:38:18,00:38:20,"And they arrived to this battle,"
00:38:20,00:38:23,both bringing the best painting that they could possibly do.
00:38:23,00:38:28,"So, Zwiexus pulls back his painting to reveal grapes."
00:38:28,00:38:30,"So he pulls a little sheet away, grapes are there."
00:38:30,00:38:32,The grapes are said to be so real
00:38:32,00:38:34,that birds fly down from the sky
00:38:34,00:38:36,and start pecking at the painting.
00:38:36,00:38:37,- Really?
00:38:37,00:38:38,"- Huge, huge deal is doing really well."
00:38:38,00:38:40,"Pahasius then says,"
00:38:40,00:38:43,"""Okay, well let me unveil my painting,"""
00:38:43,00:38:44,"which is behind these curtains,"
00:38:44,00:38:47,only to reveal that the curtains themselves
00:38:47,00:38:49,are the painting so real.
00:38:49,00:38:50,- Oh M.G. - Yeah.
00:38:50,00:38:52,- Is an illusion.
00:38:52,00:38:53,And he won.
00:38:53,00:38:54,He beat Zwiexus.
00:38:54,00:38:55,- Yeah.
00:38:55,00:38:57,- I heard that Zwiexus was the one who was trying
00:38:57,00:38:59,to push the cloth away.
00:38:59,00:39:00,"- Oh, right."
00:39:00,00:39:01,- Pahasius is painting.
00:39:01,00:39:02,- Okay.
00:39:02,00:39:03,"- And so he was like,"
00:39:03,00:39:04,"""I'm going to show what yours looks like"
00:39:04,00:39:06,"and he couldn't do it because it was painted on the..."""
00:39:06,00:39:07,- That makes sense.
00:39:07,00:39:08,- That's astonishing.
00:39:08,00:39:10,- There's another anecdote that says
00:39:10,00:39:12,he drew a boy holding the grapes
00:39:12,00:39:15,"and the bird came down to try and peck the grapes,"
00:39:15,00:39:16,but he was really unhappy about that.
00:39:16,00:39:18,Why might that be?
00:39:18,00:39:20,- Who Zwiexus was unhappy?
00:39:20,00:39:20,- Yes.
00:39:20,00:39:22,- Was he his painting?
00:39:22,00:39:23,- No.
00:39:23,00:39:25,He was unhappy with his own skill.
00:39:25,00:39:27,- Because the bird wasn't scared of the boy?
00:39:27,00:39:28,- Exactly.
00:39:28,00:39:30,"Yeah, so the grapes were good enough,"
00:39:30,00:39:32,but obviously the boy wasn't good enough
00:39:32,00:39:34,'cause the birds weren't scared.
00:39:34,00:39:35,I'm liking that.
00:39:35,00:39:36,- You're embarrassing.
00:39:36,00:39:37,- I can't.
00:39:37,00:39:40,- There are a few more famous ancients who died laughing.
00:39:40,00:39:43,"So my favorite, which I think I read in Mary Bid's book,"
00:39:43,00:39:46,was the fact that two famous figures in ancient Greece
00:39:46,00:39:49,were separately recorded as having died laughing
00:39:49,00:39:52,after seeing a donkey eating figs and drinking wine.
00:39:52,00:39:53,- Okay.
00:39:53,00:39:54,- It's funny.
00:39:54,00:39:55,- It's very funny.
00:39:55,00:39:55,- It's ridiculous.
00:39:55,00:39:57,It's obviously the same story that's been pitched
00:39:57,00:39:58,by two people.
00:39:58,00:40:01,"So there's one of them, which is--"
00:40:01,00:40:04,- It could be one very funny donkey doing the rounds.
00:40:04,00:40:06,- The greatest comedian of the third century BC.
00:40:06,00:40:07,- You have a lovely donkey of death.
00:40:07,00:40:09,- It could have been an Irishman in a donkey's seat.
00:40:09,00:40:10,(laughing)
00:40:10,00:40:12,- Just trying to say let me out.
00:40:12,00:40:14,They didn't speak Irish in ancient Greece.
00:40:14,00:40:18,So one was recorded by Valerius Maximus
00:40:18,00:40:20,"in the first century AD,"
00:40:20,00:40:24,but it was talking about Philharmon in the third century BC
00:40:24,00:40:27,"who had, so he was this master chap"
00:40:27,00:40:30,and his slave had put figs in the room with him
00:40:30,00:40:33,and he watched a donkey start eating the figs
00:40:33,00:40:35,and he was quite pissed off so he called his slave
00:40:35,00:40:37,"and said come here, chase that donkey away."
00:40:37,00:40:38,I don't know why he couldn't get up
00:40:38,00:40:40,and chase the donkey away himself.
00:40:40,00:40:41,And the slave took a while to arrive.
00:40:41,00:40:43,So by the time the slave had got there
00:40:43,00:40:45,"to chase the donkey away, all the figs had gone."
00:40:45,00:40:48,"So Philharmon said, well you might as well"
00:40:48,00:40:50,now give the donkey some wine.
00:40:50,00:40:51,(laughing)
00:40:51,00:40:52,'Cause he had a joke about how--
00:40:52,00:40:53,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:40:53,00:40:55,- And then he found himself so hilarious
00:40:55,00:40:58,"that he laughed, that he died apparently"
00:40:58,00:41:01,crushing his feeble windpipe with his own panting.
00:41:01,00:41:02,And then-- - What?
00:41:02,00:41:05,"- Can I just say, so he was laughing at his own joke?"
00:41:05,00:41:07,"- Yeah, absolutely, yeah."
00:41:07,00:41:08,- He was a funny guy.
00:41:08,00:41:10,And then exactly the same thing is told about the stoic
00:41:10,00:41:12,for lots of a chrysopus.
00:41:12,00:41:14,Apparently he died laughing at the very similar joke
00:41:14,00:41:19,that he told when a donkey was quoting his figs.
00:41:19,00:41:21,"- Yeah, maybe it was just the classic funny thing"
00:41:21,00:41:24,and that doesn't quite translate these days.
00:41:24,00:41:27,"- It can't do, there must be something we're missing."
00:41:27,00:41:29,"- Well, or it's like exactly what Anna says,"
00:41:29,00:41:30,it's just one story.
00:41:30,00:41:31,(laughing)
00:41:31,00:41:34,"- I think it's very funny, it's a funny joke."
00:41:34,00:41:37,- Someone else who supposedly died laughing
00:41:37,00:41:41,"was Anthony Trollop, and he was supposedly reading"
00:41:41,00:41:44,"a book called ""Vice Versa, a Lesson to Fathers"""
00:41:44,00:41:48,"by F. Anstey, and he found a bin in it"
00:41:48,00:41:50,that was so funny that he died laughing.
00:41:50,00:41:51,But what I found really interesting
00:41:51,00:41:54,"is that this is a really old book,"
00:41:54,00:41:59,but it's about a businessman who finds an Indian magic stone
00:41:59,00:42:01,and swaps body with his young son.
00:42:01,00:42:03,He's basically freaky Friday.
00:42:03,00:42:05,"- Wow, that's great."
00:42:05,00:42:08,"- Big, all these movies, it's been going on 30."
00:42:08,00:42:09,- Yeah.
00:42:09,00:42:12,"- My, as yet, unpicked up screenplay, ""The Wrong Tree,"""
00:42:12,00:42:14,which is a dog body swap comedy.
00:42:14,00:42:15,- Or does he swap with a tree?
00:42:15,00:42:17,"- No, two dogs swap with each other."
00:42:17,00:42:18,- All right.
00:42:18,00:42:19,- But one of them is a big scary dog
00:42:19,00:42:22,and one of them is a small lap dog.
00:42:22,00:42:23,- Why is it the wrong tree?
00:42:23,00:42:25,"- 'Cause they've both been, 'cause this is a magic tree,"
00:42:25,00:42:28,which they're both running round.
00:42:28,00:42:29,"- God, I thought this was a joke,"
00:42:29,00:42:31,but actually it's becoming apparent
00:42:31,00:42:32,that you've actually got this.
00:42:32,00:42:33,"- No, no, I want to jump in and say,"
00:42:33,00:42:34,"let's not indulge it,"
00:42:34,00:42:35,'cause it's can go on for half an hour.
00:42:35,00:42:36,It's really detailed.
00:42:36,00:42:37,"- I've got the copy right,"
00:42:37,00:42:38,"just to make that very, very clear."
00:42:38,00:42:41,- What about two grizzly bears who swap bodies
00:42:41,00:42:42,with each other?
00:42:42,00:42:43,(laughing)
00:42:43,00:42:45,"- What, what was the mechanism by me?"
00:42:45,00:42:50,(laughing)
00:42:50,00:42:53,"- I got more recent one that's happened, 1988."
00:42:53,00:42:54,Someone passed away from laughing
00:42:54,00:42:57,while they were watching a fish called Wanda.
00:42:57,00:42:58,And they were watching a scene. - Funny film.
00:42:58,00:43:00,"- Yeah, funny film. - Yeah."
00:43:00,00:43:01,They were watching a scene where Michael Palin
00:43:01,00:43:04,get some french fries stuffed up his nose.
00:43:04,00:43:06,So Michael Palin through a bit of comedy
00:43:06,00:43:07,led to someone's death.
00:43:07,00:43:10,And what is amazing about that is in the very first episode
00:43:10,00:43:12,"of Monty Python, Palin was part of the team"
00:43:12,00:43:14,that wrote about the funniest joke ever
00:43:14,00:43:15,that was used in war.
00:43:15,00:43:18,"And it kind of life-imitated art there, really."
00:43:18,00:43:21,"- On QI, the TV show that we all work for."
00:43:21,00:43:24,"Someone wrote to us, probably about 10 years ago,"
00:43:24,00:43:26,"maybe longer, I think it's before all you guys,"
00:43:26,00:43:29,all you two started and when Dan was still there.
00:43:29,00:43:32,And they said that their father was watching QI
00:43:32,00:43:33,and died laughing.
00:43:33,00:43:34,- No. - Yeah.
00:43:34,00:43:36,"- And it was obviously said that the father had died,"
00:43:36,00:43:38,but actually he really loved the show
00:43:38,00:43:40,and it was a fitting thing to happen.
00:43:40,00:43:42,- Do we know which moment?
00:43:42,00:43:44,Was it where the apocalypse is?
00:43:44,00:43:45,- So they're not specifying?
00:43:45,00:43:46,"- No, it was before that."
00:43:46,00:43:48,I think it was when we brought a donkey on
00:43:48,00:43:49,in theettes of things.
00:43:49,00:43:51,(laughing)
00:43:51,00:43:53,"- It was either the D series or the F series,"
00:43:53,00:43:55,apparently none of that.
00:43:55,00:43:56,"But yeah, that's, that happened."
00:43:56,00:43:57,- That's very cool.
00:43:57,00:43:59,- How nice that he wrote in to say that as well.
00:43:59,00:44:02,- But laughing was often seen as not a good thing
00:44:02,00:44:03,to be doing.
00:44:03,00:44:06,So there are lots of people who prescribed against it.
00:44:06,00:44:09,There was a 16th century doctor called La Joubert
00:44:09,00:44:11,who described laughter as quite a dangerous thing
00:44:11,00:44:13,'cause it could bring on fits and fainting and stuff.
00:44:13,00:44:16,And he described it as laughter.
00:44:16,00:44:18,"He defined as sparkling of eyes,"
00:44:18,00:44:21,"redness of face, sweat coming out of the entire body."
00:44:21,00:44:23,"If the use of tears, rising of veins"
00:44:23,00:44:25,and emptying of bowels and bladder.
00:44:25,00:44:27,(laughing)
00:44:27,00:44:28,"- Wow, that's why it's so dangerous"
00:44:28,00:44:30,taking a cleaning job at Drongless.
00:44:30,00:44:33,'Cause people emptied their bowels and bladder
00:44:33,00:44:34,with their laughter.
00:44:34,00:44:35,- Is that a comedy club?
00:44:35,00:44:36,"- Yes, it's a comedy club."
00:44:36,00:44:37,"- Sorry, that was really funny,"
00:44:37,00:44:40,but I was just trying to hold control of my bowels and bladder.
00:44:40,00:44:41,(laughing)
00:44:41,00:44:44,- Supposedly Newton never laughed.
00:44:44,00:44:47,There's a story that says that he only laughed once
00:44:47,00:44:48,"in his life when he was asked,"
00:44:48,00:44:50,what is the point of studying Euclid?
00:44:50,00:44:53,- It's classic.
00:44:53,00:44:54,- That is a funny one.
00:44:54,00:44:57,- And someone who doesn't laugh is called an age elast.
00:44:57,00:44:58,- Not really.
00:44:58,00:45:01,- I love the word gelastic laughing related.
00:45:01,00:45:03,So I think there are people who have sort of
00:45:03,00:45:05,gelastic seizures where they can't prevent themselves
00:45:05,00:45:07,laughing even if the occasion doesn't call for it
00:45:07,00:45:08,or if it's very inappropriate.
00:45:08,00:45:09,- That's right.
00:45:09,00:45:10,And someone who's a misal gelast is someone
00:45:10,00:45:12,who hates laughter.
00:45:12,00:45:13,- Is that so?
00:45:13,00:45:15,- Gets really annoyed but gets irritated by it.
00:45:15,00:45:18,- It was also someone who loves that Japanese soup.
00:45:18,00:45:20,(laughing)
00:45:20,00:45:23,"- I have a study, another study on laughter,"
00:45:23,00:45:27,which found that the best way to make a baby laugh.
00:45:27,00:45:28,- Oh yeah.
00:45:28,00:45:29,- Yeah.
00:45:29,00:45:30,"- And this works, baby's between about six months and two years."
00:45:30,00:45:31,- Should we guess?
00:45:31,00:45:31,- Yeah.
00:45:31,00:45:33,"- Did they, are they ticklish?"
00:45:33,00:45:34,"- Oh, okay."
00:45:34,00:45:37,So this is normal comedy club rules that you can't tickle
00:45:37,00:45:38,the audience.
00:45:38,00:45:41,(laughing)
00:45:41,00:45:43,"- And not used to do that, even if tickles."
00:45:43,00:45:45,"- Okay, so is it, yeah, done."
00:45:45,00:45:47,Did you say peekaboo?
00:45:47,00:45:49,"- Peekaboo, but I have a son so I've tested."
00:45:49,00:45:50,"- Yeah, I'm making life."
00:45:50,00:45:52,- Have you tested the other methods?
00:45:52,00:45:54,"- Okay, so scientists measured what made babies laugh"
00:45:54,00:45:58,"and they tried four methods, one of which was peekaboo."
00:45:58,00:46:01,"One of which, putting a cup on your head."
00:46:01,00:46:03,"- Okay, I've done that."
00:46:03,00:46:04,- That is funny.
00:46:04,00:46:04,- That is really funny.
00:46:04,00:46:07,"- James is doing it now, and I'm laughing."
00:46:07,00:46:11,- And I'm now just wondering how flat James's head must be.
00:46:11,00:46:12,- Still sitting there.
00:46:12,00:46:14,- I don't think I can really talk properly.
00:46:14,00:46:17,"- Oh, okay, keep it there, keep it there."
00:46:17,00:46:18,So one of them is putting a cup on your head.
00:46:18,00:46:20,One of them is pretending a toy animal
00:46:20,00:46:21,is making the wrong noise.
00:46:21,00:46:22,Have you tried that?
00:46:22,00:46:24,"Taking a toy cat and going, no."
00:46:24,00:46:26,"Okay, that's worth trying."
00:46:26,00:46:28,And then the last one is apparently stuffing your mouth
00:46:28,00:46:31,"with material, just like filling your mouth with cloth."
00:46:31,00:46:34,"- Okay, apparently there are five categories"
00:46:34,00:46:37,of action type laughter.
00:46:37,00:46:39,"So there are categories of verbal laughter,"
00:46:39,00:46:40,like types of joke that make you laugh.
00:46:40,00:46:42,And then things you can do to make someone laugh.
00:46:42,00:46:45,This I should specify is according to this 16th century
00:46:45,00:46:49,"doctor, called Lauren Zubat, who had disapproved of laughter."
00:46:49,00:46:52,"But he said, laughter is divided into five categories."
00:46:52,00:46:55,Category number one is exposure of the genitals.
00:46:55,00:46:56,(laughing)
00:46:56,00:46:57,- One whole category.
00:46:57,00:47:01,"- Can it, it's an old faithful Louis C. K. Rides again."
00:47:01,00:47:03,(laughing)
00:47:03,00:47:05,"- Category number two, a separate category,"
00:47:05,00:47:07,exposure of the arse.
00:47:07,00:47:10,"Different, different kind of humor altogether."
00:47:10,00:47:11,- It is different.
00:47:11,00:47:12,"- Category number three is a pratful,"
00:47:12,00:47:14,which is falling on the arse.
00:47:14,00:47:17,And then there are two more which are unrelated.
00:47:17,00:47:19,"Misapprehension of taste, so mistaking something"
00:47:19,00:47:21,that smells really bad for something
00:47:21,00:47:22,that smells really good.
00:47:22,00:47:25,- And stuffing your mouth full of cloth.
00:47:25,00:47:28,(laughing)
00:47:28,00:47:29,- That's correct.
00:47:29,00:47:30,I just love that.
00:47:30,00:47:33,Drop moaning someone and showing your testicles
00:47:33,00:47:37,or founding two completely different categories of comedy.
00:47:37,00:47:37,(laughing)
00:47:37,00:47:39,"- They hated the category one stuff tonight,"
00:47:39,00:47:41,but they really went for the category two.
00:47:41,00:47:43,(laughing)
00:47:43,00:47:45,(upbeat music)
00:47:45,00:47:48,"- Okay, that's it."
00:47:48,00:47:49,That is all of our facts.
