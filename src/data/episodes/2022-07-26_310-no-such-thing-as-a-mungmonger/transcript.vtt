00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 [in the background]

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:19.560
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.680
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covenant Garden.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:23.980
 My name is Dan Schlieber.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:29.600
 I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, Anichezinski and James Harkin, and once again we

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.360
 have gathered around the microphones of our four favourite facts from the last seven

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.200
 days, and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.200
 Starting with you, Anna.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.880
 My fact this week is that travelling salesmen used to carry around miniature versions of

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.680
 everything they were selling.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.680
 Right.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:48.680
 Such an amazing fact.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.080
 It is so cool.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.080
 So I found this.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.120
 I don't know how I ended up on this site, but I was on Tim's antique site.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:01.520
 Tim's very well-respected antique stealers, and they had an article which was titled, "What

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.920
 is miniature furniture?"

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.440
 And it started by saying this question has been asked time and time again for Tim and

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:09.440
 Tim again.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:17.120
 Tim's and Tim's again, and it says there's a whole myriad of answers, but we're here

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.840
 to answer definitively, and they said, "The vast majority of miniature furniture that

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.080
 you see in antique places was carried around by travelling salesmen because if you

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.840
 are going around the country, you're going to be away for weeks and weeks away from your

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.060
 workshop, then obviously it's a hassle to take all the full-size stuff with you."

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.120
 So they made up tiny samples, but perfectly sculpted samples.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.500
 So incredibly good quality, you know, with the proper materials, well, but together samples.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.920
 But there were so many different things they tried this way.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.520
 So there are amazing pages online of, there's a great website called Collectors Weekly,

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.840
 which has a load of samples.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:49.840
 It's so good.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:56.040
 There were stoves, there were mini stoves and sewing machines and telephones, coffins.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.040
 You can, I found on eBay in America, there's one going at the moment.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.280
 It's eight inches long, it's selling for a few hundred dollars, and it's a travelling

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.280
 salesman's coffin.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.280
 Oh, okay.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.880
 As in a, it's a proper antique travelling salesman, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:08.880
 Yeah, exactly.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.680
 Have you seen the stuff that undertakers would take with them?

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.800
 Because it was not only, they'd have a briefcase full of miniature coffins, but you can also

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.720
 get, as antiques, their briefcase of a graveyard plot.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.720
 And again, if you go online, you open up the briefcase and it's proper fake grass around

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:25.720
 it.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.200
 And then it's got the grave stone as they would suggest that they'll make up your grave

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.200
 so you wouldn't die.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.200
 Wow.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.200
 That's so cool.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.160
 And is there a sort of a, a horse and you roleplay the whole event?

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.160
 I don't know.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.160
 Maybe they did.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.720
 I didn't see any briefcases with the miniature horse in them.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:47.040
 You could in the late 19th century by miniature step ladders and ironing boards.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.040
 And this was from a guy called Holy Kirk Christianson in Denmark.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.320
 And he had a woodworking company and he was making these step ladders and ironing boards.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.680
 But then he thought, you know what, I prefer making these little things and making the big

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.680
 things.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.200
 Why don't I start a company where I make lots of little things and he started the Lego

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.200
 company?

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.200
 No.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.200
 Isn't that cool?

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.200
 That's very cool.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.040
 He started off making miniature things with travelling salesmen and then he became a Lego

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.040
 guy.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.040
 That's so cool.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.040
 That is amazing.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.520
 So these don't, because there were a lot of sort of miniature version tallies back in history,

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.040
 kind of like, I guess, how Lego came out, miniature gilletines from the French Revolution.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.040
 Yeah.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.680
 This is during the French Revolution.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.760
 They used to sell them for kids to play with and with, and you sold dolls with it.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:29.760
 You sold dolls with them?

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:30.760
 You would chop your dolls head off.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:31.760
 No.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:32.760
 Yes.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.160
 But if you don't have it, if you're too poor to afford the dolls, you can just put your

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.160
 fingers through it.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.160
 It makes you kind of finger-puff it.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.920
 You did use to get those gilletines that you put your fingers in, didn't you?

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.240
 Like in a magic set and stuff.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.240
 Yeah.

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.240
 And then it looks like you're going to chop them off and you don't actually chop them off.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.240
 Yeah.

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:51.600
 Imagine if one in every ten gilletines was one of those and so it means that some people

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.600
 get away from their crimes.

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:53.600
 Like the opposite.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:54.600
 On real gilletines.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:55.600
 Yeah.

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.600
 That was really nice.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:57.600
 Russian reprieve.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:58.600
 Yeah.

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:03.160
 There was another reason for having miniature furniture that sometimes wasn't to show

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.920
 off your furniture and that was if it was practice furniture.

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.760
 So this is something if you're an antique dealer, you get good at distinguishing the proper

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.640
 miniatures from the apprentice pieces, so you can also buy them.

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.160
 And it's if you're auditioning an apprentice and then the craftsman would give the apprentice

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.400
 a really cheap, crappy piece of wood and say, "Make something awesome out of this."

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.400
 Completely understand.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.240
 When you said practice furniture, I thought it was something you practiced sitting on.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.440
 Oh, you got your real chair.

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.240
 You can't contrast it with a real chair.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.240
 It's a cotton wool one.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.080
 Would those apprentice pieces go out on the road as well?

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.080
 No.

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.080
 Ah, okay.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.080
 No, they're just for the workshop.

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.080
 And then it kind of stopped, didn't it?

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.960
 Once we got photos, people just said round castle looks.

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.200
 Although you still get people selling things dorset, don't you?

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:50.040
 In 2010, in the UK, the dorset, dorset sales sector was officially valued at 4.7 billion

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:55.360
 a year in the UK, and that's only the legitimate things because people are obviously selling

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.960
 other things dorset, and in 2012, the number of complaints about dodgy dorset sales hit

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:06.840
 a record high with 35,000 complaints made, so people are still doing this all the time.

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:11.800
 I didn't know that you are technically a peddler, P-E-D-L-A-R.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.560
 I didn't know that peddler was still a trade as in it's still properly termed, but you need

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.560
 a peddler's license to peddle.

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.560
 Because it's such an old fashioned term.

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:20.560
 Exactly, yeah.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:26.000
 But you go to your local police authority and you tell them who you are, and you have to

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.440
 have lived in the area for a little while, I think, and it costs Â£12.25 to get a year's

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:31.440
 license peddling.

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:32.440
 Does it?

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:33.440
 Yeah.

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:34.440
 Wow.

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:35.960
 It just shows, like, obviously, what a common profession it was.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:42.000
 How many synonyms there are for this job, so you could be a monger, obviously, and you could

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 be a solicitor.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 That was an old word for it.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 It was a lawyer.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000
 A cost of monger.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000
 You don't want to confuse those, though.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 I don't.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000
 My solicitor will be here in a minute.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.200
 I'll be back soon with a load of dishcloths.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.200
 (LAUGHTER)

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.200
 The tiny little judges chair.

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.200
 Yeah.

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:04.240
 Just to see what you're saying before monger, like, because obviously you have fish mongers

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.280
 and cuss mongers and all that kind of stuff.

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.160
 Would they dot-dot things, or is that just a seller of things, or what?

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:14.080
 I think it was a seller of things, but then it would often, like you say, the mongers coming

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:15.480
 down the street now.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:16.480
 Cool.

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:20.480
 I've never heard it on its own without some kind of noun before it.

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.480
 No.

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:22.480
 Well, you don't mong nothing.

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.600
 So that's why it's often proceeded with the thing you're monging.

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.200
 What do you do if you sell mong beans?

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.200
 (LAUGHTER)

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.200
 A mong monger.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:30.200
 A mong monger.

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.200
 A monger.

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:34.000
 Oh, that mong monger's a real monger.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000
 (LAUGHTER)

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.960
 But yeah, you had, so in the, in the olden days, there are some peddlers that you don't

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:40.960
 have as much today.

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.960
 You had the tooth puller, and that was quite common.

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.360
 You'd have the tooth pullers who'd come around and bang on your door to pull your teeth

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.360
 out.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:47.360
 Okay.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:48.360
 Or wouldn't get off the horse.

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:49.360
 Would they tie your tooth to the door?

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.160
 Well, that's what you do, wouldn't you?

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.360
 You would tie your tooth to the door, and then when they open the door, they pull your

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:55.360
 tooth out.

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:56.360
 (LAUGHTER)

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.360
 You don't have to pay them anymore.

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:58.360
 (LAUGHTER)

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:59.360
 So you don't open the door until they've said who they are.

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:02.360
 They say it's the tooth puller, and you go, "Hang on a sec."

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:03.360
 (LAUGHTER)

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:08.280
 I think they tied it to the horse, because it just, it's just a specific that they don't

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:09.280
 get off their horse.

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:10.280
 It's quite a lot.

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:13.280
 So I imagine maybe they tie it to the reins of the horse and gallop away, or something?

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:14.280
 No.

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:15.280
 Come on.

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:18.040
 And then it's like galloping off of you still attached to it, like you're a just married

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.040
 car or something.

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.040
 (LAUGHTER)

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:22.240
 It's not as wobbly as I thought.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:23.240
 (LAUGHTER)

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:26.640
 The tooth pullers, as well as being tooth pullers, were often travelling dentists.

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:31.320
 And you can also get some of the dentist kits, so they would have a whole selection of teeth.

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:35.520
 And because it was the 19th century, the teeth would be graded from sort of just light yellow

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.280
 to very dark, brownish, black.

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:40.880
 And they'd come to replace your teeth, so they'd open their briefcase and be like, "Hey,

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:41.880
 which do you want?"

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:42.880
 And you'd say, "Oh, that nice yellow one."

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:44.960
 And they'd say, "Mmm, I think, maybe more."

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:46.960
 Maybe she looks colour-chart, but...

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:47.960
 Yeah.

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:48.960
 Well, all the colours are just...

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:49.960
 (LAUGHTER)

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:57.960
 So, one famous travelling salesman of history was Jeremy Clarkson's dad, and he was

00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:58.960
 famous, was he?

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:02.600
 Well, he is now, I would say, as the father of Jeremy Clarkson.

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:03.600
 Okay.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:08.000
 But Jeremy Clarkson's dad, in fact, I think his parents, they specialised in selling teacosies.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.200
 Didn't they sell Paddington Bear or something?

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:12.200
 Yeah, they did.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:16.240
 And Jeremy Clarkson's first job was going door to door, so...

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.240
 This Paddington Bear!

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:18.240
 (LAUGHTER)

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:20.240
 Exactly that.

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:22.840
 He was a travelling salesman, selling Paddington Bear.

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:23.840
 And teacosies.

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:25.480
 What do we have combination of things to be selling?

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:26.480
 I know.

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:28.720
 Do they have a range of stuff in between Paddington Bear and teacosies?

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:33.160
 There are sources on the line that say condoms, but that seems like such a strange third element

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:34.160
 to add to the mix.

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:37.080
 Well, all these says to me is they must have been woolen cognomps.

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:38.080
 Yeah.

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:41.320
 A teacosie for some people is a condom for others.

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:42.320
 (LAUGHTER)

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:44.320
 It was the slogan on their van.

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:46.320
 (LAUGHTER)

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:50.480
 I can't believe that you would have a firm selling teacosies Paddington Bear or condoms,

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:51.480
 because it's two...

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:52.480
 One of them is too sexy.

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:53.480
 Yeah.

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:54.480
 Smaller condoms.

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:55.480
 (LAUGHTER)

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:57.960
 Some stuff on small things, very quickly.

00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:58.960
 Oh, yeah.

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:05.960
 So, this year, in fact last year, there was the world's biggest ever historical tabletop

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:06.960
 war game.

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:07.960
 Cool.

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:10.520
 So, do you know what I mean by that, because then you look confused.

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:11.520
 Yeah, so...

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:15.280
 I don't think either of them knows, because they both said the word cool after what you said.

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:16.280
 So...

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:17.280
 Was it recreating a real battle?

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:19.520
 It's recreating a real battle with little soldiers.

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:21.560
 It's kind of like poor hammer, basically.

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:25.200
 Like that, not with orcs, with actual people.

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.200
 Boring.

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:27.200
 (LAUGHTER)

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:32.760
 So, there was more than 20,000 miniature soldiers, and it was at the University of Glasgow and

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:39.600
 they replayed the Battle of Waterloo on a 192 square metre historical map.

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:44.400
 And it took them a year to paint all the soldiers, this group of over 100 people.

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:48.480
 They'd been investigating the archaeology of the Waterloo Battlefield since 2015.

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:49.480
 Wow.

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:51.480
 And then they did this game.

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:57.400
 And there were 4,000 casualties in the battle, and the Allies won.

00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:58.400
 Because it wasn't definite.

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:01.240
 They were going to do it properly, like a proper game, and it could have been that Napoleon

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:02.240
 would have won it.

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:03.240
 Oh.

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:04.640
 But the Allies won.

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:09.360
 And at one stage, the Duke of Wellington in the battle had a traffic cone on his head.

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:10.360
 (LAUGHTER)

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:14.280
 Because in Glasgow, which is where it was, famously, there's a statue there where they

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:15.960
 always put a traffic cone on them.

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:16.960
 That's so funny.

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:17.960
 That's so cool.

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:21.280
 Yeah, although that bit not historically accurate, right?

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:22.280
 Oh.

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:24.160
 I'm not sure they even had traffic cones.

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:25.160
 No.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:26.160
 They've misread tricorn.

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:27.160
 It's been misplaced.

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:28.160
 They've come right on the way.

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:29.160
 (LAUGHTER)

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.160
 And do you know who invented, sorry, just while I'm on the subject.

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:34.800
 Do you know who invented the first set of rules for playing with toy soldiers?

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:35.800
 Ooh.

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:37.120
 Is there someone we would have heard of?

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:38.120
 Yes.

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:39.600
 Jeremy Clarkson's dad, isn't it?

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:40.920
 It's not, though.

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:41.920
 It's his mum.

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:42.920
 No, it's not.

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:44.560
 He's the novelist H.G. Wells.

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:45.560
 What?

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:46.960
 He did that yet.

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:51.600
 In 1913, he wrote a book called Little Wars, which had the first ever set of rules for

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:53.680
 playing with toy soldiers.

00:10:53.680 --> 00:11:00.960
 And the full title of the book was Little Wars, a game for boys from 12 years of age to 150.

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:05.360
 And for that more intelligent sort of girl who likes boys, games and books.

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:06.360
 (LAUGHTER)

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:08.760
 I've never met such a woman.

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:17.200
 OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is Andy.

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:20.640
 My fact is, that female grizzly bears can get half pregnant.

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:21.640
 Mm-hmm.

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:22.640
 Mm-hmm.

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:23.640
 Intriguing.

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:24.640
 What does that mean?

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:32.600
 It means they get pregnant, or they are fertilised, they're exorfertilised by a male during

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:33.600
 mating.

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:37.200
 And then they don't do anything about it.

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:38.200
 Several months.

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:39.200
 OK.

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:40.200
 Lazy.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:44.880
 The egg is fertilised, and it turns into this tiny bundle of cells called a blastocyst.

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:45.880
 And that's normal.

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:46.960
 We have those, too.

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:52.200
 But in almost all mammals, that then develops into an embryo.

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:56.880
 But in bears, it just floats around in their uterus, doing absolutely nothing for months

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:58.480
 on end.

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:02.640
 And then the bears put on weight for winter, because they need to hibernate.

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:05.200
 They see how much weight they gain.

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:10.520
 And if they're up to the right level of body fat by the autumn, if they're 24% body fat,

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:13.800
 they will go to their den for winter, and the blastocyst will implant into the wall of

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:16.000
 their womb, and then it will develop into a cub.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.160
 But if they're not, it just gets reabsorbed into the body of the female.

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:20.160
 Right.

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:24.320
 So they have this weird internal barometer of how well they're doing in terms of putting

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:25.320
 on weight for winter.

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:26.320
 Oh, my God.

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:27.320
 Have you seen the pictures?

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:31.000
 Are these specific pictures actually published by Katmai National Park in Alaska?

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.000
 Is it Katmai?

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.000
 K-A-T-M-A-I?

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.680
 That's how I would pronounce it, but we've never pronounced anything right on this show,

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:40.240
 so don't break a tradition there.

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:46.000
 So there are photos published by this National Park in Alaska, where the public votes every

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.040
 year on which bear wins the fastest, the best fattening bear, and you have to check it out,

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:55.840
 because they have these photos on their site of every bear in their National Park.

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:59.680
 And if you move this slider along the pictures, you can see the before and after, and it's

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:02.720
 only in the course of two months, and it is incredible.

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:03.720
 That's so cool.

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:05.840
 And it's like the opposite of fat shaming, isn't it?

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:06.840
 Exactly.

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:07.840
 Yeah.

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:10.200
 It's like they're going to a weight watchers meeting every week, and they've put on an extra

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:12.600
 free stone, and they're just getting applauded.

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:17.400
 And it is a huge amount they eat, and a huge amount they put on, so it's called Hyperfagia,

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:23.200
 wouldn't they just eat constantly for a while, and they gain about two stone per week.

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:24.840
 And so it's really fun to do.

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:27.720
 I spent most of my research scrolling back and forth in these photos.

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:28.720
 Yeah.

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:33.640
 It's interesting, with pregnancy and bears, I was reading about it zoos in America, polar bears,

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:36.840
 the polar bears that they have there, they don't know how to tell if they're pregnant.

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:41.920
 It's really hard to tell if a bear is pregnant, because they often have pseudo pregnancy,

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:43.680
 so it looks like they're pregnant.

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:48.960
 They have the hormones that show up in labs that say they're pregnant, but they're not.

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:50.800
 It just, it matches the same thing.

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:54.280
 So do you know how they find out if they have a pregnant polar bear?

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:55.280
 Oh no.

00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:59.440
 But they just wait and see if a baby comes out. They often do, but that's not useful for them,

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:03.120
 because when it comes out, if none come out, then they're like, damn it, we need our breeding

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:04.120
 program to be better.

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:05.120
 Okay.

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:08.200
 They put them in a CT scanner.

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:09.200
 No.

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:11.360
 Oh, wouldn't that be exciting to see?

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:15.600
 They take some urine samples and they get, no, because he said the hormones is the same.

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:16.600
 Yeah.

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:20.280
 They squeeze, they run in very quickly, and they squeeze the middle of the bear, and then

00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:22.880
 they run out before it tears them into.

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:23.880
 No.

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:24.880
 No.

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:28.800
 They send their poo to a dog called Elvis.

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:31.960
 Now, who's poo?

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:32.960
 They're the polar bears.

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:33.960
 All right.

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:34.960
 Okay.

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:35.960
 What?

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:40.040
 They send the poo to this dog called Elvis, who has a 90% rate of saying whether or not

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:41.040
 they're pregnant or not.

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:42.680
 I can't believe with every time.

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:43.680
 I know.

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:44.680
 What?

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:45.680
 Yeah.

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:46.680
 So this...

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:47.680
 How do they...

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:48.920
 They try to find out that Elvis can do that.

00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:54.480
 They train this dog, Elvis, with another dog, and they kept, they gave them 200 samples to

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:55.760
 see whether they could break down.

00:14:55.760 --> 00:15:00.920
 So there's more than 2,000 proteins in polar bear fecal samples, five are consistent with pregnancy,

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:02.440
 and that's what he was smelling out.

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:03.440
 And 90 has a 90...

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:04.440
 It's just one dog.

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:05.440
 This is not what the dog can do.

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:09.160
 The other dog just guessed it at some points, just faked it, just went, "Yup."

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:11.840
 And because they needed a reward or whatever, so they kicked him out of the system.

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:13.720
 It is just Elvis that they send it to.

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:14.720
 Oh, my goodness.

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:15.720
 Yeah.

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:16.720
 But yeah, that's what they have to do.

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:17.720
 One dog is helping them out.

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:18.720
 Elvis.

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:19.720
 Well done, Elvis.

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:20.720
 Yeah, amazing.

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:21.720
 Here are a dog.

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:25.640
 Do you say in how most mammals don't do this thing?

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:29.920
 It was called embryonic diapos, isn't it?

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:32.440
 Rodants do, quite a few of them bears do, as we know.

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:36.640
 Armadillos do weasels, badges, and kangaroos all do.

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:42.240
 And some people think that maybe humans do on a small level.

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:47.520
 So there have been a few case studies where women have had in vitro fertilization and then

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:52.120
 found out that they were pregnant more than a month later, like maybe two months later

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:53.320
 or stuff like that.

00:15:53.320 --> 00:16:00.120
 And they reckon it might be a very minor diapos that happens in humans, but still more research

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:01.120
 needed.

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:05.440
 It's a bit of a crap diapos, though, because it is only ever really a week or two weeks,

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:06.440
 maybe three.

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:08.480
 Whereas these bears can hold him for a year, can't they?

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:09.480
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:10.480
 Do you guys want to hear something mental?

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:11.480
 Yeah.

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:12.480
 Yeah.

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:13.480
 Okay.

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:18.560
 But sheep blasterists, these little bundles of cells, into the uteruses of mice.

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:19.560
 Okay.

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:23.800
 Now sheep can't do this diapos thing, they just can't do it, and mice can do it.

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:30.040
 And when these sheep blasterists were inserted into mouse uteruses, they went into pause mode.

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:33.440
 The mice were able to pause the blasterists of a different speed, okay?

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:34.440
 I'm not surprised.

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:38.040
 Ben, I mean, why is this stressful?

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:40.000
 Stressful situation for a mouse.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.960
 It's a difficult birth, isn't it?

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:48.280
 But then they were removed, these blasterists, okay, after the mice paused them, and then they

00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:55.560
 were put back into sort of, you know, petri-dished, you know, fertilisation, whatever, sort of artificial

00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:58.040
 thing with sheep, and they grew into normal lambs.

00:16:58.040 --> 00:16:59.040
 Right.

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:00.040
 So they were not inside the sheep?

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:01.040
 They're not back in the sheep.

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:04.720
 They were, I think they were put back in the sheep or put back in the test tube or whatever.

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:09.960
 They were grown into, they grew into normal lambs, having been in a mouse's uterus.

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:10.960
 Wow.

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:13.800
 I think it's pretty tasteless that you won't differentiate between a test tube and a

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:14.800
 sheep mate.

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:15.800
 [laughter]

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:17.800
 Bears or pregnancy?

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:19.520
 Let's go bears.

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:20.520
 Bear?

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:23.880
 Some brown bears have oral sex.

00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:25.960
 Oh, yeah, okay, okay.

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:28.360
 So this is, this is in a zoo in Croatia.

00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:29.360
 It's been noticed.

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:30.360
 They're both males.

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:37.360
 Over 116 hours of observation, these two males did it 28 times in 116 hours, once every

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:41.000
 four hours, over several days, impressive.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.000
 Oh, really?

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.000
 Yeah.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.760
 Official study on the matter has said it might have been because they've been deprived of

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:50.280
 suckling, and that the provider may have found a substitute for teatsucking that also resulted

00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:52.360
 in a letdown of substitute milk.

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:53.360
 Right.

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:54.360
 [laughter]

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:55.360
 Right.

00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:56.360
 [laughter]

00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:57.360
 Oh, what a weirdism.

00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:58.360
 Wow.

00:17:58.360 --> 00:17:59.360
 For that process.

00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:02.560
 Be a ward for the most disturbing factor of the year.

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:03.560
 [laughter]

00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:04.560
 Good.

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:08.760
 Do you suffer from premature letdown of substitute milk?

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:09.760
 [laughter]

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:14.680
 I think that was presented in a safer work away as I could manage it.

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:15.680
 Oh, it was very good.

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:16.680
 Yeah, you did well.

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:20.200
 Well, maybe humans could learn from that, because...

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:25.880
 Maybe you should be taking lessons from that.

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:27.400
 This is why you're milk peddling.

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:28.400
 [laughter]

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:29.400
 I'm sorry.

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:30.400
 Don't have any of the milk.

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:33.400
 Will you take my substitute?

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:36.400
 [laughter]

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:40.280
 So we can learn some stuff from bears, though, if not that.

00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:44.880
 We can learn a lot from their hibernation period, right, or their topper that they go into,

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:49.200
 so they are enormously fat, as we've said, when they'll go into this topper, and they'll

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:53.320
 dig their dens, and they'll just lie there, and they don't get...

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:55.840
 So there's lots of stuff that we think we should look into to find out why they don't

00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:59.080
 get, for instance, muscle and bone deterioration.

00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:02.320
 So if people are in hospital, let's say you're in a coma, or you're confined to hospital

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:07.200
 for months on end, you get terrible muscle wastage and bone wastage, and you get bedsoars,

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:09.040
 and they don't really get any of that.

00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:12.120
 And also, they remain quite alert.

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:15.840
 So I think when animals properly hibernate, then you really can't wait them up.

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:18.160
 This is a good thing to be aware of with grizzly bears, actually.

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:22.840
 They will wake up as soon as you go anywhere near them, if they're in hibernation, and they

00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:25.320
 can suddenly snap out of it and go for you.

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:32.160
 So I think people were studying grizzly bears, and they said, "I'm just thinking that

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:36.520
 the worst way that a grizzly bear can go for you is if it's not been suckly very well."

00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:44.240
 They'll go for any part of you that's nearest, to be honest, but they did a...

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:45.240
 Oh my god.

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:48.440
 Well, no, just imagine that scenario happening.

00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:54.360
 You've got your life, but you've got to walk back to camp, and they say, "How did you survive?

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:56.480
 You won't believe this, guys.

00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:58.800
 I just got sucked out by a grizzly bear."

00:19:58.800 --> 00:19:59.800
 Oh my god.

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:03.200
 I took 12 hours, 28 times.

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:08.040
 Poor thing, wanted to go back to sleep.

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:11.760
 Oh my god.

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:15.760
 Disgusting.

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:17.800
 Oh my god.

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:21.800
 I've got Disgusting Bear Story, just a match for Disgusting Bear Story.

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:27.080
 I found this really odd account from the 1700s, so there was a clergyman from court

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:29.480
 called Arthur O'Leary.

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:34.420
 And he was in Northern France, and he saw a dancing bear.

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:36.560
 And this was an incredible dancing bear.

00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:38.560
 Everyone was talking about how amazing it was.

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:42.160
 It could sort of count in numbers by putting its paw on the ground.

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:43.840
 It would nod to gentleman.

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:47.760
 It just did all these sort of really graceful things, and this guy was thinking, "How is

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:48.760
 this possible?"

00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:53.680
 Then the giveaway happened when the bear suddenly yelled out, "The devil take him.

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:55.560
 The guy has me persecuted."

00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:59.000
 And it turned out what happened, and he yelled that in Irish, so this guy understood

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.720
 because he was from court.

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:08.480
 It turns out that a man had been washed up in France, and sewn into a bear suit of a real

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:13.480
 bear, and was made to perform, and was stuck inside, and that was his moment to get out.

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:17.080
 I don't know if he knew an Irishman was there, who'd understand his language, but yeah.

00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:20.240
 This is the call from the mid-1980s.

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:21.240
 Yeah, this is amazing.

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:23.040
 Why did he wait so long to do it?

00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:26.880
 Even if you don't understand Irish, you know if you're a human voice coming out of a bear

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:27.880
 that's something weird going on.

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:29.480
 Oh, it's just, you know, it was a dancing bear.

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:30.960
 They thought this was a very talented bear.

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:32.920
 But if you're spelling stuff out on the ground, you could spell out help.

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:33.920
 I am an Irishman.

00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:38.960
 You're washed up on the beat, but you're, I mean, if you're French, you might not speak Irish.

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:39.960
 That's true.

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:44.560
 I guess my point is, I still don't think Irish sounded to French people like the growl

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:45.560
 of a bear.

00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:48.560
 Yeah, I think if he just shouted something.

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:52.560
 Yeah, you probably pick up words from the people around you.

00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:53.560
 Yeah, exactly.

00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:54.560
 Bonjour!

00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:55.560
 Bonjour!

00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:58.280
 That is quite a story.

00:21:58.280 --> 00:21:59.800
 It's bizarre, which I do not believe.

00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:00.800
 Yeah.

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:01.800
 Neither do I.

00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:02.800
 It's out there.

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:03.800
 Really good.

00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:05.680
 And so just one or two things on pregnancy, maybe?

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:06.680
 Oh, yeah, cool.

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:10.080
 Um, do you guys think it's possible to get pregnant via a bullet?

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:11.800
 Um, there is.

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:14.120
 I've heard that, but it must be a myth.

00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:18.400
 So there's a Civil War article, just out of the Civil War, American medical journal.

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:22.840
 There was a proper entry from a doctor called, um, Legand Capers.

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:25.720
 And he had been... Sorry, he was called Legand Capers.

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:26.720
 Oh, yeah.

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:27.720
 I guess he was.

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:28.720
 Legand got a weird name.

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:29.720
 He was treating a soldier.

00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:30.720
 Yeah.

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:34.640
 He was a soldier who'd been shot in the Civil War, in a skirmish.

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:37.680
 And his testicle had been shot off, very, very painful, obviously.

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:41.040
 The doctor treated him as quickly as possible, dressed the wound.

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:44.960
 And then was immediately approached by a woman who said, oh, my daughter has been very badly

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:45.960
 wounded.

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:48.480
 A stray bullet had hit her in the abdominal cavity, right?

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:52.200
 Unfortunately, he didn't have time to treat her properly and the army was fleeing.

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:57.080
 So he left seven months later he returned and the woman was very heavily pregnant.

00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:58.080
 Wow.

00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:06.320
 The baby was born a little while later and the doctor observed that after the baby boy was

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:10.840
 born, inside the testicles of the baby boy was a bullet.

00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:11.840
 Oh, man.

00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:12.840
 What?

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:13.840
 This has, like, a pen and teller.

00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:14.840
 What is it?

00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:18.680
 And it was written the name of the very doctor.

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:28.800
 It was a hoax article.

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:34.040
 That's how the legend kind of entered the street, that's the first example of that story.

00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:35.040
 Right.

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:36.040
 That is.

00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:37.800
 I can't remember who made it up now.

00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:39.280
 I was too involved in the story.

00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:45.240
 The doctor, Legged, Legged, Legged and his capers.

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:51.120
 OK, it is time for fact number three and that is James.

00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:58.080
 OK, my fact is that when the vandal sacked Rome in 455 AD, they agreed that they would just

00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:01.520
 take the money and not damage any of the property.

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:02.520
 Sorry, funny.

00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:03.520
 So.

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:04.520
 The vandal.

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:05.520
 Well, this is what I'm trying to do.

00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:08.480
 I'm trying to rescue the reputation of the vandals.

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:09.480
 OK.

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:13.080
 And it is a little bit controversial because it obviously happened a long, long time ago and

00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:17.560
 a lot of people who were writing about it were Roman, who wanted to say bad things about

00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:24.400
 the vandals, but it does seem that the reputation that we have given the vandals for being vandals

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:26.800
 might not be fair.

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:32.160
 And actually, during this sack of Rome, they'd done a deal with Leo I, who was the Pope at

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:33.160
 the time.

00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:38.400
 And he said, OK, you can come here because obviously we can't really defend ourselves, so you

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:39.400
 can come over.

00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:43.560
 If you do, please leave all of our churches and all of our buildings intact, we'll give

00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:47.560
 you the money, we'll give you the jewels, we'll give you the gold and silver, but please

00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:48.560
 don't do that.

00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:53.800
 And it seems for the most part, although there was a few deaths and they did take a few

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:54.800
 people as slaves.

00:24:54.800 --> 00:25:00.440
 For the most part, as far as pre-medieval sacks go, this was actually not one of the worst

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:01.440
 ones.

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:02.800
 But they did steal shed loads, right?

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:07.520
 Why don't we just use vandalism to mean stealing all the stuff somewhere and kidnapping

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:08.520
 quite a few of the people?

00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:11.840
 But we're just using vandalism to mean the wrong thing, the one thing they didn't do was smash

00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:12.840
 anything up.

00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:15.000
 Really convinced by James' thesis on this.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:20.600
 I had no idea that the vandals were relatively nice guys, who they were all Christians.

00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:21.600
 They were?

00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:22.600
 Good Christian boys and girls.

00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:23.600
 With it, they weren't nice.

00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:26.520
 Well, they were good Christians, if you believe the other Christians who didn't believe

00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:30.320
 the same Christian stuff as they believed in their Christian self, just got vandal stuff.

00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:31.320
 That's not relevant.

00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:37.480
 But they had been pushed out of their native lands by the Huns, and the vandals were just

00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:42.000
 trying to get down to North Africa, which is where they settled and they took over Carthage.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:48.120
 And Ibiza where they lived for 80 years, which I always think is quite a long car.

00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:52.000
 But yeah, they eventually did move down and they lived in North Africa, and they were

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.520
 kind of happy there.

00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:57.160
 But they were, because they had Carthage and they had a really good fleet, they were occasionally

00:25:57.160 --> 00:26:02.400
 stealing from people and going on little forays and stuff.

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:05.640
 But then in Rome, there was also a dodgy stuff going on.

00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:11.720
 So the Roman Emperor Valentinian III was murdered by Petronius Maximus, because they had a little

00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:13.560
 bit of beef between them.

00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:19.840
 And when Petronius Maximus took over, he forced Valentinians Widow to marry him and forced

00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:22.760
 Valentinians daughter to marry his son.

00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:28.160
 And Valentinians daughter was supposed to get married to the king of the vandals son.

00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:31.600
 And so the king of the vandals said, well, you know what, if you're going to cancel that

00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:33.800
 marriage, I'm going to cancel our deal.

00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:37.220
 And I'm going to come over and I'm going to sack your city and that's what he did.

00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:41.240
 And then Petronius tried to run away from the vandals, but he was stoned by his own people

00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:42.240
 and thrown into the tibre.

00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:43.240
 Nice.

00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:44.240
 I think it's fair.

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:45.240
 I think it's completely fair.

00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:46.240
 There was a deal.

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:47.240
 Petronius Maximus broke it.

00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:49.280
 The vandals had every right to sack the city.

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:50.280
 Yeah.

00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:51.280
 Yeah.

00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:52.280
 It's very game of Thrones, isn't it?

00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:53.280
 It really is.

00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:54.280
 Yeah.

00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:55.280
 Yeah.

00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:55.280
 Yeah.

00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:55.280
 Yeah.

00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:55.280
 Yeah.

00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:55.280
 Yeah.

00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:56.280
 Yeah.

00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:56.280
 Yeah.

00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:57.280
 Yeah.

00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:57.280
 Yeah.

00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:58.280
 Yeah.

00:26:58.280 --> 00:26:59.280
 Yeah.

00:26:59.280 --> 00:26:59.280
 Yeah.

00:26:59.280 --> 00:26:59.280
 Yeah.

00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:00.280
 Yeah.

00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:01.280
 Yeah.

00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:01.280
 Yeah.

00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:01.280
 Yeah.

00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:02.280
 Yeah.

00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:03.280
 Yeah.

00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:04.620
 - It's not from the people they murdered.

00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:06.900
 - Apart from the people they murdered and the temple they were dead.

00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:08.140
 - It was literally just that they didn't break stuff.

00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:08.980
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:12.540
 He was also the same Pope who talked supposedly,

00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:16.300
 talked to Tilla the Hun out of actually coming to Rome at all.

00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:18.340
 They sent him out, they knew Tilla was on the way,

00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:19.780
 and he met up with them and he said,

00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:20.620
 "Would you mind not coming?"

00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:21.780
 And Tilla went, "Ah, okay."

00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:25.900
 And went off, there's two times that he's responsible for.

00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:26.740
 - Yeah, I'll give you some--

00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:28.220
 - Don't feel like there's more to that story, isn't there?

00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:30.580
 It feels like there must have been more to the conversation

00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:31.620
 than that.

00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:32.460
 - Yeah.

00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:34.260
 - He's called a black male, a bribery.

00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:36.580
 I think he came up and he said, "You okay, Hun?"

00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:39.340
 (laughing)

00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:41.540
 - He just burst into tears.

00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:43.020
 I didn't want to hurt anyone.

00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:44.180
 It's gone out of hand.

00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:45.660
 - I didn't know about sacking.

00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:48.100
 I don't know why he said sack places.

00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:48.940
 Why you sack places.

00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:50.260
 - Why do you sack places?

00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:52.220
 - You put everything in sacks when you're running off.

00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:53.060
 - Yes.

00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:53.900
 - Is it?

00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:57.100
 - Yeah, it's from, I looked this up in the OED,

00:27:57.100 --> 00:27:59.060
 and it's from the Latin verb sacare,

00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:01.020
 which means put it in a bag.

00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:02.380
 - Nice, put it in a bag.

00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:03.220
 - Yeah.

00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:05.820
 - Nothing, not everything fits in the sack.

00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:07.420
 - All right, all right, clever plugs.

00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:08.260
 - Not just.

00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:11.020
 - Yeah, I mean, they've got other things, right?

00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:12.340
 - Maybe you've been using the miniature sacks

00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:14.980
 that the old sacks have been using.

00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:15.980
 (laughing)

00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:19.780
 - And then being a vandal was actually a good thing

00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:21.220
 for quite a while, okay?

00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:24.660
 So people thought that the vandals were kind of cool,

00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:27.580
 and a lot of royal families claimed dissent

00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:28.900
 from the vandals.

00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:31.500
 The Swedish and the Danish royal families, for instance,

00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:34.500
 continue to do so until only about 30 years or so ago.

00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:35.340
 - Wow.

00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:39.620
 - But there was then a person called Henri Gregois,

00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:41.620
 who was a Bishop of Bois.

00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:43.940
 And he used, is that I pronounced that?

00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:44.780
 - I pronounced that.

00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:47.040
 (laughing)

00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:53.260
 - He used the term in 1794 to describe the destruction

00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:55.900
 of artwork following the French Revolution.

00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:57.620
 And so that's when the word vandalism

00:28:57.620 --> 00:29:00.460
 became to mean sort of wrecking things.

00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:01.300
 - Really?

00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:02.860
 - Yeah, he got obsessed with it, didn't he?

00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:04.420
 - I read that there was no one to defend

00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:07.060
 the good name of the vandals, because at the time,

00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:09.020
 there wasn't a geographical region,

00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:12.020
 which was claiming dissent from them.

00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:13.420
 Well, certainly not in that bit of France anyway.

00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:14.860
 - Yeah, no, hadn't been for some time.

00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:17.020
 But I mean, because they were quite crap in the end,

00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:18.180
 and they didn't last very long.

00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:20.700
 And actually, they should be grateful for De Bluah,

00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:22.740
 'cause otherwise we wouldn't remember them at all,

00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:23.740
 I don't think.

00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:25.820
 They pretty much lasted 100 years,

00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:27.740
 sort of fanning around in Carthagin,

00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:29.580
 bits of North Africa, and the Iberian Peninsula.

00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:30.420
 - Very often.

00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:32.660
 - Peace loving people.

00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:34.940
 - They were not a peace loving people.

00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:36.460
 - They were reasonably peace.

00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:39.260
 - I read it account where they butchered people up

00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:41.420
 into tiny little pieces of meat.

00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:43.780
 - You were judging them by modern standards,

00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:45.780
 which is not the way it works, okay?

00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:46.620
 - That's fair enough.

00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:47.780
 - They were all doing that in those days.

00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:49.540
 - Exactly, thank you.

00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:51.260
 - Do you know who their main eyes were?

00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:52.420
 - No, no.

00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:54.860
 - Who they were in coalition with was the Allens.

00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:56.860
 It was the vandal for the Allens, yeah.

00:29:56.860 --> 00:29:58.900
 So the vandal kingdom was actually the vandal

00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:00.460
 than the Allen kingdom in.

00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:05.420
 - One more thing about the vandal is that George III married

00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:08.060
 Charlotte of Mecklenburg, Strelitz.

00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:10.780
 And she claimed dissent from the vandals.

00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:11.620
 She was one of those.

00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:14.980
 So we briefly had a queen who was a vandal.

00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:17.500
 And it was really trendy at the time.

00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:19.940
 And so in the late 1700s, they were going to make

00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:21.780
 a British colony in North America,

00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:23.860
 which they were going to call Vandalia.

00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:26.620
 And there are still places in America called Vandalia,

00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:28.780
 including one city that was briefly the capital

00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:30.620
 of Illinois.

00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:32.780
 And sports teams from the University of Idaho

00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:35.620
 are always called the vandals because of this trendy time

00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:37.180
 when everyone was called vandals.

00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:38.020
 - That's awesome.

00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:38.980
 - It was really good.

00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:40.620
 - Oh, they've left them mark.

00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:41.460
 - Yeah.

00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:42.700
 - Very odd way.

00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:46.780
 Can I have one favorite vandal who was the last king.

00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:49.340
 So the guy who snacked Rome was actually really good.

00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:51.420
 He was geyseric and he was impressive.

00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:53.500
 The last king was a guy called Gelemmer.

00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:55.740
 And he spent his whole time running away from people

00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:58.500
 who were trying to beat his armies and fleeing.

00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:00.860
 And at one point, the only reason his life was saved was

00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:03.140
 'cause it was always the Byzantins who were after him.

00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:04.980
 At one point, the only reason his life was saved was

00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:07.460
 because he was fleeing John the Armenian,

00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:08.940
 who was ruler.

00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:10.100
 - Where was he from?

00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:12.420
 (all laughing)

00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:15.500
 - So he's fleeing John the Armenian, who was gonna get him,

00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:18.100
 but then poor John the Armenian ended up being accidentally

00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:20.900
 killed by one of his own bodyguards who'd got pissed

00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:22.940
 and was trying to shoot a bird with an arrow

00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:24.940
 and accidentally got John instead.

00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:25.780
 - Wow.

00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:26.740
 - So Gelemmer escapes John.

00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:28.300
 This is Gelemmer, Mr. Vandal.

00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:31.180
 And he fled to Algeria and he didn't like Algeria

00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:33.260
 because the diet was bad and they lived quite

00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:35.220
 ascetic lives and he was used to luxury.

00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:38.060
 So then the ruler of the Byzantins said,

00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:39.020
 "Do you want a surrender then?

00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:40.860
 "If you hate it there, surrender to me."

00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:42.340
 And he sent a letter back saying,

00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:43.860
 "No, I refused a surrender,

00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:47.220
 "but please send me some bread, a sponge, and a liar."

00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:48.380
 And he explained.

00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:49.220
 (all laughing)

00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:52.140
 - This is like a T-cosy or condom in a panning to men.

00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:54.380
 (all laughing)

00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:57.060
 - He was a distant ancestor of Clarkson.

00:31:57.060 --> 00:31:58.100
 - When you say a lie,

00:31:58.100 --> 00:31:59.660
 you don't mean someone who turns up saying,

00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:01.340
 "I haven't brought a bread or a sponge."

00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:03.620
 (all laughing)

00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:06.460
 - What are you holding my idea back then?

00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:08.100
 No, he said he wanted the bread to eat.

00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:10.260
 He said he needed the sponge to wash his eyes

00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:11.740
 'cause they were so swollen with tears

00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:13.060
 'cause he was so unhappy.

00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:15.100
 And he said he wanted the liar to play

00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:17.020
 alongside a lament that he had composed

00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:18.940
 about what a tough time he was having.

00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:22.700
 And the leader of the Byzantins cried in sympathy

00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:24.420
 and sent him all the stuff he wanted.

00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:25.580
 - Oh, that's good.

00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:26.420
 - Nice guy.

00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:28.540
 - Now that is a peace-loving people,

00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:29.820
 the Byzantine people.

00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:31.740
 (all laughing)

00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:32.980
 - Well, that was Rome, wasn't it?

00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:36.420
 I didn't realize that Rome didn't really collapse

00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:38.940
 until 1453 AD.

00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:41.580
 But the Byzantines were the, is that the Eastern lot?

00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:42.780
 And they called themselves the Romans.

00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:45.540
 They did not see, they didn't say we are the Byzantine Empire

00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:47.180
 and what a shame about Rome.

00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:48.380
 They completely saw themselves

00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:50.620
 as the continuation of the Roman Empire.

00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:52.100
 They just happened to all be Christians

00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:53.700
 and have moved with the times.

00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:55.260
 - It's weird 'cause we called the Christians Romans

00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:56.100
 for a bit.

00:32:56.100 --> 00:32:57.780
 We just decided no, saw it.

00:32:57.780 --> 00:32:58.940
 As in 'cause these guys have been Christians

00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:00.140
 for a hundred years or so.

00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:01.300
 - Yeah.

00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:03.900
 - Everyone's calling everyone stupid things, are they?

00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:04.900
 (all laughing)

00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:07.980
 And everyone called everyone barbarians as well.

00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:11.980
 So barbarian, the word barbarian comes from the Greeks

00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:14.460
 used it to mean anyone who wasn't Greek, right.

00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:16.500
 And they gave it the word because they thought

00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:18.900
 that everyone who spoke something that wasn't Greek

00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:26.900
 was just going, (imitating barbarian music)

00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:30.340
 and so then the Romans called all of the Germanic tribes

00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:32.980
 barbarians, but actually the Romans were barbarians as well,

00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:34.740
 according to the Greeks.

00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:35.740
 - Okay.

00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:36.580
 - They were all barbarians.

00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:38.740
 - The Greeks even called other Greeks barbarians.

00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:39.580
 - Did they?

00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:41.580
 - So it was just people who didn't want exactly like you,

00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:43.540
 basically, was barbarian.

00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:46.060
 And there's that weird folk etymology that it was,

00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:47.300
 people who had bids.

00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:48.140
 - It was barbarian.

00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:49.860
 - It was barbarian, but I don't think that is true.

00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:50.700
 - Okay, no.

00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:51.900
 - All right, we're just on beards.

00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:55.020
 So there was something like, I read that was about seven sacks

00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:57.420
 of Rome over a different periods of time.

00:33:57.420 --> 00:34:00.940
 And in 1527, there was one, but that's post,

00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:03.820
 when you're saying Rome, the ancient Rome.

00:34:03.820 --> 00:34:04.660
 - Yes, yes.

00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:06.220
 - So, but it's still counted as Rome, I suppose.

00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:07.060
 - Oh, it's still Rome.

00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:07.900
 - It's still Rome.

00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:09.060
 - It's still going into it.

00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:09.900
 Congratulations, guys.

00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:11.060
 - The city is still, is always Rome.

00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:11.900
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:12.740
 - Okay, good.

00:34:12.740 --> 00:34:13.580
 - I hope, 'cause I'm going next week,

00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:15.060
 so it's gonna be very awkward if it disappeared

00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:16.060
 a thousand years ago.

00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:19.820
 But so, 1527, it was sacked so bad.

00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:21.060
 That was a really, really bad one.

00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:22.740
 It was a sacks city.

00:34:22.740 --> 00:34:23.580
 - Exactly.

00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:24.780
 - Yeah, big sack.

00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:26.740
 That's the Pope at the time, Clement VII,

00:34:26.740 --> 00:34:29.020
 grew a beard in mourning.

00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:31.380
 It was sort of a display of mourning.

00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:33.500
 And he had it until his death in 1534,

00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:37.220
 but he kickstarted a trend amongst posts to have beards.

00:34:37.220 --> 00:34:38.740
 'Cause they didn't have beards up until that point.

00:34:38.740 --> 00:34:40.540
 There were a few that had, but the idea is,

00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:43.460
 if you were a man of God, that you had to be clean shaven.

00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:46.500
 But it was seen, he was so loved, I think,

00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:50.780
 that for 24 subsequent popes, they all had a beard.

00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:51.620
 - Right.

00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:53.980
 - Yeah, so he started a trend of beards in popes, that's great.

00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:56.220
 - Oh my God, so this whole hipster beard trend,

00:34:56.220 --> 00:34:58.860
 we keep thinking he is gonna end clearly by dance face.

00:34:58.860 --> 00:35:00.380
 It doesn't seem like he is.

00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:03.540
 This could go on for the length of 24 popes, range.

00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:04.380
 - Yeah.

00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:05.220
 - That's a long trend.

00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:07.140
 - And if you want to be a man of God,

00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:08.780
 then you can get your free trail set.

00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:09.620
 - Just spawn.

00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:13.900
 (laughs)

00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:16.500
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact to the show,

00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:17.700
 and that is my fact.

00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:21.420
 My fact this week is a people who have died from laughing

00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:23.820
 include a fifth century Greek artist

00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:26.180
 who couldn't stop laughing at his own painting,

00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:29.500
 and an Australian dog trainer who died after reading

00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:32.420
 the price difference of some commodities in 1915

00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:34.580
 as compared to 1920.

00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:35.500
 (laughs)

00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:36.740
 They're very funny price deals.

00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:37.580
 - Is that yes?

00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:39.580
 - Would the price gone down or up?

00:35:39.580 --> 00:35:40.860
 - I think they'd gone up.

00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:42.980
 - Has anyone looked at the price commodities

00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:44.700
 from 1915?

00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:45.860
 - I think you have.

00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:46.860
 (laughs)

00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:49.900
 - Well, I just about managed to survive.

00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:50.900
 No, I did.

00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:52.300
 It was during the war, wasn't it?

00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:55.500
 So everything went up in price,

00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:58.380
 including wheat that increased by over 50%

00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:00.740
 to more than six times the pre-war rate.

00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:02.780
 - What, by 1920?

00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:04.180
 1915, that was.

00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:06.260
 - Yeah, compared to 1920, though.

00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:07.260
 - I didn't check that.

00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:08.740
 - Jane, you've just,

00:36:08.740 --> 00:36:11.020
 like, you've done a half the research here.

00:36:11.020 --> 00:36:12.380
 No, one, do you haven't died laughing?

00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:14.420
 (laughs)

00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:15.740
 - That's the thing, it's dangerous, right?

00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:17.060
 We know it to be dangerous, so.

00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:17.900
 - Very risky.

00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:19.060
 - There are lots of stories on there

00:36:19.060 --> 00:36:20.060
 about people dying laughing,

00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:22.220
 but there are a lot of them, a pinch of salt.

00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:23.860
 A lot of them seem to have had underlying

00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:24.700
 medical conditions.

00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:25.540
 - Yes.

00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:26.380
 - That would have been aggravated.

00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:28.900
 - Absolutely, but they did go out still counts.

00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:29.740
 - In the last.

00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:30.580
 - So nice, yeah.

00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:32.420
 - There's an ancient story about a seeer

00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:35.580
 called Kalkas, who died after another seeer

00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:37.140
 had predicted his death,

00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:38.980
 and then the other seeer had been proved wrong.

00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:40.380
 His prediction had been so wrong,

00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:42.020
 and Kalkas laughed and laughed and laughed,

00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:43.260
 and then died.

00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:46.060
 That's proving the prediction right.

00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:48.860
 Is it one of those bullet testicle baby stories?

00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:51.260
 - I think a lot of these are, aren't they?

00:36:51.260 --> 00:36:52.100
 - Yeah.

00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:54.860
 - So, when you tell us the story of the Greek artist?

00:36:54.860 --> 00:36:57.540
 - The Greek artist was called Zeusus.

00:36:57.540 --> 00:36:58.940
 Z-E-U-X-I-S.

00:36:58.940 --> 00:36:59.780
 - Zeusus.

00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:01.020
 - Zeusus?

00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:02.420
 - Like Zeusus.

00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:03.660
 - Zeusus.

00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:05.900
 - So the Greek artist is called Zeusus.

00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:08.380
 - Phil century BC, was he from Manhattan?

00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:10.780
 - Yeah, he was a Marx brother.

00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:12.620
 He's Z-E-X-I-S.

00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:15.620
 - He's Z-E-X-I-S.

00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:16.660
 - He's coming around.

00:37:16.660 --> 00:37:19.340
 - So he died laughing because he painted,

00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:21.580
 'cause he heard you tried to pronounce his name.

00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:24.380
 (laughing)

00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:27.620
 He was painting the goddess Aphrodite.

00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:28.460
 Aphrodite?

00:37:28.460 --> 00:37:31.340
 Z-E-X-I-S and Aphrodite.

00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:34.260
 And the old woman who commissioned it from him

00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:37.260
 insisted that she be the model for the portrait.

00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:38.300
 Which he thought was ridiculous.

00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:39.300
 She didn't look like Aphrodite.

00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:40.620
 So, he painted it.

00:37:40.620 --> 00:37:42.700
 And I imagine it as he got to the end,

00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:43.900
 final dab on the painting.

00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:44.740
 He stood back.

00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:46.460
 He thought this is so ridiculous

00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:50.260
 that he went into laughter convulsions and died.

00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:52.820
 Is the story that we, that we, to believe.

00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:53.660
 - That's good.

00:37:53.660 --> 00:37:54.500
 - Yeah.

00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:55.540
 - When she got the painting for free,

00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:56.780
 you just take it away, wouldn't you?

00:37:56.780 --> 00:37:57.620
 - Yeah.

00:37:57.620 --> 00:37:58.460
 - Roll it up.

00:37:58.460 --> 00:37:59.900
 (laughing)

00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:01.300
 - He's amazing those who exist.

00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:03.900
 There's one story that's related by plenty of the elder,

00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:06.060
 which is that he was,

00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:08.900
 he basically got into an art battle

00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:12.100
 with another massive painter of the time.

00:38:12.100 --> 00:38:12.940
 - What was it called?

00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:14.420
 - He was called Pahasius.

00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:18.700
 So, Zwiexus and Pahasius decided to have an art off.

00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:20.700
 And they arrived to this battle,

00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:23.860
 both bringing the best painting that they could possibly do.

00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:28.860
 So, Zwiexus pulls back his painting to reveal grapes.

00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:30.820
 So he pulls a little sheet away, grapes are there.

00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:32.580
 The grapes are said to be so real

00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:34.540
 that birds fly down from the sky

00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:36.220
 and start pecking at the painting.

00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:37.060
 - Really?

00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:38.740
 - Huge, huge deal is doing really well.

00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:40.740
 Pahasius then says,

00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:43.100
 "Okay, well let me unveil my painting,"

00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:44.540
 which is behind these curtains,

00:38:44.540 --> 00:38:47.140
 only to reveal that the curtains themselves

00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:49.540
 are the painting so real.

00:38:49.540 --> 00:38:50.980
 - Oh M.G. - Yeah.

00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:52.380
 - Is an illusion.

00:38:52.380 --> 00:38:53.220
 And he won.

00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:54.220
 He beat Zwiexus.

00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:55.060
 - Yeah.

00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:57.580
 - I heard that Zwiexus was the one who was trying

00:38:57.580 --> 00:38:59.300
 to push the cloth away.

00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:00.380
 - Oh, right.

00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:01.780
 - Pahasius is painting.

00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:02.620
 - Okay.

00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:03.460
 - And so he was like,

00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:04.820
 "I'm going to show what yours looks like

00:39:04.820 --> 00:39:06.940
 and he couldn't do it because it was painted on the..."

00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:07.780
 - That makes sense.

00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:08.620
 - That's astonishing.

00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:10.460
 - There's another anecdote that says

00:39:10.460 --> 00:39:12.860
 he drew a boy holding the grapes

00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:15.500
 and the bird came down to try and peck the grapes,

00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:16.980
 but he was really unhappy about that.

00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:18.780
 Why might that be?

00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:20.100
 - Who Zwiexus was unhappy?

00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:20.940
 - Yes.

00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:22.820
 - Was he his painting?

00:39:22.820 --> 00:39:23.820
 - No.

00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:25.980
 He was unhappy with his own skill.

00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:27.860
 - Because the bird wasn't scared of the boy?

00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:28.700
 - Exactly.

00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:30.980
 Yeah, so the grapes were good enough,

00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:32.660
 but obviously the boy wasn't good enough

00:39:32.660 --> 00:39:34.340
 'cause the birds weren't scared.

00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:35.180
 I'm liking that.

00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:36.020
 - You're embarrassing.

00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:37.180
 - I can't.

00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:40.340
 - There are a few more famous ancients who died laughing.

00:39:40.340 --> 00:39:43.860
 So my favorite, which I think I read in Mary Bid's book,

00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:46.900
 was the fact that two famous figures in ancient Greece

00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:49.260
 were separately recorded as having died laughing

00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:52.620
 after seeing a donkey eating figs and drinking wine.

00:39:52.620 --> 00:39:53.460
 - Okay.

00:39:53.460 --> 00:39:54.300
 - It's funny.

00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:55.140
 - It's very funny.

00:39:55.140 --> 00:39:55.980
 - It's ridiculous.

00:39:55.980 --> 00:39:57.700
 It's obviously the same story that's been pitched

00:39:57.700 --> 00:39:58.980
 by two people.

00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:01.060
 So there's one of them, which is--

00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:04.300
 - It could be one very funny donkey doing the rounds.

00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:06.060
 - The greatest comedian of the third century BC.

00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:07.340
 - You have a lovely donkey of death.

00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:09.820
 - It could have been an Irishman in a donkey's seat.

00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:10.660
 (laughing)

00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:12.420
 - Just trying to say let me out.

00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:14.460
 They didn't speak Irish in ancient Greece.

00:40:14.460 --> 00:40:18.980
 So one was recorded by Valerius Maximus

00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:20.860
 in the first century AD,

00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:24.140
 but it was talking about Philharmon in the third century BC

00:40:24.140 --> 00:40:27.260
 who had, so he was this master chap

00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:30.380
 and his slave had put figs in the room with him

00:40:30.380 --> 00:40:33.260
 and he watched a donkey start eating the figs

00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:35.460
 and he was quite pissed off so he called his slave

00:40:35.460 --> 00:40:37.260
 and said come here, chase that donkey away.

00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:38.580
 I don't know why he couldn't get up

00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:40.060
 and chase the donkey away himself.

00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:41.820
 And the slave took a while to arrive.

00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:43.740
 So by the time the slave had got there

00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:45.940
 to chase the donkey away, all the figs had gone.

00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:48.420
 So Philharmon said, well you might as well

00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:50.180
 now give the donkey some wine.

00:40:50.180 --> 00:40:51.020
 (laughing)

00:40:51.020 --> 00:40:52.580
 'Cause he had a joke about how--

00:40:52.580 --> 00:40:53.420
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:40:53.420 --> 00:40:55.540
 - And then he found himself so hilarious

00:40:55.540 --> 00:40:58.500
 that he laughed, that he died apparently

00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:01.620
 crushing his feeble windpipe with his own panting.

00:41:01.620 --> 00:41:02.980
 And then-- - What?

00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:05.420
 - Can I just say, so he was laughing at his own joke?

00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:07.380
 - Yeah, absolutely, yeah.

00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:08.220
 - He was a funny guy.

00:41:08.220 --> 00:41:10.620
 And then exactly the same thing is told about the stoic

00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:12.060
 for lots of a chrysopus.

00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:14.740
 Apparently he died laughing at the very similar joke

00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:19.580
 that he told when a donkey was quoting his figs.

00:41:19.580 --> 00:41:21.980
 - Yeah, maybe it was just the classic funny thing

00:41:21.980 --> 00:41:24.500
 and that doesn't quite translate these days.

00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:27.420
 - It can't do, there must be something we're missing.

00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:29.380
 - Well, or it's like exactly what Anna says,

00:41:29.380 --> 00:41:30.540
 it's just one story.

00:41:30.540 --> 00:41:31.580
 (laughing)

00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:34.140
 - I think it's very funny, it's a funny joke.

00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:37.180
 - Someone else who supposedly died laughing

00:41:37.180 --> 00:41:41.500
 was Anthony Trollop, and he was supposedly reading

00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:44.500
 a book called "Vice Versa, a Lesson to Fathers"

00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:48.020
 by F. Anstey, and he found a bin in it

00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:50.740
 that was so funny that he died laughing.

00:41:50.740 --> 00:41:51.940
 But what I found really interesting

00:41:51.940 --> 00:41:54.500
 is that this is a really old book,

00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:59.380
 but it's about a businessman who finds an Indian magic stone

00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:01.860
 and swaps body with his young son.

00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:03.780
 He's basically freaky Friday.

00:42:03.780 --> 00:42:05.340
 - Wow, that's great.

00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:08.540
 - Big, all these movies, it's been going on 30.

00:42:08.540 --> 00:42:09.380
 - Yeah.

00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:12.900
 - My, as yet, unpicked up screenplay, "The Wrong Tree,"

00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:14.700
 which is a dog body swap comedy.

00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:15.980
 - Or does he swap with a tree?

00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:17.860
 - No, two dogs swap with each other.

00:42:17.860 --> 00:42:18.700
 - All right.

00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:19.660
 - But one of them is a big scary dog

00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:22.100
 and one of them is a small lap dog.

00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:23.380
 - Why is it the wrong tree?

00:42:23.380 --> 00:42:25.900
 - 'Cause they've both been, 'cause this is a magic tree,

00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:28.380
 which they're both running round.

00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:29.740
 - God, I thought this was a joke,

00:42:29.740 --> 00:42:31.020
 but actually it's becoming apparent

00:42:31.020 --> 00:42:32.020
 that you've actually got this.

00:42:32.020 --> 00:42:33.660
 - No, no, I want to jump in and say,

00:42:33.660 --> 00:42:34.500
 let's not indulge it,

00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:35.900
 'cause it's can go on for half an hour.

00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:36.740
 It's really detailed.

00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:37.580
 - I've got the copy right,

00:42:37.580 --> 00:42:38.900
 just to make that very, very clear.

00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:41.340
 - What about two grizzly bears who swap bodies

00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:42.500
 with each other?

00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:43.340
 (laughing)

00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:45.540
 - What, what was the mechanism by me?

00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:50.540
 (laughing)

00:42:50.540 --> 00:42:53.540
 - I got more recent one that's happened, 1988.

00:42:53.540 --> 00:42:54.980
 Someone passed away from laughing

00:42:54.980 --> 00:42:57.540
 while they were watching a fish called Wanda.

00:42:57.540 --> 00:42:58.940
 And they were watching a scene. - Funny film.

00:42:58.940 --> 00:43:00.100
 - Yeah, funny film. - Yeah.

00:43:00.100 --> 00:43:01.940
 They were watching a scene where Michael Palin

00:43:01.940 --> 00:43:04.260
 get some french fries stuffed up his nose.

00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:06.900
 So Michael Palin through a bit of comedy

00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:07.900
 led to someone's death.

00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:10.300
 And what is amazing about that is in the very first episode

00:43:10.300 --> 00:43:12.460
 of Monty Python, Palin was part of the team

00:43:12.460 --> 00:43:14.380
 that wrote about the funniest joke ever

00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:15.580
 that was used in war.

00:43:15.580 --> 00:43:18.340
 And it kind of life-imitated art there, really.

00:43:18.340 --> 00:43:21.860
 - On QI, the TV show that we all work for.

00:43:21.860 --> 00:43:24.980
 Someone wrote to us, probably about 10 years ago,

00:43:24.980 --> 00:43:26.980
 maybe longer, I think it's before all you guys,

00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:29.740
 all you two started and when Dan was still there.

00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:32.260
 And they said that their father was watching QI

00:43:32.260 --> 00:43:33.260
 and died laughing.

00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:34.580
 - No. - Yeah.

00:43:34.580 --> 00:43:36.820
 - And it was obviously said that the father had died,

00:43:36.820 --> 00:43:38.380
 but actually he really loved the show

00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:40.700
 and it was a fitting thing to happen.

00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:42.660
 - Do we know which moment?

00:43:42.660 --> 00:43:44.220
 Was it where the apocalypse is?

00:43:44.220 --> 00:43:45.340
 - So they're not specifying?

00:43:45.340 --> 00:43:46.340
 - No, it was before that.

00:43:46.340 --> 00:43:48.620
 I think it was when we brought a donkey on

00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:49.700
 in theettes of things.

00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:51.500
 (laughing)

00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:53.540
 - It was either the D series or the F series,

00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:55.540
 apparently none of that.

00:43:55.540 --> 00:43:56.700
 But yeah, that's, that happened.

00:43:56.700 --> 00:43:57.540
 - That's very cool.

00:43:57.540 --> 00:43:59.820
 - How nice that he wrote in to say that as well.

00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:02.220
 - But laughing was often seen as not a good thing

00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:03.140
 to be doing.

00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:06.060
 So there are lots of people who prescribed against it.

00:44:06.060 --> 00:44:09.180
 There was a 16th century doctor called La Joubert

00:44:09.180 --> 00:44:11.700
 who described laughter as quite a dangerous thing

00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:13.900
 'cause it could bring on fits and fainting and stuff.

00:44:13.900 --> 00:44:16.340
 And he described it as laughter.

00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:18.180
 He defined as sparkling of eyes,

00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:21.620
 redness of face, sweat coming out of the entire body.

00:44:21.620 --> 00:44:23.580
 If the use of tears, rising of veins

00:44:23.580 --> 00:44:25.340
 and emptying of bowels and bladder.

00:44:25.340 --> 00:44:27.100
 (laughing)

00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:28.700
 - Wow, that's why it's so dangerous

00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:30.340
 taking a cleaning job at Drongless.

00:44:30.340 --> 00:44:33.980
 'Cause people emptied their bowels and bladder

00:44:33.980 --> 00:44:34.820
 with their laughter.

00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:35.660
 - Is that a comedy club?

00:44:35.660 --> 00:44:36.580
 - Yes, it's a comedy club.

00:44:36.580 --> 00:44:37.740
 - Sorry, that was really funny,

00:44:37.740 --> 00:44:40.180
 but I was just trying to hold control of my bowels and bladder.

00:44:40.180 --> 00:44:41.900
 (laughing)

00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:44.620
 - Supposedly Newton never laughed.

00:44:44.620 --> 00:44:47.060
 There's a story that says that he only laughed once

00:44:47.060 --> 00:44:48.220
 in his life when he was asked,

00:44:48.220 --> 00:44:50.300
 what is the point of studying Euclid?

00:44:50.300 --> 00:44:53.220
 - It's classic.

00:44:53.220 --> 00:44:54.260
 - That is a funny one.

00:44:54.260 --> 00:44:57.180
 - And someone who doesn't laugh is called an age elast.

00:44:57.180 --> 00:44:58.340
 - Not really.

00:44:58.340 --> 00:45:01.540
 - I love the word gelastic laughing related.

00:45:01.540 --> 00:45:03.620
 So I think there are people who have sort of

00:45:03.620 --> 00:45:05.780
 gelastic seizures where they can't prevent themselves

00:45:05.780 --> 00:45:07.620
 laughing even if the occasion doesn't call for it

00:45:07.620 --> 00:45:08.700
 or if it's very inappropriate.

00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:09.540
 - That's right.

00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:10.980
 And someone who's a misal gelast is someone

00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:12.420
 who hates laughter.

00:45:12.420 --> 00:45:13.500
 - Is that so?

00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:15.900
 - Gets really annoyed but gets irritated by it.

00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:18.300
 - It was also someone who loves that Japanese soup.

00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:20.420
 (laughing)

00:45:20.420 --> 00:45:23.580
 - I have a study, another study on laughter,

00:45:23.580 --> 00:45:27.460
 which found that the best way to make a baby laugh.

00:45:27.460 --> 00:45:28.300
 - Oh yeah.

00:45:28.300 --> 00:45:29.140
 - Yeah.

00:45:29.140 --> 00:45:30.300
 - And this works, baby's between about six months and two years.

00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:31.140
 - Should we guess?

00:45:31.140 --> 00:45:31.980
 - Yeah.

00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:33.820
 - Did they, are they ticklish?

00:45:33.820 --> 00:45:34.660
 - Oh, okay.

00:45:34.660 --> 00:45:37.900
 So this is normal comedy club rules that you can't tickle

00:45:37.900 --> 00:45:38.900
 the audience.

00:45:38.900 --> 00:45:41.140
 (laughing)

00:45:41.140 --> 00:45:43.900
 - And not used to do that, even if tickles.

00:45:43.900 --> 00:45:45.980
 - Okay, so is it, yeah, done.

00:45:45.980 --> 00:45:47.060
 Did you say peekaboo?

00:45:47.060 --> 00:45:49.460
 - Peekaboo, but I have a son so I've tested.

00:45:49.460 --> 00:45:50.300
 - Yeah, I'm making life.

00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:52.340
 - Have you tested the other methods?

00:45:52.340 --> 00:45:54.940
 - Okay, so scientists measured what made babies laugh

00:45:54.940 --> 00:45:58.020
 and they tried four methods, one of which was peekaboo.

00:45:58.020 --> 00:46:01.820
 One of which, putting a cup on your head.

00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:03.260
 - Okay, I've done that.

00:46:03.260 --> 00:46:04.100
 - That is funny.

00:46:04.100 --> 00:46:04.940
 - That is really funny.

00:46:04.940 --> 00:46:07.980
 - James is doing it now, and I'm laughing.

00:46:07.980 --> 00:46:11.380
 - And I'm now just wondering how flat James's head must be.

00:46:11.380 --> 00:46:12.620
 - Still sitting there.

00:46:12.620 --> 00:46:14.860
 - I don't think I can really talk properly.

00:46:14.860 --> 00:46:17.540
 - Oh, okay, keep it there, keep it there.

00:46:17.540 --> 00:46:18.780
 So one of them is putting a cup on your head.

00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:20.260
 One of them is pretending a toy animal

00:46:20.260 --> 00:46:21.300
 is making the wrong noise.

00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:22.140
 Have you tried that?

00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:24.140
 Taking a toy cat and going, no.

00:46:24.140 --> 00:46:26.060
 Okay, that's worth trying.

00:46:26.060 --> 00:46:28.420
 And then the last one is apparently stuffing your mouth

00:46:28.420 --> 00:46:31.820
 with material, just like filling your mouth with cloth.

00:46:31.820 --> 00:46:34.860
 - Okay, apparently there are five categories

00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:37.100
 of action type laughter.

00:46:37.100 --> 00:46:39.420
 So there are categories of verbal laughter,

00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:40.620
 like types of joke that make you laugh.

00:46:40.620 --> 00:46:42.820
 And then things you can do to make someone laugh.

00:46:42.820 --> 00:46:45.740
 This I should specify is according to this 16th century

00:46:45.740 --> 00:46:49.620
 doctor, called Lauren Zubat, who had disapproved of laughter.

00:46:49.620 --> 00:46:52.540
 But he said, laughter is divided into five categories.

00:46:52.540 --> 00:46:55.340
 Category number one is exposure of the genitals.

00:46:55.340 --> 00:46:56.860
 (laughing)

00:46:56.860 --> 00:46:57.700
 - One whole category.

00:46:57.700 --> 00:47:01.460
 - Can it, it's an old faithful Louis C. K. Rides again.

00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:03.660
 (laughing)

00:47:03.660 --> 00:47:05.660
 - Category number two, a separate category,

00:47:05.660 --> 00:47:07.580
 exposure of the arse.

00:47:07.580 --> 00:47:10.380
 Different, different kind of humor altogether.

00:47:10.380 --> 00:47:11.220
 - It is different.

00:47:11.220 --> 00:47:12.700
 - Category number three is a pratful,

00:47:12.700 --> 00:47:14.380
 which is falling on the arse.

00:47:14.380 --> 00:47:17.020
 And then there are two more which are unrelated.

00:47:17.020 --> 00:47:19.540
 Misapprehension of taste, so mistaking something

00:47:19.540 --> 00:47:21.380
 that smells really bad for something

00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:22.460
 that smells really good.

00:47:22.460 --> 00:47:25.180
 - And stuffing your mouth full of cloth.

00:47:25.180 --> 00:47:28.180
 (laughing)

00:47:28.180 --> 00:47:29.500
 - That's correct.

00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:30.580
 I just love that.

00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:33.540
 Drop moaning someone and showing your testicles

00:47:33.540 --> 00:47:37.020
 or founding two completely different categories of comedy.

00:47:37.020 --> 00:47:37.940
 (laughing)

00:47:37.940 --> 00:47:39.700
 - They hated the category one stuff tonight,

00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:41.860
 but they really went for the category two.

00:47:41.860 --> 00:47:43.100
 (laughing)

00:47:43.100 --> 00:47:45.700
 (upbeat music)

00:47:45.700 --> 00:47:48.220
 - Okay, that's it.

00:47:48.220 --> 00:47:49.220
 That is all of our facts.

00:47:49.220 --> 00:47:50.540
