00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:17.020
 - Hello, and welcome to another episode

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.320
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.760
 from four undisclosed locations in the UK.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.720
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.400
 with James Harkin, Anna Tijinski, and Andrew Hunter Murray,

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.720
 and once again, we have gathered round the microphones

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.600
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.600
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.720
 Starting with you, Anna.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.040
 - My fact this week is that golden moulds shine

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.000
 in all the colors of the rainbow, and they'll never know it.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.560
 - Oh, that's sad. - Wow.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.520
 - It's what a tragic fact to open with.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.920
 - Is it because they're stupid?

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.960
 They don't even know their moulds.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.360
 Is this the reason I said?

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.280
 - They don't know their moulds.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.560
 They don't have a concept of color.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.000
 They don't know what a rainbow is.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.440
 There's a lot of reasons why, but...

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.160
 - It made me wonder if there were things

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.320
 that we don't know about, you know what I mean?

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.560
 It's like, and we're not smart enough to know what they are.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.600
 So it could be that there are amazing colors

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.760
 that no one knows what they are that we give off, or smells.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.040
 - Yeah, so dogs are doing a podcast saying,

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.200
 did you know humans smell exactly like, I don't know,

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.480
 rotting mushrooms, and they'll never know it.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.240
 (laughing)

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.240
 - They've got the word dickhead written on their forehead,

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.680
 and they have no idea.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.920
 (laughing)

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.960
 - Anyway, so back to the old moulds.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.400
 I read about them in this fantastic article

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.480
 in the London Review of Books.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.880
 It's by Catherine Rondle, and this is about the golden mould,

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.680
 and it's the first known iridescent mammal.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.040
 So iridescent means it shimmers, like, you know,

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.880
 when you spill petrol, or in soap bubbles,

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.240
 or a pigeon's neck.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.680
 So they have this amazing fur,

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.720
 which is a very specific structure,

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.280
 which reflects and reflects light

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.000
 in a way that causes this rainbow effect to happen,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.440
 but they are totally blind.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.840
 So usually iridescence in nature is for attracting mates,

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.120
 or maybe warning off a predator to suggest

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.280
 that you're poisonous.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.000
 But this serves absolutely no purpose whatsoever.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.920
 They're underground almost the whole time.

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.600
 They do have eyeballs, weirdly.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.960
 We think the optic nerve isn't really functioning anymore.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.560
 They have eyeballs, but their eyeballs

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.720
 are covered with skin and fur, so aren't doing that much good.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.200
 So yeah, they'll never know.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.280
 And we think that it's possibly to repel water,

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.520
 this particular sheen,

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.400
 or it could be to help them skid through holes

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.800
 when they're digging holes in the sand.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:39.800
 They can go really quickly,

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.120
 because they have these amazing scale-like things on them.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.000
 But the colour is just a byproduct of that, right?

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.440
 Yeah, it's one of those accidental bits of evolution,

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.200
 which is surprisingly rare, exactly,

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.600
 so that they've evolved to have this very specific structure

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.760
 to make them slippery.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.520
 And it happens, so that's all rainbow as well.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.000
 So they live in the deserts of southern Africa,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.720
 and I've seen videos of them

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.800
 and how they travel through the sand.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.120
 But what's really funny is, when you're watching the videos,

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.200
 is they swim through the sand very close to the surface,

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.480
 so you know where they're going.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.560
 It's like someone trying to escape jail

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.480
 by digging a tunnel under the outside,

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.440
 but doing it right at the surface.

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.440
 So you always know where they are.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.880
 But they're really cool the way they hunt,

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.760
 because I think we may have seen the same thing, Dan.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.280
 They come out of the ground,

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.760
 and then they hunt, because they're blind,

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.920
 they hunt by listening to the animals passing nearby,

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.000
 and they're mostly eating little insects and things.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.640
 And the thing is, they can hear a lot better through sand

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:37.800
 than they can through air,

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.800
 so they'll just completely plunge their head into a pile of sand

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.200
 just to check where their prey is,

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.960
 and then they'll get a hear of its footsteps

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.040
 and then they'll move that way.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.240
 It's really funny.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.960
 They have, in your ear you have three little bones,

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.640
 you might remember, like the hammer, the anvil, and the stirrup,

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.560
 and their hammer is massive.

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.920
 It's like Thor's hammer inside their head.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.840
 It's 10,000 times bigger than our hammer in our head.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.720
 And the way that this helps them

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.880
 is when there are vibrations that come into their head,

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.200
 it resonates and it makes the sound way, way louder,

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.640
 which means they can hear specific frequencies

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:14.880
 really, really well.

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.560
 And so they can hear the frequency,

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.080
 which is about the same as wind rustling through grass,

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:23.080
 and they can hear that specific frequency really, really well.

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.080
 So when they're going around,

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.560
 they can just listen to where these tufts of grass are,

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:27.480
 and why is that useful?

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.200
 Because that's where the insects live.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.960
 So they just hear this specific sound of wind going through grass,

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.000
 they know exactly where it is,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.440
 and they head straight for it and they get their termites.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:37.760
 It's so clever.

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.280
 Not so useful in the deserts of Southern Africa.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.760
 What do you mean?

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.200
 Well, it's sandy.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.600
 Yes, but they have little tufts of grass in the desert, right?

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.840
 And in those tufts of grass, that's where the termites live.

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.240
 The termites don't live in the sand,

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.920
 they live underneath the grass where there's a little bit of soil.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.960
 So that's exactly where they need to get to.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.920
 There aren't many of them around, you're right, but...

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.720
 It would be pretty silly for them to evolve this incredible ability

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.400
 in a bone 10,000 times the size of ours,

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.440
 if they lived in a completely featureless environment.

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.040
 It would be stupid if they evolved

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.320
 so they could only hear ice cream vans, for instance.

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.200
 Because you don't get many ice cream vans there,

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.560
 but you do get tufts of grass.

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.240
 Yeah. God, I bet they'd kill for an ice cream van, though.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.360
 That's true. There's one part of their body that's a lot smaller

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.800
 than the bone in their middle ear, which is massive.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:28.880
 It's their penis.

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.480
 Oh, here we go.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.720
 So this is the disadvantage of being a golden mole,

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.400
 and it's very important to them.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.800
 So there is a hot and hot golden mole,

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.720
 that's one of the species' names,

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.000
 and females prefer males with bigger penises.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.200
 And the reason for that is that they have no other means

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.960
 of differentiating between males.

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.880
 They're all underground, they're all blind,

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.160
 there's no way of telling who's an appropriate mate or not,

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.280
 apart from penis size.

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.720
 And the whole penis is approximately

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.800
 a millimetre and a half long.

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.600
 It's not huge.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:02.960
 Proportionally, is that OK?

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.360
 It's still quite small. It's still tiny.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:07.000
 Proportionally, it's still small.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.200
 It is quite, yeah.

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:09.400
 And they don't even have a scrotum,

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:10.800
 so they can't be judged on that.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.840
 So the whole penis is between 1.2 and 2.5 millimetres long,

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:15.760
 which is a tenth of an inch.

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:16.600
 I mean, just to be clear,

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.360
 we're not judging them on anything, are we, Andy?

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.760
 Well, speak for yourself, I am.

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.520
 Just, just, just.

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.480
 There's not many people Andy can judge on this particular metric,

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.320
 but the one millimetre penis golden mole.

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.520
 You betcha.

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:36.520
 Those idiots with their even smaller penises.

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:37.520
 Just.

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:42.440
 Oh, my God.

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.520
 I was reading the other day.

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.960
 In fact, this might have been something that was written by you, Andy.

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.520
 I'm not sure about scrotums.

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:54.480
 And about how all mammals used to live.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:57.440
 Sorry, has Andy been publishing scrotum papers

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.520
 in the background of this podcast?

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:02.840
 It's about how they're much too big at scrotums.

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.680
 And they make perfectly reasonable penises.

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:07.920
 Looks small.

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:12.280
 Right, it was about how all mammals used to live.

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:15.400
 Used to be nocturnal and used to hunt at night.

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:18.120
 And the reason was,

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:21.200
 one of the reasons was it was much colder at night.

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:24.200
 And if you were in the daytime, it was too hot.

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:25.880
 And if you didn't have a scrotum,

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:29.840
 your testicles would be inside your body and they get too hot.

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:33.320
 And so one of the things that allowed mammals to live during the day

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:36.120
 was scrotums, because then the testicles hung outside,

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:37.000
 which is a bit cooler,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.360
 which meant they could spend time in the sunshine.

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:40.280
 Oh, wow.

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:45.160
 So without scrotums, we'd all be living at night.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:46.360
 That's very cool.

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:47.480
 Yeah, great theory.

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:48.800
 Was that one of your papers, Andy?

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.720
 You don't seem to have a very good memory of it, of course.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:51.800
 I write, to be honest,

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.720
 I write so many papers about the scrotum,

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:56.920
 but it's hard to differentiate them.

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:58.280
 And do they even like mating, though?

00:07:58.280 --> 00:07:59.920
 Because they're super anti-social.

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:02.360
 In fact, all mammals are really anti-social, aren't they?

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:06.400
 But golden moles don't hang out together at all, massive loners.

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.160
 And I think they're quite bad parents.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.320
 Again, in common with normal moles,

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:14.400
 which after when their kids are just a couple of weeks old,

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:16.680
 I think they literally take them in the burrow,

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:20.280
 they shove them up to the top and then they seal the entrance.

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:23.880
 So their baby is just then stranded and they've got a bugger off.

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:24.960
 You could say the golden moles,

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:27.720
 they are the massive loners with the tiny boners.

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:29.640
 That's how you can remember what they are.

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:32.040
 Yeah, that's a tagline.

00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:34.000
 That's what you're chanting as you go through the desert,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.960
 bullying them, isn't it?

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:40.920
 Yeah, moles like actual moles.

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:43.360
 You're right, they're really, they are loners.

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.520
 They don't like to go anywhere near each other.

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:47.320
 And each animal has a territory

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:49.160
 which is about the size of a football pitch.

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:49.800
 Whoa.

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:51.200
 That's a lot, isn't it?

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:53.640
 For each, for one mole.

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:54.800
 That's greedy.

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.800
 That's a lot of real estate.

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:57.600
 That's insane.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:00.920
 We should say, yeah, the golden mole is extremely mole-like.

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:02.120
 And I think it should be a mole

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:03.920
 because it does everything that moles do.

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:05.760
 But it's actually not an official mole.

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:07.720
 It's miles away from it on the taxonomic tree

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:09.640
 and they're more closely related to elephants

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:10.760
 than they are to moles.

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:14.120
 And in fact, according to the Wikipedia page,

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:17.200
 it's at the moment classified as a chrysochloridite,

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:18.720
 but that's under review.

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:21.120
 So we're kind of unclear where we put them on the evolutionary tree.

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:21.920
 What does that mean?

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:24.480
 It just means that they're classified as something.

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:26.640
 But we're not really sure where they are.

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:29.200
 And, you know, we might move them to another bit of the tree.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.440
 The Wikipedia page on them is really good.

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:34.280
 I don't know who wrote it, but some real expert.

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:36.040
 I guess you would have to be an expert on the golden mole

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:36.680
 to write about it.

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:38.600
 Yeah, I can.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:41.680
 No, but some of, you know, it's, I just shout out to Wikipedia

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:43.600
 because it's very clearly written and comprehensive.

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:45.720
 It also has this fact, which I loved.

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:49.440
 They have only one toe on each forefoot,

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:51.720
 which has evolved into the shape of a pickaxe.

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:53.480
 And all the other toes on their front feet

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:55.600
 have kind of withered away.

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:59.280
 So they are so efficient at digging through the sand

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:00.120
 that they need to get through.

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:01.560
 Oh, cool. Yeah.

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:03.680
 And that actually is a bit different to moles, isn't it?

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:06.720
 Because moles have those kind of big paddles on their feet

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:07.920
 where they push through the sand.

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:10.840
 But the golden moles, because they swim more like a shark,

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:11.640
 they've got to be slicker.

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:15.120
 Yeah, they're sometimes known as the shark of the dunes, aren't they?

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:16.040
 Are they? Yeah.

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:17.920
 And I think that's because, like Dan says,

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:19.880
 they're so close to the surface.

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:22.320
 They've probably got one of their pickaxes sticking up.

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:25.280
 So you can, well, maybe even though one millimeter penis sticking up,

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:27.320
 out of the sand, so you can see it.

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:30.080
 That's when we're doing backstroke.

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:32.400
 I just got one thing on moles.

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:36.120
 In 1519, a community in Italy launched a massive court case

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:40.240
 against moles on the grounds that they were damaging crops.

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:43.040
 And you can read the full sort of transcript

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:46.440
 of what the attorney's arguments were against and for the moles.

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:48.760
 And so the attorney for the defense of the moles,

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:50.200
 the moles couldn't come to court.

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:52.880
 So the attorney spoke for them in absentia,

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:55.480
 said they confer all these benefits.

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:58.320
 So they destroy nocturnal insects, for instance.

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:00.720
 And he eventually argued successfully

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:03.000
 that if they are sentenced to be exiled,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.720
 they should be found a suitable place of abode

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:08.080
 and have safe conduct on the way there

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:10.800
 to secure them from harm from cats and dogs, et cetera.

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:13.160
 And the judge is there, and you can read his ruling,

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:16.320
 where he did in fact agree the moles were to be exiled,

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:18.000
 but they were given safe conduct.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.360
 And any pregnant mole or mole with young children

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:25.360
 had an extra 14 days to leave the community.

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:29.640
 There's no evidence as to how this was actually enforced afterwards.

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:31.640
 - Quite often what happened with those kind of things

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:35.960
 is they would say, okay, well, let's say for instance rats.

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:38.040
 There are rats here, we need to get rid of them.

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:41.480
 So we're gonna make a law to say they have to go within 14 days.

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:43.600
 And then when they haven't got in 14 days, they go,

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:45.760
 okay, well, we gave you a chance.

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:48.080
 We're now gonna exterminate you.

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:50.840
 - There's like killing God's creatures, isn't it?

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:53.560
 You have to give, 'cause you shouldn't be destroying

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:58.000
 too much of God's creation without having legal authority to do it.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
 Mole prison would be amazing though.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.240
 That would be a really fun thing to film,

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:05.960
 because obviously they'd all just tunnel away immediately.

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:08.480
 - The Great Escape would be a much longer film.

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:15.320
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that's my fact.

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:19.600
 My fact this week is that Mozart and Beethoven both compose music

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:22.520
 for an instrument made entirely of glass.

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:26.600
 It was invented by Benjamin Franklin.

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:30.840
 Benjamin Franklin invented what was an incredible instrument,

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:33.880
 hugely popular in the 1700s,

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:36.640
 and so massive that it was used by some

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:38.080
 of the biggest composers of the day.

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:40.600
 I had no idea there was a connection between Franklin

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:42.760
 and say Mozart and Beethoven.

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:44.760
 That's like, you know, hearing.

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:46.640
 - Come on, Franklin's connected to everyone.

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:48.960
 He was the Giles Brandrith officer.

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:52.000
 I mean, he knew everyone and he did everything.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.920
 - So Dan, why don't you tell us about this glass instrument?

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:56.560
 Was it like a violin made of glass

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:57.600
 or a drum made of glass?

00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:59.240
 That wouldn't work.

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:00.800
 - Yeah, so it's called an armonica,

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:03.520
 and effectively it's kind of like a glass piano.

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:10.160
 So Franklin in the 1700s was seeing a lot of people play glass bowls

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:12.480
 that are tuned to notes, which you still see a lot of people doing.

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:14.000
 You know that thing with the wine glass?

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.920
 If you lick your finger and you run it over the lid and it's...

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:20.720
 - Yeah, basically when the conversation dries up enough

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:23.280
 in a wedding, everyone starts doing that.

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:24.320
 - Yes, exactly.

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:26.720
 And so he thought this is really beautiful music

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:28.480
 and you can see people making tunes out of it.

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:31.240
 The problem is, is that if you were going to play that at a gig,

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:33.200
 you have to line up 50 glasses.

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:35.520
 It's not practical because you could smash one

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:37.360
 and suddenly that's your C note gone.

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:39.240
 So what he did was he created an instrument

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:42.320
 whereby he had a glassblower in London

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:46.520
 turn it into effectively like a piano that you play.

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:49.960
 - And just to say when you play it, it works by a foot pedal, right?

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:51.720
 So he made it horizontal.

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:53.800
 So usually you'd have the glasses standing up vertically,

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:55.560
 so you have to hold them down with one hand

00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:58.360
 and we've all done it at dinner parties.

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:00.920
 But he put them horizontally and attached them more than a row

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:03.520
 and then you spun them round constantly with a foot pedal.

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:05.040
 So I think you just had to sort of...

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:07.680
 If you touched it with your hands, it would be constantly spinning.

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:11.800
 But then I can't work out where you put the jar of water.

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:12.880
 - I must watch a video of it

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:16.000
 because you've got to keep moistening your hands to keep it working.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.160
 So presumably you have to dip it like a finger ball.

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:19.160
 - Yeah, you have to do that.

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:20.800
 Although quite soon afterwards,

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:23.520
 there was a new version that was made like an improvement

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:26.360
 where there was a little trough of water underneath the glasses.

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:29.640
 So when they span, they kind of got moistened by themselves,

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:30.600
 which is quite clever.

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:32.440
 - That's crafty.

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:35.800
 - It went from being a hugely popular instrument

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:38.480
 to suddenly a lot of controversy

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:41.360
 because people started noticing a few things about it

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:44.120
 and reporting that it was sending people mad.

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:45.640
 - Oh yeah, that's right.

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:48.240
 - Yeah, and that in some cases,

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:51.680
 a few deaths were supposedly off the back of it.

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:54.560
 And suddenly books were publishing

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:56.360
 that this was a dangerous instrument.

00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:57.280
 And then suddenly they were saying

00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:59.280
 it was the most dangerous instrument in the world.

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:00.840
 And its reputation... - It's really unfair.

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:02.120
 - Yeah, it's extraordinary.

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:05.400
 It basically, fake news took it down as an instrument.

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:08.960
 And there was a lot of theory that possibly there's a bit of truth

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:10.720
 to why people were sent mad,

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:12.600
 which was off the back of the instrument itself

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:16.080
 and licking your fingers on an instrument all the time.

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:19.480
 - So the theory was that there were crystal balls

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:22.520
 and they were on this harmonica spindle.

00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:24.840
 And they contain some lead.

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:28.000
 And some people thought maybe the lead from the balls,

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.880
 'cause you can play with both hands.

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:31.120
 If you haven't broad enough span,

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:32.760
 you can play 10 notes at the same time.

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:33.600
 It's quite impressive.

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:38.600
 And people thought you can maybe absorb lead into your fingers

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:40.200
 if that kills you, blah, blah, blah, lead poisoning.

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:42.200
 However, it has also been pointed out

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:44.200
 that this is unbelievably unlikely.

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:46.840
 Because at the time that the harmonica was being played,

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:49.760
 doctors widely prescribed massive doses of lead

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:51.080
 for various ailments.

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:52.960
 Food was preserved with lead oxide.

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:54.400
 Food was cooked in lead pots.

00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:56.680
 People drank from lead vessels.

00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:59.320
 Like the main lead risk in the 18th century

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:01.400
 was not the glass harmonica.

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:05.200
 (all laughing)

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:07.560
 - I think it's just 'cause it was spooky.

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:09.520
 - It makes a very ethereal noise.

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:13.520
 And also it was used by podcast favourite Franz Mesmer,

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:14.360
 wasn't it? - Yes.

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:16.560
 - So he used to go around mesmerizing people.

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:18.840
 We've talked about him before, hypnotizing people.

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:20.480
 And he used the harmonica

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:23.480
 because it does make this very ghostly noise.

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:26.360
 And so it was associated with hypnotizing ladies.

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:27.640
 It's always ladies.

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:31.440
 It's just all part of the constant 19th century panic

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:34.520
 that anything women did that might be slightly challenging

00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:36.560
 or might slightly encroach on the world of men

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:38.280
 must send them mad and cause them to faint

00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:40.000
 so they should be banned from doing it.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.960
 - But actually all the best players of this instrument

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:44.720
 were women, right?

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:47.880
 So the first person to publish a book about it

00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:49.040
 was called Anne Ford.

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:52.040
 She published it in 1761.

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:54.080
 She was married to a friend of Gainsborough

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:56.000
 who was called Philip Thickness,

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.560
 which is quite a good name.

00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:00.000
 And she was the person who actually came up

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.560
 with the idea of turning the glasses

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:02.600
 into an actual instrument.

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:04.760
 Whether Franklin took the idea from her and did it

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:07.440
 or whether they came up with independently, I don't know.

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:09.440
 But there was also someone called Marianne Davis

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:10.720
 who was the most famous player,

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:12.480
 probably in the whole of Europe.

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:14.680
 And she went around Europe and taught it.

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:18.880
 And like Mozart met her and Mesmer, I think,

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.440
 watched her play and then decided

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:22.640
 to bring it into his mesmerization and stuff.

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:24.520
 So she was super famous.

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:26.240
 - Yeah, there was a double Marianne.

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:28.200
 It was a Marianne sandwich,

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:29.400
 although not with anything in the middle

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:31.640
 'cause she was the one who popularized it in Europe.

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:34.200
 And then maybe the best player of ever

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:37.400
 was this German lady called Marianne Kirchgesner.

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:39.040
 And Mozart towards the end of his life

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:42.480
 wrote lots of stuff specifically for her on the Armonica.

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:43.560
 And actually when he died,

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:46.080
 he was in the middle of writing her another piece.

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:47.440
 And she was very famous.

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:48.600
 She was another jazz brand.

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:52.360
 She sort of knew everyone like Goethe and Haydn.

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:54.080
 But maybe there was some truth

00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:56.240
 to the Armonica cursing people

00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:59.360
 because she had sort of a nervous breakdown.

00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:01.600
 - Yeah, in fact, all of the people who played it

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:03.160
 in the 18th century, all dead.

00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:06.120
 That was such a good fight.

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:08.840
 - Marianne Kirchgesner was assaulted

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:11.400
 by Napoleon's soldiers in 1806.

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:12.960
 And she never really recovered from that.

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:14.800
 So that was more the cause of her nervous breakdown,

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:17.560
 I think, rather than the instrument.

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:21.560
 - Yeah, there's a great line about it from 1786.

00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:24.520
 This is a German player called Karl Röhlig.

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:27.440
 He said that the Armonica could make women faint,

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:29.520
 send a dog into convulsions,

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:31.920
 make a sleeping girl wake screaming

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:33.800
 through a cord of the diminished seventh

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:36.560
 and even cause the death of one very young.

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:38.560
 And that was the guy who played it for a living.

00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:39.760
 - Yeah. - Like a recommendation.

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:42.120
 - I think someone actually did die, didn't they?

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:44.560
 At the time that someone was playing a glass Armonica

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:46.080
 and it was like a cause and effect thing.

00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:47.120
 Everyone was like, oh my God,

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:50.000
 it must have been glass Armonica that caused it.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.080
 And that was like the start of the big sort of banning it.

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:54.760
 They banned it in churches and stuff like that.

00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:56.000
 Didn't they in Germany?

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.640
 - So Dan, you mentioned that Franklin picked up

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:00.200
 this glass Armonica idea

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:03.240
 by watching people play musical wine glasses.

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:06.080
 And he actually did that in Britain.

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:07.920
 So in Britain and Ireland,

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:10.720
 this was an extremely popular musical instrument

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:12.640
 before Franklin made it vaguely acceptable

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:13.720
 to the rest of the world.

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:15.840
 There would be concert halls that filled out with people

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:17.840
 just spinning their fingers around wine glasses.

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:20.440
 And the most famous player was this amazing guy

00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:23.040
 called Richard Puckridge or Puckridge.

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:24.800
 You know, there are various spellings.

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:25.960
 But have you guys read about him?

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:27.520
 He's amazing. - He's amazing.

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:28.360
 I love him.

00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:30.000
 He's the best. - He's super fun.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.320
 So he was a self proclaimed inventor of musical glasses.

00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:37.040
 He spent, he had all sorts of crazy ideas

00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:38.320
 for how to make us fortune.

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:40.640
 So he designed wings for human flight.

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:42.080
 Don't think they took off.

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:45.360
 He said, he had this idea.

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:48.280
 He wrote this paper about how you could regain youth

00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:50.880
 by injecting yourself with the blood of young maids.

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:52.760
 And so he recommended blood transfusions

00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:55.720
 between young maids and anyone over 60.

00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:56.560
 - Just on that.

00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:58.560
 So when he came up with that idea,

00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:01.000
 people took him quite seriously, some people.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.240
 And there was a big kind of hoo-ha

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:05.880
 in the burial industry and the funeral industry.

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:06.720
 Cause they were like, well,

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:08.200
 if people are going to live forever,

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:10.320
 then what are we going to do for a living?

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:13.320
 And so he supposedly agreed that everyone

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:15.840
 who was having this treatment would sign a contract

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:18.720
 that as soon as they reached 999 years old,

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:20.360
 they would have to pay a funeral company

00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:21.800
 for the price of a burial.

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:23.160
 - Wow. - Oh my God.

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:25.960
 - I think they discussed that in parliament, didn't they?

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:28.040
 That was their token nod to what?

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:28.880
 His ridiculous idea.

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:30.000
 - It's such a funny idea.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.360
 But what do the funeral people do for the first 900 years?

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:34.920
 They're looking at that money.

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:36.000
 It's so weird.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000
 - I think they discussed that in parliament, didn't they?

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.200
 That was their token nod to what his ridiculous idea.

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:44.360
 I liked, he had an account once of doing a concert

00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:46.760
 where three hours before the performance,

00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:48.920
 he was going to do a concert on his glasses,

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:49.920
 which was quite fragile.

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:51.720
 And three hours before the performance,

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:54.160
 a large, unmanly pig entered the room

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:56.120
 and smashed the whole machine to pieces.

00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:59.480
 - That's an excuse for someone who hasn't done the homework,

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:01.360
 hasn't learned the piece that they're going to need to play.

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:03.520
 They have a brilliant brainwave, they think, get me a pig.

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:05.520
 - Sorry, a pig at my instrument.

00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:08.400
 It's like, there was another thing I saw.

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:10.080
 It was a newspaper article.

00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:12.120
 He took out an advert to apologize

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:15.200
 because he'd done a concert that everyone thought was terrible.

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:17.960
 And the advert said, "Mr. Potkrich takes this opportunity

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:20.320
 "to apologize to the public for their disappointment.

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:23.520
 "He added a glass too much to his instrument."

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:26.760
 And I can't tell whether that means he put one glass in there

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:28.600
 and it meant all his notes were off,

00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:30.920
 or whether it's a euphemism for, "I got really pissed

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:32.400
 "and I couldn't do the concert."

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:34.960
 It sounds like it doesn't it? - I think it's that, yeah.

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:36.440
 - That's true. - That's so good.

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:39.840
 Another band instrument during the early 1900s

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:43.760
 was the saxophone, Nazi Germany bandit.

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:45.200
 They saw it as a symbol of jazz.

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:46.840
 So it wasn't that it was turning you

00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:50.320
 into a different mental state.

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:53.520
 It was purely that they didn't like it at all.

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:57.200
 But church's bandit as well in the early 1900s,

00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:59.640
 the Vatican bandit in 1914.

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:02.160
 And I just love, I've never thought of a saxophone

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:03.720
 being in the Vatican church. - No.

00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:06.680
 - Sort of busting out a solo.

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:09.120
 What an image, but yeah, they banned it.

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:11.560
 So maybe we'll never get to see it.

00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:15.280
 Obviously there was the thought that it suggested

00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:17.360
 and promoted sexual dancing.

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:20.800
 So that was a thing that they wanted to avoid as well.

00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:23.920
 - That is like a church sort of banning gangster rap

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:25.160
 in churches though, isn't it?

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:26.480
 It's like people going,

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:28.480
 "We weren't going to do this anyway, guys.

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:29.320
 Don't worry about it."

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:32.200
 - It's like me as a 14-year-old banning supermodel

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:33.320
 from my birthday party.

00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:35.720
 There was never any prospect.

00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:41.000
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.240
 and that is Andy.

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:46.640
 - My fact is that envelopes used to be made of clay.

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:49.240
 - Wow, so...

00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:50.520
 - That must have been a hard job

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:53.600
 being a postman in those days, right?

00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:55.720
 - Yeah, so this was...

00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:57.920
 We're used to envelopes being made of paper, obviously.

00:22:57.920 --> 00:22:59.800
 What we think of as the classic material for them,

00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:01.840
 but it's not, it's not the original.

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:06.600
 So this is in Babylonian era times,

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:09.440
 in 2000 BC, give or take,

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:11.560
 what you would do if you were writing a message to someone,

00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:14.600
 you would write a message on a clay tablet,

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:15.880
 and that would dry,

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:17.800
 and then that would be the thing that you were sending,

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:20.800
 but you wouldn't send that just open

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:21.880
 because anyone could read it.

00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:23.280
 So you needed an envelope,

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:25.440
 and to make that, you would put more wet clay

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:28.960
 over the tablet, press the ends together to seal it,

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:31.760
 and then you put the whole thing in a kiln, bake it,

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:34.760
 and then you send that massive baked package of clay,

00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:37.080
 and the recipient has to smash it open,

00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:40.560
 the outer envelope, to receive the tablet

00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:42.280
 that's on the inside, and that's what you do.

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:45.360
 - That's a pretty exciting way of opening a letter, isn't it?

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:47.080
 Smashing it with a hammer. - It is.

00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:47.920
 - Yeah.

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:51.800
 - I always think sometimes I rip the end off an envelope

00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:54.920
 to get the inside rather than opening it up with the seal,

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:56.840
 and I always think I'm pretty cool when I do that,

00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:57.840
 but this is even better.

00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:00.680
 - Just imagine this is the next level, yeah?

00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:01.760
 Imagine what fun you would have had

00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:02.840
 if they'd been in Babylonia.

00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:04.600
 (laughing)

00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:07.000
 - For people's birthdays must have been interesting,

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.080
 'cause I mean, you just spent about six hours

00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:11.640
 beasing away at clay.

00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:14.920
 - There really aren't very many samples

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:15.760
 of these things around,

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:18.960
 'cause obviously they were designed to be smashed on delivery.

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:20.920
 There are some, thank goodness, but yeah.

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:22.200
 - Yeah, because Pierce Fletcher,

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:24.320
 the producer of QI's got one.

00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:25.160
 - Has he?

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:26.960
 - Yeah, he bought one when he was in,

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:29.400
 I think he was in Iraq or something many, many years ago,

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:31.040
 but he bought one.

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:33.800
 It's dated to 2028 BC.

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:35.520
 He knows when it's dated to,

00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:37.760
 and he says you can see the thumbprint

00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:39.920
 left of the person who put it in the kiln

00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:42.680
 on the thing, which gives it some kind of human touch,

00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:44.680
 but he says that it was an invoice

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:47.200
 for a consignment of animal fodder,

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:49.880
 which is not exactly the most exciting thing,

00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:52.240
 'cause none of us can read Cuneiform,

00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:53.640
 which is what it was written in, right?

00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:55.600
 So he might as well have said it was a love letter

00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:56.880
 to someone or something, but.

00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:59.400
 (laughing)

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:00.840
 - They very rarely were, they weren't they?

00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:02.880
 It was all accounting.

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:04.400
 I'm glad you clarified why he has it,

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:06.440
 'cause genuinely I thought that was just a dig

00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:07.600
 at Pierce Fletcher's age,

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:09.360
 'cause he is a middle-aged man.

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:11.080
 I just thought you were claiming that's how he--

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:13.040
 - He got it for his 21st birthday.

00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:14.640
 He's got a few of them, yeah.

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:17.200
 (laughing)

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:18.640
 - Didn't it used to be the case as well

00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:20.800
 that a lot of these, and it was Sumerian

00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:22.200
 and Babylonian, wasn't it?

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:25.360
 And they'd have the same stuff written on the outside

00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:26.680
 as on the inside.

00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:29.000
 So a lot of the time they were used

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.920
 as protection against fraud.

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:34.040
 And so these are the very oldest ones.

00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:35.960
 Basically, you'd have a record of a transaction,

00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:37.920
 like I've sold you this many bumblebees

00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:42.000
 for this many dinars, and you put that in your clay,

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.120
 and then you sealed it up,

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:46.840
 and then you wrote exactly the same thing on the envelope.

00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:48.840
 And the way it worked was, when the recipient got it,

00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:50.680
 if there was a dispute over whether the envelope

00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:53.120
 had been tampered with, then you smashed it open

00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:54.440
 to check the inside.

00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:55.560
 - Oh, okay.

00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:57.640
 - It was to make sure they were the same inside and out,

00:25:57.640 --> 00:26:00.000
 'cause otherwise you could melt the clay, soften it,

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:00.840
 and then change--

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:02.400
 - Oh, put an extra zero on.

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:04.560
 I wanted this many dinars, very crap.

00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:06.200
 - Or this many bees. - Exactly.

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:08.480
 - Yeah, it's very open to dispute.

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:11.480
 You get a lot of envelopes that you can see

00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:15.040
 in like postage museums that have got holes punched in them,

00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:16.960
 and that's because they used to fumigate them

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:18.880
 when there were pandemics

00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:20.920
 and when there were diseases going around.

00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:23.880
 So like, for instance, when there was yellow fever around,

00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:25.320
 people would put little holes in,

00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:28.520
 and they would fire like formaldehyde gas or smoke

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:31.920
 or whatever to try and kill the pathogens.

00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:35.520
 And if you send a letter to any zip code in America

00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:39.080
 that begins 202, 203, 204, or 205,

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:43.040
 then it will be irradiated before it gets there.

00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:46.440
 And that's because they are the zip codes of Washington, DC,

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:48.120
 around the federal agencies,

00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:50.040
 and they go to a special place

00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:51.560
 where they're put on a conveyor belt

00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:53.280
 and they're fired radiation at them,

00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:56.600
 which will kill any bacteria, any viruses, anthrax,

00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:57.800
 all that kind of stuff.

00:26:57.800 --> 00:26:59.760
 Then they're aired out and then they're sent.

00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:02.560
 So if you're Donald Trump and you get a letter,

00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:05.120
 it's gonna be quite faded and crispy

00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:06.200
 and a little bit yellow.

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:08.800
 That's all his mail is gonna be a little bit like that

00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:10.360
 because it's gone through this process.

00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:11.440
 Yeah, it's so cool.

00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:14.640
 And that was a response, wasn't it, to the anthrax spores

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:17.840
 that they were put in the post in Washington in about 2001.

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:18.880
 And five people died,

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:21.320
 and there were lots of facilities contaminated,

00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:24.080
 so this is kind of their way of dealing with that.

00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:26.120
 Apparently, people who work at the Royal Mail say,

00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:28.600
 one of the serious problems they have,

00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:30.840
 the sorters who have to sort through the envelopes,

00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:33.160
 is that people don't seal their envelopes.

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:34.840
 And there's lots of complaining about this online,

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:35.680
 and they say it's very annoying

00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:37.920
 because often you have to match a card with its envelope

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:38.960
 and it's hard to do.

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:41.440
 I imagine there are lots of sort of missent things

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:44.280
 where the wrong card's been put in the wrong envelope.

00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:45.600
 And they don't know why people do it,

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:49.480
 but there's speculation that it's based on the old paper rate.

00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:52.960
 So this was something that was abolished in 1969,

00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:55.600
 but I believe Piers Fletcher formerly mentioned

00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:58.520
 "Centre of Cuneiform Tablets" does remember it.

00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:00.480
 He's posted about this on the forums before.

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:02.760
 And this was, if you wanted to send printed matter,

00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:05.520
 like newspapers or pamphlets, it was just a hate me.

00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:07.120
 So it was a reduced price.

00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:10.040
 But you had to send it an unsealed envelope,

00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:11.840
 and then the postman would open the envelope,

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:13.320
 check that you hadn't put anything

00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:14.880
 other than a newspaper in there,

00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:18.160
 and then seal the envelope up after that.

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:19.320
 And if you send a sealed envelope,

00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:20.560
 then you'd have to pay extra.

00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:22.680
 So there's the idea that there are still some people out there

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:24.680
 who think that maybe you'll only have to pay a hate me

00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:27.000
 if you leave the envelope unsealed.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.200
 But yeah, cheaper to not.

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:30.760
 - No, who is still paying a hate penny for their stamps?

00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:33.200
 Other than Piers Fletcher, producer of QI,

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:34.200
 who is doing that?

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:38.440
 - It's hard to say.

00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:41.960
 - On the kind of unexpected antiquity of things,

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:43.920
 you know the window envelope?

00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:47.320
 And that's the one where you've got a little plastic window

00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:48.440
 so you can double up.

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:49.920
 You don't need to write the address on the envelope

00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:51.640
 because it's part of the letter that you're being sent.

00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:53.400
 - You're not going to tell us they did that

00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:55.120
 with Cuneiform Tablets, are you?

00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:56.040
 - No.

00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:57.920
 When do you think that was invented?

00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:00.600
 - Well, I would say in the '50s.

00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:02.040
 - Thanks, James. Good guess.

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:03.280
 - The '90s.

00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:04.320
 - '90s? Brilliant.

00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:06.760
 Even better guess, for my purposes, Anna.

00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:10.160
 - I think I've got window envelopes at my house

00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:11.880
 from before the '90s.

00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:15.280
 I feel like I'd be cheated because I also researched this.

00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:16.120
 - Okay, okay.

00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:18.840
 Well, hey, Anna, who was writing window envelopes to you

00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:21.240
 when you were two years old and you were needed?

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:24.120
 - I was a very professional toddler.

00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:27.920
 - They were designed, first designed in 1901

00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:29.440
 and patented in 1902.

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:31.160
 They're older than powered flight,

00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:33.000
 which I find very weird.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.080
 - You find it impressive that we had the technology

00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:37.520
 that windowed envelopes before powered flight.

00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:38.720
 - I've got to say, Andy,

00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:39.840
 do you think the Wright brothers,

00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:42.920
 when they first flew at Kitty Hawk,

00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:45.240
 everyone went, "Yeah, but it's not a windowed envelope."

00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:46.560
 Who is it?

00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:48.200
 Come on, mate.

00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:50.400
 There is a guy in Sweden who's scared of them.

00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:53.200
 He has a phobia of window envelopes.

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:54.040
 - Really?

00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:56.720
 - Yeah, he was in court a few years ago.

00:29:56.720 --> 00:30:00.800
 Basically, he'd been driving his scooter unregistered

00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:02.240
 and without a license.

00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:04.480
 And so they sent him letters saying,

00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:06.360
 "You need to pay a fine, old ever."

00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:09.680
 But he says he had a phobia of window envelopes.

00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:12.000
 And so he never opened any of them.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.920
 And the court partially ruled in his favor,

00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:17.000
 saying he didn't know what was inside them.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.800
 And he just didn't like these official things.

00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:21.360
 He thought it might be something really bad.

00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:23.200
 - He did get all the money together for the fine,

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:26.440
 but then this massive pig came into the room.

00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:27.760
 - Hey, all the money.

00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:29.960
 (laughing)

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:31.120
 - So speaking of eating,

00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:33.080
 you used to be able to eat the windowed envelopes,

00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:33.920
 didn't you?

00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:34.760
 - What?

00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:38.360
 - First, in the original 1902 patent,

00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:40.760
 just the window bit was made of rice paper.

00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:42.280
 - Yeah, don't eat the whole envelope.

00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:44.160
 - Don't eat the whole envelope, absolutely not.

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:45.640
 But that would solve a lot of problems today

00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:46.840
 'cause they really irritate me

00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:48.560
 'cause they're not recyclable, aren't they?

00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:49.400
 'Cause you can't recycle.

00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:50.960
 - No, they are recyclable.

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:53.800
 No, this is one of the big, modern myths of society.

00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:55.160
 - It's the biggest. - Oh, God.

00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:56.800
 (laughing)

00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:57.840
 - Anna, what have you done?

00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:00.480
 You've destroyed literally millions of windowed envelopes.

00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:02.520
 - I know because you've been getting these envelopes

00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:03.880
 since you were two years old.

00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:05.520
 (laughing)

00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:06.360
 - They are recyclable.

00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:07.520
 - I always ate the window.

00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:09.560
 (laughing)

00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:12.040
 - Rice paper is not see-through, I don't think.

00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:14.840
 It's almost see-through, but it's not really see-through.

00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:16.280
 - So I think they weren't as good probably

00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:17.640
 in the other days, the original patent.

00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:20.280
 It was quite translucent rather than transparent.

00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:22.800
 - Also, if it gets wet, it just disintegrates.

00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:24.800
 - Another flaw.

00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:27.520
 (laughing)

00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:28.800
 - Well, then you can see the address better.

00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:30.360
 So that's actually quite useful.

00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:31.200
 (laughing)

00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:32.640
 - Do you know you used to be able to buy stamps

00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:33.840
 from post boxes?

00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:34.680
 - Wow.

00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:35.520
 - This is another era

00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:37.840
 that producer of QI Pierce Fletcher might remember.

00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:42.440
 This was in the 1930s and again, quite a short live.

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:44.440
 - He does actually listen to these podcasts.

00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:45.280
 Can I just say?

00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:47.000
 - I know he does.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.000
 - He's going to be so excited.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.840
 James is going to talk about my Babylonian cuneiform.

00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:51.880
 Come round, family.

00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:53.360
 Come round.

00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:54.200
 Everyone sit down.

00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:55.280
 - Come round, grandchildren.

00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:56.200
 Great, grandchildren.

00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:57.360
 Great, great, grandchildren.

00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:59.440
 Great, great, great grandchildren.

00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:01.880
 (laughing)

00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:04.360
 Well, as you'll remember in the 1930s,

00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:06.280
 post boxes were stamp vending machines.

00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:09.080
 And if they had the word stamp engraved on them,

00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:10.480
 you could put a penny in

00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:13.880
 and you automatically got two stamps out of it.

00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:15.280
 But they actually were abolished

00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:16.800
 because they kept on just eating people's pennies

00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:18.960
 and not dispensing the stamps.

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:20.320
 Nice idea though.

00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:21.640
 - Very nice. - Very cool idea.

00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:25.120
 Can I tell you my favorite envelope story from 2020?

00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:25.960
 - Yep. - Of course.

00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:26.960
 - We've all got one.

00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:29.680
 - Yep, so this was in Ohio.

00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:33.800
 A man called Dan Kane went to the post office

00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:35.720
 to pick up a letter he was expecting

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:38.960
 from the College Avenue student loan company.

00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:40.520
 His daughter's tuition fee,

00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:42.880
 it was a loan repayment scheme that he was doing.

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:45.160
 So he went to pick up the letter

00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:46.400
 and when he got there,

00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:49.000
 he was told that there wasn't one letter for him.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.280
 But due to an administrative error,

00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:54.240
 the college had sent him not one,

00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:57.720
 but 55,000 letters of the exact same letter.

00:32:57.720 --> 00:33:00.640
 - Wow.

00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:02.920
 - There were 79 bins of a mail

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:05.080
 that contained roughly 700 copies

00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:07.800
 of the exact same letter addressed to him

00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:10.160
 and he had to bring them home.

00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:11.520
 He had to take them home with him.

00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:12.720
 - No. - Yeah.

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:14.920
 And when he got home, he opened it up

00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:17.320
 to actually get the amount

00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:19.000
 'cause he needed to pay back this loan

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.480
 and worked out that the company had accidentally

00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:22.720
 used the wrong interest rate

00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:24.320
 and they calculated the payment wrong.

00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:26.240
 So they were gonna have to send him another letter

00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:28.280
 with the right amount.

00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:29.640
 - That's amazing.

00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:31.960
 - Yeah, and he worked out that roughly,

00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:33.120
 it would have cost them about,

00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:34.080
 or if someone worked out,

00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:36.600
 it would have cost them 11,000 American dollars

00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:39.520
 to have posted that mail. - Although,

00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:40.880
 imagine how much worse that would have been

00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:42.200
 in the days of play envelope.

00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:45.920
 - Do you wanna know what my favorite story

00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:47.920
 from 2015 about envelopes is?

00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:49.240
 - Yes. - Oh yeah, we all got one.

00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:51.960
 - I sort of rather have your 2020 one if I'm okay.

00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:54.040
 - I'm afraid I don't have one.

00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:57.520
 In 2015, there was a guy in Gloucestershire

00:33:57.520 --> 00:34:00.240
 who got a Christmas card that just said,

00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:02.040
 "England on the envelope."

00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:05.280
 He was walking down the road

00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:07.520
 and the postman said to him,

00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:09.240
 "I don't suppose you're expecting anything

00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:10.600
 "from Germany, are you?"

00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:13.400
 And he said, "Well, I've got a few friends in Germany."

00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:14.920
 And he said, "Well, do you wanna have a look at this?

00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:16.080
 "It just says England on it."

00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:17.320
 And he looked and on the back,

00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:19.760
 it was the address of his friends in Germany

00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:21.560
 and he opened it up and it was a Christmas card

00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:23.200
 from his friends in Germany.

00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:24.280
 - What? - Wow.

00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:26.080
 - And he said, "How did you know it was for me?"

00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:28.800
 And the postman said, "Oh, I was just wandering around

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:30.480
 "and I've just been asking people."

00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:33.920
 - I've tried to be asking millions of people.

00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:36.600
 - It was from Christmas 1993

00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:39.000
 and he'd finally made it to that town.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:40.560
 - Wasn't that amazing?

00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:42.240
 And what they reckon is, - That is insane.

00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:43.840
 - This is what they reckon happened.

00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:46.560
 Probably it used to have the correct address on

00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:47.760
 and then it said England at the bottom,

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:50.360
 but maybe it was on a label and the label peeled off.

00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:51.920
 So it got to the right area.

00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:53.960
 It got to the right post office,

00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:56.880
 but it hadn't gotten the actual final address on it.

00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:58.240
 And so this postman goes,

00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:00.560
 "Well, I might as well just try everyone that I see

00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:02.200
 "and just ask just in case."

00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:04.160
 And he managed to find the right person.

00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:06.040
 - I'm just sort of imagining a guy

00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:08.560
 with a beard down to the floor in a ragged clothes

00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:10.840
 who lost his job 25 years ago,

00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:13.080
 just stumbling down the road.

00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:14.440
 Is it you?

00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:15.680
 I found him.

00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:18.960
 - He eventually opens it when he's desperate,

00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:20.280
 works out it's for him.

00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:22.520
 (laughing)

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:28.080
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show

00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:30.080
 and that is James.

00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:32.600
 - My fact this week is that in 1939,

00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:37.000
 America made a huge vehicle to drive across Antarctica.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.440
 Unfortunately, they put no tread on the tires

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:41.640
 so it couldn't drive on ice.

00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:43.680
 - Amazing. - This is so cool.

00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:46.200
 It's a thing called a snow cruiser.

00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:49.760
 And they knew that they wanted to drive across Antarctica

00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:50.800
 and they knew that they would need

00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:52.800
 something absolutely massive to do so

00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:54.840
 'cause they wanted to drive it out somewhere

00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:57.360
 and then do a load of experiments when they were in there.

00:35:57.360 --> 00:36:00.160
 And so they invented this enormous machine.

00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:02.240
 It was in the middle of America where they invented,

00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:04.720
 I think somewhere near Boston.

00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:07.280
 And they had to get it from Boston to the boat

00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:08.840
 and then from the boat to Antarctica

00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:10.520
 and then from the Antarctic boat

00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:13.040
 to the middle of Antarctica to do these things.

00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:15.960
 And they got it all the way to the Antarctic

00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:19.120
 and they realized that the wheels were just spinning round

00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:20.760
 whenever they tried to go anywhere.

00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:23.720
 They added some chains to it to try and get a bit of grip

00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:25.200
 and that was slightly better.

00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:27.680
 But they found out that the only way they could get anywhere

00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:30.280
 was to drive the whole thing in reverse.

00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:33.760
 And so they drove in reverse for 92 miles

00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:37.480
 to the middle of the Antarctic and they got there

00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:39.720
 and they could start doing some experiments

00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:41.240
 but they couldn't really get it back.

00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:43.000
 And so they ended up just leaving it there.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.600
 - So amazing. - Incredible.

00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:47.840
 - Which poor person had a horrendously cricked neck

00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:51.040
 after doing that journey? - So bad, isn't it?

00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:52.400
 - 92 miles. - And you can just drive,

00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:54.520
 anyway, I mean, you can just drive backwards, can't you?

00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:56.240
 You don't need to look around, it's Antarctica.

00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:57.400
 What are you going to bump into?

00:36:57.400 --> 00:36:59.120
 You're going to bump into penguins

00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:02.000
 or big lumps of ice or something, right?

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.320
 - It just sounds hilarious,

00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:05.680
 the process of getting it there in the first place, right?

00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:08.280
 There's this photo of transporting it

00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:09.920
 'cause I think it left from Boston

00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:11.200
 but it was made in Chicago,

00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:13.080
 maybe it was transported from Chicago.

00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:15.480
 And so to get to Boston, it had to drive

00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:16.960
 and it just drove along ordinary roads

00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:19.080
 and there was this huge pile up

00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:21.960
 'cause there's this giant 55 foot long,

00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:24.720
 it's wheels are twice, three times the height

00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:27.600
 of a normal car, just sitting in the middle of a motorway.

00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:30.280
 Well, the car's around it, like, what the hell is this thing?

00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:32.400
 - They stopped in a place called Framingham

00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:34.320
 in Massachusetts on the way

00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:36.240
 and they just stopped it in the middle of the road

00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:40.400
 and so there was a traffic jam of 70,000 cars behind it.

00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:41.480
 - Wow.

00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:45.520
 - It was cool, it had a plane on it,

00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:48.360
 it had a biplane on the roof for research.

00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:51.240
 So it needed to carry a thousand gallons of fuel,

00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:52.720
 just to fuel the plane.

00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:55.560
 And then it needed obviously thousands more gallons

00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:56.960
 of fuel all over it.

00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:58.560
 And it had to have two spare tyres

00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:00.320
 but the tyres were 10 feet tall.

00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:02.320
 So they were just in the back.

00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:05.960
 - Yeah, each tyre had to be transported by dog sled.

00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:08.680
 - There's a brilliant picture on the Atlantic website

00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:11.160
 of 14 dogs pulling a single tyre

00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:13.520
 that just shows how big it was that they had to do that.

00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:14.760
 - And they had to go backwards as well,

00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:16.880
 that was the really dead end of the dog.

00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:19.640
 (laughing)

00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:20.480
 - Yeah.

00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:22.280
 - And on that, in that article actually,

00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:24.480
 there is a photo of it abandoned

00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:27.240
 just after they decided, look, we're not gonna take it back.

00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:28.640
 And then there's a later photo

00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:30.920
 where it's kind of slightly buried by snow.

00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:32.520
 And then there's a final photo

00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:35.000
 where it's almost completely buried by snow.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:36.600
 And there's like a little hatch

00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:38.280
 where people can go in and out.

00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:41.560
 And then someone went back like in the '40s

00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:43.520
 to see if it was still there and they could find it.

00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:46.720
 And actually it was kind of, they could still use it really.

00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:48.680
 I mean, they couldn't really use it much in the first place

00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:50.440
 but it was still kind of working.

00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:54.040
 And they found it again in the '50s in 1958.

00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:56.600
 But now they literally don't know where it is.

00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:59.160
 And it's probably covered under some snow

00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:01.680
 or it might have drifted off on an iceberg or something

00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:03.640
 but we literally don't know where this thing is.

00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:05.080
 - Wow, it's amazing.

00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:07.120
 - Maybe some penguins have made it into a home.

00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:08.840
 - Oh, that would be nice, wouldn't it?

00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:10.160
 - So lovely. - Yeah.

00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:12.160
 There's one theory that the Soviets knew where it was

00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:14.520
 and they went back and stole it.

00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:16.200
 - Why? It's useless.

00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:19.960
 Guys, do you know the first motorized vehicle

00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:21.800
 in Antarctica as far as I know?

00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:23.760
 - No.

00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:25.240
 - It actually went with Shackleton.

00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:26.080
 - Oh, really?

00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:28.440
 - Yeah, so this was in his first Antarctica expedition

00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:30.800
 in 1907 and it was an Aral Johnston car

00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:33.240
 which were the makers of the first cars in Britain.

00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:35.760
 It was basically a big bit of PR for the car.

00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:39.400
 So quite inconvenient for the actual expedition.

00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:41.560
 It did have, it had skis and it had special oil

00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:44.720
 that didn't freeze and it had a silencer on the exhaust

00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:46.200
 that doubled as a foot warmer.

00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:49.080
 So it siphoned the warm air round to the front

00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:51.320
 to where your feet are. - That's clever.

00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:53.320
 - But they took it with them

00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:54.760
 and so they had to bring it on the boat.

00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:57.160
 They had to unload some of their crucial supplies

00:39:57.160 --> 00:40:00.520
 and equipment from the boat to make room for this car.

00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:01.400
 They brought it with them.

00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:04.000
 They got it off the boat, put it on the snow

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.840
 and much like James' vehicle he mentioned

00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:08.000
 they started spinning the wheels

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.000
 and they just went deeper and deeper into the snow.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:13.640
 They thought, okay, we'll, we'll target with this for a bit.

00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:15.080
 Maybe we'll get it working.

00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:17.920
 They lasted two miles of pulling it along with them

00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:19.760
 before Shackleton's crew went,

00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:22.040
 can we just leave this chat behind please?

00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:24.800
 They abandoned it in the snow.

00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:26.920
 But yeah, first car in the Antarctic.

00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:28.840
 - There was a car in the Antarctic

00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:31.760
 from a Shackleton very recently.

00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:36.760
 It was Patrick Bergl who was Shackleton's great-grandson.

00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:38.640
 You guys must have read about this.

00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:41.400
 It was a modified Hyundai Santa Fe

00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:44.800
 but he actually did manage to get it working, right?

00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:47.520
 So they said that the only modification was

00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:50.760
 that they made the tires really, really big

00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:53.200
 and really, really loads of air inside.

00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:55.040
 So it's as much as you could like,

00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:57.240
 it could roll over your foot and you wouldn't feel it.

00:40:57.240 --> 00:40:59.760
 That's how much air was in the tires.

00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:01.440
 And that meant that it would never sink

00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:02.280
 into the ground.

00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:05.240
 And I imagine they had a lot of tread on there as well.

00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:07.720
 And they said that basically this is exactly like

00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:10.600
 a normal Hyundai Santa Fe apart from these tires.

00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:11.440
 But then they did say,

00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:13.080
 oh, there is one other modification

00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:14.880
 that it runs on jet fuel.

00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:19.600
 But the reason is 'cause jet fuel doesn't freeze

00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:22.120
 quite as easily as normal fuel.

00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:22.960
 - Ah-ha.

00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:26.240
 But with that in that kind of atmosphere,

00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:29.120
 lessen its punch when you put down the accelerator?

00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:33.440
 - Yeah, they went on the average about 25 miles an hour,

00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:35.280
 I think, all the time. - Oh, okay, wow.

00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:36.760
 - Well, that must have taken ages.

00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:38.160
 'Cause they went, did they go all the way across?

00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:42.360
 - They went 5,800 kilometres across.

00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:43.960
 Whether they went to the very end,

00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:46.120
 I think they might have gone to the middle and back.

00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:46.960
 - I bet that was dull.

00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:48.880
 I bet it was exciting for the first couple of hours.

00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:50.720
 And then old Shappenton's great grandson thought,

00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:52.480
 what was my grandad thinking?

00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:55.600
 - Didn't he work in, he's a marketing executive this guy.

00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:56.440
 - Yeah.

00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:57.280
 - He's not a ponder explorer.

00:41:57.280 --> 00:41:58.120
 - No.

00:41:58.120 --> 00:41:58.960
 - No.

00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:01.520
 - He just had to sit in a passenger seat of a car

00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:02.880
 to be there for a few weeks.

00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:05.480
 - They've basically gone, we have a car which can do this.

00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:06.720
 Anyone can do it really.

00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:08.120
 Who can we get to do it?

00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:11.040
 Does any of them have any relatives left,

00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:13.680
 the people who went in the first place?

00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:15.080
 But they did have one thing, sorry,

00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:16.840
 just on this really quickly.

00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:18.840
 They did have one thing where they had a number

00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:20.040
 of these vehicles going across

00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:21.560
 and they had to be roped together.

00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:23.440
 Because like you said, there can be crevasses.

00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:25.560
 And apparently one of them did fall into a crevasse,

00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:27.960
 but luckily it was kind of roped to all the other cars

00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:29.120
 so they could pull it out.

00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:31.320
 So it was kind of dangerous I think.

00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:33.160
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely.

00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:35.360
 - That's very self-sacrificing of the other cars.

00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:36.720
 'Cause it could happen the other way, right?

00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:37.680
 If the cross is big enough

00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:39.880
 and you're in the front car and you've made it over

00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:43.520
 and then you're dragged back in by the tailgaters.

00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:44.520
 - What, come on Anna.

00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:46.400
 I mean, you're a team going across.

00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:50.080
 I'm tactic, you're like like, fuck it, I'm in the front car.

00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:51.640
 The rest of them could do what they want.

00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:54.400
 - I think we've learned in the "Touching the Void" episode

00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:57.000
 of "No such thing as a fish", he was cutting the rope.

00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:58.520
 - Yeah.

00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:00.240
 - Yeah, I don't have the right attitude

00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:01.680
 for polar expeditions.

00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:05.640
 - This fact is about driving backwards.

00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:07.640
 I found the guy who's driven backwards

00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:10.560
 for the longest time, okay.

00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:13.920
 There is a taxi driver in India called Harpreet Dev

00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:16.520
 who has driven everywhere backwards

00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:18.800
 for about a decade now.

00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:19.640
 He's a-

00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:21.480
 - Does this mean that at the end,

00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:24.600
 on your meter, on your taxi,

00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:27.320
 he ends up having to give you money at the end?

00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:32.000
 - So he's been issued with a special government license

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.760
 to drive anywhere in reverse in his home state.

00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:37.960
 And he has a big old siren on his cab to warn people,

00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:39.920
 but it's so surreal seeing footage of him

00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:41.360
 just driving around backwards all the time.

00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:44.040
 He's reversed the gearbox, so he's got, you know,

00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:46.600
 five gears in reverse and one forward.

00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:48.520
 And he says that the only disadvantage

00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:50.160
 to this great career he's got

00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:52.040
 is that he gets frequent pains in the neck,

00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:53.440
 extremely bad back problems,

00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:56.080
 and suffers what he calls severe vomiting.

00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:58.160
 - Oh man.

00:43:58.160 --> 00:43:59.000
 - I know.

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:01.320
 - The worst thing about that with the severe vomiting

00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:04.640
 is he's facing in the direction of his passengers, isn't he?

00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:08.680
 - You'd pull the glass window.

00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:13.800
 - I definitely must have missed the detail there.

00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:15.520
 Why is he driving backwards, sorry?

00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:16.360
 - No, you didn't miss it.

00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:19.000
 - No, you didn't, you did not miss the detail.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.480
 He thought it would be fun and he thought it would be a fun gimmick.

00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:24.920
 - And then despite the dangers of it,

00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:27.960
 the government of the area also thought that was a great idea

00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:29.760
 and gave him license.

00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:30.840
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:34.680
 I think if one person is doing something extremely weird

00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:37.640
 and dangerous, but everyone else knows he's doing it at least,

00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:41.880
 then everyone else can mitigate their actions to help him, right?

00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:43.760
 - It's written on the side of the cab

00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:45.800
 that this is a backwards taxi.

00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:48.000
 - I think you can see that when he's coming towards you.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:52.200
 - Yeah, he did try to drive backwards to Pakistan to promote peace,

00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:54.280
 but he did not have the permission to cross the border,

00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:56.000
 so he was sent home again.

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:56.840
 - Right.

00:44:56.840 --> 00:45:04.440
 - We were talking about people going across Antarctic a few seconds ago.

00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:07.240
 The first person to walk solo across Antarctica

00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:10.800
 only brought one pair of underwear for the entire 38-day trip,

00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:13.720
 and unfortunately, he shit himself on day 16.

00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:17.280
 - I'm impressed he held it in that long.

00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:20.960
 - Day 14 of Antarctic journey, going great so far.

00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:24.600
 Day 15, still absolutely not regretting my underpanned decision.

00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:25.600
 Day 16.

00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:26.920
 Oh, no.

00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:30.680
 - The thing is, before he set off,

00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:32.800
 he did an interview with Business Insider,

00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:35.760
 and he said that he was only bringing one pair of underwear,

00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:38.920
 and he was going to use the weight that he could take.

00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:40.480
 He was going to use it for food,

00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:43.640
 so he's like, "I don't need the underwear, I just need food,"

00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:48.200
 which kind of makes sense without the idea of retrospect,

00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:49.800
 of realising that it didn't.

00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:52.120
 And what happened was, it was the food that was a problem,

00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:54.960
 obviously, it is always the food that's a problem in that situation,

00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:58.120
 but he- - He shouldn't have taken Vindaloo for every moment.

00:45:58.120 --> 00:46:05.160
 - He took these things, he was called Colin O'Brady,

00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:09.680
 and he took these 1,180-calorie Colin bars

00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:11.920
 that had been made especially for him,

00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:15.000
 and so they had loads of protein, loads of good stuff in them,

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.800
 and he was just going to eat these bars all the way across.

00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:20.880
 But one morning, he just got the munchies,

00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:23.760
 and he just started eating all of these Colin bars.

00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:28.440
 They could take coconut oil, nuts, dried cranberries, cocoa powder,

00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:31.400
 and he decided to eat just loads and loads of them,

00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:35.440
 and he had about 2,000 calories worth in one go,

00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:38.600
 which is about the equivalent of eight Big Macs.

00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:42.160
 And then the next morning, well, you all know what happened.

00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:43.760
 - Wow. - It's not exhibiting

00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:45.520
 the kind of self-control you expect,

00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:49.240
 but he, O'Colin, is a very controversial figure

00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:52.440
 in Antarctic Lloyds, certainly is, yeah.

00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:56.600
 Because, so he claims to be the first person

00:46:56.600 --> 00:47:01.240
 to have crossed the Antarctic, fully unassisted and unsupported,

00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:05.160
 so that originally went to this Norwegian guy called Borge Auslan,

00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:06.920
 and that was in the '90s, I think,

00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:11.000
 but then they changed the definition to say that unsupported

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:12.760
 had to mean without even a kite.

00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:15.320
 So Borge had used a kite on two occasions,

00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:18.040
 very, very briefly, to get himself sort of out of Snowdrift.

00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:19.560
 Can we just explain how that works,

00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:21.960
 because it sounds like he's just having a bit of fun with a kite.

00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:23.160
 Sounds really fun.

00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:26.440
 Was he allowed to take his yo-yo with him, though?

00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:30.840
 Sorry, it's for transport.

00:47:30.840 --> 00:47:33.640
 It's not like you stop, you fancy a hobby.

00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:35.880
 So I guess you're on your sled or whatever,

00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:38.360
 and you harness the wind that's going in the right direction

00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:39.720
 to pull you along with your kite,

00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:42.040
 or to help you to give you a bit of extra oomph.

00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:44.440
 And he travelled a lot further to do his trip

00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:46.280
 than O'Brady, who's just done his.

00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:49.240
 And a lot of people see Borge

00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:51.240
 as the person who really achieved this.

00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:53.880
 And O'Brady's quite a self-promoter,

00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:57.720
 and he's written this book where he says everyone said it couldn't be done,

00:47:57.720 --> 00:48:01.000
 and National Geographics interviewed everyone who advised him.

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:03.000
 They were all like, "No, we told him it's pretty simple,

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:04.040
 yeah, pretty straightforward."

00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:06.040
 And it was like, "There were times I was told

00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:07.720
 they wouldn't be able to rescue me."

00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:10.120
 And then someone's done an interview saying,

00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:11.880
 "Getting rescued in the Antarctic is kind of like

00:48:11.880 --> 00:48:13.400
 ordering an Uber these days.

00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:16.600
 You just call someone up and you can't get you out of there."

00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:19.400
 It's very hard to see on the Uber map, though,

00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:21.320
 because against a featureless white background,

00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:23.720
 he could be two minutes away, he could be three days.

00:48:23.720 --> 00:48:26.520
 Fortunately, there's a huge shit stain in the snow next to him.

00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:28.120
 He cleaned his pants.

00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:33.480
 You were saying about you could use the wind with these kites.

00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:36.920
 Do you know how you can tell which way the wind is going in Antarctica?

00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:37.880
 No.

00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:39.720
 Well, there's a few ways.

00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:42.440
 You can just lick your finger and hold it up.

00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:44.440
 But not if you want to keep the finger.

00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:45.800
 That's true, yeah.

00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:50.200
 One almost foolproof way is to look at which way the penguins are pointing.

00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:53.880
 So if there is a storm coming in Antarctic,

00:48:53.880 --> 00:48:56.200
 the penguins will drop to their bellies,

00:48:56.200 --> 00:48:59.640
 and they will point their beaks in the direction that the wind's going to come,

00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:01.160
 because they know there's a storm coming,

00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:02.520
 and they don't want to get blown over.

00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:07.320
 I was reading this, this was an Antarctic scientist called Lizzie Meek,

00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:08.920
 who was writing about this.

00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:09.880
 But isn't that cool?

00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:12.360
 You could just see which way the little penguins are pointing.

00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:12.920
 That was really funny.

00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:13.400
 That's great.

00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:16.280
 Do you know who the first person, possibly,

00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:20.040
 to set foot on the Antarctic continent might have been?

00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:21.720
 Was it QI producer Piers Fletcher?

00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:28.920
 This is so random, but I just came across this in my notes I found ages ago.

00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:31.240
 There was this amazing discovery in the 1980s,

00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:33.400
 where some bones were found in Antarctica.

00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:36.920
 And until then, we thought that the very first Antarctic landing

00:49:36.920 --> 00:49:39.800
 was a sealing expedition in 1820.

00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:41.800
 And they found these bones,

00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:46.440
 and they've dated them to somewhere between 1815 and 1825.

00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:51.560
 And they are the bones of a 21-year-old Indigenous Chilean woman,

00:49:51.560 --> 00:49:53.800
 which is just extraordinary,

00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:57.240
 because no one had gone near the continent we didn't think until then.

00:49:57.240 --> 00:49:59.640
 And suddenly, there's this young Chilean woman there.

00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:02.760
 No one knows where on earth she's come from or how she got there.

00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:06.920
 There's a suggestion that maybe the sealers who were European sealers

00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:09.240
 had found someone from Chile who would know

00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:11.800
 more on how to survive in that kind of environment

00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:13.560
 and taken her with them, then left her.

00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:14.840
 But we just have no idea.

00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:18.200
 So I just find that incredible, mystery.

00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:18.920
 Yeah.

00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:21.000
 I found a page on Wikipedia,

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:23.960
 which is the list of crimes in Antarctica.

00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:26.520
 Because, as we were saying before,

00:50:26.520 --> 00:50:27.720
 there's all these sort of, you know,

00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:29.240
 to the point where you can order an Uber

00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:29.960
 to get rescued.

00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:33.240
 It's all these research stations that are planted.

00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:36.120
 I don't think you can order an Uber to get rescued.

00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:36.360
 Yeah.

00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:39.400
 Well, it'll arrive backwards, that's the thing.

00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:43.720
 Sorry, what I meant is it's the point of you could almost,

00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:46.840
 in theory, it's sort of got that sort of dense with places.

00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:51.240
 And yeah, so there's all these, you know,

00:50:51.240 --> 00:50:53.800
 research units where scientists are hauled up for ages.

00:50:53.800 --> 00:50:56.280
 And as a result, there's a big list of the crimes

00:50:56.280 --> 00:50:57.960
 that they've committed, which is always really hard,

00:50:57.960 --> 00:50:59.320
 because they're isolated for so long.

00:50:59.320 --> 00:51:03.160
 But the first crime on the list was from 1959.

00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:06.760
 And it was in a Soviet research station.

00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:08.360
 And it was between two scientists

00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:11.000
 who got into a massive argument,

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:13.160
 then fight over a game of chess.

00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:18.920
 And it just got so heated that the guy who lost,

00:51:18.920 --> 00:51:22.200
 became enraged, was said to have picked up an ice axe

00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:23.800
 and attacked the guy.

00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:25.720
 And it's really hard to tell, actually,

00:51:25.720 --> 00:51:27.880
 whether or not the wound was fatal,

00:51:27.880 --> 00:51:29.160
 because there's two different stories

00:51:29.160 --> 00:51:31.240
 that have been presented as a result.

00:51:31.240 --> 00:51:33.960
 Some say he survived, some say he didn't.

00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:36.920
 But afterwards, chess games were apparently banned

00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:39.000
 on all Soviets and Russian and tariff stations.

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:41.640
 That really feels like not the main issue here.

00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:46.040
 Keep hold of your axes.

00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:48.760
 Only for weapons and courage, chess, no.

00:51:48.760 --> 00:51:51.400
 No, but I just like that.

00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:53.080
 I like the little communities that are out there

00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:54.360
 that you rarely hear about.

00:51:54.360 --> 00:51:56.200
 In 2014, there was a scientist

00:51:56.200 --> 00:51:59.640
 who decided to launch his Tinder app while he was out there,

00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:02.120
 and he matched with someone on Antarctica.

00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:05.480
 Yeah, unfortunately, there were a helicopter ride away,

00:52:05.480 --> 00:52:07.320
 45 minutes, and they were leaving the next day.

00:52:07.320 --> 00:52:08.360
 And they just got an Uber.

00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:16.520
 OK, that's it.

00:52:16.520 --> 00:52:17.560
 That is all of our facts.

00:52:17.560 --> 00:52:19.000
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:20.680

 which is @NoSuchThing or our website.

00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:39.480
 NoSuchThing is a fish.com.

00:52:39.480 --> 00:52:41.640
 It's got links to merch that we've released.

00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:43.800
 It has all of our previous episodes.

00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:44.600
 Check it out.

00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:46.440
 Anyway, as ever, we hope you're all well.

00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:47.480
 We hope you're all safe.

00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:49.320
 And thank you for continuing to listen to us

00:52:49.320 --> 00:52:50.200
 in these crazy times.

00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:52.600
 We will be back again next week with another episode.

00:52:52.600 --> 00:52:53.560
 We'll see you then.

00:52:53.560 --> 00:52:54.280
 Goodbye.

00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:56.940
 (upbeat music)

00:52:56.940 --> 00:52:59.520
 (upbeat music)

00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:02.100
 (upbeat music)

00:53:02.100 --> 00:53:04.160
 you
