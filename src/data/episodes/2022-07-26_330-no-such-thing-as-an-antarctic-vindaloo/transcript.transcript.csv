00:00:02,00:00:17,"- Hello, and welcome to another episode"
00:00:17,00:00:20,"of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you"
00:00:20,00:00:23,from four undisclosed locations in the UK.
00:00:23,00:00:25,"My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here"
00:00:25,00:00:29,"with James Harkin, Anna Tijinski, and Andrew Hunter Murray,"
00:00:29,00:00:31,"and once again, we have gathered round the microphones"
00:00:31,00:00:34,"with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,"
00:00:34,00:00:37,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:37,00:00:39,"Starting with you, Anna."
00:00:39,00:00:43,- My fact this week is that golden moulds shine
00:00:43,00:00:47,"in all the colors of the rainbow, and they'll never know it."
00:00:47,00:00:49,"- Oh, that's sad. - Wow."
00:00:49,00:00:51,- It's what a tragic fact to open with.
00:00:51,00:00:53,- Is it because they're stupid?
00:00:53,00:00:55,They don't even know their moulds.
00:00:55,00:00:58,Is this the reason I said?
00:00:58,00:00:59,- They don't know their moulds.
00:00:59,00:01:00,They don't have a concept of color.
00:01:00,00:01:02,They don't know what a rainbow is.
00:01:02,00:01:04,"There's a lot of reasons why, but..."
00:01:04,00:01:06,- It made me wonder if there were things
00:01:06,00:01:08,"that we don't know about, you know what I mean?"
00:01:08,00:01:12,"It's like, and we're not smart enough to know what they are."
00:01:12,00:01:15,So it could be that there are amazing colors
00:01:15,00:01:19,"that no one knows what they are that we give off, or smells."
00:01:19,00:01:22,"- Yeah, so dogs are doing a podcast saying,"
00:01:22,00:01:26,"did you know humans smell exactly like, I don't know,"
00:01:26,00:01:28,"rotting mushrooms, and they'll never know it."
00:01:28,00:01:30,(laughing)
00:01:30,00:01:32,"- They've got the word dickhead written on their forehead,"
00:01:32,00:01:33,and they have no idea.
00:01:33,00:01:35,(laughing)
00:01:35,00:01:38,"- Anyway, so back to the old moulds."
00:01:38,00:01:41,I read about them in this fantastic article
00:01:41,00:01:42,in the London Review of Books.
00:01:42,00:01:45,"It's by Catherine Rondle, and this is about the golden mould,"
00:01:45,00:01:48,and it's the first known iridescent mammal.
00:01:48,00:01:51,"So iridescent means it shimmers, like, you know,"
00:01:51,00:01:53,"when you spill petrol, or in soap bubbles,"
00:01:53,00:01:55,or a pigeon's neck.
00:01:55,00:01:56,"So they have this amazing fur,"
00:01:56,00:01:58,"which is a very specific structure,"
00:01:58,00:02:00,which reflects and reflects light
00:02:00,00:02:03,"in a way that causes this rainbow effect to happen,"
00:02:03,00:02:05,but they are totally blind.
00:02:05,00:02:08,"So usually iridescence in nature is for attracting mates,"
00:02:08,00:02:11,or maybe warning off a predator to suggest
00:02:11,00:02:12,that you're poisonous.
00:02:12,00:02:15,But this serves absolutely no purpose whatsoever.
00:02:15,00:02:16,They're underground almost the whole time.
00:02:16,00:02:19,"They do have eyeballs, weirdly."
00:02:19,00:02:21,We think the optic nerve isn't really functioning anymore.
00:02:21,00:02:23,"They have eyeballs, but their eyeballs"
00:02:23,00:02:27,"are covered with skin and fur, so aren't doing that much good."
00:02:27,00:02:29,"So yeah, they'll never know."
00:02:29,00:02:33,"And we think that it's possibly to repel water,"
00:02:33,00:02:34,"this particular sheen,"
00:02:34,00:02:37,or it could be to help them skid through holes
00:02:37,00:02:38,when they're digging holes in the sand.
00:02:38,00:02:39,"They can go really quickly,"
00:02:39,00:02:43,because they have these amazing scale-like things on them.
00:02:43,00:02:46,"But the colour is just a byproduct of that, right?"
00:02:46,00:02:49,"Yeah, it's one of those accidental bits of evolution,"
00:02:49,00:02:51,"which is surprisingly rare, exactly,"
00:02:51,00:02:53,so that they've evolved to have this very specific structure
00:02:53,00:02:54,to make them slippery.
00:02:54,00:02:57,"And it happens, so that's all rainbow as well."
00:02:57,00:03:00,"So they live in the deserts of southern Africa,"
00:03:00,00:03:01,and I've seen videos of them
00:03:01,00:03:03,and how they travel through the sand.
00:03:03,00:03:06,"But what's really funny is, when you're watching the videos,"
00:03:06,00:03:10,"is they swim through the sand very close to the surface,"
00:03:10,00:03:12,so you know where they're going.
00:03:12,00:03:14,It's like someone trying to escape jail
00:03:14,00:03:17,"by digging a tunnel under the outside,"
00:03:17,00:03:19,but doing it right at the surface.
00:03:19,00:03:21,So you always know where they are.
00:03:21,00:03:23,"But they're really cool the way they hunt,"
00:03:23,00:03:25,"because I think we may have seen the same thing, Dan."
00:03:25,00:03:27,"They come out of the ground,"
00:03:27,00:03:28,"and then they hunt, because they're blind,"
00:03:28,00:03:31,"they hunt by listening to the animals passing nearby,"
00:03:31,00:03:34,and they're mostly eating little insects and things.
00:03:34,00:03:36,"And the thing is, they can hear a lot better through sand"
00:03:36,00:03:37,"than they can through air,"
00:03:37,00:03:41,so they'll just completely plunge their head into a pile of sand
00:03:41,00:03:43,"just to check where their prey is,"
00:03:43,00:03:45,and then they'll get a hear of its footsteps
00:03:45,00:03:47,and then they'll move that way.
00:03:47,00:03:48,It's really funny.
00:03:48,00:03:50,"They have, in your ear you have three little bones,"
00:03:50,00:03:53,"you might remember, like the hammer, the anvil, and the stirrup,"
00:03:53,00:03:56,and their hammer is massive.
00:03:56,00:03:58,It's like Thor's hammer inside their head.
00:03:58,00:04:02,"It's 10,000 times bigger than our hammer in our head."
00:04:02,00:04:04,And the way that this helps them
00:04:04,00:04:07,"is when there are vibrations that come into their head,"
00:04:07,00:04:11,"it resonates and it makes the sound way, way louder,"
00:04:11,00:04:13,which means they can hear specific frequencies
00:04:13,00:04:14,"really, really well."
00:04:14,00:04:16,"And so they can hear the frequency,"
00:04:16,00:04:20,"which is about the same as wind rustling through grass,"
00:04:20,00:04:23,"and they can hear that specific frequency really, really well."
00:04:23,00:04:24,"So when they're going around,"
00:04:24,00:04:26,"they can just listen to where these tufts of grass are,"
00:04:26,00:04:27,and why is that useful?
00:04:27,00:04:29,Because that's where the insects live.
00:04:29,00:04:32,"So they just hear this specific sound of wind going through grass,"
00:04:32,00:04:34,"they know exactly where it is,"
00:04:34,00:04:36,and they head straight for it and they get their termites.
00:04:36,00:04:37,It's so clever.
00:04:37,00:04:41,Not so useful in the deserts of Southern Africa.
00:04:41,00:04:42,What do you mean?
00:04:42,00:04:44,"Well, it's sandy."
00:04:44,00:04:48,"Yes, but they have little tufts of grass in the desert, right?"
00:04:48,00:04:51,"And in those tufts of grass, that's where the termites live."
00:04:51,00:04:53,"The termites don't live in the sand,"
00:04:53,00:04:55,they live underneath the grass where there's a little bit of soil.
00:04:55,00:04:57,So that's exactly where they need to get to.
00:04:57,00:04:59,"There aren't many of them around, you're right, but..."
00:04:59,00:05:02,It would be pretty silly for them to evolve this incredible ability
00:05:02,00:05:05,"in a bone 10,000 times the size of ours,"
00:05:05,00:05:07,if they lived in a completely featureless environment.
00:05:07,00:05:10,It would be stupid if they evolved
00:05:10,00:05:13,"so they could only hear ice cream vans, for instance."
00:05:13,00:05:15,"Because you don't get many ice cream vans there,"
00:05:15,00:05:17,but you do get tufts of grass.
00:05:17,00:05:20,"Yeah. God, I bet they'd kill for an ice cream van, though."
00:05:20,00:05:23,That's true. There's one part of their body that's a lot smaller
00:05:23,00:05:27,"than the bone in their middle ear, which is massive."
00:05:27,00:05:28,It's their penis.
00:05:28,00:05:30,"Oh, here we go."
00:05:30,00:05:33,"So this is the disadvantage of being a golden mole,"
00:05:33,00:05:36,and it's very important to them.
00:05:36,00:05:39,"So there is a hot and hot golden mole,"
00:05:39,00:05:41,"that's one of the species' names,"
00:05:41,00:05:44,and females prefer males with bigger penises.
00:05:44,00:05:46,And the reason for that is that they have no other means
00:05:46,00:05:47,of differentiating between males.
00:05:47,00:05:49,"They're all underground, they're all blind,"
00:05:49,00:05:52,"there's no way of telling who's an appropriate mate or not,"
00:05:52,00:05:54,apart from penis size.
00:05:54,00:05:57,And the whole penis is approximately
00:05:57,00:05:59,a millimetre and a half long.
00:05:59,00:06:01,It's not huge.
00:06:01,00:06:02,"Proportionally, is that OK?"
00:06:02,00:06:04,It's still quite small. It's still tiny.
00:06:04,00:06:07,"Proportionally, it's still small."
00:06:07,00:06:08,"It is quite, yeah."
00:06:08,00:06:09,"And they don't even have a scrotum,"
00:06:09,00:06:10,so they can't be judged on that.
00:06:10,00:06:14,"So the whole penis is between 1.2 and 2.5 millimetres long,"
00:06:14,00:06:15,which is a tenth of an inch.
00:06:15,00:06:16,"I mean, just to be clear,"
00:06:16,00:06:19,"we're not judging them on anything, are we, Andy?"
00:06:19,00:06:20,"Well, speak for yourself, I am."
00:06:20,00:06:22,"Just, just, just."
00:06:22,00:06:26,"There's not many people Andy can judge on this particular metric,"
00:06:26,00:06:29,but the one millimetre penis golden mole.
00:06:29,00:06:31,You betcha.
00:06:31,00:06:36,Those idiots with their even smaller penises.
00:06:36,00:06:37,Just.
00:06:38,00:06:42,"Oh, my God."
00:06:42,00:06:44,I was reading the other day.
00:06:44,00:06:46,"In fact, this might have been something that was written by you, Andy."
00:06:46,00:06:49,I'm not sure about scrotums.
00:06:49,00:06:54,And about how all mammals used to live.
00:06:54,00:06:57,"Sorry, has Andy been publishing scrotum papers"
00:06:57,00:06:59,in the background of this podcast?
00:06:59,00:07:02,It's about how they're much too big at scrotums.
00:07:02,00:07:04,And they make perfectly reasonable penises.
00:07:04,00:07:07,Looks small.
00:07:07,00:07:12,"Right, it was about how all mammals used to live."
00:07:12,00:07:15,Used to be nocturnal and used to hunt at night.
00:07:15,00:07:18,"And the reason was,"
00:07:18,00:07:21,one of the reasons was it was much colder at night.
00:07:21,00:07:24,"And if you were in the daytime, it was too hot."
00:07:24,00:07:25,"And if you didn't have a scrotum,"
00:07:25,00:07:29,your testicles would be inside your body and they get too hot.
00:07:29,00:07:33,And so one of the things that allowed mammals to live during the day
00:07:33,00:07:36,"was scrotums, because then the testicles hung outside,"
00:07:36,00:07:37,"which is a bit cooler,"
00:07:37,00:07:39,which meant they could spend time in the sunshine.
00:07:39,00:07:40,"Oh, wow."
00:07:40,00:07:45,"So without scrotums, we'd all be living at night."
00:07:45,00:07:46,That's very cool.
00:07:46,00:07:47,"Yeah, great theory."
00:07:47,00:07:48,"Was that one of your papers, Andy?"
00:07:48,00:07:50,"You don't seem to have a very good memory of it, of course."
00:07:50,00:07:51,"I write, to be honest,"
00:07:51,00:07:53,"I write so many papers about the scrotum,"
00:07:53,00:07:56,but it's hard to differentiate them.
00:07:56,00:07:58,"And do they even like mating, though?"
00:07:58,00:07:59,Because they're super anti-social.
00:07:59,00:08:02,"In fact, all mammals are really anti-social, aren't they?"
00:08:02,00:08:06,"But golden moles don't hang out together at all, massive loners."
00:08:06,00:08:09,And I think they're quite bad parents.
00:08:09,00:08:11,"Again, in common with normal moles,"
00:08:11,00:08:14,"which after when their kids are just a couple of weeks old,"
00:08:14,00:08:16,"I think they literally take them in the burrow,"
00:08:16,00:08:20,they shove them up to the top and then they seal the entrance.
00:08:20,00:08:23,So their baby is just then stranded and they've got a bugger off.
00:08:23,00:08:24,"You could say the golden moles,"
00:08:24,00:08:27,they are the massive loners with the tiny boners.
00:08:27,00:08:29,That's how you can remember what they are.
00:08:29,00:08:32,"Yeah, that's a tagline."
00:08:32,00:08:34,"That's what you're chanting as you go through the desert,"
00:08:34,00:08:35,"bullying them, isn't it?"
00:08:35,00:08:40,"Yeah, moles like actual moles."
00:08:40,00:08:43,"You're right, they're really, they are loners."
00:08:43,00:08:45,They don't like to go anywhere near each other.
00:08:45,00:08:47,And each animal has a territory
00:08:47,00:08:49,which is about the size of a football pitch.
00:08:49,00:08:49,Whoa.
00:08:49,00:08:51,"That's a lot, isn't it?"
00:08:51,00:08:53,"For each, for one mole."
00:08:53,00:08:54,That's greedy.
00:08:54,00:08:56,That's a lot of real estate.
00:08:56,00:08:57,That's insane.
00:08:57,00:09:00,"We should say, yeah, the golden mole is extremely mole-like."
00:09:00,00:09:02,And I think it should be a mole
00:09:02,00:09:03,because it does everything that moles do.
00:09:03,00:09:05,But it's actually not an official mole.
00:09:05,00:09:07,It's miles away from it on the taxonomic tree
00:09:07,00:09:09,and they're more closely related to elephants
00:09:09,00:09:10,than they are to moles.
00:09:10,00:09:14,"And in fact, according to the Wikipedia page,"
00:09:14,00:09:17,"it's at the moment classified as a chrysochloridite,"
00:09:17,00:09:18,but that's under review.
00:09:18,00:09:21,So we're kind of unclear where we put them on the evolutionary tree.
00:09:21,00:09:21,What does that mean?
00:09:21,00:09:24,It just means that they're classified as something.
00:09:24,00:09:26,But we're not really sure where they are.
00:09:26,00:09:29,"And, you know, we might move them to another bit of the tree."
00:09:29,00:09:31,The Wikipedia page on them is really good.
00:09:31,00:09:34,"I don't know who wrote it, but some real expert."
00:09:34,00:09:36,I guess you would have to be an expert on the golden mole
00:09:36,00:09:36,to write about it.
00:09:36,00:09:38,"Yeah, I can."
00:09:38,00:09:41,"No, but some of, you know, it's, I just shout out to Wikipedia"
00:09:41,00:09:43,because it's very clearly written and comprehensive.
00:09:43,00:09:45,"It also has this fact, which I loved."
00:09:45,00:09:49,"They have only one toe on each forefoot,"
00:09:49,00:09:51,which has evolved into the shape of a pickaxe.
00:09:51,00:09:53,And all the other toes on their front feet
00:09:53,00:09:55,have kind of withered away.
00:09:55,00:09:59,So they are so efficient at digging through the sand
00:09:59,00:10:00,that they need to get through.
00:10:00,00:10:01,"Oh, cool. Yeah."
00:10:01,00:10:03,"And that actually is a bit different to moles, isn't it?"
00:10:03,00:10:06,Because moles have those kind of big paddles on their feet
00:10:06,00:10:07,where they push through the sand.
00:10:07,00:10:10,"But the golden moles, because they swim more like a shark,"
00:10:10,00:10:11,they've got to be slicker.
00:10:11,00:10:15,"Yeah, they're sometimes known as the shark of the dunes, aren't they?"
00:10:15,00:10:16,Are they? Yeah.
00:10:16,00:10:17,"And I think that's because, like Dan says,"
00:10:17,00:10:19,they're so close to the surface.
00:10:19,00:10:22,They've probably got one of their pickaxes sticking up.
00:10:22,00:10:25,"So you can, well, maybe even though one millimeter penis sticking up,"
00:10:25,00:10:27,"out of the sand, so you can see it."
00:10:27,00:10:30,That's when we're doing backstroke.
00:10:30,00:10:32,I just got one thing on moles.
00:10:32,00:10:36,"In 1519, a community in Italy launched a massive court case"
00:10:36,00:10:40,against moles on the grounds that they were damaging crops.
00:10:40,00:10:43,And you can read the full sort of transcript
00:10:43,00:10:46,of what the attorney's arguments were against and for the moles.
00:10:46,00:10:48,"And so the attorney for the defense of the moles,"
00:10:48,00:10:50,the moles couldn't come to court.
00:10:50,00:10:52,"So the attorney spoke for them in absentia,"
00:10:52,00:10:55,said they confer all these benefits.
00:10:55,00:10:58,"So they destroy nocturnal insects, for instance."
00:10:58,00:11:00,And he eventually argued successfully
00:11:00,00:11:03,"that if they are sentenced to be exiled,"
00:11:03,00:11:05,they should be found a suitable place of abode
00:11:05,00:11:08,and have safe conduct on the way there
00:11:08,00:11:10,"to secure them from harm from cats and dogs, et cetera."
00:11:10,00:11:13,"And the judge is there, and you can read his ruling,"
00:11:13,00:11:16,"where he did in fact agree the moles were to be exiled,"
00:11:16,00:11:18,but they were given safe conduct.
00:11:18,00:11:20,And any pregnant mole or mole with young children
00:11:20,00:11:25,had an extra 14 days to leave the community.
00:11:25,00:11:29,There's no evidence as to how this was actually enforced afterwards.
00:11:29,00:11:31,- Quite often what happened with those kind of things
00:11:31,00:11:35,"is they would say, okay, well, let's say for instance rats."
00:11:35,00:11:38,"There are rats here, we need to get rid of them."
00:11:38,00:11:41,So we're gonna make a law to say they have to go within 14 days.
00:11:41,00:11:43,"And then when they haven't got in 14 days, they go,"
00:11:43,00:11:45,"okay, well, we gave you a chance."
00:11:45,00:11:48,We're now gonna exterminate you.
00:11:48,00:11:50,"- There's like killing God's creatures, isn't it?"
00:11:50,00:11:53,"You have to give, 'cause you shouldn't be destroying"
00:11:53,00:11:58,too much of God's creation without having legal authority to do it.
00:11:58,00:12:00,Mole prison would be amazing though.
00:12:00,00:12:02,"That would be a really fun thing to film,"
00:12:02,00:12:05,because obviously they'd all just tunnel away immediately.
00:12:05,00:12:08,- The Great Escape would be a much longer film.
00:12:08,00:12:15,"- Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that's my fact."
00:12:15,00:12:19,My fact this week is that Mozart and Beethoven both compose music
00:12:19,00:12:22,for an instrument made entirely of glass.
00:12:22,00:12:26,It was invented by Benjamin Franklin.
00:12:26,00:12:30,"Benjamin Franklin invented what was an incredible instrument,"
00:12:30,00:12:33,"hugely popular in the 1700s,"
00:12:33,00:12:36,and so massive that it was used by some
00:12:36,00:12:38,of the biggest composers of the day.
00:12:38,00:12:40,I had no idea there was a connection between Franklin
00:12:40,00:12:42,and say Mozart and Beethoven.
00:12:42,00:12:44,"That's like, you know, hearing."
00:12:44,00:12:46,"- Come on, Franklin's connected to everyone."
00:12:46,00:12:48,He was the Giles Brandrith officer.
00:12:48,00:12:52,"I mean, he knew everyone and he did everything."
00:12:52,00:12:54,"- So Dan, why don't you tell us about this glass instrument?"
00:12:54,00:12:56,Was it like a violin made of glass
00:12:56,00:12:57,or a drum made of glass?
00:12:57,00:12:59,That wouldn't work.
00:12:59,00:13:00,"- Yeah, so it's called an armonica,"
00:13:00,00:13:03,and effectively it's kind of like a glass piano.
00:13:03,00:13:10,So Franklin in the 1700s was seeing a lot of people play glass bowls
00:13:10,00:13:12,"that are tuned to notes, which you still see a lot of people doing."
00:13:12,00:13:14,You know that thing with the wine glass?
00:13:14,00:13:17,If you lick your finger and you run it over the lid and it's...
00:13:17,00:13:20,"- Yeah, basically when the conversation dries up enough"
00:13:20,00:13:23,"in a wedding, everyone starts doing that."
00:13:23,00:13:24,"- Yes, exactly."
00:13:24,00:13:26,And so he thought this is really beautiful music
00:13:26,00:13:28,and you can see people making tunes out of it.
00:13:28,00:13:31,"The problem is, is that if you were going to play that at a gig,"
00:13:31,00:13:33,you have to line up 50 glasses.
00:13:33,00:13:35,It's not practical because you could smash one
00:13:35,00:13:37,and suddenly that's your C note gone.
00:13:37,00:13:39,So what he did was he created an instrument
00:13:39,00:13:42,whereby he had a glassblower in London
00:13:42,00:13:46,turn it into effectively like a piano that you play.
00:13:46,00:13:49,"- And just to say when you play it, it works by a foot pedal, right?"
00:13:49,00:13:51,So he made it horizontal.
00:13:51,00:13:53,"So usually you'd have the glasses standing up vertically,"
00:13:53,00:13:55,so you have to hold them down with one hand
00:13:55,00:13:58,and we've all done it at dinner parties.
00:13:58,00:14:00,But he put them horizontally and attached them more than a row
00:14:00,00:14:03,and then you spun them round constantly with a foot pedal.
00:14:03,00:14:05,So I think you just had to sort of...
00:14:05,00:14:07,"If you touched it with your hands, it would be constantly spinning."
00:14:07,00:14:11,But then I can't work out where you put the jar of water.
00:14:11,00:14:12,- I must watch a video of it
00:14:12,00:14:16,because you've got to keep moistening your hands to keep it working.
00:14:16,00:14:18,So presumably you have to dip it like a finger ball.
00:14:18,00:14:19,"- Yeah, you have to do that."
00:14:19,00:14:20,"Although quite soon afterwards,"
00:14:20,00:14:23,there was a new version that was made like an improvement
00:14:23,00:14:26,where there was a little trough of water underneath the glasses.
00:14:26,00:14:29,"So when they span, they kind of got moistened by themselves,"
00:14:29,00:14:30,which is quite clever.
00:14:30,00:14:32,- That's crafty.
00:14:32,00:14:35,- It went from being a hugely popular instrument
00:14:35,00:14:38,to suddenly a lot of controversy
00:14:38,00:14:41,because people started noticing a few things about it
00:14:41,00:14:44,and reporting that it was sending people mad.
00:14:44,00:14:45,"- Oh yeah, that's right."
00:14:45,00:14:48,"- Yeah, and that in some cases,"
00:14:48,00:14:51,a few deaths were supposedly off the back of it.
00:14:51,00:14:54,And suddenly books were publishing
00:14:54,00:14:56,that this was a dangerous instrument.
00:14:56,00:14:57,And then suddenly they were saying
00:14:57,00:14:59,it was the most dangerous instrument in the world.
00:14:59,00:15:00,And its reputation... - It's really unfair.
00:15:00,00:15:02,"- Yeah, it's extraordinary."
00:15:02,00:15:05,"It basically, fake news took it down as an instrument."
00:15:05,00:15:08,And there was a lot of theory that possibly there's a bit of truth
00:15:08,00:15:10,"to why people were sent mad,"
00:15:10,00:15:12,which was off the back of the instrument itself
00:15:12,00:15:16,and licking your fingers on an instrument all the time.
00:15:16,00:15:19,- So the theory was that there were crystal balls
00:15:19,00:15:22,and they were on this harmonica spindle.
00:15:22,00:15:24,And they contain some lead.
00:15:24,00:15:28,"And some people thought maybe the lead from the balls,"
00:15:28,00:15:29,'cause you can play with both hands.
00:15:29,00:15:31,"If you haven't broad enough span,"
00:15:31,00:15:32,you can play 10 notes at the same time.
00:15:32,00:15:33,It's quite impressive.
00:15:33,00:15:38,And people thought you can maybe absorb lead into your fingers
00:15:38,00:15:40,"if that kills you, blah, blah, blah, lead poisoning."
00:15:40,00:15:42,"However, it has also been pointed out"
00:15:42,00:15:44,that this is unbelievably unlikely.
00:15:44,00:15:46,"Because at the time that the harmonica was being played,"
00:15:46,00:15:49,doctors widely prescribed massive doses of lead
00:15:49,00:15:51,for various ailments.
00:15:51,00:15:52,Food was preserved with lead oxide.
00:15:52,00:15:54,Food was cooked in lead pots.
00:15:54,00:15:56,People drank from lead vessels.
00:15:56,00:15:59,Like the main lead risk in the 18th century
00:15:59,00:16:01,was not the glass harmonica.
00:16:01,00:16:05,(all laughing)
00:16:05,00:16:07,- I think it's just 'cause it was spooky.
00:16:07,00:16:09,- It makes a very ethereal noise.
00:16:09,00:16:13,"And also it was used by podcast favourite Franz Mesmer,"
00:16:13,00:16:14,wasn't it? - Yes.
00:16:14,00:16:16,- So he used to go around mesmerizing people.
00:16:16,00:16:18,"We've talked about him before, hypnotizing people."
00:16:18,00:16:20,And he used the harmonica
00:16:20,00:16:23,because it does make this very ghostly noise.
00:16:23,00:16:26,And so it was associated with hypnotizing ladies.
00:16:26,00:16:27,It's always ladies.
00:16:27,00:16:31,It's just all part of the constant 19th century panic
00:16:31,00:16:34,that anything women did that might be slightly challenging
00:16:34,00:16:36,or might slightly encroach on the world of men
00:16:36,00:16:38,must send them mad and cause them to faint
00:16:38,00:16:40,so they should be banned from doing it.
00:16:40,00:16:42,- But actually all the best players of this instrument
00:16:42,00:16:44,"were women, right?"
00:16:44,00:16:47,So the first person to publish a book about it
00:16:47,00:16:49,was called Anne Ford.
00:16:49,00:16:52,She published it in 1761.
00:16:52,00:16:54,She was married to a friend of Gainsborough
00:16:54,00:16:56,"who was called Philip Thickness,"
00:16:56,00:16:57,which is quite a good name.
00:16:57,00:17:00,And she was the person who actually came up
00:17:00,00:17:01,with the idea of turning the glasses
00:17:01,00:17:02,into an actual instrument.
00:17:02,00:17:04,Whether Franklin took the idea from her and did it
00:17:04,00:17:07,"or whether they came up with independently, I don't know."
00:17:07,00:17:09,But there was also someone called Marianne Davis
00:17:09,00:17:10,"who was the most famous player,"
00:17:10,00:17:12,probably in the whole of Europe.
00:17:12,00:17:14,And she went around Europe and taught it.
00:17:14,00:17:18,"And like Mozart met her and Mesmer, I think,"
00:17:18,00:17:20,watched her play and then decided
00:17:20,00:17:22,to bring it into his mesmerization and stuff.
00:17:22,00:17:24,So she was super famous.
00:17:24,00:17:26,"- Yeah, there was a double Marianne."
00:17:26,00:17:28,"It was a Marianne sandwich,"
00:17:28,00:17:29,although not with anything in the middle
00:17:29,00:17:31,'cause she was the one who popularized it in Europe.
00:17:31,00:17:34,And then maybe the best player of ever
00:17:34,00:17:37,was this German lady called Marianne Kirchgesner.
00:17:37,00:17:39,And Mozart towards the end of his life
00:17:39,00:17:42,wrote lots of stuff specifically for her on the Armonica.
00:17:42,00:17:43,"And actually when he died,"
00:17:43,00:17:46,he was in the middle of writing her another piece.
00:17:46,00:17:47,And she was very famous.
00:17:47,00:17:48,She was another jazz brand.
00:17:48,00:17:52,She sort of knew everyone like Goethe and Haydn.
00:17:52,00:17:54,But maybe there was some truth
00:17:54,00:17:56,to the Armonica cursing people
00:17:56,00:17:59,because she had sort of a nervous breakdown.
00:17:59,00:18:01,"- Yeah, in fact, all of the people who played it"
00:18:01,00:18:03,"in the 18th century, all dead."
00:18:03,00:18:06,That was such a good fight.
00:18:06,00:18:08,- Marianne Kirchgesner was assaulted
00:18:08,00:18:11,by Napoleon's soldiers in 1806.
00:18:11,00:18:12,And she never really recovered from that.
00:18:12,00:18:14,"So that was more the cause of her nervous breakdown,"
00:18:14,00:18:17,"I think, rather than the instrument."
00:18:17,00:18:21,"- Yeah, there's a great line about it from 1786."
00:18:21,00:18:24,This is a German player called Karl Röhlig.
00:18:24,00:18:27,"He said that the Armonica could make women faint,"
00:18:27,00:18:29,"send a dog into convulsions,"
00:18:29,00:18:31,make a sleeping girl wake screaming
00:18:31,00:18:33,through a cord of the diminished seventh
00:18:33,00:18:36,and even cause the death of one very young.
00:18:36,00:18:38,And that was the guy who played it for a living.
00:18:38,00:18:39,- Yeah. - Like a recommendation.
00:18:39,00:18:42,"- I think someone actually did die, didn't they?"
00:18:42,00:18:44,At the time that someone was playing a glass Armonica
00:18:44,00:18:46,and it was like a cause and effect thing.
00:18:46,00:18:47,"Everyone was like, oh my God,"
00:18:47,00:18:50,it must have been glass Armonica that caused it.
00:18:50,00:18:53,And that was like the start of the big sort of banning it.
00:18:53,00:18:54,They banned it in churches and stuff like that.
00:18:54,00:18:56,Didn't they in Germany?
00:18:56,00:18:58,"- So Dan, you mentioned that Franklin picked up"
00:18:58,00:19:00,this glass Armonica idea
00:19:00,00:19:03,by watching people play musical wine glasses.
00:19:03,00:19:06,And he actually did that in Britain.
00:19:06,00:19:07,"So in Britain and Ireland,"
00:19:07,00:19:10,this was an extremely popular musical instrument
00:19:10,00:19:12,before Franklin made it vaguely acceptable
00:19:12,00:19:13,to the rest of the world.
00:19:13,00:19:15,There would be concert halls that filled out with people
00:19:15,00:19:17,just spinning their fingers around wine glasses.
00:19:17,00:19:20,And the most famous player was this amazing guy
00:19:20,00:19:23,called Richard Puckridge or Puckridge.
00:19:23,00:19:24,"You know, there are various spellings."
00:19:24,00:19:25,But have you guys read about him?
00:19:25,00:19:27,He's amazing. - He's amazing.
00:19:27,00:19:28,I love him.
00:19:28,00:19:30,He's the best. - He's super fun.
00:19:30,00:19:33,So he was a self proclaimed inventor of musical glasses.
00:19:33,00:19:37,"He spent, he had all sorts of crazy ideas"
00:19:37,00:19:38,for how to make us fortune.
00:19:38,00:19:40,So he designed wings for human flight.
00:19:40,00:19:42,Don't think they took off.
00:19:42,00:19:45,"He said, he had this idea."
00:19:45,00:19:48,He wrote this paper about how you could regain youth
00:19:48,00:19:50,by injecting yourself with the blood of young maids.
00:19:50,00:19:52,And so he recommended blood transfusions
00:19:52,00:19:55,between young maids and anyone over 60.
00:19:55,00:19:56,- Just on that.
00:19:56,00:19:58,"So when he came up with that idea,"
00:19:58,00:20:01,"people took him quite seriously, some people."
00:20:01,00:20:03,And there was a big kind of hoo-ha
00:20:03,00:20:05,in the burial industry and the funeral industry.
00:20:05,00:20:06,"Cause they were like, well,"
00:20:06,00:20:08,"if people are going to live forever,"
00:20:08,00:20:10,then what are we going to do for a living?
00:20:10,00:20:13,And so he supposedly agreed that everyone
00:20:13,00:20:15,who was having this treatment would sign a contract
00:20:15,00:20:18,"that as soon as they reached 999 years old,"
00:20:18,00:20:20,they would have to pay a funeral company
00:20:20,00:20:21,for the price of a burial.
00:20:21,00:20:23,- Wow. - Oh my God.
00:20:23,00:20:25,"- I think they discussed that in parliament, didn't they?"
00:20:25,00:20:28,That was their token nod to what?
00:20:28,00:20:28,His ridiculous idea.
00:20:28,00:20:30,- It's such a funny idea.
00:20:30,00:20:33,But what do the funeral people do for the first 900 years?
00:20:33,00:20:34,They're looking at that money.
00:20:34,00:20:36,It's so weird.
00:20:36,00:20:38,"- I think they discussed that in parliament, didn't they?"
00:20:38,00:20:42,That was their token nod to what his ridiculous idea.
00:20:42,00:20:44,"I liked, he had an account once of doing a concert"
00:20:44,00:20:46,"where three hours before the performance,"
00:20:46,00:20:48,"he was going to do a concert on his glasses,"
00:20:48,00:20:49,which was quite fragile.
00:20:49,00:20:51,"And three hours before the performance,"
00:20:51,00:20:54,"a large, unmanly pig entered the room"
00:20:54,00:20:56,and smashed the whole machine to pieces.
00:20:57,00:20:59,"- That's an excuse for someone who hasn't done the homework,"
00:20:59,00:21:01,hasn't learned the piece that they're going to need to play.
00:21:01,00:21:03,"They have a brilliant brainwave, they think, get me a pig."
00:21:03,00:21:05,"- Sorry, a pig at my instrument."
00:21:05,00:21:08,"It's like, there was another thing I saw."
00:21:08,00:21:10,It was a newspaper article.
00:21:10,00:21:12,He took out an advert to apologize
00:21:12,00:21:15,because he'd done a concert that everyone thought was terrible.
00:21:15,00:21:17,"And the advert said, ""Mr. Potkrich takes this opportunity"
00:21:17,00:21:20,"""to apologize to the public for their disappointment."
00:21:20,00:21:23,"""He added a glass too much to his instrument."""
00:21:23,00:21:26,And I can't tell whether that means he put one glass in there
00:21:26,00:21:28,"and it meant all his notes were off,"
00:21:28,00:21:30,"or whether it's a euphemism for, ""I got really pissed"
00:21:30,00:21:32,"""and I couldn't do the concert."""
00:21:32,00:21:34,"It sounds like it doesn't it? - I think it's that, yeah."
00:21:34,00:21:36,- That's true. - That's so good.
00:21:36,00:21:39,Another band instrument during the early 1900s
00:21:39,00:21:43,"was the saxophone, Nazi Germany bandit."
00:21:43,00:21:45,They saw it as a symbol of jazz.
00:21:45,00:21:46,So it wasn't that it was turning you
00:21:46,00:21:50,into a different mental state.
00:21:50,00:21:53,It was purely that they didn't like it at all.
00:21:53,00:21:57,"But church's bandit as well in the early 1900s,"
00:21:57,00:21:59,the Vatican bandit in 1914.
00:21:59,00:22:02,"And I just love, I've never thought of a saxophone"
00:22:02,00:22:03,being in the Vatican church. - No.
00:22:03,00:22:06,- Sort of busting out a solo.
00:22:06,00:22:09,"What an image, but yeah, they banned it."
00:22:09,00:22:11,So maybe we'll never get to see it.
00:22:11,00:22:15,Obviously there was the thought that it suggested
00:22:15,00:22:17,and promoted sexual dancing.
00:22:17,00:22:20,So that was a thing that they wanted to avoid as well.
00:22:20,00:22:23,- That is like a church sort of banning gangster rap
00:22:23,00:22:25,"in churches though, isn't it?"
00:22:25,00:22:26,"It's like people going,"
00:22:26,00:22:28,"""We weren't going to do this anyway, guys."
00:22:28,00:22:29,"Don't worry about it."""
00:22:29,00:22:32,- It's like me as a 14-year-old banning supermodel
00:22:32,00:22:33,from my birthday party.
00:22:33,00:22:35,There was never any prospect.
00:22:35,00:22:41,"- Okay, it is time for fact number three,"
00:22:41,00:22:43,and that is Andy.
00:22:43,00:22:46,- My fact is that envelopes used to be made of clay.
00:22:46,00:22:49,"- Wow, so..."
00:22:49,00:22:50,- That must have been a hard job
00:22:50,00:22:53,"being a postman in those days, right?"
00:22:53,00:22:55,"- Yeah, so this was..."
00:22:55,00:22:57,"We're used to envelopes being made of paper, obviously."
00:22:57,00:22:59,"What we think of as the classic material for them,"
00:22:59,00:23:01,"but it's not, it's not the original."
00:23:01,00:23:06,"So this is in Babylonian era times,"
00:23:06,00:23:09,"in 2000 BC, give or take,"
00:23:09,00:23:11,"what you would do if you were writing a message to someone,"
00:23:11,00:23:14,"you would write a message on a clay tablet,"
00:23:14,00:23:15,"and that would dry,"
00:23:15,00:23:17,"and then that would be the thing that you were sending,"
00:23:17,00:23:20,but you wouldn't send that just open
00:23:20,00:23:21,because anyone could read it.
00:23:21,00:23:23,"So you needed an envelope,"
00:23:23,00:23:25,"and to make that, you would put more wet clay"
00:23:25,00:23:28,"over the tablet, press the ends together to seal it,"
00:23:28,00:23:31,"and then you put the whole thing in a kiln, bake it,"
00:23:31,00:23:34,"and then you send that massive baked package of clay,"
00:23:34,00:23:37,"and the recipient has to smash it open,"
00:23:37,00:23:40,"the outer envelope, to receive the tablet"
00:23:40,00:23:42,"that's on the inside, and that's what you do."
00:23:42,00:23:45,"- That's a pretty exciting way of opening a letter, isn't it?"
00:23:45,00:23:47,Smashing it with a hammer. - It is.
00:23:47,00:23:47,- Yeah.
00:23:47,00:23:51,- I always think sometimes I rip the end off an envelope
00:23:51,00:23:54,"to get the inside rather than opening it up with the seal,"
00:23:54,00:23:56,"and I always think I'm pretty cool when I do that,"
00:23:56,00:23:57,but this is even better.
00:23:57,00:24:00,"- Just imagine this is the next level, yeah?"
00:24:00,00:24:01,Imagine what fun you would have had
00:24:01,00:24:02,if they'd been in Babylonia.
00:24:02,00:24:04,(laughing)
00:24:04,00:24:07,"- For people's birthdays must have been interesting,"
00:24:07,00:24:10,"'cause I mean, you just spent about six hours"
00:24:10,00:24:11,beasing away at clay.
00:24:11,00:24:14,- There really aren't very many samples
00:24:14,00:24:15,"of these things around,"
00:24:15,00:24:18,'cause obviously they were designed to be smashed on delivery.
00:24:18,00:24:20,"There are some, thank goodness, but yeah."
00:24:20,00:24:22,"- Yeah, because Pierce Fletcher,"
00:24:22,00:24:24,the producer of QI's got one.
00:24:24,00:24:25,- Has he?
00:24:25,00:24:26,"- Yeah, he bought one when he was in,"
00:24:26,00:24:29,"I think he was in Iraq or something many, many years ago,"
00:24:29,00:24:31,but he bought one.
00:24:31,00:24:33,It's dated to 2028 BC.
00:24:33,00:24:35,"He knows when it's dated to,"
00:24:35,00:24:37,and he says you can see the thumbprint
00:24:37,00:24:39,left of the person who put it in the kiln
00:24:39,00:24:42,"on the thing, which gives it some kind of human touch,"
00:24:42,00:24:44,but he says that it was an invoice
00:24:44,00:24:47,"for a consignment of animal fodder,"
00:24:47,00:24:49,"which is not exactly the most exciting thing,"
00:24:49,00:24:52,"'cause none of us can read Cuneiform,"
00:24:52,00:24:53,"which is what it was written in, right?"
00:24:53,00:24:55,So he might as well have said it was a love letter
00:24:55,00:24:56,"to someone or something, but."
00:24:56,00:24:59,(laughing)
00:24:59,00:25:00,"- They very rarely were, they weren't they?"
00:25:00,00:25:02,It was all accounting.
00:25:02,00:25:04,"I'm glad you clarified why he has it,"
00:25:04,00:25:06,'cause genuinely I thought that was just a dig
00:25:06,00:25:07,"at Pierce Fletcher's age,"
00:25:07,00:25:09,'cause he is a middle-aged man.
00:25:09,00:25:11,I just thought you were claiming that's how he--
00:25:11,00:25:13,- He got it for his 21st birthday.
00:25:13,00:25:14,"He's got a few of them, yeah."
00:25:14,00:25:17,(laughing)
00:25:17,00:25:18,- Didn't it used to be the case as well
00:25:18,00:25:20,"that a lot of these, and it was Sumerian"
00:25:20,00:25:22,"and Babylonian, wasn't it?"
00:25:22,00:25:25,And they'd have the same stuff written on the outside
00:25:25,00:25:26,as on the inside.
00:25:26,00:25:29,So a lot of the time they were used
00:25:29,00:25:31,as protection against fraud.
00:25:31,00:25:34,And so these are the very oldest ones.
00:25:34,00:25:35,"Basically, you'd have a record of a transaction,"
00:25:35,00:25:37,like I've sold you this many bumblebees
00:25:37,00:25:42,"for this many dinars, and you put that in your clay,"
00:25:42,00:25:43,"and then you sealed it up,"
00:25:43,00:25:46,and then you wrote exactly the same thing on the envelope.
00:25:46,00:25:48,"And the way it worked was, when the recipient got it,"
00:25:48,00:25:50,if there was a dispute over whether the envelope
00:25:50,00:25:53,"had been tampered with, then you smashed it open"
00:25:53,00:25:54,to check the inside.
00:25:54,00:25:55,"- Oh, okay."
00:25:55,00:25:57,"- It was to make sure they were the same inside and out,"
00:25:57,00:26:00,"'cause otherwise you could melt the clay, soften it,"
00:26:00,00:26:00,and then change--
00:26:00,00:26:02,"- Oh, put an extra zero on."
00:26:02,00:26:04,"I wanted this many dinars, very crap."
00:26:04,00:26:06,- Or this many bees. - Exactly.
00:26:06,00:26:08,"- Yeah, it's very open to dispute."
00:26:08,00:26:11,You get a lot of envelopes that you can see
00:26:11,00:26:15,"in like postage museums that have got holes punched in them,"
00:26:15,00:26:16,and that's because they used to fumigate them
00:26:16,00:26:18,when there were pandemics
00:26:18,00:26:20,and when there were diseases going around.
00:26:20,00:26:23,"So like, for instance, when there was yellow fever around,"
00:26:23,00:26:25,"people would put little holes in,"
00:26:25,00:26:28,and they would fire like formaldehyde gas or smoke
00:26:28,00:26:31,or whatever to try and kill the pathogens.
00:26:31,00:26:35,And if you send a letter to any zip code in America
00:26:35,00:26:39,"that begins 202, 203, 204, or 205,"
00:26:39,00:26:43,then it will be irradiated before it gets there.
00:26:43,00:26:46,"And that's because they are the zip codes of Washington, DC,"
00:26:46,00:26:48,"around the federal agencies,"
00:26:48,00:26:50,and they go to a special place
00:26:50,00:26:51,where they're put on a conveyor belt
00:26:51,00:26:53,"and they're fired radiation at them,"
00:26:53,00:26:56,"which will kill any bacteria, any viruses, anthrax,"
00:26:56,00:26:57,all that kind of stuff.
00:26:57,00:26:59,Then they're aired out and then they're sent.
00:26:59,00:27:02,"So if you're Donald Trump and you get a letter,"
00:27:02,00:27:05,it's gonna be quite faded and crispy
00:27:05,00:27:06,and a little bit yellow.
00:27:06,00:27:08,That's all his mail is gonna be a little bit like that
00:27:08,00:27:10,because it's gone through this process.
00:27:10,00:27:11,"Yeah, it's so cool."
00:27:11,00:27:14,"And that was a response, wasn't it, to the anthrax spores"
00:27:14,00:27:17,that they were put in the post in Washington in about 2001.
00:27:17,00:27:18,"And five people died,"
00:27:18,00:27:21,"and there were lots of facilities contaminated,"
00:27:21,00:27:24,so this is kind of their way of dealing with that.
00:27:24,00:27:26,"Apparently, people who work at the Royal Mail say,"
00:27:26,00:27:28,"one of the serious problems they have,"
00:27:28,00:27:30,"the sorters who have to sort through the envelopes,"
00:27:30,00:27:33,is that people don't seal their envelopes.
00:27:33,00:27:34,"And there's lots of complaining about this online,"
00:27:34,00:27:35,and they say it's very annoying
00:27:35,00:27:37,because often you have to match a card with its envelope
00:27:37,00:27:38,and it's hard to do.
00:27:38,00:27:41,I imagine there are lots of sort of missent things
00:27:41,00:27:44,where the wrong card's been put in the wrong envelope.
00:27:44,00:27:45,"And they don't know why people do it,"
00:27:45,00:27:49,but there's speculation that it's based on the old paper rate.
00:27:49,00:27:52,"So this was something that was abolished in 1969,"
00:27:52,00:27:55,but I believe Piers Fletcher formerly mentioned
00:27:55,00:27:58,"""Centre of Cuneiform Tablets"" does remember it."
00:27:58,00:28:00,He's posted about this on the forums before.
00:28:00,00:28:02,"And this was, if you wanted to send printed matter,"
00:28:02,00:28:05,"like newspapers or pamphlets, it was just a hate me."
00:28:05,00:28:07,So it was a reduced price.
00:28:07,00:28:10,"But you had to send it an unsealed envelope,"
00:28:10,00:28:11,"and then the postman would open the envelope,"
00:28:11,00:28:13,check that you hadn't put anything
00:28:13,00:28:14,"other than a newspaper in there,"
00:28:14,00:28:18,and then seal the envelope up after that.
00:28:18,00:28:19,"And if you send a sealed envelope,"
00:28:19,00:28:20,then you'd have to pay extra.
00:28:20,00:28:22,So there's the idea that there are still some people out there
00:28:22,00:28:24,who think that maybe you'll only have to pay a hate me
00:28:24,00:28:27,if you leave the envelope unsealed.
00:28:27,00:28:28,"But yeah, cheaper to not."
00:28:28,00:28:30,"- No, who is still paying a hate penny for their stamps?"
00:28:30,00:28:33,"Other than Piers Fletcher, producer of QI,"
00:28:33,00:28:34,who is doing that?
00:28:36,00:28:38,- It's hard to say.
00:28:38,00:28:41,"- On the kind of unexpected antiquity of things,"
00:28:41,00:28:43,you know the window envelope?
00:28:43,00:28:47,And that's the one where you've got a little plastic window
00:28:47,00:28:48,so you can double up.
00:28:48,00:28:49,You don't need to write the address on the envelope
00:28:49,00:28:51,because it's part of the letter that you're being sent.
00:28:51,00:28:53,- You're not going to tell us they did that
00:28:53,00:28:55,"with Cuneiform Tablets, are you?"
00:28:55,00:28:56,- No.
00:28:56,00:28:57,When do you think that was invented?
00:28:57,00:29:00,"- Well, I would say in the '50s."
00:29:00,00:29:02,"- Thanks, James. Good guess."
00:29:02,00:29:03,- The '90s.
00:29:03,00:29:04,- '90s? Brilliant.
00:29:04,00:29:06,"Even better guess, for my purposes, Anna."
00:29:06,00:29:10,- I think I've got window envelopes at my house
00:29:10,00:29:11,from before the '90s.
00:29:11,00:29:15,I feel like I'd be cheated because I also researched this.
00:29:15,00:29:16,"- Okay, okay."
00:29:16,00:29:18,"Well, hey, Anna, who was writing window envelopes to you"
00:29:18,00:29:21,when you were two years old and you were needed?
00:29:21,00:29:24,- I was a very professional toddler.
00:29:24,00:29:27,"- They were designed, first designed in 1901"
00:29:27,00:29:29,and patented in 1902.
00:29:29,00:29:31,"They're older than powered flight,"
00:29:31,00:29:33,which I find very weird.
00:29:33,00:29:35,- You find it impressive that we had the technology
00:29:35,00:29:37,that windowed envelopes before powered flight.
00:29:37,00:29:38,"- I've got to say, Andy,"
00:29:38,00:29:39,"do you think the Wright brothers,"
00:29:39,00:29:42,"when they first flew at Kitty Hawk,"
00:29:42,00:29:45,"everyone went, ""Yeah, but it's not a windowed envelope."""
00:29:45,00:29:46,Who is it?
00:29:46,00:29:48,"Come on, mate."
00:29:48,00:29:50,There is a guy in Sweden who's scared of them.
00:29:50,00:29:53,He has a phobia of window envelopes.
00:29:53,00:29:54,- Really?
00:29:54,00:29:56,"- Yeah, he was in court a few years ago."
00:29:56,00:30:00,"Basically, he'd been driving his scooter unregistered"
00:30:00,00:30:02,and without a license.
00:30:02,00:30:04,"And so they sent him letters saying,"
00:30:04,00:30:06,"""You need to pay a fine, old ever."""
00:30:06,00:30:09,But he says he had a phobia of window envelopes.
00:30:09,00:30:12,And so he never opened any of them.
00:30:12,00:30:14,"And the court partially ruled in his favor,"
00:30:14,00:30:17,saying he didn't know what was inside them.
00:30:17,00:30:19,And he just didn't like these official things.
00:30:19,00:30:21,He thought it might be something really bad.
00:30:21,00:30:23,"- He did get all the money together for the fine,"
00:30:23,00:30:26,but then this massive pig came into the room.
00:30:26,00:30:27,"- Hey, all the money."
00:30:27,00:30:29,(laughing)
00:30:29,00:30:31,"- So speaking of eating,"
00:30:31,00:30:33,"you used to be able to eat the windowed envelopes,"
00:30:33,00:30:33,didn't you?
00:30:33,00:30:34,- What?
00:30:34,00:30:38,"- First, in the original 1902 patent,"
00:30:38,00:30:40,just the window bit was made of rice paper.
00:30:40,00:30:42,"- Yeah, don't eat the whole envelope."
00:30:42,00:30:44,"- Don't eat the whole envelope, absolutely not."
00:30:44,00:30:45,But that would solve a lot of problems today
00:30:45,00:30:46,'cause they really irritate me
00:30:46,00:30:48,"'cause they're not recyclable, aren't they?"
00:30:48,00:30:49,'Cause you can't recycle.
00:30:49,00:30:50,"- No, they are recyclable."
00:30:50,00:30:53,"No, this is one of the big, modern myths of society."
00:30:53,00:30:55,"- It's the biggest. - Oh, God."
00:30:55,00:30:56,(laughing)
00:30:56,00:30:57,"- Anna, what have you done?"
00:30:57,00:31:00,You've destroyed literally millions of windowed envelopes.
00:31:00,00:31:02,- I know because you've been getting these envelopes
00:31:02,00:31:03,since you were two years old.
00:31:03,00:31:05,(laughing)
00:31:05,00:31:06,- They are recyclable.
00:31:06,00:31:07,- I always ate the window.
00:31:07,00:31:09,(laughing)
00:31:09,00:31:12,"- Rice paper is not see-through, I don't think."
00:31:12,00:31:14,"It's almost see-through, but it's not really see-through."
00:31:14,00:31:16,- So I think they weren't as good probably
00:31:16,00:31:17,"in the other days, the original patent."
00:31:17,00:31:20,It was quite translucent rather than transparent.
00:31:20,00:31:22,"- Also, if it gets wet, it just disintegrates."
00:31:22,00:31:24,- Another flaw.
00:31:24,00:31:27,(laughing)
00:31:27,00:31:28,"- Well, then you can see the address better."
00:31:28,00:31:30,So that's actually quite useful.
00:31:30,00:31:31,(laughing)
00:31:31,00:31:32,- Do you know you used to be able to buy stamps
00:31:32,00:31:33,from post boxes?
00:31:33,00:31:34,- Wow.
00:31:34,00:31:35,- This is another era
00:31:35,00:31:37,that producer of QI Pierce Fletcher might remember.
00:31:37,00:31:42,"This was in the 1930s and again, quite a short live."
00:31:42,00:31:44,- He does actually listen to these podcasts.
00:31:44,00:31:45,Can I just say?
00:31:45,00:31:47,- I know he does.
00:31:47,00:31:48,- He's going to be so excited.
00:31:48,00:31:50,James is going to talk about my Babylonian cuneiform.
00:31:50,00:31:51,"Come round, family."
00:31:51,00:31:53,Come round.
00:31:53,00:31:54,Everyone sit down.
00:31:54,00:31:55,"- Come round, grandchildren."
00:31:55,00:31:56,"Great, grandchildren."
00:31:56,00:31:57,"Great, great, grandchildren."
00:31:57,00:31:59,"Great, great, great grandchildren."
00:31:59,00:32:01,(laughing)
00:32:01,00:32:04,"Well, as you'll remember in the 1930s,"
00:32:04,00:32:06,post boxes were stamp vending machines.
00:32:06,00:32:09,"And if they had the word stamp engraved on them,"
00:32:09,00:32:10,you could put a penny in
00:32:10,00:32:13,and you automatically got two stamps out of it.
00:32:13,00:32:15,But they actually were abolished
00:32:15,00:32:16,because they kept on just eating people's pennies
00:32:16,00:32:18,and not dispensing the stamps.
00:32:18,00:32:20,Nice idea though.
00:32:20,00:32:21,- Very nice. - Very cool idea.
00:32:21,00:32:25,Can I tell you my favorite envelope story from 2020?
00:32:25,00:32:25,- Yep. - Of course.
00:32:25,00:32:26,- We've all got one.
00:32:26,00:32:29,"- Yep, so this was in Ohio."
00:32:29,00:32:33,A man called Dan Kane went to the post office
00:32:33,00:32:35,to pick up a letter he was expecting
00:32:35,00:32:38,from the College Avenue student loan company.
00:32:38,00:32:40,"His daughter's tuition fee,"
00:32:40,00:32:42,it was a loan repayment scheme that he was doing.
00:32:42,00:32:45,So he went to pick up the letter
00:32:45,00:32:46,"and when he got there,"
00:32:46,00:32:49,he was told that there wasn't one letter for him.
00:32:49,00:32:51,"But due to an administrative error,"
00:32:51,00:32:54,"the college had sent him not one,"
00:32:54,00:32:57,"but 55,000 letters of the exact same letter."
00:32:57,00:33:00,- Wow.
00:33:00,00:33:02,- There were 79 bins of a mail
00:33:02,00:33:05,that contained roughly 700 copies
00:33:05,00:33:07,of the exact same letter addressed to him
00:33:07,00:33:10,and he had to bring them home.
00:33:10,00:33:11,He had to take them home with him.
00:33:11,00:33:12,- No. - Yeah.
00:33:12,00:33:14,"And when he got home, he opened it up"
00:33:14,00:33:17,to actually get the amount
00:33:17,00:33:19,'cause he needed to pay back this loan
00:33:19,00:33:21,and worked out that the company had accidentally
00:33:21,00:33:22,used the wrong interest rate
00:33:22,00:33:24,and they calculated the payment wrong.
00:33:24,00:33:26,So they were gonna have to send him another letter
00:33:26,00:33:28,with the right amount.
00:33:28,00:33:29,- That's amazing.
00:33:29,00:33:31,"- Yeah, and he worked out that roughly,"
00:33:31,00:33:33,"it would have cost them about,"
00:33:33,00:33:34,"or if someone worked out,"
00:33:34,00:33:36,"it would have cost them 11,000 American dollars"
00:33:36,00:33:39,"to have posted that mail. - Although,"
00:33:39,00:33:40,imagine how much worse that would have been
00:33:40,00:33:42,in the days of play envelope.
00:33:42,00:33:45,- Do you wanna know what my favorite story
00:33:45,00:33:47,from 2015 about envelopes is?
00:33:47,00:33:49,"- Yes. - Oh yeah, we all got one."
00:33:49,00:33:51,- I sort of rather have your 2020 one if I'm okay.
00:33:51,00:33:54,- I'm afraid I don't have one.
00:33:54,00:33:57,"In 2015, there was a guy in Gloucestershire"
00:33:57,00:34:00,"who got a Christmas card that just said,"
00:34:00,00:34:02,"""England on the envelope."""
00:34:02,00:34:05,He was walking down the road
00:34:05,00:34:07,"and the postman said to him,"
00:34:07,00:34:09,"""I don't suppose you're expecting anything"
00:34:09,00:34:10,"""from Germany, are you?"""
00:34:10,00:34:13,"And he said, ""Well, I've got a few friends in Germany."""
00:34:13,00:34:14,"And he said, ""Well, do you wanna have a look at this?"
00:34:14,00:34:16,"""It just says England on it."""
00:34:16,00:34:17,"And he looked and on the back,"
00:34:17,00:34:19,it was the address of his friends in Germany
00:34:19,00:34:21,and he opened it up and it was a Christmas card
00:34:21,00:34:23,from his friends in Germany.
00:34:23,00:34:24,- What? - Wow.
00:34:24,00:34:26,"- And he said, ""How did you know it was for me?"""
00:34:26,00:34:28,"And the postman said, ""Oh, I was just wandering around"
00:34:28,00:34:30,"""and I've just been asking people."""
00:34:30,00:34:33,- I've tried to be asking millions of people.
00:34:33,00:34:36,- It was from Christmas 1993
00:34:36,00:34:39,and he'd finally made it to that town.
00:34:39,00:34:40,- Wasn't that amazing?
00:34:40,00:34:42,"And what they reckon is, - That is insane."
00:34:42,00:34:43,- This is what they reckon happened.
00:34:43,00:34:46,Probably it used to have the correct address on
00:34:46,00:34:47,"and then it said England at the bottom,"
00:34:47,00:34:50,but maybe it was on a label and the label peeled off.
00:34:50,00:34:51,So it got to the right area.
00:34:51,00:34:53,"It got to the right post office,"
00:34:53,00:34:56,but it hadn't gotten the actual final address on it.
00:34:56,00:34:58,"And so this postman goes,"
00:34:58,00:35:00,"""Well, I might as well just try everyone that I see"
00:35:00,00:35:02,"""and just ask just in case."""
00:35:02,00:35:04,And he managed to find the right person.
00:35:04,00:35:06,- I'm just sort of imagining a guy
00:35:06,00:35:08,with a beard down to the floor in a ragged clothes
00:35:08,00:35:10,"who lost his job 25 years ago,"
00:35:10,00:35:13,just stumbling down the road.
00:35:13,00:35:14,Is it you?
00:35:14,00:35:15,I found him.
00:35:15,00:35:18,"- He eventually opens it when he's desperate,"
00:35:18,00:35:20,works out it's for him.
00:35:20,00:35:22,(laughing)
00:35:22,00:35:28,"Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show"
00:35:28,00:35:30,and that is James.
00:35:30,00:35:32,"- My fact this week is that in 1939,"
00:35:32,00:35:37,America made a huge vehicle to drive across Antarctica.
00:35:37,00:35:39,"Unfortunately, they put no tread on the tires"
00:35:39,00:35:41,so it couldn't drive on ice.
00:35:41,00:35:43,- Amazing. - This is so cool.
00:35:43,00:35:46,It's a thing called a snow cruiser.
00:35:46,00:35:49,And they knew that they wanted to drive across Antarctica
00:35:49,00:35:50,and they knew that they would need
00:35:50,00:35:52,something absolutely massive to do so
00:35:52,00:35:54,'cause they wanted to drive it out somewhere
00:35:54,00:35:57,and then do a load of experiments when they were in there.
00:35:57,00:36:00,And so they invented this enormous machine.
00:36:00,00:36:02,"It was in the middle of America where they invented,"
00:36:02,00:36:04,I think somewhere near Boston.
00:36:04,00:36:07,And they had to get it from Boston to the boat
00:36:07,00:36:08,and then from the boat to Antarctica
00:36:08,00:36:10,and then from the Antarctic boat
00:36:10,00:36:13,to the middle of Antarctica to do these things.
00:36:13,00:36:15,And they got it all the way to the Antarctic
00:36:15,00:36:19,and they realized that the wheels were just spinning round
00:36:19,00:36:20,whenever they tried to go anywhere.
00:36:20,00:36:23,They added some chains to it to try and get a bit of grip
00:36:23,00:36:25,and that was slightly better.
00:36:25,00:36:27,But they found out that the only way they could get anywhere
00:36:27,00:36:30,was to drive the whole thing in reverse.
00:36:30,00:36:33,And so they drove in reverse for 92 miles
00:36:33,00:36:37,to the middle of the Antarctic and they got there
00:36:37,00:36:39,and they could start doing some experiments
00:36:39,00:36:41,but they couldn't really get it back.
00:36:41,00:36:43,And so they ended up just leaving it there.
00:36:43,00:36:44,- So amazing. - Incredible.
00:36:44,00:36:47,- Which poor person had a horrendously cricked neck
00:36:47,00:36:51,"after doing that journey? - So bad, isn't it?"
00:36:51,00:36:52,"- 92 miles. - And you can just drive,"
00:36:52,00:36:54,"anyway, I mean, you can just drive backwards, can't you?"
00:36:54,00:36:56,"You don't need to look around, it's Antarctica."
00:36:56,00:36:57,What are you going to bump into?
00:36:57,00:36:59,You're going to bump into penguins
00:36:59,00:37:02,"or big lumps of ice or something, right?"
00:37:02,00:37:03,"- It just sounds hilarious,"
00:37:03,00:37:05,"the process of getting it there in the first place, right?"
00:37:05,00:37:08,There's this photo of transporting it
00:37:08,00:37:09,'cause I think it left from Boston
00:37:09,00:37:11,"but it was made in Chicago,"
00:37:11,00:37:13,maybe it was transported from Chicago.
00:37:13,00:37:15,"And so to get to Boston, it had to drive"
00:37:15,00:37:16,and it just drove along ordinary roads
00:37:16,00:37:19,and there was this huge pile up
00:37:19,00:37:21,"'cause there's this giant 55 foot long,"
00:37:21,00:37:24,"it's wheels are twice, three times the height"
00:37:24,00:37:27,"of a normal car, just sitting in the middle of a motorway."
00:37:27,00:37:30,"Well, the car's around it, like, what the hell is this thing?"
00:37:30,00:37:32,- They stopped in a place called Framingham
00:37:32,00:37:34,in Massachusetts on the way
00:37:34,00:37:36,and they just stopped it in the middle of the road
00:37:36,00:37:40,"and so there was a traffic jam of 70,000 cars behind it."
00:37:40,00:37:41,- Wow.
00:37:42,00:37:45,"- It was cool, it had a plane on it,"
00:37:45,00:37:48,it had a biplane on the roof for research.
00:37:48,00:37:51,"So it needed to carry a thousand gallons of fuel,"
00:37:51,00:37:52,just to fuel the plane.
00:37:52,00:37:55,And then it needed obviously thousands more gallons
00:37:55,00:37:56,of fuel all over it.
00:37:56,00:37:58,And it had to have two spare tyres
00:37:58,00:38:00,but the tyres were 10 feet tall.
00:38:00,00:38:02,So they were just in the back.
00:38:02,00:38:05,"- Yeah, each tyre had to be transported by dog sled."
00:38:05,00:38:08,- There's a brilliant picture on the Atlantic website
00:38:08,00:38:11,of 14 dogs pulling a single tyre
00:38:11,00:38:13,that just shows how big it was that they had to do that.
00:38:13,00:38:14,"- And they had to go backwards as well,"
00:38:14,00:38:16,that was the really dead end of the dog.
00:38:16,00:38:19,(laughing)
00:38:19,00:38:20,- Yeah.
00:38:20,00:38:22,"- And on that, in that article actually,"
00:38:22,00:38:24,there is a photo of it abandoned
00:38:24,00:38:27,"just after they decided, look, we're not gonna take it back."
00:38:27,00:38:28,And then there's a later photo
00:38:28,00:38:30,where it's kind of slightly buried by snow.
00:38:30,00:38:32,And then there's a final photo
00:38:32,00:38:35,where it's almost completely buried by snow.
00:38:35,00:38:36,And there's like a little hatch
00:38:36,00:38:38,where people can go in and out.
00:38:38,00:38:41,And then someone went back like in the '40s
00:38:41,00:38:43,to see if it was still there and they could find it.
00:38:43,00:38:46,"And actually it was kind of, they could still use it really."
00:38:46,00:38:48,"I mean, they couldn't really use it much in the first place"
00:38:48,00:38:50,but it was still kind of working.
00:38:50,00:38:54,And they found it again in the '50s in 1958.
00:38:54,00:38:56,But now they literally don't know where it is.
00:38:56,00:38:59,And it's probably covered under some snow
00:38:59,00:39:01,or it might have drifted off on an iceberg or something
00:39:01,00:39:03,but we literally don't know where this thing is.
00:39:03,00:39:05,"- Wow, it's amazing."
00:39:05,00:39:07,- Maybe some penguins have made it into a home.
00:39:07,00:39:08,"- Oh, that would be nice, wouldn't it?"
00:39:08,00:39:10,- So lovely. - Yeah.
00:39:10,00:39:12,There's one theory that the Soviets knew where it was
00:39:12,00:39:14,and they went back and stole it.
00:39:14,00:39:16,- Why? It's useless.
00:39:16,00:39:19,"Guys, do you know the first motorized vehicle"
00:39:19,00:39:21,in Antarctica as far as I know?
00:39:21,00:39:23,- No.
00:39:23,00:39:25,- It actually went with Shackleton.
00:39:25,00:39:26,"- Oh, really?"
00:39:26,00:39:28,"- Yeah, so this was in his first Antarctica expedition"
00:39:28,00:39:30,in 1907 and it was an Aral Johnston car
00:39:30,00:39:33,which were the makers of the first cars in Britain.
00:39:33,00:39:35,It was basically a big bit of PR for the car.
00:39:35,00:39:39,So quite inconvenient for the actual expedition.
00:39:39,00:39:41,"It did have, it had skis and it had special oil"
00:39:41,00:39:44,that didn't freeze and it had a silencer on the exhaust
00:39:44,00:39:46,that doubled as a foot warmer.
00:39:46,00:39:49,So it siphoned the warm air round to the front
00:39:49,00:39:51,to where your feet are. - That's clever.
00:39:51,00:39:53,- But they took it with them
00:39:53,00:39:54,and so they had to bring it on the boat.
00:39:54,00:39:57,They had to unload some of their crucial supplies
00:39:57,00:40:00,and equipment from the boat to make room for this car.
00:40:00,00:40:01,They brought it with them.
00:40:01,00:40:04,"They got it off the boat, put it on the snow"
00:40:04,00:40:06,and much like James' vehicle he mentioned
00:40:06,00:40:08,they started spinning the wheels
00:40:08,00:40:11,and they just went deeper and deeper into the snow.
00:40:11,00:40:13,"They thought, okay, we'll, we'll target with this for a bit."
00:40:13,00:40:15,Maybe we'll get it working.
00:40:15,00:40:17,They lasted two miles of pulling it along with them
00:40:17,00:40:19,"before Shackleton's crew went,"
00:40:19,00:40:22,can we just leave this chat behind please?
00:40:22,00:40:24,They abandoned it in the snow.
00:40:24,00:40:26,"But yeah, first car in the Antarctic."
00:40:26,00:40:28,- There was a car in the Antarctic
00:40:28,00:40:31,from a Shackleton very recently.
00:40:31,00:40:36,It was Patrick Bergl who was Shackleton's great-grandson.
00:40:36,00:40:38,You guys must have read about this.
00:40:38,00:40:41,It was a modified Hyundai Santa Fe
00:40:41,00:40:44,"but he actually did manage to get it working, right?"
00:40:44,00:40:47,So they said that the only modification was
00:40:47,00:40:50,"that they made the tires really, really big"
00:40:50,00:40:53,"and really, really loads of air inside."
00:40:53,00:40:55,"So it's as much as you could like,"
00:40:55,00:40:57,it could roll over your foot and you wouldn't feel it.
00:40:57,00:40:59,That's how much air was in the tires.
00:40:59,00:41:01,And that meant that it would never sink
00:41:01,00:41:02,into the ground.
00:41:02,00:41:05,And I imagine they had a lot of tread on there as well.
00:41:05,00:41:07,And they said that basically this is exactly like
00:41:07,00:41:10,a normal Hyundai Santa Fe apart from these tires.
00:41:10,00:41:11,"But then they did say,"
00:41:11,00:41:13,"oh, there is one other modification"
00:41:13,00:41:14,that it runs on jet fuel.
00:41:14,00:41:19,But the reason is 'cause jet fuel doesn't freeze
00:41:19,00:41:22,quite as easily as normal fuel.
00:41:22,00:41:22,- Ah-ha.
00:41:22,00:41:26,"But with that in that kind of atmosphere,"
00:41:26,00:41:29,lessen its punch when you put down the accelerator?
00:41:29,00:41:33,"- Yeah, they went on the average about 25 miles an hour,"
00:41:33,00:41:35,"I think, all the time. - Oh, okay, wow."
00:41:35,00:41:36,"- Well, that must have taken ages."
00:41:36,00:41:38,"'Cause they went, did they go all the way across?"
00:41:38,00:41:42,"- They went 5,800 kilometres across."
00:41:42,00:41:43,"Whether they went to the very end,"
00:41:43,00:41:46,I think they might have gone to the middle and back.
00:41:46,00:41:46,- I bet that was dull.
00:41:46,00:41:48,I bet it was exciting for the first couple of hours.
00:41:48,00:41:50,"And then old Shappenton's great grandson thought,"
00:41:50,00:41:52,what was my grandad thinking?
00:41:52,00:41:55,"- Didn't he work in, he's a marketing executive this guy."
00:41:55,00:41:56,- Yeah.
00:41:56,00:41:57,- He's not a ponder explorer.
00:41:57,00:41:58,- No.
00:41:58,00:41:58,- No.
00:41:58,00:42:01,- He just had to sit in a passenger seat of a car
00:42:01,00:42:02,to be there for a few weeks.
00:42:02,00:42:05,"- They've basically gone, we have a car which can do this."
00:42:05,00:42:06,Anyone can do it really.
00:42:06,00:42:08,Who can we get to do it?
00:42:08,00:42:11,"Does any of them have any relatives left,"
00:42:11,00:42:13,the people who went in the first place?
00:42:13,00:42:15,"But they did have one thing, sorry,"
00:42:15,00:42:16,just on this really quickly.
00:42:16,00:42:18,They did have one thing where they had a number
00:42:18,00:42:20,of these vehicles going across
00:42:20,00:42:21,and they had to be roped together.
00:42:21,00:42:23,"Because like you said, there can be crevasses."
00:42:23,00:42:25,"And apparently one of them did fall into a crevasse,"
00:42:25,00:42:27,but luckily it was kind of roped to all the other cars
00:42:27,00:42:29,so they could pull it out.
00:42:29,00:42:31,So it was kind of dangerous I think.
00:42:31,00:42:33,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely."
00:42:33,00:42:35,- That's very self-sacrificing of the other cars.
00:42:35,00:42:36,"'Cause it could happen the other way, right?"
00:42:36,00:42:37,If the cross is big enough
00:42:37,00:42:39,and you're in the front car and you've made it over
00:42:39,00:42:43,and then you're dragged back in by the tailgaters.
00:42:43,00:42:44,"- What, come on Anna."
00:42:44,00:42:46,"I mean, you're a team going across."
00:42:46,00:42:50,"I'm tactic, you're like like, fuck it, I'm in the front car."
00:42:50,00:42:51,The rest of them could do what they want.
00:42:51,00:42:54,"- I think we've learned in the ""Touching the Void"" episode"
00:42:54,00:42:57,"of ""No such thing as a fish"", he was cutting the rope."
00:42:57,00:42:58,- Yeah.
00:42:58,00:43:00,"- Yeah, I don't have the right attitude"
00:43:00,00:43:01,for polar expeditions.
00:43:01,00:43:05,- This fact is about driving backwards.
00:43:05,00:43:07,I found the guy who's driven backwards
00:43:07,00:43:10,"for the longest time, okay."
00:43:10,00:43:13,There is a taxi driver in India called Harpreet Dev
00:43:13,00:43:16,who has driven everywhere backwards
00:43:16,00:43:18,for about a decade now.
00:43:18,00:43:19,He's a-
00:43:19,00:43:21,"- Does this mean that at the end,"
00:43:21,00:43:24,"on your meter, on your taxi,"
00:43:24,00:43:27,he ends up having to give you money at the end?
00:43:27,00:43:32,- So he's been issued with a special government license
00:43:32,00:43:34,to drive anywhere in reverse in his home state.
00:43:34,00:43:37,"And he has a big old siren on his cab to warn people,"
00:43:37,00:43:39,but it's so surreal seeing footage of him
00:43:39,00:43:41,just driving around backwards all the time.
00:43:41,00:43:44,"He's reversed the gearbox, so he's got, you know,"
00:43:44,00:43:46,five gears in reverse and one forward.
00:43:46,00:43:48,And he says that the only disadvantage
00:43:48,00:43:50,to this great career he's got
00:43:50,00:43:52,"is that he gets frequent pains in the neck,"
00:43:52,00:43:53,"extremely bad back problems,"
00:43:53,00:43:56,and suffers what he calls severe vomiting.
00:43:56,00:43:58,- Oh man.
00:43:58,00:43:59,- I know.
00:43:59,00:44:01,- The worst thing about that with the severe vomiting
00:44:01,00:44:04,"is he's facing in the direction of his passengers, isn't he?"
00:44:04,00:44:08,- You'd pull the glass window.
00:44:08,00:44:13,- I definitely must have missed the detail there.
00:44:13,00:44:15,"Why is he driving backwards, sorry?"
00:44:15,00:44:16,"- No, you didn't miss it."
00:44:16,00:44:19,"- No, you didn't, you did not miss the detail."
00:44:19,00:44:22,He thought it would be fun and he thought it would be a fun gimmick.
00:44:22,00:44:24,"- And then despite the dangers of it,"
00:44:24,00:44:27,the government of the area also thought that was a great idea
00:44:27,00:44:29,and gave him license.
00:44:29,00:44:30,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:44:30,00:44:34,I think if one person is doing something extremely weird
00:44:34,00:44:37,"and dangerous, but everyone else knows he's doing it at least,"
00:44:37,00:44:41,"then everyone else can mitigate their actions to help him, right?"
00:44:41,00:44:43,- It's written on the side of the cab
00:44:43,00:44:45,that this is a backwards taxi.
00:44:45,00:44:48,- I think you can see that when he's coming towards you.
00:44:49,00:44:52,"- Yeah, he did try to drive backwards to Pakistan to promote peace,"
00:44:52,00:44:54,"but he did not have the permission to cross the border,"
00:44:54,00:44:56,so he was sent home again.
00:44:56,00:44:56,- Right.
00:44:56,00:45:04,- We were talking about people going across Antarctic a few seconds ago.
00:45:04,00:45:07,The first person to walk solo across Antarctica
00:45:07,00:45:10,"only brought one pair of underwear for the entire 38-day trip,"
00:45:10,00:45:13,"and unfortunately, he shit himself on day 16."
00:45:13,00:45:17,- I'm impressed he held it in that long.
00:45:17,00:45:20,"- Day 14 of Antarctic journey, going great so far."
00:45:20,00:45:24,"Day 15, still absolutely not regretting my underpanned decision."
00:45:24,00:45:25,Day 16.
00:45:25,00:45:26,"Oh, no."
00:45:26,00:45:30,"- The thing is, before he set off,"
00:45:30,00:45:32,"he did an interview with Business Insider,"
00:45:32,00:45:35,"and he said that he was only bringing one pair of underwear,"
00:45:35,00:45:38,and he was going to use the weight that he could take.
00:45:38,00:45:40,"He was going to use it for food,"
00:45:40,00:45:43,"so he's like, ""I don't need the underwear, I just need food,"""
00:45:43,00:45:48,"which kind of makes sense without the idea of retrospect,"
00:45:48,00:45:49,of realising that it didn't.
00:45:49,00:45:52,"And what happened was, it was the food that was a problem,"
00:45:52,00:45:54,"obviously, it is always the food that's a problem in that situation,"
00:45:54,00:45:58,but he- - He shouldn't have taken Vindaloo for every moment.
00:45:58,00:46:05,"- He took these things, he was called Colin O'Brady,"
00:46:05,00:46:09,"and he took these 1,180-calorie Colin bars"
00:46:09,00:46:11,"that had been made especially for him,"
00:46:11,00:46:15,"and so they had loads of protein, loads of good stuff in them,"
00:46:15,00:46:17,and he was just going to eat these bars all the way across.
00:46:17,00:46:20,"But one morning, he just got the munchies,"
00:46:20,00:46:23,and he just started eating all of these Colin bars.
00:46:23,00:46:28,"They could take coconut oil, nuts, dried cranberries, cocoa powder,"
00:46:28,00:46:31,"and he decided to eat just loads and loads of them,"
00:46:31,00:46:35,"and he had about 2,000 calories worth in one go,"
00:46:35,00:46:38,which is about the equivalent of eight Big Macs.
00:46:38,00:46:42,"And then the next morning, well, you all know what happened."
00:46:42,00:46:43,- Wow. - It's not exhibiting
00:46:43,00:46:45,"the kind of self-control you expect,"
00:46:45,00:46:49,"but he, O'Colin, is a very controversial figure"
00:46:49,00:46:52,"in Antarctic Lloyds, certainly is, yeah."
00:46:52,00:46:56,"Because, so he claims to be the first person"
00:46:56,00:47:01,"to have crossed the Antarctic, fully unassisted and unsupported,"
00:47:01,00:47:05,"so that originally went to this Norwegian guy called Borge Auslan,"
00:47:05,00:47:06,"and that was in the '90s, I think,"
00:47:06,00:47:11,but then they changed the definition to say that unsupported
00:47:11,00:47:12,had to mean without even a kite.
00:47:12,00:47:15,"So Borge had used a kite on two occasions,"
00:47:15,00:47:18,"very, very briefly, to get himself sort of out of Snowdrift."
00:47:18,00:47:19,"Can we just explain how that works,"
00:47:19,00:47:21,because it sounds like he's just having a bit of fun with a kite.
00:47:21,00:47:23,Sounds really fun.
00:47:23,00:47:26,"Was he allowed to take his yo-yo with him, though?"
00:47:26,00:47:30,"Sorry, it's for transport."
00:47:30,00:47:33,"It's not like you stop, you fancy a hobby."
00:47:33,00:47:35,"So I guess you're on your sled or whatever,"
00:47:35,00:47:38,and you harness the wind that's going in the right direction
00:47:38,00:47:39,"to pull you along with your kite,"
00:47:39,00:47:42,or to help you to give you a bit of extra oomph.
00:47:42,00:47:44,And he travelled a lot further to do his trip
00:47:44,00:47:46,"than O'Brady, who's just done his."
00:47:46,00:47:49,And a lot of people see Borge
00:47:49,00:47:51,as the person who really achieved this.
00:47:51,00:47:53,"And O'Brady's quite a self-promoter,"
00:47:53,00:47:57,"and he's written this book where he says everyone said it couldn't be done,"
00:47:57,00:48:01,and National Geographics interviewed everyone who advised him.
00:48:01,00:48:03,"They were all like, ""No, we told him it's pretty simple,"
00:48:03,00:48:04,"yeah, pretty straightforward."""
00:48:04,00:48:06,"And it was like, ""There were times I was told"
00:48:06,00:48:07,"they wouldn't be able to rescue me."""
00:48:07,00:48:10,"And then someone's done an interview saying,"
00:48:10,00:48:11,"""Getting rescued in the Antarctic is kind of like"
00:48:11,00:48:13,ordering an Uber these days.
00:48:13,00:48:16,"You just call someone up and you can't get you out of there."""
00:48:16,00:48:19,"It's very hard to see on the Uber map, though,"
00:48:19,00:48:21,"because against a featureless white background,"
00:48:21,00:48:23,"he could be two minutes away, he could be three days."
00:48:23,00:48:26,"Fortunately, there's a huge shit stain in the snow next to him."
00:48:26,00:48:28,He cleaned his pants.
00:48:28,00:48:33,You were saying about you could use the wind with these kites.
00:48:33,00:48:36,Do you know how you can tell which way the wind is going in Antarctica?
00:48:36,00:48:37,No.
00:48:37,00:48:39,"Well, there's a few ways."
00:48:39,00:48:42,You can just lick your finger and hold it up.
00:48:42,00:48:44,But not if you want to keep the finger.
00:48:44,00:48:45,"That's true, yeah."
00:48:45,00:48:50,One almost foolproof way is to look at which way the penguins are pointing.
00:48:50,00:48:53,"So if there is a storm coming in Antarctic,"
00:48:53,00:48:56,"the penguins will drop to their bellies,"
00:48:56,00:48:59,"and they will point their beaks in the direction that the wind's going to come,"
00:48:59,00:49:01,"because they know there's a storm coming,"
00:49:01,00:49:02,and they don't want to get blown over.
00:49:03,00:49:07,"I was reading this, this was an Antarctic scientist called Lizzie Meek,"
00:49:07,00:49:08,who was writing about this.
00:49:08,00:49:09,But isn't that cool?
00:49:09,00:49:12,You could just see which way the little penguins are pointing.
00:49:12,00:49:12,That was really funny.
00:49:12,00:49:13,That's great.
00:49:13,00:49:16,"Do you know who the first person, possibly,"
00:49:16,00:49:20,to set foot on the Antarctic continent might have been?
00:49:20,00:49:21,Was it QI producer Piers Fletcher?
00:49:21,00:49:28,"This is so random, but I just came across this in my notes I found ages ago."
00:49:28,00:49:31,"There was this amazing discovery in the 1980s,"
00:49:31,00:49:33,where some bones were found in Antarctica.
00:49:33,00:49:36,"And until then, we thought that the very first Antarctic landing"
00:49:36,00:49:39,was a sealing expedition in 1820.
00:49:39,00:49:41,"And they found these bones,"
00:49:41,00:49:46,and they've dated them to somewhere between 1815 and 1825.
00:49:46,00:49:51,"And they are the bones of a 21-year-old Indigenous Chilean woman,"
00:49:51,00:49:53,"which is just extraordinary,"
00:49:53,00:49:57,because no one had gone near the continent we didn't think until then.
00:49:57,00:49:59,"And suddenly, there's this young Chilean woman there."
00:49:59,00:50:02,No one knows where on earth she's come from or how she got there.
00:50:02,00:50:06,There's a suggestion that maybe the sealers who were European sealers
00:50:06,00:50:09,had found someone from Chile who would know
00:50:09,00:50:11,more on how to survive in that kind of environment
00:50:11,00:50:13,"and taken her with them, then left her."
00:50:13,00:50:14,But we just have no idea.
00:50:14,00:50:18,"So I just find that incredible, mystery."
00:50:18,00:50:18,Yeah.
00:50:18,00:50:21,"I found a page on Wikipedia,"
00:50:21,00:50:23,which is the list of crimes in Antarctica.
00:50:23,00:50:26,"Because, as we were saying before,"
00:50:26,00:50:27,"there's all these sort of, you know,"
00:50:27,00:50:29,to the point where you can order an Uber
00:50:29,00:50:29,to get rescued.
00:50:29,00:50:33,It's all these research stations that are planted.
00:50:33,00:50:36,I don't think you can order an Uber to get rescued.
00:50:36,00:50:36,Yeah.
00:50:36,00:50:39,"Well, it'll arrive backwards, that's the thing."
00:50:39,00:50:43,"Sorry, what I meant is it's the point of you could almost,"
00:50:43,00:50:46,"in theory, it's sort of got that sort of dense with places."
00:50:46,00:50:51,"And yeah, so there's all these, you know,"
00:50:51,00:50:53,research units where scientists are hauled up for ages.
00:50:53,00:50:56,"And as a result, there's a big list of the crimes"
00:50:56,00:50:57,"that they've committed, which is always really hard,"
00:50:57,00:50:59,because they're isolated for so long.
00:50:59,00:51:03,But the first crime on the list was from 1959.
00:51:03,00:51:06,And it was in a Soviet research station.
00:51:06,00:51:08,And it was between two scientists
00:51:08,00:51:11,"who got into a massive argument,"
00:51:11,00:51:13,then fight over a game of chess.
00:51:13,00:51:18,"And it just got so heated that the guy who lost,"
00:51:18,00:51:22,"became enraged, was said to have picked up an ice axe"
00:51:22,00:51:23,and attacked the guy.
00:51:23,00:51:25,"And it's really hard to tell, actually,"
00:51:25,00:51:27,"whether or not the wound was fatal,"
00:51:27,00:51:29,because there's two different stories
00:51:29,00:51:31,that have been presented as a result.
00:51:31,00:51:33,"Some say he survived, some say he didn't."
00:51:33,00:51:36,"But afterwards, chess games were apparently banned"
00:51:36,00:51:39,on all Soviets and Russian and tariff stations.
00:51:39,00:51:41,That really feels like not the main issue here.
00:51:41,00:51:46,Keep hold of your axes.
00:51:46,00:51:48,"Only for weapons and courage, chess, no."
00:51:48,00:51:51,"No, but I just like that."
00:51:51,00:51:53,I like the little communities that are out there
00:51:53,00:51:54,that you rarely hear about.
00:51:54,00:51:56,"In 2014, there was a scientist"
00:51:56,00:51:59,"who decided to launch his Tinder app while he was out there,"
00:51:59,00:52:02,and he matched with someone on Antarctica.
00:52:02,00:52:05,"Yeah, unfortunately, there were a helicopter ride away,"
00:52:05,00:52:07,"45 minutes, and they were leaving the next day."
00:52:07,00:52:08,And they just got an Uber.
00:52:08,00:52:16,"OK, that's it."
00:52:16,00:52:17,That is all of our facts.
