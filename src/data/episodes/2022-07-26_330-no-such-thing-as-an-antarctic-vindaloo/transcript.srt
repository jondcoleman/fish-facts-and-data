00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:17,020
 - Hello, and welcome to another episode

3
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:20,320
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

4
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,760
 from four undisclosed locations in the UK.

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,720
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here

6
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:29,400
 with James Harkin, Anna Tijinski, and Andrew Hunter Murray,

7
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,720
 and once again, we have gathered round the microphones

8
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:34,600
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

9
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,600
 and in no particular order, here we go.

10
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,720
 Starting with you, Anna.

11
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:43,040
 - My fact this week is that golden moulds shine

12
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,000
 in all the colors of the rainbow, and they'll never know it.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,560
 - Oh, that's sad. - Wow.

14
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,520
 - It's what a tragic fact to open with.

15
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,920
 - Is it because they're stupid?

16
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,960
 They don't even know their moulds.

17
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,360
 Is this the reason I said?

18
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,280
 - They don't know their moulds.

19
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,560
 They don't have a concept of color.

20
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,000
 They don't know what a rainbow is.

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,440
 There's a lot of reasons why, but...

22
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,160
 - It made me wonder if there were things

23
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,320
 that we don't know about, you know what I mean?

24
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,560
 It's like, and we're not smart enough to know what they are.

25
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,600
 So it could be that there are amazing colors

26
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,760
 that no one knows what they are that we give off, or smells.

27
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,040
 - Yeah, so dogs are doing a podcast saying,

28
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:26,200
 did you know humans smell exactly like, I don't know,

29
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,480
 rotting mushrooms, and they'll never know it.

30
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,240
 (laughing)

31
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,240
 - They've got the word dickhead written on their forehead,

32
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,680
 and they have no idea.

33
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,920
 (laughing)

34
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,960
 - Anyway, so back to the old moulds.

35
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,400
 I read about them in this fantastic article

36
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,480
 in the London Review of Books.

37
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,880
 It's by Catherine Rondle, and this is about the golden mould,

38
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,680
 and it's the first known iridescent mammal.

39
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,040
 So iridescent means it shimmers, like, you know,

40
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,880
 when you spill petrol, or in soap bubbles,

41
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,240
 or a pigeon's neck.

42
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,680
 So they have this amazing fur,

43
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,720
 which is a very specific structure,

44
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,280
 which reflects and reflects light

45
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,000
 in a way that causes this rainbow effect to happen,

46
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,440
 but they are totally blind.

47
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,840
 So usually iridescence in nature is for attracting mates,

48
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,120
 or maybe warning off a predator to suggest

49
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,280
 that you're poisonous.

50
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,000
 But this serves absolutely no purpose whatsoever.

51
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,920
 They're underground almost the whole time.

52
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,600
 They do have eyeballs, weirdly.

53
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,960
 We think the optic nerve isn't really functioning anymore.

54
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,560
 They have eyeballs, but their eyeballs

55
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,720
 are covered with skin and fur, so aren't doing that much good.

56
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,200
 So yeah, they'll never know.

57
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,280
 And we think that it's possibly to repel water,

58
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,520
 this particular sheen,

59
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,400
 or it could be to help them skid through holes

60
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,800
 when they're digging holes in the sand.

61
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,800
 They can go really quickly,

62
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,120
 because they have these amazing scale-like things on them.

63
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,000
 But the colour is just a byproduct of that, right?

64
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,440
 Yeah, it's one of those accidental bits of evolution,

65
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,200
 which is surprisingly rare, exactly,

66
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,600
 so that they've evolved to have this very specific structure

67
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,760
 to make them slippery.

68
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,520
 And it happens, so that's all rainbow as well.

69
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,000
 So they live in the deserts of southern Africa,

70
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,720
 and I've seen videos of them

71
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,800
 and how they travel through the sand.

72
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,120
 But what's really funny is, when you're watching the videos,

73
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,200
 is they swim through the sand very close to the surface,

74
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,480
 so you know where they're going.

75
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,560
 It's like someone trying to escape jail

76
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,480
 by digging a tunnel under the outside,

77
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,440
 but doing it right at the surface.

78
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,440
 So you always know where they are.

79
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,880
 But they're really cool the way they hunt,

80
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,760
 because I think we may have seen the same thing, Dan.

81
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,280
 They come out of the ground,

82
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,760
 and then they hunt, because they're blind,

83
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,920
 they hunt by listening to the animals passing nearby,

84
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,000
 and they're mostly eating little insects and things.

85
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,640
 And the thing is, they can hear a lot better through sand

86
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,800
 than they can through air,

87
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,800
 so they'll just completely plunge their head into a pile of sand

88
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,200
 just to check where their prey is,

89
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,960
 and then they'll get a hear of its footsteps

90
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,040
 and then they'll move that way.

91
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,240
 It's really funny.

92
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,960
 They have, in your ear you have three little bones,

93
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,640
 you might remember, like the hammer, the anvil, and the stirrup,

94
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,560
 and their hammer is massive.

95
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,920
 It's like Thor's hammer inside their head.

96
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,840
 It's 10,000 times bigger than our hammer in our head.

97
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,720
 And the way that this helps them

98
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,880
 is when there are vibrations that come into their head,

99
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:11,200
 it resonates and it makes the sound way, way louder,

100
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,640
 which means they can hear specific frequencies

101
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,880
 really, really well.

102
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,560
 And so they can hear the frequency,

103
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,080
 which is about the same as wind rustling through grass,

104
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:23,080
 and they can hear that specific frequency really, really well.

105
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,080
 So when they're going around,

106
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,560
 they can just listen to where these tufts of grass are,

107
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,480
 and why is that useful?

108
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,200
 Because that's where the insects live.

109
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,960
 So they just hear this specific sound of wind going through grass,

110
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,000
 they know exactly where it is,

111
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,440
 and they head straight for it and they get their termites.

112
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,760
 It's so clever.

113
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:41,280
 Not so useful in the deserts of Southern Africa.

114
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,760
 What do you mean?

115
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,200
 Well, it's sandy.

116
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:48,600
 Yes, but they have little tufts of grass in the desert, right?

117
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,840
 And in those tufts of grass, that's where the termites live.

118
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,240
 The termites don't live in the sand,

119
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,920
 they live underneath the grass where there's a little bit of soil.

120
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,960
 So that's exactly where they need to get to.

121
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,920
 There aren't many of them around, you're right, but...

122
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,720
 It would be pretty silly for them to evolve this incredible ability

123
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,400
 in a bone 10,000 times the size of ours,

124
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,440
 if they lived in a completely featureless environment.

125
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,040
 It would be stupid if they evolved

126
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:13,320
 so they could only hear ice cream vans, for instance.

127
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,200
 Because you don't get many ice cream vans there,

128
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,560
 but you do get tufts of grass.

129
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,240
 Yeah. God, I bet they'd kill for an ice cream van, though.

130
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,360
 That's true. There's one part of their body that's a lot smaller

131
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,800
 than the bone in their middle ear, which is massive.

132
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,880
 It's their penis.

133
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,480
 Oh, here we go.

134
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,720
 So this is the disadvantage of being a golden mole,

135
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,400
 and it's very important to them.

136
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,800
 So there is a hot and hot golden mole,

137
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,720
 that's one of the species' names,

138
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,000
 and females prefer males with bigger penises.

139
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,200
 And the reason for that is that they have no other means

140
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,960
 of differentiating between males.

141
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,880
 They're all underground, they're all blind,

142
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,160
 there's no way of telling who's an appropriate mate or not,

143
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,280
 apart from penis size.

144
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,720
 And the whole penis is approximately

145
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,800
 a millimetre and a half long.

146
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,600
 It's not huge.

147
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,960
 Proportionally, is that OK?

148
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,360
 It's still quite small. It's still tiny.

149
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,000
 Proportionally, it's still small.

150
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,200
 It is quite, yeah.

151
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,400
 And they don't even have a scrotum,

152
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,800
 so they can't be judged on that.

153
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,840
 So the whole penis is between 1.2 and 2.5 millimetres long,

154
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,760
 which is a tenth of an inch.

155
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,600
 I mean, just to be clear,

156
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,360
 we're not judging them on anything, are we, Andy?

157
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,760
 Well, speak for yourself, I am.

158
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,520
 Just, just, just.

159
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:26,480
 There's not many people Andy can judge on this particular metric,

160
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,320
 but the one millimetre penis golden mole.

161
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,520
 You betcha.

162
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,520
 Those idiots with their even smaller penises.

163
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,520
 Just.

164
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:42,440
 Oh, my God.

165
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,520
 I was reading the other day.

166
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,960
 In fact, this might have been something that was written by you, Andy.

167
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,520
 I'm not sure about scrotums.

168
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,480
 And about how all mammals used to live.

169
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,440
 Sorry, has Andy been publishing scrotum papers

170
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,520
 in the background of this podcast?

171
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,840
 It's about how they're much too big at scrotums.

172
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,680
 And they make perfectly reasonable penises.

173
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,920
 Looks small.

174
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:12,280
 Right, it was about how all mammals used to live.

175
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,400
 Used to be nocturnal and used to hunt at night.

176
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,120
 And the reason was,

177
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,200
 one of the reasons was it was much colder at night.

178
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,200
 And if you were in the daytime, it was too hot.

179
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,880
 And if you didn't have a scrotum,

180
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:29,840
 your testicles would be inside your body and they get too hot.

181
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,320
 And so one of the things that allowed mammals to live during the day

182
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,120
 was scrotums, because then the testicles hung outside,

183
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,000
 which is a bit cooler,

184
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,360
 which meant they could spend time in the sunshine.

185
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,280
 Oh, wow.

186
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:45,160
 So without scrotums, we'd all be living at night.

187
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,360
 That's very cool.

188
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,480
 Yeah, great theory.

189
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,800
 Was that one of your papers, Andy?

190
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,720
 You don't seem to have a very good memory of it, of course.

191
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,800
 I write, to be honest,

192
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,720
 I write so many papers about the scrotum,

193
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,920
 but it's hard to differentiate them.

194
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,280
 And do they even like mating, though?

195
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,920
 Because they're super anti-social.

196
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,360
 In fact, all mammals are really anti-social, aren't they?

197
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,400
 But golden moles don't hang out together at all, massive loners.

198
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,160
 And I think they're quite bad parents.

199
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,320
 Again, in common with normal moles,

200
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,400
 which after when their kids are just a couple of weeks old,

201
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,680
 I think they literally take them in the burrow,

202
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,280
 they shove them up to the top and then they seal the entrance.

203
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,880
 So their baby is just then stranded and they've got a bugger off.

204
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,960
 You could say the golden moles,

205
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,720
 they are the massive loners with the tiny boners.

206
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,640
 That's how you can remember what they are.

207
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,040
 Yeah, that's a tagline.

208
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,000
 That's what you're chanting as you go through the desert,

209
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,960
 bullying them, isn't it?

210
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:40,920
 Yeah, moles like actual moles.

211
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,360
 You're right, they're really, they are loners.

212
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,520
 They don't like to go anywhere near each other.

213
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,320
 And each animal has a territory

214
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,160
 which is about the size of a football pitch.

215
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:49,800
 Whoa.

216
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,200
 That's a lot, isn't it?

217
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,640
 For each, for one mole.

218
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,800
 That's greedy.

219
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,800
 That's a lot of real estate.

220
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,600
 That's insane.

221
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,920
 We should say, yeah, the golden mole is extremely mole-like.

222
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,120
 And I think it should be a mole

223
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,920
 because it does everything that moles do.

224
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,760
 But it's actually not an official mole.

225
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,720
 It's miles away from it on the taxonomic tree

226
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,640
 and they're more closely related to elephants

227
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,760
 than they are to moles.

228
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:14,120
 And in fact, according to the Wikipedia page,

229
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,200
 it's at the moment classified as a chrysochloridite,

230
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,720
 but that's under review.

231
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,120
 So we're kind of unclear where we put them on the evolutionary tree.

232
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:21,920
 What does that mean?

233
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,480
 It just means that they're classified as something.

234
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,640
 But we're not really sure where they are.

235
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,200
 And, you know, we might move them to another bit of the tree.

236
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,440
 The Wikipedia page on them is really good.

237
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,280
 I don't know who wrote it, but some real expert.

238
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,040
 I guess you would have to be an expert on the golden mole

239
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:36,680
 to write about it.

240
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,600
 Yeah, I can.

241
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,680
 No, but some of, you know, it's, I just shout out to Wikipedia

242
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,600
 because it's very clearly written and comprehensive.

243
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,720
 It also has this fact, which I loved.

244
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,440
 They have only one toe on each forefoot,

245
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,720
 which has evolved into the shape of a pickaxe.

246
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,480
 And all the other toes on their front feet

247
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,600
 have kind of withered away.

248
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,280
 So they are so efficient at digging through the sand

249
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,120
 that they need to get through.

250
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,560
 Oh, cool. Yeah.

251
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,680
 And that actually is a bit different to moles, isn't it?

252
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,720
 Because moles have those kind of big paddles on their feet

253
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,920
 where they push through the sand.

254
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,840
 But the golden moles, because they swim more like a shark,

255
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,640
 they've got to be slicker.

256
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:15,120
 Yeah, they're sometimes known as the shark of the dunes, aren't they?

257
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,040
 Are they? Yeah.

258
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,920
 And I think that's because, like Dan says,

259
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,880
 they're so close to the surface.

260
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,320
 They've probably got one of their pickaxes sticking up.

261
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,280
 So you can, well, maybe even though one millimeter penis sticking up,

262
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,320
 out of the sand, so you can see it.

263
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,080
 That's when we're doing backstroke.

264
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,400
 I just got one thing on moles.

265
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:36,120
 In 1519, a community in Italy launched a massive court case

266
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:40,240
 against moles on the grounds that they were damaging crops.

267
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,040
 And you can read the full sort of transcript

268
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,440
 of what the attorney's arguments were against and for the moles.

269
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,760
 And so the attorney for the defense of the moles,

270
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,200
 the moles couldn't come to court.

271
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,880
 So the attorney spoke for them in absentia,

272
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,480
 said they confer all these benefits.

273
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,320
 So they destroy nocturnal insects, for instance.

274
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,720
 And he eventually argued successfully

275
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,000
 that if they are sentenced to be exiled,

276
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,720
 they should be found a suitable place of abode

277
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,080
 and have safe conduct on the way there

278
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,800
 to secure them from harm from cats and dogs, et cetera.

279
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,160
 And the judge is there, and you can read his ruling,

280
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:16,320
 where he did in fact agree the moles were to be exiled,

281
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,000
 but they were given safe conduct.

282
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,360
 And any pregnant mole or mole with young children

283
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:25,360
 had an extra 14 days to leave the community.

284
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,640
 There's no evidence as to how this was actually enforced afterwards.

285
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,640
 - Quite often what happened with those kind of things

286
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:35,960
 is they would say, okay, well, let's say for instance rats.

287
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,040
 There are rats here, we need to get rid of them.

288
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,480
 So we're gonna make a law to say they have to go within 14 days.

289
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,600
 And then when they haven't got in 14 days, they go,

290
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,760
 okay, well, we gave you a chance.

291
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,080
 We're now gonna exterminate you.

292
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,840
 - There's like killing God's creatures, isn't it?

293
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,560
 You have to give, 'cause you shouldn't be destroying

294
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:58,000
 too much of God's creation without having legal authority to do it.

295
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 Mole prison would be amazing though.

296
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,240
 That would be a really fun thing to film,

297
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,960
 because obviously they'd all just tunnel away immediately.

298
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,480
 - The Great Escape would be a much longer film.

299
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:15,320
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that's my fact.

300
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:19,600
 My fact this week is that Mozart and Beethoven both compose music

301
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,520
 for an instrument made entirely of glass.

302
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:26,600
 It was invented by Benjamin Franklin.

303
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:30,840
 Benjamin Franklin invented what was an incredible instrument,

304
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,880
 hugely popular in the 1700s,

305
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,640
 and so massive that it was used by some

306
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,080
 of the biggest composers of the day.

307
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,600
 I had no idea there was a connection between Franklin

308
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,760
 and say Mozart and Beethoven.

309
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,760
 That's like, you know, hearing.

310
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,640
 - Come on, Franklin's connected to everyone.

311
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,960
 He was the Giles Brandrith officer.

312
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:52,000
 I mean, he knew everyone and he did everything.

313
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,920
 - So Dan, why don't you tell us about this glass instrument?

314
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,560
 Was it like a violin made of glass

315
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,600
 or a drum made of glass?

316
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,240
 That wouldn't work.

317
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,800
 - Yeah, so it's called an armonica,

318
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,520
 and effectively it's kind of like a glass piano.

319
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:10,160
 So Franklin in the 1700s was seeing a lot of people play glass bowls

320
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,480
 that are tuned to notes, which you still see a lot of people doing.

321
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,000
 You know that thing with the wine glass?

322
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,920
 If you lick your finger and you run it over the lid and it's...

323
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,720
 - Yeah, basically when the conversation dries up enough

324
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,280
 in a wedding, everyone starts doing that.

325
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,320
 - Yes, exactly.

326
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,720
 And so he thought this is really beautiful music

327
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,480
 and you can see people making tunes out of it.

328
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,240
 The problem is, is that if you were going to play that at a gig,

329
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,200
 you have to line up 50 glasses.

330
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,520
 It's not practical because you could smash one

331
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,360
 and suddenly that's your C note gone.

332
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,240
 So what he did was he created an instrument

333
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,320
 whereby he had a glassblower in London

334
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,520
 turn it into effectively like a piano that you play.

335
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,960
 - And just to say when you play it, it works by a foot pedal, right?

336
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,720
 So he made it horizontal.

337
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,800
 So usually you'd have the glasses standing up vertically,

338
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,560
 so you have to hold them down with one hand

339
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,360
 and we've all done it at dinner parties.

340
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,920
 But he put them horizontally and attached them more than a row

341
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,520
 and then you spun them round constantly with a foot pedal.

342
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,040
 So I think you just had to sort of...

343
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,680
 If you touched it with your hands, it would be constantly spinning.

344
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,800
 But then I can't work out where you put the jar of water.

345
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,880
 - I must watch a video of it

346
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,000
 because you've got to keep moistening your hands to keep it working.

347
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,160
 So presumably you have to dip it like a finger ball.

348
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,160
 - Yeah, you have to do that.

349
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,800
 Although quite soon afterwards,

350
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,520
 there was a new version that was made like an improvement

351
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:26,360
 where there was a little trough of water underneath the glasses.

352
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,640
 So when they span, they kind of got moistened by themselves,

353
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,600
 which is quite clever.

354
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,440
 - That's crafty.

355
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,800
 - It went from being a hugely popular instrument

356
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,480
 to suddenly a lot of controversy

357
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,360
 because people started noticing a few things about it

358
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,120
 and reporting that it was sending people mad.

359
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,640
 - Oh yeah, that's right.

360
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:48,240
 - Yeah, and that in some cases,

361
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,680
 a few deaths were supposedly off the back of it.

362
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,560
 And suddenly books were publishing

363
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,360
 that this was a dangerous instrument.

364
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,280
 And then suddenly they were saying

365
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,280
 it was the most dangerous instrument in the world.

366
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,840
 And its reputation... - It's really unfair.

367
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,120
 - Yeah, it's extraordinary.

368
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:05,400
 It basically, fake news took it down as an instrument.

369
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,960
 And there was a lot of theory that possibly there's a bit of truth

370
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,720
 to why people were sent mad,

371
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,600
 which was off the back of the instrument itself

372
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,080
 and licking your fingers on an instrument all the time.

373
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:19,480
 - So the theory was that there were crystal balls

374
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,520
 and they were on this harmonica spindle.

375
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,840
 And they contain some lead.

376
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:28,000
 And some people thought maybe the lead from the balls,

377
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,880
 'cause you can play with both hands.

378
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,120
 If you haven't broad enough span,

379
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,760
 you can play 10 notes at the same time.

380
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,600
 It's quite impressive.

381
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:38,600
 And people thought you can maybe absorb lead into your fingers

382
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,200
 if that kills you, blah, blah, blah, lead poisoning.

383
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,200
 However, it has also been pointed out

384
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,200
 that this is unbelievably unlikely.

385
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,840
 Because at the time that the harmonica was being played,

386
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,760
 doctors widely prescribed massive doses of lead

387
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,080
 for various ailments.

388
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,960
 Food was preserved with lead oxide.

389
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,400
 Food was cooked in lead pots.

390
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,680
 People drank from lead vessels.

391
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:59,320
 Like the main lead risk in the 18th century

392
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,400
 was not the glass harmonica.

393
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:05,200
 (all laughing)

394
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,560
 - I think it's just 'cause it was spooky.

395
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,520
 - It makes a very ethereal noise.

396
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:13,520
 And also it was used by podcast favourite Franz Mesmer,

397
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,360
 wasn't it? - Yes.

398
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,560
 - So he used to go around mesmerizing people.

399
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,840
 We've talked about him before, hypnotizing people.

400
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,480
 And he used the harmonica

401
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,480
 because it does make this very ghostly noise.

402
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,360
 And so it was associated with hypnotizing ladies.

403
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,640
 It's always ladies.

404
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:31,440
 It's just all part of the constant 19th century panic

405
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,520
 that anything women did that might be slightly challenging

406
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,560
 or might slightly encroach on the world of men

407
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,280
 must send them mad and cause them to faint

408
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,000
 so they should be banned from doing it.

409
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,960
 - But actually all the best players of this instrument

410
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,720
 were women, right?

411
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,880
 So the first person to publish a book about it

412
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,040
 was called Anne Ford.

413
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,040
 She published it in 1761.

414
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,080
 She was married to a friend of Gainsborough

415
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,000
 who was called Philip Thickness,

416
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,560
 which is quite a good name.

417
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,000
 And she was the person who actually came up

418
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,560
 with the idea of turning the glasses

419
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,600
 into an actual instrument.

420
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,760
 Whether Franklin took the idea from her and did it

421
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,440
 or whether they came up with independently, I don't know.

422
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,440
 But there was also someone called Marianne Davis

423
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,720
 who was the most famous player,

424
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,480
 probably in the whole of Europe.

425
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,680
 And she went around Europe and taught it.

426
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:18,880
 And like Mozart met her and Mesmer, I think,

427
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,440
 watched her play and then decided

428
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,640
 to bring it into his mesmerization and stuff.

429
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,520
 So she was super famous.

430
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,240
 - Yeah, there was a double Marianne.

431
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,200
 It was a Marianne sandwich,

432
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,400
 although not with anything in the middle

433
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,640
 'cause she was the one who popularized it in Europe.

434
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,200
 And then maybe the best player of ever

435
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,400
 was this German lady called Marianne Kirchgesner.

436
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,040
 And Mozart towards the end of his life

437
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:42,480
 wrote lots of stuff specifically for her on the Armonica.

438
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,560
 And actually when he died,

439
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,080
 he was in the middle of writing her another piece.

440
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,440
 And she was very famous.

441
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,600
 She was another jazz brand.

442
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,360
 She sort of knew everyone like Goethe and Haydn.

443
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,080
 But maybe there was some truth

444
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,240
 to the Armonica cursing people

445
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,360
 because she had sort of a nervous breakdown.

446
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,600
 - Yeah, in fact, all of the people who played it

447
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,160
 in the 18th century, all dead.

448
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,120
 That was such a good fight.

449
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,840
 - Marianne Kirchgesner was assaulted

450
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,400
 by Napoleon's soldiers in 1806.

451
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,960
 And she never really recovered from that.

452
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,800
 So that was more the cause of her nervous breakdown,

453
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,560
 I think, rather than the instrument.

454
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:21,560
 - Yeah, there's a great line about it from 1786.

455
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,520
 This is a German player called Karl Röhlig.

456
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,440
 He said that the Armonica could make women faint,

457
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,520
 send a dog into convulsions,

458
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,920
 make a sleeping girl wake screaming

459
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,800
 through a cord of the diminished seventh

460
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,560
 and even cause the death of one very young.

461
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,560
 And that was the guy who played it for a living.

462
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,760
 - Yeah. - Like a recommendation.

463
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,120
 - I think someone actually did die, didn't they?

464
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,560
 At the time that someone was playing a glass Armonica

465
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,080
 and it was like a cause and effect thing.

466
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,120
 Everyone was like, oh my God,

467
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,000
 it must have been glass Armonica that caused it.

468
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,080
 And that was like the start of the big sort of banning it.

469
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,760
 They banned it in churches and stuff like that.

470
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,000
 Didn't they in Germany?

471
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,640
 - So Dan, you mentioned that Franklin picked up

472
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,200
 this glass Armonica idea

473
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,240
 by watching people play musical wine glasses.

474
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,080
 And he actually did that in Britain.

475
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,920
 So in Britain and Ireland,

476
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,720
 this was an extremely popular musical instrument

477
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,640
 before Franklin made it vaguely acceptable

478
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,720
 to the rest of the world.

479
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,840
 There would be concert halls that filled out with people

480
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,840
 just spinning their fingers around wine glasses.

481
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,440
 And the most famous player was this amazing guy

482
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,040
 called Richard Puckridge or Puckridge.

483
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,800
 You know, there are various spellings.

484
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,960
 But have you guys read about him?

485
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,520
 He's amazing. - He's amazing.

486
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,360
 I love him.

487
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,000
 He's the best. - He's super fun.

488
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,320
 So he was a self proclaimed inventor of musical glasses.

489
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:37,040
 He spent, he had all sorts of crazy ideas

490
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,320
 for how to make us fortune.

491
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,640
 So he designed wings for human flight.

492
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,080
 Don't think they took off.

493
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,360
 He said, he had this idea.

494
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,280
 He wrote this paper about how you could regain youth

495
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,880
 by injecting yourself with the blood of young maids.

496
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,760
 And so he recommended blood transfusions

497
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:55,720
 between young maids and anyone over 60.

498
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,560
 - Just on that.

499
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,560
 So when he came up with that idea,

500
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:01,000
 people took him quite seriously, some people.

501
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,240
 And there was a big kind of hoo-ha

502
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,880
 in the burial industry and the funeral industry.

503
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,720
 Cause they were like, well,

504
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,200
 if people are going to live forever,

505
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,320
 then what are we going to do for a living?

506
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,320
 And so he supposedly agreed that everyone

507
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,840
 who was having this treatment would sign a contract

508
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,720
 that as soon as they reached 999 years old,

509
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,360
 they would have to pay a funeral company

510
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,800
 for the price of a burial.

511
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,160
 - Wow. - Oh my God.

512
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,960
 - I think they discussed that in parliament, didn't they?

513
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,040
 That was their token nod to what?

514
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:28,880
 His ridiculous idea.

515
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,000
 - It's such a funny idea.

516
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,360
 But what do the funeral people do for the first 900 years?

517
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,920
 They're looking at that money.

518
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,000
 It's so weird.

519
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 - I think they discussed that in parliament, didn't they?

520
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,200
 That was their token nod to what his ridiculous idea.

521
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,360
 I liked, he had an account once of doing a concert

522
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,760
 where three hours before the performance,

523
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,920
 he was going to do a concert on his glasses,

524
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:49,920
 which was quite fragile.

525
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,720
 And three hours before the performance,

526
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,160
 a large, unmanly pig entered the room

527
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,120
 and smashed the whole machine to pieces.

528
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,480
 - That's an excuse for someone who hasn't done the homework,

529
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,360
 hasn't learned the piece that they're going to need to play.

530
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,520
 They have a brilliant brainwave, they think, get me a pig.

531
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,520
 - Sorry, a pig at my instrument.

532
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,400
 It's like, there was another thing I saw.

533
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,080
 It was a newspaper article.

534
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,120
 He took out an advert to apologize

535
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,200
 because he'd done a concert that everyone thought was terrible.

536
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,960
 And the advert said, "Mr. Potkrich takes this opportunity

537
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,320
 "to apologize to the public for their disappointment.

538
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,520
 "He added a glass too much to his instrument."

539
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,760
 And I can't tell whether that means he put one glass in there

540
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,600
 and it meant all his notes were off,

541
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,920
 or whether it's a euphemism for, "I got really pissed

542
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,400
 "and I couldn't do the concert."

543
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,960
 It sounds like it doesn't it? - I think it's that, yeah.

544
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,440
 - That's true. - That's so good.

545
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:39,840
 Another band instrument during the early 1900s

546
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,760
 was the saxophone, Nazi Germany bandit.

547
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,200
 They saw it as a symbol of jazz.

548
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,840
 So it wasn't that it was turning you

549
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:50,320
 into a different mental state.

550
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,520
 It was purely that they didn't like it at all.

551
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:57,200
 But church's bandit as well in the early 1900s,

552
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,640
 the Vatican bandit in 1914.

553
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,160
 And I just love, I've never thought of a saxophone

554
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,720
 being in the Vatican church. - No.

555
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,680
 - Sort of busting out a solo.

556
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:09,120
 What an image, but yeah, they banned it.

557
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,560
 So maybe we'll never get to see it.

558
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:15,280
 Obviously there was the thought that it suggested

559
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,360
 and promoted sexual dancing.

560
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,800
 So that was a thing that they wanted to avoid as well.

561
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,920
 - That is like a church sort of banning gangster rap

562
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,160
 in churches though, isn't it?

563
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,480
 It's like people going,

564
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,480
 "We weren't going to do this anyway, guys.

565
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,320
 Don't worry about it."

566
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:32,200
 - It's like me as a 14-year-old banning supermodel

567
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,320
 from my birthday party.

568
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,720
 There was never any prospect.

569
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:41,000
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

570
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,240
 and that is Andy.

571
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:46,640
 - My fact is that envelopes used to be made of clay.

572
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,240
 - Wow, so...

573
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,520
 - That must have been a hard job

574
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:53,600
 being a postman in those days, right?

575
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,720
 - Yeah, so this was...

576
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,920
 We're used to envelopes being made of paper, obviously.

577
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,800
 What we think of as the classic material for them,

578
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,840
 but it's not, it's not the original.

579
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:06,600
 So this is in Babylonian era times,

580
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,440
 in 2000 BC, give or take,

581
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,560
 what you would do if you were writing a message to someone,

582
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:14,600
 you would write a message on a clay tablet,

583
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,880
 and that would dry,

584
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,800
 and then that would be the thing that you were sending,

585
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,800
 but you wouldn't send that just open

586
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,880
 because anyone could read it.

587
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,280
 So you needed an envelope,

588
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,440
 and to make that, you would put more wet clay

589
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,960
 over the tablet, press the ends together to seal it,

590
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,760
 and then you put the whole thing in a kiln, bake it,

591
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,760
 and then you send that massive baked package of clay,

592
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:37,080
 and the recipient has to smash it open,

593
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:40,560
 the outer envelope, to receive the tablet

594
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,280
 that's on the inside, and that's what you do.

595
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:45,360
 - That's a pretty exciting way of opening a letter, isn't it?

596
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,080
 Smashing it with a hammer. - It is.

597
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:47,920
 - Yeah.

598
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:51,800
 - I always think sometimes I rip the end off an envelope

599
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,920
 to get the inside rather than opening it up with the seal,

600
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,840
 and I always think I'm pretty cool when I do that,

601
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,840
 but this is even better.

602
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,680
 - Just imagine this is the next level, yeah?

603
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,760
 Imagine what fun you would have had

604
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,840
 if they'd been in Babylonia.

605
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,600
 (laughing)

606
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,000
 - For people's birthdays must have been interesting,

607
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,080
 'cause I mean, you just spent about six hours

608
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,640
 beasing away at clay.

609
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:14,920
 - There really aren't very many samples

610
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,760
 of these things around,

611
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,960
 'cause obviously they were designed to be smashed on delivery.

612
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,920
 There are some, thank goodness, but yeah.

613
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,200
 - Yeah, because Pierce Fletcher,

614
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,320
 the producer of QI's got one.

615
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,160
 - Has he?

616
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,960
 - Yeah, he bought one when he was in,

617
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,400
 I think he was in Iraq or something many, many years ago,

618
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,040
 but he bought one.

619
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,800
 It's dated to 2028 BC.

620
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,520
 He knows when it's dated to,

621
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,760
 and he says you can see the thumbprint

622
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,920
 left of the person who put it in the kiln

623
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,680
 on the thing, which gives it some kind of human touch,

624
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,680
 but he says that it was an invoice

625
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:47,200
 for a consignment of animal fodder,

626
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,880
 which is not exactly the most exciting thing,

627
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,240
 'cause none of us can read Cuneiform,

628
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,640
 which is what it was written in, right?

629
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,600
 So he might as well have said it was a love letter

630
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,880
 to someone or something, but.

631
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,400
 (laughing)

632
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,840
 - They very rarely were, they weren't they?

633
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,880
 It was all accounting.

634
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,400
 I'm glad you clarified why he has it,

635
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,440
 'cause genuinely I thought that was just a dig

636
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,600
 at Pierce Fletcher's age,

637
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,360
 'cause he is a middle-aged man.

638
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,080
 I just thought you were claiming that's how he--

639
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,040
 - He got it for his 21st birthday.

640
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,640
 He's got a few of them, yeah.

641
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,200
 (laughing)

642
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,640
 - Didn't it used to be the case as well

643
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,800
 that a lot of these, and it was Sumerian

644
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,200
 and Babylonian, wasn't it?

645
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,360
 And they'd have the same stuff written on the outside

646
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,680
 as on the inside.

647
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:29,000
 So a lot of the time they were used

648
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,920
 as protection against fraud.

649
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,040
 And so these are the very oldest ones.

650
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,960
 Basically, you'd have a record of a transaction,

651
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,920
 like I've sold you this many bumblebees

652
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:42,000
 for this many dinars, and you put that in your clay,

653
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,120
 and then you sealed it up,

654
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,840
 and then you wrote exactly the same thing on the envelope.

655
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,840
 And the way it worked was, when the recipient got it,

656
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,680
 if there was a dispute over whether the envelope

657
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:53,120
 had been tampered with, then you smashed it open

658
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,440
 to check the inside.

659
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,560
 - Oh, okay.

660
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,640
 - It was to make sure they were the same inside and out,

661
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,000
 'cause otherwise you could melt the clay, soften it,

662
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:00,840
 and then change--

663
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,400
 - Oh, put an extra zero on.

664
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,560
 I wanted this many dinars, very crap.

665
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,200
 - Or this many bees. - Exactly.

666
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,480
 - Yeah, it's very open to dispute.

667
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,480
 You get a lot of envelopes that you can see

668
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:15,040
 in like postage museums that have got holes punched in them,

669
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,960
 and that's because they used to fumigate them

670
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,880
 when there were pandemics

671
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,920
 and when there were diseases going around.

672
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:23,880
 So like, for instance, when there was yellow fever around,

673
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,320
 people would put little holes in,

674
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:28,520
 and they would fire like formaldehyde gas or smoke

675
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,920
 or whatever to try and kill the pathogens.

676
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:35,520
 And if you send a letter to any zip code in America

677
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:39,080
 that begins 202, 203, 204, or 205,

678
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:43,040
 then it will be irradiated before it gets there.

679
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:46,440
 And that's because they are the zip codes of Washington, DC,

680
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,120
 around the federal agencies,

681
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,040
 and they go to a special place

682
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,560
 where they're put on a conveyor belt

683
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,280
 and they're fired radiation at them,

684
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:56,600
 which will kill any bacteria, any viruses, anthrax,

685
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,800
 all that kind of stuff.

686
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,760
 Then they're aired out and then they're sent.

687
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,560
 So if you're Donald Trump and you get a letter,

688
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:05,120
 it's gonna be quite faded and crispy

689
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,200
 and a little bit yellow.

690
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,800
 That's all his mail is gonna be a little bit like that

691
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,360
 because it's gone through this process.

692
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,440
 Yeah, it's so cool.

693
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,640
 And that was a response, wasn't it, to the anthrax spores

694
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,840
 that they were put in the post in Washington in about 2001.

695
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,880
 And five people died,

696
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,320
 and there were lots of facilities contaminated,

697
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:24,080
 so this is kind of their way of dealing with that.

698
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,120
 Apparently, people who work at the Royal Mail say,

699
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,600
 one of the serious problems they have,

700
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,840
 the sorters who have to sort through the envelopes,

701
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:33,160
 is that people don't seal their envelopes.

702
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,840
 And there's lots of complaining about this online,

703
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:35,680
 and they say it's very annoying

704
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,920
 because often you have to match a card with its envelope

705
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,960
 and it's hard to do.

706
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,440
 I imagine there are lots of sort of missent things

707
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,280
 where the wrong card's been put in the wrong envelope.

708
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,600
 And they don't know why people do it,

709
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:49,480
 but there's speculation that it's based on the old paper rate.

710
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:52,960
 So this was something that was abolished in 1969,

711
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,600
 but I believe Piers Fletcher formerly mentioned

712
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,520
 "Centre of Cuneiform Tablets" does remember it.

713
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,480
 He's posted about this on the forums before.

714
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,760
 And this was, if you wanted to send printed matter,

715
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,520
 like newspapers or pamphlets, it was just a hate me.

716
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,120
 So it was a reduced price.

717
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,040
 But you had to send it an unsealed envelope,

718
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,840
 and then the postman would open the envelope,

719
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,320
 check that you hadn't put anything

720
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,880
 other than a newspaper in there,

721
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,160
 and then seal the envelope up after that.

722
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,320
 And if you send a sealed envelope,

723
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,560
 then you'd have to pay extra.

724
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,680
 So there's the idea that there are still some people out there

725
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,680
 who think that maybe you'll only have to pay a hate me

726
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:27,000
 if you leave the envelope unsealed.

727
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,200
 But yeah, cheaper to not.

728
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,760
 - No, who is still paying a hate penny for their stamps?

729
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:33,200
 Other than Piers Fletcher, producer of QI,

730
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,200
 who is doing that?

731
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,440
 - It's hard to say.

732
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:41,960
 - On the kind of unexpected antiquity of things,

733
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,920
 you know the window envelope?

734
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:47,320
 And that's the one where you've got a little plastic window

735
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,440
 so you can double up.

736
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,920
 You don't need to write the address on the envelope

737
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,640
 because it's part of the letter that you're being sent.

738
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,400
 - You're not going to tell us they did that

739
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,120
 with Cuneiform Tablets, are you?

740
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,040
 - No.

741
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,920
 When do you think that was invented?

742
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,600
 - Well, I would say in the '50s.

743
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,040
 - Thanks, James. Good guess.

744
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,280
 - The '90s.

745
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,320
 - '90s? Brilliant.

746
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,760
 Even better guess, for my purposes, Anna.

747
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:10,160
 - I think I've got window envelopes at my house

748
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,880
 from before the '90s.

749
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:15,280
 I feel like I'd be cheated because I also researched this.

750
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,120
 - Okay, okay.

751
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,840
 Well, hey, Anna, who was writing window envelopes to you

752
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,240
 when you were two years old and you were needed?

753
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:24,120
 - I was a very professional toddler.

754
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:27,920
 - They were designed, first designed in 1901

755
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,440
 and patented in 1902.

756
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,160
 They're older than powered flight,

757
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,000
 which I find very weird.

758
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,080
 - You find it impressive that we had the technology

759
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,520
 that windowed envelopes before powered flight.

760
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,720
 - I've got to say, Andy,

761
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,840
 do you think the Wright brothers,

762
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,920
 when they first flew at Kitty Hawk,

763
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:45,240
 everyone went, "Yeah, but it's not a windowed envelope."

764
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,560
 Who is it?

765
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,200
 Come on, mate.

766
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,400
 There is a guy in Sweden who's scared of them.

767
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:53,200
 He has a phobia of window envelopes.

768
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,040
 - Really?

769
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,720
 - Yeah, he was in court a few years ago.

770
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,800
 Basically, he'd been driving his scooter unregistered

771
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,240
 and without a license.

772
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,480
 And so they sent him letters saying,

773
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,360
 "You need to pay a fine, old ever."

774
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:09,680
 But he says he had a phobia of window envelopes.

775
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:12,000
 And so he never opened any of them.

776
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,920
 And the court partially ruled in his favor,

777
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:17,000
 saying he didn't know what was inside them.

778
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,800
 And he just didn't like these official things.

779
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,360
 He thought it might be something really bad.

780
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,200
 - He did get all the money together for the fine,

781
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,440
 but then this massive pig came into the room.

782
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,760
 - Hey, all the money.

783
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,960
 (laughing)

784
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,120
 - So speaking of eating,

785
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,080
 you used to be able to eat the windowed envelopes,

786
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:33,920
 didn't you?

787
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:34,760
 - What?

788
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:38,360
 - First, in the original 1902 patent,

789
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,760
 just the window bit was made of rice paper.

790
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,280
 - Yeah, don't eat the whole envelope.

791
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,160
 - Don't eat the whole envelope, absolutely not.

792
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,640
 But that would solve a lot of problems today

793
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,840
 'cause they really irritate me

794
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,560
 'cause they're not recyclable, aren't they?

795
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,400
 'Cause you can't recycle.

796
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,960
 - No, they are recyclable.

797
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,800
 No, this is one of the big, modern myths of society.

798
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,160
 - It's the biggest. - Oh, God.

799
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,800
 (laughing)

800
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,840
 - Anna, what have you done?

801
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,480
 You've destroyed literally millions of windowed envelopes.

802
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,520
 - I know because you've been getting these envelopes

803
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,880
 since you were two years old.

804
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,520
 (laughing)

805
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,360
 - They are recyclable.

806
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,520
 - I always ate the window.

807
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,560
 (laughing)

808
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:12,040
 - Rice paper is not see-through, I don't think.

809
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,840
 It's almost see-through, but it's not really see-through.

810
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,280
 - So I think they weren't as good probably

811
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,640
 in the other days, the original patent.

812
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:20,280
 It was quite translucent rather than transparent.

813
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,800
 - Also, if it gets wet, it just disintegrates.

814
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,800
 - Another flaw.

815
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,520
 (laughing)

816
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,800
 - Well, then you can see the address better.

817
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,360
 So that's actually quite useful.

818
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,200
 (laughing)

819
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,640
 - Do you know you used to be able to buy stamps

820
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,840
 from post boxes?

821
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:34,680
 - Wow.

822
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,520
 - This is another era

823
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,840
 that producer of QI Pierce Fletcher might remember.

824
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:42,440
 This was in the 1930s and again, quite a short live.

825
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,440
 - He does actually listen to these podcasts.

826
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,280
 Can I just say?

827
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,000
 - I know he does.

828
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 - He's going to be so excited.

829
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,840
 James is going to talk about my Babylonian cuneiform.

830
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:51,880
 Come round, family.

831
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,360
 Come round.

832
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,200
 Everyone sit down.

833
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,280
 - Come round, grandchildren.

834
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,200
 Great, grandchildren.

835
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,360
 Great, great, grandchildren.

836
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,440
 Great, great, great grandchildren.

837
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,880
 (laughing)

838
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,360
 Well, as you'll remember in the 1930s,

839
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,280
 post boxes were stamp vending machines.

840
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:09,080
 And if they had the word stamp engraved on them,

841
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,480
 you could put a penny in

842
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,880
 and you automatically got two stamps out of it.

843
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,280
 But they actually were abolished

844
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,800
 because they kept on just eating people's pennies

845
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,960
 and not dispensing the stamps.

846
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,320
 Nice idea though.

847
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,640
 - Very nice. - Very cool idea.

848
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:25,120
 Can I tell you my favorite envelope story from 2020?

849
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:25,960
 - Yep. - Of course.

850
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:26,960
 - We've all got one.

851
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,680
 - Yep, so this was in Ohio.

852
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:33,800
 A man called Dan Kane went to the post office

853
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,720
 to pick up a letter he was expecting

854
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,960
 from the College Avenue student loan company.

855
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,520
 His daughter's tuition fee,

856
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,880
 it was a loan repayment scheme that he was doing.

857
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,160
 So he went to pick up the letter

858
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,400
 and when he got there,

859
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:49,000
 he was told that there wasn't one letter for him.

860
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,280
 But due to an administrative error,

861
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:54,240
 the college had sent him not one,

862
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,720
 but 55,000 letters of the exact same letter.

863
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,640
 - Wow.

864
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,920
 - There were 79 bins of a mail

865
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:05,080
 that contained roughly 700 copies

866
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:07,800
 of the exact same letter addressed to him

867
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,160
 and he had to bring them home.

868
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,520
 He had to take them home with him.

869
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,720
 - No. - Yeah.

870
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,920
 And when he got home, he opened it up

871
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:17,320
 to actually get the amount

872
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:19,000
 'cause he needed to pay back this loan

873
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,480
 and worked out that the company had accidentally

874
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,720
 used the wrong interest rate

875
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,320
 and they calculated the payment wrong.

876
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,240
 So they were gonna have to send him another letter

877
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,280
 with the right amount.

878
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,640
 - That's amazing.

879
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,960
 - Yeah, and he worked out that roughly,

880
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,120
 it would have cost them about,

881
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,080
 or if someone worked out,

882
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,600
 it would have cost them 11,000 American dollars

883
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,520
 to have posted that mail. - Although,

884
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,880
 imagine how much worse that would have been

885
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,200
 in the days of play envelope.

886
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:45,920
 - Do you wanna know what my favorite story

887
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,920
 from 2015 about envelopes is?

888
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,240
 - Yes. - Oh yeah, we all got one.

889
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,960
 - I sort of rather have your 2020 one if I'm okay.

890
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,040
 - I'm afraid I don't have one.

891
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:57,520
 In 2015, there was a guy in Gloucestershire

892
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:00,240
 who got a Christmas card that just said,

893
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,040
 "England on the envelope."

894
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,280
 He was walking down the road

895
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,520
 and the postman said to him,

896
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,240
 "I don't suppose you're expecting anything

897
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:10,600
 "from Germany, are you?"

898
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:13,400
 And he said, "Well, I've got a few friends in Germany."

899
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,920
 And he said, "Well, do you wanna have a look at this?

900
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,080
 "It just says England on it."

901
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,320
 And he looked and on the back,

902
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,760
 it was the address of his friends in Germany

903
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,560
 and he opened it up and it was a Christmas card

904
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,200
 from his friends in Germany.

905
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,280
 - What? - Wow.

906
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,080
 - And he said, "How did you know it was for me?"

907
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,800
 And the postman said, "Oh, I was just wandering around

908
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,480
 "and I've just been asking people."

909
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,920
 - I've tried to be asking millions of people.

910
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:36,600
 - It was from Christmas 1993

911
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:39,000
 and he'd finally made it to that town.

912
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,560
 - Wasn't that amazing?

913
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,240
 And what they reckon is, - That is insane.

914
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,840
 - This is what they reckon happened.

915
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,560
 Probably it used to have the correct address on

916
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,760
 and then it said England at the bottom,

917
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,360
 but maybe it was on a label and the label peeled off.

918
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,920
 So it got to the right area.

919
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,960
 It got to the right post office,

920
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,880
 but it hadn't gotten the actual final address on it.

921
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,240
 And so this postman goes,

922
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,560
 "Well, I might as well just try everyone that I see

923
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,200
 "and just ask just in case."

924
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,160
 And he managed to find the right person.

925
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,040
 - I'm just sort of imagining a guy

926
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,560
 with a beard down to the floor in a ragged clothes

927
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,840
 who lost his job 25 years ago,

928
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:13,080
 just stumbling down the road.

929
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,440
 Is it you?

930
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,680
 I found him.

931
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,960
 - He eventually opens it when he's desperate,

932
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,280
 works out it's for him.

933
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,520
 (laughing)

934
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:28,080
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show

935
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:30,080
 and that is James.

936
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,600
 - My fact this week is that in 1939,

937
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:37,000
 America made a huge vehicle to drive across Antarctica.

938
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,440
 Unfortunately, they put no tread on the tires

939
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,640
 so it couldn't drive on ice.

940
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,680
 - Amazing. - This is so cool.

941
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,200
 It's a thing called a snow cruiser.

942
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,760
 And they knew that they wanted to drive across Antarctica

943
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,800
 and they knew that they would need

944
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,800
 something absolutely massive to do so

945
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,840
 'cause they wanted to drive it out somewhere

946
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:57,360
 and then do a load of experiments when they were in there.

947
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:00,160
 And so they invented this enormous machine.

948
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,240
 It was in the middle of America where they invented,

949
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,720
 I think somewhere near Boston.

950
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,280
 And they had to get it from Boston to the boat

951
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,840
 and then from the boat to Antarctica

952
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,520
 and then from the Antarctic boat

953
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:13,040
 to the middle of Antarctica to do these things.

954
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,960
 And they got it all the way to the Antarctic

955
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:19,120
 and they realized that the wheels were just spinning round

956
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,760
 whenever they tried to go anywhere.

957
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:23,720
 They added some chains to it to try and get a bit of grip

958
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,200
 and that was slightly better.

959
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,680
 But they found out that the only way they could get anywhere

960
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,280
 was to drive the whole thing in reverse.

961
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:33,760
 And so they drove in reverse for 92 miles

962
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:37,480
 to the middle of the Antarctic and they got there

963
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,720
 and they could start doing some experiments

964
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,240
 but they couldn't really get it back.

965
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,000
 And so they ended up just leaving it there.

966
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,600
 - So amazing. - Incredible.

967
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,840
 - Which poor person had a horrendously cricked neck

968
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:51,040
 after doing that journey? - So bad, isn't it?

969
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,400
 - 92 miles. - And you can just drive,

970
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,520
 anyway, I mean, you can just drive backwards, can't you?

971
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,240
 You don't need to look around, it's Antarctica.

972
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,400
 What are you going to bump into?

973
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,120
 You're going to bump into penguins

974
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:02,000
 or big lumps of ice or something, right?

975
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,320
 - It just sounds hilarious,

976
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,680
 the process of getting it there in the first place, right?

977
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,280
 There's this photo of transporting it

978
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,920
 'cause I think it left from Boston

979
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,200
 but it was made in Chicago,

980
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,080
 maybe it was transported from Chicago.

981
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:15,480
 And so to get to Boston, it had to drive

982
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,960
 and it just drove along ordinary roads

983
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,080
 and there was this huge pile up

984
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:21,960
 'cause there's this giant 55 foot long,

985
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:24,720
 it's wheels are twice, three times the height

986
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,600
 of a normal car, just sitting in the middle of a motorway.

987
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:30,280
 Well, the car's around it, like, what the hell is this thing?

988
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,400
 - They stopped in a place called Framingham

989
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,320
 in Massachusetts on the way

990
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,240
 and they just stopped it in the middle of the road

991
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:40,400
 and so there was a traffic jam of 70,000 cars behind it.

992
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,480
 - Wow.

993
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:45,520
 - It was cool, it had a plane on it,

994
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,360
 it had a biplane on the roof for research.

995
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:51,240
 So it needed to carry a thousand gallons of fuel,

996
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,720
 just to fuel the plane.

997
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,560
 And then it needed obviously thousands more gallons

998
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,960
 of fuel all over it.

999
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,560
 And it had to have two spare tyres

1000
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,320
 but the tyres were 10 feet tall.

1001
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,320
 So they were just in the back.

1002
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,960
 - Yeah, each tyre had to be transported by dog sled.

1003
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,680
 - There's a brilliant picture on the Atlantic website

1004
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:11,160
 of 14 dogs pulling a single tyre

1005
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,520
 that just shows how big it was that they had to do that.

1006
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,760
 - And they had to go backwards as well,

1007
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,880
 that was the really dead end of the dog.

1008
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,640
 (laughing)

1009
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:20,480
 - Yeah.

1010
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,280
 - And on that, in that article actually,

1011
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,480
 there is a photo of it abandoned

1012
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,240
 just after they decided, look, we're not gonna take it back.

1013
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,640
 And then there's a later photo

1014
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,920
 where it's kind of slightly buried by snow.

1015
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,520
 And then there's a final photo

1016
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:35,000
 where it's almost completely buried by snow.

1017
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,600
 And there's like a little hatch

1018
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,280
 where people can go in and out.

1019
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:41,560
 And then someone went back like in the '40s

1020
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,520
 to see if it was still there and they could find it.

1021
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:46,720
 And actually it was kind of, they could still use it really.

1022
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,680
 I mean, they couldn't really use it much in the first place

1023
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,440
 but it was still kind of working.

1024
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:54,040
 And they found it again in the '50s in 1958.

1025
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,600
 But now they literally don't know where it is.

1026
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:59,160
 And it's probably covered under some snow

1027
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,680
 or it might have drifted off on an iceberg or something

1028
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,640
 but we literally don't know where this thing is.

1029
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,080
 - Wow, it's amazing.

1030
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,120
 - Maybe some penguins have made it into a home.

1031
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,840
 - Oh, that would be nice, wouldn't it?

1032
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,160
 - So lovely. - Yeah.

1033
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,160
 There's one theory that the Soviets knew where it was

1034
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,520
 and they went back and stole it.

1035
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,200
 - Why? It's useless.

1036
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:19,960
 Guys, do you know the first motorized vehicle

1037
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,800
 in Antarctica as far as I know?

1038
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,760
 - No.

1039
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,240
 - It actually went with Shackleton.

1040
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,080
 - Oh, really?

1041
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:28,440
 - Yeah, so this was in his first Antarctica expedition

1042
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,800
 in 1907 and it was an Aral Johnston car

1043
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,240
 which were the makers of the first cars in Britain.

1044
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,760
 It was basically a big bit of PR for the car.

1045
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:39,400
 So quite inconvenient for the actual expedition.

1046
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,560
 It did have, it had skis and it had special oil

1047
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:44,720
 that didn't freeze and it had a silencer on the exhaust

1048
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,200
 that doubled as a foot warmer.

1049
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:49,080
 So it siphoned the warm air round to the front

1050
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,320
 to where your feet are. - That's clever.

1051
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,320
 - But they took it with them

1052
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,760
 and so they had to bring it on the boat.

1053
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:57,160
 They had to unload some of their crucial supplies

1054
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:00,520
 and equipment from the boat to make room for this car.

1055
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,400
 They brought it with them.

1056
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:04,000
 They got it off the boat, put it on the snow

1057
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,840
 and much like James' vehicle he mentioned

1058
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,000
 they started spinning the wheels

1059
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
 and they just went deeper and deeper into the snow.

1060
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,640
 They thought, okay, we'll, we'll target with this for a bit.

1061
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,080
 Maybe we'll get it working.

1062
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,920
 They lasted two miles of pulling it along with them

1063
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,760
 before Shackleton's crew went,

1064
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,040
 can we just leave this chat behind please?

1065
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:24,800
 They abandoned it in the snow.

1066
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,920
 But yeah, first car in the Antarctic.

1067
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,840
 - There was a car in the Antarctic

1068
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:31,760
 from a Shackleton very recently.

1069
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:36,760
 It was Patrick Bergl who was Shackleton's great-grandson.

1070
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,640
 You guys must have read about this.

1071
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,400
 It was a modified Hyundai Santa Fe

1072
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:44,800
 but he actually did manage to get it working, right?

1073
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,520
 So they said that the only modification was

1074
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,760
 that they made the tires really, really big

1075
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:53,200
 and really, really loads of air inside.

1076
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,040
 So it's as much as you could like,

1077
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,240
 it could roll over your foot and you wouldn't feel it.

1078
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,760
 That's how much air was in the tires.

1079
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,440
 And that meant that it would never sink

1080
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,280
 into the ground.

1081
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:05,240
 And I imagine they had a lot of tread on there as well.

1082
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:07,720
 And they said that basically this is exactly like

1083
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:10,600
 a normal Hyundai Santa Fe apart from these tires.

1084
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,440
 But then they did say,

1085
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,080
 oh, there is one other modification

1086
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,880
 that it runs on jet fuel.

1087
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:19,600
 But the reason is 'cause jet fuel doesn't freeze

1088
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:22,120
 quite as easily as normal fuel.

1089
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:22,960
 - Ah-ha.

1090
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:26,240
 But with that in that kind of atmosphere,

1091
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:29,120
 lessen its punch when you put down the accelerator?

1092
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:33,440
 - Yeah, they went on the average about 25 miles an hour,

1093
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,280
 I think, all the time. - Oh, okay, wow.

1094
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,760
 - Well, that must have taken ages.

1095
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,160
 'Cause they went, did they go all the way across?

1096
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:42,360
 - They went 5,800 kilometres across.

1097
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,960
 Whether they went to the very end,

1098
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:46,120
 I think they might have gone to the middle and back.

1099
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:46,960
 - I bet that was dull.

1100
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,880
 I bet it was exciting for the first couple of hours.

1101
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,720
 And then old Shappenton's great grandson thought,

1102
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,480
 what was my grandad thinking?

1103
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:55,600
 - Didn't he work in, he's a marketing executive this guy.

1104
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:56,440
 - Yeah.

1105
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,280
 - He's not a ponder explorer.

1106
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,120
 - No.

1107
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:58,960
 - No.

1108
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:01,520
 - He just had to sit in a passenger seat of a car

1109
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,880
 to be there for a few weeks.

1110
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,480
 - They've basically gone, we have a car which can do this.

1111
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,720
 Anyone can do it really.

1112
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,120
 Who can we get to do it?

1113
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:11,040
 Does any of them have any relatives left,

1114
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,680
 the people who went in the first place?

1115
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,080
 But they did have one thing, sorry,

1116
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:16,840
 just on this really quickly.

1117
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,840
 They did have one thing where they had a number

1118
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,040
 of these vehicles going across

1119
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,560
 and they had to be roped together.

1120
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:23,440
 Because like you said, there can be crevasses.

1121
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,560
 And apparently one of them did fall into a crevasse,

1122
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,960
 but luckily it was kind of roped to all the other cars

1123
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,120
 so they could pull it out.

1124
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:31,320
 So it was kind of dangerous I think.

1125
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,160
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely.

1126
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:35,360
 - That's very self-sacrificing of the other cars.

1127
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,720
 'Cause it could happen the other way, right?

1128
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:37,680
 If the cross is big enough

1129
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,880
 and you're in the front car and you've made it over

1130
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:43,520
 and then you're dragged back in by the tailgaters.

1131
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,520
 - What, come on Anna.

1132
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,400
 I mean, you're a team going across.

1133
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:50,080
 I'm tactic, you're like like, fuck it, I'm in the front car.

1134
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,640
 The rest of them could do what they want.

1135
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:54,400
 - I think we've learned in the "Touching the Void" episode

1136
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,000
 of "No such thing as a fish", he was cutting the rope.

1137
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,520
 - Yeah.

1138
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:00,240
 - Yeah, I don't have the right attitude

1139
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,680
 for polar expeditions.

1140
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:05,640
 - This fact is about driving backwards.

1141
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:07,640
 I found the guy who's driven backwards

1142
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:10,560
 for the longest time, okay.

1143
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,920
 There is a taxi driver in India called Harpreet Dev

1144
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,520
 who has driven everywhere backwards

1145
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:18,800
 for about a decade now.

1146
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:19,640
 He's a-

1147
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:21,480
 - Does this mean that at the end,

1148
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:24,600
 on your meter, on your taxi,

1149
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:27,320
 he ends up having to give you money at the end?

1150
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:32,000
 - So he's been issued with a special government license

1151
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,760
 to drive anywhere in reverse in his home state.

1152
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:37,960
 And he has a big old siren on his cab to warn people,

1153
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,920
 but it's so surreal seeing footage of him

1154
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,360
 just driving around backwards all the time.

1155
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:44,040
 He's reversed the gearbox, so he's got, you know,

1156
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:46,600
 five gears in reverse and one forward.

1157
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,520
 And he says that the only disadvantage

1158
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:50,160
 to this great career he's got

1159
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,040
 is that he gets frequent pains in the neck,

1160
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,440
 extremely bad back problems,

1161
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:56,080
 and suffers what he calls severe vomiting.

1162
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:58,160
 - Oh man.

1163
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:59,000
 - I know.

1164
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,320
 - The worst thing about that with the severe vomiting

1165
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:04,640
 is he's facing in the direction of his passengers, isn't he?

1166
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:08,680
 - You'd pull the glass window.

1167
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:13,800
 - I definitely must have missed the detail there.

1168
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:15,520
 Why is he driving backwards, sorry?

1169
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:16,360
 - No, you didn't miss it.

1170
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:19,000
 - No, you didn't, you did not miss the detail.

1171
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,480
 He thought it would be fun and he thought it would be a fun gimmick.

1172
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,920
 - And then despite the dangers of it,

1173
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:27,960
 the government of the area also thought that was a great idea

1174
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,760
 and gave him license.

1175
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:30,840
 - Yeah, yeah.

1176
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:34,680
 I think if one person is doing something extremely weird

1177
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:37,640
 and dangerous, but everyone else knows he's doing it at least,

1178
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:41,880
 then everyone else can mitigate their actions to help him, right?

1179
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,760
 - It's written on the side of the cab

1180
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,800
 that this is a backwards taxi.

1181
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:48,000
 - I think you can see that when he's coming towards you.

1182
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,200
 - Yeah, he did try to drive backwards to Pakistan to promote peace,

1183
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,280
 but he did not have the permission to cross the border,

1184
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:56,000
 so he was sent home again.

1185
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:56,840
 - Right.

1186
00:44:56,840 --> 00:45:04,440
 - We were talking about people going across Antarctic a few seconds ago.

1187
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:07,240
 The first person to walk solo across Antarctica

1188
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:10,800
 only brought one pair of underwear for the entire 38-day trip,

1189
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,720
 and unfortunately, he shit himself on day 16.

1190
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:17,280
 - I'm impressed he held it in that long.

1191
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:20,960
 - Day 14 of Antarctic journey, going great so far.

1192
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:24,600
 Day 15, still absolutely not regretting my underpanned decision.

1193
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:25,600
 Day 16.

1194
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:26,920
 Oh, no.

1195
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:30,680
 - The thing is, before he set off,

1196
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:32,800
 he did an interview with Business Insider,

1197
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,760
 and he said that he was only bringing one pair of underwear,

1198
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,920
 and he was going to use the weight that he could take.

1199
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:40,480
 He was going to use it for food,

1200
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:43,640
 so he's like, "I don't need the underwear, I just need food,"

1201
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:48,200
 which kind of makes sense without the idea of retrospect,

1202
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:49,800
 of realising that it didn't.

1203
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:52,120
 And what happened was, it was the food that was a problem,

1204
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:54,960
 obviously, it is always the food that's a problem in that situation,

1205
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,120
 but he- - He shouldn't have taken Vindaloo for every moment.

1206
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:05,160
 - He took these things, he was called Colin O'Brady,

1207
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:09,680
 and he took these 1,180-calorie Colin bars

1208
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,920
 that had been made especially for him,

1209
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:15,000
 and so they had loads of protein, loads of good stuff in them,

1210
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,800
 and he was just going to eat these bars all the way across.

1211
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:20,880
 But one morning, he just got the munchies,

1212
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,760
 and he just started eating all of these Colin bars.

1213
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:28,440
 They could take coconut oil, nuts, dried cranberries, cocoa powder,

1214
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:31,400
 and he decided to eat just loads and loads of them,

1215
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:35,440
 and he had about 2,000 calories worth in one go,

1216
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:38,600
 which is about the equivalent of eight Big Macs.

1217
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:42,160
 And then the next morning, well, you all know what happened.

1218
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:43,760
 - Wow. - It's not exhibiting

1219
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:45,520
 the kind of self-control you expect,

1220
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:49,240
 but he, O'Colin, is a very controversial figure

1221
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:52,440
 in Antarctic Lloyds, certainly is, yeah.

1222
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:56,600
 Because, so he claims to be the first person

1223
00:46:56,600 --> 00:47:01,240
 to have crossed the Antarctic, fully unassisted and unsupported,

1224
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:05,160
 so that originally went to this Norwegian guy called Borge Auslan,

1225
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:06,920
 and that was in the '90s, I think,

1226
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:11,000
 but then they changed the definition to say that unsupported

1227
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,760
 had to mean without even a kite.

1228
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:15,320
 So Borge had used a kite on two occasions,

1229
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:18,040
 very, very briefly, to get himself sort of out of Snowdrift.

1230
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:19,560
 Can we just explain how that works,

1231
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:21,960
 because it sounds like he's just having a bit of fun with a kite.

1232
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,160
 Sounds really fun.

1233
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:26,440
 Was he allowed to take his yo-yo with him, though?

1234
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:30,840
 Sorry, it's for transport.

1235
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:33,640
 It's not like you stop, you fancy a hobby.

1236
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:35,880
 So I guess you're on your sled or whatever,

1237
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:38,360
 and you harness the wind that's going in the right direction

1238
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:39,720
 to pull you along with your kite,

1239
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:42,040
 or to help you to give you a bit of extra oomph.

1240
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:44,440
 And he travelled a lot further to do his trip

1241
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:46,280
 than O'Brady, who's just done his.

1242
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:49,240
 And a lot of people see Borge

1243
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:51,240
 as the person who really achieved this.

1244
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:53,880
 And O'Brady's quite a self-promoter,

1245
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:57,720
 and he's written this book where he says everyone said it couldn't be done,

1246
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:01,000
 and National Geographics interviewed everyone who advised him.

1247
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
 They were all like, "No, we told him it's pretty simple,

1248
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,040
 yeah, pretty straightforward."

1249
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:06,040
 And it was like, "There were times I was told

1250
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:07,720
 they wouldn't be able to rescue me."

1251
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:10,120
 And then someone's done an interview saying,

1252
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:11,880
 "Getting rescued in the Antarctic is kind of like

1253
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:13,400
 ordering an Uber these days.

1254
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:16,600
 You just call someone up and you can't get you out of there."

1255
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:19,400
 It's very hard to see on the Uber map, though,

1256
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:21,320
 because against a featureless white background,

1257
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:23,720
 he could be two minutes away, he could be three days.

1258
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:26,520
 Fortunately, there's a huge shit stain in the snow next to him.

1259
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:28,120
 He cleaned his pants.

1260
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:33,480
 You were saying about you could use the wind with these kites.

1261
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:36,920
 Do you know how you can tell which way the wind is going in Antarctica?

1262
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:37,880
 No.

1263
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:39,720
 Well, there's a few ways.

1264
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:42,440
 You can just lick your finger and hold it up.

1265
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:44,440
 But not if you want to keep the finger.

1266
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:45,800
 That's true, yeah.

1267
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:50,200
 One almost foolproof way is to look at which way the penguins are pointing.

1268
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:53,880
 So if there is a storm coming in Antarctic,

1269
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:56,200
 the penguins will drop to their bellies,

1270
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:59,640
 and they will point their beaks in the direction that the wind's going to come,

1271
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:01,160
 because they know there's a storm coming,

1272
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:02,520
 and they don't want to get blown over.

1273
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:07,320
 I was reading this, this was an Antarctic scientist called Lizzie Meek,

1274
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:08,920
 who was writing about this.

1275
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:09,880
 But isn't that cool?

1276
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:12,360
 You could just see which way the little penguins are pointing.

1277
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:12,920
 That was really funny.

1278
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:13,400
 That's great.

1279
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:16,280
 Do you know who the first person, possibly,

1280
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:20,040
 to set foot on the Antarctic continent might have been?

1281
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:21,720
 Was it QI producer Piers Fletcher?

1282
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:28,920
 This is so random, but I just came across this in my notes I found ages ago.

1283
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:31,240
 There was this amazing discovery in the 1980s,

1284
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:33,400
 where some bones were found in Antarctica.

1285
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:36,920
 And until then, we thought that the very first Antarctic landing

1286
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:39,800
 was a sealing expedition in 1820.

1287
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,800
 And they found these bones,

1288
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:46,440
 and they've dated them to somewhere between 1815 and 1825.

1289
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:51,560
 And they are the bones of a 21-year-old Indigenous Chilean woman,

1290
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:53,800
 which is just extraordinary,

1291
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:57,240
 because no one had gone near the continent we didn't think until then.

1292
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:59,640
 And suddenly, there's this young Chilean woman there.

1293
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:02,760
 No one knows where on earth she's come from or how she got there.

1294
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:06,920
 There's a suggestion that maybe the sealers who were European sealers

1295
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:09,240
 had found someone from Chile who would know

1296
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:11,800
 more on how to survive in that kind of environment

1297
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,560
 and taken her with them, then left her.

1298
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:14,840
 But we just have no idea.

1299
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:18,200
 So I just find that incredible, mystery.

1300
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:18,920
 Yeah.

1301
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:21,000
 I found a page on Wikipedia,

1302
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,960
 which is the list of crimes in Antarctica.

1303
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:26,520
 Because, as we were saying before,

1304
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:27,720
 there's all these sort of, you know,

1305
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:29,240
 to the point where you can order an Uber

1306
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:29,960
 to get rescued.

1307
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:33,240
 It's all these research stations that are planted.

1308
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:36,120
 I don't think you can order an Uber to get rescued.

1309
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:36,360
 Yeah.

1310
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:39,400
 Well, it'll arrive backwards, that's the thing.

1311
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:43,720
 Sorry, what I meant is it's the point of you could almost,

1312
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:46,840
 in theory, it's sort of got that sort of dense with places.

1313
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:51,240
 And yeah, so there's all these, you know,

1314
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:53,800
 research units where scientists are hauled up for ages.

1315
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:56,280
 And as a result, there's a big list of the crimes

1316
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:57,960
 that they've committed, which is always really hard,

1317
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:59,320
 because they're isolated for so long.

1318
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:03,160
 But the first crime on the list was from 1959.

1319
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:06,760
 And it was in a Soviet research station.

1320
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:08,360
 And it was between two scientists

1321
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:11,000
 who got into a massive argument,

1322
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,160
 then fight over a game of chess.

1323
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:18,920
 And it just got so heated that the guy who lost,

1324
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:22,200
 became enraged, was said to have picked up an ice axe

1325
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:23,800
 and attacked the guy.

1326
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:25,720
 And it's really hard to tell, actually,

1327
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:27,880
 whether or not the wound was fatal,

1328
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:29,160
 because there's two different stories

1329
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:31,240
 that have been presented as a result.

1330
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:33,960
 Some say he survived, some say he didn't.

1331
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:36,920
 But afterwards, chess games were apparently banned

1332
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:39,000
 on all Soviets and Russian and tariff stations.

1333
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,640
 That really feels like not the main issue here.

1334
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:46,040
 Keep hold of your axes.

1335
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:48,760
 Only for weapons and courage, chess, no.

1336
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:51,400
 No, but I just like that.

1337
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:53,080
 I like the little communities that are out there

1338
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:54,360
 that you rarely hear about.

1339
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:56,200
 In 2014, there was a scientist

1340
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:59,640
 who decided to launch his Tinder app while he was out there,

1341
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:02,120
 and he matched with someone on Antarctica.

1342
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:05,480
 Yeah, unfortunately, there were a helicopter ride away,

1343
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:07,320
 45 minutes, and they were leaving the next day.

1344
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:08,360
 And they just got an Uber.

1345
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:16,520
 OK, that's it.

1346
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:17,560
 That is all of our facts.

1347
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:19,000
 Thank you so much for listening.

1369
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:56,940
 (upbeat music)

1370
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:59,520
 (upbeat music)

1371
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:02,100

1372
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:04,160
 you
