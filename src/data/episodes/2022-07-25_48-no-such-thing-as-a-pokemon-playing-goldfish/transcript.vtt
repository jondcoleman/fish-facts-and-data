 [Playing guitar]

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.480
 They don't want to hear it, would they?

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:09.520
 [Playing guitar]

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:14.400
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.920
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden. My name is Dan Shriver.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.400
 I'm sitting with James Harkin, Andy Murray, Ann Miller, and a special guest today.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.760
 It's Victoria Coron Mitchell, who joins us because our three elves have been on only connect,

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.240
 battling it out in the big competition. They've got their quarter final match coming up this

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:37.040
 Monday, the 23rd of February, and so we thought we'd get Victoria into...

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.800
 To reveal how little she knows. The elves' possible exit from the series, I understand.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.600
 Don't worry, it cuts both ways. You can laugh at what I don't know.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.880
 Yeah, okay, so once again, we have gathered around with our four favorite facts from the last seven

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.720
 days, and in no particular order, here we go, starting with Victoria.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:02.640
 My fact is that the actor Charles Hortry hoarded bedsteads in his house,

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.040
 thinking that one day he would make his fortune from them.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.080
 That's so good. Okay, Charles Hortry, massive British comedy actor,

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.640
 carry-on films. That was a big thing for him.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.560
 Charles Hortry was particularly known for the carry-on films. I don't know if he ever did anything else.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.680
 He had a very particular acting style. Let's just say it was good news for him that the carry-on

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.920
 films came along. He had a wonderful and extremely talented, very funny man.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:35.040
 I don't know if people clamored to see his hamlet. He and Clint Eastwood weren't vying on the same

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.200
 roles, but if people have seen the carry-on films, yes, he's the sort of slender camp fellow in

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:45.680
 the glasses. Yeah, I wonder if he thought they were they really expensive bedpoles, do we think, or what?

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.800
 How are the collections started? I don't know. I mean, I like to think maybe he one day accidentally

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:57.360
 bought two bedsets when he started one. I might as well start a collection now, and he's come up with that.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.480
 I mean, he did like a drink. That is a thing that's sort of about Charles Hortry. He did. So it's

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:10.480
 possible that the original bedstead hoarding fortune wheeze was hatched in a moment, not entire,

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:15.440
 so bright. But you sober up at some point, don't you? Yeah, well, I don't know if he did ever,

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.720
 but probably he's sobered up thought, what am I doing with all these, but I have a drink and

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.160
 work at home in a rid of them. And then he gets drunk and I think this is fantastic. Look at this

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.680
 collection. I need more. Maybe that's what it was. Or it's a brilliant idea. So I've got some money,

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.040
 I'll buy a drink. No, I'll buy a bedstead. It's an investment for the future, and I can look at it

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.200
 in my house. Maybe that was a good idea. Every time I want to have a drink, I won't, I'll buy a bedstead.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.440
 That was a meeting plan. Yeah, it was a long time ago. Step three. You were supposed to be quite

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.320
 miserly, wasn't he? Charles Hortry, I read. Apparently, he brought sacks of carrots from

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.560
 Yorkshire to Kent, because they were cheaper to buy in Yorkshire, and then he would bring them all

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.000
 down south. This is for his own personal use. Just for his own, yeah, to eat. And also he kept his

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 money in the Royal Bank of Scotland, because he thought that scots were more likely to look after his

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.320
 cash carefully. Wow. Well, had he lived a little longer, he would have been thoroughly disability

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:08.640
 to that action. It's quite a good idea. It's miserliness, though. Miserliness is quite a good

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.600
 voice. There's something quite sweet and old-fashioned to probably about it, of the things that can

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:19.120
 be wrong with people. I read a sentence about Charles Hortry, which I like so much. So the first half

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.160
 isn't fun, but it picks up a lot. From there, he spiraled into reclusion and paranoid fantasies,

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.760
 buying a cottage on the south coast and filling it with brass bedsteads and rent boys,

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.840
 one of whom burnt it down after Hortry wanted to pay by check.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:39.760
 You see, now that's where a brass bedsteads are a better investment than, for example,

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.840
 first voluose of Shakespeare, because if a rent boy is in a burning house, then act a payment revenge.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:51.120
 It's the bedsteads that then come out on skate. It's just going to be ashes everywhere and hundreds

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.840
 of beds. You don't see it, you're believing in the remains, the bedsteads. His checkbook stub

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.720
 must have been amazing, because you have a little stub, don't you, to write what you've been spending

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:04.880
 the money on. Oh, yeah, no. So it's just like bedstead, bedstead, red boy, bedstead. He was quite

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.000
 mature, though, Charles, there's nothing I read about him. I don't know very much about him at all.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.760
 He was just a big fan of him in the films, but that he used to get drunken play cards on set.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.320
 I mean, that does make you think of sort of all of a read, or what, but Mischem, or something.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.200
 I mean, he's got like a drunken gambling card playing actor. You don't think of Charles Hortry,

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:29.120
 do you think of him sort of sorting out his kind of butterfly connection. But no, so I wonder if

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:34.880
 that, you know, that his carry on persona was just completely fabricated. Yeah, yeah.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:40.000
 Okay, some stuff on collections, and things like that. There's a guy called Chevalier Jackson

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.800
 who collects things that he retrieves from people's throats.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:48.560
 He's a surgeon. Actually, he's dead now. He's an old surgeon. So he has nails and bolts and

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:53.040
 binoculars, and a medallion that says, "Carry me for good luck."

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.920
 That's right, binoculars. Yeah, probably miniature. Yeah, I think I caught many, wasn't they?

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:03.520
 I don't know if you were good. Oh, miniature. Oh, yes, we're like, that you're always swallowing.

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.160
 Why would you? Actually, I've never seen a set of binoculars so small that I've thought of myself,

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.400
 I could swallow that. Yeah. I think you get ones that you can fold up as well, can't you?

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.880
 Yes, I don't know. Just fold up and tuck in your cheeks.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.400
 What was the thing about cheeks and hamsters that you found?

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.480
 Oh, um, the hamster, the x-rayed hamster while I was eating, so they stuffed their fridge into

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:28.480
 these pouches. Their pouches go all the way back to their hips. When they shove the food in,

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:32.160
 they just shove it and shove it in the hamster pouch because all the way back to their hips,

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:36.480
 yeah, they greedy things. That's extraordinary. That's where their legs are.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:40.880
 Yeah, I would think that's where I assume they'd be, but I thought that's what you would have

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:45.840
 hit bones. I would say. Yeah, whales have hit bones, which I'm not sure if we've mentioned on this

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.840
 book. No, I don't think we have. Well, we also have got hit bones. And also sometimes they'll grow

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:56.800
 legs like a kind of a vestigial leg from the side of the body. Was it whales? Yeah, so we knew they

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.120
 came on land at some point. Yeah. We didn't like it when back to the sea. Yeah. I still can't

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:05.440
 get my head around that. I don't know. And then we're like, nah. So this guy is Chevalier Jackson.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:11.440
 He says that parents who feed peanuts to children without molars should be hung drawn and

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:17.360
 quatted. He's very, you know, very serious about not putting things down children's throats basically.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:22.320
 He says people should chew their milk by which he means, yeah, you put it in your mouth and you

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:27.520
 swish it around so saliva can get around it and then you could drink it. Do you, to many people,

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:33.760
 well, I suppose he would know, would people, you wouldn't choke on milk. I don't think it is off milk.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:39.760
 He refused to cheer on his football team as he thought he would damage his larynx. And he only ever

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:48.240
 at postage stamp size sandwiches for lunch. How many did he have? Well, they huge stamps that he

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:55.840
 had. It was a tiny slice of bread with a single lettuce leaf in between. There's another guy,

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:00.880
 a librarian called Graham Barker. He has the world record for collecting belly button fluff.

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:06.960
 How hotly contested is this record? I don't imagine there are many submissions every year.

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:13.040
 Well, it's true. Does he turn up and defend his title? Well, he's been doing it for 26 years. So if

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:18.000
 you want to start now, it'll be a long time before you catch up. Is it all his own? It's all his own.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000
 I mean, I reckon you could beat the record pretty quickly with the door to door round.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:28.720
 You could do a Kickstarter for it. So this guy, Graham Barker, who says he is not obsessive,

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:36.720
 vows to continue until he is no longer capable. He says he harvests it every night and places it

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:41.760
 in a clay pot. Harvests. Because normally harvests provide nice things like grain.

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:51.760
 I think it's an annual harvest festival. I've been whole-sing celebratory songs.

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:57.120
 I think probably the latest, the new thing to collect is data about yourself. That's the huge trend,

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:02.080
 doesn't it? People have charts, you know, you can wear smart watches and things that measure your

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:07.040
 blood flow and your energy and your calories and your expenditure and every, yeah, your steps,

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:11.840
 everything can be just laid out so neatly. It's hard to imagine anyone wanting to buy that off

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:16.720
 you in the future though. But maybe that'll be instead of the collected letters, it'll be the

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:23.200
 collected Glucos expenditure of PG Woodhouse or whatever we'll see in shops. Do you have the last

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:31.200
 thing Charles Ortry did? No. He threw a vase at his nurse who asked for an autograph. That was his last

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:35.600
 act. But if he's dying, you shouldn't really bother a pro man. I mean, he said it was an autograph,

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:45.440
 it was an old ruffle bottle of his paper that said I leave my nurse everything. Okay, time for fact

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:51.920
 number two. That is James. Okay, my fact this week is that in 1937, you could visit

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:57.440
 Romford Dogtrak and watch Cheetahs racing. You don't mean people who've been taking dope?

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:05.680
 No, and this was a guy an explorer called Kenneth Gandar Dawa who brought a dozen Cheetahs from Kenya

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:10.640
 to the UK so that they could watch and race and bet on the outcome. Surely it's difficult to get a

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:14.480
 Cheetah to chase an electric rabbit. Yeah, that was a problem actually. They did find that was the

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:20.640
 problem. Yeah, I mean the thing would be to release prey. Yeah, that was a problem. Basically,

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:24.640
 they weren't really interested in racing and so it only happened twice and they just gave it

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:29.920
 it. Wow. The amazing thing about this fact, which you told me was that it was at this point that

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:34.000
 they realised Greyhounds weren't the fastest animal. Yeah, until that it was thought in Britain at

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.400
 least that Greyhounds were the fastest animals in the world. But then they brought the Cheetahs in

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:42.720
 and they just shaved so much time off their records that they realised that the Cheetahs were faster.

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:48.480
 Well, the Cheetahs they could hit 68 miles an hour. Sorry, 65 miles an hour and 43 for the

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:53.040
 for the Greyhounds. I think they can go up to about 100 kilometers an hour. Right. It was often

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:57.280
 thought that that was impossible and maybe it was a myth because it was only one ever

00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:02.560
 study that ever proved that. But then they've started putting tracking devices on

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:06.320
 Colors on Cheetahs in the wild and they found that it is true after all. Oh, they were saying as

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:09.440
 well, and I don't understand this, but they're saying that Cheetahs, when they accelerate,

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:14.080
 they change gears like the like a car changing gears as they're running. They suddenly just, yeah,

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:19.440
 they go into a different stride at different gates and yeah, it's not that they change gears

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:23.120
 mid. It's brilliant, yeah. It's kind of like a horse like walking that, was it walking that trots

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:27.280
 than the gallops and counters, but like you see. But so they were saying with Greyhounds, it's what they

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:32.160
 do is they they then change the number of steps that they take as they're running and that picks up

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:36.400
 the speed whereas Greyhounds take exactly the same number of steps no matter how fast they're going.

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:41.440
 So the feet just get like crazy fast. They don't understand. Like a cartoon. Yeah, yeah, exactly.

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:45.920
 It doesn't sound incredibly glamorous. I've not been to a few dub tracks. It's not a glamorous

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:50.400
 one. It's not like that one. It's amazing. Cheetahs though. Yeah. That is quite James Bond.

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:55.600
 That's very biggest. It is. It's so very good. This guy, kind of Gandhadao was quite glamorous

00:10:55.600 --> 00:11:01.920
 himself. He once brought a male cheater on a leash into Queen's Club. Whatever Queen's Club is,

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:06.800
 I don't know what that is. The tennis club. Oh, yeah, probably is. Yeah, yeah. And it was rubbish.

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:13.120
 It didn't return a single serve. It was very fast, but when it got to the ball, it killed three

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:19.680
 ball boys. The other thing is that they couldn't negotiate tight bends. The cheetahs apparently,

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:25.440
 like Greyhounds can. I read that they just cut the corners. Yeah, ironically, making them cheetahs

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:31.600
 in the race. And then we're marketed as Katzvi dogs, which is such a great idea.

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:38.160
 Are they racing against Greyhounds? Yeah, sometimes. So you'd have five Greyhounds and then one cheetah.

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:43.600
 And so the Greyhounds, I think, all chased after that. And then the cheetah did it a couple of times,

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:47.040
 but then I quickly realised this is a mechanical hair. Yeah. There's nothing else.

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:51.920
 The Greyhounds are not freaking out. That there was a cheetah next to them on the track.

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:55.520
 They'll be petrifying. But what happened? The cheetah would often kind of just stay at the back and

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:59.680
 be like, I'm not really bothered. And then something would catch its eye. And then it would speed up

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:04.960
 and then go miles faster than the Greyhounds. So it'd be like a proper underdog victory,

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:09.200
 you know, like in a movie. Right. Right at the back of the... This would be, this would be the movie

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:14.480
 if you were having this. But if you knew that a race was going to be, you know, five dogs at a cheetah,

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:18.480
 the thing to do is in the car on the way to have a friendly bet with a person who would say,

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:22.560
 "Listen, I'm going to take track seven. I just, I love it. I just, I want to track five. I'm lucky then."

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:26.560
 And have the long and personal be all right, because obviously they've got, if they've got

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:30.080
 six spots and you've got one, you're in great trouble. So you'd have the bet. And then when you've

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:35.440
 got there and they saw it was a cheetah, they'd feel tricked and then you'd sell a bet back to them for

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:40.160
 a huge sum. And then the dogs would all race off and the cheetah would go, "Well, I can't be bothered."

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:44.160
 I mean, that's a win-win. It's what they could go in all green. You're in your betting and laying

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:48.400
 at the same time. So you're every outcome is successful. You could definitely negotiate a position

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:52.000
 where you're winning whatever, just because you know there's a cheetah in the race. And visit that

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.960
 thing about winning both way. They've read about this guy called Brian Zembek, who bet his friend

00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:03.040
 Brian Zembek. He bet his pal $100,000 that he would get breast implants for a year. And he did it.

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:07.520
 But he still has them. This was about eight years ago. But this was the moronic thing about

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:13.360
 what? This is what I want to say to Brian Zembek. Exactly the kind of proposition bet you have to

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:18.320
 never take, prop bets, which is, you know, on certain sort of outcomes that might be under

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:23.360
 persons control. You can take weight loss bet, you know, certain sort of thing. Whether or not

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:30.960
 someone will get breast implants, he just will get them. You know, bet me, I won't do that. I think

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:34.480
 this is a ridiculous rule. Because I think what happened here basically is they've paid him to do

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:38.240
 it, haven't they? Because like you say, if you give him enough money, he will do it. And they've just

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:43.360
 found the price that you do. You have a lot of that. Yes, I want a better guy, but it's not really a

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:47.520
 bet. James Dempsey, Flushy, they call him. It's a very good poker player. But I had, as it were,

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:51.600
 a bet with him that he wouldn't turn up to the world series of poker, wearing an outfit that

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:57.120
 I'd selected for him from the mall. And he accepts the bet. But these we both knew, I knew I can't

00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:03.040
 remember what we bet $500 maybe. I knew he would wear anything for the money. And he knew that I was

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:07.200
 happy to pay for him to see him walk into the room dressed in, you know, I just had a fantastic

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:12.880
 afternoon go around the hall by terrible sort of glittering hats. And I didn't go for something

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:18.880
 really outlandish like, you know, a costume. I went for something that would make him look like a real

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:28.080
 tosser. So I think it was like a t-shirt with a straight flush on it. That sort of vagus tourist hat.

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:32.960
 But also he also had to factor in, you know, it's a $10,000 tournament and he needs to have the sort of

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:38.320
 peace of mind just sit down like that and have everyone think he's a really idiot and play anyway.

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:42.320
 But that's a different because there's probably, you know, the famous one, the ones are always great

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:47.920
 at the sort of the trickster gamblers, like Titanic Thompson and, you know, Amarillo Slim and people

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:54.400
 who tricked people into bets that weren't really what they sounded like. So the famous, for example,

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:59.760
 Titanic Thompson, once, you know, he bet with a guy, there was a watermelon truck was going past and

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:04.320
 he bet how many, oh, I reckon there's, you know, 40 watermelons on that truck. The other guy said,

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:10.480
 you know, 100. But of course Thompson had paid the man to drive past that and vote for the watermelons

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:16.640
 on the truck. Or Amarillo Slim had a lot of them. He had a bet once, you know, he bet a golfer

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:21.680
 that he could hit a golf ball further than him and the guy he'd never met this person. He's like,

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:26.160
 what kind of idiot is this nibbett? And Slim said, you know, I'm choosing the golf course, that's fine.

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:30.480
 And, you know, but they chose their own course. So the golfer picked his favourite course, he hit the ball

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:35.120
 and then they went to Slim's choice and it was a frozen lake. Of course, he's over here at the ball

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:39.440
 and it sort of skitted for miles, miles, miles, miles. And that kind of thing, that's rather beautiful.

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:42.880
 Yeah. You know, someone's just been done. They haven't looked at the small print.

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:47.600
 Okay, that's enough facts. Let's have an advert.

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:52.080
 All right. This is to remind you that today's instalment of no such thing as a fish is sponsored

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:58.080
 by Squarespace, the website building website builder that makes it very easy to build a website.

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:16.160
 you'll save 10% of your order. 10%. 10%. Do we have any facts about 10%? 10% of people are left

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:21.120
 handed. Give me a take. Oh, yeah. Is that right? Yeah. Well, I'm with the show, eh?

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:28.320
 On that bombshell. Okay. Time for fact number three, and that is end.

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:36.960
 Yep. In 2010, the US military built a supercomputer out of 1,760 PS3s. Wow. How is that even possible?

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:40.400
 Um, it's not okay. It's not possible anymore. They basically got really lucky. It's basically

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:46.560
 Sony did an upgrade. So you can't mess with places. It's really lucky. Sorry. What were they?

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:50.560
 They bought the PlayStation. They're like, I'm just going to do it and we'll see what happens.

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:55.920
 There's no method to this. It was a land party that got out of hand. Yeah. And then yeah. So basically,

00:16:55.920 --> 00:17:00.880
 they wanted to build a super computer. And at the time, PlayStation 3's cost $400. But the equivalent

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:05.760
 computing power will be $10,000 each. And they needed obviously $1,660. It's quite a lot. So they got

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:09.440
 these PlayStation's wired them up together and they hacked them. So they're all joined together

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:13.280
 and they're running off Linux, which is rather than running on PlayStation games. And then yeah,

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:17.280
 it's using the US military. They're using it to track stuff. And it was what they definitely was

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:25.600
 either that or someone said to that department, I see you've ordered $1,760 PS3s. Super computer?

00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:30.400
 Yeah. No. Yeah. That's because we're making a super computer. They had to do it. It would have

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:34.080
 been really. But when they did it, it was the 33rd biggest computer in the world when they

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:41.680
 completed it. Really? I saw a list of the 500 fastest super computers in the world. And the number

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:49.280
 one is called Tiana2, it's in China. And that means Milky Way. Because it can do as many calculations

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:54.080
 per second as there are stars in the Milky Way. But the interesting thing I thought is it's been number

00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:59.760
 one for four years. It's a lot faster than one below it as well. Yeah. But you would kind of think

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:03.760
 that because of Marslaura or whatever, that it would they would get faster and faster. But this one

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:07.680
 has been number one for all that time. The other thing I love about that list is that a lot of

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:12.160
 super computers sound like they belong on Gladiators. So there's like, I went down. So there's Titan,

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:17.440
 Vulcan, Lightning, Vulcan, Shadow, Crystal, Macman, Maverick, and Super computer system for

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:23.680
 statistical science, I. He was a great Gladiator. I want to hear a word again soon. Also the 190 second

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:30.000
 most powerful super computer is called Gordon. Good, it's a good solid name. The famous one is Watson,

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:36.240
 isn't it? Who won? Yeah. jeopardy a few years ago if you remember that. He obviously doesn't do that

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:42.640
 anymore. And so he's now making, he's working as a chef coming up with new dishes. So he takes all of

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:47.840
 the different, all the different dishes and all the different ingredients and he mixes them up and

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:54.960
 supposedly uses his intelligence to make new dishes. I bet they're awful. Terrible. And how does that

00:18:54.960 --> 00:19:00.880
 differ from a seven-year-old? Well, it differs in that. It can't do it very well. And a seven-year-old

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:07.680
 probably can. There was an article in New Scientist and they tried to get some of the dishes that it had.

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:12.800
 One of them, a creme fraiche, had been replaced by a glass of milk. And another one, the tuna bake

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:20.480
 had replaced a tuna with a kilo of goose meat. No one ever wants even a small amount of goose meat these

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:24.880
 two. I was watching Watson's actually appearance in jeopardy and everyone's like, oh, he makes a

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:29.040
 gap two minutes in because he's, Watson repeats the same answer to someone else they're already given.

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:34.080
 That's right. But we're still beaten by a machine. I would let that one slide. Yeah. And they can

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:37.920
 presumably, computers can make a limited number of gaps at the moment. They can't be involved in a

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:44.880
 race scandal. That's one more note we'll have artificial intelligence is when the first computer is

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:53.040
 forth to resign over an indiscreet late-night tweet. I started looking into PlayStation. So, okay,

00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:58.160
 here's a really odd thing I found out. Grand Theft Auto. I don't know if you guys know that. Yeah,

00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:03.920
 is it? Okay. So Grand Theft Auto 5, officially so far, just up until this point now, is the most

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:09.520
 successful franchise ever. Thank you very much. One of my friends is Harry Potter and that

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:15.040
 game. They Grand Theft Auto 5 when they released it on the opening 24 hours, it's sold 500

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:20.720
 million copies. What? 500 million pounds worth of copies. Yeah, not 500 million copies. Everyone

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:28.160
 person in 12. Yeah, yeah. Everyone in the world. Wow. And that makes it officially the biggest

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:32.800
 franchise. I saw something great yesterday. You know Playmobile, these little, yeah,

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:39.040
 these little plastic ties. The fastest selling Playmobile of all time came out last week and it was

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:46.960
 a Martin Luther Playmobile tie. Martin Luther. Oh wait, no. Martin Luther, they're the stream protestant.

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:52.080
 Yeah, that's the one. Yeah. It was released to mark the 500th anniversary of the publication of

00:20:52.080 --> 00:21:01.120
 95 feces on the power and elasticity of indulgencies and they sold 34,000 in 72 hours. I've got six.

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:10.720
 Yeah, I love them. Why is Playmobile doing a celebratory Martin Luther 16, very doll? I mean, do they do a

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:16.080
 lot of, they're in their brand, or just someone they're absolutely bloody lovely. The new chief executives,

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:20.720
 a massive fan of Martin Luther. You're a great, great nephew. I like the new Farmyard Range, but

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:29.200
 I make a million plastic tidal Bible Translations. And it's worked. It's amazing. I know. I saw an

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:33.040
 amazing, there's a movie shop around the corner in Covent Garden and they have all the kind of, you

00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:38.400
 know, just classic movie merchandise toys, a lot of action figures. And there's an Apollo 13 toy

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:43.600
 there and Apollo 13 is my favorite movie. And it's a car that appears in the movie. I just thought

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:51.440
 who the hell is buying the car completed. Apollo 13, the one with Tom Hanks goes to space. Yes.

00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:57.040
 Is your favourite film of all the films that were ever made. Wait, wait, wait, don't ask him for his

00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:00.880
 top five, because it gets worse. I thought your favourite was grown-ups too.

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:05.040
 Growing-ups too. Mean girls. No, Apollo 13, because I love the story. I just think it's the

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:10.400
 greatest story. But your favourite ever. That's I remember a poll once coming out about the greatest

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:16.560
 albums of all time. And number two was the White Album from The Beatles. Number one was Stars by

00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:21.840
 Simply Red. And maybe when people vote in these things, you literally have just written down

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:24.640
 the last album you bought, haven't you? That's a great question though. When's the last time you

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:29.440
 heard Stars by Simply Red? Because that was a fantastic album. My favourite album is just a recording

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:36.560
 of Martin Luther. Play it every day. Maybe they've looked at Lego with the blame-of-beel thing,

00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:40.320
 and they've thought, because Lego have diversified so much and robots and all this stuff.

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:45.600
 You can buy Lego UN building. Where you can just sort of have meetings in it. That's brilliant.

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:51.280
 In the 50s, there was a Barbie who came with a book, which said don't eat on the cover.

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:59.120
 Seriously, yeah. I think it was a dieting Barbie or it was a model Barbie, I mean, it was super

00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:06.320
 computers. The world's fastest supercomputer, who I mentioned earlier, uses 99% of its volume to

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:11.760
 to keep it cool. Correct. I didn't go to the Museum of Computing. So I was like, oh yes,

00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:14.400
 is that where you found this fact? Yeah, I went to the National Museum of Computing

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:19.040
 in Bletchley last weekend and it was so so incredible. Everyone's free. It's half an hour of London,

00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:23.440
 it's amazing. And they've got Colossus, which actually runs. They let it run and we were

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:27.200
 watched it go. They've got, which is that all this computer, that you could see being programmed.

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:31.120
 So as it does, it's functions. You see all the different bits lighting up and making worry noises.

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:35.680
 They've got this amazing computer memory from the 60s. It's like all like crates of memory,

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:41.440
 and it's worth like 20 bytes. And it's just, yeah, so amazing. I always think it's a bit sad,

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:47.600
 the way the first great thing invented in some field is so rubbish. I think it's sad. It's like

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:53.040
 seeing old very old buildings, which were the absolute, you know, they were the best thing in defense

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:57.200
 500 years ago. So you know that to your first boyfriend, isn't it? Anything? The time, that's so

00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:01.520
 exciting. So I wanted to send me a Valentine's card, and you go, wow, but then you look at the later

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:07.280
 upgrades. Yeah. How did I? Yeah. We had Buzz Aldrin on Museum of Curiosity. And there was this

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:12.080
 amazing moment where we gave him one of those singing birthday cards. And he was, you know,

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:16.560
 as a Wallace and Gromit one. He just opened it. And the point that we had for him to hold this and

00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:21.520
 open it was that there was more computing power in that card than there was in the lunar module.

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:24.880
 You're just trying to make him feel bad about himself. Well, yeah, he was pretty pissed up with that.

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:29.760
 He threw the card up to the table. He went, "Can this card land on the moon?"

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:35.280
 Okay, sorry. Yeah, yeah. Well, I mean, it can. You just have to put it in. Yeah.

00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:38.880
 And it can. I'm not just making it feel worse, but

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:46.160
 my other favorite video game fat is that in 2014, a Goldfish played Pokemon. What?

00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:49.520
 And totally going to trade out the office Goldfish. Yeah, I don't know what that sentence means.

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:53.360
 So, Pokemon's a video game where you do your own Pokemon like in the 90s, a little Goldfish

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:57.680
 didn't play it. No, it did. It did. It did. It didn't. I think it knew what it was doing. They put it

00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:02.480
 in his hang. And it had a webcance. If it swam left, the character went left. If you went right,

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:06.640
 the character went right. And finally, after the first few hours, it was reported that Goldfish had

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:11.760
 chosen his first Pokemon, a Charmander. He'd named it A-A-A-B-B-K, and won a fight against a Squirtle.

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:17.440
 Maybe it was like Pokemon. Maybe it knew. It was swimming about. But it's not got any hands, so it

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:20.960
 would need some sort of motion detection. And that's probably right. Inside its head, it was going

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:27.120
 damn my lack of hands. I would have chosen the better name, and A-A-B-B-K. My name is Terence.

00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:38.080
 I crave Pokemon. Okay, time for our final fact, and that is Andy. My fact is that in 1552,

00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:42.720
 a man in England managed to shoot himself to death with a bow and arrow, which I think

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:46.640
 is a Darwin award before the fact. How on earth is that even possible?

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:52.960
 Well, his name was Pert, Henry Pert, and he was a gentleman. He lived in Nottinghamshire,

00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:58.800
 and he was trying to fire an arrow straight up in the air. History doesn't record why, unfortunately.

00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:03.840
 But he drew the bow to its full extent, and then the arrow lodged. And while he was leaning over

00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:10.320
 to look, it managed to un-lodge itself, and he died the next day, unfortunately, for him. The next day.

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:17.200
 I mean, he didn't, yeah, I mean, it's quite an achievement because obviously with handguns,

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:20.720
 you know, accidents happen. But with a bow and arrow, you have to be doing it quite badly wrong

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:27.520
 to kill yourself that way. Yeah. But that's the thing. Coroners in the Middle Ages have

00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:33.680
 recorded 56 accidental deaths from people at Archery who were standing too close to the targets,

00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:37.840
 or who just went and collected arrows at the wrong time, which had already been fired.

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:41.680
 I think it's a bit unfair to say that the people were standing too close to the targets.

00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:46.720
 It's more the guy who shot didn't hit the target, really. Yeah, I mean, it depends how bad the archer

00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:51.440
 was. You're right. Yeah, maybe. Remember the Olympics? It was an archer who was like very famous

00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:57.280
 celebrity, Gina Davis. Gina Davis, Delmar and Louise. Yeah, she didn't quite make it into the

00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:01.600
 Olympic team. She placed 24th out of 300 people. I mean, that's, you know, I didn't quite make it

00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:09.840
 onto the Olympics. Do you know, I think if there's a linking theme to this episode, it's the sort of

00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:15.520
 tragedy of the transience of an actor's life. I mean, you've got Charles Hortry hoarding

00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:21.120
 the bedsteads. Gina Davis desperately trying and failing to make the Olympic archery team.

00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:25.280
 I mean, even even the Supercomputers branched out into cookery. Yeah, that's true. You do realise

00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:29.200
 this isn't only connect we're not looking for a link between all of them. You've definitely

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:39.600
 even seen what the hell is that. I have a wrong to the full thing. So some mortality things.

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:46.400
 There was a Greek philosopher called Philatus of Cause, who studied erroneous word usage so intensely

00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:51.360
 that he wasted away and staffed their... But we all do know somebody like that, you know? Yeah, you can't

00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:57.520
 leave me. Somebody who's such a pedant. Are you looking at me? You know, Captain Pinino.

00:27:57.520 --> 00:28:02.000
 James won't let us say Pinini because it's a plural. You'd say one pinino. If you order a pinini,

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.720
 he will make you eat two of them. Yeah, plural's a fat macchew. Oh, you would say you order a

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:12.960
 pinini. A pinino. I would say I would... I know, I'm sorry, you've got it a pinini. That's okay,

00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:20.640
 all right. Finally, someone who I've been thinking about for years. No, no, no. It feels so plural to you.

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:26.960
 What do you say can I have a pinino? I do. James does. I think he... I would be trapped between

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:32.320
 not wanting to be grammatically incorrect and not wanting to sound like a wanker, so... I think I'd

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:36.560
 have to find some middle ground. Yeah, see, this is the kind of argument we have today. James is wasting

00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:43.440
 away at the moment because we're having a lot of fun. I found some stats in Australia. Contact with

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:50.560
 a hot water tap is more deadly than a venomous spider in Australia. So, again, I'm sorry. If you're

00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:54.400
 a man that will go into a sandwich shop and say I want a pinina, I'm going to point out you that

00:28:54.400 --> 00:29:00.160
 it isn't. Okay. More people might die as a result, but that doesn't make the hot water tap more deadly

00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:03.360
 than a poison spider. You must have seen the next... The later series of "I'm a celebrity,

00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:08.000
 get me out of here" but they have to be locked in a cage with a hot water tap. It's the big series

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:13.840
 back home. Australia's worst taps. It's a very dangerous tap this week. He's taking out six then.

00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:19.200
 Yeah, it's... Wait, so they would scold them to the point of death? Yeah, basically that. Wow.

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:24.160
 Yeah, being scolded stuff. Is it only Australia? Australia is the only place I have figures from.

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:28.400
 I've not heard this. This isn't like a cultural thing that I was told at school. No, I think it's more

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:32.720
 that people think like bugs and things and trucks are really deadly, but actually the amount of people

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:36.400
 they kill. Yeah, that's it, basically. There might be people who are very, very few people die of

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:40.960
 kind of spiders in Australia because they have them. Yeah. But, I mean, isn't there a difference

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:46.240
 between a kill and stupidity? Is it like the taps not trying to kill... That's a good point, actually.

00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:50.640
 Yeah. In the middle ages, they would have put the tap on trial as a deodorant. As a witch.

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:55.120
 Yeah. Yeah. As a satanic object. As if he kills someone. What was the word you said? A deodorant.

00:29:55.120 --> 00:30:00.880
 What's that? So it's like they would have trials in the middle ages. If like a bow of a tree had fallen

00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:07.200
 on someone, they would put the bow of the tree on trial and... Wow. Yeah. I found a really one on the

00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:11.840
 QI talk boards that between 1658 and 1663, there were four deaths recorded in the

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:18.480
 power of Lamplu in Cumbria because of death, frightened to death by fairies. That's an inexperienced

00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:23.760
 coroner who wants to cover his back, basically. Well, they've changed the rules now that you can't

00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:28.480
 die of natural causes in the UK. So they have to put something down on your death certificate.

00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:33.280
 Fairies, yeah. Fairies. No, it was in the throat. It's something. This is quite a nice thing.

00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:40.560
 The first ever funeral flowers were 13,000 years ago, which I find fascinating. So they...

00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:44.960
 Would we know that? Well, they found Stone Age graves. There's a Mediterranean

00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:50.240
 culture called the Natufians. I'm sorry if I'm mispronouncing it. Twenty toothians listening.

00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:56.320
 But they built the first cemetery. So before that, there were only scattered bodies which had been

00:30:56.320 --> 00:31:00.320
 buried, but they were the first people who, where we found a hundred bodies in the same place. So we

00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:06.240
 think that's the cemetery. And archaeologists have found... I think there are mains of flower beds,

00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:10.960
 which would have been around and underneath the bodies as well. So that's the earliest evidence

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:16.800
 we have for the use of flowers in a funeral ritual, if you like. Which I think is amazing. I think

00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:21.840
 that's rather nice, actually. And they were the first people who had a feast. The first ever feast

00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:28.400
 was the Natufians. And it consisted of 71 turtles. No, sorry, 71 tortoises. When I was a kid,

00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:33.280
 they... So in Hong Kong, they used to tell us that you would be vertical burials.

00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:40.240
 Okay. Space. Did you guys heard of that? I have heard of that, yeah. A lot of people live in

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:45.760
 cemeteries in Cairo, as in they live in cemeteries. There's such a housing problem that thousands

00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:51.040
 upon thousands of people, and the city has these enormous cemeteries. It's where I always, like, when

00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:57.200
 we found out there's this thing about 30 million people in China living caves. They're just housing

00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:01.440
 caves. When you hear that, I just always think... I kind of thought I just knew where everyone was.

00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:08.960
 And then you discover there's just all these people living in these extreme locations. That's

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:12.960
 a big number for a cemetery. How many people would you expect there to be living in cemeteries?

00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:17.680
 What, just none? I just thought... I mean, the fact himself was already it. I'm starting like...

00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:22.560
 12. Who's that? He's roaming. Yeah, he's about the right number.

00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:28.800
 Actually, there is a fact about... Is it Brookwood Cemetery, just outside London? If all the bodies

00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:33.840
 came back to life and became zombies, the population would be higher than Southampton.

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:37.840
 Really? Yeah. Because some people... I've really gone a long way to come up with that fact.

00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:43.920
 I'm sorry it was me. I mean, given the unliklihood of all of the bodies coming to life,

00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:48.000
 here's my favourite fact about Southampton. Southampton once, and I think this was in some...

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:55.680
 I mean, the 80s or early 90s, Southampton came second in a poll of the most boring towns in Britain.

00:32:55.680 --> 00:33:01.280
 What's brilliant about that is it wasn't even interesting enough for me. I mean, whatever one,

00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:07.120
 there's something wonderful about that place. Southampton is so boring. It's not even the most boring.

00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:14.640
 Okay, that's it. That's all of our facts. Thanks so much for listening. If you want to get in contact

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:21.200
 with any of us, you can find us on Twitter, I'm on @Sriberland and... @Miller_Andy @AndryHunterM.

00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:26.240
 @Xshaped @Victoria. @VictoriaCoron, which isn't even my name anymore,

00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:30.240
 but the new one is too long to change. Can you put just an M at the end?

00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:34.400
 I put a name on my tweeting name. I mean, listen, you all talk about supercomputers and I pretend

00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:38.960
 isn't what they are and I don't. You probably can change your fits and everything, but I don't know how.

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:43.360
 Okay, if you want to hear all of our previous episodes, you can head to

00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:48.240
 nosuchthingasofish.com. They're all theirs, about 48 of them, and we'll be back again next week

00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:56.400
 with another episode. Thanks for listening, see you then. Goodbye.
