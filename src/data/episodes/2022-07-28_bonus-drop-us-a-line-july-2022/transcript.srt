1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,920
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:03,760
 - Hi, guys.

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,120
 - Hi there, Andy.

4
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,100
 - Welcome to Club Fish.

5
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:10,240
 Anna, we have to address the listener as well as each other.

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,920
 - Oh my God, are there listeners?

7
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:12,760
 - I'm afraid so.

8
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,040
 - Wow, somebody just told me that a while ago.

9
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,800
 All right, listeners, welcome to Club Fish.

10
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,200
 What is Club Fish?

11
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,000
 Well, it's the secret exclusive VIP lounge

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,880
 that we've just given you access to.

13
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,080
 What does it offer? Snacks?

14
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,480
 - So many snacks.

15
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,320
 - Right.

16
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,400
 - We still have to provide you your own actual snacks, but.

17
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,520
 (laughing)

18
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,120
 - No, what it is, is we get so many amazing emails

19
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,160
 from all of you guys, and we have done over the years,

20
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,920
 whether that's emails saying here's a bizarre, obscure fact

21
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,120
 on mollusks, 'cause I'm the world expert,

22
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,120
 or whether it's emails saying that thing

23
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,000
 that Dan said last week, that was stupid.

24
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,240
 We love them all equally.

25
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:52,000
 - A full range from, I know more about you on this,

26
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,080
 to I know more about Dan on this.

27
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,960
 And we thought we genuinely get so much brilliant correspondence

28
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,600
 that it was time to hand over to you, the listeners,

29
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,600
 and record a little bonus section

30
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,160
 with all of your correspondence.

31
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:06,160
 - Although, if someone made a mistake of allowing Andy

32
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,480
 to host it, so the next voice you will be hearing,

33
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,160
 I'm afraid, it's still going to be Andrew Hunter Murray's.

34
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,680
 - It's provisionally called Drop as a Line.

35
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,000
 - Drop as a Line.

36
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:24,160
 (speaking in foreign language)

37
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,760
 (upbeat music)

38
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,040
 - Hello, this is Drop as a Line,

39
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,560
 which is the bit where we hear from fish listeners

40
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,040
 who often send in facts, which are more interesting

41
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,840
 than the ones we talked about, or corrections,

42
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,960
 which are more accurate than the things

43
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,200
 we talked about on the show.

44
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,760
 So we might as well just kick off

45
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,400
 with a few emails from listeners.

46
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,640
 - Yeah, go after it, what we got?

47
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,280
 - Well, which do you want first?

48
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,440
 Do you want a correction, or do you want bonus info?

49
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:51,600
 - Oh, I don't want to be hit so quickly in the show.

50
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,480
 Obviously a correction for me, let's do a--

51
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,880
 - Okay, we can do a bit of bonus info.

52
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,480
 Cast your minds back to episode 311.

53
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,480
 - Oh yeah, I remember it well.

54
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,520
 - It's about two and a half years ago now,

55
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,280
 but look, Laura Dunlop from Calgary in Alberta, Canada

56
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,640
 has written in, just listening to episode 311

57
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,720
 about dog shows and poop and such.

58
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,800
 - Oh yeah, awesome. - We did talk about this.

59
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,240
 All right, here we go.

60
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,240
 To stop a dog from pooping in the ring,

61
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,400
 the handlers can tell when a dog has to go--

62
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,600
 - Wait a minute, why are they at this boxing fight?

63
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,800
 (laughing)

64
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,160
 What do you mean pooping in the ring?

65
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,840
 - Oh, sorry, dog show, dog show ring.

66
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,180
 - Oh, right, okay. - You're doing it.

67
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,120
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

68
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,720
 Sorry, to stop a dog from pooping in the ring,

69
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,600
 off the dog show, the handlers can tell

70
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,040
 when a dog has to go because of the size of their sphincter.

71
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,000
 It looks larger when they have to go,

72
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,560
 so to stop an accident from happening,

73
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,360
 they put the sulfur end of a match in the anus--

74
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,560
 - No, they don't. - Which immediately

75
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,000
 makes the dog defecate before entering the ring.

76
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,920
 I worked with a woman who had her dogs in shows,

77
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,920
 and she told me that is how they do it.

78
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:53,120
 The more you know, and then a rainbow emoji from Laura.

79
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,720
 - How many dogs are set on fire before crafts

80
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,480
 that we've never seen?

81
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,320
 - That is incredible.

82
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,160
 I have a related fact on that,

83
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:07,160
 and that is that doctors can tell if you have a fistula

84
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,960
 in that area of your body by testing

85
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,320
 if you have an anal wink.

86
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,360
 - Oh, sexy. - And that is exactly

87
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,720
 what it sounds like. (laughing)

88
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,280
 Uranus winks at them when they do a little kind of--

89
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,760
 - That's so funny, it's floating.

90
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,720
 - Hang on, you do a tickle and it closes.

91
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,000
 - It closes slightly, yeah.

92
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,080
 - Is it not supposed to do that?

93
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,920
 - No, it does, and if it doesn't do that,

94
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,760
 that means that you--

95
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,040
 - Oh, so you meant to have a--

96
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,920
 - You're supposed to have an anal wink, yeah.

97
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,120
 - I'm actually testing now if I think I have an anal wink.

98
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,840
 (laughing)

99
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,320
 - I saw a great tweet the other day

100
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,200
 from someone called Octopus Caveman,

101
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,520
 @OctopusCaveman, who wrote,

102
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,480
 "My son told me he learned that octopuses

103
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,520
 "can climb through small cracks,

104
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,080
 "so he's scared to swim in the ocean

105
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,520
 "because an octopus might climb inside his butt,

106
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,080
 "and now I'm scared to swim in the ocean."

107
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,560
 - So here's the thing, octopuses can go through small cracks.

108
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,400
 - Yeah.

109
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,120
 - But they can't go through anything

110
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,160
 that's smaller than their eye.

111
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,000
 - Or their beak eye? - 'Cause there's an eye

112
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,840
 that doesn't change.

113
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,840
 - Presumably the size of an octopus's eye or beak changes

114
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,960
 with the size of the octopus.

115
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,480
 - Yeah, so if you see a tiny octopus with a small eye

116
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,960
 or a small beak, then you might be scared,

117
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,080
 but if it's a nice big sort of crackin' like one,

118
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,920
 you're okay, it's not gonna get any--

119
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,240
 - You're okay, you got other issues

120
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,080
 if you see a crackin'.

121
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:13,920
 (laughing)

122
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,760
 - And all that means is that

123
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,240
 you've got much more to be scared of,

124
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,480
 because if you can't see an octopus that's so big

125
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,160
 it can't climb inside your bottom,

126
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,680
 then you might not be seeing the octopus,

127
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,240
 which is small enough that it could.

128
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,880
 - But then, if an octopus is that small,

129
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,040
 do you even mind it going in your bottom?

130
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,240
 - I think I would, that might be a problem.

131
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,240
 - 'Cause they're so intelligent,

132
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,280
 I would fear some sort of power-sharing arrangement

133
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,120
 that we might not want to.

134
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,680
 - You think they start a revolution then?

135
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,520
 - We look like a ventriloquist.

136
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,640
 - Like a takeover bit, basically.

137
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,080
 We don't know how many people around the world

138
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,120
 are just octopuses.

139
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,520
 - So you know that bad guy in "Teenage Recent Ninja Turtles"?

140
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,360
 - Shredder.

141
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,720
 - There's one who kind of is a little octopus

142
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,600
 that lives in his chest.

143
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,060
 He went in through the anus.

144
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:49,900
 (laughing)

145
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:50,740
 - Interesting.

146
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,400
 - That's part of the official "Teenage Recent" canon.

147
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,400
 That's canon stuff, 'cause I love that episode.

148
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,120
 (laughing)

149
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,360
 - Sorry, what was the fact again?

150
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,520
 Oh, it's about dog shows, isn't it?

151
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,000
 - They put a match in a dog's bottom.

152
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,200
 - Wasn't there, I think there was one recently

153
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,800
 that went viral, where a dog pooed

154
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,440
 in the middle of a dog show, wasn't there?

155
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,760
 - There was, well, that's because clearly they hadn't-

156
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,960
 - They hadn't checked the ring to save the ring.

157
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,480
 Check the ring to save the ring.

158
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,760
 (laughing)

159
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,600
 Every dog owner's mantra.

160
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,440
 - There are big posters up at Crofts, aren't there?

161
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,160
 So check the ring to save the ring.

162
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,500
 - If the conservative party was in charge of Crofts,

163
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,600
 'cause they're always loving their slogans, aren't they?

164
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,440
 (laughing)

165
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,280
 - Yeah, for that.

166
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,800
 - I'd love if there was a close-up shot

167
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,460
 just before the dog took the shit

168
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,960
 and its anus winked at the camera.

169
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,680
 (laughing)

170
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,680
 - Like Ann Robinson, the weakest link.

171
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,440
 (laughing)

172
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,280
 - God.

173
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,220
 - Well, thank you, Laura.

174
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,060
 (laughing)

175
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,740
 That was incredibly helpful.

176
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:46,220
 And you slightly regret starting on such an anus, you won,

177
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,460
 but I think that's good.

178
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,300
 - Well, that's what we did on the actual podcast.

179
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,680
 - Remember, the first facts were,

180
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,740
 well, the first facts was about Garfield's anus.

181
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:53,580
 - Yeah, that's right.

182
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,420
 - Starts, do you mean to go on?

183
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,880
 - All right, well, I've now got a choice for you

184
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,300
 of a bonus info or the correction.

185
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,300
 It's still the same correction as before.

186
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,140
 - Let's go with corrections.

187
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:01,980
 - Corrections, yeah, we can take it.

188
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:02,920
 - I don't know who the perp is actually on this one.

189
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,360
 All right.

190
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,060
 This is from Randolph Peters.

191
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,480
 - Canada. - I don't like him already.

192
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,320
 - Also.

193
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,160
 - Wow.

194
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:10,980
 - Also Canada.

195
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:11,820
 - What have you taken against?

196
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,100
 - Randolph or Peters?

197
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,040
 - Well, it's that he's going to correct his answer.

198
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,760
 (laughing)

199
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,600
 - Also from Canada, I've just realized.

200
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,480
 - Oh, Calgary Alberta?

201
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,780
 - Doesn't specify.

202
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:22,620
 - Probably.

203
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:23,820
 - Brett the Hitman Hortz from there as well.

204
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,640
 (laughing)

205
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,940
 - You'll find out what his beef is.

206
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,320
 The fact how I know he's Canadian

207
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,160
 from the substance of this.

208
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,000
 - Got it.

209
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,820
 - Oh yeah.

210
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:33,660
 - Dear, no such thing.

211
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,100
 I'm trying to get my fellow Canadian friends

212
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,460
 to listen to the podcast,

213
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:42,460
 but when you relocate the CN Tower from Toronto to Seattle,

214
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:45,200
 you make my job almost impossible.

215
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,060
 Seattle Space Needle is 1/3 the size

216
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,920
 of our manhood metaphor,

217
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,680
 which is still the tallest free-standing tower

218
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,600
 in the Western Hemisphere.

219
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,140
 So there, if we can't trust you on towers,

220
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,800
 what else are you making up?

221
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,920
 - Well, Randolph, I would say to you

222
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,800
 that if you go back and listen to the very start

223
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,640
 of that podcast,

224
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,520
 'cause this was one of our compilations,

225
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,820
 it says here are things that didn't make it in the show

226
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,520
 because we got the facts wrong.

227
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,360
 - Ah.

228
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,200
 - Does it say that?

229
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,020
 - It does, yeah.

230
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,080
 - So it's sort of a catch-all.

231
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,340
 - It's because his compilation didn't go into an episode.

232
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:19,260
 'Cause I obviously knew that I made that mistake.

233
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,400
 - 'Cause I will say, Randolph,

234
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,600
 that you're in good company.

235
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,680
 This is probably one of the things

236
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,320
 we've received more emails about

237
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,180
 than a lot of other things lately.

238
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,260
 So I didn't realize you were just pumping out wrong facts

239
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:29,100
 in our compilations.

240
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,500
 - God, I must feature heavily in that.

241
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,720
 - The thing is that the entire fact was correct

242
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,400
 'cause it was about sign language and stuff,

243
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,040
 but it was a very slight error in the middle of it,

244
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,880
 just why I was referring to you put the wrong,

245
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,420
 I was just going off memory about where these places were,

246
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:47,060
 got it mistaken with a space needle, very easily done.

247
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,740
 But yeah, we kept it in the compilation.

248
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:52,180
 But then the compilation is not canon, I suppose,

249
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,500
 like that Teenage Mutant Ninja set.

250
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,340
 - It's not canon.

251
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,180
 It's not canon.

252
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:59,240
 Like the anal octopus inside the rat.

253
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,340
 - So Krang is actually a brain, I should say,

254
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:04,140
 inside a robot.

255
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,620
 - Okay, we can't open ourselves up

256
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:06,900
 to corrections of corrections.

257
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,180
 (all laughing)

258
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:11,060
 - We will disappear up our own sphincters.

259
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:11,900
 (all laughing)

260
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:15,660
 - But yeah, that was genuinely just a screw up.

261
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:18,100
 - I completely didn't remember who said that.

262
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,580
 I was hoping one of you would smoke yourselves out

263
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:22,140
 or that I would be found to have said the thing.

264
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:24,020
 (all laughing)

265
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:24,900
 - What else have we got?

266
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,660
 - Well, there's one more thing, it's slightly longer.

267
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,180
 So it's from Laura Markowitz.

268
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:30,580
 And I'll just, you know, I'll do sort of a slight praisey,

269
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,100
 but it's about the episode,

270
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,580
 No Such Thing as a Magnetic Skateboard,

271
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,420
 which is quite recent.

272
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:37,420
 And we were saying, when did the queen last jump?

273
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:38,260
 Or was there any footage?

274
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,100
 Okay.

275
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,260
 - So this was you who said it, yeah.

276
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,100
 - Well, Laura says,

277
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:45,100
 while I don't have a photo of the queen jumping,

278
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,540
 so ready, we're off to a tangent railway line.

279
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,300
 - A queen, is that what she's gonna go with?

280
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,220
 - No, there are photos of the Duke and Duchess

281
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,900
 of Windsor jumping.

282
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,380
 - Which ones are they?

283
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,860
 - The abdicates.

284
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,620
 - Oh, right, not the current ones.

285
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,460
 - No, no, no, not the current ones.

286
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:00,700
 'Cause this is from 1955, give or take.

287
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,220
 - Jumping on the ship to Hotfooted America.

288
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,780
 (all laughing)

289
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,500
 - Let's bring this out of our mouth.

290
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,900
 - You should get Philippe Halsman's jump book.

291
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,100
 I think it is out of print, but you can get it used.

292
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,020
 - Philippe Halsman was a celebrity portrait photographer

293
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:16,340
 who, in the 1950s, started asking his subjects to jump

294
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:18,180
 and then photograph them in midair.

295
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,020
 - Oh, great.

296
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:22,660
 - The book contains a collection of 191 celebrity jumps,

297
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:25,100
 such as Marilyn Monroe, Richard Nixon,

298
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,180
 Robert Oppenheimer, and many others,

299
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,620
 including the Duke and Duchess of Windsor.

300
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,620
 - Robert Oppenheimer more like, am I right?

301
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:33,060
 (all clapping)

302
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,100
 - That's why we thought we'd better do this bonus bit.

303
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,220
 (all laughing)

304
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,860
 - Stop with that, you gotta get it out of the system.

305
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:39,700
 - That's the most.

306
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,740
 - One thing that happened immediately after that episode

307
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,300
 went out, I don't know if you saw it on Twitter,

308
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,340
 but we got lots of tweets coming into us

309
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:47,380
 because a trailer had just been released

310
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,100
 for a documentary about the queen

311
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,940
 in which the trailer footage of the queen is jumping.

312
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,380
 - No, no. - That's true, that's amazing.

313
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,620
 - I think she's doing a skip rope

314
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,420
 or maybe she's just jumping, yeah.

315
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,420
 - Oh, as a child?

316
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,260
 - No, no, she's--

317
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,620
 - She's doing a skipping rope, about a 99-year-old.

318
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,460
 - Yeah, it was for the Diamond Jubilee.

319
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:05,580
 They released some footage of her, yeah.

320
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,060
 - I think that was the holograph, surely.

321
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:09,660
 - No, no, it was as a child, I think.

322
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,940
 - I thought she was-- - But as a young as well.

323
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,020
 But someone sent in a later bit of evidence

324
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:16,860
 from, I think, about 1970 of her jumping

325
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:20,860
 and she's jumping off a boat onto a key or something.

326
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:21,700
 - Oh, yeah.

327
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,100
 - I'll just tell you the last bit of Laura's email

328
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,740
 'cause it's quite interesting, it's about this book.

329
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,780
 - Amazing book. - Testament eventually developed

330
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:29,220
 a playful hypothesis that during the act of a jump,

331
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,620
 a person's social mask would fall away

332
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:34,300
 and you could see their true character underneath.

333
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,020
 And the book includes this interpretation

334
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,340
 of various styles of jumping

335
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:39,180
 and what they reveal about the person

336
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,260
 on at least two occasions,

337
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,700
 Houseman was able to predict which politician

338
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,660
 would win his party's nomination

339
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:47,540
 based on how they responded to the request to jump.

340
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,860
 - That's amazing.

341
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,060
 'Cause I would have thought that,

342
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:53,820
 let's say the next election's Biden versus Trump again.

343
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,500
 I don't think Biden, Biden's a bit like

344
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,060
 the 90-year-old queen, right?

345
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,860
 He's gonna struggle to jump.

346
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,860
 - Yeah. - But then Trump might not jump.

347
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,020
 - White man can't jump.

348
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:06,300
 (laughing)

349
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,380
 - Do you know that Joe Biden

350
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:10,020
 is older than Dialysis Machines?

351
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,660
 - See. - He would still be allowed to,

352
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:12,980
 he would still be allowed to use one.

353
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:13,820
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

354
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:14,820
 - It's not a rule. - It's not a rule.

355
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,260
 - It's not as soon as they were invented,

356
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,580
 they were like, "Only babies!"

357
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,820
 (laughing)

358
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:22,460
 But yeah, that's just the thing.

359
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,780
 - Trump's not much younger, is he?

360
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:24,620
 - No, four years. - If we're doing

361
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,700
 the Trump and Biden versus Dialysis Machines.

362
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,860
 - I think Trump will be 78 by the time of the next day.

363
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:29,700
 - Yeah.

364
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:30,980
 Also, there's nothing wrong with it.

365
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:34,740
 I get a bit antsy about the old ageism against presidents.

366
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,060
 - Do you think that President Biden

367
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,020
 has ever used a Dialysis machine?

368
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:38,860
 - I believe not.

369
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,580
 - This is my attempt to try and start another.

370
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:41,420
 - There's a picture of him

371
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,460
 when he's getting on the boat,

372
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,820
 and he just needs that extra boost.

373
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:48,100
 - Oh, so thanks very much, Laura.

374
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,340
 - It sounds like a great book.

375
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,180
 - It sounds incredible.

376
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,260
 - I've just got one very last thing,

377
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:53,700
 and it's a bit more sort of related

378
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,460
 to the first fact we mentioned today.

379
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:58,820
 It's from Kevin D'Aliere, Chicago, hi Kevin.

380
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,140
 - So quite close to Canada.

381
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:00,980
 - Pretty close.

382
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:03,380
 (laughing)

383
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:05,180
 - I hope you're enjoying the lovely CN Tower

384
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,580
 that way you are in Chicago, Kevin.

385
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,460
 (laughing)

386
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:10,700
 Hello, so this is about the,

387
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,020
 we mentioned a few weeks ago, the Dave Matthews Band.

388
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:13,860
 - Oh yeah.

389
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,580
 - Going over the King Street Bridge.

390
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,620
 - Oh, of course, yeah, yeah.

391
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:20,020
 - And dumping all of their liquid fecal matter

392
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:22,460
 through the bridge, which is a grill, a grate,

393
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:25,420
 and it landed on an open top tourist boat

394
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,700
 that was passing underneath the bridge.

395
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,940
 Okay, just a very brief one from Kevin.

396
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,060
 Hello, just wanted to share

397
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,340
 that the Dave Matthews incident

398
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:34,620
 is still so prominent here in Chicago

399
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,980
 that it's used to slam shitty movies.

400
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:40,220
 He attaches an excerpt from the Chicago Sun Times,

401
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:42,540
 review of the new Jurassic World film.

402
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:45,060
 (laughing)

403
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,820
 Which features the phrase,

404
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:49,940
 "This is 2 hours and 27 minutes of pure dinosaur droppings,

405
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:52,140
 "and the viewer is as helpless as a boat

406
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:55,940
 "passing under a bridge on the Chicago River

407
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:59,220
 "as the Dave Matthews Band unloads a torrent

408
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,580
 "of foul waste from above."

409
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,900
 - What?

410
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:03,740
 That's amazing.

411
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,980
 I'm just watching, reading that as a non-Chicago.

412
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:06,820
 (laughing)

413
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,100
 There's similes they use in Chicago, pretty, yeah?

414
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,140
 (laughing)

415
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:10,980
 - Four stars.

416
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:13,340
 (laughing)

417
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:14,620
 That's amazing.

418
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,220
 Are you gonna wrap us up?

419
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,460
 - All right, thanks, bye.

420
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:19,860
 (laughing)

421
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:20,820
 All right, everyone, thanks for listening

422
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:23,260
 to this first iteration of Drop As A Line.

423
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:26,300
 If you want to let us know any extra information

424
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:29,380
 or clarifications or complaints or whatever,

425
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,740
 then why not Drop As A Line?

426
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,420
 And also, if you think of a better title,

427
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,260
 you Drop As A Line.

428
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,400
 (laughing)

429
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,240
 Bye.

430
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,820
 (upbeat music)

431
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,400
 (upbeat music)

432
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,980
 (upbeat music)

433
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,680
 (upbeat music)

434
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,260
 (upbeat music)
