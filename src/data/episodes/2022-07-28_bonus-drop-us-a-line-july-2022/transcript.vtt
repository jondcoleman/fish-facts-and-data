00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.920
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:03.760
 - Hi, guys.

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.120
 - Hi there, Andy.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.100
 - Welcome to Club Fish.

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.240
 Anna, we have to address the listener as well as each other.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.920
 - Oh my God, are there listeners?

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:12.760
 - I'm afraid so.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.040
 - Wow, somebody just told me that a while ago.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.800
 All right, listeners, welcome to Club Fish.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.200
 What is Club Fish?

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.000
 Well, it's the secret exclusive VIP lounge

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.880
 that we've just given you access to.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.080
 What does it offer? Snacks?

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.480
 - So many snacks.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.320
 - Right.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.400
 - We still have to provide you your own actual snacks, but.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.520
 (laughing)

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.120
 - No, what it is, is we get so many amazing emails

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.160
 from all of you guys, and we have done over the years,

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.920
 whether that's emails saying here's a bizarre, obscure fact

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.120
 on mollusks, 'cause I'm the world expert,

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.120
 or whether it's emails saying that thing

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.000
 that Dan said last week, that was stupid.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.240
 We love them all equally.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.000
 - A full range from, I know more about you on this,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.080
 to I know more about Dan on this.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.960
 And we thought we genuinely get so much brilliant correspondence

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.600
 that it was time to hand over to you, the listeners,

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.600
 and record a little bonus section

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.160
 with all of your correspondence.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.160
 - Although, if someone made a mistake of allowing Andy

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.480
 to host it, so the next voice you will be hearing,

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.160
 I'm afraid, it's still going to be Andrew Hunter Murray's.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.680
 - It's provisionally called Drop as a Line.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.000
 - Drop as a Line.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:24.160
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.760
 (upbeat music)

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.040
 - Hello, this is Drop as a Line,

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.560
 which is the bit where we hear from fish listeners

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.040
 who often send in facts, which are more interesting

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.840
 than the ones we talked about, or corrections,

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:38.960
 which are more accurate than the things

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.200
 we talked about on the show.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.760
 So we might as well just kick off

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.400
 with a few emails from listeners.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.640
 - Yeah, go after it, what we got?

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.280
 - Well, which do you want first?

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.440
 Do you want a correction, or do you want bonus info?

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.600
 - Oh, I don't want to be hit so quickly in the show.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.480
 Obviously a correction for me, let's do a--

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.880
 - Okay, we can do a bit of bonus info.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.480
 Cast your minds back to episode 311.

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.480
 - Oh yeah, I remember it well.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.520
 - It's about two and a half years ago now,

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.280
 but look, Laura Dunlop from Calgary in Alberta, Canada

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.640
 has written in, just listening to episode 311

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.720
 about dog shows and poop and such.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.800
 - Oh yeah, awesome. - We did talk about this.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.240
 All right, here we go.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.240
 To stop a dog from pooping in the ring,

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.400
 the handlers can tell when a dog has to go--

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.600
 - Wait a minute, why are they at this boxing fight?

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.800
 (laughing)

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.160
 What do you mean pooping in the ring?

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.840
 - Oh, sorry, dog show, dog show ring.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.180
 - Oh, right, okay. - You're doing it.

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.120
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.720
 Sorry, to stop a dog from pooping in the ring,

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.600
 off the dog show, the handlers can tell

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.040
 when a dog has to go because of the size of their sphincter.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.000
 It looks larger when they have to go,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.560
 so to stop an accident from happening,

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.360
 they put the sulfur end of a match in the anus--

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.560
 - No, they don't. - Which immediately

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.000
 makes the dog defecate before entering the ring.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.920
 I worked with a woman who had her dogs in shows,

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.920
 and she told me that is how they do it.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.120
 The more you know, and then a rainbow emoji from Laura.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.720
 - How many dogs are set on fire before crafts

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.480
 that we've never seen?

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:59.320
 - That is incredible.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.160
 I have a related fact on that,

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.160
 and that is that doctors can tell if you have a fistula

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.960
 in that area of your body by testing

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.320
 if you have an anal wink.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.360
 - Oh, sexy. - And that is exactly

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.720
 what it sounds like. (laughing)

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.280
 Uranus winks at them when they do a little kind of--

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.760
 - That's so funny, it's floating.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.720
 - Hang on, you do a tickle and it closes.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.000
 - It closes slightly, yeah.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.080
 - Is it not supposed to do that?

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.920
 - No, it does, and if it doesn't do that,

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:27.760
 that means that you--

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.040
 - Oh, so you meant to have a--

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.920
 - You're supposed to have an anal wink, yeah.

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.120
 - I'm actually testing now if I think I have an anal wink.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.840
 (laughing)

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.320
 - I saw a great tweet the other day

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.200
 from someone called Octopus Caveman,

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.520
 @OctopusCaveman, who wrote,

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.480
 "My son told me he learned that octopuses

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.520
 "can climb through small cracks,

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.080
 "so he's scared to swim in the ocean

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.520
 "because an octopus might climb inside his butt,

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.080
 "and now I'm scared to swim in the ocean."

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.560
 - So here's the thing, octopuses can go through small cracks.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.400
 - Yeah.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.120
 - But they can't go through anything

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.160
 that's smaller than their eye.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.000
 - Or their beak eye? - 'Cause there's an eye

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.840
 that doesn't change.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.840
 - Presumably the size of an octopus's eye or beak changes

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:02.960
 with the size of the octopus.

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.480
 - Yeah, so if you see a tiny octopus with a small eye

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.960
 or a small beak, then you might be scared,

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.080
 but if it's a nice big sort of crackin' like one,

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.920
 you're okay, it's not gonna get any--

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.240
 - You're okay, you got other issues

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:13.080
 if you see a crackin'.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.920
 (laughing)

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.760
 - And all that means is that

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.240
 you've got much more to be scared of,

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.480
 because if you can't see an octopus that's so big

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.160
 it can't climb inside your bottom,

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.680
 then you might not be seeing the octopus,

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.240
 which is small enough that it could.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.880
 - But then, if an octopus is that small,

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.040
 do you even mind it going in your bottom?

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.240
 - I think I would, that might be a problem.

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.240
 - 'Cause they're so intelligent,

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.280
 I would fear some sort of power-sharing arrangement

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.120
 that we might not want to.

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.680
 - You think they start a revolution then?

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:36.520
 - We look like a ventriloquist.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:37.640
 - Like a takeover bit, basically.

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.080
 We don't know how many people around the world

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.120
 are just octopuses.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.520
 - So you know that bad guy in "Teenage Recent Ninja Turtles"?

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:43.360
 - Shredder.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.720
 - There's one who kind of is a little octopus

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.600
 that lives in his chest.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.060
 He went in through the anus.

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.900
 (laughing)

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:50.740
 - Interesting.

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.400
 - That's part of the official "Teenage Recent" canon.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.400
 That's canon stuff, 'cause I love that episode.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.120
 (laughing)

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.360
 - Sorry, what was the fact again?

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.520
 Oh, it's about dog shows, isn't it?

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.000
 - They put a match in a dog's bottom.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.200
 - Wasn't there, I think there was one recently

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.800
 that went viral, where a dog pooed

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.440
 in the middle of a dog show, wasn't there?

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.760
 - There was, well, that's because clearly they hadn't-

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.960
 - They hadn't checked the ring to save the ring.

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.480
 Check the ring to save the ring.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:15.760
 (laughing)

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:16.600
 Every dog owner's mantra.

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.440
 - There are big posters up at Crofts, aren't there?

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.160
 So check the ring to save the ring.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.500
 - If the conservative party was in charge of Crofts,

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.600
 'cause they're always loving their slogans, aren't they?

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:25.440
 (laughing)

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:26.280
 - Yeah, for that.

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.800
 - I'd love if there was a close-up shot

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.460
 just before the dog took the shit

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:30.960
 and its anus winked at the camera.

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.680
 (laughing)

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.680
 - Like Ann Robinson, the weakest link.

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.440
 (laughing)

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:38.280
 - God.

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.220
 - Well, thank you, Laura.

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:42.060
 (laughing)

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:43.740
 That was incredibly helpful.

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.220
 And you slightly regret starting on such an anus, you won,

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:47.460
 but I think that's good.

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.300
 - Well, that's what we did on the actual podcast.

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:50.680
 - Remember, the first facts were,

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.740
 well, the first facts was about Garfield's anus.

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:53.580
 - Yeah, that's right.

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:54.420
 - Starts, do you mean to go on?

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:55.880
 - All right, well, I've now got a choice for you

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.300
 of a bonus info or the correction.

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.300
 It's still the same correction as before.

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:01.140
 - Let's go with corrections.

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:01.980
 - Corrections, yeah, we can take it.

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:02.920
 - I don't know who the perp is actually on this one.

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.360
 All right.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.060
 This is from Randolph Peters.

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.480
 - Canada. - I don't like him already.

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:09.320
 - Also.

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:10.160
 - Wow.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:10.980
 - Also Canada.

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:11.820
 - What have you taken against?

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:13.100
 - Randolph or Peters?

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.040
 - Well, it's that he's going to correct his answer.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.760
 (laughing)

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.600
 - Also from Canada, I've just realized.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.480
 - Oh, Calgary Alberta?

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.780
 - Doesn't specify.

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:22.620
 - Probably.

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:23.820
 - Brett the Hitman Hortz from there as well.

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:25.640
 (laughing)

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.940
 - You'll find out what his beef is.

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:30.320
 The fact how I know he's Canadian

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:31.160
 from the substance of this.

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:32.000
 - Got it.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:32.820
 - Oh yeah.

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:33.660
 - Dear, no such thing.

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:36.100
 I'm trying to get my fellow Canadian friends

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:37.460
 to listen to the podcast,

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:42.460
 but when you relocate the CN Tower from Toronto to Seattle,

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:45.200
 you make my job almost impossible.

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:47.060
 Seattle Space Needle is 1/3 the size

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:48.920
 of our manhood metaphor,

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:51.680
 which is still the tallest free-standing tower

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:52.600
 in the Western Hemisphere.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.140
 So there, if we can't trust you on towers,

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:56.800
 what else are you making up?

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.920
 - Well, Randolph, I would say to you

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.800
 that if you go back and listen to the very start

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:02.640
 of that podcast,

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:04.520
 'cause this was one of our compilations,

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:06.820
 it says here are things that didn't make it in the show

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:08.520
 because we got the facts wrong.

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.360
 - Ah.

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:11.200
 - Does it say that?

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:12.020
 - It does, yeah.

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:14.080
 - So it's sort of a catch-all.

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:16.340
 - It's because his compilation didn't go into an episode.

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:19.260
 'Cause I obviously knew that I made that mistake.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:20.400
 - 'Cause I will say, Randolph,

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:21.600
 that you're in good company.

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:22.680
 This is probably one of the things

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:24.320
 we've received more emails about

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:26.180
 than a lot of other things lately.

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:28.260
 So I didn't realize you were just pumping out wrong facts

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:29.100
 in our compilations.

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:31.500
 - God, I must feature heavily in that.

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:33.720
 - The thing is that the entire fact was correct

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:36.400
 'cause it was about sign language and stuff,

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.040
 but it was a very slight error in the middle of it,

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.880
 just why I was referring to you put the wrong,

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:43.420
 I was just going off memory about where these places were,

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:47.060
 got it mistaken with a space needle, very easily done.

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:48.740
 But yeah, we kept it in the compilation.

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:52.180
 But then the compilation is not canon, I suppose,

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:53.500
 like that Teenage Mutant Ninja set.

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:54.340
 - It's not canon.

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:55.180
 It's not canon.

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:59.240
 Like the anal octopus inside the rat.

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:01.340
 - So Krang is actually a brain, I should say,

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:04.140
 inside a robot.

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:05.620
 - Okay, we can't open ourselves up

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:06.900
 to corrections of corrections.

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:09.180
 (all laughing)

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:11.060
 - We will disappear up our own sphincters.

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:11.900
 (all laughing)

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:15.660
 - But yeah, that was genuinely just a screw up.

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:18.100
 - I completely didn't remember who said that.

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:19.580
 I was hoping one of you would smoke yourselves out

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:22.140
 or that I would be found to have said the thing.

00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:24.020
 (all laughing)

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:24.900
 - What else have we got?

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:26.660
 - Well, there's one more thing, it's slightly longer.

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:28.180
 So it's from Laura Markowitz.

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:30.580
 And I'll just, you know, I'll do sort of a slight praisey,

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:32.100
 but it's about the episode,

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:33.580
 No Such Thing as a Magnetic Skateboard,

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:34.420
 which is quite recent.

00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:37.420
 And we were saying, when did the queen last jump?

00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:38.260
 Or was there any footage?

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:39.100
 Okay.

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:41.260
 - So this was you who said it, yeah.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:42.100
 - Well, Laura says,

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:45.100
 while I don't have a photo of the queen jumping,

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:47.540
 so ready, we're off to a tangent railway line.

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:49.300
 - A queen, is that what she's gonna go with?

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:51.220
 - No, there are photos of the Duke and Duchess

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:52.900
 of Windsor jumping.

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:54.380
 - Which ones are they?

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:55.860
 - The abdicates.

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:57.620
 - Oh, right, not the current ones.

00:08:57.620 --> 00:08:58.460
 - No, no, no, not the current ones.

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:00.700
 'Cause this is from 1955, give or take.

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:03.220
 - Jumping on the ship to Hotfooted America.

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:04.780
 (all laughing)

00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:06.500
 - Let's bring this out of our mouth.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:08.900
 - You should get Philippe Halsman's jump book.

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:11.100
 I think it is out of print, but you can get it used.

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:13.020
 - Philippe Halsman was a celebrity portrait photographer

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:16.340
 who, in the 1950s, started asking his subjects to jump

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:18.180
 and then photograph them in midair.

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:19.020
 - Oh, great.

00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:22.660
 - The book contains a collection of 191 celebrity jumps,

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:25.100
 such as Marilyn Monroe, Richard Nixon,

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:27.180
 Robert Oppenheimer, and many others,

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:28.620
 including the Duke and Duchess of Windsor.

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:30.620
 - Robert Oppenheimer more like, am I right?

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:33.060
 (all clapping)

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:35.100
 - That's why we thought we'd better do this bonus bit.

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:37.220
 (all laughing)

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:38.860
 - Stop with that, you gotta get it out of the system.

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:39.700
 - That's the most.

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:41.740
 - One thing that happened immediately after that episode

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:43.300
 went out, I don't know if you saw it on Twitter,

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:45.340
 but we got lots of tweets coming into us

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:47.380
 because a trailer had just been released

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:49.100
 for a documentary about the queen

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:50.940
 in which the trailer footage of the queen is jumping.

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:53.380
 - No, no. - That's true, that's amazing.

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:54.620
 - I think she's doing a skip rope

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:56.420
 or maybe she's just jumping, yeah.

00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:57.420
 - Oh, as a child?

00:09:57.420 --> 00:09:58.260
 - No, no, she's--

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.620
 - She's doing a skipping rope, about a 99-year-old.

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:02.460
 - Yeah, it was for the Diamond Jubilee.

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:05.580
 They released some footage of her, yeah.

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:07.060
 - I think that was the holograph, surely.

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:09.660
 - No, no, it was as a child, I think.

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:11.940
 - I thought she was-- - But as a young as well.

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:14.020
 But someone sent in a later bit of evidence

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:16.860
 from, I think, about 1970 of her jumping

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:20.860
 and she's jumping off a boat onto a key or something.

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:21.700
 - Oh, yeah.

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:23.100
 - I'll just tell you the last bit of Laura's email

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:24.740
 'cause it's quite interesting, it's about this book.

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:26.780
 - Amazing book. - Testament eventually developed

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:29.220
 a playful hypothesis that during the act of a jump,

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:31.620
 a person's social mask would fall away

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:34.300
 and you could see their true character underneath.

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:36.020
 And the book includes this interpretation

00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:37.340
 of various styles of jumping

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:39.180
 and what they reveal about the person

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:40.260
 on at least two occasions,

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.700
 Houseman was able to predict which politician

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:44.660
 would win his party's nomination

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:47.540
 based on how they responded to the request to jump.

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:48.860
 - That's amazing.

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:50.060
 'Cause I would have thought that,

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:53.820
 let's say the next election's Biden versus Trump again.

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:56.500
 I don't think Biden, Biden's a bit like

00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:58.060
 the 90-year-old queen, right?

00:10:58.060 --> 00:10:59.860
 He's gonna struggle to jump.

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:02.860
 - Yeah. - But then Trump might not jump.

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:04.020
 - White man can't jump.

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:06.300
 (laughing)

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:07.380
 - Do you know that Joe Biden

00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:10.020
 is older than Dialysis Machines?

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:11.660
 - See. - He would still be allowed to,

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:12.980
 he would still be allowed to use one.

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:13.820
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:14.820
 - It's not a rule. - It's not a rule.

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:16.260
 - It's not as soon as they were invented,

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:17.580
 they were like, "Only babies!"

00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:19.820
 (laughing)

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:22.460
 But yeah, that's just the thing.

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:23.780
 - Trump's not much younger, is he?

00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:24.620
 - No, four years. - If we're doing

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:26.700
 the Trump and Biden versus Dialysis Machines.

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:28.860
 - I think Trump will be 78 by the time of the next day.

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:29.700
 - Yeah.

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:30.980
 Also, there's nothing wrong with it.

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:34.740
 I get a bit antsy about the old ageism against presidents.

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:36.060
 - Do you think that President Biden

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:38.020
 has ever used a Dialysis machine?

00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:38.860
 - I believe not.

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:40.580
 - This is my attempt to try and start another.

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:41.420
 - There's a picture of him

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:42.460
 when he's getting on the boat,

00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:44.820
 and he just needs that extra boost.

00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:48.100
 - Oh, so thanks very much, Laura.

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:49.340
 - It sounds like a great book.

00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:50.180
 - It sounds incredible.

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:51.260
 - I've just got one very last thing,

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.700
 and it's a bit more sort of related

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:55.460
 to the first fact we mentioned today.

00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:58.820
 It's from Kevin D'Aliere, Chicago, hi Kevin.

00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:00.140
 - So quite close to Canada.

00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:00.980
 - Pretty close.

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:03.380
 (laughing)

00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:05.180
 - I hope you're enjoying the lovely CN Tower

00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:06.580
 that way you are in Chicago, Kevin.

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:08.460
 (laughing)

00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:10.700
 Hello, so this is about the,

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:13.020
 we mentioned a few weeks ago, the Dave Matthews Band.

00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:13.860
 - Oh yeah.

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:15.580
 - Going over the King Street Bridge.

00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:16.620
 - Oh, of course, yeah, yeah.

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:20.020
 - And dumping all of their liquid fecal matter

00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:22.460
 through the bridge, which is a grill, a grate,

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:25.420
 and it landed on an open top tourist boat

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:27.700
 that was passing underneath the bridge.

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:29.940
 Okay, just a very brief one from Kevin.

00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:31.060
 Hello, just wanted to share

00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:32.340
 that the Dave Matthews incident

00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:34.620
 is still so prominent here in Chicago

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:36.980
 that it's used to slam shitty movies.

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:40.220
 He attaches an excerpt from the Chicago Sun Times,

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:42.540
 review of the new Jurassic World film.

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:45.060
 (laughing)

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:46.820
 Which features the phrase,

00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:49.940
 "This is 2 hours and 27 minutes of pure dinosaur droppings,

00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:52.140
 "and the viewer is as helpless as a boat

00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:55.940
 "passing under a bridge on the Chicago River

00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:59.220
 "as the Dave Matthews Band unloads a torrent

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:01.580
 "of foul waste from above."

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:02.900
 - What?

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:03.740
 That's amazing.

00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:05.980
 I'm just watching, reading that as a non-Chicago.

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:06.820
 (laughing)

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:09.100
 There's similes they use in Chicago, pretty, yeah?

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:10.140
 (laughing)

00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:10.980
 - Four stars.

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:13.340
 (laughing)

00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:14.620
 That's amazing.

00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:16.220
 Are you gonna wrap us up?

00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:17.460
 - All right, thanks, bye.

00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:19.860
 (laughing)

00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:20.820
 All right, everyone, thanks for listening

00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:23.260
 to this first iteration of Drop As A Line.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:26.300
 If you want to let us know any extra information

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:29.380
 or clarifications or complaints or whatever,

00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:31.740
 then why not Drop As A Line?

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:33.420
 And also, if you think of a better title,

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:34.260
 you Drop As A Line.

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:35.400
 (laughing)

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:36.240
 Bye.

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:38.820
 (upbeat music)

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:41.400
 (upbeat music)

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:43.980
 (upbeat music)

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:46.680
 (upbeat music)

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:49.260
 (upbeat music)
