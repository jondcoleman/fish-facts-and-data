1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 We run it on QI a few years ago.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:02,540
 Yeah.

3
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:04,580
 Which was, there's no such thing as a fish.

4
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:05,840
 You did a nice, such thing as a fish.

5
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:09,940
 No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life.

6
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:12,840
 He says it, ride that first paragraph, no such thing as a fish.

7
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:23,560
 Hello, welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

8
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:26,320
 to you from the QI offices in Covern Garden.

9
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,320
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

10
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,920
 I'm sitting here with Andy Murray, James Parkin, and Anna Chazinsky.

11
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,180
 And once again, we've gathered around the microphone with our four favorite facts on the

12
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:35,180
 last seven days.

13
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:38,020
 So here we go, in no particular order, let's do it.

14
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:42,460
 James, back number one.

15
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:48,820
 My fact this week is that in the 17th century, there was a prophet called Dorothy Harling,

16
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:53,340
 who would kill you of your sins by urinating on the afflicted part of your body.

17
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:54,340
 Wow.

18
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:57,620
 When you've got a sin, what was the afflicted part of your body?

19
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,900
 Well, if you'd been swearing, it could be your mouth.

20
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:00,900
 Right.

21
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:01,900
 Yeah.

22
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,900
 If you'd stolen something, it could be your hands, I guess.

23
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:04,900
 Okay.

24
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:08,260
 If you'd thought a dirty thought, your brain would piss in your ear.

25
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:09,420
 Into your ear.

26
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:10,740
 She would whip people first.

27
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,380
 She would whip you first to try and get rid of the sins and then she'd urinate on you.

28
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:17,060
 And she was known as the permanent spring.

29
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:20,660
 This sounds more like a chapter from 50 Shades of Grey.

30
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:21,660
 Does it?

31
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:22,660
 Oh, yeah.

32
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:23,660
 Whipping.

33
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:26,300
 I mean, that's all very bondage-based activity.

34
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:31,220
 It wasn't uncommon to use urine in a weird medical way though, was it, in around that time

35
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:32,220
 in the 17th century.

36
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,220
 No.

37
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:38,220
 So they had people who would smell or look at the colour, or even sometimes the flavour of

38
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,660
 people's urine in order to diagnose disease.

39
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:43,660
 And they had, you know, those colour wheels you get.

40
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:45,980
 They had a urine wheel like pantone.

41
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:46,980
 Yeah.

42
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:47,980
 Exactly.

43
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,180
 And they had 20 different colours of urine around the edge of it.

44
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,180
 20 Shades of Pea.

45
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:58,420
 And so the end it was all to do with the humourism, whether you're four humour's were in order.

46
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,420
 But I think that would work.

47
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:02,260
 I think if your urine tasted sweet, then you might be diabetics.

48
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:03,860
 That's how they used to do that, right?

49
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:04,860
 Yeah.

50
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:05,860
 Doctors used to diagnose you that way.

51
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:09,780
 It was called Thomas Willis, the man who discovered it, and in 1674, he said that diabetic

52
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,780
 people's urine was wonderfully sweet as if it were imbued with honey or sugar.

53
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:18,020
 And it was called Willis's disease for a long time, diabetes, because of him discovering

54
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,020
 it.

55
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:25,020
 Plylly said that you could use urine for a whole bunch of ailments, but stale urine mixed

56
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,940
 with ash could be rubbed on your baby for nappy rash.

57
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:31,060
 Which sounds just like a really unpleasant way to be entering the world.

58
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:36,220
 I think there's like Mayan tablet or something like that that says this is about the patient.

59
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:41,460
 If all else fails, have him remove one sandal, urinate in it, and drink the urine.

60
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:45,580
 And this was if everything else in that the doctor prescribed didn't work, then that was

61
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,580
 the last thing you should try.

62
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:49,860
 Oh, sandals are they full of holes?

63
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:50,860
 Good point.

64
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:53,740
 I don't know how I would retain lipid in my sandals.

65
00:02:53,740 --> 00:03:00,140
 So actually drinking urine has been thought by quacks for centuries as being a way of solving

66
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,500
 any problems that you have.

67
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:06,700
 I think we mentioned it on QI, that, and we have a website address that we bought called

68
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:12,740
 drinkmyurin.co.uk, and if you go on to that, then it takes you to the QI website.

69
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:18,060
 And what that means is because we still own it, all of the QI.com URLs can also be written

70
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,460
 as drinkmyurin.co.uk.

71
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:26,660
 So if you go on to drinkmyurin.co.uk/podcast, you'll find our podcast page.

72
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:32,340
 Speaking of drinking urine, there's so many people of Scandinavia and Northern Scandinavia.

73
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:35,620
 People thought for ages that they would feed magic mushrooms to their reindeer, and then

74
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,100
 they would drink their reindeer here.

75
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,100
 Oh, I agree with that.

76
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,100
 Yeah.

77
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,260
 So, and then they get high off magic mushrooms, but without getting the poisonous effect

78
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:44,660
 and vomiting, which is what happens if you eat them directly, if you eat too much.

79
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:48,700
 And then this anthropologist came along and debunked this whole thing and said the Sami

80
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,740
 people did not drink reindeer urine.

81
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:54,740
 And then he went and interviewed a Sami person, so he wrote a whole book about how they don't,

82
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:58,380
 and then he met some Sami people and they were like, "Yeah, we do this all the time."

83
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,380
 Oh, no.

84
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,140
 So we had to write another book saying, "Actually."

85
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,140
 Oh, no.

86
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,140
 They do it.

87
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:05,740
 I read a thing about the coriac people in Siberia.

88
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:12,060
 They would take us sort of hallucinogenic psychedelic mushroom, and the mushroom would send them insane

89
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,780
 into like a beautiful psychedelic thing.

90
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:18,540
 The problem was it's quite expensive, and so it has a thing in it where when you urinate

91
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:23,340
 it doesn't dilute the hallucinogenic in it, and so basically it comes out just as strong,

92
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:26,060
 just slightly diluted from the initial thing that you're taking.

93
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:30,380
 So the people who couldn't afford to take the mushroom would buy the urine off the people

94
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:33,020
 who just had a trip so that they could then have that.

95
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:36,380
 So in Siberia, Russia, they used to, if you had chewing gum, you would chew it, and so you

96
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:40,380
 didn't have the taste anymore, and then you'd pass that onto someone else to have the remnants

97
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,380
 of the taste?

98
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,380
 Why?

99
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,380
 Because it was so rare.

100
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,380
 But if there was no taste left?

101
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:48,140
 Yeah, but I think I'm right in saying your mouth kind of gets used to the taste, so there's

102
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,140
 still some left.

103
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,500
 It does, and that's why there's always room for pudding.

104
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:56,900
 It's called sensory-specific satiety, SSS, and if you are really full of your main course,

105
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:00,140
 you think, "Oh, I can't eat any more of this," whatever it is, you're having risotto.

106
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:02,900
 And then someone says, "Hey, how about a proffittoral?"

107
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:07,260
 Your taste buds perk up, and you think, "Oh, wait, maybe I can squeeze in a bit more food,

108
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,260
 because it's a different flavor."

109
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,260
 It's a different flavor, right?

110
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,260
 Okay.

111
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,260
 I got a good urine fact.

112
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:16,060
 Well, it turns out that we urinate 50% more than we drink per day.

113
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,380
 How could that be?

114
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:18,380
 That's what I thought.

115
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,620
 Because you're breathing in water vapor.

116
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,740
 No, it's because all the foods that get broken down, there's lots of water in foods.

117
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:23,740
 Oh, that's awesome.

118
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,740
 Yeah.

119
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:25,740
 That's amazing.

120
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:26,740
 Yeah, that is good.

121
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:27,740
 Hold on.

122
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:28,740
 Thanks.

123
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:35,180
 I thought it was going to be because we are half yetis, and yetis are the little dita.

124
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:42,060
 The first obscenity law in England was in 1663, when poet Sir Charles Sedley got too drunk,

125
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:46,060
 shouted, "Blasphemous things from a balcony in Covent Garden, and urinated on the crowd

126
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,060
 below."

127
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,060
 Oh.

128
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:51,860
 And that was also the last law written in Norman French in the UK.

129
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:52,860
 Wow.

130
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:53,860
 That's it.

131
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:54,860
 Yeah.

132
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:55,860
 That's a nice coincidence.

133
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,860
 We should get a balcony.

134
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:02,580
 And Sigmund Freud viewed urinating in public as a sign of strong subconscious ambition.

135
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:03,580
 Oh, did he?

136
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:04,580
 Yeah.

137
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:08,100
 And if that's true, Central London on a Friday night is one of the most ambitious places in

138
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,580
 the world.

139
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:10,780
 I've got one more thing about you.

140
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:11,780
 Yeah.

141
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:12,780
 So, oh, which do you want?

142
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,780
 Do you want the one about rabbits or the one about the future?

143
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:15,780
 Oh, the future.

144
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:16,780
 The future.

145
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:21,480
 So, as well as these doctors who were genuinely trying to work out how you could use urine to

146
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:26,660
 diagnose disease, there were people who practiced the art of Euromency, which is the art

147
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:30,900
 of telling the future using urine, and they were also known as piss profits, a bit more

148
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:31,900
 vulgarly.

149
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:36,300
 But, they took omens from different signs in it, so some people took omens from the colour

150
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:42,620
 of the client's urine or from its taste, or they read the bubbles immediately after it

151
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:43,620
 hit the bowl.

152
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:47,260
 So, you would have to weigh in in the divination bowl.

153
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:50,940
 And if there were large bubbles spread out, you were about to come into money.

154
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,940
 There were small bubbles packed together.

155
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:56,860
 But it would be illness or someone who loved to die, and I know.

156
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:57,860
 Oh, no.

157
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,060
 So, it would die just because I'd peed bubbles.

158
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,820
 Small, packed together bubbles.

159
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:01,820
 Yes.

160
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:02,820
 Right.

161
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:03,820
 So, be careful.

162
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:04,820
 Can you imagine?

163
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:05,820
 Wow.

164
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:06,820
 Yeah.

165
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:07,820
 And it was very common in the 17th century.

166
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:12,420
 A lot of people slag them off, Ben Johnson, so that they were 30-facy, nasty-patey, lousy-farticle

167
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,420
 rogues.

168
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:15,020
 Famously mature, man.

169
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:22,340
 So, this young lady Dorothy Harling, she was thought to have been someone who was predicted

170
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:26,020
 in the book of revelations, or a lot of these people called French prophets who came over.

171
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,940
 They were hoganos, and they were them.

172
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:32,060
 They claimed that they were, you know, prophets from the Bible.

173
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,300
 But I just really like prophets.

174
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:37,140
 I like, you know, people who think that they're gods, or...

175
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,140
 Yeah.

176
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,140
 But I love this guy.

177
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,140
 There was a guy called Cooper.

178
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:43,140
 I remember his first name, and he was living in London.

179
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,540
 He was unemployed.

180
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:48,700
 And some of his friends, some of his Indian friends told him that he looked and moved just

181
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,380
 like an ancient Indian goddess.

182
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:53,620
 And he thought, "Oh, well, that sounds quite good."

183
00:07:53,620 --> 00:08:00,820
 Anyway, so he then went to Gujarat, and he claimed to be this ancient goddess in human form.

184
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:05,580
 And now he lives in a holy saffron robe, living among 80 eunuchs.

185
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:10,020
 Why didn't he say to his friends, "Okay, great, whatever, let's have another drink."

186
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,900
 Who takes their friends' comments on how they look that seriously?

187
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:13,900
 Yeah, but...

188
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:17,980
 Every time I saw my mum, I believe I was beautiful, if that was the way he used to be.

189
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:20,300
 Oh, you are beautiful, and I don't know.

190
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,300
 Well, thanks guys.

191
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:29,940
 Okay, time for fact number two, and that is Yulcha Zinski.

192
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:35,140
 So my fact is that, despite the fact that homosexuality is completely illegal in the south

193
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:40,060
 to Dan, a woman can have a female husband and a child can have a female father.

194
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:42,300
 Oh, how does that work?

195
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:47,540
 So it makes sense because it's true actually across parts of East Africa in various tribes,

196
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:52,620
 one of the tribes is the new air tribe, and if a woman is infertile, it's a way of herbing

197
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,460
 able to continue her family line.

198
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:58,820
 So this infertile woman has a father who wants to pass on property to a son or a grandson.

199
00:08:58,820 --> 00:08:59,820
 Right.

200
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:03,820
 So the infertile woman marries another woman, and then this other woman has a secret lover

201
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:08,860
 whom she has some sex with, gets pregnant, and then she has a child by that man, but that

202
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:13,500
 child is officially the child of the infertile woman and the other woman.

203
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:18,300
 And then everything like legal, societal, cultural rights, everything like that, it's all the

204
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:21,140
 same as if they were a normal husband and wife marriage.

205
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:26,200
 It's openly accepted that that's what's done, and it's enshrined in law, and there's this

206
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:30,940
 other weird thing as well, which is, I think this is another tribe in Kenya, it's the courier

207
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:33,500
 tribe, which is called daughter-in-law marriage.

208
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,300
 Wait, the courier tribe?

209
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:39,420
 The courier tribe, yeah, where they make the font, right?

210
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,620
 Yes indeed, and they just carry stuff back and forth.

211
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,420
 That's what I thought, yeah, they were delivering stuff.

212
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,420
 Yeah.

213
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,420
 They deliver babies.

214
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:50,380
 Oh no, the courier, K-U-R-I-A tribe, and they have this thing called daughter-in-law marriage

215
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:57,940
 where an infertile woman marries another woman, and then she gives as a wife the other woman

216
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,900
 to her fictitious son.

217
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:04,740
 So this woman doesn't have any sons, but she marries a woman and then donates that woman

218
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:10,460
 to her made-up son, and so that woman now counts as her daughter-in-law, and then that woman

219
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:13,660
 gets pregnant, and then that counts as her grandchild.

220
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:14,980
 It's a very confusing system.

221
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:19,780
 So it's like having your friend marry your imaginary friend?

222
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:25,740
 Yes, yes, exactly, because having a daughter-in-law is a sign of status in certain African tribes

223
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,820
 and again, confers certain cultural systems.

224
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:28,820
 It's pretty great.

225
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:29,820
 Oh my God, it's pretty great.

226
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:33,860
 There is problems if you can't have children yourself, but you want to keep their family

227
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:34,860
 line going.

228
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:35,860
 Yeah.

229
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:36,860
 It's ingenious.

230
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:40,420
 There are lots of women in Albania who live as men, aren't there?

231
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:42,460
 Yeah, is it a canoeing law or something like that?

232
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,460
 I think so, yeah.

233
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,980
 But actually, I say there are lots.

234
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:48,220
 There are very few now, because it's a very old custom, and most of the remaining ones

235
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:50,740
 are in their 70s, 80s or even 90s, so.

236
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:54,460
 But they simply live as men, so they dress as men, they live as men.

237
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:55,460
 And do they pretend that they are men?

238
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,460
 Or does everyone know that they're women, but they just say-

239
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:59,700
 I don't know, but they're a woman, but they have the status of a man.

240
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:04,100
 Yeah, all you have to do is dress as the man, and then people accept that you are.

241
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,100
 Yeah.

242
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,420
 And that's just a way society works.

243
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,420
 You don't marry.

244
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:10,220
 You're not allowed to marry, and you're known as a swan virgin, I think.

245
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,220
 That's right.

246
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,220
 Yeah, yeah.

247
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:16,100
 But you are officially a man, even though you're a celibate man, and you won't marry a woman.

248
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,100
 Okay.

249
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,100
 But you're unannounced.

250
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:22,620
 There is a canoeing law in Albania, and he says it's a very old fashion one, but I think

251
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:28,020
 there's one other thing, if I'm right, it's the same thing where, if your wife is having

252
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:32,500
 sex with another guy, you're allowed to kill them, but you have to kill them both at the

253
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:38,180
 same time with one bullet, and they have to be in the act at the time.

254
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,180
 Wow.

255
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,860
 Could you guys just line up there please?

256
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:41,860
 Yeah.

257
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:42,860
 It's still-

258
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:46,100
 I think that's a needlessly complicated work around.

259
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,260
 You could just say you're not allowed to murder anyone.

260
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,260
 Yes.

261
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,260
 It's a loophole, isn't it?

262
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,260
 It is a loophole.

263
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:54,260
 It almost sounds as if it happened once, and they went, "Oh no, no, it's legal.

264
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:57,020
 Do you not read those comments?"

265
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:59,020
 In France, you can marry dead people.

266
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,020
 Okay.

267
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:07,020
 It's called posthumous marriage, and the idea is that, say, I have a fiance, and she's

268
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:12,500
 going to inherit half of what I own, but then I die, legally, she'd have no right to it,

269
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:16,780
 so that, do the marriage after I've died, and then she legally is part of that family, and

270
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:19,220
 owns half of the oroms, all of their stuff.

271
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,220
 That makes sense.

272
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:25,900
 These are all ingenious solutions to the natural problems of life, and how it gets in the

273
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:26,900
 way of stability.

274
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:31,540
 The societal problems of life, mainly in the case of gender discrimination, and it's

275
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:35,620
 quite funny, the idea is that they really miss the point that women go to the lawmakers

276
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:39,820
 and say, "Oh, the gay people in Africa," and say, "We're really sick of this discrimination,

277
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:43,340
 and the lawmakers go, "Okay, we'll let you pretend to be a man."

278
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,340
 Does that solve the problem?

279
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,340
 It's like...

280
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,340
 No, not really.

281
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:50,100
 If the suffragettes had gone down that road, then we'd be living in a hundred percent

282
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,100
 male Britain today.

283
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,220
 All of you have the legal right to be men.

284
00:12:54,220 --> 00:13:00,220
 We were talking about France, a French wedding custom in the Overn region in certain villages.

285
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,700
 It's called La Routie.

286
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:04,820
 They have the wedding, and then the married couple then go after their bed chamber, and then

287
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:07,700
 it's traditional for the wedding guests to interrupt their bed chamber in the middle of

288
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:12,060
 the night, overturn their bed chamber, and then they fill up a chamber pot with all the

289
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:16,980
 leftover wine, champagne, food, sometimes toilet paper, apparently tampon soaked in tomato

290
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:22,780
 sauce, and they force the bride and groom to drink the contents of this chamber pot as

291
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:23,780
 a wedding ritual.

292
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:27,420
 It's boost to signify their intimacy of their future life together or something.

293
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,420
 Oh, wow.

294
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,420
 Yeah.

295
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,420
 Romantic, right?

296
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,060
 What a great way to ruin someone's wedding night.

297
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:35,460
 I'm definitely going to start doing that to my friends.

298
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:39,580
 Or they also fill up with champagne and chocolate, sometimes, which symbolises urine and

299
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,580
 feces.

300
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,580
 Yeah.

301
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:45,260
 I have a bit of a worry about champagne representing urine, because it has lots of bubbles

302
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:49,260
 in it, and presumably everyone's just going to die in a small pack together bubbles as

303
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,260
 well.

304
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,260
 Yeah.

305
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:55,500
 There's another wedding which I really want the verification of it, so if anyone belongs

306
00:13:55,500 --> 00:14:00,860
 to the Tidong tribe in Borneo who's listening to this podcast, or who knows of them, apparently,

307
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:05,780
 if you get married in this tribe, you're not allowed to urinate or defecate or wash for

308
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,940
 three days after you get married.

309
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:11,260
 And it's just on this one person's blog who went and hung out with the Tidong tribe, but

310
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,820
 I couldn't find reference to it anywhere else.

311
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,340
 So three days you have to hold it in.

312
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:15,340
 That's amazing.

313
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,340
 I admire that.

314
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:19,180
 There's been a problem with this, because if the Tidong tribe in Borneo, in the middle

315
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:22,740
 of the jungle are listening, how are they going to tell you because you're not on Twitter?

316
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:23,740
 That's a good point.

317
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:26,020
 I forgot that's the only way they communicate.

318
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:31,460
 Also, holding it in for three days just after a wedding is tough, because you drink a lot

319
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:32,460
 of the wedding.

320
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:33,460
 That's so true.

321
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:36,380
 And it's going to be the most unsavory after those three days.

322
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:41,540
 It's the least romantic way again to end them, as you both fighting your way to the toilet

323
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,660
 for an explosive session.

324
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:44,660
 Anyway.

325
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:47,900
 Have you heard of Bride Pie?

326
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:52,580
 This is an English wedding tradition, so you have wedding cake, everyone knows about that.

327
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:57,460
 But traditionally in the 17th, 18th centuries around that time, you would also have Bride

328
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,460
 Pie.

329
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:03,380
 And this is a savoury dish, and it had lots of little things in it, like cox combs, you

330
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:07,660
 know those, from a cockerel, or lamb's testicles, or goose giblets.

331
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:10,860
 This sounds like a very unsavory pie to me.

332
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:15,020
 There was one recipe for a Bride Pie in Robert Mays book, The Accomplished Cook, which

333
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:22,020
 included Veal Sweepbreds, Ox Tung's, A Pine of Oysters, Bacon, Chasnuts, Lemon Juice, Pickle

334
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:28,260
 Berry's Wine, A Life Snake for Entertainment purposes, More Oysters and an Onion.

335
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:34,020
 I always find my pies aren't entertaining, dear milk and mobré, I was most disappointed

336
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:38,460
 on getting to the end of my pie to find you had left out the Life Snake.

337
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:42,500
 Please, can you rectify this situation?

338
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:46,620
 Marriages in Sudan, do you remember that famous guy who married a goat?

339
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:47,620
 Oh, yeah.

340
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:48,620
 He had to, didn't he?

341
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,140
 He was helped by law.

342
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:56,180
 He was caught in the Clagrante Delector, and they said, "Well, in order to preserve the

343
00:15:56,180 --> 00:16:01,620
 honour of the goat who was called Rose, he had to marry her."

344
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:06,660
 And Rose, unfortunately, died about a year later after she swallowed a plastic bag.

345
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:09,420
 How convenient for a man.

346
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:14,140
 In India, people sometimes marry trees, don't they?

347
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,140
 Why would you marry a tree?

348
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:19,940
 It's an astrological thing, so in certain parts of India, you are manglic, if you're born

349
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:24,580
 on a certain day of the month, which means that astrologically you have bad luck and in

350
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:27,700
 marriage, it means that you'll likely be married to a lot of different husbands, either

351
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:31,780
 they'll die or you'll get divorced, and the way to counterbalance that is in a ceremony

352
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:38,460
 which is called arc-viva or cum-viva, where you marry a tree or an urn, and that's your

353
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:41,580
 first marriage, and so that means, and you do the full ceremony, and that means you've

354
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:44,620
 done marriage number one, now you can do marriage number two.

355
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:51,220
 And I think the former Miss World of 1990 was a tree, 1996, and she did this in, I think,

356
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:57,580
 2003 or 2004, because she was very superstitious, and she was born under this sign.

357
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:01,780
 And the idea is that after you get married, you then chop down the tree or smash the urn.

358
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:03,780
 Not to be recommended with genuine husbands.

359
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,540
 It's not bad for the tree though, yeah.

360
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:09,540
 And the tree's delight, you're going to marry a beautiful woman.

361
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:14,300
 It's the wedding night, I'm so excited.

362
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:23,940
 Excuse the guy with the eggs approach.

363
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:28,420
 Okay, time for fact number three, and that is my fact, my fact this week, it's a discovery

364
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:33,220
 that Tommy Flowers, the man who was responsible for the first ever, I guess the first ever

365
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:38,260
 computer you could call it, Colossus, which was designed during World War II, is that when

366
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:41,940
 they were pushing forward the idea that the Colossus should be made, it kept blowing up,

367
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:45,980
 because it was made of 100, 100, 500 different valves, kept blowing up every time they turned

368
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:49,220
 it on, and they said this can't work, and he was convinced it could work.

369
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:52,340
 He worked out that by turning it on and off, that that's what was blowing it up.

370
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:56,660
 So the first ever bit of IT advice was to not turn it off, then turn it back on again.

371
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:57,660
 That's brilliant.

372
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:58,660
 That's really funny.

373
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,180
 So this is Tommy Flowers.

374
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:03,020
 Tommy Flowers, yeah, Tommy Flowers used to work for the post office.

375
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:08,380
 So he designed this thing, he put it forward, they said no to it, after they said no to it,

376
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:11,980
 he solved the problem, and then they said no to it again, because it just took up too much

377
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:15,780
 space and it was going to take a year to make, so he just went ahead with it anyway, as a

378
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:20,900
 kind of half-secret project, which is an amazing half-secret project to have, because it was

379
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:24,100
 the size of a room in Bletchley.

380
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,180
 I don't know how you hide that, I don't know.

381
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:30,260
 Yeah, in Bletchley among people whose job it is to find out any secrets you might have.

382
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:33,180
 Literally the worst place in the world are trying to keep the secret.

383
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,180
 That's such a good boy.

384
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,180
 That's so funny.

385
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:38,620
 Well, we found that all this computer ever, well what's always cited as the oldest computer

386
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:46,020
 ever, was only discovered in, I think it was 1902, I want to say, anyway, early 20th Century,

387
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:51,020
 was that ancient Greek computer from the 2nd century BC, which is called the Antikythera.

388
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,020
 The Antikythera, yeah.

389
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:55,060
 Is that definitely a computer, do we think?

390
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:58,980
 Everyone always refers to it as a computer, so it's an unbelievably complex system of

391
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:03,620
 cogs, which if you spin a handle on it, which correctly show you the rotation of all the

392
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:07,100
 planets that have been discovered at the time, which has five planets, I think, and could

393
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:12,260
 predict a lunar eclipse and a solar eclipse, and they didn't make anything nearly as complicated

394
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:14,580
 as that for another 1,500 years or so.

395
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:19,000
 If anyone listening to this is thinking, oh, look into that later, Google it right now

396
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 while you remember.

397
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 Maybe after the show.

398
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 Or maybe after the show.

399
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,500
 Just press pause and check it out, because it's the most extraordinary looking item, and

400
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,140
 it's so out of place and time, that's the thing.

401
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:32,220
 You look at it, and it's like all those books that used to come out back in the 70s by Eric

402
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:35,760
 Von Daniken and stuff saying, oh, there were ancient batteries and stuff, and you look at

403
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,580
 it and you go, no, of course not, this is completely falsified.

404
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:39,580
 This is the real deal.

405
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:41,740
 This is a thing that just, it's so complicated.

406
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:42,740
 It is.

407
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:43,740
 It's insane.

408
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:44,740
 I'm calling it, I think that's a computer.

409
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:49,460
 They were computers used to refer to someone who just worked out when Easter was.

410
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,460
 Really?

411
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:54,180
 They would have a monk whose job it was to work out all the dates and all their feasts

412
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,180
 and stuff like that.

413
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:58,820
 They used to be in the main one and they were called computers.

414
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:02,300
 If you tried turning him off and then turning him back on again.

415
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:06,820
 I read that the Colossus was actually dismantled, a bunch of them were dismantled, I think eight

416
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:14,260
 of the ten, and all of the parts that made it up went into the spares of post office systems

417
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,260
 again.

418
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,260
 Really?

419
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:17,540
 So a large part, and apparently those are still being used today.

420
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:22,500
 So a large part of the postal service is still being used using parts from Colossus,

421
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,500
 the very first computer.

422
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,340
 It explains a lot.

423
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:30,100
 A couple of years ago at AQI Recording, we had some charity guests and one of the people

424
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:36,580
 I met there was he ran the computers which control a lot of trains all over the UK and

425
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:39,340
 he said they run on every system that you can imagine.

426
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:44,260
 There are still trains that are running on MS DOS in Britain today and there are ones

427
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:48,180
 which run on apples and when they first built the computing systems, a lot of the levers

428
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:52,340
 for the points changing and things like that, they used parts from old RAF planes and

429
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:56,380
 levers and things like that, amazingly cool, hodgepodge way of doing it.

430
00:20:56,380 --> 00:21:00,060
 The problem with that is of course that when you have things going wrong, you don't have

431
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:04,940
 the parts to replace them because there's such antiquated systems and also if you had someone

432
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:09,700
 who had to fix a computer system and it's written in some old code that no one does any

433
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,580
 more than your completely screwed.

434
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,180
 MS DOS is going to come back, James.

435
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,180
 Is it?

436
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,180
 C, colon slash slash.

437
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,180
 Yes.

438
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:21,540
 Do you know who wrote the, do you remember the opening music for Microsoft when your

439
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:25,460
 computer would turn on that music that it would make like that one?

440
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:26,460
 It was exactly that.

441
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,460
 Yeah.

442
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,460
 Do you know who wrote that?

443
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:29,460
 Is it Brian Eno?

444
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,460
 Yeah.

445
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,460
 No, there wasn't that one actually.

446
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,460
 Oh right.

447
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,460
 I couldn't tell which one that one was that James was doing.

448
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:42,060
 He wrote Brian Eno wrote the one that went, sounds like him.

449
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:48,380
 He got given a list of about 100 words, descriptive words saying it needs to be sexy, informative,

450
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:57,740
 exciting, ambitious, all these words and it needs to be in 0.75 seconds or 3.4 seconds.

451
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:00,740
 And so the great secret of it was that he wrote it on a Mac.

452
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:01,740
 Oh really?

453
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:02,740
 Yeah.

454
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:03,740
 Really?

455
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:07,140
 The first laptop was sold in 1982.

456
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:09,140
 They were selling them door to door.

457
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:13,540
 They were priced around $20,000 in today's money so pretty expensive things.

458
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:16,140
 They were pretty big, about 11 pounds.

459
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:19,660
 But the main problem, the reason people don't want to buy them is because they had a keyboard

460
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:25,740
 on them and like big executives who worked in offices thought that typing stuff was something

461
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:28,260
 that would be done by secretaries not by themselves.

462
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,260
 Wow.

463
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:31,780
 And so they really resisted having anything that had a keyboard on it.

464
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,460
 That's really a status indicator.

465
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,460
 Yeah.

466
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,460
 That's incredible.

467
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,460
 Computers have changed quite a lot.

468
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:38,460
 I was reading in the news just this week.

469
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:45,660
 They have a supercomputer that read 100,000 scientific papers in two hours and cross-referenced

470
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:49,620
 all of them against each other and found completely new types of biology.

471
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:50,620
 What?

472
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:51,620
 I know.

473
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,620
 Really?

474
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:56,740
 It's quite complicated to explain what it was but it was something like they were looking

475
00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:01,660
 for a specific compound and they looked for mentions of it in all these 100,000 papers

476
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:06,660
 and cross-referenced them against each other and they found new types of these compounds

477
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:09,940
 that they didn't know existed before or something like that anyway.

478
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:10,940
 That's absolutely unbelievable.

479
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:11,940
 I know.

480
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:12,940
 I can't really work out what it means.

481
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:13,940
 I haven't seen it.

482
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:18,140
 I'll post it on my Twitter feed if people want to read that but it's absolutely amazing.

483
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:20,580
 So I was looking into code breaking during World War II.

484
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:24,580
 The guy who invented, who came up with the Nigma Arthur Sherbius didn't know where he'd

485
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:25,580
 come up with.

486
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:30,660
 He died in 1929 in a carriage accident, I think, before he knew that it was being put

487
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,220
 to that kind of use.

488
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,420
 But he also invented the electric pillow.

489
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:36,180
 Sorry, what's an electric pillow?

490
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:40,900
 I assume it's so he patented a way of transmitting heat through various objects and so I think

491
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:41,900
 it's like an electric blanket.

492
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:42,900
 Oh.

493
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:43,900
 Just to keep your head really hot.

494
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:44,900
 I don't know why you want that.

495
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,900
 Because that's one problem, isn't it?

496
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:47,900
 The pillows get too hot.

497
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:48,900
 Yeah.

498
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:57,620
 You turn the pillow over and the other side's even hotter.

499
00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:02,620
 Okay, time for our final fact of the show and that is Andy Murray.

500
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:03,620
 Hello.

501
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:10,860
 My fact is that a couple of botanists from Q Gardens recently checked a £1.29 bag of

502
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:15,940
 Porcini mushrooms from the supermarket and they found three species which were previously

503
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:17,460
 unknown to science.

504
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:18,460
 That's pretty cool.

505
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,460
 Yeah.

506
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:22,180
 They thought they'd run it through a DNA sequencer.

507
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:23,180
 As you do.

508
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:24,700
 Do they do that before they eat all of their meals?

509
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,700
 Try it.

510
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:28,340
 It's a bit like horse meat in Lasagna kind of thing, is it?

511
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:31,900
 Like they thought they were Porcini, but I don't know, it's like unicorn Lasagna.

512
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:32,900
 Yeah.

513
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:33,900
 Yeah.

514
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:34,900
 Give me a go.

515
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:38,100
 So does that mean we're just missing them all because they just happen to be botanists?

516
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:42,860
 We've all probably eaten mushrooms that are completely unknown to science.

517
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:44,260
 So they got to name them, which is cool.

518
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:46,020
 You don't often get to name three new species.

519
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,020
 What did they call them?

520
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:53,620
 They call them Latin names which translate as white beef liver, delicious cattle liver

521
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:56,420
 fungus and the third one just means edible.

522
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:59,420
 Ran out of ideas.

523
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:03,680
 One of the people who has a lot of animals named after them whose lives is an explorer

524
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:10,960
 in Venezuela called Charles Bruech Carayas and he has a lot of animals attributed to him

525
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:15,640
 partially because in Venezuela there's so many undiscovered species that any time he

526
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:22,440
 goes to a new one of the tabletop mountains, he just discovers tons of new species.

527
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,240
 It's so diverse up there as well.

528
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,760
 They say that if you're on the top of these tabletop mountains, if you have two bodies

529
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:32,520
 of water literally meters apart from each other, the fish inside this one will be a complete

530
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:35,320
 different species of the fish inside of the one sitting beside it.

531
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,840
 That's how varied and...

532
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,760
 So are you talking about the Andes, did you say?

533
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:43,840
 Because the orchids that are in the Andes, the Ecuadorian Andes, they have more orchids

534
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,600
 than anywhere else on the planet that are endemic, only found there.

535
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:52,200
 One botanist called Lou Jost found four new species of orchid in a single day all hidden

536
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,600
 in the same patch of moss.

537
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,600
 Wow.

538
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,600
 Isn't that amazing?

539
00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:00,080
 There was a new species of chameleon found in Tanzania and it was found after a snake

540
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:04,280
 spat out a still undigested specimen in the feet of a British scientist.

541
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,280
 Wow.

542
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,280
 Wow.

543
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,280
 There's a snake there.

544
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,280
 He's like, "Oh no, there's a snake!"

545
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:11,240
 And then it sort of vomits up a chameleon and goes, "Oh, that's a new one.

546
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,240
 I haven't seen that before."

547
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,240
 Incredible.

548
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:17,120
 That's like, that happens all the time, it seems, to these sort of zoologist and stuff.

549
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,280
 The guy who discovered a new species of monkey that fell into his notebook.

550
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:23,960
 I know it wasn't monkey, it was a new species of frog, a dark frog that fell into his

551
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:24,960
 notebook as he was catapult.

552
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,960
 Did he press it?

553
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:26,960
 Like a flower?

554
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:32,920
 I'm sure, leave it for three days, and then show it to my teacher.

555
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:39,040
 My favorite species discovery is a really exciting discovery in 2010 of a species called

556
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:44,280
 the Australopithecus sediba, which is a type of hominid, a new type of hominid they found.

557
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:50,200
 And basically this guy, Lee Burgers, a paleoanthropologist, and he was in South Africa on a paleoanarchological

558
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:53,280
 dick looking for fossils and new species.

559
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:58,640
 So while he was doing this, his nine-year-old son, nearby, Matthew, was playing with the dog

560
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:03,480
 and tripped over a clavicle and jawbone which turned out belong to a new species of hominid

561
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,480
 and brought it back to his dad.

562
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:08,320
 He was obviously like, "Shut up, son, I'm busy now.

563
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,720
 Go away, come back later."

564
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,640
 Turn out, he discovered a new human, basically.

565
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,640
 Wow.

566
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,640
 Incredible.

567
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,360
 Okay, so this is, I really like this.

568
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,640
 We don't know for sure how many species of gerbil there are.

569
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,120
 Oh, that's great.

570
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:25,840
 We know of 95, but I think no one's properly looked into it, like with so many species animals,

571
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,320
 we have no idea how many there are.

572
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:32,480
 Among the 95 known species of gerbil are Wagner's gerbil, as well as Cheezmans, the South African

573
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:39,640
 hairy footed, Swaldies, Pleasant, Burton's, Julian's, Vivaceus, and Rigenbach's.

574
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,960
 Swaldies, I like Pleasant gerbil.

575
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,960
 Pleasant gerbil.

576
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:43,960
 Yeah.

577
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:44,960
 I don't believe such thing exists.

578
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:45,960
 Gerbil.

579
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:46,960
 I think I feel about gerbil.

580
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:47,960
 It's like you feel about mushrooms.

581
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,960
 Oh, yeah.

582
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:49,960
 Yeah.

583
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,960
 Not too many of them know.

584
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,120
 They have an indefinable aura of death around them.

585
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,120
 Is that a fact?

586
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,120
 No.

587
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,120
 I mean, that's what Jane thinks about mushrooms.

588
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,120
 Oh, right.

589
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:01,080
 Okay, got it on the subject of gerbils, finding stuff in food.

590
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:04,840
 There was a guy in Killington, which is quite near where I'm from, in Oxfordshire recently,

591
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:09,600
 who bought online from Tesco's a pack of hovis sliced bread, and there's just the best

592
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,600
 picture of it.

593
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:15,640
 So he found a whole mouse inside the bread, and it was sort of, it looks like something

594
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:19,680
 fossilized, but it's this complete mouse, and it took about four slices of bread.

595
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,920
 But without a tail, and he'd already eaten some.

596
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:25,600
 So was the genuine I found half a maggot in my food.

597
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:31,120
 Premiere foods, who made the bread, admitted it had failed to ensure all stages of food production

598
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,360
 were protected against contamination.

599
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,360
 Wow.

600
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:39,200
 The food standards authority allows up to 20 maggots per 100 grams of mushrooms, before

601
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:45,560
 it's a problem, and 75 mites before 20 maggots per 100 grams of mushrooms.

602
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,560
 That's quite a lot.

603
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,560
 It is quite a lot, isn't it?

604
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,560
 100 grams, which is very much.

605
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:53,000
 I suppose mushrooms, dried mushrooms are very light, so 100 grams is quite a lot.

606
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,520
 It's not dried, it's drained.

607
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,520
 Oh, okay.

608
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,520
 So just normal mushrooms.

609
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:02,720
 There is a species of mushroom, named recently called Fallas Druziai, and that was named

610
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:08,280
 after a guy called Bob Druze, and obviously Fallas, because it's shaped like a penis.

611
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:11,000
 And so this, basically, is named Bob Druze's penis.

612
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 Oh, it's a name of...

613
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 Wow.

614
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 It's a name of the thing.

615
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 Wow.

616
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 And does someone really not like Bob Druze?

617
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,080
 No, it was in his honor, they were friends of his, and he said, in an interview with a newspaper,

618
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,840
 he said, "I am utterly delighted."

619
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,560
 The funny thing is that it is...

620
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,560
 I'm sorry.

621
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,560
 What?

622
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,560
 This is going to go wrong.

623
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,560
 No.

624
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,560
 He said...

625
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,560
 I am utterly delighted.

626
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:34,760
 The funny thing is that it is the second smile I stole from my shoe.

627
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,760
 I can't do this.

628
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:40,480
 Do you need someone else to read it out to you?

629
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,480
 I don't know.

630
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,480
 Sorry, I don't know.

631
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,480
 What else to read this, because I keep laughing.

632
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:46,720
 Bob Druze said, "I am utterly delighted.

633
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:53,200
 The funny thing is that it's the second smallest known mushroom in his genus, and it grows sideways

634
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,200
 almost live."

635
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,200
 Okay?

636
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,200
 There you go.

637
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,200
 That's amazing.

638
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:02,600
 Yeah, but he was delighted that it was named after him.

639
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:08,200
 It also emits a foul-older and attracts plagues.

640
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:12,080
 But I understand why he's so pleased.

641
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:16,080
 It's a mushroom on the other hand.

642
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:20,400
 It's going to be a rose named after June Whitfield.

643
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,400
 Oh, yeah.

644
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,400
 The catalogue description.

645
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,840
 It says it's good in the bed, but best up against the wall.

646
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:33,040
 Okay, that's it.

647
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,040
 That's all of our facts.

648
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,800
 Thanks so much, everyone, for listening.

 The tree.

660
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,400
 It's five E's at the end there.

661
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,400

 Yes.

664
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,240
 Okay.

665
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,240
 And so, yeah, that's it.

666
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,240
