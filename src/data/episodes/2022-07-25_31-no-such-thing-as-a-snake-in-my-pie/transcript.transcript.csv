00:00:00,00:00:02,We run it on QI a few years ago.
00:00:02,00:00:02,Yeah.
00:00:02,00:00:04,"Which was, there's no such thing as a fish."
00:00:04,00:00:05,"You did a nice, such thing as a fish."
00:00:05,00:00:09,"No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life."
00:00:09,00:00:12,"He says it, ride that first paragraph, no such thing as a fish."
00:00:12,00:00:23,"Hello, welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming"
00:00:23,00:00:26,to you from the QI offices in Covern Garden.
00:00:26,00:00:27,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:27,00:00:30,"I'm sitting here with Andy Murray, James Parkin, and Anna Chazinsky."
00:00:30,00:00:34,"And once again, we've gathered around the microphone with our four favorite facts on the"
00:00:34,00:00:35,last seven days.
00:00:35,00:00:38,"So here we go, in no particular order, let's do it."
00:00:38,00:00:42,"James, back number one."
00:00:42,00:00:48,"My fact this week is that in the 17th century, there was a prophet called Dorothy Harling,"
00:00:48,00:00:53,who would kill you of your sins by urinating on the afflicted part of your body.
00:00:53,00:00:54,Wow.
00:00:54,00:00:57,"When you've got a sin, what was the afflicted part of your body?"
00:00:57,00:00:59,"Well, if you'd been swearing, it could be your mouth."
00:00:59,00:01:00,Right.
00:01:00,00:01:01,Yeah.
00:01:01,00:01:03,"If you'd stolen something, it could be your hands, I guess."
00:01:03,00:01:04,Okay.
00:01:04,00:01:08,"If you'd thought a dirty thought, your brain would piss in your ear."
00:01:08,00:01:09,Into your ear.
00:01:09,00:01:10,She would whip people first.
00:01:10,00:01:14,She would whip you first to try and get rid of the sins and then she'd urinate on you.
00:01:14,00:01:17,And she was known as the permanent spring.
00:01:17,00:01:20,This sounds more like a chapter from 50 Shades of Grey.
00:01:20,00:01:21,Does it?
00:01:21,00:01:22,"Oh, yeah."
00:01:22,00:01:23,Whipping.
00:01:23,00:01:26,"I mean, that's all very bondage-based activity."
00:01:26,00:01:31,"It wasn't uncommon to use urine in a weird medical way though, was it, in around that time"
00:01:31,00:01:32,in the 17th century.
00:01:32,00:01:33,No.
00:01:33,00:01:38,"So they had people who would smell or look at the colour, or even sometimes the flavour of"
00:01:38,00:01:40,people's urine in order to diagnose disease.
00:01:40,00:01:43,"And they had, you know, those colour wheels you get."
00:01:43,00:01:45,They had a urine wheel like pantone.
00:01:45,00:01:46,Yeah.
00:01:46,00:01:47,Exactly.
00:01:47,00:01:50,And they had 20 different colours of urine around the edge of it.
00:01:50,00:01:51,20 Shades of Pea.
00:01:51,00:01:58,"And so the end it was all to do with the humourism, whether you're four humour's were in order."
00:01:58,00:01:59,But I think that would work.
00:01:59,00:02:02,"I think if your urine tasted sweet, then you might be diabetics."
00:02:02,00:02:03,"That's how they used to do that, right?"
00:02:03,00:02:04,Yeah.
00:02:04,00:02:05,Doctors used to diagnose you that way.
00:02:05,00:02:09,"It was called Thomas Willis, the man who discovered it, and in 1674, he said that diabetic"
00:02:09,00:02:13,people's urine was wonderfully sweet as if it were imbued with honey or sugar.
00:02:13,00:02:18,"And it was called Willis's disease for a long time, diabetes, because of him discovering"
00:02:18,00:02:19,it.
00:02:19,00:02:25,"Plylly said that you could use urine for a whole bunch of ailments, but stale urine mixed"
00:02:25,00:02:27,with ash could be rubbed on your baby for nappy rash.
00:02:27,00:02:31,Which sounds just like a really unpleasant way to be entering the world.
00:02:31,00:02:36,I think there's like Mayan tablet or something like that that says this is about the patient.
00:02:36,00:02:41,"If all else fails, have him remove one sandal, urinate in it, and drink the urine."
00:02:41,00:02:45,"And this was if everything else in that the doctor prescribed didn't work, then that was"
00:02:45,00:02:46,the last thing you should try.
00:02:46,00:02:49,"Oh, sandals are they full of holes?"
00:02:49,00:02:50,Good point.
00:02:50,00:02:53,I don't know how I would retain lipid in my sandals.
00:02:53,00:03:00,So actually drinking urine has been thought by quacks for centuries as being a way of solving
00:03:00,00:03:01,any problems that you have.
00:03:01,00:03:06,"I think we mentioned it on QI, that, and we have a website address that we bought called"
00:03:06,00:03:12,"drinkmyurin.co.uk, and if you go on to that, then it takes you to the QI website."
00:03:12,00:03:18,"And what that means is because we still own it, all of the QI.com URLs can also be written"
00:03:18,00:03:20,as drinkmyurin.co.uk.
00:03:20,00:03:26,"So if you go on to drinkmyurin.co.uk/podcast, you'll find our podcast page."
00:03:26,00:03:32,"Speaking of drinking urine, there's so many people of Scandinavia and Northern Scandinavia."
00:03:32,00:03:35,"People thought for ages that they would feed magic mushrooms to their reindeer, and then"
00:03:35,00:03:37,they would drink their reindeer here.
00:03:37,00:03:38,"Oh, I agree with that."
00:03:38,00:03:39,Yeah.
00:03:39,00:03:41,"So, and then they get high off magic mushrooms, but without getting the poisonous effect"
00:03:41,00:03:44,"and vomiting, which is what happens if you eat them directly, if you eat too much."
00:03:44,00:03:48,And then this anthropologist came along and debunked this whole thing and said the Sami
00:03:48,00:03:50,people did not drink reindeer urine.
00:03:50,00:03:54,"And then he went and interviewed a Sami person, so he wrote a whole book about how they don't,"
00:03:54,00:03:58,"and then he met some Sami people and they were like, ""Yeah, we do this all the time."""
00:03:58,00:03:59,"Oh, no."
00:03:59,00:04:01,"So we had to write another book saying, ""Actually."""
00:04:01,00:04:02,"Oh, no."
00:04:02,00:04:03,They do it.
00:04:03,00:04:05,I read a thing about the coriac people in Siberia.
00:04:05,00:04:12,"They would take us sort of hallucinogenic psychedelic mushroom, and the mushroom would send them insane"
00:04:12,00:04:13,into like a beautiful psychedelic thing.
00:04:13,00:04:18,"The problem was it's quite expensive, and so it has a thing in it where when you urinate"
00:04:18,00:04:23,"it doesn't dilute the hallucinogenic in it, and so basically it comes out just as strong,"
00:04:23,00:04:26,just slightly diluted from the initial thing that you're taking.
00:04:26,00:04:30,So the people who couldn't afford to take the mushroom would buy the urine off the people
00:04:30,00:04:33,who just had a trip so that they could then have that.
00:04:33,00:04:36,"So in Siberia, Russia, they used to, if you had chewing gum, you would chew it, and so you"
00:04:36,00:04:40,"didn't have the taste anymore, and then you'd pass that onto someone else to have the remnants"
00:04:40,00:04:41,of the taste?
00:04:41,00:04:42,Why?
00:04:42,00:04:43,Because it was so rare.
00:04:43,00:04:44,But if there was no taste left?
00:04:44,00:04:48,"Yeah, but I think I'm right in saying your mouth kind of gets used to the taste, so there's"
00:04:48,00:04:49,still some left.
00:04:49,00:04:51,"It does, and that's why there's always room for pudding."
00:04:51,00:04:56,"It's called sensory-specific satiety, SSS, and if you are really full of your main course,"
00:04:56,00:05:00,"you think, ""Oh, I can't eat any more of this,"" whatever it is, you're having risotto."
00:05:00,00:05:02,"And then someone says, ""Hey, how about a proffittoral?"""
00:05:02,00:05:07,"Your taste buds perk up, and you think, ""Oh, wait, maybe I can squeeze in a bit more food,"
00:05:07,00:05:08,"because it's a different flavor."""
00:05:08,00:05:09,"It's a different flavor, right?"
00:05:09,00:05:10,Okay.
00:05:10,00:05:11,I got a good urine fact.
00:05:11,00:05:16,"Well, it turns out that we urinate 50% more than we drink per day."
00:05:16,00:05:17,How could that be?
00:05:17,00:05:18,That's what I thought.
00:05:18,00:05:19,Because you're breathing in water vapor.
00:05:19,00:05:22,"No, it's because all the foods that get broken down, there's lots of water in foods."
00:05:22,00:05:23,"Oh, that's awesome."
00:05:23,00:05:24,Yeah.
00:05:24,00:05:25,That's amazing.
00:05:25,00:05:26,"Yeah, that is good."
00:05:26,00:05:27,Hold on.
00:05:27,00:05:28,Thanks.
00:05:28,00:05:35,"I thought it was going to be because we are half yetis, and yetis are the little dita."
00:05:35,00:05:42,"The first obscenity law in England was in 1663, when poet Sir Charles Sedley got too drunk,"
00:05:42,00:05:46,"shouted, ""Blasphemous things from a balcony in Covent Garden, and urinated on the crowd"
00:05:46,00:05:47,"below."""
00:05:47,00:05:48,Oh.
00:05:48,00:05:51,And that was also the last law written in Norman French in the UK.
00:05:51,00:05:52,Wow.
00:05:52,00:05:53,That's it.
00:05:53,00:05:54,Yeah.
00:05:54,00:05:55,That's a nice coincidence.
00:05:55,00:05:57,We should get a balcony.
00:05:57,00:06:02,And Sigmund Freud viewed urinating in public as a sign of strong subconscious ambition.
00:06:02,00:06:03,"Oh, did he?"
00:06:03,00:06:04,Yeah.
00:06:04,00:06:08,"And if that's true, Central London on a Friday night is one of the most ambitious places in"
00:06:08,00:06:09,the world.
00:06:09,00:06:10,I've got one more thing about you.
00:06:10,00:06:11,Yeah.
00:06:11,00:06:12,"So, oh, which do you want?"
00:06:12,00:06:14,Do you want the one about rabbits or the one about the future?
00:06:14,00:06:15,"Oh, the future."
00:06:15,00:06:16,The future.
00:06:16,00:06:21,"So, as well as these doctors who were genuinely trying to work out how you could use urine to"
00:06:21,00:06:26,"diagnose disease, there were people who practiced the art of Euromency, which is the art"
00:06:26,00:06:30,"of telling the future using urine, and they were also known as piss profits, a bit more"
00:06:30,00:06:31,vulgarly.
00:06:31,00:06:36,"But, they took omens from different signs in it, so some people took omens from the colour"
00:06:36,00:06:42,"of the client's urine or from its taste, or they read the bubbles immediately after it"
00:06:42,00:06:43,hit the bowl.
00:06:43,00:06:47,"So, you would have to weigh in in the divination bowl."
00:06:47,00:06:50,"And if there were large bubbles spread out, you were about to come into money."
00:06:50,00:06:52,There were small bubbles packed together.
00:06:52,00:06:56,"But it would be illness or someone who loved to die, and I know."
00:06:56,00:06:57,"Oh, no."
00:06:57,00:06:59,"So, it would die just because I'd peed bubbles."
00:06:59,00:07:00,"Small, packed together bubbles."
00:07:00,00:07:01,Yes.
00:07:01,00:07:02,Right.
00:07:02,00:07:03,"So, be careful."
00:07:03,00:07:04,Can you imagine?
00:07:04,00:07:05,Wow.
00:07:05,00:07:06,Yeah.
00:07:06,00:07:07,And it was very common in the 17th century.
00:07:07,00:07:12,"A lot of people slag them off, Ben Johnson, so that they were 30-facy, nasty-patey, lousy-farticle"
00:07:12,00:07:13,rogues.
00:07:13,00:07:15,"Famously mature, man."
00:07:15,00:07:22,"So, this young lady Dorothy Harling, she was thought to have been someone who was predicted"
00:07:22,00:07:26,"in the book of revelations, or a lot of these people called French prophets who came over."
00:07:26,00:07:27,"They were hoganos, and they were them."
00:07:27,00:07:32,"They claimed that they were, you know, prophets from the Bible."
00:07:32,00:07:33,But I just really like prophets.
00:07:33,00:07:37,"I like, you know, people who think that they're gods, or..."
00:07:37,00:07:38,Yeah.
00:07:38,00:07:39,But I love this guy.
00:07:39,00:07:40,There was a guy called Cooper.
00:07:40,00:07:43,"I remember his first name, and he was living in London."
00:07:43,00:07:44,He was unemployed.
00:07:44,00:07:48,"And some of his friends, some of his Indian friends told him that he looked and moved just"
00:07:48,00:07:51,like an ancient Indian goddess.
00:07:51,00:07:53,"And he thought, ""Oh, well, that sounds quite good."""
00:07:53,00:08:00,"Anyway, so he then went to Gujarat, and he claimed to be this ancient goddess in human form."
00:08:00,00:08:05,"And now he lives in a holy saffron robe, living among 80 eunuchs."
00:08:05,00:08:10,"Why didn't he say to his friends, ""Okay, great, whatever, let's have another drink."""
00:08:10,00:08:12,Who takes their friends' comments on how they look that seriously?
00:08:12,00:08:13,"Yeah, but..."
00:08:13,00:08:17,"Every time I saw my mum, I believe I was beautiful, if that was the way he used to be."
00:08:17,00:08:20,"Oh, you are beautiful, and I don't know."
00:08:20,00:08:22,"Well, thanks guys."
00:08:22,00:08:29,"Okay, time for fact number two, and that is Yulcha Zinski."
00:08:29,00:08:35,"So my fact is that, despite the fact that homosexuality is completely illegal in the south"
00:08:35,00:08:40,"to Dan, a woman can have a female husband and a child can have a female father."
00:08:40,00:08:42,"Oh, how does that work?"
00:08:42,00:08:47,"So it makes sense because it's true actually across parts of East Africa in various tribes,"
00:08:47,00:08:52,"one of the tribes is the new air tribe, and if a woman is infertile, it's a way of herbing"
00:08:52,00:08:54,able to continue her family line.
00:08:54,00:08:58,So this infertile woman has a father who wants to pass on property to a son or a grandson.
00:08:58,00:08:59,Right.
00:08:59,00:09:03,"So the infertile woman marries another woman, and then this other woman has a secret lover"
00:09:03,00:09:08,"whom she has some sex with, gets pregnant, and then she has a child by that man, but that"
00:09:08,00:09:13,child is officially the child of the infertile woman and the other woman.
00:09:13,00:09:18,"And then everything like legal, societal, cultural rights, everything like that, it's all the"
00:09:18,00:09:21,same as if they were a normal husband and wife marriage.
00:09:21,00:09:26,"It's openly accepted that that's what's done, and it's enshrined in law, and there's this"
00:09:26,00:09:30,"other weird thing as well, which is, I think this is another tribe in Kenya, it's the courier"
00:09:30,00:09:33,"tribe, which is called daughter-in-law marriage."
00:09:33,00:09:35,"Wait, the courier tribe?"
00:09:35,00:09:39,"The courier tribe, yeah, where they make the font, right?"
00:09:39,00:09:41,"Yes indeed, and they just carry stuff back and forth."
00:09:41,00:09:43,"That's what I thought, yeah, they were delivering stuff."
00:09:43,00:09:44,Yeah.
00:09:44,00:09:45,They deliver babies.
00:09:45,00:09:50,"Oh no, the courier, K-U-R-I-A tribe, and they have this thing called daughter-in-law marriage"
00:09:50,00:09:57,"where an infertile woman marries another woman, and then she gives as a wife the other woman"
00:09:57,00:09:59,to her fictitious son.
00:09:59,00:10:04,"So this woman doesn't have any sons, but she marries a woman and then donates that woman"
00:10:04,00:10:10,"to her made-up son, and so that woman now counts as her daughter-in-law, and then that woman"
00:10:10,00:10:13,"gets pregnant, and then that counts as her grandchild."
00:10:13,00:10:14,It's a very confusing system.
00:10:14,00:10:19,So it's like having your friend marry your imaginary friend?
00:10:19,00:10:25,"Yes, yes, exactly, because having a daughter-in-law is a sign of status in certain African tribes"
00:10:25,00:10:27,"and again, confers certain cultural systems."
00:10:27,00:10:28,It's pretty great.
00:10:28,00:10:29,"Oh my God, it's pretty great."
00:10:29,00:10:33,"There is problems if you can't have children yourself, but you want to keep their family"
00:10:33,00:10:34,line going.
00:10:34,00:10:35,Yeah.
00:10:35,00:10:36,It's ingenious.
00:10:36,00:10:40,"There are lots of women in Albania who live as men, aren't there?"
00:10:40,00:10:42,"Yeah, is it a canoeing law or something like that?"
00:10:42,00:10:43,"I think so, yeah."
00:10:43,00:10:44,"But actually, I say there are lots."
00:10:44,00:10:48,"There are very few now, because it's a very old custom, and most of the remaining ones"
00:10:48,00:10:50,"are in their 70s, 80s or even 90s, so."
00:10:50,00:10:54,"But they simply live as men, so they dress as men, they live as men."
00:10:54,00:10:55,And do they pretend that they are men?
00:10:55,00:10:57,"Or does everyone know that they're women, but they just say-"
00:10:57,00:10:59,"I don't know, but they're a woman, but they have the status of a man."
00:10:59,00:11:04,"Yeah, all you have to do is dress as the man, and then people accept that you are."
00:11:04,00:11:05,Yeah.
00:11:05,00:11:06,And that's just a way society works.
00:11:06,00:11:07,You don't marry.
00:11:07,00:11:10,"You're not allowed to marry, and you're known as a swan virgin, I think."
00:11:10,00:11:11,That's right.
00:11:11,00:11:12,"Yeah, yeah."
00:11:12,00:11:16,"But you are officially a man, even though you're a celibate man, and you won't marry a woman."
00:11:16,00:11:17,Okay.
00:11:17,00:11:18,But you're unannounced.
00:11:18,00:11:22,"There is a canoeing law in Albania, and he says it's a very old fashion one, but I think"
00:11:22,00:11:28,"there's one other thing, if I'm right, it's the same thing where, if your wife is having"
00:11:28,00:11:32,"sex with another guy, you're allowed to kill them, but you have to kill them both at the"
00:11:32,00:11:38,"same time with one bullet, and they have to be in the act at the time."
00:11:38,00:11:39,Wow.
00:11:39,00:11:40,Could you guys just line up there please?
00:11:40,00:11:41,Yeah.
00:11:41,00:11:42,It's still-
00:11:42,00:11:46,I think that's a needlessly complicated work around.
00:11:46,00:11:48,You could just say you're not allowed to murder anyone.
00:11:48,00:11:49,Yes.
00:11:49,00:11:50,"It's a loophole, isn't it?"
00:11:50,00:11:51,It is a loophole.
00:11:51,00:11:54,"It almost sounds as if it happened once, and they went, ""Oh no, no, it's legal."
00:11:54,00:11:57,"Do you not read those comments?"""
00:11:57,00:11:59,"In France, you can marry dead people."
00:11:59,00:12:00,Okay.
00:12:00,00:12:07,"It's called posthumous marriage, and the idea is that, say, I have a fiance, and she's"
00:12:07,00:12:12,"going to inherit half of what I own, but then I die, legally, she'd have no right to it,"
00:12:12,00:12:16,"so that, do the marriage after I've died, and then she legally is part of that family, and"
00:12:16,00:12:19,"owns half of the oroms, all of their stuff."
00:12:19,00:12:20,That makes sense.
00:12:20,00:12:25,"These are all ingenious solutions to the natural problems of life, and how it gets in the"
00:12:25,00:12:26,way of stability.
00:12:26,00:12:31,"The societal problems of life, mainly in the case of gender discrimination, and it's"
00:12:31,00:12:35,"quite funny, the idea is that they really miss the point that women go to the lawmakers"
00:12:35,00:12:39,"and say, ""Oh, the gay people in Africa,"" and say, ""We're really sick of this discrimination,"
00:12:39,00:12:43,"and the lawmakers go, ""Okay, we'll let you pretend to be a man."""
00:12:43,00:12:44,Does that solve the problem?
00:12:44,00:12:45,It's like...
00:12:45,00:12:46,"No, not really."
00:12:46,00:12:50,"If the suffragettes had gone down that road, then we'd be living in a hundred percent"
00:12:50,00:12:52,male Britain today.
00:12:52,00:12:54,All of you have the legal right to be men.
00:12:54,00:13:00,"We were talking about France, a French wedding custom in the Overn region in certain villages."
00:13:00,00:13:01,It's called La Routie.
00:13:01,00:13:04,"They have the wedding, and then the married couple then go after their bed chamber, and then"
00:13:04,00:13:07,it's traditional for the wedding guests to interrupt their bed chamber in the middle of
00:13:07,00:13:12,"the night, overturn their bed chamber, and then they fill up a chamber pot with all the"
00:13:12,00:13:16,"leftover wine, champagne, food, sometimes toilet paper, apparently tampon soaked in tomato"
00:13:16,00:13:22,"sauce, and they force the bride and groom to drink the contents of this chamber pot as"
00:13:22,00:13:23,a wedding ritual.
00:13:23,00:13:27,It's boost to signify their intimacy of their future life together or something.
00:13:27,00:13:28,"Oh, wow."
00:13:28,00:13:29,Yeah.
00:13:29,00:13:30,"Romantic, right?"
00:13:30,00:13:32,What a great way to ruin someone's wedding night.
00:13:32,00:13:35,I'm definitely going to start doing that to my friends.
00:13:35,00:13:39,"Or they also fill up with champagne and chocolate, sometimes, which symbolises urine and"
00:13:39,00:13:40,feces.
00:13:40,00:13:41,Yeah.
00:13:41,00:13:45,"I have a bit of a worry about champagne representing urine, because it has lots of bubbles"
00:13:45,00:13:49,"in it, and presumably everyone's just going to die in a small pack together bubbles as"
00:13:49,00:13:50,well.
00:13:50,00:13:51,Yeah.
00:13:51,00:13:55,"There's another wedding which I really want the verification of it, so if anyone belongs"
00:13:55,00:14:00,"to the Tidong tribe in Borneo who's listening to this podcast, or who knows of them, apparently,"
00:14:00,00:14:05,"if you get married in this tribe, you're not allowed to urinate or defecate or wash for"
00:14:05,00:14:07,three days after you get married.
00:14:07,00:14:11,"And it's just on this one person's blog who went and hung out with the Tidong tribe, but"
00:14:11,00:14:12,I couldn't find reference to it anywhere else.
00:14:12,00:14:14,So three days you have to hold it in.
00:14:14,00:14:15,That's amazing.
00:14:15,00:14:16,I admire that.
00:14:16,00:14:19,"There's been a problem with this, because if the Tidong tribe in Borneo, in the middle"
00:14:19,00:14:22,"of the jungle are listening, how are they going to tell you because you're not on Twitter?"
00:14:22,00:14:23,That's a good point.
00:14:23,00:14:26,I forgot that's the only way they communicate.
00:14:26,00:14:31,"Also, holding it in for three days just after a wedding is tough, because you drink a lot"
00:14:31,00:14:32,of the wedding.
00:14:32,00:14:33,That's so true.
00:14:33,00:14:36,And it's going to be the most unsavory after those three days.
00:14:36,00:14:41,"It's the least romantic way again to end them, as you both fighting your way to the toilet"
00:14:41,00:14:43,for an explosive session.
00:14:43,00:14:44,Anyway.
00:14:44,00:14:47,Have you heard of Bride Pie?
00:14:47,00:14:52,"This is an English wedding tradition, so you have wedding cake, everyone knows about that."
00:14:52,00:14:57,"But traditionally in the 17th, 18th centuries around that time, you would also have Bride"
00:14:57,00:14:58,Pie.
00:14:58,00:15:03,"And this is a savoury dish, and it had lots of little things in it, like cox combs, you"
00:15:03,00:15:07,"know those, from a cockerel, or lamb's testicles, or goose giblets."
00:15:07,00:15:10,This sounds like a very unsavory pie to me.
00:15:10,00:15:15,"There was one recipe for a Bride Pie in Robert Mays book, The Accomplished Cook, which"
00:15:15,00:15:22,"included Veal Sweepbreds, Ox Tung's, A Pine of Oysters, Bacon, Chasnuts, Lemon Juice, Pickle"
00:15:22,00:15:28,"Berry's Wine, A Life Snake for Entertainment purposes, More Oysters and an Onion."
00:15:28,00:15:34,"I always find my pies aren't entertaining, dear milk and mobré, I was most disappointed"
00:15:34,00:15:38,on getting to the end of my pie to find you had left out the Life Snake.
00:15:38,00:15:42,"Please, can you rectify this situation?"
00:15:42,00:15:46,"Marriages in Sudan, do you remember that famous guy who married a goat?"
00:15:46,00:15:47,"Oh, yeah."
00:15:47,00:15:48,"He had to, didn't he?"
00:15:48,00:15:50,He was helped by law.
00:15:50,00:15:56,"He was caught in the Clagrante Delector, and they said, ""Well, in order to preserve the"
00:15:56,00:16:01,"honour of the goat who was called Rose, he had to marry her."""
00:16:01,00:16:06,"And Rose, unfortunately, died about a year later after she swallowed a plastic bag."
00:16:06,00:16:09,How convenient for a man.
00:16:09,00:16:14,"In India, people sometimes marry trees, don't they?"
00:16:14,00:16:15,Why would you marry a tree?
00:16:15,00:16:19,"It's an astrological thing, so in certain parts of India, you are manglic, if you're born"
00:16:19,00:16:24,"on a certain day of the month, which means that astrologically you have bad luck and in"
00:16:24,00:16:27,"marriage, it means that you'll likely be married to a lot of different husbands, either"
00:16:27,00:16:31,"they'll die or you'll get divorced, and the way to counterbalance that is in a ceremony"
00:16:31,00:16:38,"which is called arc-viva or cum-viva, where you marry a tree or an urn, and that's your"
00:16:38,00:16:41,"first marriage, and so that means, and you do the full ceremony, and that means you've"
00:16:41,00:16:44,"done marriage number one, now you can do marriage number two."
00:16:44,00:16:51,"And I think the former Miss World of 1990 was a tree, 1996, and she did this in, I think,"
00:16:51,00:16:57,"2003 or 2004, because she was very superstitious, and she was born under this sign."
00:16:57,00:17:01,"And the idea is that after you get married, you then chop down the tree or smash the urn."
00:17:01,00:17:03,Not to be recommended with genuine husbands.
00:17:03,00:17:05,"It's not bad for the tree though, yeah."
00:17:05,00:17:09,"And the tree's delight, you're going to marry a beautiful woman."
00:17:09,00:17:14,"It's the wedding night, I'm so excited."
00:17:14,00:17:23,Excuse the guy with the eggs approach.
00:17:23,00:17:28,"Okay, time for fact number three, and that is my fact, my fact this week, it's a discovery"
00:17:28,00:17:33,"that Tommy Flowers, the man who was responsible for the first ever, I guess the first ever"
00:17:33,00:17:38,"computer you could call it, Colossus, which was designed during World War II, is that when"
00:17:38,00:17:41,"they were pushing forward the idea that the Colossus should be made, it kept blowing up,"
00:17:41,00:17:45,"because it was made of 100, 100, 500 different valves, kept blowing up every time they turned"
00:17:45,00:17:49,"it on, and they said this can't work, and he was convinced it could work."
00:17:49,00:17:52,"He worked out that by turning it on and off, that that's what was blowing it up."
00:17:52,00:17:56,"So the first ever bit of IT advice was to not turn it off, then turn it back on again."
00:17:56,00:17:57,That's brilliant.
00:17:57,00:17:58,That's really funny.
00:17:58,00:18:00,So this is Tommy Flowers.
00:18:00,00:18:03,"Tommy Flowers, yeah, Tommy Flowers used to work for the post office."
00:18:03,00:18:08,"So he designed this thing, he put it forward, they said no to it, after they said no to it,"
00:18:08,00:18:11,"he solved the problem, and then they said no to it again, because it just took up too much"
00:18:11,00:18:15,"space and it was going to take a year to make, so he just went ahead with it anyway, as a"
00:18:15,00:18:20,"kind of half-secret project, which is an amazing half-secret project to have, because it was"
00:18:20,00:18:24,the size of a room in Bletchley.
00:18:24,00:18:26,"I don't know how you hide that, I don't know."
00:18:26,00:18:30,"Yeah, in Bletchley among people whose job it is to find out any secrets you might have."
00:18:30,00:18:33,Literally the worst place in the world are trying to keep the secret.
00:18:33,00:18:34,That's such a good boy.
00:18:34,00:18:35,That's so funny.
00:18:35,00:18:38,"Well, we found that all this computer ever, well what's always cited as the oldest computer"
00:18:38,00:18:46,"ever, was only discovered in, I think it was 1902, I want to say, anyway, early 20th Century,"
00:18:46,00:18:51,"was that ancient Greek computer from the 2nd century BC, which is called the Antikythera."
00:18:51,00:18:52,"The Antikythera, yeah."
00:18:52,00:18:55,"Is that definitely a computer, do we think?"
00:18:55,00:18:58,"Everyone always refers to it as a computer, so it's an unbelievably complex system of"
00:18:58,00:19:03,"cogs, which if you spin a handle on it, which correctly show you the rotation of all the"
00:19:03,00:19:07,"planets that have been discovered at the time, which has five planets, I think, and could"
00:19:07,00:19:12,"predict a lunar eclipse and a solar eclipse, and they didn't make anything nearly as complicated"
00:19:12,00:19:14,"as that for another 1,500 years or so."
00:19:14,00:19:19,"If anyone listening to this is thinking, oh, look into that later, Google it right now"
00:19:19,00:19:20,while you remember.
00:19:20,00:19:21,Maybe after the show.
00:19:21,00:19:22,Or maybe after the show.
00:19:22,00:19:25,"Just press pause and check it out, because it's the most extraordinary looking item, and"
00:19:25,00:19:28,"it's so out of place and time, that's the thing."
00:19:28,00:19:32,"You look at it, and it's like all those books that used to come out back in the 70s by Eric"
00:19:32,00:19:35,"Von Daniken and stuff saying, oh, there were ancient batteries and stuff, and you look at"
00:19:35,00:19:38,"it and you go, no, of course not, this is completely falsified."
00:19:38,00:19:39,This is the real deal.
00:19:39,00:19:41,"This is a thing that just, it's so complicated."
00:19:41,00:19:42,It is.
00:19:42,00:19:43,It's insane.
00:19:43,00:19:44,"I'm calling it, I think that's a computer."
00:19:44,00:19:49,They were computers used to refer to someone who just worked out when Easter was.
00:19:49,00:19:50,Really?
00:19:50,00:19:54,They would have a monk whose job it was to work out all the dates and all their feasts
00:19:54,00:19:55,and stuff like that.
00:19:55,00:19:58,They used to be in the main one and they were called computers.
00:19:58,00:20:02,If you tried turning him off and then turning him back on again.
00:20:02,00:20:06,"I read that the Colossus was actually dismantled, a bunch of them were dismantled, I think eight"
00:20:06,00:20:14,"of the ten, and all of the parts that made it up went into the spares of post office systems"
00:20:14,00:20:15,again.
00:20:15,00:20:16,Really?
00:20:16,00:20:17,"So a large part, and apparently those are still being used today."
00:20:17,00:20:22,"So a large part of the postal service is still being used using parts from Colossus,"
00:20:22,00:20:23,the very first computer.
00:20:23,00:20:26,It explains a lot.
00:20:26,00:20:30,"A couple of years ago at AQI Recording, we had some charity guests and one of the people"
00:20:30,00:20:36,I met there was he ran the computers which control a lot of trains all over the UK and
00:20:36,00:20:39,he said they run on every system that you can imagine.
00:20:39,00:20:44,There are still trains that are running on MS DOS in Britain today and there are ones
00:20:44,00:20:48,"which run on apples and when they first built the computing systems, a lot of the levers"
00:20:48,00:20:52,"for the points changing and things like that, they used parts from old RAF planes and"
00:20:52,00:20:56,"levers and things like that, amazingly cool, hodgepodge way of doing it."
00:20:56,00:21:00,"The problem with that is of course that when you have things going wrong, you don't have"
00:21:00,00:21:04,the parts to replace them because there's such antiquated systems and also if you had someone
00:21:04,00:21:09,who had to fix a computer system and it's written in some old code that no one does any
00:21:09,00:21:11,more than your completely screwed.
00:21:11,00:21:13,"MS DOS is going to come back, James."
00:21:13,00:21:14,Is it?
00:21:14,00:21:15,"C, colon slash slash."
00:21:15,00:21:16,Yes.
00:21:16,00:21:21,"Do you know who wrote the, do you remember the opening music for Microsoft when your"
00:21:21,00:21:25,computer would turn on that music that it would make like that one?
00:21:25,00:21:26,It was exactly that.
00:21:26,00:21:27,Yeah.
00:21:27,00:21:28,Do you know who wrote that?
00:21:28,00:21:29,Is it Brian Eno?
00:21:29,00:21:30,Yeah.
00:21:30,00:21:31,"No, there wasn't that one actually."
00:21:31,00:21:32,Oh right.
00:21:32,00:21:34,I couldn't tell which one that one was that James was doing.
00:21:34,00:21:42,"He wrote Brian Eno wrote the one that went, sounds like him."
00:21:42,00:21:48,"He got given a list of about 100 words, descriptive words saying it needs to be sexy, informative,"
00:21:48,00:21:57,"exciting, ambitious, all these words and it needs to be in 0.75 seconds or 3.4 seconds."
00:21:57,00:22:00,And so the great secret of it was that he wrote it on a Mac.
00:22:00,00:22:01,Oh really?
00:22:01,00:22:02,Yeah.
00:22:02,00:22:03,Really?
00:22:03,00:22:07,The first laptop was sold in 1982.
00:22:07,00:22:09,They were selling them door to door.
00:22:09,00:22:13,"They were priced around $20,000 in today's money so pretty expensive things."
00:22:13,00:22:16,"They were pretty big, about 11 pounds."
00:22:16,00:22:19,"But the main problem, the reason people don't want to buy them is because they had a keyboard"
00:22:19,00:22:25,on them and like big executives who worked in offices thought that typing stuff was something
00:22:25,00:22:28,that would be done by secretaries not by themselves.
00:22:28,00:22:29,Wow.
00:22:29,00:22:31,And so they really resisted having anything that had a keyboard on it.
00:22:31,00:22:33,That's really a status indicator.
00:22:33,00:22:34,Yeah.
00:22:34,00:22:35,That's incredible.
00:22:35,00:22:36,Computers have changed quite a lot.
00:22:36,00:22:38,I was reading in the news just this week.
00:22:38,00:22:45,"They have a supercomputer that read 100,000 scientific papers in two hours and cross-referenced"
00:22:45,00:22:49,all of them against each other and found completely new types of biology.
00:22:49,00:22:50,What?
00:22:50,00:22:51,I know.
00:22:51,00:22:52,Really?
00:22:52,00:22:56,It's quite complicated to explain what it was but it was something like they were looking
00:22:56,00:23:01,"for a specific compound and they looked for mentions of it in all these 100,000 papers"
00:23:01,00:23:06,and cross-referenced them against each other and they found new types of these compounds
00:23:06,00:23:09,that they didn't know existed before or something like that anyway.
00:23:09,00:23:10,That's absolutely unbelievable.
00:23:10,00:23:11,I know.
00:23:11,00:23:12,I can't really work out what it means.
00:23:12,00:23:13,I haven't seen it.
00:23:13,00:23:18,I'll post it on my Twitter feed if people want to read that but it's absolutely amazing.
00:23:18,00:23:20,So I was looking into code breaking during World War II.
00:23:20,00:23:24,"The guy who invented, who came up with the Nigma Arthur Sherbius didn't know where he'd"
00:23:24,00:23:25,come up with.
00:23:25,00:23:30,"He died in 1929 in a carriage accident, I think, before he knew that it was being put"
00:23:30,00:23:32,to that kind of use.
00:23:32,00:23:34,But he also invented the electric pillow.
00:23:34,00:23:36,"Sorry, what's an electric pillow?"
00:23:36,00:23:40,I assume it's so he patented a way of transmitting heat through various objects and so I think
00:23:40,00:23:41,it's like an electric blanket.
00:23:41,00:23:42,Oh.
00:23:42,00:23:43,Just to keep your head really hot.
00:23:43,00:23:44,I don't know why you want that.
00:23:44,00:23:46,"Because that's one problem, isn't it?"
00:23:46,00:23:47,The pillows get too hot.
00:23:47,00:23:48,Yeah.
00:23:48,00:23:57,You turn the pillow over and the other side's even hotter.
00:23:57,00:24:02,"Okay, time for our final fact of the show and that is Andy Murray."
00:24:02,00:24:03,Hello.
00:24:03,00:24:10,My fact is that a couple of botanists from Q Gardens recently checked a £1.29 bag of
00:24:10,00:24:15,Porcini mushrooms from the supermarket and they found three species which were previously
00:24:15,00:24:17,unknown to science.
00:24:17,00:24:18,That's pretty cool.
00:24:18,00:24:19,Yeah.
00:24:19,00:24:22,They thought they'd run it through a DNA sequencer.
00:24:22,00:24:23,As you do.
00:24:23,00:24:24,Do they do that before they eat all of their meals?
00:24:24,00:24:25,Try it.
00:24:25,00:24:28,"It's a bit like horse meat in Lasagna kind of thing, is it?"
00:24:28,00:24:31,"Like they thought they were Porcini, but I don't know, it's like unicorn Lasagna."
00:24:31,00:24:32,Yeah.
00:24:32,00:24:33,Yeah.
00:24:33,00:24:34,Give me a go.
00:24:34,00:24:38,So does that mean we're just missing them all because they just happen to be botanists?
00:24:38,00:24:42,We've all probably eaten mushrooms that are completely unknown to science.
00:24:42,00:24:44,"So they got to name them, which is cool."
00:24:44,00:24:46,You don't often get to name three new species.
00:24:46,00:24:47,What did they call them?
00:24:47,00:24:53,"They call them Latin names which translate as white beef liver, delicious cattle liver"
00:24:53,00:24:56,fungus and the third one just means edible.
00:24:56,00:24:59,Ran out of ideas.
00:24:59,00:25:03,One of the people who has a lot of animals named after them whose lives is an explorer
00:25:03,00:25:10,in Venezuela called Charles Bruech Carayas and he has a lot of animals attributed to him
00:25:10,00:25:15,partially because in Venezuela there's so many undiscovered species that any time he
00:25:15,00:25:22,"goes to a new one of the tabletop mountains, he just discovers tons of new species."
00:25:22,00:25:24,It's so diverse up there as well.
00:25:24,00:25:27,"They say that if you're on the top of these tabletop mountains, if you have two bodies"
00:25:27,00:25:32,"of water literally meters apart from each other, the fish inside this one will be a complete"
00:25:32,00:25:35,different species of the fish inside of the one sitting beside it.
00:25:35,00:25:36,That's how varied and...
00:25:36,00:25:38,"So are you talking about the Andes, did you say?"
00:25:38,00:25:43,"Because the orchids that are in the Andes, the Ecuadorian Andes, they have more orchids"
00:25:43,00:25:47,"than anywhere else on the planet that are endemic, only found there."
00:25:47,00:25:52,One botanist called Lou Jost found four new species of orchid in a single day all hidden
00:25:52,00:25:53,in the same patch of moss.
00:25:53,00:25:54,Wow.
00:25:54,00:25:55,Isn't that amazing?
00:25:55,00:26:00,There was a new species of chameleon found in Tanzania and it was found after a snake
00:26:00,00:26:04,spat out a still undigested specimen in the feet of a British scientist.
00:26:04,00:26:05,Wow.
00:26:05,00:26:06,Wow.
00:26:06,00:26:07,There's a snake there.
00:26:07,00:26:08,"He's like, ""Oh no, there's a snake!"""
00:26:08,00:26:11,"And then it sort of vomits up a chameleon and goes, ""Oh, that's a new one."
00:26:11,00:26:12,"I haven't seen that before."""
00:26:12,00:26:13,Incredible.
00:26:13,00:26:17,"That's like, that happens all the time, it seems, to these sort of zoologist and stuff."
00:26:17,00:26:20,The guy who discovered a new species of monkey that fell into his notebook.
00:26:20,00:26:23,"I know it wasn't monkey, it was a new species of frog, a dark frog that fell into his"
00:26:23,00:26:24,notebook as he was catapult.
00:26:24,00:26:25,Did he press it?
00:26:25,00:26:26,Like a flower?
00:26:26,00:26:32,"I'm sure, leave it for three days, and then show it to my teacher."
00:26:32,00:26:39,My favorite species discovery is a really exciting discovery in 2010 of a species called
00:26:39,00:26:44,"the Australopithecus sediba, which is a type of hominid, a new type of hominid they found."
00:26:44,00:26:50,"And basically this guy, Lee Burgers, a paleoanthropologist, and he was in South Africa on a paleoanarchological"
00:26:50,00:26:53,dick looking for fossils and new species.
00:26:53,00:26:58,"So while he was doing this, his nine-year-old son, nearby, Matthew, was playing with the dog"
00:26:58,00:27:03,and tripped over a clavicle and jawbone which turned out belong to a new species of hominid
00:27:03,00:27:05,and brought it back to his dad.
00:27:05,00:27:08,"He was obviously like, ""Shut up, son, I'm busy now."
00:27:08,00:27:09,"Go away, come back later."""
00:27:09,00:27:11,"Turn out, he discovered a new human, basically."
00:27:11,00:27:12,Wow.
00:27:12,00:27:13,Incredible.
00:27:13,00:27:15,"Okay, so this is, I really like this."
00:27:15,00:27:18,We don't know for sure how many species of gerbil there are.
00:27:18,00:27:20,"Oh, that's great."
00:27:20,00:27:25,"We know of 95, but I think no one's properly looked into it, like with so many species animals,"
00:27:25,00:27:27,we have no idea how many there are.
00:27:27,00:27:32,"Among the 95 known species of gerbil are Wagner's gerbil, as well as Cheezmans, the South African"
00:27:32,00:27:39,"hairy footed, Swaldies, Pleasant, Burton's, Julian's, Vivaceus, and Rigenbach's."
00:27:39,00:27:41,"Swaldies, I like Pleasant gerbil."
00:27:41,00:27:42,Pleasant gerbil.
00:27:42,00:27:43,Yeah.
00:27:43,00:27:44,I don't believe such thing exists.
00:27:44,00:27:45,Gerbil.
00:27:45,00:27:46,I think I feel about gerbil.
00:27:46,00:27:47,It's like you feel about mushrooms.
00:27:47,00:27:48,"Oh, yeah."
00:27:48,00:27:49,Yeah.
00:27:49,00:27:51,Not too many of them know.
00:27:51,00:27:54,They have an indefinable aura of death around them.
00:27:54,00:27:55,Is that a fact?
00:27:55,00:27:56,No.
00:27:56,00:27:57,"I mean, that's what Jane thinks about mushrooms."
00:27:57,00:27:58,"Oh, right."
00:27:58,00:28:01,"Okay, got it on the subject of gerbils, finding stuff in food."
00:28:01,00:28:04,"There was a guy in Killington, which is quite near where I'm from, in Oxfordshire recently,"
00:28:04,00:28:09,"who bought online from Tesco's a pack of hovis sliced bread, and there's just the best"
00:28:09,00:28:10,picture of it.
00:28:10,00:28:15,"So he found a whole mouse inside the bread, and it was sort of, it looks like something"
00:28:15,00:28:19,"fossilized, but it's this complete mouse, and it took about four slices of bread."
00:28:19,00:28:21,"But without a tail, and he'd already eaten some."
00:28:21,00:28:25,So was the genuine I found half a maggot in my food.
00:28:25,00:28:31,"Premiere foods, who made the bread, admitted it had failed to ensure all stages of food production"
00:28:31,00:28:33,were protected against contamination.
00:28:33,00:28:34,Wow.
00:28:34,00:28:39,"The food standards authority allows up to 20 maggots per 100 grams of mushrooms, before"
00:28:39,00:28:45,"it's a problem, and 75 mites before 20 maggots per 100 grams of mushrooms."
00:28:45,00:28:46,That's quite a lot.
00:28:46,00:28:47,"It is quite a lot, isn't it?"
00:28:47,00:28:48,"100 grams, which is very much."
00:28:48,00:28:53,"I suppose mushrooms, dried mushrooms are very light, so 100 grams is quite a lot."
00:28:53,00:28:54,"It's not dried, it's drained."
00:28:54,00:28:55,"Oh, okay."
00:28:55,00:28:56,So just normal mushrooms.
00:28:56,00:29:02,"There is a species of mushroom, named recently called Fallas Druziai, and that was named"
00:29:02,00:29:08,"after a guy called Bob Druze, and obviously Fallas, because it's shaped like a penis."
00:29:08,00:29:11,"And so this, basically, is named Bob Druze's penis."
00:29:11,00:29:12,"Oh, it's a name of..."
00:29:12,00:29:13,Wow.
00:29:13,00:29:14,It's a name of the thing.
00:29:14,00:29:15,Wow.
00:29:15,00:29:16,And does someone really not like Bob Druze?
00:29:16,00:29:21,"No, it was in his honor, they were friends of his, and he said, in an interview with a newspaper,"
00:29:21,00:29:22,"he said, ""I am utterly delighted."""
00:29:22,00:29:24,The funny thing is that it is...
00:29:24,00:29:25,I'm sorry.
00:29:25,00:29:26,What?
00:29:26,00:29:27,This is going to go wrong.
00:29:27,00:29:28,No.
00:29:28,00:29:29,He said...
00:29:29,00:29:30,I am utterly delighted.
00:29:30,00:29:34,The funny thing is that it is the second smile I stole from my shoe.
00:29:34,00:29:36,I can't do this.
00:29:36,00:29:40,Do you need someone else to read it out to you?
00:29:40,00:29:41,I don't know.
00:29:41,00:29:42,"Sorry, I don't know."
00:29:42,00:29:43,"What else to read this, because I keep laughing."
00:29:43,00:29:46,"Bob Druze said, ""I am utterly delighted."
00:29:46,00:29:53,"The funny thing is that it's the second smallest known mushroom in his genus, and it grows sideways"
00:29:53,00:29:54,"almost live."""
00:29:54,00:29:55,Okay?
00:29:55,00:29:56,There you go.
00:29:56,00:29:57,That's amazing.
00:29:57,00:30:02,"Yeah, but he was delighted that it was named after him."
00:30:02,00:30:08,It also emits a foul-older and attracts plagues.
00:30:08,00:30:12,But I understand why he's so pleased.
00:30:12,00:30:16,It's a mushroom on the other hand.
00:30:16,00:30:20,It's going to be a rose named after June Whitfield.
00:30:20,00:30:21,"Oh, yeah."
00:30:21,00:30:22,The catalogue description.
00:30:22,00:30:25,"It says it's good in the bed, but best up against the wall."
00:30:25,00:30:33,"Okay, that's it."
00:30:33,00:30:34,That's all of our facts.
00:30:34,00:30:35,"Thanks so much, everyone, for listening."
