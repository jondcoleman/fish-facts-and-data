00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,200
 Hello and welcome to another episode of Drop Us Align. This is the bit where we

3
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,280
 talk about the facts and the uh corrections and the extra bits of

4
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,400
 information that you have sent in to us on Fish.

5
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,000
 So let's start right away. Oh okay okay we've got some

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,040
 corrections or some bonus information. That's the first choice.

7
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,000
 Let's get the corrections out of the way for a change. Oh it's going to take a

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,160
 while. Okay uh Patrick Tampkins writes to say Napoleon

9
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,640
 didn't wear a tricorn hat which I think we mentioned.

10
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,080
 I think we said at one point he said Nelson and Napoleon both wore bicorns.

11
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,760
 He says they were sometimes worn fore and aft

12
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,600
 but mostly are thwart ships. What is he talking about?

13
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,360
 I believe that I said in an offhand comment

14
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,040
 Napoleon's tricorn and then you guys immediately corrected it to bicorn and

15
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,280
 that was the end of it. I think Andy did for certain we said

16
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,160
 one of them wore a bicorn and one of them wore a tricon because it would have

17
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:09,280
 been awkward for them to wear. Yeah we did say that.

18
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,680
 To kiss.

19
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,680
 Well Patrick has just but he's also got to use. He was making up words though wasn't he?

20
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,720
 No he's these are phrases apparently fore and aft is you know where you wear

21
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,920
 the bicorn hat you know with the two ends front to back and then a

22
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,600
 thwart ships is where you wear it sideways on. Oh nice.

23
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,480
 And he throws in a bonus fact as well actually he says here's another great

24
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,440
 fact on the bicentenary of the battle of Trafalgar

25
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:35,040
 descendants of Napoleon and Nelson met at the

26
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,320
 hat shop James Locke and Co with the hats that their ancestors had. Friends of the

27
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,600
 podcast Locke and Co. They invented the bowl hat allegedly.

28
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,760
 Yeah that's right and it's only yeah it's like a 10 minute walk up the road.

29
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,080
 We should also say we've had a lot of correspondence about the company

30
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,760
 Crabtree and Evelyn which. Never heard of them.

31
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:59,760
 Do you mean Holland and Barrett? Well so you okay so you made the mistake of

32
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,560
 saying on the show that just near where we are

33
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,040
 there's a Crabtree and Evelyn. No I think first of all I said

34
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,240
 hey it's like the kind of thing you'd get from Crabtree and Evelyn

35
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:14,080
 and then. We said what's Crabtree and Evelyn. Exactly. And then you said

36
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,280
 oh it's like that place near here which is actually Holland and Barrett. Yes.

37
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,560
 Right but the point is that Crabtree and Evelyn is a shop

38
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,000
 we've ascertained in our research since that show went out it's now gone online

39
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,120
 only. James found that out so there are no bricks and water ones. Well I must say

40
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,360
 I did notice it before the show went out. I didn't know that it existed

41
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,240
 but I thought it was funny and that's why I put it out.

42
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:39,440
 Well that's not the benchmark for our listeners and it's we fell short by

43
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,880
 putting it in. No Harry wrote to say I am sure Anna

44
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,600
 you've been inundated with these emails today but Crabtree and Evelyn make

45
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,280
 expensive soaps, lotions and perfumes. I very much hope Anna hasn't been drinking

46
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,600
 them as vitamin supplements. And were we inundated?

47
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,200
 Yeah we were. Oh we were. Where are we? Yeah lots of emails. And I have been drinking

48
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,480
 vitamin supplements. And both counts he's right.

49
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,400
 Crabtree and Evelyn did used to exist in Oxford which is why you might have known

50
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,040
 them Anna but my friend Dominic wrote to me and he

51
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,800
 reckons that you might have known about them because they're mentioning friends.

52
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,280
 Apparently there's a famous time. So Phoebes what do you want for your

53
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,480
 birthday? Well what I really want is for my mom

54
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,560
 to be alive and enjoy it with me. Okay let me put it this way anything from

55
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,760
 Crabtree and Evelyn? I did of course of course I remember

56
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,040
 that that's so weird I thought it was such an English shop and yet.

57
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,800
 It's an American shop yeah. But yeah I only remember it from

58
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:37,520
 it's yeah it's why you asked your parents to buy stuff for your grandparents

59
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:43,360
 that you could say was from you. You'll buy some redox maybe.

60
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,080
 Yeah exactly. That's another fact we haven't mentioned

61
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,600
 that Anna knows friends phonetically pretty much.

62
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:55,360
 Yeah. Phonetically. I know how to pronounce almost all of the words in it.

63
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,560
 Yeah but you can pretty much quite line by line. I believe I could from start to

64
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,200
 finish yes. I could go now but we I think this is

65
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,960
 shorter than that allows for. So apologies for pretending for saying

66
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,960
 that we didn't know what Crabtree and Evelyn is.

67
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:13,520
 More apologies for keeping it in the show when after I'd already known that it

68
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,880
 was a thing. Knowing that it would upset so many people.

69
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,800
 I think you should just do extra recording James where as the show's going

70
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:25,600
 out just a little whisper of you comes over the top I actually know that this is.

71
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,440
 The comedy was so good and the flow of editing purposes it remains.

72
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,240
 It's not like David Attenborough.

73
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,840
 Hill you see the incorrect fact making a twist into the programme.

74
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:41,200
 Andy has spotted in the distance a joke.

75
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:46,640
 We don't want to disturb the joke. It's limping his way towards it.

76
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:51,360
 He's so nearly there. And it's fled. It's fled.

77
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,040
 He's found something to over explain and he's tearing into that with both

78
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:01,760
 sets of jaws. And he's killed it.

79
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:09,120
 Something I said wrong. Oh yeah. Rachel Smith got in touch. I heard from you

80
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,880
 that bread can only be baked in Tonga on Sunday in the event of a natural

81
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,720
 disaster. Oh yeah. Rachel has lived in Tonga and says I

82
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,160
 know this is not true. Shops are not allowed to open on Sundays.

83
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,920
 I got that much right except the bakery the one.

84
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:29,600
 Oh my god you've done an ick people. You've you've given them a reputation to our

85
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,360
 audience because it's not true. So funny because we were quite

86
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,160
 skeptical about that at the time weren't we? Yeah well you were right.

87
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,520
 You were absolutely right. The one thing you can get.

88
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,920
 Yeah. Yeah on a Sunday. And she says to this this is related to

89
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,880
 something that happened in the Spanish flu. She says to this very day queues of

90
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,320
 people wait outside the Cowleys Bakery in downtown

91
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,960
 Nuku Alofa which is the capital every Sunday morning.

92
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,720
 Also I used to visit the matriarch of the bakery family once or twice a week to

93
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,400
 teach the Pilates. Rachel doesn't know there's nothing

94
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,320
 Rachel doesn't know about baking in Tonga. Rachel are you sure the reason

95
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:08,480
 people don't queue around the block for the Sunday baking is that they can't

96
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,760
 bake on a Sunday in Tonga. Maybe there's just this one person who's allowed

97
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,320
 to bake. Oh wow like a loophole like an embassy

98
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:18,000
 kind of thing. Yeah and your average Joe or your average Jane not allowed to bake.

99
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,200
 What she says is that it's weird Anna that you say that because I don't think we

100
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,520
 should get into the business of correcting the corrections I think.

101
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:28,320
 But she says I just sort of paraphrase during the Spanish flu a lot of the

102
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,120
 population were dying because of the flu and the resultant famine

103
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,000
 and the Cowley family had very close links with the royal family and are

104
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,480
 granted royal dispensation to trade on Sundays.

105
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:41,040
 Ah so it could be generally speaking a lob apart from these people.

106
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:45,360
 It could be. Yeah it could be. That is not like that's not outside the Venn diagram

107
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,640
 of the possibilities. And you did say you can't bake on a Sunday so unless

108
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:54,640
 someone from this Cowley family is listening then I

109
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:58,960
 think you're absolutely correct. Rachel retract.

110
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,000
 Rachel I hope you enjoyed this bit where we

111
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,400
 really really tried to get off the hook. Did she have any info about whether

112
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,480
 Crabtree and Evelyn is open on Sundays? She doesn't. Is it popular in Tonga?

113
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,040
 Crabtree and Evelyn? They had special dispensation during the Spanish flu.

114
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:18,320
 People needed some lotions. There's a mistake we all made.

115
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,360
 Okay. Where we all experienced the Mandela effect.

116
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,800
 Okay so the Mandela effect is where a group of people usually often the whole

117
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,800
 world but they all remember something is happening which actually it turns out

118
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,720
 never happened. Yeah right. Yes. Yeah so what we said

119
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,320
 this is from Lee by the way. Thank you Lee. Lee B.

120
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,840
 That the the guy on the New Yorker doesn't have a monocle.

121
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,480
 Oh yeah. He does and we thought that we were confusing him with a monopoly man

122
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,680
 who in fact doesn't have a monocle.

123
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,880
 Wow. Does the peanut guy? I think I mentioned the peanut guy.

124
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:56,400
 Yes I can't remember but we've been double Mandela'd basically.

125
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,120
 Wait that's really funny. Okay I thought we said the New Yorker

126
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,880
 guy did have one but then did we backtrack because of the memory of the

127
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,040
 monopoly guy? Maybe. There certainly wasn't a claim that he

128
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:08,880
 definitely didn't on the podcast. I think it was oh are we confusing it

129
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:12,400
 with the monopoly guy? I think one about the M&M's

130
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,280
 do they have monocles? The sexy M&M's have monocles.

131
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,920
 Does the New Yorker guy? They will be sexy otherwise.

132
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:22,480
 And Kamabans as well. Yeah what I think the problem is is that we're

133
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,440
 recording this maybe a couple of weeks after what we've said and the person

134
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,000
 who's written is probably written immediately after hearing us

135
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,440
 screwing up. So what we need is real-time transcription

136
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,360
 services available to us. And actually can we ask a favor listeners

137
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,360
 please don't write in to correct us on what we've got wrong about what we've

138
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,680
 said because I think that will probably have them quite

139
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,920
 lot. What we've got wrong about what we've said.

140
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:48,320
 Yeah yeah so at this point we'll be saying well we actually said the monopoly man

141
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,400
 did X and then New Yorker. Because we don't remember that episode

142
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,920
 just three weeks ago now. Mr. Peanut Man does have it.

143
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,440
 I mean that's an extra bit of that's a bonus bit of information which is what

144
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,480
 this is all about. Well I thought I'd said it on the day so I figured.

145
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,920
 Who is Mr. Peanut Man sorry? I just got can see what he looks like from that but

146
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,960
 what does he do? I think he sells peanuts. I can't quite remember.

147
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,840
 It's amazing he's done very well out of it clearly. He can afford a cane and a

148
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:15,280
 top hat and a monocle. And a monocle yeah. But no clothes.

149
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:20,720
 So he can't buy everything. Strange priorities actually.

150
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,640
 And yet when I walk around Soho dressed like that.

151
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:29,840
 Oh come on they love it in Soho. We got sent a lot of fish puns from the time

152
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,240
 that you guys could think of a Shakespeare fish pun and I couldn't.

153
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,440
 Oh yeah. Oh come on. Yeah okay let's have a few of the highlights.

154
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,600
 These are all the Twitter ones we got loads more on email.

155
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,880
 Can you give us just the the Shakespeare play to give us one more go at it

156
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,280
 before you give us what they've said? That's a good idea.

157
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,160
 Do you want another cracker there? My kingdom for a seahorse would be a

158
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,720
 Richard III one. Yeah that's very good yeah.

159
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,400
 Yeah yeah give us the line and then before you give us the pun.

160
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,600
 You want the the name and then you're trying to guess and then you reveal

161
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:01,040
 okay uh Nicole Taylor. King Lear. Oh okay.

162
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:06,400
 Nicole Taylor is not the line. We'll edit out these long gaps.

163
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:12,400
 Is there a kingfisher? Is that or that bird? That's a bird.

164
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:21,520
 King Eel. Is it a pun on the title or is it a quote from

165
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:25,280
 I'm gonna whip us along I'm afraid. It's King Lear.

166
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:29,840
 King Lear. For fishing. Yeah that's good nice. Oh hang on so that's not a fish

167
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,880
 that's just a Lear. But it's related. No we don't have to be

168
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,280
 prescriptive. I didn't know we were going to that area I

169
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,080
 thought it was literally a fish okay. Danny you've got to open your mind.

170
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:43,120
 What that is open now for for round two. Oh god we're doing one round.

171
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,960
 It's best of ten. Okay okay okay uh Steve's Green

172
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:50,400
 sent in all's well that ends well. The version of that. It's just

173
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:54,480
 because well has water in it. Fish can live in that water.

174
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,160
 You need an oar, oars well uh to row your boat.

175
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,120
 It's all's well that ends well which is very good.

176
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:08,640
 Yeah um at Stewie Fuey sent in Perry Winkleys.

177
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,160
 Pericles and Winkles. That's the name of a Shakespeare play.

178
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,000
 Haven't seen that one. Uh Rob Leonard the Moree Wives of Windsor.

179
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,280
 Yeah good uh uh at Poison Paprika and Treveon Cleopatra.

180
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:25,920
 That's actually really good. I think that's the best. And several people

181
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,240
 sent in The Perch and a Venice which I think I said on the day but so

182
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,040
 such a long time afterwards that you had to edit it out.

183
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,920
 I think you said it at the end of the recording when we stopped recording.

184
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,800
 Yes I do remember. Yeah yeah yeah. I'm pretty sure I said it.

185
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,040
 I'm pretty sure you called us all up individually about one a year.

186
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,280
 You sent us a WhatsApp didn't you?

187
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,240
 James James it's too late to get with it.

188
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,240
 I'll do your voice though I found.

189
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,560
 Oh uh yeah um anyway those are all great thank you for those.

190
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,960
 And there's like there's one bit of bonus information that I think you guys

191
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:03,200
 will will like. This is from Peter Monroe and it's a brilliant start to any

192
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,480
 amount. Regarding cooking sausages in an exhaust pipe.

193
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,760
 Oh yeah so I actually was skeptical about whether they would cook, whether it

194
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,400
 would get hot enough to put a sausage in an exhaust pipe.

195
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,200
 Was I the one who raised the possibility? You thought that it was possible yeah.

196
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,560
 Well Peter Monroe is on one of our sides.

197
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,040
 And this is in a compilation episode as well isn't it?

198
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,480
 I don't recall yeah maybe. Is this a Jenga bonus double okay right this

199
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,720
 was really deep in that we've inception ourselves here.

200
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,320
 Okay Peter Monroe writes I'm a civil engineer and I have witnessed machine

201
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,360
 operators cooking their lunches in the exhaust pipes and radiators of their

202
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,240
 machines. Wow. They'll pop a tin of soup beans or

203
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,280
 sausages wrapped in tin foil in the exhaust pipe at the start of the day

204
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:44,720
 by lunchtime they're nicely cooked. However these are very large pieces of

205
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,320
 equipment Volvo a68 type size. Oh yeah.

206
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,680
 Yeah not your standard hatchback. No I get this.

207
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,120
 To get their lunch out of the exhaust pipe they rev the engine hard and it pops

208
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,520
 out.

209
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:03,120
 So they stand next to the exhaust with their mouth open.

210
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,320
 Wow. Is that incredible? It is not the best way to cook something. So it takes

211
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,280
 from when they arrive in the morning until lunchtime. Well you're doing your

212
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,920
 work. As in the engine's running anyway. But you

213
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,280
 can't have an early lunch otherwise you'll get botulism.

214
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:18,240
 Yeah that's true that's the rest. And it's quite a waste of petrol isn't it?

215
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,360
 I think the engine is running anyway I don't think.

216
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:29,120
 Right sorry. But I could I'm sure I've mentioned before I've cooked salmon in

217
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,360
 a dishwasher. So has many people. Yeah it's a common thing.

218
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,040
 Really common. Relatively common. It's a common thing you read about doing. I've

219
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,600
 actually don't think I've ever met anyone who's actually done it. I've just

220
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,400
 heard that people have done it. So that's actually exciting to meet you.

221
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:47,040
 What setting are you on? Not cottons. What are you on in the dishwasher?

222
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,920
 Washing machine is what I had in my head. I'm eating out your cotton balls.

223
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,920
 Sorry. So much nicer when it smells slightly of salmon. I think it would

224
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,760
 also work in your washing machine but possibly your

225
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,120
 salmon wouldn't be in one piece by the end of it. Absolutely minced.

226
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,160
 Because you wrap it in tinfoil for the dishwasher. Yeah and then you put a big

227
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,560
 steak in or whatever. Also slight lemony taste to it.

228
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,360
 Oh yeah lovely. There's dishwasher tablets for breeze

229
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:18,080
 or in the washroom. So anyway thank you Peter for telling us

230
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,600
 about the exhaust pipe. That's amazing. I'd love to see a video of that if

231
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,040
 we can see someone sausage popping out of an exhaust.

232
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:30,960
 Just google video sausage popping out and see what you get them with.

233
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:34,800
 Do you guys do you reckon Dan I'm going to ask you this to see others might know.

234
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,520
 Do you reckon it's better for the environment to use a dishwasher or to

235
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:42,880
 wash by hand? A dishwasher. You're right. I just assumed it was

236
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,640
 going to be the opposite. Is it really? I didn't know that.

237
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:52,240
 Uses less water less energy to heat the water just more efficient.

238
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:57,760
 Even if you put one plate in the dishwasher every time. No probably not.

239
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:02,720
 Then you put on a five hour cycle. Intensive.

240
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,360
 James said this was better for the environment so I'm just going to do it

241
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:10,400
 like this. I don't want to overfill. Here's one more thing which

242
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,520
 is I feel bad reading it out because it's something that

243
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:16,160
 supports something I said where you guys all made fun of me.

244
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,360
 But I feel like I'm reading it out now as a kind of grudge thing and I'm not.

245
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,880
 It's just that we got it got the correspondence and you know yeah.

246
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,760
 This is going to be a tense ending isn't it? And it's also about an episode we

247
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,200
 recorded in 2018 and so it does feel like a long time.

248
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,240
 You haven't been brooding on this since then have you? You've all been getting

249
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,840
 my whatsaps. I can imagine this email popped in

250
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:42,080
 and just your wife just heard you going "Findication!"

251
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:45,840
 I think I said I was I was alone when I got the email but I did say the word

252
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:49,280
 vindication to myself. I think you got it months ago

253
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:53,120
 and you said to your wife I'm gonna have to build a show so that I can bring this

254
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,200
 up. And she said but don't mention it in the first

255
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:59,280
 episode. Give it up for you. Give it up for you.

256
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:03,760
 Chris from Canberra writes. Chris yeah.

257
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,480
 Hope you're well. Sorry I can't remember the episode.

258
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,960
 Maybe NZEP but Andy from memory said that when sheep are in mating season

259
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:14,960
 that they, farmers, use crayon to mark the female after mounting.

260
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:18,960
 Oh yeah. Yeah and you guys all you took the piss

261
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:22,080
 a lot big time saying why would you use a crayon?

262
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:25,360
 Draw on a sheep with a crayon. We knew you were right. We just sort of

263
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,640
 be funny you know just to watch. Is this another one of these joke

264
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:31,360
 things where James has to whisper over the top of it?

265
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,720
 Yeah and you didn't know. You were very convinced I was wrong.

266
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,640
 No no. I had it in my notes. It was just it was funnier to make you feel like it

267
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:42,640
 was wrong on the day. You were absolutely right. I spent four years.

268
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:46,320
 I didn't realise that. I told my wife afterwards I was like Andy had a

269
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,520
 kill effect on the show. Yeah I told this guy Chris in

270
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,880
 camera and I said oh you honestly this is true

271
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,960
 mate. I actually thought that they used they

272
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,840
 used chalk rather than crayon. I think sometimes they will use chalk.

273
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,960
 Yeah yeah. What were we objecting to about the crayon claim that we said

274
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:06,560
 crayon was a silly substance to use or we said that they didn't even mark

275
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,600
 the mounted ones? No no no you were imagining them using a kind of

276
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:13,360
 like a fish of price kids crayon but I think you can get special

277
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:17,040
 sheep undercarriage crayons. Yeah yeah of course.

278
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:20,960
 You haven't looked it up in the four years since you've been bringing on this.

279
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:25,440
 We still don't believe it. Anyway Chris from Cranborough says three years ago

280
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:31,360
 an invention was made. But Mr A H M

281
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:35,680
 patented at ruinous expense.

282
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:40,080
 I wonder Chris say. He's just sent a link to a video where they

283
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,080
 they do say it's crayon. Oh video of sheep's having sex.

284
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:48,480
 No no it's of some farmers. Is it the farmers using the crayon

285
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,160
 or just talking about it? It's a farmer on instagram saying

286
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,920
 time to change the crayon on the tups from red to blue. And it's a picture of him.

287
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:59,360
 It's a video of him actually I'm going to show you like grabbing

288
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:04,160
 and and wrestling a sheep to the ground. And then

289
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,960
 yep yeah. I want to see the crayon. Yeah we're about to see the crayon.

290
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,920
 And there's the crayon. We're on the sheep's undercarriage. It's a huge crayon.

291
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,880
 He's grabbing a massive crayon. You'll never color within the lines with

292
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,960
 that size crayon. But basically they've sort of installed a crayon on the

293
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,680
 sheep's chest. I know that's what was weird. It was

294
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:25,440
 like a pencil case. That is incredible. And then and then so whenever that

295
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,160
 sheep that male that male sheep has sex with a female

296
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,200
 that it'll the back of the female will be marked. You see which ones have been

297
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,840
 mated with. Amazing. And you can see which ones have had

298
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,960
 red sex or blue sex based on the color of the crayon which I guess is a timing

299
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:41,520
 thing. Yeah most sex is blue sex isn't it?

300
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,640
 That's supposed to carry around their own crayons. That's extraordinary. Yeah that

301
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,200
 actually is a bit I didn't know. They've got their crayons installed. It's much

302
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,280
 better factually. Yep sorry. Sheep come with crayons installed.

303
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:56,240
 Wow. Bye.

304
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,840
 You never know when it's coming.

305
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,920
 Okay that is it for this drop of the line. Thank you so much for listening

 And if you would like to join in the fish cord

310
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,920

311
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:27,280
 then all you need to do is go to no such thing as a fish

312
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:32,800
 dot com forward slash fish cord

313
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:36,240
 and you'll find a load of other fish fans chatting about

314
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,960
 about the show and with their own facts and Dan pops up occasionally to say

315
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,600
 hi. Yeah. What's been going on on fish cord Dan?

316
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,200
 It genuinely is pretty amazing. Like I highly recommend going on it if you're

317
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,800
 part of this club fish membership because it's

318
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:52,080
 everyone's doing book recommendations, movie recommendations, they chat about

319
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,600
 their lives, they organize meetups you know it's a

320
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,560
 community like it's it's the community we always wanted that we

321
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:02,080
 never found a place for and this is it now. So yeah I highly recommend it.

322
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,080
 There we go no such thing as fish.com forward slash fish cord.

323
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:22,080
 Bye.
