00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.200
 Hello and welcome to another episode of Drop Us Align. This is the bit where we

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.280
 talk about the facts and the uh corrections and the extra bits of

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.400
 information that you have sent in to us on Fish.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.000
 So let's start right away. Oh okay okay we've got some

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.040
 corrections or some bonus information. That's the first choice.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.000
 Let's get the corrections out of the way for a change. Oh it's going to take a

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.160
 while. Okay uh Patrick Tampkins writes to say Napoleon

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.640
 didn't wear a tricorn hat which I think we mentioned.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.080
 I think we said at one point he said Nelson and Napoleon both wore bicorns.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.760
 He says they were sometimes worn fore and aft

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.600
 but mostly are thwart ships. What is he talking about?

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.360
 I believe that I said in an offhand comment

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.040
 Napoleon's tricorn and then you guys immediately corrected it to bicorn and

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.280
 that was the end of it. I think Andy did for certain we said

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.160
 one of them wore a bicorn and one of them wore a tricon because it would have

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.280
 been awkward for them to wear. Yeah we did say that.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.680
 To kiss.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.680
 Well Patrick has just but he's also got to use. He was making up words though wasn't he?

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.720
 No he's these are phrases apparently fore and aft is you know where you wear

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.920
 the bicorn hat you know with the two ends front to back and then a

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.600
 thwart ships is where you wear it sideways on. Oh nice.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.480
 And he throws in a bonus fact as well actually he says here's another great

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.440
 fact on the bicentenary of the battle of Trafalgar

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.040
 descendants of Napoleon and Nelson met at the

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.320
 hat shop James Locke and Co with the hats that their ancestors had. Friends of the

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.600
 podcast Locke and Co. They invented the bowl hat allegedly.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.760
 Yeah that's right and it's only yeah it's like a 10 minute walk up the road.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.080
 We should also say we've had a lot of correspondence about the company

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.760
 Crabtree and Evelyn which. Never heard of them.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.760
 Do you mean Holland and Barrett? Well so you okay so you made the mistake of

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.560
 saying on the show that just near where we are

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.040
 there's a Crabtree and Evelyn. No I think first of all I said

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.240
 hey it's like the kind of thing you'd get from Crabtree and Evelyn

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.080
 and then. We said what's Crabtree and Evelyn. Exactly. And then you said

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.280
 oh it's like that place near here which is actually Holland and Barrett. Yes.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.560
 Right but the point is that Crabtree and Evelyn is a shop

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.000
 we've ascertained in our research since that show went out it's now gone online

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.120
 only. James found that out so there are no bricks and water ones. Well I must say

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.360
 I did notice it before the show went out. I didn't know that it existed

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.240
 but I thought it was funny and that's why I put it out.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.440
 Well that's not the benchmark for our listeners and it's we fell short by

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.880
 putting it in. No Harry wrote to say I am sure Anna

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.600
 you've been inundated with these emails today but Crabtree and Evelyn make

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.280
 expensive soaps, lotions and perfumes. I very much hope Anna hasn't been drinking

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.600
 them as vitamin supplements. And were we inundated?

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.200
 Yeah we were. Oh we were. Where are we? Yeah lots of emails. And I have been drinking

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.480
 vitamin supplements. And both counts he's right.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.400
 Crabtree and Evelyn did used to exist in Oxford which is why you might have known

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.040
 them Anna but my friend Dominic wrote to me and he

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.800
 reckons that you might have known about them because they're mentioning friends.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.280
 Apparently there's a famous time. So Phoebes what do you want for your

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.480
 birthday? Well what I really want is for my mom

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.560
 to be alive and enjoy it with me. Okay let me put it this way anything from

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.760
 Crabtree and Evelyn? I did of course of course I remember

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.040
 that that's so weird I thought it was such an English shop and yet.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.800
 It's an American shop yeah. But yeah I only remember it from

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.520
 it's yeah it's why you asked your parents to buy stuff for your grandparents

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:43.360
 that you could say was from you. You'll buy some redox maybe.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.080
 Yeah exactly. That's another fact we haven't mentioned

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.600
 that Anna knows friends phonetically pretty much.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:55.360
 Yeah. Phonetically. I know how to pronounce almost all of the words in it.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.560
 Yeah but you can pretty much quite line by line. I believe I could from start to

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.200
 finish yes. I could go now but we I think this is

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.960
 shorter than that allows for. So apologies for pretending for saying

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.960
 that we didn't know what Crabtree and Evelyn is.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:13.520
 More apologies for keeping it in the show when after I'd already known that it

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.880
 was a thing. Knowing that it would upset so many people.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.800
 I think you should just do extra recording James where as the show's going

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:25.600
 out just a little whisper of you comes over the top I actually know that this is.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.440
 The comedy was so good and the flow of editing purposes it remains.

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.240
 It's not like David Attenborough.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.840
 Hill you see the incorrect fact making a twist into the programme.

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:41.200
 Andy has spotted in the distance a joke.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:46.640
 We don't want to disturb the joke. It's limping his way towards it.

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:51.360
 He's so nearly there. And it's fled. It's fled.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.040
 He's found something to over explain and he's tearing into that with both

00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:01.760
 sets of jaws. And he's killed it.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:09.120
 Something I said wrong. Oh yeah. Rachel Smith got in touch. I heard from you

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.880
 that bread can only be baked in Tonga on Sunday in the event of a natural

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.720
 disaster. Oh yeah. Rachel has lived in Tonga and says I

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.160
 know this is not true. Shops are not allowed to open on Sundays.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:25.920
 I got that much right except the bakery the one.

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.600
 Oh my god you've done an ick people. You've you've given them a reputation to our

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:33.360
 audience because it's not true. So funny because we were quite

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.160
 skeptical about that at the time weren't we? Yeah well you were right.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.520
 You were absolutely right. The one thing you can get.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.920
 Yeah. Yeah on a Sunday. And she says to this this is related to

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.880
 something that happened in the Spanish flu. She says to this very day queues of

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:50.320
 people wait outside the Cowleys Bakery in downtown

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.960
 Nuku Alofa which is the capital every Sunday morning.

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.720
 Also I used to visit the matriarch of the bakery family once or twice a week to

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.400
 teach the Pilates. Rachel doesn't know there's nothing

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:04.320
 Rachel doesn't know about baking in Tonga. Rachel are you sure the reason

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:08.480
 people don't queue around the block for the Sunday baking is that they can't

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:11.760
 bake on a Sunday in Tonga. Maybe there's just this one person who's allowed

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.320
 to bake. Oh wow like a loophole like an embassy

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:18.000
 kind of thing. Yeah and your average Joe or your average Jane not allowed to bake.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.200
 What she says is that it's weird Anna that you say that because I don't think we

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.520
 should get into the business of correcting the corrections I think.

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:28.320
 But she says I just sort of paraphrase during the Spanish flu a lot of the

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:31.120
 population were dying because of the flu and the resultant famine

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:34.000
 and the Cowley family had very close links with the royal family and are

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.480
 granted royal dispensation to trade on Sundays.

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:41.040
 Ah so it could be generally speaking a lob apart from these people.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:45.360
 It could be. Yeah it could be. That is not like that's not outside the Venn diagram

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:50.640
 of the possibilities. And you did say you can't bake on a Sunday so unless

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:54.640
 someone from this Cowley family is listening then I

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:58.960
 think you're absolutely correct. Rachel retract.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:02.000
 Rachel I hope you enjoyed this bit where we

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.400
 really really tried to get off the hook. Did she have any info about whether

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:10.480
 Crabtree and Evelyn is open on Sundays? She doesn't. Is it popular in Tonga?

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:13.040
 Crabtree and Evelyn? They had special dispensation during the Spanish flu.

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:18.320
 People needed some lotions. There's a mistake we all made.

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:21.360
 Okay. Where we all experienced the Mandela effect.

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:26.800
 Okay so the Mandela effect is where a group of people usually often the whole

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:30.800
 world but they all remember something is happening which actually it turns out

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:34.720
 never happened. Yeah right. Yes. Yeah so what we said

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:38.320
 this is from Lee by the way. Thank you Lee. Lee B.

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:41.840
 That the the guy on the New Yorker doesn't have a monocle.

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:46.480
 Oh yeah. He does and we thought that we were confusing him with a monopoly man

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:49.680
 who in fact doesn't have a monocle.

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:52.880
 Wow. Does the peanut guy? I think I mentioned the peanut guy.

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:56.400
 Yes I can't remember but we've been double Mandela'd basically.

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:59.120
 Wait that's really funny. Okay I thought we said the New Yorker

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:02.880
 guy did have one but then did we backtrack because of the memory of the

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:05.040
 monopoly guy? Maybe. There certainly wasn't a claim that he

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:08.880
 definitely didn't on the podcast. I think it was oh are we confusing it

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:12.400
 with the monopoly guy? I think one about the M&M's

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:15.280
 do they have monocles? The sexy M&M's have monocles.

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.920
 Does the New Yorker guy? They will be sexy otherwise.

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:22.480
 And Kamabans as well. Yeah what I think the problem is is that we're

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:25.440
 recording this maybe a couple of weeks after what we've said and the person

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:28.000
 who's written is probably written immediately after hearing us

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.440
 screwing up. So what we need is real-time transcription

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:35.360
 services available to us. And actually can we ask a favor listeners

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:39.360
 please don't write in to correct us on what we've got wrong about what we've

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:41.680
 said because I think that will probably have them quite

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:43.920
 lot. What we've got wrong about what we've said.

00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:48.320
 Yeah yeah so at this point we'll be saying well we actually said the monopoly man

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:52.400
 did X and then New Yorker. Because we don't remember that episode

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:55.920
 just three weeks ago now. Mr. Peanut Man does have it.

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:59.440
 I mean that's an extra bit of that's a bonus bit of information which is what

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:02.480
 this is all about. Well I thought I'd said it on the day so I figured.

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:05.920
 Who is Mr. Peanut Man sorry? I just got can see what he looks like from that but

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:08.960
 what does he do? I think he sells peanuts. I can't quite remember.

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:11.840
 It's amazing he's done very well out of it clearly. He can afford a cane and a

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:15.280
 top hat and a monocle. And a monocle yeah. But no clothes.

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:20.720
 So he can't buy everything. Strange priorities actually.

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:24.640
 And yet when I walk around Soho dressed like that.

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:29.840
 Oh come on they love it in Soho. We got sent a lot of fish puns from the time

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:32.240
 that you guys could think of a Shakespeare fish pun and I couldn't.

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:35.440
 Oh yeah. Oh come on. Yeah okay let's have a few of the highlights.

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:37.600
 These are all the Twitter ones we got loads more on email.

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:40.880
 Can you give us just the the Shakespeare play to give us one more go at it

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.280
 before you give us what they've said? That's a good idea.

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:46.160
 Do you want another cracker there? My kingdom for a seahorse would be a

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.720
 Richard III one. Yeah that's very good yeah.

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:52.400
 Yeah yeah give us the line and then before you give us the pun.

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:55.600
 You want the the name and then you're trying to guess and then you reveal

00:09:55.600 --> 00:10:01.040
 okay uh Nicole Taylor. King Lear. Oh okay.

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:06.400
 Nicole Taylor is not the line. We'll edit out these long gaps.

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:12.400
 Is there a kingfisher? Is that or that bird? That's a bird.

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:21.520
 King Eel. Is it a pun on the title or is it a quote from

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:25.280
 I'm gonna whip us along I'm afraid. It's King Lear.

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:29.840
 King Lear. For fishing. Yeah that's good nice. Oh hang on so that's not a fish

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:32.880
 that's just a Lear. But it's related. No we don't have to be

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:35.280
 prescriptive. I didn't know we were going to that area I

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:38.080
 thought it was literally a fish okay. Danny you've got to open your mind.

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:43.120
 What that is open now for for round two. Oh god we're doing one round.

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:46.960
 It's best of ten. Okay okay okay uh Steve's Green

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:50.400
 sent in all's well that ends well. The version of that. It's just

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:54.480
 because well has water in it. Fish can live in that water.

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:58.160
 You need an oar, oars well uh to row your boat.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:01.120
 It's all's well that ends well which is very good.

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:08.640
 Yeah um at Stewie Fuey sent in Perry Winkleys.

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:12.160
 Pericles and Winkles. That's the name of a Shakespeare play.

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:16.000
 Haven't seen that one. Uh Rob Leonard the Moree Wives of Windsor.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.280
 Yeah good uh uh at Poison Paprika and Treveon Cleopatra.

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:25.920
 That's actually really good. I think that's the best. And several people

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:30.240
 sent in The Perch and a Venice which I think I said on the day but so

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:33.040
 such a long time afterwards that you had to edit it out.

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:35.920
 I think you said it at the end of the recording when we stopped recording.

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:38.800
 Yes I do remember. Yeah yeah yeah. I'm pretty sure I said it.

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:41.040
 I'm pretty sure you called us all up individually about one a year.

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:45.280
 You sent us a WhatsApp didn't you?

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:48.240
 James James it's too late to get with it.

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:52.240
 I'll do your voice though I found.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:56.560
 Oh uh yeah um anyway those are all great thank you for those.

00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:58.960
 And there's like there's one bit of bonus information that I think you guys

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:03.200
 will will like. This is from Peter Monroe and it's a brilliant start to any

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:06.480
 amount. Regarding cooking sausages in an exhaust pipe.

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:11.760
 Oh yeah so I actually was skeptical about whether they would cook, whether it

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:14.400
 would get hot enough to put a sausage in an exhaust pipe.

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:17.200
 Was I the one who raised the possibility? You thought that it was possible yeah.

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:20.560
 Well Peter Monroe is on one of our sides.

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:23.040
 And this is in a compilation episode as well isn't it?

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:26.480
 I don't recall yeah maybe. Is this a Jenga bonus double okay right this

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:28.720
 was really deep in that we've inception ourselves here.

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:32.320
 Okay Peter Monroe writes I'm a civil engineer and I have witnessed machine

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:35.360
 operators cooking their lunches in the exhaust pipes and radiators of their

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:38.240
 machines. Wow. They'll pop a tin of soup beans or

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:41.280
 sausages wrapped in tin foil in the exhaust pipe at the start of the day

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:44.720
 by lunchtime they're nicely cooked. However these are very large pieces of

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:48.320
 equipment Volvo a68 type size. Oh yeah.

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:51.680
 Yeah not your standard hatchback. No I get this.

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:55.120
 To get their lunch out of the exhaust pipe they rev the engine hard and it pops

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:57.520
 out.

00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:03.120
 So they stand next to the exhaust with their mouth open.

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:06.320
 Wow. Is that incredible? It is not the best way to cook something. So it takes

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:09.280
 from when they arrive in the morning until lunchtime. Well you're doing your

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:11.920
 work. As in the engine's running anyway. But you

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:15.280
 can't have an early lunch otherwise you'll get botulism.

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:18.240
 Yeah that's true that's the rest. And it's quite a waste of petrol isn't it?

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:21.360
 I think the engine is running anyway I don't think.

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:29.120
 Right sorry. But I could I'm sure I've mentioned before I've cooked salmon in

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:33.360
 a dishwasher. So has many people. Yeah it's a common thing.

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:37.040
 Really common. Relatively common. It's a common thing you read about doing. I've

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:39.600
 actually don't think I've ever met anyone who's actually done it. I've just

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:42.400
 heard that people have done it. So that's actually exciting to meet you.

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:47.040
 What setting are you on? Not cottons. What are you on in the dishwasher?

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:51.920
 Washing machine is what I had in my head. I'm eating out your cotton balls.

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:55.920
 Sorry. So much nicer when it smells slightly of salmon. I think it would

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:59.760
 also work in your washing machine but possibly your

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:03.120
 salmon wouldn't be in one piece by the end of it. Absolutely minced.

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:06.160
 Because you wrap it in tinfoil for the dishwasher. Yeah and then you put a big

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:10.560
 steak in or whatever. Also slight lemony taste to it.

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:13.360
 Oh yeah lovely. There's dishwasher tablets for breeze

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:18.080
 or in the washroom. So anyway thank you Peter for telling us

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:21.600
 about the exhaust pipe. That's amazing. I'd love to see a video of that if

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:25.040
 we can see someone sausage popping out of an exhaust.

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:30.960
 Just google video sausage popping out and see what you get them with.

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:34.800
 Do you guys do you reckon Dan I'm going to ask you this to see others might know.

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:37.520
 Do you reckon it's better for the environment to use a dishwasher or to

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:42.880
 wash by hand? A dishwasher. You're right. I just assumed it was

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:46.640
 going to be the opposite. Is it really? I didn't know that.

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:52.240
 Uses less water less energy to heat the water just more efficient.

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:57.760
 Even if you put one plate in the dishwasher every time. No probably not.

00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:02.720
 Then you put on a five hour cycle. Intensive.

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:05.360
 James said this was better for the environment so I'm just going to do it

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:10.400
 like this. I don't want to overfill. Here's one more thing which

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:13.520
 is I feel bad reading it out because it's something that

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:16.160
 supports something I said where you guys all made fun of me.

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:19.360
 But I feel like I'm reading it out now as a kind of grudge thing and I'm not.

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:22.880
 It's just that we got it got the correspondence and you know yeah.

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:25.760
 This is going to be a tense ending isn't it? And it's also about an episode we

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:29.200
 recorded in 2018 and so it does feel like a long time.

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:32.240
 You haven't been brooding on this since then have you? You've all been getting

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:35.840
 my whatsaps. I can imagine this email popped in

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:42.080
 and just your wife just heard you going "Findication!"

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:45.840
 I think I said I was I was alone when I got the email but I did say the word

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:49.280
 vindication to myself. I think you got it months ago

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:53.120
 and you said to your wife I'm gonna have to build a show so that I can bring this

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:55.200
 up. And she said but don't mention it in the first

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:59.280
 episode. Give it up for you. Give it up for you.

00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:03.760
 Chris from Canberra writes. Chris yeah.

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:06.480
 Hope you're well. Sorry I can't remember the episode.

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:10.960
 Maybe NZEP but Andy from memory said that when sheep are in mating season

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:14.960
 that they, farmers, use crayon to mark the female after mounting.

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:18.960
 Oh yeah. Yeah and you guys all you took the piss

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:22.080
 a lot big time saying why would you use a crayon?

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:25.360
 Draw on a sheep with a crayon. We knew you were right. We just sort of

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:28.640
 be funny you know just to watch. Is this another one of these joke

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:31.360
 things where James has to whisper over the top of it?

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:34.720
 Yeah and you didn't know. You were very convinced I was wrong.

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:38.640
 No no. I had it in my notes. It was just it was funnier to make you feel like it

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:42.640
 was wrong on the day. You were absolutely right. I spent four years.

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:46.320
 I didn't realise that. I told my wife afterwards I was like Andy had a

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:49.520
 kill effect on the show. Yeah I told this guy Chris in

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:52.880
 camera and I said oh you honestly this is true

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:56.960
 mate. I actually thought that they used they

00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:59.840
 used chalk rather than crayon. I think sometimes they will use chalk.

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:02.960
 Yeah yeah. What were we objecting to about the crayon claim that we said

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:06.560
 crayon was a silly substance to use or we said that they didn't even mark

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:09.600
 the mounted ones? No no no you were imagining them using a kind of

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:13.360
 like a fish of price kids crayon but I think you can get special

00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:17.040
 sheep undercarriage crayons. Yeah yeah of course.

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:20.960
 You haven't looked it up in the four years since you've been bringing on this.

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:25.440
 We still don't believe it. Anyway Chris from Cranborough says three years ago

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:31.360
 an invention was made. But Mr A H M

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:35.680
 patented at ruinous expense.

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:40.080
 I wonder Chris say. He's just sent a link to a video where they

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:44.080
 they do say it's crayon. Oh video of sheep's having sex.

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:48.480
 No no it's of some farmers. Is it the farmers using the crayon

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:52.160
 or just talking about it? It's a farmer on instagram saying

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:55.920
 time to change the crayon on the tups from red to blue. And it's a picture of him.

00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:59.360
 It's a video of him actually I'm going to show you like grabbing

00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:04.160
 and and wrestling a sheep to the ground. And then

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:08.960
 yep yeah. I want to see the crayon. Yeah we're about to see the crayon.

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:11.920
 And there's the crayon. We're on the sheep's undercarriage. It's a huge crayon.

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:14.880
 He's grabbing a massive crayon. You'll never color within the lines with

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:18.960
 that size crayon. But basically they've sort of installed a crayon on the

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:21.680
 sheep's chest. I know that's what was weird. It was

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:25.440
 like a pencil case. That is incredible. And then and then so whenever that

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:28.160
 sheep that male that male sheep has sex with a female

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:31.200
 that it'll the back of the female will be marked. You see which ones have been

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:33.840
 mated with. Amazing. And you can see which ones have had

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:36.960
 red sex or blue sex based on the color of the crayon which I guess is a timing

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:41.520
 thing. Yeah most sex is blue sex isn't it?

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:44.640
 That's supposed to carry around their own crayons. That's extraordinary. Yeah that

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:47.200
 actually is a bit I didn't know. They've got their crayons installed. It's much

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:51.280
 better factually. Yep sorry. Sheep come with crayons installed.

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:56.240
 Wow. Bye.

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:59.840
 You never know when it's coming.

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:03.920
 Okay that is it for this drop of the line. Thank you so much for listening

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:07.520

 And if you would like to join in the fish cord

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:23.920
 which is on discord but it's it's got that clever name

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:27.280
 then all you need to do is go to no such thing as a fish

00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:32.800
 dot com forward slash fish cord

00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:36.240
 and you'll find a load of other fish fans chatting about

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:38.960
 about the show and with their own facts and Dan pops up occasionally to say

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:41.600
 hi. Yeah. What's been going on on fish cord Dan?

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:45.200
 It genuinely is pretty amazing. Like I highly recommend going on it if you're

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:48.800
 part of this club fish membership because it's

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:52.080
 everyone's doing book recommendations, movie recommendations, they chat about

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:55.600
 their lives, they organize meetups you know it's a

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:58.560
 community like it's it's the community we always wanted that we

00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:02.080
 never found a place for and this is it now. So yeah I highly recommend it.

00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:06.080
 There we go no such thing as fish.com forward slash fish cord.

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:22.080
 Bye.
