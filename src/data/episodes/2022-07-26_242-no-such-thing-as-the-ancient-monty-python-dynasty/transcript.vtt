00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600
 Hi guys, just before we start this show, we wanted to apologise because last week we released the podcast a day early.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.560
 No, we didn't.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.960
 You're right, we didn't, did we?

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.240
 We didn't do anything wrong.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.800
 No, who did something wrong?

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.040
 I did.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.440
 Yes, you did, didn't you, Alex?

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.400
 Do you know what this excuse was? Initially, daylight savings messed 'em up.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.040
 Oh, yeah, that one hour set you an entire day back.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.720
 It is, yeah, I just was really confused, I just went the whole week thinking it was a day before,

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.080
 and I had Friday off as well, so it was my Friday, it was Friday for me.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.440
 Right, sorry, it wasn't Friday for everyone else.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:36.800
 And I think, are you spent that Friday off reading a new book that you've been particularly enjoying, didn't you?

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.440
 Yes, I did, it was a reading book, it's the book of the year 2018.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.440
 Oh my gosh!

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:50.640
 Yeah, I've been told, I mean, I'm saying of my own volition, that it's a fantastic book, I think it's better than Harry Potter.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.520
 Wow!

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.120
 That's, I didn't even, well, no, I did tell him to say that, but he delivered it very well, I thought.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:01.600
 Yeah, it has a gun to my head. It's not a addict, come on, I'm just pleased to see you.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.560
 It's more of a...

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:12.000
 That said, it's just never delivered, whatever is in the trousers, poking the sight of your temple off of a tent.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.400
 Listen, Alex, have you got any favourite bits from the book?

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:23.640
 I do, actually, I have this fact that I just found, which is that Stan Rwinker was knocked out of the Australian open by Tennis Sandgren.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.160
 That's a man called Tennis, who plays Tennis, and comes from Tennis-y.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.400
 No way!

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.640
 That's amazing, and that would have been even more amazing if it was delivered with any kind of...

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.040
 Sorry, sorry, sorry.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.080
 Read the one above it, come on, the Tennis Sandgren.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.400
 A woman called Crystal Methvin was arrested for possessing Crystal meth.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.160
 Better.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.440
 What?

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.320
 Much better.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.000
 Wow, where do you get this book?

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.600
 You can get it in all good bookshops or online, and please buy lots of copies, because there isn't a massive uptake in sales, I think I'm going to be fired.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.080
 Yeah, that's true.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.640
 There will be firing, literally.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.560
 Wow.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.960
 Ooh, I'm just pleased to see you.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.640
 OK, guys, thanks so much for doing that, Alex, of your own volition, and on with the show.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.280
 On with the show.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.200
 On with the show.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.720
 No, you do not get to see that.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:33.680
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast, this week coming to you from our Book of the Year 2018 tour in York!

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:50.160
 My name is Dan Schreiber, and I am sitting here with Anna Chazinsky, Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:58.640
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favourite facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.080
 Starting with you, James Harkin.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:11.120
 My fact this week is that three times memory champion, Ben Pridmore, is up to his fourth lucky hat, as he forgot where he left the other way.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.000
 Wow.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.200
 So these memory tests are easier than we think.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:35.200
 Yeah, so this is from a press release for the 2014 World Memory Championships, and they're referring to memory champions, and they say reassuringly, they also lose their car keys, and come back from the shop without the one item they went for, or in case of three times World Memory Champion, Ben Pridmore from Darbyshire, his lucky hat.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.240
 He knows where he left one of them, it was on a train, but he forgot to pick it up off the train.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:53.160
 And the current World Memory Champion, actually, who's called Alex Mullin, who can memorize the order of the deck of cards in 17 seconds, says he always loses his car keys, so apparently it's just slight, it's just a different thing.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:04:00.360
 These people don't really have amazing memories, they just have kind of worked on their techniques for having amazing memories, if that makes sense.

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:28.360
 Yeah, I read about a thing which is called Highly Superior Autobiographical Memory, or HSAM, and HSAM basically are people who have such detailed memory about their own life that they can tell you the exact day that something happened on at the exact hour, and not many people have this, in fact they announced it when it was done as a sort of press release saying we're studying this new phenomena, and they've still found less than 100 people off the back of the publicity that they've got for it, so you're about to say they're more now.

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:38.360
 I thought there were only four, actually. Oh, I think the number, yeah, so it's under 100, but stories check out.

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:48.360
 These guys, the people who have that are not these memory champions, so the memory champions, they teach themselves how to count cards and how to do things like that, whereas these guys have got an actual innate talent.

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:57.360
 Yes, but what's amazing is they might forget basic things like phone numbers and faces, so they have a personal biography timeline, they can tell you what day things happened on.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:10.360
 Some of them do remember incredible things though, so there's a guy called Bob Betralla, and he can remember up to half the days of his entire life in detail, as in what he did at every stage of the day, and he remembers most conversations he said in the last 53 years.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:20.360
 We know which half he can remember, is it like, I don't know if it's the order or the even, but in 2006 he lost his phone, and he didn't worry, because he just had all the numbers in his head.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:29.360
 That's amazing. That's actually quite a good way to remember numbers is to lose your phone all the time, which I do, and I know basically everybody's phone numbers off by heart, so it's a chicken or egg thing.

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:37.360
 The one problem with this disease is that you also retain the exact feeling and emotion that you had about something in really high detail.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:44.360
 So if you were dumped like 20 years ago, you would still be like, "Oh, god damn it, it just wouldn't die as a feeling, yeah."

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.360
 Do you know that you can erase that though? Can you?

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:52.360
 Yeah, so they should all get this done. So basically there are two different parts of your brain that deal with memory.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:06:01.360
 There's the bit that remembers the actual facts of what happened, so that's the hippocampus, does that the cognitive part, and then the amygdala records the emotions that went with it.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:07.360
 And if something bad happens to you, you get dumped, you lose a sock.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.360
 Are you always getting dumped, or do you never lose a sock?

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:17.360
 Or does it always happen at the same time you're dumped? I don't date people with one sock.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:28.360
 I go out with very pedantic people. But if you take drugs like propanolol, then it limits the amygdala's ability to build up the proteins that are needed to connect you to that emotion.

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:37.360
 So next time you remember about the lost sock or the tragedy of the dumping, you just won't feel anything. You'll be like, "Oh, that happened. That was bad, wasn't it? Never mind."

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:43.360
 But like you say, James, it's, that's extremely rare. There are either four or a hundred people who have that.

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.360
 Whereas...

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.360
 Or somewhere in between.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:52.360
 Whereas being able to win these memory tests is actually quite easy. Anyone can do it.

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:59.360
 This is the amazing thing that people have sort of realized in the last few decades is that training your memory is very easy.

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:06.360
 And you basically do this thing called building a, building a memory palace where there's a specific way you can train yourself by

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:14.360
 picturing somewhere you know like you picture your own house. And then if you've got to remember, let's say, a hundred objects, you just place them in weird places in your house.

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:22.360
 So if you have to remember pineapple and Claudia Schiffer, if you picture her doing a headstand on a pineapple, I don't know why people are after that, because they...

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:24.360
 I don't know where your mind went.

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.360
 I think they were laughing away your mind when...

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:30.360
 That's basically the most up-to-date person you could think of.

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:36.360
 If you're told to remember a series of words, you can picture the objects in your mind.

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:40.360
 So your mind conference is a pineapple near your front door and then Claudia Schiffer in the front room.

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:47.360
 And as you walk through the house, you can see it. And it's called "Lokai", which is the plural of "Lokus", meaning "location in Latin".

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:55.360
 And it was apparently first used by Simonides of Kios, who was a soul survivor of a roof collapse during a meal.

00:07:55.360 --> 00:08:01.360
 And he could remember everyone who was in the room and people who had died, unfortunately, by remembering where they were sat.

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:03.360
 And that's according to legend.

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:10.360
 And apparently, this technique of remembering was thought so dangerous by the church that it was banned in 11th century Europe.

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:11.360
 Wow!

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:18.360
 It was in fear of it promoting unholy images, like Claudia Schiffer with a pineapple instance.

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:25.360
 That must mean so annoying. I read about Simonides and so this awful thing happened. The roof collapsed on whatever 100 guests.

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:30.360
 And then he just wanders back in and shows off how well you remember where they were all sat, didn't he?

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:36.360
 Yeah, I can't look at if he was asked to do it or if he had been doing the technique and then it was lucky that the roof collapsed.

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:38.360
 I don't think it was lucky, remember?

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:43.360
 Was it lucky that the roof collapsed and he survived because he'd already been memorising everyone?

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:47.360
 Was he one of these four people who just remember where everyone was sitting?

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:52.360
 It was not lucky and it also wasn't that he had an amazing memory. It was that the roof collapsed.

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:57.360
 And then he realised that he remembered them because he realised he had this spatial memory.

00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:00.360
 Was he doing the place settings for this dinner?

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:04.360
 Because I've been to dinner with five people where I don't remember where we were all setting.

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:09.360
 Maybe he was extremely bored. He had no one to talk. You know when you're a dinner and the person on your left is talking to the other person.

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:13.360
 And the person you're right is talking to the other person. So he was just sat there memorising where everyone was.

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:18.360
 I get to a lot of dinners like that, weirdly. I can imagine.

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:20.360
 So done.

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:29.360
 Just to go back to the memory champions briefly, this guy, Pridmore, I just looked at the things he can do.

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:33.360
 So he can memorise a pack of cards in 24 seconds, which is not quite the record.

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:37.360
 But he's remembered a binary number. I think this might have been record breaking.

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:45.360
 So binary number, just ones and zeroes, he remembered every single digit from a 930 digit long sequence in five minutes.

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:47.360
 He memorised it and then he got it complete.

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:52.360
 You're only zeroes and ones, though. So you know, it's a 50/50 guess each time.

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:55.360
 You could get unbelievably lucky.

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:57.360
 That's true.

00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:01.360
 Is it zero or zero?

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:08.360
 Actually, I was Googling this guy. I think he was on Britain's Got Talent this year or last year.

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.360
 Oh, yeah, he was. Yeah, he was. Yeah, okay.

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:13.360
 Doing that, repeating ones and zeroes.

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:18.360
 We met a guy, James and I, years ago, met this guy, an incredible guy called Daniel Tammett, who is a...

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:23.360
 He has autism, he has a spursus, and he has an incredible ability.

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:29.360
 He says it's kind of like his state is almost like what Rain Man, the movie, was except.

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:34.360
 He has this incredible ability to actually communicate and tell scientists what's going on on the inside.

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:37.360
 So he did a few record-breaking number memory things and...

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:40.360
 He was the guy who learned how to speak Icelandic in a week or so.

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:44.360
 Yes, exactly, yeah. And he has synesthesia as well.

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:50.360
 So he memorized pie to something like, you know, 300 decimal places or something like that.

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:53.360
 Yeah, but each number, it's only 10 options.

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:56.360
 You could get unbelievably lucky too.

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:59.360
 But he did it by using synesthesia.

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:03.360
 So every number has a color associated with it and he memorized the color.

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:08.360
 So when he had to read, when he had to tell it for the record, he just pictured walking

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:11.360
 and passing all the colors on the ground of each number.

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:13.360
 So he just saw a red and went six and a green and...

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:15.360
 That's how this memory training works. It's the same thing.

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:17.360
 It's turning into a visual thing, isn't it?

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:21.360
 Imagine you're about to break the record and suddenly, instead of a nine, there's Claudia Schiffer.

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:23.360
 And you're like, oh, God, what number was that meant to be?

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:26.360
 It was only a nine.

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:35.360
 But I think people's memories used to be better, right?

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:40.360
 So in ancient Greece and ancient Rome, like the way the Iliad and the Odyssey were passed down

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:44.360
 was we assume, or just already, over hundreds of years.

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:49.360
 And, you know, this is stuff that would take about 20 hours to read down, I think, the Iliad or the Odyssey.

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:52.360
 And yet people were able to memorize it and there's some repetition.

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:54.360
 And generally, people were really good at that.

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:58.360
 And the idea is that when you're remembering one of these stories, you're basically doing that walk through, aren't you?

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:01.360
 You're walking through the story and you're going to all these different places.

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:04.360
 And that's how they remember it by using the same technique.

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:08.360
 And the person who found out, actually, there's this really cool guy called Millman Perry,

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:13.360
 who was a Homeric scholar, and he was the person who founded the whole idea of oral tradition.

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:17.360
 So if you ever hear someone talk about the oral tradition of passing stuff down, he invented that.

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:20.360
 It was in the 1930s he was working.

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:27.360
 And he went to Russia and he found some Slavic people who were still passing down stuff through oral traditions.

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:31.360
 And they had poems that they would recite that were tens of thousands of lines long

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:34.360
 about, for instance, Franz Ferdinand's assassination or something.

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:39.360
 And so he developed this whole theory, but he never got to complete it because he accidentally killed himself

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:44.360
 when he was unloading a suitcase at his mother-in-law's house and a loaded gun in there fired into him.

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:46.360
 Oh, what?

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:50.360
 That story took a dark turn.

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:52.360
 And a loaded gun in a suitcase.

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:56.360
 I know, don't do it. I don't know how I got through the QOC.

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:57.360
 Wow, wow.

00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:01.360
 And you know who this guy, Pridmore, is worse than in memory terms?

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:03.360
 No, a chimpanzee.

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:04.360
 Oh, come on.

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:06.360
 Okay, so this is about ten years ago.

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:10.360
 He went up against Ayumu, who was a chimpanzee at Kyoto University,

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:14.360
 and it was a specific memory task where you had to recall a random series of nine numbers.

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:18.360
 They would flash up and then they would disappear very quickly, and you had to tap them in the right order.

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:21.360
 Chimpanzees have photographic memories in that regard only,

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:23.360
 so they can remember patterns and sequences really well.

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:25.360
 They're good at writing 90% of the time.

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:27.360
 You got to write 33% of the time.

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:28.360
 Wow.

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:29.360
 Wow.

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:33.360
 But if this chimpanzee is clever enough to get into Kyoto University, you must be...

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:41.360
 Do you know someone, another animal that has a really good memory, is the hummingbird?

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:45.360
 So the hummingbirds have one of the biggest brains proportional to body size in nature.

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:50.360
 And they remember the location of all the flowers that are in their general area,

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:55.360
 so many hundreds and thousands of flowers, and you know how much nectar they had in them.

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:58.360
 And they also remember when they last took nectar out of each one,

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:03.360
 so they remember when they're likely to refill, so they know exactly how full with nectar.

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:05.360
 All the flowers are going to be smart.

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:06.360
 That's awesome.

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:08.360
 We need to move on to our next fact, very shortly.

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:12.360
 Okay, so you know your first memory.

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:14.360
 What was your first memory then?

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:17.360
 Did it pass, no?

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:19.360
 No, I can't actually.

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:24.360
 Well, they did a study where they asked 6,641 people what their first memory was,

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:28.360
 and they said, "If it's something that someone might have told you, then don't do that.

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:30.360
 If it's something where you might have seen a picture, don't do that.

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:32.360
 It has to be something you actually remember."

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:37.360
 And they turned out that 38.6% of them remember things from before the age of two,

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:41.360
 and almost 1,000 people claim to have remembered things from before they were one.

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:43.360
 And people reckon that that's completely impossible.

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:49.360
 And actually, you don't really start forming memories that you can remember in adulthood until you're three.

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:53.360
 And so it means that about 40% of people have a fake first memory.

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:54.360
 Wow, that's amazing.

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:58.360
 Also, can we just pause for a moment on the fact that Dan can't remember his first memory?

00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:01.360
 Do you remember your second memory?

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:05.360
 Yeah, we were on a boat in Hong Kong.

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:09.360
 Yeah. I love the idea of when you go older,

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:14.360
 a memory sort of plays with you a bit, but also there's a lot of people in the entertainment industry

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:18.360
 who's obviously done a lot of drugs in the 70s and 80s, and they've fried their brains.

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:20.360
 So memory is sometimes questionable.

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:22.360
 And I was reading a story about Erros Smith.

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:29.360
 Stephen Tyler did a lot of drugs in the 70s, and he was sitting in a cafe with Perry, who was in his band,

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:34.360
 and they were listening to a song on the radio called "You See Me Crying Us" from that album.

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:38.360
 And Stephen Tyler was like, "The song is amazing. We need to cover this."

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:41.360
 And Perry went, "It's us, fuckhead."

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:43.360
 No.

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:44.360
 Wow.

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:46.360
 Should we move on to our next fact?

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:50.360
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Andy.

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:56.360
 My fact is that before he was executed, Walter Raleigh delivered a 45-minute improvised speech

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:59.360
 telling the crowd about his life.

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:03.360
 I do like the idea that he was trying to do a bit of a go-slow.

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:07.360
 And another important thing that happened that year.

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:12.360
 Was the person with the axe to sort of catch on a bing about to slam it down the road?

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:13.360
 Oh, no, no.

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:16.360
 It was one year old, definitely.

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:20.360
 So my third memory, I'll get back to my first one.

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:22.360
 Yeah, so this is interesting.

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:30.360
 The day we're recording us, the 28th of October, is the day before the 400th anniversary of his execution.

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:34.360
 The 29th of October was when it happened in 1618.

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:39.360
 And he had an amazing sort of closing ceremony, basically.

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:42.360
 Basically, he had a closing ceremony.

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:45.360
 Where, you know, he did a great speech.

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:46.360
 He made everyone laugh.

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:48.360
 He made people think and cry.

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:52.360
 And then he kissed the axe, I think, and saw the executioner to get on with it.

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:54.360
 And he really went with style.

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:59.360
 In the morning, he had a good breakfast, a pipe of tobacco, and a cup of wine.

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:00.360
 Nice.

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:04.360
 I think that's how I'd like to start my closing ceremony.

00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:06.360
 It sounds like his uncle was too long.

00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:12.360
 I've been to shows like that, and I feel like people went away saying that actually we were hoping to get the last bus home.

00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:13.360
 And...

00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:17.360
 It's almost like poor Andy.

00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:18.360
 Yeah.

00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:20.360
 I'm alright.

00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:24.360
 We haven't told you you're going to be executed at the end of this lunch.

00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:27.360
 Yeah, track it out, mate.

00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:34.360
 So there's a new biography out of what a rally called Patriot or Traitor, and it's by Anabir, and it's got amazing facts.

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:37.360
 Because one thing we do know about is what happened to his head.

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:44.360
 Or we think we know that his wife carried it round in a bag for 29 years.

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:47.360
 Not everywhere she went.

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:48.360
 I think largely.

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:49.360
 I think I know.

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:55.360
 Is it, like, to the shops for milk in the morning, head in a bag.

00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:59.360
 And they've just found a bag in the attic at his son's former home.

00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:02.360
 Although Anabir, the biographer, is very skeptical.

00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:04.360
 She says it's almost definitely not the bag.

00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:10.360
 Yeah, because she said there's a lot of people at the time that said that the head was put in a lever bag, and this bag is not lever.

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:11.360
 There we go.

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:14.360
 Why haven't they looked inside the bag?

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:22.360
 There's just people stroking their chins gathered around this bag.

00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:26.360
 So the head was later taken and buried, wasn't it?

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:27.360
 Yeah.

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:29.360
 They're not with the rest of his body, though, right?

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:30.360
 No.

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:31.360
 Weird, eh?

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:32.360
 It was pretty common, wasn't it?

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:36.360
 I mean, when you were buried, I think you often gave the head to someone.

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:39.360
 Well, quite often the head would be erected on London Bridge, wouldn't it?

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:42.360
 And, you know, so that everyone could see this terrible traitor.

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:45.360
 And then if that failed, you'd give the head to a loved one.

00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:46.360
 Which is nice.

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:51.360
 He had such an interesting life in jail, because it doesn't sound like people were cross with him.

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:53.360
 It actually sounds like quite a nice lifestyle he had in there.

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:59.360
 So he had an annual budget of 208 pounds, which he could buy food with.

00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:02.360
 He had his wife and son move in and live with him.

00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:06.360
 He had three servants in jail.

00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:09.360
 That was when you were really rich, you were allowed to do that, weren't you?

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:10.360
 Right.

00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:11.360
 You're basically in the house arrest.

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:12.360
 Yeah.

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:18.360
 He was put in there by James I, and while he was in the Tower of London, he chewed the royal children.

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:20.360
 I think it's quite trusting, isn't it?

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:22.360
 He's not now high-feeling.

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:23.360
 Yeah.

00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:29.360
 And lots of, so he invented, he was an apothecary as well as a sailor and a courtier and all of this stuff.

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:33.360
 So he invented herbal remedies when he was in there.

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:37.360
 And he invented a thing called, oh my goodness, where is it?

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:42.360
 It's called the great cordial, and it was a cure for everything.

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:44.360
 It had 40 ingredients in it.

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:49.360
 You needed deer horn, viper flesh, cinnamon, orange and lemon rind, and 35 other ingredients.

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:53.360
 And lots of people visited asking for medical advice and for some...

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:54.360
 That's amazing.

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:56.360
 There was another thing that he made, which was...

00:19:56.360 --> 00:20:02.360
 Well, the recipe is take a gallon of strawberries, put them into a pint of aquivite,

00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:05.360
 which is basically pure alcohol, and then leave them for a while.

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:08.360
 Take the strawberries out and drink the alcohol.

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:11.360
 And that was another thing that kind of cured everything.

00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:12.360
 Yeah, I'm sure.

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:14.360
 Yeah, you can believe that.

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:16.360
 He wasn't prisoned a lot though, wasn't he?

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:17.360
 So it was good that it was nice for him.

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:20.360
 He was kind of a bad boy.

00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:21.360
 He probably would have been today.

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:24.360
 He was always getting into scrapes.

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:26.360
 You know, like a Pete Dockety.

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:28.360
 He was like a...

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:30.360
 He was a Pete Dockety of his day.

00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:38.360
 I think he got involved in various spats, one with the Earl of Oxford over whether or not the Earl of Oxford should leave a tennis court.

00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:41.360
 Was like Pete Dockety does today.

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:43.360
 It was that kind of thing.

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:44.360
 But yeah, and he was...

00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:46.360
 He was into prison when he got married, in fact, quite famously.

00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:51.360
 He fell in love with Best Throckmorton and Queen Elizabeth probably fancied him in some way.

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:56.360
 I was attracted to him, and so it was kind of annoyed when he married Best behind her back.

00:20:56.360 --> 00:21:00.360
 He was one of her ladies in waiting, right?

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:03.360
 So she kind of felt betrayed because they got behind her back.

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:07.360
 And the amazing thing, and this is where I think those chewed addresses came in very useful,

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:13.360
 is that before marrying her, he, like a lad, impregnated to Best Throckmorton,

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:16.360
 I don't mean like a lad, guys.

00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:22.360
 No, he got Best pregnant, and she had to conceal it.

00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:26.360
 So she stayed at court, waiting on Queen Elizabeth the whole time,

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:28.360
 but managed to conceal that she was pregnant.

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:31.360
 And she only went and stayed with her brother two weeks before giving birth.

00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:34.360
 And then as soon as she gave birth, she had to go back immediately.

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:35.360
 They had roughs those days, didn't they?

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:40.360
 So maybe her rough just got bigger and bigger and bigger until it was to the ground.

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:41.360
 Like the next thing?

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:42.360
 Yeah.

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:44.360
 Drooping down over her belly.

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:45.360
 Yeah.

00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:49.360
 What a weird place to start with your disguise for pregnancy.

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:52.360
 Handy, we need to help.

00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:54.360
 I've got an idea, guys.

00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:56.360
 How are you going to go from your pregnancy?

00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:58.360
 I don't know, I might use my shoe.

00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:02.360
 We'll make the pointy shoe, point upward and upward and upward.

00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:06.360
 So a lot of people hated him as well,

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:08.360
 because he was really popular with Queen Elizabeth.

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:10.360
 And he was also extremely handsome, apparently.

00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:12.360
 He was one of the most handsome men in the whole age.

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:15.360
 And so people had it in for him.

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:19.360
 There was a popular song, which called him a "dammnable fiend of hell."

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:20.360
 Yeah.

00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:23.360
 And even his friends didn't really like him either.

00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:26.360
 Generally, a lot of people just really didn't like him.

00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:30.360
 When Elizabeth died, he got on the wrong side of James I.

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:32.360
 Not basically James I didn't want anything to do with him,

00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:34.360
 because he was to do with Elizabeth.

00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:36.360
 And then he got censored prison because of that.

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:39.360
 And then basically the whole opinion of him changed,

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:41.360
 and everyone kind of really liked him after that.

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:44.360
 And some people said this is the quickest that anyone has ever gone

00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:46.360
 from being completely hated by everyone

00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:49.360
 to being like, roundly loved by everyone.

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:52.360
 And when they he did that 45-minute speech,

00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:54.360
 straight afterwards, loads of people printed it

00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:55.360
 and started handing it out.

00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:56.360
 It's like pamphlet.

00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:57.360
 So you could read about this thing,

00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:59.360
 because it was all about how he should never have been

00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:03.360
 censored prison and how contemptible James I wasn't stuff like that.

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:07.360
 So then James I government started setting about its legal case

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:11.360
 at tedious length with more pamphlets going out to everyone.

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:13.360
 And every time they sent out a new pamphlet,

00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:15.360
 people just went, "Now, I'm on this guy's side."

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:18.360
 And actually a load of these printouts of his final speech,

00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:20.360
 there's still like a hundred of them out there.

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:22.360
 Still being circulated.

00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:27.360
 He was let free for one last paper.

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:29.360
 So he was put in prison in 1603.

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:31.360
 Not the food in KP.

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:33.360
 That was his final meal.

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:36.360
 And everyone said, "How humble, so alter."

00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:38.360
 Just once one paper.

00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:41.360
 No, but he was imprisoned for 13 years,

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:42.360
 1603 to 1616.

00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:45.360
 And then he managed to win James I round.

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:48.360
 And he said, "Look, give me permission to sail to Guyana

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:50.360
 and have an adventure."

00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:54.360
 Well, he said, "Basically, can I go and find the lost city of Eldorado?"

00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:55.360
 Yes, that's true.

00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:57.360
 James I went, "Okay."

00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:01.360
 Unfortunately, he did not find the lost city of Eldorado.

00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:05.360
 And then he attacked the Spanish who James was trying to suck up to at the time.

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:08.360
 So when he got back, he was put in prison again.

00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:13.360
 When he was on his little caper in Guyana, he was one of the first people.

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:14.360
 I just like this.

00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:15.360
 It's not really to do the rest.

00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:18.360
 But he was on one of the first people to write about the Amazons.

00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:20.360
 You know, the female warrior people.

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:22.360
 And he said that he went to a village in Guyana.

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:25.360
 And he was told by the people there that every April,

00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:29.360
 the Amazons came to the village and cast lots for the men of the village.

00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:32.360
 And then they would have their way with the men like a bunch of lads.

00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:37.360
 And then nine months later, they would return all of the male births

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:39.360
 and keep all of the females.

00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:42.360
 And he wrote about that as if it was completely true.

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:44.360
 Is it true as well on his travels that he named...

00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:45.360
 He went to America.

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:46.360
 Is that right?

00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:47.360
 And he named...

00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:48.360
 You know, went to...

00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:49.360
 He didn't.

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:50.360
 He didn't until North America.

00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:51.360
 Yeah.

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:52.360
 He never set foot.

00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:53.360
 He never set foot.

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:54.360
 But he organized the trip.

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:55.360
 He organized the trip and he named it.

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:56.360
 Yeah.

00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:58.360
 And he named Virginia after Queen Elizabeth.

00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:01.360
 Yeah, I'm just going to name a stay after your sexual history.

00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:02.360
 Yeah.

00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:03.360
 Isn't that incredible?

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:07.360
 Is that insane from a distance just going virgin?

00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:11.360
 It's a good thing that I guess it's not called slagadonia or something like that.

00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:16.360
 Lucky.

00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:18.360
 Oh, the slagadonia national part, though.

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:20.360
 I mean, it's worth a visit.

00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:22.360
 It's the lads' lads' lads' bill.

00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:26.360
 Can't believe I've just accidentally brought back lads.

00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:29.360
 I feel like society is just about to stomp it down.

00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:31.360
 What have I done?

00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:34.360
 We're going to have to move on soon to our next fact.

00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:37.360
 There's some stuff about executions.

00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:41.360
 Executions were pretty weird back in the olden days.

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:44.360
 So being pressed to death was quite odd.

00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:46.360
 I didn't like an iron.

00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:48.360
 So you would just lie down.

00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:51.360
 And so this is if you went to court and you asked for your innocent or guilty

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:54.360
 and you refused to say either, you got pressed to death.

00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:57.360
 Which is just having stuff gradually piled on top of you.

00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:01.360
 And it could last for days before you actually perished.

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:05.360
 But yeah, apparently often people will come and watch this as you did with executioners.

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:07.360
 That's quite a slow watch.

00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:09.360
 That's like watching a test match, isn't it?

00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:10.360
 Yeah.

00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:15.360
 Also, if your stuff's going on top of you, as soon as there's a first layer, what are you watching?

00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:16.360
 You're just watching more.

00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:18.360
 You're watching more layers going on.

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:20.360
 It doesn't cover you up. It's a weight.

00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:24.360
 But apparently bystanders would often take pity and sit on them.

00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:27.360
 Oh, really? Yeah, to speed it up.

00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:29.360
 That's very funny. Wow.

00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:32.360
 I was reading that in ancient Greece, there was a way of execution,

00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:38.360
 which is that you used to take the person and put them when it was in a sort of a boiling sun desert-y bit.

00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:40.360
 And you would...

00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:43.360
 To the boiling sun desert-y bit.

00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:50.360
 This is during the Monty Python dynasty in Ancient Greece, wasn't it?

00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:55.360
 Yeah, so you would smear them with milk and honey,

00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:58.360
 and then you would leave them to all the stinging insects that were out there.

00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:01.360
 So if they came back, and they would leave you for something like 20 days,

00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:03.360
 if they came back and you were still not dead,

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:07.360
 they would then take you, dress you up in women's clothing,

00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:09.360
 if this was a man, and they would...

00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:12.360
 When everyone would walk with you to the edge of a cliff,

00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:15.360
 and then they would just throw you off the cliff.

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:18.360
 Why the women's clothing?

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:21.360
 Just one last paper.

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:26.360
 There were three men who were executed.

00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:30.360
 They were called the Kato Street Conspirators, and this was in 1820.

00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:33.360
 They were called Brunt, Ings, and Thistlewood.

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:35.360
 And they really kind of faced down their own death.

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:38.360
 So Brunt, he refused to be blindfolded.

00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:42.360
 He took a pinch of snuff and said some, like, a little speech.

00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:47.360
 James Ings, he started to really, really loudly sing death or liberty.

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:53.360
 And then Thistlewood said, "Be quiet, Ings. We can die without all that noise."

00:27:53.360 --> 00:28:00.360
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is my fact.

00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:04.360
 My fact this week is that, according to a new scientific study,

00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:09.360
 the single most convincing word a human can use to prove that they are human,

00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:12.360
 and not a robot is the word poop.

00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:16.360
 It's not that robots can't say poop, is it?

00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:18.360
 No, what is it?

00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:22.360
 What it was is basically this is a sort of what they call a minimal churing test.

00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:26.360
 So you got your classic churing test where the idea is you're trying to find

00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:29.360
 whether or not a computer is a computer and a human is a computer.

00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:32.360
 So I have a conversation with a computer and it's whether or not I can tell

00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:34.360
 whether it's a computer or not, right?

00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:35.360
 Yes, exactly.

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:38.360
 So in this study, they tried to reduce it from a conversation to a single word.

00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:45.360
 And what they then asked over 936 people was specifically 936 people.

00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:48.360
 Well, weirdly, I thought it was 1889 people.

00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:51.360
 Which admittedly is more of a map.

00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:54.360
 This is so weird, because I've got four.

00:28:54.360 --> 00:29:05.360
 Yeah, okay, so yeah, somewhere between four and all the people in the world.

00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:10.360
 And what they were asked was to say one single word that they thought would represent

00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:12.360
 the word that a human could use to say, "I'm human."

00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:17.360
 And in the version of number of people I have, 936 answered,

00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:20.360
 but only 428 unique words came out of it.

00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:22.360
 So there was a lot of doubling up on words.

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:24.360
 They then took the 10 most popular words.

00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:28.360
 And in a sort of world cup setting, like a football world cup,

00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:32.360
 they paired each word against each other and saw which ones came out as the best.

00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:34.360
 And the single one word--

00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:35.360
 Sorry, what do you mean best?

00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:39.360
 What do you mean is so they showed both to humans, even though they were both human words.

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:44.360
 Yes. They showed them both to a single human and that human said which one of them was actually from a computer.

00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:46.360
 Actually, neither of them were, but they were like,

00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:49.360
 "I think that the human one is poop."

00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:51.360
 Or "I think the human one is love."

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:53.360
 Or "I think the human one is pineapple or whatever."

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:57.360
 I see. So as humans working out, which word they thought--

00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:00.360
 They were picking what they thought was most likely chosen by a human.

00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:04.360
 Exactly. And the 10 words, the 10 finalists were,

00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:12.360
 "Love, please, mercy, human, compassion, empathy, robot, clever."

00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:16.360
 The clever, they wouldn't pick the word robot, were they?

00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:20.360
 That's what they're expecting us to do.

00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:24.360
 Banana, they wouldn't think of banana.

00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:28.360
 Alive and poop. And then poop came out as the winner.

00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:29.360
 Poops the number one word.

00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:33.360
 I guess it's because poop just, like, too stupid a word to think that anyone would program it.

00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:35.360
 Anyone would program it into a robot.

00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:39.360
 If we're creating robots, let's make them forget our cook-ups.

00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:42.360
 But if robots listen to this podcast,

00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:45.360
 this is the problem that the scientific paper has been uploaded to the internet.

00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:48.360
 So they now will have learned it if there is an AI.

00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:50.360
 So we're done. We're done.

00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:53.360
 No, we just need to look for the human-looking robot.

00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:57.360
 There's just going poop, poop, poop, poop, poop.

00:30:57.360 --> 00:31:01.360
 The next term, if we were a lot less scary, wouldn't it?

00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:07.360
 So robots and poo have been related in the past, haven't they?

00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:11.360
 Yeah, in fact, one of the earliest robots was a pooing robot.

00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:12.360
 No.

00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:14.360
 I don't think we've mentioned this before.

00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:16.360
 But this is in the 1700s,

00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:20.360
 and a French engineer called Jacques de Valle-Canceau, or Valle-Canceau,

00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:23.360
 created this robot duck.

00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:29.360
 And he did it to show off the fact he created a robot duck that you could feed.

00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:33.360
 And then it would process the food in its stomach, and it would poo it out the other end.

00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:35.360
 It was gold-plated.

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:36.360
 It could quack.

00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:39.360
 It could sit up really high on its legs on its tiptoes.

00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:41.360
 It could drink.

00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:43.360
 And he would feed it grain, and then it would pass through its stomach,

00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:46.360
 have chemicals added, and come out of its anus, all digested.

00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:47.360
 Is it a digested thing?

00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:48.360
 It was 1700s.

00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:50.360
 Yeah, it was later revealed that it was...

00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:51.360
 It was a duck.

00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:52.360
 Of course.

00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:53.360
 It was a duck.

00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:54.360
 It covered the duck in gold-placing.

00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:56.360
 It was incredibly cruel, actually.

00:31:56.360 --> 00:32:04.360
 It was revealed that he was just making it up.

00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:08.360
 He fed this robot one thing, and then he had another compartment that spat out other stuff.

00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:12.360
 And this has only discovered a century later when a clockmaker found this robot

00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:14.360
 shitting duck in a cupboard somewhere.

00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:15.360
 Oh, wow.

00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:19.360
 And looked at it, and then Bizarrely ended up in the hands of Houdini.

00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:23.360
 But, yeah, this was one of the earliest robots.

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:25.360
 And this is the thing that I think scientists had to do quite a lot.

00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:28.360
 So, it wasn't really his fault that he'd been a bit fraudulent.

00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:33.360
 It was to impress your patrons, so we're the ones paying you in order to make genuine scientific discoveries.

00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:37.360
 You had to do impressive stuff, like make a robot duck, have a poo.

00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:39.360
 And so, he did that.

00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:43.360
 But actually, from the 17th century, we have managed to get to the 21st century,

00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:46.360
 and we have now invented robots that do poo.

00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:48.360
 So, this is the EcoBot 3.

00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:51.360
 And it's made by Bristol Robotics Laboratory in the UK.

00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:54.360
 They did all of the number two.

00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:57.360
 What's wrong with these scientists?

00:32:57.360 --> 00:33:02.360
 I like the idea that a number three is a robot poo.

00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:03.360
 Oh, yeah.

00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:05.360
 Which one have you done?

00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:08.360
 I think I've done a number three this time.

00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:10.360
 I've switched sides.

00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:13.360
 That's the cheering test. That's what you found out.

00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:14.360
 You're in the wrong one.

00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:21.360
 Number three. Robots.

00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:26.360
 Sorry, go on. So, EcoBot number three.

00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:28.360
 Yeah, there's not much more to say.

00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:32.360
 Basically, it picks up leaves, and it picks up detritus from the ground,

00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:33.360
 and it turns it into energy.

00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:37.360
 And then it actually does make it, and you can see that videos off it.

00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:41.360
 If you really want to, you can see it kind of making little poo's.

00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:42.360
 Wow.

00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:45.360
 There's one that was made in the last couple of years,

00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:48.360
 where they think it could be used to clean up the oceans at some point.

00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:50.360
 Basically, a robot that is able to feed itself,

00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:52.360
 because at the moment they have to be powered by humans.

00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:54.360
 Yeah, so it's actually a really good idea.

00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:58.360
 If you can get a robot that can just use organic material to power itself,

00:33:58.360 --> 00:33:59.360
 then you don't need batteries anymore.

00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:02.360
 But at the moment, it's just a robot that sits in a bath

00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:06.360
 and just about the organic matter gives it enough energy to open its mouth again,

00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:08.360
 just while a more organic matter.

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:09.360
 That's what it's in it.

00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:12.360
 It's a degrading life for future robots who are looking back.

00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:16.360
 That's going to be a really embarrassing part of their history.

00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:19.360
 There is another robot poo connection.

00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:21.360
 It's a semi-connection.

00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:26.360
 So there are farms where, even now, they've deployed robots in the henhouses,

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:28.360
 and there's sort of flat, low robots.

00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:31.360
 They look a bit like those vacuum cleaning robots, you know,

00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:32.360
 the Roombas, those things.

00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:33.360
 They're sort of a big disc.

00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:37.360
 And they move through the henhouse, pushing birds out of the way,

00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:39.360
 like bullies, basically.

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:42.360
 But this is a thing that farmers normally have to do,

00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:45.360
 because you have to keep the birds slightly well exercised when they're in a barn,

00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:48.360
 so every so often you just walk through moving them all out of the way,

00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:51.360
 and they shuffle around a bit, and they stretch their legs.

00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:54.360
 But this robot has now taken that role,

00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:58.360
 and the other thing it solves is it solves the problem of floor eggs,

00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:01.360
 which is when birds lay eggs not in the assigned nesting areas.

00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:03.360
 Sometimes they just lay an egg on the floor.

00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:05.360
 If this robot's around, the birds are so freaked out by it

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:07.360
 that they don't lay any floor eggs.

00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:09.360
 So it's cruel and kind.

00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:13.360
 I was on Twitter, and I found this one sweet,

00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:15.360
 which is kind of slightly related.

00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:20.360
 Do not, under any circumstances, let your Roomba run over dog poop.

00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:23.360
 Because if that happens, he will spread the dog poop

00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:26.360
 all over every conceivable surface within its reach,

00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:31.360
 resulting in a house that resembles a Jackson Pollock poop painting.

00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:36.360
 In a public service, yeah.

00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:38.360
 There was a new story about that.

00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:39.360
 Oh, sir.

00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:41.360
 Yeah, this couple woke up in the morning,

00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:44.360
 their house was just, as you say, poo everywhere.

00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:46.360
 And the husband immediately said,

00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:49.360
 "I think the Roomba must have gone under control overnight."

00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:55.360
 That's a run out and buy a Roomba.

00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:56.360
 And a dog.

00:35:56.360 --> 00:36:07.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:10.360
 This is about the churring test, right?

00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:14.360
 And robots overtaking us, maybe, one day.

00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:18.360
 And people keep on trying to subject robots to the churring test,

00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:22.360
 which has been going-- it's actually called the Lubner Prize.

00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:24.360
 I think it's been going to us about 1991,

00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:25.360
 which is where people compete.

00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:28.360
 They make robots and they compete to see if their robots can

00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:31.360
 convince the judges that they're actually human.

00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:34.360
 And still, no one's been able to come anywhere near close.

00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:36.360
 So the Raining World Champion for it,

00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:39.360
 which has still never convinced anyone that it's a human.

00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:42.360
 It's just come kind of the closest.

00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:44.360
 Is this robot called Mitsuku,

00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:47.360
 who claims to be an 18-year-old girl from Leeds?

00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:50.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:52.360
 I don't really know why.

00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:54.360
 And she's one four times running.

00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:57.360
 But she was made by this guy called Steve Warsick.

00:36:57.360 --> 00:37:00.360
 And he was just a techno DJ who had--

00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:03.360
 he wanted to be mixing tunes online.

00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:05.360
 And he was uploading all this dance music

00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:07.360
 that he was making and techno music.

00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:10.360
 And he developed this kind of complimentary teddy bear chatbot

00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:12.360
 just for the site as like an extra thing.

00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:15.360
 And he realized everyone way, way preferred the chatbot

00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:17.360
 to hit any of his music.

00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:19.360
 And so he focused on that.

00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:21.360
 And he's gone on to massively win this.

00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:24.360
 So online, you can talk to Mitsuku.

00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:26.360
 And I thought I'd give it a go to see if I could tell

00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:28.360
 if she was robot or not.

00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:30.360
 I mean, I knew she was, but.

00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:33.360
 So she said, how are you?

00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:34.360
 And I said, I'm pretty good.

00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:35.360
 How's things there?

00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:38.360
 And she said, I know you are good.

00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:41.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:44.360
 And I said, how do you know that?

00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:48.360
 And she said, because everybody knows things about themselves.

00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:53.360
 And then I said, but you said you knew it about me, not you.

00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:55.360
 And then she said, what I said earlier is irrelevant.

00:37:55.360 --> 00:38:00.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:04.360
 And then I said, actually, if I'm trying to work out

00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:07.360
 if you're a robot, then I'd say that weird things like that

00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:09.360
 are quite relevant, actually.

00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:11.360
 And she said, yes, I am a robot.

00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:17.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:20.360
 So I think I kind of worked out then at that stage

00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:23.360
 what the kind of floor in Mitsuku was.

00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:24.360
 So I reloaded it.

00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:26.360
 And she said, how are you?

00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:28.360
 And I said, are you a robot?

00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:29.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:31.360
 And she said, I certainly am.

00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:37.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:39.360
 I actually, I've just remembered.

00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:41.360
 I've spoken to Mitsuku as well.

00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:43.360
 Yeah, I did a-- and this is bizarrely.

00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:44.360
 It's online.

00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:45.360
 I think it's on YouTube.

00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:48.360
 I've interviewed not only Mitsuku, but the creator,

00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:49.360
 what's his name?

00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:51.360
 Not of Mitsuku, but Lubniks.

00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:52.360
 Steve Rawstick.

00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:53.360
 Steve Rawstick.

00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:55.360
 No, no, the other one, who the price--

00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:56.360
 Oh, the Lubner price.

00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:57.360
 Yeah, Lubner.

00:38:57.360 --> 00:38:59.360
 So I interviewed Lubner, Mitsuku,

00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:02.360
 and like three other chatbots over a Skype on--

00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:04.360
 they were all in different locations.

00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:07.360
 And we had this big chat with each other for like half an hour.

00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:08.360
 Was it?

00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:09.360
 Was it?

00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:10.360
 Go hear it, or was it?

00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:12.360
 No, that was not coherent.

00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:14.360
 You know what I'm like?

00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:16.360
 I don't think there's guys real.

00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:21.360
 This is-- this is fucking weird.

00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:24.360
 I don't think a robot would say the boily hot deserty place.

00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:27.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:29.360
 Let's make our excuses and get out of here.

00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:30.360
 I'm going for a number three.

00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:31.360
 I'll be honest with you.

00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:34.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:35.360
 Oh.

00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:40.360
 You know that Zuckerberg now has his own AI sort of how

00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:42.360
 2001 space, obviously, how.

00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:44.360
 He has it in his own house that he--

00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:45.360
 Like an assistant kind of.

00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:46.360
 Yeah, so it runs the house.

00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:49.360
 So it's, you know, turned the-- kind of like what Amazon Echo

00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:51.360
 and so on has become.

00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:55.360
 He-- it's called Jarvis, which is actually a dedicated name to--

00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:56.360
 Oh, is it Ironman?

00:39:56.360 --> 00:39:57.360
 Ironman.

00:39:57.360 --> 00:39:58.360
 Ironman, exactly.

00:39:58.360 --> 00:39:59.360
 So it's called Jarvis.

00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:03.360
 But he has it voiced by-- and he asked the internet for suggestions--

00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:05.360
 Morgan Freeman.

00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:06.360
 Oh, wow.

00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:09.360
 Morgan Freeman is the official Jarvis voice for his house.

00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:10.360
 His house.

00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:14.360
 Recorded specifically for his AI, we can turn the lights on,

00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:15.360
 you know, kind of thing.

00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:17.360
 That was absolutely uncanny.

00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:19.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:22.360
 That is unbelievably unimaginative of him.

00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:24.360
 He just went for the obvious voice.

00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:26.360
 I only got one for Amwiddikam.

00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:29.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:30.360
 It's imaginative.

00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:32.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:36.360
 You know there's a robot psychiatrist in the world.

00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:39.360
 It's a woman called Dr. Joanne Pransky.

00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:42.360
 And she's been a robot psychiatrist since 1986.

00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:47.360
 And she has actually trademarked the term robot psychiatrist.

00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:50.360
 So she's the only one who's allowed to be one now.

00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:54.360
 But yeah, the reason she became one is because she said she knew that one day

00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:57.360
 someone would take a robot to see a shrink.

00:40:57.360 --> 00:41:02.360
 So she was the formal psychiatrist of Val, who was a robo receptionist,

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:06.360
 in 2004, and she went through this long email correspondence.

00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:08.360
 So sometimes therapy is done over email.

00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:13.360
 And apparently she counseled Val on issues related to humans,

00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:17.360
 the workplace, and her future goal of becoming a lounge singer.

00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:19.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:20.360
 For old Val.

00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:21.360
 That's very cool.

00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:25.360
 I really thought you meant that she was a robot who performs

00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:26.360
 the role of a psychiatrist.

00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:28.360
 That's what I thought of first, sorry.

00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:30.360
 The role of a psychiatrist is for--

00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:32.360
 Because that would be quite effective.

00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:35.360
 Because you could just program it to say, hmm.

00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:36.360
 No, I did that.

00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:39.360
 That was the first ever robot who talked back to you.

00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:41.360
 And our conversation is called Eliza.

00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:42.360
 And she was wrapped in the '60s.

00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:44.360
 And you can still have conversations with Eliza online.

00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:46.360
 So they put her up online now.

00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:48.360
 And she is not a good therapist.

00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:49.360
 Really?

00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:52.360
 So well, first of all, the website says, imagine you're a really depressed

00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:54.360
 or anxious person and type your question in.

00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:56.360
 So I just made some stuff up.

00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:59.360
 So I said, my earlobes are so big, I get paranoid about them when I go out in public.

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:00.360
 Anna, no.

00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:01.360
 Really?

00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:02.360
 I do.

00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:06.360
 And she replied, never ever.

00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:07.360
 This doesn't make any sense.

00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:09.360
 Be sure she wasn't a member of all sayings.

00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:13.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:15.360
 I said, nobody loves me.

00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:17.360
 And she said, please continue, which--

00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:18.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:19.360
 Wow.

00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:21.360
 Please continue as a stock and trade line.

00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:22.360
 That's good.

00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:23.360
 It is, isn't it?

00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:24.360
 I suppose.

00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:25.360
 Yeah.

00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:28.360
 I was hoping for a little bit more of a sympathetic response.

00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:29.360
 Right.

00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:30.360
 A response.

00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:31.360
 We're out of time.

00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:32.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:33.360
 Yeah.

00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:38.360
 So humans, we do better on tests if we are being watched by robots that we perceive as cruel.

00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:39.360
 OK.

00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:42.360
 So it's not a very comforting result.

00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:45.360
 But basically, they tested different groups of people.

00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:47.360
 They tested one big group of people, I guess.

00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:51.360
 And they both had a little conversation with a chatbot.

00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:56.360
 And the chatbot was either quite friendly to them or said things like,

00:42:56.360 --> 00:43:00.360
 I do not value friendship and had a slightly mean face.

00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:04.360
 And all the people taking the test were then asked to complete a task.

00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:09.360
 And the ones who were being watched in the corner of the screen by the cruel robot

00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:11.360
 worked faster and made fewer mistakes.

00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:12.360
 Wow.

00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:13.360
 Really?

00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:14.360
 Wow.

00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:17.360
 Is that because you're not distracted by trying to socialize with them?

00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:19.360
 I think it's because you're absolutely terrified.

00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:20.360
 Yeah.

00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:21.360
 I'm afraid so.

00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:22.360
 Yeah.

00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:25.360
 I do like that as a response in conversation next time I'm trapped in one.

00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:28.360
 I'll just say, I do not value friendship.

00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:30.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:32.360
 Enjoy this party.

00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:34.360
 We're going to have to move on shortly.

00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:35.360
 Oh, one last factor.

00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:36.360
 Yeah, yeah, go for it.

00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:37.360
 OK.

00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:41.360
 The final proof act is about a suburb in Madrid, which was called Brunetti.

00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:43.360
 And it was trying to deal with dog poo.

00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:46.360
 And they had an incredible method of dealing with it.

00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:49.360
 So when the owner didn't pick up after the dog,

00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:52.360
 they have volunteer detectives all over the town.

00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:54.360
 And the volunteers would spy on dog walkers.

00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:57.360
 They spotted a dog walker not picking up after their dog.

00:43:57.360 --> 00:43:59.360
 And they would just approach them and get into a conversation

00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:01.360
 and say, oh, he's a cute dog.

00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:02.360
 What's his name?

00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:03.360
 And they'd get the dog's name.

00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:05.360
 And then all the dogs' names were in a register.

00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:07.360
 Because when you buy a dog in that suburb,

00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:08.360
 you have to register it.

00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:09.360
 Oh, yeah.

00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:14.360
 And then they would pick up the poo and mail it to the owner of the dog.

00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:15.360
 Wow.

00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:18.360
 This happened in suburb in Madrid in 2013.

00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:20.360
 So they would get a gift box.

00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:21.360
 I feel it up.

00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:24.360
 Wow, if you live in Madrid, do not buy a room back.

00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:30.360
 And the mayor said it improved things massively by 70%.

00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:33.360
 And it would just word got around that you'll get poo sent to you

00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:34.360
 in the post.

00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:38.360
 And the previous method they had was having a life-like remote control dog poo

00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:40.360
 and using it to follow around dog owners.

00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:45.360
 That's amazing.

00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:46.360
 That's a detective.

00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:49.360
 That is a rough game to get as a detective, isn't it?

00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:51.360
 If you've read Arthur Conan Doyle,

00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:53.360
 and you've had the size of that,

00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:55.360
 then Sherlock Holmes your whole life.

00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:58.360
 And what happens when you upset the chief is going,

00:44:58.360 --> 00:45:00.360
 "I'm finally in you back down to dog poo."

00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:03.360
 Give me a gun, your badge, and your scoop.

00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:08.360
 Time for our final fact of the show.

00:45:08.360 --> 00:45:10.360
 And that is Chazinski.

00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:14.360
 My fact this week is that if you shake your keys at a moth,

00:45:14.360 --> 00:45:17.360
 it thinks you're a bat and drops out of the sky.

00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:20.360
 It's just...

00:45:20.360 --> 00:45:21.360
 Wow.

00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:24.360
 And I have to say, so I found this out a few days ago,

00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:26.360
 and I've been desperately looking for moths.

00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:30.360
 And I've been carrying my keys everywhere, and I haven't seen one,

00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:31.360
 so I'm unable to try it.

00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:33.360
 But apparently this is definitely true.

00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:38.360
 And it's because so bats track down their prey by using echolocation.

00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:42.360
 So they send out sound signals that bounce off the things

00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:44.360
 that they want to eat, and that tells them where they are.

00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:48.360
 And moths have learned to detect these bat noises.

00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:51.360
 And the sounds that your keys make when you shake them,

00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:54.360
 they emit a very high frequency sound that we can't hear.

00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:56.360
 So as well as making the key shaking sound,

00:45:56.360 --> 00:45:58.360
 they're also emitting the higher frequency sound

00:45:58.360 --> 00:46:01.360
 that the moths can hear that sounds exactly like a bat

00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:03.360
 when it's trying to eat them.

00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:05.360
 So what they do is they plummet into the ground.

00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:08.360
 Or they have various evasive mechanisms,

00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:10.360
 so they do loop the loop sometimes.

00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:12.360
 Oh, that sounds cool.

00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:13.360
 Yeah.

00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:17.360
 If you can make a moth through a loop on command, yeah.

00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:19.360
 That is a Britain's Got Talent I would like.

00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:22.360
 James Harkin.

00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:25.360
 And his amazing moth.

00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:30.360
 But yeah, that is very cool.

00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:31.360
 Very cool.

00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:34.360
 You know, you gloss over it, but the fact that if you wave keys

00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:37.360
 at any of us, you're going to make sounds that we can't hear,

00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:39.360
 like how that makes them as well.

00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:43.360
 Yeah, it's going to defenal the moths in the York area.

00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:48.360
 So the bats versus moths is the great battle of our time, I think.

00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:49.360
 Yeah.

00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:50.360
 Isn't it really?

00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:51.360
 Very much so.

00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:53.360
 Because they've just been trying to out evolve each other

00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:57.360
 for so many tens of thousands of thousands of thousands of years.

00:46:57.360 --> 00:47:00.360
 And well, as soon as one overtakes the other one overtakes back.

00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:03.360
 So moths didn't use to have ears a long time ago

00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:05.360
 and then moths have evolved ears

00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:07.360
 because they realise that bats were letting off these sounds

00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:09.360
 and then it is to detect them.

00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:12.360
 And so 50,000 species of moths have ears.

00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:16.360
 They have them in various places on their belly or their legs

00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:18.360
 or in their mouth, some of them.

00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:21.360
 Oh, it just sounds like a meeting where it's like,

00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:23.360
 do you know what's screwing us up with these bats?

00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:24.360
 No ears.

00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:25.360
 What are we going to do?

00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:27.360
 We're going to get ears.

00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:30.360
 In the normal place, everywhere.

00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:33.360
 A thing about deaf moths, actually,

00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:37.360
 is that there is a parasitic mite that loves living in moths ears.

00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:39.360
 And it's the only place they can live.

00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:43.360
 But, ingeniously, they're never found in both ears.

00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:46.360
 And so why is that?

00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:48.360
 Is it to keep the host alive?

00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:49.360
 Exactly.

00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:50.360
 Yeah.

00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:52.360
 So one mite will go into one ear.

00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:53.360
 It doesn't matter if left or right.

00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:56.360
 But as soon as it's gone into one, it lets off a bunch of pheromones

00:47:56.360 --> 00:47:58.360
 telling its other mites to go into that ear.

00:47:58.360 --> 00:48:00.360
 Because if the other mites go into the other ear,

00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:03.360
 the moth goes deaf, it gets eaten by a bat.

00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:04.360
 All the mites are dead.

00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:06.360
 Plan fails.

00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:08.360
 Caper ends.

00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:10.360
 That's awesome.

00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:20.360
 So the next thing you do after you've evolved ears,

00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:22.360
 and then the bats kind of get wise to that,

00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:24.360
 you evolve echolocation.

00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:27.360
 And that means that you can kind of jam their signal.

00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:30.360
 So their signal comes across, but you can send other echolocation

00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:32.360
 at the bat, and it confuses it.

00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:35.360
 And there's quite a lot of species of moth that do that.

00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:38.360
 A lot of them do it by rubbing their genitals on their abdomen.

00:48:38.360 --> 00:48:39.360
 Yeah.

00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:41.360
 A convenient excuse.

00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:43.360
 If caught.

00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:45.360
 Oh, I thought I heard a bat.

00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:52.360
 There is...

00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:53.360
 Wait, sorry.

00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:54.360
 What does that do?

00:48:54.360 --> 00:48:55.360
 It scrambles there.

00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:58.360
 So, basically, you're a bat and you're sending your signals across,

00:48:58.360 --> 00:49:02.360
 but now you're getting weird kind of signals that aren't the ones that you're sending back.

00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:04.360
 So that kind of confuses you.

00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:07.360
 Okay, so it's not that you don't want to eat something that's fiddling with itself.

00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:14.360
 So there are some called tiger moths.

00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:18.360
 And they make sounds, which help bats to find them.

00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:20.360
 This is very weird.

00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:22.360
 But the reason that they do it is because when they're caterpillars,

00:49:22.360 --> 00:49:25.360
 they feed on a lot of toxic plants.

00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:29.360
 And these toxins remain in their bodies after they grow up and after they turn into moths.

00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:31.360
 So they make a sound to say to bats.

00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:34.360
 They basically run around shouting, "I'm disgusting, I'm disgusting."

00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:38.360
 And then there are other moths, which do impressions of tiger moths.

00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:39.360
 Yeah.

00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:42.360
 Even though they are not toxic themselves, they're bluffing,

00:49:42.360 --> 00:49:46.360
 thinking that the predators won't want to eat them because they think that they are...

00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:50.360
 So that's actually the next level after the plane with yourself doesn't work anymore.

00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:53.360
 Then you go into mimicry, which is what you're saying.

00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:56.360
 And then you go into the final thing that they found quite recently,

00:49:56.360 --> 00:49:58.360
 which is your tail structure.

00:49:58.360 --> 00:50:00.360
 And that is basically...

00:50:00.360 --> 00:50:02.360
 They've got these bats that have got these really long tails

00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:04.360
 and they've got a wiggly bit at the bottom.

00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:07.360
 And the bats' infrasound comes at it and then comes back.

00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:10.360
 But it only really reflects off the tail bit.

00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:13.360
 So it thinks that it's a much smaller moth than it actually is.

00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:16.360
 And the bat goes and eats the tail but leaves the rest of the moth free.

00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:17.360
 Oh, wow.

00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:20.360
 I think that's where we're currently at in bat versus moth.

00:50:20.360 --> 00:50:22.360
 Wow.

00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:25.360
 Do you know how they found out the tail thing though?

00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:27.360
 It's classic scientists.

00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:29.360
 They took a bunch of moths and long tails

00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:32.360
 and they just cut, got some scissors and they cut them into very shapes.

00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:33.360
 They were okay.

00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:35.360
 They just, well, they got preyed on much more easily.

00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:38.360
 And then they got a bunch of moths with short tails

00:50:38.360 --> 00:50:42.360
 and they glued on kind of tail shaped stuff to them

00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:44.360
 and found out that they lived much longer.

00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:47.360
 So actually, if you want to do a moth of favour,

00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:51.360
 you can cut out a little bit of extra tail and glue it onto them

00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:53.360
 and then they'll escape the bats.

00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:56.360
 I think I'll just stick to helping old ladies across the road.

00:50:56.360 --> 00:51:02.360
 We're going to have to wrap up shortly.

00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:03.360
 Oh, really?

00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:04.360
 Yeah.

00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:09.360
 I actually didn't know this but no one knows why moths are attracted to light.

00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:11.360
 I just find that bizarre.

00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:13.360
 It's the only thing they really do in front of us.

00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:15.360
 So we've got no idea what they're doing.

00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:17.360
 There's a theory about the moon.

00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:20.360
 But that's been disproved in the last few years.

00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:23.360
 So science thinks that's not the deal.

00:51:23.360 --> 00:51:28.360
 There's one other theory which is that the light

00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:31.360
 that's given off by female moths' pheromones.

00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:34.360
 So I find that amazing in itself that female moths

00:51:34.360 --> 00:51:36.360
 give off these pheromones, which slightly glow.

00:51:36.360 --> 00:51:39.360
 But the light that's given off by them is quite similar

00:51:39.360 --> 00:51:42.360
 to the light that's given off by candles and light bulbs.

00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:45.360
 But it's the same frequency, but not the same wavelength.

00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:46.360
 So we're not sure.

00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:48.360
 Basically, why are they all smashing into light bulbs?

00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:51.360
 This was the problem I had when I went on the Briton's Got Talent,

00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:55.360
 actually, because there's lights everywhere.

00:51:55.360 --> 00:51:57.360
 I went through about 300 moths.

00:51:57.360 --> 00:51:59.360
 I just kept flying into the light.

00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:03.360
 Okay, that is it.

00:52:03.360 --> 00:52:04.360
 That is all of our facts.

 Two-person team.

00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:23.360
 They managed nearly 17 miles from whole to within sea east Yorkshire.

00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:26.360
 Set in the early 80s, I think they were probably drunk.
