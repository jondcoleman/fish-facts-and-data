00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:22,500
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish" a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Culvernt Garden.

3
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:28,240
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Anichesinski, James Harkin, and Alex Bell.

4
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,740
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

5
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:39,100
 and in an open-tacular order, here we go, starting with you, James.

6
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:46,440
 My fat this week is that scientists at MIT have invented an artificial intelligence that can see into the future,

7
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,460
 but it can only tell two seconds into the future.

8
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,420
 [Laughter]

9
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,020
 Totally useless.

10
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,020
 What's it reported about?

11
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:55,020
 It knew you were going to say that.

12
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,820
 [Laughter]

13
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:07,000
 So this is really cool, so what they did was, they got this algorithm to watch TV shows like the office and the Big Bang Theory.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,480
 Okay, and it watched what people did when they met each other, so did you go in for a hug or a kiss or a handshake or a high-five,

15
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:20,000
 and then when you showed them a picture of two people coming near each other, it could work out what they were going to do,

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,960
 whether they were going to high-five, whether they were going to hug, whether they were going to kiss, or whatever.

17
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,460
 So that's basically as far as this has gone so far.

18
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,240
 It's still pretty good for an AI.

19
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:33,920
 Yeah, and I'm surprised it was able to do this based on the office and the Big Bang Theory, both of which are about totally socially inept people.

20
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,900
 I wouldn't have thought given those correct views.

21
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,400
 It's not the best source material to use for an AI.

22
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:45,600
 Maybe it may be AI feel more comfortable watching something closer to their kind of robotic way, so it's like, okay, we're not so different.

23
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,920
 You and us humans.

24
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:55,880
 Yeah, and also, I think that is quite a useful thing, because how many times have you gone in for a hug to someone and they tried to high-five you and slap you in the face or...

25
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:00,660
 Or the kiss/hanshake thing is pretty awkward at times.

26
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:09,560
 Well, in the article, it said that the AI could only get it right 42% of the time, which I was reading wasn't very high, but then I realized I get it right about maybe 2% of the time.

27
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:14,500
 Apparently, normal humans get it right 71% of the time, but obviously that doesn't apply to you.

28
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:18,100
 I think as Alex goes in for the kiss every single time.

29
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:26,740
 And it will get better, won't it, because it'll keep on watching. It'll get better, and 43% of the time versus 71% of the time is not that bad.

30
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:35,740
 Considering all they've done is got it to watch these two things, whereas most humans have had a lot of social interaction to get to where we are, which is still not that good.

31
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:46,540
 The thing it might do in hospitals, if it gets really good, is anticipate a couple of seconds in advance, whether someone, for instance, is about to fall over, like an old person on the way to the loo, and then swoop in and catch them.

32
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:54,400
 Maybe they should show him lots of episodes of Miranda, where she falls down all the time, would you like to learn that?

33
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,460
 Intermediate level, you can see it coming right off.

34
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:59,780
 If it weren't Miranda, it would try to save you every step you took.

35
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:07,900
 Yeah, if you sort of missed a bean episode, it would probably either explode or not let you out the house, so check this out.

36
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:16,980
 There's another AI robotic thing, which plays scissors paper, rock, and beats humans 100% of the time.

37
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:22,220
 - No, it has 100%. - 100% breaks the rules, though. It makes me so angry at this machine.

38
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:26,140
 - It doesn't break the rules. - Yeah, it does. It waits to see what you're doing, and then very quickly...

39
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:36,460
 No, no, no, no, no. No, that's not quite right, because it technically is doing that, but if you're a good game player as well, you would be looking at someone's hand to monitor where you think they're going to go.

40
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:46,300
 So it has a camera on it, which is able to work out hand movements of people and what most likely handshake they're about to take, but it can make a split second decision so that it's at the same time.

41
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:51,380
 It's a microsecond afterwards, because it's seen the way your hand is moving, so it's decided a microsecond afterwards.

42
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:54,940
 - Is it not indistinguishable to humans? - Of course, but it is cheating.

43
00:03:54,940 --> 00:04:00,300
 - It is because rock paper scissors is fundamentally a game of chance. It's like a coin source, you're supposed to try and...

44
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:07,660
 - You use it to decide things that way. - No, because all it's doing is it's calling your tell, it's seeing the handshake that you're bringing.

45
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:12,460
 - It's not cheating. - It is. A hundred percent of the time becomes cheating, because you can work out what's more or less likely.

46
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:17,260
 - I mean, it's cracked it. It knows how to win a game. It's done the impossible.

47
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,660
 - This is war. - Wait, what did James say? What do you think?

48
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:22,140
 - Do you know how we should decide it? - I think it is.

49
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:27,260
 It does look like you're about to high-five done, but I'm not sure what's going to happen.

50
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:34,060
 - So, Robot was arrested recently in September for taking part in a political rally.

51
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:38,460
 It seems a bit dodgy. This was in Russia, and this is actually a robot that I think might have come up before.

52
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:46,940
 You guys might have heard about its promo bot, and it's the one that escaped from its enclosure twice in, I think, about July this year.

53
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:50,300
 - Oh, yeah, but didn't we work out that that was actually... - That's done.

54
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:53,180
 - ...the clues in the name, promo. - Yeah, the clues in the name.

55
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:59,500
 But then it did it again, and then the mechanics at promo bot said that they were trying to reprogram it to stop it escaping.

56
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,500
 - Okay. - So, they're just really sticking to their story.

57
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,980
 - Right. - But now it's taken part in a political rally,

58
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:07,820
 because this robot-supported parliamentary candidate, Valerie Kalachev,

59
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:12,380
 so he went to Moscow and started collecting people's views on politics, asking them what they thought.

60
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:15,500
 - Again, it escaped you did it by itself. I was just going around interviewing people.

61
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:19,420
 - I believe it might have been programmed to do this part. - A dream to be a political correspondent.

62
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,820
 - After it was arrested, did it escape from prison?

63
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:26,140
 - It probably has done now, yeah. - They did put handcuffs on it, apparently.

64
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:29,580
 - They must have, like, idiots, those policemen handcuffing a robot.

65
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:32,620
 - That would have been a fun moment of, and otherwise,

66
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:35,180
 probably depressing, arresting situation.

67
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:38,460
 - I guess you're right. - That's one of the hardest-to-career.

68
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:42,460
 - I mean, I had to handcuff, you know, 25 people at a political protest,

69
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:46,060
 but I did handcuff a robot, and that actually really made me smile.

70
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:49,500
 - This is just one bit of delay. - You're right.

71
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:56,700
 - Also, in robot news, they have set this year in July a new dancing robot

72
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:02,140
 Guinness World Record, 1,000 and 7 robots danced together for a minute,

73
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,580
 and that was what was needed.

74
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:06,780
 And so it was synchronized. You can see a video online.

75
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:12,300
 - It did. - It was in China, and it was a Qingdao beer festival.

76
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,540
 So I guess they were trying to just get headlines for it.

77
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,860
 But you can see all these tiny little robots,

78
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,900
 lots of kinds that you would buy in a shop that make sort of small movements.

79
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:23,100
 They're all doing a dance, and some fall over, so they're discounted,

80
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,020
 but they're still dancing while they're top there.

81
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:28,220
 - You know those like flour, and when you play music,

82
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:30,140
 they just kind of dance to the music.

83
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,060
 Do you remember them from the 90s? - Yes.

84
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:36,060
 - If you put 1,050 of those down, would that be able to technically beat the record?

85
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,700
 - I think they're effectively, that's the robots,

86
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,420
 effectively, that they used anyway. - They were built to dance.

87
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:44,300
 They can't do anything else. - Yeah, so they put down 1,040,

88
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:49,340
 but they lost 33. - I have danced with a robot.

89
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,500
 - You have a robot? - You have Asimov, right?

90
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,100
 - Asimov. - Sorry, Asimov.

91
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:59,260
 No, yeah, we had Asimov who was built by Honda, I think, was he?

92
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:02,380
 And he came on QI, and during the warm-up,

93
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:06,460
 I did a little dance with him, and he kind of just follows your dance patterns,

94
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,060
 I think. I think that's how it worked.

95
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:12,140
 - I know a thing about Asimov, which a guest on our show,

96
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:16,540
 from quite a few episodes ago, "Leave and Skyra", Belgian comedian and scientist.

97
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:19,980
 He was telling me that Asimov, they've programmed him to speak something like,

98
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,620
 I don't know, let's say 30 languages, it might be less,

99
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:25,260
 so that whenever they bring him over to different countries for conferences,

100
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:28,140
 he's able to do a lecture in their language.

101
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:30,940
 But he has one special setting for when he's in Italy,

102
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:34,060
 which is that they've programmed his arms to gesticulate,

103
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,980
 so that when he's talking, it feels more,

104
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:39,340
 because that's how in Italy, they feel more humanized

105
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:41,180
 than the robot standing still. - That's quite cool.

106
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:44,380
 - Yeah, I love it. - And he's also worships the office,

107
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,500
 so you can do the David Brent dance.

108
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:50,140
 - Okay, here's something amazing about telling the future.

109
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:55,420
 - Okay. - There was a study done by a US intelligence group

110
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:59,500
 called the Good Judgment Project, and what they did is they got a load of people,

111
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,460
 about more than 2,000 people, and they started asking them

112
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:06,380
 of things about world events, like, will Robert Mugabi still be

113
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:09,420
 the head of Zimbabwe in two years' time, or whatever?

114
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:13,500
 Like, a load of different things, and a load of people may guess is,

115
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:17,580
 and eventually they siphoned off the top 2% who were doing the best,

116
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:21,340
 and then they put them in a separate group and compared them to everyone else,

117
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:25,820
 and found that that group was four times more accurate than anyone else,

118
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:28,940
 and they're saying that this proves that in humans,

119
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:31,980
 there is a thing called super forecasters,

120
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:34,380
 and these are people who are better than normal humans

121
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,500
 at first seeing the future. - Wow.

122
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,820
 - And are they all on bright and pure with a crystal ball,

123
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,540
 charging people £10 to make their fortune?

124
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:44,540
 - It's weird, they all had different jobs, like,

125
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,220
 one of the best ones was a pharmacist,

126
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,540
 they come from different walks of life and everything.

127
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,940
 - So when you surround these people up and take them out of the met office,

128
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,380
 they should all be the weather forecasters,

129
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,220
 if they're gentle, it's definitely better.

130
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:57,100
 - Well, God, is that how you would use people who have this incredible,

131
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,300
 the right new world order?

132
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:02,220
 - Without a human who could see into the future.

133
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,980
 - Take him to the met office immediately.

134
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:08,380
 - His warning is about a massacre, and no, no, is it going to be cloudy?

135
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:15,660
 - Apparently what these guys are particularly good at is being open-minded,

136
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:20,940
 which you can kind of imagine, it means that they don't let their world views

137
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:26,300
 judge their predictions, and also they change their mind fast and often.

138
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,500
 So whenever...

139
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,940
 - To correct their wrong prediction?

140
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:33,260
 - Yeah, well it is, kind of like that.

141
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:38,380
 So they get something wrong, one time, and a normal human might kind of stubbornly stick

142
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:41,900
 with the same similar kind of predictions, but then these people go, well actually,

143
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:45,100
 you know, I've seen that that happens in the past now, so I'm going to change my mind this time.

144
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,820
 - Oh, okay, I was thinking more like football matches, where they're like,

145
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,300
 okay Manchester United is going to win this one, Liverpool School night.

146
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,740
 - Do you know what, I'm actually thinking that maybe...

147
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:54,620
 - Oh, I'm going to go for rock, no scissors.

148
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:59,500
 - We need to put one of those people against the machine.

149
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,500
 - (laughs)

150
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:09,740
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Alex.

151
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:12,940
 - My fact this week is that Big Ben is falling over.

152
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,140
 - We should get out of here.

153
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:16,860
 - We're not that close.

154
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:17,740
 - No, we're out of reach.

155
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,740
 - Yeah, yeah, what do you mean?

156
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:24,140
 - Okay, well technically the Elizabeth Tower, not Big Ben, obviously, don't write in.

157
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:27,100
 But when they built it, when they built the House of Parliament,

158
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:30,540
 they built it straight obviously, and then I think as soon as the building settled,

159
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:33,740
 it was a little bit leany, and it's got linear and linear, as in,

160
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:36,860
 it's been leaning over more and more away from the House of Parliament,

161
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:41,900
 and they've worked out that if it keeps falling over, at the rate it is falling over,

162
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:45,340
 in about 4,000 years time it'll be leaning as much as the leaning tower of Pisa.

163
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,940
 - Really? How many years?

164
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:50,060
 - 4,000, so it's not like super urgent.

165
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,500
 - So they are going to restore it now, aren't they?

166
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:55,660
 There's this big House of Parliament restoration going on, which is costing billions,

167
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:58,700
 and they're about to start working on that as well, the Elizabeth Tower.

168
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:03,020
 So anyone overseas who wants to see it, and it's pure unscatholded form,

169
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:06,300
 you better get over quick, because beginning of January 2017,

170
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,580
 they're going to start scaffolding it.

171
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:09,500
 Yeah, and it's going to be scaffolded for three years,

172
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,780
 but it's going to take six months to just put the scaffolding up.

173
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:15,180
 - Is that nice? Yeah, six months.

174
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,340
 - What, and they're going to push it back the right way?

175
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,860
 - No, I think they're doing basic restoration.

176
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,300
 I don't think they can do anything about that.

177
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:24,700
 - I don't know, but it's causing cracks in the offices next to it,

178
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,460
 because it's basically pulling the wall away.

179
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,700
 So they're going to fill those up for a start.

180
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:32,460
 - The Big Ben Tower has a prison in it that they keep naughty MPs in.

181
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,300
 - Does it?

182
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,140
 - Yes, it does.

183
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:37,900
 - They have a prison room, if an MP breaches codes of conduct,

184
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,100
 they'll get put in there.

185
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,940
 And the last time it was used in 1880,

186
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:44,860
 was when Charles Bradlaw and atheist refused to swear allegiance

187
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,620
 to Queen Victoria on the Bible.

188
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:47,180
 - Wow.

189
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,020
 - And he was kept in the prison room overnight.

190
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:49,820
 - And no MP.

191
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:50,540
 - And no MP.

192
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:53,020
 - Every hour, every quarter of an hour, it rings.

193
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:53,980
 - You're right. You're right.

194
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,340
 - You're not going to get my sleep, are you?

195
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,180
 - I'll be tortured, that's like a torture.

196
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:59,980
 It's like how they play Barney, Guantanamo, yes.

197
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,820
 - That'll be why MPs behave so well.

198
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:04,540
 These days, it's terrified of the noise.

199
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:07,820
 It used to make a different sound, didn't it?

200
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:10,940
 When it was originally built, it chimed differently.

201
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,780
 So it was built in May 1859.

202
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:13,820
 - Did it go bonk?

203
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:17,100
 - No, so it was made and the thing that crashes into the bell

204
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:20,060
 to make the bonking sounds worked for a few weeks

205
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:21,740
 and then immediately broke the bell.

206
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,180
 And the crack in the bell is still there

207
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,020
 from where it broke it.

208
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,500
 And so they had to realign it, didn't they?

209
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,740
 Which, for some reason, took them three or four years.

210
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:30,860
 And then they made it bang the bell on a different point of it.

211
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:33,420
 So we'll never hear the tone that Big Ben originally made.

212
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,380
 - Did you know that the Big Ben Chimes have words?

213
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,420
 They have lyrics.

214
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,420
 - No, they mean words.

215
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:38,260
 - Yeah, they do.

216
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:39,420
 It's...

217
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,140
 - It's half past two.

218
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:43,020
 It's quarter two, nine.

219
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:46,940
 - It's all through this hour, Lord be my guide

220
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:49,860
 and by thy power, no foot shall slide.

221
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,300
 - Hang on, but it doesn't say that

222
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,060
 I've never heard those words broadcasting

223
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,940
 and often performed, no, here that's true.

224
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,700
 - Here's another one, play up Pompey.

225
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,300
 The partsmith fans sing, play up Pompey.

226
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,780
 Pompey, play up.

227
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,620
 Like that.

228
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,460
 - Oh really?

229
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,300
 - Same tune.

230
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,140
 Just, play up has him play better.

231
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:04,980
 Sorry.

232
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:05,820
 - Oh, Pompey.

233
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,580
 - Oh, Pompey is a nickname for partsmith FC.

234
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,420
 - Got it.

235
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,300
 - Did you know that you can hear Big Ben Chimes

236
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,740
 before it chimes?

237
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,860
 - Oh, is that those future predicting people?

238
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:14,700
 - No, it's not.

239
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,540
 - No, it's not.

240
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,380
 - No, it's not.

241
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,660
 - Because that's an easy prediction.

242
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:20,860
 I feel like it's gonna chime in about five seconds.

243
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:24,780
 It's not, no, so the BBC, for anyone who doesn't know,

244
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:29,220
 the BBC broadcast the Bongs Live at six o'clock every day.

245
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,580
 So they have a speaker installed inside the tower

246
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:34,780
 and that has direct link to the BBC broadcasting center.

247
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:38,420
 So if you have an FM radio

248
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,380
 and you go and stand even really close to Big Ben,

249
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:41,900
 so like on Westminster Bridge, for example,

250
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,540
 and you listen to the FM radio,

251
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,620
 the FM radio signals are so much faster

252
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:46,940
 than the sound waves in the air,

253
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:49,980
 that the sound of the Bongs will go into the microphone

254
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,380
 all the way to the BBC

255
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:53,540
 and be broadcast always your radio faster

256
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:55,300
 than it just coming through the air at you.

257
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,100
 So if you were standing on Westminster Bridge

258
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,700
 and you listened to an FM radio and Big Ben Chimes,

259
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,540
 you would hear it on the radio a split second

260
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,580
 before you would actually hear it in your other ear.

261
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:04,420
 - That's really cool.

262
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,260
 - It's really cool.

263
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,100
 - Yeah.

264
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:06,940
 Well done, the radio.

265
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:09,300
 Doesn't get enough appreciation today for you tonight.

266
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,460
 - This is so impressive.

267
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,420
 - Do you know on Wikipedia,

268
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:15,780
 there's a big long list of leaning towers.

269
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:17,700
 So you can just see every leaning tower in the world.

270
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,540
 - That's good.

271
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,540
 - There's a nice one in Australia.

272
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,540
 This is called the leaning tower of Jingen.

273
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,740
 It's purposefully built to be leaning

274
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:26,300
 and it's built at the gravity discovery center

275
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,020
 and they wanted to make it so that when you went

276
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,500
 to the gravity discovery center

277
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,420
 that you could replicate by climbing the top Galileo's

278
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:34,540
 experiments on the leaning tower pizza.

279
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,940
 Yeah, so you could actually go up

280
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:38,340
 and you drop stuff down a sheet.

281
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:41,340
 - So the idea with Galileo is that he supposedly,

282
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,660
 although we don't think this happens,

283
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:45,700
 dropped two balls from the leaning tower of pizza

284
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,860
 and there were different weights,

285
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,180
 but they landed at the same time

286
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,980
 and that was proof that things will fall at the same rate

287
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:53,060
 not dependence on the mass.

288
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:56,980
 - You know buildings in Amsterdam tilt deliberately as well.

289
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,620
 And do you know where that is?

290
00:14:58,620 --> 00:14:59,460
 - No.

291
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,180
 - So these are buildings in Amsterdam that face the canal.

292
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,620
 They're many hundreds of years old

293
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,140
 and the reason they're built at a slight tilt

294
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:06,340
 is that they're tilting towards the canal

295
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:08,100
 and that's so that they could winch goods up

296
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,220
 from the canal to the upper windows.

297
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:12,860
 And it's also so that if houses flooded,

298
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:13,980
 which they often did,

299
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,340
 then the first couple of floors might get full of water

300
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,380
 and you need to evacuate your goods really quickly.

301
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:21,060
 And faster than carrying them all upstairs

302
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:24,020
 was if you just got them onto a platform outside the window

303
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:26,140
 and winch those goods up to a higher level.

304
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:26,980
 And the only way you can do that

305
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,660
 without breaking the windows on the way up

306
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,740
 and having it crashed into the wall

307
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:31,580
 is to have the building lean

308
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:33,220
 so that you can pull the goods up directly.

309
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,260
 - Yeah, 'cause if you go to Amsterdam,

310
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,580
 you see that a lot of the houses have got winches

311
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:37,940
 on the front of them, haven't they?

312
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:40,100
 At the very top, they got a little winch.

313
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,140
 And the reason was, I think this is right,

314
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:45,220
 I might be wrong, but I think they came up with their law

315
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,140
 that the amount of tax you paid was dependent

316
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:50,420
 on the front of your house, how wide that was.

317
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,660
 And so people wanted really, really thin houses

318
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,180
 so they paid less tax.

319
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,820
 And so they would be thin and long

320
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,340
 and they would be tall as well.

321
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:00,100
 So that was fine, but then they needed to get,

322
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,260
 if you need to get a sofa up to the top floor,

323
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,260
 that's gonna be really tough

324
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:06,580
 because you're gonna have a really thin staircase going up there.

325
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,660
 And so the way they did it was to winch it all up.

326
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,060
 And if you look now in Amsterdam,

327
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,900
 they have all these winches at the top of the houses.

328
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,140
 - This is so cool.

329
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:16,380
 I feel like our facts have just married each other.

330
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,700
 And married.

331
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,700
 They also actually in Amsterdam,

332
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,300
 they had to have a law preventing houses

333
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,500
 from being too tilted in the end

334
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,900
 'cause everyone was going, you know, 45 degree angles.

335
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:27,260
 - Actually, it's a really thin house,

336
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:29,420
 but it's tilted 90 degrees there.

337
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,140
 (laughing)

338
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:34,300
 There's a tilted structure in Yucatrinburg in Russia.

339
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,980
 It's a massive TV tower.

340
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:39,780
 And it is the tallest abandoned structure in the world.

341
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,300
 - Oh really? - And they started building it.

342
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,380
 They got it really, really high.

343
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:44,140
 And then the Soviet Union fell.

344
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,140
 And then they were like, okay,

345
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:46,500
 we're not gonna do this anymore.

346
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,500
 And it's still there.

347
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,980
 - I'm intentionally leaning.

348
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:49,820
 - Yeah, I'm unintentional.

349
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,020
 It's very slightly leaning.

350
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,620
 - And did the Soviet Union fall

351
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,540
 because it itself was on?

352
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:55,380
 (laughing)

353
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,100
 - It was leaning too far to the left.

354
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:57,940
 Yeah.

355
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,980
 (laughing)

356
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:03,500
 My friend, who you all know, Marina is from Yucatrinburg.

357
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,540
 And this is right near her house.

358
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:07,060
 And she says that everyone from there absolutely hates it.

359
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,900
 And really wants it to get pulled down as soon as possible.

360
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:10,740
 - Right.

361
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,660
 And Nudge sounds like it.

362
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,500
 - Yeah, I'm safe.

363
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,180
 - One of the buildings that is on the list

364
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:17,380
 of the list of leaning towers on Wikipedia

365
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:18,940
 is this one that is a current story.

366
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:21,540
 It's a news story with the San Francisco Millennium Tower.

367
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,740
 So they're still trying to deal with it.

368
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,580
 It keeps leaning further and further

369
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:26,260
 'cause it's sinking into the ground.

370
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,260
 And it was found out.

371
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,060
 It was about six years ago they started noticing it.

372
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,940
 It was a lady called Pamela Buttery,

373
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,300
 who was up in her room.

374
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,900
 And she was on the 57th floor

375
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,540
 and she was trying to play golf in her room.

376
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:37,860
 - Every time she put the ball down,

377
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:40,100
 it just dribbled away from her

378
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,420
 towards the end of the room.

379
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,460
 And she had to go and collect.

380
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,140
 And she's like, "Why, what's wrong with my floor?"

381
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,940
 - It's a bit annoying for Pamela Buttery

382
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,940
 'cause presumably if she's got tilting floors,

383
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,060
 she's gonna be slipping all over them all this time.

384
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,060
 - Yeah.

385
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,420
 - Sure.

386
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,900
 But yes, she falls over, she falls over,

387
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,420
 she'll fall face down as well.

388
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,660
 (laughing)

389
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,260
 (upbeat music)

390
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:04,740
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three.

391
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:07,540
 And that is Chazinski.

392
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:10,060
 - My fact this week is that when Asperin Tablet

393
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:13,220
 was first introduced, people were unsure how to take them.

394
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:16,100
 So one patient ended up strapping them to his head

395
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,100
 to cure a headache.

396
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,620
 (laughing)

397
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:19,860
 - Did it work?

398
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,380
 - We actually have no reports on that.

399
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,340
 So I read this in an article in the Independent

400
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:26,300
 from 2005 by a journalist called David Randall,

401
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,980
 who, and I'd love to know more on it.

402
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:30,700
 So David, if you're listening, please get in touch.

403
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,820
 But this was a drug called Aspero

404
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,620
 and this was devised in 1915

405
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,700
 and it was called Aspero because the Asperin name

406
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,620
 was taken by Bayer.

407
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,900
 But it was the same as Asperin.

408
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:45,580
 - So Asperin is, it's like saying Jekuzi or Hoover.

409
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:46,420
 They are.

410
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:49,940
 - Technically, yeah, but didn't Bayer lose the copyright

411
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:52,100
 to lose the trademark to it because they literally let

412
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,140
 anyone use it and they never sued anyone.

413
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,980
 - I think they lost it in the Treaty of Versailles.

414
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,540
 - Yeah, really weird.

415
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,380
 - Yes.

416
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,860
 - Well, actually the interesting thing about Germans

417
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:03,380
 and Asperin is that its invention is put down

418
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,900
 to a guy called Felix Hoffman.

419
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,860
 And if you look at Bayer's official history of Asperin,

420
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,340
 it still says that he invented it.

421
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,580
 And actually, it's pretty much widely accepted now

422
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:15,020
 since about 1999 that it was, in fact, created and tested

423
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,980
 by a guy called Arthur Aikengrun.

424
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:19,660
 And I'm probably pronouncing that wrong.

425
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:23,260
 And he tested it in 1899 and he wrote a paper in 1949

426
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:25,460
 saying that he just told Hoffman what to do.

427
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,140
 Hoffman didn't even know what he was doing.

428
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,820
 But Aikengrum was Jewish.

429
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:32,500
 And so he wasn't ever included in the official narrative

430
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,860
 and Hoffman was this Aryan kind of guy.

431
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,140
 And it didn't come out until just over 10 years ago.

432
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,940
 And still, if you look it up, Hoffman

433
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:41,180
 is the person who's mainly credited as inventing it.

434
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,100
 - I thought it was Hoffman.

435
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:42,940
 - Yeah.

436
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:45,420
 - I was just thinking by strapping your aspirin to your head,

437
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,580
 it might work still as a placebo.

438
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:48,940
 - Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

439
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,340
 I bet the person did feel better.

440
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,180
 - Yeah.

441
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:53,140
 - Did it individual tablets or just a whole box?

442
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:53,980
 - Doesn't matter.

443
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,700
 If you believed it was going to work,

444
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,380
 you could strap an empty box to your head

445
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,820
 that it would still work a little bit.

446
00:19:58,820 --> 00:19:59,660
 - Yeah.

447
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,420
 - For me to believe it, I need the aspirin

448
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:02,620
 to be touching my skin.

449
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,260
 I think I'd have to take it out of the packaging.

450
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,100
 - Okay.

451
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,660
 - Yeah, it's a placebo pharmacy as you just stare

452
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:09,740
 at the product behind the counter

453
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,500
 and just visualize them going into you.

454
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,340
 - That'd be great.

455
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,620
 I've got a magic pharmacy.

456
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,540
 All these things work from a distance.

457
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:17,260
 You don't only have to take any of them.

458
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,820
 You get the placebo effect.

459
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:21,660
 And my business goes immediately out of business

460
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,260
 'cause I don't sell anything to be asked.

461
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,420
 - You can charge them to look.

462
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:27,060
 And you can charge them more to look at branded aspirin

463
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,820
 than you charge them to look at unbranded.

464
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:32,060
 And that's true because branded aspirin does better,

465
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,940
 doesn't it, than non-branded aspirin?

466
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:37,300
 Because people believe that it's somehow more potent

467
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,900
 because it's got a brand attached to it.

468
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:41,580
 - It is insane that literally the same thing in Tesco

469
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:44,100
 costs 30p, that also costs three pounds or whatever

470
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,100
 and people so often buy the three pounds.

471
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,940
 And Tesco even colors it so it looks

472
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:48,940
 like the Neurofen packet.

473
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:49,780
 - Oh, the packet.

474
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,060
 - And then it makes its aspirin red

475
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:53,380
 so it looks like branded aspirin packet.

476
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:54,860
 - But it actually does work.

477
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:57,740
 So you pay an extra, actually makes it work better.

478
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:00,580
 It was a study by Braithwaite and Cooper in 1981

479
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:01,740
 that showed that that was true.

480
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,340
 - I was thinking it's good that they don't make

481
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:05,420
 the tablets themselves silver because imagine

482
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:06,740
 you're being attacked by werewolf.

483
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,780
 You accidentally mistaken your aspirin tablets

484
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:11,340
 with your silver bullets that you're using to kill it.

485
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:12,580
 And then you end up just curing.

486
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:13,580
 - That's the problem, isn't it?

487
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:16,380
 But instead they've made them look like children's sweets.

488
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,980
 - I can't seem to risk with that.

489
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,180
 (laughing)

490
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:21,380
 - It's not nearly as dangerous as the werewolf situation.

491
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,220
 I think we cannot agree.

492
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:25,540
 - Hey, I was reading in the new QI book, The Factbook.

493
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:27,660
 There's a fact in there that I've been thinking about

494
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:30,380
 for weeks, which I just think it's so odd.

495
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:32,020
 - I can't believe that it's true.

496
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:36,260
 95% of people on earth have at least one thing wrong with them.

497
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:38,580
 So that's quite amazing, but flip that round.

498
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:41,100
 That means there are 5% of people on this planet

499
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,380
 with absolutely nothing wrong with them.

500
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,900
 How is that possible?

501
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:45,900
 - Yeah, I don't think it can be.

502
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,260
 - That is impossible, right?

503
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:49,020
 5% of people are like, how are you?

504
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:49,900
 Absolutely fine.

505
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:50,740
 It's impossible.

506
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:51,580
 - Yeah.

507
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:54,020
 - But maybe they're just people who are extremely stoic.

508
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:56,820
 And so when they asked them in the survey,

509
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,220
 they said, you know, what's wrong with you?

510
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,740
 They're like, fine, I'm fine.

511
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:00,580
 (laughing)

512
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,380
 They're just, they're organs hanging out.

513
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,220
 (laughing)

514
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,620
 Collapse can't move.

515
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:05,620
 Fine, I'm fine.

516
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:07,700
 (laughing)

517
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,940
 But yeah, anyway, so sorry, just to round up.

518
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:12,380
 Apparently it was the first thing that was,

519
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:14,820
 it was the first matter that was sold on mass in tablet form.

520
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,300
 And so it wasn't widely accepted.

521
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,020
 Even though I think people have been swallowing things

522
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:20,100
 for hundreds of years, it wasn't widely accepted.

523
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,340
 This would be the way to swallow it.

524
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,220
 And like I say, I couldn't find any more information

525
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,980
 on this poor man who strapped one to his head.

526
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:27,620
 So if anyone knows, here is descended from him.

527
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,660
 - He died of a headache immediately afterwards.

528
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:31,940
 - And so was never heard of again.

529
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:35,140
 - Aspirin is called a wonder drug by a lot of people

530
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:36,700
 because it's been very recently discovered

531
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,260
 that it does all these other incredible things.

532
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,860
 So a lot of people over a certain age

533
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:42,940
 or with blood clotting issues are told to take an aspirin a day

534
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,980
 because it stops platelets from clotting.

535
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,780
 And a third of them.

536
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,100
 - That sounds like a really crap version

537
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,660
 of an apple a day keeps the top far away.

538
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,500
 (laughing)

539
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:54,660
 - And aspirin a day keeps the platelets from clotting.

540
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:55,660
 Yay.

541
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:57,820
 (laughing)

542
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:59,020
 - That was the trick.

543
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:01,300
 But a third of all people who are at risk

544
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,740
 from cardiac arrest or cardiac incident

545
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,220
 will not have that cardiac incident

546
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,500
 if they take an aspirin every day.

547
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,660
 Isn't that amazing?

548
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,940
 - Apparently if your car is broken down.

549
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:11,660
 - It can't fix a car down.

550
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:13,500
 - You just strap it to the top of the car.

551
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,220
 (laughing)

552
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:18,740
 - Apparently if you've got any jump leads on you

553
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:20,380
 and no one is passing by to help you

554
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:22,820
 and you happen to have some aspirin on you,

555
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:26,460
 if you put the aspirin two tablets into the battery itself,

556
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:30,180
 the basically the sulfuric acid within the battery

557
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:31,580
 will mix with the aspirin.

558
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:33,740
 And who kickstarted it back into life?

559
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:36,020
 I read this in a reader's digest article.

560
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,620
 I haven't tested it.

561
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,060
 I can't get further than it could.

562
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,940
 - The fact that dosage is the same for cars and humans.

563
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:44,140
 - Take two tissues to it before Alice will keep your car running.

564
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:44,980
 (laughing)

565
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:47,140
 - Just say drop two, your aspirin tablets.

566
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:50,820
 - Another thing it helps to get running is a collider.

567
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,980
 Like not the large hadron collider

568
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:55,140
 but there is another collider in Illinois.

569
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:57,300
 They're all like little switches they put aspirins on.

570
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,100
 And the idea is if there was a leak,

571
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:02,340
 the water would drop down, it would dissolve the aspirin

572
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,420
 and then the switches would be able to switch back

573
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:06,100
 and it would turn off automatically.

574
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,740
 - I was just kind of like there's all like resistors

575
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,340
 or trip switches, something when the metal

576
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:11,540
 is supposed to basically it destroys the connection

577
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:14,060
 if the currents - Yeah it's like a fuse box kind of thing.

578
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,260
 - Wow.

579
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:17,140
 We're getting near the end of the year

580
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:19,620
 and obviously New Year's Eve in America,

581
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:22,420
 there's huge traditions of dropping things

582
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:25,540
 in Manhattan, sorry in New York Times Square,

583
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:28,620
 it's what they dropped the ball.

584
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:33,540
 There's a place in America called Myers Town in Pennsylvania

585
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:35,940
 where you can see a giant aspirin tablet dropped.

586
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:36,780
 - Yeah, yeah.

587
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,100
 - And that brings us into the New Year

588
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:41,980
 and the reason is is because the Bayer health care plant

589
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,300
 is there and so it's such a big part of the town

590
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,380
 and probably employees so many people who live there.

591
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:49,740
 So yeah, they just drop a giant into a giant glass of water

592
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,380
 or a giant mouth.

593
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,220
 - Yeah.

594
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:54,180
 - Is it real aspirin?

595
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:56,460
 Like if I went and chip some off, would that sell mine?

596
00:24:56,460 --> 00:25:00,020
 - No, that would be so cool though, but no, it's fake.

597
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:02,100
 It's really weird, there's a list you can go on

598
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,260
 of things that are dropped at New Year in America

599
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:06,020
 and Pennsylvania has so many.

600
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:08,820
 So in certain places you can see a beaver dropped,

601
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,940
 a canal boat dropped, Indy car dropped.

602
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:13,620
 It's like a theme that each town has on their own.

603
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:14,460
 - Wow.

604
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,460
 - Yeah, but one is the aspirin.

605
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,900
 - Probeaver.

606
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:19,380
 - It's a stuffed beaver, it's not a real beaver.

607
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:22,500
 - Yeah, but still poor ol beaver who got killed and stuff.

608
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,220
 - Oh yeah, yeah, that's true.

609
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:26,900
 And that's in beaver town in Pennsylvania.

610
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,300
 - I don't think that's a coincidence.

611
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,380
 (laughing)

612
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:32,980
 (upbeat music)

613
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:37,060
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show

614
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:40,020
 and that is my fact, my fact this week is that

615
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:42,860
 the first British plans to put a human on the moon

616
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:45,820
 was made by Oliver Cromwell's brother-in-law.

617
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:46,820
 - This is so cool.

618
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:49,580
 - This is back in the 1600s.

619
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:51,460
 - Yeah, he wouldn't have really had the means to do so,

620
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:52,300
 I don't think.

621
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,140
 - No, he didn't at all.

622
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:55,100
 I mean, I think you're right, yeah.

623
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,140
 (laughing)

624
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:58,060
 - This is Dr. John Wilkins.

625
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:01,100
 This is not in any way a nutcase of who just,

626
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,860
 we happened to have found documents of some crazy machine

627
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:04,700
 that was built.

628
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:07,860
 This is a really respected clergyman philosopher, author,

629
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,820
 helped found the Royal Society.

630
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:11,820
 It was a really big deal back in the day.

631
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,100
 - It's quite a famous polymath, I think.

632
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,740
 - Yeah, he was, yeah, and he was a big champion

633
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:20,740
 of the latest ideas about space and one of the young.

634
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:22,820
 - What were the latest ideas about space

635
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:23,980
 in the 17th century?

636
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:27,620
 - Well, I guess Galileo had telescopes trained at the moon

637
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:30,300
 and he wrote two books about the moon

638
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,780
 and his thoughts about what actually was going on.

639
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:34,140
 He thought it was a solid object

640
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:36,020
 and he got a lot wrong, but you always do

641
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,940
 in those, when there's limited science

642
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:39,060
 and you're trying to break ground.

643
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:40,780
 - Although to be clear, the moon is a solid object.

644
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:42,460
 That was one of the things he did not get wrong, right?

645
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:43,300
 - What?

646
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,060
 (laughing)

647
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,780
 - So how did he try and get to the moon?

648
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:51,260
 - Okay, so his idea was that you could build a space chariot

649
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:53,620
 and he was using obviously the technology of his time

650
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:57,340
 and his theory was that as soon as you got 20 miles

651
00:26:57,340 --> 00:27:01,220
 up into the air, magnetism of earth and gravity

652
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,380
 loses itself, so that's why you can stay up there.

653
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,940
 The reason he thought that is because

654
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:06,700
 why do clouds stay in the air?

655
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,660
 And he thought as high as they were,

656
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,460
 that's where you no longer suffered

657
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:12,340
 to the pull of earth's magnetism.

658
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,260
 - I mean, that's pretty good logic

659
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:15,100
 considering the information you had available.

660
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,980
 - Yeah, so he thought if you could just get up to that point

661
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:19,940
 then you'd be able to float off into space

662
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:22,540
 and go to the moon and you would adjust to the air,

663
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:23,820
 then you'd breathe the air of angels.

664
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:26,420
 This is where the kind of religious side comes in,

665
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:29,220
 but it made sense that that's how angels breathed.

666
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,060
 They just got used to it.

667
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:32,180
 And then you go to the moon and you would trade

668
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:34,660
 for spices and so on with the people who lived on the moon.

669
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:36,260
 You thought there were people that might live on the moon

670
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:37,260
 and we could trade with them.

671
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:38,820
 - And sorry, this very easy problem

672
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,820
 of getting the initial 20 miles up into the air,

673
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,060
 how was he surmounting that?

674
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,660
 - Well, okay, so-- - Flying chariot.

675
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:47,660
 - Yeah, so the flying chariot, so it was meant to use

676
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:49,660
 clockwork gears, it was gunpowder.

677
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:51,380
 The idea was that it was going to be propelled

678
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:53,060
 using gunpowder and springs.

679
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:56,780
 - And springs, yeah, the Akmi space chariot.

680
00:27:56,780 --> 00:28:00,340
 - But he was a very rational sensible person

681
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:03,100
 in this age that was actually kind of a perfectly

682
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,220
 reasonable thing to think.

683
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:07,500
 And his greatest interest was making a unifying language

684
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,700
 for the world, wasn't it?

685
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:11,180
 - So he did lots of work on creating

686
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:13,020
 like what we have now at Esperanto,

687
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:14,500
 which obviously we all speak.

688
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:17,300
 - He also designed a decimal system

689
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:20,180
 which the metric system was then based on and built off.

690
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:21,220
 So, you know--

691
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:23,180
 - His language was quite interesting.

692
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:26,780
 Every time you added a new letter to a word,

693
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,180
 it would change the meaning,

694
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:31,020
 but your meaning would be related to the previous word.

695
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:35,180
 So the word D-E-D would be an element,

696
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:37,080
 but then when you put a B on the end,

697
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,460
 Deb, that would mean fire.

698
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:42,020
 And then Deb would mean a flame.

699
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:44,660
 So each one was related to the previous.

700
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:49,340
 And the whole idea of it was you would be able to see a word

701
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:52,460
 and knowing the basic building blocks of how his language works,

702
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:55,300
 you could work out pretty much what it kind of meant.

703
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:58,180
 So if it began with D, you would know it was in this part

704
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:59,860
 of, you know, semantics.

705
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:02,180
 And if it began with X, you would know this or with J,

706
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:03,180
 you would know that.

707
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,020
 - That's clever.

708
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:04,860
 - So to a much smaller extent,

709
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:05,860
 you can do that with English,

710
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:07,420
 and that you know if something is, you know,

711
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:10,300
 it's got a diminutive on the front, or a kind of, like, something,

712
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:11,500
 it has been suffixes.

713
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,580
 But the core word is usually you can completely round them,

714
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:14,740
 or come from a really random source,

715
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:16,740
 so you can't deduce it right from the beginning.

716
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:20,420
 - Sure, so I suppose if you hear a word that has Hydro

717
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:21,260
 at the start of it, you know,

718
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,900
 it's going to be something to do with water.

719
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:26,620
 - Didn't he also say that eating wouldn't be necessary

720
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:29,420
 when we got to space because there's no gravity

721
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:30,900
 and the reason we have to eat on Earth

722
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:33,420
 is that the gravity pulls your food through your body

723
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:34,500
 and makes it fall out.

724
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,260
 So you have to keep eating more.

725
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:38,740
 - It's so wonderful, but he was genuinely, I mean,

726
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,940
 I have to say, when I saw this fact,

727
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:42,140
 I thought this time- - Wait a minute.

728
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:44,780
 So there are some animals whose mouth and anus

729
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:46,220
 are on about the same level,

730
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:48,180
 like a dog, for instance, or a cat.

731
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:49,020
 - Yeah.

732
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,980
 - Maybe he tried to train animals not to sit down

733
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:52,220
 because as soon as they sit down,

734
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:53,940
 that suddenly grab a seed out of it.

735
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:56,100
 - Right, dogs don't poo when they're standing up to them.

736
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,740
 They kind of move the bum down.

737
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:58,740
 - Oh my gosh. - It's clever.

738
00:29:58,740 --> 00:29:59,580
 - Of course they do.

739
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:00,420
 It all makes sense.

740
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,260
 - Maybe he was right.

741
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,580
 (laughing)

742
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:05,100
 - But he didn't like all of this theoretical stuff.

743
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,620
 He did, he worked out the distance to the moon

744
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:10,460
 to a degree of accuracy of 99.9%

745
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:11,620
 using just trigonometry.

746
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:12,460
 - That is incredible.

747
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:13,620
 - He's so impressive.

748
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:16,180
 - And I'm quite surprised that of the, you know,

749
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:18,220
 the British space program,

750
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:20,780
 that there's not a big statue of this guy outside.

751
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:23,060
 - Well, we don't really have that much of a space problem.

752
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:23,900
 - No, we have one.

753
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,660
 - We have one that goes all the way back to the 17th century.

754
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:27,100
 - And it kind of ended there.

755
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,260
 (laughing)

756
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,100
 - That's true.

757
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,100
 - We've done pretty much nothing of it.

758
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,100
 We have one, we have the,

759
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,340
 the Prospero satellite.

760
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:34,140
 We've got one British maze satellite

761
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,820
 that was launched to the British made rocket.

762
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:36,980
 Everything else is basically being

763
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:37,980
 we've given something.

764
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:40,420
 - Everything else is basically chariots.

765
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:42,780
 (laughing)

766
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:45,360
 (upbeat music)

767
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,340
 - Okay, that's it.

768
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,340
 That's all of our facts.

769
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:50,860
 Thank you so much for listening.

770
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:52,940

778
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,620
 - @AlexBell_.

779

781
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,780
 - Yep, you can go to our group podcast account,

782
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:10,300
 which is @kypodcast or you can go to our website.

783
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,900
 No such thing as a fish.com.

784
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:14,220
 We've got all of our previous episodes up there.

785
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:15,980
 And you can also go to our other website,

786
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:17,620
 which is no such thing as the news.com.

787
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:20,300
 That has all of our previous TV show episodes,

788
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,380
 which is just finished.

789
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,220
 It's not out anymore.

790
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:24,540
 And if you're missing it, that's where all the episodes are.

791
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:27,380
 Okay, we will be back again next week with another show.

792
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:28,220
 We'll see you then.

793
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,060
 Goodbye.
