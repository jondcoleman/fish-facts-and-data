00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:19,440
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

3
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,780
 to you from one very disclosed location.

4
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:25,040
 It is the QI offices in Covent Garden.

5
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,280
 We are back.

6
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,280
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

7
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:32,520
 I am sitting here at a very comfortable two meter distance from Anna Tyshinski, Andrew

8
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,560
 Huntamurray and James Harkin and once again we have gathered around the microphones with

9
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:42,640
 our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go.

10
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,320
 Starting with fact number one and that is James.

11
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:50,720
 Okay, my fact this week is that there is a type of glue that was developed specifically

12
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:57,560
 to help strong men grab onto giant stone spheres.

13
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,560
 So cool.

14
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,520
 So strong men competitions, this is where you see them basically lift these giant boulders

15
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,800
 don't you up onto platforms.

16
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:09,080
 So if you imagine on British television between Christmas and New Year there is nothing else

17
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:13,720
 on TV apart from World's Strongest Man which is the best show ever where they get these

18
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:18,640
 enormous men like pulling trucks and doing all sorts of stuff but like you say one of

19
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,800
 the things is called the Atlas Stones and there is a substance called Spide Attack that

20
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:29,120
 was invented by a part-time strong man and part-time molecular biologist called Mike

21
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,120
 Caruso.

22
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:37,200
 He smashed all the test tubes in the lab, didn't he?

23
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,240
 And yeah basically he was carrying these big boulders and one of the big problems is actually

24
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,160
 gripping them as someone who has lifted a giant boulder myself.

25
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:51,240
 I could definitely say that, I think I mentioned it on this before that in Iceland I was lifting

26
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,520
 some giant boulders, might come to that later.

27
00:01:54,520 --> 00:02:00,320
 But anyway so he was struggling to grip them so he took some rosin which is that stuff

28
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,280
 that if you play the violin and for instance you pot on your bow to make it, I'm just helping

29
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,280
 you here.

30
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,920
 I feel comfortable.

31
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:11,440
 And then he added some polymers to the rosin and he can't disclose what kind of polymers

32
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:17,440
 are in it, he calls it a special sauce and he came up with this incredibly sticky stuff.

33
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,400
 Now he sold about ten of these a year so it wasn't really a big deal but it's come up

34
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:28,040
 really recently because it's basically spoiled baseball because baseball pitchers who throw

35
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:32,280
 the ball have discovered it and if they put it on their hands it makes the hands able

36
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:37,160
 to spin the ball a hell of a lot which makes the ball impossible to hit and so it's come

37
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,240
 into the news recently that this stuff exists.

38
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:44,440
 Yeah so it is a big controversy at the moment in baseball because batting averages are at

39
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:48,560
 the lowest they've ever been and they think it's because specifically of this kind of

40
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,800
 glue and other glues that are being brought in but it's just a whole new era of baseball

41
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,560
 where everyone's striking out and yeah.

42
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:01,160
 Yeah the Yankees have got a picture called Gerrit Cole and they signed him on a nine

43
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:05,880
 year deal for three hundred and twenty four million dollars in 2019.

44
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:09,640
 He was the best pitcher ever, they had to pay all this money for him.

45
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,840
 They signed him for three hundred and twenty four million dollars.

46
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,560
 Yeah, over nine years.

47
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,800
 Wow, over nine years, it's only about forty million dollars a year, come on Anna.

48
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,800
 Cheapskate.

49
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,080
 Sorry, I'm so sorry.

50
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:28,000
 But they asked him if he used Spide Attack and he was really really evasive in this interview,

51
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 it's amazing.

52
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,600
 He's like oh I don't know how to answer that question.

53
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,840
 The question was do you use Spide Attack and he said I don't know how to answer that

54
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:39,800
 question and there's a suggestion that his form has gone really badly down in the last

55
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:44,080
 couple of weeks because they've now banned this Spide Attack and all the commentators,

56
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,400
 I'm not saying it's true, but all the commentators are saying that it's because they've stopped

57
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,480
 him from using it, he's suddenly turned into a terrible pitcher.

58
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,480
 Interesting.

59
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:57,240
 What's amazing though is that the inventor, this Hulk Bruce Banner guy, half chemist,

60
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:03,280
 half big monster, he doesn't quite know how they're using it in baseball because it's

61
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,640
 too sticky a substance.

62
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,640
 He doesn't like baseball.

63
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,640
 Right.

64
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,320
 Yeah, there's an amazing interview with theathletic.com by Steven Jay Nesbitt, the journalist.

65
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:16,000
 And he found this guy and he asked him what do you think of this and he goes oh I had

66
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,440
 no idea it was popular in baseball, I don't watch baseball, in fact I don't watch any

67
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,680
 sports, I'm too busy to watch sports.

68
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,880
 So he didn't realise that he's spoiled this sport.

69
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,880
 That's very interesting.

70
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,640
 Is it cheating to use glue when you're trying to lift up a stone sphere?

71
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,640
 Interesting.

72
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,640
 Good question.

73
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:35,560
 I think no because I think the whole purpose is the weight of it.

74
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:39,320
 I think obviously you could lose grip but I think we're trying to look at who can hold

75
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:43,560
 things that are really heavy as opposed to who's got good grip on an object.

76
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,400
 Well, I would say part of holding things, a crucial part is grip.

77
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,520
 You're right.

78
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,720
 It's often, a lot of these stones are in Scotland, aren't they, it's rainy a lot there so that

79
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,080
 must make it a lot harder to lift this stone.

80
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,080
 Does rain make it harder?

81
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,600
 I figured that would give you more grip.

82
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:05,080
 It's because if you put your hands on wet surfaces, don't our hands go a bit?

83
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,680
 That's actually why cars can stop so easily in rainy conditions.

84
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:13,640
 No, but what I'm saying is our hands adapt to, they go wrinkly, it gives you hand-hold

85
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,640
 grips, natural hand-holds.

86
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,640
 That's a good point.

87
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,120
 I'm not sure it's proven that the reason our hands go wrinkly is for grip.

88
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,720
 I know that's one of the dominant theories.

89
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:24,240
 Imagine if there was one really strong man, he was the strongest in the world but he's

90
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,560
 a real butterfingers and so he lost every single tournament for that reason.

91
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:35,280
 He's got no fingerprints and he can't lift everything but he can't commit crimes.

92
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,480
 So someone else wins a trophy and he steals it off them.

93
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,480
 Exactly.

94
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,480
 Serious.

95
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:45,280
 They're also called manhood stones, aren't they, sometimes, and there seems to be a very

96
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,760
 important one in Iceland which may indeed be the one that you've lifted.

97
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,720
 You lifted the Husafell stone.

98
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,720
 Yes.

99
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,720
 Oh, no, I haven't.

100
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,720
 No, the Husafell stone, no.

101
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,720
 Oh, that's the biggie.

102
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,080
 You just lifted Daniel's stone in Iceland.

103
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:01,120
 So the Husafell stone is just one stone that you carry from one place to another.

104
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,480
 It's in someone's garden or something, I think, right?

105
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:07,520
 I think it's been used as a strongman's stone for over a century and before that it was

106
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,640
 used as a gate to a goat pen in Iceland.

107
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,200
 Wow, what a promotion.

108
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,200
 That's huge.

109
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:18,440
 Well, maybe you prefered being the goat checker, but that's the big one that people go and

110
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,280
 lift if they want to.

111
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,280
 Right.

112
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:28,720
 There are also four more in a place called djupallonsadur, where there are four different

113
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,720
 size stones.

114
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,240
 I have mentioned this before.

115
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:37,120
 Whichever one you can carry would depend on where you would work on the boat and the people

116
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,120
 who lifted the heavier one would be in the more difficult rowing place, but they would

117
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,840
 get more of the catch, so they get more fish when they, when it came in.

118
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,480
 So where are you in the boat?

119
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,520
 Well, I'm not very strong.

120
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:55,280
 There's one called useless, which is 23 kilograms, which is relatively easy to lift.

121
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,560
 And then there's one called weakling, which is 54 kilograms, which I could lift, but I

122
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,920
 found extremely difficult.

123
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,720
 And it was the grip genuinely, like you could kind of get it on your knees and lift it up

124
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,120
 quite easily, but just getting your hands around it.

125
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,640
 And then the other two, half strength, which is 100 kilos of full strength, which is 154

126
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,640
 kilos, barely could move them.

127
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,960
 Like the big one literally couldn't move it.

128
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,360
 I mean, that's really heavy.

129
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,940
 Is there anything for like, is there a stone which would give you a administrative role

130
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,440
 on the docks?

131
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,440
 Not being on the boat at all.

132
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,440
 Just a little pebble.

133
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,160
 Yeah, exchange for some sardines every day.

134
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:32,060
 The thing is, when I did it, it was really raining and I always use that as an excuse

135
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:35,360
 that, oh, it was really slippy and stuff, but now you mentioned that my hands would have

136
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,360
 gone wrinkly.

137
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,360
 That's no excuse anymore.

138
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,360
 You should have held on longer.

139
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,360
 Yeah.

140
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,440
 If you want to try atlas stones at home, you can buy spider tack online and you can also

141
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,280
 buy atlas stones online.

142
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:53,080
 I found one 75 kilo ball, which was 200 pounds, 50 pounds shipping, because presumably you

143
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,320
 need a strong mountain.

144
00:07:55,320 --> 00:08:01,880
 Do you know what one of the hardest things about being a strongman is?

145
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:05,720
 Well, the lifting of things, you think the lifting, that's pretty bad.

146
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:11,360
 But according to Lloyd Reynolds, who is a strongman and an NHS physio, it's driving

147
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,520
 up and down the British motorways.

148
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,120
 These long drives, basically travel is the biggest problem for strongmen.

149
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,840
 When they get on a plane, their seats, they're like, our butts are too big, we're way too

150
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,600
 bulky, so air attendants tend to sit them if they can in their own row so that the other

151
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,080
 person next to them is not getting squished.

152
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,720
 They try and give them as many breaks to stand up and stretch and move around.

153
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,720
 That's very interesting.

154
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,720
 Did I ever say the thing on here?

155
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,720
 I don't think I did.

156
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:40,080
 I read an interview with some discus throwers and they're really big guys, especially around

157
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,320
 the shoulders.

158
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:46,400
 Whenever the American Olympic team goes to the Olympics, the discus throwers always sit

159
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:50,120
 next to the long distance runners because the long distance runners are so skinny.

160
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:55,000
 Presumably, they must be sat on the side of the dominant throwing arm, right?

161
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,840
 Because that's a bulky arm.

162
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,600
 Maybe that's why they are always pulling planes and cars.

163
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,000
 They just can't fit in them.

164
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,480
 They've got to get it up there, picking someone up.

165
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:11,080
 There was a World Strongest Man competition which was in Botswana in 2016 and all 30 competitors

166
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:14,520
 had to get on the same plane from Johannesburg to Botswana.

167
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:19,280
 And apparently, there was one of the competitors, Brian Shaw, has won World Strongest Man four

168
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,280
 times.

169
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,280
 Pretty big guy.

170
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,280
 He's six foot eight.

171
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,800
 He weighs 31 stone.

172
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,660
 And when he was on the plane, he couldn't fit into the loo and he had to take aim from

173
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,660
 outside.

174
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:29,660
 That's amazing.

175
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:30,660
 What was it?

176
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:31,660
 The water in the middle?

177
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:43,100
 The big old manhood stone coming out of the plane.

178
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:47,560
 Do you know who is the World Strongest Woman at the moment as of 2020?

179
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,560
 No.

180
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,560
 It is.

181
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,580
 Someone we mentioned on the podcast.

182
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,580
 Is it the Watermelon Olsen?

183
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:53,580
 Yeah.

184
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,580
 Courtney Olsen.

185
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:59,740
 It is Olga Leashchuk, who was a former holder of the Watermelon Crushing Record before

186
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,740
 Courtney came along.

187
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:01,740
 Courtney, wow.

188
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:02,740
 Yeah.

189
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:06,060
 I saw a really good interview with her because they asked her about her diet and she says

190
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,740
 she prefers newborn babies.

191
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,740
 It's a joke.

192
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:10,740
 It's a joke.

193
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,740
 Of course.

194
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:15,860
 And there's a brilliant video of her carrying a 200 kilogram yoke.

195
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:21,780
 So a yoke is like what a milkmaid would hold like a stick across the shoulders with two

196
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,540
 heavy weights on it.

197
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:27,740
 And she's walking supposedly with this yoke, but she's going so fast.

198
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:30,820
 The judge who's not carrying anything can't keep up with her.

199
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:31,820
 Wow.

200
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:32,820
 She's amazing.

201
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:33,820
 Honestly.

202
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:34,820
 Incredible.

203
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:35,820
 Wow.

204
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:38,320
 The other thing they carry is fridges famously.

205
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:44,020
 And so it's a classic strongman test, 1977, First World Strongest Man Contest.

206
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,940
 Have you guys ever seen the video of that?

207
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:46,940
 No.

208
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:50,180
 So it was the first one ever and it wasn't really a thing being a strongman and so no

209
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,540
 one really knew how to train for it.

210
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:55,900
 Everyone came from a real range of backgrounds, usually like some kind of sport, but Franco

211
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:59,960
 Colombo was the one of the competitors in 1977, World Strongest Man.

212
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:04,340
 And he was famous at the time for blowing up hot water bottles until they exploded.

213
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:07,100
 Other feats of strength like that.

214
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,580
 Worst house guest ever.

215
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:12,020
 That's pretty, I mean, that's a different kind of strength.

216
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,020
 Yeah.

217
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,020
 It's good, isn't it?

218
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:16,740
 He could also bend steel bars, but he, the problem was he was much smaller than the other

219
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:17,740
 competitors.

220
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:21,820
 He weighed about a hundred pounds less than most of the other competitors and they hadn't

221
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:26,060
 safety tested the fridge race and you should look it up if you can hack it.

222
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:30,740
 They start with fridges on their backs and they start running and within about two strides

223
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:31,740
 his leg snuck.

224
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:32,740
 Oh no.

225
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:36,660
 It's like a tug of war fact all over again.

226
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:37,660
 He's fine.

227
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:38,660
 He's fine.

228
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:39,660
 There's an interview with him in hospital later.

229
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:44,140
 He's like that was a bit of a bitch and they cancelled the fridge race until 2004 and now

230
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:48,380
 they have a crossbar and a fridge on each side to bounce the way, but it is an unbelievable

231
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,380
 thing to watch.

232
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:55,380
 And presumably he had immediate access to a bag of cold peas to put on the fridge.

233
00:11:55,380 --> 00:12:04,900
 Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is Anna.

234
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:12,740
 My fact this week is that the first animated puppet film used insect corpses as the puppets.

235
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:15,900
 It's pretty creepy, but very cool.

236
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:22,300
 This was a sort of one of the founders of animated film, Władysz Raw Starowicz.

237
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:27,060
 He was an, started out as an entomologist, Polish entomologist and moved into animation.

238
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:31,020
 This was at the turn of the 20th century and so he loved insects.

239
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:36,740
 So at one point he was director of the Museum of Natural History in Lithuania and in 1909

240
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:40,900
 he decided he wanted to make a film that just showcased how cool the stag beetle was, his

241
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,140
 favorite insects.

242
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:46,580
 And he wanted to show two male stag beetles fighting over a mate, but when he tried it

243
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:51,780
 they died under the sort of glare of the film lights and their legs sort of melted off whatever.

244
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,980
 So he thought okay this isn't going to work.

245
00:12:53,980 --> 00:13:00,500
 So he removed their legs and he exchanged the legs for tiny little wires attached to their

246
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:05,100
 thoraxes, they are not alive at this point, attached to their thoraxes and then he filmed

247
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,820
 frame by frame them fighting and moving like stop motion.

248
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:11,540
 So he was also, some Russians say for instance, because he was born in Russia, Russian sort

249
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:16,100
 of claim him as the father of stop motion or there are some rivals for that.

250
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:19,900
 But yeah, he would move the insects leg a millimeter and then show it again and a millimeter

251
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:20,900
 and show it again.

252
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,900
 They're all online and they are phenomenal.

253
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,400
 Oh they're captivating aren't they?

254
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:29,420
 Yeah, I mean his whole catalog of work is online that you can see but yeah, these insects,

255
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:33,140
 these beetles at the time, people who watch them, I read this in one place, I haven't been

256
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:38,180
 able to find the actual reviews that say this is true but they, it was so convincing what

257
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:39,180
 he did.

258
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,540
 People thought it was basically amazing insect training.

259
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:46,460
 I found one of those reviews, it said in 1911 the trainer must be a man of magical endurance

260
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:47,960
 and patience.

261
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:51,580
 So yeah, and he didn't give away the secrets of how he did it either, he wanted to keep

262
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,580
 them as deep.

263
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:56,620
 So he also hinted that there were gears and pulleys at work and that he, I mean he was

264
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,100
 really, he was definitely keeping a secret.

265
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:02,420
 Yeah, it was definitely advertised, at least in Britain for some reason it was advertised

266
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:03,940
 as trained insect puppets.

267
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:09,220
 Interesting, it would draw more attention than dead things I've strapped, why aren't

268
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,220
 it?

269
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:13,540
 Interesting that the Russians claim him as their own because his whole family hated

270
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,420
 Russia.

271
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:21,780
 Because he was born around Moscow but he was taken to Kaunas in Lithuania, modern day Lithuania

272
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:25,460
 because his father didn't want him to be too Russian.

273
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:30,780
 And so he stayed with his grandfather in Kaunas and he was expelled from school for skipping

274
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:34,940
 the Orthodox Mass which was like a Russian church so he didn't really want to be part

275
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:37,980
 of that because his father had kind of taught him to be like this.

276
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:43,900
 And he invented a shooting range in his house which had moving figures and one of the figures

277
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:49,760
 was General Muravyov who was like the famous Russian general who kind of put down the November

278
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:56,020
 uprising and whenever you shot him he would kind of fall down and then be hanged by his

279
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,180
 neck.

280
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:02,380
 Wow! And his grandparents forced him to take it down because they knew that if the local

281
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:05,540
 police saw it then they would probably take him away and stuff.

282
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:10,700
 Yeah it's not going to, it's hard to spin that, it's an ode to your great work.

283
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:14,820
 Yeah that's as a child that's like, so you can see where he got all the kind of moving

284
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,220
 parts of his insects.

285
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:18,140
 Yeah, yeah, that's awesome.

286
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:22,620
 And he was Polish as well, he seemed to have claimed lots of different nations but his

287
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:26,540
 parents were Polish, hence the Poland and Russia had an old relationship back then.

288
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:30,860
 And he changed his name at some point didn't he as well, was that in connection to that?

289
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:35,900
 That was when he moved to France because obviously it's a bit of a, I'm glad Anna pronounced

290
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:40,620
 his name at the start, which is not so hard but how do you pronounce his first name?

291
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:43,460
 Fortunately it's my grandad's name so I know it's Frodishrov.

292
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:47,380
 I think that's probably incorrect, I'm sure a Polish citizen can write an incorrect

293
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,380
 name.

294
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,940
 It's right because it's got that L with a line through it which is like pronounced

295
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:53,420
 like a W a little bit isn't it, I think, or something.

296
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,420
 Frodishrov.

297
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:57,860
 He moved to France and he changed his name to make it a bit easier for people to pronounce

298
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:01,220
 I think, to Ladislas Starovic.

299
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:04,820
 I'm sure you guys read loads of the descriptions of the movies, I really like the Cameraman's

300
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:05,820
 Revenge.

301
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:06,820
 Did you see this one?

302
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:07,820
 This is so good.

303
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:10,300
 So Mr and Mrs Beetle, married couple, they're bored.

304
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:14,420
 They became less realistic over time, didn't they?

305
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:20,340
 So Mr Beetle meets a dragonfly who is in the middle of an affair with Mr Grasshopper, right?

306
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,700
 But Mr Beetle is so sexy.

307
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:24,820
 He steals away Mrs Dragonfly from Mr Grasshopper.

308
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:29,980
 Grasshopper, the cuck in this scenario, is furious but he's also a cameraman, okay?

309
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:34,100
 And he films Mr Beetle's affair with his ex, Mrs Dragonfly, right?

310
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:39,540
 Anyway, Mr Beetle and Mrs Beetle, they're eventually reconciled with each other and they, you know,

311
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,220
 they get back together and they say let's go to the movies.

312
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:47,060
 But the projectionist at the cinema is Mr Grasshopper and he puts on a movie called The

313
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:50,940
 Unfaithful Husband which is footage of Mr Beetle having it off with Mrs Dragonfly.

314
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:55,420
 I have some questions about this, about Beetle's and Dragonfly's having sex with each other.

315
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:57,940
 That's unrealistic, Charlie.

316
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:01,420
 It's kind of fan fiction, like.

317
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:07,060
 That's a lot of plot for what were, I thought, like 30-second movies back in the day.

318
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,060
 How long is this?

319
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:12,060
 This was his, this was his magnum opus, this was his citizen cane, yeah, I don't know.

320
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,060
 But anyway.

321
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,540
 I think it was a bit longer.

322
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:15,740
 A few minutes, yeah.

323
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,500
 It's about 13 minutes I can see now.

324
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,500
 Oh, okay.

325
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:22,660
 His magnum opus came a bit later, wasn't it, was The Tale of the Fox, which was the first

326
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:26,060
 feature animation film, so it's over an hour long.

327
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:27,060
 Oh, wow.

328
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:31,860
 And that's, what I find interesting about that is it's based on a Goethe story called

329
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:38,060
 Reinecker-Fuchs, which is based on a much, much older kind of medieval story called Reynard

330
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,060
 the Fox.

331
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:43,980
 And Reynard the Fox is basically, it's a fox and a wolf and the fox is very sly and

332
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:48,140
 amoral but he's very charismatic and he always gets into trouble and you have all these medieval

333
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:53,900
 stories about this fox doing naughty things but eventually a bit like Dennis the Menace

334
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,660
 kind of getting his way in the end.

335
00:17:56,660 --> 00:18:00,340
 And these tales have been going since the 12th century.

336
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,740
 And in English they're called Reynard the Fox.

337
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:09,300
 In French they're called Reynard the Fox and Reynard is now French for Fox.

338
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:12,820
 And so the French word for fox comes from this character from the medieval history.

339
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:13,820
 Oh, wow.

340
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:14,820
 Isn't that interesting?

341
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:15,820
 Yeah.

342
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:16,820
 Fox the Fox.

343
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:17,820
 That's awesome.

344
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:21,460
 And that one he, so he got adept at making other animals, didn't he?

345
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:23,020
 Not just insects.

346
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:26,260
 And in fact, everywhere seemed to say he worked completely alone, which he did.

347
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:29,940
 He didn't like outside influence and he turned down Hollywood because he wanted to do it

348
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:30,940
 all himself.

349
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:35,380
 But he didn't like outside of his family assistance but his wife was a tailor I think

350
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:39,380
 and his wife made a lot of the animals for him and his daughter directed and wrote a

351
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:40,940
 lot of his films with him.

352
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:46,180
 But in the Reynard the Fox he made like, I think he made some lots of animals out of

353
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,180
 different animals.

354
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,180
 It seems really weird.

355
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:53,740
 Like the lion was made of deer skin I think and just really mixing it up.

356
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:54,740
 Wow.

357
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:55,740
 But it's very adult content.

358
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,980
 Animation was not for kids back then.

359
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,460
 It's kind of dark.

360
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:03,660
 Again, that one, look that up online, the animation is phenomenal in that.

361
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:04,900
 It's absolutely extraordinary.

362
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,940
 And as you're saying James, it was the first animation.

363
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:12,480
 So it beats Snow White, which is seen as the seminal opening animated movie of Hollywood.

364
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,340
 Beat it by eight months in coming out.

365
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:18,660
 So this guy was a true pioneer who's sort of been lost to the annals of history slightly.

366
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:23,140
 Do you want to hear the least relevant fact that I found in the research for this section?

367
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:29,020
 It's about art and insects and drawings and filming.

368
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:32,660
 So this is a sports writer fact and in fact it's a newsy one.

369
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:37,420
 There is a team of two men whose job is to go along the length of the route of the Tour

370
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:44,220
 de France and their job is to draw butterflies out of penises that people have graffiti

371
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,220
 on the road.

372
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:53,260
 They're called the Eraser Men, Les Fassers and this is a great article about them on

373
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,860
 the Ruler website.

374
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,900
 Basically you're filming from above, aren't you, the Tour de France and people go along

375
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:01,020
 the route every year writing insane graffiti.

376
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:04,700
 They draw a lot of syringes because they're implying that you know the cyclists are all

377
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,700
 saying.

378
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:09,900
 There's loads of messages like Ale, Alaphilippe or whoever like whoever's they put messages

379
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,300
 for their favourite riders but I've never seen a penis.

380
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:16,940
 Well that's because Les Fassers are doing their job and every 100 metres or so on the

381
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:20,180
 route apparently there's a penis and they have to transform it or they make it unrecognisable

382
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,420
 if they can't do a decent butterfly.

383
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,500
 Are the testicles the two big eyeballs?

384
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:31,380
 I would think that the wings might be relevant there but their versatile is what I'm saying

385
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:35,420
 and they change the syringes into ladders and you know they just...

386
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:38,340
 They're very pointy bit on the top of that ladders, isn't that?

387
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:41,860
 Turn that into the Empire State Building instead.

388
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:47,820
 You've got thousands of miles of road to go and you're saying do the Empire State Building.

389
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,820
 You've got 40,000 windows on it.

390
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:50,820
 Oh my god.

391
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:53,460
 Who's paying them to do this?

392
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:59,560
 I think it's either the broadcaster or the organisers of the Tour de France.

393
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,980
 I know they use hundreds of litres of paint.

394
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:02,980
 It's tough.

395
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:03,980
 It's tough work.

396
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:07,660
 It's not as tough as actually cycling in the Tour de France is it but sure.

397
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:08,660
 I don't know.

398
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:09,660
 It must be stressful.

399
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:10,660
 They're ahead of the Tour de France.

400
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:11,660
 Come on.

401
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:12,660
 Come on.

402
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:15,660
 I just need to do the proboscis on this butterfly.

403
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:19,180
 They're catching up.

404
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:26,780
 This movie The Tale of the Fox which was by Starevich we said was one of the early animations.

405
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:29,380
 It was the first feature animation puppet film.

406
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:32,700
 There were a few older feature animation films.

407
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:37,980
 The oldest that we have which is still extant is called The Adventures of Prince Ahmed and

408
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:45,540
 it's by the German animator Lotta Reiniger and she used a system a bit like Shadow Puppets.

409
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:49,380
 I don't know if you guys have seen, in fact I know you have seen Harry Potter and the

410
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,980
 Deathly Hallows part one.

411
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:53,380
 I didn't know we've seen it.

412
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,180
 Well I'm just looking at you.

413
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:58,100
 I've known you for long enough but you've definitely seen that.

414
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,780
 We're all wearing our sorting hats.

415
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:05,300
 There's a bit where they tell a little short film inside the film called The Tale of the

416
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,300
 Three Brothers.

417
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,300
 It's that kind of style.

418
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:10,700
 And yeah this woman called Lotta Reiniger.

419
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:15,340
 She made this animation technique and she made loads and loads of movies and the first

420
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:17,900
 one she made was in 1926.

421
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:23,820
 What I like about her is that she later married her creative partner called Karl Koch but she

422
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:28,660
 kept her name Lotta Reiniger so that she wasn't called a "Mottercock".

423
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:41,780
 I'm not sure that was the reason she did that but it's got to be.

424
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:44,820
 Okay it is time for fact number three and that is my fact.

425
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:49,780
 My fact this week is that the man who popularized toothpicks in American restaurants did so

426
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:54,660
 by paying Harvard men to eat at fine establishments and then shout at the waiters if they were

427
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:57,900
 told wooden toothpicks were not available.

428
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:04,820
 So yeah it's a sort of cheeky promotional tool to get your product bought.

429
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:11,780
 This was a guy called Charles Forster and he was a guy who had seen when he was overseas

430
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:16,260
 in Brazil toothpicks being used by many people in South America.

431
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:18,780
 He thought this is something that should be done here.

432
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:24,620
 So he went back home and he managed to design the modern day toothpick, the really cheap

433
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:27,420
 little wooden stick that we find in most places.

434
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:29,900
 That is Charles Forster's invention.

435
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:34,140
 And once he had the invention he thought how can I convince Americans that they need

436
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:38,420
 this in their mouths because it was seen as sort of a bit crude, no one was really interested

437
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,420
 in it.

438
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:43,500
 So he used to pay people, particularly sort of very rich people like Harvard men to go

439
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:48,620
 in, cause a ruckus and then they would threaten to never eat in the establishment again and

440
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:53,340
 once they left the next day Charles Forster would either himself or send someone else

441
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:57,740
 there going would you like to buy a box of wooden toothpicks and the owner goes of course

442
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:58,740
 yes thank you.

443
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:04,500
 Why didn't the owner ever go hmm, how suspicious, I wonder if Harvard guys randomly kicked

444
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:08,020
 up a huge fuss yesterday about this, I mean you'd see it coming.

445
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:12,180
 Well he would sometimes go in first as well so let's say there was a shopkeeper, he would

446
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:15,900
 go into a shop and he would say to the shopkeeper look would you like to buy some of these new,

447
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:18,780
 I'm selling them toothpicks you could buy a few boxes of them and the shopkeeper would

448
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:23,060
 say I'm not interested and then he would hire a young person to go into the shop, ask for

449
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:26,940
 some toothpicks, not be able to get any cause the shopkeeper had said no, then he would

450
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:30,020
 go back, the shopkeeper would say alright I will have some toothpicks, then the young

451
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:34,900
 people would go back in, buy the toothpicks, return them to Charles Forster who then has

452
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:38,220
 the toothpicks back again that he sold to the shopkeeper in the first place.

453
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:40,020
 But then he reused the toothpicks.

454
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:45,180
 Yeah he would resell them then to the shop which to me means he's making a loss.

455
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:46,180
 Yeah absolutely.

456
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:50,260
 If there's a markup in the shop he's losing that amount of money but I can only assume

457
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:54,300
 he then sells in bulk after that, he's like I would sell you 20 boxes.

458
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:59,020
 I hope so because if not, maybe that's why this guy wasn't the biggest financier ever

459
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:02,700
 but yeah it feels like a risk but I guess it was a risk that it was worth taking.

460
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:06,460
 A lot of gullible shopkeepers and restaurateurs around in those days.

461
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:11,020
 He claimed his toothpicks were made of the choicest part of the white birch log.

462
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:14,620
 Which sounds like he's going one toothpick per mug.

463
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:21,460
 Really? I'm just going to find the exact part of that birch tree but no you make millions

464
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:23,540
 and millions from each one didn't you?

465
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:29,420
 And he did this all in a bit of America called Strong which is in Maine and for a long time

466
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:35,180
 that was the toothpick capital of the world as they called themselves so 95% of all wooden

467
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:38,220
 toothpicks manufactured in America were out of strong.

468
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:43,460
 So we're talking something around the World War II period 75 billion toothpicks per year

469
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,460
 were being sent out.

470
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,460
 That's too many.

471
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,460
 That's too many.

472
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:51,460
 There was a thousand people living in that town at the time so that meant each per year

473
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:54,580
 they were making 75 million toothpicks.

474
00:25:54,580 --> 00:26:01,380
 5 billion? What were they being used for? They mostly went to waste surely.

475
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:05,380
 Given the world's population that would be every person using 25 per year but I'm sure

476
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:07,140
 they weren't as evenly distributed as that.

477
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:10,660
 No and back then much smaller.

478
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:14,820
 I like that we're talking about Strong in Maine, we were talking about Strong in Maine

479
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:15,820
 earlier.

480
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:18,540
 Stronger than Maine.

481
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:23,420
 When the demand declined for toothpicks when people realised we don't need a thousand

482
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:29,620
 each per year they tried to innovate because obviously these factories in Strong suddenly

483
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:34,600
 they didn't know what to do and so they tried to come up with new versions of toothpicks

484
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:38,060
 and one of them was they would make it square in the middle so that when you put it on a

485
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:39,740
 table it wouldn't roll off.

486
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:45,220
 I don't know how clever it is Anna because I think that it's never been a huge problem

487
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:47,740
 for me as you put your toothpick down on the table.

488
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:48,740
 It has for me.

489
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:49,740
 It has for me.

490
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:53,220
 How wonky are your tables that are so the toothpick is rolling off just adjust the angle

491
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:55,580
 that the toothpick is on and that'll solve the problem.

492
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:59,660
 My housemates get really pissed off because I'm a compulsive toothpick user I probably

493
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:04,060
 go through about 10 a day and they are all over the floor because you put them on your

494
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:09,020
 desk yes it's a bit of a wobbly desk it falls onto the sitting room floor get a new one it's

495
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:11,020
 an issue and I can't believe these didn't take off.

496
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:14,820
 I can't believe you were questioning how many toothpicks were needed per day.

497
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:15,820
 I know.

498
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:16,820
 The pot twist.

499
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:17,820
 I'm the main consumer.

500
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:18,820
 10 a day.

501
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:22,500
 Apparently he wasn't even very good at making stuff for stay I think he was just a good

502
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:28,540
 businessman wasn't he like he requisitioned shoe peg makers to make toothpicks and apparently

503
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:33,540
 they used the same skills but see that seems so weird to me because a shoe peg was something

504
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:38,300
 that attached the like heel of a shoe the base of a shoe to the top of a shoe and so it's

505
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:42,220
 got to be quite thick to do that right that's like when you've got to attach two bits together

506
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:47,340
 in DIY it's got to be like a dowel like your thumb exactly and then they turn that into

507
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:51,620
 a toothpick that seems if you're using a toothpick to hold your shoe together your shoe's coming

508
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:52,620
 off.

509
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:55,020
 But it's an easier I guess it's an easier technology to adjust it's probably one of

510
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:58,740
 the closest things to an actual toothpick that existed or could be made at the time.

511
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:02,620
 You wouldn't take someone who made telegraph poles right and they get them to make two

512
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:07,220
 picks because that's a bigger change isn't it? And they were often missing teeth back

513
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:10,940
 then so maybe the gaps were a lot bigger.

514
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:16,780
 I was reading a book which was called The Toothpick by a guy called Henry Petroski did you guys

515
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:22,300
 come across this it's one of those great authors who just picks one item yeah and he just tells

516
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:26,420
 the whole history of the object so obviously Charles Worcester invented the sort of very

517
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:30,540
 cheap disposable toothpicks but toothpicks have been there throughout history Royals

518
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:35,340
 have used them but everyone sort of had a really spectacular toothpick that they could

519
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,220
 use over and over again.

520
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:41,220
 They would often wear it in a box around their neck on a chain yeah you would carry your

521
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:46,340
 toothpick that's there's in this book he claims that there is definitely evidence that during

522
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:48,220
 the renaissance that used to be done.

523
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:51,140
 Like people used to carry their knives around this stuff did people just have a load of

524
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:53,500
 cutlery attached to their body all the time.

525
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,620
 Spoon on the nose.

526
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:59,060
 There's an anonymous painting that was done called Queen Elizabeth as an old woman which

527
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:03,100
 shows her wearing multiple chains around her neck and one of them which would have had her

528
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:09,060
 toothpick in and we know that she had toothpicks because in 1570 there's an account of her

529
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:13,820
 having received a gift of six gold toothpicks as well as and this seems to have disappeared

530
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:20,900
 from sort of day use tooth cloths never heard of that a little cloth for your teeth I guess

531
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:26,340
 instead of a brush did you just like hang yeah that's really maybe yes I know you should

532
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:28,940
 get one of these things to hang around your neck and you could just keep one toothpick

533
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:32,300
 in there yeah problem solved I think that's a really good idea because at the moment I

534
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:35,860
 replace the toothpick back into my huge bowl of toothpicks that I keep in every room and

535
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:39,860
 then you don't know which one you last used it's not very hygienic at all are you kidding

536
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:43,940
 no you put it back in the I don't think that's the point of the toothpick holder other people

537
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:48,540
 find that weird but it seems so wasteful to just use it once absolutely there's a toothpick

538
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:52,940
 mystery that I think has been in the back of everyone's mind since the day you first

539
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:57,420
 saw one of these toothpicks okay you know the toothpicks which are called Japanese toothpicks

540
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:02,140
 and they have little grooves at one end oh yeah those are the fancy ones in my mind they're

541
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:07,020
 the fancy ones exactly usually you see them in maybe a nicer restaurant and why do they

542
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:14,260
 have those grooves so they don't roll as easily off the table increase your grip avoid stabbing

543
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:18,260
 yourself in the gum grip very good answer rolling don't know because they're not that

544
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:21,060
 the grooves aren't going that way so I don't know if that would help okay what they're

545
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:26,700
 for is they are for snapping the end off to indicate the toothpick has been used which

546
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:31,140
 would you would not need to do if you were me but a lot of people like to say this has

547
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:35,100
 been done don't use it and also someone pointed out I don't know if this was in mind when

548
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:39,460
 they were designed but you can then use the end you've snapped off as a stand so another

549
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:43,900
 problem I always have with toothpicks is that the end is lying on a table or a chair or

550
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:52,340
 sofa and that gets dirty right whereas if you prop it up with its other end that you've

551
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:58,580
 snapped off isn't that so clever yeah it's really clever yeah people think that you shouldn't

552
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:03,180
 use toothpicks though right a lot of dentists say you shouldn't really use them what because

553
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:07,780
 they can pierce your gums and give bacteria a chance to get in because they're quite spiky

554
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:13,420
 especially the wooden ones so you're using them wrong well the American Dental Association

555
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:18,900
 suggests not to use them they say you should use them there are certain better like softer

556
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:24,460
 toothpicks that you can use rather than those wooden ones writer Sherwood Anderson died because

557
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:28,640
 he swallowed a toothpick okay that is using it wrong there's one thing to just poke it

558
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:33,420
 into your gum but to eat the entire thing well in fairness to him it was from a martini

559
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:39,140
 so okay so the olive presumably he was going for that he must have really been thirsty

560
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:42,220
 he must have been rushing to the bar can't wait to get that first drink I'm just going

561
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:48,300
 to drink the whole thing and there was a study in the New England Journal of Medicine about

562
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:53,780
 someone who swallowed a toothpick and nearly died it had been hidden in a sandwich by which

563
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:57,060
 I don't think someone had actually hidden it I think maybe it was holding the sandwich

564
00:31:57,060 --> 00:32:01,140
 together and I haven't noticed it but the problem is because it was made of wood all

565
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:06,820
 of these scans you couldn't see it and even when they gave them a colonoscopy they couldn't

566
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:11,500
 see it because it's so small and even when they did surgery it was really hard to see

567
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:15,260
 because the hole was so so tiny and it was only eventually when they were doing the

568
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:18,980
 surgery they kind of found the toothpick lodged in his artery and they realised that that

569
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:23,500
 was the problem is it a huge this is a test in the artery would that come out if it made

570
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:26,980
 it to his stomach would that have come out in would it have been broken down it's not

571
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:31,260
 guaranteed to so this year there was a report manager Pan he'd swallowed a toothpick and

572
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:34,740
 he had months of pain in his back and leg and it had been stuck in his basically in

573
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:39,020
 his rectum and it's a seven centimetre long toothpick he'd swallowed by mistake but this

574
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:45,700
 so this does happen apparently in the 1980s in America alone 8,000 people a year were

575
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:51,540
 being injured by toothpicks but not swallowing that's not by a lot of swallowing they just

576
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:58,180
 lying good that he for table and it was presumably injuries could be from accidentally poking

577
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:05,140
 your throat too hard or like what are you going in your mouth you might make a mistake

578
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:09,060
 you might miss your mouth it's quite hard even to get to the back molars to be honest

579
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:13,580
 a lot of people use it I mean I think q-tips were invented because the guy who invented

580
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:18,580
 q-tips saw his wife using a toothpick on her son or daughter's ears to pick out so like

581
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:21,220
 you know people do use it for weird things I think in fairness they were putting a bit

582
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:25,740
 of cloth on the end of the toothpick it wasn't just shoving in the spiky okay because I have

583
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:31,740
 done that with a toothpick wow yeah this is not my children on me right really yeah inside

584
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:38,580
 your ear yeah wow I think I've got to say the personal hygiene of all of both of you

585
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:43,980
 thank you James thank you it was more than two meters now don't you but there are lots

586
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:47,380
 of this is this is a huge problem there was a dentist who was interviewed by an outlet

587
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:50,500
 called shore news he was called Jamie Bell he said more people choke on toothpicks than

588
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:55,260
 on food which I find it's true yeah I saw that but I can't be true can it I mean okay

589
00:33:55,260 --> 00:34:00,020
 but there was an analysis of toothpicks swallowing cases which had made it to medical journals

590
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:05,060
 because obviously most toothpick incidents probably don't make it to a medical journal

591
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:10,820
 but of the ones which make it to medical journals 10% a fatal of toothpicks swallowing incidents

592
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:15,220
 which is a lot scary and of though of all of the cases which are made into the journals

593
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:19,580
 half the patients didn't know that they'd swallowed a toothpick so it seems like it's

594
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:25,140
 easier to do so Anna check yourself I think I think it's with what we were saying before

595
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:30,100
 I've been to a few restaurants where to hold a big burger together a toothpick goes in and

596
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:33,580
 it goes in a bit too far and you find yourself hitting on a toothpick as you're biting into

597
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:37,980
 the burger like that's where that's where the yeah they've obviously been fashionable

598
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:43,060
 throughout history in terms of having them sticking out of your mouth very cool it is

599
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:50,260
 cool very cool look was very dangerous yeah you're a bad boy basically is that why cowboys

600
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:56,620
 are doing it is to signify they don't value their own life so 1870s it was extremely cool

601
00:34:56,620 --> 00:35:01,060
 for people to be chewing on toothpicks apparently every third woman in a particular area of

602
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:04,820
 Boston had one sticking out of her mouth at any one time well this was this was Charles

603
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:10,500
 Foster's boom right yes was as a result this was the moment 1870s when it erupted but even

604
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:15,220
 before that people obviously went around doing it was reading a 16th century book of kind

605
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:20,340
 of table manners and advised do not go around with a toothpick in your mouth like a bird

606
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:25,100
 going to build his nest or stick it behind your ear like a barber does his comb which

607
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:30,380
 obviously implies people are people are doing that yeah have you guys heard of Stan Monroe

608
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:35,500
 no Stan Monroe ten years ago his wife had a few operations but while she was having

609
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:39,780
 her operations Stan Monroe needed to take his mind off things and so started to build

610
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:47,120
 stuff out of toothpicks and he has built the most buildings out of toothpicks of anyone

611
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:52,660
 in the world he says the quickest one he had to do was the Washington Monument even though

612
00:35:52,660 --> 00:36:03,020
 it's really big one toothpick it's more than one toothpick the Eiffel Tower is four going

613
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:09,300
 up to the same point they're very very intricate he uses actual blueprints to make them they're

614
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:18,140
 all built one to 164 scale every single one and what's really cool is that he read that

615
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:22,180
 the workers on the Empire State Building when they did the real Empire State Building they

616
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:29,060
 used to carve their wives names into the buildings and so in all of his toothpick buildings he

617
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:38,140
 has his wife's names somewhere in them I guess possibly into a few because otherwise that

618
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:42,900
 would be quite small but yeah well there is this guy called Willard Wigan who we've actually

619
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:49,020
 mentioned once before ages ago who does tiny sculptures and one of the things he does is

620
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:55,260
 he sculpts into individual toothpicks and he'll sculpt famous people so he did back in the

621
00:36:55,260 --> 00:37:00,020
 year 2000 he did the Beckham so David Beckham is one toothpick Victoria Beckham is the other

622
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:05,860
 their kid was the other I mean it's tiny and it took him a week I think Willard Wigan is

623
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:11,420
 he the man behind the impossible micro world in Bath I think yes yes he is exactly they

624
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:17,780
 had a touring exhibition it was the most incredible thing I've ever seen it was so good yes you

625
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:22,140
 do you do he has sorry I didn't see the Beckham's I don't know if they were in that exhibition

626
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:27,660
 but I remember he did a horse a statue of a horse dancing and the statue itself was

627
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:31,860
 balanced on the head of an ant which was in the display case he's unbelievable I wrote

628
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:38,220
 him once but he never wrote back he might have done but his letter was so small just

629
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:51,660
 a tiny toothpick through your letter box okay it's time for our final fact of the show and

630
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:58,380
 that is Andy my fact is that there is a blue plaque in London which has its own blue plaque

631
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:03,380
 pretty cool yeah why does it why well the original plaque plaque one as I'm going to

632
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:08,500
 call it from now on is to Isaac Newton and it was his home when he was the president

633
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:13,860
 of the Royal Society it's in German Street which is quite near Piccadilly in London and

634
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:19,060
 the building was rebuilt and it was finished in 1915 and the plaque was reattached but

635
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:24,700
 it then had a supplementary plaque attached saying this plaque was you know reattached

636
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:31,060
 it's not round the bonus plaque plaque to is rectangular okay no and I should say I got

637
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:36,580
 this from someone I know Will Noble who had seen it in the works of Marc Mason who we

638
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:43,140
 know who's been on fish and has been on fish yeah yeah now my understanding of blue plaques

639
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:47,140
 the English heritage blue plaques is that to earn a blue plaque you need to have made

640
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:52,420
 a significant and positive contribution to society I would be interested to know what

641
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:58,220
 contribution that plaque made to society you know can I get a plan I mean how easy can

642
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:03,300
 it be I think maybe that was before the rules were tightened up so English heritage took

643
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:07,820
 over in about the 1980s they took over from the London County Council and the London County

644
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:11,660
 Council took over from maybe the Royal Society of Arts the first people to do it with the

645
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:14,980
 Royal Society of Arts it's been through about four bodies have had the responsibility of

646
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:20,820
 putting up blue plaques and English heritage are now just in London the ones they do and

647
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:26,220
 they are if you like the original maybe the best they're certainly the most stringent

648
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:30,280
 in their requirements because there are dozens and dozens of facts in it yeah the first thing

649
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:35,820
 you need to do is die yeah and then you need to have been dead for 20 years yeah yeah so

650
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:42,820
 get in there early and then someone has to nominate you but you're only allowed to nominate

651
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:46,940
 one person a year if you're a member of the public yeah so you can't just send loads and

652
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:50,500
 loads of what about this person what about this person what about this person and then

653
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:57,060
 it goes to a panel of 12 people including a few historians like Rosemary Hill and David

654
00:39:57,060 --> 00:40:02,820
 Olusoga and people like that and then they decide and then you have another problem because

655
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:06,700
 you have to find the owner of the building and sometimes they don't reply to your emails

656
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:12,220
 or they don't want you know they don't want they write back but tiny you put up a tiny

657
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:16,820
 plaque the size of a button but yeah some people don't want them on their house do they

658
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:21,180
 is that I mean surely if out of sheer selfishness I guess it would increase the value of the

659
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:25,020
 building well there was an interview with Howard Spencer who's in charge of English

660
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:31,220
 heritage and he said that it does increase the value of your house for sure but not by

661
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:39,340
 enough he said you'd be better off modernizing a bathroom but in the same article I read

662
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:43,740
 there was an interview with Caroline Mittwock who is a researcher who lives on Wimpol Street

663
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:48,460
 which is where Frederick Treves who was a surgeon of the Elephant Man lived and she

664
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:52,260
 says it can be quite annoying because you get tourists kind of stood outside gawping

665
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:56,380
 at the front of your house and when you're trying to come in with your bags of shopping

666
00:40:56,380 --> 00:41:00,980
 you don't want to go around them so yeah it is there are frustrations but also they're

667
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:04,820
 so strict about the rules and there was a complaint a few years ago someone wanted a

668
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:11,460
 plaque to Elizabeth Taylor okay and they had written back saying it's not yet 20 years

669
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:15,660
 since she died and we are not as a result going to consider her and the guy who had made the

670
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:19,540
 suggestion had kind of promised to Elizabeth Taylor that he would try and get her a plaque

671
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:22,660
 and he said it's so annoying they should just weigh the rule because in 20 years all the

672
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:26,860
 fans who would have paid attention will themselves be dead and no one will pay any interest and

673
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:30,740
 I would have thought that's kind of the point of why the 20 year rule exists yeah he's identified

674
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:34,620
 as the reason for the rule and I was just going yes thank you for confirming we've made

675
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:39,340
 the right choice. Although there was one person called Phillip Jones who was a trumpet player

676
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:45,180
 who died in 2000 and people think that he probably will have a blue plaque in the end

677
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:49,180
 but the problem was they had to wait 20 years and that would mean that his wife who's still

678
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:53,940
 living would probably never get to see it so you know you can see in a way that it would

679
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:58,420
 be nicer for some people to get it a bit. Yeah it would be nice but I'm afraid it's not the

680
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:03,260
 point of a blue plaque to make everyone's Tom, Dick and Harry's wives happy it's meant to

681
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:07,060
 be someone who's making a lasting contribution to the world and if everyone's forgotten you

682
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:11,020
 after 20 years then I'm afraid you don't deserve one. Okay well if you want one you can just

683
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:15,500
 buy one yourself. Yeah. It doesn't really matter I mean there's nothing to stop you from just

684
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:19,580
 buying one on your own house. Absolutely I did find a blue plaque that went to someone

685
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:25,940
 who had only died 12 years before receiving it. Who? Is this in the olden days? No this

686
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:32,220
 is in modern days. I say someone it's an animal Dolly the sheep. Oh but it's sheep

687
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:40,760
 years. It's actually 60 years. Did they only make the one plaque for Dolly? Idiots. Yeah

688
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:48,500
 that's in the Society of Biology in Edinburgh at the Roslyn Institute. There can't be many

689
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:55,900
 quadrupeds who have plaques. I think the only other one I could find was the dog who was

690
00:42:55,900 --> 00:43:02,820
 the dog of the HMV painting his master's voice dog. Oh Nipah. Nipah's got a plaque somewhere.

691
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:06,520
 These are all proper. This is an English heritage I think there are probably quite a lot of other

692
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:11,540
 pet plaques. There's a couple of bipeds I know humans are bipeds as well but feathered

693
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:17,020
 bipeds plaques which are pigeons who were like during the world war two kind of gave

694
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:21,540
 messages and stuff from World War One. That's really cool. But not English heritage or English

695
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:26,500
 heritage. Not sure. There's even fictional characters that get given blue plaques. So

696
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:32,020
 I was reading that one person who's real Charles Dickens has so many he's got like 44 plaques

697
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:37,140
 around the UK you know so many places he went to and wrote a book there and so on so scattered

698
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:43,220
 across the UK he has them but even his characters have some plaques so Market Square and Dover

699
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:49,820
 is where David Copperfield apparently rested on a doorstep and ate a loaf and that has a

700
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:54,980
 plaque. I have to say I think that's insane. So there is a guy called Mike. Oh well Mike

701
00:43:54,980 --> 00:44:00,060
 Reed the DJ. Yeah. He is the chairman of the British plaque trust and a few years ago

702
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:04,100
 he made a sizzling intervention in the debate. He said there are way too many plaques and

703
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:08,060
 he quoted that one Dan from David Copperfield saying this is madness. Although there are

704
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:13,180
 plaques where you know there's a hotel where JRR Tolkien stayed for a couple of nights.

705
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:17,300
 Yeah. He had a weekend break. But again like Hannah says these aren't the official English

706
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:21,260
 heritage ones is that right? That's correct. Yeah none of them are. So those Dickens ones

707
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:25,380
 like Dickens does not have 44 English heritage plaques. So basically I don't really count

708
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:30,060
 plaques as plaques unless they're English heritage. Really? They're not blue plaques.

709
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:34,420
 They can be blue but they're not. They're not capital B, capital P. They can't be the

710
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:37,580
 colour blue but that's obviously completely different to them. I mean blue plaques can

711
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:42,660
 be brown can't they? Yes the original blue plaques are brown. Yes. Very confusing. Howard

712
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:47,620
 Spencer said that we have no copyright on the colour of plaques. That's fair. We just

713
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:52,340
 asked people try to make your style of plaque a bit different than ours. Wow. And some people

714
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:55,620
 do but some people really don't. Some people don't. Why would you? No I know. If you're

715
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:58,300
 going to put your own plaque on your front door you're going to make it look as much

716
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:03,060
 like theirs as possible like you. The way to tell by the way if you are a blue plaque

717
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:07,300
 spotter and you really are like Hannah and you think only the English heritage ones are

718
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:12,100
 the true plaques then look for the screws because official blue plaques do not have

719
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:18,040
 screws. They're kind of flush onto the stonework and the fake ones tend to be screwed up. Good

720
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:22,580
 to know. That is a really good tip. Did you guys do about Frank and Sue Ashworth? The

721
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:27,380
 blue plaque team. Oh the makers yeah. The makers of the only plaques. So they've been

722
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:31,020
 doing English heritage as blue plaque since 1984 when they took over from the previous

723
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:36,620
 guy who died but they got the recipe that he'd been using for a specific recipe. How

724
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:42,140
 many years did they have to wait until they were given the recipe? Yeah so it was the

725
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:46,020
 widow of the previous person who gave them the recipe and they're so great. They live

726
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:50,060
 in Cornwall. They're hoping to hand down the business to their son Justin. There's a great

727
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:54,820
 video I think it's on the English heritage site of Sue, the mother and her son Justin

728
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:59,340
 who I guess they've been training up. And it's just a great family bickering session

729
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:03,260
 so they're obviously doing a documentary about plaque making. He's making this plaque

730
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:07,060
 like doing the engravings. She's giving the interview to the camera saying I'm very aware

731
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:10,700
 of how important it is not to interrupt while people are concentrating and I try really

732
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:14,980
 hard not to interrupt Justin and Frank. And then literally Justin starts talking about

733
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:18,820
 what a perfectionist he is and she says the entire time interrupting him saying I'm so

734
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:22,820
 sorry. You're doing it a bit. Oh I just think the lettering is a bit thick. Sorry. Sorry

735
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:25,500
 for interrupting. It is a bit thick there. It's just annoying to have to pare it down

736
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:33,060
 isn't it Justin. It's so sweet. Oh so funny. They're really sweet. They're lovely. Also

737
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:37,460
 the other person who fits into this scheme apart from the Ashworth family is a man called

738
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:41,500
 Trevor Ramsey from Sunderland. Did you find out about him? No. No. He is the man who fits

739
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:47,300
 all the blue plaques and he's done 200 of them in the last 16 years. Cool. Yeah and he is

740
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:51,300
 the one who creates the hole in the wall so it fits perfectly flush. And yeah as James

741
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:56,420
 says it can't be screwed on. There has to be a perfectly sized hole in the wall and he

742
00:46:56,420 --> 00:47:00,580
 hangs the curtains as well. I always wondered who did the curtains. I love the curtains.

743
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:04,780
 I didn't know though. So there's a big reveal moment. Oh yeah. Always. There's always a

744
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:09,580
 reveal. You know those curtains where I now declare this. Yeah yeah yeah. And I just I'd

745
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:13,220
 never knew who made the curtains. No I think not very many people do. I think you're not

746
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:16,540
 going to get laughed out of a pub if you say you know I'm so embarrassed about this but

747
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:23,780
 I don't even know who makes the curtains. Another hack question in tonight's pub quiz.

748
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:27,900
 Everyone gets it. The first ever plaque doesn't exist anymore. The first plaque put up in London

749
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:33,220
 and it was to Lord Byron and the house was demolished. It's now the central London John

750
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:37,820
 Lewis. And we don't even know which house it was because I think there's no clear evidence

751
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:43,260
 as to which house Byron actually lived in. It was very early in his life but it was it

752
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:47,620
 was destroyed in a bomb in the wall and then another one was put up. I wonder if he'd be

753
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:53,100
 happy that it's now selling overpriced crockery. Yeah. Okay. Someone's not tried the everyday

754
00:47:53,100 --> 00:48:09,460
 range. Truly the spirit of Byron lives on. Okay. That's it. That is all of our facts.
