00:00:13,00:00:19,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming"
00:00:19,00:00:22,to you from one very disclosed location.
00:00:22,00:00:25,It is the QI offices in Covent Garden.
00:00:25,00:00:26,We are back.
00:00:26,00:00:27,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:27,00:00:32,"I am sitting here at a very comfortable two meter distance from Anna Tyshinski, Andrew"
00:00:32,00:00:36,Huntamurray and James Harkin and once again we have gathered around the microphones with
00:00:36,00:00:42,our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go.
00:00:42,00:00:45,Starting with fact number one and that is James.
00:00:45,00:00:50,"Okay, my fact this week is that there is a type of glue that was developed specifically"
00:00:50,00:00:57,to help strong men grab onto giant stone spheres.
00:00:57,00:00:58,So cool.
00:00:58,00:01:02,"So strong men competitions, this is where you see them basically lift these giant boulders"
00:01:02,00:01:04,don't you up onto platforms.
00:01:04,00:01:09,So if you imagine on British television between Christmas and New Year there is nothing else
00:01:09,00:01:13,on TV apart from World's Strongest Man which is the best show ever where they get these
00:01:13,00:01:18,enormous men like pulling trucks and doing all sorts of stuff but like you say one of
00:01:18,00:01:23,the things is called the Atlas Stones and there is a substance called Spide Attack that
00:01:23,00:01:29,was invented by a part-time strong man and part-time molecular biologist called Mike
00:01:29,00:01:30,Caruso.
00:01:30,00:01:37,"He smashed all the test tubes in the lab, didn't he?"
00:01:37,00:01:42,And yeah basically he was carrying these big boulders and one of the big problems is actually
00:01:42,00:01:45,gripping them as someone who has lifted a giant boulder myself.
00:01:45,00:01:51,"I could definitely say that, I think I mentioned it on this before that in Iceland I was lifting"
00:01:51,00:01:54,"some giant boulders, might come to that later."
00:01:54,00:02:00,But anyway so he was struggling to grip them so he took some rosin which is that stuff
00:02:00,00:02:04,"that if you play the violin and for instance you pot on your bow to make it, I'm just helping"
00:02:04,00:02:05,you here.
00:02:05,00:02:06,I feel comfortable.
00:02:06,00:02:11,And then he added some polymers to the rosin and he can't disclose what kind of polymers
00:02:11,00:02:17,"are in it, he calls it a special sauce and he came up with this incredibly sticky stuff."
00:02:17,00:02:22,Now he sold about ten of these a year so it wasn't really a big deal but it's come up
00:02:22,00:02:28,really recently because it's basically spoiled baseball because baseball pitchers who throw
00:02:28,00:02:32,the ball have discovered it and if they put it on their hands it makes the hands able
00:02:32,00:02:37,to spin the ball a hell of a lot which makes the ball impossible to hit and so it's come
00:02:37,00:02:39,into the news recently that this stuff exists.
00:02:39,00:02:44,Yeah so it is a big controversy at the moment in baseball because batting averages are at
00:02:44,00:02:48,the lowest they've ever been and they think it's because specifically of this kind of
00:02:48,00:02:52,glue and other glues that are being brought in but it's just a whole new era of baseball
00:02:52,00:02:55,where everyone's striking out and yeah.
00:02:55,00:03:01,Yeah the Yankees have got a picture called Gerrit Cole and they signed him on a nine
00:03:01,00:03:05,year deal for three hundred and twenty four million dollars in 2019.
00:03:05,00:03:09,"He was the best pitcher ever, they had to pay all this money for him."
00:03:09,00:03:12,They signed him for three hundred and twenty four million dollars.
00:03:12,00:03:14,"Yeah, over nine years."
00:03:14,00:03:19,"Wow, over nine years, it's only about forty million dollars a year, come on Anna."
00:03:19,00:03:20,Cheapskate.
00:03:20,00:03:23,"Sorry, I'm so sorry."
00:03:23,00:03:28,"But they asked him if he used Spide Attack and he was really really evasive in this interview,"
00:03:28,00:03:29,it's amazing.
00:03:29,00:03:31,He's like oh I don't know how to answer that question.
00:03:31,00:03:34,The question was do you use Spide Attack and he said I don't know how to answer that
00:03:34,00:03:39,question and there's a suggestion that his form has gone really badly down in the last
00:03:39,00:03:44,"couple of weeks because they've now banned this Spide Attack and all the commentators,"
00:03:44,00:03:47,"I'm not saying it's true, but all the commentators are saying that it's because they've stopped"
00:03:47,00:03:50,"him from using it, he's suddenly turned into a terrible pitcher."
00:03:50,00:03:51,Interesting.
00:03:51,00:03:57,"What's amazing though is that the inventor, this Hulk Bruce Banner guy, half chemist,"
00:03:57,00:04:03,"half big monster, he doesn't quite know how they're using it in baseball because it's"
00:04:03,00:04:04,too sticky a substance.
00:04:04,00:04:05,He doesn't like baseball.
00:04:05,00:04:06,Right.
00:04:06,00:04:11,"Yeah, there's an amazing interview with theathletic.com by Steven Jay Nesbitt, the journalist."
00:04:11,00:04:16,And he found this guy and he asked him what do you think of this and he goes oh I had
00:04:16,00:04:19,"no idea it was popular in baseball, I don't watch baseball, in fact I don't watch any"
00:04:19,00:04:21,"sports, I'm too busy to watch sports."
00:04:21,00:04:23,So he didn't realise that he's spoiled this sport.
00:04:23,00:04:24,That's very interesting.
00:04:24,00:04:29,Is it cheating to use glue when you're trying to lift up a stone sphere?
00:04:29,00:04:30,Interesting.
00:04:30,00:04:31,Good question.
00:04:31,00:04:35,I think no because I think the whole purpose is the weight of it.
00:04:35,00:04:39,I think obviously you could lose grip but I think we're trying to look at who can hold
00:04:39,00:04:43,things that are really heavy as opposed to who's got good grip on an object.
00:04:43,00:04:48,"Well, I would say part of holding things, a crucial part is grip."
00:04:48,00:04:51,You're right.
00:04:51,00:04:55,"It's often, a lot of these stones are in Scotland, aren't they, it's rainy a lot there so that"
00:04:55,00:04:58,must make it a lot harder to lift this stone.
00:04:58,00:04:59,Does rain make it harder?
00:04:59,00:05:00,I figured that would give you more grip.
00:05:00,00:05:05,"It's because if you put your hands on wet surfaces, don't our hands go a bit?"
00:05:05,00:05:08,That's actually why cars can stop so easily in rainy conditions.
00:05:08,00:05:13,"No, but what I'm saying is our hands adapt to, they go wrinkly, it gives you hand-hold"
00:05:13,00:05:14,"grips, natural hand-holds."
00:05:14,00:05:15,That's a good point.
00:05:15,00:05:18,I'm not sure it's proven that the reason our hands go wrinkly is for grip.
00:05:18,00:05:19,I know that's one of the dominant theories.
00:05:19,00:05:24,"Imagine if there was one really strong man, he was the strongest in the world but he's"
00:05:24,00:05:29,a real butterfingers and so he lost every single tournament for that reason.
00:05:29,00:05:35,He's got no fingerprints and he can't lift everything but he can't commit crimes.
00:05:35,00:05:38,So someone else wins a trophy and he steals it off them.
00:05:38,00:05:39,Exactly.
00:05:39,00:05:40,Serious.
00:05:40,00:05:45,"They're also called manhood stones, aren't they, sometimes, and there seems to be a very"
00:05:45,00:05:48,important one in Iceland which may indeed be the one that you've lifted.
00:05:48,00:05:50,You lifted the Husafell stone.
00:05:50,00:05:51,Yes.
00:05:51,00:05:52,"Oh, no, I haven't."
00:05:52,00:05:53,"No, the Husafell stone, no."
00:05:53,00:05:54,"Oh, that's the biggie."
00:05:54,00:05:57,You just lifted Daniel's stone in Iceland.
00:05:57,00:06:01,So the Husafell stone is just one stone that you carry from one place to another.
00:06:01,00:06:03,"It's in someone's garden or something, I think, right?"
00:06:03,00:06:07,I think it's been used as a strongman's stone for over a century and before that it was
00:06:07,00:06:09,used as a gate to a goat pen in Iceland.
00:06:09,00:06:11,"Wow, what a promotion."
00:06:11,00:06:12,That's huge.
00:06:12,00:06:18,"Well, maybe you prefered being the goat checker, but that's the big one that people go and"
00:06:18,00:06:20,lift if they want to.
00:06:20,00:06:21,Right.
00:06:21,00:06:28,"There are also four more in a place called djupallonsadur, where there are four different"
00:06:28,00:06:29,size stones.
00:06:29,00:06:31,I have mentioned this before.
00:06:31,00:06:37,Whichever one you can carry would depend on where you would work on the boat and the people
00:06:37,00:06:41,"who lifted the heavier one would be in the more difficult rowing place, but they would"
00:06:41,00:06:45,"get more of the catch, so they get more fish when they, when it came in."
00:06:45,00:06:47,So where are you in the boat?
00:06:47,00:06:50,"Well, I'm not very strong."
00:06:50,00:06:55,"There's one called useless, which is 23 kilograms, which is relatively easy to lift."
00:06:55,00:06:59,"And then there's one called weakling, which is 54 kilograms, which I could lift, but I"
00:06:59,00:07:00,found extremely difficult.
00:07:00,00:07:04,"And it was the grip genuinely, like you could kind of get it on your knees and lift it up"
00:07:04,00:07:07,"quite easily, but just getting your hands around it."
00:07:07,00:07:11,"And then the other two, half strength, which is 100 kilos of full strength, which is 154"
00:07:11,00:07:13,"kilos, barely could move them."
00:07:13,00:07:15,Like the big one literally couldn't move it.
00:07:15,00:07:17,"I mean, that's really heavy."
00:07:17,00:07:20,"Is there anything for like, is there a stone which would give you a administrative role"
00:07:20,00:07:22,on the docks?
00:07:22,00:07:23,Not being on the boat at all.
00:07:23,00:07:24,Just a little pebble.
00:07:24,00:07:27,"Yeah, exchange for some sardines every day."
00:07:27,00:07:32,"The thing is, when I did it, it was really raining and I always use that as an excuse"
00:07:32,00:07:35,"that, oh, it was really slippy and stuff, but now you mentioned that my hands would have"
00:07:35,00:07:36,gone wrinkly.
00:07:36,00:07:37,That's no excuse anymore.
00:07:37,00:07:38,You should have held on longer.
00:07:38,00:07:39,Yeah.
00:07:39,00:07:43,"If you want to try atlas stones at home, you can buy spider tack online and you can also"
00:07:43,00:07:45,buy atlas stones online.
00:07:45,00:07:53,"I found one 75 kilo ball, which was 200 pounds, 50 pounds shipping, because presumably you"
00:07:53,00:07:55,need a strong mountain.
00:07:55,00:08:01,Do you know what one of the hardest things about being a strongman is?
00:08:01,00:08:05,"Well, the lifting of things, you think the lifting, that's pretty bad."
00:08:05,00:08:11,"But according to Lloyd Reynolds, who is a strongman and an NHS physio, it's driving"
00:08:11,00:08:13,up and down the British motorways.
00:08:13,00:08:17,"These long drives, basically travel is the biggest problem for strongmen."
00:08:17,00:08:21,"When they get on a plane, their seats, they're like, our butts are too big, we're way too"
00:08:21,00:08:26,"bulky, so air attendants tend to sit them if they can in their own row so that the other"
00:08:26,00:08:29,person next to them is not getting squished.
00:08:29,00:08:32,They try and give them as many breaks to stand up and stretch and move around.
00:08:32,00:08:33,That's very interesting.
00:08:33,00:08:34,Did I ever say the thing on here?
00:08:34,00:08:35,I don't think I did.
00:08:35,00:08:40,"I read an interview with some discus throwers and they're really big guys, especially around"
00:08:40,00:08:41,the shoulders.
00:08:41,00:08:46,"Whenever the American Olympic team goes to the Olympics, the discus throwers always sit"
00:08:46,00:08:50,next to the long distance runners because the long distance runners are so skinny.
00:08:50,00:08:55,"Presumably, they must be sat on the side of the dominant throwing arm, right?"
00:08:55,00:08:56,Because that's a bulky arm.
00:08:56,00:08:59,Maybe that's why they are always pulling planes and cars.
00:08:59,00:09:01,They just can't fit in them.
00:09:01,00:09:04,"They've got to get it up there, picking someone up."
00:09:04,00:09:11,There was a World Strongest Man competition which was in Botswana in 2016 and all 30 competitors
00:09:11,00:09:14,had to get on the same plane from Johannesburg to Botswana.
00:09:14,00:09:19,"And apparently, there was one of the competitors, Brian Shaw, has won World Strongest Man four"
00:09:19,00:09:20,times.
00:09:20,00:09:21,Pretty big guy.
00:09:21,00:09:22,He's six foot eight.
00:09:22,00:09:23,He weighs 31 stone.
00:09:23,00:09:27,"And when he was on the plane, he couldn't fit into the loo and he had to take aim from"
00:09:27,00:09:28,outside.
00:09:28,00:09:29,That's amazing.
00:09:29,00:09:30,What was it?
00:09:30,00:09:31,The water in the middle?
00:09:31,00:09:43,The big old manhood stone coming out of the plane.
00:09:43,00:09:47,Do you know who is the World Strongest Woman at the moment as of 2020?
00:09:47,00:09:48,No.
00:09:48,00:09:49,It is.
00:09:49,00:09:50,Someone we mentioned on the podcast.
00:09:50,00:09:52,Is it the Watermelon Olsen?
00:09:52,00:09:53,Yeah.
00:09:53,00:09:54,Courtney Olsen.
00:09:54,00:09:59,"It is Olga Leashchuk, who was a former holder of the Watermelon Crushing Record before"
00:09:59,00:10:00,Courtney came along.
00:10:00,00:10:01,"Courtney, wow."
00:10:01,00:10:02,Yeah.
00:10:02,00:10:06,I saw a really good interview with her because they asked her about her diet and she says
00:10:06,00:10:07,she prefers newborn babies.
00:10:07,00:10:09,It's a joke.
00:10:09,00:10:10,It's a joke.
00:10:10,00:10:11,Of course.
00:10:11,00:10:15,And there's a brilliant video of her carrying a 200 kilogram yoke.
00:10:15,00:10:21,So a yoke is like what a milkmaid would hold like a stick across the shoulders with two
00:10:21,00:10:23,heavy weights on it.
00:10:23,00:10:27,"And she's walking supposedly with this yoke, but she's going so fast."
00:10:27,00:10:30,The judge who's not carrying anything can't keep up with her.
00:10:30,00:10:31,Wow.
00:10:31,00:10:32,She's amazing.
00:10:32,00:10:33,Honestly.
00:10:33,00:10:34,Incredible.
00:10:34,00:10:35,Wow.
00:10:35,00:10:38,The other thing they carry is fridges famously.
00:10:38,00:10:44,"And so it's a classic strongman test, 1977, First World Strongest Man Contest."
00:10:44,00:10:45,Have you guys ever seen the video of that?
00:10:45,00:10:46,No.
00:10:46,00:10:50,So it was the first one ever and it wasn't really a thing being a strongman and so no
00:10:50,00:10:51,one really knew how to train for it.
00:10:51,00:10:55,"Everyone came from a real range of backgrounds, usually like some kind of sport, but Franco"
00:10:55,00:10:59,"Colombo was the one of the competitors in 1977, World Strongest Man."
00:10:59,00:11:04,And he was famous at the time for blowing up hot water bottles until they exploded.
00:11:04,00:11:07,Other feats of strength like that.
00:11:07,00:11:09,Worst house guest ever.
00:11:09,00:11:12,"That's pretty, I mean, that's a different kind of strength."
00:11:12,00:11:13,Yeah.
00:11:13,00:11:14,"It's good, isn't it?"
00:11:14,00:11:16,"He could also bend steel bars, but he, the problem was he was much smaller than the other"
00:11:16,00:11:17,competitors.
00:11:17,00:11:21,He weighed about a hundred pounds less than most of the other competitors and they hadn't
00:11:21,00:11:26,safety tested the fridge race and you should look it up if you can hack it.
00:11:26,00:11:30,They start with fridges on their backs and they start running and within about two strides
00:11:30,00:11:31,his leg snuck.
00:11:31,00:11:32,Oh no.
00:11:32,00:11:36,It's like a tug of war fact all over again.
00:11:36,00:11:37,He's fine.
00:11:37,00:11:38,He's fine.
00:11:38,00:11:39,There's an interview with him in hospital later.
00:11:39,00:11:44,He's like that was a bit of a bitch and they cancelled the fridge race until 2004 and now
00:11:44,00:11:48,"they have a crossbar and a fridge on each side to bounce the way, but it is an unbelievable"
00:11:48,00:11:49,thing to watch.
00:11:49,00:11:55,And presumably he had immediate access to a bag of cold peas to put on the fridge.
00:11:55,00:12:04,"Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is Anna."
00:12:04,00:12:12,My fact this week is that the first animated puppet film used insect corpses as the puppets.
00:12:12,00:12:15,"It's pretty creepy, but very cool."
00:12:15,00:12:22,"This was a sort of one of the founders of animated film, Władysz Raw Starowicz."
00:12:22,00:12:27,"He was an, started out as an entomologist, Polish entomologist and moved into animation."
00:12:27,00:12:31,This was at the turn of the 20th century and so he loved insects.
00:12:31,00:12:36,So at one point he was director of the Museum of Natural History in Lithuania and in 1909
00:12:36,00:12:40,"he decided he wanted to make a film that just showcased how cool the stag beetle was, his"
00:12:40,00:12:42,favorite insects.
00:12:42,00:12:46,"And he wanted to show two male stag beetles fighting over a mate, but when he tried it"
00:12:46,00:12:51,they died under the sort of glare of the film lights and their legs sort of melted off whatever.
00:12:51,00:12:53,So he thought okay this isn't going to work.
00:12:53,00:13:00,So he removed their legs and he exchanged the legs for tiny little wires attached to their
00:13:00,00:13:05,"thoraxes, they are not alive at this point, attached to their thoraxes and then he filmed"
00:13:05,00:13:07,frame by frame them fighting and moving like stop motion.
00:13:07,00:13:11,"So he was also, some Russians say for instance, because he was born in Russia, Russian sort"
00:13:11,00:13:16,of claim him as the father of stop motion or there are some rivals for that.
00:13:16,00:13:19,"But yeah, he would move the insects leg a millimeter and then show it again and a millimeter"
00:13:19,00:13:20,and show it again.
00:13:20,00:13:22,They're all online and they are phenomenal.
00:13:22,00:13:24,Oh they're captivating aren't they?
00:13:24,00:13:29,"Yeah, I mean his whole catalog of work is online that you can see but yeah, these insects,"
00:13:29,00:13:33,"these beetles at the time, people who watch them, I read this in one place, I haven't been"
00:13:33,00:13:38,"able to find the actual reviews that say this is true but they, it was so convincing what"
00:13:38,00:13:39,he did.
00:13:39,00:13:41,People thought it was basically amazing insect training.
00:13:41,00:13:46,"I found one of those reviews, it said in 1911 the trainer must be a man of magical endurance"
00:13:46,00:13:47,and patience.
00:13:47,00:13:51,"So yeah, and he didn't give away the secrets of how he did it either, he wanted to keep"
00:13:51,00:13:52,them as deep.
00:13:52,00:13:56,"So he also hinted that there were gears and pulleys at work and that he, I mean he was"
00:13:56,00:13:58,"really, he was definitely keeping a secret."
00:13:58,00:14:02,"Yeah, it was definitely advertised, at least in Britain for some reason it was advertised"
00:14:02,00:14:03,as trained insect puppets.
00:14:03,00:14:09,"Interesting, it would draw more attention than dead things I've strapped, why aren't"
00:14:09,00:14:10,it?
00:14:10,00:14:13,Interesting that the Russians claim him as their own because his whole family hated
00:14:13,00:14:15,Russia.
00:14:15,00:14:21,"Because he was born around Moscow but he was taken to Kaunas in Lithuania, modern day Lithuania"
00:14:21,00:14:25,because his father didn't want him to be too Russian.
00:14:25,00:14:30,And so he stayed with his grandfather in Kaunas and he was expelled from school for skipping
00:14:30,00:14:34,the Orthodox Mass which was like a Russian church so he didn't really want to be part
00:14:34,00:14:37,of that because his father had kind of taught him to be like this.
00:14:37,00:14:43,And he invented a shooting range in his house which had moving figures and one of the figures
00:14:43,00:14:49,was General Muravyov who was like the famous Russian general who kind of put down the November
00:14:49,00:14:56,uprising and whenever you shot him he would kind of fall down and then be hanged by his
00:14:56,00:14:57,neck.
00:14:57,00:15:02,Wow! And his grandparents forced him to take it down because they knew that if the local
00:15:02,00:15:05,police saw it then they would probably take him away and stuff.
00:15:05,00:15:10,"Yeah it's not going to, it's hard to spin that, it's an ode to your great work."
00:15:10,00:15:14,"Yeah that's as a child that's like, so you can see where he got all the kind of moving"
00:15:14,00:15:16,parts of his insects.
00:15:16,00:15:18,"Yeah, yeah, that's awesome."
00:15:18,00:15:22,"And he was Polish as well, he seemed to have claimed lots of different nations but his"
00:15:22,00:15:26,"parents were Polish, hence the Poland and Russia had an old relationship back then."
00:15:26,00:15:30,"And he changed his name at some point didn't he as well, was that in connection to that?"
00:15:30,00:15:35,"That was when he moved to France because obviously it's a bit of a, I'm glad Anna pronounced"
00:15:35,00:15:40,"his name at the start, which is not so hard but how do you pronounce his first name?"
00:15:40,00:15:43,Fortunately it's my grandad's name so I know it's Frodishrov.
00:15:43,00:15:47,"I think that's probably incorrect, I'm sure a Polish citizen can write an incorrect"
00:15:47,00:15:48,name.
00:15:48,00:15:50,It's right because it's got that L with a line through it which is like pronounced
00:15:50,00:15:53,"like a W a little bit isn't it, I think, or something."
00:15:53,00:15:54,Frodishrov.
00:15:54,00:15:57,He moved to France and he changed his name to make it a bit easier for people to pronounce
00:15:57,00:16:01,"I think, to Ladislas Starovic."
00:16:01,00:16:04,"I'm sure you guys read loads of the descriptions of the movies, I really like the Cameraman's"
00:16:04,00:16:05,Revenge.
00:16:05,00:16:06,Did you see this one?
00:16:06,00:16:07,This is so good.
00:16:07,00:16:10,"So Mr and Mrs Beetle, married couple, they're bored."
00:16:10,00:16:14,"They became less realistic over time, didn't they?"
00:16:14,00:16:20,"So Mr Beetle meets a dragonfly who is in the middle of an affair with Mr Grasshopper, right?"
00:16:20,00:16:21,But Mr Beetle is so sexy.
00:16:21,00:16:24,He steals away Mrs Dragonfly from Mr Grasshopper.
00:16:24,00:16:29,"Grasshopper, the cuck in this scenario, is furious but he's also a cameraman, okay?"
00:16:29,00:16:34,"And he films Mr Beetle's affair with his ex, Mrs Dragonfly, right?"
00:16:34,00:16:39,"Anyway, Mr Beetle and Mrs Beetle, they're eventually reconciled with each other and they, you know,"
00:16:39,00:16:42,they get back together and they say let's go to the movies.
00:16:42,00:16:47,But the projectionist at the cinema is Mr Grasshopper and he puts on a movie called The
00:16:47,00:16:50,Unfaithful Husband which is footage of Mr Beetle having it off with Mrs Dragonfly.
00:16:50,00:16:55,"I have some questions about this, about Beetle's and Dragonfly's having sex with each other."
00:16:55,00:16:57,"That's unrealistic, Charlie."
00:16:57,00:17:01,"It's kind of fan fiction, like."
00:17:01,00:17:07,"That's a lot of plot for what were, I thought, like 30-second movies back in the day."
00:17:07,00:17:08,How long is this?
00:17:08,00:17:12,"This was his, this was his magnum opus, this was his citizen cane, yeah, I don't know."
00:17:12,00:17:13,But anyway.
00:17:13,00:17:14,I think it was a bit longer.
00:17:14,00:17:15,"A few minutes, yeah."
00:17:15,00:17:17,It's about 13 minutes I can see now.
00:17:17,00:17:18,"Oh, okay."
00:17:18,00:17:22,"His magnum opus came a bit later, wasn't it, was The Tale of the Fox, which was the first"
00:17:22,00:17:26,"feature animation film, so it's over an hour long."
00:17:26,00:17:27,"Oh, wow."
00:17:27,00:17:31,"And that's, what I find interesting about that is it's based on a Goethe story called"
00:17:31,00:17:38,"Reinecker-Fuchs, which is based on a much, much older kind of medieval story called Reynard"
00:17:38,00:17:39,the Fox.
00:17:39,00:17:43,"And Reynard the Fox is basically, it's a fox and a wolf and the fox is very sly and"
00:17:43,00:17:48,amoral but he's very charismatic and he always gets into trouble and you have all these medieval
00:17:48,00:17:53,stories about this fox doing naughty things but eventually a bit like Dennis the Menace
00:17:53,00:17:56,kind of getting his way in the end.
00:17:56,00:18:00,And these tales have been going since the 12th century.
00:18:00,00:18:02,And in English they're called Reynard the Fox.
00:18:02,00:18:09,In French they're called Reynard the Fox and Reynard is now French for Fox.
00:18:09,00:18:12,And so the French word for fox comes from this character from the medieval history.
00:18:12,00:18:13,"Oh, wow."
00:18:13,00:18:14,Isn't that interesting?
00:18:14,00:18:15,Yeah.
00:18:15,00:18:16,Fox the Fox.
00:18:16,00:18:17,That's awesome.
00:18:17,00:18:21,"And that one he, so he got adept at making other animals, didn't he?"
00:18:21,00:18:23,Not just insects.
00:18:23,00:18:26,"And in fact, everywhere seemed to say he worked completely alone, which he did."
00:18:26,00:18:29,He didn't like outside influence and he turned down Hollywood because he wanted to do it
00:18:29,00:18:30,all himself.
00:18:30,00:18:35,But he didn't like outside of his family assistance but his wife was a tailor I think
00:18:35,00:18:39,and his wife made a lot of the animals for him and his daughter directed and wrote a
00:18:39,00:18:40,lot of his films with him.
00:18:40,00:18:46,"But in the Reynard the Fox he made like, I think he made some lots of animals out of"
00:18:46,00:18:47,different animals.
00:18:47,00:18:48,It seems really weird.
00:18:48,00:18:53,Like the lion was made of deer skin I think and just really mixing it up.
00:18:53,00:18:54,Wow.
00:18:54,00:18:55,But it's very adult content.
00:18:55,00:18:57,Animation was not for kids back then.
00:18:57,00:18:59,It's kind of dark.
00:18:59,00:19:03,"Again, that one, look that up online, the animation is phenomenal in that."
00:19:03,00:19:04,It's absolutely extraordinary.
00:19:04,00:19:06,"And as you're saying James, it was the first animation."
00:19:06,00:19:12,"So it beats Snow White, which is seen as the seminal opening animated movie of Hollywood."
00:19:12,00:19:14,Beat it by eight months in coming out.
00:19:14,00:19:18,So this guy was a true pioneer who's sort of been lost to the annals of history slightly.
00:19:18,00:19:23,Do you want to hear the least relevant fact that I found in the research for this section?
00:19:23,00:19:29,It's about art and insects and drawings and filming.
00:19:29,00:19:32,So this is a sports writer fact and in fact it's a newsy one.
00:19:32,00:19:37,There is a team of two men whose job is to go along the length of the route of the Tour
00:19:37,00:19:44,de France and their job is to draw butterflies out of penises that people have graffiti
00:19:44,00:19:45,on the road.
00:19:45,00:19:53,"They're called the Eraser Men, Les Fassers and this is a great article about them on"
00:19:53,00:19:54,the Ruler website.
00:19:54,00:19:57,"Basically you're filming from above, aren't you, the Tour de France and people go along"
00:19:57,00:20:01,the route every year writing insane graffiti.
00:20:01,00:20:04,They draw a lot of syringes because they're implying that you know the cyclists are all
00:20:04,00:20:05,saying.
00:20:05,00:20:09,"There's loads of messages like Ale, Alaphilippe or whoever like whoever's they put messages"
00:20:09,00:20:12,for their favourite riders but I've never seen a penis.
00:20:12,00:20:16,Well that's because Les Fassers are doing their job and every 100 metres or so on the
00:20:16,00:20:20,route apparently there's a penis and they have to transform it or they make it unrecognisable
00:20:20,00:20:21,if they can't do a decent butterfly.
00:20:21,00:20:23,Are the testicles the two big eyeballs?
00:20:23,00:20:31,I would think that the wings might be relevant there but their versatile is what I'm saying
00:20:31,00:20:35,and they change the syringes into ladders and you know they just...
00:20:35,00:20:38,"They're very pointy bit on the top of that ladders, isn't that?"
00:20:38,00:20:41,Turn that into the Empire State Building instead.
00:20:41,00:20:47,You've got thousands of miles of road to go and you're saying do the Empire State Building.
00:20:47,00:20:49,"You've got 40,000 windows on it."
00:20:49,00:20:50,Oh my god.
00:20:50,00:20:53,Who's paying them to do this?
00:20:53,00:20:59,I think it's either the broadcaster or the organisers of the Tour de France.
00:20:59,00:21:01,I know they use hundreds of litres of paint.
00:21:01,00:21:02,It's tough.
00:21:02,00:21:03,It's tough work.
00:21:03,00:21:07,It's not as tough as actually cycling in the Tour de France is it but sure.
00:21:07,00:21:08,I don't know.
00:21:08,00:21:09,It must be stressful.
00:21:09,00:21:10,They're ahead of the Tour de France.
00:21:10,00:21:11,Come on.
00:21:11,00:21:12,Come on.
00:21:12,00:21:15,I just need to do the proboscis on this butterfly.
00:21:15,00:21:19,They're catching up.
00:21:19,00:21:26,This movie The Tale of the Fox which was by Starevich we said was one of the early animations.
00:21:26,00:21:29,It was the first feature animation puppet film.
00:21:29,00:21:32,There were a few older feature animation films.
00:21:32,00:21:37,The oldest that we have which is still extant is called The Adventures of Prince Ahmed and
00:21:37,00:21:45,it's by the German animator Lotta Reiniger and she used a system a bit like Shadow Puppets.
00:21:45,00:21:49,"I don't know if you guys have seen, in fact I know you have seen Harry Potter and the"
00:21:49,00:21:50,Deathly Hallows part one.
00:21:50,00:21:53,I didn't know we've seen it.
00:21:53,00:21:55,Well I'm just looking at you.
00:21:55,00:21:58,I've known you for long enough but you've definitely seen that.
00:21:58,00:21:59,We're all wearing our sorting hats.
00:21:59,00:22:05,There's a bit where they tell a little short film inside the film called The Tale of the
00:22:05,00:22:06,Three Brothers.
00:22:06,00:22:07,It's that kind of style.
00:22:07,00:22:10,And yeah this woman called Lotta Reiniger.
00:22:10,00:22:15,She made this animation technique and she made loads and loads of movies and the first
00:22:15,00:22:17,one she made was in 1926.
00:22:17,00:22:23,What I like about her is that she later married her creative partner called Karl Koch but she
00:22:23,00:22:28,"kept her name Lotta Reiniger so that she wasn't called a ""Mottercock""."
00:22:28,00:22:41,I'm not sure that was the reason she did that but it's got to be.
00:22:41,00:22:44,Okay it is time for fact number three and that is my fact.
00:22:44,00:22:49,My fact this week is that the man who popularized toothpicks in American restaurants did so
00:22:49,00:22:54,by paying Harvard men to eat at fine establishments and then shout at the waiters if they were
00:22:54,00:22:57,told wooden toothpicks were not available.
00:22:57,00:23:04,So yeah it's a sort of cheeky promotional tool to get your product bought.
00:23:04,00:23:11,This was a guy called Charles Forster and he was a guy who had seen when he was overseas
00:23:11,00:23:16,in Brazil toothpicks being used by many people in South America.
00:23:16,00:23:18,He thought this is something that should be done here.
00:23:18,00:23:24,"So he went back home and he managed to design the modern day toothpick, the really cheap"
00:23:24,00:23:27,little wooden stick that we find in most places.
00:23:27,00:23:29,That is Charles Forster's invention.
00:23:29,00:23:34,And once he had the invention he thought how can I convince Americans that they need
00:23:34,00:23:38,"this in their mouths because it was seen as sort of a bit crude, no one was really interested"
00:23:38,00:23:39,in it.
00:23:39,00:23:43,"So he used to pay people, particularly sort of very rich people like Harvard men to go"
00:23:43,00:23:48,"in, cause a ruckus and then they would threaten to never eat in the establishment again and"
00:23:48,00:23:53,once they left the next day Charles Forster would either himself or send someone else
00:23:53,00:23:57,there going would you like to buy a box of wooden toothpicks and the owner goes of course
00:23:57,00:23:58,yes thank you.
00:23:58,00:24:04,"Why didn't the owner ever go hmm, how suspicious, I wonder if Harvard guys randomly kicked"
00:24:04,00:24:08,"up a huge fuss yesterday about this, I mean you'd see it coming."
00:24:08,00:24:12,"Well he would sometimes go in first as well so let's say there was a shopkeeper, he would"
00:24:12,00:24:15,"go into a shop and he would say to the shopkeeper look would you like to buy some of these new,"
00:24:15,00:24:18,I'm selling them toothpicks you could buy a few boxes of them and the shopkeeper would
00:24:18,00:24:23,"say I'm not interested and then he would hire a young person to go into the shop, ask for"
00:24:23,00:24:26,"some toothpicks, not be able to get any cause the shopkeeper had said no, then he would"
00:24:26,00:24:30,"go back, the shopkeeper would say alright I will have some toothpicks, then the young"
00:24:30,00:24:34,"people would go back in, buy the toothpicks, return them to Charles Forster who then has"
00:24:34,00:24:38,the toothpicks back again that he sold to the shopkeeper in the first place.
00:24:38,00:24:40,But then he reused the toothpicks.
00:24:40,00:24:45,Yeah he would resell them then to the shop which to me means he's making a loss.
00:24:45,00:24:46,Yeah absolutely.
00:24:46,00:24:50,If there's a markup in the shop he's losing that amount of money but I can only assume
00:24:50,00:24:54,"he then sells in bulk after that, he's like I would sell you 20 boxes."
00:24:54,00:24:59,"I hope so because if not, maybe that's why this guy wasn't the biggest financier ever"
00:24:59,00:25:02,but yeah it feels like a risk but I guess it was a risk that it was worth taking.
00:25:02,00:25:06,A lot of gullible shopkeepers and restaurateurs around in those days.
00:25:06,00:25:11,He claimed his toothpicks were made of the choicest part of the white birch log.
00:25:11,00:25:14,Which sounds like he's going one toothpick per mug.
00:25:14,00:25:21,Really? I'm just going to find the exact part of that birch tree but no you make millions
00:25:21,00:25:23,and millions from each one didn't you?
00:25:23,00:25:29,And he did this all in a bit of America called Strong which is in Maine and for a long time
00:25:29,00:25:35,that was the toothpick capital of the world as they called themselves so 95% of all wooden
00:25:35,00:25:38,toothpicks manufactured in America were out of strong.
00:25:38,00:25:43,So we're talking something around the World War II period 75 billion toothpicks per year
00:25:43,00:25:44,were being sent out.
00:25:44,00:25:45,That's too many.
00:25:45,00:25:46,That's too many.
00:25:46,00:25:51,There was a thousand people living in that town at the time so that meant each per year
00:25:51,00:25:54,they were making 75 million toothpicks.
00:25:54,00:26:01,5 billion? What were they being used for? They mostly went to waste surely.
00:26:01,00:26:05,Given the world's population that would be every person using 25 per year but I'm sure
00:26:05,00:26:07,they weren't as evenly distributed as that.
00:26:07,00:26:10,No and back then much smaller.
00:26:10,00:26:14,"I like that we're talking about Strong in Maine, we were talking about Strong in Maine"
00:26:14,00:26:15,earlier.
00:26:15,00:26:18,Stronger than Maine.
00:26:18,00:26:23,When the demand declined for toothpicks when people realised we don't need a thousand
00:26:23,00:26:29,each per year they tried to innovate because obviously these factories in Strong suddenly
00:26:29,00:26:34,they didn't know what to do and so they tried to come up with new versions of toothpicks
00:26:34,00:26:38,and one of them was they would make it square in the middle so that when you put it on a
00:26:38,00:26:39,table it wouldn't roll off.
00:26:39,00:26:45,I don't know how clever it is Anna because I think that it's never been a huge problem
00:26:45,00:26:47,for me as you put your toothpick down on the table.
00:26:47,00:26:48,It has for me.
00:26:48,00:26:49,It has for me.
00:26:49,00:26:53,How wonky are your tables that are so the toothpick is rolling off just adjust the angle
00:26:53,00:26:55,that the toothpick is on and that'll solve the problem.
00:26:55,00:26:59,My housemates get really pissed off because I'm a compulsive toothpick user I probably
00:26:59,00:27:04,go through about 10 a day and they are all over the floor because you put them on your
00:27:04,00:27:09,desk yes it's a bit of a wobbly desk it falls onto the sitting room floor get a new one it's
00:27:09,00:27:11,an issue and I can't believe these didn't take off.
00:27:11,00:27:14,I can't believe you were questioning how many toothpicks were needed per day.
00:27:14,00:27:15,I know.
00:27:15,00:27:16,The pot twist.
00:27:16,00:27:17,I'm the main consumer.
00:27:17,00:27:18,10 a day.
00:27:18,00:27:22,Apparently he wasn't even very good at making stuff for stay I think he was just a good
00:27:22,00:27:28,businessman wasn't he like he requisitioned shoe peg makers to make toothpicks and apparently
00:27:28,00:27:33,they used the same skills but see that seems so weird to me because a shoe peg was something
00:27:33,00:27:38,that attached the like heel of a shoe the base of a shoe to the top of a shoe and so it's
00:27:38,00:27:42,got to be quite thick to do that right that's like when you've got to attach two bits together
00:27:42,00:27:47,in DIY it's got to be like a dowel like your thumb exactly and then they turn that into
00:27:47,00:27:51,a toothpick that seems if you're using a toothpick to hold your shoe together your shoe's coming
00:27:51,00:27:52,off.
00:27:52,00:27:55,But it's an easier I guess it's an easier technology to adjust it's probably one of
00:27:55,00:27:58,the closest things to an actual toothpick that existed or could be made at the time.
00:27:58,00:28:02,You wouldn't take someone who made telegraph poles right and they get them to make two
00:28:02,00:28:07,picks because that's a bigger change isn't it? And they were often missing teeth back
00:28:07,00:28:10,then so maybe the gaps were a lot bigger.
00:28:10,00:28:16,I was reading a book which was called The Toothpick by a guy called Henry Petroski did you guys
00:28:16,00:28:22,come across this it's one of those great authors who just picks one item yeah and he just tells
00:28:22,00:28:26,the whole history of the object so obviously Charles Worcester invented the sort of very
00:28:26,00:28:30,cheap disposable toothpicks but toothpicks have been there throughout history Royals
00:28:30,00:28:35,have used them but everyone sort of had a really spectacular toothpick that they could
00:28:35,00:28:37,use over and over again.
00:28:37,00:28:41,They would often wear it in a box around their neck on a chain yeah you would carry your
00:28:41,00:28:46,toothpick that's there's in this book he claims that there is definitely evidence that during
00:28:46,00:28:48,the renaissance that used to be done.
00:28:48,00:28:51,Like people used to carry their knives around this stuff did people just have a load of
00:28:51,00:28:53,cutlery attached to their body all the time.
00:28:53,00:28:55,Spoon on the nose.
00:28:55,00:28:59,There's an anonymous painting that was done called Queen Elizabeth as an old woman which
00:28:59,00:29:03,shows her wearing multiple chains around her neck and one of them which would have had her
00:29:03,00:29:09,toothpick in and we know that she had toothpicks because in 1570 there's an account of her
00:29:09,00:29:13,having received a gift of six gold toothpicks as well as and this seems to have disappeared
00:29:13,00:29:20,from sort of day use tooth cloths never heard of that a little cloth for your teeth I guess
00:29:20,00:29:26,instead of a brush did you just like hang yeah that's really maybe yes I know you should
00:29:26,00:29:28,get one of these things to hang around your neck and you could just keep one toothpick
00:29:28,00:29:32,in there yeah problem solved I think that's a really good idea because at the moment I
00:29:32,00:29:35,replace the toothpick back into my huge bowl of toothpicks that I keep in every room and
00:29:35,00:29:39,then you don't know which one you last used it's not very hygienic at all are you kidding
00:29:39,00:29:43,no you put it back in the I don't think that's the point of the toothpick holder other people
00:29:43,00:29:48,find that weird but it seems so wasteful to just use it once absolutely there's a toothpick
00:29:48,00:29:52,mystery that I think has been in the back of everyone's mind since the day you first
00:29:52,00:29:57,saw one of these toothpicks okay you know the toothpicks which are called Japanese toothpicks
00:29:57,00:30:02,and they have little grooves at one end oh yeah those are the fancy ones in my mind they're
00:30:02,00:30:07,the fancy ones exactly usually you see them in maybe a nicer restaurant and why do they
00:30:07,00:30:14,have those grooves so they don't roll as easily off the table increase your grip avoid stabbing
00:30:14,00:30:18,yourself in the gum grip very good answer rolling don't know because they're not that
00:30:18,00:30:21,the grooves aren't going that way so I don't know if that would help okay what they're
00:30:21,00:30:26,for is they are for snapping the end off to indicate the toothpick has been used which
00:30:26,00:30:31,would you would not need to do if you were me but a lot of people like to say this has
00:30:31,00:30:35,been done don't use it and also someone pointed out I don't know if this was in mind when
00:30:35,00:30:39,they were designed but you can then use the end you've snapped off as a stand so another
00:30:39,00:30:43,problem I always have with toothpicks is that the end is lying on a table or a chair or
00:30:43,00:30:52,sofa and that gets dirty right whereas if you prop it up with its other end that you've
00:30:52,00:30:58,snapped off isn't that so clever yeah it's really clever yeah people think that you shouldn't
00:30:58,00:31:03,use toothpicks though right a lot of dentists say you shouldn't really use them what because
00:31:03,00:31:07,they can pierce your gums and give bacteria a chance to get in because they're quite spiky
00:31:07,00:31:13,especially the wooden ones so you're using them wrong well the American Dental Association
00:31:13,00:31:18,suggests not to use them they say you should use them there are certain better like softer
00:31:18,00:31:24,toothpicks that you can use rather than those wooden ones writer Sherwood Anderson died because
00:31:24,00:31:28,he swallowed a toothpick okay that is using it wrong there's one thing to just poke it
00:31:28,00:31:33,into your gum but to eat the entire thing well in fairness to him it was from a martini
00:31:33,00:31:39,so okay so the olive presumably he was going for that he must have really been thirsty
00:31:39,00:31:42,he must have been rushing to the bar can't wait to get that first drink I'm just going
00:31:42,00:31:48,to drink the whole thing and there was a study in the New England Journal of Medicine about
00:31:48,00:31:53,someone who swallowed a toothpick and nearly died it had been hidden in a sandwich by which
00:31:53,00:31:57,I don't think someone had actually hidden it I think maybe it was holding the sandwich
00:31:57,00:32:01,together and I haven't noticed it but the problem is because it was made of wood all
00:32:01,00:32:06,of these scans you couldn't see it and even when they gave them a colonoscopy they couldn't
00:32:06,00:32:11,see it because it's so small and even when they did surgery it was really hard to see
00:32:11,00:32:15,because the hole was so so tiny and it was only eventually when they were doing the
00:32:15,00:32:18,surgery they kind of found the toothpick lodged in his artery and they realised that that
00:32:18,00:32:23,was the problem is it a huge this is a test in the artery would that come out if it made
00:32:23,00:32:26,it to his stomach would that have come out in would it have been broken down it's not
00:32:26,00:32:31,guaranteed to so this year there was a report manager Pan he'd swallowed a toothpick and
00:32:31,00:32:34,he had months of pain in his back and leg and it had been stuck in his basically in
00:32:34,00:32:39,his rectum and it's a seven centimetre long toothpick he'd swallowed by mistake but this
00:32:39,00:32:45,"so this does happen apparently in the 1980s in America alone 8,000 people a year were"
00:32:45,00:32:51,being injured by toothpicks but not swallowing that's not by a lot of swallowing they just
00:32:51,00:32:58,lying good that he for table and it was presumably injuries could be from accidentally poking
00:32:58,00:33:05,your throat too hard or like what are you going in your mouth you might make a mistake
00:33:05,00:33:09,you might miss your mouth it's quite hard even to get to the back molars to be honest
00:33:09,00:33:13,a lot of people use it I mean I think q-tips were invented because the guy who invented
00:33:13,00:33:18,q-tips saw his wife using a toothpick on her son or daughter's ears to pick out so like
00:33:18,00:33:21,you know people do use it for weird things I think in fairness they were putting a bit
00:33:21,00:33:25,of cloth on the end of the toothpick it wasn't just shoving in the spiky okay because I have
00:33:25,00:33:31,done that with a toothpick wow yeah this is not my children on me right really yeah inside
00:33:31,00:33:38,your ear yeah wow I think I've got to say the personal hygiene of all of both of you
00:33:38,00:33:43,thank you James thank you it was more than two meters now don't you but there are lots
00:33:43,00:33:47,of this is this is a huge problem there was a dentist who was interviewed by an outlet
00:33:47,00:33:50,called shore news he was called Jamie Bell he said more people choke on toothpicks than
00:33:50,00:33:55,on food which I find it's true yeah I saw that but I can't be true can it I mean okay
00:33:55,00:34:00,but there was an analysis of toothpicks swallowing cases which had made it to medical journals
00:34:00,00:34:05,because obviously most toothpick incidents probably don't make it to a medical journal
00:34:05,00:34:10,but of the ones which make it to medical journals 10% a fatal of toothpicks swallowing incidents
00:34:10,00:34:15,which is a lot scary and of though of all of the cases which are made into the journals
00:34:15,00:34:19,half the patients didn't know that they'd swallowed a toothpick so it seems like it's
00:34:19,00:34:25,easier to do so Anna check yourself I think I think it's with what we were saying before
00:34:25,00:34:30,I've been to a few restaurants where to hold a big burger together a toothpick goes in and
00:34:30,00:34:33,it goes in a bit too far and you find yourself hitting on a toothpick as you're biting into
00:34:33,00:34:37,the burger like that's where that's where the yeah they've obviously been fashionable
00:34:37,00:34:43,throughout history in terms of having them sticking out of your mouth very cool it is
00:34:43,00:34:50,cool very cool look was very dangerous yeah you're a bad boy basically is that why cowboys
00:34:50,00:34:56,are doing it is to signify they don't value their own life so 1870s it was extremely cool
00:34:56,00:35:01,for people to be chewing on toothpicks apparently every third woman in a particular area of
00:35:01,00:35:04,Boston had one sticking out of her mouth at any one time well this was this was Charles
00:35:04,00:35:10,Foster's boom right yes was as a result this was the moment 1870s when it erupted but even
00:35:10,00:35:15,before that people obviously went around doing it was reading a 16th century book of kind
00:35:15,00:35:20,of table manners and advised do not go around with a toothpick in your mouth like a bird
00:35:20,00:35:25,going to build his nest or stick it behind your ear like a barber does his comb which
00:35:25,00:35:30,obviously implies people are people are doing that yeah have you guys heard of Stan Monroe
00:35:30,00:35:35,no Stan Monroe ten years ago his wife had a few operations but while she was having
00:35:35,00:35:39,her operations Stan Monroe needed to take his mind off things and so started to build
00:35:39,00:35:47,stuff out of toothpicks and he has built the most buildings out of toothpicks of anyone
00:35:47,00:35:52,in the world he says the quickest one he had to do was the Washington Monument even though
00:35:52,00:36:03,it's really big one toothpick it's more than one toothpick the Eiffel Tower is four going
00:36:03,00:36:09,up to the same point they're very very intricate he uses actual blueprints to make them they're
00:36:09,00:36:18,all built one to 164 scale every single one and what's really cool is that he read that
00:36:18,00:36:22,the workers on the Empire State Building when they did the real Empire State Building they
00:36:22,00:36:29,used to carve their wives names into the buildings and so in all of his toothpick buildings he
00:36:29,00:36:38,has his wife's names somewhere in them I guess possibly into a few because otherwise that
00:36:38,00:36:42,would be quite small but yeah well there is this guy called Willard Wigan who we've actually
00:36:42,00:36:49,mentioned once before ages ago who does tiny sculptures and one of the things he does is
00:36:49,00:36:55,he sculpts into individual toothpicks and he'll sculpt famous people so he did back in the
00:36:55,00:37:00,year 2000 he did the Beckham so David Beckham is one toothpick Victoria Beckham is the other
00:37:00,00:37:05,their kid was the other I mean it's tiny and it took him a week I think Willard Wigan is
00:37:05,00:37:11,he the man behind the impossible micro world in Bath I think yes yes he is exactly they
00:37:11,00:37:17,had a touring exhibition it was the most incredible thing I've ever seen it was so good yes you
00:37:17,00:37:22,do you do he has sorry I didn't see the Beckham's I don't know if they were in that exhibition
00:37:22,00:37:27,but I remember he did a horse a statue of a horse dancing and the statue itself was
00:37:27,00:37:31,balanced on the head of an ant which was in the display case he's unbelievable I wrote
00:37:31,00:37:38,him once but he never wrote back he might have done but his letter was so small just
00:37:38,00:37:51,a tiny toothpick through your letter box okay it's time for our final fact of the show and
00:37:51,00:37:58,that is Andy my fact is that there is a blue plaque in London which has its own blue plaque
00:37:58,00:38:03,pretty cool yeah why does it why well the original plaque plaque one as I'm going to
00:38:03,00:38:08,call it from now on is to Isaac Newton and it was his home when he was the president
00:38:08,00:38:13,of the Royal Society it's in German Street which is quite near Piccadilly in London and
00:38:13,00:38:19,the building was rebuilt and it was finished in 1915 and the plaque was reattached but
00:38:19,00:38:24,it then had a supplementary plaque attached saying this plaque was you know reattached
00:38:24,00:38:31,it's not round the bonus plaque plaque to is rectangular okay no and I should say I got
00:38:31,00:38:36,this from someone I know Will Noble who had seen it in the works of Marc Mason who we
00:38:36,00:38:43,know who's been on fish and has been on fish yeah yeah now my understanding of blue plaques
00:38:43,00:38:47,the English heritage blue plaques is that to earn a blue plaque you need to have made
00:38:47,00:38:52,a significant and positive contribution to society I would be interested to know what
00:38:52,00:38:58,contribution that plaque made to society you know can I get a plan I mean how easy can
00:38:58,00:39:03,it be I think maybe that was before the rules were tightened up so English heritage took
00:39:03,00:39:07,over in about the 1980s they took over from the London County Council and the London County
00:39:07,00:39:11,Council took over from maybe the Royal Society of Arts the first people to do it with the
00:39:11,00:39:14,Royal Society of Arts it's been through about four bodies have had the responsibility of
00:39:14,00:39:20,putting up blue plaques and English heritage are now just in London the ones they do and
00:39:20,00:39:26,they are if you like the original maybe the best they're certainly the most stringent
00:39:26,00:39:30,in their requirements because there are dozens and dozens of facts in it yeah the first thing
00:39:30,00:39:35,you need to do is die yeah and then you need to have been dead for 20 years yeah yeah so
00:39:35,00:39:42,get in there early and then someone has to nominate you but you're only allowed to nominate
00:39:42,00:39:46,one person a year if you're a member of the public yeah so you can't just send loads and
00:39:46,00:39:50,loads of what about this person what about this person what about this person and then
00:39:50,00:39:57,it goes to a panel of 12 people including a few historians like Rosemary Hill and David
00:39:57,00:40:02,Olusoga and people like that and then they decide and then you have another problem because
00:40:02,00:40:06,you have to find the owner of the building and sometimes they don't reply to your emails
00:40:06,00:40:12,or they don't want you know they don't want they write back but tiny you put up a tiny
00:40:12,00:40:16,plaque the size of a button but yeah some people don't want them on their house do they
00:40:16,00:40:21,is that I mean surely if out of sheer selfishness I guess it would increase the value of the
00:40:21,00:40:25,building well there was an interview with Howard Spencer who's in charge of English
00:40:25,00:40:31,heritage and he said that it does increase the value of your house for sure but not by
00:40:31,00:40:39,enough he said you'd be better off modernizing a bathroom but in the same article I read
00:40:39,00:40:43,there was an interview with Caroline Mittwock who is a researcher who lives on Wimpol Street
00:40:43,00:40:48,which is where Frederick Treves who was a surgeon of the Elephant Man lived and she
00:40:48,00:40:52,says it can be quite annoying because you get tourists kind of stood outside gawping
00:40:52,00:40:56,at the front of your house and when you're trying to come in with your bags of shopping
00:40:56,00:41:00,you don't want to go around them so yeah it is there are frustrations but also they're
00:41:00,00:41:04,so strict about the rules and there was a complaint a few years ago someone wanted a
00:41:04,00:41:11,plaque to Elizabeth Taylor okay and they had written back saying it's not yet 20 years
00:41:11,00:41:15,since she died and we are not as a result going to consider her and the guy who had made the
00:41:15,00:41:19,suggestion had kind of promised to Elizabeth Taylor that he would try and get her a plaque
00:41:19,00:41:22,and he said it's so annoying they should just weigh the rule because in 20 years all the
00:41:22,00:41:26,fans who would have paid attention will themselves be dead and no one will pay any interest and
00:41:26,00:41:30,I would have thought that's kind of the point of why the 20 year rule exists yeah he's identified
00:41:30,00:41:34,as the reason for the rule and I was just going yes thank you for confirming we've made
00:41:34,00:41:39,the right choice. Although there was one person called Phillip Jones who was a trumpet player
00:41:39,00:41:45,who died in 2000 and people think that he probably will have a blue plaque in the end
00:41:45,00:41:49,but the problem was they had to wait 20 years and that would mean that his wife who's still
00:41:49,00:41:53,living would probably never get to see it so you know you can see in a way that it would
00:41:53,00:41:58,be nicer for some people to get it a bit. Yeah it would be nice but I'm afraid it's not the
00:41:58,00:42:03,"point of a blue plaque to make everyone's Tom, Dick and Harry's wives happy it's meant to"
00:42:03,00:42:07,be someone who's making a lasting contribution to the world and if everyone's forgotten you
00:42:07,00:42:11,after 20 years then I'm afraid you don't deserve one. Okay well if you want one you can just
00:42:11,00:42:15,buy one yourself. Yeah. It doesn't really matter I mean there's nothing to stop you from just
00:42:15,00:42:19,buying one on your own house. Absolutely I did find a blue plaque that went to someone
00:42:19,00:42:25,who had only died 12 years before receiving it. Who? Is this in the olden days? No this
00:42:25,00:42:32,is in modern days. I say someone it's an animal Dolly the sheep. Oh but it's sheep
00:42:32,00:42:40,years. It's actually 60 years. Did they only make the one plaque for Dolly? Idiots. Yeah
00:42:40,00:42:48,that's in the Society of Biology in Edinburgh at the Roslyn Institute. There can't be many
00:42:48,00:42:55,quadrupeds who have plaques. I think the only other one I could find was the dog who was
00:42:55,00:43:02,the dog of the HMV painting his master's voice dog. Oh Nipah. Nipah's got a plaque somewhere.
00:43:02,00:43:06,These are all proper. This is an English heritage I think there are probably quite a lot of other
00:43:06,00:43:11,pet plaques. There's a couple of bipeds I know humans are bipeds as well but feathered
00:43:11,00:43:17,bipeds plaques which are pigeons who were like during the world war two kind of gave
00:43:17,00:43:21,messages and stuff from World War One. That's really cool. But not English heritage or English
00:43:21,00:43:26,heritage. Not sure. There's even fictional characters that get given blue plaques. So
00:43:26,00:43:32,I was reading that one person who's real Charles Dickens has so many he's got like 44 plaques
00:43:32,00:43:37,around the UK you know so many places he went to and wrote a book there and so on so scattered
00:43:37,00:43:43,across the UK he has them but even his characters have some plaques so Market Square and Dover
00:43:43,00:43:49,is where David Copperfield apparently rested on a doorstep and ate a loaf and that has a
00:43:49,00:43:54,plaque. I have to say I think that's insane. So there is a guy called Mike. Oh well Mike
00:43:54,00:44:00,Reed the DJ. Yeah. He is the chairman of the British plaque trust and a few years ago
00:44:00,00:44:04,he made a sizzling intervention in the debate. He said there are way too many plaques and
00:44:04,00:44:08,he quoted that one Dan from David Copperfield saying this is madness. Although there are
00:44:08,00:44:13,plaques where you know there's a hotel where JRR Tolkien stayed for a couple of nights.
00:44:13,00:44:17,Yeah. He had a weekend break. But again like Hannah says these aren't the official English
00:44:17,00:44:21,heritage ones is that right? That's correct. Yeah none of them are. So those Dickens ones
00:44:21,00:44:25,like Dickens does not have 44 English heritage plaques. So basically I don't really count
00:44:25,00:44:30,plaques as plaques unless they're English heritage. Really? They're not blue plaques.
00:44:30,00:44:34,"They can be blue but they're not. They're not capital B, capital P. They can't be the"
00:44:34,00:44:37,colour blue but that's obviously completely different to them. I mean blue plaques can
00:44:37,00:44:42,be brown can't they? Yes the original blue plaques are brown. Yes. Very confusing. Howard
00:44:42,00:44:47,Spencer said that we have no copyright on the colour of plaques. That's fair. We just
00:44:47,00:44:52,asked people try to make your style of plaque a bit different than ours. Wow. And some people
00:44:52,00:44:55,do but some people really don't. Some people don't. Why would you? No I know. If you're
00:44:55,00:44:58,going to put your own plaque on your front door you're going to make it look as much
00:44:58,00:45:03,like theirs as possible like you. The way to tell by the way if you are a blue plaque
00:45:03,00:45:07,spotter and you really are like Hannah and you think only the English heritage ones are
00:45:07,00:45:12,the true plaques then look for the screws because official blue plaques do not have
00:45:12,00:45:18,screws. They're kind of flush onto the stonework and the fake ones tend to be screwed up. Good
00:45:18,00:45:22,to know. That is a really good tip. Did you guys do about Frank and Sue Ashworth? The
00:45:22,00:45:27,blue plaque team. Oh the makers yeah. The makers of the only plaques. So they've been
00:45:27,00:45:31,doing English heritage as blue plaque since 1984 when they took over from the previous
00:45:31,00:45:36,guy who died but they got the recipe that he'd been using for a specific recipe. How
00:45:36,00:45:42,many years did they have to wait until they were given the recipe? Yeah so it was the
00:45:42,00:45:46,widow of the previous person who gave them the recipe and they're so great. They live
00:45:46,00:45:50,in Cornwall. They're hoping to hand down the business to their son Justin. There's a great
00:45:50,00:45:54,"video I think it's on the English heritage site of Sue, the mother and her son Justin"
00:45:54,00:45:59,who I guess they've been training up. And it's just a great family bickering session
00:45:59,00:46:03,so they're obviously doing a documentary about plaque making. He's making this plaque
00:46:03,00:46:07,like doing the engravings. She's giving the interview to the camera saying I'm very aware
00:46:07,00:46:10,of how important it is not to interrupt while people are concentrating and I try really
00:46:10,00:46:14,hard not to interrupt Justin and Frank. And then literally Justin starts talking about
00:46:14,00:46:18,what a perfectionist he is and she says the entire time interrupting him saying I'm so
00:46:18,00:46:22,sorry. You're doing it a bit. Oh I just think the lettering is a bit thick. Sorry. Sorry
00:46:22,00:46:25,for interrupting. It is a bit thick there. It's just annoying to have to pare it down
00:46:25,00:46:33,isn't it Justin. It's so sweet. Oh so funny. They're really sweet. They're lovely. Also
00:46:33,00:46:37,the other person who fits into this scheme apart from the Ashworth family is a man called
00:46:37,00:46:41,Trevor Ramsey from Sunderland. Did you find out about him? No. No. He is the man who fits
00:46:41,00:46:47,all the blue plaques and he's done 200 of them in the last 16 years. Cool. Yeah and he is
00:46:47,00:46:51,the one who creates the hole in the wall so it fits perfectly flush. And yeah as James
00:46:51,00:46:56,says it can't be screwed on. There has to be a perfectly sized hole in the wall and he
00:46:56,00:47:00,hangs the curtains as well. I always wondered who did the curtains. I love the curtains.
00:47:00,00:47:04,I didn't know though. So there's a big reveal moment. Oh yeah. Always. There's always a
00:47:04,00:47:09,reveal. You know those curtains where I now declare this. Yeah yeah yeah. And I just I'd
00:47:09,00:47:13,never knew who made the curtains. No I think not very many people do. I think you're not
00:47:13,00:47:16,going to get laughed out of a pub if you say you know I'm so embarrassed about this but
00:47:16,00:47:23,I don't even know who makes the curtains. Another hack question in tonight's pub quiz.
00:47:23,00:47:27,Everyone gets it. The first ever plaque doesn't exist anymore. The first plaque put up in London
00:47:27,00:47:33,and it was to Lord Byron and the house was demolished. It's now the central London John
00:47:33,00:47:37,Lewis. And we don't even know which house it was because I think there's no clear evidence
00:47:37,00:47:43,as to which house Byron actually lived in. It was very early in his life but it was it
00:47:43,00:47:47,was destroyed in a bomb in the wall and then another one was put up. I wonder if he'd be
00:47:47,00:47:53,happy that it's now selling overpriced crockery. Yeah. Okay. Someone's not tried the everyday
00:47:53,00:48:09,range. Truly the spirit of Byron lives on. Okay. That's it. That is all of our facts.
