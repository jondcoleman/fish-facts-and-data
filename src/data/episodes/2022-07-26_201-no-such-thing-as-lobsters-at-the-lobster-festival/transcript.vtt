WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.720
 - Hey everyone, welcome to this week's episode of Fish.

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:06.920
 Before we begin, we've just got a bit of announcement,

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.120
 really exciting announcement.

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.160
 We are releasing a behind-the-scenes documentary

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.840
 that was filmed during our 2017 tour of the UK.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.920
 And it's us on buses, it's us ironing sharks.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:19.760
 It's us.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.200
 - Can I just say, Dad, it's buses.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.360
 It's not just like buses that the public go on, is it?

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.400
 It's not like we're on the 19 bus to Angel.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.440
 - Yeah, and actually it's not even plural buses.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.640
 It's one bus, which is actually a van.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.000
 So it's, I'm just trying to big it up here.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.480
 What it is, is if you ever wanted to see what it's like

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.200
 when we actually go out on the road

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.560
 and we visit all these places in the UK

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.640
 and put on these shows, it's a sort of just

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.880
 little background insight.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.200
 It's like a very less, less funny version of spinal tap.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.040
 - Yeah, if you wanna know some kind of like

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.320
 weird twisted secrets from Andy's past

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.760
 or some weird twisted secrets from James's past

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.840
 or some perfectly normal innocent secrets from my past,

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.800
 that they're all in there, there's some interviews,

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.280
 we were interviewed and there's some of us

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.520
 just pissing around, really.

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.360
 - Yeah, this is gonna be available on Monday,

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.240
 the 29th and January, it's gonna be online exclusively.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.200
 That's right, we said no to H&B.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.880
 - What about people who aren't online?

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.320
 - They will live in ignorance.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.800
 - This will bring the last of the world onto the internet.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:19.800
 (laughing)

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.200
 - Yeah, you can get it on iTunes this Monday

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.520
 and you'll be able to get it from Google Play

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.200
 on Amazon in the very near future.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.960
 It's 1.49 per episode and it's 4.99

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.160
 for the bundle of four.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.800
 - And what's it called?

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.360
 - This is the highlight, Andy.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.920
 (laughing)

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.960
 This is why we deliberately saved this to a last.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.040
 - Yeah.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.800
 - Should we all say it together?

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:39.640
 - Sure.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.160
 - It's called the highlight.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.680
 - The highlight. - No such thing as a fit.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.960
 Present behind the gills.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.880
 - It's called behind the gills, get it, get it now.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.720
 - Yeah. - Okay, on with the show.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.200
 - Do we have a saying behind the gills clearly enough?

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.600
 It's called behind the gills.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.440
 (upbeat music)

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.960
 - Hold on, hold on.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.560
 (upbeat music)

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:11.560
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.400
 of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast,

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.960
 this week coming to you from Dunstable.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.960
 (audience cheering)

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.960
 (audience cheering)

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:31.800
 - My name is Dan Schreiber and I am sitting here

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.400
 with Anna Chazinski, Andrew Hunter Murray

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.560
 and James Harkin.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.040
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.800
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.240
 and in no particular order.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.640
 Here we go, starting with you, James Harkin.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.560
 - Okay, my fact this week is the King Ferdinand of Bulgaria

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.480
 was so scared of being murdered on the Oriental Express

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.560
 that he locked himself in the toilet.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.720
 (audience laughing)

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.240
 - Had he read the book, is that why?

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.000
 - So amazingly enough, this happened at the turn

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.400
 of the 20th century, so it happened before the book.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.240
 So the book came out, before the book,

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.000
 which came out in 1934 and before the film,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.640
 which came out two weeks ago.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.040
 (audience laughing)

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.880
 - Wow. - Did he lock himself

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.040
 in the toilet for the whole journey?

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.880
 - Do we know?

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.640
 - No, well we know that he definitely didn't do it

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.760
 for the whole journey because one thing we do know

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.000
 is that as soon as they got into Bulgaria,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.280
 he decided he wanted to drive the train.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.280
 (audience laughing)

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.280
 - And isn't it the case that when he got given the controls,

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.280
 I know that it's very hard to mess up driving a train

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.240
 'cause you're on a track, but he would put the speed up

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.280
 'cause he was a speed freak and it would go exceptionally fast

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.200
 and they were worried that it was gonna derail

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.920
 because he was just loving the...

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:47.760
 - Yeah, that's true.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.320
 - Do we know why he was so...

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.160
 I mean, were people after his head

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.320
 or were trains just known for murdering the olden days?

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.920
 - It's a bit of the first bit actually

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.840
 because it was just after he'd become king

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.760
 and he was known as Foxy Ferdinand.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:03.600
 - Oh.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.000
 - And he was known as that 'cause he was a bit of a dandy.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 Okay, and to start with, he wasn't very popular.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.320
 For instance, Queen Victoria said he is totally unfit,

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.040
 delicate, eccentric and effeminate

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.560
 and he should be stopped at once.

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:18.560
 (audience laughing)

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:19.400
 - Wow.

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.040
 - And in his country, by the end, they loved him,

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.160
 but to start off with, he was quite unpopular.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.000
 - He was, wasn't he?

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.440
 He was sort of a wimp, I think.

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.280
 - That's right.

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.240
 - So his mum seemed to control a lot of his life.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.000
 Like, for instance, his mum got him the job as king

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.840
 and it...

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.960
 (audience laughing)

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.280
 - I mean, that is how monarchy works, I think.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.840
 (audience laughing)

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.480
 - Well, that's not how he worked here, is it?

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:42.320
 Because...

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:43.160
 - It's not.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.280
 She bought him the job.

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.800
 - So Bulgaria, it was very unpopular

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.640
 the job as king of Bulgaria at that point.

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.560
 'Cause I think there was a lot of controversy,

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.160
 there was a lot of intrigue and corruption in royal circles.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.960
 So the job, actually, the throne, as they called it,

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.560
 was offered to a bunch of other people

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:59.560
 before it was offered to him.

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.440
 So it was offered to the princes of Denmark

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.520
 to princes from the Caucasus, to the king of Romania.

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.360
 And they all said, no, I think I'm all right, thanks.

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.000
 And so eventually, Foxyford announced mum said,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.560
 all right, if I give you this amount of money,

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.240
 will you let my son be king?

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.120
 - Of this place, and that's how he got there.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.560
 It was just so embarrassing.

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.720
 - King Edward of Britain died in 1910.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.920
 And Foxyford was on the way to the funeral.

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.360
 And he got a massive argument

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.040
 over where his private railway carriage should go

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.160
 in the train, because things of precedence,

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.960
 he thought, well, my carriage should obviously

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.680
 be right at the front behind the driver.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.560
 And he lost to Archduke Franz Ferdinand.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.400
 So Archduke Franz Ferdinand got his carriage

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.760
 to go right behind the driver.

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.680
 But that meant that Archduke would have to pass

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.800
 through King Ferdinand's carriage to get to the dining car.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.400
 And Ferdinand just locked the door.

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.840
 (audience laughing)

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.600
 He just said, no, you're not coming through.

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:54.640
 - But things still worked out, okay,

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:55.880
 but Franz Ferdinand, didn't they?

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:56.880
 So. - I did.

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.200
 - On the bright side.

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:00.720
 It's actually a really nice thing.

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.120
 - It's too soon, weirdly.

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.800
 (audience laughing)

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:04.640
 - Is it?

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:06.720
 - I think when it's over 100 years, you're in the clear.

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:07.880
 - Yeah.

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:08.720
 - It's weird.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.200
 We have talked about him before.

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:11.760
 If you've listened to the podcast for a while,

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:15.080
 it's quite nice because one of our main podcast facts

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.400
 about two years ago was that Kaiser Wilhelm

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.240
 once slapped him on the bottom.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.840
 And he was so offended by this that he was gonna give him

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.320
 an arms contract, but then he gave it away to someone else.

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.200
 And in that show, we talked about Kaiser Wilhelm a lot.

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.840
 So now we're kind of coming back.

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.680
 Like, if you did a series, you'd cover one.

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.200
 - Yeah, we've seen it from the other angle, aren't we?

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.200
 - Oh, yeah.

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.040
 He was very upset about the bottom slapping.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.040
 (audience laughing)

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:38.280
 - It's like that new episode of 50 Shades of Grey,

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.600
 isn't it from Grey's side?

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:41.880
 - I didn't know that was what it was.

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:42.880
 - And with a slapping part?

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:43.880
 - Yes.

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:44.720
 - Yeah.

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.880
 - A lot of body slapping in 50 Shades of Grey, I gather.

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:50.000
 - I think it's written a bit different

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.320
 to how you just, he walked in, saw the body.

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.960
 (audience laughing)

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.760
 That's getting a slap, he said.

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.800
 (audience laughing)

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.360
 - Heal James, I really regret getting Andrew

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.440
 on tomorrow to ghost right in the second one.

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:06.680
 (audience laughing)

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:10.640
 - I read another method of how a Bulgarian,

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:14.440
 or in this case, all of Bulgaria, avoided being killed.

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:17.240
 And it is, and I've been assured that this is not true,

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.640
 but I think it's worth saying.

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.760
 (audience laughing)

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:22.320
 And the nice thing is, we've now got that on tape,

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:23.820
 so you can stitch that before any fact

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:25.080
 downstairs in the future ever.

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:26.080
 (audience laughing)

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.720
 No, but so this is true in Bulgaria,

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:31.960
 when a Bulgarian is signaling yes,

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:33.360
 when you ask them a question,

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:36.000
 they do it with a horizontal,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:36.840
 they shake their head.

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:39.720
 They shake their head, as what we would know is no,

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:40.840
 they shake as a yes.

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:43.680
 And when you ask a question that is a yes answer,

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:46.280
 they don't do a full nod, but they do an up,

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:49.280
 which is what we would take to be yes, right?

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:50.640
 - Is that, sorry, someone just said yes,

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.080
 and do we have a Bulgarian?

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:53.080
 - That is true.

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.160
 - Yeah, so that, I know that, if we have a Bulgarian,

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:56.680
 we won't know whether they are in the audience,

00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:58.160
 'cause are you a Bulgarian?

00:07:58.160 --> 00:07:59.800
 (audience laughing)

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:02.320
 Well, well, confusingly, apparently,

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:04.120
 if you're talking to a Bulgarian,

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.960
 and they know that you're from some other country,

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:10.280
 they then reappropriate it, so they do that, the opposite way.

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:11.560
 So it's very confusing, 'cause you don't know

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.200
 which one is the right answer to it.

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:15.320
 This whole thing was about how they stopped being killed.

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:17.320
 - Yes, yes.

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:19.280
 (audience laughing)

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.880
 So apparently, this goes back to the Ottoman times,

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:24.920
 and this is when Turks used to hold a sword

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:28.440
 to the neck of them and to the Bulgarians and ask them,

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:31.640
 and it was on an angle to ask them, are you a Christian?

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:34.440
 And to say that they were, they had to change it,

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:36.720
 because that was the most efficient way

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:38.800
 to not slice their neck through movement

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:40.560
 of a sword being held tightly, 'cause they said it.

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:41.640
 - They could have just said it.

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:43.960
 (audience laughing)

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:48.480
 - Ah, they could have just said it.

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:51.320
 - Yeah, I didn't, that's why I was told it's not true.

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:52.160
 Okay.

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:55.080
 - But we're saying, right?

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:56.280
 - Oh, yeah, absolutely, yeah.

00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:57.320
 - He was absolutely worth saying.

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:58.160
 - Oh, yeah.

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:01.040
 - The Orient Express was amazing, though,

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:02.800
 even more amazing than that.

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:05.960
 It was amazing because so many great people traveled on it.

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:09.120
 It was, if you were famous or if you were a world leader,

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:10.440
 then you traveled on it.

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:14.120
 So King Leopold used it to transport himself

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:16.240
 to Constantinople, where he'd arranged,

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:17.440
 made some complicated arrangements

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:19.520
 with a harem to infiltrate a harem.

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:21.320
 So he get involved in that.

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:23.760
 The president of France traveled on it at one point.

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:27.000
 This is actually in 1920, and in 1920,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.280
 what happened was there was a guy working the signal box

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:32.600
 and a man-brain per jammer stumbled up to him

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:33.760
 in the middle of the night and said,

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:34.960
 "Hey, please help me.

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:36.240
 I've just fallen off the train.

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:38.040
 I've fallen out of the window and off the train.

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:39.480
 I'm the president of France."

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:42.920
 And the guy in the signal box said,

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:46.680
 and I'm Napoleon Bonaparte, according to those accounts,

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:48.800
 but it was actually the president of France.

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:50.360
 It was Paul Deschanel of France.

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:52.440
 He'd fallen out of the window of the Orient Express,

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:54.480
 and he had to resign very shortly afterwards,

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:55.720
 'cause it was so humiliating.

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.200
 - No.

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:58.600
 - I mean, it was slightly to do that.

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:00.240
 It was also slightly to do the fact

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:02.560
 that he'd recently received the British ambassador

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:06.480
 to France naked, except for the ceremonial decorations

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:10.040
 of his office, and that he'd walked out of a state meeting

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:12.120
 straight into a lake fully clothed.

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:13.280
 (laughing)

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:15.520
 - So it was a few of the circumstances going on there

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:17.000
 as well as the Orient Express thing.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
 - It was the straw that broke the camel's back,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.800
 and it was-- - It was what he told his wife.

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:21.640
 - It was the camel.

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:22.640
 - It's when I fell off the train.

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:23.640
 That's what I did, it.

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:27.720
 - I have some stuff about the luxury trains.

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:31.800
 - So did you know that in the early days of rail,

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.800
 lots of very wealthy people had their own

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:36.280
 private train carriages, and you could just pay

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:39.360
 and have your train carriage kind of put onto a train.

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:40.960
 - Oh, like the Queen has one of those, doesn't she?

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:43.240
 - Well, she's got a whole train, in fact.

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:46.680
 But for example, there were private carriages,

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:47.920
 and there were family carriages,

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:49.000
 which you could just get a carriage

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.360
 for just for you and your family,

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:52.880
 and you would attach it to a train and then change it,

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:55.080
 and at the start of the 20th century,

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:58.520
 Manchester had several gentleman's club carriages,

00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:00.560
 not in the spearment rhino sense guys.

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:03.960
 They would have clubs, you would pay a subscription,

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:06.000
 and then you would get to use that railway carriage,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.320
 and there were lockers, and you had to be elected,

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:10.480
 and you had to obey the rules, specifically the rules

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:12.160
 about whether you could open the window or not,

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:13.560
 and when it was appropriate.

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:14.400
 - Wow.

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:16.200
 - And you had to turn up to the station on time, presumably.

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:19.280
 - You just had access to the train carriage

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:21.800
 if you joined the club, and there was a gentleman's club

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:23.200
 on wheels.

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:24.040
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:25.960
 - Yeah, okay. - Fun.

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:27.440
 Something.

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:29.960
 - Well, you know, it's nice to give James something to edit,

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:30.800
 isn't it?

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:31.800
 (laughing)

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:34.320
 - I think we're giving him too much to edit at this point.

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:35.360
 (laughing)

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:38.400
 - You know, the orange express, the first murder

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:39.960
 that happened on the orange express

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:43.280
 was the year after Agatha Christie published her novel.

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:44.480
 - What's it? - Yeah.

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:47.280
 - Yeah, and also, do you know how the person was caught?

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:48.280
 - No, no, what happened?

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:50.320
 - It's a really cool story, so basically,

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:52.600
 there was a woman who was pushed out of a window,

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:54.640
 so who was killed and then pushed out of a window.

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:56.080
 - There's no cool so far, Ernest.

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:58.120
 (laughing)

00:11:58.120 --> 00:11:59.880
 - It's extremely harrowing.

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:00.800
 - Sorry.

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:02.440
 - I'm so record, too soon.

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:05.360
 (laughing)

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:08.200
 - Sorry, it was 1935, so it is a bit too soon.

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:09.240
 She was pushed out of the window,

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:10.640
 and her body was found on the tracks,

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:14.240
 and all of her possessions, except for a silver fox scarf,

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:16.640
 so a foxkin scarf that she'd been wearing,

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:19.120
 and then by total chance, so this got around

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:20.240
 that the scarf was missing,

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:22.280
 and a policeman in Switzerland,

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:24.720
 a few weeks later, spotted a silver fox scarf

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:26.400
 being worn by a woman, and then went up to her

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:27.560
 and said, "Where's she getting that?"

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:29.000
 And she said, "From this guy,"

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.640
 and it turned out that guy had done the murder.

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:31.640
 - Wow.

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:33.920
 - Sorry, the murderer gave it to me.

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:34.760
 - The murderer.

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:35.600
 - Yeah.

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:37.760
 - I got it from a guy who called himself Mr. Murderer.

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:40.720
 - It's crazy to give away the one bit of evidence

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:43.280
 that links you to a crime, to a random person.

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:44.440
 - It was pretty stupid, wasn't it?

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:45.280
 - It was very stupid.

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:46.440
 - Yeah.

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:48.560
 - So the surrender at the end of World War I

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:50.600
 was signed on the Orritic Express,

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:53.240
 but it was signed in a particular carriage,

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:56.480
 which in 1940 Hitler ordered to be hauled

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:58.600
 to the precise spot where it happened,

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:02.480
 and that's where he organized the terms of the French surrender.

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:03.480
 - He wasn't absolutely dead.

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:05.480
 - He was such a prick.

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:08.800
 - And I was saying, hey, you've just beat him front, okay?

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:09.640
 A great military power.

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:11.520
 You don't need to go on about it.

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:13.960
 Even by Hitler's standards, that's pretty petty, isn't it?

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:14.800
 - It's so petty.

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.120
 And do you know what he did next?

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:17.720
 When he started losing the war,

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:19.440
 he had that drain carriage blown up,

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:21.320
 so they couldn't make him surrender in it again.

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:22.320
 - Oh, what?

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:24.640
 - Hitler, forget the drain carriage.

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:25.640
 - Oh man.

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:27.200
 - God, the more I hear about this guy.

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:30.200
 (audience laughing)

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:33.960
 - We need to move on to our second fact, guys.

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:34.800
 - I just have one tiny thing.

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:35.640
 - Yeah, yeah, go for it.

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:37.360
 - This is about the Queen's private train.

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:38.840
 She's got the royal train.

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:40.440
 And it's actually pretty doubly inside.

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:42.960
 It's not really blingy and Louis XIV-ish.

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:44.880
 It's pretty cool and calm.

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:46.840
 Anyway, there's just one thing that happened in it,

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:47.680
 which I really like.

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:50.240
 So it travels around the country to pick up the royals

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:51.360
 and drop them off and so on.

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:53.600
 And once, it was on its way to pick up Prince Charles

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.000
 for a royal function.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.280
 And it stopped very briefly at a station.

00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:59.680
 But nobody noticed a middle-aged woman

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:01.840
 on the platform to see it and get on.

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:05.200
 And she just sat at one of the tables in the dining car.

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:06.880
 And it is quite well-decorated, not good.

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:08.480
 It's not a standard train.

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:09.720
 And she just sat there and a member of staff

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:10.960
 was walking through and said,

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:12.960
 "You do know this is the Queen's train, don't you?"

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:14.480
 And she said, "No, I did not know that."

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:16.280
 (audience laughing)

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:17.920
 "I'm sorry, when do we get to slow?"

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:20.200
 (audience laughing)

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:21.800
 And she was given some light refreshments

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:23.560
 and then escorted off at the next stop.

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:26.840
 Ah, I shouldn't let her stay.

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:28.040
 And she's out there somewhere,

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:30.360
 but she knows the other side of this story.

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:31.960
 Let's move on to our next fact.

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:34.040
 Okay, it is time for fact number two.

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:35.480
 And that is my fact.

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:37.920
 My fact this week is that the new goalie

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:41.000
 of the ice hockey team, the Belfast Giants,

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.720
 is allergic to ice.

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:45.160
 (audience laughing)

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:46.640
 - It's allergic to ice.

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:47.600
 - Ice, amazing.

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:51.120
 - Yeah, and how do we know he's allergic to ice?

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:54.880
 - He's told us, they noticed when after a match,

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:56.720
 he went into a really cold bath.

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:59.720
 And as he was sitting in the ice cold bath that they have,

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:00.880
 he was breaking out on top.

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:04.280
 And then the breakout, which was sort of raised red lumps,

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:06.200
 got really dark below and they quickly got him out.

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:08.160
 And they said, "You have this disease,

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:12.040
 which is a condition of, you're just allergic

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:15.360
 to cold temperatures, you're highly sensitive to it."

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:19.280
 And so as a result, when he is playing on the ice,

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:21.720
 he can't stay still.

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:23.560
 He has to keep his blood circulating

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:24.720
 and moving around and so on.

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:26.320
 Yeah, so when the game is going on

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:30.560
 on the other side of the ice, what's it?

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:32.640
 Rink, the rink, the rink.

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:36.040
 He's there, sort of just.

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:37.480
 - 'Cause the other side of the ice implies

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:39.440
 a underside of the ice, isn't it?

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:40.880
 - Yeah, yeah, that's okay.

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:43.120
 - So this guy's called Chris Truel

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:44.840
 and he started playing with the Belfast Giant.

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:47.400
 So I believe he's a junior goalie.

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:49.480
 He's, so there's three of them.

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:52.240
 And yeah, so he just constantly has to move around.

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:53.560
 Otherwise-- - He's goalie, that's the thing.

00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:54.960
 So does he sometimes have to move around

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:56.200
 out of the goal mouth?

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:57.120
 - This is the problem.

00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:58.120
 - Yeah.

00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:00.240
 - I mean, I, yeah, I don't know if it is a problem,

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:02.520
 but I assume that that is a problem.

00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:03.360
 Sounds like a problem.

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:04.560
 - Yeah, it does, doesn't it?

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:06.400
 - He's not, he's really cool about it though.

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:07.240
 If you watch an interview,

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:08.080
 he's very much like he's not--

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:08.920
 - But he's not too cool.

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:11.880
 - He's not too cool at all. - He's not too cool at all.

00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:13.560
 - Yeah, it's an allergy to the cold, right?

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:15.320
 It's not, 'cause there's a different allergy,

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:18.280
 which is an allergy to water,

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:20.080
 which is like you can be allergic to your own tears

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:20.920
 and stuff, can't you?

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:24.160
 So every time you cry, you then cry even more.

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:26.160
 But it's not that, it's the coldness of it.

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:27.160
 - Yeah, it's cool.

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:29.320
 So I've been avoid saying the word 'cause I can't,

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:32.120
 I can't pronounce it, but it's erotic carrier.

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:33.280
 That's the, is that a dire pronoun?

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:35.600
 - Yeah, erotic carrier, that's the condition

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:36.440
 that he has.

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:39.040
 - The test for it is very simple.

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:41.280
 The doctor will just hold a piece of ice against you

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:43.920
 and then see if you come out in a red lump.

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:45.880
 - Yeah, I mean, that makes sense, right?

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:48.280
 I'm not saying there's a better test.

00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:50.440
 No, I mean, that literally is the test.

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:52.160
 It's like finding out if you're allergic to bees

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:54.440
 by doctor holding a bee to you and letting it--

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:57.520
 - Is that the test for bee allergies?

00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:59.880
 - It seems like it couldn't be.

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:02.480
 The doctor doesn't say, "Hey, eat a load of these walnuts

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:05.080
 and we'll see what happens." - Well, yeah.

00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:06.080
 - All right, you're fine on those.

00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:07.120
 Let's see if you're allergic to wasps.

00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:08.200
 Sorry, let's bring that up.

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:10.240
 (laughing)

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:11.440
 - Do you know what one way of selling

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:13.280
 if you've gotten allergic reaction is,

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:14.280
 which I'd never heard of?

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:16.320
 Is something called baboon syndrome?

00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:17.320
 - Oh, what's that?

00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:19.480
 - And that's, well, what would you guess?

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:21.360
 What's the defining filter?

00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:24.880
 - You get a big, you get a big bum bum of red.

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:26.040
 - Yeah.

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:27.640
 - Big, got 50 shades of grey again.

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:30.120
 (laughing)

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:33.720
 And he came in with a big bum bum of red.

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:35.520
 (laughing)

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:37.280
 - Yeah, it's having a big red bum

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:39.640
 and it's one of the ways you can exhibit allergic reaction

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:40.880
 is bright red buttocks,

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:43.080
 a particularly penicillin reaction

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:44.560
 or like a nickel reaction.

00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:45.760
 - Specifically to the bum.

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:46.600
 - Specifically to the bum.

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:48.400
 - And you can just have eaten some penicillin

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:49.600
 and then your bum goes red.

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:50.440
 - Yeah.

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:51.520
 - It's amazing.

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:52.360
 - It's amazing.

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:53.720
 - The boon syndrome, yeah.

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:56.120
 - Over another ironic sports allergy.

00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:56.960
 - Oh, yeah.

00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:57.800
 - There's a jocky.

00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:58.960
 A very young jocky called Sean Bowen.

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:01.000
 He raced in the Grand National a couple of years ago.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.600
 As a child, he was allergic to horses.

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:04.680
 And he grew up, he would get eczema.

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:06.560
 Any time he went near a horse,

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:07.440
 but then he grew out of it

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:09.920
 and then he would practice by sitting on a sofa

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:10.800
 and whipping it.

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:12.880
 (laughing)

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:15.080
 - He would sit on the arm of the sofa and thrash it.

00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:16.320
 - Ah, that's so funny.

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:18.240
 - Do you know who else was allergic to horses?

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:19.240
 Clint Eastwood.

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:20.080
 - No.

00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:21.240
 - No way.

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:23.080
 - All his movies, he had stunt doubles

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:24.640
 and he would do it but he would break out

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:26.320
 if he was on a horse for too long.

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:28.400
 But yeah, Clint Eastwood allergic to horses.

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:30.440
 - That's why he looks so pissed off all the time.

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:31.760
 (laughing)

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:33.440
 - Hannah, before you were saying about the person

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:36.000
 who was allergic to the wrong tears,

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.160
 there was a woman who was allergic to the allergy medicine

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:41.400
 she took to deal with her allergies.

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:42.240
 (laughing)

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:43.240
 - Oh man.

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:46.520
 - So basically, she got ill with some other allergy

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:48.920
 and then she took an anti-histamine called Benadryl

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:51.640
 and then that caused her shortness of breath, wheezing

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:53.080
 and she went to hospital

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:54.320
 and then when she was in hospital,

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:56.040
 they gave her more Benadryl.

00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:56.880
 (laughing)

00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:57.720
 - Oh God.

00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:58.560
 - God.

00:18:58.560 --> 00:18:59.400
 - Oh my God.

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:03.320
 - That Harrison Schmidt, Apollo astronaut Harrison Schmidt,

00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:05.440
 one of the only people to land on the moon,

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:07.040
 was allergic to the moon.

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:07.880
 - Oh yeah.

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:08.720
 - Can you believe that though?

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:09.560
 He was allergic to the moon.

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:10.560
 So you might think that's really weird

00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:13.080
 because you're in a suit when you get onto the moon.

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:16.560
 It was when he got back off the moon into the capsule

00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:17.560
 and they took the suit off

00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:21.960
 and supposedly the smellers of like gunpowder sort of smell.

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:23.560
 That is what gave him the allergies

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:26.200
 and he broke out as well in sort of, in hype.

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:28.920
 So one of the only, and there's only 12 people

00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:29.760
 who have landed on the moon

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:32.480
 and one of them was allergic to the moon.

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:33.480
 - That's amazing.

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:34.600
 - That's pretty huge, right?

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:36.160
 And there's no way of testing before you go.

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:37.160
 - How do you test?

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:38.520
 - How do you test?

00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:42.120
 - Tennis player, Layton Hewitt, allergic to grass

00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:45.560
 as in the floor of the windowed in courts.

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:46.800
 Yeah, not weed.

00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:49.240
 - You know horses can be allergic to grass.

00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:50.160
 - Horses can be allergic to grass.

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:51.840
 - Yeah, yeah, horses get allergic to grass

00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:54.040
 and they have to, it's really sad.

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:55.800
 So there's a woman who's got a horse

00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:56.640
 and you have to cover them

00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:59.920
 and this big anti-allergy sock from head to toe.

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:03.200
 And they get allergic to, you get allergies to grass

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:07.800
 and hay and seeds, all the nuts and seeds that they get fed.

00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:10.240
 - It's amazing that you can describe a murder

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:13.400
 as pretty cool, but a horse wearing a giant sock

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:14.880
 is somehow really sad.

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:15.720
 - I know.

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:18.840
 - It's because they get weepy.

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:20.280
 They genuinely get weepy.

00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:23.960
 They cry tears and they get itchy and they get sneezy.

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:26.680
 - Which of the other dwarfs do they get?

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:28.720
 (laughing)

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:34.240
 - The cure for it is to rub on some doc.

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:35.320
 (laughing)

00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:36.160
 - There we go.

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:39.000
 - That's good. - That's good.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.920
 - So if you're hypersensitive of the whole of just everything,

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:44.440
 like electricity and stuff,

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:46.640
 you can go to a town in America.

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:49.320
 It's in Arizona, it's called Snowflake.

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:50.480
 - No. - Okay.

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:52.800
 And it doesn't get its name because it's full of snowflakes,

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:54.640
 like moaning millennial, so whatever.

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:57.080
 It gets its name because it was founded by two people

00:20:57.080 --> 00:21:00.600
 called Araster Snow and William Jordan Flake.

00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:02.600
 - No way.

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:04.040
 (laughing)

00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:04.880
 - What?

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:05.720
 - That's incredible.

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:06.560
 - Isn't that amazing?

00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:08.840
 - But do you think they thought we'd better found something now

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:09.720
 because we've met?

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:10.880
 - What do you think Flake Snow?

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:11.720
 - Yeah.

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:13.560
 (laughing)

00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:17.080
 - Wait, so they founded a town for people to escape their allergies?

00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:19.480
 - No, they founded a town they were Mormon pioneers,

00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:22.200
 but they founded it well away from cities and stuff like that.

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:25.120
 So if you're allergic to wifi and all you think you are

00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:26.480
 and electricity and stuff like that,

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:28.640
 then this is a place where you can go and be away from that.

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:29.480
 - Where did you say it was?

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:30.320
 - It's in Arizona.

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:31.160
 - Arizona.

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:32.240
 - Oh, yeah, really remote.

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:33.080
 - Some of it is.

00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:33.920
 - Yeah.

00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:34.760
 - Phoenix.

00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:35.600
 - Phoenix.

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:37.680
 - When was that, was that 19th century originally?

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:41.560
 - Well, it was founded in 1878 where people are going there now.

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:44.760
 - But this was a real thing when allergies came into the world.

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:46.960
 Hey, we don't know how they appeared in the world.

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:48.360
 It was in the 19th century.

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:50.400
 And then beat it became a really fashionable thing

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:51.840
 because it was the wealthier classes

00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:53.360
 that were allergic to stuff, wasn't it?

00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:56.320
 And so they began to be hay fever holidays

00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:57.880
 that were recommended.

00:21:57.880 --> 00:21:59.640
 And that would be if you lived in New York,

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:01.680
 the idea was that you were getting allergic reactions

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:03.080
 to the city like you say.

00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:06.640
 So Lake Superior and the White Mountain, New Hampshire,

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:08.800
 they would all advertise like hay fever holidays

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:12.440
 or allergy escapes, which is a way to get away from your allergies.

00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:15.280
 It was a very fashionable thing to have.

00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:16.240
 - Yeah, it's very cool.

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:18.040
 - Anything about hockey, that ice hockey?

00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:18.880
 - Yeah, sure, yeah.

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:20.720
 - So this sounds quite cool.

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:23.080
 Underwater ice hockey.

00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:23.920
 - Wow.

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:27.360
 - Okay, it's played upside down underneath frozen pools.

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:28.200
 - No.

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:30.280
 - So that is the other side of the ice

00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:31.880
 that I was talking about.

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:32.720
 - Wow.

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:35.080
 - And they use a wooden puck, so it floats.

00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:37.120
 And basically you can only stay under,

00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:38.520
 they don't use breathing apparatus.

00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:40.640
 So you can only stay underwater for 30 seconds

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:42.840
 and then you go back up and then you go back down again.

00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:44.560
 And it's next goal wins.

00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:47.360
 So it's only one goal, two of the scars first wins.

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:48.760
 - Wow.

00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:50.680
 - They're not wearing all the hockey stuff, are they?

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:51.880
 - Well, they have a stick.

00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:54.360
 - They have a stick, but are they in trunks and with a stick?

00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:55.520
 - Trunks and stick.

00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:57.120
 - That is amazing.

00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:57.960
 - Yep.

00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:00.640
 Don't confuse it with underwater hockey.

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:03.560
 Underwater hockey is on the floor of a swimming pool

00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:04.960
 with a sinking puck.

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:06.520
 So you have a really heavy sinking puck.

00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:07.880
 It's on the bottom and you're playing it

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:09.200
 along the bottom of a swimming pool.

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:11.520
 - But how can you hit something underwater

00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:12.880
 and have momentum?

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:14.800
 - Yes, momentum still works on the water.

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:15.800
 (laughing)

00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:17.960
 I mean, the laws of physics still work on the water.

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:20.240
 But you are right that it's more viscous

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:21.440
 so it would be more difficult.

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:22.440
 - It would be really hard, right?

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:23.520
 - Yeah, you would hit it, and it would.

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:24.360
 - It's harder.

00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:25.600
 - The whole thing sounds harder.

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:27.600
 (laughing)

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:29.520
 - Almost everything is harder underwater.

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:30.680
 (laughing)

00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:33.440
 - Swimming's not swimming is one of the very few exceptions

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:34.440
 to this rule then.

00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:35.800
 (laughing)

00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:37.600
 But mostly you have a fri and egg underwater.

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:38.440
 It's a nightmare.

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:39.920
 (laughing)

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:40.760
 - That's true.

00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:42.000
 - It's not coaching an egg and the egg.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:42.840
 - Just a break.

00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:44.120
 (laughing)

00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:44.960
 - More to it.

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:47.560
 (clapping)

00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:49.720
 - No, ice hockey.

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:50.560
 - Yeah, I go on.

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:53.040
 - Yeah, I became obsessed with the fights in ice hockey.

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:53.880
 - Oh yes.

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:55.160
 - Oh my goodness, there are so many fights.

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:56.000
 - Oh yeah.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.920
 - And I didn't know anything about ice hockey

00:23:57.920 --> 00:23:59.840
 and I think you watched it a lot.

00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:00.680
 - I watched it a lot.

00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:02.000
 - You watched it a lot, yeah.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.520
 But I didn't know that they were regulated

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:07.960
 as fisticuffs in the rule book of ice hockey.

00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:11.000
 And you know, there are lots of unwritten rules as well.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.040
 So you have to agree to a fight

00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:14.800
 and you can't hit someone with your stick.

00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:17.520
 - Yeah, I mean they still do, but you're not supposed to.

00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:19.000
 But you would have one player on your team

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.720
 who's kind of the guy who does the fighting.

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:23.840
 - And how does, is he only allowed to fight

00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:25.600
 the other team's fighter guy?

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:26.960
 Or could he fight the other guy?

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:28.480
 - They're the guys who kind of start it

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:30.080
 and then everyone gets in on the act.

00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:30.920
 - Okay.

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:32.440
 - But they're called the enforcer basically

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:35.520
 and you would have, say the other team is doing really well

00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:37.800
 and you kind of wanna stop them in their tracks a little bit

00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:39.920
 then you might start a fight to try and put them off

00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:42.000
 and then you might carry on.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.040
 - But it's Andy, have you seen it?

00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:44.880
 - I've seen it, yeah.

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:45.720
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:50.160
 It's actively, not officially, but it's actively encouraged

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:51.960
 by the crowd and it's part of the game.

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:53.400
 Yeah, so they throw their gloves off,

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:56.160
 they take their helmet off, they go around each other

00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:57.240
 with their fists like that

00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:59.880
 and then they absolutely wallop each other

00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:01.640
 and it's part of the tradition.

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:03.880
 It happened in fact in the first game ever,

00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:05.360
 first ever ice hockey game.

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:08.440
 - It was, it was not between the hockey players.

00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:10.440
 It was between the ice hockey players

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:12.480
 and the ice skaters who were pissed off

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:14.800
 that they'd taken their ring to,

00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:17.120
 and it was after the match so it didn't get reported

00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:21.000
 but there was a fight in the very first ever ice hockey match.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.960
 - Sometimes it goes a little bit too far.

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:26.680
 I read about one Russian game between Avangard and Vityaz.

00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:30.160
 The fighting in that game started after three minutes.

00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:32.400
 Actually, it was three minutes 27

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:34.240
 when a Brawl take place between basically

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:36.640
 all the players on both teams.

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:37.480
 - Wow.

00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:39.200
 - Okay, a few of the players were sent to the synbin

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:40.840
 and then they started the game again

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:43.800
 of three seconds later, another fight started.

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:47.440
 And then eight more players were sent off.

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:48.760
 And then the game started again

00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:52.080
 and then two seconds later, there was a third fight.

00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:54.320
 And then at that stage so many people had been sent off

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:55.600
 that they couldn't carry on the game

00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:56.960
 so they just abandoned it.

00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:57.960
 - Oh my God.

00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:01.080
 - And both teams were given a five-nil defeat.

00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:02.880
 Teams lost five-nil.

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:03.720
 - How'd you do, darling?

00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:05.280
 Well, we lost but some of the other guys.

00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:08.880
 - Hey, we need to move on to our next fact very shortly.

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:10.280
 Should I move us on now?

00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:11.120
 - Yes, we should.

00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:11.960
 - Ready to go, yeah.

00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:14.520
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:16.880
 and that is Andrew Hunter Murray.

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:19.360
 - My fact is that after every festival,

00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:22.160
 the founder of Glastonbury has to drive around his farm

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:24.440
 with a giant magnet.

00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:25.720
 And the reason he has to do that

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:27.560
 is that there are tent pegs left

00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:29.920
 across his entire farm in the ground

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:31.040
 and he can't see them.

00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:33.240
 So there's a specially customized tractor

00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:35.840
 with a giant magnet strapped onto the front of it.

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:36.680
 - Wow.

00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:37.520
 - So cool.

00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:38.600
 - Which he drives around, it weighs over a ton.

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:40.000
 I think he has someone to do it for him

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.320
 because he's quite old now, Michael Davis.

00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:42.680
 - But what do you reckon it weighs

00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:44.680
 after he's done doing it?

00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:48.280
 - I guess 100 or 150 tons.

00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:50.320
 - Wow, I don't, I don't, I don't.

00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:53.560
 (audience laughing)

00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:54.600
 - That's crazy.

00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:56.120
 - I know, it's nuts, isn't it?

00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:58.840
 - Why do you have the actual answer down?

00:26:58.840 --> 00:26:59.840
 - No, I just curious, I hear.

00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:00.840
 - No, okay.

00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:03.000
 - Because you're adding metal to metal

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.240
 and then that adds up.

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:05.600
 - Yeah, no, it does, is you?

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:07.040
 - You're not wrong.

00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:08.320
 - Yeah.

00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:10.320
 - It's true, but I reckon if these guys hadn't laughed,

00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:12.520
 you'd have taken 150 tons because I'm not sure

00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:13.520
 you know what a ton is.

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:14.680
 - I was telling all the answers.

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:15.680
 - That's not the answer, I was teasing.

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:16.520
 - That's not the answer, I don't know.

00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:17.360
 - Okay.

00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:18.880
 (audience laughing)

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:20.400
 - But something in that region?

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:21.240
 - Yeah.

00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:22.800
 - No, no, no, no, no, no.

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:24.560
 - Now we're in that region, okay.

00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:26.040
 - I don't know, I'm afraid.

00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:27.960
 - But there are thousands of thousands of tents,

00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:29.400
 which get abandoned, you know.

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:30.320
 - And they need to pick them up

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:32.360
 because in the past cows have been grazing

00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:35.560
 on these tent pegs and it can injure them quite badly.

00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:36.400
 - Yeah.

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:39.080
 - Yeah, well they, yeah, they choke for cows.

00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:40.720
 'Cause he's got a very successful dairy.

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:42.280
 I didn't quite realize that Michael Evers

00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:45.520
 is one of the most successful dairy farmers in the area.

00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:47.600
 So the guy who founded it, yeah.

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:48.960
 And that's why it's so quite famously,

00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:50.880
 I think at the first Glastonbury ever,

00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:53.920
 you got free pint of milk, I think.

00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:55.720
 - It was one pound to get in, wasn't it?

00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:57.880
 One pound to get in, you got a free bottle of milk.

00:27:57.880 --> 00:27:58.720
 - Yeah, really?

00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:00.320
 - And then at the most recent Glastonbury,

00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:02.640
 you could see pole dancing robots,

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:04.480
 make a cucumber trumpet,

00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:07.520
 and jump off a trolley ship shaped like a fish.

00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:08.360
 (audience laughing)

00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:09.440
 - It's lost its way, hasn't it?

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:11.760
 Lost its way, no free milk.

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:12.880
 Do you get free milk still?

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:13.720
 - No mate.

00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:14.560
 - Bloody hell.

00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:17.000
 - He does, he's a judge of cheese competitions though.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.160
 - At the festival.

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:19.640
 - At the festival.

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:20.880
 Not at the festival, no, no.

00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:22.720
 - I've completely misunderstood what the festival is like,

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:24.160
 I think, I've never been.

00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:27.320
 The very first one, it was in 1970

00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:29.920
 and it was called Worthy Farm Pop Festival.

00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:33.200
 And the bee had a great article about the first Glastonbury

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:34.800
 and they put up one of the flyers for it

00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:37.160
 and the flyers, it was so sweet, they said,

00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:40.560
 the acts will include the kinks, Wayne Fontana,

00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:43.200
 and at least six other groups.

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:44.040
 (audience laughing)

00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:47.000
 And in the event, neither the kinks nor Wayne Fontana turned up.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:48.840
 (audience laughing)

00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:49.680
 - Wow, wow.

00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:50.960
 - The six others turned up.

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:53.160
 - Well T-Rex turned up to replace their blinders.

00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:54.400
 So, yeah, pretty good.

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:57.880
 - Oh yeah, and that's famously where T-Rex exploded

00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:01.960
 into the popular consciousness of the British public.

00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:02.800
 - Yeah.

00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:05.280
 - I'd memorize that sentence from the article that I read.

00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:07.000
 (audience laughing)

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:08.280
 So, what year was that?

00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:09.120
 - 1970.

00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:10.960
 - 1970, right, God.

00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:11.960
 So, he's been going for it.

00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:13.200
 He's quite old now, Michael.

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:15.200
 Yeah, he's eighties.

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:16.640
 - Yeah, he's very cool though.

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:18.840
 So, everyone probably watched Glastonbury this year

00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:22.800
 and he, Jeremy Corbyn was there and got up on stage.

00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:27.080
 So, Jeremy Corbyn is a parliamentary beard of the year winner

00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:30.040
 and actually, Michael Evers, if you can picture him,

00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:32.080
 has a very impressive beard himself.

00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:34.920
 And he went up on stage with Jeremy Corbyn.

00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:37.280
 Jeremy Corbyn gave him the Labour Manifesto.

00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:39.080
 And as that was being handed over,

00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:41.240
 there were just two beard legends on stage

00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:45.600
 because Michael Evers won beard of the decade in 2009.

00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:46.440
 - Wow.

00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:47.280
 - In the world.

00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:49.800
 So, he beat Fidel Castro to the top spot.

00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:50.640
 - You're kidding.

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:51.480
 - Yeah.

00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:53.160
 - You know, there's a secret underground piano bar

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:54.560
 at Glastonbury, what?

00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:56.480
 - Yeah, and a reporter from the beab

00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:59.360
 went looking for it as a recent festival

00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:03.440
 and he reported back that there is no piano that I can see.

00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:05.280
 The bar does not turn out to sell alcohol

00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:07.360
 and most of it is not underground.

00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:10.560
 (audience laughing)

00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:12.520
 - And also not a secret now, it's been a moment.

00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:14.720
 - That was not a secret either, though.

00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:15.920
 - He's against alcohol.

00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:17.760
 Well, he's not a drinker, is he?

00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:19.720
 The Glastonbury founder, Michael Evers.

00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:21.440
 No, and he's never taken any drugs.

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:22.920
 He's anti-smoking.

00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:24.640
 He's a real methodist.

00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:27.680
 It's, I can't tell if it's a disappointment or really nice.

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:30.560
 But, yeah, and he always wears shorts.

00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:31.680
 This is the thing he's famous for.

00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:34.400
 He always wears shorts, whatever time of year it is.

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:36.320
 And do you know why he does that?

00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:39.960
 - He likes to keep his legs cool.

00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:42.560
 - That makes a lot of sense, actually.

00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:45.760
 - He's got lovely calf muscles.

00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:47.120
 - Yes, it's that.

00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:48.640
 It is that he...

00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:49.480
 - What?

00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:54.360
 - He was like, he's a very famous kind of, you know,

00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:55.680
 liberal hippie campaigner.

00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:58.140
 And he was an anti-thatcher march in the early,

00:30:58.140 --> 00:31:03.260
 a touchy years, and he said, his GP's wife was walking behind me.

00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:05.060
 And she said, do you know, Michael,

00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:07.060
 you've got the most amazing legs.

00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:08.700
 And no one had ever said that to me before.

00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:10.580
 And so I've worn shorts ever since.

00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:12.340
 (laughing)

00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:14.540
 - I love the idea that maybe it affects everyone.

00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:16.220
 So when he meets all the bands,

00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:18.220
 Coldplay will come up to him, like, hi, but...

00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:19.380
 Oh my goodness.

00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:20.780
 (laughing)

00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:23.220
 What are the flowers?

00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:24.980
 Just everyone's...

00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:27.460
 - Yeah, Stanley, yeah, nice.

00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:30.340
 - Some other cool festivals from the world.

00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:33.140
 The untold festival took place in Transylvania,

00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:35.820
 and you could pay with your blood.

00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:36.980
 - Whoa!

00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:37.820
 - Yeah.

00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:39.940
 If you signed up to become a blood donor,

00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:41.180
 you got a discount.

00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:44.220
 And if you showed up in person at a centre nearby,

00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:47.060
 then you would get a free one day ticket on the spot.

00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:47.900
 - Wow.

00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:51.140
 - But wouldn't you be a bit tired to enjoy the festival?

00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:53.300
 Yeah, it doesn't, it tires you out, doesn't it?

00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:56.580
 - No, I mean, I mean, you can still hear music.

00:31:56.580 --> 00:31:58.580
 (laughing)

00:31:58.580 --> 00:32:02.300
 - Yeah, it's not too bad, a problem.

00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:03.780
 I got one, James, I really like.

00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:08.420
 This is from last year, it was the Newfoundland Lobster Festival.

00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:10.820
 Yeah, and what I like about it is that,

00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:14.780
 due to a mess up of transporting the Lobsters to the festival,

00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:17.220
 they didn't have any Lobsters at the festival.

00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:19.420
 And so instead, everyone had to eat hot dogs.

00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:21.700
 (laughing)

00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:24.300
 It was on an airplane, and the airplane went to the wrong destination,

00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:26.980
 or they put it onto the wrong carrier.

00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:28.740
 Yeah, so you've got delivered to a whole different place,

00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:30.220
 and they're like, we're waiting for the Lobsters.

00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:33.580
 - Why, if they have to get the Lobsters over by-played,

00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:35.260
 why are they having a Lobster Festival?

00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:36.100
 - It's a very good party.

00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:38.420
 - No, I'm not sure, because maybe they got it

00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:41.420
 from a great Lobster place like Florida or something like that.

00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:43.020
 - Then have the festival in Florida.

00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:45.860
 - No, but they live in Newfoundland, they can't just read.

00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:47.300
 - They don't have the festival, like?

00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:50.700
 - No, but they want to, I don't have a Caribbean festival

00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:52.340
 in South London to buy.

00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:55.060
 - Yeah, but you could, because that's what people do.

00:32:55.060 --> 00:32:56.780
 - But why would I fly in three tons of sand?

00:32:56.780 --> 00:32:58.300
 It doesn't make any sense to them.

00:32:58.300 --> 00:32:59.140
 (laughing)

00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:01.020
 - I'd just have a South London festival.

00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:03.980
 - Okay, that's true, but where did the Lobsters end up?

00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:04.820
 Do we know?

00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:06.980
 - No, I just a different place, and then the problem is,

00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:08.860
 is by the time they got there, this was the complaint,

00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:10.620
 they said some of the Lobsters had died,

00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:13.220
 which is what I thought you'd want when you were about to eat one,

00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:14.740
 so that shouldn't be a problem.

00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:16.820
 Do you want, oh, you want them alive right after the...

00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:18.940
 - Well, you keep them alive in your bath, don't you?

00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:20.700
 If you buy a Lobster to eat, then it...

00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:21.900
 - Yeah, that's one of the other things

00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:24.540
 it's easier to do underwater is keep a Lobster alive.

00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:26.060
 (laughing)

00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:27.140
 So it's three now.

00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:33.220
 - You were just saying about transporting these Lobsters.

00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:34.060
 - Yeah.

00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:37.700
 - And there was a mud festival in New Zealand called Mudtopia,

00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:41.900
 and they transported five tons of mud from South Korea.

00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:44.100
 - Wow.

00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:46.740
 - Those mud salesmen must have thought all their Christmases

00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:47.580
 have come up once.

00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:49.900
 I've had another year of no orders,

00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:53.420
 I guess it's time to shut down the mud export business.

00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:55.100
 - Dreaming, dreaming, hello.

00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:56.460
 - It's New Zealand.

00:33:56.460 --> 00:33:58.860
 We'd like five tons of mud, five tons.

00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:00.860
 We've only got four tons.

00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:02.580
 We're back to going out of business.

00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:05.100
 (laughing)

00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:05.940
 - Don't, that's true.

00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:07.860
 And basically, I mean, just to finish it,

00:34:07.860 --> 00:34:10.380
 they needed this mud for the mud festival,

00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:13.020
 and they said the local councillor said,

00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:16.540
 "I know there's a perception that we have enough mud ourselves,

00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:18.780
 but you can't just pull any old mud out of the ground

00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:20.420
 and throw it at people."

00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:21.580
 There could be anything in there

00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:23.660
 that might end up making people sick.

00:34:23.660 --> 00:34:25.580
 So basically, the South Korean stuff

00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:28.100
 had had some kind of stuff done to it stop it,

00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:29.260
 making people sick.

00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:30.100
 - It's clean mud.

00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:30.940
 - Clean mud?

00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:31.780
 - Wow.

00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:33.140
 - Which is amazing to yourself, isn't it?

00:34:33.140 --> 00:34:33.980
 - Yeah.

00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:36.500
 - Do you know that at the Redding and Leeds festivals

00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:38.460
 this year, I don't know if anyone went,

00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:41.220
 but there was pineapples were banned.

00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:45.060
 So there's a list of banned stuff on,

00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:47.260
 you know, that you're not allowed to take in submachine guns

00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:49.260
 or bombs or anything.

00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:51.740
 And then pineapples was added to the list.

00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:53.300
 And that's because of this ban that I've never heard of,

00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:55.620
 probably everyone else has called glass animals.

00:34:55.620 --> 00:34:57.140
 But yeah, they've just got a lyric in their song,

00:34:57.140 --> 00:34:58.460
 which says pineapples are in my head.

00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:00.260
 And so whenever they have a gig,

00:35:00.260 --> 00:35:02.820
 everyone who comes to the gig apparently brings pineapples

00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:04.420
 and they can cause a lot of damage.

00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:06.340
 And so they have to put on the ban list.

00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:07.580
 - What damage?

00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:08.420
 - What damage can you get?

00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:11.500
 - They're spiky, they're really super spiky.

00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:14.340
 - They're really, yeah, they're really spiky.

00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:18.740
 - Yeah. - Yeah, no, I didn't think about it that way

00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:19.580
 when you said it, Jane.

00:35:19.580 --> 00:35:22.420
 So when Dan back you up, fair play.

00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:26.740
 - They're spiky.

00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:29.420
 Okay, maybe in future shows we can get everyone

00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:31.260
 on the front row to throw pineapples at you.

00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:32.780
 How would you like that?

00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:33.780
 - Yeah, it's fair.

00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:36.380
 - You've only ever seen them in those chopped up cubes

00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:37.820
 in marks and spenters, haven't you?

00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:41.380
 - I'm normally being presented them at an ambassador's dinner

00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:42.380
 in the '70s.

00:35:44.060 --> 00:35:46.140
 - Did you guys do anything on magnets at all?

00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:47.220
 - No. - Yeah.

00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:48.940
 - Yeah, come on, let's do some foreign bed.

00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:52.100
 - Just quickly, have you guys heard of a thing

00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:54.140
 called the Iron Harvest?

00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:55.660
 Because I've never heard of this.

00:35:55.660 --> 00:35:58.460
 This is a thing that happens every year in Belgium and France

00:35:58.460 --> 00:36:02.580
 and it's a harvest, literally, of iron from the First World War.

00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:04.380
 And it's still turning up in farmer's fields

00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:05.580
 across Belgium and France.

00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:06.420
 - Wow.

00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:08.420
 - So during the First World War,

00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:10.740
 for every square meter of territory on the Western front,

00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:13.180
 a ton of explosives was fired.

00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:14.620
 Every square meter.

00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:15.860
 So it normally turns out--

00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:17.300
 - That's a lot done, by the way.

00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:18.300
 - Yeah.

00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:19.300
 (audience laughing)

00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:20.620
 - That doesn't sound a lot.

00:36:20.620 --> 00:36:24.780
 And so in spring and autumn is when the farmer's plow

00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:27.660
 their fields and that's when the ground slowly turns it up.

00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:29.300
 And the French mine clearing department

00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:33.300
 gets sent about 900 tons of unexploded bombs every year.

00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:34.140
 - Wow.

00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:37.020
 - A few years ago, just around EEPRA itself,

00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:40.420
 just around EEPRA, they got 160 tons of metal,

00:36:40.420 --> 00:36:42.900
 which is not to fill five large lorries.

00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:44.100
 All First World War stuff.

00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:44.940
 - Wow.

00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:45.780
 - Yeah.

00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:46.620
 - That's crazy.

00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:48.140
 - Do you know something they use magnets for?

00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:51.060
 In the 1930s and early 20th century,

00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:52.420
 that's quite cool.

00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:53.700
 - Okay, a health thing?

00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:54.940
 - It is a health thing.

00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:56.740
 It's for eye problems.

00:36:56.740 --> 00:37:00.220
 So I read this on Boeing Boeing, I think,

00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:02.340
 which sounds not like a legit website.

00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:03.340
 - It's real loud.

00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:04.340
 - Boeing Boeing is brilliant.

00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:05.180
 - Boeing Boeing is great.

00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:06.020
 It's just the way you said it.

00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:07.740
 It sounded like a weird toy.

00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:09.540
 I read it on Boeing Boeing.

00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:11.140
 (audience laughing)

00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:12.940
 - So what kind of eye problems might you have?

00:37:12.940 --> 00:37:14.460
 - So you'd have stuff caught in your eyes.

00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:16.620
 So people used to get eye and filings caught in their eyes

00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:20.020
 when they worked in industrial, you know, in factories and stuff.

00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:23.100
 And there was invented in Minneapolis,

00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:25.580
 this piece of equipment that weighed 800 pounds.

00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:29.060
 So that is the way of, I think, about five full grown women.

00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:30.860
 And it was a magnet.

00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:32.580
 It had the pull of 10 horsepower.

00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:35.020
 It involved 7,000 feet of wire.

00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:36.780
 And it came towards your eye.

00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:38.940
 And you had a tiny bit of metal stuck in the back of it.

00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:40.620
 And then it sucked the metal out.

00:37:40.620 --> 00:37:41.460
 - Whoa.

00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:43.660
 - But surely it would suck it out.

00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:44.940
 - Through your eye.

00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:46.460
 - I would have thought as well.

00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:49.580
 I've only seen the advertisements in the British newspaper archive.

00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:51.180
 - I think if you got something in your eye,

00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:53.620
 it's not gonna be directly behind your eyeball, probably.

00:37:53.620 --> 00:37:54.460
 - Oh yeah.

00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:55.300
 - It's just not.

00:37:55.300 --> 00:37:56.140
 - I wouldn't risk.

00:37:56.140 --> 00:37:57.700
 It could come out through the lid.

00:37:57.700 --> 00:37:59.020
 I don't know.

00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:00.620
 10 horsepower is more than you need

00:38:00.620 --> 00:38:03.060
 to suck a tiny bit of metal out of your eye.

00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:03.900
 - 10 horsepower.

00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:05.300
 - You would think one horse could do that.

00:38:05.300 --> 00:38:07.300
 (audience laughing)

00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:09.860
 Hey, we need to move on to our final fact of the show.

00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:12.500
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show.

00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:14.780
 And that is Chuzinski.

00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:18.180
 - My fact this week is that during World War II,

00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:21.540
 the owners of Foils bookshop protected the store

00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:26.300
 from Nazi bombs by covering the roof in copies of Mein Kampf.

00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:28.380
 (audience laughing)

00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:29.500
 - It's so good.

00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:30.900
 - It's so nice.

00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:31.740
 - Yeah.

00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:34.100
 - This one's got that nice, is it?

00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:35.260
 - Nice is the wrong word.

00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:36.100
 - Yeah.

00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:37.260
 - But it was fitting.

00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:40.060
 So this is William Foil who set up foils.

00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:43.340
 And so at World War II, he filled sandbags

00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:45.020
 with all these old books.

00:38:45.020 --> 00:38:47.540
 And in order to kind of bolster the shop

00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:49.900
 against the bombs during the blitz in London.

00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:52.100
 And he said that he was covering the roof

00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:53.340
 with copies of Mein Kampf.

00:38:53.340 --> 00:38:55.220
 And newsreels at the time said,

00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:58.180
 "Foils of London is stacked with copies of Mein Kampf

00:38:58.180 --> 00:39:00.260
 in the place of sandbags."

00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:01.740
 - Yeah, that's what it is.

00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:02.580
 - That's what it is.

00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:05.340
 - Just for context, for overseas listeners,

00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:07.980
 we make this podcast, usually in Covenant Garden,

00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:11.140
 which is in Soho-ish area.

00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:14.100
 On Charing Cross Road is Foils Bookshop,

00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:17.660
 which is a 15 minute walk from where we work.

00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:20.900
 And it's one of the most iconic bookshops in London.

00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:22.740
 It's an independent bookshop.

00:39:22.740 --> 00:39:24.860
 And it was known for its eccentricities.

00:39:24.860 --> 00:39:26.860
 And it's been going for a very long time.

00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:30.060
 And it's still one of the iconic bookshops of London.

00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:30.900
 - Yeah.

00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:32.620
 - A Mein Kampf was a book by Hitler.

00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:34.420
 (audience laughing)

00:39:34.420 --> 00:39:35.900
 - It's one of the iconic bookshops.

00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:38.100
 (audience laughing)

00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:39.300
 Oh, what's he done now?

00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:40.300
 Is there more?

00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:43.420
 - It's not even the only time that the foils

00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:44.860
 had a run in with the Nazis.

00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:47.940
 So in fact, earlier than that, Christina Foil,

00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:50.660
 who was the daughter of William the founder,

00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:53.260
 when the Nazis held their book "Burnings",

00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:54.980
 she wrote to Adolf Hitler saying,

00:39:54.980 --> 00:39:57.660
 "We'll give you a good price, we'll buy them, don't burn them."

00:39:57.660 --> 00:39:58.500
 Which is good.

00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:02.860
 And then the reply was negative but respectful, apparently.

00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:03.700
 - Yeah.

00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:06.700
 - And then in 1939, Christina also invited Hitler,

00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:10.420
 Mussolini, and Stalin, to speak at one of her literary lunches.

00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:11.260
 - Wow.

00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:12.460
 - So they used to have these lunches with incredible figures

00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:13.740
 from the world of literature.

00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:15.260
 And she invited all three.

00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:16.100
 - Wow.

00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:18.940
 - Hitler replied that he had urgent business in Germany.

00:40:18.940 --> 00:40:20.300
 Mussolini and Poland.

00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:23.300
 (audience laughing)

00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:28.820
 - Mussolini said that he might visit

00:40:28.820 --> 00:40:30.580
 when things quiet him down a bit.

00:40:30.580 --> 00:40:33.660
 (audience laughing)

00:40:33.660 --> 00:40:36.340
 - Stalin didn't reply, didn't he?

00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:37.180
 - Rude.

00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:39.020
 - Okay.

00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:42.140
 - She was a character, actually.

00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:44.700
 And not in a massively positive sense, maybe.

00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:49.260
 So Foil has been through some tough times,

00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:50.300
 partly because of her.

00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:52.660
 So she wasn't really a fan of her,

00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:54.260
 the people who worked in her bookshop.

00:40:54.260 --> 00:40:56.540
 So she used to summarily sack them

00:40:56.540 --> 00:40:58.460
 before they'd worked for six months

00:40:58.460 --> 00:40:59.700
 because after six months,

00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:01.420
 you're entitled to better employment rights.

00:41:01.420 --> 00:41:02.460
 So if you work for foils,

00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:04.060
 then you get sacked up to six months.

00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:06.540
 And this meant that you got quite not very good staff,

00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:08.180
 and you got not very dedicated staff,

00:41:08.180 --> 00:41:09.940
 and there was a story of someone

00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:13.580
 who came in in the '60s or '70s and asked for Ulysses,

00:41:13.580 --> 00:41:15.340
 and the person at the till replied

00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:16.900
 that Ulysses had gone out to lunch,

00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:18.820
 but would serve them as soon as possible.

00:41:18.820 --> 00:41:20.060
 - All right, nice.

00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:23.540
 They have changed that policy now, by the way.

00:41:23.540 --> 00:41:24.380
 I just want to say that,

00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:26.980
 'cause hopefully they'll keep stocking our book

00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:30.380
 and they'll attack their HR policies.

00:41:30.380 --> 00:41:31.820
 - The other thing I've changed is,

00:41:31.820 --> 00:41:34.180
 they've changed their payment system,

00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:37.460
 and Christina was quite concerned about staff

00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:40.420
 possibly stealing from the shop,

00:41:40.420 --> 00:41:41.620
 maybe because they weren't paid very much,

00:41:41.620 --> 00:41:44.220
 but the old payment system,

00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:48.220
 designed to stop staff stealing when does follows.

00:41:48.220 --> 00:41:50.100
 You had to queue up for the book,

00:41:50.100 --> 00:41:51.700
 and then you had to get a docket for it

00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:52.860
 from a staff member,

00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:55.060
 then you had to queue up to pay for the book,

00:41:55.060 --> 00:41:56.700
 then you would get the docket stamped

00:41:56.700 --> 00:41:58.500
 to prove that you had paid for the book,

00:41:58.500 --> 00:42:00.940
 then you would have to queue up a third time

00:42:00.940 --> 00:42:02.980
 at the counter you'd been to first to collect the book.

00:42:02.980 --> 00:42:04.180
 - Wow. - Yeah.

00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:06.660
 And also, she didn't even organize her books

00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:08.380
 by, in any sensible way.

00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:10.100
 She organized them by publisher, didn't she?

00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:11.540
 - Yes. (laughing)

00:42:11.540 --> 00:42:14.020
 - Do you know who all your books are published by?

00:42:14.020 --> 00:42:16.900
 - Because we're random house, by the way,

00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:19.060
 an excellent company, but no, you don't,

00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:22.020
 and you can do alphabetically or by genre, no, she didn't.

00:42:22.020 --> 00:42:23.500
 - Do you know when that lasted until?

00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:25.820
 - That lasted till 1999.

00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:27.540
 - No. - Yeah.

00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:29.620
 - We should say because it sounds like we're slamming them,

00:42:29.620 --> 00:42:30.900
 but falls obviously amazing,

00:42:30.900 --> 00:42:32.260
 and also all this information

00:42:32.260 --> 00:42:34.660
 is on the most brilliant page on their website.

00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:36.060
 So they're one of these sites

00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:39.020
 that obviously has some amazing research

00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:39.940
 are working for them,

00:42:39.940 --> 00:42:41.180
 and they've got a really good site

00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:43.780
 falls bookshop of their history and stories and foils.

00:42:43.780 --> 00:42:44.620
 - Yeah, she's got that.

00:42:44.620 --> 00:42:46.420
 - She died in 1999, Christina,

00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:47.980
 and she really was the end of an era,

00:42:47.980 --> 00:42:49.820
 but after she died, they had a refit

00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:53.460
 in which they discovered a lift that nobody knew about.

00:42:53.460 --> 00:42:54.300
 (laughing)

00:42:54.300 --> 00:42:55.140
 - Wow. - Yeah.

00:42:55.140 --> 00:42:56.420
 - Where did it go?

00:42:56.420 --> 00:42:57.740
 - Up and down, mostly.

00:42:57.740 --> 00:42:59.780
 (laughing)

00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:10.380
 - And it's just moved like a year ago,

00:43:10.380 --> 00:43:13.460
 so it was in this iconic spot on Charing Cross Road,

00:43:13.460 --> 00:43:14.580
 still on Charing Cross Road,

00:43:14.580 --> 00:43:15.540
 but it's moved down the road.

00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:18.340
 But apparently, and I went to it many times,

00:43:18.340 --> 00:43:20.460
 I'm sure you guys did as well.

00:43:20.460 --> 00:43:23.500
 It was a labyrinth of these different weird,

00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:25.060
 tiny crevices you could get,

00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:27.860
 you find yourself hours going a new spot in the bookshop,

00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:29.580
 you didn't know existed, and they had,

00:43:29.580 --> 00:43:31.740
 it was a sort of in joke amongst the shop,

00:43:31.740 --> 00:43:33.940
 because they had an in-house staff magazine,

00:43:33.940 --> 00:43:36.180
 and they always had a lost property section

00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:38.980
 in the, you know, lost and found,

00:43:38.980 --> 00:43:41.460
 and one of the things that they wrote was found,

00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:42.620
 Paul Potter of Made-A-Vale,

00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:45.100
 after wandering for an hour, trying to find his way out.

00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:47.540
 And that happened, that happened a lot,

00:43:47.540 --> 00:43:49.540
 where people, customers would just get lost,

00:43:49.540 --> 00:43:51.020
 and you know, the partners would be like,

00:43:51.020 --> 00:43:52.500
 have you seen my husband and are like,

00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:54.500
 do you have an hour, 'cause we will,

00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:57.060
 we will find his, your husband, 'cause we may have him.

00:43:57.060 --> 00:43:59.980
 (audience laughing)

00:43:59.980 --> 00:44:03.460
 So Christina ran the bookshop after her father, William,

00:44:03.460 --> 00:44:06.260
 retired in 1945, and she ran it into the '90s,

00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:09.500
 and she claimed that she read an entire book every day,

00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:11.940
 had never done her own housework, all cooking,

00:44:11.940 --> 00:44:14.140
 and she only ever drank champagne.

00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:18.460
 She was asked what would happen if she lost her chef,

00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:20.620
 and she said there was always milk, champagne,

00:44:20.620 --> 00:44:22.300
 and smoked salmon in the fridge.

00:44:22.300 --> 00:44:25.060
 (audience laughing)

00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:26.260
 Mine can't.

00:44:26.260 --> 00:44:27.700
 - Yeah. - No, really?

00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:29.380
 (audience laughing)

00:44:29.380 --> 00:44:31.780
 - Current bestseller rank on Amazon.

00:44:31.780 --> 00:44:32.620
 - Yeah.

00:44:32.620 --> 00:44:36.300
 - 1,471,284.

00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:37.140
 - Okay.

00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:38.180
 - So they're beating us, aren't they?

00:44:38.180 --> 00:44:41.180
 (audience laughing)

00:44:41.180 --> 00:44:42.900
 They, the mine can't team.

00:44:42.900 --> 00:44:44.420
 (audience laughing)

00:44:44.420 --> 00:44:48.820
 - But it's not even in the top 700 in the fascism category.

00:44:48.820 --> 00:44:49.660
 - Oh!

00:44:49.660 --> 00:44:51.940
 - It's not for the 700 in the world.

00:44:51.940 --> 00:44:54.460
 - That's fascism. - That's gotta hurt.

00:44:54.460 --> 00:44:57.700
 - But fascism and Nazi books do sell.

00:44:57.700 --> 00:45:00.180
 There's a famous story about Alan Koran,

00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:02.940
 the famous woodcissed and father of Victoria Koran,

00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:05.700
 and he'd noticed that the most popular titles in Britain

00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:08.900
 in those days were about cats, gulf, and Nazis,

00:45:08.900 --> 00:45:12.060
 and so he called his book "Gulfing for Cats"

00:45:12.060 --> 00:45:14.220
 and put a massive swastika on the cover.

00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:17.220
 (audience laughing)

00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:21.740
 The one thing I didn't know about mine camp

00:45:21.740 --> 00:45:24.140
 is that it hadn't a company in picture book.

00:45:24.140 --> 00:45:25.140
 (audience laughing)

00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:25.980
 Not even kidding.

00:45:25.980 --> 00:45:26.820
 - Really?

00:45:26.820 --> 00:45:29.140
 - It was called "The Hitler Nobody Knows,"

00:45:29.140 --> 00:45:32.020
 and it was designed to improve Hitler's public image,

00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:34.260
 'cause his image was very, very bad at the start,

00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:35.340
 'cause obviously he was a thug

00:45:35.340 --> 00:45:37.860
 and he'd organized putches and things like that.

00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:39.180
 - He didn't get much better, did he?

00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:41.660
 - He didn't get much better, but this in Germany

00:45:41.660 --> 00:45:44.260
 turned around the public image of him a lot,

00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:46.020
 'cause it was like a family album.

00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:48.220
 It began with photos of him as a baby,

00:45:48.220 --> 00:45:49.300
 and photos of him as a--

00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:51.020
 - He still had a tiny little mustache.

00:45:51.020 --> 00:45:53.300
 (audience laughing)

00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:54.820
 - Ironically, he looked like Churchill.

00:45:54.820 --> 00:45:57.860
 (audience laughing)

00:45:57.860 --> 00:45:59.540
 But it was massively popular.

00:45:59.540 --> 00:46:02.300
 It sold over 400,000 copies by 1942.

00:46:02.300 --> 00:46:04.900
 - And this was, came along with mine camp--

00:46:04.900 --> 00:46:07.740
 - No, it was another of the works designed

00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:08.820
 to improve his public image.

00:46:08.820 --> 00:46:10.540
 So it wasn't a buy one, get one, free thing,

00:46:10.540 --> 00:46:11.780
 or anything like that, but yeah.

00:46:11.780 --> 00:46:13.580
 - 'Cause they've released a manga version

00:46:13.580 --> 00:46:18.580
 of mine camp now, and someone here is a huge fan.

00:46:18.580 --> 00:46:21.140
 (audience laughing)

00:46:21.140 --> 00:46:23.740
 - So is Hitler portrayed as Japanese in it?

00:46:23.740 --> 00:46:27.900
 - I think he is, yes, I assume he is.

00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:30.140
 So this is weirdly in Japan and Turkey.

00:46:30.140 --> 00:46:32.220
 There are manga versions of mine camp,

00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:34.420
 and it was introduced a few years ago in Japan,

00:46:34.420 --> 00:46:37.580
 and it sold 45,000 copies to bizarre.

00:46:37.580 --> 00:46:39.660
 And then in India, there's a version

00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:42.860
 which is used for business and management students

00:46:42.860 --> 00:46:44.140
 who advised to read it.

00:46:44.140 --> 00:46:45.780
 - It seemed very different over there, I think,

00:46:45.780 --> 00:46:47.940
 'cause they were quite geographically detached

00:46:47.940 --> 00:46:51.060
 from the things that happened in World War II in Europe.

00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:52.900
 And they don't really get taught about the Holocaust

00:46:52.900 --> 00:46:54.340
 as much as we do and stuff like that.

00:46:54.340 --> 00:46:56.140
 So they just sit completely differently.

00:46:56.140 --> 00:46:58.740
 So in India, they have a Hitler Cafe,

00:46:58.740 --> 00:47:02.100
 a Hitler fashion store, and Hitler ice cream.

00:47:02.100 --> 00:47:03.260
 - Really?

00:47:03.260 --> 00:47:04.100
 - Yeah.

00:47:04.100 --> 00:47:06.340
 (audience laughing)

00:47:06.340 --> 00:47:08.180
 - We need to wrap up very shortly.

00:47:08.180 --> 00:47:09.340
 Do you guys have anything before we do?

00:47:09.340 --> 00:47:10.940
 - I've one more story, it's about foils though.

00:47:10.940 --> 00:47:11.780
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:47:11.780 --> 00:47:12.980
 - It's Christopher Foil, who took over

00:47:12.980 --> 00:47:14.860
 from his aunt, Christina.

00:47:14.860 --> 00:47:17.220
 It's just an anecdote he told about a time

00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:19.900
 when he was working in the shop and he wrestled a shop lifter.

00:47:19.900 --> 00:47:21.860
 And I just wanted to tell you it 'cause I love it.

00:47:21.860 --> 00:47:24.860
 He said, he chased him out of the shop, he saw him leaving,

00:47:24.860 --> 00:47:27.020
 and they got into Soho Square right nearby.

00:47:27.020 --> 00:47:29.260
 And he said, I was very calm, very friendly.

00:47:29.260 --> 00:47:31.540
 I said, excuse me, I think you might have some books there.

00:47:31.540 --> 00:47:33.660
 You didn't pay for, would you like to come back to foils

00:47:33.660 --> 00:47:35.260
 and we'll just discuss it?

00:47:35.260 --> 00:47:37.300
 Anyway, at that point, they usually come back quietly,

00:47:37.300 --> 00:47:39.140
 all they lash out or run away or whatever.

00:47:39.140 --> 00:47:40.540
 This chap lashed out.

00:47:40.540 --> 00:47:42.820
 I remember, he kept on trying to kick me in the groin.

00:47:42.820 --> 00:47:45.060
 So what I did was, with one hand, I held him away from me

00:47:45.060 --> 00:47:46.300
 by the knot of his tie.

00:47:46.300 --> 00:47:49.460
 By the other, I held him by the end of his tie.

00:47:49.460 --> 00:47:50.940
 Anyway, we ended up grappling and I remember

00:47:50.940 --> 00:47:52.820
 we were rolling around in the gutter in the next moment.

00:47:52.820 --> 00:47:54.300
 I found myself being hauled to my feet

00:47:54.300 --> 00:47:56.300
 by a burly policeman and he by another.

00:47:56.300 --> 00:47:57.660
 The curious thing about this man was,

00:47:57.660 --> 00:47:59.700
 they were books on breaking codes and ciphers.

00:47:59.700 --> 00:48:02.260
 It turned out, he was an officer in MI5.

00:48:02.260 --> 00:48:05.500
 (audience laughing)

00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:09.100
 Okay, should we wrap up guys?

00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:09.940
 We're gonna wrap up.

00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:11.100
 Okay, that is it.

00:48:11.100 --> 00:48:12.780
 That is all of our facts.

00:48:12.780 --> 00:48:14.220
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:48:14.220 --> 00:48:16.020

00:48:41.780 --> 00:48:45.060
 away to a member of the audience here tonight in Dunstable.

00:48:45.060 --> 00:48:46.860
 We've picked out our favorite fact from the ones

00:48:46.860 --> 00:48:49.740
 that you guys sent in and have we got it here who was,

00:48:49.740 --> 00:48:50.900
 who was, I got it.

00:48:50.900 --> 00:48:53.100
 And I'm just going to take my phone off airplane.

00:48:53.100 --> 00:48:54.140
 Oh, Jesus.

00:48:54.140 --> 00:48:56.020
 I'm really, I am, can I do it?

00:48:56.020 --> 00:48:57.340
 Shall I do another Hitler fact?

00:48:57.340 --> 00:48:58.180
 - Yes.

00:48:58.180 --> 00:48:59.020
 - Great.

00:48:59.020 --> 00:48:59.860
 - Yep.

00:48:59.860 --> 00:49:00.860
 Thank you.

00:49:00.860 --> 00:49:03.460
 - So during the Iran hostage crisis,

00:49:03.460 --> 00:49:06.260
 the CIA managed to sneak some agents into Tehran

00:49:06.260 --> 00:49:08.740
 and they had false German passports.

00:49:08.740 --> 00:49:10.860
 Okay, and one of the agents was stopped

00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:12.540
 by the customs officials and they said,

00:49:12.540 --> 00:49:14.380
 "Something's wrong with your passport."

00:49:14.380 --> 00:49:16.940
 They said, "This is the first time I've seen a German passport

00:49:16.940 --> 00:49:20.260
 "which has a middle initial instead of a full name."

00:49:20.260 --> 00:49:24.220
 And they said, "Your name is given as Joseph H. Schmidt."

00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:26.780
 And the guy was, "Oh my God, I'm going to get caught."

00:49:26.780 --> 00:49:28.340
 And then he suddenly came up with a brainwave

00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:30.740
 and he said, "Well, oh yeah, when I was born,

00:49:30.740 --> 00:49:32.940
 "they gave me my middle name as Hitler

00:49:32.940 --> 00:49:35.460
 "and I have a special permission not to use it."

00:49:35.460 --> 00:49:37.260
 (audience laughs)

00:49:37.260 --> 00:49:38.260
 That's clever, isn't it?

00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:39.260
 - Yeah, that's good.

00:49:39.260 --> 00:49:40.260
 - Did they buy it?

00:49:40.260 --> 00:49:41.100
 - Yeah, they bought it.

00:49:41.100 --> 00:49:41.940
 - Oh, nice.

00:49:41.940 --> 00:49:46.020
 - And Joseph H was H Henry, by any chance, you know?

00:49:46.020 --> 00:49:47.460
 - It was a made-up name, done.

00:49:47.460 --> 00:49:50.460
 (audience laughs)

00:49:50.460 --> 00:49:55.500
 - How's the fact finally going, Andy?

00:49:55.500 --> 00:49:56.340
 - It's fun.

00:49:56.340 --> 00:49:57.540
 - It's fun.

00:49:57.540 --> 00:49:58.820
 - Great, let's get it out.

00:49:58.820 --> 00:50:01.740
 - This is from, it's one of the ones that came in on Twitter

00:50:01.740 --> 00:50:04.580
 and it's from @gtomorrow, you in?

00:50:04.580 --> 00:50:05.780
 - Hey. - Oh, hey.

00:50:05.780 --> 00:50:07.740
 - And, well, we all loved it so much.

00:50:07.740 --> 00:50:11.060
 Is that the French language has 17 different words

00:50:11.060 --> 00:50:12.780
 for surrender?

00:50:12.780 --> 00:50:16.140
 (audience laughs)

00:50:16.140 --> 00:50:18.780
 - Nice, coming, collect your book from us at the end.

00:50:18.780 --> 00:50:19.620
 (audience applauds)

00:50:19.620 --> 00:50:21.500
 - Thanks so much, guys, we'll see you later.

00:50:21.500 --> 00:50:22.340
 Good night!

00:50:22.340 --> 00:50:25.340
 (audience cheers and applauds)

00:50:25.340 --> 00:50:27.940
 (upbeat music)

00:50:27.940 --> 00:50:30.940
 (audience applauds)

00:50:30.940 --> 00:50:33.520
 (upbeat music)

00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:36.100
 (upbeat music)
