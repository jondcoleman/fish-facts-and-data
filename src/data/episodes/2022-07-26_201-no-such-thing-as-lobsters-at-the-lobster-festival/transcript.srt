1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,600
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,720
 - Hey everyone, welcome to this week's episode of Fish.

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,920
 Before we begin, we've just got a bit of announcement,

4
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:08,120
 really exciting announcement.

5
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:11,160
 We are releasing a behind-the-scenes documentary

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,840
 that was filmed during our 2017 tour of the UK.

7
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:18,920
 And it's us on buses, it's us ironing sharks.

8
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:19,760
 It's us.

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,200
 - Can I just say, Dad, it's buses.

10
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,360
 It's not just like buses that the public go on, is it?

11
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,400
 It's not like we're on the 19 bus to Angel.

12
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,440
 - Yeah, and actually it's not even plural buses.

13
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,640
 It's one bus, which is actually a van.

14
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,000
 So it's, I'm just trying to big it up here.

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,480
 What it is, is if you ever wanted to see what it's like

16
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,200
 when we actually go out on the road

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,560
 and we visit all these places in the UK

18
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,640
 and put on these shows, it's a sort of just

19
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,880
 little background insight.

20
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:47,200
 It's like a very less, less funny version of spinal tap.

21
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,040
 - Yeah, if you wanna know some kind of like

22
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,320
 weird twisted secrets from Andy's past

23
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,760
 or some weird twisted secrets from James's past

24
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,840
 or some perfectly normal innocent secrets from my past,

25
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,800
 that they're all in there, there's some interviews,

26
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,280
 we were interviewed and there's some of us

27
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,520
 just pissing around, really.

28
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,360
 - Yeah, this is gonna be available on Monday,

29
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:10,240
 the 29th and January, it's gonna be online exclusively.

30
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,200
 That's right, we said no to H&B.

31
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,880
 - What about people who aren't online?

32
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,320
 - They will live in ignorance.

33
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,800
 - This will bring the last of the world onto the internet.

34
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,800
 (laughing)

35
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,200
 - Yeah, you can get it on iTunes this Monday

36
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,520
 and you'll be able to get it from Google Play

37
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,200
 on Amazon in the very near future.

38
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,960
 It's 1.49 per episode and it's 4.99

39
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,160
 for the bundle of four.

40
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,800
 - And what's it called?

41
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,360
 - This is the highlight, Andy.

42
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,920
 (laughing)

43
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,960
 This is why we deliberately saved this to a last.

44
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,040
 - Yeah.

45
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,800
 - Should we all say it together?

46
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,640
 - Sure.

47
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,160
 - It's called the highlight.

48
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,680
 - The highlight. - No such thing as a fit.

49
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,960
 Present behind the gills.

50
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,880
 - It's called behind the gills, get it, get it now.

51
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,720
 - Yeah. - Okay, on with the show.

52
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:53,200
 - Do we have a saying behind the gills clearly enough?

53
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,600
 It's called behind the gills.

54
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,440
 (upbeat music)

55
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,960
 - Hold on, hold on.

56
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,560
 (upbeat music)

57
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:11,560
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

58
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,400
 of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast,

59
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,960
 this week coming to you from Dunstable.

60
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,960
 (audience cheering)

61
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,960
 (audience cheering)

62
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:31,800
 - My name is Dan Schreiber and I am sitting here

63
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,400
 with Anna Chazinski, Andrew Hunter Murray

64
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,560
 and James Harkin.

65
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,040
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

66
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,800
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

67
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,240
 and in no particular order.

68
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,640
 Here we go, starting with you, James Harkin.

69
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:49,560
 - Okay, my fact this week is the King Ferdinand of Bulgaria

70
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,480
 was so scared of being murdered on the Oriental Express

71
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,560
 that he locked himself in the toilet.

72
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,720
 (audience laughing)

73
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,240
 - Had he read the book, is that why?

74
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,000
 - So amazingly enough, this happened at the turn

75
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,400
 of the 20th century, so it happened before the book.

76
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,240
 So the book came out, before the book,

77
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,000
 which came out in 1934 and before the film,

78
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,640
 which came out two weeks ago.

79
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,040
 (audience laughing)

80
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:16,880
 - Wow. - Did he lock himself

81
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,040
 in the toilet for the whole journey?

82
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:18,880
 - Do we know?

83
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,640
 - No, well we know that he definitely didn't do it

84
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,760
 for the whole journey because one thing we do know

85
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,000
 is that as soon as they got into Bulgaria,

86
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,280
 he decided he wanted to drive the train.

87
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,280
 (audience laughing)

88
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,280
 - And isn't it the case that when he got given the controls,

89
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,280
 I know that it's very hard to mess up driving a train

90
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,240
 'cause you're on a track, but he would put the speed up

91
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:43,280
 'cause he was a speed freak and it would go exceptionally fast

92
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,200
 and they were worried that it was gonna derail

93
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,920
 because he was just loving the...

94
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,760
 - Yeah, that's true.

95
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,320
 - Do we know why he was so...

96
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,160
 I mean, were people after his head

97
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,320
 or were trains just known for murdering the olden days?

98
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,920
 - It's a bit of the first bit actually

99
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,840
 because it was just after he'd become king

100
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,760
 and he was known as Foxy Ferdinand.

101
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,600
 - Oh.

102
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,000
 - And he was known as that 'cause he was a bit of a dandy.

103
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 Okay, and to start with, he wasn't very popular.

104
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,320
 For instance, Queen Victoria said he is totally unfit,

105
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,040
 delicate, eccentric and effeminate

106
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,560
 and he should be stopped at once.

107
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,560
 (audience laughing)

108
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,400
 - Wow.

109
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,040
 - And in his country, by the end, they loved him,

110
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,160
 but to start off with, he was quite unpopular.

111
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,000
 - He was, wasn't he?

112
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,440
 He was sort of a wimp, I think.

113
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,280
 - That's right.

114
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,240
 - So his mum seemed to control a lot of his life.

115
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,000
 Like, for instance, his mum got him the job as king

116
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,840
 and it...

117
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,960
 (audience laughing)

118
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,280
 - I mean, that is how monarchy works, I think.

119
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,840
 (audience laughing)

120
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,480
 - Well, that's not how he worked here, is it?

121
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,320
 Because...

122
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,160
 - It's not.

123
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,280
 She bought him the job.

124
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,800
 - So Bulgaria, it was very unpopular

125
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,640
 the job as king of Bulgaria at that point.

126
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,560
 'Cause I think there was a lot of controversy,

127
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,160
 there was a lot of intrigue and corruption in royal circles.

128
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,960
 So the job, actually, the throne, as they called it,

129
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,560
 was offered to a bunch of other people

130
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,560
 before it was offered to him.

131
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,440
 So it was offered to the princes of Denmark

132
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,520
 to princes from the Caucasus, to the king of Romania.

133
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,360
 And they all said, no, I think I'm all right, thanks.

134
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,000
 And so eventually, Foxyford announced mum said,

135
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,560
 all right, if I give you this amount of money,

136
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,240
 will you let my son be king?

137
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,120
 - Of this place, and that's how he got there.

138
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,560
 It was just so embarrassing.

139
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,720
 - King Edward of Britain died in 1910.

140
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,920
 And Foxyford was on the way to the funeral.

141
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,360
 And he got a massive argument

142
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,040
 over where his private railway carriage should go

143
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,160
 in the train, because things of precedence,

144
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,960
 he thought, well, my carriage should obviously

145
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,680
 be right at the front behind the driver.

146
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,560
 And he lost to Archduke Franz Ferdinand.

147
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,400
 So Archduke Franz Ferdinand got his carriage

148
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,760
 to go right behind the driver.

149
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:43,680
 But that meant that Archduke would have to pass

150
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,800
 through King Ferdinand's carriage to get to the dining car.

151
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,400
 And Ferdinand just locked the door.

152
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,840
 (audience laughing)

153
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,600
 He just said, no, you're not coming through.

154
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,640
 - But things still worked out, okay,

155
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,880
 but Franz Ferdinand, didn't they?

156
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,880
 So. - I did.

157
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,200
 - On the bright side.

158
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,720
 It's actually a really nice thing.

159
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,120
 - It's too soon, weirdly.

160
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,800
 (audience laughing)

161
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,640
 - Is it?

162
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,720
 - I think when it's over 100 years, you're in the clear.

163
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,880
 - Yeah.

164
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,720
 - It's weird.

165
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,200
 We have talked about him before.

166
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,760
 If you've listened to the podcast for a while,

167
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,080
 it's quite nice because one of our main podcast facts

168
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,400
 about two years ago was that Kaiser Wilhelm

169
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,240
 once slapped him on the bottom.

170
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,840
 And he was so offended by this that he was gonna give him

171
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,320
 an arms contract, but then he gave it away to someone else.

172
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,200
 And in that show, we talked about Kaiser Wilhelm a lot.

173
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,840
 So now we're kind of coming back.

174
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,680
 Like, if you did a series, you'd cover one.

175
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,200
 - Yeah, we've seen it from the other angle, aren't we?

176
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,200
 - Oh, yeah.

177
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,040
 He was very upset about the bottom slapping.

178
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,040
 (audience laughing)

179
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,280
 - It's like that new episode of 50 Shades of Grey,

180
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,600
 isn't it from Grey's side?

181
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,880
 - I didn't know that was what it was.

182
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,880
 - And with a slapping part?

183
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,880
 - Yes.

184
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,720
 - Yeah.

185
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,880
 - A lot of body slapping in 50 Shades of Grey, I gather.

186
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,000
 - I think it's written a bit different

187
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,320
 to how you just, he walked in, saw the body.

188
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,960
 (audience laughing)

189
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,760
 That's getting a slap, he said.

190
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,800
 (audience laughing)

191
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,360
 - Heal James, I really regret getting Andrew

192
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,440
 on tomorrow to ghost right in the second one.

193
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,680
 (audience laughing)

194
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:10,640
 - I read another method of how a Bulgarian,

195
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:14,440
 or in this case, all of Bulgaria, avoided being killed.

196
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:17,240
 And it is, and I've been assured that this is not true,

197
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,640
 but I think it's worth saying.

198
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,760
 (audience laughing)

199
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,320
 And the nice thing is, we've now got that on tape,

200
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,820
 so you can stitch that before any fact

201
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,080
 downstairs in the future ever.

202
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,080
 (audience laughing)

203
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,720
 No, but so this is true in Bulgaria,

204
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,960
 when a Bulgarian is signaling yes,

205
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,360
 when you ask them a question,

206
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,000
 they do it with a horizontal,

207
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,840
 they shake their head.

208
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,720
 They shake their head, as what we would know is no,

209
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,840
 they shake as a yes.

210
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,680
 And when you ask a question that is a yes answer,

211
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,280
 they don't do a full nod, but they do an up,

212
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:49,280
 which is what we would take to be yes, right?

213
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,640
 - Is that, sorry, someone just said yes,

214
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,080
 and do we have a Bulgarian?

215
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,080
 - That is true.

216
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,160
 - Yeah, so that, I know that, if we have a Bulgarian,

217
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,680
 we won't know whether they are in the audience,

218
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,160
 'cause are you a Bulgarian?

219
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,800
 (audience laughing)

220
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,320
 Well, well, confusingly, apparently,

221
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,120
 if you're talking to a Bulgarian,

222
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,960
 and they know that you're from some other country,

223
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,280
 they then reappropriate it, so they do that, the opposite way.

224
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,560
 So it's very confusing, 'cause you don't know

225
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,200
 which one is the right answer to it.

226
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,320
 This whole thing was about how they stopped being killed.

227
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,320
 - Yes, yes.

228
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,280
 (audience laughing)

229
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,880
 So apparently, this goes back to the Ottoman times,

230
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,920
 and this is when Turks used to hold a sword

231
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:28,440
 to the neck of them and to the Bulgarians and ask them,

232
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,640
 and it was on an angle to ask them, are you a Christian?

233
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,440
 And to say that they were, they had to change it,

234
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,720
 because that was the most efficient way

235
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,800
 to not slice their neck through movement

236
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,560
 of a sword being held tightly, 'cause they said it.

237
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,640
 - They could have just said it.

238
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,960
 (audience laughing)

239
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:48,480
 - Ah, they could have just said it.

240
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,320
 - Yeah, I didn't, that's why I was told it's not true.

241
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,160
 Okay.

242
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,080
 - But we're saying, right?

243
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,280
 - Oh, yeah, absolutely, yeah.

244
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,320
 - He was absolutely worth saying.

245
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,160
 - Oh, yeah.

246
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,040
 - The Orient Express was amazing, though,

247
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,800
 even more amazing than that.

248
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,960
 It was amazing because so many great people traveled on it.

249
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:09,120
 It was, if you were famous or if you were a world leader,

250
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,440
 then you traveled on it.

251
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,120
 So King Leopold used it to transport himself

252
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,240
 to Constantinople, where he'd arranged,

253
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,440
 made some complicated arrangements

254
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,520
 with a harem to infiltrate a harem.

255
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,320
 So he get involved in that.

256
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,760
 The president of France traveled on it at one point.

257
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,000
 This is actually in 1920, and in 1920,

258
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,280
 what happened was there was a guy working the signal box

259
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,600
 and a man-brain per jammer stumbled up to him

260
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,760
 in the middle of the night and said,

261
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,960
 "Hey, please help me.

262
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,240
 I've just fallen off the train.

263
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,040
 I've fallen out of the window and off the train.

264
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,480
 I'm the president of France."

265
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,920
 And the guy in the signal box said,

266
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:46,680
 and I'm Napoleon Bonaparte, according to those accounts,

267
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,800
 but it was actually the president of France.

268
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,360
 It was Paul Deschanel of France.

269
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,440
 He'd fallen out of the window of the Orient Express,

270
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,480
 and he had to resign very shortly afterwards,

271
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,720
 'cause it was so humiliating.

272
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,200
 - No.

273
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,600
 - I mean, it was slightly to do that.

274
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,240
 It was also slightly to do the fact

275
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,560
 that he'd recently received the British ambassador

276
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,480
 to France naked, except for the ceremonial decorations

277
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,040
 of his office, and that he'd walked out of a state meeting

278
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,120
 straight into a lake fully clothed.

279
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,280
 (laughing)

280
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,520
 - So it was a few of the circumstances going on there

281
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,000
 as well as the Orient Express thing.

282
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 - It was the straw that broke the camel's back,

283
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,800
 and it was-- - It was what he told his wife.

284
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,640
 - It was the camel.

285
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,640
 - It's when I fell off the train.

286
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,640
 That's what I did, it.

287
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:27,720
 - I have some stuff about the luxury trains.

288
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,800
 - So did you know that in the early days of rail,

289
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,800
 lots of very wealthy people had their own

290
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,280
 private train carriages, and you could just pay

291
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:39,360
 and have your train carriage kind of put onto a train.

292
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,960
 - Oh, like the Queen has one of those, doesn't she?

293
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,240
 - Well, she's got a whole train, in fact.

294
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,680
 But for example, there were private carriages,

295
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,920
 and there were family carriages,

296
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,000
 which you could just get a carriage

297
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,360
 for just for you and your family,

298
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,880
 and you would attach it to a train and then change it,

299
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,080
 and at the start of the 20th century,

300
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:58,520
 Manchester had several gentleman's club carriages,

301
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,560
 not in the spearment rhino sense guys.

302
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,960
 They would have clubs, you would pay a subscription,

303
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,000
 and then you would get to use that railway carriage,

304
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,320
 and there were lockers, and you had to be elected,

305
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,480
 and you had to obey the rules, specifically the rules

306
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,160
 about whether you could open the window or not,

307
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,560
 and when it was appropriate.

308
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,400
 - Wow.

309
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,200
 - And you had to turn up to the station on time, presumably.

310
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,280
 - You just had access to the train carriage

311
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,800
 if you joined the club, and there was a gentleman's club

312
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,200
 on wheels.

313
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,040
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

314
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,960
 - Yeah, okay. - Fun.

315
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,440
 Something.

316
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,960
 - Well, you know, it's nice to give James something to edit,

317
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,800
 isn't it?

318
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,800
 (laughing)

319
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,320
 - I think we're giving him too much to edit at this point.

320
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,360
 (laughing)

321
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,400
 - You know, the orange express, the first murder

322
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,960
 that happened on the orange express

323
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:43,280
 was the year after Agatha Christie published her novel.

324
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,480
 - What's it? - Yeah.

325
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,280
 - Yeah, and also, do you know how the person was caught?

326
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,280
 - No, no, what happened?

327
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,320
 - It's a really cool story, so basically,

328
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,600
 there was a woman who was pushed out of a window,

329
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,640
 so who was killed and then pushed out of a window.

330
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,080
 - There's no cool so far, Ernest.

331
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,120
 (laughing)

332
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,880
 - It's extremely harrowing.

333
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,800
 - Sorry.

334
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,440
 - I'm so record, too soon.

335
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,360
 (laughing)

336
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,200
 - Sorry, it was 1935, so it is a bit too soon.

337
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,240
 She was pushed out of the window,

338
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,640
 and her body was found on the tracks,

339
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:14,240
 and all of her possessions, except for a silver fox scarf,

340
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,640
 so a foxkin scarf that she'd been wearing,

341
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,120
 and then by total chance, so this got around

342
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,240
 that the scarf was missing,

343
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,280
 and a policeman in Switzerland,

344
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,720
 a few weeks later, spotted a silver fox scarf

345
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,400
 being worn by a woman, and then went up to her

346
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,560
 and said, "Where's she getting that?"

347
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,000
 And she said, "From this guy,"

348
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,640
 and it turned out that guy had done the murder.

349
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,640
 - Wow.

350
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,920
 - Sorry, the murderer gave it to me.

351
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,760
 - The murderer.

352
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,600
 - Yeah.

353
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,760
 - I got it from a guy who called himself Mr. Murderer.

354
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,720
 - It's crazy to give away the one bit of evidence

355
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,280
 that links you to a crime, to a random person.

356
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,440
 - It was pretty stupid, wasn't it?

357
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,280
 - It was very stupid.

358
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,440
 - Yeah.

359
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,560
 - So the surrender at the end of World War I

360
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,600
 was signed on the Orritic Express,

361
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,240
 but it was signed in a particular carriage,

362
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,480
 which in 1940 Hitler ordered to be hauled

363
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,600
 to the precise spot where it happened,

364
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:02,480
 and that's where he organized the terms of the French surrender.

365
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,480
 - He wasn't absolutely dead.

366
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,480
 - He was such a prick.

367
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,800
 - And I was saying, hey, you've just beat him front, okay?

368
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,640
 A great military power.

369
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,520
 You don't need to go on about it.

370
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,960
 Even by Hitler's standards, that's pretty petty, isn't it?

371
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,800
 - It's so petty.

372
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,120
 And do you know what he did next?

373
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,720
 When he started losing the war,

374
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,440
 he had that drain carriage blown up,

375
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,320
 so they couldn't make him surrender in it again.

376
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,320
 - Oh, what?

377
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,640
 - Hitler, forget the drain carriage.

378
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,640
 - Oh man.

379
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,200
 - God, the more I hear about this guy.

380
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,200
 (audience laughing)

381
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,960
 - We need to move on to our second fact, guys.

382
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,800
 - I just have one tiny thing.

383
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,640
 - Yeah, yeah, go for it.

384
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,360
 - This is about the Queen's private train.

385
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,840
 She's got the royal train.

386
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,440
 And it's actually pretty doubly inside.

387
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,960
 It's not really blingy and Louis XIV-ish.

388
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,880
 It's pretty cool and calm.

389
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,840
 Anyway, there's just one thing that happened in it,

390
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,680
 which I really like.

391
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,240
 So it travels around the country to pick up the royals

392
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,360
 and drop them off and so on.

393
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,600
 And once, it was on its way to pick up Prince Charles

394
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,000
 for a royal function.

395
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,280
 And it stopped very briefly at a station.

396
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,680
 But nobody noticed a middle-aged woman

397
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,840
 on the platform to see it and get on.

398
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,200
 And she just sat at one of the tables in the dining car.

399
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,880
 And it is quite well-decorated, not good.

400
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,480
 It's not a standard train.

401
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,720
 And she just sat there and a member of staff

402
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,960
 was walking through and said,

403
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,960
 "You do know this is the Queen's train, don't you?"

404
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,480
 And she said, "No, I did not know that."

405
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,280
 (audience laughing)

406
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,920
 "I'm sorry, when do we get to slow?"

407
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,200
 (audience laughing)

408
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,800
 And she was given some light refreshments

409
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,560
 and then escorted off at the next stop.

410
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,840
 Ah, I shouldn't let her stay.

411
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,040
 And she's out there somewhere,

412
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,360
 but she knows the other side of this story.

413
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,960
 Let's move on to our next fact.

414
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,040
 Okay, it is time for fact number two.

415
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,480
 And that is my fact.

416
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,920
 My fact this week is that the new goalie

417
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,000
 of the ice hockey team, the Belfast Giants,

418
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,720
 is allergic to ice.

419
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,160
 (audience laughing)

420
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,640
 - It's allergic to ice.

421
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,600
 - Ice, amazing.

422
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,120
 - Yeah, and how do we know he's allergic to ice?

423
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,880
 - He's told us, they noticed when after a match,

424
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,720
 he went into a really cold bath.

425
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,720
 And as he was sitting in the ice cold bath that they have,

426
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,880
 he was breaking out on top.

427
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,280
 And then the breakout, which was sort of raised red lumps,

428
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,200
 got really dark below and they quickly got him out.

429
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,160
 And they said, "You have this disease,

430
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,040
 which is a condition of, you're just allergic

431
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:15,360
 to cold temperatures, you're highly sensitive to it."

432
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,280
 And so as a result, when he is playing on the ice,

433
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,720
 he can't stay still.

434
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,560
 He has to keep his blood circulating

435
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,720
 and moving around and so on.

436
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,320
 Yeah, so when the game is going on

437
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,560
 on the other side of the ice, what's it?

438
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,640
 Rink, the rink, the rink.

439
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:36,040
 He's there, sort of just.

440
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,480
 - 'Cause the other side of the ice implies

441
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,440
 a underside of the ice, isn't it?

442
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,880
 - Yeah, yeah, that's okay.

443
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,120
 - So this guy's called Chris Truel

444
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,840
 and he started playing with the Belfast Giant.

445
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,400
 So I believe he's a junior goalie.

446
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,480
 He's, so there's three of them.

447
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,240
 And yeah, so he just constantly has to move around.

448
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,560
 Otherwise-- - He's goalie, that's the thing.

449
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,960
 So does he sometimes have to move around

450
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,200
 out of the goal mouth?

451
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,120
 - This is the problem.

452
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,120
 - Yeah.

453
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,240
 - I mean, I, yeah, I don't know if it is a problem,

454
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,520
 but I assume that that is a problem.

455
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,360
 Sounds like a problem.

456
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,560
 - Yeah, it does, doesn't it?

457
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,400
 - He's not, he's really cool about it though.

458
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,240
 If you watch an interview,

459
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,080
 he's very much like he's not--

460
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:08,920
 - But he's not too cool.

461
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,880
 - He's not too cool at all. - He's not too cool at all.

462
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,560
 - Yeah, it's an allergy to the cold, right?

463
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,320
 It's not, 'cause there's a different allergy,

464
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,280
 which is an allergy to water,

465
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,080
 which is like you can be allergic to your own tears

466
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:20,920
 and stuff, can't you?

467
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:24,160
 So every time you cry, you then cry even more.

468
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,160
 But it's not that, it's the coldness of it.

469
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,160
 - Yeah, it's cool.

470
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,320
 So I've been avoid saying the word 'cause I can't,

471
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32,120
 I can't pronounce it, but it's erotic carrier.

472
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,280
 That's the, is that a dire pronoun?

473
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,600
 - Yeah, erotic carrier, that's the condition

474
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,440
 that he has.

475
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,040
 - The test for it is very simple.

476
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,280
 The doctor will just hold a piece of ice against you

477
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,920
 and then see if you come out in a red lump.

478
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,880
 - Yeah, I mean, that makes sense, right?

479
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,280
 I'm not saying there's a better test.

480
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,440
 No, I mean, that literally is the test.

481
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,160
 It's like finding out if you're allergic to bees

482
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,440
 by doctor holding a bee to you and letting it--

483
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:57,520
 - Is that the test for bee allergies?

484
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,880
 - It seems like it couldn't be.

485
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,480
 The doctor doesn't say, "Hey, eat a load of these walnuts

486
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,080
 and we'll see what happens." - Well, yeah.

487
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,080
 - All right, you're fine on those.

488
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,120
 Let's see if you're allergic to wasps.

489
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,200
 Sorry, let's bring that up.

490
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,240
 (laughing)

491
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,440
 - Do you know what one way of selling

492
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,280
 if you've gotten allergic reaction is,

493
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,280
 which I'd never heard of?

494
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,320
 Is something called baboon syndrome?

495
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,320
 - Oh, what's that?

496
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,480
 - And that's, well, what would you guess?

497
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,360
 What's the defining filter?

498
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,880
 - You get a big, you get a big bum bum of red.

499
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,040
 - Yeah.

500
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,640
 - Big, got 50 shades of grey again.

501
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,120
 (laughing)

502
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:33,720
 And he came in with a big bum bum of red.

503
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,520
 (laughing)

504
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,280
 - Yeah, it's having a big red bum

505
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,640
 and it's one of the ways you can exhibit allergic reaction

506
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,880
 is bright red buttocks,

507
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,080
 a particularly penicillin reaction

508
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,560
 or like a nickel reaction.

509
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,760
 - Specifically to the bum.

510
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,600
 - Specifically to the bum.

511
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,400
 - And you can just have eaten some penicillin

512
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,600
 and then your bum goes red.

513
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,440
 - Yeah.

514
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,520
 - It's amazing.

515
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,360
 - It's amazing.

516
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,720
 - The boon syndrome, yeah.

517
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,120
 - Over another ironic sports allergy.

518
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:56,960
 - Oh, yeah.

519
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,800
 - There's a jocky.

520
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,960
 A very young jocky called Sean Bowen.

521
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,000
 He raced in the Grand National a couple of years ago.

522
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,600
 As a child, he was allergic to horses.

523
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,680
 And he grew up, he would get eczema.

524
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,560
 Any time he went near a horse,

525
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,440
 but then he grew out of it

526
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,920
 and then he would practice by sitting on a sofa

527
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,800
 and whipping it.

528
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,880
 (laughing)

529
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,080
 - He would sit on the arm of the sofa and thrash it.

530
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,320
 - Ah, that's so funny.

531
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,240
 - Do you know who else was allergic to horses?

532
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,240
 Clint Eastwood.

533
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,080
 - No.

534
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,240
 - No way.

535
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,080
 - All his movies, he had stunt doubles

536
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,640
 and he would do it but he would break out

537
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,320
 if he was on a horse for too long.

538
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,400
 But yeah, Clint Eastwood allergic to horses.

539
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,440
 - That's why he looks so pissed off all the time.

540
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,760
 (laughing)

541
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,440
 - Hannah, before you were saying about the person

542
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,000
 who was allergic to the wrong tears,

543
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,160
 there was a woman who was allergic to the allergy medicine

544
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,400
 she took to deal with her allergies.

545
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,240
 (laughing)

546
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,240
 - Oh man.

547
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:46,520
 - So basically, she got ill with some other allergy

548
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,920
 and then she took an anti-histamine called Benadryl

549
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,640
 and then that caused her shortness of breath, wheezing

550
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,080
 and she went to hospital

551
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,320
 and then when she was in hospital,

552
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,040
 they gave her more Benadryl.

553
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:56,880
 (laughing)

554
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,720
 - Oh God.

555
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,560
 - God.

556
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,400
 - Oh my God.

557
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,320
 - That Harrison Schmidt, Apollo astronaut Harrison Schmidt,

558
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,440
 one of the only people to land on the moon,

559
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,040
 was allergic to the moon.

560
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:07,880
 - Oh yeah.

561
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,720
 - Can you believe that though?

562
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,560
 He was allergic to the moon.

563
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,560
 So you might think that's really weird

564
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,080
 because you're in a suit when you get onto the moon.

565
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,560
 It was when he got back off the moon into the capsule

566
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,560
 and they took the suit off

567
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:21,960
 and supposedly the smellers of like gunpowder sort of smell.

568
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,560
 That is what gave him the allergies

569
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,200
 and he broke out as well in sort of, in hype.

570
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,920
 So one of the only, and there's only 12 people

571
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,760
 who have landed on the moon

572
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,480
 and one of them was allergic to the moon.

573
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,480
 - That's amazing.

574
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,600
 - That's pretty huge, right?

575
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,160
 And there's no way of testing before you go.

576
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,160
 - How do you test?

577
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,520
 - How do you test?

578
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:42,120
 - Tennis player, Layton Hewitt, allergic to grass

579
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:45,560
 as in the floor of the windowed in courts.

580
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,800
 Yeah, not weed.

581
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,240
 - You know horses can be allergic to grass.

582
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,160
 - Horses can be allergic to grass.

583
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,840
 - Yeah, yeah, horses get allergic to grass

584
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,040
 and they have to, it's really sad.

585
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,800
 So there's a woman who's got a horse

586
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,640
 and you have to cover them

587
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,920
 and this big anti-allergy sock from head to toe.

588
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:03,200
 And they get allergic to, you get allergies to grass

589
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,800
 and hay and seeds, all the nuts and seeds that they get fed.

590
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,240
 - It's amazing that you can describe a murder

591
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,400
 as pretty cool, but a horse wearing a giant sock

592
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,880
 is somehow really sad.

593
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,720
 - I know.

594
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,840
 - It's because they get weepy.

595
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,280
 They genuinely get weepy.

596
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:23,960
 They cry tears and they get itchy and they get sneezy.

597
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,680
 - Which of the other dwarfs do they get?

598
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,720
 (laughing)

599
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:34,240
 - The cure for it is to rub on some doc.

600
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,320
 (laughing)

601
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,160
 - There we go.

602
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:39,000
 - That's good. - That's good.

603
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,920
 - So if you're hypersensitive of the whole of just everything,

604
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,440
 like electricity and stuff,

605
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,640
 you can go to a town in America.

606
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,320
 It's in Arizona, it's called Snowflake.

607
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,480
 - No. - Okay.

608
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,800
 And it doesn't get its name because it's full of snowflakes,

609
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,640
 like moaning millennial, so whatever.

610
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,080
 It gets its name because it was founded by two people

611
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:00,600
 called Araster Snow and William Jordan Flake.

612
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,600
 - No way.

613
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,040
 (laughing)

614
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:04,880
 - What?

615
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,720
 - That's incredible.

616
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,560
 - Isn't that amazing?

617
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,840
 - But do you think they thought we'd better found something now

618
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,720
 because we've met?

619
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,880
 - What do you think Flake Snow?

620
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,720
 - Yeah.

621
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,560
 (laughing)

622
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:17,080
 - Wait, so they founded a town for people to escape their allergies?

623
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,480
 - No, they founded a town they were Mormon pioneers,

624
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,200
 but they founded it well away from cities and stuff like that.

625
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,120
 So if you're allergic to wifi and all you think you are

626
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,480
 and electricity and stuff like that,

627
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,640
 then this is a place where you can go and be away from that.

628
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,480
 - Where did you say it was?

629
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,320
 - It's in Arizona.

630
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,160
 - Arizona.

631
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,240
 - Oh, yeah, really remote.

632
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,080
 - Some of it is.

633
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:33,920
 - Yeah.

634
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,760
 - Phoenix.

635
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,600
 - Phoenix.

636
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,680
 - When was that, was that 19th century originally?

637
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:41,560
 - Well, it was founded in 1878 where people are going there now.

638
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,760
 - But this was a real thing when allergies came into the world.

639
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,960
 Hey, we don't know how they appeared in the world.

640
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,360
 It was in the 19th century.

641
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,400
 And then beat it became a really fashionable thing

642
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,840
 because it was the wealthier classes

643
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,360
 that were allergic to stuff, wasn't it?

644
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,320
 And so they began to be hay fever holidays

645
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,880
 that were recommended.

646
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,640
 And that would be if you lived in New York,

647
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,680
 the idea was that you were getting allergic reactions

648
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,080
 to the city like you say.

649
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:06,640
 So Lake Superior and the White Mountain, New Hampshire,

650
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,800
 they would all advertise like hay fever holidays

651
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:12,440
 or allergy escapes, which is a way to get away from your allergies.

652
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:15,280
 It was a very fashionable thing to have.

653
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,240
 - Yeah, it's very cool.

654
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,040
 - Anything about hockey, that ice hockey?

655
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:18,880
 - Yeah, sure, yeah.

656
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,720
 - So this sounds quite cool.

657
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,080
 Underwater ice hockey.

658
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:23,920
 - Wow.

659
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:27,360
 - Okay, it's played upside down underneath frozen pools.

660
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,200
 - No.

661
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,280
 - So that is the other side of the ice

662
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,880
 that I was talking about.

663
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,720
 - Wow.

664
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,080
 - And they use a wooden puck, so it floats.

665
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,120
 And basically you can only stay under,

666
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,520
 they don't use breathing apparatus.

667
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,640
 So you can only stay underwater for 30 seconds

668
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,840
 and then you go back up and then you go back down again.

669
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,560
 And it's next goal wins.

670
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:47,360
 So it's only one goal, two of the scars first wins.

671
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,760
 - Wow.

672
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,680
 - They're not wearing all the hockey stuff, are they?

673
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,880
 - Well, they have a stick.

674
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,360
 - They have a stick, but are they in trunks and with a stick?

675
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,520
 - Trunks and stick.

676
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,120
 - That is amazing.

677
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:57,960
 - Yep.

678
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,640
 Don't confuse it with underwater hockey.

679
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,560
 Underwater hockey is on the floor of a swimming pool

680
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,960
 with a sinking puck.

681
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,520
 So you have a really heavy sinking puck.

682
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,880
 It's on the bottom and you're playing it

683
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,200
 along the bottom of a swimming pool.

684
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,520
 - But how can you hit something underwater

685
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,880
 and have momentum?

686
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,800
 - Yes, momentum still works on the water.

687
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,800
 (laughing)

688
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,960
 I mean, the laws of physics still work on the water.

689
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,240
 But you are right that it's more viscous

690
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,440
 so it would be more difficult.

691
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,440
 - It would be really hard, right?

692
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,520
 - Yeah, you would hit it, and it would.

693
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,360
 - It's harder.

694
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,600
 - The whole thing sounds harder.

695
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,600
 (laughing)

696
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,520
 - Almost everything is harder underwater.

697
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,680
 (laughing)

698
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:33,440
 - Swimming's not swimming is one of the very few exceptions

699
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,440
 to this rule then.

700
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,800
 (laughing)

701
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,600
 But mostly you have a fri and egg underwater.

702
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,440
 It's a nightmare.

703
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,920
 (laughing)

704
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,760
 - That's true.

705
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,000
 - It's not coaching an egg and the egg.

706
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,840
 - Just a break.

707
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,120
 (laughing)

708
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:44,960
 - More to it.

709
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,560
 (clapping)

710
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,720
 - No, ice hockey.

711
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,560
 - Yeah, I go on.

712
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:53,040
 - Yeah, I became obsessed with the fights in ice hockey.

713
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:53,880
 - Oh yes.

714
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,160
 - Oh my goodness, there are so many fights.

715
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,000
 - Oh yeah.

716
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,920
 - And I didn't know anything about ice hockey

717
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,840
 and I think you watched it a lot.

718
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,680
 - I watched it a lot.

719
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,000
 - You watched it a lot, yeah.

720
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,520
 But I didn't know that they were regulated

721
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:07,960
 as fisticuffs in the rule book of ice hockey.

722
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:11,000
 And you know, there are lots of unwritten rules as well.

723
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,040
 So you have to agree to a fight

724
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,800
 and you can't hit someone with your stick.

725
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,520
 - Yeah, I mean they still do, but you're not supposed to.

726
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,000
 But you would have one player on your team

727
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,720
 who's kind of the guy who does the fighting.

728
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,840
 - And how does, is he only allowed to fight

729
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,600
 the other team's fighter guy?

730
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,960
 Or could he fight the other guy?

731
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,480
 - They're the guys who kind of start it

732
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,080
 and then everyone gets in on the act.

733
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:30,920
 - Okay.

734
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,440
 - But they're called the enforcer basically

735
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:35,520
 and you would have, say the other team is doing really well

736
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,800
 and you kind of wanna stop them in their tracks a little bit

737
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,920
 then you might start a fight to try and put them off

738
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,000
 and then you might carry on.

739
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,040
 - But it's Andy, have you seen it?

740
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:44,880
 - I've seen it, yeah.

741
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,720
 - Yeah, yeah.

742
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:50,160
 It's actively, not officially, but it's actively encouraged

743
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,960
 by the crowd and it's part of the game.

744
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,400
 Yeah, so they throw their gloves off,

745
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,160
 they take their helmet off, they go around each other

746
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,240
 with their fists like that

747
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,880
 and then they absolutely wallop each other

748
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,640
 and it's part of the tradition.

749
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,880
 It happened in fact in the first game ever,

750
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,360
 first ever ice hockey game.

751
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,440
 - It was, it was not between the hockey players.

752
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,440
 It was between the ice hockey players

753
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,480
 and the ice skaters who were pissed off

754
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,800
 that they'd taken their ring to,

755
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,120
 and it was after the match so it didn't get reported

756
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:21,000
 but there was a fight in the very first ever ice hockey match.

757
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,960
 - Sometimes it goes a little bit too far.

758
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,680
 I read about one Russian game between Avangard and Vityaz.

759
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:30,160
 The fighting in that game started after three minutes.

760
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,400
 Actually, it was three minutes 27

761
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,240
 when a Brawl take place between basically

762
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,640
 all the players on both teams.

763
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,480
 - Wow.

764
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,200
 - Okay, a few of the players were sent to the synbin

765
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,840
 and then they started the game again

766
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,800
 of three seconds later, another fight started.

767
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,440
 And then eight more players were sent off.

768
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,760
 And then the game started again

769
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:52,080
 and then two seconds later, there was a third fight.

770
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,320
 And then at that stage so many people had been sent off

771
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,600
 that they couldn't carry on the game

772
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,960
 so they just abandoned it.

773
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,960
 - Oh my God.

774
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:01,080
 - And both teams were given a five-nil defeat.

775
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,880
 Teams lost five-nil.

776
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,720
 - How'd you do, darling?

777
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,280
 Well, we lost but some of the other guys.

778
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:08,880
 - Hey, we need to move on to our next fact very shortly.

779
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,280
 Should I move us on now?

780
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,120
 - Yes, we should.

781
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:11,960
 - Ready to go, yeah.

782
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,520
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three

783
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,880
 and that is Andrew Hunter Murray.

784
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,360
 - My fact is that after every festival,

785
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,160
 the founder of Glastonbury has to drive around his farm

786
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,440
 with a giant magnet.

787
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,720
 And the reason he has to do that

788
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,560
 is that there are tent pegs left

789
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,920
 across his entire farm in the ground

790
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,040
 and he can't see them.

791
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,240
 So there's a specially customized tractor

792
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,840
 with a giant magnet strapped onto the front of it.

793
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,680
 - Wow.

794
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,520
 - So cool.

795
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,600
 - Which he drives around, it weighs over a ton.

796
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,000
 I think he has someone to do it for him

797
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,320
 because he's quite old now, Michael Davis.

798
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,680
 - But what do you reckon it weighs

799
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,680
 after he's done doing it?

800
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:48,280
 - I guess 100 or 150 tons.

801
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,320
 - Wow, I don't, I don't, I don't.

802
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,560
 (audience laughing)

803
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,600
 - That's crazy.

804
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,120
 - I know, it's nuts, isn't it?

805
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,840
 - Why do you have the actual answer down?

806
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,840
 - No, I just curious, I hear.

807
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,840
 - No, okay.

808
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,000
 - Because you're adding metal to metal

809
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,240
 and then that adds up.

810
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,600
 - Yeah, no, it does, is you?

811
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,040
 - You're not wrong.

812
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,320
 - Yeah.

813
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,320
 - It's true, but I reckon if these guys hadn't laughed,

814
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,520
 you'd have taken 150 tons because I'm not sure

815
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,520
 you know what a ton is.

816
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,680
 - I was telling all the answers.

817
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,680
 - That's not the answer, I was teasing.

818
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,520
 - That's not the answer, I don't know.

819
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,360
 - Okay.

820
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,880
 (audience laughing)

821
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,400
 - But something in that region?

822
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,240
 - Yeah.

823
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,800
 - No, no, no, no, no, no.

824
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,560
 - Now we're in that region, okay.

825
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,040
 - I don't know, I'm afraid.

826
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,960
 - But there are thousands of thousands of tents,

827
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,400
 which get abandoned, you know.

828
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,320
 - And they need to pick them up

829
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,360
 because in the past cows have been grazing

830
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:35,560
 on these tent pegs and it can injure them quite badly.

831
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,400
 - Yeah.

832
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,080
 - Yeah, well they, yeah, they choke for cows.

833
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,720
 'Cause he's got a very successful dairy.

834
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,280
 I didn't quite realize that Michael Evers

835
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:45,520
 is one of the most successful dairy farmers in the area.

836
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,600
 So the guy who founded it, yeah.

837
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,960
 And that's why it's so quite famously,

838
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,880
 I think at the first Glastonbury ever,

839
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,920
 you got free pint of milk, I think.

840
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,720
 - It was one pound to get in, wasn't it?

841
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,880
 One pound to get in, you got a free bottle of milk.

842
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,720
 - Yeah, really?

843
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,320
 - And then at the most recent Glastonbury,

844
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,640
 you could see pole dancing robots,

845
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,480
 make a cucumber trumpet,

846
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,520
 and jump off a trolley ship shaped like a fish.

847
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,360
 (audience laughing)

848
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,440
 - It's lost its way, hasn't it?

849
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,760
 Lost its way, no free milk.

850
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,880
 Do you get free milk still?

851
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,720
 - No mate.

852
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,560
 - Bloody hell.

853
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:17,000
 - He does, he's a judge of cheese competitions though.

854
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,160
 - At the festival.

855
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,640
 - At the festival.

856
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,880
 Not at the festival, no, no.

857
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,720
 - I've completely misunderstood what the festival is like,

858
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,160
 I think, I've never been.

859
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:27,320
 The very first one, it was in 1970

860
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,920
 and it was called Worthy Farm Pop Festival.

861
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:33,200
 And the bee had a great article about the first Glastonbury

862
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,800
 and they put up one of the flyers for it

863
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,160
 and the flyers, it was so sweet, they said,

864
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:40,560
 the acts will include the kinks, Wayne Fontana,

865
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:43,200
 and at least six other groups.

866
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,040
 (audience laughing)

867
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:47,000
 And in the event, neither the kinks nor Wayne Fontana turned up.

868
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,840
 (audience laughing)

869
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,680
 - Wow, wow.

870
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,960
 - The six others turned up.

871
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,160
 - Well T-Rex turned up to replace their blinders.

872
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,400
 So, yeah, pretty good.

873
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,880
 - Oh yeah, and that's famously where T-Rex exploded

874
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:01,960
 into the popular consciousness of the British public.

875
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:02,800
 - Yeah.

876
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,280
 - I'd memorize that sentence from the article that I read.

877
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,000
 (audience laughing)

878
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,280
 So, what year was that?

879
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,120
 - 1970.

880
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,960
 - 1970, right, God.

881
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:11,960
 So, he's been going for it.

882
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,200
 He's quite old now, Michael.

883
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,200
 Yeah, he's eighties.

884
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,640
 - Yeah, he's very cool though.

885
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,840
 So, everyone probably watched Glastonbury this year

886
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:22,800
 and he, Jeremy Corbyn was there and got up on stage.

887
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:27,080
 So, Jeremy Corbyn is a parliamentary beard of the year winner

888
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:30,040
 and actually, Michael Evers, if you can picture him,

889
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,080
 has a very impressive beard himself.

890
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,920
 And he went up on stage with Jeremy Corbyn.

891
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,280
 Jeremy Corbyn gave him the Labour Manifesto.

892
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,080
 And as that was being handed over,

893
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:41,240
 there were just two beard legends on stage

894
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:45,600
 because Michael Evers won beard of the decade in 2009.

895
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,440
 - Wow.

896
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,280
 - In the world.

897
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,800
 So, he beat Fidel Castro to the top spot.

898
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,640
 - You're kidding.

899
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,480
 - Yeah.

900
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,160
 - You know, there's a secret underground piano bar

901
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,560
 at Glastonbury, what?

902
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,480
 - Yeah, and a reporter from the beab

903
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,360
 went looking for it as a recent festival

904
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:03,440
 and he reported back that there is no piano that I can see.

905
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,280
 The bar does not turn out to sell alcohol

906
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,360
 and most of it is not underground.

907
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,560
 (audience laughing)

908
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,520
 - And also not a secret now, it's been a moment.

909
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,720
 - That was not a secret either, though.

910
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,920
 - He's against alcohol.

911
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,760
 Well, he's not a drinker, is he?

912
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,720
 The Glastonbury founder, Michael Evers.

913
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,440
 No, and he's never taken any drugs.

914
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,920
 He's anti-smoking.

915
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,640
 He's a real methodist.

916
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,680
 It's, I can't tell if it's a disappointment or really nice.

917
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:30,560
 But, yeah, and he always wears shorts.

918
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,680
 This is the thing he's famous for.

919
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,400
 He always wears shorts, whatever time of year it is.

920
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,320
 And do you know why he does that?

921
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,960
 - He likes to keep his legs cool.

922
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,560
 - That makes a lot of sense, actually.

923
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:45,760
 - He's got lovely calf muscles.

924
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,120
 - Yes, it's that.

925
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,640
 It is that he...

926
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,480
 - What?

927
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:54,360
 - He was like, he's a very famous kind of, you know,

928
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,680
 liberal hippie campaigner.

929
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:58,140
 And he was an anti-thatcher march in the early,

930
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:03,260
 a touchy years, and he said, his GP's wife was walking behind me.

931
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:05,060
 And she said, do you know, Michael,

932
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:07,060
 you've got the most amazing legs.

933
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,700
 And no one had ever said that to me before.

934
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,580
 And so I've worn shorts ever since.

935
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:12,340
 (laughing)

936
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:14,540
 - I love the idea that maybe it affects everyone.

937
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,220
 So when he meets all the bands,

938
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:18,220
 Coldplay will come up to him, like, hi, but...

939
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,380
 Oh my goodness.

940
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:20,780
 (laughing)

941
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:23,220
 What are the flowers?

942
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:24,980
 Just everyone's...

943
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:27,460
 - Yeah, Stanley, yeah, nice.

944
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:30,340
 - Some other cool festivals from the world.

945
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:33,140
 The untold festival took place in Transylvania,

946
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:35,820
 and you could pay with your blood.

947
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:36,980
 - Whoa!

948
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:37,820
 - Yeah.

949
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:39,940
 If you signed up to become a blood donor,

950
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,180
 you got a discount.

951
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:44,220
 And if you showed up in person at a centre nearby,

952
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:47,060
 then you would get a free one day ticket on the spot.

953
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:47,900
 - Wow.

954
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:51,140
 - But wouldn't you be a bit tired to enjoy the festival?

955
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:53,300
 Yeah, it doesn't, it tires you out, doesn't it?

956
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:56,580
 - No, I mean, I mean, you can still hear music.

957
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,580
 (laughing)

958
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:02,300
 - Yeah, it's not too bad, a problem.

959
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,780
 I got one, James, I really like.

960
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:08,420
 This is from last year, it was the Newfoundland Lobster Festival.

961
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:10,820
 Yeah, and what I like about it is that,

962
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:14,780
 due to a mess up of transporting the Lobsters to the festival,

963
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:17,220
 they didn't have any Lobsters at the festival.

964
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:19,420
 And so instead, everyone had to eat hot dogs.

965
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:21,700
 (laughing)

966
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:24,300
 It was on an airplane, and the airplane went to the wrong destination,

967
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:26,980
 or they put it onto the wrong carrier.

968
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,740
 Yeah, so you've got delivered to a whole different place,

969
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,220
 and they're like, we're waiting for the Lobsters.

970
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:33,580
 - Why, if they have to get the Lobsters over by-played,

971
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:35,260
 why are they having a Lobster Festival?

972
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:36,100
 - It's a very good party.

973
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:38,420
 - No, I'm not sure, because maybe they got it

974
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:41,420
 from a great Lobster place like Florida or something like that.

975
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:43,020
 - Then have the festival in Florida.

976
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:45,860
 - No, but they live in Newfoundland, they can't just read.

977
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,300
 - They don't have the festival, like?

978
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:50,700
 - No, but they want to, I don't have a Caribbean festival

979
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,340
 in South London to buy.

980
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:55,060
 - Yeah, but you could, because that's what people do.

981
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,780
 - But why would I fly in three tons of sand?

982
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:58,300
 It doesn't make any sense to them.

983
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,140
 (laughing)

984
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:01,020
 - I'd just have a South London festival.

985
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,980
 - Okay, that's true, but where did the Lobsters end up?

986
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:04,820
 Do we know?

987
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:06,980
 - No, I just a different place, and then the problem is,

988
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:08,860
 is by the time they got there, this was the complaint,

989
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:10,620
 they said some of the Lobsters had died,

990
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:13,220
 which is what I thought you'd want when you were about to eat one,

991
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:14,740
 so that shouldn't be a problem.

992
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:16,820
 Do you want, oh, you want them alive right after the...

993
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:18,940
 - Well, you keep them alive in your bath, don't you?

994
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:20,700
 If you buy a Lobster to eat, then it...

995
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:21,900
 - Yeah, that's one of the other things

996
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:24,540
 it's easier to do underwater is keep a Lobster alive.

997
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:26,060
 (laughing)

998
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:27,140
 So it's three now.

999
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:33,220
 - You were just saying about transporting these Lobsters.

1000
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,060
 - Yeah.

1001
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:37,700
 - And there was a mud festival in New Zealand called Mudtopia,

1002
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:41,900
 and they transported five tons of mud from South Korea.

1003
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:44,100
 - Wow.

1004
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:46,740
 - Those mud salesmen must have thought all their Christmases

1005
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:47,580
 have come up once.

1006
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:49,900
 I've had another year of no orders,

1007
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:53,420
 I guess it's time to shut down the mud export business.

1008
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:55,100
 - Dreaming, dreaming, hello.

1009
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,460
 - It's New Zealand.

1010
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:58,860
 We'd like five tons of mud, five tons.

1011
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,860
 We've only got four tons.

1012
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,580
 We're back to going out of business.

1013
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:05,100
 (laughing)

1014
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:05,940
 - Don't, that's true.

1015
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:07,860
 And basically, I mean, just to finish it,

1016
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:10,380
 they needed this mud for the mud festival,

1017
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:13,020
 and they said the local councillor said,

1018
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:16,540
 "I know there's a perception that we have enough mud ourselves,

1019
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:18,780
 but you can't just pull any old mud out of the ground

1020
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:20,420
 and throw it at people."

1021
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:21,580
 There could be anything in there

1022
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:23,660
 that might end up making people sick.

1023
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:25,580
 So basically, the South Korean stuff

1024
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:28,100
 had had some kind of stuff done to it stop it,

1025
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,260
 making people sick.

1026
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:30,100
 - It's clean mud.

1027
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:30,940
 - Clean mud?

1028
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:31,780
 - Wow.

1029
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:33,140
 - Which is amazing to yourself, isn't it?

1030
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:33,980
 - Yeah.

1031
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:36,500
 - Do you know that at the Redding and Leeds festivals

1032
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,460
 this year, I don't know if anyone went,

1033
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:41,220
 but there was pineapples were banned.

1034
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:45,060
 So there's a list of banned stuff on,

1035
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:47,260
 you know, that you're not allowed to take in submachine guns

1036
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:49,260
 or bombs or anything.

1037
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:51,740
 And then pineapples was added to the list.

1038
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:53,300
 And that's because of this ban that I've never heard of,

1039
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,620
 probably everyone else has called glass animals.

1040
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:57,140
 But yeah, they've just got a lyric in their song,

1041
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:58,460
 which says pineapples are in my head.

1042
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:00,260
 And so whenever they have a gig,

1043
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:02,820
 everyone who comes to the gig apparently brings pineapples

1044
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:04,420
 and they can cause a lot of damage.

1045
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:06,340
 And so they have to put on the ban list.

1046
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:07,580
 - What damage?

1047
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:08,420
 - What damage can you get?

1048
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:11,500
 - They're spiky, they're really super spiky.

1049
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:14,340
 - They're really, yeah, they're really spiky.

1050
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:18,740
 - Yeah. - Yeah, no, I didn't think about it that way

1051
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:19,580
 when you said it, Jane.

1052
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:22,420
 So when Dan back you up, fair play.

1053
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:26,740
 - They're spiky.

1054
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:29,420
 Okay, maybe in future shows we can get everyone

1055
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:31,260
 on the front row to throw pineapples at you.

1056
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:32,780
 How would you like that?

1057
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:33,780
 - Yeah, it's fair.

1058
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:36,380
 - You've only ever seen them in those chopped up cubes

1059
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:37,820
 in marks and spenters, haven't you?

1060
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:41,380
 - I'm normally being presented them at an ambassador's dinner

1061
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:42,380
 in the '70s.

1062
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:46,140
 - Did you guys do anything on magnets at all?

1063
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,220
 - No. - Yeah.

1064
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:48,940
 - Yeah, come on, let's do some foreign bed.

1065
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:52,100
 - Just quickly, have you guys heard of a thing

1066
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:54,140
 called the Iron Harvest?

1067
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:55,660
 Because I've never heard of this.

1068
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:58,460
 This is a thing that happens every year in Belgium and France

1069
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:02,580
 and it's a harvest, literally, of iron from the First World War.

1070
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:04,380
 And it's still turning up in farmer's fields

1071
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:05,580
 across Belgium and France.

1072
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,420
 - Wow.

1073
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:08,420
 - So during the First World War,

1074
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:10,740
 for every square meter of territory on the Western front,

1075
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:13,180
 a ton of explosives was fired.

1076
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:14,620
 Every square meter.

1077
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:15,860
 So it normally turns out--

1078
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:17,300
 - That's a lot done, by the way.

1079
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,300
 - Yeah.

1080
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,300
 (audience laughing)

1081
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,620
 - That doesn't sound a lot.

1082
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:24,780
 And so in spring and autumn is when the farmer's plow

1083
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:27,660
 their fields and that's when the ground slowly turns it up.

1084
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:29,300
 And the French mine clearing department

1085
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:33,300
 gets sent about 900 tons of unexploded bombs every year.

1086
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,140
 - Wow.

1087
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:37,020
 - A few years ago, just around EEPRA itself,

1088
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:40,420
 just around EEPRA, they got 160 tons of metal,

1089
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:42,900
 which is not to fill five large lorries.

1090
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,100
 All First World War stuff.

1091
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:44,940
 - Wow.

1092
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:45,780
 - Yeah.

1093
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:46,620
 - That's crazy.

1094
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:48,140
 - Do you know something they use magnets for?

1095
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:51,060
 In the 1930s and early 20th century,

1096
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:52,420
 that's quite cool.

1097
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:53,700
 - Okay, a health thing?

1098
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,940
 - It is a health thing.

1099
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:56,740
 It's for eye problems.

1100
00:36:56,740 --> 00:37:00,220
 So I read this on Boeing Boeing, I think,

1101
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:02,340
 which sounds not like a legit website.

1102
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:03,340
 - It's real loud.

1103
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:04,340
 - Boeing Boeing is brilliant.

1104
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:05,180
 - Boeing Boeing is great.

1105
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:06,020
 It's just the way you said it.

1106
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:07,740
 It sounded like a weird toy.

1107
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:09,540
 I read it on Boeing Boeing.

1108
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:11,140
 (audience laughing)

1109
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:12,940
 - So what kind of eye problems might you have?

1110
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,460
 - So you'd have stuff caught in your eyes.

1111
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:16,620
 So people used to get eye and filings caught in their eyes

1112
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:20,020
 when they worked in industrial, you know, in factories and stuff.

1113
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:23,100
 And there was invented in Minneapolis,

1114
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:25,580
 this piece of equipment that weighed 800 pounds.

1115
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:29,060
 So that is the way of, I think, about five full grown women.

1116
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:30,860
 And it was a magnet.

1117
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:32,580
 It had the pull of 10 horsepower.

1118
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:35,020
 It involved 7,000 feet of wire.

1119
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,780
 And it came towards your eye.

1120
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:38,940
 And you had a tiny bit of metal stuck in the back of it.

1121
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:40,620
 And then it sucked the metal out.

1122
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:41,460
 - Whoa.

1123
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:43,660
 - But surely it would suck it out.

1124
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:44,940
 - Through your eye.

1125
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:46,460
 - I would have thought as well.

1126
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:49,580
 I've only seen the advertisements in the British newspaper archive.

1127
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:51,180
 - I think if you got something in your eye,

1128
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:53,620
 it's not gonna be directly behind your eyeball, probably.

1129
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:54,460
 - Oh yeah.

1130
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:55,300
 - It's just not.

1131
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:56,140
 - I wouldn't risk.

1132
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,700
 It could come out through the lid.

1133
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,020
 I don't know.

1134
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:00,620
 10 horsepower is more than you need

1135
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:03,060
 to suck a tiny bit of metal out of your eye.

1136
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:03,900
 - 10 horsepower.

1137
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,300
 - You would think one horse could do that.

1138
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:07,300
 (audience laughing)

1139
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:09,860
 Hey, we need to move on to our final fact of the show.

1140
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:12,500
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show.

1141
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,780
 And that is Chuzinski.

1142
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:18,180
 - My fact this week is that during World War II,

1143
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:21,540
 the owners of Foils bookshop protected the store

1144
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:26,300
 from Nazi bombs by covering the roof in copies of Mein Kampf.

1145
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:28,380
 (audience laughing)

1146
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:29,500
 - It's so good.

1147
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,900
 - It's so nice.

1148
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:31,740
 - Yeah.

1149
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:34,100
 - This one's got that nice, is it?

1150
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,260
 - Nice is the wrong word.

1151
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:36,100
 - Yeah.

1152
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,260
 - But it was fitting.

1153
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:40,060
 So this is William Foil who set up foils.

1154
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:43,340
 And so at World War II, he filled sandbags

1155
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:45,020
 with all these old books.

1156
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:47,540
 And in order to kind of bolster the shop

1157
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:49,900
 against the bombs during the blitz in London.

1158
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:52,100
 And he said that he was covering the roof

1159
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,340
 with copies of Mein Kampf.

1160
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:55,220
 And newsreels at the time said,

1161
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:58,180
 "Foils of London is stacked with copies of Mein Kampf

1162
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:00,260
 in the place of sandbags."

1163
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:01,740
 - Yeah, that's what it is.

1164
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:02,580
 - That's what it is.

1165
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:05,340
 - Just for context, for overseas listeners,

1166
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:07,980
 we make this podcast, usually in Covenant Garden,

1167
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:11,140
 which is in Soho-ish area.

1168
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:14,100
 On Charing Cross Road is Foils Bookshop,

1169
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:17,660
 which is a 15 minute walk from where we work.

1170
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:20,900
 And it's one of the most iconic bookshops in London.

1171
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,740
 It's an independent bookshop.

1172
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:24,860
 And it was known for its eccentricities.

1173
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:26,860
 And it's been going for a very long time.

1174
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:30,060
 And it's still one of the iconic bookshops of London.

1175
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:30,900
 - Yeah.

1176
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,620
 - A Mein Kampf was a book by Hitler.

1177
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,420
 (audience laughing)

1178
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:35,900
 - It's one of the iconic bookshops.

1179
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:38,100
 (audience laughing)

1180
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,300
 Oh, what's he done now?

1181
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:40,300
 Is there more?

1182
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:43,420
 - It's not even the only time that the foils

1183
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:44,860
 had a run in with the Nazis.

1184
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:47,940
 So in fact, earlier than that, Christina Foil,

1185
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:50,660
 who was the daughter of William the founder,

1186
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:53,260
 when the Nazis held their book "Burnings",

1187
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:54,980
 she wrote to Adolf Hitler saying,

1188
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:57,660
 "We'll give you a good price, we'll buy them, don't burn them."

1189
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:58,500
 Which is good.

1190
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:02,860
 And then the reply was negative but respectful, apparently.

1191
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:03,700
 - Yeah.

1192
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:06,700
 - And then in 1939, Christina also invited Hitler,

1193
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:10,420
 Mussolini, and Stalin, to speak at one of her literary lunches.

1194
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:11,260
 - Wow.

1195
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:12,460
 - So they used to have these lunches with incredible figures

1196
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:13,740
 from the world of literature.

1197
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:15,260
 And she invited all three.

1198
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:16,100
 - Wow.

1199
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:18,940
 - Hitler replied that he had urgent business in Germany.

1200
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:20,300
 Mussolini and Poland.

1201
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:23,300
 (audience laughing)

1202
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:28,820
 - Mussolini said that he might visit

1203
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:30,580
 when things quiet him down a bit.

1204
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:33,660
 (audience laughing)

1205
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:36,340
 - Stalin didn't reply, didn't he?

1206
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,180
 - Rude.

1207
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:39,020
 - Okay.

1208
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:42,140
 - She was a character, actually.

1209
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:44,700
 And not in a massively positive sense, maybe.

1210
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:49,260
 So Foil has been through some tough times,

1211
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:50,300
 partly because of her.

1212
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:52,660
 So she wasn't really a fan of her,

1213
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:54,260
 the people who worked in her bookshop.

1214
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:56,540
 So she used to summarily sack them

1215
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:58,460
 before they'd worked for six months

1216
00:40:58,460 --> 00:40:59,700
 because after six months,

1217
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:01,420
 you're entitled to better employment rights.

1218
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:02,460
 So if you work for foils,

1219
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,060
 then you get sacked up to six months.

1220
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:06,540
 And this meant that you got quite not very good staff,

1221
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:08,180
 and you got not very dedicated staff,

1222
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:09,940
 and there was a story of someone

1223
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:13,580
 who came in in the '60s or '70s and asked for Ulysses,

1224
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:15,340
 and the person at the till replied

1225
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:16,900
 that Ulysses had gone out to lunch,

1226
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,820
 but would serve them as soon as possible.

1227
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:20,060
 - All right, nice.

1228
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:23,540
 They have changed that policy now, by the way.

1229
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:24,380
 I just want to say that,

1230
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:26,980
 'cause hopefully they'll keep stocking our book

1231
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:30,380
 and they'll attack their HR policies.

1232
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:31,820
 - The other thing I've changed is,

1233
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:34,180
 they've changed their payment system,

1234
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:37,460
 and Christina was quite concerned about staff

1235
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:40,420
 possibly stealing from the shop,

1236
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:41,620
 maybe because they weren't paid very much,

1237
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:44,220
 but the old payment system,

1238
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:48,220
 designed to stop staff stealing when does follows.

1239
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:50,100
 You had to queue up for the book,

1240
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:51,700
 and then you had to get a docket for it

1241
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:52,860
 from a staff member,

1242
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:55,060
 then you had to queue up to pay for the book,

1243
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:56,700
 then you would get the docket stamped

1244
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:58,500
 to prove that you had paid for the book,

1245
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,940
 then you would have to queue up a third time

1246
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:02,980
 at the counter you'd been to first to collect the book.

1247
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:04,180
 - Wow. - Yeah.

1248
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:06,660
 And also, she didn't even organize her books

1249
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:08,380
 by, in any sensible way.

1250
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:10,100
 She organized them by publisher, didn't she?

1251
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,540
 - Yes. (laughing)

1252
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:14,020
 - Do you know who all your books are published by?

1253
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:16,900
 - Because we're random house, by the way,

1254
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:19,060
 an excellent company, but no, you don't,

1255
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:22,020
 and you can do alphabetically or by genre, no, she didn't.

1256
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:23,500
 - Do you know when that lasted until?

1257
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,820
 - That lasted till 1999.

1258
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:27,540
 - No. - Yeah.

1259
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:29,620
 - We should say because it sounds like we're slamming them,

1260
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:30,900
 but falls obviously amazing,

1261
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,260
 and also all this information

1262
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:34,660
 is on the most brilliant page on their website.

1263
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:36,060
 So they're one of these sites

1264
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:39,020
 that obviously has some amazing research

1265
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:39,940
 are working for them,

1266
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:41,180
 and they've got a really good site

1267
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:43,780
 falls bookshop of their history and stories and foils.

1268
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:44,620
 - Yeah, she's got that.

1269
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:46,420
 - She died in 1999, Christina,

1270
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:47,980
 and she really was the end of an era,

1271
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:49,820
 but after she died, they had a refit

1272
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:53,460
 in which they discovered a lift that nobody knew about.

1273
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:54,300
 (laughing)

1274
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:55,140
 - Wow. - Yeah.

1275
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:56,420
 - Where did it go?

1276
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:57,740
 - Up and down, mostly.

1277
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:59,780
 (laughing)

1278
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:10,380
 - And it's just moved like a year ago,

1279
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:13,460
 so it was in this iconic spot on Charing Cross Road,

1280
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:14,580
 still on Charing Cross Road,

1281
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:15,540
 but it's moved down the road.

1282
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:18,340
 But apparently, and I went to it many times,

1283
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:20,460
 I'm sure you guys did as well.

1284
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:23,500
 It was a labyrinth of these different weird,

1285
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:25,060
 tiny crevices you could get,

1286
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:27,860
 you find yourself hours going a new spot in the bookshop,

1287
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:29,580
 you didn't know existed, and they had,

1288
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:31,740
 it was a sort of in joke amongst the shop,

1289
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:33,940
 because they had an in-house staff magazine,

1290
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:36,180
 and they always had a lost property section

1291
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:38,980
 in the, you know, lost and found,

1292
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:41,460
 and one of the things that they wrote was found,

1293
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:42,620
 Paul Potter of Made-A-Vale,

1294
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:45,100
 after wandering for an hour, trying to find his way out.

1295
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:47,540
 And that happened, that happened a lot,

1296
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:49,540
 where people, customers would just get lost,

1297
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:51,020
 and you know, the partners would be like,

1298
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:52,500
 have you seen my husband and are like,

1299
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:54,500
 do you have an hour, 'cause we will,

1300
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:57,060
 we will find his, your husband, 'cause we may have him.

1301
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:59,980
 (audience laughing)

1302
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:03,460
 So Christina ran the bookshop after her father, William,

1303
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:06,260
 retired in 1945, and she ran it into the '90s,

1304
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:09,500
 and she claimed that she read an entire book every day,

1305
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:11,940
 had never done her own housework, all cooking,

1306
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:14,140
 and she only ever drank champagne.

1307
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:18,460
 She was asked what would happen if she lost her chef,

1308
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:20,620
 and she said there was always milk, champagne,

1309
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:22,300
 and smoked salmon in the fridge.

1310
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:25,060
 (audience laughing)

1311
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:26,260
 Mine can't.

1312
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:27,700
 - Yeah. - No, really?

1313
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:29,380
 (audience laughing)

1314
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:31,780
 - Current bestseller rank on Amazon.

1315
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:32,620
 - Yeah.

1316
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:36,300
 - 1,471,284.

1317
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:37,140
 - Okay.

1318
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:38,180
 - So they're beating us, aren't they?

1319
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:41,180
 (audience laughing)

1320
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:42,900
 They, the mine can't team.

1321
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:44,420
 (audience laughing)

1322
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:48,820
 - But it's not even in the top 700 in the fascism category.

1323
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:49,660
 - Oh!

1324
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:51,940
 - It's not for the 700 in the world.

1325
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:54,460
 - That's fascism. - That's gotta hurt.

1326
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:57,700
 - But fascism and Nazi books do sell.

1327
00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:00,180
 There's a famous story about Alan Koran,

1328
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:02,940
 the famous woodcissed and father of Victoria Koran,

1329
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:05,700
 and he'd noticed that the most popular titles in Britain

1330
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:08,900
 in those days were about cats, gulf, and Nazis,

1331
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:12,060
 and so he called his book "Gulfing for Cats"

1332
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:14,220
 and put a massive swastika on the cover.

1333
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:17,220
 (audience laughing)

1334
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:21,740
 The one thing I didn't know about mine camp

1335
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:24,140
 is that it hadn't a company in picture book.

1336
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:25,140
 (audience laughing)

1337
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:25,980
 Not even kidding.

1338
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:26,820
 - Really?

1339
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:29,140
 - It was called "The Hitler Nobody Knows,"

1340
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:32,020
 and it was designed to improve Hitler's public image,

1341
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:34,260
 'cause his image was very, very bad at the start,

1342
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:35,340
 'cause obviously he was a thug

1343
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:37,860
 and he'd organized putches and things like that.

1344
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:39,180
 - He didn't get much better, did he?

1345
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:41,660
 - He didn't get much better, but this in Germany

1346
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:44,260
 turned around the public image of him a lot,

1347
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:46,020
 'cause it was like a family album.

1348
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:48,220
 It began with photos of him as a baby,

1349
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:49,300
 and photos of him as a--

1350
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:51,020
 - He still had a tiny little mustache.

1351
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:53,300
 (audience laughing)

1352
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:54,820
 - Ironically, he looked like Churchill.

1353
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:57,860
 (audience laughing)

1354
00:45:57,860 --> 00:45:59,540
 But it was massively popular.

1355
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:02,300
 It sold over 400,000 copies by 1942.

1356
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:04,900
 - And this was, came along with mine camp--

1357
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:07,740
 - No, it was another of the works designed

1358
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:08,820
 to improve his public image.

1359
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:10,540
 So it wasn't a buy one, get one, free thing,

1360
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:11,780
 or anything like that, but yeah.

1361
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:13,580
 - 'Cause they've released a manga version

1362
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:18,580
 of mine camp now, and someone here is a huge fan.

1363
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:21,140
 (audience laughing)

1364
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:23,740
 - So is Hitler portrayed as Japanese in it?

1365
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:27,900
 - I think he is, yes, I assume he is.

1366
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:30,140
 So this is weirdly in Japan and Turkey.

1367
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:32,220
 There are manga versions of mine camp,

1368
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:34,420
 and it was introduced a few years ago in Japan,

1369
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:37,580
 and it sold 45,000 copies to bizarre.

1370
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:39,660
 And then in India, there's a version

1371
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:42,860
 which is used for business and management students

1372
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:44,140
 who advised to read it.

1373
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:45,780
 - It seemed very different over there, I think,

1374
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:47,940
 'cause they were quite geographically detached

1375
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:51,060
 from the things that happened in World War II in Europe.

1376
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:52,900
 And they don't really get taught about the Holocaust

1377
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:54,340
 as much as we do and stuff like that.

1378
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:56,140
 So they just sit completely differently.

1379
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:58,740
 So in India, they have a Hitler Cafe,

1380
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:02,100
 a Hitler fashion store, and Hitler ice cream.

1381
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:03,260
 - Really?

1382
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:04,100
 - Yeah.

1383
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:06,340
 (audience laughing)

1384
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:08,180
 - We need to wrap up very shortly.

1385
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:09,340
 Do you guys have anything before we do?

1386
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:10,940
 - I've one more story, it's about foils though.

1387
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:11,780
 - Yeah, yeah.

1388
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:12,980
 - It's Christopher Foil, who took over

1389
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:14,860
 from his aunt, Christina.

1390
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:17,220
 It's just an anecdote he told about a time

1391
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:19,900
 when he was working in the shop and he wrestled a shop lifter.

1392
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:21,860
 And I just wanted to tell you it 'cause I love it.

1393
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:24,860
 He said, he chased him out of the shop, he saw him leaving,

1394
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:27,020
 and they got into Soho Square right nearby.

1395
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:29,260
 And he said, I was very calm, very friendly.

1396
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:31,540
 I said, excuse me, I think you might have some books there.

1397
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:33,660
 You didn't pay for, would you like to come back to foils

1398
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:35,260
 and we'll just discuss it?

1399
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:37,300
 Anyway, at that point, they usually come back quietly,

1400
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:39,140
 all they lash out or run away or whatever.

1401
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:40,540
 This chap lashed out.

1402
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:42,820
 I remember, he kept on trying to kick me in the groin.

1403
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:45,060
 So what I did was, with one hand, I held him away from me

1404
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:46,300
 by the knot of his tie.

1405
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:49,460
 By the other, I held him by the end of his tie.

1406
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:50,940
 Anyway, we ended up grappling and I remember

1407
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:52,820
 we were rolling around in the gutter in the next moment.

1408
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:54,300
 I found myself being hauled to my feet

1409
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:56,300
 by a burly policeman and he by another.

1410
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:57,660
 The curious thing about this man was,

1411
00:47:57,660 --> 00:47:59,700
 they were books on breaking codes and ciphers.

1412
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:02,260
 It turned out, he was an officer in MI5.

1413
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:05,500
 (audience laughing)

1414
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:09,100
 Okay, should we wrap up guys?

1415
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:09,940
 We're gonna wrap up.

1416
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:11,100
 Okay, that is it.

1417
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:12,780
 That is all of our facts.

1418
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:14,220

 We also have a link to our book, The Book of the Year,

 which is out now and we're about to give a copy of it

1432
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:45,060
 away to a member of the audience here tonight in Dunstable.

1433
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:46,860
 We've picked out our favorite fact from the ones

1434
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:49,740
 that you guys sent in and have we got it here who was,

1435
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:50,900
 who was, I got it.

1436
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:53,100
 And I'm just going to take my phone off airplane.

1437
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:54,140
 Oh, Jesus.

1438
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:56,020
 I'm really, I am, can I do it?

1439
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:57,340
 Shall I do another Hitler fact?

1440
00:48:57,340 --> 00:48:58,180
 - Yes.

1441
00:48:58,180 --> 00:48:59,020
 - Great.

1442
00:48:59,020 --> 00:48:59,860
 - Yep.

1443
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:00,860
 Thank you.

1444
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:03,460
 - So during the Iran hostage crisis,

1445
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:06,260
 the CIA managed to sneak some agents into Tehran

1446
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:08,740
 and they had false German passports.

1447
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:10,860
 Okay, and one of the agents was stopped

1448
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:12,540
 by the customs officials and they said,

1449
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:14,380
 "Something's wrong with your passport."

1450
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:16,940
 They said, "This is the first time I've seen a German passport

1451
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:20,260
 "which has a middle initial instead of a full name."

1452
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:24,220
 And they said, "Your name is given as Joseph H. Schmidt."

1453
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:26,780
 And the guy was, "Oh my God, I'm going to get caught."

1454
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:28,340
 And then he suddenly came up with a brainwave

1455
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:30,740
 and he said, "Well, oh yeah, when I was born,

1456
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:32,940
 "they gave me my middle name as Hitler

1457
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:35,460
 "and I have a special permission not to use it."

1458
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:37,260
 (audience laughs)

1459
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:38,260
 That's clever, isn't it?

1460
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:39,260
 - Yeah, that's good.

1461
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:40,260
 - Did they buy it?

1462
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:41,100
 - Yeah, they bought it.

1463
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:41,940
 - Oh, nice.

1464
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:46,020
 - And Joseph H was H Henry, by any chance, you know?

1465
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:47,460
 - It was a made-up name, done.

1466
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:50,460
 (audience laughs)

1467
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:55,500
 - How's the fact finally going, Andy?

1468
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:56,340
 - It's fun.

1469
00:49:56,340 --> 00:49:57,540
 - It's fun.

1470
00:49:57,540 --> 00:49:58,820
 - Great, let's get it out.

1471
00:49:58,820 --> 00:50:01,740
 - This is from, it's one of the ones that came in on Twitter

1472
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:04,580
 and it's from @gtomorrow, you in?

1473
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:05,780
 - Hey. - Oh, hey.

1474
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:07,740
 - And, well, we all loved it so much.

1475
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:11,060
 Is that the French language has 17 different words

1476
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:12,780
 for surrender?

1477
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:16,140
 (audience laughs)

1478
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:18,780
 - Nice, coming, collect your book from us at the end.

1479
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:19,620
 (audience applauds)

1480
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:21,500
 - Thanks so much, guys, we'll see you later.

1481
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:22,340
 Good night!

1482
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:25,340
 (audience cheers and applauds)

1483
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:27,940
 (upbeat music)

1484
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:30,940
 (audience applauds)

1485
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:33,520
 (upbeat music)

1486
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:36,100
 (upbeat music)
