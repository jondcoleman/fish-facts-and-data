00:00:02,00:00:04,"- Hey everyone, welcome to this week's episode of Fish."
00:00:04,00:00:06,"Before we begin, we've just got a bit of announcement,"
00:00:06,00:00:08,really exciting announcement.
00:00:08,00:00:11,We are releasing a behind-the-scenes documentary
00:00:11,00:00:14,that was filmed during our 2017 tour of the UK.
00:00:14,00:00:18,"And it's us on buses, it's us ironing sharks."
00:00:18,00:00:19,It's us.
00:00:19,00:00:21,"- Can I just say, Dad, it's buses."
00:00:21,00:00:23,"It's not just like buses that the public go on, is it?"
00:00:23,00:00:25,It's not like we're on the 19 bus to Angel.
00:00:25,00:00:27,"- Yeah, and actually it's not even plural buses."
00:00:27,00:00:29,"It's one bus, which is actually a van."
00:00:29,00:00:33,"So it's, I'm just trying to big it up here."
00:00:33,00:00:35,"What it is, is if you ever wanted to see what it's like"
00:00:35,00:00:37,when we actually go out on the road
00:00:37,00:00:39,and we visit all these places in the UK
00:00:39,00:00:41,"and put on these shows, it's a sort of just"
00:00:41,00:00:42,little background insight.
00:00:42,00:00:47,"It's like a very less, less funny version of spinal tap."
00:00:47,00:00:50,"- Yeah, if you wanna know some kind of like"
00:00:50,00:00:53,weird twisted secrets from Andy's past
00:00:53,00:00:55,or some weird twisted secrets from James's past
00:00:55,00:00:58,"or some perfectly normal innocent secrets from my past,"
00:00:58,00:01:00,"that they're all in there, there's some interviews,"
00:01:00,00:01:03,we were interviewed and there's some of us
00:01:03,00:01:04,"just pissing around, really."
00:01:04,00:01:06,"- Yeah, this is gonna be available on Monday,"
00:01:06,00:01:10,"the 29th and January, it's gonna be online exclusively."
00:01:10,00:01:12,"That's right, we said no to H&B."
00:01:12,00:01:13,- What about people who aren't online?
00:01:13,00:01:16,- They will live in ignorance.
00:01:16,00:01:18,- This will bring the last of the world onto the internet.
00:01:18,00:01:19,(laughing)
00:01:19,00:01:22,"- Yeah, you can get it on iTunes this Monday"
00:01:22,00:01:23,and you'll be able to get it from Google Play
00:01:23,00:01:25,on Amazon in the very near future.
00:01:25,00:01:27,It's 1.49 per episode and it's 4.99
00:01:27,00:01:29,for the bundle of four.
00:01:29,00:01:30,- And what's it called?
00:01:30,00:01:32,"- This is the highlight, Andy."
00:01:32,00:01:33,(laughing)
00:01:33,00:01:35,This is why we deliberately saved this to a last.
00:01:35,00:01:37,- Yeah.
00:01:37,00:01:38,- Should we all say it together?
00:01:38,00:01:39,- Sure.
00:01:39,00:01:41,- It's called the highlight.
00:01:41,00:01:43,- The highlight. - No such thing as a fit.
00:01:43,00:01:45,Present behind the gills.
00:01:45,00:01:47,"- It's called behind the gills, get it, get it now."
00:01:47,00:01:49,"- Yeah. - Okay, on with the show."
00:01:49,00:01:53,- Do we have a saying behind the gills clearly enough?
00:01:53,00:01:54,It's called behind the gills.
00:01:54,00:01:57,(upbeat music)
00:01:57,00:01:58,"- Hold on, hold on."
00:01:58,00:02:01,(upbeat music)
00:02:01,00:02:11,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:02:11,00:02:14,"of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast,"
00:02:14,00:02:16,this week coming to you from Dunstable.
00:02:16,00:02:19,(audience cheering)
00:02:19,00:02:22,(audience cheering)
00:02:22,00:02:31,- My name is Dan Schreiber and I am sitting here
00:02:31,00:02:34,"with Anna Chazinski, Andrew Hunter Murray"
00:02:34,00:02:35,and James Harkin.
00:02:35,00:02:38,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:02:38,00:02:40,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days
00:02:40,00:02:42,and in no particular order.
00:02:42,00:02:45,"Here we go, starting with you, James Harkin."
00:02:45,00:02:49,"- Okay, my fact this week is the King Ferdinand of Bulgaria"
00:02:49,00:02:53,was so scared of being murdered on the Oriental Express
00:02:53,00:02:55,that he locked himself in the toilet.
00:02:55,00:02:57,(audience laughing)
00:02:57,00:03:00,"- Had he read the book, is that why?"
00:03:00,00:03:03,"- So amazingly enough, this happened at the turn"
00:03:03,00:03:06,"of the 20th century, so it happened before the book."
00:03:06,00:03:08,"So the book came out, before the book,"
00:03:08,00:03:11,"which came out in 1934 and before the film,"
00:03:11,00:03:12,which came out two weeks ago.
00:03:12,00:03:16,(audience laughing)
00:03:16,00:03:16,- Wow. - Did he lock himself
00:03:16,00:03:18,in the toilet for the whole journey?
00:03:18,00:03:18,- Do we know?
00:03:18,00:03:20,"- No, well we know that he definitely didn't do it"
00:03:20,00:03:22,for the whole journey because one thing we do know
00:03:22,00:03:25,"is that as soon as they got into Bulgaria,"
00:03:25,00:03:27,he decided he wanted to drive the train.
00:03:27,00:03:30,(audience laughing)
00:03:30,00:03:33,"- And isn't it the case that when he got given the controls,"
00:03:33,00:03:36,I know that it's very hard to mess up driving a train
00:03:36,00:03:39,"'cause you're on a track, but he would put the speed up"
00:03:39,00:03:43,'cause he was a speed freak and it would go exceptionally fast
00:03:43,00:03:45,and they were worried that it was gonna derail
00:03:45,00:03:46,because he was just loving the...
00:03:46,00:03:47,"- Yeah, that's true."
00:03:47,00:03:49,- Do we know why he was so...
00:03:49,00:03:51,"I mean, were people after his head"
00:03:51,00:03:54,or were trains just known for murdering the olden days?
00:03:54,00:03:55,- It's a bit of the first bit actually
00:03:55,00:03:59,because it was just after he'd become king
00:03:59,00:04:02,and he was known as Foxy Ferdinand.
00:04:02,00:04:03,- Oh.
00:04:03,00:04:06,- And he was known as that 'cause he was a bit of a dandy.
00:04:06,00:04:09,"Okay, and to start with, he wasn't very popular."
00:04:09,00:04:12,"For instance, Queen Victoria said he is totally unfit,"
00:04:12,00:04:15,"delicate, eccentric and effeminate"
00:04:15,00:04:17,and he should be stopped at once.
00:04:17,00:04:18,(audience laughing)
00:04:18,00:04:19,- Wow.
00:04:19,00:04:21,"- And in his country, by the end, they loved him,"
00:04:21,00:04:23,"but to start off with, he was quite unpopular."
00:04:23,00:04:24,"- He was, wasn't he?"
00:04:24,00:04:26,"He was sort of a wimp, I think."
00:04:26,00:04:27,- That's right.
00:04:27,00:04:29,- So his mum seemed to control a lot of his life.
00:04:29,00:04:32,"Like, for instance, his mum got him the job as king"
00:04:32,00:04:32,and it...
00:04:32,00:04:34,(audience laughing)
00:04:34,00:04:37,"- I mean, that is how monarchy works, I think."
00:04:37,00:04:39,(audience laughing)
00:04:39,00:04:41,"- Well, that's not how he worked here, is it?"
00:04:41,00:04:42,Because...
00:04:42,00:04:43,- It's not.
00:04:43,00:04:44,She bought him the job.
00:04:44,00:04:46,"- So Bulgaria, it was very unpopular"
00:04:46,00:04:48,the job as king of Bulgaria at that point.
00:04:48,00:04:50,"'Cause I think there was a lot of controversy,"
00:04:50,00:04:54,there was a lot of intrigue and corruption in royal circles.
00:04:54,00:04:56,"So the job, actually, the throne, as they called it,"
00:04:56,00:04:58,was offered to a bunch of other people
00:04:58,00:04:59,before it was offered to him.
00:04:59,00:05:01,So it was offered to the princes of Denmark
00:05:01,00:05:04,"to princes from the Caucasus, to the king of Romania."
00:05:04,00:05:07,"And they all said, no, I think I'm all right, thanks."
00:05:07,00:05:11,"And so eventually, Foxyford announced mum said,"
00:05:11,00:05:12,"all right, if I give you this amount of money,"
00:05:12,00:05:14,will you let my son be king?
00:05:14,00:05:16,"- Of this place, and that's how he got there."
00:05:16,00:05:17,It was just so embarrassing.
00:05:17,00:05:20,- King Edward of Britain died in 1910.
00:05:20,00:05:23,And Foxyford was on the way to the funeral.
00:05:23,00:05:25,And he got a massive argument
00:05:25,00:05:28,over where his private railway carriage should go
00:05:28,00:05:30,"in the train, because things of precedence,"
00:05:30,00:05:31,"he thought, well, my carriage should obviously"
00:05:31,00:05:33,be right at the front behind the driver.
00:05:33,00:05:36,And he lost to Archduke Franz Ferdinand.
00:05:36,00:05:38,So Archduke Franz Ferdinand got his carriage
00:05:38,00:05:39,to go right behind the driver.
00:05:39,00:05:43,But that meant that Archduke would have to pass
00:05:43,00:05:46,through King Ferdinand's carriage to get to the dining car.
00:05:46,00:05:48,And Ferdinand just locked the door.
00:05:48,00:05:50,(audience laughing)
00:05:50,00:05:53,"He just said, no, you're not coming through."
00:05:53,00:05:54,"- But things still worked out, okay,"
00:05:54,00:05:55,"but Franz Ferdinand, didn't they?"
00:05:55,00:05:56,So. - I did.
00:05:56,00:05:59,- On the bright side.
00:05:59,00:06:00,It's actually a really nice thing.
00:06:00,00:06:02,"- It's too soon, weirdly."
00:06:02,00:06:03,(audience laughing)
00:06:03,00:06:04,- Is it?
00:06:04,00:06:06,"- I think when it's over 100 years, you're in the clear."
00:06:06,00:06:07,- Yeah.
00:06:07,00:06:08,- It's weird.
00:06:08,00:06:10,We have talked about him before.
00:06:10,00:06:11,"If you've listened to the podcast for a while,"
00:06:11,00:06:15,it's quite nice because one of our main podcast facts
00:06:15,00:06:18,about two years ago was that Kaiser Wilhelm
00:06:18,00:06:20,once slapped him on the bottom.
00:06:20,00:06:22,And he was so offended by this that he was gonna give him
00:06:22,00:06:25,"an arms contract, but then he gave it away to someone else."
00:06:25,00:06:27,"And in that show, we talked about Kaiser Wilhelm a lot."
00:06:27,00:06:28,So now we're kind of coming back.
00:06:28,00:06:30,"Like, if you did a series, you'd cover one."
00:06:30,00:06:32,"- Yeah, we've seen it from the other angle, aren't we?"
00:06:32,00:06:33,"- Oh, yeah."
00:06:33,00:06:35,He was very upset about the bottom slapping.
00:06:35,00:06:36,(audience laughing)
00:06:36,00:06:38,"- It's like that new episode of 50 Shades of Grey,"
00:06:38,00:06:40,isn't it from Grey's side?
00:06:40,00:06:41,- I didn't know that was what it was.
00:06:41,00:06:42,- And with a slapping part?
00:06:42,00:06:43,- Yes.
00:06:43,00:06:44,- Yeah.
00:06:44,00:06:47,"- A lot of body slapping in 50 Shades of Grey, I gather."
00:06:47,00:06:50,- I think it's written a bit different
00:06:50,00:06:54,"to how you just, he walked in, saw the body."
00:06:54,00:06:55,(audience laughing)
00:06:55,00:06:57,"That's getting a slap, he said."
00:06:57,00:06:59,(audience laughing)
00:06:59,00:07:01,"- Heal James, I really regret getting Andrew"
00:07:01,00:07:03,on tomorrow to ghost right in the second one.
00:07:03,00:07:06,(audience laughing)
00:07:06,00:07:10,"- I read another method of how a Bulgarian,"
00:07:10,00:07:14,"or in this case, all of Bulgaria, avoided being killed."
00:07:14,00:07:17,"And it is, and I've been assured that this is not true,"
00:07:17,00:07:18,but I think it's worth saying.
00:07:18,00:07:20,(audience laughing)
00:07:20,00:07:22,"And the nice thing is, we've now got that on tape,"
00:07:22,00:07:23,so you can stitch that before any fact
00:07:23,00:07:25,downstairs in the future ever.
00:07:25,00:07:26,(audience laughing)
00:07:26,00:07:28,"No, but so this is true in Bulgaria,"
00:07:28,00:07:31,"when a Bulgarian is signaling yes,"
00:07:31,00:07:33,"when you ask them a question,"
00:07:33,00:07:36,"they do it with a horizontal,"
00:07:36,00:07:36,they shake their head.
00:07:36,00:07:39,"They shake their head, as what we would know is no,"
00:07:39,00:07:40,they shake as a yes.
00:07:40,00:07:43,"And when you ask a question that is a yes answer,"
00:07:43,00:07:46,"they don't do a full nod, but they do an up,"
00:07:46,00:07:49,"which is what we would take to be yes, right?"
00:07:49,00:07:50,"- Is that, sorry, someone just said yes,"
00:07:50,00:07:52,and do we have a Bulgarian?
00:07:52,00:07:53,- That is true.
00:07:53,00:07:55,"- Yeah, so that, I know that, if we have a Bulgarian,"
00:07:55,00:07:56,"we won't know whether they are in the audience,"
00:07:56,00:07:58,'cause are you a Bulgarian?
00:07:58,00:07:59,(audience laughing)
00:07:59,00:08:02,"Well, well, confusingly, apparently,"
00:08:02,00:08:04,"if you're talking to a Bulgarian,"
00:08:04,00:08:06,"and they know that you're from some other country,"
00:08:06,00:08:10,"they then reappropriate it, so they do that, the opposite way."
00:08:10,00:08:11,"So it's very confusing, 'cause you don't know"
00:08:11,00:08:13,which one is the right answer to it.
00:08:13,00:08:15,This whole thing was about how they stopped being killed.
00:08:15,00:08:17,"- Yes, yes."
00:08:17,00:08:19,(audience laughing)
00:08:19,00:08:21,"So apparently, this goes back to the Ottoman times,"
00:08:21,00:08:24,and this is when Turks used to hold a sword
00:08:24,00:08:28,"to the neck of them and to the Bulgarians and ask them,"
00:08:28,00:08:31,"and it was on an angle to ask them, are you a Christian?"
00:08:31,00:08:34,"And to say that they were, they had to change it,"
00:08:34,00:08:36,because that was the most efficient way
00:08:36,00:08:38,to not slice their neck through movement
00:08:38,00:08:40,"of a sword being held tightly, 'cause they said it."
00:08:40,00:08:41,- They could have just said it.
00:08:41,00:08:43,(audience laughing)
00:08:43,00:08:48,"- Ah, they could have just said it."
00:08:48,00:08:51,"- Yeah, I didn't, that's why I was told it's not true."
00:08:51,00:08:52,Okay.
00:08:52,00:08:55,"- But we're saying, right?"
00:08:55,00:08:56,"- Oh, yeah, absolutely, yeah."
00:08:56,00:08:57,- He was absolutely worth saying.
00:08:57,00:08:58,"- Oh, yeah."
00:08:58,00:09:01,"- The Orient Express was amazing, though,"
00:09:01,00:09:02,even more amazing than that.
00:09:02,00:09:05,It was amazing because so many great people traveled on it.
00:09:05,00:09:09,"It was, if you were famous or if you were a world leader,"
00:09:09,00:09:10,then you traveled on it.
00:09:10,00:09:14,So King Leopold used it to transport himself
00:09:14,00:09:16,"to Constantinople, where he'd arranged,"
00:09:16,00:09:17,made some complicated arrangements
00:09:17,00:09:19,with a harem to infiltrate a harem.
00:09:19,00:09:21,So he get involved in that.
00:09:21,00:09:23,The president of France traveled on it at one point.
00:09:23,00:09:27,"This is actually in 1920, and in 1920,"
00:09:27,00:09:30,what happened was there was a guy working the signal box
00:09:30,00:09:32,and a man-brain per jammer stumbled up to him
00:09:32,00:09:33,"in the middle of the night and said,"
00:09:33,00:09:34,"""Hey, please help me."
00:09:34,00:09:36,I've just fallen off the train.
00:09:36,00:09:38,I've fallen out of the window and off the train.
00:09:38,00:09:39,"I'm the president of France."""
00:09:39,00:09:42,"And the guy in the signal box said,"
00:09:42,00:09:46,"and I'm Napoleon Bonaparte, according to those accounts,"
00:09:46,00:09:48,but it was actually the president of France.
00:09:48,00:09:50,It was Paul Deschanel of France.
00:09:50,00:09:52,"He'd fallen out of the window of the Orient Express,"
00:09:52,00:09:54,"and he had to resign very shortly afterwards,"
00:09:54,00:09:55,'cause it was so humiliating.
00:09:55,00:09:57,- No.
00:09:57,00:09:58,"- I mean, it was slightly to do that."
00:09:58,00:10:00,It was also slightly to do the fact
00:10:00,00:10:02,that he'd recently received the British ambassador
00:10:02,00:10:06,"to France naked, except for the ceremonial decorations"
00:10:06,00:10:10,"of his office, and that he'd walked out of a state meeting"
00:10:10,00:10:12,straight into a lake fully clothed.
00:10:12,00:10:13,(laughing)
00:10:13,00:10:15,- So it was a few of the circumstances going on there
00:10:15,00:10:17,as well as the Orient Express thing.
00:10:17,00:10:19,"- It was the straw that broke the camel's back,"
00:10:19,00:10:20,and it was-- - It was what he told his wife.
00:10:20,00:10:21,- It was the camel.
00:10:21,00:10:22,- It's when I fell off the train.
00:10:22,00:10:23,"That's what I did, it."
00:10:23,00:10:27,- I have some stuff about the luxury trains.
00:10:27,00:10:31,"- So did you know that in the early days of rail,"
00:10:31,00:10:33,lots of very wealthy people had their own
00:10:33,00:10:36,"private train carriages, and you could just pay"
00:10:36,00:10:39,and have your train carriage kind of put onto a train.
00:10:39,00:10:40,"- Oh, like the Queen has one of those, doesn't she?"
00:10:40,00:10:43,"- Well, she's got a whole train, in fact."
00:10:43,00:10:46,"But for example, there were private carriages,"
00:10:46,00:10:47,"and there were family carriages,"
00:10:47,00:10:49,which you could just get a carriage
00:10:49,00:10:50,"for just for you and your family,"
00:10:50,00:10:52,"and you would attach it to a train and then change it,"
00:10:52,00:10:55,"and at the start of the 20th century,"
00:10:55,00:10:58,"Manchester had several gentleman's club carriages,"
00:10:58,00:11:00,not in the spearment rhino sense guys.
00:11:00,00:11:03,"They would have clubs, you would pay a subscription,"
00:11:03,00:11:06,"and then you would get to use that railway carriage,"
00:11:06,00:11:08,"and there were lockers, and you had to be elected,"
00:11:08,00:11:10,"and you had to obey the rules, specifically the rules"
00:11:10,00:11:12,"about whether you could open the window or not,"
00:11:12,00:11:13,and when it was appropriate.
00:11:13,00:11:14,- Wow.
00:11:14,00:11:16,"- And you had to turn up to the station on time, presumably."
00:11:16,00:11:19,- You just had access to the train carriage
00:11:19,00:11:21,"if you joined the club, and there was a gentleman's club"
00:11:21,00:11:23,on wheels.
00:11:23,00:11:24,- Yeah. - Yeah.
00:11:24,00:11:25,"- Yeah, okay. - Fun."
00:11:25,00:11:27,Something.
00:11:27,00:11:29,"- Well, you know, it's nice to give James something to edit,"
00:11:29,00:11:30,isn't it?
00:11:30,00:11:31,(laughing)
00:11:31,00:11:34,- I think we're giving him too much to edit at this point.
00:11:34,00:11:35,(laughing)
00:11:35,00:11:38,"- You know, the orange express, the first murder"
00:11:38,00:11:39,that happened on the orange express
00:11:39,00:11:43,was the year after Agatha Christie published her novel.
00:11:43,00:11:44,- What's it? - Yeah.
00:11:44,00:11:47,"- Yeah, and also, do you know how the person was caught?"
00:11:47,00:11:48,"- No, no, what happened?"
00:11:48,00:11:50,"- It's a really cool story, so basically,"
00:11:50,00:11:52,"there was a woman who was pushed out of a window,"
00:11:52,00:11:54,so who was killed and then pushed out of a window.
00:11:54,00:11:56,"- There's no cool so far, Ernest."
00:11:56,00:11:58,(laughing)
00:11:58,00:11:59,- It's extremely harrowing.
00:11:59,00:12:00,- Sorry.
00:12:00,00:12:02,"- I'm so record, too soon."
00:12:02,00:12:05,(laughing)
00:12:05,00:12:08,"- Sorry, it was 1935, so it is a bit too soon."
00:12:08,00:12:09,"She was pushed out of the window,"
00:12:09,00:12:10,"and her body was found on the tracks,"
00:12:10,00:12:14,"and all of her possessions, except for a silver fox scarf,"
00:12:14,00:12:16,"so a foxkin scarf that she'd been wearing,"
00:12:16,00:12:19,"and then by total chance, so this got around"
00:12:19,00:12:20,"that the scarf was missing,"
00:12:20,00:12:22,"and a policeman in Switzerland,"
00:12:22,00:12:24,"a few weeks later, spotted a silver fox scarf"
00:12:24,00:12:26,"being worn by a woman, and then went up to her"
00:12:26,00:12:27,"and said, ""Where's she getting that?"""
00:12:27,00:12:29,"And she said, ""From this guy,"""
00:12:29,00:12:30,and it turned out that guy had done the murder.
00:12:30,00:12:31,- Wow.
00:12:31,00:12:33,"- Sorry, the murderer gave it to me."
00:12:33,00:12:34,- The murderer.
00:12:34,00:12:35,- Yeah.
00:12:35,00:12:37,- I got it from a guy who called himself Mr. Murderer.
00:12:37,00:12:40,- It's crazy to give away the one bit of evidence
00:12:40,00:12:43,"that links you to a crime, to a random person."
00:12:43,00:12:44,"- It was pretty stupid, wasn't it?"
00:12:44,00:12:45,- It was very stupid.
00:12:45,00:12:46,- Yeah.
00:12:46,00:12:48,- So the surrender at the end of World War I
00:12:48,00:12:50,"was signed on the Orritic Express,"
00:12:50,00:12:53,"but it was signed in a particular carriage,"
00:12:53,00:12:56,which in 1940 Hitler ordered to be hauled
00:12:56,00:12:58,"to the precise spot where it happened,"
00:12:58,00:13:02,and that's where he organized the terms of the French surrender.
00:13:02,00:13:03,- He wasn't absolutely dead.
00:13:03,00:13:05,- He was such a prick.
00:13:05,00:13:08,"- And I was saying, hey, you've just beat him front, okay?"
00:13:08,00:13:09,A great military power.
00:13:09,00:13:11,You don't need to go on about it.
00:13:11,00:13:13,"Even by Hitler's standards, that's pretty petty, isn't it?"
00:13:13,00:13:14,- It's so petty.
00:13:14,00:13:16,And do you know what he did next?
00:13:16,00:13:17,"When he started losing the war,"
00:13:17,00:13:19,"he had that drain carriage blown up,"
00:13:19,00:13:21,so they couldn't make him surrender in it again.
00:13:21,00:13:22,"- Oh, what?"
00:13:22,00:13:24,"- Hitler, forget the drain carriage."
00:13:24,00:13:25,- Oh man.
00:13:25,00:13:27,"- God, the more I hear about this guy."
00:13:27,00:13:30,(audience laughing)
00:13:30,00:13:33,"- We need to move on to our second fact, guys."
00:13:33,00:13:34,- I just have one tiny thing.
00:13:34,00:13:35,"- Yeah, yeah, go for it."
00:13:35,00:13:37,- This is about the Queen's private train.
00:13:37,00:13:38,She's got the royal train.
00:13:38,00:13:40,And it's actually pretty doubly inside.
00:13:40,00:13:42,It's not really blingy and Louis XIV-ish.
00:13:42,00:13:44,It's pretty cool and calm.
00:13:44,00:13:46,"Anyway, there's just one thing that happened in it,"
00:13:46,00:13:47,which I really like.
00:13:47,00:13:50,So it travels around the country to pick up the royals
00:13:50,00:13:51,and drop them off and so on.
00:13:51,00:13:53,"And once, it was on its way to pick up Prince Charles"
00:13:53,00:13:55,for a royal function.
00:13:55,00:13:57,And it stopped very briefly at a station.
00:13:57,00:13:59,But nobody noticed a middle-aged woman
00:13:59,00:14:01,on the platform to see it and get on.
00:14:01,00:14:05,And she just sat at one of the tables in the dining car.
00:14:05,00:14:06,"And it is quite well-decorated, not good."
00:14:06,00:14:08,It's not a standard train.
00:14:08,00:14:09,And she just sat there and a member of staff
00:14:09,00:14:10,"was walking through and said,"
00:14:10,00:14:12,"""You do know this is the Queen's train, don't you?"""
00:14:12,00:14:14,"And she said, ""No, I did not know that."""
00:14:14,00:14:16,(audience laughing)
00:14:16,00:14:17,"""I'm sorry, when do we get to slow?"""
00:14:17,00:14:20,(audience laughing)
00:14:20,00:14:21,And she was given some light refreshments
00:14:21,00:14:23,and then escorted off at the next stop.
00:14:23,00:14:26,"Ah, I shouldn't let her stay."
00:14:26,00:14:28,"And she's out there somewhere,"
00:14:28,00:14:30,but she knows the other side of this story.
00:14:30,00:14:31,Let's move on to our next fact.
00:14:31,00:14:34,"Okay, it is time for fact number two."
00:14:34,00:14:35,And that is my fact.
00:14:35,00:14:37,My fact this week is that the new goalie
00:14:37,00:14:41,"of the ice hockey team, the Belfast Giants,"
00:14:41,00:14:42,is allergic to ice.
00:14:42,00:14:45,(audience laughing)
00:14:45,00:14:46,- It's allergic to ice.
00:14:46,00:14:47,"- Ice, amazing."
00:14:47,00:14:51,"- Yeah, and how do we know he's allergic to ice?"
00:14:51,00:14:54,"- He's told us, they noticed when after a match,"
00:14:54,00:14:56,he went into a really cold bath.
00:14:56,00:14:59,"And as he was sitting in the ice cold bath that they have,"
00:14:59,00:15:00,he was breaking out on top.
00:15:00,00:15:04,"And then the breakout, which was sort of raised red lumps,"
00:15:04,00:15:06,got really dark below and they quickly got him out.
00:15:06,00:15:08,"And they said, ""You have this disease,"
00:15:08,00:15:12,"which is a condition of, you're just allergic"
00:15:12,00:15:15,"to cold temperatures, you're highly sensitive to it."""
00:15:15,00:15:19,"And so as a result, when he is playing on the ice,"
00:15:19,00:15:21,he can't stay still.
00:15:21,00:15:23,He has to keep his blood circulating
00:15:23,00:15:24,and moving around and so on.
00:15:24,00:15:26,"Yeah, so when the game is going on"
00:15:26,00:15:30,"on the other side of the ice, what's it?"
00:15:30,00:15:32,"Rink, the rink, the rink."
00:15:32,00:15:36,"He's there, sort of just."
00:15:36,00:15:37,- 'Cause the other side of the ice implies
00:15:37,00:15:39,"a underside of the ice, isn't it?"
00:15:39,00:15:40,"- Yeah, yeah, that's okay."
00:15:40,00:15:43,- So this guy's called Chris Truel
00:15:43,00:15:44,and he started playing with the Belfast Giant.
00:15:44,00:15:47,So I believe he's a junior goalie.
00:15:47,00:15:49,"He's, so there's three of them."
00:15:49,00:15:52,"And yeah, so he just constantly has to move around."
00:15:52,00:15:53,"Otherwise-- - He's goalie, that's the thing."
00:15:53,00:15:54,So does he sometimes have to move around
00:15:54,00:15:56,out of the goal mouth?
00:15:56,00:15:57,- This is the problem.
00:15:57,00:15:58,- Yeah.
00:15:58,00:16:00,"- I mean, I, yeah, I don't know if it is a problem,"
00:16:00,00:16:02,but I assume that that is a problem.
00:16:02,00:16:03,Sounds like a problem.
00:16:03,00:16:04,"- Yeah, it does, doesn't it?"
00:16:04,00:16:06,"- He's not, he's really cool about it though."
00:16:06,00:16:07,"If you watch an interview,"
00:16:07,00:16:08,he's very much like he's not--
00:16:08,00:16:08,- But he's not too cool.
00:16:08,00:16:11,- He's not too cool at all. - He's not too cool at all.
00:16:11,00:16:13,"- Yeah, it's an allergy to the cold, right?"
00:16:13,00:16:15,"It's not, 'cause there's a different allergy,"
00:16:15,00:16:18,"which is an allergy to water,"
00:16:18,00:16:20,which is like you can be allergic to your own tears
00:16:20,00:16:20,"and stuff, can't you?"
00:16:20,00:16:24,"So every time you cry, you then cry even more."
00:16:24,00:16:26,"But it's not that, it's the coldness of it."
00:16:26,00:16:27,"- Yeah, it's cool."
00:16:27,00:16:29,"So I've been avoid saying the word 'cause I can't,"
00:16:29,00:16:32,"I can't pronounce it, but it's erotic carrier."
00:16:32,00:16:33,"That's the, is that a dire pronoun?"
00:16:33,00:16:35,"- Yeah, erotic carrier, that's the condition"
00:16:35,00:16:36,that he has.
00:16:36,00:16:39,- The test for it is very simple.
00:16:39,00:16:41,The doctor will just hold a piece of ice against you
00:16:41,00:16:43,and then see if you come out in a red lump.
00:16:43,00:16:45,"- Yeah, I mean, that makes sense, right?"
00:16:45,00:16:48,I'm not saying there's a better test.
00:16:48,00:16:50,"No, I mean, that literally is the test."
00:16:50,00:16:52,It's like finding out if you're allergic to bees
00:16:52,00:16:54,by doctor holding a bee to you and letting it--
00:16:54,00:16:57,- Is that the test for bee allergies?
00:16:57,00:16:59,- It seems like it couldn't be.
00:16:59,00:17:02,"The doctor doesn't say, ""Hey, eat a load of these walnuts"
00:17:02,00:17:05,"and we'll see what happens."" - Well, yeah."
00:17:05,00:17:06,"- All right, you're fine on those."
00:17:06,00:17:07,Let's see if you're allergic to wasps.
00:17:07,00:17:08,"Sorry, let's bring that up."
00:17:08,00:17:10,(laughing)
00:17:10,00:17:11,- Do you know what one way of selling
00:17:11,00:17:13,"if you've gotten allergic reaction is,"
00:17:13,00:17:14,which I'd never heard of?
00:17:14,00:17:16,Is something called baboon syndrome?
00:17:16,00:17:17,"- Oh, what's that?"
00:17:17,00:17:19,"- And that's, well, what would you guess?"
00:17:19,00:17:21,What's the defining filter?
00:17:21,00:17:24,"- You get a big, you get a big bum bum of red."
00:17:24,00:17:26,- Yeah.
00:17:26,00:17:27,"- Big, got 50 shades of grey again."
00:17:27,00:17:30,(laughing)
00:17:30,00:17:33,And he came in with a big bum bum of red.
00:17:33,00:17:35,(laughing)
00:17:35,00:17:37,"- Yeah, it's having a big red bum"
00:17:37,00:17:39,and it's one of the ways you can exhibit allergic reaction
00:17:39,00:17:40,"is bright red buttocks,"
00:17:40,00:17:43,a particularly penicillin reaction
00:17:43,00:17:44,or like a nickel reaction.
00:17:44,00:17:45,- Specifically to the bum.
00:17:45,00:17:46,- Specifically to the bum.
00:17:46,00:17:48,- And you can just have eaten some penicillin
00:17:48,00:17:49,and then your bum goes red.
00:17:49,00:17:50,- Yeah.
00:17:50,00:17:51,- It's amazing.
00:17:51,00:17:52,- It's amazing.
00:17:52,00:17:53,"- The boon syndrome, yeah."
00:17:53,00:17:56,- Over another ironic sports allergy.
00:17:56,00:17:56,"- Oh, yeah."
00:17:56,00:17:57,- There's a jocky.
00:17:57,00:17:58,A very young jocky called Sean Bowen.
00:17:58,00:18:01,He raced in the Grand National a couple of years ago.
00:18:01,00:18:03,"As a child, he was allergic to horses."
00:18:03,00:18:04,"And he grew up, he would get eczema."
00:18:04,00:18:06,"Any time he went near a horse,"
00:18:06,00:18:07,but then he grew out of it
00:18:07,00:18:09,and then he would practice by sitting on a sofa
00:18:09,00:18:10,and whipping it.
00:18:10,00:18:12,(laughing)
00:18:12,00:18:15,- He would sit on the arm of the sofa and thrash it.
00:18:15,00:18:16,"- Ah, that's so funny."
00:18:16,00:18:18,- Do you know who else was allergic to horses?
00:18:18,00:18:19,Clint Eastwood.
00:18:19,00:18:20,- No.
00:18:20,00:18:21,- No way.
00:18:21,00:18:23,"- All his movies, he had stunt doubles"
00:18:23,00:18:24,and he would do it but he would break out
00:18:24,00:18:26,if he was on a horse for too long.
00:18:26,00:18:28,"But yeah, Clint Eastwood allergic to horses."
00:18:28,00:18:30,- That's why he looks so pissed off all the time.
00:18:30,00:18:31,(laughing)
00:18:31,00:18:33,"- Hannah, before you were saying about the person"
00:18:33,00:18:36,"who was allergic to the wrong tears,"
00:18:36,00:18:39,there was a woman who was allergic to the allergy medicine
00:18:39,00:18:41,she took to deal with her allergies.
00:18:41,00:18:42,(laughing)
00:18:42,00:18:43,- Oh man.
00:18:43,00:18:46,"- So basically, she got ill with some other allergy"
00:18:46,00:18:48,and then she took an anti-histamine called Benadryl
00:18:48,00:18:51,"and then that caused her shortness of breath, wheezing"
00:18:51,00:18:53,and she went to hospital
00:18:53,00:18:54,"and then when she was in hospital,"
00:18:54,00:18:56,they gave her more Benadryl.
00:18:56,00:18:56,(laughing)
00:18:56,00:18:57,- Oh God.
00:18:57,00:18:58,- God.
00:18:58,00:18:59,- Oh my God.
00:18:59,00:19:03,"- That Harrison Schmidt, Apollo astronaut Harrison Schmidt,"
00:19:03,00:19:05,"one of the only people to land on the moon,"
00:19:05,00:19:07,was allergic to the moon.
00:19:07,00:19:07,- Oh yeah.
00:19:07,00:19:08,- Can you believe that though?
00:19:08,00:19:09,He was allergic to the moon.
00:19:09,00:19:10,So you might think that's really weird
00:19:10,00:19:13,because you're in a suit when you get onto the moon.
00:19:13,00:19:16,It was when he got back off the moon into the capsule
00:19:16,00:19:17,and they took the suit off
00:19:17,00:19:21,and supposedly the smellers of like gunpowder sort of smell.
00:19:21,00:19:23,That is what gave him the allergies
00:19:23,00:19:26,"and he broke out as well in sort of, in hype."
00:19:26,00:19:28,"So one of the only, and there's only 12 people"
00:19:28,00:19:29,who have landed on the moon
00:19:29,00:19:32,and one of them was allergic to the moon.
00:19:32,00:19:33,- That's amazing.
00:19:33,00:19:34,"- That's pretty huge, right?"
00:19:34,00:19:36,And there's no way of testing before you go.
00:19:36,00:19:37,- How do you test?
00:19:37,00:19:38,- How do you test?
00:19:38,00:19:42,"- Tennis player, Layton Hewitt, allergic to grass"
00:19:42,00:19:45,as in the floor of the windowed in courts.
00:19:45,00:19:46,"Yeah, not weed."
00:19:46,00:19:49,- You know horses can be allergic to grass.
00:19:49,00:19:50,- Horses can be allergic to grass.
00:19:50,00:19:51,"- Yeah, yeah, horses get allergic to grass"
00:19:51,00:19:54,"and they have to, it's really sad."
00:19:54,00:19:55,So there's a woman who's got a horse
00:19:55,00:19:56,and you have to cover them
00:19:56,00:19:59,and this big anti-allergy sock from head to toe.
00:19:59,00:20:03,"And they get allergic to, you get allergies to grass"
00:20:03,00:20:07,"and hay and seeds, all the nuts and seeds that they get fed."
00:20:07,00:20:10,- It's amazing that you can describe a murder
00:20:10,00:20:13,"as pretty cool, but a horse wearing a giant sock"
00:20:13,00:20:14,is somehow really sad.
00:20:14,00:20:15,- I know.
00:20:15,00:20:18,- It's because they get weepy.
00:20:18,00:20:20,They genuinely get weepy.
00:20:20,00:20:23,They cry tears and they get itchy and they get sneezy.
00:20:23,00:20:26,- Which of the other dwarfs do they get?
00:20:26,00:20:28,(laughing)
00:20:28,00:20:34,- The cure for it is to rub on some doc.
00:20:34,00:20:35,(laughing)
00:20:35,00:20:36,- There we go.
00:20:36,00:20:39,- That's good. - That's good.
00:20:39,00:20:42,"- So if you're hypersensitive of the whole of just everything,"
00:20:42,00:20:44,"like electricity and stuff,"
00:20:44,00:20:46,you can go to a town in America.
00:20:46,00:20:49,"It's in Arizona, it's called Snowflake."
00:20:49,00:20:50,- No. - Okay.
00:20:50,00:20:52,"And it doesn't get its name because it's full of snowflakes,"
00:20:52,00:20:54,"like moaning millennial, so whatever."
00:20:54,00:20:57,It gets its name because it was founded by two people
00:20:57,00:21:00,called Araster Snow and William Jordan Flake.
00:21:00,00:21:02,- No way.
00:21:02,00:21:04,(laughing)
00:21:04,00:21:04,- What?
00:21:04,00:21:05,- That's incredible.
00:21:05,00:21:06,- Isn't that amazing?
00:21:06,00:21:08,- But do you think they thought we'd better found something now
00:21:08,00:21:09,because we've met?
00:21:09,00:21:10,- What do you think Flake Snow?
00:21:10,00:21:11,- Yeah.
00:21:11,00:21:13,(laughing)
00:21:13,00:21:17,"- Wait, so they founded a town for people to escape their allergies?"
00:21:17,00:21:19,"- No, they founded a town they were Mormon pioneers,"
00:21:19,00:21:22,but they founded it well away from cities and stuff like that.
00:21:22,00:21:25,So if you're allergic to wifi and all you think you are
00:21:25,00:21:26,"and electricity and stuff like that,"
00:21:26,00:21:28,then this is a place where you can go and be away from that.
00:21:28,00:21:29,- Where did you say it was?
00:21:29,00:21:30,- It's in Arizona.
00:21:30,00:21:31,- Arizona.
00:21:31,00:21:32,"- Oh, yeah, really remote."
00:21:32,00:21:33,- Some of it is.
00:21:33,00:21:33,- Yeah.
00:21:33,00:21:34,- Phoenix.
00:21:34,00:21:35,- Phoenix.
00:21:35,00:21:37,"- When was that, was that 19th century originally?"
00:21:37,00:21:41,"- Well, it was founded in 1878 where people are going there now."
00:21:41,00:21:44,- But this was a real thing when allergies came into the world.
00:21:44,00:21:46,"Hey, we don't know how they appeared in the world."
00:21:46,00:21:48,It was in the 19th century.
00:21:48,00:21:50,And then beat it became a really fashionable thing
00:21:50,00:21:51,because it was the wealthier classes
00:21:51,00:21:53,"that were allergic to stuff, wasn't it?"
00:21:53,00:21:56,And so they began to be hay fever holidays
00:21:56,00:21:57,that were recommended.
00:21:57,00:21:59,"And that would be if you lived in New York,"
00:21:59,00:22:01,the idea was that you were getting allergic reactions
00:22:01,00:22:03,to the city like you say.
00:22:03,00:22:06,"So Lake Superior and the White Mountain, New Hampshire,"
00:22:06,00:22:08,they would all advertise like hay fever holidays
00:22:08,00:22:12,"or allergy escapes, which is a way to get away from your allergies."
00:22:12,00:22:15,It was a very fashionable thing to have.
00:22:15,00:22:16,"- Yeah, it's very cool."
00:22:16,00:22:18,"- Anything about hockey, that ice hockey?"
00:22:18,00:22:18,"- Yeah, sure, yeah."
00:22:18,00:22:20,- So this sounds quite cool.
00:22:20,00:22:23,Underwater ice hockey.
00:22:23,00:22:23,- Wow.
00:22:23,00:22:27,"- Okay, it's played upside down underneath frozen pools."
00:22:27,00:22:28,- No.
00:22:28,00:22:30,- So that is the other side of the ice
00:22:30,00:22:31,that I was talking about.
00:22:31,00:22:32,- Wow.
00:22:32,00:22:35,"- And they use a wooden puck, so it floats."
00:22:35,00:22:37,"And basically you can only stay under,"
00:22:37,00:22:38,they don't use breathing apparatus.
00:22:38,00:22:40,So you can only stay underwater for 30 seconds
00:22:40,00:22:42,and then you go back up and then you go back down again.
00:22:42,00:22:44,And it's next goal wins.
00:22:44,00:22:47,"So it's only one goal, two of the scars first wins."
00:22:47,00:22:48,- Wow.
00:22:48,00:22:50,"- They're not wearing all the hockey stuff, are they?"
00:22:50,00:22:51,"- Well, they have a stick."
00:22:51,00:22:54,"- They have a stick, but are they in trunks and with a stick?"
00:22:54,00:22:55,- Trunks and stick.
00:22:55,00:22:57,- That is amazing.
00:22:57,00:22:57,- Yep.
00:22:57,00:23:00,Don't confuse it with underwater hockey.
00:23:00,00:23:03,Underwater hockey is on the floor of a swimming pool
00:23:03,00:23:04,with a sinking puck.
00:23:04,00:23:06,So you have a really heavy sinking puck.
00:23:06,00:23:07,It's on the bottom and you're playing it
00:23:07,00:23:09,along the bottom of a swimming pool.
00:23:09,00:23:11,- But how can you hit something underwater
00:23:11,00:23:12,and have momentum?
00:23:12,00:23:14,"- Yes, momentum still works on the water."
00:23:14,00:23:15,(laughing)
00:23:15,00:23:17,"I mean, the laws of physics still work on the water."
00:23:17,00:23:20,But you are right that it's more viscous
00:23:20,00:23:21,so it would be more difficult.
00:23:21,00:23:22,"- It would be really hard, right?"
00:23:22,00:23:23,"- Yeah, you would hit it, and it would."
00:23:23,00:23:24,- It's harder.
00:23:24,00:23:25,- The whole thing sounds harder.
00:23:25,00:23:27,(laughing)
00:23:27,00:23:29,- Almost everything is harder underwater.
00:23:29,00:23:30,(laughing)
00:23:30,00:23:33,- Swimming's not swimming is one of the very few exceptions
00:23:33,00:23:34,to this rule then.
00:23:34,00:23:35,(laughing)
00:23:35,00:23:37,But mostly you have a fri and egg underwater.
00:23:37,00:23:38,It's a nightmare.
00:23:38,00:23:39,(laughing)
00:23:39,00:23:40,- That's true.
00:23:40,00:23:42,- It's not coaching an egg and the egg.
00:23:42,00:23:42,- Just a break.
00:23:42,00:23:44,(laughing)
00:23:44,00:23:44,- More to it.
00:23:44,00:23:47,(clapping)
00:23:47,00:23:49,"- No, ice hockey."
00:23:49,00:23:50,"- Yeah, I go on."
00:23:50,00:23:53,"- Yeah, I became obsessed with the fights in ice hockey."
00:23:53,00:23:53,- Oh yes.
00:23:53,00:23:55,"- Oh my goodness, there are so many fights."
00:23:55,00:23:56,- Oh yeah.
00:23:56,00:23:57,- And I didn't know anything about ice hockey
00:23:57,00:23:59,and I think you watched it a lot.
00:23:59,00:24:00,- I watched it a lot.
00:24:00,00:24:02,"- You watched it a lot, yeah."
00:24:02,00:24:04,But I didn't know that they were regulated
00:24:04,00:24:07,as fisticuffs in the rule book of ice hockey.
00:24:07,00:24:11,"And you know, there are lots of unwritten rules as well."
00:24:11,00:24:13,So you have to agree to a fight
00:24:13,00:24:14,and you can't hit someone with your stick.
00:24:14,00:24:17,"- Yeah, I mean they still do, but you're not supposed to."
00:24:17,00:24:19,But you would have one player on your team
00:24:19,00:24:21,who's kind of the guy who does the fighting.
00:24:21,00:24:23,"- And how does, is he only allowed to fight"
00:24:23,00:24:25,the other team's fighter guy?
00:24:25,00:24:26,Or could he fight the other guy?
00:24:26,00:24:28,- They're the guys who kind of start it
00:24:28,00:24:30,and then everyone gets in on the act.
00:24:30,00:24:30,- Okay.
00:24:30,00:24:32,- But they're called the enforcer basically
00:24:32,00:24:35,"and you would have, say the other team is doing really well"
00:24:35,00:24:37,and you kind of wanna stop them in their tracks a little bit
00:24:37,00:24:39,then you might start a fight to try and put them off
00:24:39,00:24:42,and then you might carry on.
00:24:42,00:24:44,"- But it's Andy, have you seen it?"
00:24:44,00:24:44,"- I've seen it, yeah."
00:24:44,00:24:45,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:24:45,00:24:50,"It's actively, not officially, but it's actively encouraged"
00:24:50,00:24:51,by the crowd and it's part of the game.
00:24:51,00:24:53,"Yeah, so they throw their gloves off,"
00:24:53,00:24:56,"they take their helmet off, they go around each other"
00:24:56,00:24:57,with their fists like that
00:24:57,00:24:59,and then they absolutely wallop each other
00:24:59,00:25:01,and it's part of the tradition.
00:25:01,00:25:03,"It happened in fact in the first game ever,"
00:25:03,00:25:05,first ever ice hockey game.
00:25:05,00:25:08,"- It was, it was not between the hockey players."
00:25:08,00:25:10,It was between the ice hockey players
00:25:10,00:25:12,and the ice skaters who were pissed off
00:25:12,00:25:14,"that they'd taken their ring to,"
00:25:14,00:25:17,and it was after the match so it didn't get reported
00:25:17,00:25:21,but there was a fight in the very first ever ice hockey match.
00:25:21,00:25:22,- Sometimes it goes a little bit too far.
00:25:22,00:25:26,I read about one Russian game between Avangard and Vityaz.
00:25:26,00:25:30,The fighting in that game started after three minutes.
00:25:30,00:25:32,"Actually, it was three minutes 27"
00:25:32,00:25:34,when a Brawl take place between basically
00:25:34,00:25:36,all the players on both teams.
00:25:36,00:25:37,- Wow.
00:25:37,00:25:39,"- Okay, a few of the players were sent to the synbin"
00:25:39,00:25:40,and then they started the game again
00:25:40,00:25:43,"of three seconds later, another fight started."
00:25:44,00:25:47,And then eight more players were sent off.
00:25:47,00:25:48,And then the game started again
00:25:48,00:25:52,"and then two seconds later, there was a third fight."
00:25:52,00:25:54,And then at that stage so many people had been sent off
00:25:54,00:25:55,that they couldn't carry on the game
00:25:55,00:25:56,so they just abandoned it.
00:25:56,00:25:57,- Oh my God.
00:25:57,00:26:01,- And both teams were given a five-nil defeat.
00:26:01,00:26:02,Teams lost five-nil.
00:26:02,00:26:03,"- How'd you do, darling?"
00:26:03,00:26:05,"Well, we lost but some of the other guys."
00:26:05,00:26:08,"- Hey, we need to move on to our next fact very shortly."
00:26:08,00:26:10,Should I move us on now?
00:26:10,00:26:11,"- Yes, we should."
00:26:11,00:26:11,"- Ready to go, yeah."
00:26:11,00:26:14,"- Okay, it is time for fact number three"
00:26:14,00:26:16,and that is Andrew Hunter Murray.
00:26:16,00:26:19,"- My fact is that after every festival,"
00:26:19,00:26:22,the founder of Glastonbury has to drive around his farm
00:26:22,00:26:24,with a giant magnet.
00:26:24,00:26:25,And the reason he has to do that
00:26:25,00:26:27,is that there are tent pegs left
00:26:27,00:26:29,across his entire farm in the ground
00:26:29,00:26:31,and he can't see them.
00:26:31,00:26:33,So there's a specially customized tractor
00:26:33,00:26:35,with a giant magnet strapped onto the front of it.
00:26:35,00:26:36,- Wow.
00:26:36,00:26:37,- So cool.
00:26:37,00:26:38,"- Which he drives around, it weighs over a ton."
00:26:38,00:26:40,I think he has someone to do it for him
00:26:40,00:26:41,"because he's quite old now, Michael Davis."
00:26:41,00:26:42,- But what do you reckon it weighs
00:26:42,00:26:44,after he's done doing it?
00:26:44,00:26:48,- I guess 100 or 150 tons.
00:26:48,00:26:50,"- Wow, I don't, I don't, I don't."
00:26:50,00:26:53,(audience laughing)
00:26:53,00:26:54,- That's crazy.
00:26:54,00:26:56,"- I know, it's nuts, isn't it?"
00:26:56,00:26:58,- Why do you have the actual answer down?
00:26:58,00:26:59,"- No, I just curious, I hear."
00:26:59,00:27:00,"- No, okay."
00:27:00,00:27:03,- Because you're adding metal to metal
00:27:03,00:27:04,and then that adds up.
00:27:04,00:27:05,"- Yeah, no, it does, is you?"
00:27:05,00:27:07,- You're not wrong.
00:27:07,00:27:08,- Yeah.
00:27:08,00:27:10,"- It's true, but I reckon if these guys hadn't laughed,"
00:27:10,00:27:12,you'd have taken 150 tons because I'm not sure
00:27:12,00:27:13,you know what a ton is.
00:27:13,00:27:14,- I was telling all the answers.
00:27:14,00:27:15,"- That's not the answer, I was teasing."
00:27:15,00:27:16,"- That's not the answer, I don't know."
00:27:16,00:27:17,- Okay.
00:27:17,00:27:18,(audience laughing)
00:27:18,00:27:20,- But something in that region?
00:27:20,00:27:21,- Yeah.
00:27:21,00:27:22,"- No, no, no, no, no, no."
00:27:22,00:27:24,"- Now we're in that region, okay."
00:27:24,00:27:26,"- I don't know, I'm afraid."
00:27:26,00:27:27,"- But there are thousands of thousands of tents,"
00:27:27,00:27:29,"which get abandoned, you know."
00:27:29,00:27:30,- And they need to pick them up
00:27:30,00:27:32,because in the past cows have been grazing
00:27:32,00:27:35,on these tent pegs and it can injure them quite badly.
00:27:35,00:27:36,- Yeah.
00:27:36,00:27:39,"- Yeah, well they, yeah, they choke for cows."
00:27:39,00:27:40,'Cause he's got a very successful dairy.
00:27:40,00:27:42,I didn't quite realize that Michael Evers
00:27:42,00:27:45,is one of the most successful dairy farmers in the area.
00:27:45,00:27:47,"So the guy who founded it, yeah."
00:27:47,00:27:48,"And that's why it's so quite famously,"
00:27:48,00:27:50,"I think at the first Glastonbury ever,"
00:27:50,00:27:53,"you got free pint of milk, I think."
00:27:53,00:27:55,"- It was one pound to get in, wasn't it?"
00:27:55,00:27:57,"One pound to get in, you got a free bottle of milk."
00:27:57,00:27:58,"- Yeah, really?"
00:27:58,00:28:00,"- And then at the most recent Glastonbury,"
00:28:00,00:28:02,"you could see pole dancing robots,"
00:28:02,00:28:04,"make a cucumber trumpet,"
00:28:04,00:28:07,and jump off a trolley ship shaped like a fish.
00:28:07,00:28:08,(audience laughing)
00:28:08,00:28:09,"- It's lost its way, hasn't it?"
00:28:09,00:28:11,"Lost its way, no free milk."
00:28:11,00:28:12,Do you get free milk still?
00:28:12,00:28:13,- No mate.
00:28:13,00:28:14,- Bloody hell.
00:28:14,00:28:17,"- He does, he's a judge of cheese competitions though."
00:28:17,00:28:18,- At the festival.
00:28:18,00:28:19,- At the festival.
00:28:19,00:28:20,"Not at the festival, no, no."
00:28:20,00:28:22,"- I've completely misunderstood what the festival is like,"
00:28:22,00:28:24,"I think, I've never been."
00:28:24,00:28:27,"The very first one, it was in 1970"
00:28:27,00:28:29,and it was called Worthy Farm Pop Festival.
00:28:29,00:28:33,And the bee had a great article about the first Glastonbury
00:28:33,00:28:34,and they put up one of the flyers for it
00:28:34,00:28:37,"and the flyers, it was so sweet, they said,"
00:28:37,00:28:40,"the acts will include the kinks, Wayne Fontana,"
00:28:40,00:28:43,and at least six other groups.
00:28:43,00:28:44,(audience laughing)
00:28:44,00:28:47,"And in the event, neither the kinks nor Wayne Fontana turned up."
00:28:47,00:28:48,(audience laughing)
00:28:48,00:28:49,"- Wow, wow."
00:28:49,00:28:50,- The six others turned up.
00:28:50,00:28:53,- Well T-Rex turned up to replace their blinders.
00:28:53,00:28:54,"So, yeah, pretty good."
00:28:54,00:28:57,"- Oh yeah, and that's famously where T-Rex exploded"
00:28:57,00:29:01,into the popular consciousness of the British public.
00:29:01,00:29:02,- Yeah.
00:29:02,00:29:05,- I'd memorize that sentence from the article that I read.
00:29:05,00:29:07,(audience laughing)
00:29:07,00:29:08,"So, what year was that?"
00:29:08,00:29:09,- 1970.
00:29:09,00:29:10,"- 1970, right, God."
00:29:10,00:29:11,"So, he's been going for it."
00:29:11,00:29:13,"He's quite old now, Michael."
00:29:13,00:29:15,"Yeah, he's eighties."
00:29:15,00:29:16,"- Yeah, he's very cool though."
00:29:16,00:29:18,"So, everyone probably watched Glastonbury this year"
00:29:18,00:29:22,"and he, Jeremy Corbyn was there and got up on stage."
00:29:22,00:29:27,"So, Jeremy Corbyn is a parliamentary beard of the year winner"
00:29:27,00:29:30,"and actually, Michael Evers, if you can picture him,"
00:29:30,00:29:32,has a very impressive beard himself.
00:29:32,00:29:34,And he went up on stage with Jeremy Corbyn.
00:29:34,00:29:37,Jeremy Corbyn gave him the Labour Manifesto.
00:29:37,00:29:39,"And as that was being handed over,"
00:29:39,00:29:41,there were just two beard legends on stage
00:29:41,00:29:45,because Michael Evers won beard of the decade in 2009.
00:29:45,00:29:46,- Wow.
00:29:46,00:29:47,- In the world.
00:29:47,00:29:49,"So, he beat Fidel Castro to the top spot."
00:29:49,00:29:50,- You're kidding.
00:29:50,00:29:51,- Yeah.
00:29:51,00:29:53,"- You know, there's a secret underground piano bar"
00:29:53,00:29:54,"at Glastonbury, what?"
00:29:54,00:29:56,"- Yeah, and a reporter from the beab"
00:29:56,00:29:59,went looking for it as a recent festival
00:29:59,00:30:03,and he reported back that there is no piano that I can see.
00:30:03,00:30:05,The bar does not turn out to sell alcohol
00:30:05,00:30:07,and most of it is not underground.
00:30:07,00:30:10,(audience laughing)
00:30:10,00:30:12,"- And also not a secret now, it's been a moment."
00:30:12,00:30:14,"- That was not a secret either, though."
00:30:14,00:30:15,- He's against alcohol.
00:30:15,00:30:17,"Well, he's not a drinker, is he?"
00:30:17,00:30:19,"The Glastonbury founder, Michael Evers."
00:30:19,00:30:21,"No, and he's never taken any drugs."
00:30:21,00:30:22,He's anti-smoking.
00:30:22,00:30:24,He's a real methodist.
00:30:24,00:30:27,"It's, I can't tell if it's a disappointment or really nice."
00:30:27,00:30:30,"But, yeah, and he always wears shorts."
00:30:30,00:30:31,This is the thing he's famous for.
00:30:31,00:30:34,"He always wears shorts, whatever time of year it is."
00:30:34,00:30:36,And do you know why he does that?
00:30:36,00:30:39,- He likes to keep his legs cool.
00:30:39,00:30:42,"- That makes a lot of sense, actually."
00:30:42,00:30:45,- He's got lovely calf muscles.
00:30:45,00:30:47,"- Yes, it's that."
00:30:47,00:30:48,It is that he...
00:30:48,00:30:49,- What?
00:30:49,00:30:54,"- He was like, he's a very famous kind of, you know,"
00:30:54,00:30:55,liberal hippie campaigner.
00:30:55,00:30:58,"And he was an anti-thatcher march in the early,"
00:30:58,00:31:03,"a touchy years, and he said, his GP's wife was walking behind me."
00:31:03,00:31:05,"And she said, do you know, Michael,"
00:31:05,00:31:07,you've got the most amazing legs.
00:31:07,00:31:08,And no one had ever said that to me before.
00:31:08,00:31:10,And so I've worn shorts ever since.
00:31:10,00:31:12,(laughing)
00:31:12,00:31:14,- I love the idea that maybe it affects everyone.
00:31:14,00:31:16,"So when he meets all the bands,"
00:31:16,00:31:18,"Coldplay will come up to him, like, hi, but..."
00:31:18,00:31:19,Oh my goodness.
00:31:19,00:31:20,(laughing)
00:31:20,00:31:23,What are the flowers?
00:31:23,00:31:24,Just everyone's...
00:31:24,00:31:27,"- Yeah, Stanley, yeah, nice."
00:31:27,00:31:30,- Some other cool festivals from the world.
00:31:30,00:31:33,"The untold festival took place in Transylvania,"
00:31:33,00:31:35,and you could pay with your blood.
00:31:35,00:31:36,- Whoa!
00:31:36,00:31:37,- Yeah.
00:31:37,00:31:39,"If you signed up to become a blood donor,"
00:31:39,00:31:41,you got a discount.
00:31:41,00:31:44,"And if you showed up in person at a centre nearby,"
00:31:44,00:31:47,then you would get a free one day ticket on the spot.
00:31:47,00:31:47,- Wow.
00:31:47,00:31:51,- But wouldn't you be a bit tired to enjoy the festival?
00:31:51,00:31:53,"Yeah, it doesn't, it tires you out, doesn't it?"
00:31:53,00:31:56,"- No, I mean, I mean, you can still hear music."
00:31:56,00:31:58,(laughing)
00:31:58,00:32:02,"- Yeah, it's not too bad, a problem."
00:32:02,00:32:03,"I got one, James, I really like."
00:32:03,00:32:08,"This is from last year, it was the Newfoundland Lobster Festival."
00:32:08,00:32:10,"Yeah, and what I like about it is that,"
00:32:10,00:32:14,"due to a mess up of transporting the Lobsters to the festival,"
00:32:14,00:32:17,they didn't have any Lobsters at the festival.
00:32:17,00:32:19,"And so instead, everyone had to eat hot dogs."
00:32:19,00:32:21,(laughing)
00:32:21,00:32:24,"It was on an airplane, and the airplane went to the wrong destination,"
00:32:24,00:32:26,or they put it onto the wrong carrier.
00:32:26,00:32:28,"Yeah, so you've got delivered to a whole different place,"
00:32:28,00:32:30,"and they're like, we're waiting for the Lobsters."
00:32:30,00:32:33,"- Why, if they have to get the Lobsters over by-played,"
00:32:33,00:32:35,why are they having a Lobster Festival?
00:32:35,00:32:36,- It's a very good party.
00:32:36,00:32:38,"- No, I'm not sure, because maybe they got it"
00:32:38,00:32:41,from a great Lobster place like Florida or something like that.
00:32:41,00:32:43,- Then have the festival in Florida.
00:32:43,00:32:45,"- No, but they live in Newfoundland, they can't just read."
00:32:45,00:32:47,"- They don't have the festival, like?"
00:32:47,00:32:50,"- No, but they want to, I don't have a Caribbean festival"
00:32:50,00:32:52,in South London to buy.
00:32:52,00:32:55,"- Yeah, but you could, because that's what people do."
00:32:55,00:32:56,- But why would I fly in three tons of sand?
00:32:56,00:32:58,It doesn't make any sense to them.
00:32:58,00:32:59,(laughing)
00:32:59,00:33:01,- I'd just have a South London festival.
00:33:01,00:33:03,"- Okay, that's true, but where did the Lobsters end up?"
00:33:03,00:33:04,Do we know?
00:33:04,00:33:06,"- No, I just a different place, and then the problem is,"
00:33:06,00:33:08,"is by the time they got there, this was the complaint,"
00:33:08,00:33:10,"they said some of the Lobsters had died,"
00:33:10,00:33:13,"which is what I thought you'd want when you were about to eat one,"
00:33:13,00:33:14,so that shouldn't be a problem.
00:33:14,00:33:16,"Do you want, oh, you want them alive right after the..."
00:33:16,00:33:18,"- Well, you keep them alive in your bath, don't you?"
00:33:18,00:33:20,"If you buy a Lobster to eat, then it..."
00:33:20,00:33:21,"- Yeah, that's one of the other things"
00:33:21,00:33:24,it's easier to do underwater is keep a Lobster alive.
00:33:24,00:33:26,(laughing)
00:33:26,00:33:27,So it's three now.
00:33:27,00:33:33,- You were just saying about transporting these Lobsters.
00:33:33,00:33:34,- Yeah.
00:33:34,00:33:37,"- And there was a mud festival in New Zealand called Mudtopia,"
00:33:37,00:33:41,and they transported five tons of mud from South Korea.
00:33:41,00:33:44,- Wow.
00:33:44,00:33:46,- Those mud salesmen must have thought all their Christmases
00:33:46,00:33:47,have come up once.
00:33:47,00:33:49,"I've had another year of no orders,"
00:33:49,00:33:53,I guess it's time to shut down the mud export business.
00:33:53,00:33:55,"- Dreaming, dreaming, hello."
00:33:55,00:33:56,- It's New Zealand.
00:33:56,00:33:58,"We'd like five tons of mud, five tons."
00:33:58,00:34:00,We've only got four tons.
00:34:00,00:34:02,We're back to going out of business.
00:34:02,00:34:05,(laughing)
00:34:05,00:34:05,"- Don't, that's true."
00:34:05,00:34:07,"And basically, I mean, just to finish it,"
00:34:07,00:34:10,"they needed this mud for the mud festival,"
00:34:10,00:34:13,"and they said the local councillor said,"
00:34:13,00:34:16,"""I know there's a perception that we have enough mud ourselves,"
00:34:16,00:34:18,but you can't just pull any old mud out of the ground
00:34:18,00:34:20,"and throw it at people."""
00:34:20,00:34:21,There could be anything in there
00:34:21,00:34:23,that might end up making people sick.
00:34:23,00:34:25,"So basically, the South Korean stuff"
00:34:25,00:34:28,"had had some kind of stuff done to it stop it,"
00:34:28,00:34:29,making people sick.
00:34:29,00:34:30,- It's clean mud.
00:34:30,00:34:30,- Clean mud?
00:34:30,00:34:31,- Wow.
00:34:31,00:34:33,"- Which is amazing to yourself, isn't it?"
00:34:33,00:34:33,- Yeah.
00:34:33,00:34:36,- Do you know that at the Redding and Leeds festivals
00:34:36,00:34:38,"this year, I don't know if anyone went,"
00:34:38,00:34:41,but there was pineapples were banned.
00:34:41,00:34:45,"So there's a list of banned stuff on,"
00:34:45,00:34:47,"you know, that you're not allowed to take in submachine guns"
00:34:47,00:34:49,or bombs or anything.
00:34:49,00:34:51,And then pineapples was added to the list.
00:34:51,00:34:53,"And that's because of this ban that I've never heard of,"
00:34:53,00:34:55,probably everyone else has called glass animals.
00:34:55,00:34:57,"But yeah, they've just got a lyric in their song,"
00:34:57,00:34:58,which says pineapples are in my head.
00:34:58,00:35:00,"And so whenever they have a gig,"
00:35:00,00:35:02,everyone who comes to the gig apparently brings pineapples
00:35:02,00:35:04,and they can cause a lot of damage.
00:35:04,00:35:06,And so they have to put on the ban list.
00:35:06,00:35:07,- What damage?
00:35:07,00:35:08,- What damage can you get?
00:35:08,00:35:11,"- They're spiky, they're really super spiky."
00:35:11,00:35:14,"- They're really, yeah, they're really spiky."
00:35:14,00:35:18,"- Yeah. - Yeah, no, I didn't think about it that way"
00:35:18,00:35:19,"when you said it, Jane."
00:35:19,00:35:22,"So when Dan back you up, fair play."
00:35:22,00:35:26,- They're spiky.
00:35:26,00:35:29,"Okay, maybe in future shows we can get everyone"
00:35:29,00:35:31,on the front row to throw pineapples at you.
00:35:31,00:35:32,How would you like that?
00:35:32,00:35:33,"- Yeah, it's fair."
00:35:33,00:35:36,- You've only ever seen them in those chopped up cubes
00:35:36,00:35:37,"in marks and spenters, haven't you?"
00:35:37,00:35:41,- I'm normally being presented them at an ambassador's dinner
00:35:41,00:35:42,in the '70s.
00:35:44,00:35:46,- Did you guys do anything on magnets at all?
00:35:46,00:35:47,- No. - Yeah.
00:35:47,00:35:48,"- Yeah, come on, let's do some foreign bed."
00:35:48,00:35:52,"- Just quickly, have you guys heard of a thing"
00:35:52,00:35:54,called the Iron Harvest?
00:35:54,00:35:55,Because I've never heard of this.
00:35:55,00:35:58,This is a thing that happens every year in Belgium and France
00:35:58,00:36:02,"and it's a harvest, literally, of iron from the First World War."
00:36:02,00:36:04,And it's still turning up in farmer's fields
00:36:04,00:36:05,across Belgium and France.
00:36:05,00:36:06,- Wow.
00:36:06,00:36:08,"- So during the First World War,"
00:36:08,00:36:10,"for every square meter of territory on the Western front,"
00:36:10,00:36:13,a ton of explosives was fired.
00:36:13,00:36:14,Every square meter.
00:36:14,00:36:15,So it normally turns out--
00:36:15,00:36:17,"- That's a lot done, by the way."
00:36:17,00:36:18,- Yeah.
00:36:18,00:36:19,(audience laughing)
00:36:19,00:36:20,- That doesn't sound a lot.
00:36:20,00:36:24,And so in spring and autumn is when the farmer's plow
00:36:24,00:36:27,their fields and that's when the ground slowly turns it up.
00:36:27,00:36:29,And the French mine clearing department
00:36:29,00:36:33,gets sent about 900 tons of unexploded bombs every year.
00:36:33,00:36:34,- Wow.
00:36:34,00:36:37,"- A few years ago, just around EEPRA itself,"
00:36:37,00:36:40,"just around EEPRA, they got 160 tons of metal,"
00:36:40,00:36:42,which is not to fill five large lorries.
00:36:42,00:36:44,All First World War stuff.
00:36:44,00:36:44,- Wow.
00:36:44,00:36:45,- Yeah.
00:36:45,00:36:46,- That's crazy.
00:36:46,00:36:48,- Do you know something they use magnets for?
00:36:48,00:36:51,"In the 1930s and early 20th century,"
00:36:51,00:36:52,that's quite cool.
00:36:52,00:36:53,"- Okay, a health thing?"
00:36:53,00:36:54,- It is a health thing.
00:36:54,00:36:56,It's for eye problems.
00:36:56,00:37:00,"So I read this on Boeing Boeing, I think,"
00:37:00,00:37:02,which sounds not like a legit website.
00:37:02,00:37:03,- It's real loud.
00:37:03,00:37:04,- Boeing Boeing is brilliant.
00:37:04,00:37:05,- Boeing Boeing is great.
00:37:05,00:37:06,It's just the way you said it.
00:37:06,00:37:07,It sounded like a weird toy.
00:37:07,00:37:09,I read it on Boeing Boeing.
00:37:09,00:37:11,(audience laughing)
00:37:11,00:37:12,- So what kind of eye problems might you have?
00:37:12,00:37:14,- So you'd have stuff caught in your eyes.
00:37:14,00:37:16,So people used to get eye and filings caught in their eyes
00:37:16,00:37:20,"when they worked in industrial, you know, in factories and stuff."
00:37:20,00:37:23,"And there was invented in Minneapolis,"
00:37:23,00:37:25,this piece of equipment that weighed 800 pounds.
00:37:25,00:37:29,"So that is the way of, I think, about five full grown women."
00:37:29,00:37:30,And it was a magnet.
00:37:30,00:37:32,It had the pull of 10 horsepower.
00:37:32,00:37:35,"It involved 7,000 feet of wire."
00:37:35,00:37:36,And it came towards your eye.
00:37:36,00:37:38,And you had a tiny bit of metal stuck in the back of it.
00:37:38,00:37:40,And then it sucked the metal out.
00:37:40,00:37:41,- Whoa.
00:37:41,00:37:43,- But surely it would suck it out.
00:37:43,00:37:44,- Through your eye.
00:37:44,00:37:46,- I would have thought as well.
00:37:46,00:37:49,I've only seen the advertisements in the British newspaper archive.
00:37:49,00:37:51,"- I think if you got something in your eye,"
00:37:51,00:37:53,"it's not gonna be directly behind your eyeball, probably."
00:37:53,00:37:54,- Oh yeah.
00:37:54,00:37:55,- It's just not.
00:37:55,00:37:56,- I wouldn't risk.
00:37:56,00:37:57,It could come out through the lid.
00:37:57,00:37:59,I don't know.
00:37:59,00:38:00,10 horsepower is more than you need
00:38:00,00:38:03,to suck a tiny bit of metal out of your eye.
00:38:03,00:38:03,- 10 horsepower.
00:38:03,00:38:05,- You would think one horse could do that.
00:38:05,00:38:07,(audience laughing)
00:38:07,00:38:09,"Hey, we need to move on to our final fact of the show."
00:38:09,00:38:12,"- Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show."
00:38:12,00:38:14,And that is Chuzinski.
00:38:14,00:38:18,"- My fact this week is that during World War II,"
00:38:18,00:38:21,the owners of Foils bookshop protected the store
00:38:21,00:38:26,from Nazi bombs by covering the roof in copies of Mein Kampf.
00:38:26,00:38:28,(audience laughing)
00:38:28,00:38:29,- It's so good.
00:38:29,00:38:30,- It's so nice.
00:38:30,00:38:31,- Yeah.
00:38:31,00:38:34,"- This one's got that nice, is it?"
00:38:34,00:38:35,- Nice is the wrong word.
00:38:35,00:38:36,- Yeah.
00:38:36,00:38:37,- But it was fitting.
00:38:37,00:38:40,So this is William Foil who set up foils.
00:38:40,00:38:43,"And so at World War II, he filled sandbags"
00:38:43,00:38:45,with all these old books.
00:38:45,00:38:47,And in order to kind of bolster the shop
00:38:47,00:38:49,against the bombs during the blitz in London.
00:38:49,00:38:52,And he said that he was covering the roof
00:38:52,00:38:53,with copies of Mein Kampf.
00:38:53,00:38:55,"And newsreels at the time said,"
00:38:55,00:38:58,"""Foils of London is stacked with copies of Mein Kampf"
00:38:58,00:39:00,"in the place of sandbags."""
00:39:00,00:39:01,"- Yeah, that's what it is."
00:39:01,00:39:02,- That's what it is.
00:39:02,00:39:05,"- Just for context, for overseas listeners,"
00:39:05,00:39:07,"we make this podcast, usually in Covenant Garden,"
00:39:07,00:39:11,which is in Soho-ish area.
00:39:11,00:39:14,"On Charing Cross Road is Foils Bookshop,"
00:39:14,00:39:17,which is a 15 minute walk from where we work.
00:39:17,00:39:20,And it's one of the most iconic bookshops in London.
00:39:20,00:39:22,It's an independent bookshop.
00:39:22,00:39:24,And it was known for its eccentricities.
00:39:24,00:39:26,And it's been going for a very long time.
00:39:26,00:39:30,And it's still one of the iconic bookshops of London.
00:39:30,00:39:30,- Yeah.
00:39:30,00:39:32,- A Mein Kampf was a book by Hitler.
00:39:32,00:39:34,(audience laughing)
00:39:34,00:39:35,- It's one of the iconic bookshops.
00:39:35,00:39:38,(audience laughing)
00:39:38,00:39:39,"Oh, what's he done now?"
00:39:39,00:39:40,Is there more?
00:39:40,00:39:43,- It's not even the only time that the foils
00:39:43,00:39:44,had a run in with the Nazis.
00:39:44,00:39:47,"So in fact, earlier than that, Christina Foil,"
00:39:47,00:39:50,"who was the daughter of William the founder,"
00:39:50,00:39:53,"when the Nazis held their book ""Burnings"","
00:39:53,00:39:54,"she wrote to Adolf Hitler saying,"
00:39:54,00:39:57,"""We'll give you a good price, we'll buy them, don't burn them."""
00:39:57,00:39:58,Which is good.
00:39:58,00:40:02,"And then the reply was negative but respectful, apparently."
00:40:02,00:40:03,- Yeah.
00:40:03,00:40:06,"- And then in 1939, Christina also invited Hitler,"
00:40:06,00:40:10,"Mussolini, and Stalin, to speak at one of her literary lunches."
00:40:10,00:40:11,- Wow.
00:40:11,00:40:12,- So they used to have these lunches with incredible figures
00:40:12,00:40:13,from the world of literature.
00:40:13,00:40:15,And she invited all three.
00:40:15,00:40:16,- Wow.
00:40:16,00:40:18,- Hitler replied that he had urgent business in Germany.
00:40:18,00:40:20,Mussolini and Poland.
00:40:20,00:40:23,(audience laughing)
00:40:23,00:40:28,- Mussolini said that he might visit
00:40:28,00:40:30,when things quiet him down a bit.
00:40:30,00:40:33,(audience laughing)
00:40:33,00:40:36,"- Stalin didn't reply, didn't he?"
00:40:36,00:40:37,- Rude.
00:40:37,00:40:39,- Okay.
00:40:39,00:40:42,"- She was a character, actually."
00:40:42,00:40:44,"And not in a massively positive sense, maybe."
00:40:44,00:40:49,"So Foil has been through some tough times,"
00:40:49,00:40:50,partly because of her.
00:40:50,00:40:52,"So she wasn't really a fan of her,"
00:40:52,00:40:54,the people who worked in her bookshop.
00:40:54,00:40:56,So she used to summarily sack them
00:40:56,00:40:58,before they'd worked for six months
00:40:58,00:40:59,"because after six months,"
00:40:59,00:41:01,you're entitled to better employment rights.
00:41:01,00:41:02,"So if you work for foils,"
00:41:02,00:41:04,then you get sacked up to six months.
00:41:04,00:41:06,"And this meant that you got quite not very good staff,"
00:41:06,00:41:08,"and you got not very dedicated staff,"
00:41:08,00:41:09,and there was a story of someone
00:41:09,00:41:13,"who came in in the '60s or '70s and asked for Ulysses,"
00:41:13,00:41:15,and the person at the till replied
00:41:15,00:41:16,"that Ulysses had gone out to lunch,"
00:41:16,00:41:18,but would serve them as soon as possible.
00:41:18,00:41:20,"- All right, nice."
00:41:20,00:41:23,"They have changed that policy now, by the way."
00:41:23,00:41:24,"I just want to say that,"
00:41:24,00:41:26,'cause hopefully they'll keep stocking our book
00:41:26,00:41:30,and they'll attack their HR policies.
00:41:30,00:41:31,"- The other thing I've changed is,"
00:41:31,00:41:34,"they've changed their payment system,"
00:41:34,00:41:37,and Christina was quite concerned about staff
00:41:37,00:41:40,"possibly stealing from the shop,"
00:41:40,00:41:41,"maybe because they weren't paid very much,"
00:41:41,00:41:44,"but the old payment system,"
00:41:44,00:41:48,designed to stop staff stealing when does follows.
00:41:48,00:41:50,"You had to queue up for the book,"
00:41:50,00:41:51,and then you had to get a docket for it
00:41:51,00:41:52,"from a staff member,"
00:41:52,00:41:55,"then you had to queue up to pay for the book,"
00:41:55,00:41:56,then you would get the docket stamped
00:41:56,00:41:58,"to prove that you had paid for the book,"
00:41:58,00:42:00,then you would have to queue up a third time
00:42:00,00:42:02,at the counter you'd been to first to collect the book.
00:42:02,00:42:04,- Wow. - Yeah.
00:42:04,00:42:06,"And also, she didn't even organize her books"
00:42:06,00:42:08,"by, in any sensible way."
00:42:08,00:42:10,"She organized them by publisher, didn't she?"
00:42:10,00:42:11,- Yes. (laughing)
00:42:11,00:42:14,- Do you know who all your books are published by?
00:42:14,00:42:16,"- Because we're random house, by the way,"
00:42:16,00:42:19,"an excellent company, but no, you don't,"
00:42:19,00:42:22,"and you can do alphabetically or by genre, no, she didn't."
00:42:22,00:42:23,- Do you know when that lasted until?
00:42:23,00:42:25,- That lasted till 1999.
00:42:25,00:42:27,- No. - Yeah.
00:42:27,00:42:29,"- We should say because it sounds like we're slamming them,"
00:42:29,00:42:30,"but falls obviously amazing,"
00:42:30,00:42:32,and also all this information
00:42:32,00:42:34,is on the most brilliant page on their website.
00:42:34,00:42:36,So they're one of these sites
00:42:36,00:42:39,that obviously has some amazing research
00:42:39,00:42:39,"are working for them,"
00:42:39,00:42:41,and they've got a really good site
00:42:41,00:42:43,falls bookshop of their history and stories and foils.
00:42:43,00:42:44,"- Yeah, she's got that."
00:42:44,00:42:46,"- She died in 1999, Christina,"
00:42:46,00:42:47,"and she really was the end of an era,"
00:42:47,00:42:49,"but after she died, they had a refit"
00:42:49,00:42:53,in which they discovered a lift that nobody knew about.
00:42:53,00:42:54,(laughing)
00:42:54,00:42:55,- Wow. - Yeah.
00:42:55,00:42:56,- Where did it go?
00:42:56,00:42:57,"- Up and down, mostly."
00:42:57,00:42:59,(laughing)
00:42:59,00:43:10,"- And it's just moved like a year ago,"
00:43:10,00:43:13,"so it was in this iconic spot on Charing Cross Road,"
00:43:13,00:43:14,"still on Charing Cross Road,"
00:43:14,00:43:15,but it's moved down the road.
00:43:15,00:43:18,"But apparently, and I went to it many times,"
00:43:18,00:43:20,I'm sure you guys did as well.
00:43:20,00:43:23,"It was a labyrinth of these different weird,"
00:43:23,00:43:25,"tiny crevices you could get,"
00:43:25,00:43:27,"you find yourself hours going a new spot in the bookshop,"
00:43:27,00:43:29,"you didn't know existed, and they had,"
00:43:29,00:43:31,"it was a sort of in joke amongst the shop,"
00:43:31,00:43:33,"because they had an in-house staff magazine,"
00:43:33,00:43:36,and they always had a lost property section
00:43:36,00:43:38,"in the, you know, lost and found,"
00:43:38,00:43:41,"and one of the things that they wrote was found,"
00:43:41,00:43:42,"Paul Potter of Made-A-Vale,"
00:43:42,00:43:45,"after wandering for an hour, trying to find his way out."
00:43:45,00:43:47,"And that happened, that happened a lot,"
00:43:47,00:43:49,"where people, customers would just get lost,"
00:43:49,00:43:51,"and you know, the partners would be like,"
00:43:51,00:43:52,"have you seen my husband and are like,"
00:43:52,00:43:54,"do you have an hour, 'cause we will,"
00:43:54,00:43:57,"we will find his, your husband, 'cause we may have him."
00:43:57,00:43:59,(audience laughing)
00:43:59,00:44:03,"So Christina ran the bookshop after her father, William,"
00:44:03,00:44:06,"retired in 1945, and she ran it into the '90s,"
00:44:06,00:44:09,"and she claimed that she read an entire book every day,"
00:44:09,00:44:11,"had never done her own housework, all cooking,"
00:44:11,00:44:14,and she only ever drank champagne.
00:44:14,00:44:18,"She was asked what would happen if she lost her chef,"
00:44:18,00:44:20,"and she said there was always milk, champagne,"
00:44:20,00:44:22,and smoked salmon in the fridge.
00:44:22,00:44:25,(audience laughing)
00:44:25,00:44:26,Mine can't.
00:44:26,00:44:27,"- Yeah. - No, really?"
00:44:27,00:44:29,(audience laughing)
00:44:29,00:44:31,- Current bestseller rank on Amazon.
00:44:31,00:44:32,- Yeah.
00:44:32,00:44:36,"- 1,471,284."
00:44:36,00:44:37,- Okay.
00:44:37,00:44:38,"- So they're beating us, aren't they?"
00:44:38,00:44:41,(audience laughing)
00:44:41,00:44:42,"They, the mine can't team."
00:44:42,00:44:44,(audience laughing)
00:44:44,00:44:48,- But it's not even in the top 700 in the fascism category.
00:44:48,00:44:49,- Oh!
00:44:49,00:44:51,- It's not for the 700 in the world.
00:44:51,00:44:54,- That's fascism. - That's gotta hurt.
00:44:54,00:44:57,- But fascism and Nazi books do sell.
00:44:57,00:45:00,"There's a famous story about Alan Koran,"
00:45:00,00:45:02,"the famous woodcissed and father of Victoria Koran,"
00:45:02,00:45:05,and he'd noticed that the most popular titles in Britain
00:45:05,00:45:08,"in those days were about cats, gulf, and Nazis,"
00:45:08,00:45:12,"and so he called his book ""Gulfing for Cats"""
00:45:12,00:45:14,and put a massive swastika on the cover.
00:45:14,00:45:17,(audience laughing)
00:45:20,00:45:21,The one thing I didn't know about mine camp
00:45:21,00:45:24,is that it hadn't a company in picture book.
00:45:24,00:45:25,(audience laughing)
00:45:25,00:45:25,Not even kidding.
00:45:25,00:45:26,- Really?
00:45:26,00:45:29,"- It was called ""The Hitler Nobody Knows,"""
00:45:29,00:45:32,"and it was designed to improve Hitler's public image,"
00:45:32,00:45:34,"'cause his image was very, very bad at the start,"
00:45:34,00:45:35,'cause obviously he was a thug
00:45:35,00:45:37,and he'd organized putches and things like that.
00:45:37,00:45:39,"- He didn't get much better, did he?"
00:45:39,00:45:41,"- He didn't get much better, but this in Germany"
00:45:41,00:45:44,"turned around the public image of him a lot,"
00:45:44,00:45:46,'cause it was like a family album.
00:45:46,00:45:48,"It began with photos of him as a baby,"
00:45:48,00:45:49,and photos of him as a--
00:45:49,00:45:51,- He still had a tiny little mustache.
00:45:51,00:45:53,(audience laughing)
00:45:53,00:45:54,"- Ironically, he looked like Churchill."
00:45:54,00:45:57,(audience laughing)
00:45:57,00:45:59,But it was massively popular.
00:45:59,00:46:02,"It sold over 400,000 copies by 1942."
00:46:02,00:46:04,"- And this was, came along with mine camp--"
00:46:04,00:46:07,"- No, it was another of the works designed"
00:46:07,00:46:08,to improve his public image.
00:46:08,00:46:10,"So it wasn't a buy one, get one, free thing,"
00:46:10,00:46:11,"or anything like that, but yeah."
00:46:11,00:46:13,- 'Cause they've released a manga version
00:46:13,00:46:18,"of mine camp now, and someone here is a huge fan."
00:46:18,00:46:21,(audience laughing)
00:46:21,00:46:23,- So is Hitler portrayed as Japanese in it?
00:46:23,00:46:27,"- I think he is, yes, I assume he is."
00:46:27,00:46:30,So this is weirdly in Japan and Turkey.
00:46:30,00:46:32,"There are manga versions of mine camp,"
00:46:32,00:46:34,"and it was introduced a few years ago in Japan,"
00:46:34,00:46:37,"and it sold 45,000 copies to bizarre."
00:46:37,00:46:39,"And then in India, there's a version"
00:46:39,00:46:42,which is used for business and management students
00:46:42,00:46:44,who advised to read it.
00:46:44,00:46:45,"- It seemed very different over there, I think,"
00:46:45,00:46:47,'cause they were quite geographically detached
00:46:47,00:46:51,from the things that happened in World War II in Europe.
00:46:51,00:46:52,And they don't really get taught about the Holocaust
00:46:52,00:46:54,as much as we do and stuff like that.
00:46:54,00:46:56,So they just sit completely differently.
00:46:56,00:46:58,"So in India, they have a Hitler Cafe,"
00:46:58,00:47:02,"a Hitler fashion store, and Hitler ice cream."
00:47:02,00:47:03,- Really?
00:47:03,00:47:04,- Yeah.
00:47:04,00:47:06,(audience laughing)
00:47:06,00:47:08,- We need to wrap up very shortly.
00:47:08,00:47:09,Do you guys have anything before we do?
00:47:09,00:47:10,"- I've one more story, it's about foils though."
00:47:10,00:47:11,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:47:11,00:47:12,"- It's Christopher Foil, who took over"
00:47:12,00:47:14,"from his aunt, Christina."
00:47:14,00:47:17,It's just an anecdote he told about a time
00:47:17,00:47:19,when he was working in the shop and he wrestled a shop lifter.
00:47:19,00:47:21,And I just wanted to tell you it 'cause I love it.
00:47:21,00:47:24,"He said, he chased him out of the shop, he saw him leaving,"
00:47:24,00:47:27,and they got into Soho Square right nearby.
00:47:27,00:47:29,"And he said, I was very calm, very friendly."
00:47:29,00:47:31,"I said, excuse me, I think you might have some books there."
00:47:31,00:47:33,"You didn't pay for, would you like to come back to foils"
00:47:33,00:47:35,and we'll just discuss it?
00:47:35,00:47:37,"Anyway, at that point, they usually come back quietly,"
00:47:37,00:47:39,all they lash out or run away or whatever.
00:47:39,00:47:40,This chap lashed out.
00:47:40,00:47:42,"I remember, he kept on trying to kick me in the groin."
00:47:42,00:47:45,"So what I did was, with one hand, I held him away from me"
00:47:45,00:47:46,by the knot of his tie.
00:47:46,00:47:49,"By the other, I held him by the end of his tie."
00:47:49,00:47:50,"Anyway, we ended up grappling and I remember"
00:47:50,00:47:52,we were rolling around in the gutter in the next moment.
00:47:52,00:47:54,I found myself being hauled to my feet
00:47:54,00:47:56,by a burly policeman and he by another.
00:47:56,00:47:57,"The curious thing about this man was,"
00:47:57,00:47:59,they were books on breaking codes and ciphers.
00:47:59,00:48:02,"It turned out, he was an officer in MI5."
00:48:02,00:48:05,(audience laughing)
00:48:05,00:48:09,"Okay, should we wrap up guys?"
00:48:09,00:48:09,We're gonna wrap up.
00:48:09,00:48:11,"Okay, that is it."

00:48:41,00:48:45,away to a member of the audience here tonight in Dunstable.
00:48:45,00:48:46,We've picked out our favorite fact from the ones
00:48:46,00:48:49,"that you guys sent in and have we got it here who was,"
00:48:49,00:48:50,"who was, I got it."
00:48:50,00:48:53,And I'm just going to take my phone off airplane.
00:48:53,00:48:54,"Oh, Jesus."
00:48:54,00:48:56,"I'm really, I am, can I do it?"
00:48:56,00:48:57,Shall I do another Hitler fact?
00:48:57,00:48:58,- Yes.
00:48:58,00:48:59,- Great.
00:48:59,00:48:59,- Yep.
00:48:59,00:49:00,Thank you.
00:49:00,00:49:03,"- So during the Iran hostage crisis,"
00:49:03,00:49:06,the CIA managed to sneak some agents into Tehran
00:49:06,00:49:08,and they had false German passports.
00:49:08,00:49:10,"Okay, and one of the agents was stopped"
00:49:10,00:49:12,"by the customs officials and they said,"
00:49:12,00:49:14,"""Something's wrong with your passport."""
00:49:14,00:49:16,"They said, ""This is the first time I've seen a German passport"
00:49:16,00:49:20,"""which has a middle initial instead of a full name."""
00:49:20,00:49:24,"And they said, ""Your name is given as Joseph H. Schmidt."""
00:49:24,00:49:26,"And the guy was, ""Oh my God, I'm going to get caught."""
00:49:26,00:49:28,And then he suddenly came up with a brainwave
00:49:28,00:49:30,"and he said, ""Well, oh yeah, when I was born,"
00:49:30,00:49:32,"""they gave me my middle name as Hitler"
00:49:32,00:49:35,"""and I have a special permission not to use it."""
00:49:35,00:49:37,(audience laughs)
00:49:37,00:49:38,"That's clever, isn't it?"
00:49:38,00:49:39,"- Yeah, that's good."
00:49:39,00:49:40,- Did they buy it?
00:49:40,00:49:41,"- Yeah, they bought it."
00:49:41,00:49:41,"- Oh, nice."
00:49:41,00:49:46,"- And Joseph H was H Henry, by any chance, you know?"
00:49:46,00:49:47,"- It was a made-up name, done."
00:49:47,00:49:50,(audience laughs)
00:49:50,00:49:55,"- How's the fact finally going, Andy?"
