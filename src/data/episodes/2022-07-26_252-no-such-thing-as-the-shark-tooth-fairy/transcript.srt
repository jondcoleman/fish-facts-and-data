00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:20,720
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

3
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,760
 to you from the QI offices in Covenant Garden.

4
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,440
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin, and

5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,840
 Anna Chazinski, and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

6
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:37,840
 facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go.

7
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,940
 Starting with you, Chazinski.

8
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:45,480
 My fact this week is that in Amsterdam, the roads are paved with used toilet paper.

9
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,720
 Let's catch his gold.

10
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:54,320
 Yeah, Dick Wittington is very different there, and this is a really cool thing actually.

11
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:00,200
 So the road constructor in the Netherlands called KWS has realised that to make a kind of

12
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:04,960
 improved version of tarmac, it can use the cellulose that it gets from recycled toilet paper,

13
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,760
 so the toilet paper goes into the sewage system, you flush it into the sewage system, and

14
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,560
 then they basically put it through kind of a sieve which gets the poo out.

15
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,560
 That's important.

16
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,660
 That's a really important stage of this whole process.

17
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:20,000
 It is, you don't want to be driving on poo.

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 No.

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,840
 Or walking on it, after a night out in Amsterdam, none of those things.

20
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:34,280
 There's no poo in it, it's just paper and it thickens it apparently, so and it makes it

21
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:38,120
 better absorbing water, so it improves it's like water wicking away from the surface of

22
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:42,040
 the road, so it makes the roads less slippery, and apparently it reduces noise as well.

23
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,840
 It's very quiet if you're walking on loop roll.

24
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,840
 Right.

25
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,840
 That makes sense.

26
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,840
 So what's it mixed with?

27
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,640
 It's not just the toilet paper that's just laid down.

28
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,120
 No, it's with asphalt.

29
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,120
 It's the usual.

30
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,120
 Okay.

31
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,760
 It's usually ingredients.

32
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,000
 I found a fact about what else you could make a road out of.

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,320
 You could make a road out of rubber, which is cool, so it's like the whole road is made

34
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,320
 of tires.

35
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,560
 If you're walking on that, you think it'd be easier to walk because you could bounce

36
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,560
 around.

37
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,560
 I think so.

38
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,560
 Yeah.

39
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,600
 They have to use tires, by the way, not just rubber, but actual ground up tires.

40
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,600
 Sorry.

41
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,600
 This is what I mean.

42
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,600
 Yellow stuff like that.

43
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,600
 Oh, I didn't know it was in Yellowstone.

44
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:21,240
 They partnered up with Michelin, I believe it was, and they've, yeah, been grinding up the

45
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,240
 tires.

46
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:25,440
 But then the tires on the cars are basically riding over the dead comrades.

47
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,440
 Exactly.

48
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,120
 It's a bit depressing, isn't it?

49
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,120
 Very dark.

50
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,320
 Is it the case then that we can just put anything in the roads?

51
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,840
 Should we just be putting everything we don't need in the roads?

52
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,040
 So far, we've got plastic rubber, toilet paper, nuclear waste.

53
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,040
 Nuclear waste.

54
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,040
 Nuclear waste.

55
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,040
 What are we doing?

56
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,040
 Why is there even rubbish?

57
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,040
 Every time we chuck a packet out of the car.

58
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,520
 We're literally on tarmac.

59
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,520
 You cigarette butts?

60
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:54,000
 Oh, well, do you know this is a weird thing.

61
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,360
 Lots of roads in London, we used to be paid for with wood.

62
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,360
 Good.

63
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,400
 And that was good partly because it was quieter under horses hooves.

64
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:06,160
 And also, it was less slippery, but it did have downsides because it would soak up horse

65
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,160
 urine.

66
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,400
 And then if a heavy wagon passed over it would just squirt horse urine.

67
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,560
 That is a downside, isn't it?

68
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,680
 A place that has some quite exciting roads is Vermont.

69
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,240
 So Vermont is covered in invisible roads.

70
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,240
 Sorry.

71
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,240
 Covered.

72
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,240
 Covered.

73
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,240
 Covered.

74
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,240
 Covered in non-existent roads.

75
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,240
 And it was causing a major problem.

76
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:34,400
 So basically, Vermont is the only state where if a road has ever been built or even planned

77
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,240
 or someone suggested that we might put a road here, it goes down legally as a recognised

78
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,240
 road.

79
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,240
 And it can never be undone.

80
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:45,440
 So mostly a road is discontinued legally after a few years if it's not being used.

81
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,840
 So if you look at sort of old maps of Vermont, it's just the whole thing, it's just roads.

82
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,360
 And that means because roads are public highways, that means that you can have your house.

83
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,760
 It's probably on an ancient by way of some sort.

84
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,760
 And people could just wander through your house any time of day because they can say look

85
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,960
 at this old map from 1790, this used to be a road.

86
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,760
 And people were getting really annoyed with this.

87
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,560
 So I think they've actually had to address it.

88
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:12,000
 And there was a law that came out in about 2009 which said, okay, guys, you've got to stop

89
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,800
 claiming there's an old road here so you can walk into this person's drawing room.

90
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,560
 And places were told to claim their roads or lose them by 2015, I think.

91
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,680
 It's only that one guy who goes, oh, excuse me, that used to be a road here.

92
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,960
 It's got a million maps in fact.

93
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:30,360
 I've got to go somewhere.

94
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:35,360
 Do you know how white lines on roads came about according to the internet?

95
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,000
 So I would say it's to make sure that people stay on their side of the road.

96
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 It was that.

97
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 Yes.

98
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 But they were invented.

99
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 Well done.

100
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 10 points.

101
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,960
 They were invented in 1911 in Michigan by I called Edward Hines.

102
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,400
 And this is just the kind of thing that with research is so annoying because the Michigan

103
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:56,560
 Department of Transportation and all these books say Edward Hines at the time he was chairman

104
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,320
 of the county board of roads.

105
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,160
 And he came up with the idea of putting white lines in the middle to stop cars just driving

106
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,160
 in the middle of the road.

107
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:07,480
 He came up with the idea after watching a leaky milk truck make its way down the road.

108
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:11,400
 Now you read that and you're like, that's obviously not true.

109
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,680
 He just thought, because the question is, why not?

110
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,680
 Why did he choose white?

111
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:18,320
 Well, because obviously you just choose white on black because if it was like a leaky

112
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,400
 chuck with milkshake truck, he would have brown lines.

113
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:25,880
 There's just, and there's no evidence for it.

114
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,720
 I always wonder who comes up with these things first.

115
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,720
 Who decides?

116
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,720
 Did he not clap?

117
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:37,760
 Well, there's certainly no evidence online of him crying over spilled milk, let's make

118
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,760
 a line out of it.

119
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:42,320
 But you say white being the obvious, but so at the time when they officially recognize

120
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,400
 that, yes, we want to put this on all the roads in America and white was picked, Oregon

121
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,560
 said we want to do in yellow and they thought that that was a much better color.

122
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,560
 Someone saw someone pissing on a road.

123
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:03,640
 Yeah, but they eventually did change it to yellow strips in America for the center parting

124
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,640
 of a road.

125
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,640
 Oh, is it yellow in a road?

126
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,640
 Yeah.

127
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,640
 Yeah.

128
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:11,160
 You get yellow lines here and then red lines, which are the really serious ones.

129
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,160
 So there are.

130
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,160
 What are the serious ones?

131
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,160
 I don't drive.

132
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,160
 So I don't.

133
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,160
 I don't know.

134
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,160
 I don't know if on a road I mean, really don't park here.

135
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,160
 Yeah.

136
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,160
 Yellow means you're probably fine.

137
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,160
 Right.

138
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,040
 So road, which means like, it's roads going in and out of big cities where you really

139
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:28,440
 do not want anyone ever parking that technically on a yellow lines, you can park there for

140
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,440
 like 10 minutes.

141
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,440
 Okay.

142
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,440
 If you're loading, you're unloading.

143
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,440
 Is that so?

144
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,440
 Yeah.

145
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,440
 Someone swatted up for their theory test, didn't they?

146
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,440
 Yeah.

147
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,440
 Yeah.

148
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,440
 So I can see you failing it.

149
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,440
 Well, technically though.

150
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:44,640
 Technically, I have a lot to drive through this bad front room.

151
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:48,920
 And who wants to take the QIL phone is next driving to Jesus.

152
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:54,920
 Something I've always found really amazing about road surfaces is a fact about Bitumen, which

153
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,360
 I remember finding this out in the end series when I was researching the Nabatean, so with

154
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:02,600
 this amazing Middle East and civilization, but basically the reason they were like the

155
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:08,600
 richest civilization from about 500 BC to 200 BC in Arabia.

156
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,920
 And they got rich by selling tarmac.

157
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,760
 And the way they got tarmac was they were near the Dead Sea.

158
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:18,000
 And this weird thing happened when there was an earth tremor of some sort, huge amounts

159
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,440
 of Bitumen would just suddenly bubble up to the surface of the Dead Sea.

160
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,520
 So these massive islands of Bitumen just appeared and they would sit there like the size

161
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,520
 of houses.

162
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:30,280
 And then the Nabateans would just row or swim out to them, climb onto them, and hack the

163
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,920
 Bitumen off and then go and sell it and they sell it to the Egyptians who used it in

164
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,920
 embalming.

165
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,920
 And they became super rich.

166
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:40,760
 And I just find that whole thing, like islands of tarmac, sort of exploded up.

167
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,760
 That's amazing.

168
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:45,800
 And I think the word mummy comes from Bitumen because of that thing, I think, I think so.

169
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,800
 Does it?

170
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,960
 It comes from a word for Bitumen.

171
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:48,960
 Yeah, yeah.

172
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,960
 I wonder why it stopped.

173
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,960
 Presumably it stopped.

174
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,160
 I think it ran out.

175
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,160
 Wow.

176
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,160
 I think they got all of it.

177
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,440
 They scavenged all the, all the Bitumen.

178
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:00,920
 Speaking of things that came out of the ground unexpectedly.

179
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,920
 Subströmling.

180
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:07,160
 A man in the dutch city of Amsterdam has recently been injured after a pop-up public

181
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:12,520
 toilet that was sunk into the ground emerged unexpectedly.

182
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:16,760
 The man was hit by a moped, which was thrown up in the air.

183
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:20,280
 So there's like a toilet that just comes out at night for revelers and stuff like that and

184
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,920
 they keep it underground normally.

185
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:25,480
 But just for some reason, it just popped up and there was a moped on top of it and it flew

186
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,880
 in the air and it hit this guy.

187
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,880
 Wow.

188
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,880
 So cool.

189
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,880
 How fast do they pop up?

190
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:33,240
 Is it going to blow as they swing out around like a Japanese ball?

191
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,240
 Amazing.

192
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,240
 That's terrifying.

193
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:39,040
 I've got a fact about toilet paper, actually, while we're on toilets.

194
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,240
 This is another thing you can make toilet paper out of.

195
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,240
 You can make it out of milk.

196
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,240
 What?

197
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,240
 Yeah.

198
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,600
 There's a company, I think it's a German and an Italian company.

199
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,880
 They teamed up, one made fabrics and one was a design company or something.

200
00:08:52,880 --> 00:09:00,020
 Anyway, they made this thing, which is called Kareza Delatte, which is milk caress.

201
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:04,560
 And it uses a protein, which they extract from sourd milk.

202
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,560
 So it's a waste milk.

203
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,960
 If the cow has been ill and you can't sell the milk to customers.

204
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,720
 How do you get sour milk?

205
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,720
 No, no.

206
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,840
 If I have a normal milk and it going off, it's not like, oh, this milk is off, it must have

207
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,840
 been a sick cow.

208
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,840
 Sorry.

209
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:22,880
 If they take the normal milk from sick cows and then it sows.

210
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,880
 All right.

211
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,880
 Okay.

212
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,880
 The separate thing.

213
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,880
 So it's waste milk.

214
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,840
 So the farmers can sell it for a very small amount, not for the drinking milk price.

215
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:34,960
 But then you can turn it into toilet paper, which I guess you can also eat.

216
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:38,800
 So you can, if you're hungry on the loo, you can just eat a bit of this milk toilet

217
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,800
 for a sick cow.

218
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,800
 I don't want to eat milk.

219
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,800
 Milk lear over my sick cow.

220
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,800
 But wait.

221
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,840
 Is milk bad if it's from a sick cow?

222
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,840
 Yeah.

223
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,840
 That was another thing I was thinking.

224
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,840
 Like I'd never thought of that.

225
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,840
 I don't.

226
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,840
 It depends how sick I guess.

227
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,840
 Yeah.

228
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,840
 Yeah.

229
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,840
 It depends what's in the.

230
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,840
 It depends what bacteria are in the milk.

231
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,840
 It depends what's in the milk.

232
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,840
 It depends what bacteria are in the milk.

233
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,840
 It depends what's in the milk.

234
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,840
 It depends what's in the milk.

235
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,840
 It depends what's in the milk.

236
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,840
 It depends what bacteria are in the milk.

237
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,840
 It depends what's in the milk.

238
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,840
 It depends what's in the milk.

239
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,840
 It depends what bacteria are in the milk.

240
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,840
 It depends what's in the milk.

241
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:16,840
 That toilet, I've never seen the one James you were talking about earlier that comes through the ground.

242
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,840
 That's a problem you don't see.

243
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,840
 It's the last minute.

244
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,840
 Yeah.

245
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,840
 And they're very good.

246
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,840
 They're good for women.

247
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,840
 They make them.

248
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,840
 So the ones in London that you see are purely urinals for men.

249
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,840
 But these ones can be used by women.

250
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,840
 And they've just.

251
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,840
 They seem to have innovations for toilets that are sort of groundbreaking.

252
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,840
 There's an amazing one.

253
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,840
 You guys remember the.

254
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,840
 Yeah.

255
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,840
 In that case.

256
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,840
 Yeah.

257
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,840
 Remember the little fly that got used on a urinal for men?

258
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:32,840
 Yeah.

259
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:36,840
 It's that a urinal would have a little drawing of a fly in the center of it.

260
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:40,840
 And that would encourage men to try and aim to hit the fly.

261
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,840
 I saw that, unfortunately.

262
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,840
 There was also a fly in the room flying around.

263
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,840
 So I kind of chased him around with a chance of urine.

264
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,840
 That was.

265
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,840
 Yeah, I was not pretty at all.

266
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,840
 Not welcome back to that restaurant.

267
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:55,840
 But yeah, so that was that was debuted in the 90s in Amsterdam's airport.

268
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,840
 Yeah, shifl, isn't it?

269
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,840
 Yeah, and shifl.

270
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,840
 Yeah.

271
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:02,840
 And that's now used globally to help the reduce spillage that happens in a lot of bathrooms.

272
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,840
 That's good.

273
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,840
 Yeah.

274
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,840
 In the Netherlands, making waves in toilets.

275
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,840
 Basically, I think we've learned from this.

276
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,840
 Another bit of neverland toilet technology.

277
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,840
 Oh, yeah.

278
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,840
 Rotterdam has a revolving toilet.

279
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,840
 Well, that sounds extremely disconcerting.

280
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,840
 Can you think of what that might be?

281
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,840
 Is it a public toilet?

282
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,840
 Yeah.

283
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,840
 It's not a revolving restaurant.

284
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,840
 Nope.

285
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,840
 Okay.

286
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,840
 Is it because they couldn't afford a door.

287
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,840
 So it's a way of turning your back on people while you we.

288
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,840
 So they can't see you.

289
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,840
 Really good idea.

290
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,840
 They'd still be able to see the back of your head.

291
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,840
 Does it have a big sail on top and whichever wind direction is prevailing?

292
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,840
 The toilet face is that way.

293
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,840
 For what reason?

294
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,840
 So that the we doesn't blow back at your face.

295
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,840
 Exactly that reason.

296
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,840
 No, not that.

297
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,840
 It's because it's got two toilets in it.

298
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,840
 And so you use one of them.

299
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,840
 And then you walk out.

300
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,840
 And there's a detection that can tell there's no person in it.

301
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:56,840
 And then it flips around the two toilets and it can clean the other one.

302
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,840
 While the other toilet.

303
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,840
 So the previously clean one is now in that place.

304
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,840
 Do you know what I mean?

305
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,840
 Yes, yes.

306
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,840
 Does that make sense?

307
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,840
 Well, I'm inside one toilet.

308
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,840
 Is someone else going to be cleaning the other toilet and I have to wait for them to finish that?

309
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,840
 I think it's kind of robotic cleaning.

310
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,840
 Right.

311
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,840
 So yeah.

312
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,840
 So you're there and you use the toilet and then you leave and then it flips around.

313
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,840
 So there's now a clean toilet there and the old one is being cleaned by a robot.

314
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,840
 Possibly.

315
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,840
 That's great.

316
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,840
 It's not a human.

317
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,840
 I've mentioned it to a crowd that you just hear your voice go.

318
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,840
 Oh, jeez.

319
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,840
 That's right.

320
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,840
 Oh, man.

321
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:36,840
 Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is Andy.

322
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:41,840
 One frequent result of winning the lottery is going bankrupt.

323
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:46,840
 This also applies to people who just live near people who have won the lottery.

324
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,840
 Very good.

325
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,840
 So it's so unfair.

326
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,840
 What I mean, neighbors of lottery winners tend to go bankrupt basically.

327
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,840
 It's doubly unfair, isn't it?

328
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,840
 Yeah.

329
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,840
 Really?

330
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,840
 Why?

331
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,840
 Well, because you've not won the lottery and you've gone bankrupt.

332
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,840
 Yeah, it is.

333
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,840
 It is doubly unfair.

334
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,840
 Yeah.

335
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,840
 It's weird.

336
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,840
 So why?

337
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:07,840
 Well, there's a study that's been done by researchers at the University of Alberta in Canada

338
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:12,840
 and Georgetown and they studied a Canadian province which had 7,000 lottery winners.

339
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:18,840
 And what they found was in areas where people won the lottery, the bankruptcy rate goes up by 6%.

340
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:23,840
 This might be because people keep it a secret, the fact that they've won the lottery.

341
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:27,840
 So people borrow more around them because they want to keep up with the Joneses as it were.

342
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,840
 They're like, "Oh, wow, they've got a yacht."

343
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:33,840
 I think we better get a yacht and they start borrowing more money and then they take more money.

344
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,840
 Why do we need that?

345
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,840
 We live in the middle of Canada.

346
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:41,840
 But they take more risks and they borrow more and then they're likely to go bust.

347
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,840
 I suppose it doesn't even have to be a secret, right?

348
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:47,840
 Even if you know they've won the lottery, if you see them buying something nice, then you want to keep up.

349
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,840
 Exactly.

350
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:53,840
 And I think one of the studies find that the neighbours would buy conspicuous goods,

351
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,840
 because obviously you're buying goods that you want people to see, you want people to know

352
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,840
 that you're doing as well as those neighbours who've won the lottery.

353
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:05,840
 So it said they'd buy things like cars, posh cars, but wouldn't spend money on indoor items like furniture.

354
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:09,840
 I just got a sit in the car if you need to sit.

355
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:13,840
 Just empty bar and homes.

356
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,840
 Seven Ferrari's outside.

357
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,840
 Wow.

358
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,840
 So I guess a statement making as opposed to, yeah.

359
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,840
 Yeah, exactly.

360
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,840
 It is.

361
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,840
 It's classic keeping up with the Joneses.

362
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,840
 Yeah.

363
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:27,840
 And it's nearly a third of lottery winners declared bankruptcy according to some estimates, isn't it?

364
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,840
 Wow.

365
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,840
 It's amazing that.

366
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:33,840
 I think in America, winning the lottery sometimes doesn't mean winning the big prize.

367
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,840
 It can mean winning a smaller amount.

368
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:40,840
 They just still would call that winning the lottery whereas I think in Britain, if you say I won the lottery,

369
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,840
 you have to win over a million quid, I would say, right?

370
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,840
 Yeah.

371
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,840
 So there are lots of studies.

372
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:52,840
 There's one which I found debunked saying that 70% of lottery winners go bankrupt, which I think there's not much evidence for.

373
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:55,840
 That's just too many.

374
00:14:55,840 --> 00:15:02,840
 But I found out the saying that lottery winners are likely to declare bankruptcy within the first five years after winning the prize.

375
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,840
 Then the average American.

376
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,840
 Right.

377
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,840
 Because in the first two years, you're probably fine because you probably haven't spent all the money within two years.

378
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,840
 Yeah.

379
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,840
 I was reading about Britain's first ever lottery.

380
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,840
 So this was over 450 years ago.

381
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,840
 This was in 16th century.

382
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:20,840
 And the prize was not just money.

383
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,840
 You'd got other items as well.

384
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,840
 So runners up would have a prize.

385
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,840
 So you would get gold jugs or linen.

386
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,840
 And the lottery took three years to do.

387
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,840
 So you took three years to buy ourselves a gold jug.

388
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,840
 Because the next star of just a gold jug.

389
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,840
 But check this out.

390
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:40,840
 If you just bought the ticket alone and you didn't win anything,

391
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,840
 what that ticket did give you was a prize as well.

392
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,840
 Which was you avoided any kind of arrest.

393
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,840
 You had a pardon.

394
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,840
 You had a pardon.

395
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:53,840
 As long as it wasn't murder and something that really was, you know,

396
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:57,840
 you'd stolen someone's entire contents of their house, including their gold jugs,

397
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,840
 you would have a pass on being arrested.

398
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,840
 You take a chance and you get a get out of jail free card.

399
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,840
 Yes.

400
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,840
 Is this that this is Queen Elizabeth, isn't it?

401
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,840
 It is, yeah.

402
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,840
 Because you wanted to raise lots of money for a shipbuilding.

403
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,840
 And I think the legal immunity only applied for a week.

404
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,840
 It was seven days, yeah.

405
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,840
 It was so that you could go in.

406
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,840
 And it was.

407
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:19,840
 It was if it, so it didn't count if you committed piracy, murder, felonies or treason.

408
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,840
 And it was so that you could go into towns and buy a ticket.

409
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,840
 Because she was desperate for people to buy a ticket.

410
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,840
 It wasn't she.

411
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,840
 And if you went in as a criminal and there was a wanted sign on the door, then people would.

412
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,840
 Oh, wow.

413
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,840
 It was like a version of the purge.

414
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,840
 Like you have this everyone suddenly, seven day window.

415
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,840
 But that's what I was wondering.

416
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,840
 People surely didn't just buy it and then do something illegal.

417
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,840
 Did they?

418
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,840
 That kind of happened.

419
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,840
 I'd steal another ticket.

420
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,840
 Oh.

421
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,840
 After seven days.

422
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,840
 After seven days.

423
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,840
 Perpetual scam.

424
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,840
 Yes.

425
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,840
 Yeah.

426
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,840
 But after you stolen the ticket, I'm not sure you're immune anymore.

427
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,840
 Because then you've bought it.

428
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,840
 So I think you're just immune when you go into buy it.

429
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:54,840
 So I think as soon as you committed that crime, they'd be like, we've got what we want after you.

430
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:59,840
 There's one that was done, which was in Sweden, which was a speed camera lottery.

431
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,840
 And that was, it was you would buy lottery.

432
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:05,840
 And it would use all the money that it was generating from people who were going past speed cameras and speeding.

433
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:06,840
 And access money.

434
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:14,840
 So it kind of turned it into a thing where you actively wanted to not get caught because you could then win the money from people who were speeding.

435
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,840
 It was a sort of psychological thing.

436
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:17,840
 Oh wait.

437
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:21,840
 If you were speeding, were you not eligible to win the speed camera fund?

438
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:22,840
 I think everyone was allowed to answer that.

439
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:23,840
 Yeah.

440
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:24,840
 I think you must have been, you couldn't be excluded.

441
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:25,840
 Oh yeah.

442
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:26,840
 You weren't incentivized to not speed.

443
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:27,840
 You were actually incentivized to speed.

444
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
 So there was more fund in the, in the speeding lottery.

445
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,840
 Not really.

446
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,840
 You're only winning your own money back.

447
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,840
 You're more incentivized to egg other people on the speed.

448
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,840
 Yes.

449
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,840
 Yes.

450
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,840
 Just everyone sat in a bus going faster, faster.

451
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,840
 I've kind of been my kid through college.

452
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,840
 We've mentioned, we've previously mentioned the dog poo lottery, haven't we?

453
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,840
 In Taiwan.

454
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,840
 I think we lost it.

455
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,840
 We have.

456
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:51,840
 It sounds like the kind of thing we went.

457
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,840
 Yeah.

458
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,840
 We had to have a bag of dog poo to get a ticket.

459
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,840
 Oh, okay.

460
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,840
 So is that incentivizing you to make your dogs poo?

461
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,840
 It's incentivizing you to poo in the bag.

462
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,840
 It's really incentivizing.

463
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,840
 Do you think they should, they must have checked.

464
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,840
 I don't think they'd run the strict DNA checks.

465
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,840
 That's not the dog poo lottery.

466
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:12,840
 Mr. Murray, we notice you don't actually own a dog.

467
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,840
 And yet you've answered this 500 times in the last week.

468
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,840
 We have questions about your diet.

469
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:25,840
 I was reading about the guy whose job it is to go around and tell people that they've won the lottery.

470
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,840
 Oh.

471
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,840
 Which I think might be one of the best jobs you can have.

472
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,840
 So he's in Britain, he's a guy called Andy Carter.

473
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:36,840
 And he basically is the person who goes to people's houses once they know they've won and ask what they want to do about it.

474
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,840
 They want to set up a bank account.

475
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,840
 Oh, they already have one.

476
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,840
 Do they want to put their money in it?

477
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,840
 Do they want to keep it under the mattress?

478
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,840
 That kind of thing.

479
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,840
 He doesn't sound very professional.

480
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,840
 Every week he's like, you already have a bank account.

481
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,840
 Wow.

482
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,840
 I've got to get myself one of those.

483
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:58,840
 Yeah, he gives them various bits of advice and stuff.

484
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,840
 And he's, yeah, so he's called Andy Carter.

485
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,840
 And he says that he often has to go in disguise.

486
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,840
 So he'll often have to go as like an estate agent.

487
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,840
 If I saw Andy Carter rocking up the road now, I'd be like, ah, that's him.

488
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,840
 No one knows what he looks like.

489
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,840
 Oh, why?

490
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,840
 But that would be great to me.

491
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,840
 If you saw Andy Carter walking up to you.

492
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:20,840
 But if you see him walking up to your neighbour, the point is that 85% of people keep their identity secret because they're all such greedy cars.

493
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:24,840
 But no one knows what Andy Carter looks like.

494
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,840
 But they see us a big name badge.

495
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,840
 Which I doubt he does.

496
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,840
 He usually dresses as one of those big lottery balls.

497
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:36,840
 It just has to cover that up with a cloak when he visits.

498
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,840
 You know, if a weird man walks up to your neighbour's door, you'll ask them who?

499
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,840
 I don't think anything about it.

500
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,840
 I don't know my neighbour's.

501
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,840
 I've been London.

502
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,840
 I don't know.

503
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:45,840
 I've met most of my neighbours.

504
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,840
 Well, people are very nosy in the region.

505
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:55,840
 I would assume it was one of my neighbours if I saw Andy Carter walking up to you.

506
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,840
 Anyway.

507
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,840
 Andy did say he gets some quite weird people.

508
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,840
 People are so secretive.

509
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:08,840
 So he said once he had to go and organise the lottery wins with a man who was keeping it secret from his entire family.

510
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:14,840
 And so he said, he when he visited the man, he said he was pacing around the room and asking me how long the visit was going to take as his wife had popped out to Tesco.

511
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,840
 And he wasn't planning to tell her.

512
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,840
 Oh, God.

513
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,840
 He reassured me they're perfectly happy, very much in love.

514
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,840
 She's just not interested in the money side of things.

515
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,840
 Wow.

516
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,840
 That's pretty dodgy, isn't it?

517
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,840
 Wow.

518
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,840
 As those two are not together anymore.

519
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,840
 No.

520
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,840
 He does always bring his balls with him.

521
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:36,840
 He says it's one of the first things people want to see.

522
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,840
 Yes, he does.

523
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:44,840
 No, I think that I do see why he's in, you know, in disguise.

524
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:49,840
 If weird man comes to the door and they're saying, can I see your balls, please?

525
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,840
 Oh, it must be Andy Carter.

526
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,840
 No, they just do estate agents and they sell things these days.

527
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,840
 Almost a good reason to want to win the lottery, because I didn't test on meeting Andy Carter.

528
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,840
 I'm really weird.

529
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,840
 And I know I think to come dressed is a particular thing as well.

530
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:03,840
 To bring his balls.

531
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,840
 Yeah.

532
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,840
 They're not his balls.

533
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,840
 They're not his, they're the lottery's balls.

534
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:11,840
 People always want to see a few example balls.

535
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,840
 They don't want to prove you're Andy Carter.

536
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,840
 Show me your balls.

537
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,840
 Oh, anyway.

538
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:24,840
 Robert Mugabe won the Zimbabwe and national lottery tickets.

539
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:25,840
 What?

540
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,840
 Just a fact.

541
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,840
 Where are the chances?

542
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:38,840
 Did you know that in 2014, 80% of donations to the Scottish Peron Dependence campaign came from one Euro Millions lottery winner?

543
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:39,840
 No.

544
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,840
 Unbelievable.

545
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:45,840
 Well, this couple called Colin and Chris Weir and they got 161 million in 2011.

546
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,840
 And they, yeah, they provided 79% of the donations to that campaign.

547
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,840
 That was money well spent.

548
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,840
 Wasn't it?

549
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:53,840
 [LAUGHTER]

550
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,840
 10% of people who win more than a million pounds by a caravan.

551
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:58,840
 Do they?

552
00:21:58,840 --> 00:21:59,840
 Yeah.

553
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,840
 10%. There's quite a high proportion.

554
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:01,840
 That is.

555
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,840
 That's so weird.

556
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,840
 I wouldn't have thought the cost of a caravan was super prohibitive.

557
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,840
 I wouldn't have thought you needed a million pounds to buy one.

558
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,840
 To buy the top end.

559
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,840
 But let's say you win a million quid.

560
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,840
 You could probably give up your job.

561
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,840
 Yes.

562
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:15,840
 You could give up your job, right?

563
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,840
 Yeah.

564
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,840
 But probably you'd want to go on a lot of holidays.

565
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,840
 But you couldn't go on lots of massive really round the world.

566
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,840
 Gold-plated aeroplane holidays for a million quid, could you?

567
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,840
 You're right.

568
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:29,840
 So you have to have something where you can go on nice holidays.

569
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,840
 Yeah.

570
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:31,840
 But you don't have to pay a lot of money for it.

571
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,840
 You could live in a caravan until you died if you had a million quid.

572
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,840
 It's the dream.

573
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,840
 [LAUGHTER]

574
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,840
 Well, I'm giving up jobs.

575
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:43,840
 I read a really interesting stat, which is that 86% of American lottery winners

576
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,840
 and this is people who've won the jackpot.

577
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,840
 So they've won millions.

578
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,840
 86% of Americans stick with their jobs.

579
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,840
 Whereas in the equivalent in Britain, 41% do.

580
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,840
 [LAUGHTER]

581
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,840
 Are we much lazier?

582
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,840
 Would you, Anna?

583
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,840
 I'd be out of fear like any shot.

584
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,840
 [LAUGHTER]

585
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,840
 God, have I find a five-fire note on the street?

586
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,840
 [LAUGHTER]

587
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:08,840
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

588
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,840
 OK, it is time for fact number three.

589
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,840
 And that is my fact.

590
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:16,840
 My fact this week is that the 10th Correspondence Chess Olympiad,

591
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:19,840
 which is done entirely by post, took so long to complete

592
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,840
 that the winners of both gold and bronze represented countries

593
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,840
 that no longer existed.

594
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,840
 [LAUGHTER]

595
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:27,840
 Pretty amazing.

596
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,840
 So funny.

597
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:32,840
 So this is a competition that is still going to this day.

598
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,840
 I believe they're on the 21st, although online,

599
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,840
 on Wikipedia, it says they're on their 10th.

600
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,840
 So maybe there's a few different governing bodies.

601
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,840
 The ladies' one is on its 10th, maybe?

602
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,840
 Is it right, OK.

603
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,840
 So here's the thing.

604
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,840
 The match that we're talking about

605
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,840
 with the 10th Correspondence Chess Olympiad,

606
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,840
 that started in 1987.

607
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,840
 And it takes years and years to finish the games

608
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,840
 and get to the final and have a winner.

609
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,840
 In fact, the 11th Correspondence Olympiad

610
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,840
 started before the 10th even finished.

611
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,840
 They just get forward and they go, "We want to get going."

612
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,840
 So the winners of the 10th in gold place

613
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,840
 was someone from the USSR.

614
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:11,840
 And in bronze was East Germany, both of which

615
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,840
 were dissolved countries by the time the winning--

616
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:15,840
 [LAUGHTER]

617
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,840
 --the winner was announced in 1995.

618
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,840
 But these days, I think, most tournament matches

619
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:24,840
 are limited to just only two and a half years.

620
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,840
 Yes.

621
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,840
 So these days, if you're still going after two and a half years,

622
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,840
 then an independent arbitrator comes along and says,

623
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,840
 "I think you're winning."

624
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:33,840
 [LAUGHTER]

625
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,840
 It's amazing.

626
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,840
 So the system, the way it works,

627
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,840
 is that you send a postcard to the person

628
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,840
 that you're playing against.

629
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,840
 And you have three days to make your move

630
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,840
 and send another postcard back.

631
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,840
 So they look at the dates on the postcard.

632
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,840
 But because of the mail taking so long in certain countries,

633
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,840
 you might not receive it for weeks, months even.

634
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:53,840
 So it's very important that little date

635
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,840
 that sits on the actual postcard itself.

636
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,840
 Yeah, so it's the date that it arrives is when you start,

637
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,840
 which you can just say that is whenever you want, actually.

638
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,840
 Yeah.

639
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:05,840
 So people have noticed that if people are really struggling

640
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,840
 towards the end, that it seems to take a lot longer

641
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,840
 for the letters to arrive to them.

642
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,840
 Right.

643
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,840
 But then when you send it, that's when the post mark

644
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,840
 is so you can't cheat that one, can you?

645
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,840
 Yeah.

646
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,840
 I really like the idea that you can use--

647
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:19,840
 you can use help as well.

648
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,840
 Yeah.

649
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:21,840
 So you can use books or magazines or the internet.

650
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,840
 You can use anything short of running the entire game

651
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,840
 through a chess software program, which is found on--

652
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:27,840
 It is, I'm banned.

653
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:28,840
 Yeah.

654
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,840
 But it means that the better players,

655
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,840
 it's a slightly different skill to playing normal chess, isn't it?

656
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,840
 So if you play normal chess, there's time limits.

657
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,840
 Apart from anything in the person you're playing against,

658
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,840
 it just gets really barred and doesn't want to play anymore.

659
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,840
 But in this, because there's not really any time limits,

660
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,840
 well, you say, you know, three days.

661
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,840
 You have 30 days for every 10 moves.

662
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:49,840
 So you could take, you know, 30 days--

663
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,840
 or 20 days if you want.

664
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,840
 On one.

665
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,840
 I find that really worrying about this.

666
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,840
 I think I would be extremely bad at it, because it's a classic

667
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,840
 encouraging people to leave it to the last minute thing.

668
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,840
 Yeah, you've got 30 days for 10 moves.

669
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,840
 So I know I'd forget about it for 29.5 days.

670
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,840
 And then suddenly, you've got to send, you know, 10--

671
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,840
 I know.

672
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:07,840
 10 postcards.

673
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,840
 And if you've done your move, yeah, I did mine days ago.

674
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,840
 Yes, exactly.

675
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:11,840
 Yes, James, come on.

676
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,840
 I'm just going to do this other thing.

677
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,840
 I reckon it's more stressful.

678
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,840
 There's a guy called Croydon H. Jarvis,

679
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,840
 who took eight years to complete one move.

680
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:21,840
 What?

681
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,840
 How?

682
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:23,840
 In his defense, it wasn't his fault.

683
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,840
 So he started-- he was a British guy,

684
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,840
 and he started playing Correspondence Chess with a German in 1931,

685
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,840
 and they played a lot together.

686
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,840
 And then in the middle of one of their games,

687
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,840
 the war interrupted.

688
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:34,840
 And that was--

689
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:35,840
 It probably wasn't his fault.

690
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,840
 No.

691
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,840
 It was inconvenient for them, though.

692
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,840
 So they couldn't post during the war,

693
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:41,840
 because postcards were interrupted.

694
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,840
 And for two years afterwards, they couldn't post to each other.

695
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,840
 And then, I think, in 1948, he got a postcard from his opponent

696
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,840
 saying, look, mate, are you going to finish this game?

697
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,840
 Why is I'm planning victory?

698
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:52,840
 It's amazing.

699
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,840
 And lots of people, even with the postal service,

700
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,840
 wasn't affected.

701
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,840
 They weren't allowed to do it, because people thought they were codes, didn't they?

702
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,840
 Yes.

703
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,840
 I think there's--

704
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,840
 Even Hockfrey Bogart was visited by the FBI,

705
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:05,840
 because they thought he was sending secrets through postal chess.

706
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,840
 And what secrets did Hockfrey Bogart have access to?

707
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,840
 He wasn't-- he was an actor.

708
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,840
 Yeah, but he always played spies and movies, didn't he?

709
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,840
 Yeah, so yeah.

710
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,840
 Yeah, there was one guy called Graham Mitchell,

711
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,840
 who wasn't there, who, a load of postcard service recently,

712
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,840
 which had bizarrely cryptic stuff.

713
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,840
 So he was a deputy head of MI5 in the 1950s,

714
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:32,840
 and he was corresponding using postal chess as a way of exchanging secrets in the past.

715
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,840
 So it was reasonable that they would suggest that.

716
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,840
 Yeah, although he has been exonerated,

717
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:41,840
 that is literally my personal opinion based on having read the postcards.

718
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,840
 What did you get for the postcards?

719
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,840
 They just seemed like he wouldn't write sentences quite like that.

720
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:53,840
 Instead of saying Queen to D4, he would say Queen to Balmoral on the 17th of April.

721
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:57,840
 And there was a 19th century chess master called Joseph Blackburn,

722
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,840
 who was arrested as a spy for sending chess moves through the mail,

723
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,840
 because they thought they were secrets.

724
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:06,840
 I really like him because he thought that drinking whiskey improved the brain.

725
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,840
 And every time he played chess, he tried to prove it.

726
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:13,840
 So he always drank whiskey during every game.

727
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:18,840
 And according to the official records, he played more than 100,000 games of chess in his career.

728
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:19,840
 Wow.

729
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,840
 I've been looking at the chess records.

730
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,840
 So he's full of absolutely great stuff this week of media page.

731
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:26,840
 It's really funny.

732
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,840
 But there was one which I really like, which is,

733
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,840
 you know, people play simultaneous chess.

734
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,840
 They played lots of games at the same time.

735
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,840
 So I'm just going to read this over about him.

736
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:39,840
 The worst result in a simultaneous exhibition given by a master occurred in 1951,

737
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:46,840
 when International Master Robert Wade gave a simultaneous exhibition against 30 Russian schoolboys aged 14 and under.

738
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:49,840
 After seven hours of play,

739
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:56,840
 Wade had lost 20 games and drawn the remaining 10.

740
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,840
 That's a bad day, isn't it?

741
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:02,840
 Maybe he was letting the win the case.

742
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,840
 That is amazing.

743
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,840
 So simultaneous chess is one very challenging form of chess.

744
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,840
 It gets more challenging if you're blindfolded playing it,

745
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,840
 which is the thing that people have done historically.

746
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:17,840
 And this has been considered in history multiple times a really dangerous thing to do.

747
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,840
 So blindfold chess has been, and you don't have to be blindfolded.

748
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:23,840
 You just have to be not able to see the board when you're making your moves.

749
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,840
 So it's about being able to memorize exactly the position of the board.

750
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:30,840
 Because you'd knock over pieces.

751
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:33,840
 So yeah, this is a thing, and it was quite popular in the 19th century.

752
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,840
 There are prominent blindfold chess players. There are a couple called Morphe and Steinets,

753
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,840
 both of whom played, and they kept having these mental breakdowns.

754
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:43,840
 And so it spread that it would give you brain fever.

755
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:47,840
 And there's a lot of reports say the USSR banned displays in it in 1930,

756
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,840
 because it was so bad for your mental health, because it was too challenging.

757
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:54,840
 Kasparov's coach spoke out against it and said, "This is bad for you."

758
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:58,840
 And so Kasparov never played it, and it's thought that might be why.

759
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,840
 So it's actually really dangerous.

760
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:04,840
 You hold the whole board in your head. Don't you? You're not allowed to look at the board.

761
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:08,840
 But what if I just, because obviously some of you might miss here,

762
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,840
 you know, a three for a four, and be playing a completely separate game

763
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,840
 to the game that you're opponent.

764
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,840
 I don't think you're going to miss here a three for a four, are you?

765
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:17,840
 Well, I don't know.

766
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,840
 A D for an E, E for and D for.

767
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,840
 Yeah, exactly. Yeah, you're right.

768
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:25,840
 So do they tell you if you've gone off board, if you're just playing?

769
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,840
 E 52.

770
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,840
 To Z? No, you do not.

771
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:33,840
 Yes, I don't know. You must lose immediately, right?

772
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:37,840
 Otherwise, it can't be like, can I put that pawn on D for?

773
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,840
 And they go, "No, you can't. That's no legal move."

774
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,840
 Okay, what about the bishop to E5?

775
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,840
 No, sorry.

776
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,840
 You lost the bishop, 10 turns. What are you doing?

777
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,840
 And you also something like battleship.

778
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:56,840
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show.

779
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,840
 And that is James.

780
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,840
 Okay, my fact this week is that when they're about to be born,

781
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:05,840
 baby sharks sometimes pop their heads out of their mother's cervix

782
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,840
 before taking a look around, deciding against it

783
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:11,840
 and retreating back into the womb.

784
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,840
 What do they not like the look of?

785
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,840
 Who knows, just the world.

786
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,840
 Wow.

787
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,840
 You can't say we haven't all thought some stays in our lives.

788
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:23,840
 Wouldn't it be better to just revert back into the womb?

789
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,840
 That's horrifying.

790
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:26,840
 It's amazing.

791
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,840
 It's so good.

792
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:28,840
 How many times can they do this?

793
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:31,840
 Well, there'd be sort of a 10-year-old shark still in the womb.

794
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,840
 It's like, "You've got to come out sometimes."

795
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:38,840
 Well, we don't really know, because people don't really know

796
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:42,840
 much about sharks, especially before they're born.

797
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:45,840
 But this is quite a recent study by Kiyomi Marukama

798
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:51,840
 and Takaturu Tamita, who developed an underwater ultrasound machine

799
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,840
 and have been able to look at what's happening inside the body

800
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:59,840
 of a tornied nurse shark as she has some embryos.

801
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,840
 And they found this out.

802
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:02,840
 There's a few other things.

803
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:06,840
 They found out that the sharks have two uteruses

804
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:10,840
 and the sharks like to swim between the uterine

805
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:13,840
 and eat unfertilized eggs.

806
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,840
 They're unfertilized brothers and sisters.

807
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:16,840
 That's the thing that happens.

808
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:17,840
 That's so cool.

809
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:18,840
 They're practising.

810
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,840
 They're doing their length before they come out of the womb.

811
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:21,840
 It's super cool.

812
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:25,840
 It's quite arduous, because there's quite a thin tube, isn't there?

813
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,840
 Connecting them are you, Ben?

814
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:27,840
 Connecting the two uterine.

815
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,840
 And they squirm their way through it.

816
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:33,840
 Swimming between two different bits of the womb just to eat your...

817
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:34,840
 Yeah.

818
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:35,840
 Eats and eggs.

819
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,840
 ...would be siblings.

820
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,840
 And there's always more than one shark.

821
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,840
 I think they give birth usually to three or four.

822
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,840
 And so sometimes all of the sharks will be in one of the uteruses,

823
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,840
 eating all of the eggs, and then they'll all migrate to the other uterus

824
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,840
 and then eat all the eggs there.

825
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,840
 And do they eat each other?

826
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:50,840
 Is that a different species?

827
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,840
 It's a different species.

828
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:55,840
 These guys might do as well for a lino, but that's some sand sharks as well.

829
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,840
 Yeah, some tiger sharks.

830
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:58,840
 Yeah.

831
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,840
 I guess that's the thing, though.

832
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:03,840
 You might be looking out the cervix just thinking,

833
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,840
 "Is this another room inside mum?"

834
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,840
 Because you've already found one room.

835
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,840
 How do you know?

836
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,840
 Yes, massive.

837
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:11,840
 Exactly.

838
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,840
 Sharks and eggs are really quite clever.

839
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:18,840
 So they recently discovered that they can react really well to predators.

840
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,840
 Even as a shark's laid an egg and it's sitting there and they've done ultrasound

841
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:25,840
 and they've found out that if there's even so much as a vibration nearby

842
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:29,840
 or if something walks nearby that's emitting slight electromagnetic radiation,

843
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:33,840
 then the embryo inside senses it and it completely freezes

844
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:37,840
 and it holds its breath because it knows that if it's even moving its gills,

845
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,840
 then it's going to be giving off an electrical signal that the thing might be able to sense.

846
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,840
 So even in the egg.

847
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:43,840
 That's very cool.

848
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:44,840
 It can be scared.

849
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:45,840
 Yeah.

850
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:46,840
 Wow.

851
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:54,840
 Sharks, they have teeth and they have different teeth all the time.

852
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:59,840
 So we've got baby teeth and adult teeth but they shed their teeth throughout the whole life.

853
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,840
 But this actually starts before they're even born.

854
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:07,840
 So they have teeth in the womb, embryonic teeth and they lose those and they get morty.

855
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,840
 So they lose their baby teeth before they're even babies.

856
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:14,840
 Does the mother shark have a load of loose teeth rattling around in her womb?

857
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,840
 It seems like it might be that that might be true.

858
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:22,840
 And also that this might have thrown like previous studies into distribute

859
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:29,840
 because embryonic teeth of great white sharks are almost identical to adult teeth of sand tiger sharks.

860
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:35,840
 So a lot of things that they thought were sand tiger sharks turn out to might turn out to be embryos of great white sharks.

861
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,840
 It's such a hard to check through them all.

862
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,840
 Wow.

863
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:44,840
 It's such a niche crisis in the plastic studies world.

864
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:48,840
 But yeah, they have sharks and have up to 50,000 teeth in their life.

865
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,840
 Some of them shed teeth once a week.

866
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:53,840
 Which just must mean they are loaded too very well.

867
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,840
 Although I don't know where she'd leave it.

868
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,840
 The money.

869
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,840
 On the seabed.

870
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,840
 On the seabed.

871
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,840
 Oh.

872
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,840
 Lovely.

873
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,840
 Very nice.

874
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:10,840
 So we do know so little about birthing of shark for example a great white shark we've never seen one be born ever.

875
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,840
 Yeah, it's amazing.

876
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:14,840
 We've somehow just not managed to see that.

877
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:22,840
 And so occasionally aquariums and other such places studying these sharks get inside into ways that they give birth.

878
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:28,840
 And New Zealand and aquariums are an amazing thing where there was a shark that was giving birth but was having problem with the birthing process.

879
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:40,840
 So another shark came up and bit its abdomen and in the process allowed it was basically a sea section gave it a sea section and the little sharks were able to swim out and both the baby sharks and the mother shark survived.

880
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,840
 The incident.

881
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:45,840
 Yeah, so it was just they were just witnessing some sort of bizarre technique.

882
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:48,840
 Wait, so another shark bit the abdomen open.

883
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,840
 Yeah.

884
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,840
 So that things could escape.

885
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:51,840
 That is extraordinary.

886
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,840
 Yeah, it's weird.

887
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:55,840
 I also can't believe they can do it well enough that the shark survived.

888
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:58,840
 You would have thought if you're tearing open the abdomen of a shark let's babies out.

889
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,840
 Yeah, and they didn't they didn't even know that the shark was pregnant as well.

890
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,840
 So that was a huge surprise.

891
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:06,840
 They just sort of another shark was eating a shark and then suddenly they were just performing surgery.

892
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:10,840
 Could it be that they were just eating the shark and it just so happened that there was a baby in there.

893
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,840
 That is possible.

894
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,840
 Yeah.

895
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:16,840
 So sharks can have virgin births even if they are not virgins.

896
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,840
 No, they can't.

897
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,840
 They can.

898
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:21,840
 But isn't that by definition impossible of virgin births?

899
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:25,840
 So it's like the Virgin Mary isn't.

900
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:30,840
 But in 2017 there was a leopard shark in Australia which had previously mated with a male.

901
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:33,840
 And then I think they said, oh we don't actually want any more sharks to be born.

902
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:40,840
 So they moved her into her own bit of the aquarium and then she kept laying eggs like a chicken.

903
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,840
 She laid the eggs like a chicken.

904
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:43,840
 Yeah, yeah.

905
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,840
 She was clucking.

906
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,840
 She wagged her fins around.

907
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:50,840
 No, she laid these eggs just you know non fertile eggs as they called.

908
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:51,840
 Right, got it.

909
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,840
 But then some of them started hatching.

910
00:36:53,840 --> 00:37:01,840
 So these were clones basically of herself which she sort of switched from a sexual into an asexual mode.

911
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,840
 That's never been observed before.

912
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:04,840
 Wow.

913
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,840
 That's weird.

914
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:09,840
 It's a fresh excuse for sorry my boyfriend climbed into my bedroom in the middle of the night and I didn't tell you, isn't it?

915
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:10,840
 The asexual reproduction.

916
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:14,840
 I don't know how it's happened.

917
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:17,840
 So that can I talk about baby shark the sun?

918
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:20,840
 Yeah, you'd be waiting so patiently.

919
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:23,840
 Well, it's just because you say that they can have virgin birth.

920
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,840
 So that means that there's no daddy shark.

921
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:26,840
 First of all.

922
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,840
 Okay.

923
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:31,840
 And I would mean other famous hawking link, isn't it?

924
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:37,840
 So I tweeted this a while ago and today when I was googling baby sharks for this podcast,

925
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:42,840
 I found an article in the sun from September last year saying baby shark has been blasted

926
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:46,840
 over factual inaccuracies by boffins on the internet.

927
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:52,840
 Several Twitter users have taken to the site to point out the various ways that EO worm has got biology wrong.

928
00:37:52,840 --> 00:38:00,840
 Podcast and QI researcher James Hark pointed out no idea that this is the sun in September last year.

929
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,840
 No idea that they called it.

930
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,840
 Wait, what did you point out?

931
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,840
 I posted pointed out two things.

932
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:07,840
 One that sometimes there's no daddy shark because they.

933
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,840
 Does it mention daddy shark in the sun?

934
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,840
 Yes, it does.

935
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:13,840
 It also mentions grandma shark.

936
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:19,840
 And since great white sharks don't reach sexual maturity till the mid 30s and the maximum lifespan is around 70,

937
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:23,840
 you hardly ever get grandma sharks in nature.

938
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,840
 And the sun picked it up.

939
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,840
 James, you absolute boffin.

940
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:31,840
 I love it when you blast inaccuracies.

941
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:34,840
 You've made it to the sun.

942
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,840
 I know, one of the honor.

943
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,840
 An official sun boffin.

944
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:41,840
 Oh man, that's huge.

945
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,840
 I just got one last thing just to quickly mention.

946
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:50,840
 In 2018, there was a story which I'm annoyed that I missed for the book, but it was a shark got...

947
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:54,840
 Well, someone attempted to steal a shark from a San Antonio aquarium in Texas.

948
00:38:54,840 --> 00:39:01,840
 And they did so by simply just taking it out of the water and dressing it as a baby in a buggy.

949
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,840
 They did not dress it as a baby.

950
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:04,840
 Well, they put it in the buggy.

951
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,840
 They just put it in the buggy.

952
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,840
 And they pretended that it was rolled back.

953
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,840
 And they just took it as a baby.

954
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,840
 A buggy does not count as baby clothes.

955
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:15,840
 They dressed it as a naked baby.

956
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:18,840
 They had it wrapped in a blanket.

957
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,840
 You'd wrap a baby in a blanket.

958
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,840
 They put it in a bucket.

959
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,840
 You'd put a baby in a bucket.

960
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,840
 And then they put the bucket in the buggy.

961
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,840
 I was fatherhood going down.

962
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:31,840
 I mean, there were challenges on the way out.

963
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,840
 So I don't think that's a baby either.

964
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,840
 Yeah, buggy looks fine.

965
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:36,840
 Buggy looks fine.

966
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,840
 I got a second.

967
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:39,840
 Yeah.

968
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:43,840
 Okay, that's it.

969
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,840
