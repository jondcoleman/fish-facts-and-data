 [Instrumental]

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:20.720
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.760
 to you from the QI offices in Covenant Garden.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.440
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin, and

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.840
 Anna Chazinski, and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.840
 facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.940
 Starting with you, Chazinski.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.480
 My fact this week is that in Amsterdam, the roads are paved with used toilet paper.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.720
 Let's catch his gold.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:54.320
 Yeah, Dick Wittington is very different there, and this is a really cool thing actually.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:00.200
 So the road constructor in the Netherlands called KWS has realised that to make a kind of

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.960
 improved version of tarmac, it can use the cellulose that it gets from recycled toilet paper,

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.760
 so the toilet paper goes into the sewage system, you flush it into the sewage system, and

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.560
 then they basically put it through kind of a sieve which gets the poo out.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:13.560
 That's important.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.660
 That's a really important stage of this whole process.

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.000
 It is, you don't want to be driving on poo.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 No.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.840
 Or walking on it, after a night out in Amsterdam, none of those things.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:34.280
 There's no poo in it, it's just paper and it thickens it apparently, so and it makes it

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.120
 better absorbing water, so it improves it's like water wicking away from the surface of

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.040
 the road, so it makes the roads less slippery, and apparently it reduces noise as well.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.840
 It's very quiet if you're walking on loop roll.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:45.840
 Right.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.840
 That makes sense.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:47.840
 So what's it mixed with?

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.640
 It's not just the toilet paper that's just laid down.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.120
 No, it's with asphalt.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.120
 It's the usual.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.120
 Okay.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.760
 It's usually ingredients.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.000
 I found a fact about what else you could make a road out of.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.320
 You could make a road out of rubber, which is cool, so it's like the whole road is made

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.320
 of tires.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.560
 If you're walking on that, you think it'd be easier to walk because you could bounce

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.560
 around.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.560
 I think so.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.560
 Yeah.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.600
 They have to use tires, by the way, not just rubber, but actual ground up tires.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.600
 Sorry.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.600
 This is what I mean.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.600
 Yellow stuff like that.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.600
 Oh, I didn't know it was in Yellowstone.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.240
 They partnered up with Michelin, I believe it was, and they've, yeah, been grinding up the

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.240
 tires.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.440
 But then the tires on the cars are basically riding over the dead comrades.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.440
 Exactly.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.120
 It's a bit depressing, isn't it?

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.120
 Very dark.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.320
 Is it the case then that we can just put anything in the roads?

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.840
 Should we just be putting everything we don't need in the roads?

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.040
 So far, we've got plastic rubber, toilet paper, nuclear waste.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.040
 Nuclear waste.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.040
 Nuclear waste.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.040
 What are we doing?

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.040
 Why is there even rubbish?

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.040
 Every time we chuck a packet out of the car.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.520
 We're literally on tarmac.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:50.520
 You cigarette butts?

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.000
 Oh, well, do you know this is a weird thing.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.360
 Lots of roads in London, we used to be paid for with wood.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.360
 Good.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.400
 And that was good partly because it was quieter under horses hooves.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.160
 And also, it was less slippery, but it did have downsides because it would soak up horse

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.160
 urine.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.400
 And then if a heavy wagon passed over it would just squirt horse urine.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.560
 That is a downside, isn't it?

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.680
 A place that has some quite exciting roads is Vermont.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.240
 So Vermont is covered in invisible roads.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.240
 Sorry.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.240
 Covered.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.240
 Covered.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.240
 Covered.

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.240
 Covered in non-existent roads.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.240
 And it was causing a major problem.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:34.400
 So basically, Vermont is the only state where if a road has ever been built or even planned

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.240
 or someone suggested that we might put a road here, it goes down legally as a recognised

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.240
 road.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.240
 And it can never be undone.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.440
 So mostly a road is discontinued legally after a few years if it's not being used.

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.840
 So if you look at sort of old maps of Vermont, it's just the whole thing, it's just roads.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.360
 And that means because roads are public highways, that means that you can have your house.

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.760
 It's probably on an ancient by way of some sort.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.760
 And people could just wander through your house any time of day because they can say look

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.960
 at this old map from 1790, this used to be a road.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.760
 And people were getting really annoyed with this.

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.560
 So I think they've actually had to address it.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.000
 And there was a law that came out in about 2009 which said, okay, guys, you've got to stop

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.800
 claiming there's an old road here so you can walk into this person's drawing room.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.560
 And places were told to claim their roads or lose them by 2015, I think.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.680
 It's only that one guy who goes, oh, excuse me, that used to be a road here.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.960
 It's got a million maps in fact.

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.360
 I've got to go somewhere.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.360
 Do you know how white lines on roads came about according to the internet?

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.000
 So I would say it's to make sure that people stay on their side of the road.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 It was that.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 Yes.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 But they were invented.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 Well done.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000
 10 points.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.960
 They were invented in 1911 in Michigan by I called Edward Hines.

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.400
 And this is just the kind of thing that with research is so annoying because the Michigan

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.560
 Department of Transportation and all these books say Edward Hines at the time he was chairman

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.320
 of the county board of roads.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.160
 And he came up with the idea of putting white lines in the middle to stop cars just driving

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.160
 in the middle of the road.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:07.480
 He came up with the idea after watching a leaky milk truck make its way down the road.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:11.400
 Now you read that and you're like, that's obviously not true.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.680
 He just thought, because the question is, why not?

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:14.680
 Why did he choose white?

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.320
 Well, because obviously you just choose white on black because if it was like a leaky

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.400
 chuck with milkshake truck, he would have brown lines.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.880
 There's just, and there's no evidence for it.

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.720
 I always wonder who comes up with these things first.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:29.720
 Who decides?

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:30.720
 Did he not clap?

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:37.760
 Well, there's certainly no evidence online of him crying over spilled milk, let's make

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:38.760
 a line out of it.

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:42.320
 But you say white being the obvious, but so at the time when they officially recognize

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:46.400
 that, yes, we want to put this on all the roads in America and white was picked, Oregon

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.560
 said we want to do in yellow and they thought that that was a much better color.

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:55.560
 Someone saw someone pissing on a road.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:03.640
 Yeah, but they eventually did change it to yellow strips in America for the center parting

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:04.640
 of a road.

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:05.640
 Oh, is it yellow in a road?

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:06.640
 Yeah.

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:07.640
 Yeah.

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:11.160
 You get yellow lines here and then red lines, which are the really serious ones.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.160
 So there are.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:13.160
 What are the serious ones?

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.160
 I don't drive.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.160
 So I don't.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.160
 I don't know.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.160
 I don't know if on a road I mean, really don't park here.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.160
 Yeah.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:19.160
 Yellow means you're probably fine.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.160
 Right.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:24.040
 So road, which means like, it's roads going in and out of big cities where you really

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:28.440
 do not want anyone ever parking that technically on a yellow lines, you can park there for

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:29.440
 like 10 minutes.

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:30.440
 Okay.

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:31.440
 If you're loading, you're unloading.

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:32.440
 Is that so?

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:33.440
 Yeah.

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.440
 Someone swatted up for their theory test, didn't they?

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:36.440
 Yeah.

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:37.440
 Yeah.

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.440
 So I can see you failing it.

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:40.440
 Well, technically though.

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:44.640
 Technically, I have a lot to drive through this bad front room.

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:48.920
 And who wants to take the QIL phone is next driving to Jesus.

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:54.920
 Something I've always found really amazing about road surfaces is a fact about Bitumen, which

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:58.360
 I remember finding this out in the end series when I was researching the Nabatean, so with

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:02.600
 this amazing Middle East and civilization, but basically the reason they were like the

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:08.600
 richest civilization from about 500 BC to 200 BC in Arabia.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.920
 And they got rich by selling tarmac.

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.760
 And the way they got tarmac was they were near the Dead Sea.

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:18.000
 And this weird thing happened when there was an earth tremor of some sort, huge amounts

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.440
 of Bitumen would just suddenly bubble up to the surface of the Dead Sea.

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:25.520
 So these massive islands of Bitumen just appeared and they would sit there like the size

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:26.520
 of houses.

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:30.280
 And then the Nabateans would just row or swim out to them, climb onto them, and hack the

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:33.920
 Bitumen off and then go and sell it and they sell it to the Egyptians who used it in

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:34.920
 embalming.

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:35.920
 And they became super rich.

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:40.760
 And I just find that whole thing, like islands of tarmac, sort of exploded up.

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:41.760
 That's amazing.

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:45.800
 And I think the word mummy comes from Bitumen because of that thing, I think, I think so.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:46.800
 Does it?

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:47.960
 It comes from a word for Bitumen.

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:48.960
 Yeah, yeah.

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:49.960
 I wonder why it stopped.

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:50.960
 Presumably it stopped.

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:52.160
 I think it ran out.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:53.160
 Wow.

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:54.160
 I think they got all of it.

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.440
 They scavenged all the, all the Bitumen.

00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:00.920
 Speaking of things that came out of the ground unexpectedly.

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:02.920
 Subströmling.

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:07.160
 A man in the dutch city of Amsterdam has recently been injured after a pop-up public

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:12.520
 toilet that was sunk into the ground emerged unexpectedly.

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:16.760
 The man was hit by a moped, which was thrown up in the air.

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:20.280
 So there's like a toilet that just comes out at night for revelers and stuff like that and

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:21.920
 they keep it underground normally.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:25.480
 But just for some reason, it just popped up and there was a moped on top of it and it flew

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:26.880
 in the air and it hit this guy.

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:27.880
 Wow.

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:28.880
 So cool.

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:29.880
 How fast do they pop up?

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:33.240
 Is it going to blow as they swing out around like a Japanese ball?

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:34.240
 Amazing.

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:35.240
 That's terrifying.

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:39.040
 I've got a fact about toilet paper, actually, while we're on toilets.

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:41.240
 This is another thing you can make toilet paper out of.

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:43.240
 You can make it out of milk.

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:44.240
 What?

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:45.240
 Yeah.

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:48.600
 There's a company, I think it's a German and an Italian company.

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:52.880
 They teamed up, one made fabrics and one was a design company or something.

00:08:52.880 --> 00:09:00.020
 Anyway, they made this thing, which is called Kareza Delatte, which is milk caress.

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:04.560
 And it uses a protein, which they extract from sourd milk.

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:05.560
 So it's a waste milk.

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:08.960
 If the cow has been ill and you can't sell the milk to customers.

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:11.720
 How do you get sour milk?

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:12.720
 No, no.

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:15.840
 If I have a normal milk and it going off, it's not like, oh, this milk is off, it must have

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:16.840
 been a sick cow.

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:17.840
 Sorry.

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:22.880
 If they take the normal milk from sick cows and then it sows.

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:23.880
 All right.

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:24.880
 Okay.

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:25.880
 The separate thing.

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:26.880
 So it's waste milk.

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:30.840
 So the farmers can sell it for a very small amount, not for the drinking milk price.

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:34.960
 But then you can turn it into toilet paper, which I guess you can also eat.

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:38.800
 So you can, if you're hungry on the loo, you can just eat a bit of this milk toilet

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:39.800
 for a sick cow.

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:40.800
 I don't want to eat milk.

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:41.800
 Milk lear over my sick cow.

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:42.800
 But wait.

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:44.840
 Is milk bad if it's from a sick cow?

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:45.840
 Yeah.

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:46.840
 That was another thing I was thinking.

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:47.840
 Like I'd never thought of that.

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:48.840
 I don't.

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:49.840
 It depends how sick I guess.

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:50.840
 Yeah.

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:51.840
 Yeah.

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:52.840
 It depends what's in the.

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:53.840
 It depends what bacteria are in the milk.

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:54.840
 It depends what's in the milk.

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:55.840
 It depends what bacteria are in the milk.

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:56.840
 It depends what's in the milk.

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:57.840
 It depends what's in the milk.

00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:58.840
 It depends what's in the milk.

00:09:58.840 --> 00:09:59.840
 It depends what bacteria are in the milk.

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:00.840
 It depends what's in the milk.

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:01.840
 It depends what's in the milk.

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:02.840
 It depends what bacteria are in the milk.

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:03.840
 It depends what's in the milk.

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:16.840
 That toilet, I've never seen the one James you were talking about earlier that comes through the ground.

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:17.840
 That's a problem you don't see.

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:18.840
 It's the last minute.

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:19.840
 Yeah.

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:20.840
 And they're very good.

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:21.840
 They're good for women.

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:22.840
 They make them.

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:23.840
 So the ones in London that you see are purely urinals for men.

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:24.840
 But these ones can be used by women.

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:25.840
 And they've just.

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:26.840
 They seem to have innovations for toilets that are sort of groundbreaking.

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:27.840
 There's an amazing one.

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:28.840
 You guys remember the.

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:29.840
 Yeah.

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:30.840
 In that case.

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:31.840
 Yeah.

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:32.840
 Remember the little fly that got used on a urinal for men?

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:32.840
 Yeah.

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:36.840
 It's that a urinal would have a little drawing of a fly in the center of it.

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:40.840
 And that would encourage men to try and aim to hit the fly.

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:41.840
 I saw that, unfortunately.

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:43.840
 There was also a fly in the room flying around.

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:46.840
 So I kind of chased him around with a chance of urine.

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:47.840
 That was.

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:48.840
 Yeah, I was not pretty at all.

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:50.840
 Not welcome back to that restaurant.

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:55.840
 But yeah, so that was that was debuted in the 90s in Amsterdam's airport.

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:56.840
 Yeah, shifl, isn't it?

00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:57.840
 Yeah, and shifl.

00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:58.840
 Yeah.

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:02.840
 And that's now used globally to help the reduce spillage that happens in a lot of bathrooms.

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:03.840
 That's good.

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:04.840
 Yeah.

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:06.840
 In the Netherlands, making waves in toilets.

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:08.840
 Basically, I think we've learned from this.

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:10.840
 Another bit of neverland toilet technology.

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:11.840
 Oh, yeah.

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:13.840
 Rotterdam has a revolving toilet.

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:16.840
 Well, that sounds extremely disconcerting.

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:18.840
 Can you think of what that might be?

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:19.840
 Is it a public toilet?

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:20.840
 Yeah.

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:21.840
 It's not a revolving restaurant.

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:22.840
 Nope.

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:23.840
 Okay.

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:24.840
 Is it because they couldn't afford a door.

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:27.840
 So it's a way of turning your back on people while you we.

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:28.840
 So they can't see you.

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:29.840
 Really good idea.

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:31.840
 They'd still be able to see the back of your head.

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:34.840
 Does it have a big sail on top and whichever wind direction is prevailing?

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:36.840
 The toilet face is that way.

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:37.840
 For what reason?

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:40.840
 So that the we doesn't blow back at your face.

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:41.840
 Exactly that reason.

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:43.840
 No, not that.

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:46.840
 It's because it's got two toilets in it.

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:48.840
 And so you use one of them.

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:49.840
 And then you walk out.

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:52.840
 And there's a detection that can tell there's no person in it.

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:56.840
 And then it flips around the two toilets and it can clean the other one.

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:58.840
 While the other toilet.

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:01.840
 So the previously clean one is now in that place.

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:02.840
 Do you know what I mean?

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:03.840
 Yes, yes.

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:04.840
 Does that make sense?

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:05.840
 Well, I'm inside one toilet.

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:08.840
 Is someone else going to be cleaning the other toilet and I have to wait for them to finish that?

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:10.840
 I think it's kind of robotic cleaning.

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:11.840
 Right.

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:12.840
 So yeah.

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:15.840
 So you're there and you use the toilet and then you leave and then it flips around.

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:18.840
 So there's now a clean toilet there and the old one is being cleaned by a robot.

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:19.840
 Possibly.

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:20.840
 That's great.

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:21.840
 It's not a human.

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:22.840
 I've mentioned it to a crowd that you just hear your voice go.

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:23.840
 Oh, jeez.

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:24.840
 That's right.

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:26.840
 Oh, man.

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:36.840
 Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is Andy.

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:41.840
 One frequent result of winning the lottery is going bankrupt.

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:46.840
 This also applies to people who just live near people who have won the lottery.

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:47.840
 Very good.

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:48.840
 So it's so unfair.

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:51.840
 What I mean, neighbors of lottery winners tend to go bankrupt basically.

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:53.840
 It's doubly unfair, isn't it?

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:54.840
 Yeah.

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:55.840
 Really?

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:56.840
 Why?

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:57.840
 Well, because you've not won the lottery and you've gone bankrupt.

00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:58.840
 Yeah, it is.

00:12:58.840 --> 00:12:59.840
 It is doubly unfair.

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:00.840
 Yeah.

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:01.840
 It's weird.

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:02.840
 So why?

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:07.840
 Well, there's a study that's been done by researchers at the University of Alberta in Canada

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:12.840
 and Georgetown and they studied a Canadian province which had 7,000 lottery winners.

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:18.840
 And what they found was in areas where people won the lottery, the bankruptcy rate goes up by 6%.

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:23.840
 This might be because people keep it a secret, the fact that they've won the lottery.

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:27.840
 So people borrow more around them because they want to keep up with the Joneses as it were.

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:29.840
 They're like, "Oh, wow, they've got a yacht."

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:33.840
 I think we better get a yacht and they start borrowing more money and then they take more money.

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:34.840
 Why do we need that?

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:36.840
 We live in the middle of Canada.

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:41.840
 But they take more risks and they borrow more and then they're likely to go bust.

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:43.840
 I suppose it doesn't even have to be a secret, right?

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:47.840
 Even if you know they've won the lottery, if you see them buying something nice, then you want to keep up.

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:48.840
 Exactly.

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:53.840
 And I think one of the studies find that the neighbours would buy conspicuous goods,

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:56.840
 because obviously you're buying goods that you want people to see, you want people to know

00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:58.840
 that you're doing as well as those neighbours who've won the lottery.

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:05.840
 So it said they'd buy things like cars, posh cars, but wouldn't spend money on indoor items like furniture.

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:09.840
 I just got a sit in the car if you need to sit.

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:13.840
 Just empty bar and homes.

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.840
 Seven Ferrari's outside.

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:16.840
 Wow.

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:18.840
 So I guess a statement making as opposed to, yeah.

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:19.840
 Yeah, exactly.

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:20.840
 It is.

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:21.840
 It's classic keeping up with the Joneses.

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:22.840
 Yeah.

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:27.840
 And it's nearly a third of lottery winners declared bankruptcy according to some estimates, isn't it?

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:28.840
 Wow.

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:29.840
 It's amazing that.

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:33.840
 I think in America, winning the lottery sometimes doesn't mean winning the big prize.

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:36.840
 It can mean winning a smaller amount.

00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:40.840
 They just still would call that winning the lottery whereas I think in Britain, if you say I won the lottery,

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:42.840
 you have to win over a million quid, I would say, right?

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:43.840
 Yeah.

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:45.840
 So there are lots of studies.

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:52.840
 There's one which I found debunked saying that 70% of lottery winners go bankrupt, which I think there's not much evidence for.

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:55.840
 That's just too many.

00:14:55.840 --> 00:15:02.840
 But I found out the saying that lottery winners are likely to declare bankruptcy within the first five years after winning the prize.

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:03.840
 Then the average American.

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:04.840
 Right.

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:07.840
 Because in the first two years, you're probably fine because you probably haven't spent all the money within two years.

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:08.840
 Yeah.

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:11.840
 I was reading about Britain's first ever lottery.

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:14.840
 So this was over 450 years ago.

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:16.840
 This was in 16th century.

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:20.840
 And the prize was not just money.

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:22.840
 You'd got other items as well.

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:24.840
 So runners up would have a prize.

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:27.840
 So you would get gold jugs or linen.

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:29.840
 And the lottery took three years to do.

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:32.840
 So you took three years to buy ourselves a gold jug.

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:35.840
 Because the next star of just a gold jug.

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:36.840
 But check this out.

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:40.840
 If you just bought the ticket alone and you didn't win anything,

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:43.840
 what that ticket did give you was a prize as well.

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:46.840
 Which was you avoided any kind of arrest.

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:48.840
 You had a pardon.

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:49.840
 You had a pardon.

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:53.840
 As long as it wasn't murder and something that really was, you know,

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:57.840
 you'd stolen someone's entire contents of their house, including their gold jugs,

00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:00.840
 you would have a pass on being arrested.

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:03.840
 You take a chance and you get a get out of jail free card.

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:04.840
 Yes.

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:06.840
 Is this that this is Queen Elizabeth, isn't it?

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:07.840
 It is, yeah.

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:10.840
 Because you wanted to raise lots of money for a shipbuilding.

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:12.840
 And I think the legal immunity only applied for a week.

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:13.840
 It was seven days, yeah.

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:14.840
 It was so that you could go in.

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:15.840
 And it was.

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:19.840
 It was if it, so it didn't count if you committed piracy, murder, felonies or treason.

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:22.840
 And it was so that you could go into towns and buy a ticket.

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:24.840
 Because she was desperate for people to buy a ticket.

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:25.840
 It wasn't she.

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:28.840
 And if you went in as a criminal and there was a wanted sign on the door, then people would.

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:29.840
 Oh, wow.

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:31.840
 It was like a version of the purge.

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:33.840
 Like you have this everyone suddenly, seven day window.

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:34.840
 But that's what I was wondering.

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:36.840
 People surely didn't just buy it and then do something illegal.

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:37.840
 Did they?

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:38.840
 That kind of happened.

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:39.840
 I'd steal another ticket.

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:40.840
 Oh.

00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:41.840
 After seven days.

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:42.840
 After seven days.

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:43.840
 Perpetual scam.

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:44.840
 Yes.

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:45.840
 Yeah.

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:47.840
 But after you stolen the ticket, I'm not sure you're immune anymore.

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:48.840
 Because then you've bought it.

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:50.840
 So I think you're just immune when you go into buy it.

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:54.840
 So I think as soon as you committed that crime, they'd be like, we've got what we want after you.

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:59.840
 There's one that was done, which was in Sweden, which was a speed camera lottery.

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:01.840
 And that was, it was you would buy lottery.

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:05.840
 And it would use all the money that it was generating from people who were going past speed cameras and speeding.

00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:06.840
 And access money.

00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:14.840
 So it kind of turned it into a thing where you actively wanted to not get caught because you could then win the money from people who were speeding.

00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:16.840
 It was a sort of psychological thing.

00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:17.840
 Oh wait.

00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:21.840
 If you were speeding, were you not eligible to win the speed camera fund?

00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:22.840
 I think everyone was allowed to answer that.

00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:23.840
 Yeah.

00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:24.840
 I think you must have been, you couldn't be excluded.

00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:25.840
 Oh yeah.

00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:26.840
 You weren't incentivized to not speed.

00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:27.840
 You were actually incentivized to speed.

00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:30.840
 So there was more fund in the, in the speeding lottery.

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:31.840
 Not really.

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:34.840
 You're only winning your own money back.

00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:37.840
 You're more incentivized to egg other people on the speed.

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:38.840
 Yes.

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:39.840
 Yes.

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:42.840
 Just everyone sat in a bus going faster, faster.

00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:44.840
 I've kind of been my kid through college.

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:47.840
 We've mentioned, we've previously mentioned the dog poo lottery, haven't we?

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:48.840
 In Taiwan.

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:49.840
 I think we lost it.

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:50.840
 We have.

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:51.840
 It sounds like the kind of thing we went.

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:52.840
 Yeah.

00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:55.840
 We had to have a bag of dog poo to get a ticket.

00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:56.840
 Oh, okay.

00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:59.840
 So is that incentivizing you to make your dogs poo?

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:01.840
 It's incentivizing you to poo in the bag.

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:02.840
 It's really incentivizing.

00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:04.840
 Do you think they should, they must have checked.

00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:06.840
 I don't think they'd run the strict DNA checks.

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:08.840
 That's not the dog poo lottery.

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:12.840
 Mr. Murray, we notice you don't actually own a dog.

00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:16.840
 And yet you've answered this 500 times in the last week.

00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:18.840
 We have questions about your diet.

00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:25.840
 I was reading about the guy whose job it is to go around and tell people that they've won the lottery.

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:26.840
 Oh.

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:28.840
 Which I think might be one of the best jobs you can have.

00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:31.840
 So he's in Britain, he's a guy called Andy Carter.

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:36.840
 And he basically is the person who goes to people's houses once they know they've won and ask what they want to do about it.

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:38.840
 They want to set up a bank account.

00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:40.840
 Oh, they already have one.

00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:42.840
 Do they want to put their money in it?

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:44.840
 Do they want to keep it under the mattress?

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:45.840
 That kind of thing.

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:47.840
 He doesn't sound very professional.

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:51.840
 Every week he's like, you already have a bank account.

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:52.840
 Wow.

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:54.840
 I've got to get myself one of those.

00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:58.840
 Yeah, he gives them various bits of advice and stuff.

00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:00.840
 And he's, yeah, so he's called Andy Carter.

00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:02.840
 And he says that he often has to go in disguise.

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:05.840
 So he'll often have to go as like an estate agent.

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:09.840
 If I saw Andy Carter rocking up the road now, I'd be like, ah, that's him.

00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:11.840
 No one knows what he looks like.

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:12.840
 Oh, why?

00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:13.840
 But that would be great to me.

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:14.840
 If you saw Andy Carter walking up to you.

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:20.840
 But if you see him walking up to your neighbour, the point is that 85% of people keep their identity secret because they're all such greedy cars.

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:24.840
 But no one knows what Andy Carter looks like.

00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:27.840
 But they see us a big name badge.

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:29.840
 Which I doubt he does.

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:32.840
 He usually dresses as one of those big lottery balls.

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:36.840
 It just has to cover that up with a cloak when he visits.

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:39.840
 You know, if a weird man walks up to your neighbour's door, you'll ask them who?

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:41.840
 I don't think anything about it.

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:42.840
 I don't know my neighbour's.

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:43.840
 I've been London.

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:44.840
 I don't know.

00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:45.840
 I've met most of my neighbours.

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:47.840
 Well, people are very nosy in the region.

00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:55.840
 I would assume it was one of my neighbours if I saw Andy Carter walking up to you.

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:56.840
 Anyway.

00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:59.840
 Andy did say he gets some quite weird people.

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:01.840
 People are so secretive.

00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:08.840
 So he said once he had to go and organise the lottery wins with a man who was keeping it secret from his entire family.

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:14.840
 And so he said, he when he visited the man, he said he was pacing around the room and asking me how long the visit was going to take as his wife had popped out to Tesco.

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:16.840
 And he wasn't planning to tell her.

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:17.840
 Oh, God.

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:20.840
 He reassured me they're perfectly happy, very much in love.

00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:22.840
 She's just not interested in the money side of things.

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:23.840
 Wow.

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:24.840
 That's pretty dodgy, isn't it?

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:25.840
 Wow.

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:27.840
 As those two are not together anymore.

00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:28.840
 No.

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:31.840
 He does always bring his balls with him.

00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:36.840
 He says it's one of the first things people want to see.

00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:37.840
 Yes, he does.

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:44.840
 No, I think that I do see why he's in, you know, in disguise.

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:49.840
 If weird man comes to the door and they're saying, can I see your balls, please?

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:51.840
 Oh, it must be Andy Carter.

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:55.840
 No, they just do estate agents and they sell things these days.

00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:59.840
 Almost a good reason to want to win the lottery, because I didn't test on meeting Andy Carter.

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:00.840
 I'm really weird.

00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:02.840
 And I know I think to come dressed is a particular thing as well.

00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:03.840
 To bring his balls.

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:04.840
 Yeah.

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:06.840
 They're not his balls.

00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:08.840
 They're not his, they're the lottery's balls.

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:11.840
 People always want to see a few example balls.

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:14.840
 They don't want to prove you're Andy Carter.

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:17.840
 Show me your balls.

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:20.840
 Oh, anyway.

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:24.840
 Robert Mugabe won the Zimbabwe and national lottery tickets.

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:25.840
 What?

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:26.840
 Just a fact.

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:29.840
 Where are the chances?

00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:38.840
 Did you know that in 2014, 80% of donations to the Scottish Peron Dependence campaign came from one Euro Millions lottery winner?

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:39.840
 No.

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:40.840
 Unbelievable.

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:45.840
 Well, this couple called Colin and Chris Weir and they got 161 million in 2011.

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:48.840
 And they, yeah, they provided 79% of the donations to that campaign.

00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:49.840
 That was money well spent.

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:50.840
 Wasn't it?

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:53.840
 [LAUGHTER]

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:57.840
 10% of people who win more than a million pounds by a caravan.

00:21:57.840 --> 00:21:58.840
 Do they?

00:21:58.840 --> 00:21:59.840
 Yeah.

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:00.840
 10%. There's quite a high proportion.

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:01.840
 That is.

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:02.840
 That's so weird.

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:04.840
 I wouldn't have thought the cost of a caravan was super prohibitive.

00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:07.840
 I wouldn't have thought you needed a million pounds to buy one.

00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:08.840
 To buy the top end.

00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:10.840
 But let's say you win a million quid.

00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:13.840
 You could probably give up your job.

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:14.840
 Yes.

00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:15.840
 You could give up your job, right?

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:16.840
 Yeah.

00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:19.840
 But probably you'd want to go on a lot of holidays.

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:22.840
 But you couldn't go on lots of massive really round the world.

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:25.840
 Gold-plated aeroplane holidays for a million quid, could you?

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:26.840
 You're right.

00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:29.840
 So you have to have something where you can go on nice holidays.

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:30.840
 Yeah.

00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:31.840
 But you don't have to pay a lot of money for it.

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:33.840
 You could live in a caravan until you died if you had a million quid.

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:34.840
 It's the dream.

00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:35.840
 [LAUGHTER]

00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:38.840
 Well, I'm giving up jobs.

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:43.840
 I read a really interesting stat, which is that 86% of American lottery winners

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:45.840
 and this is people who've won the jackpot.

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:46.840
 So they've won millions.

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:48.840
 86% of Americans stick with their jobs.

00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:51.840
 Whereas in the equivalent in Britain, 41% do.

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:53.840
 [LAUGHTER]

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:54.840
 Are we much lazier?

00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:55.840
 Would you, Anna?

00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:57.840
 I'd be out of fear like any shot.

00:22:57.840 --> 00:22:58.840
 [LAUGHTER]

00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:00.840
 God, have I find a five-fire note on the street?

00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:03.840
 [LAUGHTER]

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:08.840
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:10.840
 OK, it is time for fact number three.

00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:12.840
 And that is my fact.

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:16.840
 My fact this week is that the 10th Correspondence Chess Olympiad,

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:19.840
 which is done entirely by post, took so long to complete

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:22.840
 that the winners of both gold and bronze represented countries

00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:24.840
 that no longer existed.

00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:26.840
 [LAUGHTER]

00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:27.840
 Pretty amazing.

00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:28.840
 So funny.

00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:32.840
 So this is a competition that is still going to this day.

00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:35.840
 I believe they're on the 21st, although online,

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:37.840
 on Wikipedia, it says they're on their 10th.

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:39.840
 So maybe there's a few different governing bodies.

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:41.840
 The ladies' one is on its 10th, maybe?

00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:42.840
 Is it right, OK.

00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:43.840
 So here's the thing.

00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:45.840
 The match that we're talking about

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:47.840
 with the 10th Correspondence Chess Olympiad,

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:49.840
 that started in 1987.

00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:52.840
 And it takes years and years to finish the games

00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:54.840
 and get to the final and have a winner.

00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:57.840
 In fact, the 11th Correspondence Olympiad

00:23:57.840 --> 00:23:59.840
 started before the 10th even finished.

00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:02.840
 They just get forward and they go, "We want to get going."

00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:05.840
 So the winners of the 10th in gold place

00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:08.840
 was someone from the USSR.

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:11.840
 And in bronze was East Germany, both of which

00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:14.840
 were dissolved countries by the time the winning--

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:15.840
 [LAUGHTER]

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:17.840
 --the winner was announced in 1995.

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:20.840
 But these days, I think, most tournament matches

00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:24.840
 are limited to just only two and a half years.

00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:25.840
 Yes.

00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:27.840
 So these days, if you're still going after two and a half years,

00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:30.840
 then an independent arbitrator comes along and says,

00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:32.840
 "I think you're winning."

00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:33.840
 [LAUGHTER]

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:34.840
 It's amazing.

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:35.840
 So the system, the way it works,

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:37.840
 is that you send a postcard to the person

00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:38.840
 that you're playing against.

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:40.840
 And you have three days to make your move

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:42.840
 and send another postcard back.

00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:44.840
 So they look at the dates on the postcard.

00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:47.840
 But because of the mail taking so long in certain countries,

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:50.840
 you might not receive it for weeks, months even.

00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:53.840
 So it's very important that little date

00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:55.840
 that sits on the actual postcard itself.

00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:58.840
 Yeah, so it's the date that it arrives is when you start,

00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:01.840
 which you can just say that is whenever you want, actually.

00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:02.840
 Yeah.

00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:05.840
 So people have noticed that if people are really struggling

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:07.840
 towards the end, that it seems to take a lot longer

00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:09.840
 for the letters to arrive to them.

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:10.840
 Right.

00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:13.840
 But then when you send it, that's when the post mark

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:15.840
 is so you can't cheat that one, can you?

00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:16.840
 Yeah.

00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:18.840
 I really like the idea that you can use--

00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:19.840
 you can use help as well.

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:20.840
 Yeah.

00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:21.840
 So you can use books or magazines or the internet.

00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:23.840
 You can use anything short of running the entire game

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:26.840
 through a chess software program, which is found on--

00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:27.840
 It is, I'm banned.

00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:28.840
 Yeah.

00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:30.840
 But it means that the better players,

00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:33.840
 it's a slightly different skill to playing normal chess, isn't it?

00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:35.840
 So if you play normal chess, there's time limits.

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:37.840
 Apart from anything in the person you're playing against,

00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:39.840
 it just gets really barred and doesn't want to play anymore.

00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:41.840
 But in this, because there's not really any time limits,

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:43.840
 well, you say, you know, three days.

00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:46.840
 You have 30 days for every 10 moves.

00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:49.840
 So you could take, you know, 30 days--

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:50.840
 or 20 days if you want.

00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:51.840
 On one.

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:54.840
 I find that really worrying about this.

00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:56.840
 I think I would be extremely bad at it, because it's a classic

00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:58.840
 encouraging people to leave it to the last minute thing.

00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:00.840
 Yeah, you've got 30 days for 10 moves.

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:03.840
 So I know I'd forget about it for 29.5 days.

00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:05.840
 And then suddenly, you've got to send, you know, 10--

00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:06.840
 I know.

00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:07.840
 10 postcards.

00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:09.840
 And if you've done your move, yeah, I did mine days ago.

00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:10.840
 Yes, exactly.

00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:11.840
 Yes, James, come on.

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:13.840
 I'm just going to do this other thing.

00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:15.840
 I reckon it's more stressful.

00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:17.840
 There's a guy called Croydon H. Jarvis,

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:20.840
 who took eight years to complete one move.

00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:21.840
 What?

00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:22.840
 How?

00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:23.840
 In his defense, it wasn't his fault.

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:25.840
 So he started-- he was a British guy,

00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:28.840
 and he started playing Correspondence Chess with a German in 1931,

00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:30.840
 and they played a lot together.

00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:31.840
 And then in the middle of one of their games,

00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:33.840
 the war interrupted.

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:34.840
 And that was--

00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:35.840
 It probably wasn't his fault.

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:36.840
 No.

00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:38.840
 It was inconvenient for them, though.

00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:40.840
 So they couldn't post during the war,

00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:41.840
 because postcards were interrupted.

00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:44.840
 And for two years afterwards, they couldn't post to each other.

00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:47.840
 And then, I think, in 1948, he got a postcard from his opponent

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:49.840
 saying, look, mate, are you going to finish this game?

00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:51.840
 Why is I'm planning victory?

00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:52.840
 It's amazing.

00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:55.840
 And lots of people, even with the postal service,

00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:56.840
 wasn't affected.

00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:58.840
 They weren't allowed to do it, because people thought they were codes, didn't they?

00:26:58.840 --> 00:26:59.840
 Yes.

00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:00.840
 I think there's--

00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:02.840
 Even Hockfrey Bogart was visited by the FBI,

00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:05.840
 because they thought he was sending secrets through postal chess.

00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:08.840
 And what secrets did Hockfrey Bogart have access to?

00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:10.840
 He wasn't-- he was an actor.

00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:13.840
 Yeah, but he always played spies and movies, didn't he?

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:15.840
 Yeah, so yeah.

00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:17.840
 Yeah, there was one guy called Graham Mitchell,

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:20.840
 who wasn't there, who, a load of postcard service recently,

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:23.840
 which had bizarrely cryptic stuff.

00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:26.840
 So he was a deputy head of MI5 in the 1950s,

00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:32.840
 and he was corresponding using postal chess as a way of exchanging secrets in the past.

00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:35.840
 So it was reasonable that they would suggest that.

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:37.840
 Yeah, although he has been exonerated,

00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:41.840
 that is literally my personal opinion based on having read the postcards.

00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:43.840
 What did you get for the postcards?

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:46.840
 They just seemed like he wouldn't write sentences quite like that.

00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:53.840
 Instead of saying Queen to D4, he would say Queen to Balmoral on the 17th of April.

00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:57.840
 And there was a 19th century chess master called Joseph Blackburn,

00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:00.840
 who was arrested as a spy for sending chess moves through the mail,

00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:02.840
 because they thought they were secrets.

00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:06.840
 I really like him because he thought that drinking whiskey improved the brain.

00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:09.840
 And every time he played chess, he tried to prove it.

00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:13.840
 So he always drank whiskey during every game.

00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:18.840
 And according to the official records, he played more than 100,000 games of chess in his career.

00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:19.840
 Wow.

00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:22.840
 I've been looking at the chess records.

00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:25.840
 So he's full of absolutely great stuff this week of media page.

00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:26.840
 It's really funny.

00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:28.840
 But there was one which I really like, which is,

00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:30.840
 you know, people play simultaneous chess.

00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:32.840
 They played lots of games at the same time.

00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:34.840
 So I'm just going to read this over about him.

00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:39.840
 The worst result in a simultaneous exhibition given by a master occurred in 1951,

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:46.840
 when International Master Robert Wade gave a simultaneous exhibition against 30 Russian schoolboys aged 14 and under.

00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:49.840
 After seven hours of play,

00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:56.840
 Wade had lost 20 games and drawn the remaining 10.

00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:58.840
 That's a bad day, isn't it?

00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:02.840
 Maybe he was letting the win the case.

00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:04.840
 That is amazing.

00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:07.840
 So simultaneous chess is one very challenging form of chess.

00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:09.840
 It gets more challenging if you're blindfolded playing it,

00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:12.840
 which is the thing that people have done historically.

00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:17.840
 And this has been considered in history multiple times a really dangerous thing to do.

00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:20.840
 So blindfold chess has been, and you don't have to be blindfolded.

00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:23.840
 You just have to be not able to see the board when you're making your moves.

00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:26.840
 So it's about being able to memorize exactly the position of the board.

00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:30.840
 Because you'd knock over pieces.

00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:33.840
 So yeah, this is a thing, and it was quite popular in the 19th century.

00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:37.840
 There are prominent blindfold chess players. There are a couple called Morphe and Steinets,

00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:40.840
 both of whom played, and they kept having these mental breakdowns.

00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:43.840
 And so it spread that it would give you brain fever.

00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:47.840
 And there's a lot of reports say the USSR banned displays in it in 1930,

00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:50.840
 because it was so bad for your mental health, because it was too challenging.

00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:54.840
 Kasparov's coach spoke out against it and said, "This is bad for you."

00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:58.840
 And so Kasparov never played it, and it's thought that might be why.

00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:00.840
 So it's actually really dangerous.

00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:04.840
 You hold the whole board in your head. Don't you? You're not allowed to look at the board.

00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:08.840
 But what if I just, because obviously some of you might miss here,

00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:11.840
 you know, a three for a four, and be playing a completely separate game

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:13.840
 to the game that you're opponent.

00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:16.840
 I don't think you're going to miss here a three for a four, are you?

00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:17.840
 Well, I don't know.

00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:19.840
 A D for an E, E for and D for.

00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:21.840
 Yeah, exactly. Yeah, you're right.

00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:25.840
 So do they tell you if you've gone off board, if you're just playing?

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:27.840
 E 52.

00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:30.840
 To Z? No, you do not.

00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:33.840
 Yes, I don't know. You must lose immediately, right?

00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:37.840
 Otherwise, it can't be like, can I put that pawn on D for?

00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:39.840
 And they go, "No, you can't. That's no legal move."

00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:41.840
 Okay, what about the bishop to E5?

00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:42.840
 No, sorry.

00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:45.840
 You lost the bishop, 10 turns. What are you doing?

00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:48.840
 And you also something like battleship.

00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:56.840
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show.

00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:58.840
 And that is James.

00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:01.840
 Okay, my fact this week is that when they're about to be born,

00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:05.840
 baby sharks sometimes pop their heads out of their mother's cervix

00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:08.840
 before taking a look around, deciding against it

00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:11.840
 and retreating back into the womb.

00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:13.840
 What do they not like the look of?

00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:15.840
 Who knows, just the world.

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:16.840
 Wow.

00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:19.840
 You can't say we haven't all thought some stays in our lives.

00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:23.840
 Wouldn't it be better to just revert back into the womb?

00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:25.840
 That's horrifying.

00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:26.840
 It's amazing.

00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:27.840
 It's so good.

00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:28.840
 How many times can they do this?

00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:31.840
 Well, there'd be sort of a 10-year-old shark still in the womb.

00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:34.840
 It's like, "You've got to come out sometimes."

00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:38.840
 Well, we don't really know, because people don't really know

00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:42.840
 much about sharks, especially before they're born.

00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:45.840
 But this is quite a recent study by Kiyomi Marukama

00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:51.840
 and Takaturu Tamita, who developed an underwater ultrasound machine

00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:54.840
 and have been able to look at what's happening inside the body

00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:59.840
 of a tornied nurse shark as she has some embryos.

00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:01.840
 And they found this out.

00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:02.840
 There's a few other things.

00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:06.840
 They found out that the sharks have two uteruses

00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:10.840
 and the sharks like to swim between the uterine

00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:13.840
 and eat unfertilized eggs.

00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:15.840
 They're unfertilized brothers and sisters.

00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:16.840
 That's the thing that happens.

00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:17.840
 That's so cool.

00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:18.840
 They're practising.

00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:20.840
 They're doing their length before they come out of the womb.

00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:21.840
 It's super cool.

00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:25.840
 It's quite arduous, because there's quite a thin tube, isn't there?

00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:26.840
 Connecting them are you, Ben?

00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:27.840
 Connecting the two uterine.

00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:29.840
 And they squirm their way through it.

00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:33.840
 Swimming between two different bits of the womb just to eat your...

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:34.840
 Yeah.

00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:35.840
 Eats and eggs.

00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:36.840
 ...would be siblings.

00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:38.840
 And there's always more than one shark.

00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:40.840
 I think they give birth usually to three or four.

00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:43.840
 And so sometimes all of the sharks will be in one of the uteruses,

00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:46.840
 eating all of the eggs, and then they'll all migrate to the other uterus

00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:48.840
 and then eat all the eggs there.

00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:49.840
 And do they eat each other?

00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:50.840
 Is that a different species?

00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:51.840
 It's a different species.

00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:55.840
 These guys might do as well for a lino, but that's some sand sharks as well.

00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:57.840
 Yeah, some tiger sharks.

00:32:57.840 --> 00:32:58.840
 Yeah.

00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:00.840
 I guess that's the thing, though.

00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:03.840
 You might be looking out the cervix just thinking,

00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:05.840
 "Is this another room inside mum?"

00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:07.840
 Because you've already found one room.

00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:08.840
 How do you know?

00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:10.840
 Yes, massive.

00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:11.840
 Exactly.

00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:13.840
 Sharks and eggs are really quite clever.

00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:18.840
 So they recently discovered that they can react really well to predators.

00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:21.840
 Even as a shark's laid an egg and it's sitting there and they've done ultrasound

00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:25.840
 and they've found out that if there's even so much as a vibration nearby

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:29.840
 or if something walks nearby that's emitting slight electromagnetic radiation,

00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:33.840
 then the embryo inside senses it and it completely freezes

00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:37.840
 and it holds its breath because it knows that if it's even moving its gills,

00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:40.840
 then it's going to be giving off an electrical signal that the thing might be able to sense.

00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:42.840
 So even in the egg.

00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:43.840
 That's very cool.

00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:44.840
 It can be scared.

00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:45.840
 Yeah.

00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:46.840
 Wow.

00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:54.840
 Sharks, they have teeth and they have different teeth all the time.

00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:59.840
 So we've got baby teeth and adult teeth but they shed their teeth throughout the whole life.

00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:01.840
 But this actually starts before they're even born.

00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:07.840
 So they have teeth in the womb, embryonic teeth and they lose those and they get morty.

00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:10.840
 So they lose their baby teeth before they're even babies.

00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:14.840
 Does the mother shark have a load of loose teeth rattling around in her womb?

00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:16.840
 It seems like it might be that that might be true.

00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:22.840
 And also that this might have thrown like previous studies into distribute

00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:29.840
 because embryonic teeth of great white sharks are almost identical to adult teeth of sand tiger sharks.

00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:35.840
 So a lot of things that they thought were sand tiger sharks turn out to might turn out to be embryos of great white sharks.

00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:37.840
 It's such a hard to check through them all.

00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:38.840
 Wow.

00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:44.840
 It's such a niche crisis in the plastic studies world.

00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:48.840
 But yeah, they have sharks and have up to 50,000 teeth in their life.

00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:50.840
 Some of them shed teeth once a week.

00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:53.840
 Which just must mean they are loaded too very well.

00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:56.840
 Although I don't know where she'd leave it.

00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:57.840
 The money.

00:34:57.840 --> 00:34:58.840
 On the seabed.

00:34:58.840 --> 00:34:59.840
 On the seabed.

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:00.840
 Oh.

00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:01.840
 Lovely.

00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:02.840
 Very nice.

00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:10.840
 So we do know so little about birthing of shark for example a great white shark we've never seen one be born ever.

00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:11.840
 Yeah, it's amazing.

00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:14.840
 We've somehow just not managed to see that.

00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:22.840
 And so occasionally aquariums and other such places studying these sharks get inside into ways that they give birth.

00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:28.840
 And New Zealand and aquariums are an amazing thing where there was a shark that was giving birth but was having problem with the birthing process.

00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:40.840
 So another shark came up and bit its abdomen and in the process allowed it was basically a sea section gave it a sea section and the little sharks were able to swim out and both the baby sharks and the mother shark survived.

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:41.840
 The incident.

00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:45.840
 Yeah, so it was just they were just witnessing some sort of bizarre technique.

00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:48.840
 Wait, so another shark bit the abdomen open.

00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:49.840
 Yeah.

00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:50.840
 So that things could escape.

00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:51.840
 That is extraordinary.

00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:52.840
 Yeah, it's weird.

00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:55.840
 I also can't believe they can do it well enough that the shark survived.

00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:58.840
 You would have thought if you're tearing open the abdomen of a shark let's babies out.

00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:01.840
 Yeah, and they didn't they didn't even know that the shark was pregnant as well.

00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:02.840
 So that was a huge surprise.

00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:06.840
 They just sort of another shark was eating a shark and then suddenly they were just performing surgery.

00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:10.840
 Could it be that they were just eating the shark and it just so happened that there was a baby in there.

00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:11.840
 That is possible.

00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:12.840
 Yeah.

00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:16.840
 So sharks can have virgin births even if they are not virgins.

00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:17.840
 No, they can't.

00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:18.840
 They can.

00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:21.840
 But isn't that by definition impossible of virgin births?

00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:25.840
 So it's like the Virgin Mary isn't.

00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:30.840
 But in 2017 there was a leopard shark in Australia which had previously mated with a male.

00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:33.840
 And then I think they said, oh we don't actually want any more sharks to be born.

00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:40.840
 So they moved her into her own bit of the aquarium and then she kept laying eggs like a chicken.

00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:42.840
 She laid the eggs like a chicken.

00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:43.840
 Yeah, yeah.

00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:44.840
 She was clucking.

00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:46.840
 She wagged her fins around.

00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:50.840
 No, she laid these eggs just you know non fertile eggs as they called.

00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:51.840
 Right, got it.

00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:53.840
 But then some of them started hatching.

00:36:53.840 --> 00:37:01.840
 So these were clones basically of herself which she sort of switched from a sexual into an asexual mode.

00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:03.840
 That's never been observed before.

00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:04.840
 Wow.

00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:05.840
 That's weird.

00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:09.840
 It's a fresh excuse for sorry my boyfriend climbed into my bedroom in the middle of the night and I didn't tell you, isn't it?

00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:10.840
 The asexual reproduction.

00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:14.840
 I don't know how it's happened.

00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:17.840
 So that can I talk about baby shark the sun?

00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:20.840
 Yeah, you'd be waiting so patiently.

00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:23.840
 Well, it's just because you say that they can have virgin birth.

00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:25.840
 So that means that there's no daddy shark.

00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:26.840
 First of all.

00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:27.840
 Okay.

00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:31.840
 And I would mean other famous hawking link, isn't it?

00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:37.840
 So I tweeted this a while ago and today when I was googling baby sharks for this podcast,

00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:42.840
 I found an article in the sun from September last year saying baby shark has been blasted

00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:46.840
 over factual inaccuracies by boffins on the internet.

00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:52.840
 Several Twitter users have taken to the site to point out the various ways that EO worm has got biology wrong.

00:37:52.840 --> 00:38:00.840
 Podcast and QI researcher James Hark pointed out no idea that this is the sun in September last year.

00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:01.840
 No idea that they called it.

00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:03.840
 Wait, what did you point out?

00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:04.840
 I posted pointed out two things.

00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:07.840
 One that sometimes there's no daddy shark because they.

00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:09.840
 Does it mention daddy shark in the sun?

00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:10.840
 Yes, it does.

00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:13.840
 It also mentions grandma shark.

00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:19.840
 And since great white sharks don't reach sexual maturity till the mid 30s and the maximum lifespan is around 70,

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:23.840
 you hardly ever get grandma sharks in nature.

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:25.840
 And the sun picked it up.

00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:27.840
 James, you absolute boffin.

00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:31.840
 I love it when you blast inaccuracies.

00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:34.840
 You've made it to the sun.

00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:36.840
 I know, one of the honor.

00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:38.840
 An official sun boffin.

00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:41.840
 Oh man, that's huge.

00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:43.840
 I just got one last thing just to quickly mention.

00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:50.840
 In 2018, there was a story which I'm annoyed that I missed for the book, but it was a shark got...

00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:54.840
 Well, someone attempted to steal a shark from a San Antonio aquarium in Texas.

00:38:54.840 --> 00:39:01.840
 And they did so by simply just taking it out of the water and dressing it as a baby in a buggy.

00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:03.840
 They did not dress it as a baby.

00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:04.840
 Well, they put it in the buggy.

00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:06.840
 They just put it in the buggy.

00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:08.840
 And they pretended that it was rolled back.

00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:10.840
 And they just took it as a baby.

00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:12.840
 A buggy does not count as baby clothes.

00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:15.840
 They dressed it as a naked baby.

00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:18.840
 They had it wrapped in a blanket.

00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:20.840
 You'd wrap a baby in a blanket.

00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:21.840
 They put it in a bucket.

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:23.840
 You'd put a baby in a bucket.

00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:25.840
 And then they put the bucket in the buggy.

00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:27.840
 I was fatherhood going down.

00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:31.840
 I mean, there were challenges on the way out.

00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:34.840
 So I don't think that's a baby either.

00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:35.840
 Yeah, buggy looks fine.

00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:36.840
 Buggy looks fine.

00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:38.840
 I got a second.

00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:39.840
 Yeah.

00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:43.840
 Okay, that's it.

00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:45.840
 That's all of our facts.

00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:46.840

00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:05.840
 No such thing as a fish or go to our website.

00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:07.840
 No such thing as a fish.com.

00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:13.840
 We have everything up there from previous episodes all the way to links to our upcoming tour of the UK.

00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:14.840
 Please come along.

00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:15.840
 It's going to be amazing.

00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:17.840
 We'll see you again next week with another episode.

00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:18.840
 Goodbye.
