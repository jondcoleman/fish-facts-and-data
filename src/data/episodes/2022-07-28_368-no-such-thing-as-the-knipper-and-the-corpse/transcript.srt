 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,560
 from four undisclosed locations in the UK. My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,

4
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:31,200
 James Harkin and Andrew Hunter Murray and once again we have gathered around the microphones

5
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:37,360
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in a particular order here we go. Starting

6
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,720
 with you, Andy. My fact is that after his death Anton Chekhov was brought back to Russia in a

7
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:51,120
 refrigerated railway car labelled Fresh Oysters. Wow. So was he your nice? Oh I don't know if he

8
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:58,080
 was actually all nice. I know that he was he was pre-chilled for that. I think he was he was

9
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:02,880
 chilled because the last thing before he died was he had some champagne which would have been cold

10
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:11,040
 as well. Oh yeah. So yeah this is a 1904 he was 44 years old very young to have completely you know

11
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:17,040
 revolutionised Russian literature and he was in a spa in Germany because he had tuberculosis

12
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,240
 and the doctor arrived and when the doctor arrived because things were nearing the end

13
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,480
 his tuberculosis was really bad at this point. He sat up straight and he said to the doctor

14
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:32,640
 Ich staube which is I'm dying and the doctor just said let's have some champagne because there was

15
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,560
 this German medical convention which was that if you can't do anything for the patient you just get

16
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,440
 them some champagne and that means they know what's going on and so do you. Okay that's interesting

17
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:47,040
 but he didn't really speak very good German right? Tol Chekhov and so I find it quite interesting

18
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,400
 that he'd picked up this one he must have known that he might need that phrase. He didn't know

19
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:58,320
 he was going to die so he said before he boarded the train to Germany he said to his friend I'm

20
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,840
 off now I won't see you again I'm going to Germany to die so I suppose he was prepped to check out

21
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:10,720
 the I'm dying phrase. Yeah he was a medical doctor wasn't he so he sort of his whole life was sort of

22
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,280
 he saw the little hints of what was going to happen in his near future he thought he would try

23
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,920
 and go to the spa to sort it out it didn't work out but what's amazing is he got given this big

24
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:26,640
 flute of champagne and he downed it all in one go and then he sort of laid back and after a few

25
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:32,880
 moments that was it he was gone what an ending. Yeah well they say that but I mean you don't down a

26
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:36,320
 massive flute of champagne without there being at least a little burp at the end do you?

27
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:41,840
 Probably just before he went there would have been a big belch I reckon. Yeah the account that

28
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:49,520
 we have is from Olga Knipper his wife then widow and she sort of says it was very calm and very

29
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:54,880
 peaceful and he sort of laid down turned his head and passed away but there are other accounts

30
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:59,520
 that were written that didn't come out for years and years afterwards by another kid who was in

31
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:05,360
 the room who was assisting the doctor and as James said there was a sort of great burpy groan.

32
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:12,320
 Oh really? Yeah knocks out the poetry of Olga's account. Oh the Olga declined to mention that.

33
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:20,880
 She was one of Dennis the menace's pets wasn't she? Well his body then went to Moscow in this

34
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:28,080
 train which said fresh oysters on it but when he arrived in Moscow station there were people

35
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:34,240
 kind of waiting for his body because he was a big famous you know hero in Russia but apparently

36
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:39,280
 this is what I read when he came back there was another person who died the same time called

37
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:45,760
 General Keller and the state had organized a big sort of fun for for his body returning

38
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:52,240
 and a military band and a parade and stuff and so a load of Chekhov's fans just started following

39
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:59,200
 General Keller's funeral procession thinking it was Chekhov which he was in the refrigerator

40
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:04,800
 railway car next to it labeled fresh scallops and there was a bit of mayhem. It's a comedy it's

41
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:09,920
 a faulty tower style comedy mix-up where you want Basil faulty to expose at the end what he thinks

42
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,480
 is a pile of oysters and is actually the corpse of Anna. So weird that you mentioned that because

43
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,720
 I was thinking about faulty towels already for a different reason related to Chekhov's death

44
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,520
 which is that after he died they put him in a laundry basket which is kind of like the episode

45
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:31,600
 The Kipper and the Corpse. And what was his wife's surname? Kipper? The Canipper and the Corpse.

46
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:38,560
 The Canipper and the Corpse. Oh my god. Yes. Are we blowing shit wide open again? Oh no let's

47
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:44,560
 let's have a week off blowing shit wide open. Too late! Too late! The Canipper and the Corpse.

48
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,840
 That's got there's no such thing as the Canipper and the Corpse. But they but they couldn't fit

49
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:54,240
 him in properly because obviously he was um he was a little stiff by the time they tried to

50
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,160
 fold him up and laundry is more flexible than Chekhov and so he was in a half sitting position

51
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,760
 in the basket. Oh my god. Pretty undignified I know and it was it was to hide him from the other

52
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:08,080
 guests basically. It's a bit more dignified than you know how you fold laundry by two people holding

53
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:13,120
 each end of it walking towards each other. You can't do that with Chekhov can you? No way.

54
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,160
 It's really nice as a witness account as someone accidentally passing them as they were trying to

55
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,440
 sneak Chekhov out. No. In the laundry basket. Yeah and he said I walked behind the man carrying

56
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,680
 the body light and shade from the burning torches flickered and leaped over the dead man's face

57
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:33,440
 and at times it seemed to me as if Chekhov was scarcely uh perceptibly smiling at the fact that

58
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,080
 by decreeing that his body should be carried out in a laundry basket fate had linked him with humor

59
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:43,760
 even in death. Oh that's so nice because I was just gonna say I reckon Chekhov would have loved that

60
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:48,480
 way the worst thing because he was kind of a comedy loving guy. He would have really enjoyed

61
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:53,920
 that and I suppose that that guy saw the same thing. Yeah yeah. He started out as a comedy

62
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:58,880
 writer really didn't he? Well he thought he was a comedy writer at the very end as well but not

63
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,520
 everyone else agreed with him. Yeah very confusing is that the thing where like with the cherry orchard

64
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,800
 he was insistent the cherry orchard was a comedy and the famous director who put on the first

65
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:14,640
 production was Konstantin Stanislavski who insisted it was a tragedy and staged it as such

66
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:18,240
 and it's kind of sad because it's the last thing that was put on before he died and Chekhov was

67
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,880
 furious. They hadn't been interpreted as a sort of a farce. I think it's amazing because you have

68
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:28,800
 Chekhov who's like one of the great short story writers and playwrights of history

69
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,600
 and then you've got Stanislavski who's one of the great theatre producers ever and you know he's

70
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:39,280
 where the Stanislavski method comes from and you know when American actors are doing the method

71
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,200
 that's basically the Stanislavski method that they kind of brought over to America. So you've got

72
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:49,680
 two greats who came together and Chekhov wrote this play and on the front page it says comedy

73
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,320
 it says a cherry orchard a comedy and then Stanislavski writes back to him going I think it's a

74
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:59,520
 tragedy mate and it's like how can you say that to the writer how can you say I don't think it's a

75
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:07,200
 comedy yet I think it's amazing. And then Chekhov wrote when he first saw this play he wrote how

76
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:12,880
 awful it is an act that ought to take 12 minutes at most last 40 minutes he has ruined the play

77
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:18,800
 for me and Stanislavski wrote the blossoms had just begun to appear when the author arrived and

78
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:25,440
 messed everything up for us. So it's like these two greats and they just couldn't agree I think it's

79
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:32,560
 amazing. That's incredible and then in between there is Olga Knipper who acted in all of Stanislavski's

80
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:38,160
 versions of Chekhov and that is how yeah that's how Chekhov eventually so it would be a situation

81
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,280
 where he probably didn't want to see the plays but he had to see the plays because he was madly

82
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:46,160
 in love with this girl and get closer to her and because they eventually married after she'd done

83
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,960
 I think four of his plays or so. That must have been so awkward because I think the cherry orchard

84
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,600
 was after they were married and she must have been so torn between these two people. I mean do

85
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:02,320
 you think she would do one scene serious and one scene comedy or yeah maybe when Chekhov came into

86
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:09,360
 the room she'd put on a red nose and some big things. She was bizarrely she acted in the cherry

87
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:15,840
 orchard in 1904 she was madame Ranevskyer who's basically the main part controversy over who

88
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:24,480
 is the main part so 1904 and then she did it again 1943 same part. That's got to be one of the longest

89
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:30,400
 gaps between the same role. She was 36 for the first and 75 for the second. She outlived him by a

90
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:36,240
 really long way because he died in 1904 and she died in 1959. Do you know what I find the weirdest

91
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:42,000
 thing about Chekhov is that as we were saying before he's this huge author and he's today he's

92
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,640
 still considered to be one of the all-time greats. I kept reading in a few places that

93
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:52,640
 just he's sort of under Shakespeare as the person with the most film adaptations and plays that are

94
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,520
 on and I can't I haven't seen any of his stuff and I can't think of a single short story and I just

95
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:03,120
 find that fascinating that I read a lot I see a lot of things yet this guy is second to Shakespeare.

96
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,520
 His plays got put on a lot I would say and definitely in London you would get it. We had

97
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:12,720
 tickets to watch the Seagull just before lockdown we never got to see it in the end with what's

98
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,920
 the name from Game of Thrones Amelia Clark was it? Oh yeah yeah but yeah his plays are excellent

99
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:24,640
 I love those but honestly Dan and anyone he was in my top three favourite writers I would sometimes

100
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:29,120
 say as my favourite writer his short stories are heaven. You'd sit down and read one of those

101
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,440
 before you read Cloud Your Way Through the Merry Wives of Windsor. Definitely and good news they're

102
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:42,560
 quite short Dan. I read log books. I read just for this I read what's it called the the woman and

103
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,560
 the dog. The woman with the dog. The woman with the lap dog or whatever. Yeah and I've tried to

104
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,680
 read it in Russian because you know I'm learning Russian a little bit and I'm kind of okay and

105
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:57,360
 the standard of writing is it's quite simple it's quite easy to read it's like he has lots to say

106
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,240
 about the human condition and about you know love and the way that people react with each other but

107
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:07,680
 actually it's in really nice easy to understand writing. I can read big words. I can read big

108
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:14,000
 words James. We should say that not everyone respected him quite as much so Tolstoy hated his

109
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,760
 stuff. Tolstoy said that Chekhov is an appalling playwright but at least he's not as bad as Shakespeare.

110
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:26,160
 But he also have really hated Shakespeare. Well actually they were good mates but they

111
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:31,440
 Tolstoy and Chekhov. Yeah they were. I think he said that right to his face he was like I hate this

112
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:37,200
 but at least it's not as bad as Shakespeare. And he loved his short stories so Tolstoy used his

113
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:42,880
 daughter Tolstoy's daughter said that Tolstoy used to make them read the short stories aloud at

114
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:48,800
 dinner and his early funny stuff and the daughter said that Tolstoy my father was usually a good

115
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:53,360
 reader but with Chekhov he was often quite unable to go on so infectious did his helpless fits of

116
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:58,400
 laugh to become and he was sort of laugh until he cried and he I think he was on the people who

117
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:02,240
 said why doesn't Chekhov understand that he's just a great comedy writer you know stick to that.

118
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:07,920
 And he just knocked about as well that's what I love about them. He decided he wanted to be a

119
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:13,520
 writer because he needed to support his family and he just it was only over about 20 years that he

120
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:18,720
 wrote all these things like 700 short stories or something and they were all literally just like

121
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:24,320
 okay we'll get this out to the to the Moscow Times to the St. Petersburg Times every month or so you

122
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,000
 would have at least two or three of Chekhov's stories in there they'd be all under different

123
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,920
 pen names he didn't know they were all from the same person. Well someone who I've become a bit

124
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:39,200
 obsessed off the back of Chekhov now is a lady called Constance Garnet. Now this is just what

125
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:44,880
 a remarkable story so it's really thanks to her that we have Chekhov in the English language as

126
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:51,760
 well as Tolstoy and other great Russian writers. She sat down with a Russian dictionary having

127
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:58,080
 not spoken a single word of Russian until the age of 29 and she translated all of these books

128
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:03,520
 and that is how the English speaking world got introduced to all of these people and just a

129
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:09,680
 remarkable person. She is she's such a weirdo she just randomly decided to withdraw and devote her

130
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:14,480
 life to that and yet changed 20th century literature I guess because all literature was then influenced

131
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:20,160
 by the Russian greats and she churned it out too she did like hundreds of Chekhov stories all of

132
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:27,040
 Turgenev all of Tolstoy's novels almost all of Tolstoy all Dostoevsky. Oh my god I hope she started

133
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:33,200
 with Chekhov. Yeah ease her way in and the reason she started is because she had a difficult

134
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:38,320
 pregnancy in 1891 where she was kind of confined so she thought nothing else to do except learn

135
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:44,800
 Russian and she did and then 1894 she just abandoned her husband and her toddler went to Russia

136
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,840
 and hung out with Tolstoy for a bit and so like can I can I start translating your novels please.

137
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:54,480
 Amazing. Yeah and she and she didn't start easy you know one of the first translations was a

138
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,440
 religious and philosophical piece by Leo Tolstoy which was called the kingdom god is within you

139
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:05,920
 I mean a really hardcore first thing and she had terrible vision at the end so she kept translating

140
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:10,720
 sort of into her late life but she would have someone sitting there reading it out

141
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:17,040
 while she translated so she sort of had assistance alongside her helping her to do it and the reason

142
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:23,040
 that they became so popular around the world is because she was she was it from a publishing

143
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:28,400
 family her husband worked in publishing as well and she was able to press them as really cheap

144
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:32,640
 books so people could afford them and they could just get out there into the wild in a in a way

145
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:38,080
 that people could could buy them affordably that's that's the real reason that they into the attraction

146
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:44,880
 into the wild novels galloping through the rainforest. I tried to find if there's a single

147
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:51,600
 removals firm in the UK called Uncle Vanya and I can't find one Jesus and I think what a gap in

148
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:58,880
 the market that is yeah yeah what about a um is there like a really happy tree surgeon called the

149
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:06,240
 cheery orchard that's good yeah so many gaps in the market everywhere are these gaps in the market

150
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:11,760
 are just terrible jokes I'm sure I would trust a removals firm called Uncle Vanya I think these

151
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:16,080
 guys are going to look after my books okay his nickname in the UK was Willy Wetleg

152
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:23,280
 really why Florence nicknamed him Willy Wetleg because um Willy Wetleg just I don't know why

153
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:27,920
 it's but audiences in the UK were not wowed by early jack-of-plays because they didn't like the

154
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,160
 lack of obvious plots or clear meanings some of them some of them are quite you know

155
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:37,360
 non-committal and there isn't a definitive answer that's right I read a review in the Daily Express

156
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:44,000
 from the time which said that the cherry orchard was a silly tiresome boring comedy there is no plot

157
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,920
 the orchard is for sale and certain dull people are upset because it must be sold wow it's a decent

158
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:58,000
 summary of the plot oh is it um so this is coming from someone who as I say doesn't hasn't read any

159
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,960
 of Chekov was the idea that it was all character studies and just amazing dialogue and sort of

160
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:08,080
 insight into the human condition I mean there's quite a lot of social commentary a lot of stuff

161
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:13,680
 about um kind of aristocracy can we spoiler the can we spoiler the cherry orchard are we

162
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,800
 going to get in trouble for that I don't think I don't think we're going to go for the ending

163
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:21,680
 this big messed up family is having crazy philosophical debates and then shagging each

164
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:27,040
 other and um getting angry and making up stuff like that you know it's like neighbours we haven't

165
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:32,640
 even mentioned Chekov's rifle or Chekov's gun oh yeah it's impossible to find out if Chekov actually

166
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:36,240
 owned a gun because whenever you google the phrase Chekov's gun it only comes up with the dramatic

167
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:41,120
 principle that he kept saying which is if there is a gun hanging on the wall in the first act it

168
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,840
 has to go off uh in the second pretty and he said different versions of it but that's broadly it

169
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:50,480
 don't introduce a plot element that's a big heavy thing and then not play it out but I kept on trying

170
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:56,960
 to find out if he did have a gun yeah why have what why why try and find that out yeah I think

171
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:02,320
 that's interesting it's relevant did he have it Chekov's gun was it real yeah was he you know

172
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:07,120
 could he really talk about guns or had he never seen one in his life and he's you know exactly

173
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:12,800
 was he bluffing yeah sorry for trying to do my homework Dan sorry sorry yeah I don't know why

174
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,400
 I questioned it no I was just curious if there was an extra thing about it that I didn't realise

175
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:20,880
 there was absolutely nothing here's a pointless um here's a pointless fact about Chekov uh the Seagull

176
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:26,400
 in russian is um Cheka it's called that's russian but it's not russian for seagull it's just russian

177
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:33,520
 for gull uh because actually the play is set in the middle of ukraine or russia nowhere near like

178
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:39,360
 thousand miles from the sea and so yeah we just translated it as seagull but really it should be

179
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:45,040
 gull that's probably bloody constant it's garnet isn't it bringing her seagull base i think

180
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:51,360
 see that's a good fact to look into Andy this kind of thing you should be focusing on that will

181
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,840
 absolutely delight or mythological fans because of course there is no such thing as a seagull

182
00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:02,000
 yeah and there's no such thing as the seagull either there you go nice yes did you guys spot that

183
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:08,320
 thing about the theory that he didn't die of tuberculosis and how they've been looking into

184
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:13,920
 they've reopened the case they've reopened the case i've got them into it come on this this was

185
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:20,960
 a thing whereby did he drown in a bed of oysters suffocated in some laundry basket

186
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:30,720
 he um he supposedly died of a brain hemorrhage and this was this was scientists took some proteins

187
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:38,000
 that were on his shirt and they analyzed it and um they they think what showed up sort of

188
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,720
 suggests that the tuberculosis was a lifelong thing that he had under control that it was

189
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:48,480
 manageable but actually he was suffering from huge pains of a brain hemorrhage and yeah so they

190
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:53,600
 they just analyzed this is and this is only a few years ago that they managed to get these samples

191
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:58,160
 and that's the theory they dig them up again together it's a good question it was on his

192
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:03,840
 clothes so i assume that maybe the clothes must have been saved it's relics yeah got it it's not

193
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:08,480
 what you want when someone says of a historical character he actually didn't die this way what

194
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:15,280
 we want is he was murdered by his furious lover by his by a gun which may or may not have belonged to

195
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:22,560
 him if they accused his wife of killing him and she didn't really she could say i was done up like

196
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:38,800
 a clipper okay it is time for fact number two and that is james okay my fact this week is that

197
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:44,720
 earlier this year a woman reported that she was bleeding from her eyes whenever she was on her period

198
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:51,280
 wow is it i euphemism no is that okay none of that sentence is euphemism you wouldn't say eyes

199
00:18:51,280 --> 00:19:00,960
 plural would you um that's mental yeah so does i mean so many yeah i'm just waiting for the

200
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:07,840
 questions and then i'll tell you but okay can you buy i tampons you cannot buy i tampons no oh well

201
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:12,320
 then i feel really sorry is it the same is it the same blood that's kind of traveled through the body

202
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:18,160
 and up out the eye okay if you if you squeeze her by the tummy that started off as a reasonable

203
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:27,040
 question so i'll answer it so there is a thing um that it that can happen called vicarious menstruation

204
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:31,760
 and it seems to be a kind of hormonal thing we're still not exactly sure why it happens

205
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,760
 but it means people can bleed from different parts of their body when they're on the period

206
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:41,200
 so people have been documented as bleeding from the nose that's quite common like nose

207
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:47,920
 bleeds the nipples the intestines the skin things like that it's extremely extremely rare

208
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:53,040
 but earlier this year this is a report in the british medical journal there was 25 year old who

209
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:58,480
 visited an emergency room and she was having blood coming from her like near from her tear ducts

210
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:05,440
 when she was on her period and there's also a thing called hemo lacrea which can make blood

211
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:10,720
 come out of your eyes there's lots of different things that can cause that so that could be caused by

212
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:15,040
 you know abnormality in the sinuses problems with the tear ducts there's lots of things that

213
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:18,800
 can cause that but the doctors went through everything that that could have been and realized

214
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:23,840
 it couldn't be any of those things and they think that this is vicarious menstruation

215
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:29,520
 and hemo lacrea put together and this is the first time that it's ever been reported in any

216
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:35,200
 medical journal now it seems to be quite benign they can't see any other problems from it it's

217
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:41,120
 just the thing that happened they gave her some hormonal therapy and it has gone away so it seems

218
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:47,280
 to be a hormonal thing like the vicarious menstruation would be but that's it this is a thing that

219
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:52,000
 happened extraordinary so it's not her womb wandering around her body we're not about to

220
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,040
 say Aristotle was right we're not saying oh that would have been the biggest shit to blow wide open

221
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:03,360
 of all everything parent i've read that there was a 1995 study that found that 18 percent of fertile

222
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:09,520
 women do have some blood in their tears is that right trace amounts of blood yeah seven percent

223
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:16,000
 of pregnant women eight percent of men 18 percent of fertile women and then postmenopause no women

224
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,640
 have it oh i see so it comes study but interesting so you can cut down that phrase blood sweat and

225
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:26,640
 tears you can just say blood and sweat or tears and sweat yeah that's good that's going to save

226
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:35,520
 us all some time well i did also say that some people can sweat blood due to vicarious menstruation

227
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:42,240
 so you could just say blood oh great much easier if anyone ever says to you blood sweat and tears

228
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:51,840
 just go to autology mate do you think uh i'm sure you don't uh that groups of women living together

229
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:57,760
 start to experience synchronized menstruation oh it's what people say but i think i've read

230
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:04,800
 things that say that that's not true but anecdotally so many people whenever i've said to them and said

231
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,880
 well it is true so i don't know what you're talking about yeah that's i saw that as well

232
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,760
 medically according to the reports not true i know so many women who've told me that that's

233
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:19,120
 what's happened with them so who do we believe yeah i think the larger more recent studies

234
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,960
 which say it doesn't happen i thought i reckon that's what they were that's what they were saying

235
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:27,680
 to baristotle back in the day weren't they they're saying i've spoken to lots of women and they say

236
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:32,400
 that their wombs do not move around their body you're like nope nope this is what the scientists

237
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:38,960
 say studies have shown um yeah i think the largest and longest studies have found no evidence for it

238
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,800
 there is plenty of random overlap that might be seen as synchrony if you look at it through a

239
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:46,560
 shorter time window so there are plenty of reasons why you might think it is happening but

240
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:51,840
 but no i think it's confirmation bias i think it just overlaps enough that every four months

241
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:56,880
 that happens and they go oh my god we must be synchronizing right okay but it does

242
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,440
 happen with lions that's the key so maybe everyone you've asked has actually been a lion in this

243
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:09,840
 do you guys think and i don't think you do but do you think that bears are attracted to menstruation

244
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:17,680
 are attracted how just as in section come closer to what yeah yeah well finella's finella's cousin

245
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:22,320
 was once told to escape a forest because the the guide found out she was menstruating it was like

246
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:26,640
 you got to get out of here now and they just left to run her own to just yeah she had what she had to

247
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:32,480
 leave the wood at her at her husband's stage and she was like never found again she's now living in a

248
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:39,840
 gingerbread house wow really that's amazing and what did you get attacked by a bear don't know

249
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:46,000
 no because i have a feeling james is about to say that that's a myth well it is a myth but i'm

250
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,200
 still a bit worried about this guide at all where they just say anyone who's menstruating get out of

251
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:57,760
 here now and you're on your own there was a study relatively recently done uh where 15 used tampons

252
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:03,840
 were presented to male black bears that were feeding in a garbage dump uh and they found

253
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:09,840
 there was no uh reaction uh from the bears i mean at least at least they had the courtesy

254
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:17,200
 not to go oh get out of my face but all this study says to me is that bears prefer garbage dumps

255
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:22,080
 to use tampons it doesn't necessarily mean that but yeah it could be the second best thing on the

256
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:28,400
 menu yeah the um a lot of different tribes think that periods will attract dangerous animals i think

257
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:34,000
 the warry people of brazil uh the women wouldn't be allowed to go into the forest when they were on

258
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,480
 their periods because jaguars would be attracted to them and they weren't allowed to have sex either

259
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,640
 because then jaguars would be attracted to the men who were out hunting because they'd have sex

260
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:49,200
 with someone wow it's like it follows it's like cracking film and a niche reference that some

261
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:55,280
 people will get that's but they also have another really cool practice uh these guys or this is

262
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:59,600
 actually a thing i was reading in the 60s about them so it might have changed but whenever a mother

263
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:04,400
 was on her period her whole family her husband and children all painted themselves with red food

264
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:12,240
 coloring wow that's amazing that is such a good idea weird right i think we should bring that in

265
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:17,120
 kind of a hassle a bit messy you could make a lot and food coloring only comes in those tiny tiny

266
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:24,880
 vials yeah so what you could do is paint yourself in the new pantone shade uh called period um which

267
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:32,560
 they brought out relatively recently um it's it's very red it's very very red it's not blood red

268
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:38,480
 it's just red red um but they brought it out uh according to them um to so people can own their

269
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:43,120
 period with self assurance to stand up and passionately celebrate the exciting and powerful

270
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:48,800
 life force they are born with to feel comfortable to talk spontaneously and openly about this pure

271
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:54,560
 and natural bodily function and by having some red paint that will help us to do that but i think

272
00:25:54,560 --> 00:26:00,400
 if we all painted ourselves red we'd definitely be able to do that yeah yeah i feel liberated already

273
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:07,680
 paint my wall in period that makes a big difference if you go to a property website and they say

274
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:18,160
 well this of course is a period property uh a lot of period features oh my word um sharks also don't

275
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:26,320
 go for menstruation they know they they like fish it turns out and they like it i mean this was a

276
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:30,000
 thing that this is a thing that is also thought i think like the bears you know they've got a great

277
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,840
 sense of smell sharks and um you know if uh you are menstruating then and you're in the water

278
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:39,280
 maybe you're going on a swimming with sharks experience it might lead to trouble it turns out

279
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:44,080
 really they're like the chemicals in fish blood and they have good enough nose to detect fish from

280
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:52,000
 human blood um and also menstrual blood is mostly not blood it's it's mostly you know the the lining

281
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,720
 of the womb it's secretions there's trace of blood but it's not uh yes yeah so feel free to go swimming

282
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:01,760
 with sharks if you're if you're hanging out on the edge of the water worried about it don't be

283
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:06,960
 has anyone heard of the sanitary products known as sphagnikins?

284
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:13,440
 no no they sound a bit scandy no okay it's not scandy um the name comes from what they were

285
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:23,520
 made of sphag sphagnikins sphag sphag swags oh like sphagnimos then sphagnimos so they used to have

286
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:30,000
 the sphagnimos girls um which were images that they used to advertise sanitary products made from

287
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:38,160
 andi's favorite material moss wow there you go the sphagni the the the moss girls yeah they were

288
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:45,120
 known as the sphagnum moss girls wow when were these ladies around uh it was the middle of the 20th

289
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:52,960
 century is that i can't can't do is that there's nothing moss can't do lovely um one thing that's

290
00:27:52,960 --> 00:28:00,400
 of quite a hot potato in a lot of countries is the tampon tax and um in germany in 2019

291
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:05,200
 there was something that was actively done about it in order to raise awareness so

292
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:12,560
 it's taxed as a luxury good this is in 2019 at 19 percent um which is ridiculously high in comparison

293
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:17,600
 to so many other things say like books which are only charged at seven percent so there was a brilliant

294
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:24,000
 book that was released called the tampon book which had inside of it 15 tampons which was sold

295
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:30,160
 so you could buy them for much cheaper than you would a normal pack um of tampons uh in the tax

296
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:36,320
 sense and um they sold 10 000 copies once they released it so it was sort of becoming a best

297
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:42,720
 selling book in its own right but yeah tampon tax has been a horrific thing that we've still not

298
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:47,280
 solved in the uk just passed something though which yeah i think they have just passed it haven't

299
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:52,240
 they in the uk i don't know i know you get free sanitary products in schools out of very recently

300
00:28:52,240 --> 00:29:00,400
 in the uk now you do have to be a pupil i say this for a better experience all right

301
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:06,800
 have you got any moss does anyone got any moss just standing on the school gates

302
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,640
 or on the school roof scraping on

303
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:23,520
 okay it is time for fact number three and that is my fact my fact this week is that

304
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:33,520
 touch screens can now be operated using muffins oh wow finally well okay so this is a discovery by a

305
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:41,200
 scientist in belgium called florian heller and he realized that the electrical field of a capacitive

306
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:46,320
 touchscreen could be altered by using different materials so usually it'd be your finger or it'd

307
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:52,240
 be a type of metal hence styluses um and he discovered that if you used a fresh out of the oven

308
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:58,320
 muffin that the moisture was enough and the humidity was enough that it could be electrically

309
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:04,480
 conductive to this particular type of screen okay so we can recognize it being touched and

310
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:10,880
 that's the kind of one that you have on your phone most of them will be yeah yeah i did then spend

311
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:16,080
 most of my research time going around my bedroom seeing how many objects work me too but actually

312
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:22,720
 not around your bedroom around my house i did wonder what you were doing in here um there was

313
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,720
 nothing surprising it's not very exciting i mean it's obviously stuff that you know conducts electricity

314
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:32,000
 you know you're although i was quite excited that my spider plant does wow so if my spider

315
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,640
 plant became conscious it could hack into my phone okay let me give you some examples and see if you

316
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:45,920
 can guess whether they work a great yes yes yeah all right uh plumb yes no oh i think you're kind

317
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:51,440
 of right as a group because it did work but it didn't work very well um a piece of alpaca poo

318
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:58,960
 no oh my god you opened up our trophy in order to test this um a year or so ago we got an award

319
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:05,680
 in Vienna which was a small vial of alpaca poo i opened it up and took up one of the little

320
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:10,560
 currents of poo and tried to use my phone with it did it work or did it not work uh i'd say yes

321
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:18,160
 there was a current with your current yeah it did not work oh it didn't work to try an egg

322
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:25,520
 which bit of the egg the shell yeah just an egg just an egg from the fridge oh no no way no not in

323
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:34,000
 shell not in shell you're right uh damp egg no i don't think that i'm gonna say yes oh definitely

324
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,600
 put a bit of water on the egg and it works so anyway um thanks for listening to my tab talk

325
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:46,080
 that's things that wow what an insight to your brain that you went from egg to damp egg like most

326
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:50,640
 people would have moved on to the next object but one thing that's really interesting and i did try

327
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:55,360
 this in my house but actually i read it on the internet is a battery so if you try and use a

328
00:31:55,360 --> 00:32:01,440
 battery to um operate your phone it will only work if you use the negative side of the battery

329
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:06,800
 and if you use the positive side of the battery it won't work uh and that is the explanation really

330
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:13,120
 of how these things work because you have a tiny little electrical difference in your finger uh

331
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:18,640
 and that's what the phone can tell you know it's very very slightly charged your skin and that's

332
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:22,080
 how it can tell the difference and so there's not a current it's not like there's a current

333
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:27,440
 obviously running from the ground through you to your phone no it's like you know if you have static

334
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:32,720
 electricity yeah um because you've been walking on a carpet or you've been rubbing a lot of balloons

335
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:38,960
 against you or something then that you get a little shock um well that shock actually happens

336
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:44,080
 all the time you always have that kind of tiny difference in electricity in your body like the

337
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:48,080
 inside of your body is positively charged and the outside of your body is very slightly negatively

338
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:53,680
 charged and that's what the phone can tell yeah so it's just connecting a circuit it's like putting

339
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:58,800
 the crocodile clip on the circuit when you're at school your finger is literally connecting

340
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:07,040
 that little circuit slight putting the damp egg on the on the stop saying damp egg so but is this

341
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:11,360
 so when when you don't have you know when because some people or sometimes your finger

342
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:15,440
 doesn't work on your phone it's really annoying and that is that due to your having more dead skin

343
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:20,560
 for example so if you've got really thick skin does that damage it yes andy do you have zombie

344
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:25,680
 fingers some people have this i don't know but if i was a lumberjack for example i might do yes

345
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:32,480
 you're working for my company cheery archard exactly you'd need to get yourself a stylus

346
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:38,720
 what is zombie fingers at her uh well it's for lumberjacks it's a particularly suffered by

347
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:43,520
 lumberjacks and guitar players as well have it and yeah as if you've got very callous fingers

348
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:48,160
 they're very dry so they're not conducting as well uh the recommendation is lick your finger

349
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:54,800
 or if you are one particular woman let's use a damp egg just use a damp egg you can't quite get

350
00:33:54,800 --> 00:34:00,800
 because it's not very pointy is it um one woman got a refund on her chromebook because she insisted

351
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:05,680
 that it just did not respond to her fingers wow okay so i didn't know this this is really cool

352
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:10,000
 when they were making the iphone they still didn't have the keyboard touchscreen worked out the year

353
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 before it was launched and they developed this technique to work out what you're going to type

354
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:20,560
 next to kind of predict it so if you hit t on your phone yeah the phone they they know that you're

355
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:25,440
 likely to hit h next because of the word for example and there are all these probabilities

356
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:30,480
 they can work out so when you've hit t what they call the hit region around the letter h on your

357
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:37,520
 phone keyboard it grows a bit so that so it stays the same size to your eye and on the screen but

358
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:42,720
 beneath it the technology knows that so there's this hit region around h which swells a bit and

359
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:48,160
 then once you've hit t h the hit region around e will swell a bit so there's this quivering pulsating

360
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:53,760
 map that we can't see what if you wanted to write tug or something like would it does it mean you're

361
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:58,160
 more likely to make mistakes with more unusual letter pairs i think that's what it means but

362
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:04,080
 fortunately we don't write tug much so i can't there are no words other there are no words

363
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:09,680
 that they give tg i don't think uh no i might try typing tg on my phone now what if you were

364
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:16,560
 typing the word cat gut that's got a tg brilliant brilliant why i should type that more often than

365
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:22,000
 the word the technology it should have brought it up do you know who invented the touchscreen

366
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:32,160
 it was a man called bent stumpy um no what stumpy what a first name for mr mr stumpy

367
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:40,480
 he was an engineer at CERN and he was working with someone called frank beck uh and frank

368
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:47,200
 beck asked bent stumpy um to solve the problem of to build some uh hardware for an intelligent

369
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:53,120
 system which in just three console units would replace all the conventional buttons and switches

370
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:56,320
 sorry i was just reading that but basically they wanted to get rid of all the buttons and

371
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:02,320
 switches and replace them with a new system uh and bent stumpy went away and a few days later

372
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:08,240
 he came back with three different solutions um one was a tracker ball one was a programmable

373
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:13,600
 knob don't know exactly how the knob was programmable uh and the other one was a touchscreen

374
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:19,120
 wow yeah he should be the steve johns of the time they probably said to him listen we'd love

375
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:22,800
 to make you global famous but the name it's just not going to work mate no one's going to buy this

376
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:29,760
 product and he wouldn't give it up he wouldn't give up the name no stumpy is s s t u n p e i think

377
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:35,360
 it's stumpy it could be bent stump i'm not sure i think that's much better that was the only option

378
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:41,120
 he offered them he was like okay i'll make it bent stump my final offer the first time that was used

379
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:45,760
 was in air traffic control right when when that came along and then it just wasn't using anything

380
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:53,680
 else for 30 years so it was in 1960 literally the mid 60s 1965 um and air traffic controllers used it

381
00:36:53,680 --> 00:37:00,400
 and they called it a touch wire display and it must have been so advanced in 1966 as an air traffic

382
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,400
 controller there was one wire that's attached to a computer that's getting into information about

383
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:09,840
 when all the planes are landing and what time and what platform um or whatever runway platform

384
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:17,280
 and then the other end of the wire would connect to the screen and then the bottom of the screen

385
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:21,360
 that wherever you touched it would touch a specific bit of wire that would transmit information back

386
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:27,600
 and forth and they were doing this for 30 years and yet it wasn't until really the 80s the LA 80s

387
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:31,600
 90s that it was incorporated into other tech it's amazing to think that jimmy henricks could have

388
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:36,400
 used a touchscreen if he had worked in air traffic control but he couldn't have because he was a

389
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:44,480
 guitar player so they wouldn't have worked for him. Oh my god! Brilliant yeah um stuff on muffins

390
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:51,360
 or that? Oh if you've got yeah um so the british museum might have been established as a result of

391
00:37:51,360 --> 00:38:00,080
 a muffin. What? So you might know that the british museum was established by Sir Hans Sloan uh after

392
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:06,080
 he died all of his collection were put into this new museum um because he had been collecting

393
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:12,160
 these loads of weird things like antiquities rare books all sorts of stuff he kept them in his house

394
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:17,600
 and then when it got too much in his house he bought a house next door and put it all in there

395
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:22,880
 and he had loads of friends loads of famous friends who would come and like have dinner with him and

396
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:29,920
 have a look at his amazing stuff um but once he was visited by Handel and Handel apparently put a

397
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:36,640
 buttered muffin on one of his rare books and Sir Hans Sloan was absolutely furious about this and

398
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:42,320
 he was like I can't have the place where I have my dinner parties in the same place as the place

399
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:48,800
 where I have all my rare stuff so he bought a new place out in Chelsea and he put everything in there

400
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:53,920
 and it became a little museum of its own rights rather than a house and then it was all the stuff

401
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:59,600
 from there that became the british museum wow that's awesome yeah do you think Handel was just

402
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:04,640
 being very ahead of his time and trying to operate what he thought was a kind of amazing touchscreen

403
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:17,440
 muffin okay it is time for our final fact of the show and that is Anna my fact this week is that

404
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:25,280
 in 2012 Southwest Airlines agreed to fly a single butterfly 2000 miles after it overslept and missed

405
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:34,240
 its ride oh it's adorable it is what a good service to have offered this was uh this is a

406
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:39,520
 problem with this butterfly spotted by a woman called Marilyn Manos Jones she was in Albany New

407
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:46,560
 York and she saw in her garden a monarch butterfly and she happened to be a butterfly expert so she

408
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:51,280
 knew that it was well she was watching it from like metamorphosis stage and she knew it was

409
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:57,280
 metamorphosing too late so often when the caterpillars go into their chrysalis stage

410
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:01,840
 they'll sometimes wait it out too long emerge late they'll emerge a bit damaged a bit unhealthy if

411
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:07,280
 they're slow to develop she expected it to be like this and a lost cause but it came out

412
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:13,040
 big hearty healthy she said and she knew that its swammates had already flown south because that's

413
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:18,000
 what they do for the winter to get some warmer climate and so she panicked and she thought well

414
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,000
 this guy isn't going to survive the winter up here in New York so she rang up Southwest Airlines

415
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,920
 obviously and she said can you carry this guy to Texas please where it can cross the border into

416
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:34,720
 Mexico and join its friends and they agreed so what did they they didn't give it a seat and you know

417
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:40,720
 I think they made it share her seat which is I guess you do that with babies don't you yeah

418
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:44,720
 you can put them on your lap if there's a problem with the flights when you're flying you have to

419
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:50,640
 put your own gas mask on before you put your butterflies gas mask on that's absolutely right

420
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:55,440
 would have been hell to put gas mask on it because it was wrapped in about 17 different layers so

421
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:00,800
 they packed it up in this like glass scene which is like very light transparent paper and an envelope

422
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:06,160
 made of that with a damp piece of cotton then they put it in a Tupperware then in another container

423
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:12,640
 with an ice pack to keep it cool and calm stop it panicking and then they put that container into

424
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:18,080
 a bag that was padded out with layers of newspaper and towels and it sat on her lap and flew all the

425
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:24,400
 way down to San Antonio and then popped out joined its friends and flew further south into South Mexico

426
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:28,960
 do we know it made it or did do we just have records up to the point at which she released

427
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:37,200
 this butterfly and then it got eaten by a bird immediately yeah she released it and then we

428
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:41,440
 believe it probably survived although we don't have confirmation it hasn't sent any postcards

429
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:47,760
 but did she have to find the swarm in this bit of America so she just let it off assuming that it

430
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:53,360
 would cross the border on its own and finish the it knows where to go it's a big risk no I get I get

431
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:58,080
 that but it's sort of not seeing it to its you know it's if you're trying to return it has to be a

432
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:02,480
 missing there's to be a point at which you give up on this story and you give up on the like this is

433
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:08,000
 not practical you can't fly all the way to the swarm it's like one of those easy jet flights

434
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:13,600
 sometimes to get to Barcelona you have to go to an airport that's 200 miles from Barcelona

435
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:18,400
 everyone knows that yeah I think I'm with you Dan she's lazy you've got it you've got to see it

436
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:24,080
 through he could just be dropping up a bar in Texas still I think she's actually gone above and

437
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:31,120
 beyond what was required and I think if we all did this it would you know forever it would

438
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:36,080
 exactly what Greta Thunberg would say you know we're talking about one single instance where

439
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:42,400
 she did three quarters of the trip yeah and has no idea if it paid off there's no end to this story

440
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:47,760
 I don't think she should have done it either dad no I know so I do three quarters it makes no sense

441
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:53,120
 I think that this is a wonderful heartwarming story that Pixar needs to get on immediately

442
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:59,520
 you know the butterfly that's left behind in cold new york and has to get to sounds yes yeah it

443
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:03,760
 has a champion who says I'll get you there but then only gets them three quarters of the way

444
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:08,240
 there and says all right off your part wherever you want that's a twist halfway through that's the

445
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:11,840
 low point yeah most of the way through the film in all those films there is a low point like where

446
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:16,560
 Paddington leaves his family temporarily in Paddington one or when Paddington is sent to prison

447
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:23,840
 in Paddington two or I could go on um you can get we must have said before that you can get

448
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:30,880
 butterflies that drink tears of animals but also humans but you also get blood feeding

449
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:39,600
 sweat feeding and tear feeding butterflies so for these butterflies that woman who was

450
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:45,760
 bleeding out of her eyes it must have been it's a banquet it's a banquet it's a three course meal

451
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:49,920
 it's one of those world buffet grills where you have 20 different cuisine styles all served at

452
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:56,240
 the same buffet exactly um the blood ones are quite interesting um because they will actually

453
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:02,160
 pierce your skin like to get your blood uh generally not with humans um generally with

454
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:07,040
 other animals although it can happen with humans and it what they think is they evolved from

455
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:12,320
 fruit eating moths and butterflies and they would pierce the skin of the fruits to get at

456
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:18,400
 the juicy stuff inside and they evolved into blood drinking moths and butterflies so will

457
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:23,120
 they just be drinking the blood of little ants and stuff usually they'll drink like proper they'll

458
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:30,560
 drink proper mammal blood for sure uh it's only the males who do it uh and it's same with tears

459
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:34,960
 actually only males will drink the tears of animals and that's because they're trying to get the

460
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:42,400
 sodium from the animal which can be in the blood or in the tears but the females they get the

461
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:47,680
 sodium directly from the male during mating so they don't need to get it from the from the

462
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:54,880
 other animals they get it through the yeah second hand they get second hand sodium yeah cool um I

463
00:44:54,880 --> 00:45:00,640
 read this amazing thing about monarch butterflies which astounds me and this is part of actually

464
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:06,640
 their big migration that they do uh when they're going south and it is the fact that they have to

465
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:12,240
 one point in this huge journey they have to cross lake superior and lake superior biggest lake in

466
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:18,080
 the world it's it's ginormous and that is a huge moment of the trip where they really have to go

467
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:23,120
 gung-ho on it and this really odd thing happens that biologists have been looking into for quite

468
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:30,320
 a long time which is they all fly in this sort of straight line and then out of nowhere they take

469
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:36,000
 a turn to the east and they fly east for a while and then they turn back flying south again

470
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:41,760
 and they they haven't known why and they're still not completely sure but the latest theory

471
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:46,000
 is that it's a memory of the past from old days when they were traveling down

472
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:51,360
 and there used to be there must have been a jutting out mountainous bit in lake superior

473
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:56,480
 and it's a memory that this is where we take a right I remember when we used to go on holiday

474
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:01,440
 when I was a kid and my dad would drive us many many hundreds of miles to where we were going

475
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:05,360
 on holiday and he'd always be driving around going I'm sure there was a service station around here

476
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:12,400
 exactly so they think there was something there that was blocking the path for generations and

477
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:17,440
 generations and then it went but they still in their head go oh this is where we take a right

478
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:21,360
 to get away from the blocky thing even though nothing is there there would be evidence wouldn't

479
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:25,520
 there that there had been a mountain here or something yeah I mean there would be right

480
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:30,960
 you'd think but they can't explain they just don't know why they take a right there that's

481
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:38,400
 amazing yeah wow that's so cool the species evidence of a previous mountain that must have

482
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:44,400
 been missing for a while now it must be some thousands of years where's it gone yeah that's

483
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:51,040
 very cool I wonder who's in charge of the sat nav there who's jabbing the muffin at the I don't like

484
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:57,280
 jabbing the muffin at all that's a phrase so how many butterflies do you think there are in the

485
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:05,840
 natural history museum dead ones I mean okay um I guess three thousand come on three thousand three

486
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:12,320
 twenty five fifty thousand fifty thousand you're gonna have to go quite a lot higher than that

487
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:22,960
 oh 500 000 keep going keep going 100 million oh no yeah you went too far there are eight million

488
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:31,280
 712 000 dead butterflies and moths in the natural history museum uh there in the glass-fronted cases

489
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:37,200
 that if laid out on the floor they would cover around 30 football pitches which is about 10 times

490
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:43,040
 bigger than that ship that got stuck in the Suez Canal oh my word which at the moment is a very

491
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:48,720
 on-topic reference but probably in two weeks time everyone will have forgotten it the collection

492
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:54,880
 began with Walter and Charles Rothschild uh who were amateur entomologists and they gave

493
00:47:54,880 --> 00:48:01,200
 more than two million butterflies and moths to the natural history museum it's too many you don't

494
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:07,840
 want that many it well maybe but Walter Rothschild used to say that of the two million more than

495
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:13,680
 two million butterflies he didn't have a single duplicate in his entire collection oh come on

496
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:18,800
 what it can't be true right I've got like packets of football stickers with a duplicate in the same

497
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:25,120
 packet it can't be true two million with no duplicates amazing wow that's so good rubbish

498
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:30,000
 some of them have bullet holes in them don't they this is how this is how they used to collect

499
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:34,560
 butterflies in the olden days yeah even at the turn of the 20th century even though we're still

500
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:38,640
 doing it so the specimen that the natural history museum has are for instance the largest butterfly

501
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:46,160
 in the world um was collected by shotgun in 1906 by a guy called Albert Stuart Meek who sounds not

502
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:50,160
 very meek if he's going around machine gunning butterflies down how big was it Anna because

503
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:55,360
 that you can get quite big butterflies right this one has a 20 centimeter wingspan and the biggest

504
00:48:55,360 --> 00:49:01,440
 of its kind has a 26 centimeter that's big that's very big it's a biggie um still thinks like feels

505
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:08,000
 like a shotgun would obliterate it they use special ammo I mean I'm sure you could just get a net it

506
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:14,960
 feels like um using a sledge ammo to crack a nut but they use special butterfly friendly ammo not

507
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:22,400
 friendly to the butterfly itself but friendly to the shape of its wing oh there are people who um

508
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:27,520
 aim to wipe out butterflies like the New Zealand government oh they are the first New Zealand is

509
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:33,120
 the first country to eradicate a butterfly within its own territory deliberately a single species

510
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:38,400
 or a single species called the great white butterfly which uh they eat the rare crests of

511
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:44,720
 New Zealand I didn't know that was a problem in New Zealand but get this out of 79 Kiwi crests 57

512
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:48,560
 are at risk of extinction and these bastard butterflies were eating them so the New Zealand

513
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:52,800
 government said no we are going to destroy this butterfly in New Zealand because it's it's plenty

514
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:59,840
 for us around the world so they conducted 263 000 searches they offered a bounty for of ten dollars

515
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:05,840
 for every dead great white butterfly you turned in what if you don't like bounties uh then you get a

516
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:11,360
 galaxy or a twirl um and they released wasps that hunted them and they did this for about four years

517
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:16,480
 this savage butterfly hunt and they found no more they declared that they had uh won

518
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:22,080
 oh makes them sound like really bad guys and I'm happy because the New Zealand government

519
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:25,520
 has got a lot of good press the last year and a half and it's about time someone brought them down

520
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:30,960
 as butterfly murderers yeah what's this is this pre-jocinda or is this going to be a stain on her

521
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:35,680
 career no this is 2010 to 2014 I think that the campaign was happening so it didn't sound very

522
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:40,080
 jocinda it's not a stain it's the rare crests think of the rare crests that are on the verge of

523
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:47,120
 extinction rest of all the fucking things you can kill a butterfly ball some crest I got a

524
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:54,960
 so plus some egg sandwiches without just very quickly back to the original fact 2012 was when

525
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:59,920
 this story happened when the butterfly was taken by plane it was a bit of a big year for taking

526
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:06,320
 singular animals that were migrating and were left behind on uh in the news so there was a story in

527
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:12,560
 England this also in 2012 a cuckoo was found badly injured in a garden and was transported by British

528
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:19,040
 airways along with the person who found it to churrin to join the migration of the other cuckoos

529
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:25,680
 that had already set off and they knew that it was the last of the cuckoos to fly away because it

530
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:32,160
 was tagged so while the butterfly was being flown almost to Mexico this this cuckoo was being flown

531
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:40,000
 to churrin to meet up with the migrating cuckoos and then over in Russia again in 2012 there was

532
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:47,040
 a migration of endangered Siberian white cranes that weren't quite finding their way so Vladimir

533
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:54,400
 Putin got into a motorized hand glider and dressed up in garb that sort of emulated the white crane

534
00:51:54,400 --> 00:52:01,920
 and tried to steer them unsuccessfully unfortunately but he was flying above them trying to get them

535
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:08,000
 to follow him and start migrating but then Putin said you crane and then they misrepresented

536
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:19,280
 it and ended up going into Crimea very strong animal okay that's it that is all of our facts

537
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:22,560
 thank you so much for listening if you'd like to get in contact with any of us about the
