00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.320
 - Hi everyone, welcome to another very, very special episode

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.820
 of "Noses Think As A Fish"

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.040
 where we showcase four more comedians

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.180
 who are currently at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.860
 So who do we have for you this week?

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.260
 Fact number one will come from Elf Lyons.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.420
 Elf is a brilliant comedian.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.580
 You will hear from her fact that she is very much

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.920
 into the clowning style of comedy.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.480
 Her shows have been so well received over the years.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.820
 At last year's Edinburgh Fringe she won the best show,

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.880
 that's by the ISH or the Ish Comedy Awards.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.200
 She also won the Comedians Choice Award

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.900
 and she'll be up there this year with three different shows.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.640
 So plenty for you to choose from

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.880
 if you'd like to hear more of Elf.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.920
 Fact number two will be from Ray O'Leary.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.620
 Ray is a really good friend of ours.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.440
 He is a New Zealand comedian.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.740
 He's often seen on Australian television as well.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.260
 A TV show over there called "Have You Been Paying Attention?"

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:03.340
 He's a regular on there,

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.260
 but he's also been on "Tastmaster New Zealand."

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:07.780
 He's a fantastic comedian.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.220
 He's got such an amazing deadpan humour,

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:11.580
 but really smart as well.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.900
 I know you're gonna love him.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.900
 Fact number three comes from Andrew O'Neill.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.260
 Andrew is an extremely prolific stand-up comedian,

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:20.940
 done so many shows over the years.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.580
 Also musician, also best-selling writer.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.740
 They wrote a book called "The History of Heavy Metal."

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.960
 Again, someone who we've known for many, many years

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.320
 and really wanted to get on some podcasts for a long time.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.440
 So I was delighted when they said yes.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.440
 And finally, fact number four will come from Ahir Shah.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.160
 Now Ahir, he's been nominated a few times, Reddabra,

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.240
 and he finally won it in 2023.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.960
 He's a brilliant, brilliant comedian.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.880
 We're all massive fans at QI,

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.240
 and of course he has done QI and all of the paddle shows.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.600
 So I'm sure you will be well familiar with him.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.000
 But anyway, that's four incredible comedians,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.620
 all of whom are currently slogging away

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:57.960
 at the Edinburgh Festival.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.900
 So if you are going up there, then please do check them out.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.460
 And if you're not going to Edinburgh,

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.900
 then like I said last week,

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.140
 go and find these people on social media,

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.740
 check out all the work that they're doing

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.160
 because they come highly, highly recommended from us.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.380
 Anyway, that's enough of me talking about, I guess,

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.820
 why don't you hear what they have to say

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.240
 when I say, on with the podcast.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.820
 (upbeat music)

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.820
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:39.160
 Hello, and welcome to another episode

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.020
 of No Such Thing as a Fish,

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.520
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.000
 from eight undisclosed locations around the world.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.480
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.960
 I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.260
 James Harkin, Anna Tyshinski,

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.900
 and four very, very special guests.

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.620
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.540
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.060
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.580
 Starting with fact number one, that is, Elf Lions.

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.620
 - The great clown teacher, Philip Golia,

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.140
 is so known for his negative feedback

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.660
 that his former students created a Facebook page

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.020
 purely to log all the many ways he's insulted them.

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.460
 The page is called, Philip Golia hit me with a stick.

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:27.960
 - I mean, this is a very, very famous clown teacher,

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.040
 isn't it, Philip Golia?

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.200
 And you've met him, haven't you, Elf?

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.000
 - Yeah, I trained with him, and I still remember

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.840
 I came on stage.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.280
 I think I was performing the Cyclops in Greek tragedy,

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.440
 and he went, "Who would you like to make love to?"

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.760
 And then I picked a boy called Oliver,

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.680
 and he was like, "Oliver, take her to the shower."

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.840
 And then I got covered in ice water and then brought back

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.460
 and he's like, "Oliver, hit her with a stick."

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:55.220
 And then kiss her on the cheek, and then sing,

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.060
 and then say the text.

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.660
 And I would start saying text like so speaking,

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.740
 he drew the sharp sword, hung long and heavy on his side,

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:05.980
 "And hit her with a stick.

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.220
 Ow, put more water on her.

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.740
 Not bad, goodbye."

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.140
 And then I'd have to go and sit in the class,

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.500
 still covered in water.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.300
 And that wasn't even the weirdest thing that happened.

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.600
 - So has Philip Gallier asked someone else

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.560
 to hit me with a stick, in your case?

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.640
 - Yeah, it was just so silly.

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.320
 Like, I think people's concept,

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.260
 if you haven't trained with him,

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.760
 is that you're just being emotionally abused.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.360
 But like, it's emotional abuse

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.800
 in like a really fun clown way.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.360
 - Is it, 'cause it sounds to me like being a clown teacher

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.440
 is one of the last remaining ways

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.280
 you can get away with a lot of shit and not get sucked for it.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.520
 - It sounds like an HR nightmare,

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.120
 is the phrase that keeps on cropping up with me.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.640
 - Yeah, I think safeguarding is something

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.900
 that's still being learned in the clowning community,

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.140
 I would argue.

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:55.640
 But you know what, we had good times.

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:56.480
 We had good times.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.400
 He was cheeky.

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.340
 I mean, he just called me asparagus or wobbly giraffe.

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.420
 Look at this wobbly giraffe with our wobbly body.

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:06.440
 - Again, I'm afraid to say, Elf,

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.880
 that is a tribunal waiting to happen.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.000
 Wobbly giraffe woman wins three million pounds

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.080
 from elderly French clown.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.500
 - I think it's why I've coped so well

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.680
 in the comedy industry, to be honest.

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.980
 Because if I ever got heckled at the comedy store,

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:23.700
 I'm like, you're not a sure old man in France telling me,

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.000
 would we wish she was on a plane to Malaysian Airlines?

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.200
 - Which was one that I got frequently.

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.120
 - Right, have you contributed to the Facebook page,

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.960
 the insults?

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.240
 - I think I must have done about 10 years ago.

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.640
 - Yeah, 'cause this was set up in 2007.

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:38.640
 The about section says,

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.440
 "We are all variously insulted by Philippe Goliere

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.520
 in various cities at various times.

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.740
 Did he call you a toilet, a cretin?

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:47.740
 When joining this group, please share an insult

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.900
 you received from him, adios."

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.180
 And yeah, people would put things like,

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.660
 "You sound like overcooked spaghetti in a pressure cooker."

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:57.220
 They will sound like they're not hugely harmful,

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:59.060
 but I have spoken to a few other people

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:00.260
 who studied under him.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:01.500
 My friend, Sam, did.

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:05.500
 And she said she was so badly insulted by him.

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.580
 He talked about how dead her eyes were,

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.180
 that it was more dead than a family pet

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:15.040
 that had not only died, but been buried into the back garden

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.960
 that took ages to shovel and left for years and years.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.760
 And then a fountain's been built on it.

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.200
 And then you go back and you dig it all up

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.520
 and you take the pet back out and you look at his eyes.

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.600
 Her eyes are more dead than that, animals.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.800
 Like he did it for like five minutes on stage,

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.080
 but she now runs clowns without borders UK.

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.120
 So she went into it.

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.640
 - And I bet her eyes are great.

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:34.800
 Can I ask what the idea is?

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.480
 As someone who hasn't done clowning,

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:39.540
 what's the idea behind being like incessantly

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:40.940
 and absurdly insulted?

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:42.740
 Does it make you more funny and clowny?

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:43.860
 - I think, do you know what it is?

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:46.320
 It's about realizing that you can never

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:47.840
 disguise anything about yourself.

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:50.100
 You have to come on stage so full of pleasure

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:52.460
 in your body and who you are.

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:54.980
 Because if you try and conceal or hide

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:57.340
 what you look like, the audience are gonna notice it.

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:59.700
 And also getting rid of the pride and the ego.

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:01.340
 But it's so funny.

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:02.180
 That's the thing.

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:03.020
 Everybody's laughing.

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:05.780
 And I remember once there was someone dressed as a gnome

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:08.080
 and she was so bad, she was so not funny.

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:09.720
 And he was like, "You hate me, don't you?"

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.920
 And she was like, "Yeah, I do."

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.600
 And he's like, "How much do you hate me?"

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.560
 And she was as a little gnome.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.960
 She was like, "I hate you fucking hate you, Philippe."

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.520
 He's like, "Yeah, you tell me how much you hate me.

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.360
 How much you hate my face."

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:24.040
 - And she started getting really angry at him.

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:25.400
 And it was the funniest thing.

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:28.720
 Watching this like 50 year old woman dressed as a gnome

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.680
 in Swedish shouting at this French man.

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:33.520
 He's like, "Yes, you tell me how much you hate my guts."

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.900
 So it's just, I think it's one of those things.

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:38.180
 It's all context related.

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:40.140
 And I do genuinely, you could say there's a lot

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:43.140
 of HR issues, but it is about the environment.

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:45.420
 And Philippe was pretty, if there were any issues

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:47.980
 in the village, there was a village flasher

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:49.460
 who would just flash his penis

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:51.060
 whilst we were all running.

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:53.260
 And Philippe, likewise, this has got to stop you.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.260
 Cannot all keep getting flashed to you.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:56.660
 And that'd be funny on stage.

00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:59.940
 I will call the mayor and rang the mayor

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:02.880
 to sort out the flasher in the park.

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:04.700
 - Was he sorted out?

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:06.460
 - I think he was actually.

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:08.300
 - Is that what it takes to sort out a flasher?

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:09.940
 You need to tell the mayor

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:11.340
 that it's ruining clown school.

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:15.540
 - Yeah, I mean, clown cop is an impressive premise

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:16.660
 for a TV show.

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:21.580
 - Oh God, from the makers of Tiberius Cop comes clown cop.

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:24.260
 - So they sort of torturing people among clowns

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.420
 does seem to be part of their modus operandi.

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:27.580
 There's also a thing in America

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:30.980
 where you can hire clowns to terrify your children.

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:31.820
 And I actually don't,

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:35.320
 this certainly was happening about eight or nine years ago.

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:36.280
 I can't say it happening now,

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:38.560
 but there's wrinkles the clown in Florida.

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:39.960
 Do you guys know him?

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:41.680
 - Don't like the sound of wrinkles.

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:44.960
 - He hires himself out to parents

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:47.800
 who want to petrify their children who are misbehaving.

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:48.920
 And he does things like,

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:51.600
 like one mother hired him to stand a bus stop

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:53.600
 and stare at her 12 year old

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:54.960
 until he freaked out so much

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:57.640
 and started crying in front of his friends and ran home.

00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:59.120
 - I'm sorry, any child

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:00.540
 whose parents have hired wrinkles,

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:02.340
 the clown needs to be taken into care

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:03.340
 a face of immediately.

00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:04.660
 - It's quite weird, isn't it?

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:05.500
 Yeah.

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:07.580
 There's another one called Dominic the Devil

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:10.100
 who stalks, I mean, it does sound bad,

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:11.780
 who stalked victims for weeks,

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:13.340
 sending them chilling text messages

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:15.260
 and making prank phone calls

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:16.580
 and sort of posting them notes,

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:17.860
 warning them they're being watched.

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:19.060
 And then eventually after weeks,

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:20.820
 he'll smash a cake in their face.

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:22.100
 - That's noncy.

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:23.660
 Sorry, that's noncy.

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:25.980
 - Well, whatever makes you could do their homework,

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:27.340
 I think is the thinking.

00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:28.780
 - These guys have strayed quite far

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:32.720
 from the joy ethos that the clowning apparently has.

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:35.760
 - I always wonder what the link with scary clowns is,

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:37.160
 there's the bouffon clown.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.800
 So if you imagine the clown that we think of,

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:41.920
 the playful circus clown has puppy eyes,

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:43.720
 very innocent, the inner child,

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:44.680
 then you've got the bouffon,

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:47.200
 which has animal eyes, fox eyes.

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:49.480
 And there's this myth that the bouffon

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:52.000
 were the untouchables in the medieval period

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
 and they lived outside of the town

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.720
 and they lived in the swamps.

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:59.300
 And it was everyone who was not respected in that time.

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:00.720
 And then there was one day of the year,

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.300
 the day of the bouffon where they could go

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:05.860
 and blaspheme against God and say F you to the king

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:07.740
 and they could exaggerate their bodies

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:09.620
 to look like those were in charge

00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:13.480
 and basically stick a finger up to the power.

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:15.340
 And Sasha Baron Cohen's borat

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:17.080
 sort of originates from bouffon.

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:20.500
 But it's like the dark clown, it's really smart.

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:24.460
 It's not foolish, there's like an acidic twist to it.

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:28.040
 - And that's not where clown terror comes from, I think maybe.

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:31.440
 'Cause do you remember how insane it was in 2016

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:35.840
 when that's a new story for about a month of clown terror?

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:38.040
 Which is weird 'cause at the end of that year,

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:39.720
 Donald Trump was elected, wasn't he?

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:42.720
 So you never know, maybe it was a weird precedent.

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:45.640
 - Dan, earlier you mentioned clowns without borders

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:47.560
 and they're an amazing group.

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:50.080
 They go to the worst places in the world,

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:51.600
 like famine zones and war zones

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:53.660
 and they entertain children.

00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:55.800
 And there was a peace run in the Washington Post

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:59.040
 this July, headlined, Donald Trump is not a clown.

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:00.520
 I should know.

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:01.720
 And it was by Tim Cunningham

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:04.000
 who was the president of Clowns Without Borders.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.640
 And he was saying, our joyful work

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:08.080
 has been diminished into an insult.

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:10.880
 Every election season, the word clown resurfaces

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:13.080
 to compare Washington politics to a circus.

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:15.080
 And he was incredibly angry about this.

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:16.480
 Clown is used by almost everyone

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:18.440
 to belittle those seen as foolish or incompetent.

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:19.760
 The more we mistreat the word,

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:22.560
 the more we lose understanding of a sacred art form.

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:26.660
 And like, yes, but who's this clown?

00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:27.980
 It's just a standard.

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:30.220
 - It's just such a good line, isn't it?

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:31.300
 And if anyone, by the way,

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:33.740
 just a quick shout out for Clowns Without Borders.

00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:36.700
 If anyone has any spare money, please donate it to them

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:38.060
 because they do incredible things.

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:39.460
 They go into war-torn areas

00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:41.140
 and they look after refugee children

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:42.460
 who just need a smile on their face.

00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:43.580
 They're really awesome.

00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:46.340
 You mentioned Sasha Baron Cohen before, Elf.

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:48.900
 And he was a Gollier student, wasn't he?

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:50.020
 - He was indeed.

00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:52.560
 So many, so many people in the world of entertainment

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:55.760
 like Emma Thompson, Helena Bonham Carter, Rachel Weiss,

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:57.680
 Jeffrey Rush, all studied underneath him.

00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:00.960
 So he's had like a huge impact in our general culture.

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:02.680
 But in movies as well,

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.360
 Anna, we were just talking about

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:07.640
 how parents hire freaky clowns to stalk their kids.

00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:10.920
 This is something that also gets used in movies,

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:14.280
 most famously in Close Encounters of the Third Kind.

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:17.240
 Spielberg had a little boy who was his first acting role

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:19.480
 and he needed to get this emotion out of him

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:22.620
 when he was scared by seeing aliens outside a window.

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:25.060
 And behind the window, as he approached it,

00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:26.180
 a sort of blind went down

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:28.540
 and there was a terrifying clown standing there.

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:29.860
 Absolutely freaked him out.

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:32.620
 Yeah, and then another blind went down

00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:34.380
 and there was someone dressed as a gorilla.

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:36.660
 So this kid just absolutely flipped out

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:38.220
 and it was just- - What is going on?

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:39.740
 - It was two of the crew who-

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:41.700
 - And what's he trying to achieve with this kid?

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:43.220
 - He wanted a motion of being scared.

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:44.060
 - He needed a shot of someone

00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:46.060
 wetting themselves in terror, apparently.

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:50.820
 - Gaila Liberté, are you familiar with the name Gaila Liberté?

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:53.240
 - I possibly am, but I probably never pronounced it

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:56.060
 as beautifully as you did, 'cause my dyslexia means

00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:59.360
 I pronounce everything like it's going through chat GBT.

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:00.200
 But tell me.

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:02.100
 - Well, he's one of very few clowns

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:03.520
 to have become a billionaire.

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:04.360
 - Wow.

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:08.520
 - So he is one of the co-founders of Cirque du Soleil.

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:09.360
 - Okay.

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:12.400
 - He's been a stilt walker and a fire eater before,

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:14.480
 before founding this incredibly successful

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:16.560
 global corporation of brilliant shows.

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:21.560
 And in 2009, he became the first ever clown in space.

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:26.100
 He went to the International Space Station.

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:27.140
 - Trest as a clown.

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:29.700
 - We don't do anything to get taken seriously.

00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:32.660
 I'm sorry, like, everyone, how Adam and everyone is

00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:34.900
 in the clowning profession to be taken seriously.

00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:37.500
 We do such stupid things.

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:38.700
 - He did a little like clowning.

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:41.120
 There's a picture of him in his space suit with a nose on.

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:43.380
 And, you know, made the astronauts laugh a bit.

00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:44.940
 He was up there partly to make a speech

00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:47.080
 about the importance of clean water accessibility.

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:47.920
 That was the thing.

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:51.400
 Anyway, the real punchline is that he paid $41 million

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:53.480
 to go and he was a billionaire by this point.

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:55.120
 So he had a huge amount of money to spend.

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:57.840
 But the funniest joke of all he made was that he claimed

00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:59.720
 the trip was a work expense and that therefore

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:02.440
 he should not have to pay any tax on the $41 million

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:03.700
 he'd spent going to space.

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:06.800
 This was litigated for 10 years in the Canadian courts.

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:09.320
 And eventually, and I think about 2020,

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:11.280
 the Canadian Federal Court of Appeals ruled

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:13.400
 that it was a personal trip he was making

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:15.760
 and he would have to pay tax on that.

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:17.200
 But I think that's a very funny joke.

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:18.700
 - I can't believe you're allowed to just go,

00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:21.000
 he went to the ISS to do that.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:21.840
 I thought only astronauts.

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:22.680
 - He cleared it with them first.

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:25.260
 Like, he didn't turn up outside the ISS

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.400
 just knocking on the hatch.

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:30.060
 - How do you stow away in a rocket?

00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:31.660
 - There's massive shoes are poking out

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:34.740
 from beneath the curtains on the...

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:37.100
 - Oh, we had a very cool clown connection

00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:39.460
 with no such thing as a fish, by the way,

00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:42.060
 that happened on our Australia New Zealand tour.

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:45.120
 So we did a fact about clowns ages ago

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:48.920
 that in New Zealand, a man was made redundant.

00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:51.360
 And there's this idea that if you're made redundant,

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:53.840
 you can bring someone along with you to the meeting

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:55.920
 so that you have a bit of support.

00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:57.400
 And I can see you clapping, Alf.

00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:59.720
 I have a feeling you might know this person as well.

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:00.560
 - I do know this.

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:02.080
 - A comedian called Joshua Jack,

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:04.240
 whose real name is Josh Thompson.

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:06.880
 Josh Thompson hired a clown to come with him

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:08.360
 for this resundancy meeting.

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:10.320
 And while the person was saying,

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:11.880
 we think, you know, unfortunately,

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:12.720
 we're gonna have to let you go.

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:13.560
 The clowns are going,

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:16.340
 "Oh boo-hoo," and, you know, doing all the clowny stuff.

00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:17.580
 Anyway, we're in Australia

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:20.740
 and we have a drink post Melbourne show with Ray O'Leary,

00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:23.380
 who is part of these Edinburgh showcase shows

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:24.500
 that we're doing with fish.

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:27.620
 And he says, "This is my friend, his name's Josh Thompson.

00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:29.860
 He was the guy who hired the clown.

00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:32.300
 We got pissed with the man who was a fact

00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:34.940
 on no such thing as a fish, our greatest strings."

00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:36.060
 - Yeah.

00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:38.460
 Hey, by the way, I found a clown school

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:41.680
 where no one who has left that school

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:44.400
 as far as I can tell has gone on to become a clown.

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:48.520
 So it turns out there's a town in the UK called Clown.

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:50.800
 C-L-O-W-N-E.

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:54.360
 And Clown Junior High is a school, right?

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:55.640
 And I searched so hard.

00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:57.720
 I couldn't find any clowns who live in Clown.

00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:00.240
 They have a population of 7,000,

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:03.520
 except I found one guy whose name is Chris Carter,

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:06.480
 who started filming a bunch of horror movies

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:08.000
 where he dresses as a clown.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.700
 And walks the streets.

00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:13.380
 But he got caught up as a clown in Clown

00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:15.460
 by the 2016 Clown Fear.

00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:17.260
 And he had to tell police

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.540
 anytime he was going out in his clown gear,

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:21.300
 otherwise he was gonna be arrested.

00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:24.020
 - No, was that the policy and the police?

00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:26.060
 Every time you put a red nose on?

00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:27.580
 - Well, it was just that month, as you say,

00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:29.020
 that crazy month.

00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:29.860
 - Yeah.

00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:32.580
 - It made it all the way to the UK town of Clown.

00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:33.500
 - It was so ridiculous.

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:35.300
 'Cause I think it was confected by journalists

00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:38.200
 mostly surely, 'cause people aren't that insane.

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:40.280
 But it did affect things then.

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:41.840
 There was a Clown Lives Matter march

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:43.640
 that had to be canceled.

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:46.840
 So, no wonder no one takes it.

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:47.880
 Seriously.

00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:49.480
 - I can't get over the headline.

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:52.640
 Clown's complaining they're not being taken seriously.

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:54.360
 It's just wonderful.

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:55.480
 - Why are you necking?

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:57.920
 I, when I was a teacher and we did World Book Day

00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:59.680
 and all the teachers had to dress up

00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:03.000
 and I full on dressed up as Pennywise the Clown.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.400
 It was the one day.

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:06.820
 I had no issues with discipline.

00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:10.220
 Those kids behaved themselves.

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:12.480
 I got latex, I got some fake blood.

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:15.540
 I reenacted the shining as an immersive film experience

00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:16.540
 in the classroom.

00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:18.540
 We went to town that day.

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:20.100
 And I'm no longer a teacher

00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:22.500
 'cause the children thought that 'cause I was too scared.

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:25.900
 - We do need to wrap up.

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:28.580
 So, Elf, you're gonna be up at the fringe doing

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:31.740
 quite a sort of exciting three shows, right?

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:32.580
 - Yeah.

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:35.420
 I'm redoing all, I'm doing my bird trilogy.

00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:38.180
 So I'm doing Swan, which is a one woman production

00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:41.540
 of Swan Lake in an hour in French-ish.

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:44.340
 And then Chiff Chaff, which is a one woman musical

00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:45.540
 about the economy.

00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:48.500
 And then Raven, which is my one woman reenactment

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:50.420
 of all Stephen King's books.

00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:53.820
 And they're all Clown, Mime, Buffon shows

00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:56.940
 that make my agent's job of getting me on television

00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:58.740
 so difficult.

00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:01.400
 She's like, please just do a straight standup show.

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:03.140
 And then I was like, I'm gonna make a show

00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:04.460
 where I pretend to be a horse.

00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:06.180
 And she's just started crying, going,

00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:08.660
 I want to earn enough money to buy a house.

00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:11.340
 Please just do something relatable

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:13.700
 so I can pitch you to Taskmaster.

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:14.540
 - Where are you gonna be, Elf?

00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:15.380
 Where you playing?

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:19.220
 - I'm playing in the King Dome at the Pleasants

00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:21.300
 for the final two weeks of the fringe.

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:24.660
 So Swan one day, Chiff after next, Raven the day after.

00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:26.300
 So you can go and see all three in a row

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:29.220
 and just see just how mad I am.

00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:31.800
 (upbeat music)

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:39.040
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two.

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:41.320
 And that is Ray O'Leary.

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:43.960
 - And my fact is, in the 1820s,

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:48.000
 philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer hated his contemporary Hagel

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.160
 so much he intentionally scheduled his lectures

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:54.120
 at the same time as Hagel's and had zero people attend.

00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:58.000
 - What a backfire.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.400
 It's terrible backfire.

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:03.380
 Yeah, so apparently this was at the University of Berlin

00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:06.100
 and Schopenhauer, he taught a few semesters there.

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:09.240
 And apparently he never had more than five students

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:11.340
 sign up to attend.

00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:14.460
 Meanwhile, I think Hagel was getting in the hundreds

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:16.940
 because at the time he was the chair of philosophy

00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:19.340
 at the University of Berlin.

00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:22.400
 So he was sort of like the Taylor Swift

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:25.100
 of German philosophical idealism.

00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:26.580
 So it was naturally.

00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:30.260
 I actually call Taylor Swift the Hagel of pop music.

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:32.480
 (laughing)

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:34.960
 So do you know a lot about philosophy, Ray,

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:38.520
 because these are pretty new names to me

00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:40.120
 and probably a lot of people listening.

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:43.440
 - Yes, I do know a bit about philosophy.

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:45.920
 Interestingly, this is not the area of philosophy

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:48.640
 I know the most about, but I was always drawn

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:50.720
 to Arthur Schopenhauer 'cause he was sort of

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:52.320
 just such a miserable man.

00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:55.320
 He was just sort of quite a cantankerous,

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:56.280
 horrible old man.

00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:58.080
 That was so interesting to me.

00:19:58.080 --> 00:19:59.480
 The more you read about him, the more you're like,

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:02.120
 "Oh, there's almost nothing redeemable about him

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:02.960
 as a person."

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:04.580
 - Sorry, can I just stop you there, Ray?

00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:06.120
 Because before we came on mic,

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:08.920
 I was saying how much Andy reminds me of him.

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:12.540
 - Okay, okay, I like to think of myself

00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:15.600
 as a cantankerous, miserable young man, all right?

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:16.900
 - Also, I think he's quite a nice man.

00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:19.700
 Actually, he's quite handsome now that I think about it.

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:21.280
 - Yeah, yeah, thank you very much, Ray.

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:24.340
 But this story, it's from a time when Hagel

00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:27.460
 was the most famous philosopher in the German-speaking world.

00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:30.340
 And Schopenhauer was just some punk kid.

00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:32.100
 You know, he was in his 20s, I think,

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:34.940
 or maybe, no, maybe early 30s, but he was young.

00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:37.820
 And it was him who wanted the rivalry.

00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:40.900
 Like, Hagel made no reference ever in his life

00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:41.740
 to Schopenhauer.

00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:43.260
 Schopenhauer is constantly writing about

00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:44.660
 how much he hates Hagel.

00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:46.580
 And it was all about his main work,

00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:48.100
 the world as Will and representation.

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:49.700
 It was about his magnum opus.

00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:52.500
 - Yeah, it's so-- - And no one, no one cares.

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:55.500
 When you read about him on page, to me,

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:58.460
 it's like reading a biography of Larry David.

00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:00.820
 Like, he tries all these little schemes.

00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:03.220
 And I wonder if maybe in real life, it was funnier.

00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:06.300
 'Cause if you read Curb Your Enthusiasm on page,

00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:07.140
 that's not funny.

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:10.220
 That's a contankerous, horrible, repulsive man, right?

00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:12.260
 But in real life, he's amazing.

00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:15.540
 He largely drew his philosophy from Eastern religion, right?

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:17.260
 Like, so Buddhism and so on.

00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:19.180
 And so in his apartment in Frankfurt,

00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:22.980
 he had a large black lacquered bronze statue

00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:24.820
 of the Buddha sitting there.

00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:27.140
 And he told a friend that he positioned it

00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:28.260
 so that every morning,

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:30.180
 when the morning sun came through the window,

00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:34.180
 it would bounce off it and put an annoying beam of light

00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:36.100
 into the apartment across from him,

00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:38.700
 which belonged to a pastor who he didn't like,

00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:41.300
 just so it would piss him off every day.

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:42.900
 That's Larry David.

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:44.940
 - Really, you wouldn't wanna live next star

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:46.660
 to Schopenhauer, would you?

00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:48.900
 One of the things he hated was noise.

00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:51.260
 You can imagine, if you had a little party,

00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:53.140
 even if you finished it by 9 p.m.,

00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:55.100
 he'd be round banging on the door.

00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:56.060
 - Yeah, do you know what?

00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:57.060
 People need their sleep.

00:21:57.060 --> 00:21:58.900
 Some people go to bed nice and early.

00:21:58.900 --> 00:21:59.740
 - You know what, Andy?

00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:02.300
 I know that you don't like loud noise very much

00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:03.820
 and loud music and stuff.

00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:04.820
 Schopenhauer once said,

00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:07.940
 "The amount of noise which anyone can bear undisturbed

00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:11.460
 "stands in inverse proportion to his mental capacity."

00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:15.260
 - That makes me the cleverest man alive, I think.

00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:17.180
 If I've understood it.

00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:19.060
 - I've never been round to Andy's place,

00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:22.500
 but I'm imagining that sort of a series of statues

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:25.620
 carefully positioned so the sun ricochets around

00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:27.620
 until it hits all the enemy's eye.

00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:29.260
 (laughing)

00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:31.460
 - But he's clearly unbelievably,

00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:33.420
 reading about actually both of these guys,

00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:34.260
 Hegel and Schopenhauer,

00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:36.860
 you just think these people are so unbelievably clever.

00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:41.380
 And the beef was kind of because Hegel's view of the world

00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:43.500
 was that humanity had arrived

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:45.220
 at the age of self-consciousness.

00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:47.300
 He had this big lecture about the world history,

00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:50.740
 which he claimed that Europe is the absolute end of history.

00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:53.460
 The spirit of the world was the zeitgeist in it.

00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:55.620
 It was reaching its perfect final form.

00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:56.940
 Everything was getting better.

00:22:56.940 --> 00:22:58.460
 And Schopenhauer rejected that.

00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:00.220
 Hegel was basically, "Things can only get better."

00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:02.260
 And Schopenhauer said, "We're not becoming anything.

00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:04.220
 "We remain the same.

00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:06.260
 "We go in these big historical cycles."

00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:08.660
 - It was, I mean, really basically,

00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:10.980
 it's like optimism versus pessimism, wasn't it?

00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:14.980
 Hegel was very much sunlight and rainbows and unicorns

00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:18.100
 and Schopenhauer was, "I fucking hate unicorns."

00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:19.420
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:20.580
 Which team are you on, Ray?

00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:23.220
 If you had the option of those two lectures,

00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:25.180
 you know, your time traveled back to there.

00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:29.180
 - I think my inkling is to go towards Schopenhauer,

00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:31.460
 but I really would not want him

00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:33.380
 to have somebody at his lecture.

00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:34.700
 I think then, I don't,

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:37.740
 I basically want to preserve his loser status.

00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:40.180
 I think it would corrupt his whole legacy

00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:42.580
 if people were actually paying attention to him at the time.

00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:46.340
 - I think Hegel's lectures were not the most fun.

00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:49.340
 I think he was very difficult to understand.

00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:52.860
 His students said that every third sentence

00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:55.380
 he said began with "therefore."

00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:58.380
 So you can imagine this sort of German lecturer going,

00:23:58.380 --> 00:24:01.300
 "Therefore, therefore, therefore."

00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:02.140
 - Yes, I was gonna say,

00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:04.700
 I think one of the reasons Schopenhauer hated Hegel

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:06.580
 was for his dense way of writing

00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:09.140
 and he was obscure and hard to understand.

00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:11.620
 I don't want to take sides in the dispute,

00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:14.740
 but I did find there's a famous explainer

00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:17.540
 of one of Hegel's most prominent works,

00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:21.700
 and it's over three times longer than Hegel's actual work.

00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:22.540
 So...

00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:26.140
 - Hey, Ray Watts, you said at the start

00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:29.300
 that this isn't what you know most about in philosophy.

00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:30.420
 What's your era?

00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:31.540
 Who's your philosopher?

00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:34.140
 - Well, my favorite was actually Manuel Kantz,

00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:37.300
 who was the one that inspired both Hegel and Schopenhauer,

00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:38.940
 but they took him in different directions.

00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:43.380
 And then what my thesis ended up being about was free will.

00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:45.980
 That was the main thing I ended up writing about.

00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:47.620
 - The movie about the whale?

00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:48.460
 - Mm.

00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:50.540
 - What a pivot.

00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:53.860
 - Sadly, I wrote the sequel.

00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:58.340
 There was my was free will to the much less popular

00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:01.100
 straight to DVD philosophical thesis.

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:03.540
 - The whale can escape,

00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:05.300
 but will he ever truly be free?

00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:07.300
 - Do I have free will always?

00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:09.220
 - Do I force to make that terrible joke?

00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:14.420
 - I think knowing you as entirely within your genes

00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:16.020
 and environment that you were compelled,

00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:18.180
 there was no choice for you.

00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:24.540
 - We've not mentioned one big part of Schopenhauer's studies,

00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:28.260
 which is the time he became a paranormal investigator.

00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:29.100
 - Oh, here we go.

00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:32.220
 - It's a surprisingly big bit of his life,

00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:33.540
 and he wrote about it quite a lot,

00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:36.780
 which is that he had a very weird moment

00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:38.100
 where he woke up one morning

00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:41.660
 and he saw his mom and dad standing in front of him

00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:43.220
 as an apparition.

00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:44.860
 So his dad was dead,

00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:46.300
 bit weirder 'cause his mom was still alive,

00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:48.900
 so not sure what she was doing there, but.

00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:50.780
 - His mom was just over for a visit.

00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:52.220
 I thought the most terrible thing

00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:54.140
 I've ever heard before in my life.

00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:55.780
 - Yeah, and so he sort of thought,

00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:56.740
 I wonder what that is.

00:25:56.740 --> 00:25:59.180
 And he was working as a large part of his work

00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:01.060
 that metaphysics would explain

00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:03.060
 why people were seeing weird things.

00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:05.340
 He didn't properly believe in ghosts himself,

00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:07.420
 but he did think all of these experiences,

00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:10.180
 telepathy, all that stuff, premonitions,

00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:12.140
 something might be tied in.

00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:15.180
 So it made it part of his philosophical investigations.

00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:16.860
 - How cool. - It's got to be a nightmare

00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:18.780
 if you hate other human beings,

00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:21.260
 and then you start getting visited by ghosts as well.

00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:22.100
 You're either--

00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:23.220
 (all laughing)

00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:25.060
 - This is exactly what I didn't want.

00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:28.820
 He was really interested in sacred Hindu texts as well.

00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:32.180
 That was a big part of his life and his philosophy.

00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:34.220
 So all of his poodles,

00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:36.180
 he was a big poodle fancier.

00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:38.140
 All of his poodles were called atman,

00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:41.380
 which is the Sanskrit word, meaning your true self.

00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:43.260
 - Why would you call all your dogs the same name?

00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:44.700
 That doesn't make any sense.

00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:47.260
 - It means you only have one thing to shout in the park,

00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:49.340
 and then all the dogs will come back, you know.

00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:50.980
 - Okay, I see that. - He's ingenious.

00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:52.820
 See, he was the cleverest man in life.

00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:56.180
 And his bedtime reading every night was a few pages of,

00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:57.380
 this is when I thought,

00:26:57.380 --> 00:26:59.540
 okay, this guy's a cut above intellectually.

00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:03.220
 It was the Latin translation of the Upanishads,

00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:04.780
 the sacred Hindu text, the Upanishads.

00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:06.820
 It was the Latin translation of that.

00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:07.900
 Every night before going to bed,

00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:09.260
 he would just read a few pages

00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:10.980
 to help himself drift off to sleep.

00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:13.180
 And he said, "It has been the consolation of my life

00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:15.260
 and will be that of my death."

00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:20.180
 You know, he was just an extremely polymathic guy effectively.

00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:22.780
 - Well, that was someone said in writing

00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:25.700
 about his understanding of the Upanishads

00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:29.140
 and general Hindu philosophy is that he was reading

00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:31.900
 these sort of put together Latin translations

00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:34.580
 that lost a lot about it, a mistranslation almost,

00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:35.660
 not quite a mistranslation,

00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:37.980
 but one step away from the meanings

00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:40.580
 that were properly captured in the original writings.

00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:41.740
 - That's really interesting.

00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:44.060
 - It just suited what he was trying to build.

00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:47.140
 - That's quite similar to Zen Buddhism in the West,

00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:50.940
 which was, it came over when a guy went over to Japan

00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:52.540
 and he spent a lot of time

00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:54.660
 with this really famous Zen Buddhist.

00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:56.180
 And he didn't speak Japanese

00:27:56.180 --> 00:27:57.940
 and the Buddhist didn't speak any English.

00:27:57.940 --> 00:28:00.020
 And so they went through a translator.

00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:02.500
 And the translator just basically told him

00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:04.060
 what he wanted to hear.

00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:07.260
 'Cause the Zen Buddhist guy was quite old by that stage.

00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:08.340
 He was repeating himself.

00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:10.420
 He was talking quite a lot of nonsense.

00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:13.420
 And then this guy would say, "Oh yeah, what he's saying

00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:16.500
 is that you need to become one with the world

00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:17.420
 and whatever."

00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:19.900
 But actually never said any of that stuff.

00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:21.220
 - Give all your dogs one name.

00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:22.480
 Give them all one name.

00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:25.580
 (all laughing)

00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:28.100
 - Schopenhauer, he wrote about the feeling

00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:30.060
 that people had after sex.

00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:30.900
 - Oh.

00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:33.420
 - He wrote that directly after copulation,

00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:35.860
 the devil's laughter is heard.

00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:39.220
 - Oh, who's been laughing this whole time?

00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:40.220
 I was just wondering.

00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:42.820
 (all laughing)

00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:45.620
 - It's always better that it's the devil laughing,

00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:46.500
 really, isn't it?

00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:48.300
 (all laughing)

00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:50.740
 - So this all comes back to Galen,

00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:54.380
 the famous guy who wrote about medicine and stuff.

00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:57.780
 He wrote that every animal is sad after colitis,

00:28:57.780 --> 00:29:00.140
 except the human female and the rooster.

00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:02.180
 - You know, we don't pitch the Schopenhauer fact,

00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:04.020
 this is not where I originally would be.

00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:07.220
 (all laughing)

00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:12.140
 - We should say A-Shops was a massive sexist.

00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:14.540
 I mean, I was reading his work and I was thinking,

00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:16.340
 "Yeah, I'm jamming with this guy."

00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:19.300
 And then I read his views on women.

00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:21.420
 "They are big children all their life long

00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:23.900
 and undersized, narrow-shouldered, broad-hipped

00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:25.060
 and short-legged race.

00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:26.700
 They have no proper knowledge of anything

00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:28.260
 and they have no genius."

00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:30.140
 And I thought, "I'm gonna back off, okay."

00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:30.980
 - Yeah.

00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:33.420
 - So did you say that he said women are bigger children?

00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:35.660
 Because, I mean, so are men.

00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:37.540
 That's what being an adult is, isn't it?

00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:38.460
 (all laughing)

00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:41.220
 He's been a bigger child.

00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:45.860
 He was very dedicated to slagging off the other philosophers.

00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:50.220
 He once wrote an essay that was awarded first prize

00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:53.340
 in a competition by the Royal Norwegian Society

00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:55.420
 of Sciences and Letters.

00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:58.540
 And so then next year, he submitted another essay

00:29:58.540 --> 00:30:01.380
 and this essay did not win the awards,

00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:04.580
 even though it was the sole submission.

00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:08.100
 (all laughing)

00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:10.860
 And the reason it was rejected is a part

00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:14.740
 because he kept disrespecting other philosophers.

00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:17.020
 And I think to be fair, if you are writing an essay

00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:18.220
 on morality, you probably should have

00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:20.220
 been slagging off the other philosophers.

00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:22.820
 - Yeah, that's so funny.

00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:25.540
 That's like, there was a study that was done

00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:28.940
 amongst UK scientists and one of the findings at the end

00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:33.300
 was that most scientists don't like Richard Dawkins.

00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:36.180
 But what they were being asked about had nothing to do

00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:37.020
 with Richard Dawkins.

00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:39.500
 That just came up as everyone slagging him off

00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:40.700
 as part of their response.

00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:43.380
 And they were like, "Well, here's an unintended bit

00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:44.820
 of data that we've discovered."

00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:45.740
 (all laughing)

00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:46.580
 Yeah, yeah, he did.

00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:47.820
 He slag even in his books, right?

00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:50.260
 Even in his main, that main one.

00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:51.180
 What was it called, by the way?

00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:52.020
 - The Will.

00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:53.980
 - The World as Will and Representation.

00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:55.260
 - Yeah, even in the main one,

00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:57.540
 the Will is World and Representation.

00:30:57.540 --> 00:30:58.740
 Will is, say it again.

00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:01.100
 - The World as Will and Representation.

00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:02.980
 It's not, actually, it did not take off.

00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:04.300
 Part of the reason it didn't take off

00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:06.700
 was he didn't call it big things.

00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:10.540
 - I just love the idea of Dad going to a year of lectures

00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:13.540
 and still can't get the title of his work.

00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:14.380
 - Any questions?

00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:15.820
 Yes, Dan, again.

00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:20.660
 No, it's the World as Will and Representation.

00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:23.340
 - Okay, so where there's a world,

00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:25.140
 there's a will of representation.

00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:26.420
 - Where there's a world, there's a way.

00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:27.820
 That would have been better.

00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:29.060
 That would have been better.

00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:30.460
 - I imagine if I was the time traveler

00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:33.340
 that went back and sat, it was like sitting on the ground.

00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:34.180
 - So what?

00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:36.180
 - What does he think of me in the year 2025?

00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:37.340
 - We love your work.

00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:39.400
 Where will he, for you, will he?

00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:41.980
 (all laughing)

00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:45.980
 - We need to wrap up in a sec,

00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:47.220
 but Ray, you're going to be in Edinburgh.

00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:48.060
 This is very exciting.

00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:49.540
 You're coming across the ocean,

00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:50.620
 halfway across the world.

00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:51.700
 Where are you going to be playing?

00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:52.540
 What's the show?

00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:55.260
 - Yes, I'm going to be at the Pleasants Courtyard

00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:59.940
 at 6.05 p.m. every day, except for one Monday.

00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:00.780
 I forget which one.

00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:02.420
 So hopefully that's not the only day

00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:05.660
 I'm currently in Edinburgh for the entire Fringe Festival.

00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:09.140
 And the show's called Laughter I Hardly Knower.

00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:10.620
 So yeah, please come along.

00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:13.700
 (all laughing)

00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:15.060
 - Really a title.

00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:17.640
 (upbeat music)

00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:20.840
 - Okay, it's time for fact number three,

00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:23.720
 and that is Andrew O'Neill.

00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:27.440
 - My fact is that the first band to call themselves punk

00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:28.800
 didn't use guitars.

00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:29.640
 - What?

00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:34.280
 - Which is counter-intuitive because we think of,

00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:36.680
 you know, biker jackets, spiky hair, guitars,

00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:38.720
 but the first bands to actually call themselves punk

00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:39.560
 were Suicide.

00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:43.800
 So Suicide were a kind of art noise duo in New York.

00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:45.040
 Martin Revere and Alan Vaid.

00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:48.560
 And they used synths and drum machines

00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:52.480
 and created a wonderful sort of sleazy,

00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:56.560
 uncomfortable, aggressive noise.

00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:59.680
 So I'm constantly fascinated with the history

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:02.440
 and the kind of taxonomy of music.

00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:04.640
 So with punk, punk was used as an insult.

00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:06.000
 You know, it was seen as putting them down

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.120
 and then Suicide were the first band to kind of lean into it.

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:11.880
 But punk in its origins was so much wider

00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:15.720
 as a genre and so much more experimental

00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:19.720
 and kind of arty than the dudes with loud guitars.

00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:20.560
 - Yeah, right.

00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:22.600
 I read an interview with these guys from Suicide

00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:25.600
 and they said that they did have a guitar at the very start

00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:26.760
 before they became Suicide

00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:28.640
 when they were just sort of starting out.

00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:29.480
 - Right.

00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:30.640
 - But the guitar player decided to leave

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:32.440
 and they realized that actually he wasn't really

00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:33.760
 contributing very much anyway.

00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:35.920
 So that's why they did without him.

00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:38.040
 - I listened to the album this morning,

00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:39.760
 their debut album in New York.

00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:43.200
 The album this morning, their debut album in 1977.

00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:47.320
 And it's noise and it's interesting

00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:49.400
 and it's wild lyrically.

00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:53.160
 There's an amazing song which is called "Frankie Teardrop"

00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:56.000
 and it's a song that's been cited by quite a lot of people

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.000
 as an influential song.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.760
 So Nick Hornby wrote a book called "31 Songs"

00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:02.400
 where he picked 31 songs that have altered his life

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:04.040
 in some ways and he says it's a song

00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:05.840
 that you should only hear once

00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:07.440
 'cause it's just too intense.

00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:08.560
 And it is really intense.

00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:10.120
 It's a story of a guy who goes home,

00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:12.760
 he kills his family and then you follow his own death

00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:14.640
 and then his journey into hell.

00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:16.560
 And it's just this soundscape of noise.

00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:19.120
 And it's horrific but hugely influential.

00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:22.200
 "Springsteen" was influenced by this.

00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:25.480
 Yeah, like a lot of people were influenced by suicide

00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:26.320
 that you would not expect.

00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:28.400
 - Actually, I don't prove "Springsteen" songs

00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:31.160
 like a lot more depressing than people make out.

00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:33.720
 Like "Born in the USA" is about someone

00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:36.400
 being really disheartened about America after the war.

00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:37.440
 - Oh yeah.

00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:40.600
 Yeah, a lot of his songs are about rough living

00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:43.800
 and suffering and a very downbeat in their meaning.

00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:45.560
 But if the music doesn't sound like that.

00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:49.120
 - Isn't it true that a lot of politicians use "Born in the USA"

00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:51.760
 as like their big sort of America fuck yeah kind of thing?

00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:54.280
 - Nationalistic flag waving kind of thing.

00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:57.160
 It's exactly the opposite of that, which is true.

00:34:57.160 --> 00:34:58.880
 Isn't it pretty much any artist

00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:00.960
 that gets co-opted by a politician will go,

00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:04.120
 you've not really paid attention to the lyrics.

00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:05.160
 - Andrew, you're doing a whole show

00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:06.160
 about the history of punk.

00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:07.880
 So is this your opinion

00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:09.960
 that they're sort of the first punk band?

00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:11.920
 Or is that agreed?

00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:13.440
 - Not that they're the first punk band,

00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:15.360
 but they're the first band to call themselves punk.

00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:16.200
 - Right.

00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:17.040
 - Because there's a thing that happens, isn't there,

00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:20.480
 with sort of genres where before a genre gets named,

00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:22.160
 it can be quite amorphous.

00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:25.400
 The meaning isn't kind of ossified yet.

00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:28.520
 So I would argue the first punk band was the Stooges,

00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:29.840
 Iggy Pop and the Stooges.

00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:30.680
 - Okay.

00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:34.160
 - Do you find, Andrew, that when people get put

00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:35.400
 into those categories,

00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:38.440
 then they start sort of living up towards it.

00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:39.280
 - Absolutely right.

00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:41.080
 - So if people call you a death metal band,

00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:42.760
 then your next three albums

00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:44.480
 are just going to be heavier and heavier.

00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:45.320
 - That's absolutely it.

00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:48.080
 And also there's a thing where people start to form bands

00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:49.960
 based on the tax on it.

00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:52.120
 So basically the map becomes the territory.

00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:53.400
 So you put a thing out saying,

00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:55.000
 I want to form a thrash band.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.000
 You kind of already know what that's going to sound like.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.920
 - That suicide album, the 1977 one,

00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:03.360
 was described as taxi driver, the musical.

00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:04.920
 - Yeah, I think it is.

00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:06.520
 Which I think suits it quite nicely.

00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:09.760
 - And they toured with the Clash.

00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:10.600
 - Right.

00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:13.520
 - And Clash fans universally hated them

00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:16.280
 because they wanted a band that sounded like the Clash.

00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:18.640
 And they got a band that sounded like

00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:21.600
 stoned, speed freak Elvis,

00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:24.760
 playing over horrible keyboards and drum machine.

00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:27.400
 - Do you know on the Clash,

00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:30.520
 so Mick Jones as founder of Clash, I think,

00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:33.800
 and was league guitarist and his first cousin.

00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:35.200
 Do you know who his first cousin is?

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:39.080
 - Oh, not Davy Jones from Tom Jones.

00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:40.320
 - It's not a Jones, sorry.

00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:41.600
 I fled you up the garden path.

00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:43.040
 - It's a tough one to guess.

00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:44.360
 - It's a really tough one to guess.

00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:46.800
 Basically what I'm telling you is the Clash are,

00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:48.760
 you know, punk, very, very cool.

00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:50.320
 This guy, not cool.

00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:51.160
 Look, shall I tell you?

00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:52.680
 - Is it Jacob Rees-Mogg?

00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:54.000
 - You're so close.

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:54.840
 Oh my God, Dan.

00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:56.440
 You're in the right political party.

00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:57.280
 You're in the right era.

00:36:57.280 --> 00:36:59.480
 - Oh, is it David Davis?

00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:00.320
 - You're close.

00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:01.640
 - Grant Shaps.

00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:02.480
 - Grant Shaps.

00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:06.680
 - Grant Shaps is first cousins with the Clash.

00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:09.040
 - Grant Shaps was used by Alan Partridge

00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:11.480
 to denote someone that's absolutely,

00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:13.040
 totally middle of the road page.

00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:14.760
 - Exactly, I'm afraid.

00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:17.280
 And in fact, his brother is called Andre,

00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:19.760
 and he's in a band called Big Audio Dynamite

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:22.320
 with Mick Jones, who's, you know, Clash guy.

00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:23.160
 - Still going.

00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:24.000
 - So there you go.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:24.840
 Cooler than you thought, Grant Shaps.

00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:26.800
 - Cooler, yeah, that's amazing.

00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:28.760
 - As if that could be possible.

00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:29.600
 - I know.

00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:31.640
 - It's strange, isn't it?

00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:34.160
 Because, you know, there's that thing of like,

00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:35.320
 so many people in there.

00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:37.880
 So Joe Strummer went to private school.

00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:41.120
 Like, the idea that someone who went to,

00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:44.000
 like actually a public school could be in a punk band.

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.760
 In the 80s would have been incredible,

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:47.040
 but it was absolutely what happened,

00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:49.480
 that kind of flourishing of bringing people together.

00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:51.200
 I mean, the Bromley contingents,

00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:53.240
 so Suzie Sue and others.

00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:56.560
 Yeah, they were very definitely suburban middle class.

00:37:56.560 --> 00:38:00.920
 It wasn't sort of street based as it kind of came to be seen.

00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:02.400
 There are so many contradictions in it.

00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:05.160
 Like, I mean, the young ones, the most punk TV show,

00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:07.120
 nearly everybody involved in that is privately educated.

00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:08.640
 - Yeah, they absolutely are, aren't they?

00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:10.120
 - Yeah, you're so true.

00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:11.800
 When you sent over this fact,

00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:13.840
 I started looking into guitars.

00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:19.040
 I realized I didn't know much about the history of guitars.

00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:21.720
 And one thing that I got really excited by was,

00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:23.440
 in the early days, let's say,

00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:25.040
 around the time of the Beatles,

00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:28.400
 guitar chords were a bit more secretive, it seems.

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:29.960
 And I didn't know that.

00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:31.720
 So there's this amazing story.

00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:33.160
 - Amazing Paul McCartney story.

00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:35.960
 - Yeah, so there's a great McCartney and Lennon story

00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:38.280
 where they heard in Liverpool

00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:40.760
 that there was someone who was a crosstown

00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:43.400
 who knew the chord B7.

00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:46.520
 And they got on the bus and they traveled all the way

00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:49.280
 and they met him and they said, "Show us B7."

00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:52.080
 And he showed them and they said it was a turning point

00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:54.720
 for their composition and kind of was part of

00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:56.360
 how the Beatles became the Beatles.

00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:58.200
 It was the Lost Chord, he called it.

00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:00.680
 And they went back home, they showed everyone B7

00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:02.000
 and they spread it around.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:03.760
 And I thought, "That sounds ridiculous."

00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:07.160
 But when you read into the early days of guitar,

00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:09.000
 if you were an amazing guitarist,

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:12.280
 you'd kind of clasp onto what you were able to do.

00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:13.800
 So there was a guy who was known as the king

00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:16.120
 in jazz guitaring called Freddie Keppard.

00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:18.160
 And Freddie Keppard had a picking style

00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:20.400
 that was so unique that when he went on stage,

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:23.560
 he used to put a handkerchief over his picking hand

00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:27.080
 so that no one could see the magic going on underneath.

00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:28.600
 - 'Cause I can't play guitar,

00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:30.880
 so the analogy I can make is with piano.

00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:32.680
 And the idea of having a new piano chord,

00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:34.600
 like I could just bash some keys together

00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:37.160
 that don't sound very good and say I've made a new one.

00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:39.520
 But was B7 something that sounded amazing

00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:41.800
 and no one had discovered this combination of notes?

00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:44.000
 - It sort of just doesn't make sense, Anna,

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.800
 because it's quite, it's a simplicity chord, yeah.

00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:48.080
 - But it does fit really well

00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:50.440
 with the other easy to play cards, isn't it?

00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:52.440
 - It's in the same area of the guitar.

00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:53.760
 There's not much change.

00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:55.520
 - We just hadn't discovered it sounded good.

00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:56.360
 - No, we knew it.

00:39:56.360 --> 00:39:57.640
 - It exists in music.

00:39:57.640 --> 00:39:58.480
 - Yeah.

00:39:58.480 --> 00:39:59.640
 - Oh, so they'll just pull and John didn't know it.

00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:00.480
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:02.320
 - Yeah, they will have heard it,

00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:04.680
 but not known where to put their fingers to get that sound.

00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:05.680
 - Yeah.

00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:07.680
 - I think also, Anna, like you say,

00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:10.080
 I could just bash the keys and get something.

00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:12.840
 I used to think that if, 'cause I'm terrible at drawing,

00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:14.960
 I thought if I just draw enough times,

00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:18.360
 eventually my lines will turn into something beautiful.

00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:20.280
 But it doesn't quite work like that for some reason.

00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:22.040
 - I had exactly the same approach to the guitar.

00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:23.440
 Someone told me early on

00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:26.120
 that Hendrix didn't know what notes he was playing.

00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:27.280
 And that's a lie.

00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:28.800
 (both laughing)

00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:30.240
 'Cause Hendrix was a session musician.

00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:31.360
 Hendrix on the chilling circuit.

00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:32.600
 Hendrix played for absolutely everyone.

00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:33.720
 He played for Little Richard.

00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:36.280
 He played for, you know, he backed so many bands.

00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:38.520
 And you can't do that without knowing what key you're in

00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:40.960
 and what, literally, what notes you're playing.

00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:42.960
 So I absolutely had, James, I had exactly the same thing.

00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:45.680
 But if I just keep playing, eventually I'll put a note.

00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:49.800
 And then I'm now like 30 years odd later,

00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:52.080
 starting to learn some theory and going,

00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:54.440
 "Oh, this makes it so much better."

00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:55.400
 (both laughing)

00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:56.240
 But there's that thing.

00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:57.280
 When I've got my, I can actually,

00:40:57.280 --> 00:40:59.720
 I can actually demonstrate.

00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:02.840
 It, you know, it just sounds so, so D, D7.

00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:07.760
 It adds so much texture and kind of emotion to it.

00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:09.680
 But the other thing about the Beatles

00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:11.800
 was that they were one of the first,

00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:12.800
 well, they're basically the first band

00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:16.280
 to make writing their own music the thing within pop music.

00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:17.360
 That's like the mind-blowing thing,

00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:19.040
 Elvis didn't write his songs.

00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:19.880
 - Yeah.

00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:22.840
 - Paul McCartney, who famously did write his songs.

00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:25.680
 His guitar flies first class.

00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:27.120
 He books it his own seat.

00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:28.480
 I wanna know how the booking works.

00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:29.600
 'Cause when you're on EasyJet,

00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:31.120
 you have to put in passport details

00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:34.040
 and I don't believe it has a passport.

00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:37.000
 But BB King actually used to fly his guitar as well.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:37.840
 - Lucille.

00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:39.280
 - In its own, in its own playing.

00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:40.960
 Yeah, Lucille, was that what the guitar was called?

00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:41.800
 - Yeah.

00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:42.760
 - King's guitar's called Lucille.

00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:44.480
 - That's insane because he didn't book it

00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:45.640
 under the name Lucille.

00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:48.040
 He booked it under the name Mr. Guitar.

00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:49.240
 (laughing)

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:52.000
 Well, that's when Elton John books into a hotel.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:53.080
 You don't give your real name.

00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:55.120
 You don't want people knowing Lucille's on the plane.

00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:56.200
 They might see it. - No, good point.

00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:57.400
 - It's a pseudonym.

00:41:57.400 --> 00:41:59.360
 He named it Lucille apparently

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:02.520
 because he had to rescue one of his guitars

00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:05.440
 from a fire in a building that was started by two men

00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:07.640
 having a fight over a woman called Lucille.

00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:08.480
 - Really?

00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:10.160
 - Yeah, so that's where that name comes from.

00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:12.520
 Angus Young called his the workhorse,

00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:15.600
 what does call it, Willie Nelson's is trigger.

00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:17.160
 They've all got their nicknames for them.

00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:18.000
 - That's very sweet.

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:19.280
 - Willie Nelson's trigger guitar.

00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:22.080
 He replaced the neck eight times and the body three times.

00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:24.360
 (laughing)

00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:26.920
 - Hey, do you know the Eminem song, My Name Is?

00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:28.800
 I mean, who doesn't, what a stupid question.

00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:30.680
 There's a guitar and bass part in that,

00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:32.720
 like one of the really familiar bits you'd recognise.

00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:33.560
 - Yeah.

00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:36.040
 - Do you know who plays the guitar and bass on that?

00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:36.880
 - Oh, Andrew.

00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:37.720
 - Yeah, Andrew knows it.

00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:38.760
 - Chaz and Dave, isn't it?

00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:40.400
 - It's Chaz and Dave.

00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:41.360
 It's so cool.

00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:43.000
 - So who were Chaz and Dave?

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:46.080
 I know their names, but I don't fully know what they were.

00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:48.960
 They were like Cockney, they made like Cockney songs.

00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:49.800
 - Rockney.

00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:50.640
 - Yeah.

00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:53.240
 - Chaz and Dave were session musicians

00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:54.720
 and they played with absolutely everyone

00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:55.960
 and they were incredible musicians.

00:42:55.960 --> 00:42:58.640
 And what they decided they wanted to do was,

00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:00.280
 the big thing was they wanted to do rock and roll

00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:02.760
 in their own accent because every British band

00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:05.120
 that did rock and roll adopted an American accent

00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:07.560
 and Chaz Hodges' big thing was he wanted to write

00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:09.720
 a love song in his own accent.

00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:11.120
 So they came up with this thing, Rockney.

00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:12.880
 And I, I mean, I adore Chaz and Dave.

00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:14.440
 I unironically love them.

00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:16.720
 - I was on tour in New Zealand

00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:19.200
 and when you do New Zealand, you're already homesick

00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:21.000
 and New Zealand feels like the end of the world

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:23.120
 'cause of the way it sticks out into the Pacific.

00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:26.680
 And one of the other comics I was getting was Terry Alderton.

00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:28.920
 We were both being homesick and you went, listen to this.

00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:32.000
 And it's a Chaz and Dave song called "That's What I Like"

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:33.320
 and it's just a list.

00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:35.760
 It's like the amily of pop music.

00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:37.960
 Cheese and onion sandwiches and Darby China

00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:39.600
 where whittles and jigs are wooing me,

00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:40.920
 dogging me on if I haven't a swear.

00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:42.800
 It's absolutely gorgeous.

00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:44.760
 Like, I completely unironically love them.

00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:45.600
 - Yeah, amazing.

00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:46.440
 - They are cracking.

00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:49.440
 - So they weren't in the studio with Eminem though, right?

00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:50.560
 This was a sample, presumably.

00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:51.480
 - No, it was a sample.

00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:52.320
 - Okay.

00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:53.160
 - Yeah.

00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:54.000
 - Okay.

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.040
 - Okay, punks and samples.

00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:57.800
 That takes me to Daft Punk.

00:43:57.800 --> 00:43:59.040
 - Uh-huh.

00:43:59.040 --> 00:43:59.880
 - The band Daft Punk.

00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:03.520
 So there is a species that has been discovered

00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:08.200
 known as by Kallelia Daft Punka, okay?

00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:09.960
 It's a type of flatworm.

00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:12.000
 And do you know why it got that name?

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.800
 Is it, does it wear hoods, masks over its face all the time?

00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:16.280
 - I like, yeah, like a big helmet.

00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:17.120
 - Yeah.

00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:17.960
 - You're close enough.

00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:18.800
 I'll let you have it.

00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:20.800
 And it has a helmet-shaped structure

00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:22.960
 on the end of its penis.

00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:23.800
 - Okay.

00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:25.120
 - Okay.

00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:27.520
 - That's not where they wear theirs, I don't think.

00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:29.320
 - I like to think that Daft Punk,

00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:30.720
 if they tuck their trousers down,

00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:32.520
 they would have the same helmets.

00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:34.120
 - They do.

00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:36.120
 - So you can't identify them by their penis.

00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:36.960
 - They're just so fractal

00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:39.120
 and then on a cellular level, they're helmets.

00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:40.880
 (laughing)

00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:42.640
 - It's helmets all the way down.

00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:43.480
 - Yeah.

00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:46.640
 Do you know who Daft Punk were very influenced by?

00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:47.480
 - Suicide.

00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:48.480
 - Suicide.

00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:49.320
 - Were they?

00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:50.520
 - Yeah, they cite, they cite.

00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:52.640
 I mean, 'cause if you listen to it, it is,

00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:54.120
 it's electro music, really,

00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:56.360
 when you listen to that opening album.

00:44:56.360 --> 00:44:59.000
 So yeah, they cite them as influences.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.600
 Hey, listen, we need to wrap up in a second.

00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:05.280
 Andrew, before we do, you're in Edinburgh.

00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:07.600
 - I am, I'm doing two shows, 'cause I'm an idiot.

00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:09.320
 I'm doing two shows and I broke my leg in February,

00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:11.220
 so I am behind.

00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:14.800
 I'm doing Andrew and Neil's History of Punk

00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:17.400
 at Bannermans at 11.30 p.m.,

00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:19.400
 and that starts on the 1st of August,

00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:21.960
 right through not doing Mondays or Tuesdays,

00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:23.240
 'cause I'm actually a little bit more sensible

00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:24.080
 than I used to be.

00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:26.680
 And I'm doing a stand-up show

00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:29.960
 that discusses my three-point model of political difference,

00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:32.000
 which I think might be the only genuinely original idea

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:33.120
 I've ever had,

00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:37.320
 three ways in which people disagree or are wrong politically,

00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:39.560
 and it's got tons of very, very stupid jokes

00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:41.120
 and a thing about rhombus,

00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:42.280
 and that's could escape,

00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:45.920
 and it's on at 7.10 p.m. at Monkey Barrel.

00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:48.520
 So yeah, two shows. - Two years was awesome.

00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:51.100
 (upbeat music)

00:45:51.100 --> 00:45:56.000
 - It's time for our final fact of the show,

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:58.520
 and that is Ahir Shah.

00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:01.480
 - So my fact is that Andrew Carnegie

00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:03.200
 tried to achieve world peace

00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:05.600
 by sending countries dinosaurs.

00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:09.520
 - Yes, the common enemy.

00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:11.680
 I don't think you get to be like

00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:14.360
 that successful and wealthy and industrialist

00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:16.840
 without being a bit of an ideas guy.

00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:21.640
 And like, are all of them gonna come off necessarily?

00:46:21.640 --> 00:46:25.520
 No, but you can say that you did your level best.

00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:26.640
 - I think it's a great idea.

00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:30.000
 Like, you know, the idea of everyone having nuclear weapons

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:31.680
 so that no one attacks each other.

00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:33.480
 - Yeah, mutilation of dinosaurs.

00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:35.880
 - Yeah, that's perfect.

00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:37.880
 And you could make it so like the bigger countries

00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:39.080
 have smaller dinosaurs

00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:41.120
 and the smaller countries have bigger dinosaurs.

00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:43.080
 - Oh, we're being progressive, are we?

00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:45.040
 So the Vatican would have to have like

00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:48.040
 the largest of titan, it would be as big as the Vatican.

00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:52.760
 - So aside from all this absurd reasoning,

00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:55.680
 what was the idea behind world peace

00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:57.840
 being created by dinosaur diplomacy?

00:46:57.840 --> 00:47:00.440
 - Well, it wasn't necessarily,

00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:04.400
 it was another MAD mutually assured Diplodocus

00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:07.440
 or however we want to pronounce it, basically.

00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:10.480
 I'm sure that many, if not most of the listeners

00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:13.680
 will have seen Dippy, the famous skeleton

00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:16.160
 in the Natural History Museum, right?

00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:20.120
 And basically the idea was that in 1899,

00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:23.360
 the original sort of Dippy, Dippy's a composite skeleton,

00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:26.120
 but the sort of main part of it was found in Wyoming

00:47:26.120 --> 00:47:30.240
 on a expedition that had been sponsored by Carnegie.

00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:33.280
 Now, this is like something no one's ever seen before, right?

00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:35.960
 This is gonna change the game in a huge way.

00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:38.320
 And a couple of years later,

00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:43.320
 King Edward goes up to Carnegie's castle in Scotland

00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:47.920
 and sees just like a picture of the Dippy skeleton.

00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:50.880
 I was like, oh, it'd be great to have something like that

00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:53.640
 for the Natural History Museum.

00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:57.240
 And Carnegie really rolls with this.

00:47:57.240 --> 00:47:58.840
 And I believe like at his own expense,

00:47:58.840 --> 00:48:01.960
 like commissions a guy to do a plaster cast of it,

00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:03.040
 the guy's initially just like,

00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:04.720
 no, I don't want to do that.

00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:08.120
 It's massive, like no one's ever attempted to do anything

00:48:08.120 --> 00:48:09.200
 on this scale before.

00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:12.520
 But sure enough, it ends up in the Natural History Museum

00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:13.360
 and to great fanfare,

00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:15.680
 millions of people have seen this for the first time.

00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:18.640
 And I guess Carnegie gets it into his head

00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:22.600
 that this is something about scientific discovery

00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:24.720
 and everyone working together

00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:27.040
 and cross national cooperation.

00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:29.200
 And so pretty much every year

00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:31.920
 of the first decade of the 1900s,

00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:36.000
 he's giving one of these things out to different countries

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:38.920
 on the understanding that how could we possibly

00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:42.720
 fight one another if everyone has a dinosaur?

00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:43.560
 You know?

00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:45.840
 - A Dippy, that makes perfect sense.

00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:48.400
 - Yeah, and so over the course of the first decade

00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:51.320
 of the 1900s, we're talking there's one in France,

00:48:51.320 --> 00:48:53.880
 in Germany, in Italy, in Russia.

00:48:53.880 --> 00:48:56.800
 These didn't work, right?

00:48:56.800 --> 00:49:00.360
 And Mr. Carnegie took the beginning

00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:03.600
 of the Great War very badly

00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:06.560
 because he was basically just like,

00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:08.200
 "I gave you all a fucking dinosaur."

00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:10.280
 (laughing)

00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:12.560
 Like, "Lads, what are we doing?"

00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:14.560
 - And he was so upset, wasn't he?

00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:16.400
 I mean, I know quite a lot of people were upset

00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:17.560
 about the First World War.

00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:19.400
 Maybe some people suffered even more than him,

00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:21.440
 but a lot of biographies say he sort of died

00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:23.640
 of a broken heart in 1919

00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:27.520
 because he was so devastated that his plan hasn't worked

00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:29.320
 and World War I happened anyway.

00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:30.600
 But he saw the end of the war.

00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:32.760
 He might have lived to friend of the podcast,

00:49:32.760 --> 00:49:35.120
 The Treaty of Versailles, if it was 1919,

00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:36.160
 'cause that was the year that was signed.

00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:37.720
 So that should have given him a new lease of life.

00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:40.040
 It's like, "Oh, great, now we can resume the dinosaur

00:49:40.040 --> 00:49:40.880
 "with this batch."

00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:42.800
 - But then he read the treaty and was like,

00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:44.480
 "This doesn't even mention the dinosaurs, come on."

00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:46.240
 (laughing)

00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:48.360
 Like, how do you expect this piece to hold?

00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:50.080
 It should be the Treaty of Velociraptor

00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:52.280
 and then everyone's gonna have it.

00:49:52.280 --> 00:49:53.200
 - It's so good.

00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:56.320
 Because I, so the things I didn't know about this,

00:49:56.320 --> 00:49:57.760
 I mean, I didn't know anything about this story.

00:49:57.760 --> 00:49:59.640
 I'd only vaguely heard of Andrew Carnegie, to be honest,

00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:02.360
 as, you know, the man who sold steel to the world,

00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:04.080
 like, made steel, made, you know,

00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:05.480
 big American industrialist.

00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:07.920
 But he was looking for an exhibit for his museum.

00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:08.800
 That's what started all this.

00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:12.080
 He had the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh

00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:15.480
 and he needed a showstopper and he read in the paper,

00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:17.760
 oh, they found this gigantic thing.

00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:20.200
 And actually what had been found was a thigh bone.

00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:22.840
 So it was, it was just a femur.

00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:25.640
 And so he wrote to the director of the museum saying,

00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:27.080
 "You must buy this."

00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:29.120
 And the museum director was in an awkward spot

00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:31.120
 'cause you can't just buy a boat,

00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:33.480
 like one bone is not a showstopper for a museum.

00:50:33.480 --> 00:50:34.320
 That's rubbish.

00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:36.760
 So he said, "Well, we've got to find another one then."

00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:38.680
 And he started funding all the expeditions.

00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:39.920
 And thank God they found,

00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:40.920
 they found, this is very American,

00:50:40.920 --> 00:50:43.200
 they found it on the 4th of July.

00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:44.040
 - Did they?

00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:44.880
 - They did.

00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:45.720
 - Oh, that's nice.

00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:46.840
 - It's very American.

00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:49.040
 - I bet they didn't, I bet they found it in June

00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:52.080
 and they were like, "Zip it, wait a couple of weeks."

00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:55.280
 - I was looking at some of these other ones

00:50:55.280 --> 00:50:57.520
 that are around the world.

00:50:57.520 --> 00:51:00.560
 And for instance, one was donated

00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:05.560
 to the paleontological museum in Munich, Germany in 1932

00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:09.000
 and wasn't mounted at that, of course,

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:10.600
 what happens in 1933 in Germany.

00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:14.560
 And it's like, guys, if you just do the dinosaur thing,

00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:18.160
 it might help, but like everyone goes very extreme

00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:20.400
 when they're not doing the dinosaur thing.

00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:22.720
 - Wow, I wonder if anyone's ever made that connection before.

00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:23.560
 I love it.

00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:24.400
 - Is that why?

00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:26.240
 - Is it perhaps that the dinosaur thing

00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:27.920
 is leading up to this war?

00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:29.680
 - Oh, right, okay, yes.

00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:31.880
 - If you've got a couple of kids

00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:33.480
 and one of them has an ice cream,

00:51:33.480 --> 00:51:35.240
 you think I'm gonna give them all ice creams

00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:36.600
 and that'll make them all happy,

00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:38.520
 but it really doesn't work like that.

00:51:38.520 --> 00:51:40.560
 - Well, 'cause they go, "My ice cream's better than yours."

00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:41.720
 You've got the fake ice cream.

00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:42.960
 I'm the one with the real one.

00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:43.800
 - In precisely.

00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:44.640
 - Yeah.

00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:46.280
 And in fact, the Natural History Museum

00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:49.680
 and British commentators were really sniffy about Dippy.

00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:50.960
 They were so rude about him.

00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:51.800
 Yeah, they were.

00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:54.560
 So the people absolutely loved it,

00:51:54.560 --> 00:51:56.680
 but basically all the reviews said,

00:51:56.680 --> 00:51:58.200
 "This is a fuss about nothing."

00:51:58.200 --> 00:52:00.280
 They wouldn't put Dippy in the paleontology section.

00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:03.920
 So Dippy was in the gallery of small reptiles.

00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:07.720
 - Watch, stop it, that can't be true.

00:52:07.720 --> 00:52:09.400
 - That's right, that's where he was housed,

00:52:09.400 --> 00:52:12.160
 feeling pretty out of place, I imagine.

00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:14.760
 And the reviews tended to focus on the fact

00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:16.520
 that he wasn't particularly interesting

00:52:16.520 --> 00:52:20.120
 because of the size of his brain or her brain, sorry.

00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:21.440
 So reviews said things like,

00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:23.560
 "The brain cavity is no bigger than a walnut.

00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:25.320
 How can we get excited by this?"

00:52:25.320 --> 00:52:27.640
 Dippy's obviously a complete moron.

00:52:27.640 --> 00:52:29.760
 One of the, in fact, the guy who accepted it

00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:31.800
 on behalf of the Natural History Museum

00:52:31.800 --> 00:52:33.960
 in his acceptance speech said,

00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:36.360
 "Given that this animal was clearly very stupid,

00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:39.520
 the size of it doesn't really add much to the interest."

00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:41.640
 So it was this, and I think it was British jealousy

00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:44.040
 about the fact that we tended to export our science

00:52:44.040 --> 00:52:45.800
 to America in this field,

00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:48.040
 and America suddenly waltzed in

00:52:48.040 --> 00:52:49.880
 with their big showstopper.

00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:51.600
 But fortunately, the people didn't give a shit

00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:52.600
 about the size of the brain

00:52:52.600 --> 00:52:54.360
 and thousands of people rocked up.

00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:57.000
 - And then, of course, Dippy isn't there anymore.

00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:59.800
 If you go to the NHM, it's Big Old Whale.

00:52:59.800 --> 00:53:01.960
 They got rid of it in 2017.

00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:04.760
 And when did the whole world start going to shit?

00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:07.000
 (laughing)

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:08.920
 - Exactly.

00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:10.720
 - Wait, wasn't it 2016?

00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:12.320
 - Annad, please. - Sorry, I hate that.

00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:13.800
 - They're 65 million years old.

00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:14.960
 What's a year here or there?

00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:15.800
 Come on.

00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:18.040
 (laughing)

00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:20.480
 - There is something in this.

00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:21.760
 (laughing)

00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:23.240
 - Can I say that I just love this so much

00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:24.840
 about the thing you mentioned there here

00:53:24.840 --> 00:53:26.320
 about King Edward VII,

00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:29.000
 and that's when prompted the first cast

00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:30.240
 to be made and dished out.

00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:33.280
 So King Edward VII, he'd only been King for a year.

00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:36.800
 It was 1902, and he visited Carnegie in Scotland

00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:38.680
 at his home, which is this amazing house

00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:40.280
 called Skibo Castle.

00:53:40.280 --> 00:53:42.320
 It had things that the world had never seen before,

00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:45.000
 like indoor toilets and electricity.

00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:46.640
 Like, it was the equivalent

00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:49.320
 of the most amazing space-age house at the time.

00:53:49.320 --> 00:53:51.560
 And Edward wanted to see the plumbing

00:53:51.560 --> 00:53:53.560
 'cause he wanted to restore all the royal palaces.

00:53:53.560 --> 00:53:55.360
 You know, Queen Victoria had been on the throne

00:53:55.360 --> 00:53:56.200
 in an incredibly long time.

00:53:56.200 --> 00:53:57.600
 They were very dilapidated.

00:53:57.600 --> 00:53:58.760
 He was like, "Get out of there!

00:53:58.760 --> 00:53:59.600
 "I need to come!"

00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:01.880
 (laughing)

00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:04.440
 And so, Edward wanted some of that, basically,

00:54:04.440 --> 00:54:05.920
 and that's why he was visiting.

00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:08.960
 And the visit happened allegedly at such short notice

00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:12.000
 that the organ player for the household,

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:14.400
 again, if you're very rich, you just have one of these,

00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:16.440
 the organ player was in the swimming pool

00:54:16.440 --> 00:54:19.480
 and had to be hurriedly hauled out and towel himself off

00:54:19.480 --> 00:54:22.920
 so he could play God Save the King as the king arrived.

00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:24.080
 That is the story.

00:54:24.080 --> 00:54:26.600
 - And to be fair, as far as Bellina's go,

00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:28.520
 he seems like one of the good ones.

00:54:28.520 --> 00:54:29.360
 He gets, doesn't he?

00:54:29.360 --> 00:54:30.800
 I mean, I'm gonna say this, and next week,

00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:32.720
 it'll come out that he made lots of inappropriate jokes

00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:36.080
 to female colleagues, but at this point in time,

00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:38.000
 I think we can say Andrew Carnegie,

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:41.200
 pretty good guy, one of the big 19th century philanthropists

00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:42.880
 gave away a huge amount of his money,

00:54:42.880 --> 00:54:44.240
 about 90% of his fortune,

00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:49.240
 equivalent of $11 billion today to charities and foundations.

00:54:49.240 --> 00:54:51.400
 So he really did wanna make the world a better place,

00:54:51.400 --> 00:54:52.240
 didn't he?

00:54:52.240 --> 00:54:55.200
 - Which of us allows their organ player in the swimming pool?

00:54:55.200 --> 00:54:57.560
 (laughing)

00:54:57.560 --> 00:54:59.720
 - I certainly don't, that's a good point.

00:54:59.720 --> 00:55:02.440
 - The wars were a bad time for some dinosaurs,

00:55:02.440 --> 00:55:05.320
 so Spinosaurus was a dinosaur

00:55:05.320 --> 00:55:08.720
 which went extinct about 60-odd million years ago,

00:55:08.720 --> 00:55:10.920
 and then it went extinct for a second time

00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:13.880
 during World War II because the British bombed it

00:55:13.880 --> 00:55:17.440
 in 1944 to smithereens, so it disappeared,

00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:18.800
 and we didn't have it anymore.

00:55:18.800 --> 00:55:19.640
 - Really?

00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:22.640
 - Yeah, but luckily, it's come to light again

00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:24.200
 in the last 20 years or so,

00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:26.320
 we've managed to find some more fossils,

00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:28.760
 so we got a chance to make it extinct a third time.

00:55:28.760 --> 00:55:30.000
 - Yes!

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:32.840
 - This really reminds me of, did you ever see that headline

00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:34.440
 that was something like,

00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:38.360
 "Cocaine in the Thames is another thing eels don't need?"

00:55:38.360 --> 00:55:40.800
 (laughing)

00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:43.160
 - Dinosaurs about to put up with so much.

00:55:43.160 --> 00:55:45.080
 - I've already got extinct once, mate.

00:55:45.080 --> 00:55:47.360
 (laughing)

00:55:47.360 --> 00:55:50.000
 - Do you know, I think maybe this is common knowledge

00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:53.240
 except to me, but dinosaurs were reptiles.

00:55:53.240 --> 00:55:54.280
 One of the mad things about dinosaurs

00:55:54.280 --> 00:55:56.640
 is we don't know if they were warm-blooded or cold-blooded.

00:55:56.640 --> 00:55:57.480
 What?

00:55:57.480 --> 00:55:59.560
 That's like so basic a thing to know,

00:55:59.560 --> 00:56:01.840
 but dinosaurs count as reptiles,

00:56:01.840 --> 00:56:03.680
 all birds are reptiles as well.

00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:06.320
 Technically, they're part of this group called diapsida,

00:56:06.320 --> 00:56:08.480
 which also includes all other reptiles,

00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:10.680
 but we're also reptiles.

00:56:10.680 --> 00:56:11.520
 Come on, well.

00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:12.340
 - No.

00:56:12.340 --> 00:56:13.180
 - The queen, obviously.

00:56:13.180 --> 00:56:15.520
 (laughing)

00:56:15.520 --> 00:56:16.720
 - That's why do you think the king

00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:18.080
 wanted these dinosaurs so much?

00:56:18.080 --> 00:56:19.440
 He wanted his mates around.

00:56:19.440 --> 00:56:23.200
 No, this is, if you go high enough up the taxonomy,

00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:25.720
 you're in the reptiliomorphic clade,

00:56:25.720 --> 00:56:28.440
 and that's mammals, birds, reptiles,

00:56:28.440 --> 00:56:31.640
 and the thing that it's not is frogs.

00:56:31.640 --> 00:56:33.680
 So I shouldn't like amphibians,

00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:35.160
 which are basically frogs, right?

00:56:35.160 --> 00:56:38.480
 - So basically everything that isn't the frog is the same.

00:56:38.480 --> 00:56:40.880
 - Sort of, with some insects and stuff.

00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:42.960
 But basically, there's all of us together.

00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:44.480
 And then frogs and nukes.

00:56:44.480 --> 00:56:47.960
 - I think that that would be a very funny prejudice to have.

00:56:47.960 --> 00:56:50.160
 (laughing)

00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:51.240
 - They're not like frogs.

00:56:51.240 --> 00:56:53.600
 - Everything in the world, like humans,

00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:56.600
 other species, objects, absolutely everything,

00:56:56.600 --> 00:56:58.600
 you treat entirely equally,

00:56:58.600 --> 00:57:01.480
 but you're a ginormous frogist.

00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:06.480
 - Yeah, like race is very old hat, clade is a lie.

00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:09.960
 - I think there's some background towards this,

00:57:09.960 --> 00:57:11.880
 and I think maybe we should be against frogs,

00:57:11.880 --> 00:57:16.120
 because there was a frog called Beelzebufo Ampinga

00:57:16.120 --> 00:57:18.360
 that lived 65 to 70 million years ago.

00:57:18.360 --> 00:57:19.760
 It was absolutely massive,

00:57:19.760 --> 00:57:21.840
 and it had very, very strong jaws,

00:57:21.840 --> 00:57:26.000
 so strong that they think it might be able to eat dinosaurs.

00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:28.160
 - No, not like a T-Rex.

00:57:28.160 --> 00:57:31.800
 - No, like little tiny chickeny ones, I guess.

00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:32.640
 - Cool.

00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:34.600
 - But yeah, like if the frogs and the dinosaurs

00:57:34.600 --> 00:57:36.320
 were fighting all the way back then,

00:57:36.320 --> 00:57:38.480
 it's hardly surprising that everyone on this call

00:57:38.480 --> 00:57:40.160
 is a frog racist right now.

00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:41.240
 (laughing)

00:57:41.240 --> 00:57:43.240
 - I mean, which one survived in the end?

00:57:43.240 --> 00:57:44.600
 - Here's a question.

00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:48.280
 Why do some dinosaurs have such small arms?

00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:50.000
 - This is a cracker joke.

00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:51.560
 (laughing)

00:57:51.560 --> 00:57:52.960
 I just feel it.

00:57:52.960 --> 00:57:55.000
 - It's not, it's not, it's a true question.

00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:58.320
 Like there was one called Gouamezia Okoei,

00:57:58.320 --> 00:58:00.280
 which has basically got no arms at all.

00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:01.880
 It's just got too tiny little,

00:58:01.880 --> 00:58:04.200
 just a few inches in length arms.

00:58:04.200 --> 00:58:05.880
 Obviously the Tyrannosaurus Rex

00:58:05.880 --> 00:58:07.880
 has very small arms as well.

00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:09.000
 What's going on there?

00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:11.120
 - I guess they didn't need to applaud anything,

00:58:11.120 --> 00:58:14.240
 you know, no plays or anything back then.

00:58:14.240 --> 00:58:15.480
 - But only bad plays.

00:58:15.480 --> 00:58:16.880
 - Only shit plays, yeah.

00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:18.200
 - Yeah.

00:58:18.200 --> 00:58:20.080
 - I suppose that's something that happens even now, right?

00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:23.520
 Like as in the ancestor of the Kiwi would have had wings

00:58:23.520 --> 00:58:24.440
 and the wings are just gone.

00:58:24.440 --> 00:58:27.000
 So a Kiwi, like if you x-ray it or something,

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:29.840
 a Kiwi is basically just like a ball with the legs.

00:58:29.840 --> 00:58:30.680
 - Absolutely.

00:58:30.680 --> 00:58:32.080
 So the Kiwi lost theirs

00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:34.240
 because they didn't really need it anymore.

00:58:34.240 --> 00:58:36.000
 And you don't need to use up the energy

00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:39.360
 to have body parts that you don't need.

00:58:39.360 --> 00:58:42.160
 So that's one theory, that they didn't need them anymore

00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:45.120
 because maybe they would eat things with their mouth.

00:58:45.120 --> 00:58:46.520
 So they didn't need to use their hands

00:58:46.520 --> 00:58:47.840
 to put things in their mouth anymore

00:58:47.840 --> 00:58:48.960
 'cause they had such big jaws,

00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:50.400
 they would just grab things and bite them.

00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:52.720
 And then they didn't use up the energy to make the arms,

00:58:52.720 --> 00:58:54.760
 they could use the energy elsewhere.

00:58:54.760 --> 00:58:56.920
 And the other idea is that they ate

00:58:56.920 --> 00:58:59.440
 in like real feeding frenzies.

00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:01.280
 And that if they had long arms,

00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:04.160
 then they'd just get ripped off in those feeding frenzies.

00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:05.000
 - What do you mean?

00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:06.120
 Like they'd rip each other's arms off

00:59:06.120 --> 00:59:07.480
 or they're going for swinging.

00:59:07.480 --> 00:59:10.440
 - So you've got like 10 T-Rexes all going

00:59:10.440 --> 00:59:13.680
 after the same bit of meat and they're all biting it.

00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:16.080
 And if you've got one T-Rex that looks like Mr. Tickle,

00:59:16.080 --> 00:59:18.480
 then his arms just gonna get bitten off.

00:59:18.480 --> 00:59:19.800
 - Oh my God.

00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:22.880
 So surely they got to a stage

00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:25.040
 where they were just biting each other's faces off instead.

00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:28.000
 - You're using your face to eat, that's the thing.

00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:28.840
 - Wow.

00:59:28.840 --> 00:59:29.920
 - Anyway, that's a theory.

00:59:29.920 --> 00:59:31.680
 - How long would it take us to start this process?

00:59:31.680 --> 00:59:33.000
 Like if I decided, you know what?

00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:36.080
 I'm just gonna go feeding frenzy on all my meals.

00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:39.160
 And then how many generations do I need to persuade

00:59:39.160 --> 00:59:41.720
 my children that they just don't need their arms?

00:59:41.720 --> 00:59:42.680
 'Cause I know it's gotta make me

00:59:42.680 --> 00:59:44.040
 more evolutionarily successful.

00:59:44.040 --> 00:59:45.560
 Like it's gotta make me better at breeding, right?

00:59:45.560 --> 00:59:46.760
 If I am eating quickly.

00:59:46.760 --> 00:59:47.720
 - Yes, this is the thing.

00:59:47.720 --> 00:59:50.120
 And I don't know whether necessarily on dates

00:59:50.120 --> 00:59:52.800
 that's the face directly into.

00:59:52.800 --> 00:59:57.320
 - We should wrap up here.

00:59:57.320 --> 00:59:59.440
 You're gonna be in Edinburgh.

00:59:59.440 --> 01:00:01.040
 Or maybe by the time people are listening,

01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:03.160
 you are in Edinburgh probably.

01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:04.560
 Where are you right now?

01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:07.520
 - So I will be at the Edinburgh Festival

01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:11.720
 doing a show from the 12th to the 24th.

01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:13.000
 That's not true.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:14.400
 It's the 14th of the 24th.

01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:16.160
 I'm just going up on the 12th.

01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:19.040
 So you might still see me, but on the street.

01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:22.320
 It is a work in progress,

01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:25.200
 showed towards a new tour that'll be happening next year.

01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:29.520
 And it is at noon at Monkey Barrel 3.

01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:31.720
 Lovely, Monkey Barrel 3.

01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:32.560
 Get there.

01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:38.680
 - Okay, that's it.

01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:42.200
 That is all of our guests' facts.

01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:43.400
 Go see their shows.

01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:44.440
 They're in Edinburgh.

01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:45.800
 It's gonna be an amazing month.

01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:47.240
 Get yourself up there.

01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:48.600
 And come back next week.

01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:50.400
 We'll have another episode waiting for you.

01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:51.360
 We'll see you then.

01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:52.200
 Goodbye.

01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:55.100
 (upbeat music)

01:00:55.940 --> 01:00:58.520
 (upbeat music)

01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:01.100
 (upbeat music)
