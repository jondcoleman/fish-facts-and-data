00:00:02,00:00:08,"- Hi everyone, welcome to another very, very special episode"
00:00:08,00:00:09,"of ""Noses Think As A Fish"""
00:00:09,00:00:13,where we showcase four more comedians
00:00:13,00:00:16,who are currently at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival.
00:00:16,00:00:18,So who do we have for you this week?
00:00:18,00:00:23,Fact number one will come from Elf Lyons.
00:00:23,00:00:25,Elf is a brilliant comedian.
00:00:25,00:00:28,You will hear from her fact that she is very much
00:00:28,00:00:30,into the clowning style of comedy.
00:00:30,00:00:34,Her shows have been so well received over the years.
00:00:34,00:00:37,"At last year's Edinburgh Fringe she won the best show,"
00:00:37,00:00:40,that's by the ISH or the Ish Comedy Awards.
00:00:40,00:00:43,She also won the Comedians Choice Award
00:00:43,00:00:45,and she'll be up there this year with three different shows.
00:00:45,00:00:47,So plenty for you to choose from
00:00:47,00:00:49,if you'd like to hear more of Elf.
00:00:49,00:00:52,Fact number two will be from Ray O'Leary.
00:00:52,00:00:54,Ray is a really good friend of ours.
00:00:54,00:00:56,He is a New Zealand comedian.
00:00:56,00:00:59,He's often seen on Australian television as well.
00:00:59,00:01:02,"A TV show over there called ""Have You Been Paying Attention?"""
00:01:02,00:01:03,"He's a regular on there,"
00:01:03,00:01:06,"but he's also been on ""Tastmaster New Zealand."""
00:01:06,00:01:07,He's a fantastic comedian.
00:01:07,00:01:10,"He's got such an amazing deadpan humour,"
00:01:10,00:01:11,but really smart as well.
00:01:11,00:01:12,I know you're gonna love him.
00:01:12,00:01:15,Fact number three comes from Andrew O'Neill.
00:01:15,00:01:19,"Andrew is an extremely prolific stand-up comedian,"
00:01:19,00:01:20,done so many shows over the years.
00:01:20,00:01:23,"Also musician, also best-selling writer."
00:01:23,00:01:25,"They wrote a book called ""The History of Heavy Metal."""
00:01:25,00:01:27,"Again, someone who we've known for many, many years"
00:01:27,00:01:30,and really wanted to get on some podcasts for a long time.
00:01:30,00:01:32,So I was delighted when they said yes.
00:01:32,00:01:36,"And finally, fact number four will come from Ahir Shah."
00:01:36,00:01:39,"Now Ahir, he's been nominated a few times, Reddabra,"
00:01:39,00:01:42,and he finally won it in 2023.
00:01:42,00:01:43,"He's a brilliant, brilliant comedian."
00:01:43,00:01:45,"We're all massive fans at QI,"
00:01:45,00:01:49,and of course he has done QI and all of the paddle shows.
00:01:49,00:01:51,So I'm sure you will be well familiar with him.
00:01:51,00:01:54,"But anyway, that's four incredible comedians,"
00:01:54,00:01:56,all of whom are currently slogging away
00:01:56,00:01:57,at the Edinburgh Festival.
00:01:57,00:02:00,"So if you are going up there, then please do check them out."
00:02:00,00:02:02,"And if you're not going to Edinburgh,"
00:02:02,00:02:03,"then like I said last week,"
00:02:03,00:02:06,"go and find these people on social media,"
00:02:06,00:02:07,check out all the work that they're doing
00:02:07,00:02:11,"because they come highly, highly recommended from us."
00:02:11,00:02:13,"Anyway, that's enough of me talking about, I guess,"
00:02:13,00:02:15,why don't you hear what they have to say
00:02:15,00:02:18,"when I say, on with the podcast."
00:02:18,00:02:20,(upbeat music)
00:02:21,00:02:25,(speaking in foreign language)
00:02:25,00:02:39,"Hello, and welcome to another episode"
00:02:39,00:02:41,"of No Such Thing as a Fish,"
00:02:41,00:02:43,a weekly podcast this week coming to you
00:02:43,00:02:47,from eight undisclosed locations around the world.
00:02:47,00:02:48,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:02:48,00:02:50,"I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,"
00:02:50,00:02:53,"James Harkin, Anna Tyshinski,"
00:02:53,00:02:55,"and four very, very special guests."
00:02:55,00:02:58,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:02:58,00:03:01,"with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,"
00:03:01,00:03:05,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:03:05,00:03:09,"Starting with fact number one, that is, Elf Lions."
00:03:09,00:03:11,"- The great clown teacher, Philip Golia,"
00:03:11,00:03:14,is so known for his negative feedback
00:03:14,00:03:16,that his former students created a Facebook page
00:03:16,00:03:20,purely to log all the many ways he's insulted them.
00:03:20,00:03:23,"The page is called, Philip Golia hit me with a stick."
00:03:23,00:03:27,"- I mean, this is a very, very famous clown teacher,"
00:03:27,00:03:30,"isn't it, Philip Golia?"
00:03:30,00:03:32,"And you've met him, haven't you, Elf?"
00:03:32,00:03:34,"- Yeah, I trained with him, and I still remember"
00:03:34,00:03:34,I came on stage.
00:03:34,00:03:37,"I think I was performing the Cyclops in Greek tragedy,"
00:03:37,00:03:40,"and he went, ""Who would you like to make love to?"""
00:03:40,00:03:42,"And then I picked a boy called Oliver,"
00:03:42,00:03:45,"and he was like, ""Oliver, take her to the shower."""
00:03:45,00:03:49,And then I got covered in ice water and then brought back
00:03:49,00:03:52,"and he's like, ""Oliver, hit her with a stick."""
00:03:52,00:03:55,"And then kiss her on the cheek, and then sing,"
00:03:55,00:03:57,and then say the text.
00:03:57,00:04:00,"And I would start saying text like so speaking,"
00:04:00,00:04:03,"he drew the sharp sword, hung long and heavy on his side,"
00:04:03,00:04:05,"""And hit her with a stick."
00:04:05,00:04:08,"Ow, put more water on her."
00:04:08,00:04:09,"Not bad, goodbye."""
00:04:09,00:04:12,"And then I'd have to go and sit in the class,"
00:04:12,00:04:14,still covered in water.
00:04:14,00:04:17,And that wasn't even the weirdest thing that happened.
00:04:17,00:04:19,- So has Philip Gallier asked someone else
00:04:19,00:04:21,"to hit me with a stick, in your case?"
00:04:21,00:04:23,"- Yeah, it was just so silly."
00:04:23,00:04:25,"Like, I think people's concept,"
00:04:25,00:04:26,"if you haven't trained with him,"
00:04:26,00:04:28,is that you're just being emotionally abused.
00:04:28,00:04:30,"But like, it's emotional abuse"
00:04:30,00:04:33,in like a really fun clown way.
00:04:33,00:04:36,"- Is it, 'cause it sounds to me like being a clown teacher"
00:04:36,00:04:38,is one of the last remaining ways
00:04:38,00:04:41,you can get away with a lot of shit and not get sucked for it.
00:04:41,00:04:43,"- It sounds like an HR nightmare,"
00:04:43,00:04:46,is the phrase that keeps on cropping up with me.
00:04:46,00:04:48,"- Yeah, I think safeguarding is something"
00:04:48,00:04:51,"that's still being learned in the clowning community,"
00:04:51,00:04:53,I would argue.
00:04:53,00:04:55,"But you know what, we had good times."
00:04:55,00:04:56,We had good times.
00:04:56,00:04:57,He was cheeky.
00:04:57,00:05:01,"I mean, he just called me asparagus or wobbly giraffe."
00:05:01,00:05:04,Look at this wobbly giraffe with our wobbly body.
00:05:04,00:05:06,"- Again, I'm afraid to say, Elf,"
00:05:06,00:05:08,that is a tribunal waiting to happen.
00:05:08,00:05:12,Wobbly giraffe woman wins three million pounds
00:05:12,00:05:14,from elderly French clown.
00:05:14,00:05:15,- I think it's why I've coped so well
00:05:15,00:05:17,"in the comedy industry, to be honest."
00:05:17,00:05:19,"Because if I ever got heckled at the comedy store,"
00:05:19,00:05:23,"I'm like, you're not a sure old man in France telling me,"
00:05:23,00:05:27,would we wish she was on a plane to Malaysian Airlines?
00:05:27,00:05:29,- Which was one that I got frequently.
00:05:29,00:05:32,"- Right, have you contributed to the Facebook page,"
00:05:32,00:05:32,the insults?
00:05:32,00:05:35,- I think I must have done about 10 years ago.
00:05:35,00:05:37,"- Yeah, 'cause this was set up in 2007."
00:05:37,00:05:38,"The about section says,"
00:05:38,00:05:41,"""We are all variously insulted by Philippe Goliere"
00:05:41,00:05:43,in various cities at various times.
00:05:43,00:05:45,"Did he call you a toilet, a cretin?"
00:05:45,00:05:47,"When joining this group, please share an insult"
00:05:47,00:05:49,"you received from him, adios."""
00:05:49,00:05:52,"And yeah, people would put things like,"
00:05:52,00:05:54,"""You sound like overcooked spaghetti in a pressure cooker."""
00:05:54,00:05:57,"They will sound like they're not hugely harmful,"
00:05:57,00:05:59,but I have spoken to a few other people
00:05:59,00:06:00,who studied under him.
00:06:00,00:06:01,"My friend, Sam, did."
00:06:01,00:06:05,And she said she was so badly insulted by him.
00:06:05,00:06:07,"He talked about how dead her eyes were,"
00:06:07,00:06:10,that it was more dead than a family pet
00:06:10,00:06:15,"that had not only died, but been buried into the back garden"
00:06:15,00:06:17,that took ages to shovel and left for years and years.
00:06:17,00:06:19,And then a fountain's been built on it.
00:06:19,00:06:21,And then you go back and you dig it all up
00:06:21,00:06:23,and you take the pet back out and you look at his eyes.
00:06:23,00:06:25,"Her eyes are more dead than that, animals."
00:06:25,00:06:27,"Like he did it for like five minutes on stage,"
00:06:27,00:06:30,but she now runs clowns without borders UK.
00:06:30,00:06:32,So she went into it.
00:06:32,00:06:33,- And I bet her eyes are great.
00:06:33,00:06:34,Can I ask what the idea is?
00:06:34,00:06:36,"As someone who hasn't done clowning,"
00:06:36,00:06:39,what's the idea behind being like incessantly
00:06:39,00:06:40,and absurdly insulted?
00:06:40,00:06:42,Does it make you more funny and clowny?
00:06:42,00:06:43,"- I think, do you know what it is?"
00:06:43,00:06:46,It's about realizing that you can never
00:06:46,00:06:47,disguise anything about yourself.
00:06:47,00:06:50,You have to come on stage so full of pleasure
00:06:50,00:06:52,in your body and who you are.
00:06:52,00:06:54,Because if you try and conceal or hide
00:06:54,00:06:57,"what you look like, the audience are gonna notice it."
00:06:57,00:06:59,And also getting rid of the pride and the ego.
00:06:59,00:07:01,But it's so funny.
00:07:01,00:07:02,That's the thing.
00:07:02,00:07:03,Everybody's laughing.
00:07:03,00:07:05,And I remember once there was someone dressed as a gnome
00:07:05,00:07:08,"and she was so bad, she was so not funny."
00:07:08,00:07:09,"And he was like, ""You hate me, don't you?"""
00:07:09,00:07:11,"And she was like, ""Yeah, I do."""
00:07:11,00:07:13,"And he's like, ""How much do you hate me?"""
00:07:13,00:07:15,And she was as a little gnome.
00:07:15,00:07:17,"She was like, ""I hate you fucking hate you, Philippe."""
00:07:17,00:07:20,"He's like, ""Yeah, you tell me how much you hate me."
00:07:20,00:07:22,"How much you hate my face."""
00:07:22,00:07:24,- And she started getting really angry at him.
00:07:24,00:07:25,And it was the funniest thing.
00:07:25,00:07:28,Watching this like 50 year old woman dressed as a gnome
00:07:28,00:07:30,in Swedish shouting at this French man.
00:07:30,00:07:33,"He's like, ""Yes, you tell me how much you hate my guts."""
00:07:33,00:07:35,"So it's just, I think it's one of those things."
00:07:35,00:07:38,It's all context related.
00:07:38,00:07:40,"And I do genuinely, you could say there's a lot"
00:07:40,00:07:43,"of HR issues, but it is about the environment."
00:07:43,00:07:45,"And Philippe was pretty, if there were any issues"
00:07:45,00:07:47,"in the village, there was a village flasher"
00:07:47,00:07:49,who would just flash his penis
00:07:49,00:07:51,whilst we were all running.
00:07:51,00:07:53,"And Philippe, likewise, this has got to stop you."
00:07:53,00:07:55,Cannot all keep getting flashed to you.
00:07:55,00:07:56,And that'd be funny on stage.
00:07:56,00:07:59,I will call the mayor and rang the mayor
00:07:59,00:08:02,to sort out the flasher in the park.
00:08:02,00:08:04,- Was he sorted out?
00:08:04,00:08:06,- I think he was actually.
00:08:06,00:08:08,- Is that what it takes to sort out a flasher?
00:08:08,00:08:09,You need to tell the mayor
00:08:09,00:08:11,that it's ruining clown school.
00:08:11,00:08:15,"- Yeah, I mean, clown cop is an impressive premise"
00:08:15,00:08:16,for a TV show.
00:08:16,00:08:21,"- Oh God, from the makers of Tiberius Cop comes clown cop."
00:08:21,00:08:24,- So they sort of torturing people among clowns
00:08:24,00:08:26,does seem to be part of their modus operandi.
00:08:26,00:08:27,There's also a thing in America
00:08:27,00:08:30,where you can hire clowns to terrify your children.
00:08:30,00:08:31,"And I actually don't,"
00:08:31,00:08:35,this certainly was happening about eight or nine years ago.
00:08:35,00:08:36,"I can't say it happening now,"
00:08:36,00:08:38,but there's wrinkles the clown in Florida.
00:08:38,00:08:39,Do you guys know him?
00:08:39,00:08:41,- Don't like the sound of wrinkles.
00:08:41,00:08:44,- He hires himself out to parents
00:08:44,00:08:47,who want to petrify their children who are misbehaving.
00:08:47,00:08:48,"And he does things like,"
00:08:48,00:08:51,like one mother hired him to stand a bus stop
00:08:51,00:08:53,and stare at her 12 year old
00:08:53,00:08:54,until he freaked out so much
00:08:54,00:08:57,and started crying in front of his friends and ran home.
00:08:57,00:08:59,"- I'm sorry, any child"
00:08:59,00:09:00,"whose parents have hired wrinkles,"
00:09:00,00:09:02,the clown needs to be taken into care
00:09:02,00:09:03,a face of immediately.
00:09:03,00:09:04,"- It's quite weird, isn't it?"
00:09:04,00:09:05,Yeah.
00:09:05,00:09:07,There's another one called Dominic the Devil
00:09:07,00:09:10,"who stalks, I mean, it does sound bad,"
00:09:10,00:09:11,"who stalked victims for weeks,"
00:09:11,00:09:13,sending them chilling text messages
00:09:13,00:09:15,and making prank phone calls
00:09:15,00:09:16,"and sort of posting them notes,"
00:09:16,00:09:17,warning them they're being watched.
00:09:17,00:09:19,"And then eventually after weeks,"
00:09:19,00:09:20,he'll smash a cake in their face.
00:09:20,00:09:22,- That's noncy.
00:09:22,00:09:23,"Sorry, that's noncy."
00:09:23,00:09:25,"- Well, whatever makes you could do their homework,"
00:09:25,00:09:27,I think is the thinking.
00:09:27,00:09:28,- These guys have strayed quite far
00:09:28,00:09:32,from the joy ethos that the clowning apparently has.
00:09:32,00:09:35,"- I always wonder what the link with scary clowns is,"
00:09:35,00:09:37,there's the bouffon clown.
00:09:37,00:09:39,"So if you imagine the clown that we think of,"
00:09:39,00:09:41,"the playful circus clown has puppy eyes,"
00:09:41,00:09:43,"very innocent, the inner child,"
00:09:43,00:09:44,"then you've got the bouffon,"
00:09:44,00:09:47,"which has animal eyes, fox eyes."
00:09:47,00:09:49,And there's this myth that the bouffon
00:09:49,00:09:52,were the untouchables in the medieval period
00:09:52,00:09:54,and they lived outside of the town
00:09:54,00:09:55,and they lived in the swamps.
00:09:55,00:09:59,And it was everyone who was not respected in that time.
00:09:59,00:10:00,"And then there was one day of the year,"
00:10:00,00:10:02,the day of the bouffon where they could go
00:10:02,00:10:05,and blaspheme against God and say F you to the king
00:10:05,00:10:07,and they could exaggerate their bodies
00:10:07,00:10:09,to look like those were in charge
00:10:09,00:10:13,and basically stick a finger up to the power.
00:10:13,00:10:15,And Sasha Baron Cohen's borat
00:10:15,00:10:17,sort of originates from bouffon.
00:10:17,00:10:20,"But it's like the dark clown, it's really smart."
00:10:20,00:10:24,"It's not foolish, there's like an acidic twist to it."
00:10:24,00:10:28,"- And that's not where clown terror comes from, I think maybe."
00:10:28,00:10:31,'Cause do you remember how insane it was in 2016
00:10:31,00:10:35,when that's a new story for about a month of clown terror?
00:10:35,00:10:38,"Which is weird 'cause at the end of that year,"
00:10:38,00:10:39,"Donald Trump was elected, wasn't he?"
00:10:39,00:10:42,"So you never know, maybe it was a weird precedent."
00:10:42,00:10:45,"- Dan, earlier you mentioned clowns without borders"
00:10:45,00:10:47,and they're an amazing group.
00:10:47,00:10:50,"They go to the worst places in the world,"
00:10:50,00:10:51,like famine zones and war zones
00:10:51,00:10:53,and they entertain children.
00:10:53,00:10:55,And there was a peace run in the Washington Post
00:10:55,00:10:59,"this July, headlined, Donald Trump is not a clown."
00:10:59,00:11:00,I should know.
00:11:00,00:11:01,And it was by Tim Cunningham
00:11:01,00:11:04,who was the president of Clowns Without Borders.
00:11:04,00:11:06,"And he was saying, our joyful work"
00:11:06,00:11:08,has been diminished into an insult.
00:11:08,00:11:10,"Every election season, the word clown resurfaces"
00:11:10,00:11:13,to compare Washington politics to a circus.
00:11:13,00:11:15,And he was incredibly angry about this.
00:11:15,00:11:16,Clown is used by almost everyone
00:11:16,00:11:18,to belittle those seen as foolish or incompetent.
00:11:18,00:11:19,"The more we mistreat the word,"
00:11:19,00:11:22,the more we lose understanding of a sacred art form.
00:11:22,00:11:26,"And like, yes, but who's this clown?"
00:11:26,00:11:27,It's just a standard.
00:11:27,00:11:30,"- It's just such a good line, isn't it?"
00:11:30,00:11:31,"And if anyone, by the way,"
00:11:31,00:11:33,just a quick shout out for Clowns Without Borders.
00:11:33,00:11:36,"If anyone has any spare money, please donate it to them"
00:11:36,00:11:38,because they do incredible things.
00:11:38,00:11:39,They go into war-torn areas
00:11:39,00:11:41,and they look after refugee children
00:11:41,00:11:42,who just need a smile on their face.
00:11:42,00:11:43,They're really awesome.
00:11:43,00:11:46,"You mentioned Sasha Baron Cohen before, Elf."
00:11:46,00:11:48,"And he was a Gollier student, wasn't he?"
00:11:48,00:11:50,- He was indeed.
00:11:50,00:11:52,"So many, so many people in the world of entertainment"
00:11:52,00:11:55,"like Emma Thompson, Helena Bonham Carter, Rachel Weiss,"
00:11:55,00:11:57,"Jeffrey Rush, all studied underneath him."
00:11:57,00:12:00,So he's had like a huge impact in our general culture.
00:12:00,00:12:02,"But in movies as well,"
00:12:02,00:12:04,"Anna, we were just talking about"
00:12:04,00:12:07,how parents hire freaky clowns to stalk their kids.
00:12:07,00:12:10,"This is something that also gets used in movies,"
00:12:10,00:12:14,most famously in Close Encounters of the Third Kind.
00:12:14,00:12:17,Spielberg had a little boy who was his first acting role
00:12:17,00:12:19,and he needed to get this emotion out of him
00:12:19,00:12:22,when he was scared by seeing aliens outside a window.
00:12:22,00:12:25,"And behind the window, as he approached it,"
00:12:25,00:12:26,a sort of blind went down
00:12:26,00:12:28,and there was a terrifying clown standing there.
00:12:28,00:12:29,Absolutely freaked him out.
00:12:29,00:12:32,"Yeah, and then another blind went down"
00:12:32,00:12:34,and there was someone dressed as a gorilla.
00:12:34,00:12:36,So this kid just absolutely flipped out
00:12:36,00:12:38,and it was just- - What is going on?
00:12:38,00:12:39,- It was two of the crew who-
00:12:39,00:12:41,- And what's he trying to achieve with this kid?
00:12:41,00:12:43,- He wanted a motion of being scared.
00:12:43,00:12:44,- He needed a shot of someone
00:12:44,00:12:46,"wetting themselves in terror, apparently."
00:12:48,00:12:50,"- Gaila Liberté, are you familiar with the name Gaila Liberté?"
00:12:50,00:12:53,"- I possibly am, but I probably never pronounced it"
00:12:53,00:12:56,"as beautifully as you did, 'cause my dyslexia means"
00:12:56,00:12:59,I pronounce everything like it's going through chat GBT.
00:12:59,00:13:00,But tell me.
00:13:00,00:13:02,"- Well, he's one of very few clowns"
00:13:02,00:13:03,to have become a billionaire.
00:13:03,00:13:04,- Wow.
00:13:04,00:13:08,- So he is one of the co-founders of Cirque du Soleil.
00:13:08,00:13:09,- Okay.
00:13:09,00:13:12,"- He's been a stilt walker and a fire eater before,"
00:13:12,00:13:14,before founding this incredibly successful
00:13:14,00:13:16,global corporation of brilliant shows.
00:13:16,00:13:21,"And in 2009, he became the first ever clown in space."
00:13:21,00:13:26,He went to the International Space Station.
00:13:26,00:13:27,- Trest as a clown.
00:13:27,00:13:29,- We don't do anything to get taken seriously.
00:13:29,00:13:32,"I'm sorry, like, everyone, how Adam and everyone is"
00:13:32,00:13:34,in the clowning profession to be taken seriously.
00:13:34,00:13:37,We do such stupid things.
00:13:37,00:13:38,- He did a little like clowning.
00:13:38,00:13:41,There's a picture of him in his space suit with a nose on.
00:13:41,00:13:43,"And, you know, made the astronauts laugh a bit."
00:13:43,00:13:44,He was up there partly to make a speech
00:13:44,00:13:47,about the importance of clean water accessibility.
00:13:47,00:13:47,That was the thing.
00:13:47,00:13:51,"Anyway, the real punchline is that he paid $41 million"
00:13:51,00:13:53,to go and he was a billionaire by this point.
00:13:53,00:13:55,So he had a huge amount of money to spend.
00:13:55,00:13:57,But the funniest joke of all he made was that he claimed
00:13:57,00:13:59,the trip was a work expense and that therefore
00:13:59,00:14:02,he should not have to pay any tax on the $41 million
00:14:02,00:14:03,he'd spent going to space.
00:14:03,00:14:06,This was litigated for 10 years in the Canadian courts.
00:14:06,00:14:09,"And eventually, and I think about 2020,"
00:14:09,00:14:11,the Canadian Federal Court of Appeals ruled
00:14:11,00:14:13,that it was a personal trip he was making
00:14:13,00:14:15,and he would have to pay tax on that.
00:14:15,00:14:17,But I think that's a very funny joke.
00:14:17,00:14:18,"- I can't believe you're allowed to just go,"
00:14:18,00:14:21,he went to the ISS to do that.
00:14:21,00:14:21,I thought only astronauts.
00:14:21,00:14:22,- He cleared it with them first.
00:14:22,00:14:25,"Like, he didn't turn up outside the ISS"
00:14:25,00:14:27,just knocking on the hatch.
00:14:27,00:14:30,- How do you stow away in a rocket?
00:14:30,00:14:31,- There's massive shoes are poking out
00:14:31,00:14:34,from beneath the curtains on the...
00:14:34,00:14:37,"- Oh, we had a very cool clown connection"
00:14:37,00:14:39,"with no such thing as a fish, by the way,"
00:14:39,00:14:42,that happened on our Australia New Zealand tour.
00:14:42,00:14:45,So we did a fact about clowns ages ago
00:14:45,00:14:48,"that in New Zealand, a man was made redundant."
00:14:48,00:14:51,"And there's this idea that if you're made redundant,"
00:14:51,00:14:53,you can bring someone along with you to the meeting
00:14:53,00:14:55,so that you have a bit of support.
00:14:55,00:14:57,"And I can see you clapping, Alf."
00:14:57,00:14:59,I have a feeling you might know this person as well.
00:14:59,00:15:00,- I do know this.
00:15:00,00:15:02,"- A comedian called Joshua Jack,"
00:15:02,00:15:04,whose real name is Josh Thompson.
00:15:04,00:15:06,Josh Thompson hired a clown to come with him
00:15:06,00:15:08,for this resundancy meeting.
00:15:08,00:15:10,"And while the person was saying,"
00:15:10,00:15:11,"we think, you know, unfortunately,"
00:15:11,00:15:12,we're gonna have to let you go.
00:15:12,00:15:13,"The clowns are going,"
00:15:13,00:15:16,"""Oh boo-hoo,"" and, you know, doing all the clowny stuff."
00:15:16,00:15:17,"Anyway, we're in Australia"
00:15:17,00:15:20,"and we have a drink post Melbourne show with Ray O'Leary,"
00:15:20,00:15:23,who is part of these Edinburgh showcase shows
00:15:23,00:15:24,that we're doing with fish.
00:15:24,00:15:27,"And he says, ""This is my friend, his name's Josh Thompson."
00:15:27,00:15:29,He was the guy who hired the clown.
00:15:29,00:15:32,We got pissed with the man who was a fact
00:15:32,00:15:34,"on no such thing as a fish, our greatest strings."""
00:15:34,00:15:36,- Yeah.
00:15:36,00:15:38,"Hey, by the way, I found a clown school"
00:15:38,00:15:41,where no one who has left that school
00:15:41,00:15:44,as far as I can tell has gone on to become a clown.
00:15:44,00:15:48,So it turns out there's a town in the UK called Clown.
00:15:48,00:15:50,C-L-O-W-N-E.
00:15:50,00:15:54,"And Clown Junior High is a school, right?"
00:15:54,00:15:55,And I searched so hard.
00:15:55,00:15:57,I couldn't find any clowns who live in Clown.
00:15:57,00:16:00,"They have a population of 7,000,"
00:16:00,00:16:03,"except I found one guy whose name is Chris Carter,"
00:16:03,00:16:06,who started filming a bunch of horror movies
00:16:06,00:16:08,where he dresses as a clown.
00:16:08,00:16:09,And walks the streets.
00:16:09,00:16:13,But he got caught up as a clown in Clown
00:16:13,00:16:15,by the 2016 Clown Fear.
00:16:15,00:16:17,And he had to tell police
00:16:17,00:16:19,"anytime he was going out in his clown gear,"
00:16:19,00:16:21,otherwise he was gonna be arrested.
00:16:21,00:16:24,"- No, was that the policy and the police?"
00:16:24,00:16:26,Every time you put a red nose on?
00:16:26,00:16:27,"- Well, it was just that month, as you say,"
00:16:27,00:16:29,that crazy month.
00:16:29,00:16:29,- Yeah.
00:16:29,00:16:32,- It made it all the way to the UK town of Clown.
00:16:32,00:16:33,- It was so ridiculous.
00:16:33,00:16:35,'Cause I think it was confected by journalists
00:16:35,00:16:38,"mostly surely, 'cause people aren't that insane."
00:16:38,00:16:40,But it did affect things then.
00:16:40,00:16:41,There was a Clown Lives Matter march
00:16:41,00:16:43,that had to be canceled.
00:16:43,00:16:46,"So, no wonder no one takes it."
00:16:46,00:16:47,Seriously.
00:16:47,00:16:49,- I can't get over the headline.
00:16:49,00:16:52,Clown's complaining they're not being taken seriously.
00:16:52,00:16:54,It's just wonderful.
00:16:54,00:16:55,- Why are you necking?
00:16:55,00:16:57,"I, when I was a teacher and we did World Book Day"
00:16:57,00:16:59,and all the teachers had to dress up
00:16:59,00:17:03,and I full on dressed up as Pennywise the Clown.
00:17:03,00:17:04,It was the one day.
00:17:04,00:17:06,I had no issues with discipline.
00:17:06,00:17:10,Those kids behaved themselves.
00:17:10,00:17:12,"I got latex, I got some fake blood."
00:17:12,00:17:15,I reenacted the shining as an immersive film experience
00:17:15,00:17:16,in the classroom.
00:17:16,00:17:18,We went to town that day.
00:17:18,00:17:20,And I'm no longer a teacher
00:17:20,00:17:22,'cause the children thought that 'cause I was too scared.
00:17:22,00:17:25,- We do need to wrap up.
00:17:25,00:17:28,"So, Elf, you're gonna be up at the fringe doing"
00:17:28,00:17:31,"quite a sort of exciting three shows, right?"
00:17:31,00:17:32,- Yeah.
00:17:32,00:17:35,"I'm redoing all, I'm doing my bird trilogy."
00:17:35,00:17:38,"So I'm doing Swan, which is a one woman production"
00:17:38,00:17:41,of Swan Lake in an hour in French-ish.
00:17:41,00:17:44,"And then Chiff Chaff, which is a one woman musical"
00:17:44,00:17:45,about the economy.
00:17:45,00:17:48,"And then Raven, which is my one woman reenactment"
00:17:48,00:17:50,of all Stephen King's books.
00:17:50,00:17:53,"And they're all Clown, Mime, Buffon shows"
00:17:53,00:17:56,that make my agent's job of getting me on television
00:17:56,00:17:58,so difficult.
00:17:58,00:18:01,"She's like, please just do a straight standup show."
00:18:01,00:18:03,"And then I was like, I'm gonna make a show"
00:18:03,00:18:04,where I pretend to be a horse.
00:18:04,00:18:06,"And she's just started crying, going,"
00:18:06,00:18:08,I want to earn enough money to buy a house.
00:18:08,00:18:11,Please just do something relatable
00:18:11,00:18:13,so I can pitch you to Taskmaster.
00:18:13,00:18:14,"- Where are you gonna be, Elf?"
00:18:14,00:18:15,Where you playing?
00:18:15,00:18:19,- I'm playing in the King Dome at the Pleasants
00:18:19,00:18:21,for the final two weeks of the fringe.
00:18:21,00:18:24,"So Swan one day, Chiff after next, Raven the day after."
00:18:24,00:18:26,So you can go and see all three in a row
00:18:26,00:18:29,and just see just how mad I am.
00:18:29,00:18:31,(upbeat music)
00:18:31,00:18:39,"- Okay, it is time for fact number two."
00:18:39,00:18:41,And that is Ray O'Leary.
00:18:41,00:18:43,"- And my fact is, in the 1820s,"
00:18:43,00:18:48,philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer hated his contemporary Hagel
00:18:48,00:18:50,so much he intentionally scheduled his lectures
00:18:50,00:18:54,at the same time as Hagel's and had zero people attend.
00:18:54,00:18:58,- What a backfire.
00:18:58,00:18:59,It's terrible backfire.
00:18:59,00:19:03,"Yeah, so apparently this was at the University of Berlin"
00:19:03,00:19:06,"and Schopenhauer, he taught a few semesters there."
00:19:06,00:19:09,And apparently he never had more than five students
00:19:09,00:19:11,sign up to attend.
00:19:11,00:19:14,"Meanwhile, I think Hagel was getting in the hundreds"
00:19:14,00:19:16,because at the time he was the chair of philosophy
00:19:16,00:19:19,at the University of Berlin.
00:19:19,00:19:22,So he was sort of like the Taylor Swift
00:19:22,00:19:25,of German philosophical idealism.
00:19:25,00:19:26,So it was naturally.
00:19:26,00:19:30,I actually call Taylor Swift the Hagel of pop music.
00:19:30,00:19:32,(laughing)
00:19:32,00:19:34,"So do you know a lot about philosophy, Ray,"
00:19:34,00:19:38,because these are pretty new names to me
00:19:38,00:19:40,and probably a lot of people listening.
00:19:40,00:19:43,"- Yes, I do know a bit about philosophy."
00:19:43,00:19:45,"Interestingly, this is not the area of philosophy"
00:19:45,00:19:48,"I know the most about, but I was always drawn"
00:19:48,00:19:50,to Arthur Schopenhauer 'cause he was sort of
00:19:50,00:19:52,just such a miserable man.
00:19:52,00:19:55,"He was just sort of quite a cantankerous,"
00:19:55,00:19:56,horrible old man.
00:19:56,00:19:58,That was so interesting to me.
00:19:58,00:19:59,"The more you read about him, the more you're like,"
00:19:59,00:20:02,"""Oh, there's almost nothing redeemable about him"
00:20:02,00:20:02,"as a person."""
00:20:02,00:20:04,"- Sorry, can I just stop you there, Ray?"
00:20:04,00:20:06,"Because before we came on mic,"
00:20:06,00:20:08,I was saying how much Andy reminds me of him.
00:20:08,00:20:12,"- Okay, okay, I like to think of myself"
00:20:12,00:20:15,"as a cantankerous, miserable young man, all right?"
00:20:15,00:20:16,"- Also, I think he's quite a nice man."
00:20:16,00:20:19,"Actually, he's quite handsome now that I think about it."
00:20:19,00:20:21,"- Yeah, yeah, thank you very much, Ray."
00:20:21,00:20:24,"But this story, it's from a time when Hagel"
00:20:24,00:20:27,was the most famous philosopher in the German-speaking world.
00:20:27,00:20:30,And Schopenhauer was just some punk kid.
00:20:30,00:20:32,"You know, he was in his 20s, I think,"
00:20:32,00:20:34,"or maybe, no, maybe early 30s, but he was young."
00:20:34,00:20:37,And it was him who wanted the rivalry.
00:20:37,00:20:40,"Like, Hagel made no reference ever in his life"
00:20:40,00:20:41,to Schopenhauer.
00:20:41,00:20:43,Schopenhauer is constantly writing about
00:20:43,00:20:44,how much he hates Hagel.
00:20:44,00:20:46,"And it was all about his main work,"
00:20:46,00:20:48,the world as Will and representation.
00:20:48,00:20:49,It was about his magnum opus.
00:20:49,00:20:52,"- Yeah, it's so-- - And no one, no one cares."
00:20:52,00:20:55,"When you read about him on page, to me,"
00:20:55,00:20:58,it's like reading a biography of Larry David.
00:20:58,00:21:00,"Like, he tries all these little schemes."
00:21:00,00:21:03,"And I wonder if maybe in real life, it was funnier."
00:21:03,00:21:06,"'Cause if you read Curb Your Enthusiasm on page,"
00:21:06,00:21:07,that's not funny.
00:21:07,00:21:10,"That's a contankerous, horrible, repulsive man, right?"
00:21:10,00:21:12,"But in real life, he's amazing."
00:21:12,00:21:15,"He largely drew his philosophy from Eastern religion, right?"
00:21:15,00:21:17,"Like, so Buddhism and so on."
00:21:17,00:21:19,"And so in his apartment in Frankfurt,"
00:21:19,00:21:22,he had a large black lacquered bronze statue
00:21:22,00:21:24,of the Buddha sitting there.
00:21:24,00:21:27,And he told a friend that he positioned it
00:21:27,00:21:28,"so that every morning,"
00:21:28,00:21:30,"when the morning sun came through the window,"
00:21:30,00:21:34,it would bounce off it and put an annoying beam of light
00:21:34,00:21:36,"into the apartment across from him,"
00:21:36,00:21:38,"which belonged to a pastor who he didn't like,"
00:21:38,00:21:41,just so it would piss him off every day.
00:21:41,00:21:42,That's Larry David.
00:21:42,00:21:44,"- Really, you wouldn't wanna live next star"
00:21:44,00:21:46,"to Schopenhauer, would you?"
00:21:46,00:21:48,One of the things he hated was noise.
00:21:48,00:21:51,"You can imagine, if you had a little party,"
00:21:51,00:21:53,"even if you finished it by 9 p.m.,"
00:21:53,00:21:55,he'd be round banging on the door.
00:21:55,00:21:56,"- Yeah, do you know what?"
00:21:56,00:21:57,People need their sleep.
00:21:57,00:21:58,Some people go to bed nice and early.
00:21:58,00:21:59,"- You know what, Andy?"
00:21:59,00:22:02,I know that you don't like loud noise very much
00:22:02,00:22:03,and loud music and stuff.
00:22:03,00:22:04,"Schopenhauer once said,"
00:22:04,00:22:07,"""The amount of noise which anyone can bear undisturbed"
00:22:07,00:22:11,"""stands in inverse proportion to his mental capacity."""
00:22:11,00:22:15,"- That makes me the cleverest man alive, I think."
00:22:15,00:22:17,If I've understood it.
00:22:17,00:22:19,"- I've never been round to Andy's place,"
00:22:19,00:22:22,but I'm imagining that sort of a series of statues
00:22:22,00:22:25,carefully positioned so the sun ricochets around
00:22:25,00:22:27,until it hits all the enemy's eye.
00:22:27,00:22:29,(laughing)
00:22:29,00:22:31,"- But he's clearly unbelievably,"
00:22:31,00:22:33,"reading about actually both of these guys,"
00:22:33,00:22:34,"Hegel and Schopenhauer,"
00:22:34,00:22:36,you just think these people are so unbelievably clever.
00:22:36,00:22:41,And the beef was kind of because Hegel's view of the world
00:22:41,00:22:43,was that humanity had arrived
00:22:43,00:22:45,at the age of self-consciousness.
00:22:45,00:22:47,"He had this big lecture about the world history,"
00:22:47,00:22:50,which he claimed that Europe is the absolute end of history.
00:22:50,00:22:53,The spirit of the world was the zeitgeist in it.
00:22:53,00:22:55,It was reaching its perfect final form.
00:22:55,00:22:56,Everything was getting better.
00:22:56,00:22:58,And Schopenhauer rejected that.
00:22:58,00:23:00,"Hegel was basically, ""Things can only get better."""
00:23:00,00:23:02,"And Schopenhauer said, ""We're not becoming anything."
00:23:02,00:23:04,"""We remain the same."
00:23:04,00:23:06,"""We go in these big historical cycles."""
00:23:06,00:23:08,"- It was, I mean, really basically,"
00:23:08,00:23:10,"it's like optimism versus pessimism, wasn't it?"
00:23:10,00:23:14,Hegel was very much sunlight and rainbows and unicorns
00:23:14,00:23:18,"and Schopenhauer was, ""I fucking hate unicorns."""
00:23:18,00:23:19,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:23:19,00:23:20,"Which team are you on, Ray?"
00:23:20,00:23:23,"If you had the option of those two lectures,"
00:23:23,00:23:25,"you know, your time traveled back to there."
00:23:25,00:23:29,"- I think my inkling is to go towards Schopenhauer,"
00:23:29,00:23:31,but I really would not want him
00:23:31,00:23:33,to have somebody at his lecture.
00:23:33,00:23:34,"I think then, I don't,"
00:23:34,00:23:37,I basically want to preserve his loser status.
00:23:37,00:23:40,I think it would corrupt his whole legacy
00:23:40,00:23:42,if people were actually paying attention to him at the time.
00:23:42,00:23:46,- I think Hegel's lectures were not the most fun.
00:23:46,00:23:49,I think he was very difficult to understand.
00:23:49,00:23:52,His students said that every third sentence
00:23:52,00:23:55,"he said began with ""therefore."""
00:23:55,00:23:58,"So you can imagine this sort of German lecturer going,"
00:23:58,00:24:01,"""Therefore, therefore, therefore."""
00:24:01,00:24:02,"- Yes, I was gonna say,"
00:24:02,00:24:04,I think one of the reasons Schopenhauer hated Hegel
00:24:04,00:24:06,was for his dense way of writing
00:24:06,00:24:09,and he was obscure and hard to understand.
00:24:09,00:24:11,"I don't want to take sides in the dispute,"
00:24:11,00:24:14,but I did find there's a famous explainer
00:24:14,00:24:17,"of one of Hegel's most prominent works,"
00:24:17,00:24:21,and it's over three times longer than Hegel's actual work.
00:24:21,00:24:22,So...
00:24:22,00:24:26,"- Hey, Ray Watts, you said at the start"
00:24:26,00:24:29,that this isn't what you know most about in philosophy.
00:24:29,00:24:30,What's your era?
00:24:30,00:24:31,Who's your philosopher?
00:24:31,00:24:34,"- Well, my favorite was actually Manuel Kantz,"
00:24:34,00:24:37,"who was the one that inspired both Hegel and Schopenhauer,"
00:24:37,00:24:38,but they took him in different directions.
00:24:38,00:24:43,And then what my thesis ended up being about was free will.
00:24:43,00:24:45,That was the main thing I ended up writing about.
00:24:45,00:24:47,- The movie about the whale?
00:24:47,00:24:48,- Mm.
00:24:48,00:24:50,- What a pivot.
00:24:50,00:24:53,"- Sadly, I wrote the sequel."
00:24:53,00:24:58,There was my was free will to the much less popular
00:24:58,00:25:01,straight to DVD philosophical thesis.
00:25:01,00:25:03,"- The whale can escape,"
00:25:03,00:25:05,but will he ever truly be free?
00:25:05,00:25:07,- Do I have free will always?
00:25:07,00:25:09,- Do I force to make that terrible joke?
00:25:09,00:25:14,- I think knowing you as entirely within your genes
00:25:14,00:25:16,"and environment that you were compelled,"
00:25:16,00:25:18,there was no choice for you.
00:25:18,00:25:24,"- We've not mentioned one big part of Schopenhauer's studies,"
00:25:24,00:25:28,which is the time he became a paranormal investigator.
00:25:28,00:25:29,"- Oh, here we go."
00:25:29,00:25:32,"- It's a surprisingly big bit of his life,"
00:25:32,00:25:33,"and he wrote about it quite a lot,"
00:25:33,00:25:36,which is that he had a very weird moment
00:25:36,00:25:38,where he woke up one morning
00:25:38,00:25:41,and he saw his mom and dad standing in front of him
00:25:41,00:25:43,as an apparition.
00:25:43,00:25:44,"So his dad was dead,"
00:25:44,00:25:46,"bit weirder 'cause his mom was still alive,"
00:25:46,00:25:48,"so not sure what she was doing there, but."
00:25:48,00:25:50,- His mom was just over for a visit.
00:25:50,00:25:52,I thought the most terrible thing
00:25:52,00:25:54,I've ever heard before in my life.
00:25:54,00:25:55,"- Yeah, and so he sort of thought,"
00:25:55,00:25:56,I wonder what that is.
00:25:56,00:25:59,And he was working as a large part of his work
00:25:59,00:26:01,that metaphysics would explain
00:26:01,00:26:03,why people were seeing weird things.
00:26:03,00:26:05,"He didn't properly believe in ghosts himself,"
00:26:05,00:26:07,"but he did think all of these experiences,"
00:26:07,00:26:10,"telepathy, all that stuff, premonitions,"
00:26:10,00:26:12,something might be tied in.
00:26:12,00:26:15,So it made it part of his philosophical investigations.
00:26:15,00:26:16,- How cool. - It's got to be a nightmare
00:26:16,00:26:18,"if you hate other human beings,"
00:26:18,00:26:21,and then you start getting visited by ghosts as well.
00:26:21,00:26:22,You're either--
00:26:22,00:26:23,(all laughing)
00:26:23,00:26:25,- This is exactly what I didn't want.
00:26:25,00:26:28,He was really interested in sacred Hindu texts as well.
00:26:28,00:26:32,That was a big part of his life and his philosophy.
00:26:32,00:26:34,"So all of his poodles,"
00:26:34,00:26:36,he was a big poodle fancier.
00:26:36,00:26:38,"All of his poodles were called atman,"
00:26:38,00:26:41,"which is the Sanskrit word, meaning your true self."
00:26:41,00:26:43,- Why would you call all your dogs the same name?
00:26:43,00:26:44,That doesn't make any sense.
00:26:44,00:26:47,"- It means you only have one thing to shout in the park,"
00:26:47,00:26:49,"and then all the dogs will come back, you know."
00:26:49,00:26:50,"- Okay, I see that. - He's ingenious."
00:26:50,00:26:52,"See, he was the cleverest man in life."
00:26:52,00:26:56,"And his bedtime reading every night was a few pages of,"
00:26:56,00:26:57,"this is when I thought,"
00:26:57,00:26:59,"okay, this guy's a cut above intellectually."
00:26:59,00:27:03,"It was the Latin translation of the Upanishads,"
00:27:03,00:27:04,"the sacred Hindu text, the Upanishads."
00:27:04,00:27:06,It was the Latin translation of that.
00:27:06,00:27:07,"Every night before going to bed,"
00:27:07,00:27:09,he would just read a few pages
00:27:09,00:27:10,to help himself drift off to sleep.
00:27:10,00:27:13,"And he said, ""It has been the consolation of my life"
00:27:13,00:27:15,"and will be that of my death."""
00:27:15,00:27:20,"You know, he was just an extremely polymathic guy effectively."
00:27:20,00:27:22,"- Well, that was someone said in writing"
00:27:22,00:27:25,about his understanding of the Upanishads
00:27:25,00:27:29,and general Hindu philosophy is that he was reading
00:27:29,00:27:31,these sort of put together Latin translations
00:27:31,00:27:34,"that lost a lot about it, a mistranslation almost,"
00:27:34,00:27:35,"not quite a mistranslation,"
00:27:35,00:27:37,but one step away from the meanings
00:27:37,00:27:40,that were properly captured in the original writings.
00:27:40,00:27:41,- That's really interesting.
00:27:41,00:27:44,- It just suited what he was trying to build.
00:27:44,00:27:47,"- That's quite similar to Zen Buddhism in the West,"
00:27:47,00:27:50,"which was, it came over when a guy went over to Japan"
00:27:50,00:27:52,and he spent a lot of time
00:27:52,00:27:54,with this really famous Zen Buddhist.
00:27:54,00:27:56,And he didn't speak Japanese
00:27:56,00:27:57,and the Buddhist didn't speak any English.
00:27:57,00:28:00,And so they went through a translator.
00:28:00,00:28:02,And the translator just basically told him
00:28:02,00:28:04,what he wanted to hear.
00:28:04,00:28:07,'Cause the Zen Buddhist guy was quite old by that stage.
00:28:07,00:28:08,He was repeating himself.
00:28:08,00:28:10,He was talking quite a lot of nonsense.
00:28:10,00:28:13,"And then this guy would say, ""Oh yeah, what he's saying"
00:28:13,00:28:16,is that you need to become one with the world
00:28:16,00:28:17,"and whatever."""
00:28:17,00:28:19,But actually never said any of that stuff.
00:28:19,00:28:21,- Give all your dogs one name.
00:28:21,00:28:22,Give them all one name.
00:28:22,00:28:25,(all laughing)
00:28:25,00:28:28,"- Schopenhauer, he wrote about the feeling"
00:28:28,00:28:30,that people had after sex.
00:28:30,00:28:30,- Oh.
00:28:30,00:28:33,"- He wrote that directly after copulation,"
00:28:33,00:28:35,the devil's laughter is heard.
00:28:35,00:28:39,"- Oh, who's been laughing this whole time?"
00:28:39,00:28:40,I was just wondering.
00:28:40,00:28:42,(all laughing)
00:28:42,00:28:45,"- It's always better that it's the devil laughing,"
00:28:45,00:28:46,"really, isn't it?"
00:28:46,00:28:48,(all laughing)
00:28:48,00:28:50,"- So this all comes back to Galen,"
00:28:50,00:28:54,the famous guy who wrote about medicine and stuff.
00:28:54,00:28:57,"He wrote that every animal is sad after colitis,"
00:28:57,00:29:00,except the human female and the rooster.
00:29:00,00:29:02,"- You know, we don't pitch the Schopenhauer fact,"
00:29:02,00:29:04,this is not where I originally would be.
00:29:04,00:29:07,(all laughing)
00:29:07,00:29:12,- We should say A-Shops was a massive sexist.
00:29:12,00:29:14,"I mean, I was reading his work and I was thinking,"
00:29:14,00:29:16,"""Yeah, I'm jamming with this guy."""
00:29:16,00:29:19,And then I read his views on women.
00:29:19,00:29:21,"""They are big children all their life long"
00:29:21,00:29:23,"and undersized, narrow-shouldered, broad-hipped"
00:29:23,00:29:25,and short-legged race.
00:29:25,00:29:26,They have no proper knowledge of anything
00:29:26,00:29:28,"and they have no genius."""
00:29:28,00:29:30,"And I thought, ""I'm gonna back off, okay."""
00:29:30,00:29:30,- Yeah.
00:29:30,00:29:33,- So did you say that he said women are bigger children?
00:29:33,00:29:35,"Because, I mean, so are men."
00:29:35,00:29:37,"That's what being an adult is, isn't it?"
00:29:37,00:29:38,(all laughing)
00:29:38,00:29:41,He's been a bigger child.
00:29:41,00:29:45,He was very dedicated to slagging off the other philosophers.
00:29:45,00:29:50,He once wrote an essay that was awarded first prize
00:29:50,00:29:53,in a competition by the Royal Norwegian Society
00:29:53,00:29:55,of Sciences and Letters.
00:29:55,00:29:58,"And so then next year, he submitted another essay"
00:29:58,00:30:01,"and this essay did not win the awards,"
00:30:01,00:30:04,even though it was the sole submission.
00:30:04,00:30:08,(all laughing)
00:30:08,00:30:10,And the reason it was rejected is a part
00:30:10,00:30:14,because he kept disrespecting other philosophers.
00:30:14,00:30:17,"And I think to be fair, if you are writing an essay"
00:30:17,00:30:18,"on morality, you probably should have"
00:30:18,00:30:20,been slagging off the other philosophers.
00:30:20,00:30:22,"- Yeah, that's so funny."
00:30:22,00:30:25,"That's like, there was a study that was done"
00:30:25,00:30:28,amongst UK scientists and one of the findings at the end
00:30:28,00:30:33,was that most scientists don't like Richard Dawkins.
00:30:33,00:30:36,But what they were being asked about had nothing to do
00:30:36,00:30:37,with Richard Dawkins.
00:30:37,00:30:39,That just came up as everyone slagging him off
00:30:39,00:30:40,as part of their response.
00:30:40,00:30:43,"And they were like, ""Well, here's an unintended bit"
00:30:43,00:30:44,"of data that we've discovered."""
00:30:44,00:30:45,(all laughing)
00:30:45,00:30:46,"Yeah, yeah, he did."
00:30:46,00:30:47,"He slag even in his books, right?"
00:30:47,00:30:50,"Even in his main, that main one."
00:30:50,00:30:51,"What was it called, by the way?"
00:30:51,00:30:52,- The Will.
00:30:52,00:30:53,- The World as Will and Representation.
00:30:53,00:30:55,"- Yeah, even in the main one,"
00:30:55,00:30:57,the Will is World and Representation.
00:30:57,00:30:58,"Will is, say it again."
00:30:58,00:31:01,- The World as Will and Representation.
00:31:01,00:31:02,"It's not, actually, it did not take off."
00:31:02,00:31:04,Part of the reason it didn't take off
00:31:04,00:31:06,was he didn't call it big things.
00:31:06,00:31:10,- I just love the idea of Dad going to a year of lectures
00:31:10,00:31:13,and still can't get the title of his work.
00:31:13,00:31:14,- Any questions?
00:31:14,00:31:15,"Yes, Dan, again."
00:31:15,00:31:20,"No, it's the World as Will and Representation."
00:31:20,00:31:23,"- Okay, so where there's a world,"
00:31:23,00:31:25,there's a will of representation.
00:31:25,00:31:26,"- Where there's a world, there's a way."
00:31:26,00:31:27,That would have been better.
00:31:27,00:31:29,That would have been better.
00:31:29,00:31:30,- I imagine if I was the time traveler
00:31:30,00:31:33,"that went back and sat, it was like sitting on the ground."
00:31:33,00:31:34,- So what?
00:31:34,00:31:36,- What does he think of me in the year 2025?
00:31:36,00:31:37,- We love your work.
00:31:37,00:31:39,"Where will he, for you, will he?"
00:31:39,00:31:41,(all laughing)
00:31:41,00:31:45,"- We need to wrap up in a sec,"
00:31:45,00:31:47,"but Ray, you're going to be in Edinburgh."
00:31:47,00:31:48,This is very exciting.
00:31:48,00:31:49,"You're coming across the ocean,"
00:31:49,00:31:50,halfway across the world.
00:31:50,00:31:51,Where are you going to be playing?
00:31:51,00:31:52,What's the show?
00:31:52,00:31:55,"- Yes, I'm going to be at the Pleasants Courtyard"
00:31:55,00:31:59,"at 6.05 p.m. every day, except for one Monday."
00:31:59,00:32:00,I forget which one.
00:32:00,00:32:02,So hopefully that's not the only day
00:32:02,00:32:05,I'm currently in Edinburgh for the entire Fringe Festival.
00:32:05,00:32:09,And the show's called Laughter I Hardly Knower.
00:32:09,00:32:10,"So yeah, please come along."
00:32:10,00:32:13,(all laughing)
00:32:13,00:32:15,- Really a title.
00:32:15,00:32:17,(upbeat music)
00:32:18,00:32:20,"- Okay, it's time for fact number three,"
00:32:20,00:32:23,and that is Andrew O'Neill.
00:32:23,00:32:27,- My fact is that the first band to call themselves punk
00:32:27,00:32:28,didn't use guitars.
00:32:28,00:32:29,- What?
00:32:29,00:32:34,"- Which is counter-intuitive because we think of,"
00:32:34,00:32:36,"you know, biker jackets, spiky hair, guitars,"
00:32:36,00:32:38,but the first bands to actually call themselves punk
00:32:38,00:32:39,were Suicide.
00:32:39,00:32:43,So Suicide were a kind of art noise duo in New York.
00:32:43,00:32:45,Martin Revere and Alan Vaid.
00:32:45,00:32:48,And they used synths and drum machines
00:32:48,00:32:52,"and created a wonderful sort of sleazy,"
00:32:52,00:32:56,"uncomfortable, aggressive noise."
00:32:56,00:32:59,So I'm constantly fascinated with the history
00:32:59,00:33:02,and the kind of taxonomy of music.
00:33:02,00:33:04,"So with punk, punk was used as an insult."
00:33:04,00:33:06,"You know, it was seen as putting them down"
00:33:06,00:33:09,and then Suicide were the first band to kind of lean into it.
00:33:09,00:33:11,But punk in its origins was so much wider
00:33:11,00:33:15,as a genre and so much more experimental
00:33:15,00:33:19,and kind of arty than the dudes with loud guitars.
00:33:19,00:33:20,"- Yeah, right."
00:33:20,00:33:22,I read an interview with these guys from Suicide
00:33:22,00:33:25,and they said that they did have a guitar at the very start
00:33:25,00:33:26,before they became Suicide
00:33:26,00:33:28,when they were just sort of starting out.
00:33:28,00:33:29,- Right.
00:33:29,00:33:30,- But the guitar player decided to leave
00:33:30,00:33:32,and they realized that actually he wasn't really
00:33:32,00:33:33,contributing very much anyway.
00:33:33,00:33:35,So that's why they did without him.
00:33:35,00:33:38,"- I listened to the album this morning,"
00:33:38,00:33:39,their debut album in New York.
00:33:39,00:33:43,"The album this morning, their debut album in 1977."
00:33:43,00:33:47,And it's noise and it's interesting
00:33:47,00:33:49,and it's wild lyrically.
00:33:49,00:33:53,"There's an amazing song which is called ""Frankie Teardrop"""
00:33:53,00:33:56,and it's a song that's been cited by quite a lot of people
00:33:56,00:33:57,as an influential song.
00:33:57,00:33:59,"So Nick Hornby wrote a book called ""31 Songs"""
00:33:59,00:34:02,where he picked 31 songs that have altered his life
00:34:02,00:34:04,in some ways and he says it's a song
00:34:04,00:34:05,that you should only hear once
00:34:05,00:34:07,'cause it's just too intense.
00:34:07,00:34:08,And it is really intense.
00:34:08,00:34:10,"It's a story of a guy who goes home,"
00:34:10,00:34:12,he kills his family and then you follow his own death
00:34:12,00:34:14,and then his journey into hell.
00:34:14,00:34:16,And it's just this soundscape of noise.
00:34:16,00:34:19,And it's horrific but hugely influential.
00:34:19,00:34:22,"""Springsteen"" was influenced by this."
00:34:22,00:34:25,"Yeah, like a lot of people were influenced by suicide"
00:34:25,00:34:26,that you would not expect.
00:34:26,00:34:28,"- Actually, I don't prove ""Springsteen"" songs"
00:34:28,00:34:31,like a lot more depressing than people make out.
00:34:31,00:34:33,"Like ""Born in the USA"" is about someone"
00:34:33,00:34:36,being really disheartened about America after the war.
00:34:36,00:34:37,- Oh yeah.
00:34:37,00:34:40,"Yeah, a lot of his songs are about rough living"
00:34:40,00:34:43,and suffering and a very downbeat in their meaning.
00:34:43,00:34:45,But if the music doesn't sound like that.
00:34:45,00:34:49,"- Isn't it true that a lot of politicians use ""Born in the USA"""
00:34:49,00:34:51,as like their big sort of America fuck yeah kind of thing?
00:34:51,00:34:54,- Nationalistic flag waving kind of thing.
00:34:54,00:34:57,"It's exactly the opposite of that, which is true."
00:34:57,00:34:58,Isn't it pretty much any artist
00:34:58,00:35:00,"that gets co-opted by a politician will go,"
00:35:00,00:35:04,you've not really paid attention to the lyrics.
00:35:04,00:35:05,"- Andrew, you're doing a whole show"
00:35:05,00:35:06,about the history of punk.
00:35:06,00:35:07,So is this your opinion
00:35:07,00:35:09,that they're sort of the first punk band?
00:35:09,00:35:11,Or is that agreed?
00:35:11,00:35:13,"- Not that they're the first punk band,"
00:35:13,00:35:15,but they're the first band to call themselves punk.
00:35:15,00:35:16,- Right.
00:35:16,00:35:17,"- Because there's a thing that happens, isn't there,"
00:35:17,00:35:20,"with sort of genres where before a genre gets named,"
00:35:20,00:35:22,it can be quite amorphous.
00:35:22,00:35:25,The meaning isn't kind of ossified yet.
00:35:25,00:35:28,"So I would argue the first punk band was the Stooges,"
00:35:28,00:35:29,Iggy Pop and the Stooges.
00:35:29,00:35:30,- Okay.
00:35:30,00:35:34,"- Do you find, Andrew, that when people get put"
00:35:34,00:35:35,"into those categories,"
00:35:35,00:35:38,then they start sort of living up towards it.
00:35:38,00:35:39,- Absolutely right.
00:35:39,00:35:41,"- So if people call you a death metal band,"
00:35:41,00:35:42,then your next three albums
00:35:42,00:35:44,are just going to be heavier and heavier.
00:35:44,00:35:45,- That's absolutely it.
00:35:45,00:35:48,And also there's a thing where people start to form bands
00:35:48,00:35:49,based on the tax on it.
00:35:49,00:35:52,So basically the map becomes the territory.
00:35:52,00:35:53,"So you put a thing out saying,"
00:35:53,00:35:55,I want to form a thrash band.
00:35:55,00:35:57,You kind of already know what that's going to sound like.
00:35:57,00:35:59,"- That suicide album, the 1977 one,"
00:35:59,00:36:03,"was described as taxi driver, the musical."
00:36:03,00:36:04,"- Yeah, I think it is."
00:36:04,00:36:06,Which I think suits it quite nicely.
00:36:06,00:36:09,- And they toured with the Clash.
00:36:09,00:36:10,- Right.
00:36:10,00:36:13,- And Clash fans universally hated them
00:36:13,00:36:16,because they wanted a band that sounded like the Clash.
00:36:16,00:36:18,And they got a band that sounded like
00:36:18,00:36:21,"stoned, speed freak Elvis,"
00:36:21,00:36:24,playing over horrible keyboards and drum machine.
00:36:24,00:36:27,"- Do you know on the Clash,"
00:36:27,00:36:30,"so Mick Jones as founder of Clash, I think,"
00:36:30,00:36:33,and was league guitarist and his first cousin.
00:36:33,00:36:35,Do you know who his first cousin is?
00:36:35,00:36:39,"- Oh, not Davy Jones from Tom Jones."
00:36:39,00:36:40,"- It's not a Jones, sorry."
00:36:40,00:36:41,I fled you up the garden path.
00:36:41,00:36:43,- It's a tough one to guess.
00:36:43,00:36:44,- It's a really tough one to guess.
00:36:44,00:36:46,"Basically what I'm telling you is the Clash are,"
00:36:46,00:36:48,"you know, punk, very, very cool."
00:36:48,00:36:50,"This guy, not cool."
00:36:50,00:36:51,"Look, shall I tell you?"
00:36:51,00:36:52,- Is it Jacob Rees-Mogg?
00:36:52,00:36:54,- You're so close.
00:36:54,00:36:54,"Oh my God, Dan."
00:36:54,00:36:56,You're in the right political party.
00:36:56,00:36:57,You're in the right era.
00:36:57,00:36:59,"- Oh, is it David Davis?"
00:36:59,00:37:00,- You're close.
00:37:00,00:37:01,- Grant Shaps.
00:37:01,00:37:02,- Grant Shaps.
00:37:02,00:37:06,- Grant Shaps is first cousins with the Clash.
00:37:06,00:37:09,- Grant Shaps was used by Alan Partridge
00:37:09,00:37:11,"to denote someone that's absolutely,"
00:37:11,00:37:13,totally middle of the road page.
00:37:13,00:37:14,"- Exactly, I'm afraid."
00:37:14,00:37:17,"And in fact, his brother is called Andre,"
00:37:17,00:37:19,and he's in a band called Big Audio Dynamite
00:37:19,00:37:22,"with Mick Jones, who's, you know, Clash guy."
00:37:22,00:37:23,- Still going.
00:37:23,00:37:24,- So there you go.
00:37:24,00:37:24,"Cooler than you thought, Grant Shaps."
00:37:24,00:37:26,"- Cooler, yeah, that's amazing."
00:37:26,00:37:28,- As if that could be possible.
00:37:28,00:37:29,- I know.
00:37:29,00:37:31,"- It's strange, isn't it?"
00:37:31,00:37:34,"Because, you know, there's that thing of like,"
00:37:34,00:37:35,so many people in there.
00:37:35,00:37:37,So Joe Strummer went to private school.
00:37:37,00:37:41,"Like, the idea that someone who went to,"
00:37:41,00:37:44,like actually a public school could be in a punk band.
00:37:44,00:37:45,"In the 80s would have been incredible,"
00:37:45,00:37:47,"but it was absolutely what happened,"
00:37:47,00:37:49,that kind of flourishing of bringing people together.
00:37:49,00:37:51,"I mean, the Bromley contingents,"
00:37:51,00:37:53,so Suzie Sue and others.
00:37:53,00:37:56,"Yeah, they were very definitely suburban middle class."
00:37:56,00:38:00,It wasn't sort of street based as it kind of came to be seen.
00:38:00,00:38:02,There are so many contradictions in it.
00:38:02,00:38:05,"Like, I mean, the young ones, the most punk TV show,"
00:38:05,00:38:07,nearly everybody involved in that is privately educated.
00:38:07,00:38:08,"- Yeah, they absolutely are, aren't they?"
00:38:08,00:38:10,"- Yeah, you're so true."
00:38:10,00:38:11,"When you sent over this fact,"
00:38:11,00:38:13,I started looking into guitars.
00:38:13,00:38:19,I realized I didn't know much about the history of guitars.
00:38:19,00:38:21,"And one thing that I got really excited by was,"
00:38:21,00:38:23,"in the early days, let's say,"
00:38:23,00:38:25,"around the time of the Beatles,"
00:38:25,00:38:28,"guitar chords were a bit more secretive, it seems."
00:38:28,00:38:29,And I didn't know that.
00:38:29,00:38:31,So there's this amazing story.
00:38:31,00:38:33,- Amazing Paul McCartney story.
00:38:33,00:38:35,"- Yeah, so there's a great McCartney and Lennon story"
00:38:35,00:38:38,where they heard in Liverpool
00:38:38,00:38:40,that there was someone who was a crosstown
00:38:40,00:38:43,who knew the chord B7.
00:38:43,00:38:46,And they got on the bus and they traveled all the way
00:38:46,00:38:49,"and they met him and they said, ""Show us B7."""
00:38:49,00:38:52,And he showed them and they said it was a turning point
00:38:52,00:38:54,for their composition and kind of was part of
00:38:54,00:38:56,how the Beatles became the Beatles.
00:38:56,00:38:58,"It was the Lost Chord, he called it."
00:38:58,00:39:00,"And they went back home, they showed everyone B7"
00:39:00,00:39:02,and they spread it around.
00:39:02,00:39:03,"And I thought, ""That sounds ridiculous."""
00:39:03,00:39:07,"But when you read into the early days of guitar,"
00:39:07,00:39:09,"if you were an amazing guitarist,"
00:39:09,00:39:12,you'd kind of clasp onto what you were able to do.
00:39:12,00:39:13,So there was a guy who was known as the king
00:39:13,00:39:16,in jazz guitaring called Freddie Keppard.
00:39:16,00:39:18,And Freddie Keppard had a picking style
00:39:18,00:39:20,"that was so unique that when he went on stage,"
00:39:20,00:39:23,he used to put a handkerchief over his picking hand
00:39:23,00:39:27,so that no one could see the magic going on underneath.
00:39:27,00:39:28,"- 'Cause I can't play guitar,"
00:39:28,00:39:30,so the analogy I can make is with piano.
00:39:30,00:39:32,"And the idea of having a new piano chord,"
00:39:32,00:39:34,like I could just bash some keys together
00:39:34,00:39:37,that don't sound very good and say I've made a new one.
00:39:37,00:39:39,But was B7 something that sounded amazing
00:39:39,00:39:41,and no one had discovered this combination of notes?
00:39:41,00:39:44,"- It sort of just doesn't make sense, Anna,"
00:39:44,00:39:46,"because it's quite, it's a simplicity chord, yeah."
00:39:46,00:39:48,- But it does fit really well
00:39:48,00:39:50,"with the other easy to play cards, isn't it?"
00:39:50,00:39:52,- It's in the same area of the guitar.
00:39:52,00:39:53,There's not much change.
00:39:53,00:39:55,- We just hadn't discovered it sounded good.
00:39:55,00:39:56,"- No, we knew it."
00:39:56,00:39:57,- It exists in music.
00:39:57,00:39:58,- Yeah.
00:39:58,00:39:59,"- Oh, so they'll just pull and John didn't know it."
00:39:59,00:40:00,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:40:00,00:40:02,"- Yeah, they will have heard it,"
00:40:02,00:40:04,but not known where to put their fingers to get that sound.
00:40:04,00:40:05,- Yeah.
00:40:05,00:40:07,"- I think also, Anna, like you say,"
00:40:07,00:40:10,I could just bash the keys and get something.
00:40:10,00:40:12,"I used to think that if, 'cause I'm terrible at drawing,"
00:40:12,00:40:14,"I thought if I just draw enough times,"
00:40:14,00:40:18,eventually my lines will turn into something beautiful.
00:40:18,00:40:20,But it doesn't quite work like that for some reason.
00:40:20,00:40:22,- I had exactly the same approach to the guitar.
00:40:22,00:40:23,Someone told me early on
00:40:23,00:40:26,that Hendrix didn't know what notes he was playing.
00:40:26,00:40:27,And that's a lie.
00:40:27,00:40:28,(both laughing)
00:40:28,00:40:30,'Cause Hendrix was a session musician.
00:40:30,00:40:31,Hendrix on the chilling circuit.
00:40:31,00:40:32,Hendrix played for absolutely everyone.
00:40:32,00:40:33,He played for Little Richard.
00:40:33,00:40:36,"He played for, you know, he backed so many bands."
00:40:36,00:40:38,And you can't do that without knowing what key you're in
00:40:38,00:40:40,"and what, literally, what notes you're playing."
00:40:40,00:40:42,"So I absolutely had, James, I had exactly the same thing."
00:40:42,00:40:45,"But if I just keep playing, eventually I'll put a note."
00:40:45,00:40:49,"And then I'm now like 30 years odd later,"
00:40:49,00:40:52,"starting to learn some theory and going,"
00:40:52,00:40:54,"""Oh, this makes it so much better."""
00:40:54,00:40:55,(both laughing)
00:40:55,00:40:56,But there's that thing.
00:40:56,00:40:57,"When I've got my, I can actually,"
00:40:57,00:40:59,I can actually demonstrate.
00:40:59,00:41:02,"It, you know, it just sounds so, so D, D7."
00:41:02,00:41:07,It adds so much texture and kind of emotion to it.
00:41:07,00:41:09,But the other thing about the Beatles
00:41:09,00:41:11,"was that they were one of the first,"
00:41:11,00:41:12,"well, they're basically the first band"
00:41:12,00:41:16,to make writing their own music the thing within pop music.
00:41:16,00:41:17,"That's like the mind-blowing thing,"
00:41:17,00:41:19,Elvis didn't write his songs.
00:41:19,00:41:19,- Yeah.
00:41:19,00:41:22,"- Paul McCartney, who famously did write his songs."
00:41:22,00:41:25,His guitar flies first class.
00:41:25,00:41:27,He books it his own seat.
00:41:27,00:41:28,I wanna know how the booking works.
00:41:28,00:41:29,"'Cause when you're on EasyJet,"
00:41:29,00:41:31,you have to put in passport details
00:41:31,00:41:34,and I don't believe it has a passport.
00:41:34,00:41:37,But BB King actually used to fly his guitar as well.
00:41:37,00:41:37,- Lucille.
00:41:37,00:41:39,"- In its own, in its own playing."
00:41:39,00:41:40,"Yeah, Lucille, was that what the guitar was called?"
00:41:40,00:41:41,- Yeah.
00:41:41,00:41:42,- King's guitar's called Lucille.
00:41:42,00:41:44,- That's insane because he didn't book it
00:41:44,00:41:45,under the name Lucille.
00:41:45,00:41:48,He booked it under the name Mr. Guitar.
00:41:48,00:41:49,(laughing)
00:41:49,00:41:52,"Well, that's when Elton John books into a hotel."
00:41:52,00:41:53,You don't give your real name.
00:41:53,00:41:55,You don't want people knowing Lucille's on the plane.
00:41:55,00:41:56,"They might see it. - No, good point."
00:41:56,00:41:57,- It's a pseudonym.
00:41:57,00:41:59,He named it Lucille apparently
00:41:59,00:42:02,because he had to rescue one of his guitars
00:42:02,00:42:05,from a fire in a building that was started by two men
00:42:05,00:42:07,having a fight over a woman called Lucille.
00:42:07,00:42:08,- Really?
00:42:08,00:42:10,"- Yeah, so that's where that name comes from."
00:42:10,00:42:12,"Angus Young called his the workhorse,"
00:42:12,00:42:15,"what does call it, Willie Nelson's is trigger."
00:42:15,00:42:17,They've all got their nicknames for them.
00:42:17,00:42:18,- That's very sweet.
00:42:18,00:42:19,- Willie Nelson's trigger guitar.
00:42:19,00:42:22,He replaced the neck eight times and the body three times.
00:42:22,00:42:24,(laughing)
00:42:24,00:42:26,"- Hey, do you know the Eminem song, My Name Is?"
00:42:26,00:42:28,"I mean, who doesn't, what a stupid question."
00:42:28,00:42:30,"There's a guitar and bass part in that,"
00:42:30,00:42:32,like one of the really familiar bits you'd recognise.
00:42:32,00:42:33,- Yeah.
00:42:33,00:42:36,- Do you know who plays the guitar and bass on that?
00:42:36,00:42:36,"- Oh, Andrew."
00:42:36,00:42:37,"- Yeah, Andrew knows it."
00:42:37,00:42:38,"- Chaz and Dave, isn't it?"
00:42:38,00:42:40,- It's Chaz and Dave.
00:42:40,00:42:41,It's so cool.
00:42:41,00:42:43,- So who were Chaz and Dave?
00:42:43,00:42:46,"I know their names, but I don't fully know what they were."
00:42:46,00:42:48,"They were like Cockney, they made like Cockney songs."
00:42:48,00:42:49,- Rockney.
00:42:49,00:42:50,- Yeah.
00:42:50,00:42:53,- Chaz and Dave were session musicians
00:42:53,00:42:54,and they played with absolutely everyone
00:42:54,00:42:55,and they were incredible musicians.
00:42:55,00:42:58,"And what they decided they wanted to do was,"
00:42:58,00:43:00,the big thing was they wanted to do rock and roll
00:43:00,00:43:02,in their own accent because every British band
00:43:02,00:43:05,that did rock and roll adopted an American accent
00:43:05,00:43:07,and Chaz Hodges' big thing was he wanted to write
00:43:07,00:43:09,a love song in his own accent.
00:43:09,00:43:11,"So they came up with this thing, Rockney."
00:43:11,00:43:12,"And I, I mean, I adore Chaz and Dave."
00:43:12,00:43:14,I unironically love them.
00:43:14,00:43:16,- I was on tour in New Zealand
00:43:16,00:43:19,"and when you do New Zealand, you're already homesick"
00:43:19,00:43:21,and New Zealand feels like the end of the world
00:43:21,00:43:23,'cause of the way it sticks out into the Pacific.
00:43:23,00:43:26,And one of the other comics I was getting was Terry Alderton.
00:43:26,00:43:28,"We were both being homesick and you went, listen to this."
00:43:28,00:43:32,"And it's a Chaz and Dave song called ""That's What I Like"""
00:43:32,00:43:33,and it's just a list.
00:43:33,00:43:35,It's like the amily of pop music.
00:43:35,00:43:37,Cheese and onion sandwiches and Darby China
00:43:37,00:43:39,"where whittles and jigs are wooing me,"
00:43:39,00:43:40,dogging me on if I haven't a swear.
00:43:40,00:43:42,It's absolutely gorgeous.
00:43:42,00:43:44,"Like, I completely unironically love them."
00:43:44,00:43:45,"- Yeah, amazing."
00:43:45,00:43:46,- They are cracking.
00:43:46,00:43:49,"- So they weren't in the studio with Eminem though, right?"
00:43:49,00:43:50,"This was a sample, presumably."
00:43:50,00:43:51,"- No, it was a sample."
00:43:51,00:43:52,- Okay.
00:43:52,00:43:53,- Yeah.
00:43:53,00:43:54,- Okay.
00:43:54,00:43:56,"- Okay, punks and samples."
00:43:56,00:43:57,That takes me to Daft Punk.
00:43:57,00:43:59,- Uh-huh.
00:43:59,00:43:59,- The band Daft Punk.
00:43:59,00:44:03,So there is a species that has been discovered
00:44:03,00:44:08,"known as by Kallelia Daft Punka, okay?"
00:44:08,00:44:09,It's a type of flatworm.
00:44:09,00:44:12,And do you know why it got that name?
00:44:12,00:44:14,"Is it, does it wear hoods, masks over its face all the time?"
00:44:14,00:44:16,"- I like, yeah, like a big helmet."
00:44:16,00:44:17,- Yeah.
00:44:17,00:44:17,- You're close enough.
00:44:17,00:44:18,I'll let you have it.
00:44:18,00:44:20,And it has a helmet-shaped structure
00:44:20,00:44:22,on the end of its penis.
00:44:22,00:44:23,- Okay.
00:44:23,00:44:25,- Okay.
00:44:25,00:44:27,"- That's not where they wear theirs, I don't think."
00:44:27,00:44:29,"- I like to think that Daft Punk,"
00:44:29,00:44:30,"if they tuck their trousers down,"
00:44:30,00:44:32,they would have the same helmets.
00:44:32,00:44:34,- They do.
00:44:34,00:44:36,- So you can't identify them by their penis.
00:44:36,00:44:36,- They're just so fractal
00:44:36,00:44:39,"and then on a cellular level, they're helmets."
00:44:39,00:44:40,(laughing)
00:44:40,00:44:42,- It's helmets all the way down.
00:44:42,00:44:43,- Yeah.
00:44:43,00:44:46,Do you know who Daft Punk were very influenced by?
00:44:46,00:44:47,- Suicide.
00:44:47,00:44:48,- Suicide.
00:44:48,00:44:49,- Were they?
00:44:49,00:44:50,"- Yeah, they cite, they cite."
00:44:50,00:44:52,"I mean, 'cause if you listen to it, it is,"
00:44:52,00:44:54,"it's electro music, really,"
00:44:54,00:44:56,when you listen to that opening album.
00:44:56,00:44:59,"So yeah, they cite them as influences."
00:44:59,00:45:01,"Hey, listen, we need to wrap up in a second."
00:45:01,00:45:05,"Andrew, before we do, you're in Edinburgh."
00:45:05,00:45:07,"- I am, I'm doing two shows, 'cause I'm an idiot."
00:45:07,00:45:09,"I'm doing two shows and I broke my leg in February,"
00:45:09,00:45:11,so I am behind.
00:45:11,00:45:14,I'm doing Andrew and Neil's History of Punk
00:45:14,00:45:17,"at Bannermans at 11.30 p.m.,"
00:45:17,00:45:19,"and that starts on the 1st of August,"
00:45:19,00:45:21,"right through not doing Mondays or Tuesdays,"
00:45:21,00:45:23,'cause I'm actually a little bit more sensible
00:45:23,00:45:24,than I used to be.
00:45:24,00:45:26,And I'm doing a stand-up show
00:45:26,00:45:29,"that discusses my three-point model of political difference,"
00:45:29,00:45:32,which I think might be the only genuinely original idea
00:45:32,00:45:33,"I've ever had,"
00:45:33,00:45:37,"three ways in which people disagree or are wrong politically,"
00:45:37,00:45:39,"and it's got tons of very, very stupid jokes"
00:45:39,00:45:41,"and a thing about rhombus,"
00:45:41,00:45:42,"and that's could escape,"
00:45:42,00:45:45,and it's on at 7.10 p.m. at Monkey Barrel.
00:45:45,00:45:48,"So yeah, two shows. - Two years was awesome."
00:45:48,00:45:51,(upbeat music)
00:45:51,00:45:56,"- It's time for our final fact of the show,"
00:45:56,00:45:58,and that is Ahir Shah.
00:45:58,00:46:01,- So my fact is that Andrew Carnegie
00:46:01,00:46:03,tried to achieve world peace
00:46:03,00:46:05,by sending countries dinosaurs.
00:46:06,00:46:09,"- Yes, the common enemy."
00:46:09,00:46:11,I don't think you get to be like
00:46:11,00:46:14,that successful and wealthy and industrialist
00:46:14,00:46:16,without being a bit of an ideas guy.
00:46:16,00:46:21,"And like, are all of them gonna come off necessarily?"
00:46:21,00:46:25,"No, but you can say that you did your level best."
00:46:25,00:46:26,- I think it's a great idea.
00:46:26,00:46:30,"Like, you know, the idea of everyone having nuclear weapons"
00:46:30,00:46:31,so that no one attacks each other.
00:46:31,00:46:33,"- Yeah, mutilation of dinosaurs."
00:46:33,00:46:35,"- Yeah, that's perfect."
00:46:35,00:46:37,And you could make it so like the bigger countries
00:46:37,00:46:39,have smaller dinosaurs
00:46:39,00:46:41,and the smaller countries have bigger dinosaurs.
00:46:41,00:46:43,"- Oh, we're being progressive, are we?"
00:46:43,00:46:45,So the Vatican would have to have like
00:46:45,00:46:48,"the largest of titan, it would be as big as the Vatican."
00:46:48,00:46:52,"- So aside from all this absurd reasoning,"
00:46:52,00:46:55,what was the idea behind world peace
00:46:55,00:46:57,being created by dinosaur diplomacy?
00:46:57,00:47:00,"- Well, it wasn't necessarily,"
00:47:00,00:47:04,it was another MAD mutually assured Diplodocus
00:47:04,00:47:07,"or however we want to pronounce it, basically."
00:47:07,00:47:10,"I'm sure that many, if not most of the listeners"
00:47:10,00:47:13,"will have seen Dippy, the famous skeleton"
00:47:13,00:47:16,"in the Natural History Museum, right?"
00:47:16,00:47:20,"And basically the idea was that in 1899,"
00:47:20,00:47:23,"the original sort of Dippy, Dippy's a composite skeleton,"
00:47:23,00:47:26,but the sort of main part of it was found in Wyoming
00:47:26,00:47:30,on a expedition that had been sponsored by Carnegie.
00:47:30,00:47:33,"Now, this is like something no one's ever seen before, right?"
00:47:33,00:47:35,This is gonna change the game in a huge way.
00:47:35,00:47:38,"And a couple of years later,"
00:47:38,00:47:43,King Edward goes up to Carnegie's castle in Scotland
00:47:43,00:47:47,and sees just like a picture of the Dippy skeleton.
00:47:47,00:47:50,"I was like, oh, it'd be great to have something like that"
00:47:50,00:47:53,for the Natural History Museum.
00:47:53,00:47:57,And Carnegie really rolls with this.
00:47:57,00:47:58,"And I believe like at his own expense,"
00:47:58,00:48:01,"like commissions a guy to do a plaster cast of it,"
00:48:01,00:48:03,"the guy's initially just like,"
00:48:03,00:48:04,"no, I don't want to do that."
00:48:04,00:48:08,"It's massive, like no one's ever attempted to do anything"
00:48:08,00:48:09,on this scale before.
00:48:09,00:48:12,"But sure enough, it ends up in the Natural History Museum"
00:48:12,00:48:13,"and to great fanfare,"
00:48:13,00:48:15,millions of people have seen this for the first time.
00:48:15,00:48:18,And I guess Carnegie gets it into his head
00:48:18,00:48:22,that this is something about scientific discovery
00:48:22,00:48:24,and everyone working together
00:48:24,00:48:27,and cross national cooperation.
00:48:27,00:48:29,And so pretty much every year
00:48:29,00:48:31,"of the first decade of the 1900s,"
00:48:31,00:48:36,he's giving one of these things out to different countries
00:48:36,00:48:38,on the understanding that how could we possibly
00:48:38,00:48:42,fight one another if everyone has a dinosaur?
00:48:42,00:48:43,You know?
00:48:43,00:48:45,"- A Dippy, that makes perfect sense."
00:48:45,00:48:48,"- Yeah, and so over the course of the first decade"
00:48:48,00:48:51,"of the 1900s, we're talking there's one in France,"
00:48:51,00:48:53,"in Germany, in Italy, in Russia."
00:48:53,00:48:56,"These didn't work, right?"
00:48:56,00:49:00,And Mr. Carnegie took the beginning
00:49:00,00:49:03,of the Great War very badly
00:49:03,00:49:06,"because he was basically just like,"
00:49:06,00:49:08,"""I gave you all a fucking dinosaur."""
00:49:08,00:49:10,(laughing)
00:49:10,00:49:12,"Like, ""Lads, what are we doing?"""
00:49:12,00:49:14,"- And he was so upset, wasn't he?"
00:49:14,00:49:16,"I mean, I know quite a lot of people were upset"
00:49:16,00:49:17,about the First World War.
00:49:17,00:49:19,"Maybe some people suffered even more than him,"
00:49:19,00:49:21,but a lot of biographies say he sort of died
00:49:21,00:49:23,of a broken heart in 1919
00:49:23,00:49:27,because he was so devastated that his plan hasn't worked
00:49:27,00:49:29,and World War I happened anyway.
00:49:29,00:49:30,But he saw the end of the war.
00:49:30,00:49:32,"He might have lived to friend of the podcast,"
00:49:32,00:49:35,"The Treaty of Versailles, if it was 1919,"
00:49:35,00:49:36,'cause that was the year that was signed.
00:49:36,00:49:37,So that should have given him a new lease of life.
00:49:37,00:49:40,"It's like, ""Oh, great, now we can resume the dinosaur"
00:49:40,00:49:40,"""with this batch."""
00:49:40,00:49:42,"- But then he read the treaty and was like,"
00:49:42,00:49:44,"""This doesn't even mention the dinosaurs, come on."""
00:49:44,00:49:46,(laughing)
00:49:46,00:49:48,"Like, how do you expect this piece to hold?"
00:49:48,00:49:50,It should be the Treaty of Velociraptor
00:49:50,00:49:52,and then everyone's gonna have it.
00:49:52,00:49:53,- It's so good.
00:49:53,00:49:56,"Because I, so the things I didn't know about this,"
00:49:56,00:49:57,"I mean, I didn't know anything about this story."
00:49:57,00:49:59,"I'd only vaguely heard of Andrew Carnegie, to be honest,"
00:49:59,00:50:02,"as, you know, the man who sold steel to the world,"
00:50:02,00:50:04,"like, made steel, made, you know,"
00:50:04,00:50:05,big American industrialist.
00:50:05,00:50:07,But he was looking for an exhibit for his museum.
00:50:07,00:50:08,That's what started all this.
00:50:08,00:50:12,He had the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh
00:50:12,00:50:15,"and he needed a showstopper and he read in the paper,"
00:50:15,00:50:17,"oh, they found this gigantic thing."
00:50:17,00:50:20,And actually what had been found was a thigh bone.
00:50:20,00:50:22,"So it was, it was just a femur."
00:50:22,00:50:25,"And so he wrote to the director of the museum saying,"
00:50:25,00:50:27,"""You must buy this."""
00:50:27,00:50:29,And the museum director was in an awkward spot
00:50:29,00:50:31,"'cause you can't just buy a boat,"
00:50:31,00:50:33,like one bone is not a showstopper for a museum.
00:50:33,00:50:34,That's rubbish.
00:50:34,00:50:36,"So he said, ""Well, we've got to find another one then."""
00:50:36,00:50:38,And he started funding all the expeditions.
00:50:38,00:50:39,"And thank God they found,"
00:50:39,00:50:40,"they found, this is very American,"
00:50:40,00:50:43,they found it on the 4th of July.
00:50:43,00:50:44,- Did they?
00:50:44,00:50:44,- They did.
00:50:44,00:50:45,"- Oh, that's nice."
00:50:45,00:50:46,- It's very American.
00:50:46,00:50:49,"- I bet they didn't, I bet they found it in June"
00:50:49,00:50:52,"and they were like, ""Zip it, wait a couple of weeks."""
00:50:52,00:50:55,- I was looking at some of these other ones
00:50:55,00:50:57,that are around the world.
00:50:57,00:51:00,"And for instance, one was donated"
00:51:00,00:51:05,"to the paleontological museum in Munich, Germany in 1932"
00:51:05,00:51:09,"and wasn't mounted at that, of course,"
00:51:09,00:51:10,what happens in 1933 in Germany.
00:51:10,00:51:14,"And it's like, guys, if you just do the dinosaur thing,"
00:51:14,00:51:18,"it might help, but like everyone goes very extreme"
00:51:18,00:51:20,when they're not doing the dinosaur thing.
00:51:20,00:51:22,"- Wow, I wonder if anyone's ever made that connection before."
00:51:22,00:51:23,I love it.
00:51:23,00:51:24,- Is that why?
00:51:24,00:51:26,- Is it perhaps that the dinosaur thing
00:51:26,00:51:27,is leading up to this war?
00:51:27,00:51:29,"- Oh, right, okay, yes."
00:51:29,00:51:31,- If you've got a couple of kids
00:51:31,00:51:33,"and one of them has an ice cream,"
00:51:33,00:51:35,you think I'm gonna give them all ice creams
00:51:35,00:51:36,"and that'll make them all happy,"
00:51:36,00:51:38,but it really doesn't work like that.
00:51:38,00:51:40,"- Well, 'cause they go, ""My ice cream's better than yours."""
00:51:40,00:51:41,You've got the fake ice cream.
00:51:41,00:51:42,I'm the one with the real one.
00:51:42,00:51:43,- In precisely.
00:51:43,00:51:44,- Yeah.
00:51:44,00:51:46,"And in fact, the Natural History Museum"
00:51:46,00:51:49,and British commentators were really sniffy about Dippy.
00:51:49,00:51:50,They were so rude about him.
00:51:50,00:51:51,"Yeah, they were."
00:51:51,00:51:54,"So the people absolutely loved it,"
00:51:54,00:51:56,"but basically all the reviews said,"
00:51:56,00:51:58,"""This is a fuss about nothing."""
00:51:58,00:52:00,They wouldn't put Dippy in the paleontology section.
00:52:00,00:52:03,So Dippy was in the gallery of small reptiles.
00:52:03,00:52:07,"- Watch, stop it, that can't be true."
00:52:07,00:52:09,"- That's right, that's where he was housed,"
00:52:09,00:52:12,"feeling pretty out of place, I imagine."
00:52:12,00:52:14,And the reviews tended to focus on the fact
00:52:14,00:52:16,that he wasn't particularly interesting
00:52:16,00:52:20,"because of the size of his brain or her brain, sorry."
00:52:20,00:52:21,"So reviews said things like,"
00:52:21,00:52:23,"""The brain cavity is no bigger than a walnut."
00:52:23,00:52:25,"How can we get excited by this?"""
00:52:25,00:52:27,Dippy's obviously a complete moron.
00:52:27,00:52:29,"One of the, in fact, the guy who accepted it"
00:52:29,00:52:31,on behalf of the Natural History Museum
00:52:31,00:52:33,"in his acceptance speech said,"
00:52:33,00:52:36,"""Given that this animal was clearly very stupid,"
00:52:36,00:52:39,"the size of it doesn't really add much to the interest."""
00:52:39,00:52:41,"So it was this, and I think it was British jealousy"
00:52:41,00:52:44,about the fact that we tended to export our science
00:52:44,00:52:45,"to America in this field,"
00:52:45,00:52:48,and America suddenly waltzed in
00:52:48,00:52:49,with their big showstopper.
00:52:49,00:52:51,"But fortunately, the people didn't give a shit"
00:52:51,00:52:52,about the size of the brain
00:52:52,00:52:54,and thousands of people rocked up.
00:52:54,00:52:57,"- And then, of course, Dippy isn't there anymore."
00:52:57,00:52:59,"If you go to the NHM, it's Big Old Whale."
00:52:59,00:53:01,They got rid of it in 2017.
00:53:01,00:53:04,And when did the whole world start going to shit?
00:53:04,00:53:07,(laughing)
00:53:07,00:53:08,- Exactly.
00:53:08,00:53:10,"- Wait, wasn't it 2016?"
00:53:10,00:53:12,"- Annad, please. - Sorry, I hate that."
00:53:12,00:53:13,- They're 65 million years old.
00:53:13,00:53:14,What's a year here or there?
00:53:14,00:53:15,Come on.
00:53:15,00:53:18,(laughing)
00:53:18,00:53:20,- There is something in this.
00:53:20,00:53:21,(laughing)
00:53:21,00:53:23,- Can I say that I just love this so much
00:53:23,00:53:24,about the thing you mentioned there here
00:53:24,00:53:26,"about King Edward VII,"
00:53:26,00:53:29,and that's when prompted the first cast
00:53:29,00:53:30,to be made and dished out.
00:53:30,00:53:33,"So King Edward VII, he'd only been King for a year."
00:53:33,00:53:36,"It was 1902, and he visited Carnegie in Scotland"
00:53:36,00:53:38,"at his home, which is this amazing house"
00:53:38,00:53:40,called Skibo Castle.
00:53:40,00:53:42,"It had things that the world had never seen before,"
00:53:42,00:53:45,like indoor toilets and electricity.
00:53:45,00:53:46,"Like, it was the equivalent"
00:53:46,00:53:49,of the most amazing space-age house at the time.
00:53:49,00:53:51,And Edward wanted to see the plumbing
00:53:51,00:53:53,'cause he wanted to restore all the royal palaces.
00:53:53,00:53:55,"You know, Queen Victoria had been on the throne"
00:53:55,00:53:56,in an incredibly long time.
00:53:56,00:53:57,They were very dilapidated.
00:53:57,00:53:58,"He was like, ""Get out of there!"
00:53:58,00:53:59,"""I need to come!"""
00:53:59,00:54:01,(laughing)
00:54:01,00:54:04,"And so, Edward wanted some of that, basically,"
00:54:04,00:54:05,and that's why he was visiting.
00:54:05,00:54:08,And the visit happened allegedly at such short notice
00:54:08,00:54:12,"that the organ player for the household,"
00:54:12,00:54:14,"again, if you're very rich, you just have one of these,"
00:54:14,00:54:16,the organ player was in the swimming pool
00:54:16,00:54:19,and had to be hurriedly hauled out and towel himself off
00:54:19,00:54:22,so he could play God Save the King as the king arrived.
00:54:22,00:54:24,That is the story.
00:54:24,00:54:26,"- And to be fair, as far as Bellina's go,"
00:54:26,00:54:28,he seems like one of the good ones.
00:54:28,00:54:29,"He gets, doesn't he?"
00:54:29,00:54:30,"I mean, I'm gonna say this, and next week,"
00:54:30,00:54:32,it'll come out that he made lots of inappropriate jokes
00:54:32,00:54:36,"to female colleagues, but at this point in time,"
00:54:36,00:54:38,"I think we can say Andrew Carnegie,"
00:54:38,00:54:41,"pretty good guy, one of the big 19th century philanthropists"
00:54:41,00:54:42,"gave away a huge amount of his money,"
00:54:42,00:54:44,"about 90% of his fortune,"
00:54:44,00:54:49,equivalent of $11 billion today to charities and foundations.
00:54:49,00:54:51,"So he really did wanna make the world a better place,"
00:54:51,00:54:52,didn't he?
00:54:52,00:54:55,- Which of us allows their organ player in the swimming pool?
00:54:55,00:54:57,(laughing)
00:54:57,00:54:59,"- I certainly don't, that's a good point."
00:54:59,00:55:02,"- The wars were a bad time for some dinosaurs,"
00:55:02,00:55:05,so Spinosaurus was a dinosaur
00:55:05,00:55:08,"which went extinct about 60-odd million years ago,"
00:55:08,00:55:10,and then it went extinct for a second time
00:55:10,00:55:13,during World War II because the British bombed it
00:55:13,00:55:17,"in 1944 to smithereens, so it disappeared,"
00:55:17,00:55:18,and we didn't have it anymore.
00:55:18,00:55:19,- Really?
00:55:19,00:55:22,"- Yeah, but luckily, it's come to light again"
00:55:22,00:55:24,"in the last 20 years or so,"
00:55:24,00:55:26,"we've managed to find some more fossils,"
00:55:26,00:55:28,so we got a chance to make it extinct a third time.
00:55:28,00:55:30,- Yes!
00:55:30,00:55:32,"- This really reminds me of, did you ever see that headline"
00:55:32,00:55:34,"that was something like,"
00:55:34,00:55:38,"""Cocaine in the Thames is another thing eels don't need?"""
00:55:38,00:55:40,(laughing)
00:55:40,00:55:43,- Dinosaurs about to put up with so much.
00:55:43,00:55:45,"- I've already got extinct once, mate."
00:55:45,00:55:47,(laughing)
00:55:47,00:55:50,"- Do you know, I think maybe this is common knowledge"
00:55:50,00:55:53,"except to me, but dinosaurs were reptiles."
00:55:53,00:55:54,One of the mad things about dinosaurs
00:55:54,00:55:56,is we don't know if they were warm-blooded or cold-blooded.
00:55:56,00:55:57,What?
00:55:57,00:55:59,"That's like so basic a thing to know,"
00:55:59,00:56:01,"but dinosaurs count as reptiles,"
00:56:01,00:56:03,all birds are reptiles as well.
00:56:03,00:56:06,"Technically, they're part of this group called diapsida,"
00:56:06,00:56:08,"which also includes all other reptiles,"
00:56:08,00:56:10,but we're also reptiles.
00:56:10,00:56:11,"Come on, well."
00:56:11,00:56:12,- No.
00:56:12,00:56:13,"- The queen, obviously."
00:56:13,00:56:15,(laughing)
00:56:15,00:56:16,- That's why do you think the king
00:56:16,00:56:18,wanted these dinosaurs so much?
00:56:18,00:56:19,He wanted his mates around.
00:56:19,00:56:23,"No, this is, if you go high enough up the taxonomy,"
00:56:23,00:56:25,"you're in the reptiliomorphic clade,"
00:56:25,00:56:28,"and that's mammals, birds, reptiles,"
00:56:28,00:56:31,and the thing that it's not is frogs.
00:56:31,00:56:33,"So I shouldn't like amphibians,"
00:56:33,00:56:35,"which are basically frogs, right?"
00:56:35,00:56:38,- So basically everything that isn't the frog is the same.
00:56:38,00:56:40,"- Sort of, with some insects and stuff."
00:56:40,00:56:42,"But basically, there's all of us together."
00:56:42,00:56:44,And then frogs and nukes.
00:56:44,00:56:47,- I think that that would be a very funny prejudice to have.
00:56:47,00:56:50,(laughing)
00:56:50,00:56:51,- They're not like frogs.
00:56:51,00:56:53,"- Everything in the world, like humans,"
00:56:53,00:56:56,"other species, objects, absolutely everything,"
00:56:56,00:56:58,"you treat entirely equally,"
00:56:58,00:57:01,but you're a ginormous frogist.
00:57:01,00:57:06,"- Yeah, like race is very old hat, clade is a lie."
00:57:06,00:57:09,"- I think there's some background towards this,"
00:57:09,00:57:11,"and I think maybe we should be against frogs,"
00:57:11,00:57:16,because there was a frog called Beelzebufo Ampinga
00:57:16,00:57:18,that lived 65 to 70 million years ago.
00:57:18,00:57:19,"It was absolutely massive,"
00:57:19,00:57:21,"and it had very, very strong jaws,"
00:57:21,00:57:26,so strong that they think it might be able to eat dinosaurs.
00:57:26,00:57:28,"- No, not like a T-Rex."
00:57:28,00:57:31,"- No, like little tiny chickeny ones, I guess."
00:57:31,00:57:32,- Cool.
00:57:32,00:57:34,"- But yeah, like if the frogs and the dinosaurs"
00:57:34,00:57:36,"were fighting all the way back then,"
00:57:36,00:57:38,it's hardly surprising that everyone on this call
00:57:38,00:57:40,is a frog racist right now.
00:57:40,00:57:41,(laughing)
00:57:41,00:57:43,"- I mean, which one survived in the end?"
00:57:43,00:57:44,- Here's a question.
00:57:44,00:57:48,Why do some dinosaurs have such small arms?
00:57:48,00:57:50,- This is a cracker joke.
00:57:50,00:57:51,(laughing)
00:57:51,00:57:52,I just feel it.
00:57:52,00:57:55,"- It's not, it's not, it's a true question."
00:57:55,00:57:58,"Like there was one called Gouamezia Okoei,"
00:57:58,00:58:00,which has basically got no arms at all.
00:58:00,00:58:01,"It's just got too tiny little,"
00:58:01,00:58:04,just a few inches in length arms.
00:58:04,00:58:05,Obviously the Tyrannosaurus Rex
00:58:05,00:58:07,has very small arms as well.
00:58:07,00:58:09,What's going on there?
00:58:09,00:58:11,"- I guess they didn't need to applaud anything,"
00:58:11,00:58:14,"you know, no plays or anything back then."
00:58:14,00:58:15,- But only bad plays.
00:58:15,00:58:16,"- Only shit plays, yeah."
00:58:16,00:58:18,- Yeah.
00:58:18,00:58:20,"- I suppose that's something that happens even now, right?"
00:58:20,00:58:23,Like as in the ancestor of the Kiwi would have had wings
00:58:23,00:58:24,and the wings are just gone.
00:58:24,00:58:27,"So a Kiwi, like if you x-ray it or something,"
00:58:27,00:58:29,a Kiwi is basically just like a ball with the legs.
00:58:29,00:58:30,- Absolutely.
00:58:30,00:58:32,So the Kiwi lost theirs
00:58:32,00:58:34,because they didn't really need it anymore.
00:58:34,00:58:36,And you don't need to use up the energy
00:58:36,00:58:39,to have body parts that you don't need.
00:58:39,00:58:42,"So that's one theory, that they didn't need them anymore"
00:58:42,00:58:45,because maybe they would eat things with their mouth.
00:58:45,00:58:46,So they didn't need to use their hands
00:58:46,00:58:47,to put things in their mouth anymore
00:58:47,00:58:48,"'cause they had such big jaws,"
00:58:48,00:58:50,they would just grab things and bite them.
00:58:50,00:58:52,"And then they didn't use up the energy to make the arms,"
00:58:52,00:58:54,they could use the energy elsewhere.
00:58:54,00:58:56,And the other idea is that they ate
00:58:56,00:58:59,in like real feeding frenzies.
00:58:59,00:59:01,"And that if they had long arms,"
00:59:01,00:59:04,then they'd just get ripped off in those feeding frenzies.
00:59:04,00:59:05,- What do you mean?
00:59:05,00:59:06,Like they'd rip each other's arms off
00:59:06,00:59:07,or they're going for swinging.
00:59:07,00:59:10,- So you've got like 10 T-Rexes all going
00:59:10,00:59:13,after the same bit of meat and they're all biting it.
00:59:13,00:59:16,"And if you've got one T-Rex that looks like Mr. Tickle,"
00:59:16,00:59:18,then his arms just gonna get bitten off.
00:59:18,00:59:19,- Oh my God.
00:59:19,00:59:22,So surely they got to a stage
00:59:22,00:59:25,where they were just biting each other's faces off instead.
00:59:25,00:59:28,"- You're using your face to eat, that's the thing."
00:59:28,00:59:28,- Wow.
00:59:28,00:59:29,"- Anyway, that's a theory."
00:59:29,00:59:31,- How long would it take us to start this process?
00:59:31,00:59:33,"Like if I decided, you know what?"
00:59:33,00:59:36,I'm just gonna go feeding frenzy on all my meals.
00:59:36,00:59:39,And then how many generations do I need to persuade
00:59:39,00:59:41,my children that they just don't need their arms?
00:59:41,00:59:42,'Cause I know it's gotta make me
00:59:42,00:59:44,more evolutionarily successful.
00:59:44,00:59:45,"Like it's gotta make me better at breeding, right?"
00:59:45,00:59:46,If I am eating quickly.
00:59:46,00:59:47,"- Yes, this is the thing."
00:59:47,00:59:50,And I don't know whether necessarily on dates
00:59:50,00:59:52,that's the face directly into.
00:59:52,00:59:57,- We should wrap up here.
00:59:57,00:59:59,You're gonna be in Edinburgh.
00:59:59,01:00:01,"Or maybe by the time people are listening,"
01:00:01,01:00:03,you are in Edinburgh probably.
01:00:03,01:00:04,Where are you right now?
01:00:04,01:00:07,- So I will be at the Edinburgh Festival
01:00:07,01:00:11,doing a show from the 12th to the 24th.
01:00:11,01:00:13,That's not true.
01:00:13,01:00:14,It's the 14th of the 24th.
01:00:14,01:00:16,I'm just going up on the 12th.
01:00:16,01:00:19,"So you might still see me, but on the street."
01:00:19,01:00:22,"It is a work in progress,"
01:00:22,01:00:25,showed towards a new tour that'll be happening next year.
01:00:25,01:00:29,And it is at noon at Monkey Barrel 3.
01:00:29,01:00:31,"Lovely, Monkey Barrel 3."
01:00:31,01:00:32,Get there.
01:00:32,01:00:38,"- Okay, that's it."

01:00:42,01:00:43,Go see their shows.
01:00:43,01:00:44,They're in Edinburgh.
