1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:08,320
 - Hi everyone, welcome to another very, very special episode

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,820
 of "Noses Think As A Fish"

4
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:13,040
 where we showcase four more comedians

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,180
 who are currently at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival.

6
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:18,860
 So who do we have for you this week?

7
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:23,260
 Fact number one will come from Elf Lyons.

8
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:25,420
 Elf is a brilliant comedian.

9
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:28,580
 You will hear from her fact that she is very much

10
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:30,920
 into the clowning style of comedy.

11
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,480
 Her shows have been so well received over the years.

12
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,820
 At last year's Edinburgh Fringe she won the best show,

13
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,880
 that's by the ISH or the Ish Comedy Awards.

14
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,200
 She also won the Comedians Choice Award

15
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,900
 and she'll be up there this year with three different shows.

16
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,640
 So plenty for you to choose from

17
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,880
 if you'd like to hear more of Elf.

18
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,920
 Fact number two will be from Ray O'Leary.

19
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,620
 Ray is a really good friend of ours.

20
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,440
 He is a New Zealand comedian.

21
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,740
 He's often seen on Australian television as well.

22
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:02,260
 A TV show over there called "Have You Been Paying Attention?"

23
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:03,340
 He's a regular on there,

24
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:06,260
 but he's also been on "Tastmaster New Zealand."

25
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:07,780
 He's a fantastic comedian.

26
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:10,220
 He's got such an amazing deadpan humour,

27
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:11,580
 but really smart as well.

28
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:12,900
 I know you're gonna love him.

29
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,900
 Fact number three comes from Andrew O'Neill.

30
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,260
 Andrew is an extremely prolific stand-up comedian,

31
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,940
 done so many shows over the years.

32
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:23,580
 Also musician, also best-selling writer.

33
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,740
 They wrote a book called "The History of Heavy Metal."

34
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,960
 Again, someone who we've known for many, many years

35
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,320
 and really wanted to get on some podcasts for a long time.

36
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,440
 So I was delighted when they said yes.

37
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:36,440
 And finally, fact number four will come from Ahir Shah.

38
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,160
 Now Ahir, he's been nominated a few times, Reddabra,

39
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:42,240
 and he finally won it in 2023.

40
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,960
 He's a brilliant, brilliant comedian.

41
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,880
 We're all massive fans at QI,

42
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:49,240
 and of course he has done QI and all of the paddle shows.

43
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,600
 So I'm sure you will be well familiar with him.

44
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,000
 But anyway, that's four incredible comedians,

45
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,620
 all of whom are currently slogging away

46
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:57,960
 at the Edinburgh Festival.

47
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,900
 So if you are going up there, then please do check them out.

48
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,460
 And if you're not going to Edinburgh,

49
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:03,900
 then like I said last week,

50
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,140
 go and find these people on social media,

51
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,740
 check out all the work that they're doing

52
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:11,160
 because they come highly, highly recommended from us.

53
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,380
 Anyway, that's enough of me talking about, I guess,

54
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,820
 why don't you hear what they have to say

55
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:18,240
 when I say, on with the podcast.

56
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,820
 (upbeat music)

57
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:25,820
 (speaking in foreign language)

58
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:39,160
 Hello, and welcome to another episode

59
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,020
 of No Such Thing as a Fish,

60
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,520
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you

61
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:47,000
 from eight undisclosed locations around the world.

62
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,480
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

63
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,960
 I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,

64
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,260
 James Harkin, Anna Tyshinski,

65
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:55,900
 and four very, very special guests.

66
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,620
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

67
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,540
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

68
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:05,060
 and in no particular order, here we go.

69
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:09,580
 Starting with fact number one, that is, Elf Lions.

70
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,620
 - The great clown teacher, Philip Golia,

71
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,140
 is so known for his negative feedback

72
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:16,660
 that his former students created a Facebook page

73
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:20,020
 purely to log all the many ways he's insulted them.

74
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:23,460
 The page is called, Philip Golia hit me with a stick.

75
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:27,960
 - I mean, this is a very, very famous clown teacher,

76
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,040
 isn't it, Philip Golia?

77
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,200
 And you've met him, haven't you, Elf?

78
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,000
 - Yeah, I trained with him, and I still remember

79
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,840
 I came on stage.

80
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,280
 I think I was performing the Cyclops in Greek tragedy,

81
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,440
 and he went, "Who would you like to make love to?"

82
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,760
 And then I picked a boy called Oliver,

83
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,680
 and he was like, "Oliver, take her to the shower."

84
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,840
 And then I got covered in ice water and then brought back

85
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,460
 and he's like, "Oliver, hit her with a stick."

86
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:55,220
 And then kiss her on the cheek, and then sing,

87
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:57,060
 and then say the text.

88
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:00,660
 And I would start saying text like so speaking,

89
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:03,740
 he drew the sharp sword, hung long and heavy on his side,

90
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,980
 "And hit her with a stick.

91
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,220
 Ow, put more water on her.

92
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,740
 Not bad, goodbye."

93
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:12,140
 And then I'd have to go and sit in the class,

94
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,500
 still covered in water.

95
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,300
 And that wasn't even the weirdest thing that happened.

96
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,600
 - So has Philip Gallier asked someone else

97
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,560
 to hit me with a stick, in your case?

98
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,640
 - Yeah, it was just so silly.

99
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,320
 Like, I think people's concept,

100
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,260
 if you haven't trained with him,

101
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,760
 is that you're just being emotionally abused.

102
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,360
 But like, it's emotional abuse

103
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,800
 in like a really fun clown way.

104
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,360
 - Is it, 'cause it sounds to me like being a clown teacher

105
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,440
 is one of the last remaining ways

106
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,280
 you can get away with a lot of shit and not get sucked for it.

107
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,520
 - It sounds like an HR nightmare,

108
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,120
 is the phrase that keeps on cropping up with me.

109
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,640
 - Yeah, I think safeguarding is something

110
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,900
 that's still being learned in the clowning community,

111
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,140
 I would argue.

112
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:55,640
 But you know what, we had good times.

113
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,480
 We had good times.

114
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,400
 He was cheeky.

115
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:01,340
 I mean, he just called me asparagus or wobbly giraffe.

116
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:04,420
 Look at this wobbly giraffe with our wobbly body.

117
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,440
 - Again, I'm afraid to say, Elf,

118
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,880
 that is a tribunal waiting to happen.

119
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,000
 Wobbly giraffe woman wins three million pounds

120
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,080
 from elderly French clown.

121
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,500
 - I think it's why I've coped so well

122
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,680
 in the comedy industry, to be honest.

123
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,980
 Because if I ever got heckled at the comedy store,

124
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:23,700
 I'm like, you're not a sure old man in France telling me,

125
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:27,000
 would we wish she was on a plane to Malaysian Airlines?

126
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,200
 - Which was one that I got frequently.

127
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,120
 - Right, have you contributed to the Facebook page,

128
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:32,960
 the insults?

129
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,240
 - I think I must have done about 10 years ago.

130
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,640
 - Yeah, 'cause this was set up in 2007.

131
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,640
 The about section says,

132
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,440
 "We are all variously insulted by Philippe Goliere

133
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,520
 in various cities at various times.

134
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,740
 Did he call you a toilet, a cretin?

135
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,740
 When joining this group, please share an insult

136
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,900
 you received from him, adios."

137
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,180
 And yeah, people would put things like,

138
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,660
 "You sound like overcooked spaghetti in a pressure cooker."

139
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,220
 They will sound like they're not hugely harmful,

140
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:59,060
 but I have spoken to a few other people

141
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,260
 who studied under him.

142
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,500
 My friend, Sam, did.

143
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:05,500
 And she said she was so badly insulted by him.

144
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,580
 He talked about how dead her eyes were,

145
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:10,180
 that it was more dead than a family pet

146
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:15,040
 that had not only died, but been buried into the back garden

147
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,960
 that took ages to shovel and left for years and years.

148
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,760
 And then a fountain's been built on it.

149
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,200
 And then you go back and you dig it all up

150
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,520
 and you take the pet back out and you look at his eyes.

151
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,600
 Her eyes are more dead than that, animals.

152
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,800
 Like he did it for like five minutes on stage,

153
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,080
 but she now runs clowns without borders UK.

154
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,120
 So she went into it.

155
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,640
 - And I bet her eyes are great.

156
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,800
 Can I ask what the idea is?

157
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,480
 As someone who hasn't done clowning,

158
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,540
 what's the idea behind being like incessantly

159
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:40,940
 and absurdly insulted?

160
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,740
 Does it make you more funny and clowny?

161
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:43,860
 - I think, do you know what it is?

162
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,320
 It's about realizing that you can never

163
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,840
 disguise anything about yourself.

164
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,100
 You have to come on stage so full of pleasure

165
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,460
 in your body and who you are.

166
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,980
 Because if you try and conceal or hide

167
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:57,340
 what you look like, the audience are gonna notice it.

168
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:59,700
 And also getting rid of the pride and the ego.

169
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,340
 But it's so funny.

170
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,180
 That's the thing.

171
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,020
 Everybody's laughing.

172
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,780
 And I remember once there was someone dressed as a gnome

173
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:08,080
 and she was so bad, she was so not funny.

174
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,720
 And he was like, "You hate me, don't you?"

175
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,920
 And she was like, "Yeah, I do."

176
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,600
 And he's like, "How much do you hate me?"

177
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,560
 And she was as a little gnome.

178
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,960
 She was like, "I hate you fucking hate you, Philippe."

179
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,520
 He's like, "Yeah, you tell me how much you hate me.

180
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,360
 How much you hate my face."

181
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,040
 - And she started getting really angry at him.

182
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,400
 And it was the funniest thing.

183
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,720
 Watching this like 50 year old woman dressed as a gnome

184
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,680
 in Swedish shouting at this French man.

185
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,520
 He's like, "Yes, you tell me how much you hate my guts."

186
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,900
 So it's just, I think it's one of those things.

187
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:38,180
 It's all context related.

188
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:40,140
 And I do genuinely, you could say there's a lot

189
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:43,140
 of HR issues, but it is about the environment.

190
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:45,420
 And Philippe was pretty, if there were any issues

191
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,980
 in the village, there was a village flasher

192
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,460
 who would just flash his penis

193
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,060
 whilst we were all running.

194
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,260
 And Philippe, likewise, this has got to stop you.

195
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,260
 Cannot all keep getting flashed to you.

196
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,660
 And that'd be funny on stage.

197
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:59,940
 I will call the mayor and rang the mayor

198
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:02,880
 to sort out the flasher in the park.

199
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,700
 - Was he sorted out?

200
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,460
 - I think he was actually.

201
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,300
 - Is that what it takes to sort out a flasher?

202
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,940
 You need to tell the mayor

203
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,340
 that it's ruining clown school.

204
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:15,540
 - Yeah, I mean, clown cop is an impressive premise

205
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:16,660
 for a TV show.

206
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:21,580
 - Oh God, from the makers of Tiberius Cop comes clown cop.

207
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:24,260
 - So they sort of torturing people among clowns

208
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:26,420
 does seem to be part of their modus operandi.

209
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:27,580
 There's also a thing in America

210
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:30,980
 where you can hire clowns to terrify your children.

211
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:31,820
 And I actually don't,

212
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:35,320
 this certainly was happening about eight or nine years ago.

213
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,280
 I can't say it happening now,

214
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,560
 but there's wrinkles the clown in Florida.

215
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,960
 Do you guys know him?

216
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,680
 - Don't like the sound of wrinkles.

217
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,960
 - He hires himself out to parents

218
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,800
 who want to petrify their children who are misbehaving.

219
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,920
 And he does things like,

220
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,600
 like one mother hired him to stand a bus stop

221
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,600
 and stare at her 12 year old

222
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,960
 until he freaked out so much

223
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,640
 and started crying in front of his friends and ran home.

224
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,120
 - I'm sorry, any child

225
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,540
 whose parents have hired wrinkles,

226
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,340
 the clown needs to be taken into care

227
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,340
 a face of immediately.

228
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,660
 - It's quite weird, isn't it?

229
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:05,500
 Yeah.

230
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,580
 There's another one called Dominic the Devil

231
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,100
 who stalks, I mean, it does sound bad,

232
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,780
 who stalked victims for weeks,

233
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,340
 sending them chilling text messages

234
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,260
 and making prank phone calls

235
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,580
 and sort of posting them notes,

236
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:17,860
 warning them they're being watched.

237
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,060
 And then eventually after weeks,

238
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,820
 he'll smash a cake in their face.

239
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,100
 - That's noncy.

240
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,660
 Sorry, that's noncy.

241
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,980
 - Well, whatever makes you could do their homework,

242
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,340
 I think is the thinking.

243
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:28,780
 - These guys have strayed quite far

244
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:32,720
 from the joy ethos that the clowning apparently has.

245
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,760
 - I always wonder what the link with scary clowns is,

246
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,160
 there's the bouffon clown.

247
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,800
 So if you imagine the clown that we think of,

248
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,920
 the playful circus clown has puppy eyes,

249
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,720
 very innocent, the inner child,

250
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,680
 then you've got the bouffon,

251
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,200
 which has animal eyes, fox eyes.

252
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,480
 And there's this myth that the bouffon

253
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,000
 were the untouchables in the medieval period

254
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 and they lived outside of the town

255
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,720
 and they lived in the swamps.

256
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:59,300
 And it was everyone who was not respected in that time.

257
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,720
 And then there was one day of the year,

258
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,300
 the day of the bouffon where they could go

259
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:05,860
 and blaspheme against God and say F you to the king

260
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,740
 and they could exaggerate their bodies

261
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,620
 to look like those were in charge

262
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:13,480
 and basically stick a finger up to the power.

263
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,340
 And Sasha Baron Cohen's borat

264
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:17,080
 sort of originates from bouffon.

265
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:20,500
 But it's like the dark clown, it's really smart.

266
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:24,460
 It's not foolish, there's like an acidic twist to it.

267
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:28,040
 - And that's not where clown terror comes from, I think maybe.

268
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,440
 'Cause do you remember how insane it was in 2016

269
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,840
 when that's a new story for about a month of clown terror?

270
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,040
 Which is weird 'cause at the end of that year,

271
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,720
 Donald Trump was elected, wasn't he?

272
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,720
 So you never know, maybe it was a weird precedent.

273
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,640
 - Dan, earlier you mentioned clowns without borders

274
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,560
 and they're an amazing group.

275
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,080
 They go to the worst places in the world,

276
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,600
 like famine zones and war zones

277
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,660
 and they entertain children.

278
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,800
 And there was a peace run in the Washington Post

279
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,040
 this July, headlined, Donald Trump is not a clown.

280
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,520
 I should know.

281
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,720
 And it was by Tim Cunningham

282
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,000
 who was the president of Clowns Without Borders.

283
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,640
 And he was saying, our joyful work

284
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,080
 has been diminished into an insult.

285
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,880
 Every election season, the word clown resurfaces

286
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,080
 to compare Washington politics to a circus.

287
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,080
 And he was incredibly angry about this.

288
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,480
 Clown is used by almost everyone

289
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,440
 to belittle those seen as foolish or incompetent.

290
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,760
 The more we mistreat the word,

291
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,560
 the more we lose understanding of a sacred art form.

292
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,660
 And like, yes, but who's this clown?

293
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:27,980
 It's just a standard.

294
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:30,220
 - It's just such a good line, isn't it?

295
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,300
 And if anyone, by the way,

296
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,740
 just a quick shout out for Clowns Without Borders.

297
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:36,700
 If anyone has any spare money, please donate it to them

298
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,060
 because they do incredible things.

299
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:39,460
 They go into war-torn areas

300
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:41,140
 and they look after refugee children

301
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,460
 who just need a smile on their face.

302
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:43,580
 They're really awesome.

303
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:46,340
 You mentioned Sasha Baron Cohen before, Elf.

304
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:48,900
 And he was a Gollier student, wasn't he?

305
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,020
 - He was indeed.

306
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:52,560
 So many, so many people in the world of entertainment

307
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,760
 like Emma Thompson, Helena Bonham Carter, Rachel Weiss,

308
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,680
 Jeffrey Rush, all studied underneath him.

309
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,960
 So he's had like a huge impact in our general culture.

310
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,680
 But in movies as well,

311
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,360
 Anna, we were just talking about

312
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,640
 how parents hire freaky clowns to stalk their kids.

313
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,920
 This is something that also gets used in movies,

314
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:14,280
 most famously in Close Encounters of the Third Kind.

315
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:17,240
 Spielberg had a little boy who was his first acting role

316
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,480
 and he needed to get this emotion out of him

317
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,620
 when he was scared by seeing aliens outside a window.

318
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:25,060
 And behind the window, as he approached it,

319
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,180
 a sort of blind went down

320
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:28,540
 and there was a terrifying clown standing there.

321
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,860
 Absolutely freaked him out.

322
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:32,620
 Yeah, and then another blind went down

323
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,380
 and there was someone dressed as a gorilla.

324
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,660
 So this kid just absolutely flipped out

325
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,220
 and it was just- - What is going on?

326
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,740
 - It was two of the crew who-

327
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,700
 - And what's he trying to achieve with this kid?

328
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,220
 - He wanted a motion of being scared.

329
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,060
 - He needed a shot of someone

330
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:46,060
 wetting themselves in terror, apparently.

331
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,820
 - Gaila Liberté, are you familiar with the name Gaila Liberté?

332
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,240
 - I possibly am, but I probably never pronounced it

333
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,060
 as beautifully as you did, 'cause my dyslexia means

334
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:59,360
 I pronounce everything like it's going through chat GBT.

335
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,200
 But tell me.

336
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,100
 - Well, he's one of very few clowns

337
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,520
 to have become a billionaire.

338
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,360
 - Wow.

339
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:08,520
 - So he is one of the co-founders of Cirque du Soleil.

340
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,360
 - Okay.

341
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,400
 - He's been a stilt walker and a fire eater before,

342
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,480
 before founding this incredibly successful

343
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,560
 global corporation of brilliant shows.

344
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:21,560
 And in 2009, he became the first ever clown in space.

345
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:26,100
 He went to the International Space Station.

346
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,140
 - Trest as a clown.

347
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,700
 - We don't do anything to get taken seriously.

348
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,660
 I'm sorry, like, everyone, how Adam and everyone is

349
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,900
 in the clowning profession to be taken seriously.

350
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:37,500
 We do such stupid things.

351
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,700
 - He did a little like clowning.

352
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:41,120
 There's a picture of him in his space suit with a nose on.

353
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,380
 And, you know, made the astronauts laugh a bit.

354
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,940
 He was up there partly to make a speech

355
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:47,080
 about the importance of clean water accessibility.

356
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:47,920
 That was the thing.

357
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,400
 Anyway, the real punchline is that he paid $41 million

358
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,480
 to go and he was a billionaire by this point.

359
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,120
 So he had a huge amount of money to spend.

360
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,840
 But the funniest joke of all he made was that he claimed

361
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,720
 the trip was a work expense and that therefore

362
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,440
 he should not have to pay any tax on the $41 million

363
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,700
 he'd spent going to space.

364
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:06,800
 This was litigated for 10 years in the Canadian courts.

365
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,320
 And eventually, and I think about 2020,

366
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,280
 the Canadian Federal Court of Appeals ruled

367
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,400
 that it was a personal trip he was making

368
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,760
 and he would have to pay tax on that.

369
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,200
 But I think that's a very funny joke.

370
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,700
 - I can't believe you're allowed to just go,

371
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:21,000
 he went to the ISS to do that.

372
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,840
 I thought only astronauts.

373
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,680
 - He cleared it with them first.

374
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,260
 Like, he didn't turn up outside the ISS

375
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,400
 just knocking on the hatch.

376
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,060
 - How do you stow away in a rocket?

377
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:31,660
 - There's massive shoes are poking out

378
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:34,740
 from beneath the curtains on the...

379
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,100
 - Oh, we had a very cool clown connection

380
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,460
 with no such thing as a fish, by the way,

381
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:42,060
 that happened on our Australia New Zealand tour.

382
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:45,120
 So we did a fact about clowns ages ago

383
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,920
 that in New Zealand, a man was made redundant.

384
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,360
 And there's this idea that if you're made redundant,

385
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,840
 you can bring someone along with you to the meeting

386
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,920
 so that you have a bit of support.

387
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,400
 And I can see you clapping, Alf.

388
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,720
 I have a feeling you might know this person as well.

389
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,560
 - I do know this.

390
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,080
 - A comedian called Joshua Jack,

391
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,240
 whose real name is Josh Thompson.

392
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,880
 Josh Thompson hired a clown to come with him

393
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,360
 for this resundancy meeting.

394
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,320
 And while the person was saying,

395
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,880
 we think, you know, unfortunately,

396
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,720
 we're gonna have to let you go.

397
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,560
 The clowns are going,

398
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,340
 "Oh boo-hoo," and, you know, doing all the clowny stuff.

399
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,580
 Anyway, we're in Australia

400
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:20,740
 and we have a drink post Melbourne show with Ray O'Leary,

401
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:23,380
 who is part of these Edinburgh showcase shows

402
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,500
 that we're doing with fish.

403
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,620
 And he says, "This is my friend, his name's Josh Thompson.

404
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:29,860
 He was the guy who hired the clown.

405
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:32,300
 We got pissed with the man who was a fact

406
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,940
 on no such thing as a fish, our greatest strings."

407
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,060
 - Yeah.

408
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,460
 Hey, by the way, I found a clown school

409
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:41,680
 where no one who has left that school

410
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,400
 as far as I can tell has gone on to become a clown.

411
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:48,520
 So it turns out there's a town in the UK called Clown.

412
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,800
 C-L-O-W-N-E.

413
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,360
 And Clown Junior High is a school, right?

414
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,640
 And I searched so hard.

415
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,720
 I couldn't find any clowns who live in Clown.

416
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,240
 They have a population of 7,000,

417
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,520
 except I found one guy whose name is Chris Carter,

418
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,480
 who started filming a bunch of horror movies

419
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,000
 where he dresses as a clown.

420
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,700
 And walks the streets.

421
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:13,380
 But he got caught up as a clown in Clown

422
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,460
 by the 2016 Clown Fear.

423
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:17,260
 And he had to tell police

424
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:19,540
 anytime he was going out in his clown gear,

425
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,300
 otherwise he was gonna be arrested.

426
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:24,020
 - No, was that the policy and the police?

427
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:26,060
 Every time you put a red nose on?

428
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,580
 - Well, it was just that month, as you say,

429
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,020
 that crazy month.

430
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:29,860
 - Yeah.

431
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:32,580
 - It made it all the way to the UK town of Clown.

432
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:33,500
 - It was so ridiculous.

433
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,300
 'Cause I think it was confected by journalists

434
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:38,200
 mostly surely, 'cause people aren't that insane.

435
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,280
 But it did affect things then.

436
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,840
 There was a Clown Lives Matter march

437
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,640
 that had to be canceled.

438
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,840
 So, no wonder no one takes it.

439
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,880
 Seriously.

440
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,480
 - I can't get over the headline.

441
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:52,640
 Clown's complaining they're not being taken seriously.

442
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,360
 It's just wonderful.

443
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,480
 - Why are you necking?

444
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,920
 I, when I was a teacher and we did World Book Day

445
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,680
 and all the teachers had to dress up

446
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,000
 and I full on dressed up as Pennywise the Clown.

447
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,400
 It was the one day.

448
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,820
 I had no issues with discipline.

449
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:10,220
 Those kids behaved themselves.

450
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:12,480
 I got latex, I got some fake blood.

451
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,540
 I reenacted the shining as an immersive film experience

452
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,540
 in the classroom.

453
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:18,540
 We went to town that day.

454
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,100
 And I'm no longer a teacher

455
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,500
 'cause the children thought that 'cause I was too scared.

456
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,900
 - We do need to wrap up.

457
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:28,580
 So, Elf, you're gonna be up at the fringe doing

458
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,740
 quite a sort of exciting three shows, right?

459
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:32,580
 - Yeah.

460
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:35,420
 I'm redoing all, I'm doing my bird trilogy.

461
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:38,180
 So I'm doing Swan, which is a one woman production

462
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:41,540
 of Swan Lake in an hour in French-ish.

463
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:44,340
 And then Chiff Chaff, which is a one woman musical

464
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,540
 about the economy.

465
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:48,500
 And then Raven, which is my one woman reenactment

466
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,420
 of all Stephen King's books.

467
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:53,820
 And they're all Clown, Mime, Buffon shows

468
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:56,940
 that make my agent's job of getting me on television

469
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,740
 so difficult.

470
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:01,400
 She's like, please just do a straight standup show.

471
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,140
 And then I was like, I'm gonna make a show

472
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,460
 where I pretend to be a horse.

473
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,180
 And she's just started crying, going,

474
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:08,660
 I want to earn enough money to buy a house.

475
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:11,340
 Please just do something relatable

476
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,700
 so I can pitch you to Taskmaster.

477
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,540
 - Where are you gonna be, Elf?

478
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:15,380
 Where you playing?

479
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:19,220
 - I'm playing in the King Dome at the Pleasants

480
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:21,300
 for the final two weeks of the fringe.

481
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,660
 So Swan one day, Chiff after next, Raven the day after.

482
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,300
 So you can go and see all three in a row

483
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:29,220
 and just see just how mad I am.

484
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,800
 (upbeat music)

485
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:39,040
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two.

486
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,320
 And that is Ray O'Leary.

487
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,960
 - And my fact is, in the 1820s,

488
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:48,000
 philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer hated his contemporary Hagel

489
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,160
 so much he intentionally scheduled his lectures

490
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,120
 at the same time as Hagel's and had zero people attend.

491
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:58,000
 - What a backfire.

492
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,400
 It's terrible backfire.

493
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,380
 Yeah, so apparently this was at the University of Berlin

494
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:06,100
 and Schopenhauer, he taught a few semesters there.

495
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:09,240
 And apparently he never had more than five students

496
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,340
 sign up to attend.

497
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:14,460
 Meanwhile, I think Hagel was getting in the hundreds

498
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,940
 because at the time he was the chair of philosophy

499
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:19,340
 at the University of Berlin.

500
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:22,400
 So he was sort of like the Taylor Swift

501
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,100
 of German philosophical idealism.

502
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,580
 So it was naturally.

503
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:30,260
 I actually call Taylor Swift the Hagel of pop music.

504
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:32,480
 (laughing)

505
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,960
 So do you know a lot about philosophy, Ray,

506
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,520
 because these are pretty new names to me

507
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,120
 and probably a lot of people listening.

508
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:43,440
 - Yes, I do know a bit about philosophy.

509
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,920
 Interestingly, this is not the area of philosophy

510
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,640
 I know the most about, but I was always drawn

511
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,720
 to Arthur Schopenhauer 'cause he was sort of

512
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,320
 just such a miserable man.

513
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,320
 He was just sort of quite a cantankerous,

514
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,280
 horrible old man.

515
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,080
 That was so interesting to me.

516
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,480
 The more you read about him, the more you're like,

517
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:02,120
 "Oh, there's almost nothing redeemable about him

518
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:02,960
 as a person."

519
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,580
 - Sorry, can I just stop you there, Ray?

520
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,120
 Because before we came on mic,

521
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,920
 I was saying how much Andy reminds me of him.

522
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:12,540
 - Okay, okay, I like to think of myself

523
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:15,600
 as a cantankerous, miserable young man, all right?

524
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,900
 - Also, I think he's quite a nice man.

525
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:19,700
 Actually, he's quite handsome now that I think about it.

526
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,280
 - Yeah, yeah, thank you very much, Ray.

527
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,340
 But this story, it's from a time when Hagel

528
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:27,460
 was the most famous philosopher in the German-speaking world.

529
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:30,340
 And Schopenhauer was just some punk kid.

530
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:32,100
 You know, he was in his 20s, I think,

531
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,940
 or maybe, no, maybe early 30s, but he was young.

532
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:37,820
 And it was him who wanted the rivalry.

533
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:40,900
 Like, Hagel made no reference ever in his life

534
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:41,740
 to Schopenhauer.

535
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,260
 Schopenhauer is constantly writing about

536
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,660
 how much he hates Hagel.

537
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,580
 And it was all about his main work,

538
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,100
 the world as Will and representation.

539
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,700
 It was about his magnum opus.

540
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,500
 - Yeah, it's so-- - And no one, no one cares.

541
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,500
 When you read about him on page, to me,

542
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,460
 it's like reading a biography of Larry David.

543
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,820
 Like, he tries all these little schemes.

544
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:03,220
 And I wonder if maybe in real life, it was funnier.

545
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:06,300
 'Cause if you read Curb Your Enthusiasm on page,

546
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,140
 that's not funny.

547
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:10,220
 That's a contankerous, horrible, repulsive man, right?

548
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:12,260
 But in real life, he's amazing.

549
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:15,540
 He largely drew his philosophy from Eastern religion, right?

550
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,260
 Like, so Buddhism and so on.

551
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:19,180
 And so in his apartment in Frankfurt,

552
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:22,980
 he had a large black lacquered bronze statue

553
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,820
 of the Buddha sitting there.

554
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:27,140
 And he told a friend that he positioned it

555
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:28,260
 so that every morning,

556
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:30,180
 when the morning sun came through the window,

557
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:34,180
 it would bounce off it and put an annoying beam of light

558
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:36,100
 into the apartment across from him,

559
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,700
 which belonged to a pastor who he didn't like,

560
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:41,300
 just so it would piss him off every day.

561
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,900
 That's Larry David.

562
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,940
 - Really, you wouldn't wanna live next star

563
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,660
 to Schopenhauer, would you?

564
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,900
 One of the things he hated was noise.

565
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:51,260
 You can imagine, if you had a little party,

566
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:53,140
 even if you finished it by 9 p.m.,

567
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:55,100
 he'd be round banging on the door.

568
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,060
 - Yeah, do you know what?

569
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,060
 People need their sleep.

570
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:58,900
 Some people go to bed nice and early.

571
00:21:58,900 --> 00:21:59,740
 - You know what, Andy?

572
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:02,300
 I know that you don't like loud noise very much

573
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,820
 and loud music and stuff.

574
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:04,820
 Schopenhauer once said,

575
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:07,940
 "The amount of noise which anyone can bear undisturbed

576
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:11,460
 "stands in inverse proportion to his mental capacity."

577
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:15,260
 - That makes me the cleverest man alive, I think.

578
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:17,180
 If I've understood it.

579
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:19,060
 - I've never been round to Andy's place,

580
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:22,500
 but I'm imagining that sort of a series of statues

581
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:25,620
 carefully positioned so the sun ricochets around

582
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,620
 until it hits all the enemy's eye.

583
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,260
 (laughing)

584
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:31,460
 - But he's clearly unbelievably,

585
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:33,420
 reading about actually both of these guys,

586
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,260
 Hegel and Schopenhauer,

587
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,860
 you just think these people are so unbelievably clever.

588
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:41,380
 And the beef was kind of because Hegel's view of the world

589
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:43,500
 was that humanity had arrived

590
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,220
 at the age of self-consciousness.

591
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:47,300
 He had this big lecture about the world history,

592
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:50,740
 which he claimed that Europe is the absolute end of history.

593
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:53,460
 The spirit of the world was the zeitgeist in it.

594
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,620
 It was reaching its perfect final form.

595
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:56,940
 Everything was getting better.

596
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,460
 And Schopenhauer rejected that.

597
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,220
 Hegel was basically, "Things can only get better."

598
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:02,260
 And Schopenhauer said, "We're not becoming anything.

599
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:04,220
 "We remain the same.

600
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:06,260
 "We go in these big historical cycles."

601
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:08,660
 - It was, I mean, really basically,

602
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,980
 it's like optimism versus pessimism, wasn't it?

603
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:14,980
 Hegel was very much sunlight and rainbows and unicorns

604
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:18,100
 and Schopenhauer was, "I fucking hate unicorns."

605
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,420
 - Yeah, yeah.

606
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,580
 Which team are you on, Ray?

607
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:23,220
 If you had the option of those two lectures,

608
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:25,180
 you know, your time traveled back to there.

609
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:29,180
 - I think my inkling is to go towards Schopenhauer,

610
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:31,460
 but I really would not want him

611
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:33,380
 to have somebody at his lecture.

612
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,700
 I think then, I don't,

613
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:37,740
 I basically want to preserve his loser status.

614
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:40,180
 I think it would corrupt his whole legacy

615
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:42,580
 if people were actually paying attention to him at the time.

616
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:46,340
 - I think Hegel's lectures were not the most fun.

617
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:49,340
 I think he was very difficult to understand.

618
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:52,860
 His students said that every third sentence

619
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:55,380
 he said began with "therefore."

620
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:58,380
 So you can imagine this sort of German lecturer going,

621
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:01,300
 "Therefore, therefore, therefore."

622
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,140
 - Yes, I was gonna say,

623
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:04,700
 I think one of the reasons Schopenhauer hated Hegel

624
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,580
 was for his dense way of writing

625
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:09,140
 and he was obscure and hard to understand.

626
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:11,620
 I don't want to take sides in the dispute,

627
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:14,740
 but I did find there's a famous explainer

628
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:17,540
 of one of Hegel's most prominent works,

629
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:21,700
 and it's over three times longer than Hegel's actual work.

630
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:22,540
 So...

631
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:26,140
 - Hey, Ray Watts, you said at the start

632
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:29,300
 that this isn't what you know most about in philosophy.

633
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,420
 What's your era?

634
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,540
 Who's your philosopher?

635
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:34,140
 - Well, my favorite was actually Manuel Kantz,

636
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:37,300
 who was the one that inspired both Hegel and Schopenhauer,

637
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,940
 but they took him in different directions.

638
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:43,380
 And then what my thesis ended up being about was free will.

639
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:45,980
 That was the main thing I ended up writing about.

640
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,620
 - The movie about the whale?

641
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,460
 - Mm.

642
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:50,540
 - What a pivot.

643
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:53,860
 - Sadly, I wrote the sequel.

644
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:58,340
 There was my was free will to the much less popular

645
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:01,100
 straight to DVD philosophical thesis.

646
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,540
 - The whale can escape,

647
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,300
 but will he ever truly be free?

648
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:07,300
 - Do I have free will always?

649
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:09,220
 - Do I force to make that terrible joke?

650
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:14,420
 - I think knowing you as entirely within your genes

651
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:16,020
 and environment that you were compelled,

652
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:18,180
 there was no choice for you.

653
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:24,540
 - We've not mentioned one big part of Schopenhauer's studies,

654
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:28,260
 which is the time he became a paranormal investigator.

655
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,100
 - Oh, here we go.

656
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:32,220
 - It's a surprisingly big bit of his life,

657
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:33,540
 and he wrote about it quite a lot,

658
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:36,780
 which is that he had a very weird moment

659
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,100
 where he woke up one morning

660
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:41,660
 and he saw his mom and dad standing in front of him

661
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,220
 as an apparition.

662
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:44,860
 So his dad was dead,

663
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:46,300
 bit weirder 'cause his mom was still alive,

664
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,900
 so not sure what she was doing there, but.

665
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,780
 - His mom was just over for a visit.

666
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:52,220
 I thought the most terrible thing

667
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:54,140
 I've ever heard before in my life.

668
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,780
 - Yeah, and so he sort of thought,

669
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:56,740
 I wonder what that is.

670
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:59,180
 And he was working as a large part of his work

671
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:01,060
 that metaphysics would explain

672
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:03,060
 why people were seeing weird things.

673
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:05,340
 He didn't properly believe in ghosts himself,

674
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:07,420
 but he did think all of these experiences,

675
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:10,180
 telepathy, all that stuff, premonitions,

676
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:12,140
 something might be tied in.

677
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:15,180
 So it made it part of his philosophical investigations.

678
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:16,860
 - How cool. - It's got to be a nightmare

679
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,780
 if you hate other human beings,

680
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:21,260
 and then you start getting visited by ghosts as well.

681
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:22,100
 You're either--

682
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,220
 (all laughing)

683
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:25,060
 - This is exactly what I didn't want.

684
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:28,820
 He was really interested in sacred Hindu texts as well.

685
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:32,180
 That was a big part of his life and his philosophy.

686
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:34,220
 So all of his poodles,

687
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:36,180
 he was a big poodle fancier.

688
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,140
 All of his poodles were called atman,

689
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:41,380
 which is the Sanskrit word, meaning your true self.

690
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:43,260
 - Why would you call all your dogs the same name?

691
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,700
 That doesn't make any sense.

692
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,260
 - It means you only have one thing to shout in the park,

693
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:49,340
 and then all the dogs will come back, you know.

694
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:50,980
 - Okay, I see that. - He's ingenious.

695
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,820
 See, he was the cleverest man in life.

696
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:56,180
 And his bedtime reading every night was a few pages of,

697
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,380
 this is when I thought,

698
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:59,540
 okay, this guy's a cut above intellectually.

699
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:03,220
 It was the Latin translation of the Upanishads,

700
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,780
 the sacred Hindu text, the Upanishads.

701
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:06,820
 It was the Latin translation of that.

702
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:07,900
 Every night before going to bed,

703
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,260
 he would just read a few pages

704
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,980
 to help himself drift off to sleep.

705
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:13,180
 And he said, "It has been the consolation of my life

706
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:15,260
 and will be that of my death."

707
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:20,180
 You know, he was just an extremely polymathic guy effectively.

708
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,780
 - Well, that was someone said in writing

709
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:25,700
 about his understanding of the Upanishads

710
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:29,140
 and general Hindu philosophy is that he was reading

711
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:31,900
 these sort of put together Latin translations

712
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,580
 that lost a lot about it, a mistranslation almost,

713
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:35,660
 not quite a mistranslation,

714
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:37,980
 but one step away from the meanings

715
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:40,580
 that were properly captured in the original writings.

716
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:41,740
 - That's really interesting.

717
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:44,060
 - It just suited what he was trying to build.

718
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:47,140
 - That's quite similar to Zen Buddhism in the West,

719
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:50,940
 which was, it came over when a guy went over to Japan

720
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,540
 and he spent a lot of time

721
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:54,660
 with this really famous Zen Buddhist.

722
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:56,180
 And he didn't speak Japanese

723
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:57,940
 and the Buddhist didn't speak any English.

724
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:00,020
 And so they went through a translator.

725
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:02,500
 And the translator just basically told him

726
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,060
 what he wanted to hear.

727
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:07,260
 'Cause the Zen Buddhist guy was quite old by that stage.

728
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,340
 He was repeating himself.

729
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:10,420
 He was talking quite a lot of nonsense.

730
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:13,420
 And then this guy would say, "Oh yeah, what he's saying

731
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:16,500
 is that you need to become one with the world

732
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,420
 and whatever."

733
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:19,900
 But actually never said any of that stuff.

734
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,220
 - Give all your dogs one name.

735
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:22,480
 Give them all one name.

736
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,580
 (all laughing)

737
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:28,100
 - Schopenhauer, he wrote about the feeling

738
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:30,060
 that people had after sex.

739
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:30,900
 - Oh.

740
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:33,420
 - He wrote that directly after copulation,

741
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,860
 the devil's laughter is heard.

742
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:39,220
 - Oh, who's been laughing this whole time?

743
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,220
 I was just wondering.

744
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,820
 (all laughing)

745
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:45,620
 - It's always better that it's the devil laughing,

746
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:46,500
 really, isn't it?

747
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,300
 (all laughing)

748
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,740
 - So this all comes back to Galen,

749
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:54,380
 the famous guy who wrote about medicine and stuff.

750
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:57,780
 He wrote that every animal is sad after colitis,

751
00:28:57,780 --> 00:29:00,140
 except the human female and the rooster.

752
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:02,180
 - You know, we don't pitch the Schopenhauer fact,

753
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:04,020
 this is not where I originally would be.

754
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:07,220
 (all laughing)

755
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:12,140
 - We should say A-Shops was a massive sexist.

756
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:14,540
 I mean, I was reading his work and I was thinking,

757
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:16,340
 "Yeah, I'm jamming with this guy."

758
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:19,300
 And then I read his views on women.

759
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,420
 "They are big children all their life long

760
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,900
 and undersized, narrow-shouldered, broad-hipped

761
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,060
 and short-legged race.

762
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,700
 They have no proper knowledge of anything

763
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,260
 and they have no genius."

764
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,140
 And I thought, "I'm gonna back off, okay."

765
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:30,980
 - Yeah.

766
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:33,420
 - So did you say that he said women are bigger children?

767
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:35,660
 Because, I mean, so are men.

768
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:37,540
 That's what being an adult is, isn't it?

769
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:38,460
 (all laughing)

770
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:41,220
 He's been a bigger child.

771
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:45,860
 He was very dedicated to slagging off the other philosophers.

772
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:50,220
 He once wrote an essay that was awarded first prize

773
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:53,340
 in a competition by the Royal Norwegian Society

774
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:55,420
 of Sciences and Letters.

775
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:58,540
 And so then next year, he submitted another essay

776
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:01,380
 and this essay did not win the awards,

777
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:04,580
 even though it was the sole submission.

778
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:08,100
 (all laughing)

779
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,860
 And the reason it was rejected is a part

780
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:14,740
 because he kept disrespecting other philosophers.

781
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:17,020
 And I think to be fair, if you are writing an essay

782
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,220
 on morality, you probably should have

783
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:20,220
 been slagging off the other philosophers.

784
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:22,820
 - Yeah, that's so funny.

785
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:25,540
 That's like, there was a study that was done

786
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:28,940
 amongst UK scientists and one of the findings at the end

787
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:33,300
 was that most scientists don't like Richard Dawkins.

788
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:36,180
 But what they were being asked about had nothing to do

789
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:37,020
 with Richard Dawkins.

790
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:39,500
 That just came up as everyone slagging him off

791
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,700
 as part of their response.

792
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:43,380
 And they were like, "Well, here's an unintended bit

793
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,820
 of data that we've discovered."

794
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:45,740
 (all laughing)

795
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:46,580
 Yeah, yeah, he did.

796
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:47,820
 He slag even in his books, right?

797
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:50,260
 Even in his main, that main one.

798
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:51,180
 What was it called, by the way?

799
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:52,020
 - The Will.

800
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,980
 - The World as Will and Representation.

801
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,260
 - Yeah, even in the main one,

802
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:57,540
 the Will is World and Representation.

803
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:58,740
 Will is, say it again.

804
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:01,100
 - The World as Will and Representation.

805
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,980
 It's not, actually, it did not take off.

806
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:04,300
 Part of the reason it didn't take off

807
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:06,700
 was he didn't call it big things.

808
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:10,540
 - I just love the idea of Dad going to a year of lectures

809
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:13,540
 and still can't get the title of his work.

810
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:14,380
 - Any questions?

811
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:15,820
 Yes, Dan, again.

812
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:20,660
 No, it's the World as Will and Representation.

813
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:23,340
 - Okay, so where there's a world,

814
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,140
 there's a will of representation.

815
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:26,420
 - Where there's a world, there's a way.

816
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:27,820
 That would have been better.

817
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:29,060
 That would have been better.

818
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:30,460
 - I imagine if I was the time traveler

819
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:33,340
 that went back and sat, it was like sitting on the ground.

820
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:34,180
 - So what?

821
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:36,180
 - What does he think of me in the year 2025?

822
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:37,340
 - We love your work.

823
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:39,400
 Where will he, for you, will he?

824
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,980
 (all laughing)

825
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:45,980
 - We need to wrap up in a sec,

826
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,220
 but Ray, you're going to be in Edinburgh.

827
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,060
 This is very exciting.

828
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:49,540
 You're coming across the ocean,

829
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:50,620
 halfway across the world.

830
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:51,700
 Where are you going to be playing?

831
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:52,540
 What's the show?

832
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:55,260
 - Yes, I'm going to be at the Pleasants Courtyard

833
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:59,940
 at 6.05 p.m. every day, except for one Monday.

834
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:00,780
 I forget which one.

835
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,420
 So hopefully that's not the only day

836
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:05,660
 I'm currently in Edinburgh for the entire Fringe Festival.

837
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:09,140
 And the show's called Laughter I Hardly Knower.

838
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:10,620
 So yeah, please come along.

839
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:13,700
 (all laughing)

840
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,060
 - Really a title.

841
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:17,640
 (upbeat music)

842
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,840
 - Okay, it's time for fact number three,

843
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:23,720
 and that is Andrew O'Neill.

844
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:27,440
 - My fact is that the first band to call themselves punk

845
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,800
 didn't use guitars.

846
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,640
 - What?

847
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:34,280
 - Which is counter-intuitive because we think of,

848
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,680
 you know, biker jackets, spiky hair, guitars,

849
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,720
 but the first bands to actually call themselves punk

850
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,560
 were Suicide.

851
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:43,800
 So Suicide were a kind of art noise duo in New York.

852
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,040
 Martin Revere and Alan Vaid.

853
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:48,560
 And they used synths and drum machines

854
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:52,480
 and created a wonderful sort of sleazy,

855
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:56,560
 uncomfortable, aggressive noise.

856
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:59,680
 So I'm constantly fascinated with the history

857
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:02,440
 and the kind of taxonomy of music.

858
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,640
 So with punk, punk was used as an insult.

859
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,000
 You know, it was seen as putting them down

860
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,120
 and then Suicide were the first band to kind of lean into it.

861
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,880
 But punk in its origins was so much wider

862
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:15,720
 as a genre and so much more experimental

863
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:19,720
 and kind of arty than the dudes with loud guitars.

864
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,560
 - Yeah, right.

865
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,600
 I read an interview with these guys from Suicide

866
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,600
 and they said that they did have a guitar at the very start

867
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,760
 before they became Suicide

868
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,640
 when they were just sort of starting out.

869
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,480
 - Right.

870
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,640
 - But the guitar player decided to leave

871
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,440
 and they realized that actually he wasn't really

872
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,760
 contributing very much anyway.

873
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,920
 So that's why they did without him.

874
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:38,040
 - I listened to the album this morning,

875
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,760
 their debut album in New York.

876
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:43,200
 The album this morning, their debut album in 1977.

877
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,320
 And it's noise and it's interesting

878
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:49,400
 and it's wild lyrically.

879
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:53,160
 There's an amazing song which is called "Frankie Teardrop"

880
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:56,000
 and it's a song that's been cited by quite a lot of people

881
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 as an influential song.

882
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,760
 So Nick Hornby wrote a book called "31 Songs"

883
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,400
 where he picked 31 songs that have altered his life

884
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,040
 in some ways and he says it's a song

885
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,840
 that you should only hear once

886
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,440
 'cause it's just too intense.

887
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,560
 And it is really intense.

888
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,120
 It's a story of a guy who goes home,

889
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:12,760
 he kills his family and then you follow his own death

890
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,640
 and then his journey into hell.

891
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16,560
 And it's just this soundscape of noise.

892
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,120
 And it's horrific but hugely influential.

893
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:22,200
 "Springsteen" was influenced by this.

894
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:25,480
 Yeah, like a lot of people were influenced by suicide

895
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,320
 that you would not expect.

896
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,400
 - Actually, I don't prove "Springsteen" songs

897
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,160
 like a lot more depressing than people make out.

898
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:33,720
 Like "Born in the USA" is about someone

899
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:36,400
 being really disheartened about America after the war.

900
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,440
 - Oh yeah.

901
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,600
 Yeah, a lot of his songs are about rough living

902
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:43,800
 and suffering and a very downbeat in their meaning.

903
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,560
 But if the music doesn't sound like that.

904
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:49,120
 - Isn't it true that a lot of politicians use "Born in the USA"

905
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,760
 as like their big sort of America fuck yeah kind of thing?

906
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,280
 - Nationalistic flag waving kind of thing.

907
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:57,160
 It's exactly the opposite of that, which is true.

908
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,880
 Isn't it pretty much any artist

909
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,960
 that gets co-opted by a politician will go,

910
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,120
 you've not really paid attention to the lyrics.

911
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,160
 - Andrew, you're doing a whole show

912
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,160
 about the history of punk.

913
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,880
 So is this your opinion

914
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,960
 that they're sort of the first punk band?

915
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,920
 Or is that agreed?

916
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,440
 - Not that they're the first punk band,

917
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,360
 but they're the first band to call themselves punk.

918
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,200
 - Right.

919
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,040
 - Because there's a thing that happens, isn't there,

920
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,480
 with sort of genres where before a genre gets named,

921
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,160
 it can be quite amorphous.

922
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:25,400
 The meaning isn't kind of ossified yet.

923
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:28,520
 So I would argue the first punk band was the Stooges,

924
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,840
 Iggy Pop and the Stooges.

925
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,680
 - Okay.

926
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:34,160
 - Do you find, Andrew, that when people get put

927
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,400
 into those categories,

928
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,440
 then they start sort of living up towards it.

929
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,280
 - Absolutely right.

930
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,080
 - So if people call you a death metal band,

931
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,760
 then your next three albums

932
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,480
 are just going to be heavier and heavier.

933
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,320
 - That's absolutely it.

934
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:48,080
 And also there's a thing where people start to form bands

935
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,960
 based on the tax on it.

936
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:52,120
 So basically the map becomes the territory.

937
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,400
 So you put a thing out saying,

938
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,000
 I want to form a thrash band.

939
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
 You kind of already know what that's going to sound like.

940
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,920
 - That suicide album, the 1977 one,

941
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:03,360
 was described as taxi driver, the musical.

942
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,920
 - Yeah, I think it is.

943
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,520
 Which I think suits it quite nicely.

944
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:09,760
 - And they toured with the Clash.

945
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,600
 - Right.

946
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,520
 - And Clash fans universally hated them

947
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,280
 because they wanted a band that sounded like the Clash.

948
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,640
 And they got a band that sounded like

949
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:21,600
 stoned, speed freak Elvis,

950
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,760
 playing over horrible keyboards and drum machine.

951
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,400
 - Do you know on the Clash,

952
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,520
 so Mick Jones as founder of Clash, I think,

953
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:33,800
 and was league guitarist and his first cousin.

954
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,200
 Do you know who his first cousin is?

955
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:39,080
 - Oh, not Davy Jones from Tom Jones.

956
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,320
 - It's not a Jones, sorry.

957
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,600
 I fled you up the garden path.

958
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,040
 - It's a tough one to guess.

959
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,360
 - It's a really tough one to guess.

960
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,800
 Basically what I'm telling you is the Clash are,

961
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,760
 you know, punk, very, very cool.

962
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,320
 This guy, not cool.

963
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,160
 Look, shall I tell you?

964
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,680
 - Is it Jacob Rees-Mogg?

965
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,000
 - You're so close.

966
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:54,840
 Oh my God, Dan.

967
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,440
 You're in the right political party.

968
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,280
 You're in the right era.

969
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,480
 - Oh, is it David Davis?

970
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,320
 - You're close.

971
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,640
 - Grant Shaps.

972
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:02,480
 - Grant Shaps.

973
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:06,680
 - Grant Shaps is first cousins with the Clash.

974
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:09,040
 - Grant Shaps was used by Alan Partridge

975
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,480
 to denote someone that's absolutely,

976
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,040
 totally middle of the road page.

977
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,760
 - Exactly, I'm afraid.

978
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:17,280
 And in fact, his brother is called Andre,

979
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,760
 and he's in a band called Big Audio Dynamite

980
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,320
 with Mick Jones, who's, you know, Clash guy.

981
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,160
 - Still going.

982
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,000
 - So there you go.

983
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:24,840
 Cooler than you thought, Grant Shaps.

984
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,800
 - Cooler, yeah, that's amazing.

985
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,760
 - As if that could be possible.

986
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,600
 - I know.

987
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,640
 - It's strange, isn't it?

988
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:34,160
 Because, you know, there's that thing of like,

989
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,320
 so many people in there.

990
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,880
 So Joe Strummer went to private school.

991
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:41,120
 Like, the idea that someone who went to,

992
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:44,000
 like actually a public school could be in a punk band.

993
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,760
 In the 80s would have been incredible,

994
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,040
 but it was absolutely what happened,

995
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,480
 that kind of flourishing of bringing people together.

996
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,200
 I mean, the Bromley contingents,

997
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,240
 so Suzie Sue and others.

998
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:56,560
 Yeah, they were very definitely suburban middle class.

999
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:00,920
 It wasn't sort of street based as it kind of came to be seen.

1000
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,400
 There are so many contradictions in it.

1001
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,160
 Like, I mean, the young ones, the most punk TV show,

1002
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,120
 nearly everybody involved in that is privately educated.

1003
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,640
 - Yeah, they absolutely are, aren't they?

1004
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,120
 - Yeah, you're so true.

1005
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,800
 When you sent over this fact,

1006
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,840
 I started looking into guitars.

1007
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:19,040
 I realized I didn't know much about the history of guitars.

1008
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,720
 And one thing that I got really excited by was,

1009
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,440
 in the early days, let's say,

1010
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,040
 around the time of the Beatles,

1011
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:28,400
 guitar chords were a bit more secretive, it seems.

1012
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,960
 And I didn't know that.

1013
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,720
 So there's this amazing story.

1014
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,160
 - Amazing Paul McCartney story.

1015
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,960
 - Yeah, so there's a great McCartney and Lennon story

1016
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:38,280
 where they heard in Liverpool

1017
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,760
 that there was someone who was a crosstown

1018
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:43,400
 who knew the chord B7.

1019
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:46,520
 And they got on the bus and they traveled all the way

1020
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:49,280
 and they met him and they said, "Show us B7."

1021
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,080
 And he showed them and they said it was a turning point

1022
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,720
 for their composition and kind of was part of

1023
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,360
 how the Beatles became the Beatles.

1024
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,200
 It was the Lost Chord, he called it.

1025
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,680
 And they went back home, they showed everyone B7

1026
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,000
 and they spread it around.

1027
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,760
 And I thought, "That sounds ridiculous."

1028
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:07,160
 But when you read into the early days of guitar,

1029
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:09,000
 if you were an amazing guitarist,

1030
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,280
 you'd kind of clasp onto what you were able to do.

1031
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,800
 So there was a guy who was known as the king

1032
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,120
 in jazz guitaring called Freddie Keppard.

1033
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,160
 And Freddie Keppard had a picking style

1034
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,400
 that was so unique that when he went on stage,

1035
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,560
 he used to put a handkerchief over his picking hand

1036
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:27,080
 so that no one could see the magic going on underneath.

1037
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,600
 - 'Cause I can't play guitar,

1038
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,880
 so the analogy I can make is with piano.

1039
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,680
 And the idea of having a new piano chord,

1040
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,600
 like I could just bash some keys together

1041
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:37,160
 that don't sound very good and say I've made a new one.

1042
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:39,520
 But was B7 something that sounded amazing

1043
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,800
 and no one had discovered this combination of notes?

1044
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,000
 - It sort of just doesn't make sense, Anna,

1045
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,800
 because it's quite, it's a simplicity chord, yeah.

1046
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,080
 - But it does fit really well

1047
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:50,440
 with the other easy to play cards, isn't it?

1048
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,440
 - It's in the same area of the guitar.

1049
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,760
 There's not much change.

1050
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,520
 - We just hadn't discovered it sounded good.

1051
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,360
 - No, we knew it.

1052
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,640
 - It exists in music.

1053
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,480
 - Yeah.

1054
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,640
 - Oh, so they'll just pull and John didn't know it.

1055
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:00,480
 - Yeah, yeah.

1056
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,320
 - Yeah, they will have heard it,

1057
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,680
 but not known where to put their fingers to get that sound.

1058
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:05,680
 - Yeah.

1059
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,680
 - I think also, Anna, like you say,

1060
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,080
 I could just bash the keys and get something.

1061
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:12,840
 I used to think that if, 'cause I'm terrible at drawing,

1062
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,960
 I thought if I just draw enough times,

1063
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:18,360
 eventually my lines will turn into something beautiful.

1064
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:20,280
 But it doesn't quite work like that for some reason.

1065
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,040
 - I had exactly the same approach to the guitar.

1066
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,440
 Someone told me early on

1067
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,120
 that Hendrix didn't know what notes he was playing.

1068
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,280
 And that's a lie.

1069
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,800
 (both laughing)

1070
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,240
 'Cause Hendrix was a session musician.

1071
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,360
 Hendrix on the chilling circuit.

1072
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,600
 Hendrix played for absolutely everyone.

1073
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,720
 He played for Little Richard.

1074
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:36,280
 He played for, you know, he backed so many bands.

1075
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,520
 And you can't do that without knowing what key you're in

1076
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,960
 and what, literally, what notes you're playing.

1077
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,960
 So I absolutely had, James, I had exactly the same thing.

1078
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,680
 But if I just keep playing, eventually I'll put a note.

1079
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:49,800
 And then I'm now like 30 years odd later,

1080
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,080
 starting to learn some theory and going,

1081
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,440
 "Oh, this makes it so much better."

1082
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,400
 (both laughing)

1083
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,240
 But there's that thing.

1084
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,280
 When I've got my, I can actually,

1085
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,720
 I can actually demonstrate.

1086
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:02,840
 It, you know, it just sounds so, so D, D7.

1087
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:07,760
 It adds so much texture and kind of emotion to it.

1088
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,680
 But the other thing about the Beatles

1089
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,800
 was that they were one of the first,

1090
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,800
 well, they're basically the first band

1091
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,280
 to make writing their own music the thing within pop music.

1092
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,360
 That's like the mind-blowing thing,

1093
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,040
 Elvis didn't write his songs.

1094
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:19,880
 - Yeah.

1095
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:22,840
 - Paul McCartney, who famously did write his songs.

1096
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:25,680
 His guitar flies first class.

1097
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,120
 He books it his own seat.

1098
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,480
 I wanna know how the booking works.

1099
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,600
 'Cause when you're on EasyJet,

1100
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,120
 you have to put in passport details

1101
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:34,040
 and I don't believe it has a passport.

1102
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:37,000
 But BB King actually used to fly his guitar as well.

1103
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:37,840
 - Lucille.

1104
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,280
 - In its own, in its own playing.

1105
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,960
 Yeah, Lucille, was that what the guitar was called?

1106
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:41,800
 - Yeah.

1107
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,760
 - King's guitar's called Lucille.

1108
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,480
 - That's insane because he didn't book it

1109
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,640
 under the name Lucille.

1110
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:48,040
 He booked it under the name Mr. Guitar.

1111
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,240
 (laughing)

1112
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:52,000
 Well, that's when Elton John books into a hotel.

1113
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,080
 You don't give your real name.

1114
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:55,120
 You don't want people knowing Lucille's on the plane.

1115
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,200
 They might see it. - No, good point.

1116
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,400
 - It's a pseudonym.

1117
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,360
 He named it Lucille apparently

1118
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:02,520
 because he had to rescue one of his guitars

1119
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:05,440
 from a fire in a building that was started by two men

1120
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,640
 having a fight over a woman called Lucille.

1121
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:08,480
 - Really?

1122
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,160
 - Yeah, so that's where that name comes from.

1123
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,520
 Angus Young called his the workhorse,

1124
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:15,600
 what does call it, Willie Nelson's is trigger.

1125
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,160
 They've all got their nicknames for them.

1126
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,000
 - That's very sweet.

1127
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,280
 - Willie Nelson's trigger guitar.

1128
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,080
 He replaced the neck eight times and the body three times.

1129
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:24,360
 (laughing)

1130
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,920
 - Hey, do you know the Eminem song, My Name Is?

1131
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,800
 I mean, who doesn't, what a stupid question.

1132
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,680
 There's a guitar and bass part in that,

1133
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:32,720
 like one of the really familiar bits you'd recognise.

1134
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:33,560
 - Yeah.

1135
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:36,040
 - Do you know who plays the guitar and bass on that?

1136
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:36,880
 - Oh, Andrew.

1137
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:37,720
 - Yeah, Andrew knows it.

1138
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:38,760
 - Chaz and Dave, isn't it?

1139
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,400
 - It's Chaz and Dave.

1140
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,360
 It's so cool.

1141
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:43,000
 - So who were Chaz and Dave?

1142
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,080
 I know their names, but I don't fully know what they were.

1143
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:48,960
 They were like Cockney, they made like Cockney songs.

1144
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:49,800
 - Rockney.

1145
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:50,640
 - Yeah.

1146
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,240
 - Chaz and Dave were session musicians

1147
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:54,720
 and they played with absolutely everyone

1148
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:55,960
 and they were incredible musicians.

1149
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:58,640
 And what they decided they wanted to do was,

1150
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,280
 the big thing was they wanted to do rock and roll

1151
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:02,760
 in their own accent because every British band

1152
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:05,120
 that did rock and roll adopted an American accent

1153
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:07,560
 and Chaz Hodges' big thing was he wanted to write

1154
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,720
 a love song in his own accent.

1155
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,120
 So they came up with this thing, Rockney.

1156
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,880
 And I, I mean, I adore Chaz and Dave.

1157
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,440
 I unironically love them.

1158
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:16,720
 - I was on tour in New Zealand

1159
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:19,200
 and when you do New Zealand, you're already homesick

1160
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,000
 and New Zealand feels like the end of the world

1161
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,120
 'cause of the way it sticks out into the Pacific.

1162
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:26,680
 And one of the other comics I was getting was Terry Alderton.

1163
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:28,920
 We were both being homesick and you went, listen to this.

1164
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:32,000
 And it's a Chaz and Dave song called "That's What I Like"

1165
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,320
 and it's just a list.

1166
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:35,760
 It's like the amily of pop music.

1167
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,960
 Cheese and onion sandwiches and Darby China

1168
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,600
 where whittles and jigs are wooing me,

1169
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:40,920
 dogging me on if I haven't a swear.

1170
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,800
 It's absolutely gorgeous.

1171
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,760
 Like, I completely unironically love them.

1172
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:45,600
 - Yeah, amazing.

1173
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:46,440
 - They are cracking.

1174
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:49,440
 - So they weren't in the studio with Eminem though, right?

1175
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:50,560
 This was a sample, presumably.

1176
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:51,480
 - No, it was a sample.

1177
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:52,320
 - Okay.

1178
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:53,160
 - Yeah.

1179
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:54,000
 - Okay.

1180
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,040
 - Okay, punks and samples.

1181
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,800
 That takes me to Daft Punk.

1182
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,040
 - Uh-huh.

1183
00:43:59,040 --> 00:43:59,880
 - The band Daft Punk.

1184
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:03,520
 So there is a species that has been discovered

1185
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:08,200
 known as by Kallelia Daft Punka, okay?

1186
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:09,960
 It's a type of flatworm.

1187
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:12,000
 And do you know why it got that name?

1188
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,800
 Is it, does it wear hoods, masks over its face all the time?

1189
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,280
 - I like, yeah, like a big helmet.

1190
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:17,120
 - Yeah.

1191
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:17,960
 - You're close enough.

1192
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:18,800
 I'll let you have it.

1193
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,800
 And it has a helmet-shaped structure

1194
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,960
 on the end of its penis.

1195
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:23,800
 - Okay.

1196
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,120
 - Okay.

1197
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:27,520
 - That's not where they wear theirs, I don't think.

1198
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,320
 - I like to think that Daft Punk,

1199
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:30,720
 if they tuck their trousers down,

1200
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,520
 they would have the same helmets.

1201
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,120
 - They do.

1202
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:36,120
 - So you can't identify them by their penis.

1203
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:36,960
 - They're just so fractal

1204
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,120
 and then on a cellular level, they're helmets.

1205
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:40,880
 (laughing)

1206
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,640
 - It's helmets all the way down.

1207
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:43,480
 - Yeah.

1208
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:46,640
 Do you know who Daft Punk were very influenced by?

1209
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:47,480
 - Suicide.

1210
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:48,480
 - Suicide.

1211
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:49,320
 - Were they?

1212
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,520
 - Yeah, they cite, they cite.

1213
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:52,640
 I mean, 'cause if you listen to it, it is,

1214
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,120
 it's electro music, really,

1215
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:56,360
 when you listen to that opening album.

1216
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:59,000
 So yeah, they cite them as influences.

1217
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,600
 Hey, listen, we need to wrap up in a second.

1218
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:05,280
 Andrew, before we do, you're in Edinburgh.

1219
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,600
 - I am, I'm doing two shows, 'cause I'm an idiot.

1220
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,320
 I'm doing two shows and I broke my leg in February,

1221
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:11,220
 so I am behind.

1222
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:14,800
 I'm doing Andrew and Neil's History of Punk

1223
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:17,400
 at Bannermans at 11.30 p.m.,

1224
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:19,400
 and that starts on the 1st of August,

1225
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,960
 right through not doing Mondays or Tuesdays,

1226
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,240
 'cause I'm actually a little bit more sensible

1227
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:24,080
 than I used to be.

1228
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:26,680
 And I'm doing a stand-up show

1229
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:29,960
 that discusses my three-point model of political difference,

1230
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:32,000
 which I think might be the only genuinely original idea

1231
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,120
 I've ever had,

1232
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:37,320
 three ways in which people disagree or are wrong politically,

1233
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:39,560
 and it's got tons of very, very stupid jokes

1234
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:41,120
 and a thing about rhombus,

1235
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:42,280
 and that's could escape,

1236
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:45,920
 and it's on at 7.10 p.m. at Monkey Barrel.

1237
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:48,520
 So yeah, two shows. - Two years was awesome.

1238
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:51,100
 (upbeat music)

1239
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:56,000
 - It's time for our final fact of the show,

1240
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,520
 and that is Ahir Shah.

1241
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:01,480
 - So my fact is that Andrew Carnegie

1242
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:03,200
 tried to achieve world peace

1243
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,600
 by sending countries dinosaurs.

1244
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:09,520
 - Yes, the common enemy.

1245
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,680
 I don't think you get to be like

1246
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:14,360
 that successful and wealthy and industrialist

1247
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:16,840
 without being a bit of an ideas guy.

1248
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:21,640
 And like, are all of them gonna come off necessarily?

1249
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:25,520
 No, but you can say that you did your level best.

1250
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:26,640
 - I think it's a great idea.

1251
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:30,000
 Like, you know, the idea of everyone having nuclear weapons

1252
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,680
 so that no one attacks each other.

1253
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,480
 - Yeah, mutilation of dinosaurs.

1254
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:35,880
 - Yeah, that's perfect.

1255
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:37,880
 And you could make it so like the bigger countries

1256
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:39,080
 have smaller dinosaurs

1257
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:41,120
 and the smaller countries have bigger dinosaurs.

1258
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:43,080
 - Oh, we're being progressive, are we?

1259
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:45,040
 So the Vatican would have to have like

1260
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:48,040
 the largest of titan, it would be as big as the Vatican.

1261
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:52,760
 - So aside from all this absurd reasoning,

1262
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:55,680
 what was the idea behind world peace

1263
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,840
 being created by dinosaur diplomacy?

1264
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:00,440
 - Well, it wasn't necessarily,

1265
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:04,400
 it was another MAD mutually assured Diplodocus

1266
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:07,440
 or however we want to pronounce it, basically.

1267
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,480
 I'm sure that many, if not most of the listeners

1268
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:13,680
 will have seen Dippy, the famous skeleton

1269
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:16,160
 in the Natural History Museum, right?

1270
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:20,120
 And basically the idea was that in 1899,

1271
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:23,360
 the original sort of Dippy, Dippy's a composite skeleton,

1272
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:26,120
 but the sort of main part of it was found in Wyoming

1273
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:30,240
 on a expedition that had been sponsored by Carnegie.

1274
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:33,280
 Now, this is like something no one's ever seen before, right?

1275
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,960
 This is gonna change the game in a huge way.

1276
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:38,320
 And a couple of years later,

1277
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:43,320
 King Edward goes up to Carnegie's castle in Scotland

1278
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:47,920
 and sees just like a picture of the Dippy skeleton.

1279
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:50,880
 I was like, oh, it'd be great to have something like that

1280
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,640
 for the Natural History Museum.

1281
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:57,240
 And Carnegie really rolls with this.

1282
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:58,840
 And I believe like at his own expense,

1283
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:01,960
 like commissions a guy to do a plaster cast of it,

1284
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:03,040
 the guy's initially just like,

1285
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:04,720
 no, I don't want to do that.

1286
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:08,120
 It's massive, like no one's ever attempted to do anything

1287
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:09,200
 on this scale before.

1288
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:12,520
 But sure enough, it ends up in the Natural History Museum

1289
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:13,360
 and to great fanfare,

1290
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:15,680
 millions of people have seen this for the first time.

1291
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:18,640
 And I guess Carnegie gets it into his head

1292
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:22,600
 that this is something about scientific discovery

1293
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:24,720
 and everyone working together

1294
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:27,040
 and cross national cooperation.

1295
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:29,200
 And so pretty much every year

1296
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,920
 of the first decade of the 1900s,

1297
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:36,000
 he's giving one of these things out to different countries

1298
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,920
 on the understanding that how could we possibly

1299
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:42,720
 fight one another if everyone has a dinosaur?

1300
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:43,560
 You know?

1301
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:45,840
 - A Dippy, that makes perfect sense.

1302
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:48,400
 - Yeah, and so over the course of the first decade

1303
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:51,320
 of the 1900s, we're talking there's one in France,

1304
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:53,880
 in Germany, in Italy, in Russia.

1305
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:56,800
 These didn't work, right?

1306
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:00,360
 And Mr. Carnegie took the beginning

1307
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:03,600
 of the Great War very badly

1308
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:06,560
 because he was basically just like,

1309
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:08,200
 "I gave you all a fucking dinosaur."

1310
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:10,280
 (laughing)

1311
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:12,560
 Like, "Lads, what are we doing?"

1312
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:14,560
 - And he was so upset, wasn't he?

1313
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:16,400
 I mean, I know quite a lot of people were upset

1314
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:17,560
 about the First World War.

1315
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:19,400
 Maybe some people suffered even more than him,

1316
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:21,440
 but a lot of biographies say he sort of died

1317
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,640
 of a broken heart in 1919

1318
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:27,520
 because he was so devastated that his plan hasn't worked

1319
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:29,320
 and World War I happened anyway.

1320
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:30,600
 But he saw the end of the war.

1321
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,760
 He might have lived to friend of the podcast,

1322
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:35,120
 The Treaty of Versailles, if it was 1919,

1323
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:36,160
 'cause that was the year that was signed.

1324
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:37,720
 So that should have given him a new lease of life.

1325
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:40,040
 It's like, "Oh, great, now we can resume the dinosaur

1326
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:40,880
 "with this batch."

1327
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:42,800
 - But then he read the treaty and was like,

1328
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,480
 "This doesn't even mention the dinosaurs, come on."

1329
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,240
 (laughing)

1330
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:48,360
 Like, how do you expect this piece to hold?

1331
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,080
 It should be the Treaty of Velociraptor

1332
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:52,280
 and then everyone's gonna have it.

1333
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:53,200
 - It's so good.

1334
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:56,320
 Because I, so the things I didn't know about this,

1335
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:57,760
 I mean, I didn't know anything about this story.

1336
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:59,640
 I'd only vaguely heard of Andrew Carnegie, to be honest,

1337
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:02,360
 as, you know, the man who sold steel to the world,

1338
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:04,080
 like, made steel, made, you know,

1339
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:05,480
 big American industrialist.

1340
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:07,920
 But he was looking for an exhibit for his museum.

1341
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:08,800
 That's what started all this.

1342
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:12,080
 He had the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh

1343
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:15,480
 and he needed a showstopper and he read in the paper,

1344
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:17,760
 oh, they found this gigantic thing.

1345
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:20,200
 And actually what had been found was a thigh bone.

1346
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:22,840
 So it was, it was just a femur.

1347
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:25,640
 And so he wrote to the director of the museum saying,

1348
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:27,080
 "You must buy this."

1349
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:29,120
 And the museum director was in an awkward spot

1350
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:31,120
 'cause you can't just buy a boat,

1351
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:33,480
 like one bone is not a showstopper for a museum.

1352
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:34,320
 That's rubbish.

1353
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:36,760
 So he said, "Well, we've got to find another one then."

1354
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:38,680
 And he started funding all the expeditions.

1355
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:39,920
 And thank God they found,

1356
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:40,920
 they found, this is very American,

1357
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:43,200
 they found it on the 4th of July.

1358
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,040
 - Did they?

1359
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:44,880
 - They did.

1360
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:45,720
 - Oh, that's nice.

1361
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:46,840
 - It's very American.

1362
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:49,040
 - I bet they didn't, I bet they found it in June

1363
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:52,080
 and they were like, "Zip it, wait a couple of weeks."

1364
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:55,280
 - I was looking at some of these other ones

1365
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:57,520
 that are around the world.

1366
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:00,560
 And for instance, one was donated

1367
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:05,560
 to the paleontological museum in Munich, Germany in 1932

1368
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:09,000
 and wasn't mounted at that, of course,

1369
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,600
 what happens in 1933 in Germany.

1370
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:14,560
 And it's like, guys, if you just do the dinosaur thing,

1371
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:18,160
 it might help, but like everyone goes very extreme

1372
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:20,400
 when they're not doing the dinosaur thing.

1373
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,720
 - Wow, I wonder if anyone's ever made that connection before.

1374
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:23,560
 I love it.

1375
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:24,400
 - Is that why?

1376
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,240
 - Is it perhaps that the dinosaur thing

1377
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:27,920
 is leading up to this war?

1378
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,680
 - Oh, right, okay, yes.

1379
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,880
 - If you've got a couple of kids

1380
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:33,480
 and one of them has an ice cream,

1381
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:35,240
 you think I'm gonna give them all ice creams

1382
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:36,600
 and that'll make them all happy,

1383
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:38,520
 but it really doesn't work like that.

1384
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:40,560
 - Well, 'cause they go, "My ice cream's better than yours."

1385
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:41,720
 You've got the fake ice cream.

1386
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:42,960
 I'm the one with the real one.

1387
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:43,800
 - In precisely.

1388
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:44,640
 - Yeah.

1389
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:46,280
 And in fact, the Natural History Museum

1390
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:49,680
 and British commentators were really sniffy about Dippy.

1391
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:50,960
 They were so rude about him.

1392
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:51,800
 Yeah, they were.

1393
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:54,560
 So the people absolutely loved it,

1394
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:56,680
 but basically all the reviews said,

1395
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:58,200
 "This is a fuss about nothing."

1396
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:00,280
 They wouldn't put Dippy in the paleontology section.

1397
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:03,920
 So Dippy was in the gallery of small reptiles.

1398
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:07,720
 - Watch, stop it, that can't be true.

1399
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:09,400
 - That's right, that's where he was housed,

1400
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:12,160
 feeling pretty out of place, I imagine.

1401
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,760
 And the reviews tended to focus on the fact

1402
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:16,520
 that he wasn't particularly interesting

1403
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:20,120
 because of the size of his brain or her brain, sorry.

1404
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:21,440
 So reviews said things like,

1405
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,560
 "The brain cavity is no bigger than a walnut.

1406
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:25,320
 How can we get excited by this?"

1407
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:27,640
 Dippy's obviously a complete moron.

1408
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:29,760
 One of the, in fact, the guy who accepted it

1409
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:31,800
 on behalf of the Natural History Museum

1410
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:33,960
 in his acceptance speech said,

1411
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:36,360
 "Given that this animal was clearly very stupid,

1412
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:39,520
 the size of it doesn't really add much to the interest."

1413
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:41,640
 So it was this, and I think it was British jealousy

1414
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:44,040
 about the fact that we tended to export our science

1415
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:45,800
 to America in this field,

1416
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:48,040
 and America suddenly waltzed in

1417
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:49,880
 with their big showstopper.

1418
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:51,600
 But fortunately, the people didn't give a shit

1419
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:52,600
 about the size of the brain

1420
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:54,360
 and thousands of people rocked up.

1421
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:57,000
 - And then, of course, Dippy isn't there anymore.

1422
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,800
 If you go to the NHM, it's Big Old Whale.

1423
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:01,960
 They got rid of it in 2017.

1424
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:04,760
 And when did the whole world start going to shit?

1425
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:07,000
 (laughing)

1426
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,920
 - Exactly.

1427
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:10,720
 - Wait, wasn't it 2016?

1428
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:12,320
 - Annad, please. - Sorry, I hate that.

1429
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:13,800
 - They're 65 million years old.

1430
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:14,960
 What's a year here or there?

1431
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:15,800
 Come on.

1432
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:18,040
 (laughing)

1433
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:20,480
 - There is something in this.

1434
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:21,760
 (laughing)

1435
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:23,240
 - Can I say that I just love this so much

1436
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:24,840
 about the thing you mentioned there here

1437
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:26,320
 about King Edward VII,

1438
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:29,000
 and that's when prompted the first cast

1439
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,240
 to be made and dished out.

1440
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:33,280
 So King Edward VII, he'd only been King for a year.

1441
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:36,800
 It was 1902, and he visited Carnegie in Scotland

1442
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,680
 at his home, which is this amazing house

1443
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:40,280
 called Skibo Castle.

1444
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:42,320
 It had things that the world had never seen before,

1445
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:45,000
 like indoor toilets and electricity.

1446
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,640
 Like, it was the equivalent

1447
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:49,320
 of the most amazing space-age house at the time.

1448
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:51,560
 And Edward wanted to see the plumbing

1449
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:53,560
 'cause he wanted to restore all the royal palaces.

1450
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:55,360
 You know, Queen Victoria had been on the throne

1451
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:56,200
 in an incredibly long time.

1452
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:57,600
 They were very dilapidated.

1453
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:58,760
 He was like, "Get out of there!

1454
00:53:58,760 --> 00:53:59,600
 "I need to come!"

1455
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:01,880
 (laughing)

1456
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:04,440
 And so, Edward wanted some of that, basically,

1457
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:05,920
 and that's why he was visiting.

1458
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:08,960
 And the visit happened allegedly at such short notice

1459
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:12,000
 that the organ player for the household,

1460
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,400
 again, if you're very rich, you just have one of these,

1461
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,440
 the organ player was in the swimming pool

1462
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:19,480
 and had to be hurriedly hauled out and towel himself off

1463
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:22,920
 so he could play God Save the King as the king arrived.

1464
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:24,080
 That is the story.

1465
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:26,600
 - And to be fair, as far as Bellina's go,

1466
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:28,520
 he seems like one of the good ones.

1467
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:29,360
 He gets, doesn't he?

1468
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:30,800
 I mean, I'm gonna say this, and next week,

1469
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,720
 it'll come out that he made lots of inappropriate jokes

1470
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:36,080
 to female colleagues, but at this point in time,

1471
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:38,000
 I think we can say Andrew Carnegie,

1472
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,200
 pretty good guy, one of the big 19th century philanthropists

1473
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:42,880
 gave away a huge amount of his money,

1474
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:44,240
 about 90% of his fortune,

1475
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:49,240
 equivalent of $11 billion today to charities and foundations.

1476
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:51,400
 So he really did wanna make the world a better place,

1477
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:52,240
 didn't he?

1478
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:55,200
 - Which of us allows their organ player in the swimming pool?

1479
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,560
 (laughing)

1480
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:59,720
 - I certainly don't, that's a good point.

1481
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:02,440
 - The wars were a bad time for some dinosaurs,

1482
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:05,320
 so Spinosaurus was a dinosaur

1483
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:08,720
 which went extinct about 60-odd million years ago,

1484
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,920
 and then it went extinct for a second time

1485
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:13,880
 during World War II because the British bombed it

1486
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:17,440
 in 1944 to smithereens, so it disappeared,

1487
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:18,800
 and we didn't have it anymore.

1488
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:19,640
 - Really?

1489
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:22,640
 - Yeah, but luckily, it's come to light again

1490
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:24,200
 in the last 20 years or so,

1491
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:26,320
 we've managed to find some more fossils,

1492
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:28,760
 so we got a chance to make it extinct a third time.

1493
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:30,000
 - Yes!

1494
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,840
 - This really reminds me of, did you ever see that headline

1495
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:34,440
 that was something like,

1496
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:38,360
 "Cocaine in the Thames is another thing eels don't need?"

1497
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:40,800
 (laughing)

1498
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:43,160
 - Dinosaurs about to put up with so much.

1499
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:45,080
 - I've already got extinct once, mate.

1500
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:47,360
 (laughing)

1501
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:50,000
 - Do you know, I think maybe this is common knowledge

1502
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,240
 except to me, but dinosaurs were reptiles.

1503
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:54,280
 One of the mad things about dinosaurs

1504
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:56,640
 is we don't know if they were warm-blooded or cold-blooded.

1505
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:57,480
 What?

1506
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:59,560
 That's like so basic a thing to know,

1507
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:01,840
 but dinosaurs count as reptiles,

1508
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:03,680
 all birds are reptiles as well.

1509
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:06,320
 Technically, they're part of this group called diapsida,

1510
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:08,480
 which also includes all other reptiles,

1511
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:10,680
 but we're also reptiles.

1512
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:11,520
 Come on, well.

1513
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:12,340
 - No.

1514
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:13,180
 - The queen, obviously.

1515
00:56:13,180 --> 00:56:15,520
 (laughing)

1516
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:16,720
 - That's why do you think the king

1517
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:18,080
 wanted these dinosaurs so much?

1518
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:19,440
 He wanted his mates around.

1519
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:23,200
 No, this is, if you go high enough up the taxonomy,

1520
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,720
 you're in the reptiliomorphic clade,

1521
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:28,440
 and that's mammals, birds, reptiles,

1522
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:31,640
 and the thing that it's not is frogs.

1523
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:33,680
 So I shouldn't like amphibians,

1524
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:35,160
 which are basically frogs, right?

1525
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:38,480
 - So basically everything that isn't the frog is the same.

1526
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,880
 - Sort of, with some insects and stuff.

1527
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:42,960
 But basically, there's all of us together.

1528
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:44,480
 And then frogs and nukes.

1529
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:47,960
 - I think that that would be a very funny prejudice to have.

1530
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:50,160
 (laughing)

1531
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:51,240
 - They're not like frogs.

1532
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:53,600
 - Everything in the world, like humans,

1533
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:56,600
 other species, objects, absolutely everything,

1534
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:58,600
 you treat entirely equally,

1535
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:01,480
 but you're a ginormous frogist.

1536
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:06,480
 - Yeah, like race is very old hat, clade is a lie.

1537
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:09,960
 - I think there's some background towards this,

1538
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:11,880
 and I think maybe we should be against frogs,

1539
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:16,120
 because there was a frog called Beelzebufo Ampinga

1540
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:18,360
 that lived 65 to 70 million years ago.

1541
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:19,760
 It was absolutely massive,

1542
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:21,840
 and it had very, very strong jaws,

1543
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:26,000
 so strong that they think it might be able to eat dinosaurs.

1544
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,160
 - No, not like a T-Rex.

1545
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:31,800
 - No, like little tiny chickeny ones, I guess.

1546
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:32,640
 - Cool.

1547
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:34,600
 - But yeah, like if the frogs and the dinosaurs

1548
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:36,320
 were fighting all the way back then,

1549
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:38,480
 it's hardly surprising that everyone on this call

1550
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:40,160
 is a frog racist right now.

1551
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:41,240
 (laughing)

1552
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:43,240
 - I mean, which one survived in the end?

1553
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:44,600
 - Here's a question.

1554
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:48,280
 Why do some dinosaurs have such small arms?

1555
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:50,000
 - This is a cracker joke.

1556
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,560
 (laughing)

1557
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:52,960
 I just feel it.

1558
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:55,000
 - It's not, it's not, it's a true question.

1559
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,320
 Like there was one called Gouamezia Okoei,

1560
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:00,280
 which has basically got no arms at all.

1561
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:01,880
 It's just got too tiny little,

1562
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:04,200
 just a few inches in length arms.

1563
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:05,880
 Obviously the Tyrannosaurus Rex

1564
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:07,880
 has very small arms as well.

1565
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:09,000
 What's going on there?

1566
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,120
 - I guess they didn't need to applaud anything,

1567
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:14,240
 you know, no plays or anything back then.

1568
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:15,480
 - But only bad plays.

1569
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:16,880
 - Only shit plays, yeah.

1570
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:18,200
 - Yeah.

1571
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:20,080
 - I suppose that's something that happens even now, right?

1572
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:23,520
 Like as in the ancestor of the Kiwi would have had wings

1573
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:24,440
 and the wings are just gone.

1574
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:27,000
 So a Kiwi, like if you x-ray it or something,

1575
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,840
 a Kiwi is basically just like a ball with the legs.

1576
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:30,680
 - Absolutely.

1577
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:32,080
 So the Kiwi lost theirs

1578
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:34,240
 because they didn't really need it anymore.

1579
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:36,000
 And you don't need to use up the energy

1580
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,360
 to have body parts that you don't need.

1581
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:42,160
 So that's one theory, that they didn't need them anymore

1582
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:45,120
 because maybe they would eat things with their mouth.

1583
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:46,520
 So they didn't need to use their hands

1584
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:47,840
 to put things in their mouth anymore

1585
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:48,960
 'cause they had such big jaws,

1586
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:50,400
 they would just grab things and bite them.

1587
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,720
 And then they didn't use up the energy to make the arms,

1588
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:54,760
 they could use the energy elsewhere.

1589
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:56,920
 And the other idea is that they ate

1590
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:59,440
 in like real feeding frenzies.

1591
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:01,280
 And that if they had long arms,

1592
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:04,160
 then they'd just get ripped off in those feeding frenzies.

1593
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:05,000
 - What do you mean?

1594
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,120
 Like they'd rip each other's arms off

1595
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:07,480
 or they're going for swinging.

1596
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:10,440
 - So you've got like 10 T-Rexes all going

1597
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:13,680
 after the same bit of meat and they're all biting it.

1598
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:16,080
 And if you've got one T-Rex that looks like Mr. Tickle,

1599
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:18,480
 then his arms just gonna get bitten off.

1600
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:19,800
 - Oh my God.

1601
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:22,880
 So surely they got to a stage

1602
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:25,040
 where they were just biting each other's faces off instead.

1603
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:28,000
 - You're using your face to eat, that's the thing.

1604
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:28,840
 - Wow.

1605
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:29,920
 - Anyway, that's a theory.

1606
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:31,680
 - How long would it take us to start this process?

1607
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:33,000
 Like if I decided, you know what?

1608
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:36,080
 I'm just gonna go feeding frenzy on all my meals.

1609
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:39,160
 And then how many generations do I need to persuade

1610
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:41,720
 my children that they just don't need their arms?

1611
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:42,680
 'Cause I know it's gotta make me

1612
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:44,040
 more evolutionarily successful.

1613
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:45,560
 Like it's gotta make me better at breeding, right?

1614
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:46,760
 If I am eating quickly.

1615
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:47,720
 - Yes, this is the thing.

1616
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:50,120
 And I don't know whether necessarily on dates

1617
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:52,800
 that's the face directly into.

1618
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:57,320
 - We should wrap up here.

1619
00:59:57,320 --> 00:59:59,440
 You're gonna be in Edinburgh.

1620
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:01,040
 Or maybe by the time people are listening,

1621
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:03,160
 you are in Edinburgh probably.

1622
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:04,560
 Where are you right now?

1623
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:07,520
 - So I will be at the Edinburgh Festival

1624
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:11,720
 doing a show from the 12th to the 24th.

1625
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:13,000
 That's not true.

1626
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,400
 It's the 14th of the 24th.

1627
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:16,160
 I'm just going up on the 12th.

1628
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:19,040
 So you might still see me, but on the street.

1629
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:22,320
 It is a work in progress,

1630
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:25,200
 showed towards a new tour that'll be happening next year.

1631
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:29,520
 And it is at noon at Monkey Barrel 3.

1632
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:31,720
 Lovely, Monkey Barrel 3.

1633
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:32,560
 Get there.

1634
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:38,680
 - Okay, that's it.

1635
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:42,200
 That is all of our guests' facts.

1636
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:43,400
 Go see their shows.

1637
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:44,440
 They're in Edinburgh.

1638
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:45,800
 It's gonna be an amazing month.

1639
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:47,240
 Get yourself up there.

1640
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:48,600
 And come back next week.

1641
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:50,400
 We'll have another episode waiting for you.

1642
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:51,360
 We'll see you then.

1643
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:52,200
 Goodbye.

1644
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:55,100
 (upbeat music)

1645
01:00:55,940 --> 01:00:58,520
 (upbeat music)

1646
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:01,100
 (upbeat music)
