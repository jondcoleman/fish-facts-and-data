WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
 (upbeat music)

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.920
 - Hey everyone, welcome to another episode of Fish.

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.200
 Before we get going, I just wanna quickly let you know

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.040
 about two very exciting global live streaming events

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.200
 that we are gonna be doing

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.800
 on the fifth and sixth of September.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.600
 So we're gonna be playing the London podcast festival

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.960
 and as well as playing to a live room full of people

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.320
 at Kings Place in London,

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.040
 we will be live streaming the event

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.240
 so that you can watch it from wherever you are in the world.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.680
 So for those who have never made it to a live show before

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.520
 and always wondered what it's like,

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.240
 this is the full experience.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.920
 This is a sort of warts and all version

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:34.760
 that you'll get to see.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.920
 It's all the bloopers, it's all the extra bits

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.660
 that end up getting edited out.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.120
 There's all the admin at the top of the show.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.080
 Who doesn't love admin at the top of a show?

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.880
 Imagine getting to see that.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.120
 It's gonna be a great night.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.120
 Also, as Anne is now off on maternity,

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.920
 we're gonna be joined by some really fun guests.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.520
 We've already sort of announced one of them on Instagram,

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.440
 but if you didn't see that video on the sixth of September,

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.040
 we are gonna be joined by one of the UK's best-selling authors

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.360
 of all time, Richard Osman.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.320
 That's gonna be an awesome show, that's on the sixth.

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.920
 We'll be making another announcement

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.880
 for who will be joining us on the fifth soon,

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.800
 but in the meantime, if you wanna get tickets,

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.240
 they are available now.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.680
 Just go to knowsuchthingasafish.com/live

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.280
 and get your live streaming tickets now.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.560
 All right, last thing to say before we get into the show

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.320
 is some very exciting news back at QIHQ.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.840
 The Lunchbox MV podcast has been picked up by BBC Sounds.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.560
 So if you happen to listen to your podcast there,

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.880
 do type in the words "Lunchbox MV now"

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.320
 and you'll be able to get access

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.040
 to the most quite interesting food-based podcast

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.960
 there is in podcast land.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.000
 Each episode deals with a different kind of food.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.760
 So the episode that went up a few days ago

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:41.960
 was all about cheese,

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.440
 where they answer the big cheese questions,

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.960
 like, you know, how do they put the holes in Swiss cheese?

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.480
 Who eats the world's hardest cheese?

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.600
 Why do people put Parmesan into a bank?

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.440
 All the biggies.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.600
 And there's over 30 episodes you can access now,

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.360
 everything from pastry through to butter and chocolate.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.440
 You must check them out,

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.360
 but specifically do check them out now at BBC Sounds.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.040
 All right, let's get into the show.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.320
 On with the podcast.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:09.800
 (upbeat music)

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:21.920
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.480
 of No Such Thing as a Fish,

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.120
 a weekly podcast coming to you

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.080
 from the QI offices in Hoburn.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.200
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.280
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.320
 James Harkin, and Andrew Hunter Murray.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.520
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.600
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.840
 And in no particular order, here we go.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.840
 Starting with fact number one, and that is James.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.360
 - Okay, my fact this week is that

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.400
 if you are 20 years old now,

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.040
 there is a chance that your great grandparents

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.000
 might have met thanks to computer dating.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.240
 - That's wild. - It doesn't make sense.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.760
 I had to ask James to explain this,

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.640
 even after we'd said this would be our fact.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.320
 That doesn't work, James, and he proved it.

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.360
 Go on, prove it.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.720
 - So for the hard of thinking who are listening,

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.440
 this is an article that I read,

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.160
 was written by Adrian Covert in Gizmodo,

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.960
 and it's about a guy called Lewis Altfest.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.320
 And Lewis saw a Pempal machine,

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.200
 which let you fill down his questionnaire,

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.920
 and then it fed it into a machine,

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.880
 and it found you the perfect Pempal.

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.320
 And he decided that he would do the same with dating.

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.360
 So he called up his friend called Robert Ross,

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.200
 who worked at IBM, and they made a computer program

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.720
 called TACT that stood for Technical

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.240
 Automated Compatibility Testing.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.920
 They did that in New York, and it was in 1964.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.040
 So, for instance, if your great-grandparents

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.360
 got together due to TACT in 1964,

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.120
 your grandmother could be born in 1965.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.880
 She could have had your mother in 1985,

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.240
 and then your mother could have had you in 2005,

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.800
 and you would be 20 this year.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:56.920
 - Yeah. - It's stunning.

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:57.880
 - It was great.

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.160
 - It was amazing at the time.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.880
 It was such like everyone thought computers

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:01.880
 would know the answer as well.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.280
 It wasn't the best at pairing people.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.520
 It did at one point match an older brother

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:07.840
 with his younger sister.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.200
 (all laughing)

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.400
 - They have a lot in common with it.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.440
 - And I turned out fine.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.760
 (all laughing)

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.600
 - Yeah, that actually weirdly, I think shows it does work.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.040
 Shared interests.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.040
 - It just, you haven't put in the anti-incest layer

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.880
 into the program.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:24.960
 - You haven't clicked that button.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.320
 Most people would click that button.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.160
 (all laughing)

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.200
 - He was crossing his fingers, that guy.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.440
 - So, is this the one, 'cause I read about

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.320
 one of the very early computer dating services,

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.320
 and it asks clients to pick from the dislikes,

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.400
 and the dislikes were, I'd say, very much of their time.

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.880
 - Yes, this is the one you're talking about.

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:42.960
 - From one to six, it was,

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.920
 what do you think about affected people?

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.040
 I think that's a really good question.

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.120
 Like, I'm a bit affected, you know?

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.160
 - You mean like people who have affectations.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.120
 - Exactly, a bit pretentious.

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.120
 I presume, and that still means they've been affected

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.960
 by an event. - Oh, okay.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.480
 I thought it wasn't a typo for infected, 'cause that--

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:56.920
 (all laughing)

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.960
 - But who's saying I love those?

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.400
 Are there people going--

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.800
 - Well, after '60s, some people had affectations

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:03.920
 in the '60s, and that was cool.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.040
 It was the New Age, man.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.720
 - But I think like, it wasn't that you only picked

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.880
 one of them, you kind of picked them in order.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:09.840
 - Oh, okay. - That kind of thing.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.200
 - 'Cause two through six that you might dislike were,

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.280
 birth control, foreigners, free love, homosexuals,

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:17.400
 and interracial marriage.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.440
 But it never says sisters, so.

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.020
 (all laughing)

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:25.240
 Yeah, that was true.

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.760
 So you paid $5, basically,

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.320
 and you would answer loads of questions.

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:29.680
 You would also, the men would be asked

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.920
 to rank women's hairstyles.

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.640
 Women would be shown pictures of men in different settings.

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:38.400
 So there'd be a man chopping wood, a man who was painting,

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.560
 and a man who was in a garage working with a drill.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.080
 And you had to say which of those you fancy the most.

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.080
 - The drill and the chopping wood are very similar, aren't they?

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.800
 What are the two different personality types?

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.640
 - Well, some people are more discerning than you, Anna.

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:50.960
 (all laughing)

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.680
 - That just sounds like outdoorsy versus indoorsy to me.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.720
 - I suppose, drill is indoorsy.

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.640
 - I think like chopping wood shows muscular strength,

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.680
 whereas drill shows more kind of industrial ability.

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.720
 - DIY maybe. - Yeah, yeah.

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.040
 - And these things, they started off,

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.160
 and they were kind of thought of as a gimmick.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.640
 So for instance, this guy at Altfest,

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.840
 he just gave up in the end on his tact.

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:17.040
 But actually he met his partner due to tact.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:20.320
 - Did he? - Yeah, so he married a reporter

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:21.880
 who'd come to interview him

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:23.720
 about how terrible his machine was.

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:24.960
 (all laughing)

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.320
 And they hit it off.

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:27.160
 - Yeah, they were funny.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.040
 There was another one in 1965 in New York,

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.440
 which was called Operation Match.

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:33.400
 I was reading the memories of someone who went on one of those

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.600
 and had three very unsuccessful dates.

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.240
 But the way all these things worked, I guess,

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:38.760
 is you sent in a bit of money

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:40.160
 and you filled out a questionnaire,

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.000
 which could be very long.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.280
 So Operation Match was 75 questions.

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.600
 And then they took your questionnaire

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:46.960
 and they tried to match it up with others

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.480
 using a computer algorithm,

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:51.640
 which is why it was computerized or computer dating.

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:52.960
 But the questions were,

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.120
 I couldn't look out why this one existed.

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:57.240
 So there was a question in this one,

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:01.120
 which was, I'd considered dating a woman as young as,

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.640
 or a man as old as.

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:07.640
 So if you're a man, it was a woman as young as 17 or whatever.

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:09.040
 And if you were a woman,

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:11.640
 it was like I considered dating a man as old as that.

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:12.480
 - Yeah, right.

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:13.320
 - But you wouldn't ask a woman,

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:14.600
 I considered dating a man as young as.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:15.920
 Did it just assume that women could,

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:17.920
 would date men who were infinitely young?

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:19.760
 - The cougar had not been invented.

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:20.720
 That's what we're saying.

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:22.360
 - Yeah, I think that is what we're saying.

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:24.200
 Yeah. - Yeah, I suppose so.

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:25.040
 - Very weird.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.800
 And then are you sexually experienced or inexperienced?

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.080
 And also, what does this mean?

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:33.720
 Is extensive sexual activity preparation for your marriage?

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:34.800
 Yes or no?

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.480
 - Answer, see previous questions.

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:41.800
 So Operation Match was invented by Jeff Tarr and Vaughn Morrill.

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.680
 Jeff Tarr met his wife,

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.920
 not by going on and doing it himself,

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:48.080
 but someone who was using Operation Match said,

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:49.880
 "Oh, I know someone who you'd be good with."

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:51.800
 So they met up, they got married.

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.360
 They had a daughter called Jennifer.

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:56.480
 She goes on to marry the co-founder of OKCupid.

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:57.320
 - No.

00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:58.160
 - Yeah. - Whoa.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:07:59.240
 - Yeah, so. - Tasty.

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:00.440
 - Yeah.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.480
 - So dating apps are declining a lot, right?

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:04.360
 In the UK, I think users are dropping.

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:05.480
 - Oh, really? - Of the really big sites.

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:06.840
 Things like Tinder.

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:08.880
 And it's because people get exhausted

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:10.080
 and they get burned out with them.

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:12.320
 And it's just this endless array of new faces.

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:14.360
 You can start thinking everyone's the same.

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:16.720
 And it's also, it's very sort of private.

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.360
 So the pool of dates is massive,

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:19.720
 but you don't have any friends in common.

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:21.520
 So people often behave badly,

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:22.960
 they don't get back in touch or whatever.

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:23.880
 - I see.

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:26.480
 Yeah, so if you date someone who's a friend of your friend,

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:28.800
 then you kind of feel like you can't be an asshole

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:29.800
 because it will get back to you.

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:31.120
 - There's a shame mechanism there.

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.480
 Whereas you can absolutely just go

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:35.120
 to some random person you've met once and all that.

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:35.960
 Anyway. - Oh, thank you.

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:37.520
 - I don't know.

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:40.440
 But I found this claim that some sites

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:42.960
 are saying things like, if you pay a lot extra,

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:44.440
 like if you pay 45 quid a month,

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:46.600
 you'll go on three times as many dates, right?

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:47.440
 - Okay.

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:52.440
 - So, this is just to say, yesterday I said to my wife,

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:54.680
 I'm downloading Hinge by the way,

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:57.560
 'cause I wanted to test if there are special offers on.

00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:59.200
 But what I forgot to say was that I was doing

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:01.680
 this as part of podcast research.

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:04.120
 From her perspective, I just said, I'm downloading Hinge.

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:06.400
 I want to see if there's got special offers

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:07.320
 on right now.

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:08.160
 - Okay.

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:09.760
 - Let's not put out this fact ever.

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:13.000
 And then she'll never have caught to believe

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.360
 that's what you were doing.

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:18.280
 I really, I think my favorite thing is Love Getty.

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:20.240
 Did you come across this gadget?

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:22.120
 It, 1.3 million was sold.

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:23.360
 So it was quite popular.

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:24.280
 - Is it Spaghetti?

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:25.960
 Love Spaghetti.

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:27.840
 - It's just for people who love Spaghetti, yes.

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:29.800
 - Is it not people who just love John Paul Getty?

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:31.000
 - It's neither of these things.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:31.840
 - Or Getty Images?

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:32.680
 Is that the--

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:33.520
 (laughing)

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:34.340
 - Any further guesses?

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:36.360
 It's like, Get You Love, Love Getty.

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:37.200
 It's a love getter.

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:38.520
 - Got it, yeah.

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:39.520
 - There we go.

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:42.920
 And this was a thing in Japan in 1998.

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:44.800
 Basically, it was a thing that you kept in your pocket.

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:47.400
 And if you saw someone who was a bit fit,

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:49.000
 then you turned it on.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.120
 And it meant that if they had the same gadget,

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.880
 then their gadget would buzz.

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:54.280
 Or you keep yours on all the time.

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:56.520
 And whenever you were within 15 feet of someone

00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:58.240
 who had a gadget that was also turned on,

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.080
 it would buzz and you could be like, oh my God,

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:00.920
 something's buzzing.

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:01.880
 - Can I just say,

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:03.840
 so what you do is when you see someone attractive,

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:05.480
 you start fiddling in your pockets.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:06.680
 (laughing)

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:08.520
 I mean, yeah.

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:09.360
 - It was a small vibration.

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:11.400
 - I don't think you need a buzzer.

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:14.240
 I think people are gonna know what you think immediately.

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:15.680
 It's such a bad idea.

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:17.640
 Like it's a stalker's charter.

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:19.440
 - But also the flaw seems to be that,

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:22.400
 let's say I'm looking across the room at Barry,

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:24.480
 and I think he's hot, and I turn my thing on.

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:26.480
 And Barry doesn't have one of these love getties,

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:28.760
 but Norman on the other side of the tube carriage

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:29.600
 does have one.

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.440
 His goes off, and then he's looking at me,

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:32.760
 thinking she fancies me.

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:33.600
 - She's fiddling in her pants.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.200
 - She's fiddling.

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:36.960
 - Is that a love getty in her pocket?

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:38.040
 (laughing)

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:39.480
 In Spain at the moment,

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:42.880
 if you go to supermarkets after seven o'clock,

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:45.320
 you might not be able to get a pineapple.

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:46.160
 - Okay.

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:46.980
 - Okay.

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:47.820
 - Is this research for this part?

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:50.400
 - Just to complain from my last holiday.

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:53.520
 No, so this is a TikTok video that's been going around

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.640
 telling people that if you're lonely

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:59.200
 to go to your nearest Mercadonia supermarket

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:01.420
 to take a pineapple and put it upside down

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:02.520
 in your shopping cart,

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:04.920
 and then see if anyone else is doing the same,

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:07.640
 and if two upside down panapples see each other,

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:09.080
 then they might get together.

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:10.760
 - So that's just like the love getty.

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:13.120
 It's a slightly more basic version of love getty,

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:14.400
 but at least you've got deniability.

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:17.400
 Whereas if you've got a love getty, it buzzes.

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:18.560
 Whereas if you've just got a pineapple,

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:20.240
 you could say, "Oh no, I'm just--"

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:21.400
 - It's upside down, though, isn't it?

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:22.240
 - It's just all that way.

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:24.320
 - I'm making a pina colada, whatever.

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:26.000
 - Well, the problem is that basically,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.600
 the trend has taken off a little bit in Spain.

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:31.000
 Police have been called to unruly crowds

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.780
 of people trying to find pineapples.

00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:36.300
 And employees of Mercadonia are so sick of it,

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:39.220
 they've been hiding their pineapples at five to seven,

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:40.720
 so no one can get them.

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:42.900
 (laughing)

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:44.660
 - It's a huge pain, people just walking around the shop

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:46.420
 with a single pineapple in their basket.

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:47.700
 Like, you're a business here.

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:49.780
 You're trying to sell other goods.

00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:51.420
 - Do we not think they buy the pineapples at the end?

00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:52.660
 Do you think some people probably just do it,

00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:54.260
 get their date, and then put the pineapple back?

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.580
 - I think if you don't get the date, you would do that.

00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:58.340
 If you do get the date, probably you want to show

00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:00.100
 that you're not a skin flint and that you can afford

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:01.360
 to buy pineapples. - That's a really good point.

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:02.360
 I'll get this, darling.

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:04.240
 (laughing)

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:05.960
 - Does that happen here, or is that just in Spain?

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:08.880
 - Just in Spain, the supermarket chain Mercadonia

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:11.000
 has yet to get into the British market.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.080
 - But next time, Andy, you're in a supermarket

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:15.680
 with your wife, just make sure it's the right way up.

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:18.440
 Bad and hinge combined, something's definitely going on.

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:20.440
 - Well, do you remember, actually, Madison,

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:22.040
 the cheating website?

00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:23.000
 - No.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:23.840
 - Do you not?

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:25.040
 (laughing)

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:27.600
 - Damn, that was so impossible.

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:28.780
 (laughing)

00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:30.000
 - What, website?

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.500
 - Well, that's a list of hacked email addresses

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:34.340
 that's different.

00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:35.980
 (laughing)

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:37.340
 - Okay, let's move on.

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:38.680
 Type it back on there, too.

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:40.220
 - No, no, no.

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:41.060
 This is amazing, right?

00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:42.540
 So it was an affairs website, okay?

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:45.240
 It marketed itself to mostly blokes who say,

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:46.620
 "Hey, you want to have an affair?"

00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:47.940
 Then join Ashley Madison.

00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:50.500
 They were hacked into by some disgruntled staffers

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:52.340
 or former staff or something.

00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:55.420
 And ha, ha, ha, it turned out 95% of the members

00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:57.220
 of Ashley Madison were men, right?

00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:59.000
 So that was the headline that went around the world.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.680
 It was quite a big story at the time.

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:02.760
 The really interesting thing is,

00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:04.800
 a journalist called Annalyn Newitz looked into it,

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.320
 found something much more perturbing.

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:07.880
 It was that the parent company,

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:10.040
 who were called Avid Live Media,

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:14.200
 had made 70,000 fake women bots.

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:16.480
 They would just say things like, "Hi, and what's up?"

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:18.440
 And the men thought they were talking to real women.

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:21.240
 Like, there were 11 million interactions in the database

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:23.400
 between human men and bot women,

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:25.680
 and the men were paying for every message.

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:26.520
 - Right.

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:27.960
 - And the company was paying workers

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:29.420
 to generate these fake profiles.

00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:32.500
 So it was basically real people interacting with bots,

00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:33.860
 having no idea about it.

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:36.060
 That's quite, that's the really sinister thing, you know?

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:38.900
 - And let's talk about our level of sympathy for these men.

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:40.820
 'Cause I suddenly feel really bad for them.

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:42.820
 But I suppose they had gone on a website

00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:44.140
 to cheat on their wives.

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:46.100
 - In a way, they're doing something good, aren't they?

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:48.620
 This company, because this hypothetical man

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:50.820
 has gone on the website to cheat on his wife,

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:52.380
 but they're just putting a fake thing up

00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:53.380
 that he can chat to.

00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:55.340
 So he's not gonna be able to have the affair.

00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:56.220
 What is sin?

00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:58.400
 - I think it's what we're asking.

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:00.920
 He thinks he is sinning, so is he?

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:04.060
 If I'm just talking to a chatbot, that's for God's sake.

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:06.080
 - I remember years ago when there was the rise

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:09.840
 of niche dating places when I was single,

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:12.640
 I went on to, I think it was like a ghost hunter's

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:13.480
 dating site.

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:14.320
 - Of course you did.

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:19.320
 - Yeah, and I got on it and it's just all men.

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:20.360
 But--

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:21.180
 - The ghost dating.

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:23.360
 - Yeah, but their profiles with their blurb came up,

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:24.760
 and all of them sounded so interesting.

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:26.080
 So I actually messaged a couple.

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:26.920
 - No.

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:27.820
 - Yeah, just to say like, hey,

00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:29.300
 can you tell me about ghost hunting?

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:31.380
 'Cause I'm not actually interested sexually.

00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:34.020
 I'm just like, you sound really interesting.

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:35.740
 - Ooh, it's like to me.

00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:41.060
 - I've got one last example of someone who made it big

00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:43.740
 in the world of creating online dating,

00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:47.340
 a guy called Gary Kremen who created match.com.

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:49.220
 What's impressive about him is he seemed to just

00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:52.460
 cleaned up on domain names early on, right?

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:54.060
 'Cause that's where he's made a large fortune from.

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:56.560
 So he owned sex.com.

00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:58.760
 Can you imagine owning sex.com, yeah.

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:01.720
 And there was a big case where someone forged fake documents

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:03.920
 so that the domain name went over to them,

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:06.160
 and he had to fight them for years and years,

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:08.640
 and there's now an outstanding bill of 65 million

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:10.000
 that is owed to Gary Kremen,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.320
 which has not yet been paid by this person.

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:13.600
 - What's on sex.com, is it porn, I guess?

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:15.920
 - He was gonna use it in the way that he was using match.com,

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:19.200
 but match.com just flew into huge success immediately.

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:21.280
 So it was just kind of sitting there dormant.

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:26.280
 He also owned computer.com, which he sold for 500,000.

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:29.300
 But he set up match.com, and even his girlfriend

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:31.500
 found a partner on there, which wasn't him.

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:34.180
 She joined up and met someone else and left him.

00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:36.220
 Yeah, and he said, "Look how successful it is."

00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:38.540
 - What are you hoping for if you buy computer.com?

00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:40.420
 It's just old people going on Google

00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:42.900
 and typing computer.com, 'cause they think

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:44.020
 that's how they turn it on.

00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:45.420
 - It's very much like Donald Trump saying

00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:48.460
 everything is computer now, it's a bit, okay.

00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:51.040
 (upbeat music)

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:55.240
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two,

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:56.600
 and that is my fact.

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:59.120
 My fact this week is that one of the original

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:03.440
 57 Boy Scout badges was the invention badge,

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:05.960
 which required kids to not only invent something new,

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:08.680
 but obtain a patent for it too.

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:10.080
 - It's so hard.

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:11.560
 - I mean, it's a lengthy process

00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:13.560
 to get a patent in America for an invention.

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:14.400
 - Is it hard?

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:16.360
 'Cause there's so much random shit that's been patented

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:17.200
 that you see.

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:18.040
 That never went in here.

00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:19.820
 - I always seem it's piece of piss, actually.

00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:21.900
 - Yeah, I always thought you could just draw a picture

00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:23.300
 on a beer mat and just send it in

00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:24.640
 and then give you a patent.

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:26.060
 - I think it works like that.

00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:28.620
 This idea of yours for a beer mat is incredible, so.

00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:30.000
 Not as easy as it looks.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.680
 - Is it quite a process?

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:34.180
 - Well, I think it costs.

00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:36.380
 You got to pay in order to have it accepted

00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:37.700
 to the submission and so on.

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:39.500
 Like, yeah, it's a lengthy process.

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:42.260
 And basically they dropped the badge largely

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:44.180
 because no one was really achieving it.

00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:45.460
 So the invention badge,

00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:47.420
 it's part of the American Boy Scout specifically.

00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:50.320
 There were 57 original merit badges that you could get,

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:52.160
 like archery and swimming and so on.

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:53.880
 And invention was part of it.

00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:58.400
 So that launched in 1911 and they took it out by 1914

00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:01.520
 and only 10 scouts in that time managed to get it,

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:03.160
 which I think is a very high number.

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:05.080
 - Actually, only nine got it in that time.

00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:06.880
 One person got it in 1915

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:08.800
 'cause he'd already started with his invention.

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:10.360
 So they were like, oh, well, I guess you can have it.

00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:11.520
 - That's apparently one of the rules

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:13.360
 with a badge that's been stopped.

00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:15.120
 If you've started the process

00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:16.840
 trying to get it, you can finish it.

00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:18.540
 - And the inventions have not survived.

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:19.900
 Most of them have not survived.

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:21.140
 We don't know what was patented,

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:24.300
 but we do know one by Graham Thomas Smallwood,

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:28.020
 which was a scout's uniform with a removable sleeve

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:30.580
 to stop your Boy Scout badge arm getting dirty.

00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:31.580
 - I think it's a great idea.

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:32.420
 It's really good.

00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:33.260
 - Is it?

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:34.100
 - Yeah, it's not just that.

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:35.220
 You could take the sleeve off

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:37.540
 and use it to sew badges onto it.

00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:39.860
 You can carry on wearing the rest of your Boy Scout thing.

00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:40.900
 - Just take the whole jacket off, mate.

00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:43.340
 - Yeah, we must have another shirt.

00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:44.460
 - I think you still had,

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:45.620
 from what I could see on the drawing,

00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:47.700
 you still had an underneath sleeve.

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:48.740
 It was a sort of on top.

00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:49.860
 So it's not, you didn't look like

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:50.840
 someone had just ripped your sleeve off.

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:52.400
 - Well, there was a few different things you could do.

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:53.240
 You could do that.

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:55.080
 And then you could also put a secondary sleeve

00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:56.380
 on top of your other sleeve.

00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:57.220
 - Okay.

00:17:57.220 --> 00:17:59.240
 - So it's like a prophylactic sleeve.

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:00.700
 - Was that so it matched the other side?

00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:02.000
 - No, it stops you getting dirty.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.900
 Stop shirt, sleeve getting dirty.

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:05.160
 - And we've all got these things these days.

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:06.560
 - So like you're walking down the street

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:08.500
 and you lean on some wet paint

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:09.660
 and everyone laughs at you

00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:10.720
 'cause you got paint on your arm.

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:11.560
 You go, "Haha!"

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:13.120
 And you pull off your fake sleeve.

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:13.960
 - Amazing.

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:14.800
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:15.640
 - Incredible.

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:17.480
 - Richly deserved patent and badge.

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:18.860
 - I can't believe he's not famous.

00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:20.720
 - The horrific badges back in the day.

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:22.880
 Other discontinued Boy Scout badges

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:25.980
 on the Wikipedia for them is top drawer reading.

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:27.200
 There's beef production.

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:28.040
 - Yep, that's good.

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:29.280
 - Lost until 1975.

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:31.480
 You get a Boy Scout badge for beef production.

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:35.140
 Blacksmithing, nut culture, hog and pork production,

00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:36.200
 taxidermy.

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:37.960
 - Interestingly, hog and pork production

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:40.200
 was discontinued in 1958.

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:41.200
 So I wonder what the difference

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:43.240
 of the discrepancy between pork and beef is.

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:47.280
 We must keep the beef scouts going.

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:48.120
 - Is it, well, there are a lot

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:50.380
 of nine-year-old farmers in those days.

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:51.220
 - No.

00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:52.720
 - To get the pork production badge,

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:55.480
 you needed to confer with meat market men

00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:58.800
 and from their instruction, draw a diagram of a hog

00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:02.240
 and mark and name the parts for butcher classification.

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:03.080
 - It's so good.

00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:04.880
 I think our children should be learning that kind of stuff.

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:05.960
 - I love those details.

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:06.920
 All the things that they had to do.

00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:08.600
 Like a farmhouse and planning

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:10.240
 was one of the merit badges you could get.

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:11.080
 And as part of that,

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:12.160
 you had to present a drawing plan

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:14.840
 of sewage disposal for a country home.

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:16.000
 (laughing)

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:16.840
 - Amazing.

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:17.680
 I mean, these are the skills of the future.

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:18.520
 - I don't know.

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:19.340
 I don't like that element.

00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:20.960
 It reminds me a lot of Duke of Edinburgh.

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:22.080
 I don't know if anyone did that

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:23.400
 where basically you thought it was just going

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:25.520
 on a fun walk when there's all this background stuff

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:26.520
 you also have to do.

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:29.520
 So all the badges still, there's the family life badge,

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:30.640
 which is quite nice.

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:32.080
 It basically means being a good little boy

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:33.920
 or girl to your parents,

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:36.560
 but you have to write this full proposal, don't you?

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:38.240
 At the start and make lists

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:40.440
 and then submit various essays on it.

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:42.720
 - It doesn't mean anything to be good to your parents

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:44.980
 if you're doing it just to get a badge, does it?

00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:46.000
 - Yeah.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.560
 - I think whatever, whatever works.

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:48.400
 - Whatever.

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:49.720
 (laughing)

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:50.560
 I agree.

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:51.880
 Stalking badge was another one, by the way.

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:52.720
 - Stalking.

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:53.560
 - That had to go.

00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:54.400
 (laughing)

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:55.520
 They just renamed that as tracking

00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:57.440
 just to make it more acceptable.

00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:59.840
 - Do you know what the rarest badge

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:02.480
 that anyone got in 2024 was?

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:04.680
 Again, this is all American Boy Scouts.

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:05.520
 We should say.

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:07.200
 In fact, I think pretty much everything we've said

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:08.280
 is American Boy Scouts.

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:10.560
 So, okay, I would say in 2024,

00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:12.840
 'cause there are some old-school badges

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:14.560
 like Hog and Pork production,

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:15.400
 but there are new ones.

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:16.240
 - That's not there anymore.

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:19.960
 - There are new ones like being woke or whatever.

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:21.480
 Is it one of the new or the old-school ones

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:22.320
 that was the least caught on?

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:23.160
 - Oh, it's old-school.

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:24.160
 - I reckon.

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:25.360
 - Is it motorboating?

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:26.200
 'Cause I think that--

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:27.040
 (laughing)

00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:28.440
 - Popping your head between women's boobs.

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:29.280
 - Well, that's the thing.

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:30.960
 I think that's got connotations now.

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:34.040
 It is a badge, but I bet a lot of people

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:35.800
 are doing the wrong thing when they try to get it.

00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:37.360
 - I see what you mean.

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:38.880
 Only one kid actually drove a motorboat.

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:41.240
 The others all just went, "Maw, maw, maw, maw."

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:43.680
 And they get it. (laughing)

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:44.600
 - My God.

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:46.640
 - It's not that. - Okay.

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:48.520
 - I'm trying to think if this actual thing

00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:50.000
 could have any sexual connotations.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.320
 - Is it like a schooner construction?

00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:56.400
 - I mean, it's a very difficult thing to guess, really.

00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:59.720
 It's something that you might associate with the army

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:01.760
 as opposed to the scouting movement.

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:02.600
 - Okay.

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:05.240
 - Something that one person in an army regiment would do.

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:07.520
 - Oh, only because I've read through the big list.

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:08.360
 Is it bugling?

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:11.480
 - It's bugling, yes. - Oh, wow.

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:13.640
 - I don't know if that is another sexual term.

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:15.120
 It feels like it probably should be.

00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:16.640
 - Certainly could be, couldn't it?

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:20.240
 - But yeah, the least common are bugling, surveying,

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:23.840
 stamp collecting, drafting, composite materials,

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:24.680
 and then it goes on.

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:25.840
 - We've lost so many of our traditions.

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:26.760
 - And the top three.

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:28.880
 Oh, top one, top one badge in 2024.

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:31.160
 - I think pioneering, 'cause it's so classic.

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:33.080
 That's one with ropes and building.

00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:34.940
 - Not where you put a pioneer ear.

00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:36.920
 (all laughing)

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:38.920
 - Got to get off over dictionary.com.

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:41.160
 (all laughing)

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:42.800
 - I just hope to God, Anna,

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:44.440
 you never be a young boy scout

00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:46.180
 who tells you they're doing a motor birdie.

00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:47.020
 (all laughing)

00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:47.860
 And you're gonna go on.

00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:48.700
 Go on, mate.

00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:49.540
 (all laughing)

00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:51.220
 - Show me your skills.

00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:53.040
 Don't mind my mate with the poisonous ears.

00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:54.160
 (all laughing)

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:55.360
 He's just going for his.

00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:57.640
 - So pioneering, that's your guess, right?

00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:59.120
 - This is easy to get, I reckon.

00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:01.240
 - Is it like helping a person?

00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:02.080
 - Geocaching.

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:04.400
 - Helping a person, but in a very specific way.

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:06.320
 - Helping old women cross across the road.

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:07.840
 - There's no badge for that.

00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:08.680
 - First aid.

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:09.520
 - Correct.

00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:13.080
 And the biggest gain in popularity in 2024.

00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:16.780
 This one went from the 121st most popular badge

00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:19.400
 to the 81st most popular badge.

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:20.720
 And it's something that one of us

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:23.280
 round this table enjoys.

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:24.320
 - But it's a skill.

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:25.680
 - It's not, so it's weighing on

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:27.080
 about electric cars or something.

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:27.920
 (all laughing)

00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:29.240
 - Thank you.

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:31.520
 Was it being a lush, James?

00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:34.680
 (all laughing)

00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:37.320
 - Being weird on ghost dating websites.

00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:38.840
 - I wasn't being weird, I was being friendly.

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:39.680
 - It was.

00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:40.500
 - It was a friendly ghost.

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:41.960
 - The wife guy badge.

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:44.560
 - No, no, it wasn't, it wasn't, it wasn't.

00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:46.180
 - It was the golf badge.

00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:47.520
 - Oh!

00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:48.360
 - It was the biggest cake.

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:49.200
 - Clever.

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:50.480
 - It was a twist, it was him.

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:51.760
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, we were looking at the,

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:53.280
 that's very good, that's very good.

00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:54.480
 There is this really big thing of like,

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:58.360
 oh, all the badges, they've gone all woke, blah, blah, blah.

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:00.360
 And it's a very, very tiresome talking point

00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:03.400
 because there are things like, there's a money skills one,

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:05.320
 or you know, or there's Scouts Digital Citizen,

00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:07.360
 or you know, or there's, actually loads of them

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:09.360
 are just absolutely straight down the line,

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:13.120
 like athletics, air researcher, angler, caver, climber,

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:15.320
 they're just absolute route one classic scout stuff.

00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:16.760
 - Oh yeah, they're all the classics,

00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:18.600
 except one of the really early classics,

00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:21.360
 the Swastika badge, which I don't think was on my list.

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:22.680
 - No.

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:24.520
 - Baden-Pound loved the Swastika badge.

00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:25.360
 - What?

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:26.360
 - He thought it should be like the defining badge

00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:27.200
 of the Scouts, he said.

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:28.200
 - So what are you talking about?

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:31.080
 - In 1921, he wrote quite rightly

00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:33.800
 that the Swastika is a symbol used in every part of the world,

00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:35.880
 in the ancient world, in the modern day,

00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:39.600
 but now it stands for the badge of fellowship among Scouts.

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:41.760
 And how you used it was, if you're a Boy Scout,

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:44.160
 you always carry around a collection of Swastika badges.

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:45.800
 And if someone did you a good turn,

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:47.760
 like gave you a leg up or a pie,

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:51.400
 then you gave them a badge and you said, always wear this.

00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:53.520
 And that means if a Boy Scout ever saw you,

00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:55.280
 they have to offer to do you a good turn.

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:57.920
 - So are we misunderstanding the Nazis?

00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:00.560
 - They just did a lot of good turns for the Scouts over the years.

00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:02.000
 - I think that was it, yeah.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.960
 - It was actually just a big sponsored march into Poland.

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:07.200
 (laughing)

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:08.360
 'Cause Baden-Pound,

00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:10.240
 'cause that was obviously when the Swastika

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:12.200
 had not been adopted by the Nazis.

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:13.600
 But he was a bit fascistic.

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:17.200
 So in 1937, he wanted to form close ties

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:19.000
 with German youth movements.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.320
 He wrote in his diary in 1939 that "Mine Camp"

00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:22.920
 was a wonderful book with good ideas

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:25.840
 on education, health, propaganda, organization, et cetera.

00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:28.600
 - I would agree on the propaganda front.

00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:30.080
 - Well, it did work, didn't it?

00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:30.920
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:33.440
 I mean, obviously he could have known how it would turn out,

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:34.280
 but...

00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:35.120
 - Yeah, wow.

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:36.440
 That meant that puts the shows the Swastika thing

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:37.520
 in a whole new light.

00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:38.360
 - I don't want to say...

00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:40.280
 By the way, I'm not saying he was an out and out fascist.

00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:41.760
 He was just a complicated character,

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:43.240
 very old fashioned these days,

00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:45.920
 but had amazing ideas about like getting young people

00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:47.920
 organized and working together,

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:49.040
 helping each other, all of that,

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:50.480
 like raising good citizens for that.

00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:51.640
 - And it impressed the world.

00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:53.560
 So the reason the American Scouts started,

00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:54.720
 there's an origin story,

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:56.880
 which is such like, it's like King Arthur.

00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:58.640
 It's just like total bullshit,

00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:01.120
 but it's a guy called W.D. Boyce.

00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:03.920
 And W.D. Boyce is one of the five co-founders of the Scouts.

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:05.240
 - Scouting for Boyce.

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:07.560
 - Scouting for Boyce.

00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:08.840
 So you got Baden Powell,

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:10.400
 who obviously is the British originator,

00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:12.320
 but in America, you then had W.D. Boyce,

00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:14.440
 you had Daniel Carter Beard, James E. West,

00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:16.360
 and then you had Ernest Thompson Seton.

00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:18.480
 The audio was that W.D. Boyce was in England.

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:19.720
 He's an American newspaper guy,

00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:21.840
 and he was walking through a foggy street at night.

00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:22.680
 Couldn't really see anything.

00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:25.720
 Went out through the fog, came a Boy Scout,

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:27.480
 and said, "Let me help you across the road,

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:29.000
 "and let me get you to where you need to go."

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.240
 And he thought, "Wow, this young man with impeccable behavior.

00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:32.080
 "What is this?

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:33.120
 "Oh, you're a Boy Scout.

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:33.960
 "I must do that."

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:35.720
 And he got taken to Baden Powell,

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:37.160
 and immediately said, "I'll set it up."

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:39.040
 Now, we know that it wasn't even foggy that day

00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:40.480
 that he was there in the UK.

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:42.480
 - Well, who thought to do that research?

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:43.800
 - Well, people who try to work out.

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:45.040
 - People who meet urologists.

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:47.560
 - Because there's a lot of sort of questions

00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:49.560
 about who actually is the original founder

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:50.760
 of the American Boy Scouts.

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:52.320
 - So often it's raining outside,

00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:55.480
 and I look at my phone up, and it says it's not raining.

00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:57.760
 And that's like literally happening right now.

00:25:57.760 --> 00:25:59.000
 I don't trust this stuff.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.040
 - Yeah, I mean, who knows?

00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:01.440
 But that's the kind of the story

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:03.440
 that was created, the mythology behind it.

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:06.080
 The other guy was Ernest Thompson Seton.

00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:07.000
 There's a great fact,

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.680
 I read in a Margaret Atwood book about him,

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:10.160
 which is when he turned 21,

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:12.800
 his father handed him a bill charging him

00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:15.880
 for all the expenses associated with his childhood,

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:19.000
 including the fee for his delivery at birth.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.000
 Just hand it to him.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.440
 - Right, he's one of the founders of the American Boy Scouts.

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:24.920
 - I will not do that for my daughter,

00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:27.400
 just to say, 'cause she was on the NHS.

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:30.000
 (all laughing)

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.320
 - They and Paul, yeah, he married a woman called Olaf Sones.

00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:37.520
 He was 55, and she was 23 when they got married.

00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:40.240
 And the wedding present for those two,

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:44.440
 the Scouts were each encouraged to contribute one penny,

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:46.440
 and a hundred thousand of them did it,

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:49.360
 and they bought him a car, which is quite cool.

00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:50.880
 And then in 1929,

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:53.280
 to celebrate the 21st birthday of the Scouts,

00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:54.840
 they all did the same again.

00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:55.680
 But at this stage,

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:58.480
 there were four million Scouts and guides around the world.

00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:00.280
 And so they bought him a Rolls-Royce.

00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:02.280
 - Oh, that's great. - That's great.

00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:04.760
 - Isn't that cool? - Long Con, you know?

00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:06.000
 (all laughing)

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.840
 - They started emitting girls in 2019,

00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:10.440
 the Boy Scouts of America.

00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:13.800
 And who did this piss off?

00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:15.840
 - Oh, the Daily Mail readers.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.600
 - Was it someone in the Baden-Powell family?

00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:20.440
 'Cause he, I mean, he--

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:21.280
 - Very much so.

00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:23.240
 - His sister ran the Girl Guides, though,

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:24.280
 when they started.

00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:26.600
 - Well, that's, it was the Girl Scouts.

00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:28.160
 - Right, right, sorry, Girl Scouts, yeah, yeah.

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:31.280
 - So yeah, they are furious about this,

00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:34.080
 because they now call themselves the BSA

00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:37.760
 to try and take the boy out of their, like, name.

00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:39.120
 And the girls basically said,

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:41.080
 the whole reason they've done this

00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:43.840
 is to help with their massively plummeting membership.

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:47.040
 They're trying to steal Girl Scouts from our movement,

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:50.040
 from us, and they're suing them, the name change.

00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:54.040
 - People who want their children to join the Girl Scouts,

00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:55.800
 they might just Google Girl Scouts

00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:58.040
 and get the girl members of the Boy Scouts.

00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:00.320
 - Yeah, absolutely, so there's beef.

00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:02.200
 - If it's called the, there's beef.

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:03.040
 - There's a lot.

00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:04.440
 - Not since 1968, there is a--

00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:05.480
 (all laughing)

00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:06.400
 - It's gone off now.

00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:07.400
 - Lovely.

00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:09.880
 - So hopefully they'll fight, and then who do you back?

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:11.680
 - But they're called the BSA now.

00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:12.520
 - I believe so, yeah.

00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:13.360
 - Boy Scouts of America, yeah.

00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:14.960
 - What was the B-Stand for, if not for boy?

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:16.680
 - Well, you don't know the--

00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:17.800
 - Well, you're hiding it, aren't you?

00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:18.640
 That's the whole point.

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:20.080
 Why did the girls start letting boys in?

00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:21.080
 - Yes.

00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:24.680
 - Yeah, I can see how that's the logical daily mail

00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:26.040
 commenters' response.

00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:27.640
 (all laughing)

00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:29.240
 - Sorry, I thought that was the work response.

00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:31.040
 You're trying to get your work badge.

00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:32.840
 - Let me knock down the Girl Scouts,

00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:35.760
 'cause it's about time someone's done a peg or two.

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:39.880
 They, according to a blog called Waity Matters,

00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:43.280
 are saddling America with a huge amount of obesity.

00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:45.060
 Thanks to the Girl Scout cookies

00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:46.600
 that they sell every year.

00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:50.240
 So according to this person on the blog,

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:52.400
 they worked out that the Girl Scout cookies

00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:54.320
 that are sold every year accounts

00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:58.040
 with three quarters of a million pounds of trans fat.

00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:00.760
 That's 3.5 billion teaspoons of sugar

00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:02.880
 that they add to the American food supply.

00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:04.160
 - Well, that does sound bad,

00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:06.440
 but we need overall figures, I think,

00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:07.360
 because that's a bit,

00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:09.720
 if it can't just be the Girl Scout cookies.

00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:11.520
 - Oh, no, there's other stuff going on.

00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:12.640
 (all laughing)

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:14.000
 - But it doesn't help.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:14.840
 - It doesn't help.

00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:15.680
 - It doesn't help.

00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:16.840
 - They're trying to fatten up the boys,

00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:18.000
 make them easier to defeat.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.580
 (upbeat music)

00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:25.280
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:26.540
 and that is Andy.

00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:29.000
 - My fact is that one of London's oldest windows

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.600
 is made of cow horn.

00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:35.160
 - The window itself.

00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:36.960
 - The glass, as it were.

00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:37.960
 The glass substitute is cow.

00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:38.800
 - Can you see through it?

00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:40.480
 'Cause if not, I say that isn't a window.

00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:42.080
 - Well, judge for yourself, James,

00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:44.600
 'cause I've got a photo here of me this morning

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:46.640
 at the cow horn window.

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:48.520
 - I can see you, but you are in front of it.

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:49.640
 - Yeah, but you can see through it.

00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:50.840
 It's very see-through-able.

00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:53.800
 So, horn, it turns out, is a fantastic window material,

00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:55.640
 beaten maybe only by glass.

00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:57.400
 (all laughing)

00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:58.240
 This is in London.

00:29:58.240 --> 00:29:59.800
 It's a place called Guildhall.

00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:01.640
 So, there's a separate thing called the City of London,

00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:02.920
 which is different to London, right?

00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:05.400
 The City of London is the sort of ancient body.

00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:06.240
 It's--

00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:07.960
 - It means part of London, really.

00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:09.400
 - It's right in the middle of London, definitely.

00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:11.240
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're still in London.

00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:13.320
 But, the actual Guildhall itself,

00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:15.320
 the town hall of the City of London,

00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:16.680
 dates back to the 14th century.

00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:21.040
 Like, it's the oldest non-religious building in London.

00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:22.760
 You know, there are a couple of abbeys and cathedrals

00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:24.920
 and things that are older, but it's really old.

00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:28.240
 And this window dates back to the 15th century.

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:30.920
 So, it has survived any manner of stuff.

00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:33.000
 All the other windows in the place have been replaced.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:34.080
 Like, there's been the Blitz,

00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:35.280
 there's been the Great Fire of London.

00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:37.280
 This window is still there all these years later.

00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:38.240
 It's kind of amazing.

00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:39.800
 - Come on, kids, go and play football outside.

00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:41.520
 (all laughing)

00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:42.360
 - I dare you.

00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:45.400
 - And it's made of cow horn.

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:48.680
 So, you pop the horn off the cow, you slice it up,

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:50.440
 you heat that, and then you can mold it

00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:53.600
 into this amazing, really pretty transparent window material.

00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:54.440
 It's stunning.

00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:55.260
 - So cool.

00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:56.200
 - And is it incredibly strong?

00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:57.640
 Is that how it's survived this lot?

00:30:57.640 --> 00:30:58.480
 - Oh, no.

00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:00.240
 - Okay, so that makes it all the more amazing

00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:01.200
 that we've still got it, right?

00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:02.320
 - It's not only not--

00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:03.400
 I mean, it's decent.

00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:06.200
 You know, glass from the time is not incredibly strong either.

00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:08.160
 And until the 18th century,

00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:10.880
 cow horn was used largely for translucent sheets

00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:12.240
 to go into, like, lanterns.

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:14.560
 The word "lantan" comes from lanthorn, you know,

00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:15.400
 'cause it would have horn--

00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:16.240
 - That's it.

00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:17.720
 - The sides of it were horn.

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:18.840
 - I don't think it does.

00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:19.680
 I think, 'cause I was like,

00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:22.000
 "That's why they always spell it weird in old books."

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.120
 'Cause obviously, you know, you read old, like,

00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:25.480
 Shakespeare will say it, "lanthorn."

00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:26.480
 In the old 19th century novels,

00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:27.680
 sometimes you see lanthorn.

00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:28.920
 So I was like, "That explains it."

00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:31.080
 But actually, lantern just comes from Latin,

00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:32.480
 like, meaning light.

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:35.600
 But people then did the old got confused.

00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:38.040
 Lots of their lanterns were made out of horn.

00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:40.320
 So they went, "Should we shove a horn on the end?"

00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:42.640
 And I read a quite annoyed encyclopedia entry

00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:45.760
 from about 1803, saying lanthorn

00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:48.080
 is a completely incorrect spelling of this

00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:49.720
 based on the misconception.

00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:51.760
 So that's just the idiots from the 18th century.

00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:52.600
 - But it is based on the fact

00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:53.720
 that lanterns were made of horn.

00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:54.560
 - Absolutely, yeah.

00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:55.400
 - Which they were.

00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:56.240
 - Yeah, right, yeah, yeah.

00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:57.080
 - That's really interesting.

00:31:57.080 --> 00:31:57.920
 - It's so cool.

00:31:57.920 --> 00:31:59.040
 I mean, basically, in the 15th century,

00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:01.600
 they had the equivalent of laminated menus.

00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:03.720
 There were the horn books that students would use

00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:05.440
 where they would have all the alphabet on it.

00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:06.800
 You've got, like, wooden frames

00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:08.200
 where you've got horn that's written on

00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:10.320
 with the alphabet to learn from and things like that.

00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:11.800
 But you've also got ancient books

00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:14.120
 which have a square of horn on the front

00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:15.760
 to protect what's beneath,

00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:17.800
 like a very valuable old bit of parchment

00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:19.120
 or vellum or whatever.

00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:20.440
 So the horn window covers that.

00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:22.480
 But it's quite delicious for insects.

00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:23.560
 So a lot of the very old ones

00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:25.240
 are just nibbled away at all around the edges.

00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:27.520
 - The alphabet books that Dan was talking about

00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:29.600
 are called horn books.

00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:34.000
 And the horn book is also the title of a book from 1889,

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.520
 which is thought of as the principal work

00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:38.840
 on sex technique in the English language.

00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:39.680
 - Oh, good Lord.

00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:41.800
 - It's basically 1889.

00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:42.640
 - I didn't think.

00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:43.480
 - Yeah?

00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:44.320
 - I didn't think they had that then.

00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:45.840
 - Well, that's why it's interesting.

00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:48.160
 Where do you think your great-great-great-great-great-great-grandmother

00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:49.000
 came from?

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:49.840
 (laughing)

00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:51.440
 So it's like the Kamasutra, basically,

00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:53.120
 but for Victorian England.

00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:53.960
 - Wow.

00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:54.960
 - And they had sex techniques.

00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:57.080
 Number one, The Ordinary.

00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:58.360
 (laughing)

00:32:58.360 --> 00:32:59.200
 - End of book.

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:01.680
 (laughing)

00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:02.520
 - What was that then?

00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:03.960
 Was that actually in 1888?

00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:07.560
 That was upside down and back to front.

00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:08.440
 - Here's some more.

00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:10.120
 Number five, The St. George.

00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:12.440
 (laughing)

00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:14.080
 - What, 'cause you're sort of prodding a dragon.

00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:15.680
 (laughing)

00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:18.240
 - Number nine, The View of the Low Countries.

00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:20.240
 - Oh, that is good.

00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:22.680
 - Number 48, Waste Not Want Not.

00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:23.760
 - Oh, dear.

00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:27.680
 - And number 63, The Sack of Corn, Backwards.

00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:28.520
 - Wow.

00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:29.360
 (laughing)

00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:31.640
 - None of these say much about the people involved,

00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:32.480
 do they?

00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:33.320
 - No.

00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:34.160
 - There's much more.

00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:35.440
 - Wait, what was the connection to horn, sorry?

00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:36.280
 - It's called the horn book.

00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:37.600
 - Oh, that's it, sorry.

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:39.480
 - It's like, if you Google, I'm just warning people,

00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:42.120
 if they Google horn books to get these alphabet books,

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:43.440
 they might accidentally get this one.

00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:46.400
 - Do be careful if you're on horn.com.

00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:49.160
 (laughing)

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:51.960
 - There's a cleaner horn book fact, which I quite liked,

00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:54.480
 which was a poem was written in 1622,

00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:57.200
 which said, 'cause they were the thing you went to

00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:59.760
 for your learning your first letters, and it read,

00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:02.440
 "Even so, the horn book is the seed and grain

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:05.360
 of skill by which we learning first obtain,

00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:08.160
 and it was written by William Hornby."

00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:09.760
 - Oh, that's really good.

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:11.280
 Can I give you another one like that?

00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:12.120
 - Please.

00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:15.240
 - The largest brothel in Europe is situated on Horn Street.

00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:16.080
 - Okay.

00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:16.920
 - Is it?

00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:17.760
 - Yeah.

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:18.580
 - I was trying to raise the tone.

00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:20.720
 - Well, it's gone straight back down again.

00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:25.080
 It's in Cologne, and it has 120 sex workers working there,

00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:27.680
 and it was Europe's first high-rise brothel.

00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:29.320
 - But how many of the customers are going looking

00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:31.440
 for alphabet books for their kids?

00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:32.280
 - Most of them, yeah.

00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:33.600
 - I think the architectural thing

00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:34.760
 is not the interesting thing there,

00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:38.200
 as I've stayed in the largest hotel in Thessaloniki,

00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:39.520
 and it's not a guarantee of quality.

00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:44.000
 It turns out, when you just say Europe's largest brothel,

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:45.000
 it doesn't mean best.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.840
 - That's true.

00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:47.680
 - Oh, my God.

00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:50.360
 - They basically had a red light district in the town center

00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:51.960
 and decided to do away with it

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:54.440
 and get this huge multi-storey building and stuff.

00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:55.280
 - Right.

00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:58.440
 - And it advertises money-back guarantee

00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:00.440
 in the case of unsatisfactory service.

00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:01.280
 - No.

00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:02.640
 - Yeah.

00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:04.400
 - It's so awkward to complain, isn't it?

00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:06.320
 - The sack of corn wasn't backwards at all.

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:09.900
 (all laughing)

00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:12.280
 Have you guys heard of the worshipful company of Horner's?

00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:14.520
 - Yes, I know someone who's connected.

00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:15.360
 - Get out.

00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:16.640
 - Well, 'cause London has all these guilds,

00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:18.080
 which are the worshipful company of,

00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:20.760
 and then you insert very old-fashioned trade.

00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:24.440
 - So this is the thing, it dates back to 1284,

00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:28.120
 and it was a guild for people who worked with horn people,

00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:29.880
 and it was a huge business at the time, obviously,

00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:31.480
 'cause all the people needed lanterns and windows

00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:34.760
 and horn books and other uses of horn, there are thousands.

00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:37.920
 Now, they declined, obviously, when pesky glass,

00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:41.840
 stupid glass, took over the window industry,

00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:44.160
 and they were in the doldrums for centuries,

00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:45.660
 but they came back,

00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:49.440
 and he guesses what they sort of re-imagined themselves as.

00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:50.800
 - Oh, buglers.

00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:52.960
 - It's not buglers, though.

00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:55.680
 They just can't get enough buglers through the door.

00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:58.440
 - I'm just thinking, like, if they're still called the Horner's.

00:35:58.440 --> 00:35:59.280
 - They're still called the Horner's,

00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:01.040
 but they took on another industry

00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:02.960
 related to what they did in the first place.

00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:04.320
 - I read this early today,

00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:06.080
 and I just couldn't believe I never made the connection,

00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:08.840
 but shoehorns are made of horn.

00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:10.560
 - It wasn't, yes, that's true.

00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:13.640
 That's not the gigantic industry they put on.

00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:15.520
 - Come on, globally, everyone's got a shoehorn.

00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:16.360
 - Absolutely.

00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:18.240
 - Is it microchips?

00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:22.560
 - No, it's plastics.

00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:23.400
 - Oh, right.

00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:24.720
 - Horn was the original plastic.

00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:26.120
 You heat it, you can mold it.

00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:28.200
 So these days, all the members

00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:29.640
 of the worshipful company of Horner's

00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:31.800
 are from the city, from the plastics industry.

00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:35.320
 They sponsor the Polymer Apprentice of the Year Award.

00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:36.640
 Big deal in plastics.

00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:38.480
 - It's huge, it's a scout badge.

00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:39.960
 - Yeah, that's amazing.

00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:40.800
 - Yeah, that's really cool.

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:42.240
 - Do you know that actually being a Horner

00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:44.600
 is pretty tricky today?

00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:45.440
 - Is it?

00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:46.480
 - If you're a true Horner,

00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:48.600
 not one of these plastic people,

00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:51.800
 but you're a person who wants to make things out of horn,

00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:54.360
 it is difficult because of breeding

00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:56.280
 and modern farming and feeding

00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:59.240
 has changed what horns are like.

00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:01.640
 So the material is not as good for molding

00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:02.800
 as it used to be.

00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:05.680
 And it'll quite often retain what they call its memory.

00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:07.160
 So you kind of flatten it

00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:09.840
 and then you put it into whatever shape you want it to be,

00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:12.240
 but it kind of remembers that it was horn shaped before

00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:13.640
 and you can't get it flat properly.

00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:16.360
 - You come down to your new car window

00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:18.840
 and it's just back in the shape of a cow horn.

00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:21.080
 - It's a cow there instead, you ride it to work.

00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:23.880
 - So did you read about the Abbey horn, horn works?

00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:24.720
 - Go for it.

00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:26.120
 - We've said the word horn so much, I just love it.

00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:27.800
 Anyway, sorry, it's on the edge of the lake district.

00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:30.800
 It's the only horn works left in the UK.

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:32.560
 'Cause it's an endangered craft these days

00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:34.960
 'cause there are only about 10 to 20 horn workers left.

00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:37.320
 And I think most of them work at Abbey horn.

00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:39.640
 It's been there for nearly 300 years

00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:41.280
 and you can get some bloody good stuff there.

00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:42.400
 I was going through the website

00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:44.800
 and just, you get a horn moustache brush,

00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:47.480
 some bloody good shoe horns, Dan, you'd love it.

00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:48.560
 - Okay, send me that link.

00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:50.320
 - Some absolute foot long monsters.

00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:51.680
 And actually, James, as you were saying,

00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:52.920
 'cause horn has changed,

00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:55.280
 they get some of those from like,

00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:57.360
 I think it's African cattle called the ankle

00:37:57.360 --> 00:37:59.240
 'cause they have massive great horns.

00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:01.200
 And you might wanna buy it at the novelty drinking horn

00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:03.440
 if your partner is into being a Viking or whatever.

00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:04.280
 - How is it?

00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:06.720
 Are you allowed to buy and sell this kind of horn

00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:09.320
 compared to obviously ivory you're not allowed to

00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:11.520
 and lots of other rhino horns you can't.

00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:12.840
 - It's fine, it is fine.

00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:15.160
 Because all of these cattle that they're buying the horns of

00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:16.360
 were bred for farming

00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:20.160
 and they certainly weren't killed for their horns.

00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:23.120
 - On drinking horns, obviously a huge use of horn.

00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:25.560
 And Vikings really did massively popularize them.

00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:28.560
 It was kind of the Vikings that brought them to the UK,

00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:30.160
 although they'd been used before.

00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:33.760
 But did you know that they also bought

00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:37.080
 such a drinking culture that got so bad by the 10th century

00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:40.000
 that King Edgar, who you all know,

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.800
 it was the late 10th century English king,

00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:46.160
 said that every village had to be limited to one ale house

00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:49.560
 and every single drinking horn that any punter drank out of

00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:52.040
 had to have pins inserted at certain levels,

00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:54.480
 it's a bit like you have measures on cups a day.

00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:57.280
 And whoever drank beyond those intervals in one week

00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:58.560
 had to be severely punished.

00:38:58.560 --> 00:38:59.600
 - Whoa. - Right.

00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:01.400
 - Which is a tough to monitor as a bar person.

00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:02.840
 - Policing that, yeah.

00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:03.880
 (laughing)

00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:05.960
 But is it because it's a little bit of a drinking culture,

00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:07.320
 I think, because you can't put it down.

00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:08.280
 - Yeah, that's the idea.

00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:11.280
 - It's like a cocktail party where there's no table.

00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:12.120
 It's a nightmare.

00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:14.200
 You fill up your horn and you just stuck around holding it.

00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:17.760
 - Yeah, I must say the Vikings coming to Northern England

00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:21.320
 in the 10th century is just like you going to a cocktail party.

00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:22.160
 - There's no to put it down.

00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:23.800
 And often you lose track of your own horn.

00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:25.640
 And what's good is to put a little hairband

00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:26.680
 around your own horn.

00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:27.520
 (laughing)

00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:29.440
 - Well, you're the only one who comes with a horn holder

00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:32.120
 to make sure you can put it down between sits, so.

00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:35.880
 - Can you think of another use of the word horning

00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:37.440
 to be horned?

00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:40.480
 - Oh, I'm thinking of horning in on a situation.

00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:41.640
 - Oh, like horning in.

00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:43.600
 - No, it's sort of where you interrupt.

00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:46.520
 Oh, here Anna comes horning in on our conversation.

00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:48.000
 - Oh yeah. - Whatever.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:48.840
 - No, not that.

00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:51.240
 This is in a kind of sport.

00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:53.600
 - A very old-fashioned European sport.

00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:57.680
 - Marrying the Habsburg Queen.

00:39:57.680 --> 00:40:01.280
 - That's a sport, very good.

00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:03.040
 No, it's in bullfighting.

00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:05.720
 It's when you get gored by a bull.

00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:08.000
 It's called, it's known as a horning.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:09.360
 - It's been a horning in the morning.

00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:10.160
 - Yes.

00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:13.120
 - Morning horning would be a good royal rumble thing

00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:13.960
 for bullfighting.

00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:15.200
 Just in case the bullfighting people are listening,

00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:16.760
 wanting to rev it up a bit.

00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:19.160
 - The record for most hornings

00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:21.600
 is by a guy called Antonio Barrera,

00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:23.840
 who has been horned 23 times.

00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:25.840
 - Is that a good record?

00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:26.800
 Do you want that guy on your team?

00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:27.840
 - The guy from Guinness is saying,

00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:29.720
 "I'm so sorry, I missed the 16th morning,

00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:31.440
 "so we're not gonna gather a record."

00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:33.880
 - Wait, how many of those were the same occasion?

00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:34.880
 - They were all different occasions.

00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:36.040
 - Oh, blimey.

00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:39.280
 - The most common place to be horned by bull.

00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:40.240
 - Spain, I imagine.

00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:45.840
 - Are you a buddy?

00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:46.680
 - That'll be in Boston.

00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:47.520
 - In the ring. - Is he running away?

00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:50.200
 - In the ring, now in the upper leg.

00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:53.320
 And second place is the perineal area.

00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:54.880
 - Second most popular, that's a show.

00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:55.960
 Do they have guards?

00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:56.920
 Do they wear boxes?

00:40:56.920 --> 00:40:57.760
 - No, they don't.

00:40:57.760 --> 00:40:58.600
 - Bullfighters.

00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:01.320
 - No, no, they were very tight trousers, don't they?

00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:02.520
 - If only there was some system

00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:05.440
 where there could be some kind of clown in the ring,

00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:07.920
 who was able to distract the attention of the bull.

00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:09.480
 - Well, some rodeo clown idiot.

00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:11.480
 - I guess you'd call them that, yeah.

00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:14.920
 Have you heard of the German island of Borkum?

00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:15.760
 - No.

00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:17.480
 - This is a place that has a Christmas festival

00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:19.000
 called Klassholm, right?

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:20.320
 Or Klassholm.

00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:23.320
 And they had this tradition for many, many years there

00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:25.280
 where men dress up in elaborate costumes

00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:28.320
 and spank women with cow horns on the bottom.

00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:30.720
 And this led to controversy recently

00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:32.200
 because a lot of the women said,

00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:33.840
 actually, we really don't like this.

00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:35.400
 - Stop using the pointy end.

00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:37.440
 - Well, I mean, we don't like being spanked,

00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:38.960
 or, you know, we're being spanked without permission

00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:39.800
 on Christmas.

00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:41.360
 But last year there was a huge crackdown

00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:43.600
 on cow horns spanking on Borkum.

00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:45.760
 And it passed without any spanking

00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:46.880
 and without any complaints.

00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:48.000
 Certainly without any complaints.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.320
 There may have been private consensual cow horns spanking.

00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:51.480
 - I think that's fine.

00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:52.320
 - Absolutely.

00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:54.000
 And in fact, when there was this big protest,

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:54.920
 like loads of the women saying,

00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:56.760
 can you stop hitting us with cow horns on the bum

00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:57.600
 every Christmas?

00:41:57.600 --> 00:41:58.520
 This is not fun.

00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:00.560
 A couple of hundred women did launch a counter protest

00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:01.640
 saying, we love it.

00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:03.260
 It's our way of life.

00:42:03.260 --> 00:42:04.520
 This is our tradition.

00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:07.720
 So there's definitely debate.

00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:08.560
 But for the moment,

00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:12.520
 it appears that the involuntary cow horns spanking is over.

00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:14.560
 Why don't the women just spank the men back?

00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:16.720
 Or, I'm sorry, is that the Daily Mail comments

00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:17.560
 coming out again?

00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:19.400
 (laughing)

00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:20.680
 - I think that takes the fun out of it.

00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:21.840
 It's like giving someone a wedgie.

00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:23.320
 It's not as fun giving someone a wedgie, is it?

00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:24.760
 If you have to say beforehand,

00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:25.960
 is it okay if I give you a wedgie?

00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:26.800
 - Are we saying, Anna,

00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:28.720
 that consent takes the fun out of things?

00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:32.520
 'Cause I do think we're on thin ice.

00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:33.760
 (laughing)

00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:36.340
 (upbeat music)

00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:40.720
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show.

00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:42.120
 And that is Anna.

00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:44.240
 My fact this week is that Jack Kerouac

00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:48.720
 wrote his most famous novel on one long scroll.

00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:50.720
 - Was it sold in scroll form ever?

00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:51.560
 - Yeah.

00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:53.680
 - The audio box started, oh, yay, oh, yay.

00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:55.920
 (laughing)

00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:57.720
 - That's an interesting question.

00:42:57.720 --> 00:43:00.800
 It sort of is today, but not at the time.

00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:03.440
 - It has, as in that scroll has been sold.

00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:05.160
 - I think, yeah, that scroll, you're right.

00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:06.080
 You can go and visit it.

00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:08.000
 I can't remember what, it's in a museum somewhere.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.040
 - It's owned by, or it was owned.

00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:11.120
 Unfortunately, he died this year.

00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:13.640
 Jim Erse, who owns the Indianapolis Colts

00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:14.600
 American football team.

00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:15.440
 - Okay.

00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:16.280
 - Yeah.

00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:18.560
 - Obviously, that's where it, who it would be owned by.

00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:19.400
 (laughing)

00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:21.080
 - Yeah, no, he's a big, maybe we'll talk about it later.

00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:22.880
 Let's get into the fact that he was a huge collector

00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:23.840
 of this guy.

00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:24.680
 - Oh, cool.

00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:27.160
 - Yeah, I've got a big old list of other cool things he has.

00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:29.880
 - All right, well, excited to skip ahead to that.

00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:32.800
 But first of all, Jack Kerouac.

00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:34.280
 Yeah, he wrote on a long scroll

00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:35.600
 and basically he got annoyed

00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:37.640
 'cause he was a writer who typed very fast

00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:39.720
 and it all came flowing through him

00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:41.280
 and out of his fingertips.

00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:43.360
 And he thought you should never have to pause or stop

00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:44.840
 or have your flow interrupted.

00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:47.440
 - Or think, or think at all about the next sentence.

00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:50.240
 Maybe I'll put a main verb in this one, that kind of stuff.

00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:51.800
 Why would you think about the next sentence

00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:53.640
 considering it's about five pages away?

00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:55.080
 (laughing)

00:43:55.080 --> 00:43:57.200
 Which we should say if you read any Jack Kerouac,

00:43:57.200 --> 00:43:59.880
 it is very stream of consciousness.

00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:00.720
 - Yes.

00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:01.560
 - It's interesting.

00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:02.400
 Maybe we'll also get into a big debate

00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:03.760
 of who likes his style and who doesn't.

00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:07.640
 I think I know around this table who's gonna be the fan.

00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:10.880
 But he didn't like to reload his typewriter

00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:11.880
 with bits of paper.

00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:13.200
 So he got this massive scroll.

00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:14.840
 It was made of like teletype paper,

00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:17.080
 kind of like tracing paper, thick tracing paper.

00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:18.920
 And he taped it all together.

00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:21.920
 And then he made a 120 foot long scroll.

00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:24.760
 This was in 1951 and he was writing on the road.

00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:27.840
 - That was the name of the book.

00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:28.680
 - Sorry.

00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:29.520
 - Sorry, yeah.

00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:32.600
 He was writing in his bedroom, but on the road.

00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:35.560
 And when he was finished, he marched into his editor's office

00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:37.320
 who was a guy called Robert Giroux.

00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:40.360
 And he was unspun the scroll across the floor

00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:42.000
 like you would unroll a rug.

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:43.760
 And Giroux just said,

00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:46.120
 Jack, don't you realize that's not how authors

00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:47.160
 present manuscripts?

00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:48.480
 I can't do anything with this.

00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:49.320
 Take it away.

00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:50.160
 - I think he did know

00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:51.800
 that that's not how you present manuscripts.

00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:54.880
 Also, it is often presented as if he did the stream

00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:56.240
 of consciousness he handed it over.

00:44:56.240 --> 00:44:57.080
 And that's it.

00:44:57.080 --> 00:44:57.900
 That's not the case.

00:44:57.900 --> 00:44:59.880
 He spent years and years editing it.

00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:01.760
 It's a very highly edited document.

00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:04.040
 - Not that it seems like it, but yeah.

00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:05.400
 - Should we say who Jack Kerouac is?

00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:08.520
 Briefly, like American part of the beat generation,

00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:11.520
 post-war counter-cultural writers

00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:14.880
 who were rebelling against the way America was.

00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:16.520
 You know, that was the basic movement.

00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:19.120
 And Jack Kerouac was a huge part of it with On the Road,

00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:21.280
 which is extremely famous, you know?

00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:22.120
 - Yeah.

00:45:22.120 --> 00:45:24.400
 And what's interesting is he influenced a lot

00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:26.120
 of these people like Ken Kessie,

00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:28.520
 who wrote One Flew the Cuckoo's Nest,

00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:30.680
 Alan Ginsberg, the poet.

00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:31.560
 - William Burroughs.

00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:33.280
 - Yeah, if he gave the name to William Burroughs'

00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:35.160
 probably most famous novel, Naked Lunch.

00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:37.360
 That was something that he came up with.

00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:38.760
 But when he wrote On the Road,

00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:41.040
 he did spend all those years trying to get it published

00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:42.040
 and editing it.

00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:44.000
 And in the meantime, everyone who was influenced

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.760
 by reading copies of it got their own stuff published.

00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:49.360
 So it ended up looking like Kerouac was copying off them,

00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:52.040
 when in fact he was the influence for this whole generation.

00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:54.440
 - Yes, 'cause it only ended up being published in 1957,

00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:55.280
 we should say.

00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:57.280
 So he proposed it in 1951.

00:45:57.280 --> 00:45:59.720
 The editor said, "Take it away and tie it into a proper book."

00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:02.440
 And so he then did type it out on normal pages.

00:46:02.440 --> 00:46:03.600
 But no one would take it.

00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:04.680
 All the publishers said,

00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:06.400
 "We think this is kind of a work of genius,

00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:08.920
 "but no one's gonna care about the subject matter."

00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:10.520
 - And the subject matter is?

00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:12.640
 - It's basically a big old road trip.

00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:14.360
 It's none of his books and novels,

00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:15.840
 and I hate it when people refer to them as that,

00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:18.760
 'cause they're all completely true to his own life.

00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:20.160
 They're his autobiography, basically.

00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:21.000
 And this was a bit of work.

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:22.920
 - They're exaggerated autobiographies, aren't they?

00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:25.880
 - Yeah, so it's him traveling around with his mates.

00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:27.640
 And they all put each other in each other's books,

00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:30.480
 don't they, Ginsberg does and Burroughs does.

00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:32.760
 He also, incidentally, named Ginsberg's most famous book,

00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:33.600
 Howl.

00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:35.440
 So he named the three most famous books

00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:36.600
 of the B-generation.

00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:38.280
 - His real skill was naming books.

00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:40.080
 (all laughing)

00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:41.720
 - All these books that he did,

00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:45.360
 which were semi-autobiographical and with all his mates in,

00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:48.600
 the liars of his publishers made him change all the names

00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:49.920
 for obvious reasons.

00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:51.800
 There was lots of stuff happening in those books

00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:54.080
 that they might object to.

00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:57.440
 But Kerouac's intention was towards the end of his life,

00:46:57.440 --> 00:46:59.240
 he was gonna get all of his old books,

00:46:59.240 --> 00:47:00.680
 and he was gonna republish them all

00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:04.000
 as one enormous scroll from start to finish,

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:05.520
 but then change all the names back

00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:07.360
 so that we got all the people's names out.

00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:08.200
 - Oh, that's good.

00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:09.360
 - But then he died quite young, I think.

00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:11.720
 - He died really, yeah, he died in the late 60s.

00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:13.520
 - Sorry, can I just say that has been done now,

00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:15.760
 just to make sense of what I said earlier,

00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:17.720
 I think Viking Press in about 2011

00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:19.560
 released the original scroll,

00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:21.280
 which is with all the original names,

00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:23.120
 and it's with no paragraph breaks and written--

00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:25.480
 - I've got it at home, it's a beast of a book.

00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:28.200
 I haven't read it, I mean, just no way, but it's--

00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:30.200
 - And there you go, that's the fan reveal.

00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:31.960
 - But I'm a fan of the counterculture,

00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:33.600
 I've not actually read Kerouac,

00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:35.360
 because it's a difficult read.

00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:37.720
 - Yeah, a stream of consciousness is harder.

00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:39.520
 Can I give you one more version of that meeting

00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:42.840
 with Robert Giroux, who was one of his previous editors,

00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:45.240
 and then he'd written short stories and things like that.

00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:47.040
 He turns up at the office with the manuscript,

00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:50.240
 with the scroll, throws it on the floor,

00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:52.760
 and this is according to Robert Giroux.

00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:55.560
 He was very excited, this is Kerouac, I think he was high.

00:47:55.560 --> 00:47:57.280
 Anyway, I bent down to look at the thing,

00:47:57.280 --> 00:47:59.040
 and after a few moments, I looked up and said,

00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:01.240
 "Well, Jack, this is going to have to be cut up

00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:03.360
 "into pages and edited and so on."

00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:05.600
 Jack just looked at me and his face had darkened,

00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:07.760
 and he said, "There'll be no editing.

00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:10.920
 "This book was dictated by the Holy Ghost."

00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:13.800
 And the book then went to a different publisher.

00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:15.080
 (laughing)

00:48:15.080 --> 00:48:16.720
 - You met him on a dating site, didn't you?

00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:18.720
 (laughing)

00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:21.000
 - Yeah, I think he was off his face quite a lot.

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:21.840
 - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:24.000
 - He was on Ben Zatrin when he did this,

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:25.880
 which is an amphetamine that a lot of people were on

00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:26.720
 at the time.

00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:30.400
 It was like a nasal spray, like a kind of pseudo Fred thing,

00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:33.960
 but then it made everyone, gave lots of people lots of energy

00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:35.800
 'cause it's basically amphetamines.

00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:37.200
 - It's not very cool though, is it?

00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:38.480
 It's not like-- - It's not cool now.

00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:41.840
 - The jazz guys trying to find a new vein for the horse.

00:48:41.840 --> 00:48:43.400
 It's like, if it's a nasal spray,

00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:45.880
 I do think that's an uncool administration

00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:46.920
 for a mind-altering drug.

00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:49.480
 - Yeah, I guess so, but it was cool at the time.

00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:50.320
 - Yeah.

00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:52.680
 - And then it kind of did go out of fashion.

00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:55.360
 - And he went out of fashion within his own circle as well.

00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:56.520
 That's one of the tragic things.

00:48:56.520 --> 00:48:59.280
 But he did die young, I think he was 47 when he died.

00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:01.960
 And even his friends, his closest friends,

00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:05.040
 like Alan Ginsberg, didn't want to know him at that point.

00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:08.040
 He had turned from this amazingly magnetic character

00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:11.080
 that basically defined this whole movement

00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:13.720
 to someone who became very bitter, very angry.

00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:17.680
 - He used to write newspapers about Boy Scout badges changing.

00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:18.960
 They got quite right-winged in the end.

00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:20.920
 He was always quite racist.

00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:22.080
 - But those letters to the newspapers,

00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:24.520
 they were so long, they couldn't get in.

00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:26.640
 - They were all on little scrolls, so sad.

00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:28.400
 You know, the original On The Road,

00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:30.480
 a dog ate part of his homework?

00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:31.320
 - Yes.

00:49:31.320 --> 00:49:32.160
 - Yeah, genuinely.

00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:33.000
 - Really.

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:34.240
 - It was auctioned some years ago,

00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:37.800
 and the condition notes noted that the final 25 pages,

00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:39.920
 or equivalent of, had been chewed and torn away

00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:41.640
 by a dog belonging to Kerouac's friend

00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:43.040
 in April or May, 1951.

00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:44.440
 - But the thing is that no one who read it

00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:46.400
 ever got up to the last 25 pages,

00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:48.400
 so no one ever noticed.

00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:51.600
 - On The Road was published in 1957, was a huge hit.

00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:53.880
 And immediately he couldn't handle it.

00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:55.480
 He just like, he sort of had a breakdown.

00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:57.000
 His publisher said he ended up like lying

00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:58.760
 on the floor staring at the ceiling,

00:49:58.760 --> 00:50:00.960
 not knowing what to do, became terrible alcoholic.

00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:03.240
 - I think we said that he went to a lookout tower,

00:50:03.240 --> 00:50:04.080
 didn't he?

00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:05.080
 Was that after that as well?

00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:06.040
 - Oh yes, that's right.

00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:09.200
 - He kind of just lived on his own for months and months

00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:11.440
 in the middle of the forest looking for fires.

00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:12.280
 - Did you find any?

00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:15.560
 - No, he didn't, but apparently he did leave behind him

00:50:15.560 --> 00:50:19.320
 a column of feces about the height and size of a baby.

00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:22.360
 - Why, what an upsetting simile point.

00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:24.560
 For your column of feces.

00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:27.080
 There's so much else you could compare it to,

00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:28.800
 like a melon or a melon.

00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:29.640
 - A melon?

00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:31.120
 - Melons are smaller than babies.

00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:31.960
 - How big are your melons?

00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:34.120
 - Excuse me, how small are your babies?

00:50:34.120 --> 00:50:35.800
 (laughing)

00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:38.480
 Alan, we're not getting into motorboats again.

00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:40.880
 - Do you know the only reason he became so famous

00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:42.440
 and it all ruined him anyway?

00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:45.600
 It was because of one review he got in The New York Times.

00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:47.840
 So if the review had not been printed,

00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:49.440
 he would have probably stayed a small time.

00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:51.760
 He was a small time before it came out, right?

00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:55.320
 But the main reviewer, a guy called Orville Prescott,

00:50:55.320 --> 00:50:58.960
 hated him, hated his stuff, but he was away on holiday.

00:50:58.960 --> 00:51:00.600
 And so there was a different reviewer

00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:02.240
 who just got drafted in for holiday cover

00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:04.120
 called Gilbert Milstein.

00:51:04.120 --> 00:51:06.240
 And he gave it the biggest smash hit review

00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:07.560
 The New York Times had ever given anything.

00:51:07.560 --> 00:51:10.800
 He said, "It's publication is a historic occasion.

00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:13.760
 "The writing is of a beauty almost breathtaking."

00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:15.720
 And this gave the book absolute rocket fuel

00:51:15.720 --> 00:51:17.120
 that made it a huge success.

00:51:17.120 --> 00:51:19.880
 Prescott, who was the main guy in charge of reviewing,

00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:21.440
 was so angry about this.

00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:23.200
 He almost didn't allow it to go in.

00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:25.080
 And then he fired Gilbert Milstein.

00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:28.120
 He was never hired again to write The New York Times

00:51:28.120 --> 00:51:30.720
 because he loved this stream of consciousness,

00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:33.240
 hard to read, beat generation thing.

00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:34.080
 - Yeah. - Wow.

00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:35.280
 - Love it, all you hate it.

00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:37.640
 - Well, listen guys, I can hear the audience at home.

00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:40.040
 Script, well, I can hear at least my mom screaming.

00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:43.440
 Tell us about the collection that Jim Ersey had.

00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:44.280
 - Ah, yes.

00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:45.120
 - In which.

00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:45.960
 - Can we scroll this content?

00:51:45.960 --> 00:51:46.800
 - Why not tell us who this guy is?

00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:49.560
 - So he was the owner of the Colts,

00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:50.680
 the football team in America.

00:51:50.680 --> 00:51:52.480
 And he bought up the scroll.

00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:54.840
 And it's part of this big traveling collection that he has.

00:51:54.840 --> 00:51:56.720
 So he has the big book,

00:51:56.720 --> 00:51:59.440
 the original Alcoholics Anonymous book,

00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:01.360
 the first manuscript that was ever written.

00:52:01.360 --> 00:52:03.440
 - Oh, I thought you went with everyone's names.

00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:05.920
 (all laughing)

00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:08.800
 - It's Alcoholics Not Anonymous.

00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:10.600
 - That's the Compromat book.

00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:12.720
 Just one guy is allowed to know who you are.

00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:15.400
 - No, this was the original book

00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:18.520
 that William or Bill W. Wilson had written.

00:52:18.520 --> 00:52:20.120
 - Actually, wasn't that the Holy Ghost

00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:21.160
 who gave him that as well?

00:52:21.160 --> 00:52:22.240
 - He was, you're right.

00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:23.520
 You're right, it was a huge episode

00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:24.640
 for the Holy Ghost, this one.

00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:26.360
 (all laughing)

00:52:26.360 --> 00:52:28.920
 He has two tickets from the performance

00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:31.160
 of our American cousin for Ford's Theatre,

00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:33.240
 the night that Lincoln was assassinated.

00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:36.120
 He's got a rocking chair that was used by JFK

00:52:36.120 --> 00:52:37.400
 inside the White House.

00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:39.640
 - I should just say, he did die this year.

00:52:39.640 --> 00:52:40.960
 - He did die. - He keeps saying he has.

00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:43.280
 - Sorry, he did, he died just over a month ago.

00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:44.480
 - Well, he'll be getting a chance

00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:45.760
 to chat to the Holy Ghost, won't he?

00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:46.600
 That's exciting.

00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:47.960
 (all laughing)

00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:49.960
 - He has the greatest collection of guitars.

00:52:49.960 --> 00:52:51.200
 - Yeah. - In the world.

00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:52.880
 Or he has, I should say, again.

00:52:52.880 --> 00:52:55.960
 It was called that in the Guitar Magazine in 2021.

00:52:55.960 --> 00:52:59.600
 And every famous guitarist you can name, he has.

00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:02.000
 - Eric Clapton.

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:03.200
 - George Harrison. - Jimmy Bage.

00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:04.560
 - Django Reinhardt.

00:53:04.560 --> 00:53:05.920
 - Oh. - What the fuck?

00:53:05.920 --> 00:53:06.760
 - I just don't think

00:53:06.760 --> 00:53:07.600
 you've written them all down.

00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:09.520
 - No, I haven't. - I bet he does though.

00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:10.560
 - I think Betty does have a Django.

00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:11.480
 - Yeah, I'm sure he does.

00:53:11.480 --> 00:53:13.600
 'Cause I was really hoping that you would just name

00:53:13.600 --> 00:53:16.280
 any of these 20 names that I have on my list.

00:53:16.280 --> 00:53:17.120
 - Give us one or two.

00:53:17.120 --> 00:53:17.960
 - Oh, okay. - No, I mean,

00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:19.280
 Elvis, George Harrison, John Lennon,

00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:21.480
 Paul McCartney, Jerry Garcia, Prince Les Paul,

00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:22.320
 blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:23.160
 - Kurt Cobain.

00:53:23.160 --> 00:53:25.040
 He has Kurt Cobain's Nevermind guitar.

00:53:25.040 --> 00:53:27.960
 It's like one of the most iconic grunge guitars you've ever had.

00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:29.400
 - Just the guitar he brings out at a party

00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:30.880
 and they say, "Oh, for fuck's sake."

00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:32.200
 Nevermind, nevermind, nevermind.

00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:33.400
 (all laughing)

00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:35.980
 (upbeat music)

00:53:35.980 --> 00:53:39.120
 - Okay, that's it.

00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:40.080
 That is all of our facts.

00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:41.400

 Goodbye.

00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:34.220
 (upbeat music)

00:54:34.220 --> 00:54:36.800
