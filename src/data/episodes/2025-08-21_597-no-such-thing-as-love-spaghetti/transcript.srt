1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,920
 - Hey everyone, welcome to another episode of Fish.

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,200
 Before we get going, I just wanna quickly let you know

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,040
 about two very exciting global live streaming events

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,200
 that we are gonna be doing

6
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,800
 on the fifth and sixth of September.

7
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,600
 So we're gonna be playing the London podcast festival

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,960
 and as well as playing to a live room full of people

9
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,320
 at Kings Place in London,

10
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,040
 we will be live streaming the event

11
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,240
 so that you can watch it from wherever you are in the world.

12
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,680
 So for those who have never made it to a live show before

13
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,520
 and always wondered what it's like,

14
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,240
 this is the full experience.

15
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,920
 This is a sort of warts and all version

16
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:34,760
 that you'll get to see.

17
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,920
 It's all the bloopers, it's all the extra bits

18
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,660
 that end up getting edited out.

19
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:41,120
 There's all the admin at the top of the show.

20
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,080
 Who doesn't love admin at the top of a show?

21
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,880
 Imagine getting to see that.

22
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,120
 It's gonna be a great night.

23
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,120
 Also, as Anne is now off on maternity,

24
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,920
 we're gonna be joined by some really fun guests.

25
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,520
 We've already sort of announced one of them on Instagram,

26
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,440
 but if you didn't see that video on the sixth of September,

27
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:00,040
 we are gonna be joined by one of the UK's best-selling authors

28
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,360
 of all time, Richard Osman.

29
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,320
 That's gonna be an awesome show, that's on the sixth.

30
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,920
 We'll be making another announcement

31
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,880
 for who will be joining us on the fifth soon,

32
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,800
 but in the meantime, if you wanna get tickets,

33
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,240
 they are available now.

34
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,680
 Just go to knowsuchthingasafish.com/live

35
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,280
 and get your live streaming tickets now.

36
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,560
 All right, last thing to say before we get into the show

37
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,320
 is some very exciting news back at QIHQ.

38
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,840
 The Lunchbox MV podcast has been picked up by BBC Sounds.

39
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,560
 So if you happen to listen to your podcast there,

40
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,880
 do type in the words "Lunchbox MV now"

41
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,320
 and you'll be able to get access

42
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,040
 to the most quite interesting food-based podcast

43
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,960
 there is in podcast land.

44
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,000
 Each episode deals with a different kind of food.

45
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,760
 So the episode that went up a few days ago

46
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,960
 was all about cheese,

47
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,440
 where they answer the big cheese questions,

48
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,960
 like, you know, how do they put the holes in Swiss cheese?

49
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,480
 Who eats the world's hardest cheese?

50
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,600
 Why do people put Parmesan into a bank?

51
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,440
 All the biggies.

52
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,600
 And there's over 30 episodes you can access now,

53
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,360
 everything from pastry through to butter and chocolate.

54
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,440
 You must check them out,

55
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:00,360
 but specifically do check them out now at BBC Sounds.

56
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,040
 All right, let's get into the show.

57
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,320
 On with the podcast.

58
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:09,800
 (upbeat music)

59
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:21,920
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

60
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,480
 of No Such Thing as a Fish,

61
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,120
 a weekly podcast coming to you

62
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,080
 from the QI offices in Hoburn.

63
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,200
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

64
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,280
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,

65
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,320
 James Harkin, and Andrew Hunter Murray.

66
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,520
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

67
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,600
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

68
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,840
 And in no particular order, here we go.

69
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,840
 Starting with fact number one, and that is James.

70
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,360
 - Okay, my fact this week is that

71
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,400
 if you are 20 years old now,

72
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,040
 there is a chance that your great grandparents

73
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,000
 might have met thanks to computer dating.

74
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,240
 - That's wild. - It doesn't make sense.

75
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,760
 I had to ask James to explain this,

76
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,640
 even after we'd said this would be our fact.

77
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,320
 That doesn't work, James, and he proved it.

78
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,360
 Go on, prove it.

79
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,720
 - So for the hard of thinking who are listening,

80
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,440
 this is an article that I read,

81
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,160
 was written by Adrian Covert in Gizmodo,

82
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,960
 and it's about a guy called Lewis Altfest.

83
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,320
 And Lewis saw a Pempal machine,

84
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,200
 which let you fill down his questionnaire,

85
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,920
 and then it fed it into a machine,

86
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,880
 and it found you the perfect Pempal.

87
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:27,320
 And he decided that he would do the same with dating.

88
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,360
 So he called up his friend called Robert Ross,

89
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,200
 who worked at IBM, and they made a computer program

90
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,720
 called TACT that stood for Technical

91
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,240
 Automated Compatibility Testing.

92
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,920
 They did that in New York, and it was in 1964.

93
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,040
 So, for instance, if your great-grandparents

94
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,360
 got together due to TACT in 1964,

95
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,120
 your grandmother could be born in 1965.

96
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,880
 She could have had your mother in 1985,

97
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,240
 and then your mother could have had you in 2005,

98
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,800
 and you would be 20 this year.

99
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,920
 - Yeah. - It's stunning.

100
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,880
 - It was great.

101
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,160
 - It was amazing at the time.

102
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,880
 It was such like everyone thought computers

103
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,880
 would know the answer as well.

104
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,280
 It wasn't the best at pairing people.

105
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,520
 It did at one point match an older brother

106
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,840
 with his younger sister.

107
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,200
 (all laughing)

108
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,400
 - They have a lot in common with it.

109
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,440
 - And I turned out fine.

110
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,760
 (all laughing)

111
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,600
 - Yeah, that actually weirdly, I think shows it does work.

112
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,040
 Shared interests.

113
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,040
 - It just, you haven't put in the anti-incest layer

114
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,880
 into the program.

115
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,960
 - You haven't clicked that button.

116
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,320
 Most people would click that button.

117
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,160
 (all laughing)

118
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,200
 - He was crossing his fingers, that guy.

119
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,440
 - So, is this the one, 'cause I read about

120
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,320
 one of the very early computer dating services,

121
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,320
 and it asks clients to pick from the dislikes,

122
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,400
 and the dislikes were, I'd say, very much of their time.

123
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,880
 - Yes, this is the one you're talking about.

124
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,960
 - From one to six, it was,

125
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,920
 what do you think about affected people?

126
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,040
 I think that's a really good question.

127
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,120
 Like, I'm a bit affected, you know?

128
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,160
 - You mean like people who have affectations.

129
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,120
 - Exactly, a bit pretentious.

130
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,120
 I presume, and that still means they've been affected

131
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:53,960
 by an event. - Oh, okay.

132
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,480
 I thought it wasn't a typo for infected, 'cause that--

133
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,920
 (all laughing)

134
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,960
 - But who's saying I love those?

135
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,400
 Are there people going--

136
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,800
 - Well, after '60s, some people had affectations

137
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,920
 in the '60s, and that was cool.

138
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,040
 It was the New Age, man.

139
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,720
 - But I think like, it wasn't that you only picked

140
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,880
 one of them, you kind of picked them in order.

141
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,840
 - Oh, okay. - That kind of thing.

142
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,200
 - 'Cause two through six that you might dislike were,

143
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:16,280
 birth control, foreigners, free love, homosexuals,

144
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,400
 and interracial marriage.

145
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,440
 But it never says sisters, so.

146
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,020
 (all laughing)

147
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:25,240
 Yeah, that was true.

148
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,760
 So you paid $5, basically,

149
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,320
 and you would answer loads of questions.

150
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,680
 You would also, the men would be asked

151
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,920
 to rank women's hairstyles.

152
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,640
 Women would be shown pictures of men in different settings.

153
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:38,400
 So there'd be a man chopping wood, a man who was painting,

154
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,560
 and a man who was in a garage working with a drill.

155
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,080
 And you had to say which of those you fancy the most.

156
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,080
 - The drill and the chopping wood are very similar, aren't they?

157
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,800
 What are the two different personality types?

158
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,640
 - Well, some people are more discerning than you, Anna.

159
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,960
 (all laughing)

160
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,680
 - That just sounds like outdoorsy versus indoorsy to me.

161
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,720
 - I suppose, drill is indoorsy.

162
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,640
 - I think like chopping wood shows muscular strength,

163
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,680
 whereas drill shows more kind of industrial ability.

164
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,720
 - DIY maybe. - Yeah, yeah.

165
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,040
 - And these things, they started off,

166
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,160
 and they were kind of thought of as a gimmick.

167
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,640
 So for instance, this guy at Altfest,

168
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,840
 he just gave up in the end on his tact.

169
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:17,040
 But actually he met his partner due to tact.

170
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,320
 - Did he? - Yeah, so he married a reporter

171
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,880
 who'd come to interview him

172
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,720
 about how terrible his machine was.

173
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,960
 (all laughing)

174
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,320
 And they hit it off.

175
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,160
 - Yeah, they were funny.

176
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,040
 There was another one in 1965 in New York,

177
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,440
 which was called Operation Match.

178
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:33,400
 I was reading the memories of someone who went on one of those

179
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,600
 and had three very unsuccessful dates.

180
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,240
 But the way all these things worked, I guess,

181
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,760
 is you sent in a bit of money

182
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,160
 and you filled out a questionnaire,

183
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,000
 which could be very long.

184
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,280
 So Operation Match was 75 questions.

185
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,600
 And then they took your questionnaire

186
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,960
 and they tried to match it up with others

187
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,480
 using a computer algorithm,

188
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,640
 which is why it was computerized or computer dating.

189
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,960
 But the questions were,

190
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,120
 I couldn't look out why this one existed.

191
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,240
 So there was a question in this one,

192
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,120
 which was, I'd considered dating a woman as young as,

193
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,640
 or a man as old as.

194
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:07,640
 So if you're a man, it was a woman as young as 17 or whatever.

195
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,040
 And if you were a woman,

196
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,640
 it was like I considered dating a man as old as that.

197
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,480
 - Yeah, right.

198
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,320
 - But you wouldn't ask a woman,

199
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,600
 I considered dating a man as young as.

200
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,920
 Did it just assume that women could,

201
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,920
 would date men who were infinitely young?

202
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,760
 - The cougar had not been invented.

203
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,720
 That's what we're saying.

204
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,360
 - Yeah, I think that is what we're saying.

205
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,200
 Yeah. - Yeah, I suppose so.

206
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,040
 - Very weird.

207
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,800
 And then are you sexually experienced or inexperienced?

208
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,080
 And also, what does this mean?

209
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,720
 Is extensive sexual activity preparation for your marriage?

210
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,800
 Yes or no?

211
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,480
 - Answer, see previous questions.

212
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:41,800
 So Operation Match was invented by Jeff Tarr and Vaughn Morrill.

213
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,680
 Jeff Tarr met his wife,

214
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,920
 not by going on and doing it himself,

215
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,080
 but someone who was using Operation Match said,

216
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,880
 "Oh, I know someone who you'd be good with."

217
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,800
 So they met up, they got married.

218
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,360
 They had a daughter called Jennifer.

219
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,480
 She goes on to marry the co-founder of OKCupid.

220
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,320
 - No.

221
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,160
 - Yeah. - Whoa.

222
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,240
 - Yeah, so. - Tasty.

223
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,440
 - Yeah.

224
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,480
 - So dating apps are declining a lot, right?

225
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,360
 In the UK, I think users are dropping.

226
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,480
 - Oh, really? - Of the really big sites.

227
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,840
 Things like Tinder.

228
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,880
 And it's because people get exhausted

229
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,080
 and they get burned out with them.

230
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,320
 And it's just this endless array of new faces.

231
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,360
 You can start thinking everyone's the same.

232
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,720
 And it's also, it's very sort of private.

233
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,360
 So the pool of dates is massive,

234
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,720
 but you don't have any friends in common.

235
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,520
 So people often behave badly,

236
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,960
 they don't get back in touch or whatever.

237
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,880
 - I see.

238
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,480
 Yeah, so if you date someone who's a friend of your friend,

239
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,800
 then you kind of feel like you can't be an asshole

240
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,800
 because it will get back to you.

241
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,120
 - There's a shame mechanism there.

242
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,480
 Whereas you can absolutely just go

243
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,120
 to some random person you've met once and all that.

244
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:35,960
 Anyway. - Oh, thank you.

245
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,520
 - I don't know.

246
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:40,440
 But I found this claim that some sites

247
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,960
 are saying things like, if you pay a lot extra,

248
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,440
 like if you pay 45 quid a month,

249
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,600
 you'll go on three times as many dates, right?

250
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,440
 - Okay.

251
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,440
 - So, this is just to say, yesterday I said to my wife,

252
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,680
 I'm downloading Hinge by the way,

253
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,560
 'cause I wanted to test if there are special offers on.

254
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,200
 But what I forgot to say was that I was doing

255
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,680
 this as part of podcast research.

256
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,120
 From her perspective, I just said, I'm downloading Hinge.

257
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,400
 I want to see if there's got special offers

258
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,320
 on right now.

259
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,160
 - Okay.

260
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,760
 - Let's not put out this fact ever.

261
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,000
 And then she'll never have caught to believe

262
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,360
 that's what you were doing.

263
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,280
 I really, I think my favorite thing is Love Getty.

264
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,240
 Did you come across this gadget?

265
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,120
 It, 1.3 million was sold.

266
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,360
 So it was quite popular.

267
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,280
 - Is it Spaghetti?

268
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,960
 Love Spaghetti.

269
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,840
 - It's just for people who love Spaghetti, yes.

270
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,800
 - Is it not people who just love John Paul Getty?

271
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,000
 - It's neither of these things.

272
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,840
 - Or Getty Images?

273
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,680
 Is that the--

274
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,520
 (laughing)

275
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,340
 - Any further guesses?

276
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,360
 It's like, Get You Love, Love Getty.

277
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,200
 It's a love getter.

278
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,520
 - Got it, yeah.

279
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,520
 - There we go.

280
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,920
 And this was a thing in Japan in 1998.

281
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,800
 Basically, it was a thing that you kept in your pocket.

282
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,400
 And if you saw someone who was a bit fit,

283
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,000
 then you turned it on.

284
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,120
 And it meant that if they had the same gadget,

285
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,880
 then their gadget would buzz.

286
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,280
 Or you keep yours on all the time.

287
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,520
 And whenever you were within 15 feet of someone

288
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,240
 who had a gadget that was also turned on,

289
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,080
 it would buzz and you could be like, oh my God,

290
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,920
 something's buzzing.

291
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,880
 - Can I just say,

292
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,840
 so what you do is when you see someone attractive,

293
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,480
 you start fiddling in your pockets.

294
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,680
 (laughing)

295
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,520
 I mean, yeah.

296
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,360
 - It was a small vibration.

297
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,400
 - I don't think you need a buzzer.

298
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,240
 I think people are gonna know what you think immediately.

299
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,680
 It's such a bad idea.

300
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,640
 Like it's a stalker's charter.

301
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,440
 - But also the flaw seems to be that,

302
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,400
 let's say I'm looking across the room at Barry,

303
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,480
 and I think he's hot, and I turn my thing on.

304
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,480
 And Barry doesn't have one of these love getties,

305
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,760
 but Norman on the other side of the tube carriage

306
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,600
 does have one.

307
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,440
 His goes off, and then he's looking at me,

308
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,760
 thinking she fancies me.

309
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,600
 - She's fiddling in her pants.

310
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,200
 - She's fiddling.

311
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,960
 - Is that a love getty in her pocket?

312
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,040
 (laughing)

313
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,480
 In Spain at the moment,

314
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,880
 if you go to supermarkets after seven o'clock,

315
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,320
 you might not be able to get a pineapple.

316
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,160
 - Okay.

317
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:46,980
 - Okay.

318
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:47,820
 - Is this research for this part?

319
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,400
 - Just to complain from my last holiday.

320
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,520
 No, so this is a TikTok video that's been going around

321
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,640
 telling people that if you're lonely

322
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:59,200
 to go to your nearest Mercadonia supermarket

323
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,420
 to take a pineapple and put it upside down

324
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,520
 in your shopping cart,

325
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,920
 and then see if anyone else is doing the same,

326
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,640
 and if two upside down panapples see each other,

327
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,080
 then they might get together.

328
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,760
 - So that's just like the love getty.

329
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,120
 It's a slightly more basic version of love getty,

330
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,400
 but at least you've got deniability.

331
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,400
 Whereas if you've got a love getty, it buzzes.

332
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,560
 Whereas if you've just got a pineapple,

333
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,240
 you could say, "Oh no, I'm just--"

334
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,400
 - It's upside down, though, isn't it?

335
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,240
 - It's just all that way.

336
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,320
 - I'm making a pina colada, whatever.

337
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,000
 - Well, the problem is that basically,

338
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,600
 the trend has taken off a little bit in Spain.

339
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,000
 Police have been called to unruly crowds

340
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,780
 of people trying to find pineapples.

341
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:36,300
 And employees of Mercadonia are so sick of it,

342
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,220
 they've been hiding their pineapples at five to seven,

343
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,720
 so no one can get them.

344
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,900
 (laughing)

345
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,660
 - It's a huge pain, people just walking around the shop

346
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,420
 with a single pineapple in their basket.

347
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,700
 Like, you're a business here.

348
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,780
 You're trying to sell other goods.

349
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,420
 - Do we not think they buy the pineapples at the end?

350
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,660
 Do you think some people probably just do it,

351
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,260
 get their date, and then put the pineapple back?

352
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:56,580
 - I think if you don't get the date, you would do that.

353
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,340
 If you do get the date, probably you want to show

354
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,100
 that you're not a skin flint and that you can afford

355
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,360
 to buy pineapples. - That's a really good point.

356
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,360
 I'll get this, darling.

357
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,240
 (laughing)

358
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,960
 - Does that happen here, or is that just in Spain?

359
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,880
 - Just in Spain, the supermarket chain Mercadonia

360
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,000
 has yet to get into the British market.

361
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,080
 - But next time, Andy, you're in a supermarket

362
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,680
 with your wife, just make sure it's the right way up.

363
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,440
 Bad and hinge combined, something's definitely going on.

364
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,440
 - Well, do you remember, actually, Madison,

365
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,040
 the cheating website?

366
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,000
 - No.

367
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,840
 - Do you not?

368
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,040
 (laughing)

369
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,600
 - Damn, that was so impossible.

370
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,780
 (laughing)

371
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,000
 - What, website?

372
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,500
 - Well, that's a list of hacked email addresses

373
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,340
 that's different.

374
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:35,980
 (laughing)

375
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,340
 - Okay, let's move on.

376
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,680
 Type it back on there, too.

377
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,220
 - No, no, no.

378
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,060
 This is amazing, right?

379
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,540
 So it was an affairs website, okay?

380
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:45,240
 It marketed itself to mostly blokes who say,

381
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,620
 "Hey, you want to have an affair?"

382
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,940
 Then join Ashley Madison.

383
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:50,500
 They were hacked into by some disgruntled staffers

384
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,340
 or former staff or something.

385
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:55,420
 And ha, ha, ha, it turned out 95% of the members

386
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,220
 of Ashley Madison were men, right?

387
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:59,000
 So that was the headline that went around the world.

388
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,680
 It was quite a big story at the time.

389
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,760
 The really interesting thing is,

390
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,800
 a journalist called Annalyn Newitz looked into it,

391
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,320
 found something much more perturbing.

392
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,880
 It was that the parent company,

393
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,040
 who were called Avid Live Media,

394
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:14,200
 had made 70,000 fake women bots.

395
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,480
 They would just say things like, "Hi, and what's up?"

396
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,440
 And the men thought they were talking to real women.

397
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:21,240
 Like, there were 11 million interactions in the database

398
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,400
 between human men and bot women,

399
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,680
 and the men were paying for every message.

400
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,520
 - Right.

401
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,960
 - And the company was paying workers

402
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,420
 to generate these fake profiles.

403
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:32,500
 So it was basically real people interacting with bots,

404
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,860
 having no idea about it.

405
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:36,060
 That's quite, that's the really sinister thing, you know?

406
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:38,900
 - And let's talk about our level of sympathy for these men.

407
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,820
 'Cause I suddenly feel really bad for them.

408
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,820
 But I suppose they had gone on a website

409
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,140
 to cheat on their wives.

410
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:46,100
 - In a way, they're doing something good, aren't they?

411
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,620
 This company, because this hypothetical man

412
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,820
 has gone on the website to cheat on his wife,

413
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,380
 but they're just putting a fake thing up

414
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,380
 that he can chat to.

415
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:55,340
 So he's not gonna be able to have the affair.

416
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,220
 What is sin?

417
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,400
 - I think it's what we're asking.

418
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,920
 He thinks he is sinning, so is he?

419
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:04,060
 If I'm just talking to a chatbot, that's for God's sake.

420
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:06,080
 - I remember years ago when there was the rise

421
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:09,840
 of niche dating places when I was single,

422
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,640
 I went on to, I think it was like a ghost hunter's

423
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,480
 dating site.

424
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,320
 - Of course you did.

425
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:19,320
 - Yeah, and I got on it and it's just all men.

426
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,360
 But--

427
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,180
 - The ghost dating.

428
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:23,360
 - Yeah, but their profiles with their blurb came up,

429
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,760
 and all of them sounded so interesting.

430
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,080
 So I actually messaged a couple.

431
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:26,920
 - No.

432
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:27,820
 - Yeah, just to say like, hey,

433
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,300
 can you tell me about ghost hunting?

434
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,380
 'Cause I'm not actually interested sexually.

435
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:34,020
 I'm just like, you sound really interesting.

436
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,740
 - Ooh, it's like to me.

437
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:41,060
 - I've got one last example of someone who made it big

438
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:43,740
 in the world of creating online dating,

439
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:47,340
 a guy called Gary Kremen who created match.com.

440
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:49,220
 What's impressive about him is he seemed to just

441
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:52,460
 cleaned up on domain names early on, right?

442
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,060
 'Cause that's where he's made a large fortune from.

443
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,560
 So he owned sex.com.

444
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,760
 Can you imagine owning sex.com, yeah.

445
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,720
 And there was a big case where someone forged fake documents

446
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,920
 so that the domain name went over to them,

447
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,160
 and he had to fight them for years and years,

448
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,640
 and there's now an outstanding bill of 65 million

449
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,000
 that is owed to Gary Kremen,

450
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,320
 which has not yet been paid by this person.

451
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,600
 - What's on sex.com, is it porn, I guess?

452
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,920
 - He was gonna use it in the way that he was using match.com,

453
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,200
 but match.com just flew into huge success immediately.

454
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,280
 So it was just kind of sitting there dormant.

455
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:26,280
 He also owned computer.com, which he sold for 500,000.

456
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:29,300
 But he set up match.com, and even his girlfriend

457
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,500
 found a partner on there, which wasn't him.

458
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,180
 She joined up and met someone else and left him.

459
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:36,220
 Yeah, and he said, "Look how successful it is."

460
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:38,540
 - What are you hoping for if you buy computer.com?

461
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,420
 It's just old people going on Google

462
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:42,900
 and typing computer.com, 'cause they think

463
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,020
 that's how they turn it on.

464
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,420
 - It's very much like Donald Trump saying

465
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:48,460
 everything is computer now, it's a bit, okay.

466
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:51,040
 (upbeat music)

467
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,240
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two,

468
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,600
 and that is my fact.

469
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,120
 My fact this week is that one of the original

470
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,440
 57 Boy Scout badges was the invention badge,

471
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,960
 which required kids to not only invent something new,

472
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,680
 but obtain a patent for it too.

473
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,080
 - It's so hard.

474
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,560
 - I mean, it's a lengthy process

475
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,560
 to get a patent in America for an invention.

476
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,400
 - Is it hard?

477
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,360
 'Cause there's so much random shit that's been patented

478
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,200
 that you see.

479
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,040
 That never went in here.

480
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,820
 - I always seem it's piece of piss, actually.

481
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,900
 - Yeah, I always thought you could just draw a picture

482
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,300
 on a beer mat and just send it in

483
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,640
 and then give you a patent.

484
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,060
 - I think it works like that.

485
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:28,620
 This idea of yours for a beer mat is incredible, so.

486
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,000
 Not as easy as it looks.

487
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,680
 - Is it quite a process?

488
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,180
 - Well, I think it costs.

489
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:36,380
 You got to pay in order to have it accepted

490
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,700
 to the submission and so on.

491
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,500
 Like, yeah, it's a lengthy process.

492
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,260
 And basically they dropped the badge largely

493
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:44,180
 because no one was really achieving it.

494
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:45,460
 So the invention badge,

495
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,420
 it's part of the American Boy Scout specifically.

496
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:50,320
 There were 57 original merit badges that you could get,

497
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,160
 like archery and swimming and so on.

498
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,880
 And invention was part of it.

499
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:58,400
 So that launched in 1911 and they took it out by 1914

500
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,520
 and only 10 scouts in that time managed to get it,

501
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,160
 which I think is a very high number.

502
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,080
 - Actually, only nine got it in that time.

503
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,880
 One person got it in 1915

504
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,800
 'cause he'd already started with his invention.

505
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,360
 So they were like, oh, well, I guess you can have it.

506
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,520
 - That's apparently one of the rules

507
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,360
 with a badge that's been stopped.

508
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,120
 If you've started the process

509
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,840
 trying to get it, you can finish it.

510
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,540
 - And the inventions have not survived.

511
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,900
 Most of them have not survived.

512
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,140
 We don't know what was patented,

513
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:24,300
 but we do know one by Graham Thomas Smallwood,

514
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:28,020
 which was a scout's uniform with a removable sleeve

515
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:30,580
 to stop your Boy Scout badge arm getting dirty.

516
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:31,580
 - I think it's a great idea.

517
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,420
 It's really good.

518
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,260
 - Is it?

519
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,100
 - Yeah, it's not just that.

520
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,220
 You could take the sleeve off

521
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,540
 and use it to sew badges onto it.

522
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,860
 You can carry on wearing the rest of your Boy Scout thing.

523
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:40,900
 - Just take the whole jacket off, mate.

524
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:43,340
 - Yeah, we must have another shirt.

525
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,460
 - I think you still had,

526
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:45,620
 from what I could see on the drawing,

527
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:47,700
 you still had an underneath sleeve.

528
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,740
 It was a sort of on top.

529
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:49,860
 So it's not, you didn't look like

530
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:50,840
 someone had just ripped your sleeve off.

531
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,400
 - Well, there was a few different things you could do.

532
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,240
 You could do that.

533
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,080
 And then you could also put a secondary sleeve

534
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,380
 on top of your other sleeve.

535
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,220
 - Okay.

536
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:59,240
 - So it's like a prophylactic sleeve.

537
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,700
 - Was that so it matched the other side?

538
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,000
 - No, it stops you getting dirty.

539
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,900
 Stop shirt, sleeve getting dirty.

540
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,160
 - And we've all got these things these days.

541
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,560
 - So like you're walking down the street

542
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,500
 and you lean on some wet paint

543
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,660
 and everyone laughs at you

544
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:10,720
 'cause you got paint on your arm.

545
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,560
 You go, "Haha!"

546
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,120
 And you pull off your fake sleeve.

547
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:13,960
 - Amazing.

548
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,800
 - Yeah, yeah.

549
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,640
 - Incredible.

550
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,480
 - Richly deserved patent and badge.

551
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,860
 - I can't believe he's not famous.

552
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,720
 - The horrific badges back in the day.

553
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,880
 Other discontinued Boy Scout badges

554
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,980
 on the Wikipedia for them is top drawer reading.

555
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,200
 There's beef production.

556
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,040
 - Yep, that's good.

557
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,280
 - Lost until 1975.

558
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,480
 You get a Boy Scout badge for beef production.

559
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:35,140
 Blacksmithing, nut culture, hog and pork production,

560
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,200
 taxidermy.

561
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,960
 - Interestingly, hog and pork production

562
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,200
 was discontinued in 1958.

563
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,200
 So I wonder what the difference

564
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,240
 of the discrepancy between pork and beef is.

565
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:47,280
 We must keep the beef scouts going.

566
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,120
 - Is it, well, there are a lot

567
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,380
 of nine-year-old farmers in those days.

568
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,220
 - No.

569
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,720
 - To get the pork production badge,

570
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,480
 you needed to confer with meat market men

571
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,800
 and from their instruction, draw a diagram of a hog

572
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:02,240
 and mark and name the parts for butcher classification.

573
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,080
 - It's so good.

574
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,880
 I think our children should be learning that kind of stuff.

575
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,960
 - I love those details.

576
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,920
 All the things that they had to do.

577
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,600
 Like a farmhouse and planning

578
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,240
 was one of the merit badges you could get.

579
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,080
 And as part of that,

580
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,160
 you had to present a drawing plan

581
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,840
 of sewage disposal for a country home.

582
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,000
 (laughing)

583
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:16,840
 - Amazing.

584
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:17,680
 I mean, these are the skills of the future.

585
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,520
 - I don't know.

586
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,340
 I don't like that element.

587
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:20,960
 It reminds me a lot of Duke of Edinburgh.

588
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,080
 I don't know if anyone did that

589
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,400
 where basically you thought it was just going

590
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,520
 on a fun walk when there's all this background stuff

591
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,520
 you also have to do.

592
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:29,520
 So all the badges still, there's the family life badge,

593
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,640
 which is quite nice.

594
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,080
 It basically means being a good little boy

595
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,920
 or girl to your parents,

596
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,560
 but you have to write this full proposal, don't you?

597
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,240
 At the start and make lists

598
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,440
 and then submit various essays on it.

599
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,720
 - It doesn't mean anything to be good to your parents

600
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,980
 if you're doing it just to get a badge, does it?

601
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,000
 - Yeah.

602
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,560
 - I think whatever, whatever works.

603
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,400
 - Whatever.

604
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,720
 (laughing)

605
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,560
 I agree.

606
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,880
 Stalking badge was another one, by the way.

607
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,720
 - Stalking.

608
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,560
 - That had to go.

609
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,400
 (laughing)

610
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,520
 They just renamed that as tracking

611
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,440
 just to make it more acceptable.

612
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,840
 - Do you know what the rarest badge

613
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,480
 that anyone got in 2024 was?

614
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,680
 Again, this is all American Boy Scouts.

615
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,520
 We should say.

616
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,200
 In fact, I think pretty much everything we've said

617
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,280
 is American Boy Scouts.

618
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,560
 So, okay, I would say in 2024,

619
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,840
 'cause there are some old-school badges

620
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,560
 like Hog and Pork production,

621
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,400
 but there are new ones.

622
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,240
 - That's not there anymore.

623
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,960
 - There are new ones like being woke or whatever.

624
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,480
 Is it one of the new or the old-school ones

625
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,320
 that was the least caught on?

626
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,160
 - Oh, it's old-school.

627
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,160
 - I reckon.

628
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,360
 - Is it motorboating?

629
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,200
 'Cause I think that--

630
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,040
 (laughing)

631
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,440
 - Popping your head between women's boobs.

632
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,280
 - Well, that's the thing.

633
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,960
 I think that's got connotations now.

634
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,040
 It is a badge, but I bet a lot of people

635
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,800
 are doing the wrong thing when they try to get it.

636
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,360
 - I see what you mean.

637
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,880
 Only one kid actually drove a motorboat.

638
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,240
 The others all just went, "Maw, maw, maw, maw."

639
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,680
 And they get it. (laughing)

640
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,600
 - My God.

641
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,640
 - It's not that. - Okay.

642
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,520
 - I'm trying to think if this actual thing

643
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,000
 could have any sexual connotations.

644
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,320
 - Is it like a schooner construction?

645
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:56,400
 - I mean, it's a very difficult thing to guess, really.

646
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,720
 It's something that you might associate with the army

647
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,760
 as opposed to the scouting movement.

648
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,600
 - Okay.

649
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,240
 - Something that one person in an army regiment would do.

650
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,520
 - Oh, only because I've read through the big list.

651
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,360
 Is it bugling?

652
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:11,480
 - It's bugling, yes. - Oh, wow.

653
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,640
 - I don't know if that is another sexual term.

654
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,120
 It feels like it probably should be.

655
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,640
 - Certainly could be, couldn't it?

656
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,240
 - But yeah, the least common are bugling, surveying,

657
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,840
 stamp collecting, drafting, composite materials,

658
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,680
 and then it goes on.

659
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,840
 - We've lost so many of our traditions.

660
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,760
 - And the top three.

661
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,880
 Oh, top one, top one badge in 2024.

662
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,160
 - I think pioneering, 'cause it's so classic.

663
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,080
 That's one with ropes and building.

664
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,940
 - Not where you put a pioneer ear.

665
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:36,920
 (all laughing)

666
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,920
 - Got to get off over dictionary.com.

667
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,160
 (all laughing)

668
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,800
 - I just hope to God, Anna,

669
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,440
 you never be a young boy scout

670
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,180
 who tells you they're doing a motor birdie.

671
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,020
 (all laughing)

672
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:47,860
 And you're gonna go on.

673
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:48,700
 Go on, mate.

674
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:49,540
 (all laughing)

675
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:51,220
 - Show me your skills.

676
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:53,040
 Don't mind my mate with the poisonous ears.

677
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,160
 (all laughing)

678
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,360
 He's just going for his.

679
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,640
 - So pioneering, that's your guess, right?

680
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,120
 - This is easy to get, I reckon.

681
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,240
 - Is it like helping a person?

682
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,080
 - Geocaching.

683
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,400
 - Helping a person, but in a very specific way.

684
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,320
 - Helping old women cross across the road.

685
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,840
 - There's no badge for that.

686
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,680
 - First aid.

687
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,520
 - Correct.

688
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,080
 And the biggest gain in popularity in 2024.

689
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:16,780
 This one went from the 121st most popular badge

690
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:19,400
 to the 81st most popular badge.

691
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,720
 And it's something that one of us

692
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,280
 round this table enjoys.

693
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,320
 - But it's a skill.

694
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,680
 - It's not, so it's weighing on

695
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,080
 about electric cars or something.

696
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:27,920
 (all laughing)

697
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,240
 - Thank you.

698
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,520
 Was it being a lush, James?

699
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,680
 (all laughing)

700
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,320
 - Being weird on ghost dating websites.

701
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,840
 - I wasn't being weird, I was being friendly.

702
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,680
 - It was.

703
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,500
 - It was a friendly ghost.

704
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,960
 - The wife guy badge.

705
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,560
 - No, no, it wasn't, it wasn't, it wasn't.

706
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,180
 - It was the golf badge.

707
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,520
 - Oh!

708
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,360
 - It was the biggest cake.

709
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,200
 - Clever.

710
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,480
 - It was a twist, it was him.

711
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,760
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, we were looking at the,

712
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,280
 that's very good, that's very good.

713
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,480
 There is this really big thing of like,

714
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,360
 oh, all the badges, they've gone all woke, blah, blah, blah.

715
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,360
 And it's a very, very tiresome talking point

716
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:03,400
 because there are things like, there's a money skills one,

717
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,320
 or you know, or there's Scouts Digital Citizen,

718
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,360
 or you know, or there's, actually loads of them

719
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,360
 are just absolutely straight down the line,

720
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:13,120
 like athletics, air researcher, angler, caver, climber,

721
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,320
 they're just absolute route one classic scout stuff.

722
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,760
 - Oh yeah, they're all the classics,

723
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,600
 except one of the really early classics,

724
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,360
 the Swastika badge, which I don't think was on my list.

725
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,680
 - No.

726
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,520
 - Baden-Pound loved the Swastika badge.

727
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,360
 - What?

728
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,360
 - He thought it should be like the defining badge

729
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,200
 of the Scouts, he said.

730
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,200
 - So what are you talking about?

731
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,080
 - In 1921, he wrote quite rightly

732
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,800
 that the Swastika is a symbol used in every part of the world,

733
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,880
 in the ancient world, in the modern day,

734
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:39,600
 but now it stands for the badge of fellowship among Scouts.

735
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,760
 And how you used it was, if you're a Boy Scout,

736
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,160
 you always carry around a collection of Swastika badges.

737
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,800
 And if someone did you a good turn,

738
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,760
 like gave you a leg up or a pie,

739
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,400
 then you gave them a badge and you said, always wear this.

740
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,520
 And that means if a Boy Scout ever saw you,

741
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,280
 they have to offer to do you a good turn.

742
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,920
 - So are we misunderstanding the Nazis?

743
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,560
 - They just did a lot of good turns for the Scouts over the years.

744
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,000
 - I think that was it, yeah.

745
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,960
 - It was actually just a big sponsored march into Poland.

746
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,200
 (laughing)

747
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,360
 'Cause Baden-Pound,

748
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,240
 'cause that was obviously when the Swastika

749
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,200
 had not been adopted by the Nazis.

750
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,600
 But he was a bit fascistic.

751
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,200
 So in 1937, he wanted to form close ties

752
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,000
 with German youth movements.

753
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,320
 He wrote in his diary in 1939 that "Mine Camp"

754
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,920
 was a wonderful book with good ideas

755
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,840
 on education, health, propaganda, organization, et cetera.

756
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,600
 - I would agree on the propaganda front.

757
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,080
 - Well, it did work, didn't it?

758
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:30,920
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

759
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,440
 I mean, obviously he could have known how it would turn out,

760
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,280
 but...

761
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,120
 - Yeah, wow.

762
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,440
 That meant that puts the shows the Swastika thing

763
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,520
 in a whole new light.

764
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,360
 - I don't want to say...

765
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,280
 By the way, I'm not saying he was an out and out fascist.

766
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,760
 He was just a complicated character,

767
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,240
 very old fashioned these days,

768
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,920
 but had amazing ideas about like getting young people

769
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,920
 organized and working together,

770
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,040
 helping each other, all of that,

771
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,480
 like raising good citizens for that.

772
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,640
 - And it impressed the world.

773
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,560
 So the reason the American Scouts started,

774
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,720
 there's an origin story,

775
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,880
 which is such like, it's like King Arthur.

776
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,640
 It's just like total bullshit,

777
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,120
 but it's a guy called W.D. Boyce.

778
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,920
 And W.D. Boyce is one of the five co-founders of the Scouts.

779
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,240
 - Scouting for Boyce.

780
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,560
 - Scouting for Boyce.

781
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,840
 So you got Baden Powell,

782
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,400
 who obviously is the British originator,

783
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,320
 but in America, you then had W.D. Boyce,

784
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,440
 you had Daniel Carter Beard, James E. West,

785
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,360
 and then you had Ernest Thompson Seton.

786
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,480
 The audio was that W.D. Boyce was in England.

787
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,720
 He's an American newspaper guy,

788
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,840
 and he was walking through a foggy street at night.

789
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,680
 Couldn't really see anything.

790
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:25,720
 Went out through the fog, came a Boy Scout,

791
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,480
 and said, "Let me help you across the road,

792
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,000
 "and let me get you to where you need to go."

793
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,240
 And he thought, "Wow, this young man with impeccable behavior.

794
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,080
 "What is this?

795
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,120
 "Oh, you're a Boy Scout.

796
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:33,960
 "I must do that."

797
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,720
 And he got taken to Baden Powell,

798
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,160
 and immediately said, "I'll set it up."

799
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,040
 Now, we know that it wasn't even foggy that day

800
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,480
 that he was there in the UK.

801
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,480
 - Well, who thought to do that research?

802
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,800
 - Well, people who try to work out.

803
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,040
 - People who meet urologists.

804
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,560
 - Because there's a lot of sort of questions

805
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,560
 about who actually is the original founder

806
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,760
 of the American Boy Scouts.

807
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,320
 - So often it's raining outside,

808
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,480
 and I look at my phone up, and it says it's not raining.

809
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,760
 And that's like literally happening right now.

810
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,000
 I don't trust this stuff.

811
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,040
 - Yeah, I mean, who knows?

812
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,440
 But that's the kind of the story

813
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,440
 that was created, the mythology behind it.

814
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,080
 The other guy was Ernest Thompson Seton.

815
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,000
 There's a great fact,

816
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,680
 I read in a Margaret Atwood book about him,

817
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,160
 which is when he turned 21,

818
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,800
 his father handed him a bill charging him

819
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,880
 for all the expenses associated with his childhood,

820
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:19,000
 including the fee for his delivery at birth.

821
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 Just hand it to him.

822
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,440
 - Right, he's one of the founders of the American Boy Scouts.

823
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,920
 - I will not do that for my daughter,

824
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,400
 just to say, 'cause she was on the NHS.

825
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,000
 (all laughing)

826
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,320
 - They and Paul, yeah, he married a woman called Olaf Sones.

827
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,520
 He was 55, and she was 23 when they got married.

828
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,240
 And the wedding present for those two,

829
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,440
 the Scouts were each encouraged to contribute one penny,

830
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,440
 and a hundred thousand of them did it,

831
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,360
 and they bought him a car, which is quite cool.

832
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,880
 And then in 1929,

833
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,280
 to celebrate the 21st birthday of the Scouts,

834
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,840
 they all did the same again.

835
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,680
 But at this stage,

836
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:58,480
 there were four million Scouts and guides around the world.

837
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,280
 And so they bought him a Rolls-Royce.

838
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,280
 - Oh, that's great. - That's great.

839
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,760
 - Isn't that cool? - Long Con, you know?

840
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,000
 (all laughing)

841
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,840
 - They started emitting girls in 2019,

842
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,440
 the Boy Scouts of America.

843
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,800
 And who did this piss off?

844
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,840
 - Oh, the Daily Mail readers.

845
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,600
 - Was it someone in the Baden-Powell family?

846
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,440
 'Cause he, I mean, he--

847
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,280
 - Very much so.

848
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,240
 - His sister ran the Girl Guides, though,

849
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,280
 when they started.

850
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,600
 - Well, that's, it was the Girl Scouts.

851
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,160
 - Right, right, sorry, Girl Scouts, yeah, yeah.

852
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:31,280
 - So yeah, they are furious about this,

853
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:34,080
 because they now call themselves the BSA

854
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,760
 to try and take the boy out of their, like, name.

855
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,120
 And the girls basically said,

856
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,080
 the whole reason they've done this

857
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,840
 is to help with their massively plummeting membership.

858
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:47,040
 They're trying to steal Girl Scouts from our movement,

859
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:50,040
 from us, and they're suing them, the name change.

860
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:54,040
 - People who want their children to join the Girl Scouts,

861
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,800
 they might just Google Girl Scouts

862
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,040
 and get the girl members of the Boy Scouts.

863
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:00,320
 - Yeah, absolutely, so there's beef.

864
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,200
 - If it's called the, there's beef.

865
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,040
 - There's a lot.

866
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,440
 - Not since 1968, there is a--

867
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,480
 (all laughing)

868
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,400
 - It's gone off now.

869
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,400
 - Lovely.

870
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,880
 - So hopefully they'll fight, and then who do you back?

871
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,680
 - But they're called the BSA now.

872
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,520
 - I believe so, yeah.

873
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,360
 - Boy Scouts of America, yeah.

874
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,960
 - What was the B-Stand for, if not for boy?

875
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,680
 - Well, you don't know the--

876
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,800
 - Well, you're hiding it, aren't you?

877
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,640
 That's the whole point.

878
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,080
 Why did the girls start letting boys in?

879
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,080
 - Yes.

880
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:24,680
 - Yeah, I can see how that's the logical daily mail

881
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,040
 commenters' response.

882
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,640
 (all laughing)

883
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,240
 - Sorry, I thought that was the work response.

884
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,040
 You're trying to get your work badge.

885
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,840
 - Let me knock down the Girl Scouts,

886
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,760
 'cause it's about time someone's done a peg or two.

887
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:39,880
 They, according to a blog called Waity Matters,

888
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:43,280
 are saddling America with a huge amount of obesity.

889
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,060
 Thanks to the Girl Scout cookies

890
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,600
 that they sell every year.

891
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:50,240
 So according to this person on the blog,

892
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,400
 they worked out that the Girl Scout cookies

893
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,320
 that are sold every year accounts

894
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:58,040
 with three quarters of a million pounds of trans fat.

895
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,760
 That's 3.5 billion teaspoons of sugar

896
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,880
 that they add to the American food supply.

897
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,160
 - Well, that does sound bad,

898
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,440
 but we need overall figures, I think,

899
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,360
 because that's a bit,

900
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,720
 if it can't just be the Girl Scout cookies.

901
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,520
 - Oh, no, there's other stuff going on.

902
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,640
 (all laughing)

903
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,000
 - But it doesn't help.

904
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,840
 - It doesn't help.

905
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:15,680
 - It doesn't help.

906
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,840
 - They're trying to fatten up the boys,

907
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,000
 make them easier to defeat.

908
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,580
 (upbeat music)

909
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:25,280
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

910
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,540
 and that is Andy.

911
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:29,000
 - My fact is that one of London's oldest windows

912
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,600
 is made of cow horn.

913
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:35,160
 - The window itself.

914
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,960
 - The glass, as it were.

915
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,960
 The glass substitute is cow.

916
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:38,800
 - Can you see through it?

917
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,480
 'Cause if not, I say that isn't a window.

918
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,080
 - Well, judge for yourself, James,

919
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,600
 'cause I've got a photo here of me this morning

920
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,640
 at the cow horn window.

921
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,520
 - I can see you, but you are in front of it.

922
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,640
 - Yeah, but you can see through it.

923
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,840
 It's very see-through-able.

924
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:53,800
 So, horn, it turns out, is a fantastic window material,

925
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,640
 beaten maybe only by glass.

926
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,400
 (all laughing)

927
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,240
 This is in London.

928
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,800
 It's a place called Guildhall.

929
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,640
 So, there's a separate thing called the City of London,

930
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,920
 which is different to London, right?

931
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:05,400
 The City of London is the sort of ancient body.

932
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,240
 It's--

933
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,960
 - It means part of London, really.

934
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,400
 - It's right in the middle of London, definitely.

935
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,240
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're still in London.

936
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,320
 But, the actual Guildhall itself,

937
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,320
 the town hall of the City of London,

938
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,680
 dates back to the 14th century.

939
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:21,040
 Like, it's the oldest non-religious building in London.

940
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,760
 You know, there are a couple of abbeys and cathedrals

941
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,920
 and things that are older, but it's really old.

942
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:28,240
 And this window dates back to the 15th century.

943
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,920
 So, it has survived any manner of stuff.

944
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:33,000
 All the other windows in the place have been replaced.

945
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,080
 Like, there's been the Blitz,

946
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,280
 there's been the Great Fire of London.

947
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,280
 This window is still there all these years later.

948
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,240
 It's kind of amazing.

949
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,800
 - Come on, kids, go and play football outside.

950
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,520
 (all laughing)

951
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,360
 - I dare you.

952
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:45,400
 - And it's made of cow horn.

953
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:48,680
 So, you pop the horn off the cow, you slice it up,

954
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,440
 you heat that, and then you can mold it

955
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:53,600
 into this amazing, really pretty transparent window material.

956
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,440
 It's stunning.

957
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,260
 - So cool.

958
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,200
 - And is it incredibly strong?

959
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,640
 Is that how it's survived this lot?

960
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,480
 - Oh, no.

961
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,240
 - Okay, so that makes it all the more amazing

962
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,200
 that we've still got it, right?

963
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,320
 - It's not only not--

964
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,400
 I mean, it's decent.

965
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:06,200
 You know, glass from the time is not incredibly strong either.

966
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,160
 And until the 18th century,

967
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,880
 cow horn was used largely for translucent sheets

968
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,240
 to go into, like, lanterns.

969
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,560
 The word "lantan" comes from lanthorn, you know,

970
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,400
 'cause it would have horn--

971
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,240
 - That's it.

972
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,720
 - The sides of it were horn.

973
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,840
 - I don't think it does.

974
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:19,680
 I think, 'cause I was like,

975
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:22,000
 "That's why they always spell it weird in old books."

976
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,120
 'Cause obviously, you know, you read old, like,

977
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,480
 Shakespeare will say it, "lanthorn."

978
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,480
 In the old 19th century novels,

979
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,680
 sometimes you see lanthorn.

980
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,920
 So I was like, "That explains it."

981
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,080
 But actually, lantern just comes from Latin,

982
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,480
 like, meaning light.

983
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,600
 But people then did the old got confused.

984
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,040
 Lots of their lanterns were made out of horn.

985
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,320
 So they went, "Should we shove a horn on the end?"

986
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,640
 And I read a quite annoyed encyclopedia entry

987
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,760
 from about 1803, saying lanthorn

988
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,080
 is a completely incorrect spelling of this

989
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,720
 based on the misconception.

990
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,760
 So that's just the idiots from the 18th century.

991
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,600
 - But it is based on the fact

992
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,720
 that lanterns were made of horn.

993
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,560
 - Absolutely, yeah.

994
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,400
 - Which they were.

995
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,240
 - Yeah, right, yeah, yeah.

996
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,080
 - That's really interesting.

997
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:57,920
 - It's so cool.

998
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,040
 I mean, basically, in the 15th century,

999
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,600
 they had the equivalent of laminated menus.

1000
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,720
 There were the horn books that students would use

1001
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,440
 where they would have all the alphabet on it.

1002
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,800
 You've got, like, wooden frames

1003
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,200
 where you've got horn that's written on

1004
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,320
 with the alphabet to learn from and things like that.

1005
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,800
 But you've also got ancient books

1006
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:14,120
 which have a square of horn on the front

1007
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,760
 to protect what's beneath,

1008
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,800
 like a very valuable old bit of parchment

1009
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,120
 or vellum or whatever.

1010
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,440
 So the horn window covers that.

1011
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,480
 But it's quite delicious for insects.

1012
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,560
 So a lot of the very old ones

1013
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,240
 are just nibbled away at all around the edges.

1014
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,520
 - The alphabet books that Dan was talking about

1015
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,600
 are called horn books.

1016
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:34,000
 And the horn book is also the title of a book from 1889,

1017
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,520
 which is thought of as the principal work

1018
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,840
 on sex technique in the English language.

1019
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:39,680
 - Oh, good Lord.

1020
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,800
 - It's basically 1889.

1021
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,640
 - I didn't think.

1022
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,480
 - Yeah?

1023
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,320
 - I didn't think they had that then.

1024
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,840
 - Well, that's why it's interesting.

1025
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,160
 Where do you think your great-great-great-great-great-great-grandmother

1026
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,000
 came from?

1027
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:49,840
 (laughing)

1028
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,440
 So it's like the Kamasutra, basically,

1029
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,120
 but for Victorian England.

1030
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:53,960
 - Wow.

1031
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:54,960
 - And they had sex techniques.

1032
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,080
 Number one, The Ordinary.

1033
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,360
 (laughing)

1034
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,200
 - End of book.

1035
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,680
 (laughing)

1036
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,520
 - What was that then?

1037
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,960
 Was that actually in 1888?

1038
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:07,560
 That was upside down and back to front.

1039
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,440
 - Here's some more.

1040
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,120
 Number five, The St. George.

1041
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:12,440
 (laughing)

1042
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,080
 - What, 'cause you're sort of prodding a dragon.

1043
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,680
 (laughing)

1044
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:18,240
 - Number nine, The View of the Low Countries.

1045
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,240
 - Oh, that is good.

1046
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,680
 - Number 48, Waste Not Want Not.

1047
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,760
 - Oh, dear.

1048
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:27,680
 - And number 63, The Sack of Corn, Backwards.

1049
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,520
 - Wow.

1050
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,360
 (laughing)

1051
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,640
 - None of these say much about the people involved,

1052
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,480
 do they?

1053
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,320
 - No.

1054
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,160
 - There's much more.

1055
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,440
 - Wait, what was the connection to horn, sorry?

1056
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,280
 - It's called the horn book.

1057
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,600
 - Oh, that's it, sorry.

1058
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,480
 - It's like, if you Google, I'm just warning people,

1059
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:42,120
 if they Google horn books to get these alphabet books,

1060
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,440
 they might accidentally get this one.

1061
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,400
 - Do be careful if you're on horn.com.

1062
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,160
 (laughing)

1063
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,960
 - There's a cleaner horn book fact, which I quite liked,

1064
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,480
 which was a poem was written in 1622,

1065
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,200
 which said, 'cause they were the thing you went to

1066
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,760
 for your learning your first letters, and it read,

1067
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,440
 "Even so, the horn book is the seed and grain

1068
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:05,360
 of skill by which we learning first obtain,

1069
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:08,160
 and it was written by William Hornby."

1070
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,760
 - Oh, that's really good.

1071
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,280
 Can I give you another one like that?

1072
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,120
 - Please.

1073
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:15,240
 - The largest brothel in Europe is situated on Horn Street.

1074
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:16,080
 - Okay.

1075
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:16,920
 - Is it?

1076
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:17,760
 - Yeah.

1077
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,580
 - I was trying to raise the tone.

1078
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:20,720
 - Well, it's gone straight back down again.

1079
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:25,080
 It's in Cologne, and it has 120 sex workers working there,

1080
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,680
 and it was Europe's first high-rise brothel.

1081
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,320
 - But how many of the customers are going looking

1082
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,440
 for alphabet books for their kids?

1083
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,280
 - Most of them, yeah.

1084
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,600
 - I think the architectural thing

1085
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,760
 is not the interesting thing there,

1086
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:38,200
 as I've stayed in the largest hotel in Thessaloniki,

1087
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,520
 and it's not a guarantee of quality.

1088
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:44,000
 It turns out, when you just say Europe's largest brothel,

1089
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 it doesn't mean best.

1090
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,840
 - That's true.

1091
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:47,680
 - Oh, my God.

1092
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:50,360
 - They basically had a red light district in the town center

1093
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,960
 and decided to do away with it

1094
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:54,440
 and get this huge multi-storey building and stuff.

1095
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,280
 - Right.

1096
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,440
 - And it advertises money-back guarantee

1097
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,440
 in the case of unsatisfactory service.

1098
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,280
 - No.

1099
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,640
 - Yeah.

1100
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,400
 - It's so awkward to complain, isn't it?

1101
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,320
 - The sack of corn wasn't backwards at all.

1102
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,900
 (all laughing)

1103
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:12,280
 Have you guys heard of the worshipful company of Horner's?

1104
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,520
 - Yes, I know someone who's connected.

1105
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,360
 - Get out.

1106
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,640
 - Well, 'cause London has all these guilds,

1107
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,080
 which are the worshipful company of,

1108
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:20,760
 and then you insert very old-fashioned trade.

1109
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:24,440
 - So this is the thing, it dates back to 1284,

1110
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:28,120
 and it was a guild for people who worked with horn people,

1111
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,880
 and it was a huge business at the time, obviously,

1112
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,480
 'cause all the people needed lanterns and windows

1113
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:34,760
 and horn books and other uses of horn, there are thousands.

1114
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:37,920
 Now, they declined, obviously, when pesky glass,

1115
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:41,840
 stupid glass, took over the window industry,

1116
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:44,160
 and they were in the doldrums for centuries,

1117
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,660
 but they came back,

1118
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:49,440
 and he guesses what they sort of re-imagined themselves as.

1119
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,800
 - Oh, buglers.

1120
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,960
 - It's not buglers, though.

1121
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,680
 They just can't get enough buglers through the door.

1122
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,440
 - I'm just thinking, like, if they're still called the Horner's.

1123
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,280
 - They're still called the Horner's,

1124
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,040
 but they took on another industry

1125
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,960
 related to what they did in the first place.

1126
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,320
 - I read this early today,

1127
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,080
 and I just couldn't believe I never made the connection,

1128
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,840
 but shoehorns are made of horn.

1129
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,560
 - It wasn't, yes, that's true.

1130
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,640
 That's not the gigantic industry they put on.

1131
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,520
 - Come on, globally, everyone's got a shoehorn.

1132
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,360
 - Absolutely.

1133
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,240
 - Is it microchips?

1134
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:22,560
 - No, it's plastics.

1135
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,400
 - Oh, right.

1136
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,720
 - Horn was the original plastic.

1137
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,120
 You heat it, you can mold it.

1138
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,200
 So these days, all the members

1139
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,640
 of the worshipful company of Horner's

1140
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,800
 are from the city, from the plastics industry.

1141
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:35,320
 They sponsor the Polymer Apprentice of the Year Award.

1142
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,640
 Big deal in plastics.

1143
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,480
 - It's huge, it's a scout badge.

1144
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,960
 - Yeah, that's amazing.

1145
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:40,800
 - Yeah, that's really cool.

1146
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,240
 - Do you know that actually being a Horner

1147
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,600
 is pretty tricky today?

1148
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,440
 - Is it?

1149
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,480
 - If you're a true Horner,

1150
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,600
 not one of these plastic people,

1151
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:51,800
 but you're a person who wants to make things out of horn,

1152
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,360
 it is difficult because of breeding

1153
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,280
 and modern farming and feeding

1154
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:59,240
 has changed what horns are like.

1155
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,640
 So the material is not as good for molding

1156
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:02,800
 as it used to be.

1157
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,680
 And it'll quite often retain what they call its memory.

1158
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,160
 So you kind of flatten it

1159
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,840
 and then you put it into whatever shape you want it to be,

1160
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,240
 but it kind of remembers that it was horn shaped before

1161
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,640
 and you can't get it flat properly.

1162
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:16,360
 - You come down to your new car window

1163
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,840
 and it's just back in the shape of a cow horn.

1164
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:21,080
 - It's a cow there instead, you ride it to work.

1165
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,880
 - So did you read about the Abbey horn, horn works?

1166
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,720
 - Go for it.

1167
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,120
 - We've said the word horn so much, I just love it.

1168
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,800
 Anyway, sorry, it's on the edge of the lake district.

1169
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,800
 It's the only horn works left in the UK.

1170
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,560
 'Cause it's an endangered craft these days

1171
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,960
 'cause there are only about 10 to 20 horn workers left.

1172
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,320
 And I think most of them work at Abbey horn.

1173
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,640
 It's been there for nearly 300 years

1174
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,280
 and you can get some bloody good stuff there.

1175
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,400
 I was going through the website

1176
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,800
 and just, you get a horn moustache brush,

1177
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,480
 some bloody good shoe horns, Dan, you'd love it.

1178
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,560
 - Okay, send me that link.

1179
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,320
 - Some absolute foot long monsters.

1180
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,680
 And actually, James, as you were saying,

1181
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:52,920
 'cause horn has changed,

1182
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,280
 they get some of those from like,

1183
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,360
 I think it's African cattle called the ankle

1184
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,240
 'cause they have massive great horns.

1185
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,200
 And you might wanna buy it at the novelty drinking horn

1186
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,440
 if your partner is into being a Viking or whatever.

1187
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,280
 - How is it?

1188
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,720
 Are you allowed to buy and sell this kind of horn

1189
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,320
 compared to obviously ivory you're not allowed to

1190
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,520
 and lots of other rhino horns you can't.

1191
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,840
 - It's fine, it is fine.

1192
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:15,160
 Because all of these cattle that they're buying the horns of

1193
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,360
 were bred for farming

1194
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:20,160
 and they certainly weren't killed for their horns.

1195
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:23,120
 - On drinking horns, obviously a huge use of horn.

1196
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,560
 And Vikings really did massively popularize them.

1197
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:28,560
 It was kind of the Vikings that brought them to the UK,

1198
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,160
 although they'd been used before.

1199
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,760
 But did you know that they also bought

1200
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:37,080
 such a drinking culture that got so bad by the 10th century

1201
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:40,000
 that King Edgar, who you all know,

1202
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,800
 it was the late 10th century English king,

1203
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,160
 said that every village had to be limited to one ale house

1204
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:49,560
 and every single drinking horn that any punter drank out of

1205
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:52,040
 had to have pins inserted at certain levels,

1206
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,480
 it's a bit like you have measures on cups a day.

1207
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,280
 And whoever drank beyond those intervals in one week

1208
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,560
 had to be severely punished.

1209
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,600
 - Whoa. - Right.

1210
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,400
 - Which is a tough to monitor as a bar person.

1211
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,840
 - Policing that, yeah.

1212
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,880
 (laughing)

1213
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,960
 But is it because it's a little bit of a drinking culture,

1214
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,320
 I think, because you can't put it down.

1215
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,280
 - Yeah, that's the idea.

1216
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:11,280
 - It's like a cocktail party where there's no table.

1217
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,120
 It's a nightmare.

1218
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:14,200
 You fill up your horn and you just stuck around holding it.

1219
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:17,760
 - Yeah, I must say the Vikings coming to Northern England

1220
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:21,320
 in the 10th century is just like you going to a cocktail party.

1221
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,160
 - There's no to put it down.

1222
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,800
 And often you lose track of your own horn.

1223
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,640
 And what's good is to put a little hairband

1224
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:26,680
 around your own horn.

1225
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:27,520
 (laughing)

1226
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,440
 - Well, you're the only one who comes with a horn holder

1227
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,120
 to make sure you can put it down between sits, so.

1228
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:35,880
 - Can you think of another use of the word horning

1229
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,440
 to be horned?

1230
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,480
 - Oh, I'm thinking of horning in on a situation.

1231
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,640
 - Oh, like horning in.

1232
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,600
 - No, it's sort of where you interrupt.

1233
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:46,520
 Oh, here Anna comes horning in on our conversation.

1234
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:48,000
 - Oh yeah. - Whatever.

1235
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:48,840
 - No, not that.

1236
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:51,240
 This is in a kind of sport.

1237
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,600
 - A very old-fashioned European sport.

1238
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:57,680
 - Marrying the Habsburg Queen.

1239
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:01,280
 - That's a sport, very good.

1240
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,040
 No, it's in bullfighting.

1241
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,720
 It's when you get gored by a bull.

1242
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:08,000
 It's called, it's known as a horning.

1243
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,360
 - It's been a horning in the morning.

1244
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,160
 - Yes.

1245
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:13,120
 - Morning horning would be a good royal rumble thing

1246
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:13,960
 for bullfighting.

1247
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,200
 Just in case the bullfighting people are listening,

1248
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,760
 wanting to rev it up a bit.

1249
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:19,160
 - The record for most hornings

1250
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,600
 is by a guy called Antonio Barrera,

1251
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,840
 who has been horned 23 times.

1252
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,840
 - Is that a good record?

1253
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,800
 Do you want that guy on your team?

1254
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,840
 - The guy from Guinness is saying,

1255
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,720
 "I'm so sorry, I missed the 16th morning,

1256
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,440
 "so we're not gonna gather a record."

1257
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,880
 - Wait, how many of those were the same occasion?

1258
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:34,880
 - They were all different occasions.

1259
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,040
 - Oh, blimey.

1260
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:39,280
 - The most common place to be horned by bull.

1261
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,240
 - Spain, I imagine.

1262
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:45,840
 - Are you a buddy?

1263
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:46,680
 - That'll be in Boston.

1264
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:47,520
 - In the ring. - Is he running away?

1265
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,200
 - In the ring, now in the upper leg.

1266
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:53,320
 And second place is the perineal area.

1267
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,880
 - Second most popular, that's a show.

1268
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:55,960
 Do they have guards?

1269
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:56,920
 Do they wear boxes?

1270
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:57,760
 - No, they don't.

1271
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,600
 - Bullfighters.

1272
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:01,320
 - No, no, they were very tight trousers, don't they?

1273
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,520
 - If only there was some system

1274
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:05,440
 where there could be some kind of clown in the ring,

1275
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,920
 who was able to distract the attention of the bull.

1276
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,480
 - Well, some rodeo clown idiot.

1277
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,480
 - I guess you'd call them that, yeah.

1278
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:14,920
 Have you heard of the German island of Borkum?

1279
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:15,760
 - No.

1280
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,480
 - This is a place that has a Christmas festival

1281
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,000
 called Klassholm, right?

1282
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,320
 Or Klassholm.

1283
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:23,320
 And they had this tradition for many, many years there

1284
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,280
 where men dress up in elaborate costumes

1285
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:28,320
 and spank women with cow horns on the bottom.

1286
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,720
 And this led to controversy recently

1287
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,200
 because a lot of the women said,

1288
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,840
 actually, we really don't like this.

1289
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,400
 - Stop using the pointy end.

1290
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,440
 - Well, I mean, we don't like being spanked,

1291
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,960
 or, you know, we're being spanked without permission

1292
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:39,800
 on Christmas.

1293
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,360
 But last year there was a huge crackdown

1294
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,600
 on cow horns spanking on Borkum.

1295
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,760
 And it passed without any spanking

1296
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,880
 and without any complaints.

1297
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,000
 Certainly without any complaints.

1298
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,320
 There may have been private consensual cow horns spanking.

1299
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,480
 - I think that's fine.

1300
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,320
 - Absolutely.

1301
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,000
 And in fact, when there was this big protest,

1302
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:54,920
 like loads of the women saying,

1303
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,760
 can you stop hitting us with cow horns on the bum

1304
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:57,600
 every Christmas?

1305
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,520
 This is not fun.

1306
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,560
 A couple of hundred women did launch a counter protest

1307
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,640
 saying, we love it.

1308
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:03,260
 It's our way of life.

1309
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:04,520
 This is our tradition.

1310
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:07,720
 So there's definitely debate.

1311
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:08,560
 But for the moment,

1312
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:12,520
 it appears that the involuntary cow horns spanking is over.

1313
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,560
 Why don't the women just spank the men back?

1314
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,720
 Or, I'm sorry, is that the Daily Mail comments

1315
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:17,560
 coming out again?

1316
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,400
 (laughing)

1317
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,680
 - I think that takes the fun out of it.

1318
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:21,840
 It's like giving someone a wedgie.

1319
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,320
 It's not as fun giving someone a wedgie, is it?

1320
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,760
 If you have to say beforehand,

1321
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:25,960
 is it okay if I give you a wedgie?

1322
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:26,800
 - Are we saying, Anna,

1323
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,720
 that consent takes the fun out of things?

1324
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:32,520
 'Cause I do think we're on thin ice.

1325
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:33,760
 (laughing)

1326
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,340
 (upbeat music)

1327
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:40,720
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show.

1328
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,120
 And that is Anna.

1329
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:44,240
 My fact this week is that Jack Kerouac

1330
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:48,720
 wrote his most famous novel on one long scroll.

1331
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,720
 - Was it sold in scroll form ever?

1332
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:51,560
 - Yeah.

1333
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,680
 - The audio box started, oh, yay, oh, yay.

1334
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,920
 (laughing)

1335
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,720
 - That's an interesting question.

1336
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:00,800
 It sort of is today, but not at the time.

1337
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,440
 - It has, as in that scroll has been sold.

1338
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,160
 - I think, yeah, that scroll, you're right.

1339
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,080
 You can go and visit it.

1340
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:08,000
 I can't remember what, it's in a museum somewhere.

1341
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,040
 - It's owned by, or it was owned.

1342
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,120
 Unfortunately, he died this year.

1343
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:13,640
 Jim Erse, who owns the Indianapolis Colts

1344
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:14,600
 American football team.

1345
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:15,440
 - Okay.

1346
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,280
 - Yeah.

1347
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:18,560
 - Obviously, that's where it, who it would be owned by.

1348
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:19,400
 (laughing)

1349
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,080
 - Yeah, no, he's a big, maybe we'll talk about it later.

1350
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:22,880
 Let's get into the fact that he was a huge collector

1351
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:23,840
 of this guy.

1352
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:24,680
 - Oh, cool.

1353
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:27,160
 - Yeah, I've got a big old list of other cool things he has.

1354
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:29,880
 - All right, well, excited to skip ahead to that.

1355
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:32,800
 But first of all, Jack Kerouac.

1356
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,280
 Yeah, he wrote on a long scroll

1357
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:35,600
 and basically he got annoyed

1358
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,640
 'cause he was a writer who typed very fast

1359
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:39,720
 and it all came flowing through him

1360
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:41,280
 and out of his fingertips.

1361
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,360
 And he thought you should never have to pause or stop

1362
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:44,840
 or have your flow interrupted.

1363
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:47,440
 - Or think, or think at all about the next sentence.

1364
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:50,240
 Maybe I'll put a main verb in this one, that kind of stuff.

1365
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,800
 Why would you think about the next sentence

1366
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,640
 considering it's about five pages away?

1367
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:55,080
 (laughing)

1368
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:57,200
 Which we should say if you read any Jack Kerouac,

1369
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,880
 it is very stream of consciousness.

1370
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:00,720
 - Yes.

1371
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:01,560
 - It's interesting.

1372
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:02,400
 Maybe we'll also get into a big debate

1373
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,760
 of who likes his style and who doesn't.

1374
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:07,640
 I think I know around this table who's gonna be the fan.

1375
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:10,880
 But he didn't like to reload his typewriter

1376
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:11,880
 with bits of paper.

1377
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:13,200
 So he got this massive scroll.

1378
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,840
 It was made of like teletype paper,

1379
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:17,080
 kind of like tracing paper, thick tracing paper.

1380
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:18,920
 And he taped it all together.

1381
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:21,920
 And then he made a 120 foot long scroll.

1382
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:24,760
 This was in 1951 and he was writing on the road.

1383
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:27,840
 - That was the name of the book.

1384
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:28,680
 - Sorry.

1385
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:29,520
 - Sorry, yeah.

1386
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:32,600
 He was writing in his bedroom, but on the road.

1387
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:35,560
 And when he was finished, he marched into his editor's office

1388
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:37,320
 who was a guy called Robert Giroux.

1389
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:40,360
 And he was unspun the scroll across the floor

1390
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:42,000
 like you would unroll a rug.

1391
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,760
 And Giroux just said,

1392
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:46,120
 Jack, don't you realize that's not how authors

1393
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:47,160
 present manuscripts?

1394
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:48,480
 I can't do anything with this.

1395
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:49,320
 Take it away.

1396
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,160
 - I think he did know

1397
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,800
 that that's not how you present manuscripts.

1398
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:54,880
 Also, it is often presented as if he did the stream

1399
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:56,240
 of consciousness he handed it over.

1400
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:57,080
 And that's it.

1401
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:57,900
 That's not the case.

1402
00:44:57,900 --> 00:44:59,880
 He spent years and years editing it.

1403
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:01,760
 It's a very highly edited document.

1404
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:04,040
 - Not that it seems like it, but yeah.

1405
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:05,400
 - Should we say who Jack Kerouac is?

1406
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:08,520
 Briefly, like American part of the beat generation,

1407
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:11,520
 post-war counter-cultural writers

1408
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:14,880
 who were rebelling against the way America was.

1409
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,520
 You know, that was the basic movement.

1410
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:19,120
 And Jack Kerouac was a huge part of it with On the Road,

1411
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:21,280
 which is extremely famous, you know?

1412
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:22,120
 - Yeah.

1413
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:24,400
 And what's interesting is he influenced a lot

1414
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,120
 of these people like Ken Kessie,

1415
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:28,520
 who wrote One Flew the Cuckoo's Nest,

1416
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:30,680
 Alan Ginsberg, the poet.

1417
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:31,560
 - William Burroughs.

1418
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:33,280
 - Yeah, if he gave the name to William Burroughs'

1419
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:35,160
 probably most famous novel, Naked Lunch.

1420
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:37,360
 That was something that he came up with.

1421
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:38,760
 But when he wrote On the Road,

1422
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:41,040
 he did spend all those years trying to get it published

1423
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,040
 and editing it.

1424
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:44,000
 And in the meantime, everyone who was influenced

1425
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,760
 by reading copies of it got their own stuff published.

1426
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:49,360
 So it ended up looking like Kerouac was copying off them,

1427
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:52,040
 when in fact he was the influence for this whole generation.

1428
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,440
 - Yes, 'cause it only ended up being published in 1957,

1429
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:55,280
 we should say.

1430
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,280
 So he proposed it in 1951.

1431
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,720
 The editor said, "Take it away and tie it into a proper book."

1432
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:02,440
 And so he then did type it out on normal pages.

1433
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:03,600
 But no one would take it.

1434
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:04,680
 All the publishers said,

1435
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:06,400
 "We think this is kind of a work of genius,

1436
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,920
 "but no one's gonna care about the subject matter."

1437
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:10,520
 - And the subject matter is?

1438
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:12,640
 - It's basically a big old road trip.

1439
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,360
 It's none of his books and novels,

1440
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:15,840
 and I hate it when people refer to them as that,

1441
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:18,760
 'cause they're all completely true to his own life.

1442
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:20,160
 They're his autobiography, basically.

1443
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,000
 And this was a bit of work.

1444
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,920
 - They're exaggerated autobiographies, aren't they?

1445
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:25,880
 - Yeah, so it's him traveling around with his mates.

1446
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:27,640
 And they all put each other in each other's books,

1447
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:30,480
 don't they, Ginsberg does and Burroughs does.

1448
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:32,760
 He also, incidentally, named Ginsberg's most famous book,

1449
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:33,600
 Howl.

1450
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,440
 So he named the three most famous books

1451
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:36,600
 of the B-generation.

1452
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:38,280
 - His real skill was naming books.

1453
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:40,080
 (all laughing)

1454
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:41,720
 - All these books that he did,

1455
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:45,360
 which were semi-autobiographical and with all his mates in,

1456
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:48,600
 the liars of his publishers made him change all the names

1457
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:49,920
 for obvious reasons.

1458
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,800
 There was lots of stuff happening in those books

1459
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:54,080
 that they might object to.

1460
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:57,440
 But Kerouac's intention was towards the end of his life,

1461
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,240
 he was gonna get all of his old books,

1462
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:00,680
 and he was gonna republish them all

1463
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:04,000
 as one enormous scroll from start to finish,

1464
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,520
 but then change all the names back

1465
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,360
 so that we got all the people's names out.

1466
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:08,200
 - Oh, that's good.

1467
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,360
 - But then he died quite young, I think.

1468
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:11,720
 - He died really, yeah, he died in the late 60s.

1469
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:13,520
 - Sorry, can I just say that has been done now,

1470
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,760
 just to make sense of what I said earlier,

1471
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,720
 I think Viking Press in about 2011

1472
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:19,560
 released the original scroll,

1473
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:21,280
 which is with all the original names,

1474
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:23,120
 and it's with no paragraph breaks and written--

1475
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:25,480
 - I've got it at home, it's a beast of a book.

1476
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:28,200
 I haven't read it, I mean, just no way, but it's--

1477
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:30,200
 - And there you go, that's the fan reveal.

1478
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:31,960
 - But I'm a fan of the counterculture,

1479
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:33,600
 I've not actually read Kerouac,

1480
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,360
 because it's a difficult read.

1481
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:37,720
 - Yeah, a stream of consciousness is harder.

1482
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:39,520
 Can I give you one more version of that meeting

1483
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:42,840
 with Robert Giroux, who was one of his previous editors,

1484
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:45,240
 and then he'd written short stories and things like that.

1485
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:47,040
 He turns up at the office with the manuscript,

1486
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:50,240
 with the scroll, throws it on the floor,

1487
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,760
 and this is according to Robert Giroux.

1488
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:55,560
 He was very excited, this is Kerouac, I think he was high.

1489
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:57,280
 Anyway, I bent down to look at the thing,

1490
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:59,040
 and after a few moments, I looked up and said,

1491
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:01,240
 "Well, Jack, this is going to have to be cut up

1492
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:03,360
 "into pages and edited and so on."

1493
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:05,600
 Jack just looked at me and his face had darkened,

1494
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:07,760
 and he said, "There'll be no editing.

1495
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:10,920
 "This book was dictated by the Holy Ghost."

1496
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:13,800
 And the book then went to a different publisher.

1497
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,080
 (laughing)

1498
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:16,720
 - You met him on a dating site, didn't you?

1499
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,720
 (laughing)

1500
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:21,000
 - Yeah, I think he was off his face quite a lot.

1501
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:21,840
 - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1502
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:24,000
 - He was on Ben Zatrin when he did this,

1503
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,880
 which is an amphetamine that a lot of people were on

1504
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:26,720
 at the time.

1505
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:30,400
 It was like a nasal spray, like a kind of pseudo Fred thing,

1506
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:33,960
 but then it made everyone, gave lots of people lots of energy

1507
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:35,800
 'cause it's basically amphetamines.

1508
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:37,200
 - It's not very cool though, is it?

1509
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,480
 It's not like-- - It's not cool now.

1510
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:41,840
 - The jazz guys trying to find a new vein for the horse.

1511
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:43,400
 It's like, if it's a nasal spray,

1512
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:45,880
 I do think that's an uncool administration

1513
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:46,920
 for a mind-altering drug.

1514
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:49,480
 - Yeah, I guess so, but it was cool at the time.

1515
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:50,320
 - Yeah.

1516
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:52,680
 - And then it kind of did go out of fashion.

1517
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:55,360
 - And he went out of fashion within his own circle as well.

1518
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:56,520
 That's one of the tragic things.

1519
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:59,280
 But he did die young, I think he was 47 when he died.

1520
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:01,960
 And even his friends, his closest friends,

1521
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:05,040
 like Alan Ginsberg, didn't want to know him at that point.

1522
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:08,040
 He had turned from this amazingly magnetic character

1523
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:11,080
 that basically defined this whole movement

1524
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:13,720
 to someone who became very bitter, very angry.

1525
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:17,680
 - He used to write newspapers about Boy Scout badges changing.

1526
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:18,960
 They got quite right-winged in the end.

1527
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,920
 He was always quite racist.

1528
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:22,080
 - But those letters to the newspapers,

1529
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:24,520
 they were so long, they couldn't get in.

1530
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:26,640
 - They were all on little scrolls, so sad.

1531
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:28,400
 You know, the original On The Road,

1532
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,480
 a dog ate part of his homework?

1533
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:31,320
 - Yes.

1534
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:32,160
 - Yeah, genuinely.

1535
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:33,000
 - Really.

1536
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,240
 - It was auctioned some years ago,

1537
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:37,800
 and the condition notes noted that the final 25 pages,

1538
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,920
 or equivalent of, had been chewed and torn away

1539
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:41,640
 by a dog belonging to Kerouac's friend

1540
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:43,040
 in April or May, 1951.

1541
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:44,440
 - But the thing is that no one who read it

1542
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:46,400
 ever got up to the last 25 pages,

1543
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,400
 so no one ever noticed.

1544
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:51,600
 - On The Road was published in 1957, was a huge hit.

1545
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,880
 And immediately he couldn't handle it.

1546
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:55,480
 He just like, he sort of had a breakdown.

1547
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:57,000
 His publisher said he ended up like lying

1548
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,760
 on the floor staring at the ceiling,

1549
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:00,960
 not knowing what to do, became terrible alcoholic.

1550
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:03,240
 - I think we said that he went to a lookout tower,

1551
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:04,080
 didn't he?

1552
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:05,080
 Was that after that as well?

1553
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:06,040
 - Oh yes, that's right.

1554
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:09,200
 - He kind of just lived on his own for months and months

1555
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:11,440
 in the middle of the forest looking for fires.

1556
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:12,280
 - Did you find any?

1557
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:15,560
 - No, he didn't, but apparently he did leave behind him

1558
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:19,320
 a column of feces about the height and size of a baby.

1559
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:22,360
 - Why, what an upsetting simile point.

1560
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:24,560
 For your column of feces.

1561
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:27,080
 There's so much else you could compare it to,

1562
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:28,800
 like a melon or a melon.

1563
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:29,640
 - A melon?

1564
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:31,120
 - Melons are smaller than babies.

1565
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:31,960
 - How big are your melons?

1566
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:34,120
 - Excuse me, how small are your babies?

1567
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:35,800
 (laughing)

1568
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:38,480
 Alan, we're not getting into motorboats again.

1569
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,880
 - Do you know the only reason he became so famous

1570
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:42,440
 and it all ruined him anyway?

1571
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:45,600
 It was because of one review he got in The New York Times.

1572
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:47,840
 So if the review had not been printed,

1573
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:49,440
 he would have probably stayed a small time.

1574
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,760
 He was a small time before it came out, right?

1575
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:55,320
 But the main reviewer, a guy called Orville Prescott,

1576
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:58,960
 hated him, hated his stuff, but he was away on holiday.

1577
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:00,600
 And so there was a different reviewer

1578
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:02,240
 who just got drafted in for holiday cover

1579
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:04,120
 called Gilbert Milstein.

1580
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:06,240
 And he gave it the biggest smash hit review

1581
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:07,560
 The New York Times had ever given anything.

1582
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:10,800
 He said, "It's publication is a historic occasion.

1583
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:13,760
 "The writing is of a beauty almost breathtaking."

1584
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,720
 And this gave the book absolute rocket fuel

1585
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:17,120
 that made it a huge success.

1586
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:19,880
 Prescott, who was the main guy in charge of reviewing,

1587
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:21,440
 was so angry about this.

1588
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:23,200
 He almost didn't allow it to go in.

1589
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,080
 And then he fired Gilbert Milstein.

1590
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:28,120
 He was never hired again to write The New York Times

1591
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:30,720
 because he loved this stream of consciousness,

1592
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:33,240
 hard to read, beat generation thing.

1593
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:34,080
 - Yeah. - Wow.

1594
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:35,280
 - Love it, all you hate it.

1595
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:37,640
 - Well, listen guys, I can hear the audience at home.

1596
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:40,040
 Script, well, I can hear at least my mom screaming.

1597
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:43,440
 Tell us about the collection that Jim Ersey had.

1598
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:44,280
 - Ah, yes.

1599
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:45,120
 - In which.

1600
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:45,960
 - Can we scroll this content?

1601
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:46,800
 - Why not tell us who this guy is?

1602
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:49,560
 - So he was the owner of the Colts,

1603
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:50,680
 the football team in America.

1604
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:52,480
 And he bought up the scroll.

1605
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:54,840
 And it's part of this big traveling collection that he has.

1606
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:56,720
 So he has the big book,

1607
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:59,440
 the original Alcoholics Anonymous book,

1608
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:01,360
 the first manuscript that was ever written.

1609
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:03,440
 - Oh, I thought you went with everyone's names.

1610
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:05,920
 (all laughing)

1611
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:08,800
 - It's Alcoholics Not Anonymous.

1612
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,600
 - That's the Compromat book.

1613
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:12,720
 Just one guy is allowed to know who you are.

1614
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:15,400
 - No, this was the original book

1615
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:18,520
 that William or Bill W. Wilson had written.

1616
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:20,120
 - Actually, wasn't that the Holy Ghost

1617
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:21,160
 who gave him that as well?

1618
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:22,240
 - He was, you're right.

1619
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:23,520
 You're right, it was a huge episode

1620
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:24,640
 for the Holy Ghost, this one.

1621
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:26,360
 (all laughing)

1622
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:28,920
 He has two tickets from the performance

1623
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:31,160
 of our American cousin for Ford's Theatre,

1624
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:33,240
 the night that Lincoln was assassinated.

1625
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:36,120
 He's got a rocking chair that was used by JFK

1626
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:37,400
 inside the White House.

1627
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:39,640
 - I should just say, he did die this year.

1628
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:40,960
 - He did die. - He keeps saying he has.

1629
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:43,280
 - Sorry, he did, he died just over a month ago.

1630
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:44,480
 - Well, he'll be getting a chance

1631
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:45,760
 to chat to the Holy Ghost, won't he?

1632
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:46,600
 That's exciting.

1633
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:47,960
 (all laughing)

1634
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:49,960
 - He has the greatest collection of guitars.

1635
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:51,200
 - Yeah. - In the world.

1636
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:52,880
 Or he has, I should say, again.

1637
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:55,960
 It was called that in the Guitar Magazine in 2021.

1638
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:59,600
 And every famous guitarist you can name, he has.

1639
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:02,000
 - Eric Clapton.

1640
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,200
 - George Harrison. - Jimmy Bage.

1641
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:04,560
 - Django Reinhardt.

1642
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:05,920
 - Oh. - What the fuck?

1643
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:06,760
 - I just don't think

1644
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:07,600
 you've written them all down.

1645
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:09,520
 - No, I haven't. - I bet he does though.

1646
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:10,560
 - I think Betty does have a Django.

1647
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:11,480
 - Yeah, I'm sure he does.

1648
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:13,600
 'Cause I was really hoping that you would just name

1649
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:16,280
 any of these 20 names that I have on my list.

1650
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:17,120
 - Give us one or two.

1651
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:17,960
 - Oh, okay. - No, I mean,

1652
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:19,280
 Elvis, George Harrison, John Lennon,

1653
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,480
 Paul McCartney, Jerry Garcia, Prince Les Paul,

1654
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:22,320
 blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1655
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:23,160
 - Kurt Cobain.

1656
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:25,040
 He has Kurt Cobain's Nevermind guitar.

1657
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:27,960
 It's like one of the most iconic grunge guitars you've ever had.

1658
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:29,400
 - Just the guitar he brings out at a party

1659
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:30,880
 and they say, "Oh, for fuck's sake."

1660
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:32,200
 Nevermind, nevermind, nevermind.

1661
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:33,400
 (all laughing)

1662
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:35,980
 (upbeat music)

1663
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:39,120
 - Okay, that's it.

1664
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:40,080
 That is all of our facts.

1665
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:41,400
