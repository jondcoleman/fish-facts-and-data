00:00:30,00:00:32,this is the full experience.
00:00:32,00:00:33,This is a sort of warts and all version
00:00:33,00:00:34,that you'll get to see.
00:00:34,00:00:36,"It's all the bloopers, it's all the extra bits"
00:00:36,00:00:38,that end up getting edited out.
00:00:38,00:00:41,There's all the admin at the top of the show.
00:00:41,00:00:43,Who doesn't love admin at the top of a show?

00:01:39,00:01:40,So the episode that went up a few days ago
00:01:40,00:01:41,"was all about cheese,"
00:01:41,00:01:43,"where they answer the big cheese questions,"
00:01:43,00:01:45,"like, you know, how do they put the holes in Swiss cheese?"
00:01:45,00:01:47,Who eats the world's hardest cheese?
00:01:47,00:01:49,Why do people put Parmesan into a bank?
00:01:49,00:01:50,All the biggies.

00:01:56,00:02:00,but specifically do check them out now at BBC Sounds.
00:02:00,00:02:02,"All right, let's get into the show."
00:02:02,00:02:03,On with the podcast.
00:02:03,00:02:09,(upbeat music)
00:02:09,00:02:21,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:02:21,00:02:23,"of No Such Thing as a Fish,"
00:02:23,00:02:25,a weekly podcast coming to you
00:02:25,00:02:27,from the QI offices in Hoburn.
00:02:27,00:02:28,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:02:28,00:02:30,"I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,"
00:02:30,00:02:32,"James Harkin, and Andrew Hunter Murray."
00:02:32,00:02:34,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:02:34,00:02:37,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.
00:02:37,00:02:40,"And in no particular order, here we go."
00:02:40,00:02:43,"Starting with fact number one, and that is James."
00:02:43,00:02:45,"- Okay, my fact this week is that"
00:02:45,00:02:47,"if you are 20 years old now,"
00:02:47,00:02:50,there is a chance that your great grandparents
00:02:50,00:02:53,might have met thanks to computer dating.
00:02:53,00:02:56,- That's wild. - It doesn't make sense.
00:02:56,00:02:57,"I had to ask James to explain this,"
00:02:57,00:03:00,even after we'd said this would be our fact.
00:03:00,00:03:02,"That doesn't work, James, and he proved it."
00:03:02,00:03:03,"Go on, prove it."
00:03:03,00:03:07,"- So for the hard of thinking who are listening,"
00:03:07,00:03:10,"this is an article that I read,"
00:03:10,00:03:13,"was written by Adrian Covert in Gizmodo,"
00:03:13,00:03:15,and it's about a guy called Lewis Altfest.
00:03:15,00:03:18,"And Lewis saw a Pempal machine,"
00:03:18,00:03:20,"which let you fill down his questionnaire,"
00:03:20,00:03:21,"and then it fed it into a machine,"
00:03:21,00:03:23,and it found you the perfect Pempal.
00:03:23,00:03:27,And he decided that he would do the same with dating.
00:03:27,00:03:29,"So he called up his friend called Robert Ross,"
00:03:29,00:03:32,"who worked at IBM, and they made a computer program"
00:03:32,00:03:34,called TACT that stood for Technical
00:03:34,00:03:37,Automated Compatibility Testing.
00:03:37,00:03:40,"They did that in New York, and it was in 1964."
00:03:40,00:03:43,"So, for instance, if your great-grandparents"
00:03:43,00:03:46,"got together due to TACT in 1964,"
00:03:46,00:03:49,your grandmother could be born in 1965.
00:03:49,00:03:51,"She could have had your mother in 1985,"
00:03:51,00:03:54,"and then your mother could have had you in 2005,"
00:03:54,00:03:55,and you would be 20 this year.
00:03:55,00:03:56,- Yeah. - It's stunning.
00:03:56,00:03:57,- It was great.
00:03:57,00:03:59,- It was amazing at the time.
00:03:59,00:04:00,It was such like everyone thought computers
00:04:00,00:04:01,would know the answer as well.
00:04:01,00:04:04,It wasn't the best at pairing people.
00:04:04,00:04:06,It did at one point match an older brother
00:04:06,00:04:07,with his younger sister.
00:04:07,00:04:09,(all laughing)
00:04:09,00:04:11,- They have a lot in common with it.
00:04:11,00:04:12,- And I turned out fine.
00:04:12,00:04:14,(all laughing)
00:04:14,00:04:17,"- Yeah, that actually weirdly, I think shows it does work."
00:04:17,00:04:19,Shared interests.
00:04:19,00:04:23,"- It just, you haven't put in the anti-incest layer"
00:04:23,00:04:23,into the program.
00:04:23,00:04:24,- You haven't clicked that button.
00:04:24,00:04:26,Most people would click that button.
00:04:26,00:04:27,(all laughing)
00:04:27,00:04:29,"- He was crossing his fingers, that guy."
00:04:29,00:04:31,"- So, is this the one, 'cause I read about"
00:04:31,00:04:33,"one of the very early computer dating services,"
00:04:33,00:04:36,"and it asks clients to pick from the dislikes,"
00:04:36,00:04:39,"and the dislikes were, I'd say, very much of their time."
00:04:39,00:04:41,"- Yes, this is the one you're talking about."
00:04:41,00:04:42,"- From one to six, it was,"
00:04:42,00:04:44,what do you think about affected people?
00:04:44,00:04:46,I think that's a really good question.
00:04:46,00:04:48,"Like, I'm a bit affected, you know?"
00:04:48,00:04:50,- You mean like people who have affectations.
00:04:50,00:04:51,"- Exactly, a bit pretentious."
00:04:51,00:04:53,"I presume, and that still means they've been affected"
00:04:53,00:04:53,"by an event. - Oh, okay."
00:04:53,00:04:55,"I thought it wasn't a typo for infected, 'cause that--"
00:04:55,00:04:56,(all laughing)
00:04:56,00:04:58,- But who's saying I love those?
00:04:58,00:05:00,Are there people going--
00:05:00,00:05:02,"- Well, after '60s, some people had affectations"
00:05:02,00:05:03,"in the '60s, and that was cool."
00:05:03,00:05:05,"It was the New Age, man."
00:05:05,00:05:06,"- But I think like, it wasn't that you only picked"
00:05:06,00:05:08,"one of them, you kind of picked them in order."
00:05:08,00:05:09,"- Oh, okay. - That kind of thing."
00:05:09,00:05:12,"- 'Cause two through six that you might dislike were,"
00:05:12,00:05:16,"birth control, foreigners, free love, homosexuals,"
00:05:16,00:05:17,and interracial marriage.
00:05:17,00:05:19,"But it never says sisters, so."
00:05:19,00:05:22,(all laughing)
00:05:22,00:05:25,"Yeah, that was true."
00:05:25,00:05:26,"So you paid $5, basically,"
00:05:26,00:05:28,and you would answer loads of questions.
00:05:28,00:05:29,"You would also, the men would be asked"
00:05:29,00:05:31,to rank women's hairstyles.
00:05:31,00:05:34,Women would be shown pictures of men in different settings.
00:05:34,00:05:38,"So there'd be a man chopping wood, a man who was painting,"
00:05:38,00:05:41,and a man who was in a garage working with a drill.
00:05:41,00:05:44,And you had to say which of those you fancy the most.
00:05:44,00:05:46,"- The drill and the chopping wood are very similar, aren't they?"
00:05:46,00:05:47,What are the two different personality types?
00:05:47,00:05:49,"- Well, some people are more discerning than you, Anna."
00:05:49,00:05:50,(all laughing)
00:05:50,00:05:53,- That just sounds like outdoorsy versus indoorsy to me.
00:05:53,00:05:55,"- I suppose, drill is indoorsy."
00:05:55,00:05:58,"- I think like chopping wood shows muscular strength,"
00:05:58,00:06:02,whereas drill shows more kind of industrial ability.
00:06:02,00:06:04,"- DIY maybe. - Yeah, yeah."
00:06:04,00:06:07,"- And these things, they started off,"
00:06:07,00:06:09,and they were kind of thought of as a gimmick.
00:06:09,00:06:10,"So for instance, this guy at Altfest,"
00:06:10,00:06:12,he just gave up in the end on his tact.
00:06:12,00:06:17,But actually he met his partner due to tact.
00:06:17,00:06:20,"- Did he? - Yeah, so he married a reporter"
00:06:20,00:06:21,who'd come to interview him
00:06:21,00:06:23,about how terrible his machine was.
00:06:23,00:06:24,(all laughing)
00:06:24,00:06:26,And they hit it off.
00:06:26,00:06:27,"- Yeah, they were funny."
00:06:27,00:06:29,"There was another one in 1965 in New York,"
00:06:29,00:06:30,which was called Operation Match.
00:06:30,00:06:33,I was reading the memories of someone who went on one of those
00:06:33,00:06:35,and had three very unsuccessful dates.
00:06:35,00:06:37,"But the way all these things worked, I guess,"
00:06:37,00:06:38,is you sent in a bit of money
00:06:38,00:06:40,"and you filled out a questionnaire,"
00:06:40,00:06:41,which could be very long.
00:06:41,00:06:43,So Operation Match was 75 questions.
00:06:43,00:06:45,And then they took your questionnaire
00:06:45,00:06:46,and they tried to match it up with others
00:06:46,00:06:48,"using a computer algorithm,"
00:06:48,00:06:51,which is why it was computerized or computer dating.
00:06:51,00:06:52,"But the questions were,"
00:06:52,00:06:55,I couldn't look out why this one existed.
00:06:55,00:06:57,"So there was a question in this one,"
00:06:57,00:07:01,"which was, I'd considered dating a woman as young as,"
00:07:01,00:07:02,or a man as old as.
00:07:02,00:07:07,"So if you're a man, it was a woman as young as 17 or whatever."
00:07:07,00:07:09,"And if you were a woman,"
00:07:09,00:07:11,it was like I considered dating a man as old as that.
00:07:11,00:07:12,"- Yeah, right."
00:07:12,00:07:13,"- But you wouldn't ask a woman,"
00:07:13,00:07:14,I considered dating a man as young as.
00:07:14,00:07:15,"Did it just assume that women could,"
00:07:15,00:07:17,would date men who were infinitely young?
00:07:17,00:07:19,- The cougar had not been invented.
00:07:19,00:07:20,That's what we're saying.
00:07:20,00:07:22,"- Yeah, I think that is what we're saying."
00:07:22,00:07:24,"Yeah. - Yeah, I suppose so."
00:07:24,00:07:25,- Very weird.
00:07:25,00:07:27,And then are you sexually experienced or inexperienced?
00:07:27,00:07:30,"And also, what does this mean?"
00:07:30,00:07:33,Is extensive sexual activity preparation for your marriage?
00:07:33,00:07:34,Yes or no?
00:07:34,00:07:36,"- Answer, see previous questions."
00:07:37,00:07:41,So Operation Match was invented by Jeff Tarr and Vaughn Morrill.
00:07:41,00:07:43,"Jeff Tarr met his wife,"
00:07:43,00:07:45,"not by going on and doing it himself,"
00:07:45,00:07:48,"but someone who was using Operation Match said,"
00:07:48,00:07:49,"""Oh, I know someone who you'd be good with."""
00:07:49,00:07:51,"So they met up, they got married."
00:07:51,00:07:53,They had a daughter called Jennifer.
00:07:53,00:07:56,She goes on to marry the co-founder of OKCupid.
00:07:56,00:07:57,- No.
00:07:57,00:07:58,- Yeah. - Whoa.
00:07:58,00:07:59,"- Yeah, so. - Tasty."
00:07:59,00:08:00,- Yeah.
00:08:00,00:08:02,"- So dating apps are declining a lot, right?"
00:08:02,00:08:04,"In the UK, I think users are dropping."
00:08:04,00:08:05,"- Oh, really? - Of the really big sites."
00:08:05,00:08:06,Things like Tinder.
00:08:06,00:08:08,And it's because people get exhausted
00:08:08,00:08:10,and they get burned out with them.
00:08:10,00:08:12,And it's just this endless array of new faces.
00:08:12,00:08:14,You can start thinking everyone's the same.
00:08:14,00:08:16,"And it's also, it's very sort of private."
00:08:16,00:08:18,"So the pool of dates is massive,"
00:08:18,00:08:19,but you don't have any friends in common.
00:08:19,00:08:21,"So people often behave badly,"
00:08:21,00:08:22,they don't get back in touch or whatever.
00:08:22,00:08:23,- I see.
00:08:23,00:08:26,"Yeah, so if you date someone who's a friend of your friend,"
00:08:26,00:08:28,then you kind of feel like you can't be an asshole
00:08:28,00:08:29,because it will get back to you.
00:08:29,00:08:31,- There's a shame mechanism there.
00:08:31,00:08:32,Whereas you can absolutely just go
00:08:32,00:08:35,to some random person you've met once and all that.
00:08:35,00:08:35,"Anyway. - Oh, thank you."
00:08:35,00:08:37,- I don't know.
00:08:37,00:08:40,But I found this claim that some sites
00:08:40,00:08:42,"are saying things like, if you pay a lot extra,"
00:08:42,00:08:44,"like if you pay 45 quid a month,"
00:08:44,00:08:46,"you'll go on three times as many dates, right?"
00:08:46,00:08:47,- Okay.
00:08:47,00:08:52,"- So, this is just to say, yesterday I said to my wife,"
00:08:52,00:08:54,"I'm downloading Hinge by the way,"
00:08:54,00:08:57,'cause I wanted to test if there are special offers on.
00:08:57,00:08:59,But what I forgot to say was that I was doing
00:08:59,00:09:01,this as part of podcast research.
00:09:01,00:09:04,"From her perspective, I just said, I'm downloading Hinge."
00:09:04,00:09:06,I want to see if there's got special offers
00:09:06,00:09:07,on right now.
00:09:07,00:09:08,- Okay.
00:09:08,00:09:09,- Let's not put out this fact ever.
00:09:09,00:09:13,And then she'll never have caught to believe
00:09:13,00:09:15,that's what you were doing.
00:09:15,00:09:18,"I really, I think my favorite thing is Love Getty."
00:09:18,00:09:20,Did you come across this gadget?
00:09:20,00:09:22,"It, 1.3 million was sold."
00:09:22,00:09:23,So it was quite popular.
00:09:23,00:09:24,- Is it Spaghetti?
00:09:24,00:09:25,Love Spaghetti.
00:09:25,00:09:27,"- It's just for people who love Spaghetti, yes."
00:09:27,00:09:29,- Is it not people who just love John Paul Getty?
00:09:29,00:09:31,- It's neither of these things.
00:09:31,00:09:31,- Or Getty Images?
00:09:31,00:09:32,Is that the--
00:09:32,00:09:33,(laughing)
00:09:33,00:09:34,- Any further guesses?
00:09:34,00:09:36,"It's like, Get You Love, Love Getty."
00:09:36,00:09:37,It's a love getter.
00:09:37,00:09:38,"- Got it, yeah."
00:09:38,00:09:39,- There we go.
00:09:39,00:09:42,And this was a thing in Japan in 1998.
00:09:42,00:09:44,"Basically, it was a thing that you kept in your pocket."
00:09:44,00:09:47,"And if you saw someone who was a bit fit,"
00:09:47,00:09:49,then you turned it on.
00:09:49,00:09:51,"And it meant that if they had the same gadget,"
00:09:51,00:09:52,then their gadget would buzz.
00:09:52,00:09:54,Or you keep yours on all the time.
00:09:54,00:09:56,And whenever you were within 15 feet of someone
00:09:56,00:09:58,"who had a gadget that was also turned on,"
00:09:58,00:10:00,"it would buzz and you could be like, oh my God,"
00:10:00,00:10:00,something's buzzing.
00:10:00,00:10:01,"- Can I just say,"
00:10:01,00:10:03,"so what you do is when you see someone attractive,"
00:10:03,00:10:05,you start fiddling in your pockets.
00:10:05,00:10:06,(laughing)
00:10:06,00:10:08,"I mean, yeah."
00:10:08,00:10:09,- It was a small vibration.
00:10:09,00:10:11,- I don't think you need a buzzer.
00:10:11,00:10:14,I think people are gonna know what you think immediately.
00:10:14,00:10:15,It's such a bad idea.
00:10:15,00:10:17,Like it's a stalker's charter.
00:10:17,00:10:19,"- But also the flaw seems to be that,"
00:10:19,00:10:22,"let's say I'm looking across the room at Barry,"
00:10:22,00:10:24,"and I think he's hot, and I turn my thing on."
00:10:24,00:10:26,"And Barry doesn't have one of these love getties,"
00:10:26,00:10:28,but Norman on the other side of the tube carriage
00:10:28,00:10:29,does have one.
00:10:29,00:10:31,"His goes off, and then he's looking at me,"
00:10:31,00:10:32,thinking she fancies me.
00:10:32,00:10:33,- She's fiddling in her pants.
00:10:33,00:10:35,- She's fiddling.
00:10:35,00:10:36,- Is that a love getty in her pocket?
00:10:36,00:10:38,(laughing)
00:10:38,00:10:39,"In Spain at the moment,"
00:10:39,00:10:42,"if you go to supermarkets after seven o'clock,"
00:10:42,00:10:45,you might not be able to get a pineapple.
00:10:45,00:10:46,- Okay.
00:10:46,00:10:46,- Okay.
00:10:46,00:10:47,- Is this research for this part?
00:10:47,00:10:50,- Just to complain from my last holiday.
00:10:50,00:10:53,"No, so this is a TikTok video that's been going around"
00:10:53,00:10:55,telling people that if you're lonely
00:10:55,00:10:59,to go to your nearest Mercadonia supermarket
00:10:59,00:11:01,to take a pineapple and put it upside down
00:11:01,00:11:02,"in your shopping cart,"
00:11:02,00:11:04,"and then see if anyone else is doing the same,"
00:11:04,00:11:07,"and if two upside down panapples see each other,"
00:11:07,00:11:09,then they might get together.
00:11:09,00:11:10,- So that's just like the love getty.
00:11:10,00:11:13,"It's a slightly more basic version of love getty,"
00:11:13,00:11:14,but at least you've got deniability.
00:11:14,00:11:17,"Whereas if you've got a love getty, it buzzes."
00:11:17,00:11:18,"Whereas if you've just got a pineapple,"
00:11:18,00:11:20,"you could say, ""Oh no, I'm just--"""
00:11:20,00:11:21,"- It's upside down, though, isn't it?"
00:11:21,00:11:22,- It's just all that way.
00:11:22,00:11:24,"- I'm making a pina colada, whatever."
00:11:24,00:11:26,"- Well, the problem is that basically,"
00:11:26,00:11:28,the trend has taken off a little bit in Spain.
00:11:28,00:11:31,Police have been called to unruly crowds
00:11:31,00:11:33,of people trying to find pineapples.
00:11:33,00:11:36,"And employees of Mercadonia are so sick of it,"
00:11:36,00:11:39,"they've been hiding their pineapples at five to seven,"
00:11:39,00:11:40,so no one can get them.
00:11:40,00:11:42,(laughing)
00:11:42,00:11:44,"- It's a huge pain, people just walking around the shop"
00:11:44,00:11:46,with a single pineapple in their basket.
00:11:46,00:11:47,"Like, you're a business here."
00:11:47,00:11:49,You're trying to sell other goods.
00:11:49,00:11:51,- Do we not think they buy the pineapples at the end?
00:11:51,00:11:52,"Do you think some people probably just do it,"
00:11:52,00:11:54,"get their date, and then put the pineapple back?"
00:11:54,00:11:56,"- I think if you don't get the date, you would do that."
00:11:56,00:11:58,"If you do get the date, probably you want to show"
00:11:58,00:12:00,that you're not a skin flint and that you can afford
00:12:00,00:12:01,to buy pineapples. - That's a really good point.
00:12:01,00:12:02,"I'll get this, darling."
00:12:02,00:12:04,(laughing)
00:12:04,00:12:05,"- Does that happen here, or is that just in Spain?"
00:12:05,00:12:08,"- Just in Spain, the supermarket chain Mercadonia"
00:12:08,00:12:11,has yet to get into the British market.
00:12:11,00:12:14,"- But next time, Andy, you're in a supermarket"
00:12:14,00:12:15,"with your wife, just make sure it's the right way up."
00:12:15,00:12:18,"Bad and hinge combined, something's definitely going on."
00:12:18,00:12:20,"- Well, do you remember, actually, Madison,"
00:12:20,00:12:22,the cheating website?
00:12:22,00:12:23,- No.
00:12:23,00:12:23,- Do you not?
00:12:23,00:12:25,(laughing)
00:12:25,00:12:27,"- Damn, that was so impossible."
00:12:27,00:12:28,(laughing)
00:12:28,00:12:30,"- What, website?"
00:12:30,00:12:33,"- Well, that's a list of hacked email addresses"
00:12:33,00:12:34,that's different.
00:12:34,00:12:35,(laughing)
00:12:35,00:12:37,"- Okay, let's move on."
00:12:37,00:12:38,"Type it back on there, too."
00:12:38,00:12:40,"- No, no, no."
00:12:40,00:12:41,"This is amazing, right?"
00:12:41,00:12:42,"So it was an affairs website, okay?"
00:12:42,00:12:45,"It marketed itself to mostly blokes who say,"
00:12:45,00:12:46,"""Hey, you want to have an affair?"""
00:12:46,00:12:47,Then join Ashley Madison.
00:12:47,00:12:50,They were hacked into by some disgruntled staffers
00:12:50,00:12:52,or former staff or something.
00:12:52,00:12:55,"And ha, ha, ha, it turned out 95% of the members"
00:12:55,00:12:57,"of Ashley Madison were men, right?"
00:12:57,00:12:59,So that was the headline that went around the world.
00:12:59,00:13:00,It was quite a big story at the time.
00:13:00,00:13:02,"The really interesting thing is,"
00:13:02,00:13:04,"a journalist called Annalyn Newitz looked into it,"
00:13:04,00:13:06,found something much more perturbing.
00:13:06,00:13:07,"It was that the parent company,"
00:13:07,00:13:10,"who were called Avid Live Media,"
00:13:10,00:13:14,"had made 70,000 fake women bots."
00:13:14,00:13:16,"They would just say things like, ""Hi, and what's up?"""
00:13:16,00:13:18,And the men thought they were talking to real women.
00:13:18,00:13:21,"Like, there were 11 million interactions in the database"
00:13:21,00:13:23,"between human men and bot women,"
00:13:23,00:13:25,and the men were paying for every message.
00:13:25,00:13:26,- Right.
00:13:26,00:13:27,- And the company was paying workers
00:13:27,00:13:29,to generate these fake profiles.
00:13:29,00:13:32,"So it was basically real people interacting with bots,"
00:13:32,00:13:33,having no idea about it.
00:13:33,00:13:36,"That's quite, that's the really sinister thing, you know?"
00:13:36,00:13:38,- And let's talk about our level of sympathy for these men.
00:13:38,00:13:40,'Cause I suddenly feel really bad for them.
00:13:40,00:13:42,But I suppose they had gone on a website
00:13:42,00:13:44,to cheat on their wives.
00:13:44,00:13:46,"- In a way, they're doing something good, aren't they?"
00:13:46,00:13:48,"This company, because this hypothetical man"
00:13:48,00:13:50,"has gone on the website to cheat on his wife,"
00:13:50,00:13:52,but they're just putting a fake thing up
00:13:52,00:13:53,that he can chat to.
00:13:53,00:13:55,So he's not gonna be able to have the affair.
00:13:55,00:13:56,What is sin?
00:13:56,00:13:58,- I think it's what we're asking.
00:13:58,00:14:00,"He thinks he is sinning, so is he?"
00:14:00,00:14:04,"If I'm just talking to a chatbot, that's for God's sake."
00:14:04,00:14:06,- I remember years ago when there was the rise
00:14:06,00:14:09,"of niche dating places when I was single,"
00:14:09,00:14:12,"I went on to, I think it was like a ghost hunter's"
00:14:12,00:14:13,dating site.
00:14:13,00:14:14,- Of course you did.
00:14:14,00:14:19,"- Yeah, and I got on it and it's just all men."
00:14:19,00:14:20,But--
00:14:20,00:14:21,- The ghost dating.
00:14:21,00:14:23,"- Yeah, but their profiles with their blurb came up,"
00:14:23,00:14:24,and all of them sounded so interesting.
00:14:24,00:14:26,So I actually messaged a couple.
00:14:26,00:14:26,- No.
00:14:26,00:14:27,"- Yeah, just to say like, hey,"
00:14:27,00:14:29,can you tell me about ghost hunting?
00:14:29,00:14:31,'Cause I'm not actually interested sexually.
00:14:31,00:14:34,"I'm just like, you sound really interesting."
00:14:34,00:14:35,"- Ooh, it's like to me."
00:14:35,00:14:41,- I've got one last example of someone who made it big
00:14:41,00:14:43,"in the world of creating online dating,"
00:14:43,00:14:47,a guy called Gary Kremen who created match.com.
00:14:47,00:14:49,What's impressive about him is he seemed to just
00:14:49,00:14:52,"cleaned up on domain names early on, right?"
00:14:52,00:14:54,'Cause that's where he's made a large fortune from.
00:14:54,00:14:56,So he owned sex.com.
00:14:56,00:14:58,"Can you imagine owning sex.com, yeah."
00:14:58,00:15:01,And there was a big case where someone forged fake documents
00:15:01,00:15:03,"so that the domain name went over to them,"
00:15:03,00:15:06,"and he had to fight them for years and years,"
00:15:06,00:15:08,and there's now an outstanding bill of 65 million
00:15:08,00:15:10,"that is owed to Gary Kremen,"
00:15:10,00:15:11,which has not yet been paid by this person.
00:15:11,00:15:13,"- What's on sex.com, is it porn, I guess?"
00:15:13,00:15:15,"- He was gonna use it in the way that he was using match.com,"
00:15:15,00:15:19,but match.com just flew into huge success immediately.
00:15:19,00:15:21,So it was just kind of sitting there dormant.
00:15:21,00:15:26,"He also owned computer.com, which he sold for 500,000."
00:15:26,00:15:29,"But he set up match.com, and even his girlfriend"
00:15:29,00:15:31,"found a partner on there, which wasn't him."
00:15:31,00:15:34,She joined up and met someone else and left him.
00:15:34,00:15:36,"Yeah, and he said, ""Look how successful it is."""
00:15:36,00:15:38,- What are you hoping for if you buy computer.com?
00:15:38,00:15:40,It's just old people going on Google
00:15:40,00:15:42,"and typing computer.com, 'cause they think"
00:15:42,00:15:44,that's how they turn it on.
00:15:44,00:15:45,- It's very much like Donald Trump saying
00:15:45,00:15:48,"everything is computer now, it's a bit, okay."
00:15:48,00:15:51,(upbeat music)
00:15:51,00:15:55,"- Okay, it is time for fact number two,"
00:15:55,00:15:56,and that is my fact.
00:15:56,00:15:59,My fact this week is that one of the original
00:15:59,00:16:03,"57 Boy Scout badges was the invention badge,"
00:16:03,00:16:05,"which required kids to not only invent something new,"
00:16:05,00:16:08,but obtain a patent for it too.
00:16:08,00:16:10,- It's so hard.
00:16:10,00:16:11,"- I mean, it's a lengthy process"
00:16:11,00:16:13,to get a patent in America for an invention.
00:16:13,00:16:14,- Is it hard?
00:16:14,00:16:16,'Cause there's so much random shit that's been patented
00:16:16,00:16:17,that you see.
00:16:17,00:16:18,That never went in here.
00:16:18,00:16:19,"- I always seem it's piece of piss, actually."
00:16:19,00:16:21,"- Yeah, I always thought you could just draw a picture"
00:16:21,00:16:23,on a beer mat and just send it in
00:16:23,00:16:24,and then give you a patent.
00:16:24,00:16:26,- I think it works like that.
00:16:26,00:16:28,"This idea of yours for a beer mat is incredible, so."
00:16:28,00:16:30,Not as easy as it looks.
00:16:30,00:16:32,- Is it quite a process?
00:16:32,00:16:34,"- Well, I think it costs."
00:16:34,00:16:36,You got to pay in order to have it accepted
00:16:36,00:16:37,to the submission and so on.
00:16:37,00:16:39,"Like, yeah, it's a lengthy process."
00:16:39,00:16:42,And basically they dropped the badge largely
00:16:42,00:16:44,because no one was really achieving it.
00:16:44,00:16:45,"So the invention badge,"
00:16:45,00:16:47,it's part of the American Boy Scout specifically.
00:16:47,00:16:50,"There were 57 original merit badges that you could get,"
00:16:50,00:16:52,like archery and swimming and so on.
00:16:52,00:16:53,And invention was part of it.
00:16:53,00:16:58,So that launched in 1911 and they took it out by 1914
00:16:58,00:17:01,"and only 10 scouts in that time managed to get it,"
00:17:01,00:17:03,which I think is a very high number.
00:17:03,00:17:05,"- Actually, only nine got it in that time."
00:17:05,00:17:06,One person got it in 1915
00:17:06,00:17:08,'cause he'd already started with his invention.
00:17:08,00:17:10,"So they were like, oh, well, I guess you can have it."
00:17:10,00:17:11,- That's apparently one of the rules
00:17:11,00:17:13,with a badge that's been stopped.
00:17:13,00:17:15,If you've started the process
00:17:15,00:17:16,"trying to get it, you can finish it."
00:17:16,00:17:18,- And the inventions have not survived.
00:17:18,00:17:19,Most of them have not survived.
00:17:19,00:17:21,"We don't know what was patented,"
00:17:21,00:17:24,"but we do know one by Graham Thomas Smallwood,"
00:17:24,00:17:28,which was a scout's uniform with a removable sleeve
00:17:28,00:17:30,to stop your Boy Scout badge arm getting dirty.
00:17:30,00:17:31,- I think it's a great idea.
00:17:31,00:17:32,It's really good.
00:17:32,00:17:33,- Is it?
00:17:33,00:17:34,"- Yeah, it's not just that."
00:17:34,00:17:35,You could take the sleeve off
00:17:35,00:17:37,and use it to sew badges onto it.
00:17:37,00:17:39,You can carry on wearing the rest of your Boy Scout thing.
00:17:39,00:17:40,"- Just take the whole jacket off, mate."
00:17:40,00:17:43,"- Yeah, we must have another shirt."
00:17:43,00:17:44,"- I think you still had,"
00:17:44,00:17:45,"from what I could see on the drawing,"
00:17:45,00:17:47,you still had an underneath sleeve.
00:17:47,00:17:48,It was a sort of on top.
00:17:48,00:17:49,"So it's not, you didn't look like"
00:17:49,00:17:50,someone had just ripped your sleeve off.
00:17:50,00:17:52,"- Well, there was a few different things you could do."
00:17:52,00:17:53,You could do that.
00:17:53,00:17:55,And then you could also put a secondary sleeve
00:17:55,00:17:56,on top of your other sleeve.
00:17:56,00:17:57,- Okay.
00:17:57,00:17:59,- So it's like a prophylactic sleeve.
00:17:59,00:18:00,- Was that so it matched the other side?
00:18:00,00:18:02,"- No, it stops you getting dirty."
00:18:02,00:18:03,"Stop shirt, sleeve getting dirty."
00:18:03,00:18:05,- And we've all got these things these days.
00:18:05,00:18:06,- So like you're walking down the street
00:18:06,00:18:08,and you lean on some wet paint
00:18:08,00:18:09,and everyone laughs at you
00:18:09,00:18:10,'cause you got paint on your arm.
00:18:10,00:18:11,"You go, ""Haha!"""
00:18:11,00:18:13,And you pull off your fake sleeve.
00:18:13,00:18:13,- Amazing.
00:18:13,00:18:14,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:18:14,00:18:15,- Incredible.
00:18:15,00:18:17,- Richly deserved patent and badge.
00:18:17,00:18:18,- I can't believe he's not famous.
00:18:18,00:18:20,- The horrific badges back in the day.
00:18:20,00:18:22,Other discontinued Boy Scout badges
00:18:22,00:18:25,on the Wikipedia for them is top drawer reading.
00:18:25,00:18:27,There's beef production.
00:18:27,00:18:28,"- Yep, that's good."
00:18:28,00:18:29,- Lost until 1975.
00:18:29,00:18:31,You get a Boy Scout badge for beef production.
00:18:31,00:18:35,"Blacksmithing, nut culture, hog and pork production,"
00:18:35,00:18:36,taxidermy.
00:18:36,00:18:37,"- Interestingly, hog and pork production"
00:18:37,00:18:40,was discontinued in 1958.
00:18:40,00:18:41,So I wonder what the difference
00:18:41,00:18:43,of the discrepancy between pork and beef is.
00:18:43,00:18:47,We must keep the beef scouts going.
00:18:47,00:18:48,"- Is it, well, there are a lot"
00:18:48,00:18:50,of nine-year-old farmers in those days.
00:18:50,00:18:51,- No.
00:18:51,00:18:52,"- To get the pork production badge,"
00:18:52,00:18:55,you needed to confer with meat market men
00:18:55,00:18:58,"and from their instruction, draw a diagram of a hog"
00:18:58,00:19:02,and mark and name the parts for butcher classification.
00:19:02,00:19:03,- It's so good.
00:19:03,00:19:04,I think our children should be learning that kind of stuff.
00:19:04,00:19:05,- I love those details.
00:19:05,00:19:06,All the things that they had to do.
00:19:06,00:19:08,Like a farmhouse and planning
00:19:08,00:19:10,was one of the merit badges you could get.
00:19:10,00:19:11,"And as part of that,"
00:19:11,00:19:12,you had to present a drawing plan
00:19:12,00:19:14,of sewage disposal for a country home.
00:19:14,00:19:16,(laughing)
00:19:16,00:19:16,- Amazing.
00:19:16,00:19:17,"I mean, these are the skills of the future."
00:19:17,00:19:18,- I don't know.
00:19:18,00:19:19,I don't like that element.
00:19:19,00:19:20,It reminds me a lot of Duke of Edinburgh.
00:19:20,00:19:22,I don't know if anyone did that
00:19:22,00:19:23,where basically you thought it was just going
00:19:23,00:19:25,on a fun walk when there's all this background stuff
00:19:25,00:19:26,you also have to do.
00:19:26,00:19:29,"So all the badges still, there's the family life badge,"
00:19:29,00:19:30,which is quite nice.
00:19:30,00:19:32,It basically means being a good little boy
00:19:32,00:19:33,"or girl to your parents,"
00:19:33,00:19:36,"but you have to write this full proposal, don't you?"
00:19:36,00:19:38,At the start and make lists
00:19:38,00:19:40,and then submit various essays on it.
00:19:40,00:19:42,- It doesn't mean anything to be good to your parents
00:19:42,00:19:44,"if you're doing it just to get a badge, does it?"
00:19:44,00:19:46,- Yeah.
00:19:46,00:19:47,"- I think whatever, whatever works."
00:19:47,00:19:48,- Whatever.
00:19:48,00:19:49,(laughing)
00:19:49,00:19:50,I agree.
00:19:50,00:19:51,"Stalking badge was another one, by the way."
00:19:51,00:19:52,- Stalking.
00:19:52,00:19:53,- That had to go.
00:19:53,00:19:54,(laughing)
00:19:54,00:19:55,They just renamed that as tracking
00:19:55,00:19:57,just to make it more acceptable.
00:19:57,00:19:59,- Do you know what the rarest badge
00:19:59,00:20:02,that anyone got in 2024 was?
00:20:02,00:20:04,"Again, this is all American Boy Scouts."
00:20:04,00:20:05,We should say.
00:20:05,00:20:07,"In fact, I think pretty much everything we've said"
00:20:07,00:20:08,is American Boy Scouts.
00:20:08,00:20:10,"So, okay, I would say in 2024,"
00:20:10,00:20:12,'cause there are some old-school badges
00:20:12,00:20:14,"like Hog and Pork production,"
00:20:14,00:20:15,but there are new ones.
00:20:15,00:20:16,- That's not there anymore.
00:20:16,00:20:19,- There are new ones like being woke or whatever.
00:20:19,00:20:21,Is it one of the new or the old-school ones
00:20:21,00:20:22,that was the least caught on?
00:20:22,00:20:23,"- Oh, it's old-school."
00:20:23,00:20:24,- I reckon.
00:20:24,00:20:25,- Is it motorboating?
00:20:25,00:20:26,'Cause I think that--
00:20:26,00:20:27,(laughing)
00:20:27,00:20:28,- Popping your head between women's boobs.
00:20:28,00:20:29,"- Well, that's the thing."
00:20:29,00:20:30,I think that's got connotations now.
00:20:30,00:20:34,"It is a badge, but I bet a lot of people"
00:20:34,00:20:35,are doing the wrong thing when they try to get it.
00:20:35,00:20:37,- I see what you mean.
00:20:37,00:20:38,Only one kid actually drove a motorboat.
00:20:38,00:20:41,"The others all just went, ""Maw, maw, maw, maw."""
00:20:41,00:20:43,And they get it. (laughing)
00:20:43,00:20:44,- My God.
00:20:44,00:20:46,- It's not that. - Okay.
00:20:46,00:20:48,- I'm trying to think if this actual thing
00:20:48,00:20:50,could have any sexual connotations.
00:20:50,00:20:53,- Is it like a schooner construction?
00:20:53,00:20:56,"- I mean, it's a very difficult thing to guess, really."
00:20:56,00:20:59,It's something that you might associate with the army
00:20:59,00:21:01,as opposed to the scouting movement.
00:21:01,00:21:02,- Okay.
00:21:02,00:21:05,- Something that one person in an army regiment would do.
00:21:05,00:21:07,"- Oh, only because I've read through the big list."
00:21:07,00:21:08,Is it bugling?
00:21:08,00:21:11,"- It's bugling, yes. - Oh, wow."
00:21:11,00:21:13,- I don't know if that is another sexual term.
00:21:13,00:21:15,It feels like it probably should be.
00:21:15,00:21:16,"- Certainly could be, couldn't it?"
00:21:16,00:21:20,"- But yeah, the least common are bugling, surveying,"
00:21:20,00:21:23,"stamp collecting, drafting, composite materials,"
00:21:23,00:21:24,and then it goes on.
00:21:24,00:21:25,- We've lost so many of our traditions.
00:21:25,00:21:26,- And the top three.
00:21:26,00:21:28,"Oh, top one, top one badge in 2024."
00:21:28,00:21:31,"- I think pioneering, 'cause it's so classic."
00:21:31,00:21:33,That's one with ropes and building.
00:21:33,00:21:34,- Not where you put a pioneer ear.
00:21:34,00:21:36,(all laughing)
00:21:36,00:21:38,- Got to get off over dictionary.com.
00:21:38,00:21:41,(all laughing)
00:21:41,00:21:42,"- I just hope to God, Anna,"
00:21:42,00:21:44,you never be a young boy scout
00:21:44,00:21:46,who tells you they're doing a motor birdie.
00:21:46,00:21:47,(all laughing)
00:21:47,00:21:47,And you're gonna go on.
00:21:47,00:21:48,"Go on, mate."
00:21:48,00:21:49,(all laughing)
00:21:49,00:21:51,- Show me your skills.
00:21:51,00:21:53,Don't mind my mate with the poisonous ears.
00:21:53,00:21:54,(all laughing)
00:21:54,00:21:55,He's just going for his.
00:21:55,00:21:57,"- So pioneering, that's your guess, right?"
00:21:57,00:21:59,"- This is easy to get, I reckon."
00:21:59,00:22:01,- Is it like helping a person?
00:22:01,00:22:02,- Geocaching.
00:22:02,00:22:04,"- Helping a person, but in a very specific way."
00:22:04,00:22:06,- Helping old women cross across the road.
00:22:06,00:22:07,- There's no badge for that.
00:22:07,00:22:08,- First aid.
00:22:08,00:22:09,- Correct.
00:22:09,00:22:13,And the biggest gain in popularity in 2024.
00:22:13,00:22:16,This one went from the 121st most popular badge
00:22:16,00:22:19,to the 81st most popular badge.
00:22:19,00:22:20,And it's something that one of us
00:22:20,00:22:23,round this table enjoys.
00:22:23,00:22:24,- But it's a skill.
00:22:24,00:22:25,"- It's not, so it's weighing on"
00:22:25,00:22:27,about electric cars or something.
00:22:27,00:22:27,(all laughing)
00:22:27,00:22:29,- Thank you.
00:22:29,00:22:31,"Was it being a lush, James?"
00:22:31,00:22:34,(all laughing)
00:22:34,00:22:37,- Being weird on ghost dating websites.
00:22:37,00:22:38,"- I wasn't being weird, I was being friendly."
00:22:38,00:22:39,- It was.
00:22:39,00:22:40,- It was a friendly ghost.
00:22:40,00:22:41,- The wife guy badge.
00:22:41,00:22:44,"- No, no, it wasn't, it wasn't, it wasn't."
00:22:44,00:22:46,- It was the golf badge.
00:22:46,00:22:47,- Oh!
00:22:47,00:22:48,- It was the biggest cake.
00:22:48,00:22:49,- Clever.
00:22:49,00:22:50,"- It was a twist, it was him."
00:22:50,00:22:51,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, we were looking at the,"
00:22:51,00:22:53,"that's very good, that's very good."
00:22:53,00:22:54,"There is this really big thing of like,"
00:22:54,00:22:58,"oh, all the badges, they've gone all woke, blah, blah, blah."
00:22:58,00:23:00,"And it's a very, very tiresome talking point"
00:23:00,00:23:03,"because there are things like, there's a money skills one,"
00:23:03,00:23:05,"or you know, or there's Scouts Digital Citizen,"
00:23:05,00:23:07,"or you know, or there's, actually loads of them"
00:23:07,00:23:09,"are just absolutely straight down the line,"
00:23:09,00:23:13,"like athletics, air researcher, angler, caver, climber,"
00:23:13,00:23:15,they're just absolute route one classic scout stuff.
00:23:15,00:23:16,"- Oh yeah, they're all the classics,"
00:23:16,00:23:18,"except one of the really early classics,"
00:23:18,00:23:21,"the Swastika badge, which I don't think was on my list."
00:23:21,00:23:22,- No.
00:23:22,00:23:24,- Baden-Pound loved the Swastika badge.
00:23:24,00:23:25,- What?
00:23:25,00:23:26,- He thought it should be like the defining badge
00:23:26,00:23:27,"of the Scouts, he said."
00:23:27,00:23:28,- So what are you talking about?
00:23:28,00:23:31,"- In 1921, he wrote quite rightly"
00:23:31,00:23:33,"that the Swastika is a symbol used in every part of the world,"
00:23:33,00:23:35,"in the ancient world, in the modern day,"
00:23:35,00:23:39,but now it stands for the badge of fellowship among Scouts.
00:23:39,00:23:41,"And how you used it was, if you're a Boy Scout,"
00:23:41,00:23:44,you always carry around a collection of Swastika badges.
00:23:44,00:23:45,"And if someone did you a good turn,"
00:23:45,00:23:47,"like gave you a leg up or a pie,"
00:23:47,00:23:51,"then you gave them a badge and you said, always wear this."
00:23:51,00:23:53,"And that means if a Boy Scout ever saw you,"
00:23:53,00:23:55,they have to offer to do you a good turn.
00:23:55,00:23:57,- So are we misunderstanding the Nazis?
00:23:57,00:24:00,- They just did a lot of good turns for the Scouts over the years.
00:24:00,00:24:02,"- I think that was it, yeah."
00:24:02,00:24:04,- It was actually just a big sponsored march into Poland.
00:24:04,00:24:07,(laughing)
00:24:07,00:24:08,"'Cause Baden-Pound,"
00:24:08,00:24:10,'cause that was obviously when the Swastika
00:24:10,00:24:12,had not been adopted by the Nazis.
00:24:12,00:24:13,But he was a bit fascistic.
00:24:13,00:24:17,"So in 1937, he wanted to form close ties"
00:24:17,00:24:19,with German youth movements.
00:24:19,00:24:21,"He wrote in his diary in 1939 that ""Mine Camp"""
00:24:21,00:24:22,was a wonderful book with good ideas
00:24:22,00:24:25,"on education, health, propaganda, organization, et cetera."
00:24:25,00:24:28,- I would agree on the propaganda front.
00:24:28,00:24:30,"- Well, it did work, didn't it?"
00:24:30,00:24:30,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:24:30,00:24:33,"I mean, obviously he could have known how it would turn out,"
00:24:33,00:24:34,but...
00:24:34,00:24:35,"- Yeah, wow."
00:24:35,00:24:36,That meant that puts the shows the Swastika thing
00:24:36,00:24:37,in a whole new light.
00:24:37,00:24:38,- I don't want to say...
00:24:38,00:24:40,"By the way, I'm not saying he was an out and out fascist."
00:24:40,00:24:41,"He was just a complicated character,"
00:24:41,00:24:43,"very old fashioned these days,"
00:24:43,00:24:45,but had amazing ideas about like getting young people
00:24:45,00:24:47,"organized and working together,"
00:24:47,00:24:49,"helping each other, all of that,"
00:24:49,00:24:50,like raising good citizens for that.
00:24:50,00:24:51,- And it impressed the world.
00:24:51,00:24:53,"So the reason the American Scouts started,"
00:24:53,00:24:54,"there's an origin story,"
00:24:54,00:24:56,"which is such like, it's like King Arthur."
00:24:56,00:24:58,"It's just like total bullshit,"
00:24:58,00:25:01,but it's a guy called W.D. Boyce.
00:25:01,00:25:03,And W.D. Boyce is one of the five co-founders of the Scouts.
00:25:03,00:25:05,- Scouting for Boyce.
00:25:05,00:25:07,- Scouting for Boyce.
00:25:07,00:25:08,"So you got Baden Powell,"
00:25:08,00:25:10,"who obviously is the British originator,"
00:25:10,00:25:12,"but in America, you then had W.D. Boyce,"
00:25:12,00:25:14,"you had Daniel Carter Beard, James E. West,"
00:25:14,00:25:16,and then you had Ernest Thompson Seton.
00:25:16,00:25:18,The audio was that W.D. Boyce was in England.
00:25:18,00:25:19,"He's an American newspaper guy,"
00:25:19,00:25:21,and he was walking through a foggy street at night.
00:25:21,00:25:22,Couldn't really see anything.
00:25:22,00:25:25,"Went out through the fog, came a Boy Scout,"
00:25:25,00:25:27,"and said, ""Let me help you across the road,"
00:25:27,00:25:29,"""and let me get you to where you need to go."""
00:25:29,00:25:31,"And he thought, ""Wow, this young man with impeccable behavior."
00:25:31,00:25:32,"""What is this?"
00:25:32,00:25:33,"""Oh, you're a Boy Scout."
00:25:33,00:25:33,"""I must do that."""
00:25:33,00:25:35,"And he got taken to Baden Powell,"
00:25:35,00:25:37,"and immediately said, ""I'll set it up."""
00:25:37,00:25:39,"Now, we know that it wasn't even foggy that day"
00:25:39,00:25:40,that he was there in the UK.
00:25:40,00:25:42,"- Well, who thought to do that research?"
00:25:42,00:25:43,"- Well, people who try to work out."
00:25:43,00:25:45,- People who meet urologists.
00:25:45,00:25:47,- Because there's a lot of sort of questions
00:25:47,00:25:49,about who actually is the original founder
00:25:49,00:25:50,of the American Boy Scouts.
00:25:50,00:25:52,"- So often it's raining outside,"
00:25:52,00:25:55,"and I look at my phone up, and it says it's not raining."
00:25:55,00:25:57,And that's like literally happening right now.
00:25:57,00:25:59,I don't trust this stuff.
00:25:59,00:26:00,"- Yeah, I mean, who knows?"
00:26:00,00:26:01,But that's the kind of the story
00:26:01,00:26:03,"that was created, the mythology behind it."
00:26:03,00:26:06,The other guy was Ernest Thompson Seton.
00:26:06,00:26:07,"There's a great fact,"
00:26:07,00:26:08,"I read in a Margaret Atwood book about him,"
00:26:08,00:26:10,"which is when he turned 21,"
00:26:10,00:26:12,his father handed him a bill charging him
00:26:12,00:26:15,"for all the expenses associated with his childhood,"
00:26:15,00:26:19,including the fee for his delivery at birth.
00:26:19,00:26:20,Just hand it to him.
00:26:20,00:26:23,"- Right, he's one of the founders of the American Boy Scouts."
00:26:23,00:26:24,"- I will not do that for my daughter,"
00:26:24,00:26:27,"just to say, 'cause she was on the NHS."
00:26:27,00:26:30,(all laughing)
00:26:30,00:26:34,"- They and Paul, yeah, he married a woman called Olaf Sones."
00:26:34,00:26:37,"He was 55, and she was 23 when they got married."
00:26:37,00:26:40,"And the wedding present for those two,"
00:26:40,00:26:44,"the Scouts were each encouraged to contribute one penny,"
00:26:44,00:26:46,"and a hundred thousand of them did it,"
00:26:46,00:26:49,"and they bought him a car, which is quite cool."
00:26:49,00:26:50,"And then in 1929,"
00:26:50,00:26:53,"to celebrate the 21st birthday of the Scouts,"
00:26:53,00:26:54,they all did the same again.
00:26:54,00:26:55,"But at this stage,"
00:26:55,00:26:58,there were four million Scouts and guides around the world.
00:26:58,00:27:00,And so they bought him a Rolls-Royce.
00:27:00,00:27:02,"- Oh, that's great. - That's great."
00:27:02,00:27:04,"- Isn't that cool? - Long Con, you know?"
00:27:04,00:27:06,(all laughing)
00:27:06,00:27:08,"- They started emitting girls in 2019,"
00:27:08,00:27:10,the Boy Scouts of America.
00:27:10,00:27:13,And who did this piss off?
00:27:13,00:27:15,"- Oh, the Daily Mail readers."
00:27:17,00:27:19,- Was it someone in the Baden-Powell family?
00:27:19,00:27:20,"'Cause he, I mean, he--"
00:27:20,00:27:21,- Very much so.
00:27:21,00:27:23,"- His sister ran the Girl Guides, though,"
00:27:23,00:27:24,when they started.
00:27:24,00:27:26,"- Well, that's, it was the Girl Scouts."
00:27:26,00:27:28,"- Right, right, sorry, Girl Scouts, yeah, yeah."
00:27:28,00:27:31,"- So yeah, they are furious about this,"
00:27:31,00:27:34,because they now call themselves the BSA
00:27:34,00:27:37,"to try and take the boy out of their, like, name."
00:27:37,00:27:39,"And the girls basically said,"
00:27:39,00:27:41,the whole reason they've done this
00:27:41,00:27:43,is to help with their massively plummeting membership.
00:27:43,00:27:47,"They're trying to steal Girl Scouts from our movement,"
00:27:47,00:27:50,"from us, and they're suing them, the name change."
00:27:50,00:27:54,"- People who want their children to join the Girl Scouts,"
00:27:54,00:27:55,they might just Google Girl Scouts
00:27:55,00:27:58,and get the girl members of the Boy Scouts.
00:27:58,00:28:00,"- Yeah, absolutely, so there's beef."
00:28:00,00:28:02,"- If it's called the, there's beef."
00:28:02,00:28:03,- There's a lot.
00:28:03,00:28:04,"- Not since 1968, there is a--"
00:28:04,00:28:05,(all laughing)
00:28:05,00:28:06,- It's gone off now.
00:28:06,00:28:07,- Lovely.
00:28:07,00:28:09,"- So hopefully they'll fight, and then who do you back?"
00:28:09,00:28:11,- But they're called the BSA now.
00:28:11,00:28:12,"- I believe so, yeah."
00:28:12,00:28:13,"- Boy Scouts of America, yeah."
00:28:13,00:28:14,"- What was the B-Stand for, if not for boy?"
00:28:14,00:28:16,"- Well, you don't know the--"
00:28:16,00:28:17,"- Well, you're hiding it, aren't you?"
00:28:17,00:28:18,That's the whole point.
00:28:18,00:28:20,Why did the girls start letting boys in?
00:28:20,00:28:21,- Yes.
00:28:21,00:28:24,"- Yeah, I can see how that's the logical daily mail"
00:28:24,00:28:26,commenters' response.
00:28:26,00:28:27,(all laughing)
00:28:27,00:28:29,"- Sorry, I thought that was the work response."
00:28:29,00:28:31,You're trying to get your work badge.
00:28:31,00:28:32,"- Let me knock down the Girl Scouts,"
00:28:32,00:28:35,'cause it's about time someone's done a peg or two.
00:28:35,00:28:39,"They, according to a blog called Waity Matters,"
00:28:39,00:28:43,are saddling America with a huge amount of obesity.
00:28:43,00:28:45,Thanks to the Girl Scout cookies
00:28:45,00:28:46,that they sell every year.
00:28:46,00:28:50,"So according to this person on the blog,"
00:28:50,00:28:52,they worked out that the Girl Scout cookies
00:28:52,00:28:54,that are sold every year accounts
00:28:54,00:28:58,with three quarters of a million pounds of trans fat.
00:28:58,00:29:00,That's 3.5 billion teaspoons of sugar
00:29:00,00:29:02,that they add to the American food supply.
00:29:02,00:29:04,"- Well, that does sound bad,"
00:29:04,00:29:06,"but we need overall figures, I think,"
00:29:06,00:29:07,"because that's a bit,"
00:29:07,00:29:09,if it can't just be the Girl Scout cookies.
00:29:09,00:29:11,"- Oh, no, there's other stuff going on."
00:29:11,00:29:12,(all laughing)
00:29:12,00:29:14,- But it doesn't help.
00:29:14,00:29:14,- It doesn't help.
00:29:14,00:29:15,- It doesn't help.
00:29:15,00:29:16,"- They're trying to fatten up the boys,"
00:29:16,00:29:18,make them easier to defeat.
00:29:18,00:29:20,(upbeat music)
00:29:20,00:29:25,"- Okay, it is time for fact number three,"
00:29:25,00:29:26,and that is Andy.
00:29:26,00:29:29,- My fact is that one of London's oldest windows
00:29:29,00:29:31,is made of cow horn.
00:29:31,00:29:35,- The window itself.
00:29:35,00:29:36,"- The glass, as it were."
00:29:36,00:29:37,The glass substitute is cow.
00:29:37,00:29:38,- Can you see through it?
00:29:38,00:29:40,"'Cause if not, I say that isn't a window."
00:29:40,00:29:42,"- Well, judge for yourself, James,"
00:29:42,00:29:44,'cause I've got a photo here of me this morning
00:29:44,00:29:46,at the cow horn window.
00:29:46,00:29:48,"- I can see you, but you are in front of it."
00:29:48,00:29:49,"- Yeah, but you can see through it."
00:29:49,00:29:50,It's very see-through-able.
00:29:50,00:29:53,"So, horn, it turns out, is a fantastic window material,"
00:29:53,00:29:55,beaten maybe only by glass.
00:29:55,00:29:57,(all laughing)
00:29:57,00:29:58,This is in London.
00:29:58,00:29:59,It's a place called Guildhall.
00:29:59,00:30:01,"So, there's a separate thing called the City of London,"
00:30:01,00:30:02,"which is different to London, right?"
00:30:02,00:30:05,The City of London is the sort of ancient body.
00:30:05,00:30:06,It's--
00:30:06,00:30:07,"- It means part of London, really."
00:30:07,00:30:09,"- It's right in the middle of London, definitely."
00:30:09,00:30:11,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're still in London."
00:30:11,00:30:13,"But, the actual Guildhall itself,"
00:30:13,00:30:15,"the town hall of the City of London,"
00:30:15,00:30:16,dates back to the 14th century.
00:30:16,00:30:21,"Like, it's the oldest non-religious building in London."
00:30:21,00:30:22,"You know, there are a couple of abbeys and cathedrals"
00:30:22,00:30:24,"and things that are older, but it's really old."
00:30:24,00:30:28,And this window dates back to the 15th century.
00:30:28,00:30:30,"So, it has survived any manner of stuff."
00:30:30,00:30:33,All the other windows in the place have been replaced.
00:30:33,00:30:34,"Like, there's been the Blitz,"
00:30:34,00:30:35,there's been the Great Fire of London.
00:30:35,00:30:37,This window is still there all these years later.
00:30:37,00:30:38,It's kind of amazing.
00:30:38,00:30:39,"- Come on, kids, go and play football outside."
00:30:39,00:30:41,(all laughing)
00:30:41,00:30:42,- I dare you.
00:30:42,00:30:45,- And it's made of cow horn.
00:30:45,00:30:48,"So, you pop the horn off the cow, you slice it up,"
00:30:48,00:30:50,"you heat that, and then you can mold it"
00:30:50,00:30:53,"into this amazing, really pretty transparent window material."
00:30:53,00:30:54,It's stunning.
00:30:54,00:30:55,- So cool.
00:30:55,00:30:56,- And is it incredibly strong?
00:30:56,00:30:57,Is that how it's survived this lot?
00:30:57,00:30:58,"- Oh, no."
00:30:58,00:31:00,"- Okay, so that makes it all the more amazing"
00:31:00,00:31:01,"that we've still got it, right?"
00:31:01,00:31:02,- It's not only not--
00:31:02,00:31:03,"I mean, it's decent."
00:31:03,00:31:06,"You know, glass from the time is not incredibly strong either."
00:31:06,00:31:08,"And until the 18th century,"
00:31:08,00:31:10,cow horn was used largely for translucent sheets
00:31:10,00:31:12,"to go into, like, lanterns."
00:31:12,00:31:14,"The word ""lantan"" comes from lanthorn, you know,"
00:31:14,00:31:15,'cause it would have horn--
00:31:15,00:31:16,- That's it.
00:31:16,00:31:17,- The sides of it were horn.
00:31:17,00:31:18,- I don't think it does.
00:31:18,00:31:19,"I think, 'cause I was like,"
00:31:19,00:31:22,"""That's why they always spell it weird in old books."""
00:31:22,00:31:24,"'Cause obviously, you know, you read old, like,"
00:31:24,00:31:25,"Shakespeare will say it, ""lanthorn."""
00:31:25,00:31:26,"In the old 19th century novels,"
00:31:26,00:31:27,sometimes you see lanthorn.
00:31:27,00:31:28,"So I was like, ""That explains it."""
00:31:28,00:31:31,"But actually, lantern just comes from Latin,"
00:31:31,00:31:32,"like, meaning light."
00:31:32,00:31:35,But people then did the old got confused.
00:31:35,00:31:38,Lots of their lanterns were made out of horn.
00:31:38,00:31:40,"So they went, ""Should we shove a horn on the end?"""
00:31:40,00:31:42,And I read a quite annoyed encyclopedia entry
00:31:42,00:31:45,"from about 1803, saying lanthorn"
00:31:45,00:31:48,is a completely incorrect spelling of this
00:31:48,00:31:49,based on the misconception.
00:31:49,00:31:51,So that's just the idiots from the 18th century.
00:31:51,00:31:52,- But it is based on the fact
00:31:52,00:31:53,that lanterns were made of horn.
00:31:53,00:31:54,"- Absolutely, yeah."
00:31:54,00:31:55,- Which they were.
00:31:55,00:31:56,"- Yeah, right, yeah, yeah."
00:31:56,00:31:57,- That's really interesting.
00:31:57,00:31:57,- It's so cool.
00:31:57,00:31:59,"I mean, basically, in the 15th century,"
00:31:59,00:32:01,they had the equivalent of laminated menus.
00:32:01,00:32:03,There were the horn books that students would use
00:32:03,00:32:05,where they would have all the alphabet on it.
00:32:05,00:32:06,"You've got, like, wooden frames"
00:32:06,00:32:08,where you've got horn that's written on
00:32:08,00:32:10,with the alphabet to learn from and things like that.
00:32:10,00:32:11,But you've also got ancient books
00:32:11,00:32:14,which have a square of horn on the front
00:32:14,00:32:15,"to protect what's beneath,"
00:32:15,00:32:17,like a very valuable old bit of parchment
00:32:17,00:32:19,or vellum or whatever.
00:32:19,00:32:20,So the horn window covers that.
00:32:20,00:32:22,But it's quite delicious for insects.
00:32:22,00:32:23,So a lot of the very old ones
00:32:23,00:32:25,are just nibbled away at all around the edges.
00:32:25,00:32:27,- The alphabet books that Dan was talking about
00:32:27,00:32:29,are called horn books.
00:32:29,00:32:34,"And the horn book is also the title of a book from 1889,"
00:32:34,00:32:36,which is thought of as the principal work
00:32:36,00:32:38,on sex technique in the English language.
00:32:38,00:32:39,"- Oh, good Lord."
00:32:39,00:32:41,- It's basically 1889.
00:32:41,00:32:42,- I didn't think.
00:32:42,00:32:43,- Yeah?
00:32:43,00:32:44,- I didn't think they had that then.
00:32:44,00:32:45,"- Well, that's why it's interesting."
00:32:45,00:32:48,Where do you think your great-great-great-great-great-great-grandmother
00:32:48,00:32:49,came from?
00:32:49,00:32:49,(laughing)
00:32:49,00:32:51,"So it's like the Kamasutra, basically,"
00:32:51,00:32:53,but for Victorian England.
00:32:53,00:32:53,- Wow.
00:32:53,00:32:54,- And they had sex techniques.
00:32:54,00:32:57,"Number one, The Ordinary."
00:32:57,00:32:58,(laughing)
00:32:58,00:32:59,- End of book.
00:32:59,00:33:01,(laughing)
00:33:01,00:33:02,- What was that then?
00:33:02,00:33:03,Was that actually in 1888?
00:33:03,00:33:07,That was upside down and back to front.
00:33:07,00:33:08,- Here's some more.
00:33:08,00:33:10,"Number five, The St. George."
00:33:10,00:33:12,(laughing)
00:33:12,00:33:14,"- What, 'cause you're sort of prodding a dragon."
00:33:14,00:33:15,(laughing)
00:33:15,00:33:18,"- Number nine, The View of the Low Countries."
00:33:18,00:33:20,"- Oh, that is good."
00:33:20,00:33:22,"- Number 48, Waste Not Want Not."
00:33:22,00:33:23,"- Oh, dear."
00:33:23,00:33:27,"- And number 63, The Sack of Corn, Backwards."
00:33:27,00:33:28,- Wow.
00:33:28,00:33:29,(laughing)
00:33:29,00:33:31,"- None of these say much about the people involved,"
00:33:31,00:33:32,do they?
00:33:32,00:33:33,- No.
00:33:33,00:33:34,- There's much more.
00:33:34,00:33:35,"- Wait, what was the connection to horn, sorry?"
00:33:35,00:33:36,- It's called the horn book.
00:33:36,00:33:37,"- Oh, that's it, sorry."
00:33:37,00:33:39,"- It's like, if you Google, I'm just warning people,"
00:33:39,00:33:42,"if they Google horn books to get these alphabet books,"
00:33:42,00:33:43,they might accidentally get this one.
00:33:43,00:33:46,- Do be careful if you're on horn.com.
00:33:46,00:33:49,(laughing)
00:33:49,00:33:51,"- There's a cleaner horn book fact, which I quite liked,"
00:33:51,00:33:54,"which was a poem was written in 1622,"
00:33:54,00:33:57,"which said, 'cause they were the thing you went to"
00:33:57,00:33:59,"for your learning your first letters, and it read,"
00:33:59,00:34:02,"""Even so, the horn book is the seed and grain"
00:34:02,00:34:05,"of skill by which we learning first obtain,"
00:34:05,00:34:08,"and it was written by William Hornby."""
00:34:08,00:34:09,"- Oh, that's really good."
00:34:09,00:34:11,Can I give you another one like that?
00:34:11,00:34:12,- Please.
00:34:12,00:34:15,- The largest brothel in Europe is situated on Horn Street.
00:34:15,00:34:16,- Okay.
00:34:16,00:34:16,- Is it?
00:34:16,00:34:17,- Yeah.
00:34:17,00:34:18,- I was trying to raise the tone.
00:34:18,00:34:20,"- Well, it's gone straight back down again."
00:34:20,00:34:25,"It's in Cologne, and it has 120 sex workers working there,"
00:34:25,00:34:27,and it was Europe's first high-rise brothel.
00:34:27,00:34:29,- But how many of the customers are going looking
00:34:29,00:34:31,for alphabet books for their kids?
00:34:31,00:34:32,"- Most of them, yeah."
00:34:32,00:34:33,- I think the architectural thing
00:34:33,00:34:34,"is not the interesting thing there,"
00:34:34,00:34:38,"as I've stayed in the largest hotel in Thessaloniki,"
00:34:38,00:34:39,and it's not a guarantee of quality.
00:34:39,00:34:44,"It turns out, when you just say Europe's largest brothel,"
00:34:44,00:34:45,it doesn't mean best.
00:34:45,00:34:46,- That's true.
00:34:46,00:34:47,"- Oh, my God."
00:34:47,00:34:50,- They basically had a red light district in the town center
00:34:50,00:34:51,and decided to do away with it
00:34:51,00:34:54,and get this huge multi-storey building and stuff.
00:34:54,00:34:55,- Right.
00:34:55,00:34:58,- And it advertises money-back guarantee
00:34:58,00:35:00,in the case of unsatisfactory service.
00:35:00,00:35:01,- No.
00:35:01,00:35:02,- Yeah.
00:35:02,00:35:04,"- It's so awkward to complain, isn't it?"
00:35:04,00:35:06,- The sack of corn wasn't backwards at all.
00:35:06,00:35:09,(all laughing)
00:35:09,00:35:12,Have you guys heard of the worshipful company of Horner's?
00:35:12,00:35:14,"- Yes, I know someone who's connected."
00:35:14,00:35:15,- Get out.
00:35:15,00:35:16,"- Well, 'cause London has all these guilds,"
00:35:16,00:35:18,"which are the worshipful company of,"
00:35:18,00:35:20,and then you insert very old-fashioned trade.
00:35:20,00:35:24,"- So this is the thing, it dates back to 1284,"
00:35:24,00:35:28,"and it was a guild for people who worked with horn people,"
00:35:28,00:35:29,"and it was a huge business at the time, obviously,"
00:35:29,00:35:31,'cause all the people needed lanterns and windows
00:35:31,00:35:34,"and horn books and other uses of horn, there are thousands."
00:35:34,00:35:37,"Now, they declined, obviously, when pesky glass,"
00:35:37,00:35:41,"stupid glass, took over the window industry,"
00:35:41,00:35:44,"and they were in the doldrums for centuries,"
00:35:44,00:35:45,"but they came back,"
00:35:45,00:35:49,and he guesses what they sort of re-imagined themselves as.
00:35:49,00:35:50,"- Oh, buglers."
00:35:50,00:35:52,"- It's not buglers, though."
00:35:52,00:35:55,They just can't get enough buglers through the door.
00:35:55,00:35:58,"- I'm just thinking, like, if they're still called the Horner's."
00:35:58,00:35:59,"- They're still called the Horner's,"
00:35:59,00:36:01,but they took on another industry
00:36:01,00:36:02,related to what they did in the first place.
00:36:02,00:36:04,"- I read this early today,"
00:36:04,00:36:06,"and I just couldn't believe I never made the connection,"
00:36:06,00:36:08,but shoehorns are made of horn.
00:36:08,00:36:10,"- It wasn't, yes, that's true."
00:36:10,00:36:13,That's not the gigantic industry they put on.
00:36:13,00:36:15,"- Come on, globally, everyone's got a shoehorn."
00:36:15,00:36:16,- Absolutely.
00:36:16,00:36:18,- Is it microchips?
00:36:18,00:36:22,"- No, it's plastics."
00:36:22,00:36:23,"- Oh, right."
00:36:23,00:36:24,- Horn was the original plastic.
00:36:24,00:36:26,"You heat it, you can mold it."
00:36:26,00:36:28,"So these days, all the members"
00:36:28,00:36:29,of the worshipful company of Horner's
00:36:29,00:36:31,"are from the city, from the plastics industry."
00:36:31,00:36:35,They sponsor the Polymer Apprentice of the Year Award.
00:36:35,00:36:36,Big deal in plastics.
00:36:36,00:36:38,"- It's huge, it's a scout badge."
00:36:38,00:36:39,"- Yeah, that's amazing."
00:36:39,00:36:40,"- Yeah, that's really cool."
00:36:40,00:36:42,- Do you know that actually being a Horner
00:36:42,00:36:44,is pretty tricky today?
00:36:44,00:36:45,- Is it?
00:36:45,00:36:46,"- If you're a true Horner,"
00:36:46,00:36:48,"not one of these plastic people,"
00:36:48,00:36:51,"but you're a person who wants to make things out of horn,"
00:36:51,00:36:54,it is difficult because of breeding
00:36:54,00:36:56,and modern farming and feeding
00:36:56,00:36:59,has changed what horns are like.
00:36:59,00:37:01,So the material is not as good for molding
00:37:01,00:37:02,as it used to be.
00:37:02,00:37:05,And it'll quite often retain what they call its memory.
00:37:05,00:37:07,So you kind of flatten it
00:37:07,00:37:09,"and then you put it into whatever shape you want it to be,"
00:37:09,00:37:12,but it kind of remembers that it was horn shaped before
00:37:12,00:37:13,and you can't get it flat properly.
00:37:13,00:37:16,- You come down to your new car window
00:37:16,00:37:18,and it's just back in the shape of a cow horn.
00:37:18,00:37:21,"- It's a cow there instead, you ride it to work."
00:37:21,00:37:23,"- So did you read about the Abbey horn, horn works?"
00:37:23,00:37:24,- Go for it.
00:37:24,00:37:26,"- We've said the word horn so much, I just love it."
00:37:26,00:37:27,"Anyway, sorry, it's on the edge of the lake district."
00:37:27,00:37:30,It's the only horn works left in the UK.
00:37:30,00:37:32,'Cause it's an endangered craft these days
00:37:32,00:37:34,'cause there are only about 10 to 20 horn workers left.
00:37:34,00:37:37,And I think most of them work at Abbey horn.
00:37:37,00:37:39,It's been there for nearly 300 years
00:37:39,00:37:41,and you can get some bloody good stuff there.
00:37:41,00:37:42,I was going through the website
00:37:42,00:37:44,"and just, you get a horn moustache brush,"
00:37:44,00:37:47,"some bloody good shoe horns, Dan, you'd love it."
00:37:47,00:37:48,"- Okay, send me that link."
00:37:48,00:37:50,- Some absolute foot long monsters.
00:37:50,00:37:51,"And actually, James, as you were saying,"
00:37:51,00:37:52,"'cause horn has changed,"
00:37:52,00:37:55,"they get some of those from like,"
00:37:55,00:37:57,I think it's African cattle called the ankle
00:37:57,00:37:59,'cause they have massive great horns.
00:37:59,00:38:01,And you might wanna buy it at the novelty drinking horn
00:38:01,00:38:03,if your partner is into being a Viking or whatever.
00:38:03,00:38:04,- How is it?
00:38:04,00:38:06,Are you allowed to buy and sell this kind of horn
00:38:06,00:38:09,compared to obviously ivory you're not allowed to
00:38:09,00:38:11,and lots of other rhino horns you can't.
00:38:11,00:38:12,"- It's fine, it is fine."
00:38:12,00:38:15,Because all of these cattle that they're buying the horns of
00:38:15,00:38:16,were bred for farming
00:38:16,00:38:20,and they certainly weren't killed for their horns.
00:38:20,00:38:23,"- On drinking horns, obviously a huge use of horn."
00:38:23,00:38:25,And Vikings really did massively popularize them.
00:38:25,00:38:28,"It was kind of the Vikings that brought them to the UK,"
00:38:28,00:38:30,although they'd been used before.
00:38:30,00:38:33,But did you know that they also bought
00:38:33,00:38:37,such a drinking culture that got so bad by the 10th century
00:38:37,00:38:40,"that King Edgar, who you all know,"
00:38:40,00:38:42,"it was the late 10th century English king,"
00:38:42,00:38:46,said that every village had to be limited to one ale house
00:38:46,00:38:49,and every single drinking horn that any punter drank out of
00:38:49,00:38:52,"had to have pins inserted at certain levels,"
00:38:52,00:38:54,it's a bit like you have measures on cups a day.
00:38:54,00:38:57,And whoever drank beyond those intervals in one week
00:38:57,00:38:58,had to be severely punished.
00:38:58,00:38:59,- Whoa. - Right.
00:38:59,00:39:01,- Which is a tough to monitor as a bar person.
00:39:01,00:39:02,"- Policing that, yeah."
00:39:02,00:39:03,(laughing)
00:39:03,00:39:05,"But is it because it's a little bit of a drinking culture,"
00:39:05,00:39:07,"I think, because you can't put it down."
00:39:07,00:39:08,"- Yeah, that's the idea."
00:39:08,00:39:11,- It's like a cocktail party where there's no table.
00:39:11,00:39:12,It's a nightmare.
00:39:12,00:39:14,You fill up your horn and you just stuck around holding it.
00:39:14,00:39:17,"- Yeah, I must say the Vikings coming to Northern England"
00:39:17,00:39:21,in the 10th century is just like you going to a cocktail party.
00:39:21,00:39:22,- There's no to put it down.
00:39:22,00:39:23,And often you lose track of your own horn.
00:39:23,00:39:25,And what's good is to put a little hairband
00:39:25,00:39:26,around your own horn.
00:39:26,00:39:27,(laughing)
00:39:27,00:39:29,"- Well, you're the only one who comes with a horn holder"
00:39:29,00:39:32,"to make sure you can put it down between sits, so."
00:39:32,00:39:35,- Can you think of another use of the word horning
00:39:35,00:39:37,to be horned?
00:39:37,00:39:40,"- Oh, I'm thinking of horning in on a situation."
00:39:40,00:39:41,"- Oh, like horning in."
00:39:41,00:39:43,"- No, it's sort of where you interrupt."
00:39:43,00:39:46,"Oh, here Anna comes horning in on our conversation."
00:39:46,00:39:48,- Oh yeah. - Whatever.
00:39:48,00:39:48,"- No, not that."
00:39:48,00:39:51,This is in a kind of sport.
00:39:51,00:39:53,- A very old-fashioned European sport.
00:39:53,00:39:57,- Marrying the Habsburg Queen.
00:39:57,00:40:01,"- That's a sport, very good."
00:40:01,00:40:03,"No, it's in bullfighting."
00:40:03,00:40:05,It's when you get gored by a bull.
00:40:05,00:40:08,"It's called, it's known as a horning."
00:40:08,00:40:09,- It's been a horning in the morning.
00:40:09,00:40:10,- Yes.
00:40:10,00:40:13,- Morning horning would be a good royal rumble thing
00:40:13,00:40:13,for bullfighting.
00:40:13,00:40:15,"Just in case the bullfighting people are listening,"
00:40:15,00:40:16,wanting to rev it up a bit.
00:40:16,00:40:19,- The record for most hornings
00:40:19,00:40:21,"is by a guy called Antonio Barrera,"
00:40:21,00:40:23,who has been horned 23 times.
00:40:23,00:40:25,- Is that a good record?
00:40:25,00:40:26,Do you want that guy on your team?
00:40:26,00:40:27,"- The guy from Guinness is saying,"
00:40:27,00:40:29,"""I'm so sorry, I missed the 16th morning,"
00:40:29,00:40:31,"""so we're not gonna gather a record."""
00:40:31,00:40:33,"- Wait, how many of those were the same occasion?"
00:40:33,00:40:34,- They were all different occasions.
00:40:34,00:40:36,"- Oh, blimey."
00:40:36,00:40:39,- The most common place to be horned by bull.
00:40:39,00:40:40,"- Spain, I imagine."
00:40:40,00:40:45,- Are you a buddy?
00:40:45,00:40:46,- That'll be in Boston.
00:40:46,00:40:47,- In the ring. - Is he running away?
00:40:47,00:40:50,"- In the ring, now in the upper leg."
00:40:50,00:40:53,And second place is the perineal area.
00:40:53,00:40:54,"- Second most popular, that's a show."
00:40:54,00:40:55,Do they have guards?
00:40:55,00:40:56,Do they wear boxes?
00:40:56,00:40:57,"- No, they don't."
00:40:57,00:40:58,- Bullfighters.
00:40:58,00:41:01,"- No, no, they were very tight trousers, don't they?"
00:41:01,00:41:02,- If only there was some system
00:41:02,00:41:05,"where there could be some kind of clown in the ring,"
00:41:05,00:41:07,who was able to distract the attention of the bull.
00:41:07,00:41:09,"- Well, some rodeo clown idiot."
00:41:09,00:41:11,"- I guess you'd call them that, yeah."
00:41:11,00:41:14,Have you heard of the German island of Borkum?
00:41:14,00:41:15,- No.
00:41:15,00:41:17,- This is a place that has a Christmas festival
00:41:17,00:41:19,"called Klassholm, right?"
00:41:19,00:41:20,Or Klassholm.
00:41:20,00:41:23,"And they had this tradition for many, many years there"
00:41:23,00:41:25,where men dress up in elaborate costumes
00:41:25,00:41:28,and spank women with cow horns on the bottom.
00:41:28,00:41:30,And this led to controversy recently
00:41:30,00:41:32,"because a lot of the women said,"
00:41:32,00:41:33,"actually, we really don't like this."
00:41:33,00:41:35,- Stop using the pointy end.
00:41:35,00:41:37,"- Well, I mean, we don't like being spanked,"
00:41:37,00:41:38,"or, you know, we're being spanked without permission"
00:41:38,00:41:39,on Christmas.
00:41:39,00:41:41,But last year there was a huge crackdown
00:41:41,00:41:43,on cow horns spanking on Borkum.
00:41:43,00:41:45,And it passed without any spanking
00:41:45,00:41:46,and without any complaints.
00:41:46,00:41:48,Certainly without any complaints.
00:41:48,00:41:50,There may have been private consensual cow horns spanking.
00:41:50,00:41:51,- I think that's fine.
00:41:51,00:41:52,- Absolutely.
00:41:52,00:41:54,"And in fact, when there was this big protest,"
00:41:54,00:41:54,"like loads of the women saying,"
00:41:54,00:41:56,can you stop hitting us with cow horns on the bum
00:41:56,00:41:57,every Christmas?
00:41:57,00:41:58,This is not fun.
00:41:58,00:42:00,A couple of hundred women did launch a counter protest
00:42:00,00:42:01,"saying, we love it."
00:42:01,00:42:03,It's our way of life.
00:42:03,00:42:04,This is our tradition.
00:42:04,00:42:07,So there's definitely debate.
00:42:07,00:42:08,"But for the moment,"
00:42:08,00:42:12,it appears that the involuntary cow horns spanking is over.
00:42:12,00:42:14,Why don't the women just spank the men back?
00:42:14,00:42:16,"Or, I'm sorry, is that the Daily Mail comments"
00:42:16,00:42:17,coming out again?
00:42:17,00:42:19,(laughing)
00:42:19,00:42:20,- I think that takes the fun out of it.
00:42:20,00:42:21,It's like giving someone a wedgie.
00:42:21,00:42:23,"It's not as fun giving someone a wedgie, is it?"
00:42:23,00:42:24,"If you have to say beforehand,"
00:42:24,00:42:25,is it okay if I give you a wedgie?
00:42:25,00:42:26,"- Are we saying, Anna,"
00:42:26,00:42:28,that consent takes the fun out of things?
00:42:28,00:42:32,'Cause I do think we're on thin ice.
00:42:32,00:42:33,(laughing)
00:42:33,00:42:36,(upbeat music)
00:42:36,00:42:40,"- Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show."
00:42:40,00:42:42,And that is Anna.
00:42:42,00:42:44,My fact this week is that Jack Kerouac
00:42:44,00:42:48,wrote his most famous novel on one long scroll.
00:42:48,00:42:50,- Was it sold in scroll form ever?
00:42:50,00:42:51,- Yeah.
00:42:51,00:42:53,"- The audio box started, oh, yay, oh, yay."
00:42:53,00:42:55,(laughing)
00:42:55,00:42:57,- That's an interesting question.
00:42:57,00:43:00,"It sort of is today, but not at the time."
00:43:00,00:43:03,"- It has, as in that scroll has been sold."
00:43:03,00:43:05,"- I think, yeah, that scroll, you're right."
00:43:05,00:43:06,You can go and visit it.
00:43:06,00:43:08,"I can't remember what, it's in a museum somewhere."
00:43:08,00:43:10,"- It's owned by, or it was owned."
00:43:10,00:43:11,"Unfortunately, he died this year."
00:43:11,00:43:13,"Jim Erse, who owns the Indianapolis Colts"
00:43:13,00:43:14,American football team.
00:43:14,00:43:15,- Okay.
00:43:15,00:43:16,- Yeah.
00:43:16,00:43:18,"- Obviously, that's where it, who it would be owned by."
00:43:18,00:43:19,(laughing)
00:43:19,00:43:21,"- Yeah, no, he's a big, maybe we'll talk about it later."
00:43:21,00:43:22,Let's get into the fact that he was a huge collector
00:43:22,00:43:23,of this guy.
00:43:23,00:43:24,"- Oh, cool."
00:43:24,00:43:27,"- Yeah, I've got a big old list of other cool things he has."
00:43:27,00:43:29,"- All right, well, excited to skip ahead to that."
00:43:29,00:43:32,"But first of all, Jack Kerouac."
00:43:32,00:43:34,"Yeah, he wrote on a long scroll"
00:43:34,00:43:35,and basically he got annoyed
00:43:35,00:43:37,'cause he was a writer who typed very fast
00:43:37,00:43:39,and it all came flowing through him
00:43:39,00:43:41,and out of his fingertips.
00:43:41,00:43:43,And he thought you should never have to pause or stop
00:43:43,00:43:44,or have your flow interrupted.
00:43:44,00:43:47,"- Or think, or think at all about the next sentence."
00:43:47,00:43:50,"Maybe I'll put a main verb in this one, that kind of stuff."
00:43:50,00:43:51,Why would you think about the next sentence
00:43:51,00:43:53,considering it's about five pages away?
00:43:53,00:43:55,(laughing)
00:43:55,00:43:57,"Which we should say if you read any Jack Kerouac,"
00:43:57,00:43:59,it is very stream of consciousness.
00:43:59,00:44:00,- Yes.
00:44:00,00:44:01,- It's interesting.
00:44:01,00:44:02,Maybe we'll also get into a big debate
00:44:02,00:44:03,of who likes his style and who doesn't.
00:44:03,00:44:07,I think I know around this table who's gonna be the fan.
00:44:07,00:44:10,But he didn't like to reload his typewriter
00:44:10,00:44:11,with bits of paper.
00:44:11,00:44:13,So he got this massive scroll.
00:44:13,00:44:14,"It was made of like teletype paper,"
00:44:14,00:44:17,"kind of like tracing paper, thick tracing paper."
00:44:17,00:44:18,And he taped it all together.
00:44:18,00:44:21,And then he made a 120 foot long scroll.
00:44:21,00:44:24,This was in 1951 and he was writing on the road.
00:44:24,00:44:27,- That was the name of the book.
00:44:27,00:44:28,- Sorry.
00:44:28,00:44:29,"- Sorry, yeah."
00:44:29,00:44:32,"He was writing in his bedroom, but on the road."
00:44:32,00:44:35,"And when he was finished, he marched into his editor's office"
00:44:35,00:44:37,who was a guy called Robert Giroux.
00:44:37,00:44:40,And he was unspun the scroll across the floor
00:44:40,00:44:42,like you would unroll a rug.
00:44:42,00:44:43,"And Giroux just said,"
00:44:43,00:44:46,"Jack, don't you realize that's not how authors"
00:44:46,00:44:47,present manuscripts?
00:44:47,00:44:48,I can't do anything with this.
00:44:48,00:44:49,Take it away.
00:44:49,00:44:50,- I think he did know
00:44:50,00:44:51,that that's not how you present manuscripts.
00:44:51,00:44:54,"Also, it is often presented as if he did the stream"
00:44:54,00:44:56,of consciousness he handed it over.
00:44:56,00:44:57,And that's it.
00:44:57,00:44:57,That's not the case.
00:44:57,00:44:59,He spent years and years editing it.
00:44:59,00:45:01,It's a very highly edited document.
00:45:01,00:45:04,"- Not that it seems like it, but yeah."
00:45:04,00:45:05,- Should we say who Jack Kerouac is?
00:45:05,00:45:08,"Briefly, like American part of the beat generation,"
00:45:08,00:45:11,post-war counter-cultural writers
00:45:11,00:45:14,who were rebelling against the way America was.
00:45:14,00:45:16,"You know, that was the basic movement."
00:45:16,00:45:19,"And Jack Kerouac was a huge part of it with On the Road,"
00:45:19,00:45:21,"which is extremely famous, you know?"
00:45:21,00:45:22,- Yeah.
00:45:22,00:45:24,And what's interesting is he influenced a lot
00:45:24,00:45:26,"of these people like Ken Kessie,"
00:45:26,00:45:28,"who wrote One Flew the Cuckoo's Nest,"
00:45:28,00:45:30,"Alan Ginsberg, the poet."
00:45:30,00:45:31,- William Burroughs.
00:45:31,00:45:33,"- Yeah, if he gave the name to William Burroughs'"
00:45:33,00:45:35,"probably most famous novel, Naked Lunch."
00:45:35,00:45:37,That was something that he came up with.
00:45:37,00:45:38,"But when he wrote On the Road,"
00:45:38,00:45:41,he did spend all those years trying to get it published
00:45:41,00:45:42,and editing it.
00:45:42,00:45:44,"And in the meantime, everyone who was influenced"
00:45:44,00:45:46,by reading copies of it got their own stuff published.
00:45:46,00:45:49,"So it ended up looking like Kerouac was copying off them,"
00:45:49,00:45:52,when in fact he was the influence for this whole generation.
00:45:52,00:45:54,"- Yes, 'cause it only ended up being published in 1957,"
00:45:54,00:45:55,we should say.
00:45:55,00:45:57,So he proposed it in 1951.
00:45:57,00:45:59,"The editor said, ""Take it away and tie it into a proper book."""
00:45:59,00:46:02,And so he then did type it out on normal pages.
00:46:02,00:46:03,But no one would take it.
00:46:03,00:46:04,"All the publishers said,"
00:46:04,00:46:06,"""We think this is kind of a work of genius,"
00:46:06,00:46:08,"""but no one's gonna care about the subject matter."""
00:46:08,00:46:10,- And the subject matter is?
00:46:10,00:46:12,- It's basically a big old road trip.
00:46:12,00:46:14,"It's none of his books and novels,"
00:46:14,00:46:15,"and I hate it when people refer to them as that,"
00:46:15,00:46:18,'cause they're all completely true to his own life.
00:46:18,00:46:20,"They're his autobiography, basically."
00:46:20,00:46:21,And this was a bit of work.
00:46:21,00:46:22,"- They're exaggerated autobiographies, aren't they?"
00:46:22,00:46:25,"- Yeah, so it's him traveling around with his mates."
00:46:25,00:46:27,"And they all put each other in each other's books,"
00:46:27,00:46:30,"don't they, Ginsberg does and Burroughs does."
00:46:30,00:46:32,"He also, incidentally, named Ginsberg's most famous book,"
00:46:32,00:46:33,Howl.
00:46:33,00:46:35,So he named the three most famous books
00:46:35,00:46:36,of the B-generation.
00:46:36,00:46:38,- His real skill was naming books.
00:46:38,00:46:40,(all laughing)
00:46:40,00:46:41,"- All these books that he did,"
00:46:41,00:46:45,"which were semi-autobiographical and with all his mates in,"
00:46:45,00:46:48,the liars of his publishers made him change all the names
00:46:48,00:46:49,for obvious reasons.
00:46:49,00:46:51,There was lots of stuff happening in those books
00:46:51,00:46:54,that they might object to.
00:46:54,00:46:57,"But Kerouac's intention was towards the end of his life,"
00:46:57,00:46:59,"he was gonna get all of his old books,"
00:46:59,00:47:00,and he was gonna republish them all
00:47:00,00:47:04,"as one enormous scroll from start to finish,"
00:47:04,00:47:05,but then change all the names back
00:47:05,00:47:07,so that we got all the people's names out.
00:47:07,00:47:08,"- Oh, that's good."
00:47:08,00:47:09,"- But then he died quite young, I think."
00:47:09,00:47:11,"- He died really, yeah, he died in the late 60s."
00:47:11,00:47:13,"- Sorry, can I just say that has been done now,"
00:47:13,00:47:15,"just to make sense of what I said earlier,"
00:47:15,00:47:17,I think Viking Press in about 2011
00:47:17,00:47:19,"released the original scroll,"
00:47:19,00:47:21,"which is with all the original names,"
00:47:21,00:47:23,and it's with no paragraph breaks and written--
00:47:23,00:47:25,"- I've got it at home, it's a beast of a book."
00:47:25,00:47:28,"I haven't read it, I mean, just no way, but it's--"
00:47:28,00:47:30,"- And there you go, that's the fan reveal."
00:47:30,00:47:31,"- But I'm a fan of the counterculture,"
00:47:31,00:47:33,"I've not actually read Kerouac,"
00:47:33,00:47:35,because it's a difficult read.
00:47:35,00:47:37,"- Yeah, a stream of consciousness is harder."
00:47:37,00:47:39,Can I give you one more version of that meeting
00:47:39,00:47:42,"with Robert Giroux, who was one of his previous editors,"
00:47:42,00:47:45,and then he'd written short stories and things like that.
00:47:45,00:47:47,"He turns up at the office with the manuscript,"
00:47:47,00:47:50,"with the scroll, throws it on the floor,"
00:47:50,00:47:52,and this is according to Robert Giroux.
00:47:52,00:47:55,"He was very excited, this is Kerouac, I think he was high."
00:47:55,00:47:57,"Anyway, I bent down to look at the thing,"
00:47:57,00:47:59,"and after a few moments, I looked up and said,"
00:47:59,00:48:01,"""Well, Jack, this is going to have to be cut up"
00:48:01,00:48:03,"""into pages and edited and so on."""
00:48:03,00:48:05,"Jack just looked at me and his face had darkened,"
00:48:05,00:48:07,"and he said, ""There'll be no editing."
00:48:07,00:48:10,"""This book was dictated by the Holy Ghost."""
00:48:10,00:48:13,And the book then went to a different publisher.
00:48:13,00:48:15,(laughing)
00:48:15,00:48:16,"- You met him on a dating site, didn't you?"
00:48:16,00:48:18,(laughing)
00:48:18,00:48:21,"- Yeah, I think he was off his face quite a lot."
00:48:21,00:48:21,"- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:48:21,00:48:24,"- He was on Ben Zatrin when he did this,"
00:48:24,00:48:25,which is an amphetamine that a lot of people were on
00:48:25,00:48:26,at the time.
00:48:26,00:48:30,"It was like a nasal spray, like a kind of pseudo Fred thing,"
00:48:30,00:48:33,"but then it made everyone, gave lots of people lots of energy"
00:48:33,00:48:35,'cause it's basically amphetamines.
00:48:35,00:48:37,"- It's not very cool though, is it?"
00:48:37,00:48:38,It's not like-- - It's not cool now.
00:48:38,00:48:41,- The jazz guys trying to find a new vein for the horse.
00:48:41,00:48:43,"It's like, if it's a nasal spray,"
00:48:43,00:48:45,I do think that's an uncool administration
00:48:45,00:48:46,for a mind-altering drug.
00:48:46,00:48:49,"- Yeah, I guess so, but it was cool at the time."
00:48:49,00:48:50,- Yeah.
00:48:50,00:48:52,- And then it kind of did go out of fashion.
00:48:52,00:48:55,- And he went out of fashion within his own circle as well.
00:48:55,00:48:56,That's one of the tragic things.
00:48:56,00:48:59,"But he did die young, I think he was 47 when he died."
00:48:59,00:49:01,"And even his friends, his closest friends,"
00:49:01,00:49:05,"like Alan Ginsberg, didn't want to know him at that point."
00:49:05,00:49:08,He had turned from this amazingly magnetic character
00:49:08,00:49:11,that basically defined this whole movement
00:49:11,00:49:13,"to someone who became very bitter, very angry."
00:49:13,00:49:17,- He used to write newspapers about Boy Scout badges changing.
00:49:17,00:49:18,They got quite right-winged in the end.
00:49:18,00:49:20,He was always quite racist.
00:49:20,00:49:22,"- But those letters to the newspapers,"
00:49:22,00:49:24,"they were so long, they couldn't get in."
00:49:24,00:49:26,"- They were all on little scrolls, so sad."
00:49:26,00:49:28,"You know, the original On The Road,"
00:49:28,00:49:30,a dog ate part of his homework?
00:49:30,00:49:31,- Yes.
00:49:31,00:49:32,"- Yeah, genuinely."
00:49:32,00:49:33,- Really.
00:49:33,00:49:34,"- It was auctioned some years ago,"
00:49:34,00:49:37,"and the condition notes noted that the final 25 pages,"
00:49:37,00:49:39,"or equivalent of, had been chewed and torn away"
00:49:39,00:49:41,by a dog belonging to Kerouac's friend
00:49:41,00:49:43,"in April or May, 1951."
00:49:43,00:49:44,- But the thing is that no one who read it
00:49:44,00:49:46,"ever got up to the last 25 pages,"
00:49:46,00:49:48,so no one ever noticed.
00:49:48,00:49:51,"- On The Road was published in 1957, was a huge hit."
00:49:51,00:49:53,And immediately he couldn't handle it.
00:49:53,00:49:55,"He just like, he sort of had a breakdown."
00:49:55,00:49:57,His publisher said he ended up like lying
00:49:57,00:49:58,"on the floor staring at the ceiling,"
00:49:58,00:50:00,"not knowing what to do, became terrible alcoholic."
00:50:00,00:50:03,"- I think we said that he went to a lookout tower,"
00:50:03,00:50:04,didn't he?
00:50:04,00:50:05,Was that after that as well?
00:50:05,00:50:06,"- Oh yes, that's right."
00:50:06,00:50:09,- He kind of just lived on his own for months and months
00:50:09,00:50:11,in the middle of the forest looking for fires.
00:50:11,00:50:12,- Did you find any?
00:50:12,00:50:15,"- No, he didn't, but apparently he did leave behind him"
00:50:15,00:50:19,a column of feces about the height and size of a baby.
00:50:19,00:50:22,"- Why, what an upsetting simile point."
00:50:22,00:50:24,For your column of feces.
00:50:24,00:50:27,"There's so much else you could compare it to,"
00:50:27,00:50:28,like a melon or a melon.
00:50:28,00:50:29,- A melon?
00:50:29,00:50:31,- Melons are smaller than babies.
00:50:31,00:50:31,- How big are your melons?
00:50:31,00:50:34,"- Excuse me, how small are your babies?"
00:50:34,00:50:35,(laughing)
00:50:35,00:50:38,"Alan, we're not getting into motorboats again."
00:50:38,00:50:40,- Do you know the only reason he became so famous
00:50:40,00:50:42,and it all ruined him anyway?
00:50:42,00:50:45,It was because of one review he got in The New York Times.
00:50:45,00:50:47,"So if the review had not been printed,"
00:50:47,00:50:49,he would have probably stayed a small time.
00:50:49,00:50:51,"He was a small time before it came out, right?"
00:50:51,00:50:55,"But the main reviewer, a guy called Orville Prescott,"
00:50:55,00:50:58,"hated him, hated his stuff, but he was away on holiday."
00:50:58,00:51:00,And so there was a different reviewer
00:51:00,00:51:02,who just got drafted in for holiday cover
00:51:02,00:51:04,called Gilbert Milstein.
00:51:04,00:51:06,And he gave it the biggest smash hit review
00:51:06,00:51:07,The New York Times had ever given anything.
00:51:07,00:51:10,"He said, ""It's publication is a historic occasion."
00:51:10,00:51:13,"""The writing is of a beauty almost breathtaking."""
00:51:13,00:51:15,And this gave the book absolute rocket fuel
00:51:15,00:51:17,that made it a huge success.
00:51:17,00:51:19,"Prescott, who was the main guy in charge of reviewing,"
00:51:19,00:51:21,was so angry about this.
00:51:21,00:51:23,He almost didn't allow it to go in.
00:51:23,00:51:25,And then he fired Gilbert Milstein.
00:51:25,00:51:28,He was never hired again to write The New York Times
00:51:28,00:51:30,"because he loved this stream of consciousness,"
00:51:30,00:51:33,"hard to read, beat generation thing."
00:51:33,00:51:34,- Yeah. - Wow.
00:51:34,00:51:35,"- Love it, all you hate it."
00:51:35,00:51:37,"- Well, listen guys, I can hear the audience at home."
00:51:37,00:51:40,"Script, well, I can hear at least my mom screaming."
00:51:40,00:51:43,Tell us about the collection that Jim Ersey had.
00:51:43,00:51:44,"- Ah, yes."
00:51:44,00:51:45,- In which.
00:51:45,00:51:45,- Can we scroll this content?
00:51:45,00:51:46,- Why not tell us who this guy is?
00:51:46,00:51:49,"- So he was the owner of the Colts,"
00:51:49,00:51:50,the football team in America.
00:51:50,00:51:52,And he bought up the scroll.
00:51:52,00:51:54,And it's part of this big traveling collection that he has.
00:51:54,00:51:56,"So he has the big book,"
00:51:56,00:51:59,"the original Alcoholics Anonymous book,"
00:51:59,00:52:01,the first manuscript that was ever written.
00:52:01,00:52:03,"- Oh, I thought you went with everyone's names."
00:52:03,00:52:05,(all laughing)
00:52:05,00:52:08,- It's Alcoholics Not Anonymous.
00:52:08,00:52:10,- That's the Compromat book.
00:52:10,00:52:12,Just one guy is allowed to know who you are.
00:52:12,00:52:15,"- No, this was the original book"
00:52:15,00:52:18,that William or Bill W. Wilson had written.
00:52:18,00:52:20,"- Actually, wasn't that the Holy Ghost"
00:52:20,00:52:21,who gave him that as well?
00:52:21,00:52:22,"- He was, you're right."
00:52:22,00:52:23,"You're right, it was a huge episode"
00:52:23,00:52:24,"for the Holy Ghost, this one."
