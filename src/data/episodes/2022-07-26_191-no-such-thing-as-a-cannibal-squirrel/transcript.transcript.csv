00:00:02,00:00:05,[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
00:00:05,00:00:18,"Hello, and welcome to another episode."
00:00:18,00:00:21,"No such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast this week coming"
00:00:21,00:00:23,to you from the comedia in BAS.
00:00:23,00:00:28,[APPLAUSE]
00:00:28,00:00:29,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:29,00:00:32,"I'm sitting here with Anich Zinski, Andrew Hunter Murray,"
00:00:32,00:00:33,and James Harkin.
00:00:33,00:00:36,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:36,00:00:39,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.
00:00:39,00:00:41,"And in a particular order, here we go,"
00:00:41,00:00:44,"starting with you, James Harkin."
00:00:44,00:00:48,"OK, my fat this week is that it's easier to speak Dutch"
00:00:48,00:00:50,if you're drunk.
00:00:50,00:00:53,"As in, if you're a non-native speaker--"
00:00:53,00:00:56,"Yeah, if you're Dutch--"
00:00:56,00:01:00,you tend not to have too many problems in general if you're Dutch.
00:01:00,00:01:02,And you can't be absolutely hammered.
00:01:02,00:01:06,You have to be very slightly one pint kind of drunk.
00:01:06,00:01:08,And this is a study that's been done recently.
00:01:08,00:01:10,They got 50 native German speakers
00:01:10,00:01:14,to talk to a Dutch person in Dutch.
00:01:14,00:01:16,"And then they recorded it, and they asked some Dutch people"
00:01:16,00:01:18,"afterwards, how did they do?"
00:01:18,00:01:20,And the drunk people did a little bit better.
00:01:20,00:01:22,"But unfortunately, I did read on Reddit."
00:01:22,00:01:25,Someone posted on Reddit that Dutch is basically
00:01:25,00:01:30,like a German got drunk and can't speak properly anymore.
00:01:30,00:01:36,So there's a lot of slurred sounds in this fleshlier leshler.
00:01:36,00:01:37,I didn't know you speak.
00:01:37,00:01:39,And you're not even drinking.
00:01:39,00:01:42,Does anyone hear speak Dutch?
00:01:42,00:01:43,Wow.
00:01:43,00:01:45,No.
00:01:45,00:01:47,"Have another drink, and then see."
00:01:47,00:01:49,Because I wonder if it's slightly by accident
00:01:49,00:01:52,"that when you're drunk, you're just a bit more confident."
00:01:52,00:01:53,And you're saying work-- because they've
00:01:53,00:01:56,had words that are actually quite similar to English.
00:01:56,00:02:01,"So the word for ""apple"" is ""apple."""
00:02:01,00:02:04,"The word for ""pair"" is ""pair."""
00:02:04,00:02:06,"Wait, someone does speak it down there."
00:02:06,00:02:07,Who's saying it?
00:02:07,00:02:09,Or you've gotten what I'm doing now.
00:02:09,00:02:13,He just owns a green grosses in Antwerp.
00:02:13,00:02:14,I think that person has just understood
00:02:14,00:02:18,the admittedly complex joke that you're doing right now.
00:02:18,00:02:21,"But yeah, it wasn't so much remembering the words"
00:02:21,00:02:25,as much as they had better fluency and better pronunciation.
00:02:25,00:02:26,That's what people said.
00:02:26,00:02:27,"And weirdly, the people themselves"
00:02:27,00:02:29,didn't think that they were doing any better.
00:02:29,00:02:31,"You would think, if you're drunk, you have a bit more"
00:02:31,00:02:33,"bravado, but they didn't really have that."
00:02:33,00:02:36,"The people themselves thought, oh, I'm doing OK."
00:02:36,00:02:38,"Well, actually, the Dutch people-- that's amazing."
00:02:38,00:02:41,But Dutch people are so English proficient.
00:02:41,00:02:45,About 90% of people in the Netherlands speak really good English.
00:02:45,00:02:49,So it's quite hard to get conversational with people in Dutch.
00:02:49,00:02:50,I went there earlier this year.
00:02:50,00:02:53,"And as soon as you open your mouth and try to say, hello,"
00:02:53,00:02:55,"or something, you know, Apple."
00:02:55,00:02:57,Yeah.
00:02:57,00:02:59,"You spotted a mile off and they immediately say, oh,"
00:02:59,00:03:00,"hello, how are you doing?"
00:03:00,00:03:01,What would you like?
00:03:01,00:03:02,You want an apple?
00:03:02,00:03:03,Do you want a pink lady or a russet?
00:03:03,00:03:05,And it's very hard to--
00:03:05,00:03:07,"But actually, this study was--"
00:03:07,00:03:09,it was German-speaking Dutch.
00:03:09,00:03:12,"But actually, there was a 1972 study"
00:03:12,00:03:14,in which showed that Americans could speak
00:03:14,00:03:16,tie a bit better if they were a bit drunk.
00:03:16,00:03:17,Really?
00:03:17,00:03:18,Yeah.
00:03:18,00:03:21,I speak Mandarin much better when I'm drunk.
00:03:21,00:03:23,And I do speak Mandarin.
00:03:23,00:03:24,I grew up in Hong Kong.
00:03:24,00:03:27,"And yeah, I do notice that when I'm drunk, I'm just--"
00:03:27,00:03:29,I'm awesome at it.
00:03:29,00:03:30,There's no anecdote with that.
00:03:30,00:03:33,I just want to sort of big up my language-speaking abilities.
00:03:33,00:03:35,Has anyone else ever noticed that about you?
00:03:35,00:03:37,Or is it just that you think they--
00:03:37,00:03:38,"No, I just tell it to people who don't speak Mandarin."
00:03:38,00:03:41,"I'm like, whoa, I am kicking ass right now in my Mandarin."
00:03:41,00:03:43,But I can know-- because I was really bad as a kid.
00:03:43,00:03:46,I was the only kid in my year that when I went back to school
00:03:46,00:03:49,I had forgotten his name in Chinese.
00:03:49,00:03:51,"Oh, God."
00:03:51,00:03:51,So I sat--
00:03:51,00:03:53,Is it your name in Chinese Dandab?
00:03:53,00:03:55,"Oh, yeah, no."
00:03:55,00:03:56,That was my nickname at school.
00:03:56,00:03:57,This is so bad.
00:03:57,00:03:58,I was called-- some of my names Dan.
00:03:58,00:04:00,"Obviously, I was called Dan Dan at school."
00:04:00,00:04:01,"And I thought that was a really cool nickname,"
00:04:01,00:04:03,because everyone knew my nickname.
00:04:03,00:04:04,"And I was like, wow, that's so cool."
00:04:04,00:04:06,"And they'd be like, older kids."
00:04:06,00:04:07,"Hey, Dan Dan."
00:04:07,00:04:08,And I only found out.
00:04:08,00:04:09,It was about six years ago.
00:04:09,00:04:10,I was living in England.
00:04:10,00:04:11,I was in my late 20s.
00:04:11,00:04:15,"And someone on-- I put on Facebook saying,"
00:04:15,00:04:17,Dan Dan just won a game against an old Hong Kong friend
00:04:17,00:04:20,"and someone wrote, ah, Dan Dan, you know that means"
00:04:20,00:04:23,"testicles in Chinese, right?"
00:04:23,00:04:25,And I had no idea.
00:04:25,00:04:26,No one told me.
00:04:26,00:04:29,"I wrote to my friends at school, my old school friends."
00:04:29,00:04:31,"I was like, did you know I was called balls this whole time?"
00:04:31,00:04:35,"And they were like, yeah, did you not know?"
00:04:35,00:04:36,It's a whole childhood.
00:04:36,00:04:37,I thought I was cool.
00:04:37,00:04:39,I was just a boy called balls.
00:04:39,00:04:42,And a boy called balls who forgot his name every holidays.
00:04:42,00:04:43,Yeah.
00:04:43,00:04:45,"And genuinely, I would sit in class."
00:04:45,00:04:46,"And I would be sweating, because they"
00:04:46,00:04:47,be doing the roll call.
00:04:47,00:04:49,"And I'd just go, I have no idea what my name is."
00:04:49,00:04:50,And when it gets to it.
00:04:50,00:04:53,"And then there was one time that I thought my name was Shia Boa,"
00:04:53,00:04:56,"but I thought it was Law Boa, which is Radish."
00:04:56,00:05:01,"So then I just got called Radish Balls or something, I guess, right?"
00:05:01,00:05:01,So it's hard.
00:05:01,00:05:05,So I'm very proud when I get drunk and remember my Mandarin.
00:05:05,00:05:08,I think you remember your name.
00:05:08,00:05:10,I'm always impressed by that.
00:05:10,00:05:13,"But getting drunk can't improve your skills in various ways,"
00:05:13,00:05:14,can't it?
00:05:14,00:05:20,"So the Snooker player, Bill Verbeniuk, how do you say that?"
00:05:20,00:05:21,"Oh, Verbenek."
00:05:21,00:05:25,"Verbenek Verbeniuk, like who's counting?"
00:05:25,00:05:26,He used to get--
00:05:26,00:05:28,That's not for me.
00:05:28,00:05:30,[LAUGHTER]
00:05:30,00:05:31,He used to get really drunk.
00:05:31,00:05:35,So he used to have six to eight points before a match.
00:05:35,00:05:38,And then he would have one during each frame during the match.
00:05:38,00:05:40,And that made him play better.
00:05:40,00:05:41,And everyone does always think that they play a bit better
00:05:41,00:05:43,after a few points.
00:05:43,00:05:46,"After a few, maybe, but not after, how many did you say?"
00:05:46,00:05:47,"Six to eight, before a game."
00:05:47,00:05:48,And not during the game.
00:05:48,00:05:49,How many frames are there?
00:05:49,00:05:50,I'm assuming there must be only about three.
00:05:50,00:05:53,"Well, in the World Championship final,"
00:05:53,00:05:54,"which he never reached, I don't think."
00:05:54,00:05:57,"I think there's like 34 or something, 37."
00:05:57,00:06:02,I can't see why he never reached that stage.
00:06:02,00:06:05,"But also, the world anti-doping agency"
00:06:05,00:06:08,bans alcohol from just five sports.
00:06:08,00:06:10,So bans evening from five sports--
00:06:10,00:06:12,A motor racing.
00:06:12,00:06:14,A motor racing is one of them.
00:06:14,00:06:15,Yes.
00:06:15,00:06:20,"So motor racing powerboating, air sports, auto racing--"
00:06:20,00:06:21,motorcycle racing.
00:06:21,00:06:23,So you can see why it bans drinking in those.
00:06:23,00:06:24,It's a bit dangerous.
00:06:24,00:06:25,And archery.
00:06:25,00:06:27,"And actually, the reason it bans archery"
00:06:27,00:06:29,is that there was a study done in 1985
00:06:29,00:06:30,that found that drinking a little bit
00:06:30,00:06:32,makes you slightly better at archery.
00:06:32,00:06:33,And it's considered cheating.
00:06:33,00:06:35,"Oh, yeah."
00:06:35,00:06:36,Yeah.
00:06:36,00:06:38,"That's why that strong bowl guy is so good, isn't it?"
00:06:38,00:06:41,[LAUGHTER]
00:06:41,00:06:45,"So in 2008, the Dutch voted the word of the year."
00:06:45,00:06:47,"Now, all countries do this."
00:06:47,00:06:49,All lot countries do this every year.
00:06:49,00:06:53,"But in 2008, the word of the year in Dutch was swafflin."
00:06:53,00:06:54,OK.
00:06:54,00:06:55,"And according to Wikipedia, swafflin"
00:06:55,00:06:59,means to hit one's penis often repeatedly
00:06:59,00:07:00,against an object.
00:07:00,00:07:03,[LAUGHTER]
00:07:03,00:07:04,Didn't they start doing that?
00:07:04,00:07:07,"There was a trend for swafflin in the Netherlands, I think."
00:07:07,00:07:07,There was.
00:07:07,00:07:10,"In April, they started in April 2008,"
00:07:10,00:07:14,when a Dutch student committed the act on the Taj Mahal.
00:07:14,00:07:15,That was it.
00:07:15,00:07:17,Now that.
00:07:17,00:07:18,"I mean, that's not cool, is it?"
00:07:18,00:07:19,I don't know.
00:07:19,00:07:20,But I don't think it is.
00:07:20,00:07:22,[LAUGHTER]
00:07:22,00:07:27,"I've never known what's cool, but given a list,"
00:07:27,00:07:29,that'll be low down it.
00:07:29,00:07:32,They've got-- the words in Dutch are so amazing.
00:07:32,00:07:34,"And they do-- similar to German, which"
00:07:34,00:07:35,has a lot of these compound words.
00:07:35,00:07:37,"You know, we just strap words together like a glove"
00:07:37,00:07:43,"as a hand shoo, which I think is cool."
00:07:43,00:07:46,"So Porcini mushrooms, and I'm going to mispronounce this,"
00:07:46,00:07:50,"are ikhuren-yis-brut, which literally means little squirrel's"
00:07:50,00:07:53,"bread, which is sweet."
00:07:53,00:07:57,"Peanut butter is pindercas, or peanut cheese."
00:07:57,00:08:00,Slightly less appealing.
00:08:00,00:08:04,"And oh, see, if you can guess this is a mule pier, a mouth pair."
00:08:04,00:08:06,Do you mean pear as a two or two thing?
00:08:06,00:08:09,"No, I mean, pear is in Dan's pier, pier."
00:08:09,00:08:10,It's a slap in the face.
00:08:10,00:08:11,A slap in the face.
00:08:11,00:08:13,"Yeah, as it was for you guys just now,"
00:08:13,00:08:15,when you realize what I meant.
00:08:15,00:08:18,"You know the little squirrel bread thing, though."
00:08:18,00:08:21,So I think that's pronounced acorn.
00:08:21,00:08:23,"And it's good that I mean Dutch speaks in the audience,"
00:08:23,00:08:26,"so you can't correct me, but which is very confusing"
00:08:26,00:08:28,"apparently, because it's pronounced the same as acorn."
00:08:28,00:08:32,So the word for squirrel in Dutch is pronounced the same as
00:08:32,00:08:34,"the word for acorn in English, yeah."
00:08:34,00:08:38,That must be hard for cannibal squirrels.
00:08:38,00:08:40,"Well, they don't get cool, I suppose,"
00:08:40,00:08:42,because they just say I'm going out to eat an acorn.
00:08:42,00:08:43,"And then they may go, yeah, fair enough."
00:08:43,00:08:46,And then they eat their brother.
00:08:46,00:08:49,"I found a way that it's finished, but this"
00:08:49,00:08:53,is just a great description of a word that means a line.
00:08:53,00:08:55,It's a finished word about being drunk.
00:08:55,00:08:58,"Kalsa, you chunit."
00:08:58,00:09:01,That is the feeling when you're going to get drunk home alone
00:09:01,00:09:03,in your underwear with no intention of going out.
00:09:03,00:09:06,Wow.
00:09:06,00:09:08,"So you just go, I'm just going to have a culturally on it tonight,"
00:09:08,00:09:09,guys.
00:09:09,00:09:12,"Yeah, it does make it sound like a choice, which is nice."
00:09:12,00:09:14,[LAUGHTER]
00:09:14,00:09:15,True.
00:09:15,00:09:17,"Did you know-- I mean, this is so off topic,"
00:09:17,00:09:21,but I read a study this week that said that.
00:09:21,00:09:23,"If you refer to yourself in the third person,"
00:09:23,00:09:25,it is a great way to de-stress.
00:09:25,00:09:28,"So if you're stressed out, instead of going, oh, my God,"
00:09:28,00:09:30,"I'm really, really scared about this."
00:09:30,00:09:34,"Show I've got to do tonight in Bath, where I haven't done any prep for it."
00:09:34,00:09:34,Then--
00:09:34,00:09:35,All you need to do is--
00:09:35,00:09:36,For instance.
00:09:36,00:09:38,"Like, random example."
00:09:38,00:09:40,"All you need to do is you step back and you go,"
00:09:40,00:09:42,Anna's really worried about a show she has to do to--
00:09:42,00:09:46,"sorry, James is really worried about a show she has to do tonight in Bath."
00:09:46,00:09:49,"And if you talk to yourself in the third person, it de-stresses you."
00:09:49,00:09:50,And it genuinely works.
00:09:50,00:09:52,I do that quite a lot.
00:09:52,00:09:52,You do.
00:09:52,00:09:53,I've heard you do it.
00:09:53,00:09:54,Yeah.
00:09:54,00:09:55,"You always go, oh, James."
00:09:55,00:09:58,"Yeah, but you sound very stressed when you're doing it."
00:09:58,00:10:00,"You always say, oh, James, you idiot."
00:10:00,00:10:01,"That's what I do, you know."
00:10:01,00:10:05,James is going to lock you in the cupboard.
00:10:05,00:10:08,"It's-- I'll be honest, it's pretty messed up."
00:10:08,00:10:11,[LAUGHTER]
00:10:11,00:10:13,"I'm not stressed, though."
00:10:13,00:10:14,"Right, no, you're not."
00:10:14,00:10:15,James isn't stressed.
00:10:15,00:10:17,That's what you say.
00:10:17,00:10:18,I'll say what I want.
00:10:18,00:10:22,[LAUGHTER]
00:10:22,00:10:24,Daniel is scared.
00:10:24,00:10:26,So here's the thing about the Dutch language.
00:10:26,00:10:27,Yeah.
00:10:27,00:10:31,There was a guy called Johannes Garopius Becanus.
00:10:31,00:10:36,And he thought that Dutch was the original language in the whole world.
00:10:36,00:10:36,OK.
00:10:36,00:10:40,And his logic behind this was that the word Adam
00:10:40,00:10:46,"sounds a bit like the Dutch word's heart dam, which means dam and hate."
00:10:46,00:10:46,OK.
00:10:46,00:10:52,"And Eve sounds a bit like you that, meaning the eternal barrel."
00:10:52,00:10:53,OK.
00:10:53,00:10:56,And he thought that these two names were originally Dutch.
00:10:56,00:10:59,"And therefore, Dutch was the language of the Garden of Eden."
00:10:59,00:11:01,"And therefore, Dutch is the original word."
00:11:01,00:11:03,And then everyone just kind of stole words from them.
00:11:03,00:11:06,"Well, that is a desperate man."
00:11:06,00:11:08,He has too much time in his hands.
00:11:08,00:11:14,He also thought that Antwerp was founded by Noah's kids after the big flood.
00:11:14,00:11:17,"They decided to go to this place, which is basically below sea level."
00:11:17,00:11:20,[LAUGHTER]
00:11:20,00:11:23,"But on Noah's Ark, there would have been some ants."
00:11:23,00:11:26,"So maybe they said, oh, we'll name the city after whatever gets off first."
00:11:26,00:11:28,And then the ants got off first?
00:11:28,00:11:29,Sure.
00:11:29,00:11:32,"I mean, I sounded unreaching here as well."
00:11:32,00:11:36,"I read a great fact about Adam and Eve the other day,"
00:11:36,00:11:39,"which is that they weren't really humans,"
00:11:39,00:11:41,because they were prototype humans.
00:11:41,00:11:44,"So they were actually Garden vegetables, both of them."
00:11:44,00:11:51,"So if you look at old drawings of them,"
00:11:51,00:11:55,"they're like a groove in Guardians of the Galaxy,"
00:11:55,00:11:58,like tree-like characters.
00:11:58,00:12:02,"Can I just take you back to the beginning of this bit of yours,"
00:12:02,00:12:04,"where you said, I read a great fact."
00:12:04,00:12:07,Yeah.
00:12:07,00:12:13,"But no, no, it's like it's a fact that someone and myself believe that that is."
00:12:13,00:12:17,"And so check this out as well, because they were root vegetables."
00:12:17,00:12:21,"And they were like, woo, they didn't have sex with each other."
00:12:21,00:12:23,But they had to procreate.
00:12:23,00:12:25,And secret societies are looking for what is known
00:12:25,00:12:28,"as a lost word, because it's a lost word."
00:12:28,00:12:32,And they're searching for it because it's said to be so powerful
00:12:32,00:12:36,"that if said to the face of a woman, it would instantly impregnate her."
00:12:36,00:12:43,That was the worst minute of my life.
00:12:43,00:12:43,My God.
00:12:43,00:12:49,So I was reading some real facts about language learning.
00:12:49,00:12:51,"No, the economists did this thing where they went and searched"
00:12:51,00:12:54,for the hardest language to learn.
00:12:54,00:12:55,And it's really interesting.
00:12:55,00:12:57,It tells you loads of cool stuff about various languages.
00:12:57,00:13:00,But they concluded that the hardest language to learn is this language called
00:13:00,00:13:05,"Tuyuka, which is spoken in the Eastern Amazon, I think."
00:13:05,00:13:08,"And the hard thing about that, which I think would be a particular problem for us"
00:13:08,00:13:14,"and for you, is that the verb endings on statements require you to show"
00:13:14,00:13:16,how you know something.
00:13:16,00:13:21,"So if you state a fact, in the verb ending,"
00:13:21,00:13:23,you have to say how you've known it.
00:13:23,00:13:29,"So the way the verb is a rending for, according to secret societies."
00:13:29,00:13:36,I think they'll add that when there's no Tuyuka for citation needed.
00:13:36,00:13:38,"Doesn't, they don't need it."
00:13:38,00:13:38,That's so cool.
00:13:38,00:13:42,"Yeah, so like the phrase for the boy played soccer,"
00:13:42,00:13:45,"I know because I saw him play soccer,"
00:13:45,00:13:48,is the played would be a different word to the boy played soccer.
00:13:48,00:13:51,"I know because I read about it in a book or on Wikipedia,"
00:13:51,00:13:54,or from a mad person on the street.
00:13:54,00:14:00,"All right, it is time for fact number two, and that is my fact."
00:14:00,00:14:01,"Oh, God."
00:14:01,00:14:02,Yeah.
00:14:02,00:14:06,And the word fact is brought to you very loosely today.
00:14:06,00:14:13,So my fact is that American president Calvin Coolidge
00:14:13,00:14:19,used to ride a robot horse inside the White House three times every day.
00:14:21,00:14:22,It's not extraordinary.
00:14:22,00:14:24,And how did you learn this?
00:14:24,00:14:28,I was talking to a root vegetable who...
00:14:28,00:14:34,"So Calvin Coolidge, 30th president of the United States of America,"
00:14:34,00:14:35,rode horses.
00:14:35,00:14:37,"There's a surprising amount of presidents who ride horses,"
00:14:37,00:14:40,but Calvin Coolidge was allergic to horses.
00:14:40,00:14:46,"So he was built this mechanical horse that sat inside the White House,"
00:14:46,00:14:48,"and he thought it was a joke that it was being given to him,"
00:14:48,00:14:50,but he tried it out and he really loved it.
00:14:50,00:14:52,And it had two different options of it.
00:14:52,00:14:54,"One was gallop and one was canter,"
00:14:54,00:14:58,and he used to dress up as a cowboy every time he got on to it.
00:14:58,00:15:01,Sometimes just the hat and totally naked.
00:15:01,00:15:01,No.
00:15:01,00:15:04,"Yeah, yeah, he liked being naked a lot, Calvin Coolidge."
00:15:04,00:15:07,"And get this, check this out, chew on this, Murray."
00:15:07,00:15:08,The...
00:15:08,00:15:15,"The horse was invented by John Kellogg,"
00:15:15,00:15:18,who invented Kellogg's cornflakes.
00:15:18,00:15:21,"Yeah, he was outside of Kellogg's cornflakes."
00:15:21,00:15:24,"He invented a lot of things, the mechanical horse."
00:15:24,00:15:28,He invented this really cool thing for if you're getting too hot in bed.
00:15:28,00:15:30,"It was a tent, just for your head,"
00:15:30,00:15:33,that led to a sort of tent pipe that went outside your window.
00:15:33,00:15:35,So it just...
00:15:35,00:15:37,And you can see pictures of it online.
00:15:37,00:15:40,"Yeah, you know how like those sometimes windows just have a fan"
00:15:40,00:15:42,that like sends out that little...
00:15:42,00:15:43,"Yeah, it was exactly like that."
00:15:43,00:15:45,"And so you see pictures of people laying in bed,"
00:15:45,00:15:49,"which is a tent door open, so they haven't zipped up."
00:15:49,00:15:51,And just getting cooled by that idea.
00:15:51,00:15:53,"He invented the mechanical horse, as you say."
00:15:53,00:15:56,"He also invented a mechanical camel,"
00:15:56,00:15:58,"which was pretty much the same, actually."
00:15:58,00:16:00,He just had a hump.
00:16:00,00:16:04,He invented a kneading machine in which you would lie on it
00:16:04,00:16:08,and mallets would pummel your bladder and intestines.
00:16:08,00:16:09,Wow.
00:16:09,00:16:11,And a colonic machine for animals.
00:16:11,00:16:13,And they would fire gallons of water up your rectum.
00:16:13,00:16:15,-Gallons. -Gallons.
00:16:15,00:16:17,You can lift off.
00:16:17,00:16:18,"No, no."
00:16:18,00:16:21,Followed by eight ounces of yoghurt.
00:16:21,00:16:22,Afterwards.
00:16:22,00:16:23,That's quite a lot of yoghurt as well.
00:16:23,00:16:25,"Sure, it's not gallons."
00:16:25,00:16:26,"No, no, no."
00:16:26,00:16:27,"And I've seen a picture of it,"
00:16:27,00:16:30,"and they have multiple kind of bits coming out,"
00:16:30,00:16:32,so it was for more than one person at once.
00:16:32,00:16:33,No.
00:16:33,00:16:33,Yeah.
00:16:33,00:16:37,"So you know how you don't like to sit even with us on a train, Andy?"
00:16:37,00:16:37,Yes.
00:16:37,00:16:38,Yeah.
00:16:38,00:16:41,Imagine if we had to hang out while we were all having eight gallon
00:16:41,00:16:43,of animals.
00:16:43,00:16:46,My imagination was shut down.
00:16:46,00:16:48,"But horse machines were quite a big deal,"
00:16:48,00:16:50,because horse riding everyone did it before the motor car.
00:16:50,00:16:52,So there were lots of horse riding exercise machines.
00:16:52,00:16:55,"And then when bikes came along in the 19th century,"
00:16:55,00:16:57,then cycling machines became a big thing.
00:16:57,00:16:59,"And I found an article on Timeline,"
00:16:59,00:17:01,"which is a really great website, by the way."
00:17:01,00:17:05,And it's from a magazine called The Rambler in 1897.
00:17:05,00:17:07,And it's this description of something
00:17:07,00:17:10,"that had been invented, which was a stationary bike."
00:17:10,00:17:13,So it's a bicycle that has all the delights of outdoor cycling
00:17:13,00:17:14,enjoyed at home.
00:17:14,00:17:16,And it was invented by a painter.
00:17:16,00:17:20,And what he'd done is he'd painted an enormous roll
00:17:20,00:17:21,of outdoor scenery.
00:17:21,00:17:23,And he'd rigged it up to his cycling machine.
00:17:23,00:17:26,And he's attached the canvas to rollers.
00:17:26,00:17:29,"And as he cycled, the scenery rushes past him."
00:17:29,00:17:30,That's amazing.
00:17:30,00:17:30,Wow.
00:17:30,00:17:32,It looks like we're outside.
00:17:32,00:17:34,"Because you can buy cycling machines now,"
00:17:34,00:17:36,where you can see on a video like the Tour de France
00:17:36,00:17:38,or whatever you're going.
00:17:38,00:17:39,So this is basically that.
00:17:39,00:17:39,This is that.
00:17:39,00:17:40,That's very cool.
00:17:40,00:17:41,I found a really similar thing.
00:17:41,00:17:45,"OK, so I think the treadmill, one of its first uses,"
00:17:45,00:17:47,was four horses.
00:17:47,00:17:50,I think they were four horses to exercise before they
00:17:50,00:17:51,were for people to exercise.
00:17:51,00:17:51,Really?
00:17:51,00:17:52,Yeah.
00:17:52,00:17:55,"So Case in Point, the queen, last year,"
00:17:55,00:17:59,"bought a treadmill for all the queen's horses,"
00:17:59,00:18:02,but not all the queen's men.
00:18:02,00:18:06,She's got a treadmill that 18 horses can walk or run
00:18:06,00:18:07,on at the same time.
00:18:07,00:18:09,"And I think the big question is, could they"
00:18:09,00:18:12,put a Humpty together again?
00:18:12,00:18:15,But there were theatrical shows in London
00:18:15,00:18:19,"where they would have live horses on stage in theaters,"
00:18:19,00:18:20,in Jury Lane.
00:18:20,00:18:22,"So they would have a massive stage, obviously."
00:18:22,00:18:26,"And then they did a huge spectacular show in 1902, which"
00:18:26,00:18:27,"was, I think it was Ben Hur."
00:18:27,00:18:29,"Ben Hur, it was a biblical epic."
00:18:29,00:18:31,And they had a massive treadmill.
00:18:31,00:18:33,And they had about a dozen horses on stage
00:18:33,00:18:36,"running, galloping on a treadmill."
00:18:36,00:18:36,Wow.
00:18:36,00:18:40,"Yeah, while they wound a massive panorama beside,"
00:18:40,00:18:41,like a chariot race.
00:18:41,00:18:42,Wow.
00:18:42,00:18:43,Very cool.
00:18:43,00:18:44,"Yeah, that's insane."
00:18:44,00:18:45,That is really good.
00:18:45,00:18:47,"The exercise horse, since we're in Bath,"
00:18:47,00:18:50,I should say that the exercise horse is mentioned
00:18:50,00:18:52,in Jane Austen.
00:18:52,00:18:53,"Yeah, is it?"
00:18:53,00:18:54,"Yeah, sure is."
00:18:54,00:18:57,"It's in Sanditon, the novel that she didn't finish."
00:18:57,00:18:58,"But yeah, she mentioned the exercise horse."
00:18:58,00:19:01,"And basically, in her day, what it was was a chair, which"
00:19:01,00:19:02,had a lot of the springs on it.
00:19:02,00:19:05,And so you bounced up and down on it.
00:19:05,00:19:06,I could trampoline.
00:19:06,00:19:07,I was a trampoline chair.
00:19:07,00:19:09,I found out a couple of facts about Calvin Coolidge.
00:19:09,00:19:10,"Oh, yeah."
00:19:10,00:19:12,So he was famously a very quiet man.
00:19:12,00:19:13,And he became even quieter.
00:19:13,00:19:15,And I have one anecdote about him here.
00:19:15,00:19:18,So this is during the presidential campaign in 1924.
00:19:18,00:19:22,"He was found out by a reporter who said to him,"
00:19:22,00:19:25,"Mr. President, what do you think of prohibition?"
00:19:25,00:19:27,"Coolidge said, no comment."
00:19:27,00:19:29,Will you say something about unemployment?
00:19:29,00:19:31,No.
00:19:31,00:19:32,The reporter pressed on.
00:19:32,00:19:34,"He said, will you tell us your views about the world's"
00:19:34,00:19:35,situation?
00:19:35,00:19:36,No.
00:19:36,00:19:38,About your message to Congress?
00:19:38,00:19:39,No.
00:19:39,00:19:41,And the reporter just started to leave.
00:19:41,00:19:42,"And then Coolidge said, wait."
00:19:42,00:19:43,And the man turns around.
00:19:43,00:19:45,"And Coolidge says, don't quote me."
00:19:45,00:19:49,That's good.
00:19:49,00:19:51,"Apparently, he would always--"
00:19:51,00:19:53,he wouldn't let his children eat dinner
00:19:53,00:19:56,unless they were in full tuxedo.
00:19:56,00:19:57,What?
00:19:57,00:19:58,"Yeah, apparently."
00:19:58,00:20:00,"And one night, his son came home a little bit late."
00:20:00,00:20:01,He'd been out playing.
00:20:01,00:20:02,And he was a little bit late for dinner.
00:20:02,00:20:05,"And he said, oh, what do I really need to dress up?"
00:20:05,00:20:07,Can I not just go and eat dinner in this?
00:20:07,00:20:08,"And they said, young man, tonight,"
00:20:08,00:20:12,you are having dinner with the president.
00:20:12,00:20:13,We've mentioned him.
00:20:13,00:20:15,Haven't we a few times on the podcast?
00:20:15,00:20:17,He used to like to play little pranks.
00:20:17,00:20:20,"So he used to do a thing where when he was in the Oval Office,"
00:20:20,00:20:23,he used to press an emergency buzzer that meant the secret service
00:20:23,00:20:25,"would rush in, because there was an emergency."
00:20:25,00:20:29,But he would press it and quickly hide underneath the desk.
00:20:29,00:20:30,And they'd come in looking for the president.
00:20:30,00:20:33,"And he'd be, oh, Jesus, he's gone."
00:20:33,00:20:34,"Well, he loves to sleep."
00:20:34,00:20:36,So maybe he was just taking a nap.
00:20:36,00:20:37,One other famous thing about him was
00:20:37,00:20:39,that he slept 11 hours a night.
00:20:39,00:20:42,And then he took frequent naps and long naps during the day.
00:20:42,00:20:44,And this is the thing people knew about him.
00:20:44,00:20:45,So he said nothing.
00:20:45,00:20:47,And also he was unconscious most of the time.
00:20:47,00:20:51,"And one of my favorite people ever at Dorothy Parker,"
00:20:51,00:20:55,"the excellent witty literary figure of his time,"
00:20:55,00:21:00,"said when she heard about his death when someone told her he had died,"
00:21:00,00:21:03,"she just said, how could they tell?"
00:21:03,00:21:04,That's what he was famous for.
00:21:04,00:21:05,"When he was awake, he was a bastard."
00:21:05,00:21:07,I have to say this.
00:21:07,00:21:09,"When he went fishing, he went fishing a lot when he was awake."
00:21:09,00:21:13,And he insisted that his secret service men bait his hook for him.
00:21:13,00:21:14,OK.
00:21:14,00:21:15,Fine.
00:21:15,00:21:17,"I mean, it's a bit hoity-toity, but whatever."
00:21:17,00:21:20,"But then, as the secret service guys were baiting the hook,"
00:21:20,00:21:23,he would jerk the fishing rod and try and spear them
00:21:23,00:21:25,in the finger with the hook.
00:21:25,00:21:28,And he really told people how much fun it is to do.
00:21:28,00:21:31,It does sound like fun.
00:21:31,00:21:34,"Do you think, like, when it's how long ago was Coolidge?"
00:21:34,00:21:35,100 years or so?
00:21:35,00:21:36,"20s, yeah."
00:21:36,00:21:37,Just that.
00:21:37,00:21:41,"So, like, now we kind of hear all the fun stories of the things"
00:21:41,00:21:42,that he did.
00:21:42,00:21:44,Do you think we'll hear fun stories in 100 years' time
00:21:44,00:21:45,about the current president?
00:21:45,00:21:49,"We're hearing them now, right?"
00:21:49,00:21:51,"It's quite sweet his relationship with his wife,"
00:21:51,00:21:55,"who was famously a really outgoing, gregarious person,"
00:21:55,00:21:56,just called Grace.
00:21:56,00:21:58,"And so, he was the absolute opposite of her."
00:21:58,00:22:02,"And the way they met was when she was reading law,"
00:22:02,00:22:05,and she saw him shaving in his house.
00:22:05,00:22:06,"So, he was in his bathroom having a shave,"
00:22:06,00:22:08,and his window was facing out into the street.
00:22:08,00:22:10,And he was wearing just his underwear
00:22:10,00:22:12,"with his suspenders around his waist, you know,"
00:22:12,00:22:15,"like braces, not female suspenders."
00:22:15,00:22:17,Suspenders around his waist.
00:22:17,00:22:19,And he was wearing a baller hat.
00:22:19,00:22:22,"And so, she saw him and laughed, as he would."
00:22:22,00:22:24,"And he looked round out of his window,"
00:22:24,00:22:27,and he saw her tiptoes hat and went back to shaving.
00:22:27,00:22:28,And that was a sort of relationship.
00:22:28,00:22:29,"Cheers, mate. Yeah."
00:22:29,00:22:33,I was looking at other historical ways of exercising
00:22:33,00:22:34,and losing weight. Yeah.
00:22:34,00:22:38,And I found one online called the Hallelujah Diet.
00:22:38,00:22:39,"And apparently, for the Hallelujah Diet,"
00:22:39,00:22:43,"you have to ask yourself, what would Jesus eat?"
00:22:43,00:22:45,Ooh. Okay.
00:22:45,00:22:47,"And so, the idea behind this is that Jesus,"
00:22:47,00:22:51,"if he was around now, would probably be a vegetarian,"
00:22:51,00:22:53,"probably wouldn't drink, you know,"
00:22:53,00:22:54,he'd have quite a good diet.
00:22:54,00:22:56,And they stress on the website.
00:22:56,00:22:58,It's not about saying what people actually
00:22:58,00:23:01,"eat in the time of Jesus, because according to them,"
00:23:01,00:23:03,"they obviously didn't have a great diet,"
00:23:03,00:23:05,as Jesus was constantly healing the sick.
00:23:05,00:23:08,[LAUGHTER]
00:23:08,00:23:11,"You know that Jesus has a house waiting for him,"
00:23:11,00:23:13,if he does come back in Bedford.
00:23:13,00:23:15,[LAUGHTER]
00:23:15,00:23:19,"So, the garden of Eden is said to be in Bedford."
00:23:19,00:23:22,"Well, it's not Eden again, dude."
00:23:22,00:23:25,This is by a thing called the Panacea Society.
00:23:25,00:23:28,And they believed that the garden of Eden was in Bedford.
00:23:28,00:23:31,"And so, they set up the society to make sure,"
00:23:31,00:23:32,"because if Jesus came back for some reason,"
00:23:32,00:23:34,he would go back to Bedford.
00:23:34,00:23:37,"And they bought a house for him, which was a sort of semi-detached, I think."
00:23:37,00:23:39,Not even a detached house. Maybe it was a detached house.
00:23:39,00:23:41,"No, it's actually not. It's a semi-detached."
00:23:41,00:23:45,"Humble son of a carpenter wouldn't live in a detached house, would he?"
00:23:45,00:23:49,"I've seen this place, and it's an enterist in Venice, but it's a town."
00:23:49,00:23:50,"Right, okay, yeah."
00:23:50,00:23:52,I would say that semi-detached and enterist.
00:23:52,00:23:53,"Oh, yeah, okay."
00:23:53,00:23:55,But I also think that's why he's not coming back.
00:23:55,00:23:57,"He keeps on going, ""What kind of property have you got lined up for me?"""
00:23:57,00:24:00,That it's still the old terraced house in Bedford.
00:24:00,00:24:02,I'll stay out here for a little while.
00:24:02,00:24:04,"But yeah, I think they rented out to families."
00:24:04,00:24:07,"But if he does come back, I think there's a policy that he--"
00:24:07,00:24:09,[LAUGHTER]
00:24:09,00:24:11,"I don't know if they know that, but I assume."
00:24:11,00:24:13,Imagine the family receiving the phone call.
00:24:13,00:24:15,"Hello? Yeah, Mrs. Sanderson."
00:24:15,00:24:18,"You are not going to believe this, but it's hard to believe"
00:24:18,00:24:22,that Jesus would turf out a family from their house.
00:24:22,00:24:28,"When he turned out the Pharisees from the temple, he was a turner outer."
00:24:28,00:24:29,"Anyway, we need to move on, guys."
00:24:29,00:24:37,"All right, it is time for fact number three, and that is Chisinski."
00:24:37,00:24:43,My fact this week is that a member of Iceland's pirate party just injured her eye
00:24:43,00:24:48,and had to appear on TV wearing an eye patch.
00:24:48,00:24:51,"This is the nicest of all pirate-related stories,"
00:24:51,00:24:52,because it would be harrowing to her.
00:24:52,00:24:54,She'd lost her lower leg and had to have a peg leg.
00:24:54,00:24:56,That's true.
00:24:56,00:24:57,It would have been awkward if you guys had laughed at that.
00:24:57,00:25:01,"But fortunately, it's just a kind of innocuous injury."
00:25:01,00:25:04,Her one-year-old child scratched her in the eye.
00:25:04,00:25:05,So she had an injured eye.
00:25:05,00:25:07,She wore an eye patch in this debate.
00:25:07,00:25:09,"And she clarified that it was not an old-sea injury,"
00:25:09,00:25:13,because the Icelandic pirate party are not about old-sea pirates.
00:25:13,00:25:15,They're about more modern stuff.
00:25:15,00:25:17,"They're quite popular, aren't they?"
00:25:17,00:25:18,"Yeah, they are popular."
00:25:18,00:25:21,"There was a time a couple of years ago where they were the most popular party in Iceland, I think."
00:25:21,00:25:23,And now they're the third biggest.
00:25:23,00:25:26,"I think in the last elections, they might have got about 14 percent."
00:25:26,00:25:29,"Yeah, yeah."
00:25:29,00:25:32,"But yeah, Icelandic elections, they're really into them."
00:25:32,00:25:34,So the last election was last year.
00:25:34,00:25:37,The government keeps collapsing.
00:25:37,00:25:41,It's like saying that we're really into referendums.
00:25:41,00:25:42,It's not that they have a lot.
00:25:42,00:25:45,It's just that they like them when they happen.
00:25:45,00:25:48,"So in 2016, the turnout was 76 percent,"
00:25:48,00:25:52,which is the lowest turnout ever at a Icelandic election.
00:25:52,00:25:54,Which is quite impressive.
00:25:54,00:25:56,And that was despite 10 percent of the country in Iceland
00:25:56,00:26:01,"was away watching the Euros in the last election, I think."
00:26:01,00:26:02,When it happened.
00:26:02,00:26:06,"Yes, so I was reading an AMA on Reddit by the pirate party."
00:26:06,00:26:07,And they were asked about piracy.
00:26:07,00:26:12,And basically their idea is they think that everyone should be allowed to do whatever they want
00:26:12,00:26:15,"on the internet, like just copy whatever they want and all that kind of thing."
00:26:15,00:26:18,And they don't think there should be copyright rules.
00:26:18,00:26:20,And they were asked on this Reddit AMA
00:26:20,00:26:23,whether they think they'd be actually able to do anything
00:26:23,00:26:27,because other countries like the US or the UK have their copyright rules.
00:26:27,00:26:30,And surely Iceland wouldn't be able to do anything about that.
00:26:30,00:26:34,"And they admitted, yeah, okay, maybe we won't be able to do anything about it."
00:26:34,00:26:38,"They said, ""No country is an island in a globalized world, not even Iceland,"
00:26:38,00:26:40,"which really is an island."""
00:26:40,00:26:43,[LAUGHTER]
00:26:43,00:26:44,"I was confused about this fact when I read it,"
00:26:44,00:26:48,"because I thought, oh, that's so ironic when I read it."
00:26:48,00:26:51,And then so a member of Iceland's pirate party.
00:26:51,00:26:54,"Yeah, and then I thought, hang on, is it ironic?"
00:26:54,00:26:57,"And I couldn't work it out, and I was too embarrassed to ask anyone."
00:26:57,00:27:00,So I googled if it was ironic.
00:27:00,00:27:06,"And I found a website, which if anyone else suffers from not knowing if things are ironic,"
00:27:06,00:27:10,you can now go to isironic.com.
00:27:10,00:27:14,"And it's just that they're going, no, no."
00:27:14,00:27:17,And then Dan and Lannis Morosette constantly submitting requests.
00:27:17,00:27:20,Yeah.
00:27:20,00:27:25,"Lannis is resubmitting, saying, isn't it, though?"
00:27:25,00:27:29,"Yeah, so it's just lists of things where people are going,"
00:27:29,00:27:31,"is this or is this not ironic, just a couple?"
00:27:31,00:27:34,And I put your fact up as well to see.
00:27:34,00:27:36,And it's got 50/50 at the moment.
00:27:36,00:27:38,So the people vote on it.
00:27:38,00:27:39,"Yeah, people vote on it."
00:27:39,00:27:44,So Katniss from the Hunger Games is injured by getting burnt after becoming dubbed
00:27:44,00:27:47,"""The Girl on Fire"" is an ironic, 75%."
00:27:47,00:27:49,"Say it is not ironic, yes."
00:27:49,00:27:53,Torched tower in Dubai caught fire.
00:27:53,00:27:55,I think all of these things are ironic.
00:27:55,00:27:58,But there are different meanings of ironic.
00:27:58,00:27:59,Guns won't be allowed.
00:27:59,00:28:03,"Come on, there's situational irony, there's dramatic irony, there's also."
00:28:03,00:28:05,"Oh, also."
00:28:05,00:28:07,"Go on, give us another one."
00:28:07,00:28:11,Guns won't be allowed at Trump's NRA speech.
00:28:11,00:28:12,That is ironic.
00:28:12,00:28:14,"Yes, 63% agree with you."
00:28:14,00:28:16,"The people are with me, guys."
00:28:16,00:28:17,That's not ironic.
00:28:17,00:28:20,That's a sensible precaution.
00:28:20,00:28:25,"Just on Iceland quickly, Iceland has so many, as you say,"
00:28:25,00:28:26,"scandals, political scandals."
00:28:26,00:28:33,"So the last prime minister had to resign because he was caught up in the panorama papers,"
00:28:33,00:28:36,"which meant he'd basically been hiding an enormous amount of money offshore,"
00:28:36,00:28:39,"which you'd think the pirate party would be a fond of, but..."
00:28:39,00:28:48,They weren't happy.
00:28:48,00:28:51,"But basically, when that came out, when that story broke,"
00:28:51,00:28:56,the number of people who protested was nearly 10% of the entire population
00:28:56,00:29:00,as 10% of the entire country in basically one square.
00:29:00,00:29:01,Wow.
00:29:01,00:29:03,Was it the same 10% who went to the euro?
00:29:03,00:29:04,"I think it must have been, yeah."
00:29:04,00:29:05,They just love to travel.
00:29:05,00:29:06,Yeah.
00:29:06,00:29:11,"It's big pirate news this week, I think, or certainly in the last two weeks."
00:29:11,00:29:14,"The pirate party just came third in the Czech elections,"
00:29:14,00:29:19,and they got their most votes that any pirate party has ever got in any election.
00:29:19,00:29:24,"So it's big news that they've been on party for less than 10 years,"
00:29:24,00:29:25,so they're doing really well.
00:29:25,00:29:30,"And as part of the campaign, they kick-started a solar-powered pirate boat"
00:29:30,00:29:32,"to do all the campaigning,"
00:29:32,00:29:35,despite the fact that the Czech Republic is unlocked.
00:29:35,00:29:38,"Is that ironic, Anna?"
00:29:38,00:29:39,It's funny.
00:29:39,00:29:40,I'll take it.
00:29:40,00:29:45,"In Taiwan, the pirate party wasn't allowed, I think."
00:29:45,00:29:52,"So in 2012, there was an application to name a political party, the pirate party,"
00:29:52,00:29:55,and it was rejected by the Ministry of Interior
00:29:55,00:30:01,due to bad connotations because pirates aren't known as good people.
00:30:01,00:30:05,"Well, there's a lot of pirates in the straits around Indonesia and Singapore itself."
00:30:05,00:30:09,"Yeah, and so the Ministry of Interior said that we think they might be confusion,"
00:30:09,00:30:14,"and people might think that you are real pirates, so they were told not to do it."
00:30:14,00:30:17,"But do you guys know, so you know the pirate accent?"
00:30:17,00:30:18,R.
00:30:18,00:30:20,R. Yes.
00:30:20,00:30:23,"Thanks, I don't know what's up with these guys."
00:30:23,00:30:25,Do you know what that comes from?
00:30:25,00:30:27,R.
00:30:27,00:30:28,R.
00:30:28,00:30:31,"Somerset, everyone went from Somerset and Devon and ran away to see..."
00:30:31,00:30:33,"That's exactly what it is, not what it is."
00:30:33,00:30:36,"It was popularized in the 1950s by a guy called Robert Guy Newton,"
00:30:36,00:30:38,"who was a Hollywood actor at the time,"
00:30:38,00:30:42,"and he was the person who was in Pirates of Pensanth, I think,"
00:30:42,00:30:46,"and he played Pirates in a few films, and he was from Devon,"
00:30:46,00:30:49,"and he just decided, ""I'll just really up my Devon accent."""
00:30:49,00:30:54,"And so he did that being a pirate, and then people decided that was what Pirates sounded like,"
00:30:54,00:30:55,so that's where it comes from.
00:30:55,00:30:57,That'd be a damn lie.
00:30:57,00:31:02,"But actually Pirates, they came from all over the place, didn't they?"
00:31:02,00:31:06,"And apparently, I read an article that says, ""The most number came from London."""
00:31:06,00:31:12,"So really, the more correct pirate accent would be kind of a cockney-ish accent"
00:31:12,00:31:14,with a load of bows and these and...
00:31:14,00:31:16,Was that what Johnny Depp has in?
00:31:16,00:31:18,What does he have?
00:31:18,00:31:21,It's a Keith Richards accent. Is that a cockney?
00:31:21,00:31:22,"Yeah, I think so."
00:31:22,00:31:23,That's good.
00:31:23,00:31:26,It's kind of an extremely accurate movie.
00:31:26,00:31:30,"I met the lady who does the costumes for Pirates of the Caribbean last year,"
00:31:30,00:31:36,"and she says they always bring some wire wool to make all of the costumes old,"
00:31:36,00:31:39,'cause you can't buy old clothes.
00:31:39,00:31:39,"Well, you can."
00:31:39,00:31:41,You can buy old clothes?
00:31:41,00:31:45,"Wow, James, that is a very elitist thing to think."
00:31:45,00:31:49,"Wow! I mean, have you seen what I'm wearing?"
00:31:49,00:31:51,I obviously don't believe it.
00:31:51,00:31:56,"Yeah, no, but as in 17th century kind of well-worn..."
00:31:56,00:31:59,Those are mostly run-out in the shops now.
00:31:59,00:32:00,I'll try and do that.
00:32:00,00:32:04,To be their most charity shops do not have a long 17th century line.
00:32:04,00:32:10,"Yeah, someone's grandpa's grandpa's grandpa's grandpa's grandpa died,"
00:32:10,00:32:12,and this is in their attic.
00:32:12,00:32:18,"So, can you think of a pirate who went to Eaton?"
00:32:18,00:32:19,Not a true question.
00:32:19,00:32:20,"Oh, gosh."
00:32:20,00:32:21,I'll tell you.
00:32:21,00:32:23,"So, Teddy, Captain Hook."
00:32:23,00:32:24,Did he?
00:32:24,00:32:25,Captain Hook?
00:32:25,00:32:26,He's an old-atonian.
00:32:26,00:32:27,Why?
00:32:27,00:32:28,Because you really?
00:32:28,00:32:31,"Yeah, in the first ever play of Peter Pan is made very clear that he's..."
00:32:31,00:32:32,We went to Eaton.
00:32:32,00:32:33,That's what...
00:32:33,00:32:34,"So, that's what James Barry says."
00:32:34,00:32:35,"Yes, what James Barry says."
00:32:35,00:32:36,In the original play...
00:32:36,00:32:37,What?
00:32:37,00:32:38,..in the actual play of Peter Pan.
00:32:38,00:32:46,"Captain Hook's final words are floriat itona, which is the school motto."
00:32:46,00:32:53,"So, there was a letter to the Times in the 1930s, and it said, ""Sir, I see that the term pirate"
00:32:53,00:33:00,is being applied to the class of person who owns a wireless set without paying for a license.
00:33:00,00:33:03,Is this not a misnomer of a two-flattering nature?
00:33:03,00:33:08,"Unlawful though it might be piracy, has at least the merit of some romance, and hasn't"
00:33:08,00:33:12,the past call forth qualities of courage and even courtesy.
00:33:12,00:33:18,"The person, especially in these hard times, who listens without paying for a license, displays"
00:33:18,00:33:22,none of the daredevil virtues of a pirate.
00:33:22,00:33:24,He is a sneaker.
00:33:24,00:33:28,"And the term wireless sneaker would be more appropriate."""
00:33:28,00:33:33,"As the pain signed, James Hook, Eaton College."
00:33:33,00:33:40,"And last year, the largest salmon caught in Iceland was called by Eric Clapton."
00:33:40,00:33:47,"Ah! Sorry, I knew we were way off the Iceland thing, I know, but I just had to mention that."
00:33:47,00:33:49,"Hang on, the Eric Clapton."
00:33:49,00:33:50,The Eric Clapton.
00:33:50,00:33:56,"I'm sorry to say, but I actually called the lake that happened at, and it turns out that"
00:33:56,00:34:00,"it was the biggest salmon at the specific lake, but not for all of Iceland."
00:34:00,00:34:07,You'd have thought that them would be the arbiter of what was true and tells you.
00:34:07,00:34:11,How do you phone a lake?
00:34:11,00:34:17,I think I'm one of those novelty-shell phones.
00:34:17,00:34:20,"That is great fact-checking, that was pretty impative fact-checking."
00:34:20,00:34:24,That's the most fact-checking I've ever had in my life.
00:34:24,00:34:29,"All right, we need to move on to our final fact of the show, and that is Andy."
00:34:29,00:34:34,"My fact is, that the man who invented email later changed career to become a sheepseeman"
00:34:34,00:34:35,importer.
00:34:35,00:34:36,Sorry.
00:34:36,00:34:40,Which of those two things has taken off?
00:34:40,00:34:42,"Yeah, who is this?"
00:34:42,00:34:45,"He was called Ray Tomlinson, and he's the man who invented email."
00:34:45,00:34:49,"I mean, he later became a miniature sheep breeder, but that involved the importation of a lot"
00:34:49,00:34:50,of sheep's.
00:34:50,00:34:53,"Yeah, he wasn't just randomly imparting it just for..."
00:34:53,00:34:56,"Sorry, when you say a miniature sheep breeder, was he very small?"
00:34:56,00:34:57,"No, he was massive."
00:34:57,00:34:58,He was massive?
00:34:58,00:35:01,He was just a human.
00:35:01,00:35:06,"He was a normal man, but he was a great man because he invented email."
00:35:06,00:35:12,"And he is the guy who picked the @ sign for the email address, and it was very, very clever,"
00:35:12,00:35:19,"because it basically meant you could send an email to any computer, and it was outside a"
00:35:19,00:35:20,"network, basically."
00:35:20,00:35:22,"We know where email is, mate."
00:35:22,00:35:26,"Well, but this is before the World Wide Web, isn't it?"
00:35:26,00:35:27,"Yeah, exactly."
00:35:27,00:35:32,"You've got, yeah, you don't have a way of doing it, and it's very weird because, until he"
00:35:32,00:35:36,"invented email, basically, the previous means of doing it was you had to leave a message"
00:35:36,00:35:41,"on the same computer, and then someone else had to log in to see what the message was."
00:35:41,00:35:45,"And that was email before him, which is not a convenient thing, obviously."
00:35:45,00:35:52,"So you would write the email on your computer, mail your computer to the person."
00:35:52,00:35:56,"Yeah, Amazon, I would like to buy a pair of your socks, and then you'd have to send a"
00:35:56,00:35:57,"computer, yeah."
00:35:57,00:35:58,"Yeah, okay."
00:35:58,00:35:59,Yeah.
00:35:59,00:36:03,Do you know how Brian Bleserd tweets?
00:36:03,00:36:06,Very loudly.
00:36:06,00:36:12,"He has his tweets, faxed to him, and then he receives his tweets by fax."
00:36:12,00:36:18,"He reads through them, he calls his agent, he answers it over the phone, and his agent takes"
00:36:18,00:36:24,"a note of it, and then types out all the tweets at the end of the day to send back it out."
00:36:24,00:36:29,"So the art symbol seems to be the thing that Ray Thomson gets asked about the most, right?"
00:36:29,00:36:32,"And I think it's weird that we don't have a name for the art symbol, and it's really, we"
00:36:32,00:36:36,"call it the Amphora, but no, well we all call it the Amphora."
00:36:36,00:36:37,We call it the Amphora.
00:36:37,00:36:38,Yeah.
00:36:38,00:36:39,Show of hands.
00:36:39,00:36:40,Who calls it the Amphora?
00:36:40,00:36:45,I've never seen fewer hands go off in a room.
00:36:45,00:36:50,"But you can get me on podcast AmphoraQI.com, that's what I would say, but no, all of the"
00:36:50,00:36:51,countries call it something interesting.
00:36:51,00:36:57,"So I think in, is it in Spain, or is it, it's a Chocuola, which is a little snail, in Russia,"
00:36:57,00:37:03,"it's the word for dog, in Norway, it's called the Sign of the Meow, which maybe is to do with"
00:37:03,00:37:04,a tail.
00:37:04,00:37:05,It looks like a cat curled up with its tail.
00:37:05,00:37:07,It looks like a cat curled up.
00:37:07,00:37:14,"So the, at the moment, the movement of Seaman, the important export in the UK, is sorted"
00:37:14,00:37:17,"out by the EU, by the Belide Directive."
00:37:17,00:37:19,"Oh, imagine sorting that out."
00:37:19,00:37:24,"Oh, no, I mean, I just mean the rules, yeah, the rules."
00:37:24,00:37:29,"For listeners at home, Daniel's doing some really gross mimeing."
00:37:29,00:37:33,But I don't think anyone's talking about how this is going to affect it after Brexit.
00:37:33,00:37:34,Are they?
00:37:34,00:37:35,I'm not.
00:37:35,00:37:36,I'm not.
00:37:36,00:37:40,"But this is really important, because you need to import Seaman from different countries,"
00:37:40,00:37:42,otherwise all of your livestock is in bread.
00:37:42,00:37:43,Yeah.
00:37:43,00:37:44,Yeah.
00:37:44,00:37:47,"Because like, for instance, in America, they're importing a lot of bee semen at the moment."
00:37:47,00:37:52,"Because they sell bee semen, yeah."
00:37:52,00:37:58,"So their bees are really struggling, they're all dying, and they need a new bit of genetic"
00:37:58,00:37:59,material.
00:37:59,00:38:02,"And so they get the bee semen in from other countries, and then they inseminate them into"
00:38:02,00:38:03,the bees.
00:38:03,00:38:07,"But it's quite difficult if you get it through customs, because they don't often see"
00:38:07,00:38:08,bee semen coming through.
00:38:08,00:38:12,You're looking at me like I'm making this up.
00:38:12,00:38:14,I didn't know bees had semen.
00:38:14,00:38:15,They do.
00:38:15,00:38:18,So each male produces one micro-liter.
00:38:18,00:38:24,"To put that into some kind of perspective, a single drop of water is 100 micro-litres."
00:38:24,00:38:29,So you need 100 bees to produce enough semen to be like the one drop of water.
00:38:29,00:38:31,What's the purpose of that?
00:38:31,00:38:32,That fact.
00:38:32,00:38:34,"No, what's the purpose of getting the 100 bees together?"
00:38:34,00:38:35,And...
00:38:35,00:38:36,"Oh, yeah."
00:38:36,00:38:37,That's...
00:38:37,00:38:40,Imagine being invited to that party.
00:38:40,00:38:41,What?
00:38:41,00:38:42,As a bee.
00:38:42,00:38:45,"I want to know how they collect it, because the ways of collecting semen as a farmer"
00:38:45,00:38:46,are...
00:38:46,00:38:47,They're quite interesting.
00:38:47,00:38:50,"There's one guy, basically."
00:38:50,00:38:51,One man.
00:38:51,00:38:52,One man.
00:38:52,00:38:53,With tiny fingers.
00:38:53,00:38:54,Is it?
00:38:54,00:38:58,Is it Donald Trump?
00:38:58,00:39:01,No.
00:39:01,00:39:04,"It's Michael Wait, 53, from Scotland."
00:39:04,00:39:05,Okay.
00:39:05,00:39:10,He's one of the few beekeepers who is inseminating queen bees by milking the bees.
00:39:10,00:39:12,I've seen footage of it.
00:39:12,00:39:14,You just have to squeeze the abdomen very gently.
00:39:14,00:39:15,"Oh, wow."
00:39:15,00:39:16,It comes out.
00:39:16,00:39:17,Because in...
00:39:17,00:39:21,"So in farming of larger animals, then they have dummies, don't they?"
00:39:21,00:39:22,So they have dummies of use.
00:39:22,00:39:29,"So, for instance, bullsemen, it fertilises 75% of the cows in this country, I think, because"
00:39:29,00:39:30,it's just much easier.
00:39:30,00:39:31,It's more convenient.
00:39:31,00:39:32,You mean it imported semen?
00:39:32,00:39:33,What?
00:39:33,00:39:36,What fertilises the other 25% of cows?
00:39:36,00:39:41,There's a special word that you say.
00:39:41,00:39:52,"Sorry, imported bullsemen, imported bullsemen that comes in vials, fertilises dairy cows,"
00:39:52,00:39:55,but you need to be able to collect it.
00:39:55,00:40:00,"And so you sell dummies, and you can look up dummies online, and you can buy dummies"
00:40:00,00:40:05,"south, for instance, that you can get pigs to mount because you need pig semen to be"
00:40:05,00:40:07,imported as well.
00:40:07,00:40:12,"And it's really hard to collect because you have to get literally in there, so you've"
00:40:12,00:40:17,"got the dummy sow, but you have to swoop in there the last minute with your cup to collect"
00:40:17,00:40:18,it.
00:40:18,00:40:22,"And that's why it's much more convenient to use a dummy because with an actual sow, it moves"
00:40:22,00:40:25,"around the pen quite a lot, and so you have to chase it around, whereas with the dummy"
00:40:25,00:40:26,"it stays still, at least."
00:40:26,00:40:29,But this is how a lot of farm animals are inseminated.
00:40:29,00:40:30,Yeah.
00:40:30,00:40:35,"There is another method which is that some males then mount other males, and the other males"
00:40:35,00:40:40,"are called teasers, okay, and then they're interrupted at the last minute by a man with"
00:40:40,00:40:41,a rubber tube.
00:40:41,00:40:44,"Oh my god, who volunteers for that job?"
00:40:44,00:40:49,I don't think it's paid.
00:40:49,00:40:55,"Guys, we need to wrap up at a sec, have you got anything before we do?"
00:40:55,00:40:57,I have something on sheep breeding.
00:40:57,00:41:01,Alexander Graham Bell was into sheep breeding.
00:41:01,00:41:07,"He noticed that some sheep had more nipples than others, and he tried to systematically breed"
00:41:07,00:41:16,"sheep with each other to get more nipple sheep, and he wrote a paper in science in 1904 called"
00:41:16,00:41:22,"the multi-nipple sheep of Ben Bray, okay, and he managed to eventually, they don't talk"
00:41:22,00:41:25,"about this when they're talking about the phone, do they?"
00:41:25,00:41:31,"He eventually yielded five and six nipple sheep, and he thought that if they have more nipples,"
00:41:31,00:41:35,"they'd be more fertile, but he was wrong about that."
00:41:35,00:41:39,They just had more nipples.
00:41:39,00:41:42,"Everyone knows the first phone conversation, don't they, you know, ""Doctor Watson, come"
00:41:42,00:41:46,"here, I want you,"" but no one recorded what came next, which is, ""I want you to read this"
00:41:46,00:41:49,"paper I've done about nipples on sheep."""
00:41:49,00:41:53,"All right, should we wrap up, guys?"
00:41:53,00:41:58,"Okay, that is it, that is all of our facts, thank you so much for listening."
00:41:58,00:42:00,If you would like to get in contact with any of us about the things that we have said
00:42:00,00:42:04,"over the course of this podcast, we can be found on our Twitter accounts."
00:42:04,00:42:06,"I'm on @Sriberland, Andy."
00:42:06,00:42:07,I'm Fora.
00:42:07,00:42:08,Andrew Hunter M.
00:42:08,00:42:09,James.
00:42:09,00:42:10,That's James Harkin.
00:42:10,00:42:11,And Shazansky.
00:42:11,00:42:12,You can email podcast@kywai.com.
00:42:12,00:42:19,"Yeah, or you can go to our group account, which is @nosuchthing, or you can go to"
00:42:19,00:42:20,our website.
00:42:20,00:42:21,Nosuchthing is a fish.com.
00:42:21,00:42:23,We have all of our previous episodes up there.
00:42:23,00:42:27,"We also have a link to our new book, The Book of the Year, which is being released November"
00:42:27,00:42:28,the 2nd.
00:42:28,00:42:31,"It's out, in fact, what by the time you're listening to this."
00:42:31,00:42:33,"And we're about to give on away to one of the members of the audience, because we asked"
00:42:33,00:42:37,"them to send in a fact at the beginning of the show, and Andy, you've picked a winning"
00:42:37,00:42:38,fact?
00:42:38,00:42:40,"Yes, this fact comes from Karris Rubinzer."
00:42:40,00:42:45,"I hope I pronounced your name right, and it's that the inventor of the bra had a pet"
00:42:45,00:42:57,whip it named Cliteris.
00:42:57,00:43:01,"And just one last thing before we wrap up, this is such a cool venue."
00:43:01,00:43:04,We're so proud to have come up here to play it.
00:43:04,00:43:07,"We've heard so much about it from our friends who have been here as well, and it has lived"
00:43:07,00:43:08,up to what they said.
00:43:08,00:43:11,"And you'll notice that on your seats, you would have been given this thing, which is"
00:43:11,00:43:15,"to save baths from being boring, the committee is looking for crowdfunding to make sure that"
00:43:15,00:43:19,it can be secured as a community-led place.
00:43:19,00:43:25,"So please, if you can, go to this crowdfunder page, help it out, because I, you know, it's"
00:43:25,00:43:30,"my first time to bath, but I do know from doing comedy that venues like this do get shut down,"
00:43:30,00:43:34,"and they're really important, and they're so good, and that's how comedy in this country,"
00:43:34,00:43:37,and it's the best country in the world for comedy still exists.
00:43:37,00:43:40,So please go to this and help them out.
00:43:40,00:43:42,"We'll be back again next week with another episode, guys."
00:43:42,00:43:44,Thank you so much for being here tonight.
00:43:44,00:43:46,"We'll be out at the back, signing books, and so on."
00:43:46,00:43:47,We'll see you then.
00:43:47,00:43:48,Goodbye.
