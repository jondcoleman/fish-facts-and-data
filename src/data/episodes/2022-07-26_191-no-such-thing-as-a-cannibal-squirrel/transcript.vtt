00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
 [SINGING]

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.480
 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:18.000
 Hello, and welcome to another episode.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.560
 No such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast this week coming

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.920
 to you from the comedia in BAS.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.360
 [APPLAUSE]

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.840
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.920
 I'm sitting here with Anich Zinski, Andrew Hunter Murray,

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:33.920
 and James Harkin.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.120
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.080
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.600
 And in a particular order, here we go,

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.200
 starting with you, James Harkin.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.120
 OK, my fat this week is that it's easier to speak Dutch

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.840
 if you're drunk.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.720
 As in, if you're a non-native speaker--

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.720
 Yeah, if you're Dutch--

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.240
 you tend not to have too many problems in general if you're Dutch.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.440
 And you can't be absolutely hammered.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.080
 You have to be very slightly one pint kind of drunk.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.600
 And this is a study that's been done recently.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.960
 They got 50 native German speakers

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.160
 to talk to a Dutch person in Dutch.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.600
 And then they recorded it, and they asked some Dutch people

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.040
 afterwards, how did they do?

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.440
 And the drunk people did a little bit better.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.680
 But unfortunately, I did read on Reddit.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.600
 Someone posted on Reddit that Dutch is basically

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.680
 like a German got drunk and can't speak properly anymore.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.200
 So there's a lot of slurred sounds in this fleshlier leshler.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.120
 I didn't know you speak.

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.840
 And you're not even drinking.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.760
 Does anyone hear speak Dutch?

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:43.880
 Wow.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.120
 No.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.400
 Have another drink, and then see.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.760
 Because I wonder if it's slightly by accident

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.040
 that when you're drunk, you're just a bit more confident.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.760
 And you're saying work-- because they've

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.760
 had words that are actually quite similar to English.

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.880
 So the word for "apple" is "apple."

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.760
 The word for "pair" is "pair."

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.080
 Wait, someone does speak it down there.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.160
 Who's saying it?

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.080
 Or you've gotten what I'm doing now.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.400
 He just owns a green grosses in Antwerp.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.720
 I think that person has just understood

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.840
 the admittedly complex joke that you're doing right now.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.680
 But yeah, it wasn't so much remembering the words

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.240
 as much as they had better fluency and better pronunciation.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.320
 That's what people said.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.920
 And weirdly, the people themselves

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.640
 didn't think that they were doing any better.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.320
 You would think, if you're drunk, you have a bit more

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.280
 bravado, but they didn't really have that.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.120
 The people themselves thought, oh, I'm doing OK.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.880
 Well, actually, the Dutch people-- that's amazing.

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.960
 But Dutch people are so English proficient.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.760
 About 90% of people in the Netherlands speak really good English.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.520
 So it's quite hard to get conversational with people in Dutch.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:50.520
 I went there earlier this year.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.520
 And as soon as you open your mouth and try to say, hello,

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.320
 or something, you know, Apple.

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.280
 Yeah.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.640
 You spotted a mile off and they immediately say, oh,

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:00.400
 hello, how are you doing?

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.400
 What would you like?

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.200
 You want an apple?

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.120
 Do you want a pink lady or a russet?

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.600
 And it's very hard to--

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.720
 But actually, this study was--

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.680
 it was German-speaking Dutch.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.440
 But actually, there was a 1972 study

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.320
 in which showed that Americans could speak

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.720
 tie a bit better if they were a bit drunk.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:17.520
 Really?

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.760
 Yeah.

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.600
 I speak Mandarin much better when I'm drunk.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.040
 And I do speak Mandarin.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.760
 I grew up in Hong Kong.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.160
 And yeah, I do notice that when I'm drunk, I'm just--

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.480
 I'm awesome at it.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:30.600
 There's no anecdote with that.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.640
 I just want to sort of big up my language-speaking abilities.

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.880
 Has anyone else ever noticed that about you?

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.080
 Or is it just that you think they--

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.920
 No, I just tell it to people who don't speak Mandarin.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.920
 I'm like, whoa, I am kicking ass right now in my Mandarin.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.720
 But I can know-- because I was really bad as a kid.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.840
 I was the only kid in my year that when I went back to school

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.840
 I had forgotten his name in Chinese.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.120
 Oh, God.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.720
 So I sat--

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.960
 Is it your name in Chinese Dandab?

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.160
 Oh, yeah, no.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.480
 That was my nickname at school.

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:57.160
 This is so bad.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.600
 I was called-- some of my names Dan.

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.480
 Obviously, I was called Dan Dan at school.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.960
 And I thought that was a really cool nickname,

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.400
 because everyone knew my nickname.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.800
 And I was like, wow, that's so cool.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.040
 And they'd be like, older kids.

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.120
 Hey, Dan Dan.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.200
 And I only found out.

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.400
 It was about six years ago.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.400
 I was living in England.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.760
 I was in my late 20s.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.120
 And someone on-- I put on Facebook saying,

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.760
 Dan Dan just won a game against an old Hong Kong friend

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.000
 and someone wrote, ah, Dan Dan, you know that means

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.200
 testicles in Chinese, right?

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.480
 And I had no idea.

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:26.440
 No one told me.

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.000
 I wrote to my friends at school, my old school friends.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.840
 I was like, did you know I was called balls this whole time?

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.320
 And they were like, yeah, did you not know?

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.480
 It's a whole childhood.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:37.320
 I thought I was cool.

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.760
 I was just a boy called balls.

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.480
 And a boy called balls who forgot his name every holidays.

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:43.240
 Yeah.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.000
 And genuinely, I would sit in class.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.360
 And I would be sweating, because they

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.400
 be doing the roll call.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.920
 And I'd just go, I have no idea what my name is.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:50.880
 And when it gets to it.

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.240
 And then there was one time that I thought my name was Shia Boa,

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.640
 but I thought it was Law Boa, which is Radish.

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:01.240
 So then I just got called Radish Balls or something, I guess, right?

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.920
 So it's hard.

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.600
 So I'm very proud when I get drunk and remember my Mandarin.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.320
 I think you remember your name.

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.400
 I'm always impressed by that.

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.360
 But getting drunk can't improve your skills in various ways,

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.120
 can't it?

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:20.160
 So the Snooker player, Bill Verbeniuk, how do you say that?

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.480
 Oh, Verbenek.

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:25.040
 Verbenek Verbeniuk, like who's counting?

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.960
 He used to get--

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.080
 That's not for me.

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.600
 He used to get really drunk.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.160
 So he used to have six to eight points before a match.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.840
 And then he would have one during each frame during the match.

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.160
 And that made him play better.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.960
 And everyone does always think that they play a bit better

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.160
 after a few points.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.240
 After a few, maybe, but not after, how many did you say?

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.640
 Six to eight, before a game.

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:48.560
 And not during the game.

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:49.400
 How many frames are there?

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:50.960
 I'm assuming there must be only about three.

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.360
 Well, in the World Championship final,

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.800
 which he never reached, I don't think.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.480
 I think there's like 34 or something, 37.

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:02.840
 I can't see why he never reached that stage.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.840
 But also, the world anti-doping agency

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.760
 bans alcohol from just five sports.

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:10.640
 So bans evening from five sports--

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.760
 A motor racing.

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.160
 A motor racing is one of them.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.160
 Yes.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:20.160
 So motor racing powerboating, air sports, auto racing--

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.640
 motorcycle racing.

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.360
 So you can see why it bans drinking in those.

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.000
 It's a bit dangerous.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.160
 And archery.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.520
 And actually, the reason it bans archery

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.200
 is that there was a study done in 1985

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:30.680
 that found that drinking a little bit

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.200
 makes you slightly better at archery.

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.840
 And it's considered cheating.

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.320
 Oh, yeah.

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:36.160
 Yeah.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.400
 That's why that strong bowl guy is so good, isn't it?

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.400
 [LAUGHTER]

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:45.920
 So in 2008, the Dutch voted the word of the year.

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.240
 Now, all countries do this.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.000
 All lot countries do this every year.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.320
 But in 2008, the word of the year in Dutch was swafflin.

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:54.160
 OK.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:55.840
 And according to Wikipedia, swafflin

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:59.320
 means to hit one's penis often repeatedly

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:00.360
 against an object.

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:03.280
 [LAUGHTER]

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:04.600
 Didn't they start doing that?

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.400
 There was a trend for swafflin in the Netherlands, I think.

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:07.880
 There was.

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:10.120
 In April, they started in April 2008,

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:14.200
 when a Dutch student committed the act on the Taj Mahal.

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:15.400
 That was it.

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.000
 Now that.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.400
 I mean, that's not cool, is it?

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:19.480
 I don't know.

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:20.760
 But I don't think it is.

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:22.920
 [LAUGHTER]

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:27.480
 I've never known what's cool, but given a list,

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:29.440
 that'll be low down it.

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:32.080
 They've got-- the words in Dutch are so amazing.

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.120
 And they do-- similar to German, which

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.320
 has a lot of these compound words.

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:37.360
 You know, we just strap words together like a glove

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:43.440
 as a hand shoo, which I think is cool.

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:46.760
 So Porcini mushrooms, and I'm going to mispronounce this,

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:50.040
 are ikhuren-yis-brut, which literally means little squirrel's

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:53.400
 bread, which is sweet.

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:57.560
 Peanut butter is pindercas, or peanut cheese.

00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:00.040
 Slightly less appealing.

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:04.520
 And oh, see, if you can guess this is a mule pier, a mouth pair.

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:06.400
 Do you mean pear as a two or two thing?

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.040
 No, I mean, pear is in Dan's pier, pier.

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:10.520
 It's a slap in the face.

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:11.400
 A slap in the face.

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.160
 Yeah, as it was for you guys just now,

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.520
 when you realize what I meant.

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:18.200
 You know the little squirrel bread thing, though.

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:21.600
 So I think that's pronounced acorn.

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.760
 And it's good that I mean Dutch speaks in the audience,

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:26.880
 so you can't correct me, but which is very confusing

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:28.720
 apparently, because it's pronounced the same as acorn.

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:32.200
 So the word for squirrel in Dutch is pronounced the same as

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:34.880
 the word for acorn in English, yeah.

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:38.840
 That must be hard for cannibal squirrels.

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:40.160
 Well, they don't get cool, I suppose,

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:42.000
 because they just say I'm going out to eat an acorn.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.640
 And then they may go, yeah, fair enough.

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:46.960
 And then they eat their brother.

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.080
 I found a way that it's finished, but this

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:53.120
 is just a great description of a word that means a line.

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:55.560
 It's a finished word about being drunk.

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:58.120
 Kalsa, you chunit.

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:01.040
 That is the feeling when you're going to get drunk home alone

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:03.600
 in your underwear with no intention of going out.

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:06.120
 Wow.

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:08.640
 So you just go, I'm just going to have a culturally on it tonight,

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:09.560
 guys.

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:12.120
 Yeah, it does make it sound like a choice, which is nice.

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:14.400
 [LAUGHTER]

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:15.400
 True.

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:17.400
 Did you know-- I mean, this is so off topic,

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:21.160
 but I read a study this week that said that.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:23.360
 If you refer to yourself in the third person,

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:25.560
 it is a great way to de-stress.

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:28.760
 So if you're stressed out, instead of going, oh, my God,

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:30.760
 I'm really, really scared about this.

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:34.040
 Show I've got to do tonight in Bath, where I haven't done any prep for it.

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:34.840
 Then--

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:35.800
 All you need to do is--

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:36.840
 For instance.

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:38.640
 Like, random example.

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:40.720
 All you need to do is you step back and you go,

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:42.880
 Anna's really worried about a show she has to do to--

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:46.720
 sorry, James is really worried about a show she has to do tonight in Bath.

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:49.600
 And if you talk to yourself in the third person, it de-stresses you.

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:50.880
 And it genuinely works.

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.240
 I do that quite a lot.

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:52.840
 You do.

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:53.680
 I've heard you do it.

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:54.320
 Yeah.

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:55.760
 You always go, oh, James.

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:58.600
 Yeah, but you sound very stressed when you're doing it.

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:00.320
 You always say, oh, James, you idiot.

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.640
 That's what I do, you know.

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:05.880
 James is going to lock you in the cupboard.

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:08.480
 It's-- I'll be honest, it's pretty messed up.

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:11.480
 [LAUGHTER]

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:13.040
 I'm not stressed, though.

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:14.760
 Right, no, you're not.

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:15.800
 James isn't stressed.

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:17.280
 That's what you say.

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:18.720
 I'll say what I want.

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:22.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.640
 Daniel is scared.

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:26.960
 So here's the thing about the Dutch language.

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:27.960
 Yeah.

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:31.560
 There was a guy called Johannes Garopius Becanus.

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:36.080
 And he thought that Dutch was the original language in the whole world.

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:36.880
 OK.

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:40.480
 And his logic behind this was that the word Adam

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:46.080
 sounds a bit like the Dutch word's heart dam, which means dam and hate.

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:46.760
 OK.

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:52.400
 And Eve sounds a bit like you that, meaning the eternal barrel.

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:53.360
 OK.

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:56.960
 And he thought that these two names were originally Dutch.

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:59.760
 And therefore, Dutch was the language of the Garden of Eden.

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:01.640
 And therefore, Dutch is the original word.

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:03.920
 And then everyone just kind of stole words from them.

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:06.000
 Well, that is a desperate man.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.040
 He has too much time in his hands.

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:14.200
 He also thought that Antwerp was founded by Noah's kids after the big flood.

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:17.320
 They decided to go to this place, which is basically below sea level.

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:20.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:23.200
 But on Noah's Ark, there would have been some ants.

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:26.760
 So maybe they said, oh, we'll name the city after whatever gets off first.

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:28.520
 And then the ants got off first?

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:29.520
 Sure.

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:32.320
 I mean, I sounded unreaching here as well.

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:36.120
 I read a great fact about Adam and Eve the other day,

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:39.480
 which is that they weren't really humans,

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:41.280
 because they were prototype humans.

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:44.720
 So they were actually Garden vegetables, both of them.

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:51.720
 So if you look at old drawings of them,

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:55.640
 they're like a groove in Guardians of the Galaxy,

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:58.600
 like tree-like characters.

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:02.280
 Can I just take you back to the beginning of this bit of yours,

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:04.880
 where you said, I read a great fact.

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:07.360
 Yeah.

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:13.880
 But no, no, it's like it's a fact that someone and myself believe that that is.

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:17.760
 And so check this out as well, because they were root vegetables.

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:21.360
 And they were like, woo, they didn't have sex with each other.

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:23.000
 But they had to procreate.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.240
 And secret societies are looking for what is known

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:28.400
 as a lost word, because it's a lost word.

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:32.360
 And they're searching for it because it's said to be so powerful

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:36.280
 that if said to the face of a woman, it would instantly impregnate her.

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:43.080
 That was the worst minute of my life.

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:43.920
 My God.

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:49.400
 So I was reading some real facts about language learning.

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:51.600
 No, the economists did this thing where they went and searched

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:54.480
 for the hardest language to learn.

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:55.360
 And it's really interesting.

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:57.600
 It tells you loads of cool stuff about various languages.

00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:00.960
 But they concluded that the hardest language to learn is this language called

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:05.000
 Tuyuka, which is spoken in the Eastern Amazon, I think.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.520
 And the hard thing about that, which I think would be a particular problem for us

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:14.880
 and for you, is that the verb endings on statements require you to show

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:16.560
 how you know something.

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:21.600
 So if you state a fact, in the verb ending,

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:23.640
 you have to say how you've known it.

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:29.000
 So the way the verb is a rending for, according to secret societies.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:36.720
 I think they'll add that when there's no Tuyuka for citation needed.

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:38.000
 Doesn't, they don't need it.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:38.720
 That's so cool.

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:42.760
 Yeah, so like the phrase for the boy played soccer,

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:45.320
 I know because I saw him play soccer,

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:48.800
 is the played would be a different word to the boy played soccer.

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:51.920
 I know because I read about it in a book or on Wikipedia,

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:54.120
 or from a mad person on the street.

00:13:54.120 --> 00:14:00.640
 All right, it is time for fact number two, and that is my fact.

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:01.400
 Oh, God.

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:02.400
 Yeah.

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:06.960
 And the word fact is brought to you very loosely today.

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:13.120
 So my fact is that American president Calvin Coolidge

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:19.160
 used to ride a robot horse inside the White House three times every day.

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:22.960
 It's not extraordinary.

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:24.520
 And how did you learn this?

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:28.480
 I was talking to a root vegetable who...

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:34.400
 So Calvin Coolidge, 30th president of the United States of America,

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:35.320
 rode horses.

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:37.920
 There's a surprising amount of presidents who ride horses,

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:40.360
 but Calvin Coolidge was allergic to horses.

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:46.040
 So he was built this mechanical horse that sat inside the White House,

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:48.440
 and he thought it was a joke that it was being given to him,

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:50.600
 but he tried it out and he really loved it.

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:52.520
 And it had two different options of it.

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:54.520
 One was gallop and one was canter,

00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:58.520
 and he used to dress up as a cowboy every time he got on to it.

00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:01.080
 Sometimes just the hat and totally naked.

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:01.920
 No.

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:04.440
 Yeah, yeah, he liked being naked a lot, Calvin Coolidge.

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:07.960
 And get this, check this out, chew on this, Murray.

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:08.800
 The...

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:15.320
 The horse was invented by John Kellogg,

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:18.280
 who invented Kellogg's cornflakes.

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:21.160
 Yeah, he was outside of Kellogg's cornflakes.

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:24.560
 He invented a lot of things, the mechanical horse.

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:28.120
 He invented this really cool thing for if you're getting too hot in bed.

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:30.440
 It was a tent, just for your head,

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:33.800
 that led to a sort of tent pipe that went outside your window.

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:35.080
 So it just...

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:37.720
 And you can see pictures of it online.

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:40.920
 Yeah, you know how like those sometimes windows just have a fan

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:42.360
 that like sends out that little...

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:43.880
 Yeah, it was exactly like that.

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:45.640
 And so you see pictures of people laying in bed,

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:49.240
 which is a tent door open, so they haven't zipped up.

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:51.720
 And just getting cooled by that idea.

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:53.880
 He invented the mechanical horse, as you say.

00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:56.520
 He also invented a mechanical camel,

00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:58.360
 which was pretty much the same, actually.

00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:00.360
 He just had a hump.

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:04.920
 He invented a kneading machine in which you would lie on it

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:08.360
 and mallets would pummel your bladder and intestines.

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:09.080
 Wow.

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:11.160
 And a colonic machine for animals.

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:13.800
 And they would fire gallons of water up your rectum.

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:15.640
 -Gallons. -Gallons.

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:17.080
 You can lift off.

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:18.600
 No, no.

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:21.240
 Followed by eight ounces of yoghurt.

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:22.120
 Afterwards.

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:23.800
 That's quite a lot of yoghurt as well.

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:25.080
 Sure, it's not gallons.

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:26.520
 No, no, no.

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:27.720
 And I've seen a picture of it,

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:30.120
 and they have multiple kind of bits coming out,

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:32.360
 so it was for more than one person at once.

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:33.160
 No.

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:33.800
 Yeah.

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:37.000
 So you know how you don't like to sit even with us on a train, Andy?

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:37.480
 Yes.

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:38.280
 Yeah.

00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:41.480
 Imagine if we had to hang out while we were all having eight gallon

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:43.720
 of animals.

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:46.520
 My imagination was shut down.

00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:48.280
 But horse machines were quite a big deal,

00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:50.360
 because horse riding everyone did it before the motor car.

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:52.680
 So there were lots of horse riding exercise machines.

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:55.320
 And then when bikes came along in the 19th century,

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:57.560
 then cycling machines became a big thing.

00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:59.800
 And I found an article on Timeline,

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:01.800
 which is a really great website, by the way.

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:05.560
 And it's from a magazine called The Rambler in 1897.

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:07.400
 And it's this description of something

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:10.360
 that had been invented, which was a stationary bike.

00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:13.640
 So it's a bicycle that has all the delights of outdoor cycling

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:14.760
 enjoyed at home.

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:16.680
 And it was invented by a painter.

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:20.200
 And what he'd done is he'd painted an enormous roll

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:21.640
 of outdoor scenery.

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:23.960
 And he'd rigged it up to his cycling machine.

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:26.360
 And he's attached the canvas to rollers.

00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:29.480
 And as he cycled, the scenery rushes past him.

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:30.120
 That's amazing.

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:30.520
 Wow.

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:32.040
 It looks like we're outside.

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:34.120
 Because you can buy cycling machines now,

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:36.840
 where you can see on a video like the Tour de France

00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:38.040
 or whatever you're going.

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:39.240
 So this is basically that.

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:39.880
 This is that.

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:40.720
 That's very cool.

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:41.760
 I found a really similar thing.

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:45.560
 OK, so I think the treadmill, one of its first uses,

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:47.480
 was four horses.

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:50.120
 I think they were four horses to exercise before they

00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:51.440
 were for people to exercise.

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:51.960
 Really?

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:52.960
 Yeah.

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:55.320
 So Case in Point, the queen, last year,

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:59.320
 bought a treadmill for all the queen's horses,

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:02.920
 but not all the queen's men.

00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:06.000
 She's got a treadmill that 18 horses can walk or run

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.600
 on at the same time.

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:09.400
 And I think the big question is, could they

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:12.480
 put a Humpty together again?

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:15.200
 But there were theatrical shows in London

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:19.400
 where they would have live horses on stage in theaters,

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:20.480
 in Jury Lane.

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:22.600
 So they would have a massive stage, obviously.

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:26.000
 And then they did a huge spectacular show in 1902, which

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.280
 was, I think it was Ben Hur.

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:29.080
 Ben Hur, it was a biblical epic.

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:31.400
 And they had a massive treadmill.

00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:33.640
 And they had about a dozen horses on stage

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:36.440
 running, galloping on a treadmill.

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:36.960
 Wow.

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:40.280
 Yeah, while they wound a massive panorama beside,

00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:41.640
 like a chariot race.

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:42.840
 Wow.

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:43.400
 Very cool.

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:44.480
 Yeah, that's insane.

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:45.440
 That is really good.

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:47.840
 The exercise horse, since we're in Bath,

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:50.240
 I should say that the exercise horse is mentioned

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:52.560
 in Jane Austen.

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:53.520
 Yeah, is it?

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:54.520
 Yeah, sure is.

00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:57.120
 It's in Sanditon, the novel that she didn't finish.

00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:58.960
 But yeah, she mentioned the exercise horse.

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:01.040
 And basically, in her day, what it was was a chair, which

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:02.600
 had a lot of the springs on it.

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:05.200
 And so you bounced up and down on it.

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:06.200
 I could trampoline.

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:07.360
 I was a trampoline chair.

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:09.520
 I found out a couple of facts about Calvin Coolidge.

00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:10.520
 Oh, yeah.

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:12.280
 So he was famously a very quiet man.

00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:13.560
 And he became even quieter.

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:15.520
 And I have one anecdote about him here.

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:18.840
 So this is during the presidential campaign in 1924.

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:22.640
 He was found out by a reporter who said to him,

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:25.240
 Mr. President, what do you think of prohibition?

00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:27.520
 Coolidge said, no comment.

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:29.560
 Will you say something about unemployment?

00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:31.560
 No.

00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:32.440
 The reporter pressed on.

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:34.000
 He said, will you tell us your views about the world's

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.040
 situation?

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:36.520
 No.

00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:38.120
 About your message to Congress?

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:39.320
 No.

00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:41.120
 And the reporter just started to leave.

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:42.720
 And then Coolidge said, wait.

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:43.800
 And the man turns around.

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:45.600
 And Coolidge says, don't quote me.

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:49.400
 That's good.

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:51.520
 Apparently, he would always--

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:53.720
 he wouldn't let his children eat dinner

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:56.280
 unless they were in full tuxedo.

00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:57.040
 What?

00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:58.080
 Yeah, apparently.

00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:00.360
 And one night, his son came home a little bit late.

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:01.120
 He'd been out playing.

00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:02.840
 And he was a little bit late for dinner.

00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:05.520
 And he said, oh, what do I really need to dress up?

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:07.080
 Can I not just go and eat dinner in this?

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:08.920
 And they said, young man, tonight,

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:12.720
 you are having dinner with the president.

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:13.400
 We've mentioned him.

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:15.760
 Haven't we a few times on the podcast?

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:17.640
 He used to like to play little pranks.

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:20.600
 So he used to do a thing where when he was in the Oval Office,

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:23.920
 he used to press an emergency buzzer that meant the secret service

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:25.800
 would rush in, because there was an emergency.

00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:29.040
 But he would press it and quickly hide underneath the desk.

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:30.600
 And they'd come in looking for the president.

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:33.120
 And he'd be, oh, Jesus, he's gone.

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:34.600
 Well, he loves to sleep.

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:36.560
 So maybe he was just taking a nap.

00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:37.800
 One other famous thing about him was

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:39.520
 that he slept 11 hours a night.

00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:42.920
 And then he took frequent naps and long naps during the day.

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:44.360
 And this is the thing people knew about him.

00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:45.320
 So he said nothing.

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:47.520
 And also he was unconscious most of the time.

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:51.160
 And one of my favorite people ever at Dorothy Parker,

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:55.800
 the excellent witty literary figure of his time,

00:20:55.800 --> 00:21:00.000
 said when she heard about his death when someone told her he had died,

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.360
 she just said, how could they tell?

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:04.520
 That's what he was famous for.

00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:05.880
 When he was awake, he was a bastard.

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:07.520
 I have to say this.

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:09.760
 When he went fishing, he went fishing a lot when he was awake.

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:13.520
 And he insisted that his secret service men bait his hook for him.

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:14.560
 OK.

00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:15.080
 Fine.

00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:17.400
 I mean, it's a bit hoity-toity, but whatever.

00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:20.400
 But then, as the secret service guys were baiting the hook,

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:23.360
 he would jerk the fishing rod and try and spear them

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:25.480
 in the finger with the hook.

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:28.480
 And he really told people how much fun it is to do.

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:31.640
 It does sound like fun.

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:34.760
 Do you think, like, when it's how long ago was Coolidge?

00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:35.760
 100 years or so?

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:36.560
 20s, yeah.

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:37.400
 Just that.

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:41.400
 So, like, now we kind of hear all the fun stories of the things

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:42.400
 that he did.

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:44.360
 Do you think we'll hear fun stories in 100 years' time

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:45.960
 about the current president?

00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:49.280
 We're hearing them now, right?

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:51.720
 It's quite sweet his relationship with his wife,

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:55.520
 who was famously a really outgoing, gregarious person,

00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:56.640
 just called Grace.

00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:58.840
 And so, he was the absolute opposite of her.

00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:02.840
 And the way they met was when she was reading law,

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:05.160
 and she saw him shaving in his house.

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:06.840
 So, he was in his bathroom having a shave,

00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:08.600
 and his window was facing out into the street.

00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:10.320
 And he was wearing just his underwear

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:12.880
 with his suspenders around his waist, you know,

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:15.800
 like braces, not female suspenders.

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:17.040
 Suspenders around his waist.

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:19.000
 And he was wearing a baller hat.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.600
 And so, she saw him and laughed, as he would.

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:24.400
 And he looked round out of his window,

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:27.360
 and he saw her tiptoes hat and went back to shaving.

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:28.640
 And that was a sort of relationship.

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:29.640
 Cheers, mate. Yeah.

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:33.120
 I was looking at other historical ways of exercising

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:34.480
 and losing weight. Yeah.

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:38.280
 And I found one online called the Hallelujah Diet.

00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:39.880
 And apparently, for the Hallelujah Diet,

00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:43.080
 you have to ask yourself, what would Jesus eat?

00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:45.120
 Ooh. Okay.

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:47.680
 And so, the idea behind this is that Jesus,

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:51.800
 if he was around now, would probably be a vegetarian,

00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:53.240
 probably wouldn't drink, you know,

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:54.720
 he'd have quite a good diet.

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:56.120
 And they stress on the website.

00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:58.280
 It's not about saying what people actually

00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:01.760
 eat in the time of Jesus, because according to them,

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:03.560
 they obviously didn't have a great diet,

00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:05.960
 as Jesus was constantly healing the sick.

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:08.240
 [LAUGHTER]

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:11.040
 You know that Jesus has a house waiting for him,

00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:13.280
 if he does come back in Bedford.

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:15.320
 [LAUGHTER]

00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:19.320
 So, the garden of Eden is said to be in Bedford.

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:22.120
 Well, it's not Eden again, dude.

00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:25.000
 This is by a thing called the Panacea Society.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000
 And they believed that the garden of Eden was in Bedford.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.200
 And so, they set up the society to make sure,

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:32.760
 because if Jesus came back for some reason,

00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:34.000
 he would go back to Bedford.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.680
 And they bought a house for him, which was a sort of semi-detached, I think.

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:39.840
 Not even a detached house. Maybe it was a detached house.

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:41.800
 No, it's actually not. It's a semi-detached.

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:45.000
 Humble son of a carpenter wouldn't live in a detached house, would he?

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:49.000
 I've seen this place, and it's an enterist in Venice, but it's a town.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.000
 Right, okay, yeah.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.480
 I would say that semi-detached and enterist.

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:53.280
 Oh, yeah, okay.

00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:55.200
 But I also think that's why he's not coming back.

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:57.840
 He keeps on going, "What kind of property have you got lined up for me?"

00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:00.400
 That it's still the old terraced house in Bedford.

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:02.520
 I'll stay out here for a little while.

00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:04.840
 But yeah, I think they rented out to families.

00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:07.080
 But if he does come back, I think there's a policy that he--

00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:09.040
 [LAUGHTER]

00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:11.040
 I don't know if they know that, but I assume.

00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:13.640
 Imagine the family receiving the phone call.

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:15.160
 Hello? Yeah, Mrs. Sanderson.

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:18.680
 You are not going to believe this, but it's hard to believe

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:22.240
 that Jesus would turf out a family from their house.

00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:28.280
 When he turned out the Pharisees from the temple, he was a turner outer.

00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:29.680
 Anyway, we need to move on, guys.

00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:37.120
 All right, it is time for fact number three, and that is Chisinski.

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:43.200
 My fact this week is that a member of Iceland's pirate party just injured her eye

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:48.920
 and had to appear on TV wearing an eye patch.

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:51.000
 This is the nicest of all pirate-related stories,

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.040
 because it would be harrowing to her.

00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:54.960
 She'd lost her lower leg and had to have a peg leg.

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:56.120
 That's true.

00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:57.880
 It would have been awkward if you guys had laughed at that.

00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:01.160
 But fortunately, it's just a kind of innocuous injury.

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:04.160
 Her one-year-old child scratched her in the eye.

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:05.560
 So she had an injured eye.

00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:07.360
 She wore an eye patch in this debate.

00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:09.920
 And she clarified that it was not an old-sea injury,

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:13.720
 because the Icelandic pirate party are not about old-sea pirates.

00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:15.640
 They're about more modern stuff.

00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:17.240
 They're quite popular, aren't they?

00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:18.200
 Yeah, they are popular.

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:21.400
 There was a time a couple of years ago where they were the most popular party in Iceland, I think.

00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:23.760
 And now they're the third biggest.

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:26.680
 I think in the last elections, they might have got about 14 percent.

00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:29.080
 Yeah, yeah.

00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:32.040
 But yeah, Icelandic elections, they're really into them.

00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:34.120
 So the last election was last year.

00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:37.240
 The government keeps collapsing.

00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:41.440
 It's like saying that we're really into referendums.

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:42.920
 It's not that they have a lot.

00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:45.160
 It's just that they like them when they happen.

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:48.520
 So in 2016, the turnout was 76 percent,

00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:52.440
 which is the lowest turnout ever at a Icelandic election.

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:54.080
 Which is quite impressive.

00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:56.520
 And that was despite 10 percent of the country in Iceland

00:25:56.520 --> 00:26:01.040
 was away watching the Euros in the last election, I think.

00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:02.160
 When it happened.

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:06.160
 Yes, so I was reading an AMA on Reddit by the pirate party.

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:07.680
 And they were asked about piracy.

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:12.880
 And basically their idea is they think that everyone should be allowed to do whatever they want

00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:15.880
 on the internet, like just copy whatever they want and all that kind of thing.

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:18.080
 And they don't think there should be copyright rules.

00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:20.080
 And they were asked on this Reddit AMA

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:23.240
 whether they think they'd be actually able to do anything

00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:27.560
 because other countries like the US or the UK have their copyright rules.

00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:30.800
 And surely Iceland wouldn't be able to do anything about that.

00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:34.640
 And they admitted, yeah, okay, maybe we won't be able to do anything about it.

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:38.800
 They said, "No country is an island in a globalized world, not even Iceland,

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:40.120
 which really is an island."

00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:43.120
 [LAUGHTER]

00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:44.960
 I was confused about this fact when I read it,

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:48.000
 because I thought, oh, that's so ironic when I read it.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.080
 And then so a member of Iceland's pirate party.

00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:54.080
 Yeah, and then I thought, hang on, is it ironic?

00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:57.840
 And I couldn't work it out, and I was too embarrassed to ask anyone.

00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:00.880
 So I googled if it was ironic.

00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:06.520
 And I found a website, which if anyone else suffers from not knowing if things are ironic,

00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:10.360
 you can now go to isironic.com.

00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:14.000
 And it's just that they're going, no, no.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.920
 And then Dan and Lannis Morosette constantly submitting requests.

00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:20.920
 Yeah.

00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:25.640
 Lannis is resubmitting, saying, isn't it, though?

00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:29.400
 Yeah, so it's just lists of things where people are going,

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:31.680
 is this or is this not ironic, just a couple?

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:34.160
 And I put your fact up as well to see.

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:36.920
 And it's got 50/50 at the moment.

00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:38.080
 So the people vote on it.

00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:39.120
 Yeah, people vote on it.

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:44.120
 So Katniss from the Hunger Games is injured by getting burnt after becoming dubbed

00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:47.920
 "The Girl on Fire" is an ironic, 75%.

00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:49.880
 Say it is not ironic, yes.

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:53.920
 Torched tower in Dubai caught fire.

00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:55.800
 I think all of these things are ironic.

00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:58.040
 But there are different meanings of ironic.

00:27:58.040 --> 00:27:59.440
 Guns won't be allowed.

00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:03.720
 Come on, there's situational irony, there's dramatic irony, there's also.

00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:05.720
 Oh, also.

00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:07.760
 Go on, give us another one.

00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:11.240
 Guns won't be allowed at Trump's NRA speech.

00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:12.240
 That is ironic.

00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:14.480
 Yes, 63% agree with you.

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:16.680
 The people are with me, guys.

00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:17.480
 That's not ironic.

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:20.600
 That's a sensible precaution.

00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:25.480
 Just on Iceland quickly, Iceland has so many, as you say,

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:26.760
 scandals, political scandals.

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:33.040
 So the last prime minister had to resign because he was caught up in the panorama papers,

00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:36.960
 which meant he'd basically been hiding an enormous amount of money offshore,

00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:39.520
 which you'd think the pirate party would be a fond of, but...

00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:48.600
 They weren't happy.

00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:51.920
 But basically, when that came out, when that story broke,

00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:56.640
 the number of people who protested was nearly 10% of the entire population

00:28:56.640 --> 00:29:00.360
 as 10% of the entire country in basically one square.

00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:01.160
 Wow.

00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:03.040
 Was it the same 10% who went to the euro?

00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:04.600
 I think it must have been, yeah.

00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:05.960
 They just love to travel.

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:06.960
 Yeah.

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:11.240
 It's big pirate news this week, I think, or certainly in the last two weeks.

00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:14.240
 The pirate party just came third in the Czech elections,

00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:19.680
 and they got their most votes that any pirate party has ever got in any election.

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:24.280
 So it's big news that they've been on party for less than 10 years,

00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:25.960
 so they're doing really well.

00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:30.520
 And as part of the campaign, they kick-started a solar-powered pirate boat

00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:32.880
 to do all the campaigning,

00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:35.760
 despite the fact that the Czech Republic is unlocked.

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:38.160
 Is that ironic, Anna?

00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:39.360
 It's funny.

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:40.360
 I'll take it.

00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:45.800
 In Taiwan, the pirate party wasn't allowed, I think.

00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:52.440
 So in 2012, there was an application to name a political party, the pirate party,

00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:55.080
 and it was rejected by the Ministry of Interior

00:29:55.080 --> 00:30:01.160
 due to bad connotations because pirates aren't known as good people.

00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:05.360
 Well, there's a lot of pirates in the straits around Indonesia and Singapore itself.

00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:09.160
 Yeah, and so the Ministry of Interior said that we think they might be confusion,

00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:14.160
 and people might think that you are real pirates, so they were told not to do it.

00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:17.360
 But do you guys know, so you know the pirate accent?

00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:18.360
 R.

00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:20.000
 R. Yes.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:23.400
 Thanks, I don't know what's up with these guys.

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:25.840
 Do you know what that comes from?

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:27.080
 R.

00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:28.080
 R.

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:31.680
 Somerset, everyone went from Somerset and Devon and ran away to see...

00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:33.520
 That's exactly what it is, not what it is.

00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:36.840
 It was popularized in the 1950s by a guy called Robert Guy Newton,

00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:38.520
 who was a Hollywood actor at the time,

00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:42.280
 and he was the person who was in Pirates of Pensanth, I think,

00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:46.120
 and he played Pirates in a few films, and he was from Devon,

00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:49.280
 and he just decided, "I'll just really up my Devon accent."

00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:54.520
 And so he did that being a pirate, and then people decided that was what Pirates sounded like,

00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:55.680
 so that's where it comes from.

00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:57.200
 That'd be a damn lie.

00:30:57.200 --> 00:31:02.120
 But actually Pirates, they came from all over the place, didn't they?

00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:06.480
 And apparently, I read an article that says, "The most number came from London."

00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:12.160
 So really, the more correct pirate accent would be kind of a cockney-ish accent

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:14.360
 with a load of bows and these and...

00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:16.600
 Was that what Johnny Depp has in?

00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:18.360
 What does he have?

00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:21.120
 It's a Keith Richards accent. Is that a cockney?

00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:22.520
 Yeah, I think so.

00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:23.520
 That's good.

00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:26.400
 It's kind of an extremely accurate movie.

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:30.800
 I met the lady who does the costumes for Pirates of the Caribbean last year,

00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:36.720
 and she says they always bring some wire wool to make all of the costumes old,

00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:39.000
 'cause you can't buy old clothes.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:39.840
 Well, you can.

00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:41.400
 You can buy old clothes?

00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:45.280
 Wow, James, that is a very elitist thing to think.

00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:49.600
 Wow! I mean, have you seen what I'm wearing?

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:51.560
 I obviously don't believe it.

00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:56.600
 Yeah, no, but as in 17th century kind of well-worn...

00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:59.640
 Those are mostly run-out in the shops now.

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:00.880
 I'll try and do that.

00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:04.920
 To be their most charity shops do not have a long 17th century line.

00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:10.000
 Yeah, someone's grandpa's grandpa's grandpa's grandpa's grandpa died,

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.920
 and this is in their attic.

00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:18.240
 So, can you think of a pirate who went to Eaton?

00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:19.720
 Not a true question.

00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:20.720
 Oh, gosh.

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:21.720
 I'll tell you.

00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:23.160
 So, Teddy, Captain Hook.

00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:24.160
 Did he?

00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:25.160
 Captain Hook?

00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:26.160
 He's an old-atonian.

00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:27.160
 Why?

00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:28.160
 Because you really?

00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:31.960
 Yeah, in the first ever play of Peter Pan is made very clear that he's...

00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:32.960
 We went to Eaton.

00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:33.960
 That's what...

00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:34.960
 So, that's what James Barry says.

00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:35.960
 Yes, what James Barry says.

00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:36.960
 In the original play...

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:37.960
 What?

00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:38.960
 ..in the actual play of Peter Pan.

00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:46.040
 Captain Hook's final words are floriat itona, which is the school motto.

00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:53.360
 So, there was a letter to the Times in the 1930s, and it said, "Sir, I see that the term pirate

00:32:53.360 --> 00:33:00.200
 is being applied to the class of person who owns a wireless set without paying for a license.

00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:03.720
 Is this not a misnomer of a two-flattering nature?

00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:08.360
 Unlawful though it might be piracy, has at least the merit of some romance, and hasn't

00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:12.480
 the past call forth qualities of courage and even courtesy.

00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:18.240
 The person, especially in these hard times, who listens without paying for a license, displays

00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:22.120
 none of the daredevil virtues of a pirate.

00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:24.800
 He is a sneaker.

00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:28.920
 And the term wireless sneaker would be more appropriate."

00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:33.560
 As the pain signed, James Hook, Eaton College.

00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:40.560
 And last year, the largest salmon caught in Iceland was called by Eric Clapton.

00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:47.800
 Ah! Sorry, I knew we were way off the Iceland thing, I know, but I just had to mention that.

00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:49.280
 Hang on, the Eric Clapton.

00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:50.280
 The Eric Clapton.

00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:56.240
 I'm sorry to say, but I actually called the lake that happened at, and it turns out that

00:33:56.240 --> 00:34:00.920
 it was the biggest salmon at the specific lake, but not for all of Iceland.

00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:07.160
 You'd have thought that them would be the arbiter of what was true and tells you.

00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:11.720
 How do you phone a lake?

00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:17.680
 I think I'm one of those novelty-shell phones.

00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:20.520
 That is great fact-checking, that was pretty impative fact-checking.

00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:24.240
 That's the most fact-checking I've ever had in my life.

00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:29.240
 All right, we need to move on to our final fact of the show, and that is Andy.

00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:34.240
 My fact is, that the man who invented email later changed career to become a sheepseeman

00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:35.240
 importer.

00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:36.240
 Sorry.

00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:40.120
 Which of those two things has taken off?

00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:42.280
 Yeah, who is this?

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:45.280
 He was called Ray Tomlinson, and he's the man who invented email.

00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:49.640
 I mean, he later became a miniature sheep breeder, but that involved the importation of a lot

00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:50.640
 of sheep's.

00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:53.240
 Yeah, he wasn't just randomly imparting it just for...

00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:56.520
 Sorry, when you say a miniature sheep breeder, was he very small?

00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:57.520
 No, he was massive.

00:34:57.520 --> 00:34:58.520
 He was massive?

00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:01.880
 He was just a human.

00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:06.240
 He was a normal man, but he was a great man because he invented email.

00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:12.440
 And he is the guy who picked the @ sign for the email address, and it was very, very clever,

00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:19.160
 because it basically meant you could send an email to any computer, and it was outside a

00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:20.160
 network, basically.

00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:22.360
 We know where email is, mate.

00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:26.000
 Well, but this is before the World Wide Web, isn't it?

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:27.000
 Yeah, exactly.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:32.680
 You've got, yeah, you don't have a way of doing it, and it's very weird because, until he

00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:36.480
 invented email, basically, the previous means of doing it was you had to leave a message

00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:41.400
 on the same computer, and then someone else had to log in to see what the message was.

00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:45.720
 And that was email before him, which is not a convenient thing, obviously.

00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:52.720
 So you would write the email on your computer, mail your computer to the person.

00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:56.600
 Yeah, Amazon, I would like to buy a pair of your socks, and then you'd have to send a

00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:57.600
 computer, yeah.

00:35:57.600 --> 00:35:58.600
 Yeah, okay.

00:35:58.600 --> 00:35:59.600
 Yeah.

00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:03.640
 Do you know how Brian Bleserd tweets?

00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:06.400
 Very loudly.

00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:12.440
 He has his tweets, faxed to him, and then he receives his tweets by fax.

00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:18.080
 He reads through them, he calls his agent, he answers it over the phone, and his agent takes

00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:24.360
 a note of it, and then types out all the tweets at the end of the day to send back it out.

00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:29.080
 So the art symbol seems to be the thing that Ray Thomson gets asked about the most, right?

00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:32.480
 And I think it's weird that we don't have a name for the art symbol, and it's really, we

00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:36.040
 call it the Amphora, but no, well we all call it the Amphora.

00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:37.040
 We call it the Amphora.

00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:38.040
 Yeah.

00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:39.040
 Show of hands.

00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:40.040
 Who calls it the Amphora?

00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:45.360
 I've never seen fewer hands go off in a room.

00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:50.000
 But you can get me on podcast AmphoraQI.com, that's what I would say, but no, all of the

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.640
 countries call it something interesting.

00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:57.080
 So I think in, is it in Spain, or is it, it's a Chocuola, which is a little snail, in Russia,

00:36:57.080 --> 00:37:03.040
 it's the word for dog, in Norway, it's called the Sign of the Meow, which maybe is to do with

00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:04.040
 a tail.

00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:05.880
 It looks like a cat curled up with its tail.

00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:07.680
 It looks like a cat curled up.

00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:14.360
 So the, at the moment, the movement of Seaman, the important export in the UK, is sorted

00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:17.520
 out by the EU, by the Belide Directive.

00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:19.400
 Oh, imagine sorting that out.

00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:24.320
 Oh, no, I mean, I just mean the rules, yeah, the rules.

00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:29.640
 For listeners at home, Daniel's doing some really gross mimeing.

00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:33.720
 But I don't think anyone's talking about how this is going to affect it after Brexit.

00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:34.720
 Are they?

00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:35.720
 I'm not.

00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:36.720
 I'm not.

00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:40.560
 But this is really important, because you need to import Seaman from different countries,

00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:42.680
 otherwise all of your livestock is in bread.

00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:43.680
 Yeah.

00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:44.680
 Yeah.

00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:47.960
 Because like, for instance, in America, they're importing a lot of bee semen at the moment.

00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:52.160
 Because they sell bee semen, yeah.

00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:58.000
 So their bees are really struggling, they're all dying, and they need a new bit of genetic

00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.000
 material.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:02.840
 And so they get the bee semen in from other countries, and then they inseminate them into

00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:03.840
 the bees.

00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:07.000
 But it's quite difficult if you get it through customs, because they don't often see

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.760
 bee semen coming through.

00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:12.440
 You're looking at me like I'm making this up.

00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:14.600
 I didn't know bees had semen.

00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:15.600
 They do.

00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:18.800
 So each male produces one micro-liter.

00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:24.720
 To put that into some kind of perspective, a single drop of water is 100 micro-litres.

00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:29.160
 So you need 100 bees to produce enough semen to be like the one drop of water.

00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:31.240
 What's the purpose of that?

00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:32.240
 That fact.

00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:34.240
 No, what's the purpose of getting the 100 bees together?

00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:35.240
 And...

00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:36.240
 Oh, yeah.

00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:37.240
 That's...

00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:40.040
 Imagine being invited to that party.

00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:41.040
 What?

00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:42.040
 As a bee.

00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:45.560
 I want to know how they collect it, because the ways of collecting semen as a farmer

00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:46.560
 are...

00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:47.560
 They're quite interesting.

00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:50.040
 There's one guy, basically.

00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:51.040
 One man.

00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:52.040
 One man.

00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:53.040
 With tiny fingers.

00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:54.040
 Is it?

00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:58.040
 Is it Donald Trump?

00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:01.040
 No.

00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:04.000
 It's Michael Wait, 53, from Scotland.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.000
 Okay.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:10.880
 He's one of the few beekeepers who is inseminating queen bees by milking the bees.

00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:12.400
 I've seen footage of it.

00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:14.840
 You just have to squeeze the abdomen very gently.

00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:15.840
 Oh, wow.

00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:16.840
 It comes out.

00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:17.840
 Because in...

00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:21.560
 So in farming of larger animals, then they have dummies, don't they?

00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:22.760
 So they have dummies of use.

00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:29.440
 So, for instance, bullsemen, it fertilises 75% of the cows in this country, I think, because

00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:30.440
 it's just much easier.

00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:31.440
 It's more convenient.

00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:32.440
 You mean it imported semen?

00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:33.440
 What?

00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:36.440
 What fertilises the other 25% of cows?

00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:41.120
 There's a special word that you say.

00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:52.240
 Sorry, imported bullsemen, imported bullsemen that comes in vials, fertilises dairy cows,

00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:55.000
 but you need to be able to collect it.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:00.080
 And so you sell dummies, and you can look up dummies online, and you can buy dummies

00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:05.360
 south, for instance, that you can get pigs to mount because you need pig semen to be

00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:07.120
 imported as well.

00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:12.720
 And it's really hard to collect because you have to get literally in there, so you've

00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:17.720
 got the dummy sow, but you have to swoop in there the last minute with your cup to collect

00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:18.720
 it.

00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:22.200
 And that's why it's much more convenient to use a dummy because with an actual sow, it moves

00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:25.240
 around the pen quite a lot, and so you have to chase it around, whereas with the dummy

00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:26.920
 it stays still, at least.

00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:29.320
 But this is how a lot of farm animals are inseminated.

00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:30.320
 Yeah.

00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:35.800
 There is another method which is that some males then mount other males, and the other males

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:40.640
 are called teasers, okay, and then they're interrupted at the last minute by a man with

00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:41.640
 a rubber tube.

00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:44.840
 Oh my god, who volunteers for that job?

00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:49.840
 I don't think it's paid.

00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:55.280
 Guys, we need to wrap up at a sec, have you got anything before we do?

00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:57.240
 I have something on sheep breeding.

00:40:57.240 --> 00:41:01.120
 Alexander Graham Bell was into sheep breeding.

00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:07.800
 He noticed that some sheep had more nipples than others, and he tried to systematically breed

00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:16.040
 sheep with each other to get more nipple sheep, and he wrote a paper in science in 1904 called

00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:22.320
 the multi-nipple sheep of Ben Bray, okay, and he managed to eventually, they don't talk

00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:25.280
 about this when they're talking about the phone, do they?

00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:31.240
 He eventually yielded five and six nipple sheep, and he thought that if they have more nipples,

00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:35.640
 they'd be more fertile, but he was wrong about that.

00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:39.800
 They just had more nipples.

00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:42.760
 Everyone knows the first phone conversation, don't they, you know, "Doctor Watson, come

00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:46.280
 here, I want you," but no one recorded what came next, which is, "I want you to read this

00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:49.960
 paper I've done about nipples on sheep."

00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:53.400
 All right, should we wrap up, guys?

00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:58.080
 Okay, that is it, that is all of our facts, thank you so much for listening.

00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:00.960
 If you would like to get in contact with any of us about the things that we have said

00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:04.320
 over the course of this podcast, we can be found on our Twitter accounts.

00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:06.320
 I'm on @Sriberland, Andy.

00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:07.320
 I'm Fora.

00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:08.320
 Andrew Hunter M.

00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:09.320
 James.

00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:10.320
 That's James Harkin.

00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:11.320
 And Shazansky.

00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:12.320
 You can email podcast@kywai.com.

00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:19.320
 Yeah, or you can go to our group account, which is @nosuchthing, or you can go to

00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:20.320
 our website.

00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:21.320
 Nosuchthing is a fish.com.

00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:23.480
 We have all of our previous episodes up there.

00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:27.640
 We also have a link to our new book, The Book of the Year, which is being released November

00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:28.640
 the 2nd.

00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:31.160
 It's out, in fact, what by the time you're listening to this.

00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:33.800
 And we're about to give on away to one of the members of the audience, because we asked

00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:37.480
 them to send in a fact at the beginning of the show, and Andy, you've picked a winning

00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:38.480
 fact?

00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:40.960
 Yes, this fact comes from Karris Rubinzer.

00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:45.040
 I hope I pronounced your name right, and it's that the inventor of the bra had a pet

00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:57.560
 whip it named Cliteris.

00:42:57.560 --> 00:43:01.600
 And just one last thing before we wrap up, this is such a cool venue.

00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:04.440
 We're so proud to have come up here to play it.

00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:07.200
 We've heard so much about it from our friends who have been here as well, and it has lived

00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:08.760
 up to what they said.

00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:11.680
 And you'll notice that on your seats, you would have been given this thing, which is

00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:15.880
 to save baths from being boring, the committee is looking for crowdfunding to make sure that

00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:19.120
 it can be secured as a community-led place.

00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:25.080
 So please, if you can, go to this crowdfunder page, help it out, because I, you know, it's

00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:30.280
 my first time to bath, but I do know from doing comedy that venues like this do get shut down,

00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:34.720
 and they're really important, and they're so good, and that's how comedy in this country,

00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:37.540
 and it's the best country in the world for comedy still exists.

00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:40.160
 So please go to this and help them out.

00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:42.960
 We'll be back again next week with another episode, guys.

00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:44.280
 Thank you so much for being here tonight.

00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:46.760
 We'll be out at the back, signing books, and so on.

00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:47.760
 We'll see you then.

00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:48.760
 Goodbye.

00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:50.760
