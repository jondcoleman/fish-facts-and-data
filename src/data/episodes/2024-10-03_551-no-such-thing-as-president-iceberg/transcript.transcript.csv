00:00:04,00:00:11,[MUSIC]
00:00:11,00:00:16,">> Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,"
00:00:16,00:00:20,a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Glasgow.
00:00:20,00:00:24,>> [APPLAUSE]
00:00:24,00:00:26,>> My name is Jan Schreiber.
00:00:26,00:00:31,"I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin."
00:00:31,00:00:35,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite"
00:00:35,00:00:39,"facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:39,00:00:42,"Starting with fact number one, that is James."
00:00:42,00:00:47,">> Okay, my fact this week is that according to DNA analysis,"
00:00:47,00:00:49,Beethoven wasn't very musical.
00:00:49,00:00:51,>> [LAUGH]
00:00:51,00:00:55,>> Is that saying something about Beethoven or about DNA analysis and
00:00:55,00:00:56,how it sort of is not?
00:00:56,00:00:59,">> We might come to Beethoven, in fact, I'm sure we will."
00:00:59,00:01:04,But this is basically a study where they looked at Beethoven's DNA.
00:01:04,00:01:08,"And they looked at the DNA of a load of students in a couple of universities,"
00:01:08,00:01:11,one in Tennessee and one in the Netherlands.
00:01:11,00:01:16,And what they were saying is that DNA tests can't really give much to
00:01:16,00:01:19,historical people and tell you about their characters really.
00:01:19,00:01:21,It's kind of a warning against that.
00:01:21,00:01:24,"But in actual fact, Beethoven, well, he wasn't like Mozart."
00:01:24,00:01:28,Like Mozart when he was age four could play incredible pieces.
00:01:28,00:01:31,"But Beethoven couldn't hold a tune, he could not write a tune."
00:01:31,00:01:32,">> No, he wasn't really."
00:01:32,00:01:33,>> I like him.
00:01:33,00:01:37,"I don't love him, I like him, but he could not write a melody to save himself."
00:01:37,00:01:39,And I bet he'd say he was above that.
00:01:39,00:01:41,"You know when you get some avant-garde pop stars who say,"
00:01:41,00:01:43,I don't write the catchy songs because they're beneath me.
00:01:43,00:01:45,Locks them before me in Glasgow actually.
00:01:45,00:01:46,">> Wait, so we're- >> [LAUGH]"
00:01:46,00:01:50,">> Yes, all of Beethoven's very uncatchy tunes, like da, da, da, da."
00:01:50,00:01:53,">> Come on, that's the only one."
00:01:53,00:01:54,>> It's a pretty solid riff.
00:01:54,00:01:56,">> I'm sorry, I disagree with that completely."
00:01:56,00:02:00,"Just on this study of the Beethoven's sort of DNA that they study,"
00:02:00,00:02:02,they had a lock of hair from Beethoven.
00:02:02,00:02:04,"And in fact, they had eight locks of hair."
00:02:04,00:02:05,This was really exciting.
00:02:05,00:02:08,But only five of them were genetically identical.
00:02:08,00:02:11,>> So what does that mean?
00:02:11,00:02:12,>> Three of them were fake.
00:02:12,00:02:13,">> Oh, they were fake."
00:02:13,00:02:17,He wasn't like some kind of Chimera who was half-baked-hoven half someone else.
00:02:17,00:02:18,"What was it, the dog-bate-hoven?"
00:02:18,00:02:20,>> It was the dog-bate-hoven.
00:02:20,00:02:21,>> Yeah.
00:02:21,00:02:24,">> There was one lock of hair which turned out to be from a woman, and"
00:02:24,00:02:28,"that was the one that said, you've got terrible lead poisoning, so that's not true."
00:02:28,00:02:31,"But the thing they found, which is exciting, is that they've studied some"
00:02:31,00:02:35,"modern Beethoven's, and they've studied the identical locks of hair from him."
00:02:35,00:02:38,And they found that the Y chromosome is different between the two.
00:02:38,00:02:41,"And what that means is that in his family line somewhere,"
00:02:41,00:02:44,there is an extra pair paternity event.
00:02:44,00:02:46,>> Okay.
00:02:46,00:02:48,">> Yeah, someone's been playing a false note."
00:02:48,00:02:53,">> Yeah. >> Yes, anyway."
00:02:53,00:02:55,>> Dave Grohl of his day.
00:02:55,00:02:57,>> Wow.
00:02:57,00:03:02,"Can I ask, do we know if it was head hair or hand hair?"
00:03:02,00:03:02,>> I don't know.
00:03:02,00:03:03,>> I assume head hair.
00:03:03,00:03:05,">> Yeah, I'm assuming head hair as well."
00:03:05,00:03:08,">> Not everyone's hands are as pursuit as yours are, dad."
00:03:08,00:03:11,">> Well, mine, I've got a bit of hair, but apparently he was like,"
00:03:11,00:03:15,he looked like Wolfman according to some reports I read.
00:03:15,00:03:18,"Yeah, and so if you were gonna see if he was musically talented,"
00:03:18,00:03:21,maybe it was more on that hand hair than it was the head hair.
00:03:21,00:03:22,>> Cuz that's where the jeans would be.
00:03:22,00:03:26,"They would be in the fingers there, wouldn't they?"
00:03:26,00:03:29,"Was it, were these the hairs that, I mean, I don't know where these ones came from,"
00:03:29,00:03:33,but I know about one person who's stashed a load of Beethoven hair.
00:03:33,00:03:36,"A musician called Ferdinand Hiller, and when you were a fanboy in the olden days,"
00:03:36,00:03:39,you snipped hair off dead people that you liked.
00:03:39,00:03:39,">> Right, okay, yeah, right."
00:03:39,00:03:40,>> Was that from him?
00:03:40,00:03:43,And what I like about this is that every strand of hair was counted.
00:03:43,00:03:49,"It was 582 strands, and they were bought by a urologist."
00:03:49,00:03:50,And do you remember?
00:03:50,00:03:55,">> Yes, yeah, he's the guy with most, he gets constantly approached to"
00:03:55,00:03:57,get DNA analysis done on the strands of hair that he has.
00:03:57,00:04:01,">> He does, but wasn't it also a urologist who collected Napoleon's penis?"
00:04:01,00:04:02,">> Yes, it was."
00:04:02,00:04:05,">> Yes, urologist, something weird about them."
00:04:05,00:04:06,">> Wow, that's interesting."
00:04:06,00:04:07,">> Anyway, yeah."
00:04:07,00:04:10,">> Could you, in theory, with the Beethoven hair that we have,"
00:04:10,00:04:15,could you stretch them and make a sort of very tiny piano using the hair as?
00:04:15,00:04:17,">> I don't think so, I think they'd snap."
00:04:17,00:04:18,>> But a tiny piano.
00:04:18,00:04:20,">> Yeah, come on, James."
00:04:20,00:04:23,No one's gonna hold you to this if you say it's possible.
00:04:23,00:04:26,">> I just think if I say it, then that is on our next target,"
00:04:26,00:04:27,"we're gonna go, where's my fucking piano?"
00:04:27,00:04:30,"Yeah, okay, sure."
00:04:30,00:04:33,">> Okay, you've just made him happy."
00:04:33,00:04:34,>> There we go.
00:04:34,00:04:37,Can we talk about- >> I'm kind of enjoying the whole piano.
00:04:37,00:04:38,">> I'm sorry, yeah."
00:04:38,00:04:40,">> No, no, go on, what were you gonna say?"
00:04:40,00:04:45,">> Yeah, going deaf, going deaf by the age of 30, he could not hear conversation."
00:04:45,00:04:50,"And that was at a period where he was composing most of his, most amazing music."
00:04:50,00:04:54,"And this is just, it's so interesting because one of the things he did was,"
00:04:54,00:04:57,we know how he communicated because he had conversation books.
00:04:57,00:04:59,This is so interesting that they survive.
00:04:59,00:05:00,>> So what's that?
00:05:00,00:05:03,">> Well, if you're Beethoven, you carry a notebook."
00:05:03,00:05:05,">> Okay. >> And if someone wants to ask you a question,"
00:05:05,00:05:07,"they write it down in your notebook, and then you answer it."
00:05:07,00:05:10,"So we have a list of questions that Beethoven was asked, and"
00:05:10,00:05:13,we don't have any of his answers.
00:05:13,00:05:15,It's exactly the wrong way around.
00:05:15,00:05:17,">> No, no, no."
00:05:17,00:05:18,>> And sometimes we have his shopping lists as well.
00:05:18,00:05:21,That is less revealing about the mind of a genius.
00:05:21,00:05:24,"And then the thing was, he had a secretary called Anton Schindler,"
00:05:24,00:05:26,who became kind of the keeper of his flame.
00:05:26,00:05:30,"And he was his first biographer, and he was very, very much,"
00:05:30,00:05:31,he sort of wanted to keep this to himself.
00:05:31,00:05:35,"So he would answer the door wearing Beethoven's old dressing gown, pretty creepy."
00:05:35,00:05:39,But what we also found was he had a lot of these conversation books.
00:05:39,00:05:42,"And if he found a blank page in one of them,"
00:05:42,00:05:45,he would just forge an entry himself.
00:05:45,00:05:46,">> Oh, really?"
00:05:46,00:05:48,>> Quite frustrating for biographers.
00:05:48,00:05:51,Because they've only just done handwriting analysis and worked out.
00:05:51,00:05:53,"Yeah, some of this is lies that were never asked."
00:05:53,00:05:56,">> But I guess, yeah, he is only forging the questions."
00:05:56,00:05:59,">> Yes, unless he's writing an interesting shopping list."
00:05:59,00:06:02,">> Well, they might be, they can tell a lot of shopping lists."
00:06:02,00:06:07,"And actually, you can read a lot from the conversation books by what the people are asking him."
00:06:07,00:06:08,"Like, there's a really nice one."
00:06:08,00:06:09,"He was very, very close to his nephew."
00:06:09,00:06:13,"We might go on to talk about his relationship with Carl, his nephew."
00:06:13,00:06:16,"But he was very close to Carl, and they were in a restaurant one day."
00:06:16,00:06:19,"And this is in 1818, which is when he just started to do these conversation books."
00:06:19,00:06:21,And we have Carl's question to him.
00:06:21,00:06:24,Just because you eat sausages by taking the casing off and
00:06:24,00:06:28,"only eating the meat inside, it doesn't mean I have to, is he?"
00:06:28,00:06:31,">> And Beethoven said, that's not a question."
00:06:31,00:06:33,>> [LAUGH]
00:06:33,00:06:35,>> That's really funny.
00:06:35,00:06:36,">> He did have, you compared him to Mozart, James."
00:06:36,00:06:41,"And he did have this sort of sad relationship with Mozart, or"
00:06:41,00:06:46,"connection to Mozart, because Mozart very famously, child prodigy, very pushy dad."
00:06:46,00:06:51,And Beethoven's dad really wanted Beethoven to be the next Mozart.
00:06:51,00:06:53,"He was called Johann, he was a court musician."
00:06:53,00:06:56,So he expected that one of his kids would go into music.
00:06:56,00:07:00,"He realized Beethoven was quite good, but he used to lock him in the basement."
00:07:00,00:07:02,He'd drag him out of bed in the middle of the night and
00:07:02,00:07:05,force him to play piano over and over again.
00:07:05,00:07:10,"He beat him a lot, he was a very unpleasant person, it sounds like."
00:07:10,00:07:14,Desperate to make him rich and famous because of being so talented.
00:07:14,00:07:18,"And also, he convinced Beethoven that he was two years younger than he was."
00:07:18,00:07:19,"So for years of his life,"
00:07:19,00:07:23,"Beethoven thought that he was born in 1772, because his dad was so"
00:07:23,00:07:26,desperate to make him this child prodigy.
00:07:26,00:07:28,">> There's a story that he did meet Beethoven as well,"
00:07:28,00:07:30,that he was presented to him as this.
00:07:30,00:07:35,And Mozart was really pissed off that he was having to break away from
00:07:35,00:07:38,"his personal writing to meet this kid that everyone was saying,"
00:07:38,00:07:39,"well, he might be really good."
00:07:39,00:07:42,He sits down and he starts playing a piece by Mozart to him.
00:07:42,00:07:44,"And Mozart says, stop that, I want to hear what you've got."
00:07:44,00:07:47,And he plays a little in original piece.
00:07:47,00:07:50,"And supposedly, Mozart did the old, you got it kid."
00:07:50,00:07:52,"And everyone was like, whoa, he's got it."
00:07:52,00:07:56,And so that was like a seal of approval kind of thing.
00:07:56,00:07:57,">> Yeah, so watch out for this guy."
00:07:57,00:07:59,">> We're still in Vienna, are we?"
00:07:59,00:08:03,>> Feels like we've moved to California at some stage.
00:08:03,00:08:05,">> Now, you know what Billy Joel brings someone up to play the piano and"
00:08:05,00:08:08,"afterwards he's like, watch out for this guy, he's going to be making."
00:08:08,00:08:10,"No, you don't watch YouTube clips like that?"
00:08:10,00:08:11,Okay.
00:08:11,00:08:14,">> Are you saying, do you think Mozart said that to literally everyone?"
00:08:14,00:08:16,"Every kid who came along, he went, watch out for this kid."
00:08:16,00:08:18,">> Yeah, well, this guy."
00:08:18,00:08:20,">> So he did nine symphonies, didn't he?"
00:08:20,00:08:25,And the ninth one was the one when he was really deaf and he was conducting.
00:08:25,00:08:28,"And there was another conductor on the side because he was conducting,"
00:08:28,00:08:29,he couldn't hear what was happening.
00:08:29,00:08:31,So he's just basically waving his arms.
00:08:31,00:08:34,"And all of the people in the orchestra were told to watch the other guy,"
00:08:34,00:08:38,"basically, and then as soon as the symphony finished,"
00:08:38,00:08:42,he was carrying on conducting because he didn't realize it had finished.
00:08:42,00:08:45,">> What a shame, if you just had to follow what he was doing,"
00:08:45,00:08:48,you would have gone an original Beethoven piece and
00:08:48,00:08:50,it would have just kept going and kept going.
00:08:50,00:08:53,And that would have been one of the most amazing nights of music ever.
00:08:53,00:08:54,>> You say that?
00:08:54,00:08:58,>> Yeah. >> One of the worst nights of live music ever
00:08:58,00:09:03,"was in 1808, Christmas in Vienna, picture the scene."
00:09:03,00:09:07,"It's frosty, sparkling, it's beautiful, these incredible buildings everywhere."
00:09:07,00:09:10,It was the marathon performance of Beethoven's new stuff.
00:09:10,00:09:17,"And we're talking the premiere of Beethoven's fifth, premiere of the sixth."
00:09:17,00:09:20,"No gap, just straight on through, here's another symphony."
00:09:20,00:09:24,"Choral fantasy, another piano concerto, four hours of music."
00:09:24,00:09:25,>> My God.
00:09:25,00:09:25,>> Bit long.
00:09:25,00:09:27,>> [LAUGH]
00:09:27,00:09:30,>> It's like when Stuart Lee does back-to-back shows in one evening.
00:09:30,00:09:34,>> It was a complete disaster on the night because all the best musicians
00:09:34,00:09:38,"in town had a rival booking, so they couldn't come and play."
00:09:38,00:09:40,So the orchestra was a bit of a scratch job.
00:09:40,00:09:44,"And it was extremely cold, the critics hated it."
00:09:44,00:09:48,"One piece, they hadn't rehearsed it enough, the choir just sang it wrong, and"
00:09:48,00:09:52,"he had to stop the whole gig and say, no, no, no, we need to go back to the beginning."
00:09:52,00:09:54,"It was just a total fiasco of it, yeah, it was a nightmare."
00:09:54,00:09:58,">> So then he did his night symphony, and then he started his tenth."
00:09:58,00:10:01,"But he never completed the tenth, he died before he completed it."
00:10:01,00:10:06,But luckily AI has completed it in 2021.
00:10:06,00:10:10,"And the piece had its world premiere in Bonn in Germany, apparently it's very good."
00:10:10,00:10:12,"Unfortunately, you need six fingers to play it."
00:10:12,00:10:15,>> [LAUGH]
00:10:15,00:10:16,">> Any good, what are the critics saying?"
00:10:16,00:10:20,">> Yeah, it's fine, sounds a bit like Beethoven."
00:10:20,00:10:21,">> Fine, what a review."
00:10:21,00:10:22,>> That's what you want.
00:10:22,00:10:25,">> Beethoven, by the way, his name means vegetable garden."
00:10:25,00:10:26,>> Cool.
00:10:26,00:10:31,>> And his full name Ludwig van Beethoven means loud fight in the vegetable garden.
00:10:31,00:10:33,>> [LAUGH]
00:10:33,00:10:35,>> Which is what a lot of his music sounds like.
00:10:35,00:10:40,"No, I think he's brilliant, he just doesn't write melody."
00:10:40,00:10:41,But do you know what his last words were?
00:10:41,00:10:43,>> The two versions of it or something.
00:10:43,00:10:46,">> So Beethoven famously died during a thunderstorm,"
00:10:46,00:10:49,"quite cool, quite classic, Beethoven."
00:10:49,00:10:53,"And his last words were, pity, pity, too late."
00:10:53,00:10:56,Because he'd just been informed that he'd received a gift from his publisher of
00:10:56,00:10:57,12 bottles of wine.
00:10:57,00:11:01,>> Which I know the saddest thing about his life.
00:11:01,00:11:02,>> They won't be your last words.
00:11:02,00:11:04,>> [LAUGH]
00:11:04,00:11:05,>> Start opening them now.
00:11:05,00:11:07,>> [LAUGH]
00:11:07,00:11:10,>> We're gonna go half an hour- >> Don't let them breathe.
00:11:10,00:11:15,[MUSIC]
00:11:15,00:11:19,">> It is time for fact number two, and that is Andy."
00:11:19,00:11:24,>> My fact is that one of Scotland's most eminent 19th century illustrators
00:11:24,00:11:26,was called Willie Hull.
00:11:26,00:11:28,>> [LAUGH]
00:11:28,00:11:29,>> Here you go.
00:11:29,00:11:29,>> That's him there.
00:11:29,00:11:31,">> And there he is, in all its glory."
00:11:31,00:11:32,">> Why is that interesting, Andy?"
00:11:32,00:11:34,>> Why is that interesting?
00:11:34,00:11:36,>> I think- >> I think he's an under-celebrated artist.
00:11:36,00:11:38,">> Okay, yeah."
00:11:38,00:11:40,>> You're bringing him to life today.
00:11:40,00:11:41,>> Absolutely.
00:11:41,00:11:44,>> I think this is the most immature fact.
00:11:44,00:11:45,>> [LAUGH]
00:11:45,00:11:47,">> And you know what, I thought it would be James."
00:11:47,00:11:51,My money was on James for the fact that it's just a rude name.
00:11:51,00:11:56,">> I'm sorry, I do feel a bit ashamed, but I also feel thrilled that we've talked about him."
00:11:56,00:11:58,>> He was called William Hull.
00:11:58,00:12:00,">> But in day-to-day life, who's got the time?"
00:12:00,00:12:02,>> [LAUGH]
00:12:02,00:12:05,">> I'll challenge you, Anna, for a more childish fact."
00:12:05,00:12:07,His dad was called Dick Hull.
00:12:07,00:12:07,>> Yes.
00:12:07,00:12:09,>> True.
00:12:09,00:12:12,">> Middle name, Richard Brassy Hull."
00:12:12,00:12:12,>> Yeah.
00:12:12,00:12:17,>> And his mother was called Ann Byrne Hull.
00:12:17,00:12:19,This family just had it stitched up.
00:12:19,00:12:20,>> Yeah.
00:12:20,00:12:22,">> How many people here, they didn't have it stitched up?"
00:12:22,00:12:24,>> [LAUGH]
00:12:24,00:12:26,>> Sorry.
00:12:26,00:12:29,>> Who here has heard of Willie Hull?
00:12:29,00:12:32,"And shame on you, actually."
00:12:32,00:12:35,>> Imagine if there'd just been a roar of recognition.
00:12:35,00:12:37,>> This is quite obscure.
00:12:37,00:12:39,">> Well, at the time, he was very eminent."
00:12:39,00:12:42,He was a member of the Royal Scottish Academy.
00:12:42,00:12:46,"He illustrated books for Robert Burns, for J.M."
00:12:46,00:12:48,"Barry, Robert Louis Stevenson."
00:12:48,00:12:50,"I know they weren't all alive at the same time, but he was alive at the time."
00:12:50,00:12:54,So he lived from 1846 to 1917.
00:12:54,00:12:56,"And I just think, under celebrated."
00:12:56,00:12:58,">> And don't confuse him with another Willie Hull,"
00:12:58,00:13:02,who was a person who designed all of England's coins and James the First.
00:13:02,00:13:03,>> Yes.
00:13:03,00:13:03,>> Yes.
00:13:03,00:13:06,">> And he, Proto Willie Hull, he was amazing."
00:13:06,00:13:06,>> [LAUGH]
00:13:06,00:13:10,">> Because I think, was it him, James, who would have been the same time?"
00:13:10,00:13:13,>> He invented the colouring inbook.
00:13:13,00:13:13,>> [LAUGH]
00:13:13,00:13:14,>> Really?
00:13:14,00:13:14,>> Yes.
00:13:14,00:13:16,>> He published the series of maps.
00:13:16,00:13:18,"There was this poem called Poly Albion,"
00:13:18,00:13:20,which was about all the parts of England and Scotland.
00:13:20,00:13:23,"And it was, there was the beautiful maps of weird things."
00:13:23,00:13:27,"The rivers were all on there, and there were weird mythical beasts all over the map."
00:13:27,00:13:31,And it was fashionable to hand colour your own maps back in the day.
00:13:31,00:13:31,>> Wow.
00:13:31,00:13:33,>> And that was a big trend in the 1620s.
00:13:33,00:13:36,"Gentleman's manual said, if you're going to be a proper gentleman,"
00:13:36,00:13:37,you've got to know how to colour in.
00:13:37,00:13:37,>> Right.
00:13:37,00:13:39,>> [LAUGH]
00:13:39,00:13:39,>> That's amazing.
00:13:39,00:13:40,>> Don't go over the lines.
00:13:40,00:13:42,>> If you want an eligible lady to marry you.
00:13:42,00:13:43,>> Yeah.
00:13:43,00:13:45,"We also shouldn't forget William J. Hull,"
00:13:45,00:13:49,"Willie Hull Jr., the American film director,"
00:13:49,00:13:52,"mainly known for his B movies, really amazing."
00:13:52,00:13:56,"He did a movie called Hellbound, which he made for producer Howard Koch."
00:13:56,00:13:58,>> No.
00:13:58,00:14:02,">> Yeah, and then he did Speed Crazy in 1959, which starred Charles Wilcox."
00:14:02,00:14:06,">> So this is just going to be our sort of listing people with rude names, is it?"
00:14:06,00:14:08,">> Well, I actually looked to the Wikipedia list that's called-"
00:14:08,00:14:09,">> Right, okay, great."
00:14:09,00:14:10,>> Other people who are called Willie.
00:14:10,00:14:12,>> [LAUGH]
00:14:12,00:14:15,">> Yeah, there's over 218 notable Willys out there."
00:14:15,00:14:19,You've got the professional golfer in America called Willie Tucker.
00:14:19,00:14:21,>> Lovely.
00:14:21,00:14:23,>> There's- >> [LAUGH]
00:14:23,00:14:24,>> And does that help in golf?
00:14:24,00:14:25,"James, you play golf."
00:14:25,00:14:26,>> It can get in the way of your swings.
00:14:26,00:14:27,">> Yeah, yeah."
00:14:27,00:14:28,>> [LAUGH]
00:14:28,00:14:31,>> There's the Austrian footballer called Willie Fitz.
00:14:31,00:14:33,>> [LAUGH]
00:14:33,00:14:35,>> There's the Kenyan runner called Willie Cumming.
00:14:35,00:14:36,>> [LAUGH]
00:14:36,00:14:37,">> Brilliant, super."
00:14:37,00:14:38,">> Nice, yeah."
00:14:38,00:14:40,>> That's all my research for the time.
00:14:40,00:14:41,>> [LAUGH]
00:14:41,00:14:43,">> The history of illustration, no."
00:14:43,00:14:46,">> Yeah, I've got some quite dry stuff on the difference between a wood block and"
00:14:46,00:14:47,a wood cutting.
00:14:47,00:14:48,>> That's what we want.
00:14:48,00:14:52,">> But- >> But no, this one, so William Hall was at"
00:14:52,00:14:55,the tail end of a period where basically illustration was the only means of getting
00:14:55,00:14:58,"any visual information to anyone else, as in-"
00:14:58,00:15:00,">> There was no YouTube, no TikTok."
00:15:00,00:15:02,>> There was no TikTok.
00:15:02,00:15:06,"That was in the 1870s after his period, no."
00:15:06,00:15:10,"And basically, it was hugely important and usually legally contentious as well."
00:15:10,00:15:11,">> Oh, really?"
00:15:11,00:15:13,">> So yeah, I was reading about James Gilray,"
00:15:13,00:15:16,who was the sort of the most famous artist of the early 19th century.
00:15:16,00:15:17,>> Right. >> Who did caricatures.
00:15:17,00:15:21,But they were so offensive and insulting that he was charged with blasphemy.
00:15:21,00:15:22,>> Wow.
00:15:22,00:15:25,">> That was, he drew the wise men and he was charged with blasphemy."
00:15:25,00:15:29,"Actually, the real reason was that the Prince of Wales was clearly in the picture."
00:15:29,00:15:31,"Being, you know- >> As one of the wise men or"
00:15:31,00:15:33,"just like popping up behind, like he's photo bombed."
00:15:33,00:15:36,>> There was a disgusting baby in there and there was all sorts of-
00:15:36,00:15:37,>> Jesus.
00:15:37,00:15:40,">> So I mean, sorry, in the drawing, in the drawing."
00:15:40,00:15:42,>> Sorry about being arrested for blasphemy.
00:15:42,00:15:46,">> Sorry, in the satirical drawing."
00:15:46,00:15:48,"I'm not afraid of blasphemy charges, am I?"
00:15:48,00:15:49,>> Yeah.
00:15:49,00:15:52,">> But basically, and you know, he was interviewed by George Canning."
00:15:52,00:15:57,"He was later the prime minister saying, look, I want a caricature of me."
00:15:57,00:16:00,"And so the charge against him, the blasphemy charge was dropped and"
00:16:00,00:16:02,he was given a government pension.
00:16:02,00:16:06,Gilray is the man who was responsible for everyone thinking that Napoleon was short.
00:16:06,00:16:07,">> Oh, really?"
00:16:07,00:16:08,>> He was short.
00:16:08,00:16:09,Napoleon was normal height.
00:16:09,00:16:13,"It's entirely thanks to someone drawing him 200 years ago,"
00:16:13,00:16:14,that we think Napoleon Bonaparte was short.
00:16:14,00:16:15,>> That's so interesting.
00:16:15,00:16:19,">> So that's the power these images had, just repeated and amplified and caricatured."
00:16:19,00:16:20,>> Yeah. >> Wouldn't influence.
00:16:20,00:16:23,">> So Willy Hall, he did caricatures of quite famous people, right?"
00:16:23,00:16:26,"Like he did, I think, Jay and Barry and a few people like that."
00:16:26,00:16:30,">> I think he mostly did work, as in he mostly would, Jay and Barry's books,"
00:16:30,00:16:31,he would illustrate those.
00:16:31,00:16:33,">> So not the author's illustrations, right?"
00:16:33,00:16:33,>> I don't think so.
00:16:33,00:16:38,"He illustrated Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde for Robert Louis Stevenson, and kidnapped."
00:16:38,00:16:42,I read that Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde was written in six days and
00:16:42,00:16:45,six nights while Louis Stevenson was on a cocaine bender.
00:16:45,00:16:47,>> Yeah.
00:16:47,00:16:52,">> And according to Robert Louis Stevenson.com, that's a myth."
00:16:52,00:16:55,">> No, well, they would say that, wouldn't they?"
00:16:55,00:16:56,">> Yeah, he feels like it."
00:16:56,00:16:59,They said that he was on medication.
00:16:59,00:17:03,">> Yeah, but there's no evidence that he took cocaine for recreational purposes."
00:17:03,00:17:07,">> Willy Hall's grandmother, or great-grandmother, was Jamaican."
00:17:07,00:17:10,">> Okay. >> Just very, just unusual to have"
00:17:10,00:17:12,a mixed-race couple in the 1790s.
00:17:12,00:17:16,But his Scottish father married a Jamaican woman in the 1790s.
00:17:16,00:17:21,And the resulting child went on to be the first student of African descent at
00:17:21,00:17:25,"the University of Edinburgh, and then governor of Sierra Leone."
00:17:25,00:17:27,"And that's Willy Hall, that's my Willy Hall fact."
00:17:27,00:17:28,>> It's good.
00:17:28,00:17:29,">> It's not about, it's not about a funny name."
00:17:29,00:17:31,>> But we're all learning.
00:17:31,00:17:34,>> But we're all learning something.
00:17:34,00:17:36,>> Can I tell you maybe my favorite artist of the period?
00:17:36,00:17:38,"So George Cruikshank, right?"
00:17:38,00:17:44,"Again, hugely influential caricaturist, satirist, drew outrageous things."
00:17:44,00:17:48,"He once got a bribe of 100 quid from the king himself,"
00:17:48,00:17:52,saying please do not caricature his majesty in any immoral situation.
00:17:52,00:17:55,So that's how powerful he was at the time.
00:17:55,00:18:00,"Imagine if the current king paid, I don't know, Michael McIntyre not to do any jokes about him."
00:18:00,00:18:04,>> Is Michael McIntyre known as the most hardcore political satirist of our day?
00:18:04,00:18:06,>> [LAUGH]
00:18:06,00:18:08,">> Okay, Anton Deck, fine, whatever."
00:18:08,00:18:11,>> [LAUGH]
00:18:11,00:18:13,">> But he was a dreadful guy, Cruikshank, in his personal life."
00:18:13,00:18:16,So he ill-treated his wife quite badly.
00:18:16,00:18:19,"He was an avowed anti-drink campaigner, right?"
00:18:19,00:18:24,"So he looked strict, strict, strict, because his father had died of alcohol poisoning."
00:18:24,00:18:28,He'd just won a drinking contest and then died his father.
00:18:28,00:18:29,>> All right.
00:18:29,00:18:30,">> Died happy, though, at least."
00:18:30,00:18:31,>> It's like the second worst result possible.
00:18:31,00:18:35,">> That feels like a disqualification after the match, right?"
00:18:35,00:18:38,"That feels like you gotta live at least a month, post."
00:18:38,00:18:42,">> Yeah, but okay, here's the amazing thing about George Cruikshank, right?"
00:18:42,00:18:44,He was on his deathbed.
00:18:44,00:18:47,">> Yeah. >> And he was talking to his wife,"
00:18:47,00:18:48,who he hadn't been terribly nice to.
00:18:48,00:18:51,"And he said, what will become of my children?"
00:18:52,00:18:55,"And his wife said, what do you mean your children?"
00:18:55,00:18:57,>> We haven't got any children.
00:18:57,00:18:58,Now he had been married once before.
00:18:58,00:18:59,>> Uh-huh.
00:18:59,00:19:01,>> That marriage hadn't produced any children either.
00:19:01,00:19:05,">> Well, it turned out, this is spicy gossip time."
00:19:05,00:19:07,>> [LAUGH]
00:19:07,00:19:09,>> It turned out he had been leading a secret double life.
00:19:09,00:19:13,And he had mistress with whom he had had 11 children.
00:19:13,00:19:14,>> Whoa.
00:19:14,00:19:15,>> [LAUGH]
00:19:15,00:19:19,>> The last of whom was conceived when he was 82 years old.
00:19:19,00:19:20,>> [LAUGH]
00:19:20,00:19:21,>> Can you imagine?
00:19:21,00:19:24,">> Yeah. >> I'm just popping out, whatever."
00:19:24,00:19:26,">> It's so funny, his obituary said,"
00:19:26,00:19:30,"there never was a purer, simpler, more blameless man."
00:19:30,00:19:32,"Something childlike in his transparency a week later,"
00:19:32,00:19:34,the will was read out to which he left all of his money to his.
00:19:34,00:19:35,>> My gosh.
00:19:35,00:19:36,>> That's amazing.
00:19:36,00:19:39,">> You know, there's only one image of Shakespeare that we have."
00:19:39,00:19:40,">> Okay, yeah, yeah."
00:19:40,00:19:43,>> It's done by an engraver called Martin Droshoot.
00:19:43,00:19:45,He was a Flemish.
00:19:45,00:19:46,"And it's kind of, you'll see it."
00:19:46,00:19:49,"Like, if you ever see a picture on an old book of Shakespeare,"
00:19:49,00:19:52,"it's the one that you see, which is like black and white."
00:19:52,00:19:55,">> Yeah, he's bold, he's got a pair on sides, yeah."
00:19:55,00:19:59,">> Now, it turns out that Martin Droshoot was a terrible, terrible drawer."
00:19:59,00:20:02,"Like, he was really, really bad."
00:20:02,00:20:06,"And we only have one other portrait that he did, Francisco de la Pena."
00:20:06,00:20:09,And it looks almost identical to the one he did of Shakespeare.
00:20:09,00:20:10,>> Yeah.
00:20:10,00:20:13,>> And it seems like he only really knew how to draw one person.
00:20:13,00:20:18,">> My God, so we don't know how likely it is that this actually looked like Shakespeare at all."
00:20:18,00:20:22,">> Yeah, he actually had a Mahecan, according to sort of the time."
00:20:22,00:20:25,"Did you know, speaking of the influence that illustrators have,"
00:20:25,00:20:28,it was an illustrator who invented macaroni.
00:20:28,00:20:30,Or who popularized macaroni.
00:20:30,00:20:32,">> Okay, the pasta?"
00:20:32,00:20:33,Or the penguin?
00:20:33,00:20:37,">> No, if you're being pedantic, neither, the pasta, nor the penguins."
00:20:37,00:20:38,">> It was like a look, wasn't it?"
00:20:38,00:20:39,">> A dandy, yeah."
00:20:39,00:20:41,">> A dandy, yes."
00:20:41,00:20:46,"This, so a macaroni in England in the 1770s and '80s was,"
00:20:46,00:20:49,there was a fashion for men to be really effeminate.
00:20:49,00:20:51,"They had, like, huge hair."
00:20:51,00:20:54,"They particularly had massive hair, and then they wore a tiny hat on top."
00:20:54,00:20:56,Which is so cool.
00:20:56,00:21:02,"And sort of striped stockings and really tight pants and fancy walking sticks, bright colors."
00:21:02,00:21:05,"Anyway, there's a woman called Mary Dali."
00:21:05,00:21:08,"In fact, it was a husband and wife team, Matthew and Mary Dali."
00:21:08,00:21:10,And Mary was the real caricature.
00:21:10,00:21:14,"She sort of made caricaturing a thing, invented the art of caricaturing,"
00:21:14,00:21:16,like exaggerating these effects.
00:21:16,00:21:21,"And they made their name by having the macaroni print shop on the strand,"
00:21:21,00:21:25,"where she basically drew caricatures of all these effeminate men,"
00:21:25,00:21:27,"created, popularized the macaroni."
00:21:27,00:21:28,>> Yeah.
00:21:28,00:21:29,>> You spoke about dandies before.
00:21:29,00:21:34,"Of course, the dandy is a Scottish illustration of sorts."
00:21:34,00:21:35,>> Okay. >> What a great link.
00:21:35,00:21:36,>> Thank you.
00:21:36,00:21:39,>> Just leapfrogging from the 1760s to the 20th century comic book.
00:21:39,00:21:40,>> That was very impressive.
00:21:40,00:21:42,>> Made by DC Thompson.
00:21:42,00:21:45,"And DC Thompson is also home to the world's oldest magazine,"
00:21:45,00:21:47,the Scots magazine.
00:21:47,00:21:51,"And in one of the early issues, they had a first-hand account of the Battle"
00:21:51,00:21:51,of Culloden.
00:21:51,00:21:54,>> Really?
00:21:54,00:21:56,>> That's how old that is.
00:21:56,00:21:58,">> Wait, sorry, that wasn't the first issue of the dandy."
00:21:58,00:21:59,">> No. >> No, sorry."
00:21:59,00:22:00,>> Sorry.
00:22:00,00:22:03,>> That was in DC Thompson.
00:22:03,00:22:04,">> Because it's desperate down, I've been on site."
00:22:04,00:22:05,It could have gone the other way.
00:22:05,00:22:06,>> Yeah.
00:22:06,00:22:10,"What was, can I, sorry to be ignorant, but what was the Battle of Culloga?"
00:22:10,00:22:13,>> That is.
00:22:13,00:22:15,>> Why don't you just ask someone in the street later on?
00:22:15,00:22:17,>> Okay.
00:22:17,00:22:18,I don't know what's known here.
00:22:18,00:22:20,"You don't know who Willie Hole is, but you know that battle that's going on."
00:22:20,00:22:23,">> I'll tell you, I will tell you later, and I will tell you at some length."
00:22:23,00:22:24,But it's really interesting.
00:22:24,00:22:29,">> But on the subject of comics and DC Thompson stuff,"
00:22:29,00:22:33,I thought we could have a quick game of comic strip or darts nickname.
00:22:33,00:22:34,">> Oh, okay."
00:22:34,00:22:37,>> Because I realized that some of these comic strips have kind of got similar
00:22:37,00:22:39,names to the darts players.
00:22:39,00:22:41,">> Oh, like Calamity James."
00:22:41,00:22:42,>> Is a darts player?
00:22:42,00:22:44,No.
00:22:44,00:22:49,">> So for instance, Bow and Arrow, B-E-A-U and Arrow."
00:22:49,00:22:52,Is that the name of a comic or is it the name of a darts player's nickname?
00:22:52,00:22:56,>> It must be darts player because what is a dart but a tiny arrow.
00:22:56,00:22:58,">> Well, it's got to be a comic book, otherwise you wouldn't have presented it"
00:22:58,00:23:00,and tried to trick us into thinking it was a darts.
00:23:00,00:23:02,>> Do you get tag teams in darts?
00:23:02,00:23:06,">> You can't have doubles, but it's true."
00:23:06,00:23:10,>> You chuck it halfway along the distance and they lean over and hammer it at home.
00:23:10,00:23:18,">> Yeah, no, you lift your arm up and Bow pulls it back and releases you."
00:23:18,00:23:22,>> The answer is it was a double bluff and it's Bow Graves who's the current
00:23:22,00:23:25,back-to-back two-time ladies world champion.
00:23:25,00:23:26,>> Okay.
00:23:26,00:23:27,>> It's a darts player.
00:23:27,00:23:28,Dirty Dick.
00:23:28,00:23:29,>> Oh.
00:23:29,00:23:30,>> Darts player or comic book.
00:23:30,00:23:31,>> I feel it seemed to be a comic.
00:23:31,00:23:32,I'm going to say darts player.
00:23:32,00:23:33,>> Yeah.
00:23:33,00:23:34,>> Dirty Dick.
00:23:34,00:23:35,>> Comic.
00:23:35,00:23:36,">> Yeah, comic."
00:23:36,00:23:42,>> It was a character from the dandy known as a boy who generally is in need of a good
00:23:42,00:23:43,scrub.
00:23:43,00:23:46,>> What about this one?
00:23:46,00:23:47,Master Bates.
00:23:47,00:23:53,>> I always thought that Master Bates was the myth from Pugwash that claimed that it
00:23:53,00:23:54,was --
00:23:54,00:23:55,>> And it was never actually a Master Bates.
00:23:55,00:23:57,">> Yeah, so you go for darts player?"
00:23:57,00:23:58,>> Yeah.
00:23:58,00:24:01,">> Well, the truth is technically it's both."
00:24:01,00:24:06,Because there was a character in Oliver Twist called Bates who's sometimes called Master
00:24:06,00:24:07,Bates.
00:24:07,00:24:09,And there is quite a few etchings of Master Bates.
00:24:09,00:24:13,But also it was the nickname of darts player Owen Bates.
00:24:13,00:24:14,He's known as the master.
00:24:14,00:24:19,>> He always has one hand in his pocket when he's playing.
00:24:19,00:24:21,>> He always has it on his back.
00:24:21,00:24:23,It says Owen the Master Bates.
00:24:23,00:24:26,But when he qualified for the world championships they didn't allow him to use it.
00:24:26,00:24:27,>> That's fair enough.
00:24:27,00:24:32,>> You don't want to bring the noble sport of darts into disrepute.
00:24:32,00:24:40,>> It is time for fact number three.
00:24:40,00:24:42,And that is my fact.
00:24:42,00:24:49,"My fact this week is that the title ""Prince of Thinkers"" was awarded in France to a philosopher"
00:24:49,00:24:55,whose greatest published work claimed humans were descended from frogs.
00:24:55,00:25:02,"I'm sure you've all, like Willie Hull, have heard of Jean-Pierre Bresset."
00:25:02,00:25:05,This is a guy who was a philosopher.
00:25:05,00:25:06,He was a writer.
00:25:06,00:25:07,He was a thinker.
00:25:07,00:25:08,He was a bit of an outsider.
00:25:08,00:25:13,"He lived basically in the same bracket as Willie Hull, by the way, year-wise."
00:25:13,00:25:14,>> Time-wise.
00:25:14,00:25:17,">> Yeah, Willie Hull was born 1846, died 1917."
00:25:17,00:25:21,Jean-Pierre was 1837 to 1919.
00:25:21,00:25:22,">> Did they ever meet, do we know?"
00:25:22,00:25:24,">> Oh, good question."
00:25:24,00:25:26,">> No, they obviously didn't."
00:25:26,00:25:27,">> Yeah, they didn't."
00:25:27,00:25:29,He was a fascinating guy.
00:25:29,00:25:35,"The first thing that he wrote was a thing called ""Learning the Art of Swimming Alone"
00:25:35,00:25:36,"in Less Than an Hour."""
00:25:36,00:25:37,>> That's fantastic.
00:25:37,00:25:40,">> Yeah, it's amazing."
00:25:40,00:25:44,"It's basically five illustrations that show you how in the confines of your home, so it's"
00:25:44,00:25:50,"not even within the water, you can just practice moves hundreds and hundreds of times so that"
00:25:50,00:25:54,"when you eventually jump into the water for the first time, you know, how to swim."
00:25:54,00:25:58,">> If you do it 600 times, basically you know, and then that's it."
00:25:58,00:26:03,"It might be that humans are descended from frog's theory, which we should say now is"
00:26:03,00:26:11,"not true, from, well, hang on, has not yet been proven, but because if you view a swimmer"
00:26:11,00:26:15,"from above and they're doing something like breaststroke, they look a bit like a frog,"
00:26:15,00:26:19,and so that might have linked frogs and humans together in his mind.
00:26:19,00:26:20,>> Really?
00:26:20,00:26:23,">> Yeah, we should say he wasn't an actual proper philosopher."
00:26:23,00:26:29,"He was a nobody, but it's quite amazing how famous he sort of became to a niche bunch"
00:26:29,00:26:30,of people.
00:26:30,00:26:36,So the only reason he became famous was because there was a prank organized by a bunch of
00:26:36,00:26:43,kind of the literati artist led by a guy called Jules Romain who decided to award this Prince
00:26:43,00:26:45,of Thinker's thing.
00:26:45,00:26:47,Jules Romain had come across his book.
00:26:47,00:26:49,"I think he'd just been rifling through a library, hadn't he?"
00:26:49,00:26:50,>> Yeah.
00:26:50,00:26:54,">> So it was like humans are descended from frogs, and the logic was so mad."
00:26:54,00:27:00,"So he believed that any words in a language that sounded like other words, that wasn't"
00:27:00,00:27:03,"a coincidence, that told you something very important."
00:27:03,00:27:09,"So for instance, the word ""ren"" for queen sounds like the old French word ""ren"" for"
00:27:09,00:27:10,frog.
00:27:10,00:27:14,"So he was like, okay, frogs must be really important."
00:27:14,00:27:19,He was then walking past a pond when he noticed not only do frogs look a lot like humans in
00:27:19,00:27:20,their bodies.
00:27:20,00:27:21,So he thought.
00:27:21,00:27:26,"But they also were saying ""go up, go up,"" which is French, of course, for ""what?"""
00:27:26,00:27:27,"""What?"""
00:27:27,00:27:28,>> What?
00:27:28,00:27:29,That's so good.
00:27:29,00:27:33,>> And the idea being that when frogs finally got self-conscious and understood that they
00:27:33,00:27:37,"were part of the world, the first thing that they would say is, ""What?"""
00:27:37,00:27:39,>> There you go.
00:27:39,00:27:40,There you go.
00:27:40,00:27:42,It's all very interesting.
00:27:42,00:27:48,"We should just quickly go back a second on the Prince of Thinker's thing here, because"
00:27:48,00:27:50,it's quite a mean thing that happened.
00:27:50,00:27:55,He was told that this big vote had happened and that he was being made the Prince of
00:27:55,00:28:00,"Thinkers, and they brought him into Paris on a train, and he was met at the station by"
00:28:00,00:28:05,"a group of people, and he was given flowers by children, and some poet had written a very"
00:28:05,00:28:07,special piece specifically for him.
00:28:07,00:28:11,">> He was asked to make a speech in front of the Rodin statue, ""The Thinker,"" of his"
00:28:11,00:28:13,kind of acceptance speech.
00:28:13,00:28:15,It's unbelievably unkind in hindsight.
00:28:15,00:28:22,"Imagine if the most eminent authors in the world invited you, Dan, saying, ""We have"
00:28:22,00:28:28,"Richard Osmond saying it, Dan Brown's in there, McEwan, Ishiguro, all of the biggies."""
00:28:28,00:28:32,"They write to you, Dan, and they say, ""We actually think your book is going to change"
00:28:32,00:28:33,the world.
00:28:33,00:28:34,It's seminal.
00:28:34,00:28:37,Please come to the British Library and stand in front of the statue of Isaac Newton and
00:28:37,00:28:40,"make a speech,"" and then it turns out it was a prank, and they actually think the book"
00:28:40,00:28:41,is rubbish.
00:28:41,00:28:43,That's basically what happened to this guy.
00:28:43,00:28:44,It is cruel.
00:28:44,00:28:45,I think that would be cruel.
00:28:45,00:28:49,"I don't see any evidence that he ever knew, and I think they might have felt a bit bad."
00:28:49,00:28:50,So Jules Romain ...
00:28:50,00:28:51,>> Shit.
00:28:51,00:28:52,It's incredible.
00:28:52,00:28:55,>> It wasn't the newspapers the next day.
00:28:55,00:28:56,>> It was too successful.
00:28:56,00:28:57,It went too well.
00:28:57,00:29:01,"So I think Jules Romain left money for a banquet to be held in his name every year thereafter,"
00:29:01,00:29:06,"and it did go until 1939, possibly because he felt a bit bad about humiliating this guy."
00:29:06,00:29:10,">> To be honest, reading up on it, I'm a bit confused about what they genuinely thought,"
00:29:10,00:29:14,"because if you read Marcel Duchamp writes about it, and he knew of the work of Brisee"
00:29:14,00:29:18,"as well, I think they were taking the piss, and it was elaborate, but they were surrealists,"
00:29:18,00:29:22,"and they were doing a surreal thing here, but I think they admired the thinking."
00:29:22,00:29:26,"I think they genuinely thought, ""This guy is a weird thinker, and we should be celebrating."""
00:29:26,00:29:29,">> They were doing all sorts of stuff like that, weren't they?"
00:29:29,00:29:30,"It was like, ""Found art,"" kind of thing."
00:29:30,00:29:32,"It's like, ""We found this thing."
00:29:32,00:29:34,We're going to turn it into art.
00:29:34,00:29:35,"We're going to turn it into something special."""
00:29:35,00:29:36,>> Yeah.
00:29:36,00:29:40,"I think Richard Osman really liked my book, actually."
00:29:40,00:29:46,"But there were quite a lot of these, what are known in English as ""outside of writers,"""
00:29:46,00:29:51,"and in French as ""fou littoré,"" like means ""mad writers,"" but there were quite a lot"
00:29:51,00:29:53,of them at the time.
00:29:53,00:29:59,"For instance, there was a guy called Alexis Vincent Charles Berbaguier, Newfoundland Time,"
00:29:59,00:30:03,who wrote books about the imps that were following him around.
00:30:03,00:30:08,"His surname, Time, was chosen because he thought that the time the herb repelled the"
00:30:08,00:30:15,"imps, and he planned to plant an enormous time field so that it would repel all of the"
00:30:15,00:30:17,imps.
00:30:17,00:30:20,So that was one of them.
00:30:20,00:30:23,">> I did read about him, because he read that the imps and the leprechauns that followed"
00:30:23,00:30:27,"him around made him sneeze and fart enormously, and that was a huge problem."
00:30:27,00:30:28,">> No, it's not me."
00:30:28,00:30:29,It was the imps.
00:30:29,00:30:32,He wants to buy himself a dog.
00:30:32,00:30:37,"There was a guy called Raymond Russell, who wrote these really long poems, but instead"
00:30:37,00:30:42,"of rhyming, each line was kind of related to the previous one by the words, so you might"
00:30:42,00:30:46,"have a line which is about a dog, and the next one's about a bog, and the next one's"
00:30:46,00:30:49,"about a bot, and like that, but they're really, really, really long."
00:30:49,00:30:54,It would have footnotes explaining what he'd done to make that line that was related to
00:30:54,00:30:59,"the previous line, and his footnotes could have footnotes, and that could go like five"
00:30:59,00:31:02,"footnotes deep for all of it, so it was all footnotes."
00:31:02,00:31:05,">> The David Foster Wallace of his time, and equally tedious."
00:31:05,00:31:10,"Well, according to the French Wikipedia, perhaps not surprisingly, Roussel was unpopular during"
00:31:10,00:31:15,"his life, and critical reception of his works was almost unanimously negative."
00:31:15,00:31:16,">> Oh, man."
00:31:16,00:31:17,>> Yeah.
00:31:17,00:31:18,"Well, there was loads of them around."
00:31:18,00:31:21,"I think it was just like, pretty much anyone could get stuff printed."
00:31:21,00:31:22,>> Yeah.
00:31:22,00:31:23,>> That's great.
00:31:23,00:31:24,>> But I feel like a lot of them were self-conscious.
00:31:24,00:31:26,>> They were often rich white men.
00:31:26,00:31:29,">> Yeah, yeah, and they knew what they were doing, whereas this guy didn't."
00:31:29,00:31:35,"I found something quite random about Brisset, which is that, so he was in the army, and I"
00:31:35,00:31:38,"think something quite odd about him, and this is often surprising today, about people who"
00:31:38,00:31:43,"hold very strange beliefs, Dan, you know a lot of these people."
00:31:43,00:31:49,"They function very normally in the rest of their life, and so he, as we've said, he"
00:31:49,00:31:50,worked on the railways.
00:31:50,00:31:54,"They did try to sack him a few times from the railways, because he did have some quite"
00:31:54,00:31:57,"strange ideas that they attributed to a head wound, from being in the army."
00:31:57,00:31:58,>> What?
00:31:58,00:31:59,"Yeah, what were the ideas?"
00:31:59,00:32:02,">> Well, there were a lot of the stuff we've just talked about, how all humans are descended"
00:32:02,00:32:03,"from frogs, that kind of thing."
00:32:03,00:32:04,">> Oh, not trains specifically."
00:32:04,00:32:07,">> Yeah, it made it sound like he was saying the trains should all run backwards."
00:32:07,00:32:10,">> No, sorry, he made the trains run fine, he just kept on wanging on about this whole"
00:32:10,00:32:13,humans from frogs idea.
00:32:13,00:32:18,"But he was wounded in 1859 at the Battle of Magenta, which was a battle of France and"
00:32:18,00:32:19,Italy versus Austria.
00:32:19,00:32:24,"It was a huge success and victory for the French, and I just didn't know that that's"
00:32:24,00:32:25,where the colour comes from.
00:32:25,00:32:26,>> From the battle?
00:32:26,00:32:27,>> Yeah.
00:32:27,00:32:28,>> Really?
00:32:28,00:32:31,">> Yeah, so it was this big success, the Battle of Magenta, for the French, and at the same"
00:32:31,00:32:36,"time, French chemists produced the colour that they called Fushina, and then they were"
00:32:36,00:32:39,"like, hang on, we've just had this big victory, do you mind if we rename that magenta?"
00:32:39,00:32:40,>> What colour is magenta again?
00:32:40,00:32:41,>> What colour?
00:32:41,00:32:45,">> The one in the printer that always runs out, even though you never use it."
00:32:45,00:32:46,>> Thank you.
00:32:46,00:32:47,"Hello, old friend."
00:32:47,00:32:48,Okay.
00:32:48,00:32:51,"Language, how we got language in the first place?"
00:32:51,00:32:52,>> Oh yeah.
00:32:52,00:32:55,">> The theory, because the 19th century was a time when lots of people were trying to"
00:32:55,00:32:56,work out.
00:32:56,00:32:57,How did we get language?
00:32:57,00:32:58,And the theories were fantastic.
00:32:58,00:33:03,">> Because we just had the theory of evolution, had come in with Darwin, and people thought,"
00:33:03,00:33:06,"well, surely language must have evolved in the same way, so can we fill in some of the"
00:33:06,00:33:07,gaps?
00:33:07,00:33:08,">> Yeah, exactly."
00:33:08,00:33:09,So the Bow Wow theory.
00:33:09,00:33:10,Language.
00:33:10,00:33:11,>> We came from dogs.
00:33:11,00:33:12,>> We came from dogs?
00:33:12,00:33:16,"No, it's the language comes from animal sounds, and the humans started language off by doing"
00:33:16,00:33:17,impressions of animals.
00:33:17,00:33:18,>> Really?
00:33:18,00:33:19,>> To communicate with each other.
00:33:19,00:33:23,"So for example, James, I've got, if we don't have language, I've got no way of saying there's"
00:33:23,00:33:27,"a dog behind you, unless I say woof, right?"
00:33:27,00:33:28,>> Sure.
00:33:28,00:33:32,>> But how do you say it to someone in another country that doesn't know the word woof?
00:33:32,00:33:36,"Because in English, we say woof, but dogs don't objectively say woof, and they don't"
00:33:36,00:33:39,"say Bow Wow, and in all different countries, they say different things."
00:33:39,00:33:42,">> Yeah, but I'd go, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, and if you would know there was a dog behind"
00:33:42,00:33:43,"you, we're in the same room."
00:33:43,00:33:45,"It's just 30,000 years ago, Wendy Anderfields."
00:33:45,00:33:46,>> Wendy Anderfields.
00:33:46,00:33:47,>> Yeah.
00:33:47,00:33:51,"And the guy who came up with this was a guy called, I love this, Johann Herder."
00:33:51,00:33:52,>> Oh yeah.
00:33:52,00:33:53,>> Okay.
00:33:53,00:33:54,>> What do dogs do?
00:33:54,00:33:57,>> Has he worked out what he thinks the words have evolved into?
00:33:57,00:34:00,"What does that, wow, wow, wow, what does that become?"
00:34:00,00:34:03,">> I don't know enough of what, this is the late 18th century, so I haven't read enough"
00:34:03,00:34:04,of his stuff.
00:34:04,00:34:08,"I think it was that you start off with rah, rah, rah, rah, and then eventually you get"
00:34:08,00:34:09,to woof.
00:34:09,00:34:10,>> Hang on.
00:34:10,00:34:15,">> And then, like, a few more steps, a few more steps, I'm not going to spell out, and"
00:34:15,00:34:16,then we've got this podcast.
00:34:16,00:34:21,">> Do you know what dogs say in Burma, just while we're on this subject?"
00:34:21,00:34:22,>> Dogs say in Burma.
00:34:22,00:34:26,">> They say, woke, woke, woke, woke, like a GB news presenter."
00:34:26,00:34:31,">> Because I pissed off everyone's calling it Mayanmar, aren't they?"
00:34:31,00:34:32,"Listen, Andy."
00:34:32,00:34:37,>> That's the best Burma-Mayanmar joke you'll hear on this day for weeks.
00:34:37,00:34:38,>> How much do we believe in?
00:34:38,00:34:41,Because I believe this theory 100% right now.
00:34:41,00:34:44,This sounds like the most sensible thing I've ever heard on this podcast.
00:34:44,00:34:47,"It's the first thing that kids do, like you're speaking to your kid, you teach them the noises"
00:34:47,00:34:48,that animals make.
00:34:48,00:34:49,Of course language came from there.
00:34:49,00:34:52,But what about the yo-he-ho theory?
00:34:52,00:34:53,>> What's the yo-he-ho?
00:34:53,00:34:54,>> Hang on.
00:34:54,00:34:55,This sounds better.
00:34:55,00:34:56,>> We all evolve from pirates?
00:34:56,00:34:57,>> Basically.
00:34:57,00:34:58,">> Basically, yeah."
00:34:58,00:35:03,"This is Edward Burnett Tyler in 1871, proposed that language evolve when you're doing manual"
00:35:03,00:35:05,labor together.
00:35:05,00:35:06,You might be rowing.
00:35:06,00:35:07,You might be hauling logs.
00:35:07,00:35:14,"And you have to say, row, row, or yo-he-ho, or whatever, and that gradually evolves into"
00:35:14,00:35:15,more complicated structures.
00:35:15,00:35:19,But it's basically you need some kind of shared sound that we all make when we're pulling
00:35:19,00:35:20,"a log, or whatever."
00:35:20,00:35:21,>> I like that.
00:35:21,00:35:22,>> There's also the poo-poo theory.
00:35:22,00:35:23,">> Oh, what's the poo-poo theory?"
00:35:23,00:35:30,>> The poo-poo theory is that it comes from automatic responses from disgust or happiness
00:35:30,00:35:31,or something.
00:35:31,00:35:33,"So you see something and you go, poo."
00:35:33,00:35:34,You just make that automatically.
00:35:34,00:35:35,It's not a word.
00:35:35,00:35:37,And then eventually words evolve from that.
00:35:37,00:35:38,>> I think it's the woof-woof thing.
00:35:38,00:35:39,>> Do you?
00:35:39,00:35:46,">> There's a very famous philosopher and linguist called Ferdinand de Saussur, who you've all"
00:35:46,00:35:50,"heard of, as had I before I started researching for this, of course."
00:35:50,00:35:53,"But he's one of the founders of linguistics, apparently."
00:35:53,00:35:56,"Anyway, so he's very well respected."
00:35:56,00:35:58,He died in 1913.
00:35:58,00:36:02,"Sometime after he died, eight cardboard boxes were found that belonged to him that showed"
00:36:02,00:36:07,he was obsessed with the idea that all of classical literature had hidden anagrams within
00:36:07,00:36:08,it.
00:36:08,00:36:09,And people still talk about this.
00:36:09,00:36:15,People still kind of write papers about what this means and whether it's justifiable.
00:36:15,00:36:20,But he just got obsessed with the idea there are all these weird anagrams and phony matching
00:36:20,00:36:22,and patterns in classical literature.
00:36:22,00:36:23,>> That's really interesting.
00:36:23,00:36:24,>> It's so weird.
00:36:24,00:36:25,>> It's so weird about finding the patterns.
00:36:25,00:36:30,"It's the same with Brisset, I guess, because he said, okay, we've all evolved from frogs"
00:36:30,00:36:36,"and these frogs saying qua, and then that goes into what in French?"
00:36:36,00:36:40,"But he kind of assumes that French is the original language, right?"
00:36:40,00:36:41,>> Yeah.
00:36:41,00:36:42,>> That's the big problem with this theory.
00:36:42,00:36:43,">> Well, he says, yeah."
00:36:43,00:36:45,>> But what's the nickname for the French?
00:36:45,00:36:46,Frogs.
00:36:46,00:36:47,>> Oh.
00:36:47,00:36:49,>> I'm just saying.
00:36:49,00:36:50,>> Holy shit.
00:36:50,00:36:51,>> Maybe there's something.
00:36:51,00:36:52,Have I just blown this shit wide open?
00:36:52,00:36:59,>> You've blown this shit wide open.
00:36:59,00:37:02,">> We need to move on to our final fact of the show, all right?"
00:37:02,00:37:06,"It is time for our final fact of the show, and that is Anna."
00:37:06,00:37:13,"My fact this week is that in 1968, a pig was nominated as a US presidential candidate,"
00:37:13,00:37:17,but was arrested in the middle of his acceptance speech.
00:37:17,00:37:19,>> When we're saying his acceptance speech.
00:37:19,00:37:23,">> They're very eloquent pigs, if you would just listen."
00:37:23,00:37:24,>> Yeah.
00:37:24,00:37:25,>> Yeah.
00:37:25,00:37:28,">> Don't say, oh, yeah, he made sense to me."
00:37:28,00:37:34,"Honestly, I was thinking of the pig from Babe, and I was like, he was eloquent."
00:37:34,00:37:35,>> It wasn't that pig.
00:37:35,00:37:36,>> It was a different pig.
00:37:36,00:37:43,"This is a pig called Pegasus, and he was a presidential candidate of the yippies, which"
00:37:43,00:37:49,were a political party slash incoate group of late 1960s sort of activist dissenters
00:37:49,00:37:55,"who sort of didn't like the war in Vietnam, as no one did, and they made a big fuss about"
00:37:55,00:37:56,it.
00:37:56,00:38:00,"And one of the big fusses they made was this was two days before the big Democrat conference,"
00:38:00,00:38:04,"National Convention, and they showed up, they called a press conference, and they rocked"
00:38:04,00:38:10,"up with this pig candidate, and one of their leaders, Jerry Rubin, started to do the acceptance"
00:38:10,00:38:15,"speech on the pig's behalf, because the pig was very shy, and interrupted halfway through"
00:38:15,00:38:20,"by the police, who genuinely arrested all the candidates, including the pig, and took"
00:38:20,00:38:21,them away.
00:38:21,00:38:25,>> I read a rumour that he was subsequently eaten by one of the police officers.
00:38:25,00:38:26,">> Yeah, I heard that as well."
00:38:26,00:38:28,>> That's a rumour.
00:38:28,00:38:33,"I don't think it is, and the reason I don't think it is, is that it's quite difficult"
00:38:33,00:38:38,"to just go from a live pig in your possession to it being on your dining room table, isn't"
00:38:38,00:38:39,it?
00:38:39,00:38:40,">> You've got to have a kit, haven't you?"
00:38:40,00:38:41,>> You've got to have a gear.
00:38:41,00:38:45,">> Yeah, actually, I read a different rumour that he was married off and taken to a farm"
00:38:45,00:38:48,"to live with Mrs. Pegasus, which is a nicer..."
00:38:48,00:38:49,">> Oh, that's a nice one."
00:38:49,00:38:51,">> Yeah, and I think that's plausible as well."
00:38:51,00:38:53,>> Probably somewhere in between is the truth.
00:38:53,00:38:56,>> Probably rehoused and then eventually eaten.
00:38:56,00:38:57,>> Yeah.
00:38:57,00:38:58,>> There we go.
00:38:58,00:39:04,">> I read a further rumour that months, like five months after this incident, the Yippies"
00:39:04,00:39:09,"held an honorary, what they called, ""Inhoguration"" for Pegasus."
00:39:09,00:39:10,>> Lovely.
00:39:10,00:39:12,">> Yeah, it's all great stuff."
00:39:12,00:39:13,>> It's good stuff.
00:39:13,00:39:18,"I think they were fun, protesters had quite a lot of fun in the '60s, as well as being"
00:39:18,00:39:19,very angry.
00:39:19,00:39:20,">> Well, this is Flower Power."
00:39:20,00:39:24,"If you want to put a name that's connected to it, Abby Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, they were"
00:39:24,00:39:30,"all part of this big moment of saying anti-war and peace is needed, but they were pranksters"
00:39:30,00:39:35,and they were also pulling stunts like this to sort of get themselves in enough trouble
00:39:35,00:39:39,"that they made a statement, but nothing, you know, bringing a pig to a nomination is not"
00:39:39,00:39:40,really dangerous.
00:39:40,00:39:41,">> Yeah, it wasn't even in the building."
00:39:41,00:39:43,It was sort of easy.
00:39:43,00:39:49,"They were nicknamed the Groucho Marxists, but the Yippies, as they got called, it stood"
00:39:49,00:39:54,"for the Youth International Party, but actually they were named, because one of their founders,"
00:39:54,00:39:59,"a guy called Krasna, was going through the alphabet for words that rhymed with hippie,"
00:39:59,00:40:03,"and eventually got to, like, almost the last gasp, we got to Yippie, and they thought,"
00:40:03,00:40:06,"""Oh, yeah, we could make that stand for Youth International Party if we, you know, mangled"
00:40:06,00:40:07,"it a bit."""
00:40:07,00:40:08,>> Yeah.
00:40:08,00:40:09,">> And so, they didn't get the name first and then come up with the acronym."
00:40:09,00:40:12,They came up with the acronym first and then back-formed it.
00:40:12,00:40:13,>> Yeah.
00:40:13,00:40:16,">> And they did take it seriously as well as being pranksters, like the whole pig thing,"
00:40:16,00:40:18,there was a big argument about it.
00:40:18,00:40:22,"So I guess the three main people were Abby and Anita Hoffman, who were a couple, and"
00:40:22,00:40:24,Jerry Rubin.
00:40:24,00:40:30,And Abby and Anita Hoffman bought the first pig for this big press conference and presented
00:40:30,00:40:34,"it to Jerry Rubin, who rejected the pig out of hand, was furious, said, ""This is too small."
00:40:34,00:40:36,It's too attractive.
00:40:36,00:40:37,We need a big pig.
00:40:37,00:40:38,"We need an ugly pig."""
00:40:38,00:40:39,And he had to himself.
00:40:39,00:40:40,>> Why not?
00:40:40,00:40:41,I've seen another picture here.
00:40:41,00:40:42,He's not that.
00:40:42,00:40:43,I've seen bigger pigs.
00:40:43,00:40:44,>> I've seen bigger pigs.
00:40:44,00:40:45,>> I agree.
00:40:45,00:40:51,"It's an attractive pig to my eyes, but it was supposed to represent sort of political power"
00:40:51,00:40:54,"of the day, I suppose, and that's ugly."
00:40:54,00:40:55,That's the satire there.
00:40:55,00:40:59,>> The other thing they did very famously was walk to the Pentagon and try and levitate
00:40:59,00:41:00,it.
00:41:00,00:41:01,>> Yeah.
00:41:01,00:41:02,That's right.
00:41:02,00:41:03,>> It's really interesting.
00:41:03,00:41:08,"When you speak to people who were on this march, and there was a lot of them, most of"
00:41:08,00:41:12,"them say, ""Yeah, we were just going for a long, for the fun, and we weren't really going"
00:41:12,00:41:13,"to levitate it."""
00:41:13,00:41:18,"And then some of them, admittedly, who were kind of off their tits on LSD, they actually"
00:41:18,00:41:19,thought they were going to levitate it.
00:41:19,00:41:21,I genuinely think some of them thought they were.
00:41:21,00:41:25,">> Yeah, they thought they were going to send psychic energy towards it until the building"
00:41:25,00:41:30,"itself turned orange with the energy and vibration, and then it would slowly levitate, and they"
00:41:30,00:41:34,"were going to do it by psychic energy, Tibetan chants, and as you say, they knew it was a"
00:41:34,00:41:37,"joke, but then there were people that thought, ""Well, if enough of us did it, maybe this"
00:41:37,00:41:39,"would actually work."""
00:41:39,00:41:43,"And it was, you know, I mean, the names that keep cropping up, if you know your counterculture"
00:41:43,00:41:44,America well.
00:41:44,00:41:45,">> Wait, what happened?"
00:41:45,00:41:46,Sorry.
00:41:46,00:41:47,">> Oh, yeah, so it lifted up."
00:41:47,00:41:48,It turned orange.
00:41:48,00:41:49,>> It's still there.
00:41:49,00:41:50,It's still in the air now.
00:41:50,00:41:51,>> It's a nightmare.
00:41:51,00:41:52,You've got to get in by ladder.
00:41:52,00:41:53,It's insane.
00:41:53,00:41:54,"Nothing happened, Andy."
00:41:54,00:41:55,It didn't work.
00:41:55,00:41:56,Sorry.
00:41:56,00:42:01,">> Well, Alan Ginsberg, who's one of these counterculture guys, he said, ""The Pentagon"
00:42:01,00:42:04,"was symbolically levitated in people's minds."""
00:42:04,00:42:05,>> Oh.
00:42:05,00:42:06,">> Yeah, that's such a..."
00:42:06,00:42:07,>> That's pretty good.
00:42:07,00:42:08,>> ...crap excuse.
00:42:08,00:42:09,>> That's like my facts on this show.
00:42:09,00:42:13,It is true if you just believe hard enough.
00:42:13,00:42:17,"He, Hoffman, by the way, I'm saying that he was sort of part of a peaceful movement and"
00:42:17,00:42:18,so on.
00:42:18,00:42:22,"But, you know, he did write a very infamous book, which was called ""Steal This Book."""
00:42:22,00:42:27,"Kind of like the Anarchist Cook book, it had a lot of stuff in there that you don't want"
00:42:27,00:42:28,people reading.
00:42:28,00:42:31,"You know, there was bomb-making, that kind of stuff in order to..."
00:42:31,00:42:35,But it was largely a book about how can you help with the troubles that are going on?
00:42:35,00:42:39,"How can you make a point, but have little hacks to get through it?"
00:42:39,00:42:44,"So, for example, if you need to talk to a large crowd, don't spend ages doing what we"
00:42:44,00:42:45,have here.
00:42:45,00:42:46,"You know, like..."
00:42:46,00:42:47,>> Booking a theater.
00:42:47,00:42:48,>> Booking a theater.
00:42:48,00:42:49,All that stuff.
00:42:49,00:42:50,There's a lot of money.
00:42:50,00:42:53,"You know, go to a show where there's a theater booked and before the show starts, jump on"
00:42:53,00:42:54,stage.
00:42:54,00:42:55,They've got a PA system.
00:42:55,00:42:59,"Just use what they're using and go and don't do it here, obviously, Glasgow, but that's"
00:42:59,00:43:03,what his suggestion was and always do it prior to a show because you don't want to preach
00:43:03,00:43:06,to people who are going to get angry at you for interrupting a show.
00:43:06,00:43:07,>> That's fine.
00:43:07,00:43:08,That's not too dangerous.
00:43:08,00:43:12,"The bookmaking stuff is bad, but I think interrupting someone's show..."
00:43:12,00:43:13,">> Yeah, yeah."
00:43:13,00:43:14,>> I'm okay with that.
00:43:14,00:43:17,">> No, arguably the most dangerous thing about the book was it's called ""Steal This Book,"""
00:43:17,00:43:19,encouraging everyone to not pay for it in the shops that they were.
00:43:19,00:43:20,And that's what...
00:43:20,00:43:21,>> Did it happen?
00:43:21,00:43:22,That happened?
00:43:22,00:43:23,">> Yeah, it did get stolen."
00:43:23,00:43:26,"He should have called it ""Buy This Book"" or ""Buy Ten Copies of This Book."""
00:43:26,00:43:27,>> Yes.
00:43:27,00:43:31,">> I think that might have defeated his object while, yes, making him some more money, James."
00:43:31,00:43:35,>> I think he did call his autobiography something like coming to a theater near you or something
00:43:35,00:43:38,"like that, soon to be adapted into cinema."
00:43:38,00:43:41,"Yeah, so he did have titles like that."
00:43:41,00:43:45,">> I think on the last page of the bucket, it has a list of other books worth stealing."
00:43:45,00:43:46,>> Nice.
00:43:46,00:43:47,">> Oh, that's nice."
00:43:47,00:43:50,">> Oh, I thought you were about to list all of our books, so it was a bit of slight publicity,"
00:43:50,00:43:51,"but no, okay."
00:43:51,00:43:54,>> They invaded Disneyland in 1970.
00:43:54,00:43:57,They managed a huge victory there.
00:43:57,00:44:00,"That night, Disneyland had to close slightly early."
00:44:00,00:44:01,>> Wow.
00:44:01,00:44:03,">> Take that, the men."
00:44:03,00:44:07,">> But supposedly, Andy was only the second time in Disney's history where they had to"
00:44:07,00:44:11,"shut and get everyone out in order to deal with the situation, so for Disney, it was"
00:44:11,00:44:15,a big deal because they were going to liberate Minnie Mouse.
00:44:15,00:44:18,They were staying on Tom Sawyer's Island.
00:44:18,00:44:20,>> They wanted to liberate Minnie Mouse and cook Porky Pig.
00:44:20,00:44:24,"Again, another very pig-based, they clearly turned to violence by this point."
00:44:24,00:44:27,It's just two years after they were being nice to pigs.
00:44:27,00:44:29,>> But you're missing the main thing about that.
00:44:29,00:44:32,"Porky Pig's not a Disney character, so it's not even there."
00:44:32,00:44:34,"So they got there, and there was no Porky Pig."
00:44:34,00:44:37,">> You've got to know your genre, you know your brand."
00:44:37,00:44:41,"Hoffman played by Sasha Baron Cohen quite recently, if anyone's ever seen the film,"
00:44:41,00:44:44,"The Trial of the Chicago Seven, and very confusing."
00:44:44,00:44:48,"So The Trial of the Chicago Seven was basically, there was a huge riot, and they were all put"
00:44:48,00:44:54,"on trial, these guys, and Hoffman and Reuben went into court wearing judicial robes, basically"
00:44:54,00:44:55,disguised as the judge.
00:44:55,00:44:56,>> Brilliant.
00:44:56,00:45:01,">> This was even more confusing, given that the judge was also called Hoffman."
00:45:01,00:45:06,"And then so confusingly, Reuben, the other one, went on to meet a nemesis."
00:45:06,00:45:13,"He moved to Miami, and he decided to lead this thing to occupy a golf course for one"
00:45:13,00:45:15,to achieve one of his aims with a bunch of people.
00:45:15,00:45:20,"And he met his nemesis, who was also called Reuben, so it was Reuben versus Reuben, faced"
00:45:20,00:45:23,off against each other in this church in Miami.
00:45:23,00:45:26,And then he turned into a stockbroker.
00:45:26,00:45:30,">> And they went on tours with Yopi versus Yipi, didn't they?"
00:45:30,00:45:31,>> They did.
00:45:31,00:45:35,"This is after Jerry Reuben became this big-shot stockbroker, and kept saying, but it's good,"
00:45:35,00:45:37,it's all part of the be good plan.
00:45:37,00:45:38,>> What's a Yopi again?
00:45:38,00:45:39,"What's that, Definder?"
00:45:39,00:45:40,">> Young, openly mobile professional person."
00:45:40,00:45:41,>> Yeah.
00:45:41,00:45:44,>> Just a comment from the '80s with a big mobile phone.
00:45:44,00:45:45,>> Yeah.
00:45:45,00:45:46,">> Okay, right."
00:45:46,00:45:51,>> So Anita and Abby Hoffman had a child that they called America.
00:45:51,00:45:54,"America with a small a, because they didn't want him to be pretentious."
00:45:54,00:45:59,"But actually, it does seem okay, actually."
00:45:59,00:46:02,">> That will come across really well over the phone, won't it?"
00:46:02,00:46:03,"No, no, no."
00:46:03,00:46:04,Small a.
00:46:04,00:46:07,>> He later changed his name to Alan.
00:46:07,00:46:09,>> Still with a small a?
00:46:09,00:46:15,">> No, he's now half Alan and half America, because he's changed his name back to America,"
00:46:15,00:46:18,but he's kept the capital a from Alan.
00:46:18,00:46:19,>> Right.
00:46:19,00:46:20,>> General political protests?
00:46:20,00:46:21,">> Yeah, sure."
00:46:21,00:46:23,">> Now's not the time, Andy."
00:46:23,00:46:26,>> I've gathered us all here for a reason.
00:46:26,00:46:30,"No, I was just reading about other protests of various kinds."
00:46:30,00:46:33,"So pig-based protests, actually, specifically I started looking into."
00:46:33,00:46:34,>> Okay.
00:46:34,00:46:35,>> There was one in Taiwan a few years ago.
00:46:35,00:46:36,It was a big debate.
00:46:36,00:46:40,"Do we let an American pork, which has been treated with this particular chemical, spanned"
00:46:40,00:46:41,in lots of countries?
00:46:41,00:46:45,"Anyway, this was the report from, I think, the New York Times."
00:46:45,00:46:50,"Members of the Kuomintang on Friday threw pig hearts, intestines, lungs, and other innards."
00:46:50,00:46:52,This is in parliament.
00:46:52,00:46:56,"This parliament became a, what's it called, Mardi Gras, what's the tomato thing?"
00:46:56,00:46:57,">> Oh, tamatina."
00:46:57,00:46:59,">> Yeah, it was like that, but with pig hearts."
00:46:59,00:47:00,>> Oh.
00:47:00,00:47:03,">> And they threw other innards, leaving the chambers crimson carpet street with ropey"
00:47:03,00:47:09,strands of intestine and milky viscera.
00:47:09,00:47:13,"Some lawmakers donned rain jackets, others brawled in business suits soiled by what appeared"
00:47:13,00:47:14,to be bits of pig fat.
00:47:14,00:47:15,>> Oh.
00:47:15,00:47:18,">> So, you know, just when you think our politicians are bad, that's..."
00:47:18,00:47:20,">> No, that's great."
00:47:20,00:47:21,We could do with more of that.
00:47:21,00:47:26,>> We would all tune into BBC Parliament if we were expecting awful to be hurled around
00:47:26,00:47:27,it.
00:47:27,00:47:28,>> That is true.
00:47:28,00:47:33,">> Similarly, in 1975, there was a group of vegetarians in Michigan that protested McDonald's."
00:47:33,00:47:35,It was a two-floor McDonald's.
00:47:35,00:47:39,They went to the top floor and all vomited onto the people below.
00:47:39,00:47:40,>> On command?
00:47:40,00:47:45,>> They all downed a mixture of mustard and water and then immediately vomited.
00:47:45,00:47:46,>> Wow.
00:47:46,00:47:47,">> But not in unison, right?"
00:47:47,00:47:48,You can't...
00:47:48,00:47:49,And that would take so much practice.
00:47:49,00:47:50,Synchronising.
00:47:50,00:47:55,">> I don't like the fountains of the Bellagio, I don't think, but it was kind of around"
00:47:55,00:47:57,"the same time, at least."
00:47:57,00:48:03,"And the newspapers got a press release afterwards, which they reported was written in either"
00:48:03,00:48:05,blood or chocolate syrup.
00:48:05,00:48:07,I'm going to go for the latter.
00:48:07,00:48:08,>> Yeah.
00:48:08,00:48:15,">> There was an election in Iceland this year, and one of the candidates, or someone who's"
00:48:15,00:48:22,"trying to become a candidate, was Snaesfell Jorkudl, which is a glacier."
00:48:22,00:48:27,"The rules say that to become president, you have to be an Icelandic citizen, and actually,"
00:48:27,00:48:33,"in Iceland a few years ago, they made a new law that all of the glaciers are now citizens."
00:48:33,00:48:34,So it passed on that.
00:48:34,00:48:43,"You had to be age over 35, glacier, 700,000 years old, and no criminal record."
00:48:43,00:48:48,And the only reason that it didn't become is they didn't get enough signatures.
00:48:48,00:48:49,People didn't sign.
00:48:49,00:48:51,"Otherwise, there's no reason why it couldn't do."
00:48:51,00:48:56,And it's actually the glacier that's mentioned in Journey to the Centre of the Earth by Shilfern.
00:48:56,00:48:57,">> Oh, wow."
00:48:57,00:48:58,">> Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:48:58,00:48:59,>> That's the one they go through.
00:48:59,00:49:00,So that could have been President of Iceland.
00:49:00,00:49:01,">> Oh, man."
00:49:01,00:49:03,>> And they're going to go for it again next time.
00:49:03,00:49:06,">> That would have been so nice, just for someone for Joe Biden to stand next to him,"
00:49:06,00:49:16,"feel young, and sprightly."
00:49:16,00:49:17,>> That is it.
00:49:17,00:49:18,That is all of our facts.
00:49:18,00:49:19,Thank you so much for listening.
00:49:19,00:49:22,We will be back again next time with another episode.
00:49:22,00:49:24,"But thank you so much, Glasgow."
00:49:24,00:49:25,That was awesome.
00:49:25,00:49:26,And we'll see you all again.
00:49:26,00:49:27,Goodbye.
00:49:27,00:49:42,[Applause]
00:49:42,00:49:44,(upbeat music)
