 [MUSIC]

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:04.660
 >> You can sing along.

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:11.500
 [MUSIC]

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.240
 >> Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.400
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Glasgow.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.720
 >> [APPLAUSE]

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.480
 >> My name is Jan Schreiber.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.280
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.960
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.640
 facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.560
 Starting with fact number one, that is James.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.080
 >> Okay, my fact this week is that according to DNA analysis,

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.460
 Beethoven wasn't very musical.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.240
 >> [LAUGH]

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.040
 >> Is that saying something about Beethoven or about DNA analysis and

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.520
 how it sort of is not?

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.520
 >> We might come to Beethoven, in fact, I'm sure we will.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.240
 But this is basically a study where they looked at Beethoven's DNA.

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:08.600
 And they looked at the DNA of a load of students in a couple of universities,

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.120
 one in Tennessee and one in the Netherlands.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:16.400
 And what they were saying is that DNA tests can't really give much to

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.800
 historical people and tell you about their characters really.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.760
 It's kind of a warning against that.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.720
 But in actual fact, Beethoven, well, he wasn't like Mozart.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.880
 Like Mozart when he was age four could play incredible pieces.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.280
 But Beethoven couldn't hold a tune, he could not write a tune.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.320
 >> No, he wasn't really.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.120
 >> I like him.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.200
 I don't love him, I like him, but he could not write a melody to save himself.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.040
 And I bet he'd say he was above that.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.480
 You know when you get some avant-garde pop stars who say,

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.880
 I don't write the catchy songs because they're beneath me.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.440
 Locks them before me in Glasgow actually.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:46.680
 >> Wait, so we're- >> [LAUGH]

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.600
 >> Yes, all of Beethoven's very uncatchy tunes, like da, da, da, da.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.380
 >> Come on, that's the only one.

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:54.840
 >> It's a pretty solid riff.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.580
 >> I'm sorry, I disagree with that completely.

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.480
 Just on this study of the Beethoven's sort of DNA that they study,

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.920
 they had a lock of hair from Beethoven.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.280
 And in fact, they had eight locks of hair.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.560
 This was really exciting.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.040
 But only five of them were genetically identical.

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:11.080
 >> So what does that mean?

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.240
 >> Three of them were fake.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.040
 >> Oh, they were fake.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.320
 He wasn't like some kind of Chimera who was half-baked-hoven half someone else.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.920
 What was it, the dog-bate-hoven?

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.440
 >> It was the dog-bate-hoven.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.240
 >> Yeah.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.140
 >> There was one lock of hair which turned out to be from a woman, and

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.060
 that was the one that said, you've got terrible lead poisoning, so that's not true.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.460
 But the thing they found, which is exciting, is that they've studied some

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.500
 modern Beethoven's, and they've studied the identical locks of hair from him.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.460
 And they found that the Y chromosome is different between the two.

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.780
 And what that means is that in his family line somewhere,

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.780
 there is an extra pair paternity event.

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.180
 >> Okay.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.940
 >> Yeah, someone's been playing a false note.

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.600
 >> Yeah. >> Yes, anyway.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.680
 >> Dave Grohl of his day.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.960
 >> Wow.

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:02.000
 Can I ask, do we know if it was head hair or hand hair?

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.680
 >> I don't know.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:03.800
 >> I assume head hair.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.400
 >> Yeah, I'm assuming head hair as well.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.880
 >> Not everyone's hands are as pursuit as yours are, dad.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.720
 >> Well, mine, I've got a bit of hair, but apparently he was like,

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.240
 he looked like Wolfman according to some reports I read.

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.040
 Yeah, and so if you were gonna see if he was musically talented,

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.280
 maybe it was more on that hand hair than it was the head hair.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.580
 >> Cuz that's where the jeans would be.

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.100
 They would be in the fingers there, wouldn't they?

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.980
 Was it, were these the hairs that, I mean, I don't know where these ones came from,

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.220
 but I know about one person who's stashed a load of Beethoven hair.

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.660
 A musician called Ferdinand Hiller, and when you were a fanboy in the olden days,

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.100
 you snipped hair off dead people that you liked.

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.780
 >> Right, okay, yeah, right.

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:40.340
 >> Was that from him?

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.860
 And what I like about this is that every strand of hair was counted.

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:49.320
 It was 582 strands, and they were bought by a urologist.

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.120
 And do you remember?

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.280
 >> Yes, yeah, he's the guy with most, he gets constantly approached to

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.840
 get DNA analysis done on the strands of hair that he has.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.960
 >> He does, but wasn't it also a urologist who collected Napoleon's penis?

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:02.680
 >> Yes, it was.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.360
 >> Yes, urologist, something weird about them.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.800
 >> Wow, that's interesting.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:07.320
 >> Anyway, yeah.

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.200
 >> Could you, in theory, with the Beethoven hair that we have,

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:15.660
 could you stretch them and make a sort of very tiny piano using the hair as?

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.660
 >> I don't think so, I think they'd snap.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:18.740
 >> But a tiny piano.

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:20.500
 >> Yeah, come on, James.

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.540
 No one's gonna hold you to this if you say it's possible.

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.260
 >> I just think if I say it, then that is on our next target,

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:27.460
 we're gonna go, where's my fucking piano?

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.860
 Yeah, okay, sure.

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.260
 >> Okay, you've just made him happy.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:34.660
 >> There we go.

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.460
 Can we talk about- >> I'm kind of enjoying the whole piano.

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:38.980
 >> I'm sorry, yeah.

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.060
 >> No, no, go on, what were you gonna say?

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:45.840
 >> Yeah, going deaf, going deaf by the age of 30, he could not hear conversation.

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.000
 And that was at a period where he was composing most of his, most amazing music.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.320
 And this is just, it's so interesting because one of the things he did was,

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.560
 we know how he communicated because he had conversation books.

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.560
 This is so interesting that they survive.

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:00.240
 >> So what's that?

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.240
 >> Well, if you're Beethoven, you carry a notebook.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.200
 >> Okay. >> And if someone wants to ask you a question,

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.680
 they write it down in your notebook, and then you answer it.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.980
 So we have a list of questions that Beethoven was asked, and

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.380
 we don't have any of his answers.

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.060
 It's exactly the wrong way around.

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.060
 >> No, no, no.

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:18.900
 >> And sometimes we have his shopping lists as well.

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.260
 That is less revealing about the mind of a genius.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.140
 And then the thing was, he had a secretary called Anton Schindler,

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:26.300
 who became kind of the keeper of his flame.

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:30.020
 And he was his first biographer, and he was very, very much,

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:31.940
 he sort of wanted to keep this to himself.

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:35.980
 So he would answer the door wearing Beethoven's old dressing gown, pretty creepy.

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:39.800
 But what we also found was he had a lot of these conversation books.

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.300
 And if he found a blank page in one of them,

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.080
 he would just forge an entry himself.

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.560
 >> Oh, really?

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.120
 >> Quite frustrating for biographers.

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.320
 Because they've only just done handwriting analysis and worked out.

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.600
 Yeah, some of this is lies that were never asked.

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.520
 >> But I guess, yeah, he is only forging the questions.

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.080
 >> Yes, unless he's writing an interesting shopping list.

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:02.640
 >> Well, they might be, they can tell a lot of shopping lists.

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:07.340
 And actually, you can read a lot from the conversation books by what the people are asking him.

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:08.340
 Like, there's a really nice one.

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:09.860
 He was very, very close to his nephew.

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.120
 We might go on to talk about his relationship with Carl, his nephew.

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.160
 But he was very close to Carl, and they were in a restaurant one day.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.840
 And this is in 1818, which is when he just started to do these conversation books.

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.720
 And we have Carl's question to him.

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.400
 Just because you eat sausages by taking the casing off and

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:28.360
 only eating the meat inside, it doesn't mean I have to, is he?

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.180
 >> And Beethoven said, that's not a question.

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.600
 >> [LAUGH]

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.120
 >> That's really funny.

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.920
 >> He did have, you compared him to Mozart, James.

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:41.040
 And he did have this sort of sad relationship with Mozart, or

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:46.460
 connection to Mozart, because Mozart very famously, child prodigy, very pushy dad.

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:51.840
 And Beethoven's dad really wanted Beethoven to be the next Mozart.

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.880
 He was called Johann, he was a court musician.

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.760
 So he expected that one of his kids would go into music.

00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:00.440
 He realized Beethoven was quite good, but he used to lock him in the basement.

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.420
 He'd drag him out of bed in the middle of the night and

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:05.220
 force him to play piano over and over again.

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:10.340
 He beat him a lot, he was a very unpleasant person, it sounds like.

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:14.020
 Desperate to make him rich and famous because of being so talented.

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:18.020
 And also, he convinced Beethoven that he was two years younger than he was.

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:19.860
 So for years of his life,

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:23.740
 Beethoven thought that he was born in 1772, because his dad was so

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:26.140
 desperate to make him this child prodigy.

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:28.540
 >> There's a story that he did meet Beethoven as well,

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:30.800
 that he was presented to him as this.

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:35.200
 And Mozart was really pissed off that he was having to break away from

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:38.480
 his personal writing to meet this kid that everyone was saying,

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:39.640
 well, he might be really good.

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:42.400
 He sits down and he starts playing a piece by Mozart to him.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.960
 And Mozart says, stop that, I want to hear what you've got.

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:47.240
 And he plays a little in original piece.

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:50.800
 And supposedly, Mozart did the old, you got it kid.

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:52.840
 And everyone was like, whoa, he's got it.

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:56.280
 And so that was like a seal of approval kind of thing.

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:57.980
 >> Yeah, so watch out for this guy.

00:07:57.980 --> 00:07:59.180
 >> We're still in Vienna, are we?

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:03.100
 >> Feels like we've moved to California at some stage.

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:05.940
 >> Now, you know what Billy Joel brings someone up to play the piano and

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:08.820
 afterwards he's like, watch out for this guy, he's going to be making.

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:10.180
 No, you don't watch YouTube clips like that?

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:11.180
 Okay.

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:14.100
 >> Are you saying, do you think Mozart said that to literally everyone?

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:16.020
 Every kid who came along, he went, watch out for this kid.

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:18.020
 >> Yeah, well, this guy.

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:20.220
 >> So he did nine symphonies, didn't he?

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:25.260
 And the ninth one was the one when he was really deaf and he was conducting.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.040
 And there was another conductor on the side because he was conducting,

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:29.200
 he couldn't hear what was happening.

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.440
 So he's just basically waving his arms.

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:34.880
 And all of the people in the orchestra were told to watch the other guy,

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:38.600
 basically, and then as soon as the symphony finished,

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:42.360
 he was carrying on conducting because he didn't realize it had finished.

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:45.960
 >> What a shame, if you just had to follow what he was doing,

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:48.240
 you would have gone an original Beethoven piece and

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:50.320
 it would have just kept going and kept going.

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:53.840
 And that would have been one of the most amazing nights of music ever.

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:54.720
 >> You say that?

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:58.680
 >> Yeah. >> One of the worst nights of live music ever

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:03.120
 was in 1808, Christmas in Vienna, picture the scene.

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:07.720
 It's frosty, sparkling, it's beautiful, these incredible buildings everywhere.

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:10.940
 It was the marathon performance of Beethoven's new stuff.

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:17.520
 And we're talking the premiere of Beethoven's fifth, premiere of the sixth.

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:20.520
 No gap, just straight on through, here's another symphony.

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:24.240
 Choral fantasy, another piano concerto, four hours of music.

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:25.040
 >> My God.

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:25.920
 >> Bit long.

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:27.120
 >> [LAUGH]

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:30.760
 >> It's like when Stuart Lee does back-to-back shows in one evening.

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:34.840
 >> It was a complete disaster on the night because all the best musicians

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:38.120
 in town had a rival booking, so they couldn't come and play.

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:40.200
 So the orchestra was a bit of a scratch job.

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:44.120
 And it was extremely cold, the critics hated it.

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:48.120
 One piece, they hadn't rehearsed it enough, the choir just sang it wrong, and

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:52.160
 he had to stop the whole gig and say, no, no, no, we need to go back to the beginning.

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:54.960
 It was just a total fiasco of it, yeah, it was a nightmare.

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:58.480
 >> So then he did his night symphony, and then he started his tenth.

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:01.640
 But he never completed the tenth, he died before he completed it.

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:06.280
 But luckily AI has completed it in 2021.

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:10.800
 And the piece had its world premiere in Bonn in Germany, apparently it's very good.

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:12.480
 Unfortunately, you need six fingers to play it.

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:15.120
 >> [LAUGH]

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:16.680
 >> Any good, what are the critics saying?

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:20.000
 >> Yeah, it's fine, sounds a bit like Beethoven.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.320
 >> Fine, what a review.

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:22.080
 >> That's what you want.

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:25.600
 >> Beethoven, by the way, his name means vegetable garden.

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:26.360
 >> Cool.

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:31.120
 >> And his full name Ludwig van Beethoven means loud fight in the vegetable garden.

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:33.920
 >> [LAUGH]

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:35.880
 >> Which is what a lot of his music sounds like.

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:40.040
 No, I think he's brilliant, he just doesn't write melody.

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:41.720
 But do you know what his last words were?

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:43.960
 >> The two versions of it or something.

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:46.640
 >> So Beethoven famously died during a thunderstorm,

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:49.280
 quite cool, quite classic, Beethoven.

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:53.040
 And his last words were, pity, pity, too late.

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:56.240
 Because he'd just been informed that he'd received a gift from his publisher of

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:57.320
 12 bottles of wine.

00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:01.840
 >> Which I know the saddest thing about his life.

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:02.960
 >> They won't be your last words.

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:04.480
 >> [LAUGH]

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:05.680
 >> Start opening them now.

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:07.640
 >> [LAUGH]

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:10.680
 >> We're gonna go half an hour- >> Don't let them breathe.

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:15.840
 [MUSIC]

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:19.760
 >> It is time for fact number two, and that is Andy.

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:24.920
 >> My fact is that one of Scotland's most eminent 19th century illustrators

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:26.360
 was called Willie Hull.

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:28.200
 >> [LAUGH]

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.080
 >> Here you go.

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:29.720
 >> That's him there.

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:31.320
 >> And there he is, in all its glory.

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:32.800
 >> Why is that interesting, Andy?

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:34.160
 >> Why is that interesting?

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:36.960
 >> I think- >> I think he's an under-celebrated artist.

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:38.320
 >> Okay, yeah.

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.080
 >> You're bringing him to life today.

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:41.480
 >> Absolutely.

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:44.120
 >> I think this is the most immature fact.

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:45.800
 >> [LAUGH]

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:47.360
 >> And you know what, I thought it would be James.

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:51.800
 My money was on James for the fact that it's just a rude name.

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:56.760
 >> I'm sorry, I do feel a bit ashamed, but I also feel thrilled that we've talked about him.

00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:58.480
 >> He was called William Hull.

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:00.440
 >> But in day-to-day life, who's got the time?

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:02.520
 >> [LAUGH]

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:05.040
 >> I'll challenge you, Anna, for a more childish fact.

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:07.120
 His dad was called Dick Hull.

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:07.720
 >> Yes.

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.040
 >> True.

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:12.000
 >> Middle name, Richard Brassy Hull.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:12.840
 >> Yeah.

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:17.440
 >> And his mother was called Ann Byrne Hull.

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:19.600
 This family just had it stitched up.

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:20.400
 >> Yeah.

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:22.800
 >> How many people here, they didn't have it stitched up?

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:24.960
 >> [LAUGH]

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:26.360
 >> Sorry.

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:29.200
 >> Who here has heard of Willie Hull?

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:32.360
 And shame on you, actually.

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:35.520
 >> Imagine if there'd just been a roar of recognition.

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:37.520
 >> This is quite obscure.

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:39.800
 >> Well, at the time, he was very eminent.

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:42.080
 He was a member of the Royal Scottish Academy.

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:46.600
 He illustrated books for Robert Burns, for J.M.

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:48.200
 Barry, Robert Louis Stevenson.

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:50.520
 I know they weren't all alive at the same time, but he was alive at the time.

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:54.560
 So he lived from 1846 to 1917.

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:56.640
 And I just think, under celebrated.

00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:58.640
 >> And don't confuse him with another Willie Hull,

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:02.520
 who was a person who designed all of England's coins and James the First.

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:03.120
 >> Yes.

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:03.640
 >> Yes.

00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:06.120
 >> And he, Proto Willie Hull, he was amazing.

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:06.720
 >> [LAUGH]

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:10.760
 >> Because I think, was it him, James, who would have been the same time?

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:13.160
 >> He invented the colouring inbook.

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:13.720
 >> [LAUGH]

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:14.200
 >> Really?

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:14.800
 >> Yes.

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.640
 >> He published the series of maps.

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:18.240
 There was this poem called Poly Albion,

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:20.440
 which was about all the parts of England and Scotland.

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:23.960
 And it was, there was the beautiful maps of weird things.

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:27.960
 The rivers were all on there, and there were weird mythical beasts all over the map.

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:31.160
 And it was fashionable to hand colour your own maps back in the day.

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:31.560
 >> Wow.

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:33.680
 >> And that was a big trend in the 1620s.

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:36.440
 Gentleman's manual said, if you're going to be a proper gentleman,

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:37.560
 you've got to know how to colour in.

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:37.960
 >> Right.

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:39.200
 >> [LAUGH]

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:39.720
 >> That's amazing.

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:40.720
 >> Don't go over the lines.

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:42.640
 >> If you want an eligible lady to marry you.

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:43.200
 >> Yeah.

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:45.920
 We also shouldn't forget William J. Hull,

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:49.800
 Willie Hull Jr., the American film director,

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:52.880
 mainly known for his B movies, really amazing.

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:56.560
 He did a movie called Hellbound, which he made for producer Howard Koch.

00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:58.440
 >> No.

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:02.920
 >> Yeah, and then he did Speed Crazy in 1959, which starred Charles Wilcox.

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:06.320
 >> So this is just going to be our sort of listing people with rude names, is it?

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:08.440
 >> Well, I actually looked to the Wikipedia list that's called-

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:09.200
 >> Right, okay, great.

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:10.520
 >> Other people who are called Willie.

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:12.600
 >> [LAUGH]

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:15.800
 >> Yeah, there's over 218 notable Willys out there.

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:19.400
 You've got the professional golfer in America called Willie Tucker.

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:21.560
 >> Lovely.

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:23.160
 >> There's- >> [LAUGH]

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:24.560
 >> And does that help in golf?

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:25.480
 James, you play golf.

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:26.840
 >> It can get in the way of your swings.

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:27.560
 >> Yeah, yeah.

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:28.760
 >> [LAUGH]

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:31.480
 >> There's the Austrian footballer called Willie Fitz.

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:33.360
 >> [LAUGH]

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:35.480
 >> There's the Kenyan runner called Willie Cumming.

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:36.680
 >> [LAUGH]

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:37.760
 >> Brilliant, super.

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:38.480
 >> Nice, yeah.

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:40.080
 >> That's all my research for the time.

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:41.280
 >> [LAUGH]

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:43.360
 >> The history of illustration, no.

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:46.760
 >> Yeah, I've got some quite dry stuff on the difference between a wood block and

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:47.960
 a wood cutting.

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:48.680
 >> That's what we want.

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:52.160
 >> But- >> But no, this one, so William Hall was at

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:55.760
 the tail end of a period where basically illustration was the only means of getting

00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:58.760
 any visual information to anyone else, as in-

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:00.960
 >> There was no YouTube, no TikTok.

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:02.520
 >> There was no TikTok.

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:06.080
 That was in the 1870s after his period, no.

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:10.360
 And basically, it was hugely important and usually legally contentious as well.

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:11.000
 >> Oh, really?

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.240
 >> So yeah, I was reading about James Gilray,

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:16.080
 who was the sort of the most famous artist of the early 19th century.

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:17.200
 >> Right. >> Who did caricatures.

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:21.040
 But they were so offensive and insulting that he was charged with blasphemy.

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:22.600
 >> Wow.

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:25.600
 >> That was, he drew the wise men and he was charged with blasphemy.

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:29.240
 Actually, the real reason was that the Prince of Wales was clearly in the picture.

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:31.080
 Being, you know- >> As one of the wise men or

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:33.680
 just like popping up behind, like he's photo bombed.

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:36.240
 >> There was a disgusting baby in there and there was all sorts of-

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:37.080
 >> Jesus.

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:40.280
 >> So I mean, sorry, in the drawing, in the drawing.

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:42.040
 >> Sorry about being arrested for blasphemy.

00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:46.240
 >> Sorry, in the satirical drawing.

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:48.400
 I'm not afraid of blasphemy charges, am I?

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:49.720
 >> Yeah.

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:52.680
 >> But basically, and you know, he was interviewed by George Canning.

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:57.200
 He was later the prime minister saying, look, I want a caricature of me.

00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:00.320
 And so the charge against him, the blasphemy charge was dropped and

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:02.080
 he was given a government pension.

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:06.800
 Gilray is the man who was responsible for everyone thinking that Napoleon was short.

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:07.400
 >> Oh, really?

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:08.280
 >> He was short.

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:09.920
 Napoleon was normal height.

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:13.000
 It's entirely thanks to someone drawing him 200 years ago,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.760
 that we think Napoleon Bonaparte was short.

00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:15.480
 >> That's so interesting.

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:19.120
 >> So that's the power these images had, just repeated and amplified and caricatured.

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:20.400
 >> Yeah. >> Wouldn't influence.

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:23.680
 >> So Willy Hall, he did caricatures of quite famous people, right?

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:26.680
 Like he did, I think, Jay and Barry and a few people like that.

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:30.680
 >> I think he mostly did work, as in he mostly would, Jay and Barry's books,

00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:31.440
 he would illustrate those.

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:33.120
 >> So not the author's illustrations, right?

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:33.720
 >> I don't think so.

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:38.160
 He illustrated Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde for Robert Louis Stevenson, and kidnapped.

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:42.240
 I read that Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde was written in six days and

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:45.440
 six nights while Louis Stevenson was on a cocaine bender.

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:47.440
 >> Yeah.

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:52.840
 >> And according to Robert Louis Stevenson.com, that's a myth.

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:55.400
 >> No, well, they would say that, wouldn't they?

00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:56.240
 >> Yeah, he feels like it.

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:59.400
 They said that he was on medication.

00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:03.280
 >> Yeah, but there's no evidence that he took cocaine for recreational purposes.

00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:07.480
 >> Willy Hall's grandmother, or great-grandmother, was Jamaican.

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:10.120
 >> Okay. >> Just very, just unusual to have

00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:12.920
 a mixed-race couple in the 1790s.

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:16.520
 But his Scottish father married a Jamaican woman in the 1790s.

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:21.560
 And the resulting child went on to be the first student of African descent at

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:25.120
 the University of Edinburgh, and then governor of Sierra Leone.

00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:27.600
 And that's Willy Hall, that's my Willy Hall fact.

00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:28.160
 >> It's good.

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:29.800
 >> It's not about, it's not about a funny name.

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:31.040
 >> But we're all learning.

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:34.000
 >> But we're all learning something.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.440
 >> Can I tell you maybe my favorite artist of the period?

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:38.880
 So George Cruikshank, right?

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:44.920
 Again, hugely influential caricaturist, satirist, drew outrageous things.

00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:48.240
 He once got a bribe of 100 quid from the king himself,

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:52.840
 saying please do not caricature his majesty in any immoral situation.

00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:55.800
 So that's how powerful he was at the time.

00:17:55.800 --> 00:18:00.880
 Imagine if the current king paid, I don't know, Michael McIntyre not to do any jokes about him.

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:04.640
 >> Is Michael McIntyre known as the most hardcore political satirist of our day?

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:06.840
 >> [LAUGH]

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:08.480
 >> Okay, Anton Deck, fine, whatever.

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:11.000
 >> [LAUGH]

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.760
 >> But he was a dreadful guy, Cruikshank, in his personal life.

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:16.800
 So he ill-treated his wife quite badly.

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:19.480
 He was an avowed anti-drink campaigner, right?

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:24.120
 So he looked strict, strict, strict, because his father had died of alcohol poisoning.

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:28.280
 He'd just won a drinking contest and then died his father.

00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:29.280
 >> All right.

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:30.320
 >> Died happy, though, at least.

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:31.640
 >> It's like the second worst result possible.

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:35.240
 >> That feels like a disqualification after the match, right?

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:38.360
 That feels like you gotta live at least a month, post.

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:42.960
 >> Yeah, but okay, here's the amazing thing about George Cruikshank, right?

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:44.200
 He was on his deathbed.

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:47.040
 >> Yeah. >> And he was talking to his wife,

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:48.960
 who he hadn't been terribly nice to.

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:51.160
 And he said, what will become of my children?

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:55.400
 And his wife said, what do you mean your children?

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:57.120
 >> We haven't got any children.

00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:58.680
 Now he had been married once before.

00:18:58.680 --> 00:18:59.680
 >> Uh-huh.

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:01.760
 >> That marriage hadn't produced any children either.

00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:05.200
 >> Well, it turned out, this is spicy gossip time.

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:07.120
 >> [LAUGH]

00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:09.840
 >> It turned out he had been leading a secret double life.

00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:13.560
 And he had mistress with whom he had had 11 children.

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:14.560
 >> Whoa.

00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:15.880
 >> [LAUGH]

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:19.280
 >> The last of whom was conceived when he was 82 years old.

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:20.400
 >> [LAUGH]

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:21.480
 >> Can you imagine?

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:24.720
 >> Yeah. >> I'm just popping out, whatever.

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:26.720
 >> It's so funny, his obituary said,

00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:30.040
 there never was a purer, simpler, more blameless man.

00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:32.520
 Something childlike in his transparency a week later,

00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:34.880
 the will was read out to which he left all of his money to his.

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:35.680
 >> My gosh.

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:36.680
 >> That's amazing.

00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:39.800
 >> You know, there's only one image of Shakespeare that we have.

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:40.600
 >> Okay, yeah, yeah.

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:43.960
 >> It's done by an engraver called Martin Droshoot.

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:45.200
 He was a Flemish.

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:46.960
 And it's kind of, you'll see it.

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:49.720
 Like, if you ever see a picture on an old book of Shakespeare,

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:52.240
 it's the one that you see, which is like black and white.

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:55.120
 >> Yeah, he's bold, he's got a pair on sides, yeah.

00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:59.600
 >> Now, it turns out that Martin Droshoot was a terrible, terrible drawer.

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:02.360
 Like, he was really, really bad.

00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:06.440
 And we only have one other portrait that he did, Francisco de la Pena.

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:09.400
 And it looks almost identical to the one he did of Shakespeare.

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:10.360
 >> Yeah.

00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:13.080
 >> And it seems like he only really knew how to draw one person.

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:18.720
 >> My God, so we don't know how likely it is that this actually looked like Shakespeare at all.

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:22.560
 >> Yeah, he actually had a Mahecan, according to sort of the time.

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:25.600
 Did you know, speaking of the influence that illustrators have,

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:28.720
 it was an illustrator who invented macaroni.

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:30.560
 Or who popularized macaroni.

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:32.440
 >> Okay, the pasta?

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:33.760
 Or the penguin?

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:37.280
 >> No, if you're being pedantic, neither, the pasta, nor the penguins.

00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:38.720
 >> It was like a look, wasn't it?

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:39.720
 >> A dandy, yeah.

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:41.720
 >> A dandy, yes.

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:46.840
 This, so a macaroni in England in the 1770s and '80s was,

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:49.280
 there was a fashion for men to be really effeminate.

00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:51.080
 They had, like, huge hair.

00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:54.720
 They particularly had massive hair, and then they wore a tiny hat on top.

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:56.720
 Which is so cool.

00:20:56.720 --> 00:21:02.280
 And sort of striped stockings and really tight pants and fancy walking sticks, bright colors.

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:05.040
 Anyway, there's a woman called Mary Dali.

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:08.440
 In fact, it was a husband and wife team, Matthew and Mary Dali.

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:10.000
 And Mary was the real caricature.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.200
 She sort of made caricaturing a thing, invented the art of caricaturing,

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:16.160
 like exaggerating these effects.

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:21.000
 And they made their name by having the macaroni print shop on the strand,

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.560
 where she basically drew caricatures of all these effeminate men,

00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:27.480
 created, popularized the macaroni.

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:28.080
 >> Yeah.

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:29.960
 >> You spoke about dandies before.

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:34.200
 Of course, the dandy is a Scottish illustration of sorts.

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:35.480
 >> Okay. >> What a great link.

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:36.080
 >> Thank you.

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:39.480
 >> Just leapfrogging from the 1760s to the 20th century comic book.

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:40.440
 >> That was very impressive.

00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:42.640
 >> Made by DC Thompson.

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:45.600
 And DC Thompson is also home to the world's oldest magazine,

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:47.400
 the Scots magazine.

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:51.400
 And in one of the early issues, they had a first-hand account of the Battle

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:51.960
 of Culloden.

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:54.520
 >> Really?

00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:56.360
 >> That's how old that is.

00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:58.160
 >> Wait, sorry, that wasn't the first issue of the dandy.

00:21:58.160 --> 00:21:59.200
 >> No. >> No, sorry.

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:00.760
 >> Sorry.

00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:03.040
 >> That was in DC Thompson.

00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:04.840
 >> Because it's desperate down, I've been on site.

00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:05.840
 It could have gone the other way.

00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:06.880
 >> Yeah.

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:10.320
 What was, can I, sorry to be ignorant, but what was the Battle of Culloga?

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:13.320
 >> That is.

00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:15.440
 >> Why don't you just ask someone in the street later on?

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:17.160
 >> Okay.

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:18.160
 I don't know what's known here.

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:20.880
 You don't know who Willie Hole is, but you know that battle that's going on.

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:23.240
 >> I'll tell you, I will tell you later, and I will tell you at some length.

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:24.960
 But it's really interesting.

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:29.120
 >> But on the subject of comics and DC Thompson stuff,

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:33.520
 I thought we could have a quick game of comic strip or darts nickname.

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:34.920
 >> Oh, okay.

00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:37.880
 >> Because I realized that some of these comic strips have kind of got similar

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:39.200
 names to the darts players.

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:41.040
 >> Oh, like Calamity James.

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:42.480
 >> Is a darts player?

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:44.240
 No.

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:49.400
 >> So for instance, Bow and Arrow, B-E-A-U and Arrow.

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:52.920
 Is that the name of a comic or is it the name of a darts player's nickname?

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:56.000
 >> It must be darts player because what is a dart but a tiny arrow.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.640
 >> Well, it's got to be a comic book, otherwise you wouldn't have presented it

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:00.360
 and tried to trick us into thinking it was a darts.

00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:02.520
 >> Do you get tag teams in darts?

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:06.200
 >> You can't have doubles, but it's true.

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:10.880
 >> You chuck it halfway along the distance and they lean over and hammer it at home.

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:18.520
 >> Yeah, no, you lift your arm up and Bow pulls it back and releases you.

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:22.560
 >> The answer is it was a double bluff and it's Bow Graves who's the current

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:25.440
 back-to-back two-time ladies world champion.

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:26.440
 >> Okay.

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:27.440
 >> It's a darts player.

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:28.440
 Dirty Dick.

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:29.440
 >> Oh.

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:30.440
 >> Darts player or comic book.

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:31.440
 >> I feel it seemed to be a comic.

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:32.720
 I'm going to say darts player.

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:33.720
 >> Yeah.

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:34.720
 >> Dirty Dick.

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:35.720
 >> Comic.

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:36.720
 >> Yeah, comic.

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:42.400
 >> It was a character from the dandy known as a boy who generally is in need of a good

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:43.400
 scrub.

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:46.000
 >> What about this one?

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.000
 Master Bates.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:53.160
 >> I always thought that Master Bates was the myth from Pugwash that claimed that it

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:54.160
 was --

00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:55.520
 >> And it was never actually a Master Bates.

00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:57.320
 >> Yeah, so you go for darts player?

00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:58.320
 >> Yeah.

00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:01.440
 >> Well, the truth is technically it's both.

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:06.400
 Because there was a character in Oliver Twist called Bates who's sometimes called Master

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:07.400
 Bates.

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:09.960
 And there is quite a few etchings of Master Bates.

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:13.840
 But also it was the nickname of darts player Owen Bates.

00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:14.840
 He's known as the master.

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:19.760
 >> He always has one hand in his pocket when he's playing.

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:21.360
 >> He always has it on his back.

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:23.160
 It says Owen the Master Bates.

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:26.840
 But when he qualified for the world championships they didn't allow him to use it.

00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:27.840
 >> That's fair enough.

00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:32.320
 >> You don't want to bring the noble sport of darts into disrepute.

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:40.440
 >> It is time for fact number three.

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:42.240
 And that is my fact.

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:49.240
 My fact this week is that the title "Prince of Thinkers" was awarded in France to a philosopher

00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:55.400
 whose greatest published work claimed humans were descended from frogs.

00:24:55.400 --> 00:25:02.280
 I'm sure you've all, like Willie Hull, have heard of Jean-Pierre Bresset.

00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:05.200
 This is a guy who was a philosopher.

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:06.200
 He was a writer.

00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:07.200
 He was a thinker.

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:08.200
 He was a bit of an outsider.

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:13.000
 He lived basically in the same bracket as Willie Hull, by the way, year-wise.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.000
 >> Time-wise.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.840
 >> Yeah, Willie Hull was born 1846, died 1917.

00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:21.400
 Jean-Pierre was 1837 to 1919.

00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:22.960
 >> Did they ever meet, do we know?

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:24.080
 >> Oh, good question.

00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:26.080
 >> No, they obviously didn't.

00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:27.880
 >> Yeah, they didn't.

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:29.680
 He was a fascinating guy.

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:35.200
 The first thing that he wrote was a thing called "Learning the Art of Swimming Alone

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:36.440
 in Less Than an Hour."

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:37.440
 >> That's fantastic.

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:40.200
 >> Yeah, it's amazing.

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:44.800
 It's basically five illustrations that show you how in the confines of your home, so it's

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:50.760
 not even within the water, you can just practice moves hundreds and hundreds of times so that

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:54.520
 when you eventually jump into the water for the first time, you know, how to swim.

00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:58.440
 >> If you do it 600 times, basically you know, and then that's it.

00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:03.300
 It might be that humans are descended from frog's theory, which we should say now is

00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:11.760
 not true, from, well, hang on, has not yet been proven, but because if you view a swimmer

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:15.520
 from above and they're doing something like breaststroke, they look a bit like a frog,

00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:19.400
 and so that might have linked frogs and humans together in his mind.

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:20.400
 >> Really?

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:23.480
 >> Yeah, we should say he wasn't an actual proper philosopher.

00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:29.840
 He was a nobody, but it's quite amazing how famous he sort of became to a niche bunch

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:30.840
 of people.

00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:36.560
 So the only reason he became famous was because there was a prank organized by a bunch of

00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:43.680
 kind of the literati artist led by a guy called Jules Romain who decided to award this Prince

00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:45.160
 of Thinker's thing.

00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:47.720
 Jules Romain had come across his book.

00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:49.480
 I think he'd just been rifling through a library, hadn't he?

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:50.480
 >> Yeah.

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:54.400
 >> So it was like humans are descended from frogs, and the logic was so mad.

00:26:54.400 --> 00:27:00.360
 So he believed that any words in a language that sounded like other words, that wasn't

00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:03.920
 a coincidence, that told you something very important.

00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:09.480
 So for instance, the word "ren" for queen sounds like the old French word "ren" for

00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:10.480
 frog.

00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:14.440
 So he was like, okay, frogs must be really important.

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:19.280
 He was then walking past a pond when he noticed not only do frogs look a lot like humans in

00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:20.280
 their bodies.

00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:21.280
 So he thought.

00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:26.080
 But they also were saying "go up, go up," which is French, of course, for "what?"

00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:27.080
 "What?"

00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:28.080
 >> What?

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:29.080
 That's so good.

00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:33.960
 >> And the idea being that when frogs finally got self-conscious and understood that they

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:37.680
 were part of the world, the first thing that they would say is, "What?"

00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:39.600
 >> There you go.

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:40.600
 There you go.

00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:42.520
 It's all very interesting.

00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:48.840
 We should just quickly go back a second on the Prince of Thinker's thing here, because

00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:50.760
 it's quite a mean thing that happened.

00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:55.760
 He was told that this big vote had happened and that he was being made the Prince of

00:27:55.760 --> 00:28:00.240
 Thinkers, and they brought him into Paris on a train, and he was met at the station by

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:05.200
 a group of people, and he was given flowers by children, and some poet had written a very

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:07.480
 special piece specifically for him.

00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:11.600
 >> He was asked to make a speech in front of the Rodin statue, "The Thinker," of his

00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:13.520
 kind of acceptance speech.

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:15.840
 It's unbelievably unkind in hindsight.

00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:22.560
 Imagine if the most eminent authors in the world invited you, Dan, saying, "We have

00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:28.840
 Richard Osmond saying it, Dan Brown's in there, McEwan, Ishiguro, all of the biggies."

00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:32.480
 They write to you, Dan, and they say, "We actually think your book is going to change

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:33.480
 the world.

00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:34.480
 It's seminal.

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:37.280
 Please come to the British Library and stand in front of the statue of Isaac Newton and

00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:40.840
 make a speech," and then it turns out it was a prank, and they actually think the book

00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:41.840
 is rubbish.

00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:43.720
 That's basically what happened to this guy.

00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:44.720
 It is cruel.

00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:45.720
 I think that would be cruel.

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:49.760
 I don't see any evidence that he ever knew, and I think they might have felt a bit bad.

00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:50.760
 So Jules Romain ...

00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:51.760
 >> Shit.

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:52.760
 It's incredible.

00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:55.020
 >> It wasn't the newspapers the next day.

00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:56.020
 >> It was too successful.

00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:57.020
 It went too well.

00:28:57.020 --> 00:29:01.800
 So I think Jules Romain left money for a banquet to be held in his name every year thereafter,

00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:06.680
 and it did go until 1939, possibly because he felt a bit bad about humiliating this guy.

00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:10.360
 >> To be honest, reading up on it, I'm a bit confused about what they genuinely thought,

00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:14.080
 because if you read Marcel Duchamp writes about it, and he knew of the work of Brisee

00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:18.880
 as well, I think they were taking the piss, and it was elaborate, but they were surrealists,

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:22.880
 and they were doing a surreal thing here, but I think they admired the thinking.

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:26.920
 I think they genuinely thought, "This guy is a weird thinker, and we should be celebrating."

00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:29.120
 >> They were doing all sorts of stuff like that, weren't they?

00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:30.840
 It was like, "Found art," kind of thing.

00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:32.440
 It's like, "We found this thing.

00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:34.000
 We're going to turn it into art.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.640
 We're going to turn it into something special."

00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:36.640
 >> Yeah.

00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:40.000
 I think Richard Osman really liked my book, actually.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:46.520
 But there were quite a lot of these, what are known in English as "outside of writers,"

00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:51.960
 and in French as "fou littoré," like means "mad writers," but there were quite a lot

00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:53.280
 of them at the time.

00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:59.840
 For instance, there was a guy called Alexis Vincent Charles Berbaguier, Newfoundland Time,

00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:03.520
 who wrote books about the imps that were following him around.

00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:08.800
 His surname, Time, was chosen because he thought that the time the herb repelled the

00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:15.520
 imps, and he planned to plant an enormous time field so that it would repel all of the

00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:17.040
 imps.

00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:20.040
 So that was one of them.

00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:23.520
 >> I did read about him, because he read that the imps and the leprechauns that followed

00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:27.720
 him around made him sneeze and fart enormously, and that was a huge problem.

00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:28.720
 >> No, it's not me.

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:29.720
 It was the imps.

00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:32.720
 He wants to buy himself a dog.

00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:37.520
 There was a guy called Raymond Russell, who wrote these really long poems, but instead

00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:42.320
 of rhyming, each line was kind of related to the previous one by the words, so you might

00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:46.320
 have a line which is about a dog, and the next one's about a bog, and the next one's

00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:49.400
 about a bot, and like that, but they're really, really, really long.

00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:54.560
 It would have footnotes explaining what he'd done to make that line that was related to

00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:59.320
 the previous line, and his footnotes could have footnotes, and that could go like five

00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:02.720
 footnotes deep for all of it, so it was all footnotes.

00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:05.400
 >> The David Foster Wallace of his time, and equally tedious.

00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:10.440
 Well, according to the French Wikipedia, perhaps not surprisingly, Roussel was unpopular during

00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:15.120
 his life, and critical reception of his works was almost unanimously negative.

00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:16.120
 >> Oh, man.

00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:17.120
 >> Yeah.

00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:18.120
 Well, there was loads of them around.

00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:21.200
 I think it was just like, pretty much anyone could get stuff printed.

00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:22.200
 >> Yeah.

00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:23.200
 >> That's great.

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:24.200
 >> But I feel like a lot of them were self-conscious.

00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:26.080
 >> They were often rich white men.

00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:29.720
 >> Yeah, yeah, and they knew what they were doing, whereas this guy didn't.

00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:35.200
 I found something quite random about Brisset, which is that, so he was in the army, and I

00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:38.800
 think something quite odd about him, and this is often surprising today, about people who

00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:43.360
 hold very strange beliefs, Dan, you know a lot of these people.

00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:49.520
 They function very normally in the rest of their life, and so he, as we've said, he

00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:50.800
 worked on the railways.

00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:54.000
 They did try to sack him a few times from the railways, because he did have some quite

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.440
 strange ideas that they attributed to a head wound, from being in the army.

00:31:57.440 --> 00:31:58.440
 >> What?

00:31:58.440 --> 00:31:59.440
 Yeah, what were the ideas?

00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:02.480
 >> Well, there were a lot of the stuff we've just talked about, how all humans are descended

00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:03.480
 from frogs, that kind of thing.

00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:04.480
 >> Oh, not trains specifically.

00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:07.920
 >> Yeah, it made it sound like he was saying the trains should all run backwards.

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:10.840
 >> No, sorry, he made the trains run fine, he just kept on wanging on about this whole

00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:13.280
 humans from frogs idea.

00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:18.160
 But he was wounded in 1859 at the Battle of Magenta, which was a battle of France and

00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:19.160
 Italy versus Austria.

00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:24.440
 It was a huge success and victory for the French, and I just didn't know that that's

00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:25.440
 where the colour comes from.

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:26.440
 >> From the battle?

00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:27.440
 >> Yeah.

00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:28.440
 >> Really?

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:31.160
 >> Yeah, so it was this big success, the Battle of Magenta, for the French, and at the same

00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:36.000
 time, French chemists produced the colour that they called Fushina, and then they were

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:39.640
 like, hang on, we've just had this big victory, do you mind if we rename that magenta?

00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:40.880
 >> What colour is magenta again?

00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:41.880
 >> What colour?

00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:45.120
 >> The one in the printer that always runs out, even though you never use it.

00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:46.120
 >> Thank you.

00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:47.840
 Hello, old friend.

00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:48.840
 Okay.

00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:51.480
 Language, how we got language in the first place?

00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:52.480
 >> Oh yeah.

00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:55.480
 >> The theory, because the 19th century was a time when lots of people were trying to

00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:56.480
 work out.

00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:57.480
 How did we get language?

00:32:57.480 --> 00:32:58.480
 And the theories were fantastic.

00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:03.360
 >> Because we just had the theory of evolution, had come in with Darwin, and people thought,

00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:06.800
 well, surely language must have evolved in the same way, so can we fill in some of the

00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:07.800
 gaps?

00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:08.800
 >> Yeah, exactly.

00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:09.800
 So the Bow Wow theory.

00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:10.800
 Language.

00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:11.800
 >> We came from dogs.

00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:12.800
 >> We came from dogs?

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:16.120
 No, it's the language comes from animal sounds, and the humans started language off by doing

00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:17.120
 impressions of animals.

00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:18.120
 >> Really?

00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:19.640
 >> To communicate with each other.

00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:23.920
 So for example, James, I've got, if we don't have language, I've got no way of saying there's

00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:27.200
 a dog behind you, unless I say woof, right?

00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:28.200
 >> Sure.

00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:32.960
 >> But how do you say it to someone in another country that doesn't know the word woof?

00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:36.640
 Because in English, we say woof, but dogs don't objectively say woof, and they don't

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:39.120
 say Bow Wow, and in all different countries, they say different things.

00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:42.560
 >> Yeah, but I'd go, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, and if you would know there was a dog behind

00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:43.560
 you, we're in the same room.

00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:45.800
 It's just 30,000 years ago, Wendy Anderfields.

00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:46.800
 >> Wendy Anderfields.

00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:47.800
 >> Yeah.

00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:51.600
 And the guy who came up with this was a guy called, I love this, Johann Herder.

00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:52.600
 >> Oh yeah.

00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:53.600
 >> Okay.

00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:54.600
 >> What do dogs do?

00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:57.720
 >> Has he worked out what he thinks the words have evolved into?

00:33:57.720 --> 00:34:00.040
 What does that, wow, wow, wow, what does that become?

00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:03.680
 >> I don't know enough of what, this is the late 18th century, so I haven't read enough

00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:04.680
 of his stuff.

00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:08.440
 I think it was that you start off with rah, rah, rah, rah, and then eventually you get

00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:09.440
 to woof.

00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:10.440
 >> Hang on.

00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:15.200
 >> And then, like, a few more steps, a few more steps, I'm not going to spell out, and

00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:16.920
 then we've got this podcast.

00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:21.000
 >> Do you know what dogs say in Burma, just while we're on this subject?

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:22.000
 >> Dogs say in Burma.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.840
 >> They say, woke, woke, woke, woke, like a GB news presenter.

00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:31.800
 >> Because I pissed off everyone's calling it Mayanmar, aren't they?

00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:32.800
 Listen, Andy.

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:37.080
 >> That's the best Burma-Mayanmar joke you'll hear on this day for weeks.

00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:38.720
 >> How much do we believe in?

00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:41.480
 Because I believe this theory 100% right now.

00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:44.480
 This sounds like the most sensible thing I've ever heard on this podcast.

00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:47.460
 It's the first thing that kids do, like you're speaking to your kid, you teach them the noises

00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:48.460
 that animals make.

00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:49.960
 Of course language came from there.

00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:52.240
 But what about the yo-he-ho theory?

00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:53.240
 >> What's the yo-he-ho?

00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:54.240
 >> Hang on.

00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:55.240
 This sounds better.

00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:56.240
 >> We all evolve from pirates?

00:34:56.240 --> 00:34:57.240
 >> Basically.

00:34:57.240 --> 00:34:58.840
 >> Basically, yeah.

00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:03.720
 This is Edward Burnett Tyler in 1871, proposed that language evolve when you're doing manual

00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:05.080
 labor together.

00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:06.280
 You might be rowing.

00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:07.880
 You might be hauling logs.

00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:14.080
 And you have to say, row, row, or yo-he-ho, or whatever, and that gradually evolves into

00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:15.280
 more complicated structures.

00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:19.640
 But it's basically you need some kind of shared sound that we all make when we're pulling

00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:20.640
 a log, or whatever.

00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:21.640
 >> I like that.

00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:22.640
 >> There's also the poo-poo theory.

00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:23.640
 >> Oh, what's the poo-poo theory?

00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:30.040
 >> The poo-poo theory is that it comes from automatic responses from disgust or happiness

00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:31.040
 or something.

00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:33.200
 So you see something and you go, poo.

00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:34.400
 You just make that automatically.

00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:35.400
 It's not a word.

00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:37.040
 And then eventually words evolve from that.

00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:38.680
 >> I think it's the woof-woof thing.

00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:39.680
 >> Do you?

00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:46.360
 >> There's a very famous philosopher and linguist called Ferdinand de Saussur, who you've all

00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:50.400
 heard of, as had I before I started researching for this, of course.

00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:53.320
 But he's one of the founders of linguistics, apparently.

00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:56.200
 Anyway, so he's very well respected.

00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:58.200
 He died in 1913.

00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:02.960
 Sometime after he died, eight cardboard boxes were found that belonged to him that showed

00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:07.760
 he was obsessed with the idea that all of classical literature had hidden anagrams within

00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:08.760
 it.

00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:09.920
 And people still talk about this.

00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:15.680
 People still kind of write papers about what this means and whether it's justifiable.

00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:20.680
 But he just got obsessed with the idea there are all these weird anagrams and phony matching

00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:22.880
 and patterns in classical literature.

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:23.880
 >> That's really interesting.

00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:24.880
 >> It's so weird.

00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:25.880
 >> It's so weird about finding the patterns.

00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:30.840
 It's the same with Brisset, I guess, because he said, okay, we've all evolved from frogs

00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:36.000
 and these frogs saying qua, and then that goes into what in French?

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:40.240
 But he kind of assumes that French is the original language, right?

00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:41.240
 >> Yeah.

00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:42.240
 >> That's the big problem with this theory.

00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:43.240
 >> Well, he says, yeah.

00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:45.240
 >> But what's the nickname for the French?

00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:46.240
 Frogs.

00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:47.240
 >> Oh.

00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:49.160
 >> I'm just saying.

00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:50.160
 >> Holy shit.

00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:51.160
 >> Maybe there's something.

00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:52.160
 Have I just blown this shit wide open?

00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:59.200
 >> You've blown this shit wide open.

00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:02.100
 >> We need to move on to our final fact of the show, all right?

00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:06.520
 It is time for our final fact of the show, and that is Anna.

00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:13.240
 My fact this week is that in 1968, a pig was nominated as a US presidential candidate,

00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:17.760
 but was arrested in the middle of his acceptance speech.

00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:19.840
 >> When we're saying his acceptance speech.

00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:23.440
 >> They're very eloquent pigs, if you would just listen.

00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:24.440
 >> Yeah.

00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:25.440
 >> Yeah.

00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:28.440
 >> Don't say, oh, yeah, he made sense to me.

00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:34.120
 Honestly, I was thinking of the pig from Babe, and I was like, he was eloquent.

00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:35.120
 >> It wasn't that pig.

00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:36.120
 >> It was a different pig.

00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:43.120
 This is a pig called Pegasus, and he was a presidential candidate of the yippies, which

00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:49.760
 were a political party slash incoate group of late 1960s sort of activist dissenters

00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:55.800
 who sort of didn't like the war in Vietnam, as no one did, and they made a big fuss about

00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:56.800
 it.

00:37:56.800 --> 00:38:00.520
 And one of the big fusses they made was this was two days before the big Democrat conference,

00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:04.920
 National Convention, and they showed up, they called a press conference, and they rocked

00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:10.240
 up with this pig candidate, and one of their leaders, Jerry Rubin, started to do the acceptance

00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:15.720
 speech on the pig's behalf, because the pig was very shy, and interrupted halfway through

00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:20.520
 by the police, who genuinely arrested all the candidates, including the pig, and took

00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:21.520
 them away.

00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:25.120
 >> I read a rumour that he was subsequently eaten by one of the police officers.

00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:26.840
 >> Yeah, I heard that as well.

00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:28.000
 >> That's a rumour.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:33.520
 I don't think it is, and the reason I don't think it is, is that it's quite difficult

00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:38.040
 to just go from a live pig in your possession to it being on your dining room table, isn't

00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:39.040
 it?

00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:40.040
 >> You've got to have a kit, haven't you?

00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:41.040
 >> You've got to have a gear.

00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:45.000
 >> Yeah, actually, I read a different rumour that he was married off and taken to a farm

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:48.040
 to live with Mrs. Pegasus, which is a nicer...

00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:49.040
 >> Oh, that's a nice one.

00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:51.400
 >> Yeah, and I think that's plausible as well.

00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:53.240
 >> Probably somewhere in between is the truth.

00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:56.280
 >> Probably rehoused and then eventually eaten.

00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:57.280
 >> Yeah.

00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:58.280
 >> There we go.

00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:04.640
 >> I read a further rumour that months, like five months after this incident, the Yippies

00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:09.800
 held an honorary, what they called, "Inhoguration" for Pegasus.

00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:10.800
 >> Lovely.

00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:12.560
 >> Yeah, it's all great stuff.

00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:13.560
 >> It's good stuff.

00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:18.280
 I think they were fun, protesters had quite a lot of fun in the '60s, as well as being

00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:19.280
 very angry.

00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:20.280
 >> Well, this is Flower Power.

00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:24.360
 If you want to put a name that's connected to it, Abby Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, they were

00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:30.640
 all part of this big moment of saying anti-war and peace is needed, but they were pranksters

00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:35.600
 and they were also pulling stunts like this to sort of get themselves in enough trouble

00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:39.760
 that they made a statement, but nothing, you know, bringing a pig to a nomination is not

00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:40.760
 really dangerous.

00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:41.760
 >> Yeah, it wasn't even in the building.

00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:43.080
 It was sort of easy.

00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:49.640
 They were nicknamed the Groucho Marxists, but the Yippies, as they got called, it stood

00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:54.640
 for the Youth International Party, but actually they were named, because one of their founders,

00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:59.440
 a guy called Krasna, was going through the alphabet for words that rhymed with hippie,

00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:03.520
 and eventually got to, like, almost the last gasp, we got to Yippie, and they thought,

00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:06.920
 "Oh, yeah, we could make that stand for Youth International Party if we, you know, mangled

00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:07.920
 it a bit."

00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:08.920
 >> Yeah.

00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:09.920
 >> And so, they didn't get the name first and then come up with the acronym.

00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:12.120
 They came up with the acronym first and then back-formed it.

00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:13.120
 >> Yeah.

00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:16.560
 >> And they did take it seriously as well as being pranksters, like the whole pig thing,

00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:18.520
 there was a big argument about it.

00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:22.680
 So I guess the three main people were Abby and Anita Hoffman, who were a couple, and

00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:24.180
 Jerry Rubin.

00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:30.880
 And Abby and Anita Hoffman bought the first pig for this big press conference and presented

00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:34.880
 it to Jerry Rubin, who rejected the pig out of hand, was furious, said, "This is too small.

00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:36.040
 It's too attractive.

00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:37.040
 We need a big pig.

00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:38.540
 We need an ugly pig."

00:40:38.540 --> 00:40:39.540
 And he had to himself.

00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:40.540
 >> Why not?

00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:41.760
 I've seen another picture here.

00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:42.760
 He's not that.

00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:43.760
 I've seen bigger pigs.

00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:44.760
 >> I've seen bigger pigs.

00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:45.760
 >> I agree.

00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:51.280
 It's an attractive pig to my eyes, but it was supposed to represent sort of political power

00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:54.280
 of the day, I suppose, and that's ugly.

00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:55.640
 That's the satire there.

00:40:55.640 --> 00:40:59.840
 >> The other thing they did very famously was walk to the Pentagon and try and levitate

00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:00.840
 it.

00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:01.840
 >> Yeah.

00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:02.840
 That's right.

00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:03.840
 >> It's really interesting.

00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:08.620
 When you speak to people who were on this march, and there was a lot of them, most of

00:41:08.620 --> 00:41:12.480
 them say, "Yeah, we were just going for a long, for the fun, and we weren't really going

00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:13.840
 to levitate it."

00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:18.400
 And then some of them, admittedly, who were kind of off their tits on LSD, they actually

00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:19.800
 thought they were going to levitate it.

00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:21.600
 I genuinely think some of them thought they were.

00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:25.520
 >> Yeah, they thought they were going to send psychic energy towards it until the building

00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:30.080
 itself turned orange with the energy and vibration, and then it would slowly levitate, and they

00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:34.080
 were going to do it by psychic energy, Tibetan chants, and as you say, they knew it was a

00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:37.680
 joke, but then there were people that thought, "Well, if enough of us did it, maybe this

00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:39.200
 would actually work."

00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:43.080
 And it was, you know, I mean, the names that keep cropping up, if you know your counterculture

00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:44.080
 America well.

00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:45.080
 >> Wait, what happened?

00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:46.080
 Sorry.

00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:47.080
 >> Oh, yeah, so it lifted up.

00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:48.080
 It turned orange.

00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:49.080
 >> It's still there.

00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:50.080
 It's still in the air now.

00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:51.080
 >> It's a nightmare.

00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:52.080
 You've got to get in by ladder.

00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:53.080
 It's insane.

00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:54.080
 Nothing happened, Andy.

00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:55.080
 It didn't work.

00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:56.080
 Sorry.

00:41:56.080 --> 00:42:01.400
 >> Well, Alan Ginsberg, who's one of these counterculture guys, he said, "The Pentagon

00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:04.920
 was symbolically levitated in people's minds."

00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:05.920
 >> Oh.

00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:06.920
 >> Yeah, that's such a...

00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:07.920
 >> That's pretty good.

00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:08.920
 >> ...crap excuse.

00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:09.920
 >> That's like my facts on this show.

00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:13.600
 It is true if you just believe hard enough.

00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:17.400
 He, Hoffman, by the way, I'm saying that he was sort of part of a peaceful movement and

00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:18.400
 so on.

00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:22.960
 But, you know, he did write a very infamous book, which was called "Steal This Book."

00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:27.720
 Kind of like the Anarchist Cook book, it had a lot of stuff in there that you don't want

00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:28.720
 people reading.

00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:31.720
 You know, there was bomb-making, that kind of stuff in order to...

00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:35.960
 But it was largely a book about how can you help with the troubles that are going on?

00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:39.120
 How can you make a point, but have little hacks to get through it?

00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:44.000
 So, for example, if you need to talk to a large crowd, don't spend ages doing what we

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:45.000
 have here.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:46.000
 You know, like...

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:47.000
 >> Booking a theater.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:48.000
 >> Booking a theater.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:49.000
 All that stuff.

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:50.000
 There's a lot of money.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.140
 You know, go to a show where there's a theater booked and before the show starts, jump on

00:42:53.140 --> 00:42:54.140
 stage.

00:42:54.140 --> 00:42:55.140
 They've got a PA system.

00:42:55.140 --> 00:42:59.560
 Just use what they're using and go and don't do it here, obviously, Glasgow, but that's

00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:03.760
 what his suggestion was and always do it prior to a show because you don't want to preach

00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:06.560
 to people who are going to get angry at you for interrupting a show.

00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:07.560
 >> That's fine.

00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:08.560
 That's not too dangerous.

00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:12.080
 The bookmaking stuff is bad, but I think interrupting someone's show...

00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:13.080
 >> Yeah, yeah.

00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:14.080
 >> I'm okay with that.

00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:17.040
 >> No, arguably the most dangerous thing about the book was it's called "Steal This Book,"

00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:19.520
 encouraging everyone to not pay for it in the shops that they were.

00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:20.520
 And that's what...

00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:21.520
 >> Did it happen?

00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:22.520
 That happened?

00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:23.520
 >> Yeah, it did get stolen.

00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:26.280
 He should have called it "Buy This Book" or "Buy Ten Copies of This Book."

00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:27.280
 >> Yes.

00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:31.720
 >> I think that might have defeated his object while, yes, making him some more money, James.

00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:35.960
 >> I think he did call his autobiography something like coming to a theater near you or something

00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:38.800
 like that, soon to be adapted into cinema.

00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:41.280
 Yeah, so he did have titles like that.

00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:45.040
 >> I think on the last page of the bucket, it has a list of other books worth stealing.

00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:46.040
 >> Nice.

00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:47.040
 >> Oh, that's nice.

00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:50.080
 >> Oh, I thought you were about to list all of our books, so it was a bit of slight publicity,

00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:51.080
 but no, okay.

00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:54.480
 >> They invaded Disneyland in 1970.

00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:57.200
 They managed a huge victory there.

00:43:57.200 --> 00:44:00.280
 That night, Disneyland had to close slightly early.

00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:01.280
 >> Wow.

00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:03.240
 >> Take that, the men.

00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:07.480
 >> But supposedly, Andy was only the second time in Disney's history where they had to

00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:11.120
 shut and get everyone out in order to deal with the situation, so for Disney, it was

00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:15.160
 a big deal because they were going to liberate Minnie Mouse.

00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:18.120
 They were staying on Tom Sawyer's Island.

00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:20.920
 >> They wanted to liberate Minnie Mouse and cook Porky Pig.

00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:24.760
 Again, another very pig-based, they clearly turned to violence by this point.

00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:27.760
 It's just two years after they were being nice to pigs.

00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:29.560
 >> But you're missing the main thing about that.

00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:32.240
 Porky Pig's not a Disney character, so it's not even there.

00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:34.120
 So they got there, and there was no Porky Pig.

00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:37.880
 >> You've got to know your genre, you know your brand.

00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:41.160
 Hoffman played by Sasha Baron Cohen quite recently, if anyone's ever seen the film,

00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:44.640
 The Trial of the Chicago Seven, and very confusing.

00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:48.560
 So The Trial of the Chicago Seven was basically, there was a huge riot, and they were all put

00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:54.560
 on trial, these guys, and Hoffman and Reuben went into court wearing judicial robes, basically

00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:55.560
 disguised as the judge.

00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:56.560
 >> Brilliant.

00:44:56.560 --> 00:45:01.200
 >> This was even more confusing, given that the judge was also called Hoffman.

00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:06.920
 And then so confusingly, Reuben, the other one, went on to meet a nemesis.

00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:13.360
 He moved to Miami, and he decided to lead this thing to occupy a golf course for one

00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:15.720
 to achieve one of his aims with a bunch of people.

00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:20.280
 And he met his nemesis, who was also called Reuben, so it was Reuben versus Reuben, faced

00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:23.040
 off against each other in this church in Miami.

00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:26.640
 And then he turned into a stockbroker.

00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:30.400
 >> And they went on tours with Yopi versus Yipi, didn't they?

00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:31.400
 >> They did.

00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:35.080
 This is after Jerry Reuben became this big-shot stockbroker, and kept saying, but it's good,

00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:37.200
 it's all part of the be good plan.

00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:38.200
 >> What's a Yopi again?

00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:39.200
 What's that, Definder?

00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:40.800
 >> Young, openly mobile professional person.

00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:41.800
 >> Yeah.

00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:44.080
 >> Just a comment from the '80s with a big mobile phone.

00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:45.080
 >> Yeah.

00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:46.080
 >> Okay, right.

00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:51.680
 >> So Anita and Abby Hoffman had a child that they called America.

00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:54.760
 America with a small a, because they didn't want him to be pretentious.

00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:59.240
 But actually, it does seem okay, actually.

00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:02.080
 >> That will come across really well over the phone, won't it?

00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:03.080
 No, no, no.

00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:04.080
 Small a.

00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:07.800
 >> He later changed his name to Alan.

00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:09.880
 >> Still with a small a?

00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:15.400
 >> No, he's now half Alan and half America, because he's changed his name back to America,

00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:18.400
 but he's kept the capital a from Alan.

00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:19.400
 >> Right.

00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:20.880
 >> General political protests?

00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:21.880
 >> Yeah, sure.

00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:23.400
 >> Now's not the time, Andy.

00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:26.200
 >> I've gathered us all here for a reason.

00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:30.200
 No, I was just reading about other protests of various kinds.

00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:33.600
 So pig-based protests, actually, specifically I started looking into.

00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:34.600
 >> Okay.

00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:35.600
 >> There was one in Taiwan a few years ago.

00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:36.600
 It was a big debate.

00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:40.400
 Do we let an American pork, which has been treated with this particular chemical, spanned

00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:41.400
 in lots of countries?

00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:45.280
 Anyway, this was the report from, I think, the New York Times.

00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:50.120
 Members of the Kuomintang on Friday threw pig hearts, intestines, lungs, and other innards.

00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:52.040
 This is in parliament.

00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:56.320
 This parliament became a, what's it called, Mardi Gras, what's the tomato thing?

00:46:56.320 --> 00:46:57.320
 >> Oh, tamatina.

00:46:57.320 --> 00:46:59.180
 >> Yeah, it was like that, but with pig hearts.

00:46:59.180 --> 00:47:00.180
 >> Oh.

00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:03.960
 >> And they threw other innards, leaving the chambers crimson carpet street with ropey

00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:09.360
 strands of intestine and milky viscera.

00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:13.200
 Some lawmakers donned rain jackets, others brawled in business suits soiled by what appeared

00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:14.520
 to be bits of pig fat.

00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:15.520
 >> Oh.

00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:18.680
 >> So, you know, just when you think our politicians are bad, that's...

00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:20.360
 >> No, that's great.

00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:21.520
 We could do with more of that.

00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:26.760
 >> We would all tune into BBC Parliament if we were expecting awful to be hurled around

00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:27.760
 it.

00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:28.760
 >> That is true.

00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:33.200
 >> Similarly, in 1975, there was a group of vegetarians in Michigan that protested McDonald's.

00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:35.200
 It was a two-floor McDonald's.

00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:39.600
 They went to the top floor and all vomited onto the people below.

00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:40.600
 >> On command?

00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:45.320
 >> They all downed a mixture of mustard and water and then immediately vomited.

00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:46.320
 >> Wow.

00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:47.320
 >> But not in unison, right?

00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:48.320
 You can't...

00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:49.320
 And that would take so much practice.

00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:50.320
 Synchronising.

00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:55.760
 >> I don't like the fountains of the Bellagio, I don't think, but it was kind of around

00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:57.560
 the same time, at least.

00:47:57.560 --> 00:48:03.640
 And the newspapers got a press release afterwards, which they reported was written in either

00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:05.280
 blood or chocolate syrup.

00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:07.760
 I'm going to go for the latter.

00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:08.760
 >> Yeah.

00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:15.520
 >> There was an election in Iceland this year, and one of the candidates, or someone who's

00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:22.840
 trying to become a candidate, was Snaesfell Jorkudl, which is a glacier.

00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:27.720
 The rules say that to become president, you have to be an Icelandic citizen, and actually,

00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:33.560
 in Iceland a few years ago, they made a new law that all of the glaciers are now citizens.

00:48:33.560 --> 00:48:34.920
 So it passed on that.

00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:43.320
 You had to be age over 35, glacier, 700,000 years old, and no criminal record.

00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:48.440
 And the only reason that it didn't become is they didn't get enough signatures.

00:48:48.440 --> 00:48:49.440
 People didn't sign.

00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:51.680
 Otherwise, there's no reason why it couldn't do.

00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:56.360
 And it's actually the glacier that's mentioned in Journey to the Centre of the Earth by Shilfern.

00:48:56.360 --> 00:48:57.360
 >> Oh, wow.

00:48:57.360 --> 00:48:58.360
 >> Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:48:58.360 --> 00:48:59.360
 >> That's the one they go through.

00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:00.840
 So that could have been President of Iceland.

00:49:00.840 --> 00:49:01.840
 >> Oh, man.

00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:03.440
 >> And they're going to go for it again next time.

00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:06.960
 >> That would have been so nice, just for someone for Joe Biden to stand next to him,

00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:16.360
 feel young, and sprightly.

00:49:16.360 --> 00:49:17.360
 >> That is it.

00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:18.360
 That is all of our facts.

00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:19.680
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:22.640
 We will be back again next time with another episode.

00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:24.280
 But thank you so much, Glasgow.

00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:25.280
 That was awesome.

00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:26.360
 And we'll see you all again.

00:49:26.360 --> 00:49:27.360
 Goodbye.

00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:42.080
 [Applause]

00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:44.660
 (upbeat music)

00:49:44.660 --> 00:49:54.660
