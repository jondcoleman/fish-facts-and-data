00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:04,660
 >> You can sing along.

 [MUSIC]

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:16,240
 >> Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,

5
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,400
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Glasgow.

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,720
 >> [APPLAUSE]

7
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,480
 >> My name is Jan Schreiber.

8
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,280
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin.

9
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:35,960
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

10
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,640
 facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go.

11
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,560
 Starting with fact number one, that is James.

12
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:47,080
 >> Okay, my fact this week is that according to DNA analysis,

13
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,460
 Beethoven wasn't very musical.

14
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,240
 >> [LAUGH]

15
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:55,040
 >> Is that saying something about Beethoven or about DNA analysis and

16
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,520
 how it sort of is not?

17
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,520
 >> We might come to Beethoven, in fact, I'm sure we will.

18
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,240
 But this is basically a study where they looked at Beethoven's DNA.

19
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:08,600
 And they looked at the DNA of a load of students in a couple of universities,

20
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,120
 one in Tennessee and one in the Netherlands.

21
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:16,400
 And what they were saying is that DNA tests can't really give much to

22
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,800
 historical people and tell you about their characters really.

23
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,760
 It's kind of a warning against that.

24
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,720
 But in actual fact, Beethoven, well, he wasn't like Mozart.

25
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,880
 Like Mozart when he was age four could play incredible pieces.

26
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,280
 But Beethoven couldn't hold a tune, he could not write a tune.

27
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,320
 >> No, he wasn't really.

28
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,120
 >> I like him.

29
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:37,200
 I don't love him, I like him, but he could not write a melody to save himself.

30
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,040
 And I bet he'd say he was above that.

31
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,480
 You know when you get some avant-garde pop stars who say,

32
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,880
 I don't write the catchy songs because they're beneath me.

33
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,440
 Locks them before me in Glasgow actually.

34
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,680
 >> Wait, so we're- >> [LAUGH]

35
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,600
 >> Yes, all of Beethoven's very uncatchy tunes, like da, da, da, da.

36
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,380
 >> Come on, that's the only one.

37
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,840
 >> It's a pretty solid riff.

38
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,580
 >> I'm sorry, I disagree with that completely.

39
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:00,480
 Just on this study of the Beethoven's sort of DNA that they study,

40
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,920
 they had a lock of hair from Beethoven.

41
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,280
 And in fact, they had eight locks of hair.

42
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,560
 This was really exciting.

43
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,040
 But only five of them were genetically identical.

44
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:11,080
 >> So what does that mean?

45
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,240
 >> Three of them were fake.

46
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,040
 >> Oh, they were fake.

47
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,320
 He wasn't like some kind of Chimera who was half-baked-hoven half someone else.

48
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,920
 What was it, the dog-bate-hoven?

49
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,440
 >> It was the dog-bate-hoven.

50
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,240
 >> Yeah.

51
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:24,140
 >> There was one lock of hair which turned out to be from a woman, and

52
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:28,060
 that was the one that said, you've got terrible lead poisoning, so that's not true.

53
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:31,460
 But the thing they found, which is exciting, is that they've studied some

54
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:35,500
 modern Beethoven's, and they've studied the identical locks of hair from him.

55
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,460
 And they found that the Y chromosome is different between the two.

56
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:41,780
 And what that means is that in his family line somewhere,

57
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:44,780
 there is an extra pair paternity event.

58
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,180
 >> Okay.

59
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,940
 >> Yeah, someone's been playing a false note.

60
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:53,600
 >> Yeah. >> Yes, anyway.

61
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,680
 >> Dave Grohl of his day.

62
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,960
 >> Wow.

63
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:02,000
 Can I ask, do we know if it was head hair or hand hair?

64
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,680
 >> I don't know.

65
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,800
 >> I assume head hair.

66
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,400
 >> Yeah, I'm assuming head hair as well.

67
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,880
 >> Not everyone's hands are as pursuit as yours are, dad.

68
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,720
 >> Well, mine, I've got a bit of hair, but apparently he was like,

69
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,240
 he looked like Wolfman according to some reports I read.

70
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,040
 Yeah, and so if you were gonna see if he was musically talented,

71
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,280
 maybe it was more on that hand hair than it was the head hair.

72
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,580
 >> Cuz that's where the jeans would be.

73
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:26,100
 They would be in the fingers there, wouldn't they?

74
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:29,980
 Was it, were these the hairs that, I mean, I don't know where these ones came from,

75
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:33,220
 but I know about one person who's stashed a load of Beethoven hair.

76
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:36,660
 A musician called Ferdinand Hiller, and when you were a fanboy in the olden days,

77
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:39,100
 you snipped hair off dead people that you liked.

78
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:39,780
 >> Right, okay, yeah, right.

79
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:40,340
 >> Was that from him?

80
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:43,860
 And what I like about this is that every strand of hair was counted.

81
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:49,320
 It was 582 strands, and they were bought by a urologist.

82
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,120
 And do you remember?

83
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:55,280
 >> Yes, yeah, he's the guy with most, he gets constantly approached to

84
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,840
 get DNA analysis done on the strands of hair that he has.

85
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,960
 >> He does, but wasn't it also a urologist who collected Napoleon's penis?

86
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,680
 >> Yes, it was.

87
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,360
 >> Yes, urologist, something weird about them.

88
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,800
 >> Wow, that's interesting.

89
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,320
 >> Anyway, yeah.

90
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,200
 >> Could you, in theory, with the Beethoven hair that we have,

91
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:15,660
 could you stretch them and make a sort of very tiny piano using the hair as?

92
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:17,660
 >> I don't think so, I think they'd snap.

93
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:18,740
 >> But a tiny piano.

94
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:20,500
 >> Yeah, come on, James.

95
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,540
 No one's gonna hold you to this if you say it's possible.

96
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:26,260
 >> I just think if I say it, then that is on our next target,

97
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,460
 we're gonna go, where's my fucking piano?

98
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:30,860
 Yeah, okay, sure.

99
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:33,260
 >> Okay, you've just made him happy.

100
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,660
 >> There we go.

101
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:37,460
 Can we talk about- >> I'm kind of enjoying the whole piano.

102
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:38,980
 >> I'm sorry, yeah.

103
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,060
 >> No, no, go on, what were you gonna say?

104
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:45,840
 >> Yeah, going deaf, going deaf by the age of 30, he could not hear conversation.

105
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,000
 And that was at a period where he was composing most of his, most amazing music.

106
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,320
 And this is just, it's so interesting because one of the things he did was,

107
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,560
 we know how he communicated because he had conversation books.

108
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,560
 This is so interesting that they survive.

109
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,240
 >> So what's that?

110
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,240
 >> Well, if you're Beethoven, you carry a notebook.

111
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,200
 >> Okay. >> And if someone wants to ask you a question,

112
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,680
 they write it down in your notebook, and then you answer it.

113
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,980
 So we have a list of questions that Beethoven was asked, and

114
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,380
 we don't have any of his answers.

115
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,060
 It's exactly the wrong way around.

116
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,060
 >> No, no, no.

117
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,900
 >> And sometimes we have his shopping lists as well.

118
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,260
 That is less revealing about the mind of a genius.

119
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:24,140
 And then the thing was, he had a secretary called Anton Schindler,

120
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,300
 who became kind of the keeper of his flame.

121
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:30,020
 And he was his first biographer, and he was very, very much,

122
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,940
 he sort of wanted to keep this to himself.

123
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:35,980
 So he would answer the door wearing Beethoven's old dressing gown, pretty creepy.

124
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:39,800
 But what we also found was he had a lot of these conversation books.

125
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,300
 And if he found a blank page in one of them,

126
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,080
 he would just forge an entry himself.

127
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,560
 >> Oh, really?

128
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,120
 >> Quite frustrating for biographers.

129
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,320
 Because they've only just done handwriting analysis and worked out.

130
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,600
 Yeah, some of this is lies that were never asked.

131
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,520
 >> But I guess, yeah, he is only forging the questions.

132
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,080
 >> Yes, unless he's writing an interesting shopping list.

133
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,640
 >> Well, they might be, they can tell a lot of shopping lists.

134
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:07,340
 And actually, you can read a lot from the conversation books by what the people are asking him.

135
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,340
 Like, there's a really nice one.

136
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,860
 He was very, very close to his nephew.

137
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:13,120
 We might go on to talk about his relationship with Carl, his nephew.

138
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,160
 But he was very close to Carl, and they were in a restaurant one day.

139
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,840
 And this is in 1818, which is when he just started to do these conversation books.

140
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,720
 And we have Carl's question to him.

141
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,400
 Just because you eat sausages by taking the casing off and

142
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,360
 only eating the meat inside, it doesn't mean I have to, is he?

143
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,180
 >> And Beethoven said, that's not a question.

144
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:33,600
 >> [LAUGH]

145
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,120
 >> That's really funny.

146
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,920
 >> He did have, you compared him to Mozart, James.

147
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:41,040
 And he did have this sort of sad relationship with Mozart, or

148
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:46,460
 connection to Mozart, because Mozart very famously, child prodigy, very pushy dad.

149
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:51,840
 And Beethoven's dad really wanted Beethoven to be the next Mozart.

150
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,880
 He was called Johann, he was a court musician.

151
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,760
 So he expected that one of his kids would go into music.

152
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:00,440
 He realized Beethoven was quite good, but he used to lock him in the basement.

153
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,420
 He'd drag him out of bed in the middle of the night and

154
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:05,220
 force him to play piano over and over again.

155
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:10,340
 He beat him a lot, he was a very unpleasant person, it sounds like.

156
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:14,020
 Desperate to make him rich and famous because of being so talented.

157
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:18,020
 And also, he convinced Beethoven that he was two years younger than he was.

158
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,860
 So for years of his life,

159
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:23,740
 Beethoven thought that he was born in 1772, because his dad was so

160
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:26,140
 desperate to make him this child prodigy.

161
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,540
 >> There's a story that he did meet Beethoven as well,

162
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,800
 that he was presented to him as this.

163
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,200
 And Mozart was really pissed off that he was having to break away from

164
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,480
 his personal writing to meet this kid that everyone was saying,

165
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,640
 well, he might be really good.

166
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,400
 He sits down and he starts playing a piece by Mozart to him.

167
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,960
 And Mozart says, stop that, I want to hear what you've got.

168
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,240
 And he plays a little in original piece.

169
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,800
 And supposedly, Mozart did the old, you got it kid.

170
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,840
 And everyone was like, whoa, he's got it.

171
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:56,280
 And so that was like a seal of approval kind of thing.

172
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,980
 >> Yeah, so watch out for this guy.

173
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,180
 >> We're still in Vienna, are we?

174
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:03,100
 >> Feels like we've moved to California at some stage.

175
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,940
 >> Now, you know what Billy Joel brings someone up to play the piano and

176
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:08,820
 afterwards he's like, watch out for this guy, he's going to be making.

177
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,180
 No, you don't watch YouTube clips like that?

178
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,180
 Okay.

179
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:14,100
 >> Are you saying, do you think Mozart said that to literally everyone?

180
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,020
 Every kid who came along, he went, watch out for this kid.

181
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,020
 >> Yeah, well, this guy.

182
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:20,220
 >> So he did nine symphonies, didn't he?

183
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:25,260
 And the ninth one was the one when he was really deaf and he was conducting.

184
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:28,040
 And there was another conductor on the side because he was conducting,

185
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,200
 he couldn't hear what was happening.

186
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,440
 So he's just basically waving his arms.

187
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,880
 And all of the people in the orchestra were told to watch the other guy,

188
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,600
 basically, and then as soon as the symphony finished,

189
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:42,360
 he was carrying on conducting because he didn't realize it had finished.

190
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,960
 >> What a shame, if you just had to follow what he was doing,

191
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,240
 you would have gone an original Beethoven piece and

192
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,320
 it would have just kept going and kept going.

193
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,840
 And that would have been one of the most amazing nights of music ever.

194
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,720
 >> You say that?

195
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,680
 >> Yeah. >> One of the worst nights of live music ever

196
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:03,120
 was in 1808, Christmas in Vienna, picture the scene.

197
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,720
 It's frosty, sparkling, it's beautiful, these incredible buildings everywhere.

198
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,940
 It was the marathon performance of Beethoven's new stuff.

199
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:17,520
 And we're talking the premiere of Beethoven's fifth, premiere of the sixth.

200
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,520
 No gap, just straight on through, here's another symphony.

201
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:24,240
 Choral fantasy, another piano concerto, four hours of music.

202
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,040
 >> My God.

203
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,920
 >> Bit long.

204
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,120
 >> [LAUGH]

205
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,760
 >> It's like when Stuart Lee does back-to-back shows in one evening.

206
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:34,840
 >> It was a complete disaster on the night because all the best musicians

207
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:38,120
 in town had a rival booking, so they couldn't come and play.

208
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,200
 So the orchestra was a bit of a scratch job.

209
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:44,120
 And it was extremely cold, the critics hated it.

210
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:48,120
 One piece, they hadn't rehearsed it enough, the choir just sang it wrong, and

211
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:52,160
 he had to stop the whole gig and say, no, no, no, we need to go back to the beginning.

212
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,960
 It was just a total fiasco of it, yeah, it was a nightmare.

213
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:58,480
 >> So then he did his night symphony, and then he started his tenth.

214
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,640
 But he never completed the tenth, he died before he completed it.

215
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:06,280
 But luckily AI has completed it in 2021.

216
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:10,800
 And the piece had its world premiere in Bonn in Germany, apparently it's very good.

217
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,480
 Unfortunately, you need six fingers to play it.

218
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,120
 >> [LAUGH]

219
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,680
 >> Any good, what are the critics saying?

220
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:20,000
 >> Yeah, it's fine, sounds a bit like Beethoven.

221
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,320
 >> Fine, what a review.

222
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,080
 >> That's what you want.

223
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,600
 >> Beethoven, by the way, his name means vegetable garden.

224
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,360
 >> Cool.

225
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:31,120
 >> And his full name Ludwig van Beethoven means loud fight in the vegetable garden.

226
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,920
 >> [LAUGH]

227
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,880
 >> Which is what a lot of his music sounds like.

228
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:40,040
 No, I think he's brilliant, he just doesn't write melody.

229
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,720
 But do you know what his last words were?

230
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,960
 >> The two versions of it or something.

231
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,640
 >> So Beethoven famously died during a thunderstorm,

232
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,280
 quite cool, quite classic, Beethoven.

233
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:53,040
 And his last words were, pity, pity, too late.

234
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,240
 Because he'd just been informed that he'd received a gift from his publisher of

235
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,320
 12 bottles of wine.

236
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:01,840
 >> Which I know the saddest thing about his life.

237
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,960
 >> They won't be your last words.

238
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,480
 >> [LAUGH]

239
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,680
 >> Start opening them now.

00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,640
 >> [LAUGH]

241
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,680
 >> We're gonna go half an hour- >> Don't let them breathe.

242
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:15,840
 [MUSIC]

243
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:19,760
 >> It is time for fact number two, and that is Andy.

244
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,920
 >> My fact is that one of Scotland's most eminent 19th century illustrators

245
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,360
 was called Willie Hull.

246
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,200
 >> [LAUGH]

247
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,080
 >> Here you go.

248
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:29,720
 >> That's him there.

249
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,320
 >> And there he is, in all its glory.

250
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,800
 >> Why is that interesting, Andy?

251
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,160
 >> Why is that interesting?

252
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,960
 >> I think- >> I think he's an under-celebrated artist.

253
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,320
 >> Okay, yeah.

254
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,080
 >> You're bringing him to life today.

255
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,480
 >> Absolutely.

256
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,120
 >> I think this is the most immature fact.

257
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,800
 >> [LAUGH]

258
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,360
 >> And you know what, I thought it would be James.

259
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,800
 My money was on James for the fact that it's just a rude name.

260
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:56,760
 >> I'm sorry, I do feel a bit ashamed, but I also feel thrilled that we've talked about him.

261
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,480
 >> He was called William Hull.

262
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,440
 >> But in day-to-day life, who's got the time?

263
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,520
 >> [LAUGH]

264
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,040
 >> I'll challenge you, Anna, for a more childish fact.

265
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,120
 His dad was called Dick Hull.

266
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:07,720
 >> Yes.

267
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,040
 >> True.

268
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,000
 >> Middle name, Richard Brassy Hull.

269
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,840
 >> Yeah.

270
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:17,440
 >> And his mother was called Ann Byrne Hull.

271
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,600
 This family just had it stitched up.

272
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,400
 >> Yeah.

273
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,800
 >> How many people here, they didn't have it stitched up?

274
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,960
 >> [LAUGH]

275
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,360
 >> Sorry.

276
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,200
 >> Who here has heard of Willie Hull?

277
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,360
 And shame on you, actually.

278
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:35,520
 >> Imagine if there'd just been a roar of recognition.

279
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,520
 >> This is quite obscure.

280
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,800
 >> Well, at the time, he was very eminent.

281
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,080
 He was a member of the Royal Scottish Academy.

282
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:46,600
 He illustrated books for Robert Burns, for J.M.

283
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,200
 Barry, Robert Louis Stevenson.

284
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,520
 I know they weren't all alive at the same time, but he was alive at the time.

285
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:54,560
 So he lived from 1846 to 1917.

286
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,640
 And I just think, under celebrated.

287
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,640
 >> And don't confuse him with another Willie Hull,

288
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:02,520
 who was a person who designed all of England's coins and James the First.

289
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,120
 >> Yes.

290
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:03,640
 >> Yes.

291
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,120
 >> And he, Proto Willie Hull, he was amazing.

292
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:06,720
 >> [LAUGH]

293
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,760
 >> Because I think, was it him, James, who would have been the same time?

294
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,160
 >> He invented the colouring inbook.

295
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:13,720
 >> [LAUGH]

296
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,200
 >> Really?

297
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:14,800
 >> Yes.

298
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,640
 >> He published the series of maps.

299
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,240
 There was this poem called Poly Albion,

300
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,440
 which was about all the parts of England and Scotland.

301
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:23,960
 And it was, there was the beautiful maps of weird things.

302
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:27,960
 The rivers were all on there, and there were weird mythical beasts all over the map.

303
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:31,160
 And it was fashionable to hand colour your own maps back in the day.

304
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:31,560
 >> Wow.

305
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,680
 >> And that was a big trend in the 1620s.

306
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,440
 Gentleman's manual said, if you're going to be a proper gentleman,

307
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,560
 you've got to know how to colour in.

308
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:37,960
 >> Right.

309
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,200
 >> [LAUGH]

310
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:39,720
 >> That's amazing.

311
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,720
 >> Don't go over the lines.

312
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,640
 >> If you want an eligible lady to marry you.

313
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,200
 >> Yeah.

314
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,920
 We also shouldn't forget William J. Hull,

315
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,800
 Willie Hull Jr., the American film director,

316
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,880
 mainly known for his B movies, really amazing.

317
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,560
 He did a movie called Hellbound, which he made for producer Howard Koch.

318
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,440
 >> No.

319
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:02,920
 >> Yeah, and then he did Speed Crazy in 1959, which starred Charles Wilcox.

320
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:06,320
 >> So this is just going to be our sort of listing people with rude names, is it?

321
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,440
 >> Well, I actually looked to the Wikipedia list that's called-

322
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,200
 >> Right, okay, great.

323
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,520
 >> Other people who are called Willie.

 >> [LAUGH]

325
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,800
 >> Yeah, there's over 218 notable Willys out there.

326
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:19,400
 You've got the professional golfer in America called Willie Tucker.

327
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,560
 >> Lovely.

328
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,160
 >> There's- >> [LAUGH]

329
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,560
 >> And does that help in golf?

330
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,480
 James, you play golf.

331
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,840
 >> It can get in the way of your swings.

332
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,560
 >> Yeah, yeah.

00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,280
 >> [LAUGH]

342
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,360
 >> The history of illustration, no.

343
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,760
 >> Yeah, I've got some quite dry stuff on the difference between a wood block and

344
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,960
 a wood cutting.

345
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,680
 >> That's what we want.

346
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:52,160
 >> But- >> But no, this one, so William Hall was at

347
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,760
 the tail end of a period where basically illustration was the only means of getting

348
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,760
 any visual information to anyone else, as in-

349
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,960
 >> There was no YouTube, no TikTok.

350
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,520
 >> There was no TikTok.

351
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:06,080
 That was in the 1870s after his period, no.

352
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:10,360
 And basically, it was hugely important and usually legally contentious as well.

353
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,000
 >> Oh, really?

354
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,240
 >> So yeah, I was reading about James Gilray,

355
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,080
 who was the sort of the most famous artist of the early 19th century.

356
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,200
 >> Right. >> Who did caricatures.

357
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:21,040
 But they were so offensive and insulting that he was charged with blasphemy.

358
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,600
 >> Wow.

359
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,600
 >> That was, he drew the wise men and he was charged with blasphemy.

360
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,240
 Actually, the real reason was that the Prince of Wales was clearly in the picture.

361
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,080
 Being, you know- >> As one of the wise men or

362
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,680
 just like popping up behind, like he's photo bombed.

363
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,240
 >> There was a disgusting baby in there and there was all sorts of-

364
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,080
 >> Jesus.

365
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:40,280
 >> So I mean, sorry, in the drawing, in the drawing.

366
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,040
 >> Sorry about being arrested for blasphemy.

367
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:46,240
 >> Sorry, in the satirical drawing.

368
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,400
 I'm not afraid of blasphemy charges, am I?

369
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,720
 >> Yeah.

370
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,680
 >> But basically, and you know, he was interviewed by George Canning.

371
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:57,200
 He was later the prime minister saying, look, I want a caricature of me.

372
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,320
 And so the charge against him, the blasphemy charge was dropped and

373
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,080
 he was given a government pension.

374
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:06,800
 Gilray is the man who was responsible for everyone thinking that Napoleon was short.

375
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,400
 >> Oh, really?

376
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,280
 >> He was short.

377
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,920
 Napoleon was normal height.

378
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,000
 It's entirely thanks to someone drawing him 200 years ago,

379
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,760
 that we think Napoleon Bonaparte was short.

380
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,480
 >> That's so interesting.

381
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:19,120
 >> So that's the power these images had, just repeated and amplified and caricatured.

382
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,400
 >> Yeah. >> Wouldn't influence.

383
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,680
 >> So Willy Hall, he did caricatures of quite famous people, right?

384
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,680
 Like he did, I think, Jay and Barry and a few people like that.

385
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:30,680
 >> I think he mostly did work, as in he mostly would, Jay and Barry's books,

386
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,440
 he would illustrate those.

387
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,120
 >> So not the author's illustrations, right?

388
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:33,720
 >> I don't think so.

389
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:38,160
 He illustrated Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde for Robert Louis Stevenson, and kidnapped.

390
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,240
 I read that Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde was written in six days and

391
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,440
 six nights while Louis Stevenson was on a cocaine bender.

392
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,440
 >> Yeah.

393
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:52,840
 >> And according to Robert Louis Stevenson.com, that's a myth.

394
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,400
 >> No, well, they would say that, wouldn't they?

395
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,240
 >> Yeah, he feels like it.

396
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,400
 They said that he was on medication.

397
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:03,280
 >> Yeah, but there's no evidence that he took cocaine for recreational purposes.

398
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:07,480
 >> Willy Hall's grandmother, or great-grandmother, was Jamaican.

399
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:10,120
 >> Okay. >> Just very, just unusual to have

400
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:12,920
 a mixed-race couple in the 1790s.

401
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:16,520
 But his Scottish father married a Jamaican woman in the 1790s.

402
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:21,560
 And the resulting child went on to be the first student of African descent at

403
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:25,120
 the University of Edinburgh, and then governor of Sierra Leone.

404
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,600
 And that's Willy Hall, that's my Willy Hall fact.

405
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,160
 >> It's good.

406
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,800
 >> It's not about, it's not about a funny name.

407
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,040
 >> But we're all learning.

408
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:34,000
 >> But we're all learning something.

409
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,440
 >> Can I tell you maybe my favorite artist of the period?

410
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,880
 So George Cruikshank, right?

411
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:44,920
 Again, hugely influential caricaturist, satirist, drew outrageous things.

412
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:48,240
 He once got a bribe of 100 quid from the king himself,

413
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,840
 saying please do not caricature his majesty in any immoral situation.

414
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,800
 So that's how powerful he was at the time.

415
00:17:55,800 --> 00:18:00,880
 Imagine if the current king paid, I don't know, Michael McIntyre not to do any jokes about him.

416
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,640
 >> Is Michael McIntyre known as the most hardcore political satirist of our day?

417
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,840
 >> [LAUGH]

418
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,480
 >> Okay, Anton Deck, fine, whatever.

419
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,000
 >> [LAUGH]

420
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,760
 >> But he was a dreadful guy, Cruikshank, in his personal life.

421
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,800
 So he ill-treated his wife quite badly.

422
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,480
 He was an avowed anti-drink campaigner, right?

423
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:24,120
 So he looked strict, strict, strict, because his father had died of alcohol poisoning.

424
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:28,280
 He'd just won a drinking contest and then died his father.

425
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,280
 >> All right.

426
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,320
 >> Died happy, though, at least.

427
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,640
 >> It's like the second worst result possible.

428
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:35,240
 >> That feels like a disqualification after the match, right?

429
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:38,360
 That feels like you gotta live at least a month, post.

430
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:42,960
 >> Yeah, but okay, here's the amazing thing about George Cruikshank, right?

431
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,200
 He was on his deathbed.

432
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,040
 >> Yeah. >> And he was talking to his wife,

433
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,960
 who he hadn't been terribly nice to.

434
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,160
 And he said, what will become of my children?

435
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,400
 And his wife said, what do you mean your children?

436
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,120
 >> We haven't got any children.

437
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,680
 Now he had been married once before.

438
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,680
 >> Uh-huh.

439
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,760
 >> That marriage hadn't produced any children either.

440
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,200
 >> Well, it turned out, this is spicy gossip time.

441
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,120
 >> [LAUGH]

442
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,840
 >> It turned out he had been leading a secret double life.

443
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,560
 And he had mistress with whom he had had 11 children.

444
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,560
 >> Whoa.

445
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,880
 >> [LAUGH]

446
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:19,280
 >> The last of whom was conceived when he was 82 years old.

447
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,400
 >> [LAUGH]

448
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,480
 >> Can you imagine?

449
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,720
 >> Yeah. >> I'm just popping out, whatever.

450
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,720
 >> It's so funny, his obituary said,

451
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,040
 there never was a purer, simpler, more blameless man.

452
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,520
 Something childlike in his transparency a week later,

453
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,880
 the will was read out to which he left all of his money to his.

454
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,680
 >> My gosh.

455
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,680
 >> That's amazing.

456
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:39,800
 >> You know, there's only one image of Shakespeare that we have.

457
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,600
 >> Okay, yeah, yeah.

458
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,960
 >> It's done by an engraver called Martin Droshoot.

459
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,200
 He was a Flemish.

460
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,960
 And it's kind of, you'll see it.

461
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,720
 Like, if you ever see a picture on an old book of Shakespeare,

462
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,240
 it's the one that you see, which is like black and white.

463
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,120
 >> Yeah, he's bold, he's got a pair on sides, yeah.

464
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:59,600
 >> Now, it turns out that Martin Droshoot was a terrible, terrible drawer.

465
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,360
 Like, he was really, really bad.

466
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:06,440
 And we only have one other portrait that he did, Francisco de la Pena.

467
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:09,400
 And it looks almost identical to the one he did of Shakespeare.

468
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,360
 >> Yeah.

469
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:13,080
 >> And it seems like he only really knew how to draw one person.

470
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:18,720
 >> My God, so we don't know how likely it is that this actually looked like Shakespeare at all.

471
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,560
 >> Yeah, he actually had a Mahecan, according to sort of the time.

472
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,600
 Did you know, speaking of the influence that illustrators have,

473
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,720
 it was an illustrator who invented macaroni.

474
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,560
 Or who popularized macaroni.

475
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,440
 >> Okay, the pasta?

476
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,760
 Or the penguin?

477
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,280
 >> No, if you're being pedantic, neither, the pasta, nor the penguins.

478
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,720
 >> It was like a look, wasn't it?

479
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,720
 >> A dandy, yeah.

480
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,720
 >> A dandy, yes.

481
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:46,840
 This, so a macaroni in England in the 1770s and '80s was,

482
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,280
 there was a fashion for men to be really effeminate.

483
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,080
 They had, like, huge hair.

484
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:54,720
 They particularly had massive hair, and then they wore a tiny hat on top.

485
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,720
 Which is so cool.

486
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:02,280
 And sort of striped stockings and really tight pants and fancy walking sticks, bright colors.

487
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:05,040
 Anyway, there's a woman called Mary Dali.

488
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:08,440
 In fact, it was a husband and wife team, Matthew and Mary Dali.

489
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,000
 And Mary was the real caricature.

490
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,200
 She sort of made caricaturing a thing, invented the art of caricaturing,

491
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,160
 like exaggerating these effects.

492
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:21,000
 And they made their name by having the macaroni print shop on the strand,

493
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,560
 where she basically drew caricatures of all these effeminate men,

494
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,480
 created, popularized the macaroni.

495
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,080
 >> Yeah.

496
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,960
 >> You spoke about dandies before.

497
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:34,200
 Of course, the dandy is a Scottish illustration of sorts.

498
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,480
 >> Okay. >> What a great link.

499
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,080
 >> Thank you.

500
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,480
 >> Just leapfrogging from the 1760s to the 20th century comic book.

501
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,440
 >> That was very impressive.

502
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,640
 >> Made by DC Thompson.

503
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,600
 And DC Thompson is also home to the world's oldest magazine,

504
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,400
 the Scots magazine.

505
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:51,400
 And in one of the early issues, they had a first-hand account of the Battle

506
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:51,960
 of Culloden.

507
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,520
 >> Really?

508
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,360
 >> That's how old that is.

509
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,160
 >> Wait, sorry, that wasn't the first issue of the dandy.

510
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,200
 >> No. >> No, sorry.

511
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,760
 >> Sorry.

512
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,040
 >> That was in DC Thompson.

513
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,840
 >> Because it's desperate down, I've been on site.

514
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,840
 It could have gone the other way.

515
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:06,880
 >> Yeah.

516
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,320
 What was, can I, sorry to be ignorant, but what was the Battle of Culloga?

517
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,320
 >> That is.

518
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,440
 >> Why don't you just ask someone in the street later on?

519
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,160
 >> Okay.

520
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,160
 I don't know what's known here.

521
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,880
 You don't know who Willie Hole is, but you know that battle that's going on.

522
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,240
 >> I'll tell you, I will tell you later, and I will tell you at some length.

523
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,960
 But it's really interesting.

524
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,120
 >> But on the subject of comics and DC Thompson stuff,

525
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:33,520
 I thought we could have a quick game of comic strip or darts nickname.

526
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,920
 >> Oh, okay.

527
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,880
 >> Because I realized that some of these comic strips have kind of got similar

528
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,200
 names to the darts players.

529
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,040
 >> Oh, like Calamity James.

530
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,480
 >> Is a darts player?

531
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,240
 No.

532
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:49,400
 >> So for instance, Bow and Arrow, B-E-A-U and Arrow.

533
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,920
 Is that the name of a comic or is it the name of a darts player's nickname?

534
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:56,000
 >> It must be darts player because what is a dart but a tiny arrow.

535
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,640
 >> Well, it's got to be a comic book, otherwise you wouldn't have presented it

536
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,360
 and tried to trick us into thinking it was a darts.

537
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,520
 >> Do you get tag teams in darts?

538
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:06,200
 >> You can't have doubles, but it's true.

539
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:10,880
 >> You chuck it halfway along the distance and they lean over and hammer it at home.

540
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:18,520
 >> Yeah, no, you lift your arm up and Bow pulls it back and releases you.

541
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:22,560
 >> The answer is it was a double bluff and it's Bow Graves who's the current

542
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:25,440
 back-to-back two-time ladies world champion.

543
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,440
 >> Okay.

544
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,440
 >> It's a darts player.

545
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,440
 Dirty Dick.

546
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,440
 >> Oh.

547
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,440
 >> Darts player or comic book.

548
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,440
 >> I feel it seemed to be a comic.

549
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,720
 I'm going to say darts player.

550
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,720
 >> Yeah.

551
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,720
 >> Dirty Dick.

552
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,720
 >> Comic.

553
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,720
 >> Yeah, comic.

554
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:42,400
 >> It was a character from the dandy known as a boy who generally is in need of a good

555
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,400
 scrub.

556
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,000
 >> What about this one?

557
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 Master Bates.

558
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:53,160
 >> I always thought that Master Bates was the myth from Pugwash that claimed that it

559
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,160
 was --

560
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,520
 >> And it was never actually a Master Bates.

561
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,320
 >> Yeah, so you go for darts player?

562
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,320
 >> Yeah.

563
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,440
 >> Well, the truth is technically it's both.

564
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,400
 Because there was a character in Oliver Twist called Bates who's sometimes called Master

565
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,400
 Bates.

566
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,960
 And there is quite a few etchings of Master Bates.

567
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:13,840
 But also it was the nickname of darts player Owen Bates.

568
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,840
 He's known as the master.

569
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:19,760
 >> He always has one hand in his pocket when he's playing.

570
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,360
 >> He always has it on his back.

571
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,160
 It says Owen the Master Bates.

572
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:26,840
 But when he qualified for the world championships they didn't allow him to use it.

573
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,840
 >> That's fair enough.

574
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:32,320
 >> You don't want to bring the noble sport of darts into disrepute.

575
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:40,440
 >> It is time for fact number three.

576
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,240
 And that is my fact.

577
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:49,240
 My fact this week is that the title "Prince of Thinkers" was awarded in France to a philosopher

578
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:55,400
 whose greatest published work claimed humans were descended from frogs.

579
00:24:55,400 --> 00:25:02,280
 I'm sure you've all, like Willie Hull, have heard of Jean-Pierre Bresset.

580
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:05,200
 This is a guy who was a philosopher.

581
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,200
 He was a writer.

582
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,200
 He was a thinker.

583
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,200
 He was a bit of an outsider.

584
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:13,000
 He lived basically in the same bracket as Willie Hull, by the way, year-wise.

585
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 >> Time-wise.

586
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,840
 >> Yeah, Willie Hull was born 1846, died 1917.

587
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,400
 Jean-Pierre was 1837 to 1919.

588
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,960
 >> Did they ever meet, do we know?

589
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,080
 >> Oh, good question.

590
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,080
 >> No, they obviously didn't.

591
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,880
 >> Yeah, they didn't.

592
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,680
 He was a fascinating guy.

593
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:35,200
 The first thing that he wrote was a thing called "Learning the Art of Swimming Alone

594
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,440
 in Less Than an Hour."

595
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,440
 >> That's fantastic.

596
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,200
 >> Yeah, it's amazing.

597
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:44,800
 It's basically five illustrations that show you how in the confines of your home, so it's

598
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:50,760
 not even within the water, you can just practice moves hundreds and hundreds of times so that

599
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:54,520
 when you eventually jump into the water for the first time, you know, how to swim.

600
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:58,440
 >> If you do it 600 times, basically you know, and then that's it.

601
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:03,300
 It might be that humans are descended from frog's theory, which we should say now is

602
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:11,760
 not true, from, well, hang on, has not yet been proven, but because if you view a swimmer

603
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:15,520
 from above and they're doing something like breaststroke, they look a bit like a frog,

604
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:19,400
 and so that might have linked frogs and humans together in his mind.

605
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,400
 >> Really?

606
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,480
 >> Yeah, we should say he wasn't an actual proper philosopher.

607
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:29,840
 He was a nobody, but it's quite amazing how famous he sort of became to a niche bunch

608
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,840
 of people.

609
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:36,560
 So the only reason he became famous was because there was a prank organized by a bunch of

610
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:43,680
 kind of the literati artist led by a guy called Jules Romain who decided to award this Prince

611
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,160
 of Thinker's thing.

612
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,720
 Jules Romain had come across his book.

613
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,480
 I think he'd just been rifling through a library, hadn't he?

614
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,480
 >> Yeah.

615
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,400
 >> So it was like humans are descended from frogs, and the logic was so mad.

616
00:26:54,400 --> 00:27:00,360
 So he believed that any words in a language that sounded like other words, that wasn't

617
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:03,920
 a coincidence, that told you something very important.

618
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:09,480
 So for instance, the word "ren" for queen sounds like the old French word "ren" for

619
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,480
 frog.

620
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,440
 So he was like, okay, frogs must be really important.

621
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:19,280
 He was then walking past a pond when he noticed not only do frogs look a lot like humans in

622
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,280
 their bodies.

623
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,280
 So he thought.

624
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:26,080
 But they also were saying "go up, go up," which is French, of course, for "what?"

625
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,080
 "What?"

626
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,080
 >> What?

627
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,080
 That's so good.

628
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:33,960
 >> And the idea being that when frogs finally got self-conscious and understood that they

629
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:37,680
 were part of the world, the first thing that they would say is, "What?"

630
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,600
 >> There you go.

631
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,600
 There you go.

632
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,520
 It's all very interesting.

633
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:48,840
 We should just quickly go back a second on the Prince of Thinker's thing here, because

634
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,760
 it's quite a mean thing that happened.

635
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:55,760
 He was told that this big vote had happened and that he was being made the Prince of

636
00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:00,240
 Thinkers, and they brought him into Paris on a train, and he was met at the station by

637
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:05,200
 a group of people, and he was given flowers by children, and some poet had written a very

638
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,480
 special piece specifically for him.

639
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:11,600
 >> He was asked to make a speech in front of the Rodin statue, "The Thinker," of his

640
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,520
 kind of acceptance speech.

641
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,840
 It's unbelievably unkind in hindsight.

642
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:22,560
 Imagine if the most eminent authors in the world invited you, Dan, saying, "We have

643
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:28,840
 Richard Osmond saying it, Dan Brown's in there, McEwan, Ishiguro, all of the biggies."

644
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:32,480
 They write to you, Dan, and they say, "We actually think your book is going to change

645
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,480
 the world.

646
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,480
 It's seminal.

647
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,280
 Please come to the British Library and stand in front of the statue of Isaac Newton and

648
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:40,840
 make a speech," and then it turns out it was a prank, and they actually think the book

649
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:41,840
 is rubbish.

650
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,720
 That's basically what happened to this guy.

651
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,720
 It is cruel.

652
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,720
 I think that would be cruel.

653
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:49,760
 I don't see any evidence that he ever knew, and I think they might have felt a bit bad.

654
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,760
 So Jules Romain ...

655
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,760
 >> Shit.

656
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,760
 It's incredible.

657
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,020
 >> It wasn't the newspapers the next day.

658
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,020
 >> It was too successful.

659
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,020
 It went too well.

660
00:28:57,020 --> 00:29:01,800
 So I think Jules Romain left money for a banquet to be held in his name every year thereafter,

661
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:06,680
 and it did go until 1939, possibly because he felt a bit bad about humiliating this guy.

662
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:10,360
 >> To be honest, reading up on it, I'm a bit confused about what they genuinely thought,

663
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:14,080
 because if you read Marcel Duchamp writes about it, and he knew of the work of Brisee

664
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:18,880
 as well, I think they were taking the piss, and it was elaborate, but they were surrealists,

665
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,880
 and they were doing a surreal thing here, but I think they admired the thinking.

666
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,920
 I think they genuinely thought, "This guy is a weird thinker, and we should be celebrating."

667
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:29,120
 >> They were doing all sorts of stuff like that, weren't they?

668
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,840
 It was like, "Found art," kind of thing.

669
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,440
 It's like, "We found this thing.

670
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,000
 We're going to turn it into art.

671
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,640
 We're going to turn it into something special."

672
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,640
 >> Yeah.

673
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,000
 I think Richard Osman really liked my book, actually.

674
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:46,520
 But there were quite a lot of these, what are known in English as "outside of writers,"

675
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:51,960
 and in French as "fou littoré," like means "mad writers," but there were quite a lot

676
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,280
 of them at the time.

677
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:59,840
 For instance, there was a guy called Alexis Vincent Charles Berbaguier, Newfoundland Time,

678
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,520
 who wrote books about the imps that were following him around.

679
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:08,800
 His surname, Time, was chosen because he thought that the time the herb repelled the

680
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:15,520
 imps, and he planned to plant an enormous time field so that it would repel all of the

681
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,040
 imps.

682
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:20,040
 So that was one of them.

683
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:23,520
 >> I did read about him, because he read that the imps and the leprechauns that followed

684
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:27,720
 him around made him sneeze and fart enormously, and that was a huge problem.

685
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,720
 >> No, it's not me.

686
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,720
 It was the imps.

687
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:32,720
 He wants to buy himself a dog.

688
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:37,520
 There was a guy called Raymond Russell, who wrote these really long poems, but instead

689
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:42,320
 of rhyming, each line was kind of related to the previous one by the words, so you might

690
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:46,320
 have a line which is about a dog, and the next one's about a bog, and the next one's

691
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,400
 about a bot, and like that, but they're really, really, really long.

692
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:54,560
 It would have footnotes explaining what he'd done to make that line that was related to

693
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:59,320
 the previous line, and his footnotes could have footnotes, and that could go like five

694
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:02,720
 footnotes deep for all of it, so it was all footnotes.

695
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,400
 >> The David Foster Wallace of his time, and equally tedious.

696
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:10,440
 Well, according to the French Wikipedia, perhaps not surprisingly, Roussel was unpopular during

697
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:15,120
 his life, and critical reception of his works was almost unanimously negative.

698
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,120
 >> Oh, man.

699
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,120
 >> Yeah.

700
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,120
 Well, there was loads of them around.

701
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:21,200
 I think it was just like, pretty much anyone could get stuff printed.

702
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,200
 >> Yeah.

703
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,200
 >> That's great.

704
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,200
 >> But I feel like a lot of them were self-conscious.

705
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,080
 >> They were often rich white men.

706
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,720
 >> Yeah, yeah, and they knew what they were doing, whereas this guy didn't.

707
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:35,200
 I found something quite random about Brisset, which is that, so he was in the army, and I

708
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,800
 think something quite odd about him, and this is often surprising today, about people who

709
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:43,360
 hold very strange beliefs, Dan, you know a lot of these people.

710
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:49,520
 They function very normally in the rest of their life, and so he, as we've said, he

711
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,800
 worked on the railways.

712
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:54,000
 They did try to sack him a few times from the railways, because he did have some quite

713
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,440
 strange ideas that they attributed to a head wound, from being in the army.

714
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,440
 >> What?

715
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,440
 Yeah, what were the ideas?

716
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,480
 >> Well, there were a lot of the stuff we've just talked about, how all humans are descended

717
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,480
 from frogs, that kind of thing.

718
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,480
 >> Oh, not trains specifically.

719
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,920
 >> Yeah, it made it sound like he was saying the trains should all run backwards.

720
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,840
 >> No, sorry, he made the trains run fine, he just kept on wanging on about this whole

721
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:13,280
 humans from frogs idea.

722
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:18,160
 But he was wounded in 1859 at the Battle of Magenta, which was a battle of France and

723
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,160
 Italy versus Austria.

724
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:24,440
 It was a huge success and victory for the French, and I just didn't know that that's

725
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,440
 where the colour comes from.

726
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,440
 >> From the battle?

727
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,440
 >> Yeah.

728
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,440
 >> Really?

729
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:31,160
 >> Yeah, so it was this big success, the Battle of Magenta, for the French, and at the same

730
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:36,000
 time, French chemists produced the colour that they called Fushina, and then they were

731
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,640
 like, hang on, we've just had this big victory, do you mind if we rename that magenta?

732
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,880
 >> What colour is magenta again?

733
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,880
 >> What colour?

734
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:45,120
 >> The one in the printer that always runs out, even though you never use it.

735
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,120
 >> Thank you.

736
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,840
 Hello, old friend.

737
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,840
 Okay.

738
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:51,480
 Language, how we got language in the first place?

739
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,480
 >> Oh yeah.

740
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,480
 >> The theory, because the 19th century was a time when lots of people were trying to

741
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,480
 work out.

742
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,480
 How did we get language?

743
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,480
 And the theories were fantastic.

744
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:03,360
 >> Because we just had the theory of evolution, had come in with Darwin, and people thought,

745
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:06,800
 well, surely language must have evolved in the same way, so can we fill in some of the

746
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,800
 gaps?

747
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,800
 >> Yeah, exactly.

748
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,800
 So the Bow Wow theory.

749
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,800
 Language.

750
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,800
 >> We came from dogs.

751
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,800
 >> We came from dogs?

752
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:16,120
 No, it's the language comes from animal sounds, and the humans started language off by doing

753
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,120
 impressions of animals.

754
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,120
 >> Really?

755
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,640
 >> To communicate with each other.

756
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:23,920
 So for example, James, I've got, if we don't have language, I've got no way of saying there's

757
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:27,200
 a dog behind you, unless I say woof, right?

758
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,200
 >> Sure.

759
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:32,960
 >> But how do you say it to someone in another country that doesn't know the word woof?

760
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,640
 Because in English, we say woof, but dogs don't objectively say woof, and they don't

761
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,120
 say Bow Wow, and in all different countries, they say different things.

762
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,560
 >> Yeah, but I'd go, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, and if you would know there was a dog behind

763
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,560
 you, we're in the same room.

764
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,800
 It's just 30,000 years ago, Wendy Anderfields.

765
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:46,800
 >> Wendy Anderfields.

766
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,800
 >> Yeah.

767
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:51,600
 And the guy who came up with this was a guy called, I love this, Johann Herder.

768
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,600
 >> Oh yeah.

769
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,600
 >> Okay.

770
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,600
 >> What do dogs do?

771
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,720
 >> Has he worked out what he thinks the words have evolved into?

772
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,040
 What does that, wow, wow, wow, what does that become?

773
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:03,680
 >> I don't know enough of what, this is the late 18th century, so I haven't read enough

774
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,680
 of his stuff.

775
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:08,440
 I think it was that you start off with rah, rah, rah, rah, and then eventually you get

776
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,440
 to woof.

777
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,440
 >> Hang on.

778
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:15,200
 >> And then, like, a few more steps, a few more steps, I'm not going to spell out, and

779
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,920
 then we've got this podcast.

780
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:21,000
 >> Do you know what dogs say in Burma, just while we're on this subject?

781
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 >> Dogs say in Burma.

782
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,840
 >> They say, woke, woke, woke, woke, like a GB news presenter.

783
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:31,800
 >> Because I pissed off everyone's calling it Mayanmar, aren't they?

784
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,800
 Listen, Andy.

785
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:37,080
 >> That's the best Burma-Mayanmar joke you'll hear on this day for weeks.

786
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,720
 >> How much do we believe in?

787
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,480
 Because I believe this theory 100% right now.

788
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:44,480
 This sounds like the most sensible thing I've ever heard on this podcast.

789
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,460
 It's the first thing that kids do, like you're speaking to your kid, you teach them the noises

790
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,460
 that animals make.

791
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:49,960
 Of course language came from there.

792
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:52,240
 But what about the yo-he-ho theory?

793
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:53,240
 >> What's the yo-he-ho?

794
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,240
 >> Hang on.

795
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,240
 This sounds better.

796
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,240
 >> We all evolve from pirates?

797
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,240
 >> Basically.

798
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,840
 >> Basically, yeah.

799
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:03,720
 This is Edward Burnett Tyler in 1871, proposed that language evolve when you're doing manual

800
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,080
 labor together.

801
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,280
 You might be rowing.

802
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,880
 You might be hauling logs.

803
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:14,080
 And you have to say, row, row, or yo-he-ho, or whatever, and that gradually evolves into

804
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,280
 more complicated structures.

805
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:19,640
 But it's basically you need some kind of shared sound that we all make when we're pulling

806
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:20,640
 a log, or whatever.

807
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,640
 >> I like that.

808
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,640
 >> There's also the poo-poo theory.

809
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,640
 >> Oh, what's the poo-poo theory?

810
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:30,040
 >> The poo-poo theory is that it comes from automatic responses from disgust or happiness

811
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,040
 or something.

812
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,200
 So you see something and you go, poo.

813
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,400
 You just make that automatically.

814
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,400
 It's not a word.

815
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,040
 And then eventually words evolve from that.

816
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,680
 >> I think it's the woof-woof thing.

817
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:39,680
 >> Do you?

818
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:46,360
 >> There's a very famous philosopher and linguist called Ferdinand de Saussur, who you've all

819
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:50,400
 heard of, as had I before I started researching for this, of course.

820
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,320
 But he's one of the founders of linguistics, apparently.

821
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:56,200
 Anyway, so he's very well respected.

822
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,200
 He died in 1913.

823
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:02,960
 Sometime after he died, eight cardboard boxes were found that belonged to him that showed

824
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:07,760
 he was obsessed with the idea that all of classical literature had hidden anagrams within

825
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,760
 it.

826
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,920
 And people still talk about this.

827
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:15,680
 People still kind of write papers about what this means and whether it's justifiable.

828
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:20,680
 But he just got obsessed with the idea there are all these weird anagrams and phony matching

829
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,880
 and patterns in classical literature.

830
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,880
 >> That's really interesting.

831
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:24,880
 >> It's so weird.

832
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:25,880
 >> It's so weird about finding the patterns.

833
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:30,840
 It's the same with Brisset, I guess, because he said, okay, we've all evolved from frogs

834
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:36,000
 and these frogs saying qua, and then that goes into what in French?

835
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,240
 But he kind of assumes that French is the original language, right?

836
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,240
 >> Yeah.

837
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,240
 >> That's the big problem with this theory.

838
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,240
 >> Well, he says, yeah.

839
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,240
 >> But what's the nickname for the French?

840
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,240
 Frogs.

841
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,240
 >> Oh.

842
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,160
 >> I'm just saying.

843
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,160
 >> Holy shit.

844
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,160
 >> Maybe there's something.

845
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,160
 Have I just blown this shit wide open?

846
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:59,200
 >> You've blown this shit wide open.

847
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,100
 >> We need to move on to our final fact of the show, all right?

848
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:06,520
 It is time for our final fact of the show, and that is Anna.

849
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:13,240
 My fact this week is that in 1968, a pig was nominated as a US presidential candidate,

850
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:17,760
 but was arrested in the middle of his acceptance speech.

851
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,840
 >> When we're saying his acceptance speech.

852
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:23,440
 >> They're very eloquent pigs, if you would just listen.

853
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,440
 >> Yeah.

854
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,440
 >> Yeah.

855
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,440
 >> Don't say, oh, yeah, he made sense to me.

856
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:34,120
 Honestly, I was thinking of the pig from Babe, and I was like, he was eloquent.

857
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,120
 >> It wasn't that pig.

858
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,120
 >> It was a different pig.

859
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:43,120
 This is a pig called Pegasus, and he was a presidential candidate of the yippies, which

860
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:49,760
 were a political party slash incoate group of late 1960s sort of activist dissenters

861
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:55,800
 who sort of didn't like the war in Vietnam, as no one did, and they made a big fuss about

862
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,800
 it.

863
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:00,520
 And one of the big fusses they made was this was two days before the big Democrat conference,

864
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:04,920
 National Convention, and they showed up, they called a press conference, and they rocked

865
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:10,240
 up with this pig candidate, and one of their leaders, Jerry Rubin, started to do the acceptance

866
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:15,720
 speech on the pig's behalf, because the pig was very shy, and interrupted halfway through

867
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:20,520
 by the police, who genuinely arrested all the candidates, including the pig, and took

868
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,520
 them away.

869
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:25,120
 >> I read a rumour that he was subsequently eaten by one of the police officers.

870
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,840
 >> Yeah, I heard that as well.

871
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,000
 >> That's a rumour.

872
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,520
 I don't think it is, and the reason I don't think it is, is that it's quite difficult

873
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:38,040
 to just go from a live pig in your possession to it being on your dining room table, isn't

874
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,040
 it?

875
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,040
 >> You've got to have a kit, haven't you?

876
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,040
 >> You've got to have a gear.

877
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:45,000
 >> Yeah, actually, I read a different rumour that he was married off and taken to a farm

878
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,040
 to live with Mrs. Pegasus, which is a nicer...

879
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,040
 >> Oh, that's a nice one.

880
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,400
 >> Yeah, and I think that's plausible as well.

881
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,240
 >> Probably somewhere in between is the truth.

882
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:56,280
 >> Probably rehoused and then eventually eaten.

883
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,280
 >> Yeah.

884
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,280
 >> There we go.

885
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:04,640
 >> I read a further rumour that months, like five months after this incident, the Yippies

886
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:09,800
 held an honorary, what they called, "Inhoguration" for Pegasus.

887
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,800
 >> Lovely.

888
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,560
 >> Yeah, it's all great stuff.

889
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,560
 >> It's good stuff.

890
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:18,280
 I think they were fun, protesters had quite a lot of fun in the '60s, as well as being

891
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,280
 very angry.

892
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,280
 >> Well, this is Flower Power.

893
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:24,360
 If you want to put a name that's connected to it, Abby Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, they were

894
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:30,640
 all part of this big moment of saying anti-war and peace is needed, but they were pranksters

895
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:35,600
 and they were also pulling stunts like this to sort of get themselves in enough trouble

896
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:39,760
 that they made a statement, but nothing, you know, bringing a pig to a nomination is not

897
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,760
 really dangerous.

898
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:41,760
 >> Yeah, it wasn't even in the building.

899
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,080
 It was sort of easy.

900
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:49,640
 They were nicknamed the Groucho Marxists, but the Yippies, as they got called, it stood

901
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:54,640
 for the Youth International Party, but actually they were named, because one of their founders,

902
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:59,440
 a guy called Krasna, was going through the alphabet for words that rhymed with hippie,

903
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:03,520
 and eventually got to, like, almost the last gasp, we got to Yippie, and they thought,

904
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:06,920
 "Oh, yeah, we could make that stand for Youth International Party if we, you know, mangled

905
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:07,920
 it a bit."

906
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:08,920
 >> Yeah.

907
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:09,920
 >> And so, they didn't get the name first and then come up with the acronym.

908
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,120
 They came up with the acronym first and then back-formed it.

909
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,120
 >> Yeah.

910
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:16,560
 >> And they did take it seriously as well as being pranksters, like the whole pig thing,

911
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,520
 there was a big argument about it.

912
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:22,680
 So I guess the three main people were Abby and Anita Hoffman, who were a couple, and

913
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,180
 Jerry Rubin.

914
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:30,880
 And Abby and Anita Hoffman bought the first pig for this big press conference and presented

915
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,880
 it to Jerry Rubin, who rejected the pig out of hand, was furious, said, "This is too small.

916
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,040
 It's too attractive.

917
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,040
 We need a big pig.

918
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,540
 We need an ugly pig."

919
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:39,540
 And he had to himself.

920
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:40,540
 >> Why not?

921
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:41,760
 I've seen another picture here.

922
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,760
 He's not that.

923
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,760
 I've seen bigger pigs.

924
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,760
 >> I've seen bigger pigs.

925
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,760
 >> I agree.

926
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:51,280
 It's an attractive pig to my eyes, but it was supposed to represent sort of political power

927
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:54,280
 of the day, I suppose, and that's ugly.

928
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,640
 That's the satire there.

929
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:59,840
 >> The other thing they did very famously was walk to the Pentagon and try and levitate

930
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:00,840
 it.

931
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:01,840
 >> Yeah.

932
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,840
 That's right.

933
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,840
 >> It's really interesting.

934
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:08,620
 When you speak to people who were on this march, and there was a lot of them, most of

935
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:12,480
 them say, "Yeah, we were just going for a long, for the fun, and we weren't really going

936
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,840
 to levitate it."

937
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:18,400
 And then some of them, admittedly, who were kind of off their tits on LSD, they actually

938
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,800
 thought they were going to levitate it.

939
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,600
 I genuinely think some of them thought they were.

940
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:25,520
 >> Yeah, they thought they were going to send psychic energy towards it until the building

941
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:30,080
 itself turned orange with the energy and vibration, and then it would slowly levitate, and they

942
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:34,080
 were going to do it by psychic energy, Tibetan chants, and as you say, they knew it was a

943
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:37,680
 joke, but then there were people that thought, "Well, if enough of us did it, maybe this

944
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,200
 would actually work."

945
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:43,080
 And it was, you know, I mean, the names that keep cropping up, if you know your counterculture

946
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,080
 America well.

947
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,080
 >> Wait, what happened?

948
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,080
 Sorry.

949
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,080
 >> Oh, yeah, so it lifted up.

950
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,080
 It turned orange.

951
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,080
 >> It's still there.

952
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,080
 It's still in the air now.

953
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,080
 >> It's a nightmare.

954
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,080
 You've got to get in by ladder.

955
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,080
 It's insane.

956
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,080
 Nothing happened, Andy.

957
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,080
 It didn't work.

958
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,080
 Sorry.

959
00:41:56,080 --> 00:42:01,400
 >> Well, Alan Ginsberg, who's one of these counterculture guys, he said, "The Pentagon

960
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:04,920
 was symbolically levitated in people's minds."

961
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:05,920
 >> Oh.

962
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:06,920
 >> Yeah, that's such a...

963
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:07,920
 >> That's pretty good.

964
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:08,920
 >> ...crap excuse.

965
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:09,920
 >> That's like my facts on this show.

966
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:13,600
 It is true if you just believe hard enough.

967
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:17,400
 He, Hoffman, by the way, I'm saying that he was sort of part of a peaceful movement and

968
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,400
 so on.

969
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:22,960
 But, you know, he did write a very infamous book, which was called "Steal This Book."

970
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:27,720
 Kind of like the Anarchist Cook book, it had a lot of stuff in there that you don't want

971
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:28,720
 people reading.

972
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:31,720
 You know, there was bomb-making, that kind of stuff in order to...

973
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:35,960
 But it was largely a book about how can you help with the troubles that are going on?

974
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:39,120
 How can you make a point, but have little hacks to get through it?

975
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:44,000
 So, for example, if you need to talk to a large crowd, don't spend ages doing what we

976
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
 have here.

977
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
 You know, like...

978
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
 >> Booking a theater.

979
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
 >> Booking a theater.

980
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
 All that stuff.

981
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
 There's a lot of money.

982
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,140
 You know, go to a show where there's a theater booked and before the show starts, jump on

983
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:54,140
 stage.

984
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:55,140
 They've got a PA system.

985
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:59,560
 Just use what they're using and go and don't do it here, obviously, Glasgow, but that's

986
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:03,760
 what his suggestion was and always do it prior to a show because you don't want to preach

987
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:06,560
 to people who are going to get angry at you for interrupting a show.

988
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:07,560
 >> That's fine.

989
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:08,560
 That's not too dangerous.

990
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:12,080
 The bookmaking stuff is bad, but I think interrupting someone's show...

991
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,080
 >> Yeah, yeah.

992
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:14,080
 >> I'm okay with that.

993
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:17,040
 >> No, arguably the most dangerous thing about the book was it's called "Steal This Book,"

994
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,520
 encouraging everyone to not pay for it in the shops that they were.

995
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:20,520
 And that's what...

996
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:21,520
 >> Did it happen?

997
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:22,520
 That happened?

998
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:23,520
 >> Yeah, it did get stolen.

999
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:26,280
 He should have called it "Buy This Book" or "Buy Ten Copies of This Book."

1000
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,280
 >> Yes.

1001
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:31,720
 >> I think that might have defeated his object while, yes, making him some more money, James.

1002
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:35,960
 >> I think he did call his autobiography something like coming to a theater near you or something

1003
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:38,800
 like that, soon to be adapted into cinema.

1004
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,280
 Yeah, so he did have titles like that.

1005
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:45,040
 >> I think on the last page of the bucket, it has a list of other books worth stealing.

1006
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,040
 >> Nice.

1007
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,040
 >> Oh, that's nice.

1008
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:50,080
 >> Oh, I thought you were about to list all of our books, so it was a bit of slight publicity,

1009
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:51,080
 but no, okay.

1010
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:54,480
 >> They invaded Disneyland in 1970.

1011
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:57,200
 They managed a huge victory there.

1012
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,280
 That night, Disneyland had to close slightly early.

1013
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:01,280
 >> Wow.

1014
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:03,240
 >> Take that, the men.

1015
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:07,480
 >> But supposedly, Andy was only the second time in Disney's history where they had to

1016
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:11,120
 shut and get everyone out in order to deal with the situation, so for Disney, it was

1017
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:15,160
 a big deal because they were going to liberate Minnie Mouse.

1018
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:18,120
 They were staying on Tom Sawyer's Island.

1019
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:20,920
 >> They wanted to liberate Minnie Mouse and cook Porky Pig.

1020
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:24,760
 Again, another very pig-based, they clearly turned to violence by this point.

1021
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:27,760
 It's just two years after they were being nice to pigs.

1022
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,560
 >> But you're missing the main thing about that.

1023
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:32,240
 Porky Pig's not a Disney character, so it's not even there.

1024
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,120
 So they got there, and there was no Porky Pig.

1025
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:37,880
 >> You've got to know your genre, you know your brand.

1026
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:41,160
 Hoffman played by Sasha Baron Cohen quite recently, if anyone's ever seen the film,

1027
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:44,640
 The Trial of the Chicago Seven, and very confusing.

1028
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:48,560
 So The Trial of the Chicago Seven was basically, there was a huge riot, and they were all put

1029
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:54,560
 on trial, these guys, and Hoffman and Reuben went into court wearing judicial robes, basically

1030
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:55,560
 disguised as the judge.

1031
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:56,560
 >> Brilliant.

1032
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:01,200
 >> This was even more confusing, given that the judge was also called Hoffman.

1033
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:06,920
 And then so confusingly, Reuben, the other one, went on to meet a nemesis.

1034
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:13,360
 He moved to Miami, and he decided to lead this thing to occupy a golf course for one

1035
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:15,720
 to achieve one of his aims with a bunch of people.

1036
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:20,280
 And he met his nemesis, who was also called Reuben, so it was Reuben versus Reuben, faced

1037
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:23,040
 off against each other in this church in Miami.

1038
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:26,640
 And then he turned into a stockbroker.

1039
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:30,400
 >> And they went on tours with Yopi versus Yipi, didn't they?

1040
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:31,400
 >> They did.

1041
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:35,080
 This is after Jerry Reuben became this big-shot stockbroker, and kept saying, but it's good,

1042
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:37,200
 it's all part of the be good plan.

1043
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,200
 >> What's a Yopi again?

1044
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:39,200
 What's that, Definder?

1045
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,800
 >> Young, openly mobile professional person.

1046
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:41,800
 >> Yeah.

1047
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:44,080
 >> Just a comment from the '80s with a big mobile phone.

1048
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:45,080
 >> Yeah.

1049
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:46,080
 >> Okay, right.

1050
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:51,680
 >> So Anita and Abby Hoffman had a child that they called America.

1051
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:54,760
 America with a small a, because they didn't want him to be pretentious.

1052
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:59,240
 But actually, it does seem okay, actually.

1053
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:02,080
 >> That will come across really well over the phone, won't it?

1054
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:03,080
 No, no, no.

1055
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:04,080
 Small a.

1056
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:07,800
 >> He later changed his name to Alan.

1057
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:09,880
 >> Still with a small a?

1058
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:15,400
 >> No, he's now half Alan and half America, because he's changed his name back to America,

1059
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:18,400
 but he's kept the capital a from Alan.

1060
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,400
 >> Right.

1061
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:20,880
 >> General political protests?

1062
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:21,880
 >> Yeah, sure.

1063
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:23,400
 >> Now's not the time, Andy.

1064
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:26,200
 >> I've gathered us all here for a reason.

1065
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:30,200
 No, I was just reading about other protests of various kinds.

1066
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:33,600
 So pig-based protests, actually, specifically I started looking into.

1067
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:34,600
 >> Okay.

1068
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:35,600
 >> There was one in Taiwan a few years ago.

1069
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:36,600
 It was a big debate.

1070
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:40,400
 Do we let an American pork, which has been treated with this particular chemical, spanned

1071
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:41,400
 in lots of countries?

1072
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:45,280
 Anyway, this was the report from, I think, the New York Times.

1073
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:50,120
 Members of the Kuomintang on Friday threw pig hearts, intestines, lungs, and other innards.

1074
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:52,040
 This is in parliament.

1075
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:56,320
 This parliament became a, what's it called, Mardi Gras, what's the tomato thing?

1076
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:57,320
 >> Oh, tamatina.

1077
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:59,180
 >> Yeah, it was like that, but with pig hearts.

1078
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:00,180
 >> Oh.

1079
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:03,960
 >> And they threw other innards, leaving the chambers crimson carpet street with ropey

1080
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:09,360
 strands of intestine and milky viscera.

1081
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:13,200
 Some lawmakers donned rain jackets, others brawled in business suits soiled by what appeared

1082
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,520
 to be bits of pig fat.

1083
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:15,520
 >> Oh.

1084
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:18,680
 >> So, you know, just when you think our politicians are bad, that's...

1085
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:20,360
 >> No, that's great.

1086
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:21,520
 We could do with more of that.

1087
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:26,760
 >> We would all tune into BBC Parliament if we were expecting awful to be hurled around

1088
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:27,760
 it.

1089
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:28,760
 >> That is true.

1090
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:33,200
 >> Similarly, in 1975, there was a group of vegetarians in Michigan that protested McDonald's.

1091
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,200
 It was a two-floor McDonald's.

1092
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:39,600
 They went to the top floor and all vomited onto the people below.

1093
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:40,600
 >> On command?

1094
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:45,320
 >> They all downed a mixture of mustard and water and then immediately vomited.

1095
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:46,320
 >> Wow.

1096
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:47,320
 >> But not in unison, right?

1097
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:48,320
 You can't...

1098
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:49,320
 And that would take so much practice.

1099
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:50,320
 Synchronising.

1100
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:55,760
 >> I don't like the fountains of the Bellagio, I don't think, but it was kind of around

1101
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,560
 the same time, at least.

1102
00:47:57,560 --> 00:48:03,640
 And the newspapers got a press release afterwards, which they reported was written in either

1103
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:05,280
 blood or chocolate syrup.

1104
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:07,760
 I'm going to go for the latter.

1105
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:08,760
 >> Yeah.

1106
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:15,520
 >> There was an election in Iceland this year, and one of the candidates, or someone who's

1107
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:22,840
 trying to become a candidate, was Snaesfell Jorkudl, which is a glacier.

1108
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:27,720
 The rules say that to become president, you have to be an Icelandic citizen, and actually,

1109
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:33,560
 in Iceland a few years ago, they made a new law that all of the glaciers are now citizens.

1110
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:34,920
 So it passed on that.

1111
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:43,320
 You had to be age over 35, glacier, 700,000 years old, and no criminal record.

1112
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:48,440
 And the only reason that it didn't become is they didn't get enough signatures.

1113
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:49,440
 People didn't sign.

1114
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,680
 Otherwise, there's no reason why it couldn't do.

1115
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:56,360
 And it's actually the glacier that's mentioned in Journey to the Centre of the Earth by Shilfern.

1116
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:57,360
 >> Oh, wow.

1117
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:58,360
 >> Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1118
00:48:58,360 --> 00:48:59,360
 >> That's the one they go through.

1119
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:00,840
 So that could have been President of Iceland.

1120
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:01,840
 >> Oh, man.

1121
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:03,440
 >> And they're going to go for it again next time.

1122
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:06,960
 >> That would have been so nice, just for someone for Joe Biden to stand next to him,

1123
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:16,360
 feel young, and sprightly.

1124
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:17,360
 >> That is it.

1125
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:18,360
 That is all of our facts.

1126
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:19,680
 Thank you so much for listening.

1127
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:22,640
 We will be back again next time with another episode.

1128
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:24,280
 But thank you so much, Glasgow.

1129
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:25,280
 That was awesome.

1130
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:26,360
 And we'll see you all again.

1131
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:27,360
 Goodbye.

1132
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:42,080
 [Applause]

1133
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:44,660
 (upbeat music)

1134
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:54,660
