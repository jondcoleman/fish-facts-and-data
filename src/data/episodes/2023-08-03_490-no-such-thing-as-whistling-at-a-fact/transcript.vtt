00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.280
 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Things as a Fish, where we were

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:09.360
 joined at the Soho Theatre in London by the incredible Kariad Lloyd. Now if you are a regular

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.080
 listener to No Such Things as a Fish, you will know of course who Kariad is. She's a very good

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:19.280
 friend of ours, she's a comedian, she's an actor, she's a podcaster, she's just an all-round genius,

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:24.800
 let's be honest. She has a book out which you definitely should check out, it's called You Are

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.000
 Not Alone, it's about death but that sounds like it's going to be depressing but it really isn't,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.600
 it's extremely uplifting that book and there's loads of facts in there as well, it's definitely one

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.120
 that I think you'll really, really enjoy. And the other thing to say is that Kariad does an

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:47.360
 improvised show called Ostentatious. Now this is a really amazing show, what happens is you turn up,

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:55.040
 someone in the audience gives them a hitherto lost, let's say, Jane Austen play title that they've

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:01.520
 made up, the guys have never heard it before and they do an entire Jane Austen play completely

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.640
 improvised. It is absolutely stunningly brilliant, if you haven't seen it you can't miss it, if you

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.880
 have seen it go again because it's different every single night and they are about to do

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.320
 another run at London's West End at the Arts Theatre. Now the best way to find out about those

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:25.600
 tickets is to go to ostentatiousimpro.com that's A-U-S-T-E-N-T-A-T-I-O-U-S-I-M-P-R-O.com

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.200
 but let's be honest, who types in URLs these days? Just go to a search engine, search for

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.240
 ostentatious and you will find all the information there. Anyway really hope you enjoy this week's

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.720
 show with Kariad Lloyd, all that's left to say is on with the podcast!

00:01:40.880 --> 00:02:02.400
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast this week

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.040
 coming to you live from the Soho Theatre in London!

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.360
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray and

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:20.160
 Kariad Lloyd and once again we have gathered round the microphones with our four favourite facts

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:26.400
 from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go starting with fact number one

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:35.360
 and that is Andy. My fact is that the maximum PDF file you can send is bigger than Belgium.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:43.280
 Can we replace Belgium? Just with a PDF?

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:49.920
 Of Belgium, yes you can! Okay in fact it's bigger than that, okay right, the maximum

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:56.320
 PDF size you can send is the square with size that are 381 kilometres long, that is bigger than

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:02.880
 Belgium, Monaco, San Marino, Liechtenstein, Malta, Andorra, Luxembourg, Montenegro, Slovenia, Albania

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:10.960
 and Moldova combined. It is huge! It's mega! Has anyone sent something that big?

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:20.320
 Unclear! So I worked out that if you wanted to print it out on A4 paper it would take 2.3 trillion

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:29.040
 pieces and if I did it on my printer at home I could have started it off at the time when the

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.160
 first human fossils were appearing in the fossil records and it would be just about finishing now.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:41.440
 No! Subject to jams and cartridge replacements, that's brilliant, that's so good, I should say

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.760
 where I got this from, I saw a guy called Steve Bobrick put it up on Twitter and basically

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:55.360
 we should say this appears to only be an adobe acrobat limit. Damn them controlling us as always!

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:02.720
 Theoretically there could be a bigger PDF out there. So this is what in the adobe rules it says

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.560
 that this is the maximum you're allowed or something. Yeah it's the adobe acrobat, it's 15

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:14.320
 million inches by 15 million inches. It's just the rules, it's not even... No it's their internal

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:19.200
 limit but the file format itself might not be bound by the adobe. They would probably just have

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:24.720
 to click and write 25 million and maybe we'd be able to get even bigger. Maybe, maybe, but I don't

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.800
 think anyone's ever actually sent one that's this big. No, why would you? Why would he be insane?

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:36.560
 Is that an email attachment or are we talking we transfer here? Oh I think that's a dropbox,

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:48.400
 I don't think you can we transfer that. So PDFs, pretty dry, pretty dry. It's amazing when we send

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.680
 each other our facts round and we have to then go and research them of course and Andy sent us

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:59.120
 the PDF and said maybe it's the most boring fact you've ever sent. Yeah and James said it's not

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:07.040
 even close, not even top ten. But I mean we can get on to more general stuff but I do just want to

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:13.600
 say that adobe, you know adobe acrobat the program that do the PDFs is named after some mud. Named

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:21.280
 after some mud. Adobe it's a building material isn't it? It is. You make it half like poo and wool

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:30.480
 I think. Here is mud. James don't attempt poo and wool and be like this is it we can make a house.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:36.400
 That's the worst three little pigs ever isn't it? And the fourth little pig made his house out of

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:41.760
 poo and wool. And the wolf said I'm all right actually because you guys you stay in there it's

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:47.200
 fine. I should just explain the mud thing sorry I want to call it a year. Because otherwise I could

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.880
 feel the tension in the room. Or they were waiting they were just desperate to know. When is he going to explain about the mud?

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:58.480
 The founder of adobe, I'm sorry. You thought you cut to live podcast this is a conference for adobe

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:03.760
 and this is how they get their employees in. It's there's a creek which goes past the home

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:07.840
 of the founder who's called John Warnock and it has this it has this mud in it it's this very malleable

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:12.960
 clay. I did go on a little wild goose chase trying to find out who the original adobe acrobat actually

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:20.880
 was. There wasn't one that wasn't right. That would make it an interesting story. Okay and so he named it after

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:27.600
 the some mud some mud by the yeah exactly yeah but it's malleable but pdf's are famously inflexible

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:32.480
 you're right completely untangible. Are you just like I'm just sending you paper like why did he

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:38.080
 think oh yeah this clay this reminds me of mine. An acrobat's so flexible as well. Yeah everything

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:43.680
 is completely wide open. The rules the idea that this is what they would say this is the limits

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:50.080
 to what you have. I find it kind of funny when there are computer rules that just are just so

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:54.960
 makeshift and and sort of seemingly why would you ever say that out loud. Apple three I don't know if

00:06:54.960 --> 00:07:01.440
 anyone is old enough to remember Apple three but so it was their third. No wait Apple three was the third.

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:11.840
 What this is crazy. So yeah it was a it was a hard drive basically that suffered because

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:16.960
 there was no fan on it and Steve Jobs had this thing where he just hated the sound of fans

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:22.000
 and so he was like let's not include yeah and so it overheated all the time and when it overheated

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.640
 it meant that any disk going in would suddenly just melt and so you're pulling out the hard drive

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:32.240
 disk and so yeah so it was a big big problem and one of the employees of Apple was so angry with

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:37.040
 it that he slammed it down out of frustration onto his desk and discovered that that made it work

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:43.600
 again so if you called up Apple saying it does not work their official line was lift it up lift

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:48.800
 the computer up by two inches and just drop it on the table and that's what fixed it that was the

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:52.960
 official line that came from them. Percussive maintenance they call that don't they. What's

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:58.080
 that. Just whacking something and hope it works. Oh yeah right yeah yeah. I don't I don't think

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:00.720
 we've mentioned this before we might have done. Do you know what the longest a computer has been

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:05.360
 left running is or the longest running computer ever. I haven't turned my laptop off since 2016.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:10.800
 Period seven years. You don't need to just rest it's asleep then it wakes up again. Yeah yeah

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:14.960
 nothing works. Do you mean not even closing the lid. I reckon this one might not even have a lid.

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:22.160
 Whoa. Right. James is right. I didn't and I was about to say the longest like the running computer

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:29.520
 on earth but then I didn't say that. Clue. So it's not an earth. That's right. Great.

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:36.080
 Is it in a spaceship. It's in a spaceship. Right. It's the Voyager ones. Voyager ones which

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:42.480
 have been on since more than 40 years now. The 70s I guess. Yeah since the 70s. And they're still

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:47.120
 working. They're still working. It's a pair of link computers on board Voyager which just sent

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:51.600
 towards the edge of the solar system and it's still going. Each one has 70 kilobytes of memory.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:55.920
 I mean they're really tiny. Are they like 1970s computers though? They're like old school. They're

00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:00.000
 not huge. They're not room sized. They're much smaller than that. If they start working they'll

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.520
 slam them into Pluto aren't they. They've got a big monitor and you have to run like CS DOS on it.

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:14.000
 I know some things about computers. They had this really big problem in 2015 because the

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
 last of the original programmers was a guy called Larry Zottarelli and he retired

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:23.440
 and they were stuffed because it was like you need to learn ancient cuneiform of computer

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:28.320
 languages. Right. To get it. To get this. Like no one is teaching these computer languages. He's

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:31.920
 still alive. You're not dead. Just call him up. He's retired. He's old. He's retired. He doesn't

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:39.040
 want to be. Get him to write out a handover sheet. People know. I'm sure NASA know about. He's like

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:46.480
 no I'm done. That's it. You've had my time. It's hard. It's hard to learn the systems required. No. Okay.

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:53.040
 Yeah. All right. There was a computer that analyzed 4000 computer science papers

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:57.120
 and it came up with what they call the best computer scientists in the world.

00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:01.360
 They describe him as the Michael Jordan of computer science. Do you know who it is?

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:03.680
 No. It's Michael Jordan.

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:11.680
 Is it someone with the same name or is it the answer? Okay. The Michael Jordan of computer

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:16.800
 science is Michael Jordan. Call your kids Michael Jordan. That's clear. It's nominative determinism.

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:21.680
 Just Michael Jordan. That's really fun. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Do they refer to Michael Jordan

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:27.600
 as the Michael Jordan of basketball? Have you had a Fernando Corbato?

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:36.800
 I can't tell until you pronounce it properly. I want to be the Fernando Corbato of something.

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:43.040
 Yeah. Well, he was. He was the Fernando Corbato of. He died in 2019. He was 93 years old and he

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:52.320
 invented something we all have. Oh, and we've got loads of them. Oh, personalities. Daddy issues.

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:06.320
 Nudge yourself closer to the topic at hand. I'll go for transistors. No? Passwords.

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:10.960
 Oh, did he? The man who invented the computer password. Always his mother's maiden name.

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:18.400
 Michael Jordan. Michael Jordan. But with the numbers changed for the letters. Yeah. I think it was

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:21.760
 the 50s that he invented it and it was because most computers worked on one thing at a time because

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:26.080
 they were the size of rooms and they were, you know, they had processing power but not much and

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:30.160
 he was trying to work out a way like a timeshare system so lots of people could work on the

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:34.560
 same computer different tasks, you know. And so he just reasoned that that's the best way of hiding

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:39.440
 your files from each other inside the computer. Wow. And I've entered that. Yeah. In 2003.

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:46.160
 That is, you're right. It was a sexy fact. But the thing is we don't whistle at facts anymore.

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:54.320
 Well, wait, I mean. It's just, it's not okay. I'm sorry. I don't want to be a downer.

00:11:54.320 --> 00:12:02.240
 Actually, Cariad, it made me feel empowered. There's always one working against the movement.

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:10.320
 What can I say? In 2003, a survey found that 90% of office workers passing through Waterloo

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:17.120
 Station would give away their computer password in exchange for a biro. Just a biro? Not even a

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:21.200
 chocolate? Well, another one. Another survey in 2003 found that 70% of people would do it in exchange

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:27.920
 for some chocolate. 100%. 34% of people just gave their password without even needing the bribe.

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:32.480
 So what's your password? They just told them. That's so good. That was in the past when you

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:37.600
 you only needed like four, right? Yeah. There's no way you can even remember them. Yeah. That's

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:44.880
 amazing. I got a quick story about a Microsoft laptop that there was a mystery. It kept crashing.

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:50.560
 This is 2005. So the culprit of the problem was Janet Jackson.

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:56.640
 Is it the real Janet Jackson? The real Janet Jackson. And it was her song Rhythm Nation.

00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:04.080
 And what it was is that the frequency of it was at such the same level of which the disk was spinning

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:09.680
 that it would send the disk into a wobble and it would crash. And even if Rhythm Nation was playing

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:15.440
 from one laptop but being heard by another laptop, that would crash as well. Like Dogwist or just

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:20.400
 be like, is it me? Yeah, yeah, exactly. So it was, yeah. So Janet Jackson was responsible for a

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:25.840
 whole software update or whatever of a Microsoft laptop. She's constantly innovating. She is.

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:33.040
 You, do you know the, you won't know this, but can you guess the picture? What is it? What is it?

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:38.640
 We need more. We need more. That was almost a sentence, but not quite. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:44.240
 So the picture, which has the most pixels in it. So the image that has the most pixels in the world

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:54.000
 has 102 terapixels. Okay. Security, security. No, no, come on now. It feels nice, doesn't it?

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:59.120
 No, no, that did not feel nice. That was, that fact was just minding its own business.

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:05.360
 Okay, get ready to whistle. Can you guess what the picture is of? Belgium.

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:12.240
 Is it like Tetris, just to give you a t-shirt? Or is it like very pixelated?

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:17.040
 No, it's, it's pixelated in the fact that it has a lot of pixels in it. It's not like,

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:20.160
 oh, okay, okay. But basically, if you made it really small, it would be really clear. That's

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:26.000
 the point. I'll say a big telescope thing like the universe. Mona Lisa. Oh gosh, no, it is the world's

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:33.280
 biggest penis. Wow. Well, welcome to the whistle. This is your perfect partner. Wait, do you mean

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:38.320
 it's the world's biggest picture of a penis or the world's biggest penis? Clarify, we need that.

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:43.200
 It's a picture of a normal sized penis, but it's the world's biggest image. And what's a normal size

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:52.880
 penis? Just asking for a friend. So many issues. If they, if they made each pixel one inch. That's

00:14:52.880 --> 00:15:01.360
 not a normal sized penis. That also wasn't really an inch, but we'll not go into that. If you made

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:08.720
 each pixel an inch, it would wrap around the earth 2.7 times this image. And if you,

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:20.400
 if you are printed it out to the same specs as a billboard, it would be as tall as 16,408

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:25.520
 Empire State buildings. And if you 3D printed that, you would be able to poke the International

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:34.800
 Space Station. And you need permission before you do that. Okay. It was invented by a former NASA

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:49.040
 intern who does not wish to be identified. We need to move on to our next act, guys. It is time for

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:56.640
 fact number two. And that is Kariat. During the 17th century, when you died, your relatives were

00:15:56.640 --> 00:16:02.320
 legally forced to bury you wearing wool, whether you liked it or not. And there was for no other

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:10.160
 reason than to support the ailing wool industry. I love this fact. Okay. So basically there was

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:18.160
 an act by parliament in 1666 that overnight said everybody has to be buried in wool. And it sounds

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:22.640
 like, oh, okay. But previously to that, nobody was buried in wool ever. Ever. That was like an

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:28.400
 unusual thing to happen. You were buried in a linen shroud like Jesus in the Bible. And no coffin,

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:32.400
 no coffin, right? Sometimes they did have coffins. Sometimes they had coffins. It was unusual.

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:36.480
 But it was very unusual. You would mostly be wrapped in a shroud and just shoved in the earth.

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:42.320
 And because the wool industry was so important, and they were so worried about linen coming from

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:50.560
 France, basically, classic fucking French linen coming over here taking our coffins. The government

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:59.280
 basically said, I know. It was your GB news show coming on. Listen, the British wool. I am sweating,

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:05.280
 but I am British. So many people employed in the wool industry, 12% of the population worked in

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:10.000
 the wool industry. And it brought in a huge amount of money. So they said, well, we'll just make it

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:15.680
 a law that you have to be buried in a wool suit in a coffin lined with wool. And if you weren't,

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:23.920
 you will find five pounds, which is the equivalent of 550 pounds today. So basically,

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:27.680
 initially, everyone was like, no, fuck you. Where are we going to get this from? No one has

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:32.160
 this. We have a history of this. And the linens they used to wrap them in would be your family

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:36.320
 linen. So you would have something that has been like a tablecloth, and you would keep it all night,

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:39.200
 and then you would sew them together. The women would sew it together and wrap everybody up.

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:45.600
 So it's like a very nice thing. And so people weren't following the law. So then they made it

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:50.640
 that you had to go to the keeper of the peace. Two members of your family had to sign an affidavit

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:55.200
 saying, we have done this, otherwise you'd be fine. So you had to go to the church and swear,

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:59.200
 like based on the Bible, we buried them in wool, sorry. Yeah, there was an oath you had to read,

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:05.120
 right? Yeah, a special oath, which I've got here saying, no corpse or any person, except any person

00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:11.200
 that shall die of the plague. Fuck them. That's because they thought it lived on in the wool.

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:16.240
 Shall be buried in any shift sheet or shroud or anything whatsoever made or mingled with flax,

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:22.800
 hemp, silk, hair, gold, or silver in any stuff or thing other than what is made of sheep's wool

00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:28.480
 only. That's a name how to say that. But the fine that you mentioned, the five pound fine,

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:33.760
 if you grasped someone up as being buried in non-wool, then you could get half of the five

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:40.880
 pounds. Yeah. And this is the really clever thing. If you had buried your relative in Lennon and you

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:45.600
 knew that you were likely to be caught anyway, you could go and grasp up on your own relative,

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:50.080
 get a half the fine, back into the family, you've only paid half the fine. Did they do that? Yeah,

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:54.800
 they did. So rich people did that. So some people who like, there were certain areas where it was

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:58.240
 very much didn't, they didn't approve of it. And so rich people would be like, well fuck you. Well,

00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:03.600
 you said that like one of the rules was you couldn't bury in gold. Yeah. So I think if you're

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:09.200
 burying someone in gold, probably you can afford the five pounds. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Exactly.

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:15.200
 So there was a study that was done between 1678 and 1707, less than one percent, and this was in

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:20.800
 Henstridge. Yes. Less than one percent of burials in the churchyard were in Lennon, so following this

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:26.000
 rule. But then when you went inside the church itself, it was between nine and 13 percent that

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:32.320
 were then rich people in the church. Yeah, yeah, exactly. One interesting part of this is that,

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:37.920
 okay, so you started to have loads more extra linen and extra cloth around because you were

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:44.320
 using the wool for the burials. And newspapers were made out of recycled cloth. So that's why

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:48.480
 you call that a rag now, because they used to use the rags, turn into newspaper and then make

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:53.840
 newspapers. And so they had all of these extra bits of linen, which meant they could make more

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:58.960
 newspapers. And there was a huge boom of newspapers around that time. And this sort of fed into that.

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:03.520
 They were pleased about it. Everyone else was pissed off. And there's an amazing, have you

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:08.480
 heard of Deca Mittford? And I've talked to you guys about her before. Yeah, one of the Jessica

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:14.880
 Mittford sisters who were like these socialite 20th century British figures who were involved in

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:18.800
 every single thing that happened. She went to America, she was a communist, she went to America,

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:23.120
 kind of disowned her family. In the 60s, she wrote this book called An American Way of Death.

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:28.320
 Okay. It was like, it's very odd because she was a British socialite that had like gone to fight

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:32.400
 in Spain and then moved to America. Very unusual story. But the book that she wrote basically

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:37.120
 changed the American funeral industry. Because what was happening was they were just basically

00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:42.400
 rinsing people for money. And when someone died, they used to kind of perform plastic surgery on

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:47.200
 them and then barmed them and so make them look, I mean, or she describes like basically nip and

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:51.520
 tuck the tissue across the body with implants, pins and fillers to mask blemishes and swellings

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:55.680
 that come with age and illness before sowing the face into the most attractive and youthful

00:20:55.680 --> 00:21:00.080
 expression possible. Sewing it. Teeth were whitened, makeup applied and the corpse was

00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:07.120
 dressed in its final outfit. Yes, I would like all of this. There was a special kind of bra

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:14.080
 designed for post-mortem form restoration. I'll pass on that. So she wrote this book exposing...

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:21.440
 Why is Andy in a bra? It was part of the package. She wrote this amazing book that exposed,

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:24.880
 basically they were they were preying on the vulnerable. So these poor people who had no

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:29.120
 money would end up paying like thousands of dollars for what was considered like a proper funeral.

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:33.600
 And her book was like in the bestsellers for years. David Bowie listed it as one of his favorite

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:38.480
 ever books, top 100 books because she changed everything. And they were putting so many chemicals

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:42.960
 in at that time. It was so dangerous. And that's why like funeral makers were dying of cancer from

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:48.640
 inhaling on the formaldehyde. Grim. There's one kind of fun thing they used to do. I bought it

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:55.680
 down. Bring us back to the fun stuff. This is in ancient Roman funerals. You could pay an actor,

00:21:55.680 --> 00:22:00.960
 and a lot of people did this, you would pay an actor to dress up and wear a mask as the person

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:07.200
 who died. Yes. And then in the party they'd kind of mingle with everyone. Yes. Pretending that they

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:13.120
 were still alive and like parodying the things that they did. Oh wait, is it... I don't want to

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:19.680
 be parodied, but I would love someone to be doing some of my good stuff. I'd even write some lines

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:24.480
 for them to... I think that's a great idea. Andy at a funeral. I know. Some dude walking around going,

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:30.640
 "Did you know the largest PDF I'm ever..." Thank God, thank God, thank God he died.

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:38.640
 That's amazing. Look, wool. I'm sorry, bring me back to wool. We went after death.

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:43.520
 Wool is an amazing material. It's like a super substance that I had no idea about. Have you

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:50.560
 not heard of wool before now? I didn't know how good wool was basically. So it's covered in scales.

00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:54.240
 If you look, if you zoom in, you look at it with the microscope, it's covered in scales. So liquid

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:58.880
 water slides off the outside, right? So it's very hydrophobic, I guess, so it's good at protecting

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:06.000
 you from water, but it not absorbs, it adsorbs water easily, right? So if you have water vapor

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:11.600
 in here, it kind of makes its way into the wool, like underneath the scales. So once the water

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:17.920
 gets in, that keeps you nicely cool, for example. Wait, so sorry, it's pushing off water. It pushes

00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:23.280
 off liquid water, but it takes in water vapor, okay? So you try to wear a wool jumper in summer,

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:28.640
 and then winter as well. Oh, sorry, yeah, yeah. It releases heat, so that can also warm you up,

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:31.920
 even if it's got water vapor inside it. So that's the way of keeping you warm. So if you fall in a

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:38.480
 river that's freezing cold, and then you get to dry land, be wearing wool. Like, don't wear cotton

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:43.760
 if you've done that. Right. Basically, because you'll be much less harmed if you're wearing wool,

00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:49.040
 which has repelled the outside water, it's not wet on the inside. That's a top tip. Yeah. It's a top

00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:55.200
 tip. If there's two of you on like a raft, and only one of you can stay on the raft, the one who's

00:23:55.200 --> 00:24:00.080
 wearing wool gets pushed in, is what you're saying. Yeah, exactly. Right. Don't be on a raft with

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:05.680
 James. They've invented a new kind of sheep this year, that's exciting. A new kind of sheep. They've

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:10.400
 bred a multifunctional sheep for the first time, which is very exciting. Okay, let's go for the

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:15.680
 functions. Does it do your diary, organise it on a cook? It just does wool and meat, basically.

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:20.960
 But that's new. And have the two been mutually exclusive before that? I think this is the most

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:26.800
 multifunctional sheep they've ever come up with. Wow. The sheep three. It's a sheep three. Is it

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:32.480
 not working? Just drop it. Drop it from a short height. Well, yeah, that's incredible. I knew

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:38.800
 sheep. That's amazing. Oh, I saw an amazing picture online, which I want to go see in person. If you

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:43.280
 go to which museum is it? I think it's in the Science Museum. Yeah, it's a Science Museum.

00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:49.600
 There's a jumper there made of wool, which is on display. Can you guess why the Science Museum

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:55.520
 would have a notable jumper of wool? Knitted by expedition. That's good. No, no. So it's not

00:24:55.520 --> 00:25:00.560
 been to the North Pole? Not been to the North Pole. Knitted by Einstein. Knitted by some famous

00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:06.800
 scientist. No. What's their famous sheep? Dolly. Dolly's jumper. There we go. It is wool from the

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:12.400
 first mammal ever cloned, Dolly. The sheared wool turned into a jumper. And they've only made one.

00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:20.000
 Idiots. Yeah. And it's got sheep on it. It's really beautiful. That's not beautiful, but it's, you

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:26.000
 know, it's a bit cartoony. Pretty cool though, isn't it? It's very cool. The wool industry was so

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:32.480
 important for Britain that they had to do loads of laws for it. So there was this thing with the

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:36.640
 burials. But there was another thing where they tried to get rid of all the wolves, because obviously

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:43.920
 the wolves were killing the sheep. So Edward I paid one guy, Peter Corbett, to destroy all the wolves

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:50.000
 in Britain, which he managed. We don't have any wolves anymore. Hey, what are you up to? I'm just

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:56.000
 killing all the wolves in Britain. And William the Conqueror would grant land to people in North

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:01.680
umberland and Cumberland on the condition that they would defend the land from any wolves and any

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:09.680
 Scotsman. It was mean putting them second in the list. Did you know, I'm sure you knew, it's about

00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:17.360
 the wool sack that is in the House of Parliament. It looks like a sort of giant cushion called the

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:23.280
 wool sack, and it's where the Lord Speaker sits. And that was introduced by some, I had it written

00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:27.280
 down, I've lost it, some king, basically a long time ago, to commemorate how important the wool

00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:31.520
 trade is. And now it's stuffed with wool, a blended wool from Britain and the other wool

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:36.240
 producing nations of the Commonwealth, the ones we stole. Common wolf more like.

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:46.000
 He's a slow hand clap. It didn't feel empowering. I didn't feel. No, just on the wool sack, they,

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:51.760
 I think that it was, it's centuries old, it's really, really old. And in 1938, they opened it up

00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:56.480
 and they found out, oh, it's horse hair, completely full of horse hair, full of wool.

00:26:56.480 --> 00:27:04.400
 Scandal, that is. So now they filled it with the Commonwealth wool. Do you know where we almost

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:09.280
 had wool? Where? It's such a, like, on our bodies. Do you mean like humans used to have? On our bodies,

00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:18.720
 yes. The legs. No. The arms. No. Running short. The teeth, the teeth woman. No, no, inside the body.

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:27.200
 Yes. Oh. What? How drunk are we? We used to have some kind of... No, no, no, we didn't use to, we

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:35.760
 almost had. Didn't we almost have the wool inside? We almost had wool in our, in our, in our livers,

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:44.560
 lungs, hearts. Boobies. We almost had woolen boobies. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary

00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:50.960
 evidence there. So, in the 1950s, there was a lot of experiments going on. In the 1950s? Yeah,

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:56.000
 there were... We didn't get boobs in the 1950s as a species. Oh, we did, we did. But what we did have

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:00.640
 was plastic surgery, where people were having their breasts enhanced, and there were many materials

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:04.240
 that were tested out as what we would be using for breast... That is an itchy tits.

00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:15.920
 You do get itchy tits. If that is made of wool, that is... Itchy on the inside. Oh, that's... They

00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:21.280
 tried wool? They tried wool. They tried sponges. They tried ivory balls. They tried ivory. Yeah,

00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:25.520
 they tried a lot of stuff. And then eventually it was the silicon implants that they worked in.

00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:29.280
 Sponges, so you could maybe decrease and increase them, depending on how much water you put.

00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:34.560
 Yeah, yeah. Sounds good. Anyway, I need to move us on to our next fact. Do you want to say one more

00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:39.920
 thing before we do? Well, I was just going to talk about the wool factories that we had. So,

00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:44.160
 a lot of the wool factories in the north, they would have families who basically lived in the

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:48.240
 shadow of them, and the factories would kind of look after them, feed them. They would go to

00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:53.760
 church with the factory owners, all that kind of stuff. And I was reading about one called the

00:28:53.760 --> 00:29:00.560
 Fox's Woolen Mill. They invented khaki, the stuff that you... The khaki? The thing you used to get

00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:06.080
 into your car. Yeah, yeah. Oh, that's not what I thought you said, sorry. No, the khaki material.

00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:14.800
 Cool. And they said that the children would get free woolen clothing, and they would be sewn into

00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:22.160
 their woolen underwear in September, and then let out again in May. Wow. I think they must have had

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:27.280
 an opening. Yeah, there's an engineering problem there. I think so. Wow. But yeah, imagine that.

00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:33.440
 Put a tube in. You stay warm. Yeah. But being sewn into your underwear for six months of the year.

00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:37.920
 Living Newton-John was sewn into those trousers in Greece. That's true. And they had to unpick her

00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:42.000
 every time she needed to. There was a story, wasn't there, that Franz Ferdinand, when he was shot,

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:48.080
 he'd been sewn into his uniform and... You had the band. The band. I was like, what? They're going,

00:29:48.080 --> 00:30:04.080
 take me out. Take me out. It is time for fact number three, and that is my fact. My fact this week

00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:11.840
 is that in 1914, women were only allowed to visit the Natural History Museum if a man agreed to

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:19.280
 sign a note promising that they would behave themselves. So this is, yeah, this is, as I say,

00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:25.520
 1914. I got this fact, by the way, from Dr. Fern Riddell. She's a historian. She's written in books

00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:30.640
 about suffragettes and the history of sex and all that sort. She's brilliant. You can find her on

00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:36.160
 Twitter. And she put up this link, which was for one of the museums by an author called Kerry

00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:42.800
 Lotzvaz. And it was the story of suffragettes. And during 1912 to 1914, there was so much damage

00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:48.160
 that was going on in the name of trying to get their message out, much the way that we see modern

00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:53.680
 protesting, that they would take... They would do quite sort of big acts when they are destroying

00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:58.960
 things. And museums were a particular target. And so museums basically had to shut down for a while.

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:04.080
 You had to go by appointment in some cases. But women specifically had a note that was

00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:09.680
 presented to a man, and they would have to hand in at the door, that then gave them access. And

00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:14.560
 if they did damage something, the man would be liable for the damage that they did. And the woman.

00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:22.400
 Honestly. Yeah, it was wild, wasn't it? The Natural History Museums weren't sure exactly what they might

00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:27.600
 target. The head of the museum said that unless explosives are used, the large mammals are not

00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:33.440
 likely to suffer very seriously. But they were bombing things at the time. So there was a chance

00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:36.000
 they might... If I know, they're not worried about women's rights. They're like, "Fucking hell, those

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:42.000
 elephants. They need protecting." Well, they were mostly bothered about the coral. Apparently.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:48.720
 Famously. Order of priorities. Men, coral, women. But it was such a big deal. Lloyds of London actually

00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:53.440
 started issuing householders comprehensive insurance policies that covered damages by airplanes,

00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:59.200
 riots and suffragettes. No. That was part of your insurance. As a woman, you did go to a museum.

00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:04.560
 You had to surrender your parcels, your muff and your umbrella at the door. Because all they were

00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:11.440
 all used to conceal objects you... Well, the suffragettes, they actually... The suffragettes

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:16.560
 came out saying that we're going to put hammers in our muffs. You'd be amazed what some women can do.

00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:24.560
 "Must Hammer" is a good, cool nickname for a suffragette, isn't it? WWE Muff Hammer.

00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:32.080
 Making her way to the ring. She's got a note from her husband. But he hasn't signed it!

00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:40.400
 Oh, also, we should all be saying suffragettes. Oh, really? Because they were very, very initially.

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:45.120
 Well, the word was coined by a newspaper writer, and they were originally referred to as suffragettes,

00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:49.440
 because... And they took it on because they said, "We're going to get the vote." It was the Daily Mail.

00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:54.800
 The Daily Mail coined the word "suffragette" where everyone's... But as a slam of a word?

00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:59.280
 It was a slam, because they were not the nice ones. Distinguished from the women's social and

00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:04.160
 political union. The suffragists were the ones who were being peaceful campaigners. But then it

00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:08.800
 became like, "Yeah, we are suffragettes. Fuck you." Yeah, yeah. Just on the museums, just one last thing.

00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:14.640
 The assistant keeper of the National Portrait Gallery, who was called James Milner,

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:19.360
 said that if women are to be admitted into public galleries, there seems to be no alternative,

00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:26.400
 but to handcuff their hands behind their backs, and to put up a grill in front of all the pictures

00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:34.880
 to stop them headbutting them. Sensible policies for a safer Britain. Wow. Wow. Isn't that amazing?

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:38.960
 So depressing. Yes, they really, really got up people's noses, I think is what they're saying.

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:43.680
 That's one word for it. Do you know that? Yeah. Emily Wilding Davidson. Yeah. Davidson,

00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:48.720
 the one who threw herself under the King's horse, so famously... She was the first human casualty.

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:53.440
 I was reading about her, and she was actually super violent, and had been for a very long time,

00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:57.040
 was throwing rocks. She kept trying to throw rocks at Lloyd George, but kept mistaking someone.

00:33:57.040 --> 00:34:03.120
 And she was so violent that Pankhurst was like, "Get her out. This is too much. We think she's

00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:07.280
 going to do something nuts." Yeah, because she was just attacking people, throwing herself at people.

00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:11.680
 Because they all did jiu-jitsu, didn't they? They were trained in jiu-jitsu by one of the suffragettes,

00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:16.320
 Edith Garrard. Garrard led the teaching, because she knew how to do jiu-jitsu.

00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:21.040
 And the idea behind the training was that appointed bodyguards would surround leaders,

00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:25.040
 like the Pankhurst, basically, so that they had people in front of them to do jiu-jitsu.

00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:28.960
 But they also had big wooden clubs concealed about their person.

00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:33.840
 In their muff hammers. Well, I don't know. Like, no muff is big enough to hide these clubs.

00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:35.520
 They had to hide them in their dressers. Oh, baby, you don't know!

00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:43.840
 I was reading about the slow pace of female emancipation. Just that Saudi Arabia gave women

00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:50.080
 the right to vote in 2015, leaving Vatican City as the only place where women's suffrage is still

00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:56.080
 denied today. Right. Yeah. Well, Switzerland only got it in 1991 as the whole country.

00:34:56.080 --> 00:35:03.280
 So it was 1971 that the country had universal suffrage. But all the cantons were allowed to vote

00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:06.480
 on it themselves. And they're like the sort of counties. They're like the counties, yeah. But

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:10.320
 they have a lot of things that they can kind of decide by themselves. And there was one canton,

00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:18.640
 the Appenzell in a Holden canton, that voted against women's suffrage in '73, '82 and 1990.

00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:24.800
 Fucking hell. Come on, canton. Get with it. I know. And the thing is, it's slightly weird,

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:28.880
 because the way that they vote there, they don't like going to a voting booth. They all go into

00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:36.800
 the town hall square and kind of shout. Fuck women! I said it 15 years ago, and I stand by it!

00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:44.800
 Shut up, Sandra! Yeah. And then in 1991, the federal government had to step in and say,

00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:48.720
 look, this is the rule, guys. Guys, you're embarrassing us. You're an embarrassing uncle.

00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:51.920
 It's getting really embarrassing. Have you heard of the board game Suffragetto?

00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:59.280
 No. Have you heard of the board game Pankersquith? Yeah, they came out roughly at the same time.

00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:04.640
 Really? Yeah, yeah. What's yours? My one is a game whereby it kind of looks like a chessboard,

00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:08.640
 and you have all these pieces, and on one side, you're team Suffragette, and then the other side,

00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:14.160
 you're team police, and you need to get as many... I want this game. This sounds amazing. Yeah, well,

00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:18.640
 there's only one remaining copy of it, and it's in the Bodleian Library. I'm going to go with my

00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:24.640
 Marfan Steelem, before I headbutt a painting. I think you used to be able to, like, download,

00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:28.320
 I was going to say PDFs, but I think you could, like, download the board and stuff.

00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:33.360
 Oh, yeah, right, cool. Yeah, but Pankersquith, because it was Asquith, the Prime Minister?

00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:37.520
 It was the Prime Minister at the time, and this was 1909, and it was a board game.

00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:41.440
 You had to get across the board and avoid arrest. It was the same kind of premise. Yeah, yeah.

00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:47.920
 But the violence of the Suffragette movement was part of this game of suffragetto, because

00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:52.000
 if you caught one of the suffragettes, they went to prison, and if you caught one of the policemen,

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:59.120
 they went to hospital. Yes. Yeah. And this was made by the suffragettes, I think, the board game?

00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:03.120
 Yeah, so it was their own issued game. They had a lot of merch. They had a load of merch.

00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:08.240
 Women love merch. We'll buy a tote bag. We don't care what's on it. We do not care.

00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:12.000
 What other merch did they have? Oh, they had sort of scarves, and they had badges, and they had

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:15.680
 lots of postcards. Well, the colours, the big thing was the purple one, and then they put that on

00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:19.120
 jewellery, as well, and you'd have it on rings, and it was like a secret. You could wear the colours

00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:22.560
 separately, and everyone would be like, "Oh, I know what you vote for." That was one of the things

00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:30.400
 of the, at the 2012 Olympics, they had a suffragette display as part of the opening ceremony,

00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:37.360
 and someone came out as Emily Davison wearing the purple sash that was Emily Davison's. That's

00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:42.960
 the genuine article. Yeah, which is pretty cool. We should probably say there is a bit of a debate

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:48.720
 about whether suffragette tactics won the day in the end, because they suspended all militant

00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:52.160
 activities at the start of the First World War, and then by the end of the war, women were so

00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:57.280
 integrated in industry, factories, all of that. Are you saying war's good? Is that where there's

00:37:57.280 --> 00:38:06.240
 going? Or are you saying the suffragettes are bad? Yeah. Which one, Andy? Because the live audience

00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:10.160
 and the people listening at home would like to know. Well, actually, I'm probably saying both.

00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:18.320
 Welcome to GB News. But no, there is a debate, isn't there? Well, like, it did actually,

00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:21.200
 actually did they achieve anything, because they made themselves very, very hated at the time,

00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:25.680
 and then the impression was that by the end of the war, that women were just so much more

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:28.400
 into society. But then would that have happened without them doing that movement in the first

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:32.240
 phase? I don't know, yeah. It would have been four long years. Yeah, yeah. But it's definitely like,

00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:35.840
 the tosses argue, isn't it? The tosses argue. Can I quickly, just speaking of people hiding

00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:40.960
 things in their muffs, it just reminded me of my favourite headline of all time.

00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:47.440
 So the author, Cormac McCarthy, died earlier this year, and it was a headline that I saw years ago.

00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:51.200
 This is the headline. So he only just makes a cameo, and this is not really to do with him.

00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:58.000
 Cormac McCarthy's ex-wife pulls gun from vagina during argument over aliens.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:04.960
 Tell me you're clicking on that link immediately. The Daily Telegraph has changed, hasn't it?

00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:10.640
 What was that? Where was that? It was in a newspaper. Oh, great. Yeah.

00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:15.280
 In Iraq. Yeah, by Vince Mancini. In Iraq. Yeah.

00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:18.480
 Check this out. Anyway, yeah, I've been wanting to say that for years on this podcast.

00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:31.600
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is James. Okay, my fact this week is that

00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:38.880
 a designer from Indonesia who recycles cow dung has found a way to make stools from stools.

00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:48.400
 Very nice. Thank you. Yeah, it's just a joke that stools and stools are the same thing,

00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:53.280
 but this is a thing that happened. This was a display from the last Singapore Design Week,

00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:58.320
 which I read about. It's all about upcycling. So they made lighting from old washing machine

00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:05.360
 pipes. They made rugs from dog hair. And this guy called Adhi Nugraha has his team, basically,

00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:11.360
 at his university has taken this dung. They remove the water. That gets rid of the smell.

00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:15.360
 They add a load of wood glue and stuff like that. And then they mould it into

00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:19.760
 into anything you want. You can get speakers, you can get stools, you can get flower pots,

00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:27.680
 all sorts. It's a very cool thing. It's a good way of recycling poo. A lot of it is burned,

00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:31.680
 isn't it? Cow dung in India, which is really bad for the environment. I mean, cows themselves are

00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:35.200
 very bad for the environment. And the dung, like it's full of methane and it just burning it,

00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:40.800
 just a bad idea. But it can be used to coat walls. Yeah, that's another thing. Adobe, for instance.

00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:47.040
 Yeah. Adobe. Poo and wool combined. Well, so I was reading a thing about astronaut poo and what

00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:53.680
 it might be used for for. Oh, yeah. And this is an exciting development. So it might be in future

00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:58.880
 that astronauts are able to power their own spaceship using polymers from their own poo.

00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:04.560
 So that's thrilling, as in you can send astronauts to Mars and be like, make your own way home.

00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:10.960
 When you hear some fruit and fiber. Yeah, exactly. Six months. And the other thing is they might be

00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:15.920
 able to grow their own. This is a bit is a bit of a growth factor, but trying to disregard it. So

00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:24.240
 they might be able to grow their own food from control. No one's ready. There were scientists

00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:29.680
 at Pennsylvania in 2017. They researched this thing, a bio reactor, right? So you effectively,

00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:38.000
 you poo in the tube and then the tube tube. That's a good name for it. That's actually going

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:43.360
 to make it much more palatable to people, I think. And it produces gas. It sort of gives off various

00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:50.320
 biological gases and that fuels a microbial goo. Oh, God, that's the worst word you've used so far.

00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:56.160
 We were all on board until microbial goo. Be squeamish. Microbial goo, chief.

00:41:57.840 --> 00:42:02.000
 They create a reactor and the good news, good or bad news, as I suppose it works.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:07.040
 And so that. So what is the reaction? Is it power or is it, what are they getting out of it?

00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:11.600
 This is to produce the Vegemite like microbial goo. Oh, you're going to eat it.

00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:16.240
 You're not, and I should stress, you're not eating anything that you have. It's completely

00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:20.000
 safe. You're filtering. It's like, it's all filtration. If I go to a restaurant, I don't want

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:27.760
 others to go, it is completely safe. Yes, it was once your ship, but it's not anymore. People change.

00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:32.400
 I thought as well, when you said about spearing stuff on walls, I thought that was a thing that

00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:35.920
 they were talking about deep space exploration. Because one of the problems that you have when

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:40.480
 you're flying further into space is that you go into these radiation bands where suddenly

00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:44.080
 you're just getting smashed by it. And if you put poo all over your walls.

00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:48.080
 Outside of the spaceship. Oh, is it on the outside? I believe so.

00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:51.120
 Who's doing that? I thought it was on the inside. Yeah, who's, who's

00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:54.400
 who's going outside? You can go on a spacewalk. You can go on a spacewalk.

00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:57.280
 What is your son doing at NASA again?

00:42:57.280 --> 00:43:05.360
 Peanuts, PDFs, actually. Just tell them Arthur, you smear shit on the outside of a spaceship,

00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:13.040
 and we should be proud of him. Jesus Christ. You can imagine slowly, you're sort of like 30 years

00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:17.760
 into an intergalactic mission. You're outside your spaceship. You're smearing your laided

00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:22.320
 batch of shit on the outside guy. They're taking the fucking piss, aren't they?

00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:26.960
 I should have done that drama degree, man. It's like, it's just not worth it.

00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:30.800
 I was saying, you're the fucking muffin. Go to space, they said. See the universe, they said.

00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:37.360
 I like the usual way it was on the inside. That was normal. You were like, yeah, yeah,

00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:41.200
 living in like a shit hole. Well, it makes more sense. Should we,

00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:44.640
 been going on a spacewalk to smear shit all over your ship? Yeah, I think it does.

00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:51.280
 I can just imagine NASA checking in with you, Dan, a few months into the mission.

00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:56.000
 Sorry, sorry, astronaut Shriver. We lost control and have you been...

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:05.360
 Okay, send him home. Send him home. All right, astronaut Shriver, you're going to need to

00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:10.800
 turn your entire spaceship inside out. No, Dan, you need to poo into the tube.

00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:13.840
 Wait, I meant to filter it before eating it?

00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:20.640
 The video on poo tube isn't loading. I couldn't see it.

00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:25.200
 Recycling. Recycling. Recycling.

00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:33.360
 Paper. Paper, right? Paper. Well, this is insane. Like, okay, you recycle paper. Sure.

00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:36.320
 And then... If you don't, shame on you. If you don't, and then you have recycled paper.

00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:39.920
 It's one of the easy ones. You recycle it again, right? It's one of those things that you can just

00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:45.600
 keep recycled. It turns out that you can only recycle paper seven times. The same number of

00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:53.840
 times you can fold it. Isn't that spooky? That is spooky. The tree knows. The tree is like, no more.

00:44:53.840 --> 00:45:01.920
 Wrap me in wool and put me in the ground. It's kind of like the sort of Doctor Who regeneration

00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:05.520
 limit, isn't it? Can I ask you a question, though? When you recycle it, so I want to recycle this

00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:10.160
 paper and put it in my recycling bin. How do I know if it's been recycled seven times and wasting

00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:18.560
 more recycling? This is nice paper. It gets a bit rougher, doesn't it? It does. The rough, low quality

00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:23.120
 pulpy paper. Cheap notebooks will be made of that. And then there are probably some industrial uses.

00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:27.520
 If you've got a cheap notebook, what should you put in there? I'm not the only one who's stressed

00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:30.880
 about this, right? No, no, no. Absolutely. Because you put so much in there, then you go to the big

00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:35.120
 bin on the estate, right? And it's full of fucking plastic bags because no one reads the sign properly.

00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:40.240
 And is it worth me doing it? Is that whole bin? Someone contaminates the bin. I don't think we're

00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:45.120
 saying don't recycle. I think I... No, but if you do... No, no, Karen, Karen, I've got to really

00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:50.480
 bite down on this. No, you should do it. And I do it, but it's frustrating. I know, I know. You have to

00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:58.400
 be careful what you recycle. When turbine blades, they were out sometimes, and they're really difficult

00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:03.840
 to recycle, because they're made of lots of different polymers and stuff. Controversial? Yeah,

00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:08.400
 they've got a new one, a new kind of material that they might use for turbine blades,

00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:13.360
 and you can recycle it by eating it. Oh, wow. You just get some microbial goo,

00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:20.080
 and then you spread it on top. And so what's it made of? It's made of fibreglass, but as well as

00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:25.200
 fibreglass, it's got some plant-derived polymers, it's got some synthetic polymers in, and once

00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:29.760
 it's been working for ages and you need to replace it, you can kind of dissolve it and all the

00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:36.000
 constituent parts separate, and you can reuse all those different bits. And the plant-based ones,

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:43.360
 you can turn into gummy bears. And the guy who invented it has made a wind turbine, then dissolved

00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:47.760
 it, turned it into a gummy bear and eaten those gummy bears. I mean, I like gummy bears already.

00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:52.320
 If I find out that I'm eating gummy bears, which are made from renewable energy turbines, I'm

00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:58.160
 going to be over the fucking moon. That is so good. One thing that can be recycled that has been a bit

00:46:58.160 --> 00:47:04.320
 of a bane of the recycling industry for a while is nappies. Because sometimes they contain lots

00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:07.840
 of different components, and it can be hard to separate them. This is a really good study from

00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:11.600
 this year. It's researchers from Indonesia. Actually, just whether your original fact is from

00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:17.200
 James, and it's researchers have found a way of taking nappies, used nappies, washing, drying,

00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:22.800
 sterilizing, shredding them, and then putting them into concrete and mortar. And they have

00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:29.440
 successfully built a home that is 10% old nappies. Wow. And it's completely sterile. It's

00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:35.120
 completely... And it can use two cubic meters of used nappies, one single-story home, without any

00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:40.240
 weakness of structural integrity or anything like that. And it's completely safe. It uses up a load.

00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:46.080
 I think that is about the amount a baby gets through in a year or two. No, my baby. We could

00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:52.960
 build half a Milton Key, isn't it? So that's just a trial so far. That's amazing. Even in the UK,

00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:59.520
 half of the Welsh A487 road is made of 100,000 nappies. Amazing. And they would just recycle it.

00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:03.200
 I know, plastic pellets that are then part of the road material, and then he tarmac over the top.

00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:06.560
 So when we were talking about the three little pigs earlier blowing down a shithouse,

00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:11.760
 that actually could be a reality in the future. We're going to have to wrap up, and it's that,

00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:20.160
 guys. We are at the end of the party. Yeah, so sorry. It's time. It's time. Yeah. Anything before we do?

00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:27.280
 You can recycle rare earth metals using fish sperm. We're done. We're done. No one can tell

00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:32.800
 me that's it. Is that the stuff you get those in your phone, don't you? The rare earth metal, yeah.

00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:41.760
 This is a thing. You know, "milt" is the technical name for fish sperm, basically. So scientists use

00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:46.960
 some, again, it's at the experimental stage, it's not widely used. But they made a powder out of

00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:52.400
 some salmon milk, because that is like largely composed of DNA, which largely is made up of

00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:57.520
 phosphate, right? And that is, it's charged in a way that it attracts rare earth metals to it.

00:48:57.520 --> 00:49:00.640
 Cool. So if you put it in a solution with some rare earth metals, because they obviously they're

00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:06.080
 very important to recycle, and you want to recycle as much as you can, keep it in the system going

00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:10.400
 around, and if you put it in a solution with some salmon sperm, then it can be extracted. How much

00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:15.440
 sperm do you need? Like, are we going to have to farm fish and make them ejaculate millions of times?

00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:18.800
 I think that is the problem of scale in this. You're absolutely right, because it's like a

00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:23.040
 salmon is quite small, and it is a waste product for the fish industry, but it's not. Not if you're

00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:29.760
 a Mrs. salmon. How are you getting the milk? Like, how do you collect milk? I'm just asking for a

00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:32.080
 friend. I don't know. The milk man just comes round.

00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:45.760
 Okay, that's it. That is all of our facts. Thank you so much for listening. If you'd like to get
