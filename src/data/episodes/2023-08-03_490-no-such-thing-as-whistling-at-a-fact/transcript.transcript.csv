00:00:00,00:00:03,"Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Things as a Fish, where we were"
00:00:03,00:00:09,joined at the Soho Theatre in London by the incredible Kariad Lloyd. Now if you are a regular
00:00:09,00:00:14,"listener to No Such Things as a Fish, you will know of course who Kariad is. She's a very good"
00:00:14,00:00:19,"friend of ours, she's a comedian, she's an actor, she's a podcaster, she's just an all-round genius,"
00:00:19,00:00:24,"let's be honest. She has a book out which you definitely should check out, it's called You Are"
00:00:24,00:00:30,"Not Alone, it's about death but that sounds like it's going to be depressing but it really isn't,"
00:00:30,00:00:35,"it's extremely uplifting that book and there's loads of facts in there as well, it's definitely one"
00:00:35,00:00:41,"that I think you'll really, really enjoy. And the other thing to say is that Kariad does an"
00:00:41,00:00:47,"improvised show called Ostentatious. Now this is a really amazing show, what happens is you turn up,"
00:00:47,00:00:55,"someone in the audience gives them a hitherto lost, let's say, Jane Austen play title that they've"
00:00:55,00:01:01,"made up, the guys have never heard it before and they do an entire Jane Austen play completely"
00:01:01,00:01:06,"improvised. It is absolutely stunningly brilliant, if you haven't seen it you can't miss it, if you"
00:01:06,00:01:10,have seen it go again because it's different every single night and they are about to do
00:01:10,00:01:16,another run at London's West End at the Arts Theatre. Now the best way to find out about those
00:01:16,00:01:25,tickets is to go to ostentatiousimpro.com that's A-U-S-T-E-N-T-A-T-I-O-U-S-I-M-P-R-O.com
00:01:25,00:01:31,"but let's be honest, who types in URLs these days? Just go to a search engine, search for"
00:01:31,00:01:36,ostentatious and you will find all the information there. Anyway really hope you enjoy this week's
00:01:36,00:01:40,"show with Kariad Lloyd, all that's left to say is on with the podcast!"
00:01:40,00:02:02,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast this week"
00:02:02,00:02:05,coming to you live from the Soho Theatre in London!
00:02:08,00:02:13,"My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray and"
00:02:13,00:02:20,Kariad Lloyd and once again we have gathered round the microphones with our four favourite facts
00:02:20,00:02:26,from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go starting with fact number one
00:02:26,00:02:35,and that is Andy. My fact is that the maximum PDF file you can send is bigger than Belgium.
00:02:35,00:02:43,Can we replace Belgium? Just with a PDF?
00:02:43,00:02:49,"Of Belgium, yes you can! Okay in fact it's bigger than that, okay right, the maximum"
00:02:49,00:02:56,"PDF size you can send is the square with size that are 381 kilometres long, that is bigger than"
00:02:56,00:03:02,"Belgium, Monaco, San Marino, Liechtenstein, Malta, Andorra, Luxembourg, Montenegro, Slovenia, Albania"
00:03:02,00:03:10,and Moldova combined. It is huge! It's mega! Has anyone sent something that big?
00:03:10,00:03:20,Unclear! So I worked out that if you wanted to print it out on A4 paper it would take 2.3 trillion
00:03:20,00:03:29,pieces and if I did it on my printer at home I could have started it off at the time when the
00:03:29,00:03:34,first human fossils were appearing in the fossil records and it would be just about finishing now.
00:03:34,00:03:41,"No! Subject to jams and cartridge replacements, that's brilliant, that's so good, I should say"
00:03:41,00:03:45,"where I got this from, I saw a guy called Steve Bobrick put it up on Twitter and basically"
00:03:45,00:03:55,we should say this appears to only be an adobe acrobat limit. Damn them controlling us as always!
00:03:55,00:04:02,Theoretically there could be a bigger PDF out there. So this is what in the adobe rules it says
00:04:02,00:04:06,"that this is the maximum you're allowed or something. Yeah it's the adobe acrobat, it's 15"
00:04:06,00:04:14,"million inches by 15 million inches. It's just the rules, it's not even... No it's their internal"
00:04:14,00:04:19,limit but the file format itself might not be bound by the adobe. They would probably just have
00:04:19,00:04:24,"to click and write 25 million and maybe we'd be able to get even bigger. Maybe, maybe, but I don't"
00:04:24,00:04:28,"think anyone's ever actually sent one that's this big. No, why would you? Why would he be insane?"
00:04:28,00:04:36,"Is that an email attachment or are we talking we transfer here? Oh I think that's a dropbox,"
00:04:36,00:04:48,"I don't think you can we transfer that. So PDFs, pretty dry, pretty dry. It's amazing when we send"
00:04:48,00:04:53,each other our facts round and we have to then go and research them of course and Andy sent us
00:04:53,00:04:59,the PDF and said maybe it's the most boring fact you've ever sent. Yeah and James said it's not
00:04:59,00:05:07,"even close, not even top ten. But I mean we can get on to more general stuff but I do just want to"
00:05:07,00:05:13,"say that adobe, you know adobe acrobat the program that do the PDFs is named after some mud. Named"
00:05:13,00:05:21,after some mud. Adobe it's a building material isn't it? It is. You make it half like poo and wool
00:05:21,00:05:30,I think. Here is mud. James don't attempt poo and wool and be like this is it we can make a house.
00:05:30,00:05:36,That's the worst three little pigs ever isn't it? And the fourth little pig made his house out of
00:05:36,00:05:41,poo and wool. And the wolf said I'm all right actually because you guys you stay in there it's
00:05:41,00:05:47,fine. I should just explain the mud thing sorry I want to call it a year. Because otherwise I could
00:05:47,00:05:50,feel the tension in the room. Or they were waiting they were just desperate to know. When is he going to explain about the mud?
00:05:50,00:05:58,"The founder of adobe, I'm sorry. You thought you cut to live podcast this is a conference for adobe"
00:05:58,00:06:03,and this is how they get their employees in. It's there's a creek which goes past the home
00:06:03,00:06:07,of the founder who's called John Warnock and it has this it has this mud in it it's this very malleable
00:06:07,00:06:12,clay. I did go on a little wild goose chase trying to find out who the original adobe acrobat actually
00:06:12,00:06:20,was. There wasn't one that wasn't right. That would make it an interesting story. Okay and so he named it after
00:06:20,00:06:27,the some mud some mud by the yeah exactly yeah but it's malleable but pdf's are famously inflexible
00:06:27,00:06:32,you're right completely untangible. Are you just like I'm just sending you paper like why did he
00:06:32,00:06:38,think oh yeah this clay this reminds me of mine. An acrobat's so flexible as well. Yeah everything
00:06:38,00:06:43,is completely wide open. The rules the idea that this is what they would say this is the limits
00:06:43,00:06:50,to what you have. I find it kind of funny when there are computer rules that just are just so
00:06:50,00:06:54,makeshift and and sort of seemingly why would you ever say that out loud. Apple three I don't know if
00:06:54,00:07:01,anyone is old enough to remember Apple three but so it was their third. No wait Apple three was the third.
00:07:01,00:07:11,What this is crazy. So yeah it was a it was a hard drive basically that suffered because
00:07:11,00:07:16,there was no fan on it and Steve Jobs had this thing where he just hated the sound of fans
00:07:16,00:07:22,and so he was like let's not include yeah and so it overheated all the time and when it overheated
00:07:22,00:07:26,it meant that any disk going in would suddenly just melt and so you're pulling out the hard drive
00:07:26,00:07:32,disk and so yeah so it was a big big problem and one of the employees of Apple was so angry with
00:07:32,00:07:37,it that he slammed it down out of frustration onto his desk and discovered that that made it work
00:07:37,00:07:43,again so if you called up Apple saying it does not work their official line was lift it up lift
00:07:43,00:07:48,the computer up by two inches and just drop it on the table and that's what fixed it that was the
00:07:48,00:07:52,official line that came from them. Percussive maintenance they call that don't they. What's
00:07:52,00:07:58,that. Just whacking something and hope it works. Oh yeah right yeah yeah. I don't I don't think
00:07:58,00:08:00,we've mentioned this before we might have done. Do you know what the longest a computer has been
00:08:00,00:08:05,left running is or the longest running computer ever. I haven't turned my laptop off since 2016.
00:08:05,00:08:10,Period seven years. You don't need to just rest it's asleep then it wakes up again. Yeah yeah
00:08:10,00:08:14,nothing works. Do you mean not even closing the lid. I reckon this one might not even have a lid.
00:08:14,00:08:22,Whoa. Right. James is right. I didn't and I was about to say the longest like the running computer
00:08:22,00:08:29,on earth but then I didn't say that. Clue. So it's not an earth. That's right. Great.
00:08:29,00:08:36,Is it in a spaceship. It's in a spaceship. Right. It's the Voyager ones. Voyager ones which
00:08:36,00:08:42,have been on since more than 40 years now. The 70s I guess. Yeah since the 70s. And they're still
00:08:42,00:08:47,working. They're still working. It's a pair of link computers on board Voyager which just sent
00:08:47,00:08:51,towards the edge of the solar system and it's still going. Each one has 70 kilobytes of memory.
00:08:51,00:08:55,I mean they're really tiny. Are they like 1970s computers though? They're like old school. They're
00:08:55,00:09:00,not huge. They're not room sized. They're much smaller than that. If they start working they'll
00:09:00,00:09:05,slam them into Pluto aren't they. They've got a big monitor and you have to run like CS DOS on it.
00:09:05,00:09:14,I know some things about computers. They had this really big problem in 2015 because the
00:09:14,00:09:18,last of the original programmers was a guy called Larry Zottarelli and he retired
00:09:18,00:09:23,and they were stuffed because it was like you need to learn ancient cuneiform of computer
00:09:23,00:09:28,languages. Right. To get it. To get this. Like no one is teaching these computer languages. He's
00:09:28,00:09:31,still alive. You're not dead. Just call him up. He's retired. He's old. He's retired. He doesn't
00:09:31,00:09:39,want to be. Get him to write out a handover sheet. People know. I'm sure NASA know about. He's like
00:09:39,00:09:46,no I'm done. That's it. You've had my time. It's hard. It's hard to learn the systems required. No. Okay.
00:09:46,00:09:53,Yeah. All right. There was a computer that analyzed 4000 computer science papers
00:09:53,00:09:57,and it came up with what they call the best computer scientists in the world.
00:09:57,00:10:01,They describe him as the Michael Jordan of computer science. Do you know who it is?
00:10:01,00:10:03,No. It's Michael Jordan.
00:10:03,00:10:11,Is it someone with the same name or is it the answer? Okay. The Michael Jordan of computer
00:10:11,00:10:16,science is Michael Jordan. Call your kids Michael Jordan. That's clear. It's nominative determinism.
00:10:16,00:10:21,Just Michael Jordan. That's really fun. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Do they refer to Michael Jordan
00:10:21,00:10:27,as the Michael Jordan of basketball? Have you had a Fernando Corbato?
00:10:27,00:10:36,I can't tell until you pronounce it properly. I want to be the Fernando Corbato of something.
00:10:37,00:10:43,"Yeah. Well, he was. He was the Fernando Corbato of. He died in 2019. He was 93 years old and he"
00:10:43,00:10:52,"invented something we all have. Oh, and we've got loads of them. Oh, personalities. Daddy issues."
00:11:00,00:11:06,Nudge yourself closer to the topic at hand. I'll go for transistors. No? Passwords.
00:11:06,00:11:10,"Oh, did he? The man who invented the computer password. Always his mother's maiden name."
00:11:10,00:11:18,Michael Jordan. Michael Jordan. But with the numbers changed for the letters. Yeah. I think it was
00:11:18,00:11:21,the 50s that he invented it and it was because most computers worked on one thing at a time because
00:11:21,00:11:26,"they were the size of rooms and they were, you know, they had processing power but not much and"
00:11:26,00:11:30,he was trying to work out a way like a timeshare system so lots of people could work on the
00:11:30,00:11:34,"same computer different tasks, you know. And so he just reasoned that that's the best way of hiding"
00:11:34,00:11:39,your files from each other inside the computer. Wow. And I've entered that. Yeah. In 2003.
00:11:39,00:11:46,"That is, you're right. It was a sexy fact. But the thing is we don't whistle at facts anymore."
00:11:46,00:11:54,"Well, wait, I mean. It's just, it's not okay. I'm sorry. I don't want to be a downer."
00:11:54,00:12:02,"Actually, Cariad, it made me feel empowered. There's always one working against the movement."
00:12:02,00:12:10,"What can I say? In 2003, a survey found that 90% of office workers passing through Waterloo"
00:12:10,00:12:17,Station would give away their computer password in exchange for a biro. Just a biro? Not even a
00:12:17,00:12:21,"chocolate? Well, another one. Another survey in 2003 found that 70% of people would do it in exchange"
00:12:21,00:12:27,for some chocolate. 100%. 34% of people just gave their password without even needing the bribe.
00:12:27,00:12:32,So what's your password? They just told them. That's so good. That was in the past when you
00:12:32,00:12:37,"you only needed like four, right? Yeah. There's no way you can even remember them. Yeah. That's"
00:12:37,00:12:44,amazing. I got a quick story about a Microsoft laptop that there was a mystery. It kept crashing.
00:12:44,00:12:50,This is 2005. So the culprit of the problem was Janet Jackson.
00:12:50,00:12:56,Is it the real Janet Jackson? The real Janet Jackson. And it was her song Rhythm Nation.
00:12:56,00:13:04,And what it was is that the frequency of it was at such the same level of which the disk was spinning
00:13:04,00:13:09,that it would send the disk into a wobble and it would crash. And even if Rhythm Nation was playing
00:13:09,00:13:15,"from one laptop but being heard by another laptop, that would crash as well. Like Dogwist or just"
00:13:15,00:13:20,"be like, is it me? Yeah, yeah, exactly. So it was, yeah. So Janet Jackson was responsible for a"
00:13:20,00:13:25,whole software update or whatever of a Microsoft laptop. She's constantly innovating. She is.
00:13:25,00:13:33,"You, do you know the, you won't know this, but can you guess the picture? What is it? What is it?"
00:13:33,00:13:38,"We need more. We need more. That was almost a sentence, but not quite. Sorry, sorry, sorry."
00:13:38,00:13:44,"So the picture, which has the most pixels in it. So the image that has the most pixels in the world"
00:13:44,00:13:54,"has 102 terapixels. Okay. Security, security. No, no, come on now. It feels nice, doesn't it?"
00:13:54,00:13:59,"No, no, that did not feel nice. That was, that fact was just minding its own business."
00:13:59,00:14:05,"Okay, get ready to whistle. Can you guess what the picture is of? Belgium."
00:14:07,00:14:12,"Is it like Tetris, just to give you a t-shirt? Or is it like very pixelated?"
00:14:12,00:14:17,"No, it's, it's pixelated in the fact that it has a lot of pixels in it. It's not like,"
00:14:17,00:14:20,"oh, okay, okay. But basically, if you made it really small, it would be really clear. That's"
00:14:20,00:14:26,"the point. I'll say a big telescope thing like the universe. Mona Lisa. Oh gosh, no, it is the world's"
00:14:26,00:14:33,"biggest penis. Wow. Well, welcome to the whistle. This is your perfect partner. Wait, do you mean"
00:14:33,00:14:38,"it's the world's biggest picture of a penis or the world's biggest penis? Clarify, we need that."
00:14:38,00:14:43,"It's a picture of a normal sized penis, but it's the world's biggest image. And what's a normal size"
00:14:43,00:14:52,"penis? Just asking for a friend. So many issues. If they, if they made each pixel one inch. That's"
00:14:52,00:15:01,"not a normal sized penis. That also wasn't really an inch, but we'll not go into that. If you made"
00:15:01,00:15:08,"each pixel an inch, it would wrap around the earth 2.7 times this image. And if you,"
00:15:08,00:15:20,"if you are printed it out to the same specs as a billboard, it would be as tall as 16,408"
00:15:20,00:15:25,"Empire State buildings. And if you 3D printed that, you would be able to poke the International"
00:15:25,00:15:34,Space Station. And you need permission before you do that. Okay. It was invented by a former NASA
00:15:34,00:15:49,"intern who does not wish to be identified. We need to move on to our next act, guys. It is time for"
00:15:49,00:15:56,"fact number two. And that is Kariat. During the 17th century, when you died, your relatives were"
00:15:56,00:16:02,"legally forced to bury you wearing wool, whether you liked it or not. And there was for no other"
00:16:02,00:16:10,reason than to support the ailing wool industry. I love this fact. Okay. So basically there was
00:16:10,00:16:18,an act by parliament in 1666 that overnight said everybody has to be buried in wool. And it sounds
00:16:18,00:16:22,"like, oh, okay. But previously to that, nobody was buried in wool ever. Ever. That was like an"
00:16:22,00:16:28,"unusual thing to happen. You were buried in a linen shroud like Jesus in the Bible. And no coffin,"
00:16:28,00:16:32,"no coffin, right? Sometimes they did have coffins. Sometimes they had coffins. It was unusual."
00:16:32,00:16:36,But it was very unusual. You would mostly be wrapped in a shroud and just shoved in the earth.
00:16:36,00:16:42,"And because the wool industry was so important, and they were so worried about linen coming from"
00:16:42,00:16:50,"France, basically, classic fucking French linen coming over here taking our coffins. The government"
00:16:50,00:16:59,"basically said, I know. It was your GB news show coming on. Listen, the British wool. I am sweating,"
00:16:59,00:17:05,"but I am British. So many people employed in the wool industry, 12% of the population worked in"
00:17:05,00:17:10,"the wool industry. And it brought in a huge amount of money. So they said, well, we'll just make it"
00:17:10,00:17:15,"a law that you have to be buried in a wool suit in a coffin lined with wool. And if you weren't,"
00:17:15,00:17:23,"you will find five pounds, which is the equivalent of 550 pounds today. So basically,"
00:17:23,00:17:27,"initially, everyone was like, no, fuck you. Where are we going to get this from? No one has"
00:17:27,00:17:32,this. We have a history of this. And the linens they used to wrap them in would be your family
00:17:32,00:17:36,"linen. So you would have something that has been like a tablecloth, and you would keep it all night,"
00:17:36,00:17:39,and then you would sew them together. The women would sew it together and wrap everybody up.
00:17:39,00:17:45,So it's like a very nice thing. And so people weren't following the law. So then they made it
00:17:45,00:17:50,that you had to go to the keeper of the peace. Two members of your family had to sign an affidavit
00:17:50,00:17:55,"saying, we have done this, otherwise you'd be fine. So you had to go to the church and swear,"
00:17:55,00:17:59,"like based on the Bible, we buried them in wool, sorry. Yeah, there was an oath you had to read,"
00:17:59,00:18:05,"right? Yeah, a special oath, which I've got here saying, no corpse or any person, except any person"
00:18:05,00:18:11,that shall die of the plague. Fuck them. That's because they thought it lived on in the wool.
00:18:11,00:18:16,"Shall be buried in any shift sheet or shroud or anything whatsoever made or mingled with flax,"
00:18:16,00:18:22,"hemp, silk, hair, gold, or silver in any stuff or thing other than what is made of sheep's wool"
00:18:22,00:18:28,"only. That's a name how to say that. But the fine that you mentioned, the five pound fine,"
00:18:28,00:18:33,"if you grasped someone up as being buried in non-wool, then you could get half of the five"
00:18:33,00:18:40,pounds. Yeah. And this is the really clever thing. If you had buried your relative in Lennon and you
00:18:40,00:18:45,"knew that you were likely to be caught anyway, you could go and grasp up on your own relative,"
00:18:45,00:18:50,"get a half the fine, back into the family, you've only paid half the fine. Did they do that? Yeah,"
00:18:50,00:18:54,"they did. So rich people did that. So some people who like, there were certain areas where it was"
00:18:54,00:18:58,"very much didn't, they didn't approve of it. And so rich people would be like, well fuck you. Well,"
00:18:58,00:19:03,you said that like one of the rules was you couldn't bury in gold. Yeah. So I think if you're
00:19:03,00:19:09,"burying someone in gold, probably you can afford the five pounds. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Exactly."
00:19:09,00:19:15,"So there was a study that was done between 1678 and 1707, less than one percent, and this was in"
00:19:15,00:19:20,"Henstridge. Yes. Less than one percent of burials in the churchyard were in Lennon, so following this"
00:19:20,00:19:26,"rule. But then when you went inside the church itself, it was between nine and 13 percent that"
00:19:26,00:19:32,"were then rich people in the church. Yeah, yeah, exactly. One interesting part of this is that,"
00:19:32,00:19:37,"okay, so you started to have loads more extra linen and extra cloth around because you were"
00:19:37,00:19:44,using the wool for the burials. And newspapers were made out of recycled cloth. So that's why
00:19:44,00:19:48,"you call that a rag now, because they used to use the rags, turn into newspaper and then make"
00:19:48,00:19:53,"newspapers. And so they had all of these extra bits of linen, which meant they could make more"
00:19:53,00:19:58,newspapers. And there was a huge boom of newspapers around that time. And this sort of fed into that.
00:19:59,00:20:03,"They were pleased about it. Everyone else was pissed off. And there's an amazing, have you"
00:20:03,00:20:08,"heard of Deca Mittford? And I've talked to you guys about her before. Yeah, one of the Jessica"
00:20:08,00:20:14,Mittford sisters who were like these socialite 20th century British figures who were involved in
00:20:14,00:20:18,"every single thing that happened. She went to America, she was a communist, she went to America,"
00:20:18,00:20:23,"kind of disowned her family. In the 60s, she wrote this book called An American Way of Death."
00:20:23,00:20:28,"Okay. It was like, it's very odd because she was a British socialite that had like gone to fight"
00:20:28,00:20:32,in Spain and then moved to America. Very unusual story. But the book that she wrote basically
00:20:32,00:20:37,changed the American funeral industry. Because what was happening was they were just basically
00:20:37,00:20:42,"rinsing people for money. And when someone died, they used to kind of perform plastic surgery on"
00:20:42,00:20:47,"them and then barmed them and so make them look, I mean, or she describes like basically nip and"
00:20:47,00:20:51,"tuck the tissue across the body with implants, pins and fillers to mask blemishes and swellings"
00:20:51,00:20:55,that come with age and illness before sowing the face into the most attractive and youthful
00:20:55,00:21:00,"expression possible. Sewing it. Teeth were whitened, makeup applied and the corpse was"
00:21:00,00:21:07,"dressed in its final outfit. Yes, I would like all of this. There was a special kind of bra"
00:21:07,00:21:14,designed for post-mortem form restoration. I'll pass on that. So she wrote this book exposing...
00:21:14,00:21:21,"Why is Andy in a bra? It was part of the package. She wrote this amazing book that exposed,"
00:21:21,00:21:24,basically they were they were preying on the vulnerable. So these poor people who had no
00:21:24,00:21:29,money would end up paying like thousands of dollars for what was considered like a proper funeral.
00:21:29,00:21:33,And her book was like in the bestsellers for years. David Bowie listed it as one of his favorite
00:21:33,00:21:38,"ever books, top 100 books because she changed everything. And they were putting so many chemicals"
00:21:38,00:21:42,in at that time. It was so dangerous. And that's why like funeral makers were dying of cancer from
00:21:42,00:21:48,inhaling on the formaldehyde. Grim. There's one kind of fun thing they used to do. I bought it
00:21:48,00:21:55,"down. Bring us back to the fun stuff. This is in ancient Roman funerals. You could pay an actor,"
00:21:55,00:22:00,"and a lot of people did this, you would pay an actor to dress up and wear a mask as the person"
00:22:00,00:22:07,who died. Yes. And then in the party they'd kind of mingle with everyone. Yes. Pretending that they
00:22:07,00:22:13,"were still alive and like parodying the things that they did. Oh wait, is it... I don't want to"
00:22:13,00:22:19,"be parodied, but I would love someone to be doing some of my good stuff. I'd even write some lines"
00:22:19,00:22:24,"for them to... I think that's a great idea. Andy at a funeral. I know. Some dude walking around going,"
00:22:24,00:22:30,"""Did you know the largest PDF I'm ever..."" Thank God, thank God, thank God he died."
00:22:30,00:22:38,"That's amazing. Look, wool. I'm sorry, bring me back to wool. We went after death."
00:22:38,00:22:43,Wool is an amazing material. It's like a super substance that I had no idea about. Have you
00:22:43,00:22:50,not heard of wool before now? I didn't know how good wool was basically. So it's covered in scales.
00:22:50,00:22:54,"If you look, if you zoom in, you look at it with the microscope, it's covered in scales. So liquid"
00:22:54,00:22:58,"water slides off the outside, right? So it's very hydrophobic, I guess, so it's good at protecting"
00:22:58,00:23:06,"you from water, but it not absorbs, it adsorbs water easily, right? So if you have water vapor"
00:23:06,00:23:11,"in here, it kind of makes its way into the wool, like underneath the scales. So once the water"
00:23:11,00:23:17,"gets in, that keeps you nicely cool, for example. Wait, so sorry, it's pushing off water. It pushes"
00:23:17,00:23:23,"off liquid water, but it takes in water vapor, okay? So you try to wear a wool jumper in summer,"
00:23:23,00:23:28,"and then winter as well. Oh, sorry, yeah, yeah. It releases heat, so that can also warm you up,"
00:23:28,00:23:31,even if it's got water vapor inside it. So that's the way of keeping you warm. So if you fall in a
00:23:31,00:23:38,"river that's freezing cold, and then you get to dry land, be wearing wool. Like, don't wear cotton"
00:23:38,00:23:43,"if you've done that. Right. Basically, because you'll be much less harmed if you're wearing wool,"
00:23:43,00:23:49,"which has repelled the outside water, it's not wet on the inside. That's a top tip. Yeah. It's a top"
00:23:49,00:23:55,"tip. If there's two of you on like a raft, and only one of you can stay on the raft, the one who's"
00:23:55,00:24:00,"wearing wool gets pushed in, is what you're saying. Yeah, exactly. Right. Don't be on a raft with"
00:24:00,00:24:05,"James. They've invented a new kind of sheep this year, that's exciting. A new kind of sheep. They've"
00:24:05,00:24:10,"bred a multifunctional sheep for the first time, which is very exciting. Okay, let's go for the"
00:24:10,00:24:15,"functions. Does it do your diary, organise it on a cook? It just does wool and meat, basically."
00:24:15,00:24:20,But that's new. And have the two been mutually exclusive before that? I think this is the most
00:24:20,00:24:26,multifunctional sheep they've ever come up with. Wow. The sheep three. It's a sheep three. Is it
00:24:26,00:24:32,"not working? Just drop it. Drop it from a short height. Well, yeah, that's incredible. I knew"
00:24:32,00:24:38,"sheep. That's amazing. Oh, I saw an amazing picture online, which I want to go see in person. If you"
00:24:38,00:24:43,"go to which museum is it? I think it's in the Science Museum. Yeah, it's a Science Museum."
00:24:43,00:24:49,"There's a jumper there made of wool, which is on display. Can you guess why the Science Museum"
00:24:49,00:24:55,"would have a notable jumper of wool? Knitted by expedition. That's good. No, no. So it's not"
00:24:55,00:25:00,been to the North Pole? Not been to the North Pole. Knitted by Einstein. Knitted by some famous
00:25:00,00:25:06,scientist. No. What's their famous sheep? Dolly. Dolly's jumper. There we go. It is wool from the
00:25:06,00:25:12,"first mammal ever cloned, Dolly. The sheared wool turned into a jumper. And they've only made one."
00:25:12,00:25:20,"Idiots. Yeah. And it's got sheep on it. It's really beautiful. That's not beautiful, but it's, you"
00:25:20,00:25:26,"know, it's a bit cartoony. Pretty cool though, isn't it? It's very cool. The wool industry was so"
00:25:26,00:25:32,important for Britain that they had to do loads of laws for it. So there was this thing with the
00:25:32,00:25:36,"burials. But there was another thing where they tried to get rid of all the wolves, because obviously"
00:25:36,00:25:43,"the wolves were killing the sheep. So Edward I paid one guy, Peter Corbett, to destroy all the wolves"
00:25:43,00:25:50,"in Britain, which he managed. We don't have any wolves anymore. Hey, what are you up to? I'm just"
00:25:50,00:25:56,killing all the wolves in Britain. And William the Conqueror would grant land to people in North
00:25:56,00:26:01,umberland and Cumberland on the condition that they would defend the land from any wolves and any
00:26:01,00:26:09,"Scotsman. It was mean putting them second in the list. Did you know, I'm sure you knew, it's about"
00:26:09,00:26:17,the wool sack that is in the House of Parliament. It looks like a sort of giant cushion called the
00:26:17,00:26:23,"wool sack, and it's where the Lord Speaker sits. And that was introduced by some, I had it written"
00:26:23,00:26:27,"down, I've lost it, some king, basically a long time ago, to commemorate how important the wool"
00:26:27,00:26:31,"trade is. And now it's stuffed with wool, a blended wool from Britain and the other wool"
00:26:31,00:26:36,"producing nations of the Commonwealth, the ones we stole. Common wolf more like."
00:26:37,00:26:46,"He's a slow hand clap. It didn't feel empowering. I didn't feel. No, just on the wool sack, they,"
00:26:46,00:26:51,"I think that it was, it's centuries old, it's really, really old. And in 1938, they opened it up"
00:26:51,00:26:56,"and they found out, oh, it's horse hair, completely full of horse hair, full of wool."
00:26:56,00:27:04,"Scandal, that is. So now they filled it with the Commonwealth wool. Do you know where we almost"
00:27:04,00:27:09,"had wool? Where? It's such a, like, on our bodies. Do you mean like humans used to have? On our bodies,"
00:27:09,00:27:18,"yes. The legs. No. The arms. No. Running short. The teeth, the teeth woman. No, no, inside the body."
00:27:18,00:27:27,"Yes. Oh. What? How drunk are we? We used to have some kind of... No, no, no, we didn't use to, we"
00:27:27,00:27:35,"almost had. Didn't we almost have the wool inside? We almost had wool in our, in our, in our livers,"
00:27:35,00:27:44,"lungs, hearts. Boobies. We almost had woolen boobies. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary"
00:27:44,00:27:50,"evidence there. So, in the 1950s, there was a lot of experiments going on. In the 1950s? Yeah,"
00:27:50,00:27:56,"there were... We didn't get boobs in the 1950s as a species. Oh, we did, we did. But what we did have"
00:27:56,00:28:00,"was plastic surgery, where people were having their breasts enhanced, and there were many materials"
00:28:00,00:28:04,that were tested out as what we would be using for breast... That is an itchy tits.
00:28:04,00:28:15,"You do get itchy tits. If that is made of wool, that is... Itchy on the inside. Oh, that's... They"
00:28:15,00:28:21,"tried wool? They tried wool. They tried sponges. They tried ivory balls. They tried ivory. Yeah,"
00:28:21,00:28:25,they tried a lot of stuff. And then eventually it was the silicon implants that they worked in.
00:28:25,00:28:29,"Sponges, so you could maybe decrease and increase them, depending on how much water you put."
00:28:29,00:28:34,"Yeah, yeah. Sounds good. Anyway, I need to move us on to our next fact. Do you want to say one more"
00:28:34,00:28:39,"thing before we do? Well, I was just going to talk about the wool factories that we had. So,"
00:28:39,00:28:44,"a lot of the wool factories in the north, they would have families who basically lived in the"
00:28:44,00:28:48,"shadow of them, and the factories would kind of look after them, feed them. They would go to"
00:28:48,00:28:53,"church with the factory owners, all that kind of stuff. And I was reading about one called the"
00:28:53,00:29:00,"Fox's Woolen Mill. They invented khaki, the stuff that you... The khaki? The thing you used to get"
00:29:00,00:29:06,"into your car. Yeah, yeah. Oh, that's not what I thought you said, sorry. No, the khaki material."
00:29:06,00:29:14,"Cool. And they said that the children would get free woolen clothing, and they would be sewn into"
00:29:14,00:29:22,"their woolen underwear in September, and then let out again in May. Wow. I think they must have had"
00:29:22,00:29:27,"an opening. Yeah, there's an engineering problem there. I think so. Wow. But yeah, imagine that."
00:29:27,00:29:33,Put a tube in. You stay warm. Yeah. But being sewn into your underwear for six months of the year.
00:29:33,00:29:37,Living Newton-John was sewn into those trousers in Greece. That's true. And they had to unpick her
00:29:37,00:29:42,"every time she needed to. There was a story, wasn't there, that Franz Ferdinand, when he was shot,"
00:29:42,00:29:48,"he'd been sewn into his uniform and... You had the band. The band. I was like, what? They're going,"
00:29:48,00:30:04,"take me out. Take me out. It is time for fact number three, and that is my fact. My fact this week"
00:30:04,00:30:11,"is that in 1914, women were only allowed to visit the Natural History Museum if a man agreed to"
00:30:11,00:30:19,"sign a note promising that they would behave themselves. So this is, yeah, this is, as I say,"
00:30:19,00:30:25,"1914. I got this fact, by the way, from Dr. Fern Riddell. She's a historian. She's written in books"
00:30:25,00:30:30,about suffragettes and the history of sex and all that sort. She's brilliant. You can find her on
00:30:30,00:30:36,"Twitter. And she put up this link, which was for one of the museums by an author called Kerry"
00:30:36,00:30:42,"Lotzvaz. And it was the story of suffragettes. And during 1912 to 1914, there was so much damage"
00:30:42,00:30:48,"that was going on in the name of trying to get their message out, much the way that we see modern"
00:30:48,00:30:53,"protesting, that they would take... They would do quite sort of big acts when they are destroying"
00:30:53,00:30:58,things. And museums were a particular target. And so museums basically had to shut down for a while.
00:30:58,00:31:04,You had to go by appointment in some cases. But women specifically had a note that was
00:31:04,00:31:09,"presented to a man, and they would have to hand in at the door, that then gave them access. And"
00:31:09,00:31:14,"if they did damage something, the man would be liable for the damage that they did. And the woman."
00:31:14,00:31:22,"Honestly. Yeah, it was wild, wasn't it? The Natural History Museums weren't sure exactly what they might"
00:31:22,00:31:27,"target. The head of the museum said that unless explosives are used, the large mammals are not"
00:31:27,00:31:33,likely to suffer very seriously. But they were bombing things at the time. So there was a chance
00:31:33,00:31:36,"they might... If I know, they're not worried about women's rights. They're like, ""Fucking hell, those"
00:31:36,00:31:42,"elephants. They need protecting."" Well, they were mostly bothered about the coral. Apparently."
00:31:42,00:31:48,"Famously. Order of priorities. Men, coral, women. But it was such a big deal. Lloyds of London actually"
00:31:48,00:31:53,"started issuing householders comprehensive insurance policies that covered damages by airplanes,"
00:31:53,00:31:59,"riots and suffragettes. No. That was part of your insurance. As a woman, you did go to a museum."
00:31:59,00:32:04,"You had to surrender your parcels, your muff and your umbrella at the door. Because all they were"
00:32:04,00:32:11,"all used to conceal objects you... Well, the suffragettes, they actually... The suffragettes"
00:32:11,00:32:16,came out saying that we're going to put hammers in our muffs. You'd be amazed what some women can do.
00:32:16,00:32:24,"""Must Hammer"" is a good, cool nickname for a suffragette, isn't it? WWE Muff Hammer."
00:32:25,00:32:32,Making her way to the ring. She's got a note from her husband. But he hasn't signed it!
00:32:32,00:32:40,"Oh, also, we should all be saying suffragettes. Oh, really? Because they were very, very initially."
00:32:40,00:32:45,"Well, the word was coined by a newspaper writer, and they were originally referred to as suffragettes,"
00:32:45,00:32:49,"because... And they took it on because they said, ""We're going to get the vote."" It was the Daily Mail."
00:32:50,00:32:54,"The Daily Mail coined the word ""suffragette"" where everyone's... But as a slam of a word?"
00:32:54,00:32:59,"It was a slam, because they were not the nice ones. Distinguished from the women's social and"
00:32:59,00:33:04,political union. The suffragists were the ones who were being peaceful campaigners. But then it
00:33:04,00:33:08,"became like, ""Yeah, we are suffragettes. Fuck you."" Yeah, yeah. Just on the museums, just one last thing."
00:33:08,00:33:14,"The assistant keeper of the National Portrait Gallery, who was called James Milner,"
00:33:14,00:33:19,"said that if women are to be admitted into public galleries, there seems to be no alternative,"
00:33:19,00:33:26,"but to handcuff their hands behind their backs, and to put up a grill in front of all the pictures"
00:33:26,00:33:34,to stop them headbutting them. Sensible policies for a safer Britain. Wow. Wow. Isn't that amazing?
00:33:34,00:33:38,"So depressing. Yes, they really, really got up people's noses, I think is what they're saying."
00:33:38,00:33:43,"That's one word for it. Do you know that? Yeah. Emily Wilding Davidson. Yeah. Davidson,"
00:33:43,00:33:48,"the one who threw herself under the King's horse, so famously... She was the first human casualty."
00:33:48,00:33:53,"I was reading about her, and she was actually super violent, and had been for a very long time,"
00:33:53,00:33:57,"was throwing rocks. She kept trying to throw rocks at Lloyd George, but kept mistaking someone."
00:33:57,00:34:03,"And she was so violent that Pankhurst was like, ""Get her out. This is too much. We think she's"
00:34:03,00:34:07,"going to do something nuts."" Yeah, because she was just attacking people, throwing herself at people."
00:34:07,00:34:11,"Because they all did jiu-jitsu, didn't they? They were trained in jiu-jitsu by one of the suffragettes,"
00:34:11,00:34:16,"Edith Garrard. Garrard led the teaching, because she knew how to do jiu-jitsu."
00:34:17,00:34:21,"And the idea behind the training was that appointed bodyguards would surround leaders,"
00:34:21,00:34:25,"like the Pankhurst, basically, so that they had people in front of them to do jiu-jitsu."
00:34:25,00:34:28,But they also had big wooden clubs concealed about their person.
00:34:28,00:34:33,"In their muff hammers. Well, I don't know. Like, no muff is big enough to hide these clubs."
00:34:33,00:34:35,"They had to hide them in their dressers. Oh, baby, you don't know!"
00:34:35,00:34:43,I was reading about the slow pace of female emancipation. Just that Saudi Arabia gave women
00:34:43,00:34:50,"the right to vote in 2015, leaving Vatican City as the only place where women's suffrage is still"
00:34:50,00:34:56,"denied today. Right. Yeah. Well, Switzerland only got it in 1991 as the whole country."
00:34:56,00:35:03,So it was 1971 that the country had universal suffrage. But all the cantons were allowed to vote
00:35:03,00:35:06,"on it themselves. And they're like the sort of counties. They're like the counties, yeah. But"
00:35:06,00:35:10,"they have a lot of things that they can kind of decide by themselves. And there was one canton,"
00:35:10,00:35:18,"the Appenzell in a Holden canton, that voted against women's suffrage in '73, '82 and 1990."
00:35:18,00:35:24,"Fucking hell. Come on, canton. Get with it. I know. And the thing is, it's slightly weird,"
00:35:24,00:35:28,"because the way that they vote there, they don't like going to a voting booth. They all go into"
00:35:28,00:35:36,"the town hall square and kind of shout. Fuck women! I said it 15 years ago, and I stand by it!"
00:35:38,00:35:44,"Shut up, Sandra! Yeah. And then in 1991, the federal government had to step in and say,"
00:35:44,00:35:48,"look, this is the rule, guys. Guys, you're embarrassing us. You're an embarrassing uncle."
00:35:48,00:35:51,It's getting really embarrassing. Have you heard of the board game Suffragetto?
00:35:51,00:35:59,"No. Have you heard of the board game Pankersquith? Yeah, they came out roughly at the same time."
00:35:59,00:36:04,"Really? Yeah, yeah. What's yours? My one is a game whereby it kind of looks like a chessboard,"
00:36:04,00:36:08,"and you have all these pieces, and on one side, you're team Suffragette, and then the other side,"
00:36:08,00:36:14,"you're team police, and you need to get as many... I want this game. This sounds amazing. Yeah, well,"
00:36:14,00:36:18,"there's only one remaining copy of it, and it's in the Bodleian Library. I'm going to go with my"
00:36:18,00:36:24,"Marfan Steelem, before I headbutt a painting. I think you used to be able to, like, download,"
00:36:24,00:36:28,"I was going to say PDFs, but I think you could, like, download the board and stuff."
00:36:28,00:36:33,"Oh, yeah, right, cool. Yeah, but Pankersquith, because it was Asquith, the Prime Minister?"
00:36:33,00:36:37,"It was the Prime Minister at the time, and this was 1909, and it was a board game."
00:36:37,00:36:41,"You had to get across the board and avoid arrest. It was the same kind of premise. Yeah, yeah."
00:36:41,00:36:47,"But the violence of the Suffragette movement was part of this game of suffragetto, because"
00:36:47,00:36:52,"if you caught one of the suffragettes, they went to prison, and if you caught one of the policemen,"
00:36:52,00:36:59,"they went to hospital. Yes. Yeah. And this was made by the suffragettes, I think, the board game?"
00:36:59,00:37:03,"Yeah, so it was their own issued game. They had a lot of merch. They had a load of merch."
00:37:03,00:37:08,Women love merch. We'll buy a tote bag. We don't care what's on it. We do not care.
00:37:08,00:37:12,"What other merch did they have? Oh, they had sort of scarves, and they had badges, and they had"
00:37:12,00:37:15,"lots of postcards. Well, the colours, the big thing was the purple one, and then they put that on"
00:37:15,00:37:19,"jewellery, as well, and you'd have it on rings, and it was like a secret. You could wear the colours"
00:37:19,00:37:22,"separately, and everyone would be like, ""Oh, I know what you vote for."" That was one of the things"
00:37:22,00:37:30,"of the, at the 2012 Olympics, they had a suffragette display as part of the opening ceremony,"
00:37:30,00:37:37,and someone came out as Emily Davison wearing the purple sash that was Emily Davison's. That's
00:37:37,00:37:42,"the genuine article. Yeah, which is pretty cool. We should probably say there is a bit of a debate"
00:37:42,00:37:48,"about whether suffragette tactics won the day in the end, because they suspended all militant"
00:37:48,00:37:52,"activities at the start of the First World War, and then by the end of the war, women were so"
00:37:52,00:37:57,"integrated in industry, factories, all of that. Are you saying war's good? Is that where there's"
00:37:57,00:38:06,"going? Or are you saying the suffragettes are bad? Yeah. Which one, Andy? Because the live audience"
00:38:06,00:38:10,"and the people listening at home would like to know. Well, actually, I'm probably saying both."
00:38:10,00:38:18,"Welcome to GB News. But no, there is a debate, isn't there? Well, like, it did actually,"
00:38:18,00:38:21,"actually did they achieve anything, because they made themselves very, very hated at the time,"
00:38:21,00:38:25,"and then the impression was that by the end of the war, that women were just so much more"
00:38:25,00:38:28,into society. But then would that have happened without them doing that movement in the first
00:38:28,00:38:32,"phase? I don't know, yeah. It would have been four long years. Yeah, yeah. But it's definitely like,"
00:38:32,00:38:35,"the tosses argue, isn't it? The tosses argue. Can I quickly, just speaking of people hiding"
00:38:35,00:38:40,"things in their muffs, it just reminded me of my favourite headline of all time."
00:38:40,00:38:47,"So the author, Cormac McCarthy, died earlier this year, and it was a headline that I saw years ago."
00:38:47,00:38:51,"This is the headline. So he only just makes a cameo, and this is not really to do with him."
00:38:51,00:38:58,Cormac McCarthy's ex-wife pulls gun from vagina during argument over aliens.
00:38:58,00:39:04,"Tell me you're clicking on that link immediately. The Daily Telegraph has changed, hasn't it?"
00:39:04,00:39:10,"What was that? Where was that? It was in a newspaper. Oh, great. Yeah."
00:39:10,00:39:15,"In Iraq. Yeah, by Vince Mancini. In Iraq. Yeah."
00:39:15,00:39:18,"Check this out. Anyway, yeah, I've been wanting to say that for years on this podcast."
00:39:18,00:39:31,"Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is James. Okay, my fact this week is that"
00:39:31,00:39:38,a designer from Indonesia who recycles cow dung has found a way to make stools from stools.
00:39:41,00:39:48,"Very nice. Thank you. Yeah, it's just a joke that stools and stools are the same thing,"
00:39:48,00:39:53,"but this is a thing that happened. This was a display from the last Singapore Design Week,"
00:39:53,00:39:58,which I read about. It's all about upcycling. So they made lighting from old washing machine
00:39:58,00:40:05,"pipes. They made rugs from dog hair. And this guy called Adhi Nugraha has his team, basically,"
00:40:05,00:40:11,at his university has taken this dung. They remove the water. That gets rid of the smell.
00:40:11,00:40:15,They add a load of wood glue and stuff like that. And then they mould it into
00:40:15,00:40:19,"into anything you want. You can get speakers, you can get stools, you can get flower pots,"
00:40:19,00:40:27,"all sorts. It's a very cool thing. It's a good way of recycling poo. A lot of it is burned,"
00:40:27,00:40:31,"isn't it? Cow dung in India, which is really bad for the environment. I mean, cows themselves are"
00:40:31,00:40:35,"very bad for the environment. And the dung, like it's full of methane and it just burning it,"
00:40:35,00:40:40,"just a bad idea. But it can be used to coat walls. Yeah, that's another thing. Adobe, for instance."
00:40:40,00:40:47,"Yeah. Adobe. Poo and wool combined. Well, so I was reading a thing about astronaut poo and what"
00:40:47,00:40:53,"it might be used for for. Oh, yeah. And this is an exciting development. So it might be in future"
00:40:53,00:40:58,that astronauts are able to power their own spaceship using polymers from their own poo.
00:40:58,00:41:04,"So that's thrilling, as in you can send astronauts to Mars and be like, make your own way home."
00:41:05,00:41:10,"When you hear some fruit and fiber. Yeah, exactly. Six months. And the other thing is they might be"
00:41:10,00:41:15,"able to grow their own. This is a bit is a bit of a growth factor, but trying to disregard it. So"
00:41:15,00:41:24,they might be able to grow their own food from control. No one's ready. There were scientists
00:41:24,00:41:29,"at Pennsylvania in 2017. They researched this thing, a bio reactor, right? So you effectively,"
00:41:29,00:41:38,you poo in the tube and then the tube tube. That's a good name for it. That's actually going
00:41:38,00:41:43,"to make it much more palatable to people, I think. And it produces gas. It sort of gives off various"
00:41:43,00:41:50,"biological gases and that fuels a microbial goo. Oh, God, that's the worst word you've used so far."
00:41:50,00:41:56,"We were all on board until microbial goo. Be squeamish. Microbial goo, chief."
00:41:57,00:42:02,"They create a reactor and the good news, good or bad news, as I suppose it works."
00:42:02,00:42:07,"And so that. So what is the reaction? Is it power or is it, what are they getting out of it?"
00:42:07,00:42:11,"This is to produce the Vegemite like microbial goo. Oh, you're going to eat it."
00:42:11,00:42:16,"You're not, and I should stress, you're not eating anything that you have. It's completely"
00:42:16,00:42:20,"safe. You're filtering. It's like, it's all filtration. If I go to a restaurant, I don't want"
00:42:20,00:42:27,"others to go, it is completely safe. Yes, it was once your ship, but it's not anymore. People change."
00:42:27,00:42:32,"I thought as well, when you said about spearing stuff on walls, I thought that was a thing that"
00:42:32,00:42:35,they were talking about deep space exploration. Because one of the problems that you have when
00:42:35,00:42:40,you're flying further into space is that you go into these radiation bands where suddenly
00:42:40,00:42:44,you're just getting smashed by it. And if you put poo all over your walls.
00:42:44,00:42:48,"Outside of the spaceship. Oh, is it on the outside? I believe so."
00:42:48,00:42:51,"Who's doing that? I thought it was on the inside. Yeah, who's, who's"
00:42:51,00:42:54,who's going outside? You can go on a spacewalk. You can go on a spacewalk.
00:42:54,00:42:57,What is your son doing at NASA again?
00:42:57,00:43:05,"Peanuts, PDFs, actually. Just tell them Arthur, you smear shit on the outside of a spaceship,"
00:43:05,00:43:13,"and we should be proud of him. Jesus Christ. You can imagine slowly, you're sort of like 30 years"
00:43:13,00:43:17,into an intergalactic mission. You're outside your spaceship. You're smearing your laided
00:43:17,00:43:22,"batch of shit on the outside guy. They're taking the fucking piss, aren't they?"
00:43:22,00:43:26,"I should have done that drama degree, man. It's like, it's just not worth it."
00:43:26,00:43:30,"I was saying, you're the fucking muffin. Go to space, they said. See the universe, they said."
00:43:30,00:43:37,"I like the usual way it was on the inside. That was normal. You were like, yeah, yeah,"
00:43:37,00:43:41,"living in like a shit hole. Well, it makes more sense. Should we,"
00:43:41,00:43:44,"been going on a spacewalk to smear shit all over your ship? Yeah, I think it does."
00:43:45,00:43:51,"I can just imagine NASA checking in with you, Dan, a few months into the mission."
00:43:51,00:43:56,"Sorry, sorry, astronaut Shriver. We lost control and have you been..."
00:43:56,00:44:05,"Okay, send him home. Send him home. All right, astronaut Shriver, you're going to need to"
00:44:05,00:44:10,"turn your entire spaceship inside out. No, Dan, you need to poo into the tube."
00:44:12,00:44:13,"Wait, I meant to filter it before eating it?"
00:44:13,00:44:20,The video on poo tube isn't loading. I couldn't see it.
00:44:20,00:44:25,Recycling. Recycling. Recycling.
00:44:25,00:44:33,"Paper. Paper, right? Paper. Well, this is insane. Like, okay, you recycle paper. Sure."
00:44:33,00:44:36,"And then... If you don't, shame on you. If you don't, and then you have recycled paper."
00:44:36,00:44:39,"It's one of the easy ones. You recycle it again, right? It's one of those things that you can just"
00:44:39,00:44:45,keep recycled. It turns out that you can only recycle paper seven times. The same number of
00:44:45,00:44:53,"times you can fold it. Isn't that spooky? That is spooky. The tree knows. The tree is like, no more."
00:44:53,00:45:01,Wrap me in wool and put me in the ground. It's kind of like the sort of Doctor Who regeneration
00:45:01,00:45:05,"limit, isn't it? Can I ask you a question, though? When you recycle it, so I want to recycle this"
00:45:05,00:45:10,paper and put it in my recycling bin. How do I know if it's been recycled seven times and wasting
00:45:10,00:45:18,"more recycling? This is nice paper. It gets a bit rougher, doesn't it? It does. The rough, low quality"
00:45:18,00:45:23,pulpy paper. Cheap notebooks will be made of that. And then there are probably some industrial uses.
00:45:23,00:45:27,"If you've got a cheap notebook, what should you put in there? I'm not the only one who's stressed"
00:45:27,00:45:30,"about this, right? No, no, no. Absolutely. Because you put so much in there, then you go to the big"
00:45:30,00:45:35,"bin on the estate, right? And it's full of fucking plastic bags because no one reads the sign properly."
00:45:35,00:45:40,And is it worth me doing it? Is that whole bin? Someone contaminates the bin. I don't think we're
00:45:40,00:45:45,"saying don't recycle. I think I... No, but if you do... No, no, Karen, Karen, I've got to really"
00:45:45,00:45:50,"bite down on this. No, you should do it. And I do it, but it's frustrating. I know, I know. You have to"
00:45:50,00:45:58,"be careful what you recycle. When turbine blades, they were out sometimes, and they're really difficult"
00:45:58,00:46:03,"to recycle, because they're made of lots of different polymers and stuff. Controversial? Yeah,"
00:46:03,00:46:08,"they've got a new one, a new kind of material that they might use for turbine blades,"
00:46:08,00:46:13,"and you can recycle it by eating it. Oh, wow. You just get some microbial goo,"
00:46:13,00:46:20,"and then you spread it on top. And so what's it made of? It's made of fibreglass, but as well as"
00:46:20,00:46:25,"fibreglass, it's got some plant-derived polymers, it's got some synthetic polymers in, and once"
00:46:25,00:46:29,"it's been working for ages and you need to replace it, you can kind of dissolve it and all the"
00:46:29,00:46:36,"constituent parts separate, and you can reuse all those different bits. And the plant-based ones,"
00:46:36,00:46:43,"you can turn into gummy bears. And the guy who invented it has made a wind turbine, then dissolved"
00:46:43,00:46:47,"it, turned it into a gummy bear and eaten those gummy bears. I mean, I like gummy bears already."
00:46:47,00:46:52,"If I find out that I'm eating gummy bears, which are made from renewable energy turbines, I'm"
00:46:52,00:46:58,going to be over the fucking moon. That is so good. One thing that can be recycled that has been a bit
00:46:58,00:47:04,of a bane of the recycling industry for a while is nappies. Because sometimes they contain lots
00:47:04,00:47:07,"of different components, and it can be hard to separate them. This is a really good study from"
00:47:07,00:47:11,"this year. It's researchers from Indonesia. Actually, just whether your original fact is from"
00:47:11,00:47:17,"James, and it's researchers have found a way of taking nappies, used nappies, washing, drying,"
00:47:17,00:47:22,"sterilizing, shredding them, and then putting them into concrete and mortar. And they have"
00:47:22,00:47:29,successfully built a home that is 10% old nappies. Wow. And it's completely sterile. It's
00:47:29,00:47:35,"completely... And it can use two cubic meters of used nappies, one single-story home, without any"
00:47:35,00:47:40,weakness of structural integrity or anything like that. And it's completely safe. It uses up a load.
00:47:40,00:47:46,"I think that is about the amount a baby gets through in a year or two. No, my baby. We could"
00:47:46,00:47:52,"build half a Milton Key, isn't it? So that's just a trial so far. That's amazing. Even in the UK,"
00:47:52,00:47:59,"half of the Welsh A487 road is made of 100,000 nappies. Amazing. And they would just recycle it."
00:47:59,00:48:03,"I know, plastic pellets that are then part of the road material, and then he tarmac over the top."
00:48:03,00:48:06,"So when we were talking about the three little pigs earlier blowing down a shithouse,"
00:48:06,00:48:11,"that actually could be a reality in the future. We're going to have to wrap up, and it's that,"
00:48:11,00:48:20,"guys. We are at the end of the party. Yeah, so sorry. It's time. It's time. Yeah. Anything before we do?"
00:48:20,00:48:27,You can recycle rare earth metals using fish sperm. We're done. We're done. No one can tell
00:48:27,00:48:32,"me that's it. Is that the stuff you get those in your phone, don't you? The rare earth metal, yeah."
00:48:34,00:48:41,"This is a thing. You know, ""milt"" is the technical name for fish sperm, basically. So scientists use"
00:48:41,00:48:46,"some, again, it's at the experimental stage, it's not widely used. But they made a powder out of"
00:48:46,00:48:52,"some salmon milk, because that is like largely composed of DNA, which largely is made up of"
00:48:52,00:48:57,"phosphate, right? And that is, it's charged in a way that it attracts rare earth metals to it."
00:48:57,00:49:00,"Cool. So if you put it in a solution with some rare earth metals, because they obviously they're"
00:49:00,00:49:06,"very important to recycle, and you want to recycle as much as you can, keep it in the system going"
00:49:06,00:49:10,"around, and if you put it in a solution with some salmon sperm, then it can be extracted. How much"
00:49:10,00:49:15,"sperm do you need? Like, are we going to have to farm fish and make them ejaculate millions of times?"
00:49:15,00:49:18,"I think that is the problem of scale in this. You're absolutely right, because it's like a"
00:49:18,00:49:23,"salmon is quite small, and it is a waste product for the fish industry, but it's not. Not if you're"
00:49:23,00:49:29,"a Mrs. salmon. How are you getting the milk? Like, how do you collect milk? I'm just asking for a"
00:49:29,00:49:32,friend. I don't know. The milk man just comes round.
00:49:32,00:49:45,"Okay, that's it. That is all of our facts. Thank you so much for listening. If you'd like to get"
00:49:45,00:49:49,"in contact with any of us about things we have said over the course of this podcast, we can be"

00:50:16,00:50:20,"join us again next week for another episode. We'll see you then. Thank you so much, Soho Theatre."
00:50:20,00:50:30,That was awesome. Goodbye!
