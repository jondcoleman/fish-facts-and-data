00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,280
 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Things as a Fish, where we were

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:09,360
 joined at the Soho Theatre in London by the incredible Kariad Lloyd. Now if you are a regular

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,080
 listener to No Such Things as a Fish, you will know of course who Kariad is. She's a very good

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:19,280
 friend of ours, she's a comedian, she's an actor, she's a podcaster, she's just an all-round genius,

5
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:24,800
 let's be honest. She has a book out which you definitely should check out, it's called You Are

6
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:30,000
 Not Alone, it's about death but that sounds like it's going to be depressing but it really isn't,

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,600
 it's extremely uplifting that book and there's loads of facts in there as well, it's definitely one

8
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:41,120
 that I think you'll really, really enjoy. And the other thing to say is that Kariad does an

9
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:47,360
 improvised show called Ostentatious. Now this is a really amazing show, what happens is you turn up,

10
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:55,040
 someone in the audience gives them a hitherto lost, let's say, Jane Austen play title that they've

11
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:01,520
 made up, the guys have never heard it before and they do an entire Jane Austen play completely

12
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,640
 improvised. It is absolutely stunningly brilliant, if you haven't seen it you can't miss it, if you

13
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,880
 have seen it go again because it's different every single night and they are about to do

14
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:16,320
 another run at London's West End at the Arts Theatre. Now the best way to find out about those

15
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:25,600
 tickets is to go to ostentatiousimpro.com that's A-U-S-T-E-N-T-A-T-I-O-U-S-I-M-P-R-O.com

16
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:31,200
 but let's be honest, who types in URLs these days? Just go to a search engine, search for

17
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,240
 ostentatious and you will find all the information there. Anyway really hope you enjoy this week's

18
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,720
 show with Kariad Lloyd, all that's left to say is on with the podcast!

19
00:01:40,880 --> 00:02:02,400
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast this week

20
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,040
 coming to you live from the Soho Theatre in London!

21
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,360
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray and

22
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:20,160
 Kariad Lloyd and once again we have gathered round the microphones with our four favourite facts

23
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:26,400
 from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go starting with fact number one

24
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:35,360
 and that is Andy. My fact is that the maximum PDF file you can send is bigger than Belgium.

25
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:43,280
 Can we replace Belgium? Just with a PDF?

26
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:49,920
 Of Belgium, yes you can! Okay in fact it's bigger than that, okay right, the maximum

27
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:56,320
 PDF size you can send is the square with size that are 381 kilometres long, that is bigger than

28
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:02,880
 Belgium, Monaco, San Marino, Liechtenstein, Malta, Andorra, Luxembourg, Montenegro, Slovenia, Albania

29
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:10,960
 and Moldova combined. It is huge! It's mega! Has anyone sent something that big?

30
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:20,320
 Unclear! So I worked out that if you wanted to print it out on A4 paper it would take 2.3 trillion

31
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:29,040
 pieces and if I did it on my printer at home I could have started it off at the time when the

32
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:34,160
 first human fossils were appearing in the fossil records and it would be just about finishing now.

33
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:41,440
 No! Subject to jams and cartridge replacements, that's brilliant, that's so good, I should say

34
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,760
 where I got this from, I saw a guy called Steve Bobrick put it up on Twitter and basically

35
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:55,360
 we should say this appears to only be an adobe acrobat limit. Damn them controlling us as always!

36
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:02,720
 Theoretically there could be a bigger PDF out there. So this is what in the adobe rules it says

37
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,560
 that this is the maximum you're allowed or something. Yeah it's the adobe acrobat, it's 15

38
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:14,320
 million inches by 15 million inches. It's just the rules, it's not even... No it's their internal

39
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:19,200
 limit but the file format itself might not be bound by the adobe. They would probably just have

40
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:24,720
 to click and write 25 million and maybe we'd be able to get even bigger. Maybe, maybe, but I don't

41
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,800
 think anyone's ever actually sent one that's this big. No, why would you? Why would he be insane?

42
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:36,560
 Is that an email attachment or are we talking we transfer here? Oh I think that's a dropbox,

43
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:48,400
 I don't think you can we transfer that. So PDFs, pretty dry, pretty dry. It's amazing when we send

44
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,680
 each other our facts round and we have to then go and research them of course and Andy sent us

45
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:59,120
 the PDF and said maybe it's the most boring fact you've ever sent. Yeah and James said it's not

46
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:07,040
 even close, not even top ten. But I mean we can get on to more general stuff but I do just want to

47
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:13,600
 say that adobe, you know adobe acrobat the program that do the PDFs is named after some mud. Named

48
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:21,280
 after some mud. Adobe it's a building material isn't it? It is. You make it half like poo and wool

49
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:30,480
 I think. Here is mud. James don't attempt poo and wool and be like this is it we can make a house.

50
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:36,400
 That's the worst three little pigs ever isn't it? And the fourth little pig made his house out of

51
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,760
 poo and wool. And the wolf said I'm all right actually because you guys you stay in there it's

52
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:47,200
 fine. I should just explain the mud thing sorry I want to call it a year. Because otherwise I could

53
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,880
 feel the tension in the room. Or they were waiting they were just desperate to know. When is he going to explain about the mud?

54
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:58,480
 The founder of adobe, I'm sorry. You thought you cut to live podcast this is a conference for adobe

55
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:03,760
 and this is how they get their employees in. It's there's a creek which goes past the home

56
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:07,840
 of the founder who's called John Warnock and it has this it has this mud in it it's this very malleable

57
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,960
 clay. I did go on a little wild goose chase trying to find out who the original adobe acrobat actually

58
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:20,880
 was. There wasn't one that wasn't right. That would make it an interesting story. Okay and so he named it after

59
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:27,600
 the some mud some mud by the yeah exactly yeah but it's malleable but pdf's are famously inflexible

60
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,480
 you're right completely untangible. Are you just like I'm just sending you paper like why did he

61
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:38,080
 think oh yeah this clay this reminds me of mine. An acrobat's so flexible as well. Yeah everything

62
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:43,680
 is completely wide open. The rules the idea that this is what they would say this is the limits

63
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:50,080
 to what you have. I find it kind of funny when there are computer rules that just are just so

64
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,960
 makeshift and and sort of seemingly why would you ever say that out loud. Apple three I don't know if

65
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:01,440
 anyone is old enough to remember Apple three but so it was their third. No wait Apple three was the third.

66
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:11,840
 What this is crazy. So yeah it was a it was a hard drive basically that suffered because

67
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,960
 there was no fan on it and Steve Jobs had this thing where he just hated the sound of fans

68
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:22,000
 and so he was like let's not include yeah and so it overheated all the time and when it overheated

69
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,640
 it meant that any disk going in would suddenly just melt and so you're pulling out the hard drive

70
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:32,240
 disk and so yeah so it was a big big problem and one of the employees of Apple was so angry with

71
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:37,040
 it that he slammed it down out of frustration onto his desk and discovered that that made it work

72
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:43,600
 again so if you called up Apple saying it does not work their official line was lift it up lift

73
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:48,800
 the computer up by two inches and just drop it on the table and that's what fixed it that was the

74
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,960
 official line that came from them. Percussive maintenance they call that don't they. What's

75
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:58,080
 that. Just whacking something and hope it works. Oh yeah right yeah yeah. I don't I don't think

76
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,720
 we've mentioned this before we might have done. Do you know what the longest a computer has been

77
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,360
 left running is or the longest running computer ever. I haven't turned my laptop off since 2016.

78
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,800
 Period seven years. You don't need to just rest it's asleep then it wakes up again. Yeah yeah

79
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,960
 nothing works. Do you mean not even closing the lid. I reckon this one might not even have a lid.

80
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:22,160
 Whoa. Right. James is right. I didn't and I was about to say the longest like the running computer

81
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:29,520
 on earth but then I didn't say that. Clue. So it's not an earth. That's right. Great.

82
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:36,080
 Is it in a spaceship. It's in a spaceship. Right. It's the Voyager ones. Voyager ones which

83
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:42,480
 have been on since more than 40 years now. The 70s I guess. Yeah since the 70s. And they're still

84
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:47,120
 working. They're still working. It's a pair of link computers on board Voyager which just sent

85
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,600
 towards the edge of the solar system and it's still going. Each one has 70 kilobytes of memory.

86
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,920
 I mean they're really tiny. Are they like 1970s computers though? They're like old school. They're

87
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,000
 not huge. They're not room sized. They're much smaller than that. If they start working they'll

88
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,520
 slam them into Pluto aren't they. They've got a big monitor and you have to run like CS DOS on it.

89
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:14,000
 I know some things about computers. They had this really big problem in 2015 because the

90
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 last of the original programmers was a guy called Larry Zottarelli and he retired

91
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,440
 and they were stuffed because it was like you need to learn ancient cuneiform of computer

92
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:28,320
 languages. Right. To get it. To get this. Like no one is teaching these computer languages. He's

93
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,920
 still alive. You're not dead. Just call him up. He's retired. He's old. He's retired. He doesn't

94
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:39,040
 want to be. Get him to write out a handover sheet. People know. I'm sure NASA know about. He's like

95
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:46,480
 no I'm done. That's it. You've had my time. It's hard. It's hard to learn the systems required. No. Okay.

96
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:53,040
 Yeah. All right. There was a computer that analyzed 4000 computer science papers

97
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,120
 and it came up with what they call the best computer scientists in the world.

98
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,360
 They describe him as the Michael Jordan of computer science. Do you know who it is?

99
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,680
 No. It's Michael Jordan.

100
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:11,680
 Is it someone with the same name or is it the answer? Okay. The Michael Jordan of computer

101
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,800
 science is Michael Jordan. Call your kids Michael Jordan. That's clear. It's nominative determinism.

102
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,680
 Just Michael Jordan. That's really fun. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Do they refer to Michael Jordan

103
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:27,600
 as the Michael Jordan of basketball? Have you had a Fernando Corbato?

104
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:36,800
 I can't tell until you pronounce it properly. I want to be the Fernando Corbato of something.

105
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:43,040
 Yeah. Well, he was. He was the Fernando Corbato of. He died in 2019. He was 93 years old and he

106
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:52,320
 invented something we all have. Oh, and we've got loads of them. Oh, personalities. Daddy issues.

107
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:06,320
 Nudge yourself closer to the topic at hand. I'll go for transistors. No? Passwords.

108
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,960
 Oh, did he? The man who invented the computer password. Always his mother's maiden name.

109
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:18,400
 Michael Jordan. Michael Jordan. But with the numbers changed for the letters. Yeah. I think it was

110
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,760
 the 50s that he invented it and it was because most computers worked on one thing at a time because

111
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:26,080
 they were the size of rooms and they were, you know, they had processing power but not much and

112
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:30,160
 he was trying to work out a way like a timeshare system so lots of people could work on the

113
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,560
 same computer different tasks, you know. And so he just reasoned that that's the best way of hiding

114
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:39,440
 your files from each other inside the computer. Wow. And I've entered that. Yeah. In 2003.

115
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:46,160
 That is, you're right. It was a sexy fact. But the thing is we don't whistle at facts anymore.

116
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:54,320
 Well, wait, I mean. It's just, it's not okay. I'm sorry. I don't want to be a downer.

117
00:11:54,320 --> 00:12:02,240
 Actually, Cariad, it made me feel empowered. There's always one working against the movement.

118
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:10,320
 What can I say? In 2003, a survey found that 90% of office workers passing through Waterloo

119
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:17,120
 Station would give away their computer password in exchange for a biro. Just a biro? Not even a

120
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,200
 chocolate? Well, another one. Another survey in 2003 found that 70% of people would do it in exchange

121
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:27,920
 for some chocolate. 100%. 34% of people just gave their password without even needing the bribe.

122
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,480
 So what's your password? They just told them. That's so good. That was in the past when you

123
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:37,600
 you only needed like four, right? Yeah. There's no way you can even remember them. Yeah. That's

124
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:44,880
 amazing. I got a quick story about a Microsoft laptop that there was a mystery. It kept crashing.

125
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:50,560
 This is 2005. So the culprit of the problem was Janet Jackson.

126
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:56,640
 Is it the real Janet Jackson? The real Janet Jackson. And it was her song Rhythm Nation.

127
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:04,080
 And what it was is that the frequency of it was at such the same level of which the disk was spinning

128
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:09,680
 that it would send the disk into a wobble and it would crash. And even if Rhythm Nation was playing

129
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:15,440
 from one laptop but being heard by another laptop, that would crash as well. Like Dogwist or just

130
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:20,400
 be like, is it me? Yeah, yeah, exactly. So it was, yeah. So Janet Jackson was responsible for a

131
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:25,840
 whole software update or whatever of a Microsoft laptop. She's constantly innovating. She is.

132
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:33,040
 You, do you know the, you won't know this, but can you guess the picture? What is it? What is it?

133
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:38,640
 We need more. We need more. That was almost a sentence, but not quite. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

134
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:44,240
 So the picture, which has the most pixels in it. So the image that has the most pixels in the world

135
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:54,000
 has 102 terapixels. Okay. Security, security. No, no, come on now. It feels nice, doesn't it?

136
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,120
 No, no, that did not feel nice. That was, that fact was just minding its own business.

137
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:05,360
 Okay, get ready to whistle. Can you guess what the picture is of? Belgium.

138
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:12,240
 Is it like Tetris, just to give you a t-shirt? Or is it like very pixelated?

139
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:17,040
 No, it's, it's pixelated in the fact that it has a lot of pixels in it. It's not like,

140
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,160
 oh, okay, okay. But basically, if you made it really small, it would be really clear. That's

141
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:26,000
 the point. I'll say a big telescope thing like the universe. Mona Lisa. Oh gosh, no, it is the world's

142
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:33,280
 biggest penis. Wow. Well, welcome to the whistle. This is your perfect partner. Wait, do you mean

143
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:38,320
 it's the world's biggest picture of a penis or the world's biggest penis? Clarify, we need that.

144
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:43,200
 It's a picture of a normal sized penis, but it's the world's biggest image. And what's a normal size

145
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:52,880
 penis? Just asking for a friend. So many issues. If they, if they made each pixel one inch. That's

146
00:14:52,880 --> 00:15:01,360
 not a normal sized penis. That also wasn't really an inch, but we'll not go into that. If you made

147
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:08,720
 each pixel an inch, it would wrap around the earth 2.7 times this image. And if you,

148
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:20,400
 if you are printed it out to the same specs as a billboard, it would be as tall as 16,408

149
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:25,520
 Empire State buildings. And if you 3D printed that, you would be able to poke the International

150
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:34,800
 Space Station. And you need permission before you do that. Okay. It was invented by a former NASA

151
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:49,040
 intern who does not wish to be identified. We need to move on to our next act, guys. It is time for

152
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:56,640
 fact number two. And that is Kariat. During the 17th century, when you died, your relatives were

153
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:02,320
 legally forced to bury you wearing wool, whether you liked it or not. And there was for no other

154
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:10,160
 reason than to support the ailing wool industry. I love this fact. Okay. So basically there was

155
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:18,160
 an act by parliament in 1666 that overnight said everybody has to be buried in wool. And it sounds

156
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,640
 like, oh, okay. But previously to that, nobody was buried in wool ever. Ever. That was like an

157
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:28,400
 unusual thing to happen. You were buried in a linen shroud like Jesus in the Bible. And no coffin,

158
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:32,400
 no coffin, right? Sometimes they did have coffins. Sometimes they had coffins. It was unusual.

159
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:36,480
 But it was very unusual. You would mostly be wrapped in a shroud and just shoved in the earth.

160
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:42,320
 And because the wool industry was so important, and they were so worried about linen coming from

161
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:50,560
 France, basically, classic fucking French linen coming over here taking our coffins. The government

162
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:59,280
 basically said, I know. It was your GB news show coming on. Listen, the British wool. I am sweating,

163
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:05,280
 but I am British. So many people employed in the wool industry, 12% of the population worked in

164
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:10,000
 the wool industry. And it brought in a huge amount of money. So they said, well, we'll just make it

165
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,680
 a law that you have to be buried in a wool suit in a coffin lined with wool. And if you weren't,

166
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:23,920
 you will find five pounds, which is the equivalent of 550 pounds today. So basically,

167
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:27,680
 initially, everyone was like, no, fuck you. Where are we going to get this from? No one has

168
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:32,160
 this. We have a history of this. And the linens they used to wrap them in would be your family

169
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,320
 linen. So you would have something that has been like a tablecloth, and you would keep it all night,

170
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,200
 and then you would sew them together. The women would sew it together and wrap everybody up.

171
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:45,600
 So it's like a very nice thing. And so people weren't following the law. So then they made it

172
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:50,640
 that you had to go to the keeper of the peace. Two members of your family had to sign an affidavit

173
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:55,200
 saying, we have done this, otherwise you'd be fine. So you had to go to the church and swear,

174
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,200
 like based on the Bible, we buried them in wool, sorry. Yeah, there was an oath you had to read,

175
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:05,120
 right? Yeah, a special oath, which I've got here saying, no corpse or any person, except any person

176
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:11,200
 that shall die of the plague. Fuck them. That's because they thought it lived on in the wool.

177
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:16,240
 Shall be buried in any shift sheet or shroud or anything whatsoever made or mingled with flax,

178
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:22,800
 hemp, silk, hair, gold, or silver in any stuff or thing other than what is made of sheep's wool

179
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:28,480
 only. That's a name how to say that. But the fine that you mentioned, the five pound fine,

180
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:33,760
 if you grasped someone up as being buried in non-wool, then you could get half of the five

181
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:40,880
 pounds. Yeah. And this is the really clever thing. If you had buried your relative in Lennon and you

182
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,600
 knew that you were likely to be caught anyway, you could go and grasp up on your own relative,

183
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,080
 get a half the fine, back into the family, you've only paid half the fine. Did they do that? Yeah,

184
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,800
 they did. So rich people did that. So some people who like, there were certain areas where it was

185
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:58,240
 very much didn't, they didn't approve of it. And so rich people would be like, well fuck you. Well,

186
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:03,600
 you said that like one of the rules was you couldn't bury in gold. Yeah. So I think if you're

187
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:09,200
 burying someone in gold, probably you can afford the five pounds. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Exactly.

188
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:15,200
 So there was a study that was done between 1678 and 1707, less than one percent, and this was in

189
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:20,800
 Henstridge. Yes. Less than one percent of burials in the churchyard were in Lennon, so following this

190
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:26,000
 rule. But then when you went inside the church itself, it was between nine and 13 percent that

191
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:32,320
 were then rich people in the church. Yeah, yeah, exactly. One interesting part of this is that,

192
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:37,920
 okay, so you started to have loads more extra linen and extra cloth around because you were

193
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:44,320
 using the wool for the burials. And newspapers were made out of recycled cloth. So that's why

194
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:48,480
 you call that a rag now, because they used to use the rags, turn into newspaper and then make

195
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:53,840
 newspapers. And so they had all of these extra bits of linen, which meant they could make more

196
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:58,960
 newspapers. And there was a huge boom of newspapers around that time. And this sort of fed into that.

197
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,520
 They were pleased about it. Everyone else was pissed off. And there's an amazing, have you

198
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:08,480
 heard of Deca Mittford? And I've talked to you guys about her before. Yeah, one of the Jessica

199
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:14,880
 Mittford sisters who were like these socialite 20th century British figures who were involved in

200
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,800
 every single thing that happened. She went to America, she was a communist, she went to America,

201
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:23,120
 kind of disowned her family. In the 60s, she wrote this book called An American Way of Death.

202
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:28,320
 Okay. It was like, it's very odd because she was a British socialite that had like gone to fight

203
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,400
 in Spain and then moved to America. Very unusual story. But the book that she wrote basically

204
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:37,120
 changed the American funeral industry. Because what was happening was they were just basically

205
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:42,400
 rinsing people for money. And when someone died, they used to kind of perform plastic surgery on

206
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:47,200
 them and then barmed them and so make them look, I mean, or she describes like basically nip and

207
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,520
 tuck the tissue across the body with implants, pins and fillers to mask blemishes and swellings

208
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:55,680
 that come with age and illness before sowing the face into the most attractive and youthful

209
00:20:55,680 --> 00:21:00,080
 expression possible. Sewing it. Teeth were whitened, makeup applied and the corpse was

210
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:07,120
 dressed in its final outfit. Yes, I would like all of this. There was a special kind of bra

211
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:14,080
 designed for post-mortem form restoration. I'll pass on that. So she wrote this book exposing...

212
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:21,440
 Why is Andy in a bra? It was part of the package. She wrote this amazing book that exposed,

213
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,880
 basically they were they were preying on the vulnerable. So these poor people who had no

214
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,120
 money would end up paying like thousands of dollars for what was considered like a proper funeral.

215
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:33,600
 And her book was like in the bestsellers for years. David Bowie listed it as one of his favorite

216
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:38,480
 ever books, top 100 books because she changed everything. And they were putting so many chemicals

217
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,960
 in at that time. It was so dangerous. And that's why like funeral makers were dying of cancer from

218
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:48,640
 inhaling on the formaldehyde. Grim. There's one kind of fun thing they used to do. I bought it

219
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:55,680
 down. Bring us back to the fun stuff. This is in ancient Roman funerals. You could pay an actor,

220
00:21:55,680 --> 00:22:00,960
 and a lot of people did this, you would pay an actor to dress up and wear a mask as the person

221
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:07,200
 who died. Yes. And then in the party they'd kind of mingle with everyone. Yes. Pretending that they

222
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:13,120
 were still alive and like parodying the things that they did. Oh wait, is it... I don't want to

223
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:19,680
 be parodied, but I would love someone to be doing some of my good stuff. I'd even write some lines

224
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:24,480
 for them to... I think that's a great idea. Andy at a funeral. I know. Some dude walking around going,

225
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:30,640
 "Did you know the largest PDF I'm ever..." Thank God, thank God, thank God he died.

226
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:38,640
 That's amazing. Look, wool. I'm sorry, bring me back to wool. We went after death.

227
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:43,520
 Wool is an amazing material. It's like a super substance that I had no idea about. Have you

228
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:50,560
 not heard of wool before now? I didn't know how good wool was basically. So it's covered in scales.

229
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:54,240
 If you look, if you zoom in, you look at it with the microscope, it's covered in scales. So liquid

230
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,880
 water slides off the outside, right? So it's very hydrophobic, I guess, so it's good at protecting

231
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:06,000
 you from water, but it not absorbs, it adsorbs water easily, right? So if you have water vapor

232
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,600
 in here, it kind of makes its way into the wool, like underneath the scales. So once the water

233
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:17,920
 gets in, that keeps you nicely cool, for example. Wait, so sorry, it's pushing off water. It pushes

234
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:23,280
 off liquid water, but it takes in water vapor, okay? So you try to wear a wool jumper in summer,

235
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:28,640
 and then winter as well. Oh, sorry, yeah, yeah. It releases heat, so that can also warm you up,

236
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,920
 even if it's got water vapor inside it. So that's the way of keeping you warm. So if you fall in a

237
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:38,480
 river that's freezing cold, and then you get to dry land, be wearing wool. Like, don't wear cotton

238
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:43,760
 if you've done that. Right. Basically, because you'll be much less harmed if you're wearing wool,

239
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:49,040
 which has repelled the outside water, it's not wet on the inside. That's a top tip. Yeah. It's a top

240
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:55,200
 tip. If there's two of you on like a raft, and only one of you can stay on the raft, the one who's

241
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:00,080
 wearing wool gets pushed in, is what you're saying. Yeah, exactly. Right. Don't be on a raft with

242
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:05,680
 James. They've invented a new kind of sheep this year, that's exciting. A new kind of sheep. They've

243
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:10,400
 bred a multifunctional sheep for the first time, which is very exciting. Okay, let's go for the

244
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:15,680
 functions. Does it do your diary, organise it on a cook? It just does wool and meat, basically.

245
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:20,960
 But that's new. And have the two been mutually exclusive before that? I think this is the most

246
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:26,800
 multifunctional sheep they've ever come up with. Wow. The sheep three. It's a sheep three. Is it

247
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:32,480
 not working? Just drop it. Drop it from a short height. Well, yeah, that's incredible. I knew

248
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:38,800
 sheep. That's amazing. Oh, I saw an amazing picture online, which I want to go see in person. If you

249
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:43,280
 go to which museum is it? I think it's in the Science Museum. Yeah, it's a Science Museum.

250
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:49,600
 There's a jumper there made of wool, which is on display. Can you guess why the Science Museum

251
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:55,520
 would have a notable jumper of wool? Knitted by expedition. That's good. No, no. So it's not

252
00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:00,560
 been to the North Pole? Not been to the North Pole. Knitted by Einstein. Knitted by some famous

253
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:06,800
 scientist. No. What's their famous sheep? Dolly. Dolly's jumper. There we go. It is wool from the

254
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:12,400
 first mammal ever cloned, Dolly. The sheared wool turned into a jumper. And they've only made one.

255
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:20,000
 Idiots. Yeah. And it's got sheep on it. It's really beautiful. That's not beautiful, but it's, you

256
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 know, it's a bit cartoony. Pretty cool though, isn't it? It's very cool. The wool industry was so

257
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:32,480
 important for Britain that they had to do loads of laws for it. So there was this thing with the

258
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,640
 burials. But there was another thing where they tried to get rid of all the wolves, because obviously

259
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:43,920
 the wolves were killing the sheep. So Edward I paid one guy, Peter Corbett, to destroy all the wolves

260
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:50,000
 in Britain, which he managed. We don't have any wolves anymore. Hey, what are you up to? I'm just

261
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 killing all the wolves in Britain. And William the Conqueror would grant land to people in North

262
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,680
umberland and Cumberland on the condition that they would defend the land from any wolves and any

263
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:09,680
 Scotsman. It was mean putting them second in the list. Did you know, I'm sure you knew, it's about

264
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:17,360
 the wool sack that is in the House of Parliament. It looks like a sort of giant cushion called the

265
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:23,280
 wool sack, and it's where the Lord Speaker sits. And that was introduced by some, I had it written

266
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:27,280
 down, I've lost it, some king, basically a long time ago, to commemorate how important the wool

267
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:31,520
 trade is. And now it's stuffed with wool, a blended wool from Britain and the other wool

268
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:36,240
 producing nations of the Commonwealth, the ones we stole. Common wolf more like.

269
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:46,000
 He's a slow hand clap. It didn't feel empowering. I didn't feel. No, just on the wool sack, they,

270
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,760
 I think that it was, it's centuries old, it's really, really old. And in 1938, they opened it up

271
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:56,480
 and they found out, oh, it's horse hair, completely full of horse hair, full of wool.

272
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:04,400
 Scandal, that is. So now they filled it with the Commonwealth wool. Do you know where we almost

273
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:09,280
 had wool? Where? It's such a, like, on our bodies. Do you mean like humans used to have? On our bodies,

274
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:18,720
 yes. The legs. No. The arms. No. Running short. The teeth, the teeth woman. No, no, inside the body.

275
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:27,200
 Yes. Oh. What? How drunk are we? We used to have some kind of... No, no, no, we didn't use to, we

276
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:35,760
 almost had. Didn't we almost have the wool inside? We almost had wool in our, in our, in our livers,

277
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:44,560
 lungs, hearts. Boobies. We almost had woolen boobies. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary

278
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:50,960
 evidence there. So, in the 1950s, there was a lot of experiments going on. In the 1950s? Yeah,

279
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:56,000
 there were... We didn't get boobs in the 1950s as a species. Oh, we did, we did. But what we did have

280
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,640
 was plastic surgery, where people were having their breasts enhanced, and there were many materials

281
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,240
 that were tested out as what we would be using for breast... That is an itchy tits.

282
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:15,920
 You do get itchy tits. If that is made of wool, that is... Itchy on the inside. Oh, that's... They

283
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:21,280
 tried wool? They tried wool. They tried sponges. They tried ivory balls. They tried ivory. Yeah,

284
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:25,520
 they tried a lot of stuff. And then eventually it was the silicon implants that they worked in.

285
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:29,280
 Sponges, so you could maybe decrease and increase them, depending on how much water you put.

286
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:34,560
 Yeah, yeah. Sounds good. Anyway, I need to move us on to our next fact. Do you want to say one more

287
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:39,920
 thing before we do? Well, I was just going to talk about the wool factories that we had. So,

288
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:44,160
 a lot of the wool factories in the north, they would have families who basically lived in the

289
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:48,240
 shadow of them, and the factories would kind of look after them, feed them. They would go to

290
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:53,760
 church with the factory owners, all that kind of stuff. And I was reading about one called the

291
00:28:53,760 --> 00:29:00,560
 Fox's Woolen Mill. They invented khaki, the stuff that you... The khaki? The thing you used to get

292
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:06,080
 into your car. Yeah, yeah. Oh, that's not what I thought you said, sorry. No, the khaki material.

293
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:14,800
 Cool. And they said that the children would get free woolen clothing, and they would be sewn into

294
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:22,160
 their woolen underwear in September, and then let out again in May. Wow. I think they must have had

295
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:27,280
 an opening. Yeah, there's an engineering problem there. I think so. Wow. But yeah, imagine that.

296
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:33,440
 Put a tube in. You stay warm. Yeah. But being sewn into your underwear for six months of the year.

297
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,920
 Living Newton-John was sewn into those trousers in Greece. That's true. And they had to unpick her

298
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:42,000
 every time she needed to. There was a story, wasn't there, that Franz Ferdinand, when he was shot,

299
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:48,080
 he'd been sewn into his uniform and... You had the band. The band. I was like, what? They're going,

300
00:29:48,080 --> 00:30:04,080
 take me out. Take me out. It is time for fact number three, and that is my fact. My fact this week

301
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:11,840
 is that in 1914, women were only allowed to visit the Natural History Museum if a man agreed to

302
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:19,280
 sign a note promising that they would behave themselves. So this is, yeah, this is, as I say,

303
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:25,520
 1914. I got this fact, by the way, from Dr. Fern Riddell. She's a historian. She's written in books

304
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:30,640
 about suffragettes and the history of sex and all that sort. She's brilliant. You can find her on

305
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:36,160
 Twitter. And she put up this link, which was for one of the museums by an author called Kerry

306
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:42,800
 Lotzvaz. And it was the story of suffragettes. And during 1912 to 1914, there was so much damage

307
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:48,160
 that was going on in the name of trying to get their message out, much the way that we see modern

308
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:53,680
 protesting, that they would take... They would do quite sort of big acts when they are destroying

309
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:58,960
 things. And museums were a particular target. And so museums basically had to shut down for a while.

310
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:04,080
 You had to go by appointment in some cases. But women specifically had a note that was

311
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:09,680
 presented to a man, and they would have to hand in at the door, that then gave them access. And

312
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:14,560
 if they did damage something, the man would be liable for the damage that they did. And the woman.

313
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:22,400
 Honestly. Yeah, it was wild, wasn't it? The Natural History Museums weren't sure exactly what they might

314
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:27,600
 target. The head of the museum said that unless explosives are used, the large mammals are not

315
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:33,440
 likely to suffer very seriously. But they were bombing things at the time. So there was a chance

316
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,000
 they might... If I know, they're not worried about women's rights. They're like, "Fucking hell, those

317
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 elephants. They need protecting." Well, they were mostly bothered about the coral. Apparently.

318
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:48,720
 Famously. Order of priorities. Men, coral, women. But it was such a big deal. Lloyds of London actually

319
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:53,440
 started issuing householders comprehensive insurance policies that covered damages by airplanes,

320
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:59,200
 riots and suffragettes. No. That was part of your insurance. As a woman, you did go to a museum.

321
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:04,560
 You had to surrender your parcels, your muff and your umbrella at the door. Because all they were

322
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:11,440
 all used to conceal objects you... Well, the suffragettes, they actually... The suffragettes

323
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:16,560
 came out saying that we're going to put hammers in our muffs. You'd be amazed what some women can do.

324
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:24,560
 "Must Hammer" is a good, cool nickname for a suffragette, isn't it? WWE Muff Hammer.

325
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:32,080
 Making her way to the ring. She's got a note from her husband. But he hasn't signed it!

326
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:40,400
 Oh, also, we should all be saying suffragettes. Oh, really? Because they were very, very initially.

327
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:45,120
 Well, the word was coined by a newspaper writer, and they were originally referred to as suffragettes,

328
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:49,440
 because... And they took it on because they said, "We're going to get the vote." It was the Daily Mail.

329
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:54,800
 The Daily Mail coined the word "suffragette" where everyone's... But as a slam of a word?

330
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:59,280
 It was a slam, because they were not the nice ones. Distinguished from the women's social and

331
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:04,160
 political union. The suffragists were the ones who were being peaceful campaigners. But then it

332
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:08,800
 became like, "Yeah, we are suffragettes. Fuck you." Yeah, yeah. Just on the museums, just one last thing.

333
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:14,640
 The assistant keeper of the National Portrait Gallery, who was called James Milner,

334
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:19,360
 said that if women are to be admitted into public galleries, there seems to be no alternative,

335
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:26,400
 but to handcuff their hands behind their backs, and to put up a grill in front of all the pictures

336
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:34,880
 to stop them headbutting them. Sensible policies for a safer Britain. Wow. Wow. Isn't that amazing?

337
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,960
 So depressing. Yes, they really, really got up people's noses, I think is what they're saying.

338
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:43,680
 That's one word for it. Do you know that? Yeah. Emily Wilding Davidson. Yeah. Davidson,

339
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:48,720
 the one who threw herself under the King's horse, so famously... She was the first human casualty.

340
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:53,440
 I was reading about her, and she was actually super violent, and had been for a very long time,

341
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:57,040
 was throwing rocks. She kept trying to throw rocks at Lloyd George, but kept mistaking someone.

342
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:03,120
 And she was so violent that Pankhurst was like, "Get her out. This is too much. We think she's

343
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:07,280
 going to do something nuts." Yeah, because she was just attacking people, throwing herself at people.

344
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:11,680
 Because they all did jiu-jitsu, didn't they? They were trained in jiu-jitsu by one of the suffragettes,

345
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:16,320
 Edith Garrard. Garrard led the teaching, because she knew how to do jiu-jitsu.

346
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:21,040
 And the idea behind the training was that appointed bodyguards would surround leaders,

347
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:25,040
 like the Pankhurst, basically, so that they had people in front of them to do jiu-jitsu.

348
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:28,960
 But they also had big wooden clubs concealed about their person.

349
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:33,840
 In their muff hammers. Well, I don't know. Like, no muff is big enough to hide these clubs.

350
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,520
 They had to hide them in their dressers. Oh, baby, you don't know!

351
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:43,840
 I was reading about the slow pace of female emancipation. Just that Saudi Arabia gave women

352
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:50,080
 the right to vote in 2015, leaving Vatican City as the only place where women's suffrage is still

353
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:56,080
 denied today. Right. Yeah. Well, Switzerland only got it in 1991 as the whole country.

354
00:34:56,080 --> 00:35:03,280
 So it was 1971 that the country had universal suffrage. But all the cantons were allowed to vote

355
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,480
 on it themselves. And they're like the sort of counties. They're like the counties, yeah. But

356
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,320
 they have a lot of things that they can kind of decide by themselves. And there was one canton,

357
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:18,640
 the Appenzell in a Holden canton, that voted against women's suffrage in '73, '82 and 1990.

358
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:24,800
 Fucking hell. Come on, canton. Get with it. I know. And the thing is, it's slightly weird,

359
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,880
 because the way that they vote there, they don't like going to a voting booth. They all go into

360
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:36,800
 the town hall square and kind of shout. Fuck women! I said it 15 years ago, and I stand by it!

361
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:44,800
 Shut up, Sandra! Yeah. And then in 1991, the federal government had to step in and say,

362
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,720
 look, this is the rule, guys. Guys, you're embarrassing us. You're an embarrassing uncle.

363
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,920
 It's getting really embarrassing. Have you heard of the board game Suffragetto?

364
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:59,280
 No. Have you heard of the board game Pankersquith? Yeah, they came out roughly at the same time.

365
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:04,640
 Really? Yeah, yeah. What's yours? My one is a game whereby it kind of looks like a chessboard,

366
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:08,640
 and you have all these pieces, and on one side, you're team Suffragette, and then the other side,

367
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:14,160
 you're team police, and you need to get as many... I want this game. This sounds amazing. Yeah, well,

368
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:18,640
 there's only one remaining copy of it, and it's in the Bodleian Library. I'm going to go with my

369
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:24,640
 Marfan Steelem, before I headbutt a painting. I think you used to be able to, like, download,

370
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:28,320
 I was going to say PDFs, but I think you could, like, download the board and stuff.

371
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:33,360
 Oh, yeah, right, cool. Yeah, but Pankersquith, because it was Asquith, the Prime Minister?

372
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:37,520
 It was the Prime Minister at the time, and this was 1909, and it was a board game.

373
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:41,440
 You had to get across the board and avoid arrest. It was the same kind of premise. Yeah, yeah.

374
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:47,920
 But the violence of the Suffragette movement was part of this game of suffragetto, because

375
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:52,000
 if you caught one of the suffragettes, they went to prison, and if you caught one of the policemen,

376
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:59,120
 they went to hospital. Yes. Yeah. And this was made by the suffragettes, I think, the board game?

377
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:03,120
 Yeah, so it was their own issued game. They had a lot of merch. They had a load of merch.

378
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:08,240
 Women love merch. We'll buy a tote bag. We don't care what's on it. We do not care.

379
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:12,000
 What other merch did they have? Oh, they had sort of scarves, and they had badges, and they had

380
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,680
 lots of postcards. Well, the colours, the big thing was the purple one, and then they put that on

381
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:19,120
 jewellery, as well, and you'd have it on rings, and it was like a secret. You could wear the colours

382
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:22,560
 separately, and everyone would be like, "Oh, I know what you vote for." That was one of the things

383
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:30,400
 of the, at the 2012 Olympics, they had a suffragette display as part of the opening ceremony,

384
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:37,360
 and someone came out as Emily Davison wearing the purple sash that was Emily Davison's. That's

385
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:42,960
 the genuine article. Yeah, which is pretty cool. We should probably say there is a bit of a debate

386
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:48,720
 about whether suffragette tactics won the day in the end, because they suspended all militant

387
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:52,160
 activities at the start of the First World War, and then by the end of the war, women were so

388
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:57,280
 integrated in industry, factories, all of that. Are you saying war's good? Is that where there's

389
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:06,240
 going? Or are you saying the suffragettes are bad? Yeah. Which one, Andy? Because the live audience

390
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:10,160
 and the people listening at home would like to know. Well, actually, I'm probably saying both.

391
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:18,320
 Welcome to GB News. But no, there is a debate, isn't there? Well, like, it did actually,

392
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,200
 actually did they achieve anything, because they made themselves very, very hated at the time,

393
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:25,680
 and then the impression was that by the end of the war, that women were just so much more

394
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,400
 into society. But then would that have happened without them doing that movement in the first

395
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,240
 phase? I don't know, yeah. It would have been four long years. Yeah, yeah. But it's definitely like,

396
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:35,840
 the tosses argue, isn't it? The tosses argue. Can I quickly, just speaking of people hiding

397
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:40,960
 things in their muffs, it just reminded me of my favourite headline of all time.

398
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:47,440
 So the author, Cormac McCarthy, died earlier this year, and it was a headline that I saw years ago.

399
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:51,200
 This is the headline. So he only just makes a cameo, and this is not really to do with him.

400
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:58,000
 Cormac McCarthy's ex-wife pulls gun from vagina during argument over aliens.

401
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:04,960
 Tell me you're clicking on that link immediately. The Daily Telegraph has changed, hasn't it?

402
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:10,640
 What was that? Where was that? It was in a newspaper. Oh, great. Yeah.

403
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:15,280
 In Iraq. Yeah, by Vince Mancini. In Iraq. Yeah.

404
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,480
 Check this out. Anyway, yeah, I've been wanting to say that for years on this podcast.

405
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:31,600
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is James. Okay, my fact this week is that

406
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:38,880
 a designer from Indonesia who recycles cow dung has found a way to make stools from stools.

407
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:48,400
 Very nice. Thank you. Yeah, it's just a joke that stools and stools are the same thing,

408
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:53,280
 but this is a thing that happened. This was a display from the last Singapore Design Week,

409
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:58,320
 which I read about. It's all about upcycling. So they made lighting from old washing machine

410
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:05,360
 pipes. They made rugs from dog hair. And this guy called Adhi Nugraha has his team, basically,

411
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:11,360
 at his university has taken this dung. They remove the water. That gets rid of the smell.

412
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:15,360
 They add a load of wood glue and stuff like that. And then they mould it into

413
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:19,760
 into anything you want. You can get speakers, you can get stools, you can get flower pots,

414
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:27,680
 all sorts. It's a very cool thing. It's a good way of recycling poo. A lot of it is burned,

415
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:31,680
 isn't it? Cow dung in India, which is really bad for the environment. I mean, cows themselves are

416
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:35,200
 very bad for the environment. And the dung, like it's full of methane and it just burning it,

417
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:40,800
 just a bad idea. But it can be used to coat walls. Yeah, that's another thing. Adobe, for instance.

418
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:47,040
 Yeah. Adobe. Poo and wool combined. Well, so I was reading a thing about astronaut poo and what

419
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:53,680
 it might be used for for. Oh, yeah. And this is an exciting development. So it might be in future

420
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:58,880
 that astronauts are able to power their own spaceship using polymers from their own poo.

421
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:04,560
 So that's thrilling, as in you can send astronauts to Mars and be like, make your own way home.

422
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:10,960
 When you hear some fruit and fiber. Yeah, exactly. Six months. And the other thing is they might be

423
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:15,920
 able to grow their own. This is a bit is a bit of a growth factor, but trying to disregard it. So

424
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:24,240
 they might be able to grow their own food from control. No one's ready. There were scientists

425
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:29,680
 at Pennsylvania in 2017. They researched this thing, a bio reactor, right? So you effectively,

426
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:38,000
 you poo in the tube and then the tube tube. That's a good name for it. That's actually going

427
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,360
 to make it much more palatable to people, I think. And it produces gas. It sort of gives off various

428
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:50,320
 biological gases and that fuels a microbial goo. Oh, God, that's the worst word you've used so far.

429
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:56,160
 We were all on board until microbial goo. Be squeamish. Microbial goo, chief.

430
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:02,000
 They create a reactor and the good news, good or bad news, as I suppose it works.

431
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:07,040
 And so that. So what is the reaction? Is it power or is it, what are they getting out of it?

432
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:11,600
 This is to produce the Vegemite like microbial goo. Oh, you're going to eat it.

433
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:16,240
 You're not, and I should stress, you're not eating anything that you have. It's completely

434
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:20,000
 safe. You're filtering. It's like, it's all filtration. If I go to a restaurant, I don't want

435
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:27,760
 others to go, it is completely safe. Yes, it was once your ship, but it's not anymore. People change.

436
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:32,400
 I thought as well, when you said about spearing stuff on walls, I thought that was a thing that

437
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,920
 they were talking about deep space exploration. Because one of the problems that you have when

438
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:40,480
 you're flying further into space is that you go into these radiation bands where suddenly

439
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:44,080
 you're just getting smashed by it. And if you put poo all over your walls.

440
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:48,080
 Outside of the spaceship. Oh, is it on the outside? I believe so.

441
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:51,120
 Who's doing that? I thought it was on the inside. Yeah, who's, who's

442
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:54,400
 who's going outside? You can go on a spacewalk. You can go on a spacewalk.

443
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,280
 What is your son doing at NASA again?

444
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:05,360
 Peanuts, PDFs, actually. Just tell them Arthur, you smear shit on the outside of a spaceship,

445
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:13,040
 and we should be proud of him. Jesus Christ. You can imagine slowly, you're sort of like 30 years

446
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:17,760
 into an intergalactic mission. You're outside your spaceship. You're smearing your laided

447
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:22,320
 batch of shit on the outside guy. They're taking the fucking piss, aren't they?

448
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:26,960
 I should have done that drama degree, man. It's like, it's just not worth it.

449
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:30,800
 I was saying, you're the fucking muffin. Go to space, they said. See the universe, they said.

450
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:37,360
 I like the usual way it was on the inside. That was normal. You were like, yeah, yeah,

451
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:41,200
 living in like a shit hole. Well, it makes more sense. Should we,

452
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:44,640
 been going on a spacewalk to smear shit all over your ship? Yeah, I think it does.

453
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:51,280
 I can just imagine NASA checking in with you, Dan, a few months into the mission.

454
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:56,000
 Sorry, sorry, astronaut Shriver. We lost control and have you been...

455
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:05,360
 Okay, send him home. Send him home. All right, astronaut Shriver, you're going to need to

456
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:10,800
 turn your entire spaceship inside out. No, Dan, you need to poo into the tube.

457
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,840
 Wait, I meant to filter it before eating it?

458
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:20,640
 The video on poo tube isn't loading. I couldn't see it.

459
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:25,200
 Recycling. Recycling. Recycling.

460
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:33,360
 Paper. Paper, right? Paper. Well, this is insane. Like, okay, you recycle paper. Sure.

461
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:36,320
 And then... If you don't, shame on you. If you don't, and then you have recycled paper.

462
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:39,920
 It's one of the easy ones. You recycle it again, right? It's one of those things that you can just

463
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:45,600
 keep recycled. It turns out that you can only recycle paper seven times. The same number of

464
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:53,840
 times you can fold it. Isn't that spooky? That is spooky. The tree knows. The tree is like, no more.

465
00:44:53,840 --> 00:45:01,920
 Wrap me in wool and put me in the ground. It's kind of like the sort of Doctor Who regeneration

466
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:05,520
 limit, isn't it? Can I ask you a question, though? When you recycle it, so I want to recycle this

467
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:10,160
 paper and put it in my recycling bin. How do I know if it's been recycled seven times and wasting

468
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:18,560
 more recycling? This is nice paper. It gets a bit rougher, doesn't it? It does. The rough, low quality

469
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:23,120
 pulpy paper. Cheap notebooks will be made of that. And then there are probably some industrial uses.

470
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:27,520
 If you've got a cheap notebook, what should you put in there? I'm not the only one who's stressed

471
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:30,880
 about this, right? No, no, no. Absolutely. Because you put so much in there, then you go to the big

472
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:35,120
 bin on the estate, right? And it's full of fucking plastic bags because no one reads the sign properly.

473
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:40,240
 And is it worth me doing it? Is that whole bin? Someone contaminates the bin. I don't think we're

474
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:45,120
 saying don't recycle. I think I... No, but if you do... No, no, Karen, Karen, I've got to really

475
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:50,480
 bite down on this. No, you should do it. And I do it, but it's frustrating. I know, I know. You have to

476
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:58,400
 be careful what you recycle. When turbine blades, they were out sometimes, and they're really difficult

477
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:03,840
 to recycle, because they're made of lots of different polymers and stuff. Controversial? Yeah,

478
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:08,400
 they've got a new one, a new kind of material that they might use for turbine blades,

479
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:13,360
 and you can recycle it by eating it. Oh, wow. You just get some microbial goo,

480
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:20,080
 and then you spread it on top. And so what's it made of? It's made of fibreglass, but as well as

481
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:25,200
 fibreglass, it's got some plant-derived polymers, it's got some synthetic polymers in, and once

482
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:29,760
 it's been working for ages and you need to replace it, you can kind of dissolve it and all the

483
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:36,000
 constituent parts separate, and you can reuse all those different bits. And the plant-based ones,

484
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:43,360
 you can turn into gummy bears. And the guy who invented it has made a wind turbine, then dissolved

485
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:47,760
 it, turned it into a gummy bear and eaten those gummy bears. I mean, I like gummy bears already.

486
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:52,320
 If I find out that I'm eating gummy bears, which are made from renewable energy turbines, I'm

487
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:58,160
 going to be over the fucking moon. That is so good. One thing that can be recycled that has been a bit

488
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:04,320
 of a bane of the recycling industry for a while is nappies. Because sometimes they contain lots

489
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:07,840
 of different components, and it can be hard to separate them. This is a really good study from

490
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:11,600
 this year. It's researchers from Indonesia. Actually, just whether your original fact is from

491
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:17,200
 James, and it's researchers have found a way of taking nappies, used nappies, washing, drying,

492
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:22,800
 sterilizing, shredding them, and then putting them into concrete and mortar. And they have

493
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:29,440
 successfully built a home that is 10% old nappies. Wow. And it's completely sterile. It's

494
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:35,120
 completely... And it can use two cubic meters of used nappies, one single-story home, without any

495
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:40,240
 weakness of structural integrity or anything like that. And it's completely safe. It uses up a load.

496
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:46,080
 I think that is about the amount a baby gets through in a year or two. No, my baby. We could

497
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:52,960
 build half a Milton Key, isn't it? So that's just a trial so far. That's amazing. Even in the UK,

498
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:59,520
 half of the Welsh A487 road is made of 100,000 nappies. Amazing. And they would just recycle it.

499
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:03,200
 I know, plastic pellets that are then part of the road material, and then he tarmac over the top.

500
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:06,560
 So when we were talking about the three little pigs earlier blowing down a shithouse,

501
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:11,760
 that actually could be a reality in the future. We're going to have to wrap up, and it's that,

502
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:20,160
 guys. We are at the end of the party. Yeah, so sorry. It's time. It's time. Yeah. Anything before we do?

503
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:27,280
 You can recycle rare earth metals using fish sperm. We're done. We're done. No one can tell

504
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:32,800
 me that's it. Is that the stuff you get those in your phone, don't you? The rare earth metal, yeah.

505
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:41,760
 This is a thing. You know, "milt" is the technical name for fish sperm, basically. So scientists use

506
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:46,960
 some, again, it's at the experimental stage, it's not widely used. But they made a powder out of

507
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:52,400
 some salmon milk, because that is like largely composed of DNA, which largely is made up of

508
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:57,520
 phosphate, right? And that is, it's charged in a way that it attracts rare earth metals to it.

509
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:00,640
 Cool. So if you put it in a solution with some rare earth metals, because they obviously they're

510
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:06,080
 very important to recycle, and you want to recycle as much as you can, keep it in the system going

511
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:10,400
 around, and if you put it in a solution with some salmon sperm, then it can be extracted. How much

512
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:15,440
 sperm do you need? Like, are we going to have to farm fish and make them ejaculate millions of times?

513
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:18,800
 I think that is the problem of scale in this. You're absolutely right, because it's like a

514
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:23,040
 salmon is quite small, and it is a waste product for the fish industry, but it's not. Not if you're

515
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:29,760
 a Mrs. salmon. How are you getting the milk? Like, how do you collect milk? I'm just asking for a

516
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:32,080
 friend. I don't know. The milk man just comes round.

517
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:45,760
 Okay, that's it. That is all of our facts. Thank you so much for listening. If you'd like to get
