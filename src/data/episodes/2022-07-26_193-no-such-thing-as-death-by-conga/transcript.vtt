00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:19.780
 And welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish" a weekly podcast coming

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.860
 to you from the QI offices in Covern, Darden.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.500
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Anna Chazinski, James Harkin and Andrew

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.940
 Hunter Murray and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:37.420
 facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.300
 Starting with you, James Harkin.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.420
 Okay my fat this week is that it used to be thought that you couldn't testify in court

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.700
 if you'd seen a crime through a window.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.700
 This is such an amazing fact.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:50.700
 This is incredible.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.020
 But it used to be thought but it wasn't the case.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:58.480
 Well it certainly wasn't the case in the late 19th, early 20th century when these news

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:06.280
 reports which were sent to me by a guy on Twitter called Richard Tisdale at Ritchie T1892.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.460
 I think people often put the date they were born as their number don't they?

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.300
 But I don't think he was born in 1892.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.620
 But this would explain why he knows about four cases from the late 20s.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:15.620
 That's true.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.180
 But he sent me a few different articles.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:24.100
 One for instance was an article entitled Extraordinary Belief in Shrewsbury and it was an

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:30.300
 1928 report about this person in Shrewsbury who thought they'd seen a crime but they thought

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.500
 they couldn't really be sure that they'd definitely seen it because it was through a window.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.500
 And he sent me some others.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.140
 There was one in Wolverhampton, one in Lincolnshire, one in Ireland and the Irish one gives

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.580
 a bit of extra material that it might be that this is because old glass used in windows

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.460
 was often warped or blurred so maybe in the olden days you couldn't really see through

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:49.740
 a window very well.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.060
 But then kind of folklore carried on and people actually thought if you saw a crime through

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.660
 a window you couldn't be a reliable witness.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.980
 So always carry out your murders in a greenhouse or?

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.260
 So these people are just people who saw crimes and didn't report them because they were

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.420
 like well my testimony will be useless?

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.620
 Or there were people who were in court and the judge said so did you see the crime and

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.020
 they said well I kind of saw it.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.180
 It was through a window so it might not be true.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.660
 This completely invalidates the film rear window as a plot line.

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:21.660
 Yeah.

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:22.660
 You didn't see anything.

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:23.660
 You didn't see shit.

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:24.660
 What would have happened to me because I wear glasses.

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.140
 I've got two windows on my face.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.140
 You can't see anything.

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.140
 You think you can?

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.140
 Yeah.

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.140
 Wow.

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.140
 It's all those crimes.

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.380
 But it's not the windows were hard to see through because obviously in the very old

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.980
 in days enough until probably about two to times then yeah as you say glass would warp

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.460
 and you couldn't really see probably through a window and I think in ancient Rome when

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.660
 they started making windows out of glass then it wasn't to illuminate a room and it wasn't

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:50.820
 so that you could see through it.

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:56.500
 It was just for decoration and insulation because the glass was so opaque basically.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:02.700
 Maybe it was because of stained glass so people were sort of reporting Jesus's crucifixion

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.900
 and then realizing oh no hang on that's just that's part of the window I'm not going

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:07.900
 to fall for that again.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.180
 I see an actual crime.

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.180
 Yeah.

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:12.180
 No.

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.180
 Yeah.

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.180
 I mean, yeah.

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.180
 It's a theory isn't it?

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:21.220
 We've mentioned before that the Inuit peoples used to use walrus penis membrane as a window.

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.220
 They did.

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.540
 And actually I would be quite annoyed if I was successfully prosecuted for crime I committed

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.380
 through a walrus penis membrane.

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.940
 Because we've seen pictures of these walrus penis membranes and they're not fully transparent

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.940
 they're not I would say they're not even slightly transparent.

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:43.060
 They also made windows out of oyster shells which again they're not transparent at all but

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.300
 they kind of let a little bit of light through same with the membrane actually.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:53.660
 So I don't know when something stops being a wall and starts being a window isn't it?

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:57.860
 For me oyster shells are just on the wrong side of the divide for each their own.

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:02.340
 This is my beautiful new brick window.

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.220
 Did you ever get told off by your parents with the phrase you make a better door than a

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:07.220
 window?

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:08.220
 No.

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.220
 Oh.

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:10.220
 As in you're standing in the way.

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.260
 Basically when I was young and standing in front of the telly in between my parents and

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.820
 the television they would say you make a better door than a window meaning you are opaque.

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:21.780
 But apparently this doesn't now prohibit me from being a window if I choose to be.

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.460
 Why were you standing in front of the TV?

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:29.100
 Were you like look at me, look at me guys, I'm looking at the TV, I'm a performer, I'm playing

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.100
 a door.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:37.700
 I think I was probably closest to the tree for my life to a bit.

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:43.060
 Windows back in the day and I'm talking specifically the year 1590.

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:48.380
 We're very very sort of treasured and they were just for that one year.

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.260
 1590 was the big window year.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:56.580
 Basically if you had windows you treated them almost as a separate object to your entire

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:57.580
 house.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:03.460
 For example there's accounts of people in their wills leaving the house to say the wife

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:07.700
 but the windows to the sun, the family yeah.

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:13.500
 And there's a castle called Annick Castle and again 1590 this is roughly the time this

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:18.180
 was reported when the residents of that castle went on holidays or were just going out for

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:19.180
 a long time.

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.900
 They would take the windows off and store them so that nothing would happen to them while

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:23.900
 they were gone.

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:24.900
 That's ridiculous.

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.420
 So they can't get stolen but I think yeah exactly.

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:31.900
 But then everything else in the building can get stolen because it's nothing in the windows

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.940
 just got empty with their friends.

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:35.940
 You might know this done.

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:37.700
 Do you know why Annick Castle is famous?

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:38.700
 No.

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.700
 It's where they film the first series of Black Adder.

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:43.460
 Oh they also film some of Harry Potter there.

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:44.980
 Did they know?

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:49.500
 But I think it had been famous for quite a few centuries before even Black Adder.

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:53.660
 That's probably why they chose to film there as opposed to no one have ever heard of

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:54.660
 it.

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:55.660
 Yeah.

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:56.660
 How would they find out?

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:00.260
 Do you think that would cause family tension if you inherited the windows and the other person

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:01.260
 inherited the house?

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:02.260
 Yes.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:03.260
 Yeah.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:04.260
 100%.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:05.260
 You'd be like, yeah.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:06.260
 Stop locking through my windows.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:07.260
 Yeah.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:08.260
 Stop living in my house.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.100
 What do you do with them if you don't have a house to attach to?

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:14.220
 I think you just branched your mom that she's cold all the time and there's nothing she

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:15.220
 can do about it.

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:16.220
 Yeah.

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:18.860
 I got some stuff on witnesses and oh yeah.

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:26.520
 In Burma, or as it was, now my mom, in the old days you had to do an oath if you were in

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:27.520
 court.

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:28.520
 You probably still do.

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:34.160
 But the old days it was 370 words long and it was like, I will speak the truth.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:39.860
 If I speak not the truth, may it be that when I and my relations are on land, land animals,

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:45.360
 such as tigers, elephants, buffaloes, poisonous serpents, scorpions, etc. shall seize, crush,

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:48.840
 and bite us so that we will certainly die.

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:54.360
 Let the calamities occasioned by fire, water, rulers, thieves and enemies oppress and destroyers

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:57.280
 till we perish and come to utter destruction.

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:02.760
 May we be seized with madness, dumbness, blindness, deafness, leprosy and rabies and may we be

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:06.520
 struck with thunderbolts and lightning and come to a sudden death.

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:07.520
 Wow.

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:10.560
 I mean, that's worse than swearing on a Bible.

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:11.560
 Yeah, really.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:18.040
 Well, they're more honest in the olden days because they really hit home how bad it was going

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.040
 to be if they weren't.

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.040
 I think so.

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.040
 I mean, that's pretty bad.

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:24.120
 If you tell a lie and all that stuff happens to you and your family.

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:25.120
 Yeah.

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.440
 But then, I mean, it's very easy to refute.

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:29.520
 As soon as one person hasn't had all of those things happen to them and you would have heard

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:33.800
 about it wherever you were if they did, then you go, well, this thing's obviously polyx.

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:38.200
 Yeah, but I guess what that means is that people always must have told the truth, right?

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:39.200
 Right.

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.200
 So in court, they always did.

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:41.200
 Yes.

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:45.960
 In the olden days where the Bible used to in Ireland, you'd have to kiss the Bible, but people

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:50.320
 would just slip their thumb in the way so they kiss their thumb instead of the Bible because

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:53.680
 they were scared, obviously, if they kissed the Bible and told a lie that something bad would

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:54.680
 happen to them.

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:56.960
 I still think something bad will happen to you.

00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:01.400
 I think something bad will happen if you believe in it and you also then get out of it

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:02.400
 by kissing your thumb.

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:03.400
 Do you think so?

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:04.400
 Yeah.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:08.880
 But if you believe in something, you can make other rules up, right?

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:13.040
 Like if you have your fingers crossed behind your back, which is the pivotal scene in the

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:14.440
 Truman show.

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:19.440
 Like she didn't get married to Truman by crossing her fingers behind her back technically.

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:20.440
 That's what she believes.

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:21.440
 Does that have legal basis?

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:25.560
 Well, he's a lawyer in that film, so he would know, and I think yes.

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:26.560
 Is he a lawyer?

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:27.560
 I think you're a lawyer.

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:28.560
 I think you're a lawyer.

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:29.560
 I think you're a lawyer.

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:30.560
 I do.

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:34.600
 Well, but in "Lia-Lia," he had his fingers crossed all the way through, so it shouldn't

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:35.600
 really be called "Lia-Lia."

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:36.600
 That's true.

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:46.800
 OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is my fact.

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:54.280
 My fact this week is that American pioneering explorers Lewis and Clark have been tracked via

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:55.280
 their poo.

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:56.280
 Mm.

00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:00.600
 I mean, we tracked them already via their extremely detailed journals.

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:07.800
 But what was that journal written in that?

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.400
 This is very interesting.

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:14.760
 If by chance you don't happen to know who Lewis and Clark are, they were explorers who

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:20.000
 in 1804 were trying to find a source from the Missouri River to the Pacific, so they went

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000
 on this big track.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:28.280
 It was a 28-month-long track, and along the way, it's a historic track in America, and they

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:32.320
 know many of the spots that they went to, but they don't know exact locations, and they've

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:34.800
 always wanted to find out exact locations.

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:39.680
 Many people have gone out and seen where trees have been chopped down, where all bits of camp

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:40.680
 have been left.

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:44.360
 But many people have explored since then, and so there's no identifiable way of saying

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:47.600
 for sure that that is Lewis and Clark, some 200 years ago.

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:51.960
 So what they have realized, though, is that Lewis and Clark, when they went on this expedition,

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:57.360
 their whole team was taking this special little pill called Kalamel, which was used to treat

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:59.560
 syphilis, but also constipation.

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:03.360
 Because while they were out on these missions, they were eating such raw, weird food.

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:08.120
 They needed to blitz their body of all this stuff in one foul swoop, and so they used

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:09.120
 these.

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:13.160
 And they would take a day to sort of dig a latrine and the entire camp would go into there.

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:14.160
 To dig a latrine?

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:15.160
 Yeah.

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:16.160
 They wanted to come 28 months.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:17.160
 They'd probably need to get toilet.

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.680
 I like the way you said, I don't know if you actually said this, but it sounded like

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:21.160
 you said one foul swoop.

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:22.160
 It did, yeah.

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:23.160
 Yeah.

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:31.920
 That was the pun that I definitely was making, so yeah, thanks for picking that up.

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:38.080
 But I'm missing the main point of this fact, which is inside this pill was mercury.

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:42.120
 And it was mercury that was flushing them out, and mercury doesn't degrade.

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:45.800
 So what they've been doing is going along the tracks and looking for high levels of mercury

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:50.200
 in the ground of these latrines, and they've been finding them, and now they know the exact

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:54.520
 locations of where they were pit-stopping along the way, some 200 years later.

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:56.920
 Their poo mercury is still sitting there in the ground.

00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:57.920
 So cool.

00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:58.920
 Yeah.

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:01.840
 Is that the trace you want to leave on earth, of yourself?

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:03.480
 It's not the only trace they've left.

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:07.440
 As you say, they'd have to credibly detail heroic textbooks and stories and things.

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:10.640
 But syphilis was a massive problem on that trip, wasn't it?

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:14.880
 Because in fact, STDs, generally, because it was Lewis and Clark, and then they had this

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:17.960
 big expedition of people with them, and there was loads of shagging.

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:24.200
 So all the men except Lewis slept with lots of the Native Americans that they found,

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:25.720
 loads of the tribal women.

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:32.040
 And so there was a lot of exchange of STDs, and syphilis came to Europeans from Native Americans,

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:37.880
 and then I'm sure we, in return, gave Native Americans smallpox, smallpox, yeah, and hundreds

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:38.880
 of other things.

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:41.600
 How do we know that Lewis didn't sleep with anyone?

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:45.280
 Because the other people who were on the expedition commented on the fact that he was really

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:46.680
 like a bit.

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:49.520
 He left extremely detailed reports of not having sex with him.

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:50.520
 Yeah.

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:51.520
 That's what I was going to say.

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:53.280
 It sounds like he was in charge of the diary.

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:54.280
 I think...

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:55.280
 Do your wife.

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:57.920
 Everyone but me.

00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:04.040
 Well, these pills were called thunder clappers, because they were so big and so violent in

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:05.720
 the effects they produced on your stomach.

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:06.720
 Yeah.

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:11.520
 Their official name was Dr. Russia's Billious Pills, but they were known as thunder clappers.

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:12.520
 And they were big.

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:15.840
 They were like four times bigger than a normal pill that you might take an aspirin or

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:16.840
 anything like that.

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:17.840
 Wow.

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:22.760
 You guess you just break it in four and then you're okay, but even so, that would look frightening.

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:23.760
 Yeah.

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:24.760
 Coming at you.

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:28.880
 But it was weird, because they were sent off by Jefferson, weren't they?

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:29.880
 Yes.

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:30.880
 He was behind it.

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:33.680
 And he thought they were going to find enormous woolly mammoths instead.

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:34.680
 Yeah, he did.

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:35.680
 And giant sloths.

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:38.000
 Effectively, they were on a big-foot hunt.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.240
 They were looking for cryptids.

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:40.240
 They were looking for mythical...

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:42.080
 Well, they were looking for the Pacific.

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:43.080
 Yeah.

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:44.080
 Were they?

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:45.960
 It sounds like they were looking for woolly mammoths.

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:49.040
 He said you might find some woolly mammoths on your way to the Pacific.

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:50.800
 And if you do, please make nose.

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:53.840
 And he said there was another theory that Jefferson had.

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:56.880
 They might meet a race of Welsh-speaking Native Americans.

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:57.880
 Oh, yes.

00:12:57.880 --> 00:12:58.880
 They did not.

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:01.840
 But they did meet some Native Americans who could swear in English, because they'd met

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:02.840
 traders.

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:03.840
 Yeah.

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:05.320
 One of them ran up and just said, "Son of a bitch."

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:06.320
 Yeah.

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:07.320
 To be really.

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:08.320
 Yeah.

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:10.320
 That was how they knew they were close to the Pacific, in fact, wasn't it?

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:11.320
 Oh, really?

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:14.800
 Really worried they were so lost, America was much bigger than they'd realised, and they

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.160
 weren't getting to the Pacific.

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:20.360
 And then suddenly, they started noticing that the tribe's people, who up until that point

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:25.040
 had never seen a white person before, were suddenly wearing, kind of, British sailors' outfits

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:26.320
 and, like, sailing hats.

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:30.840
 And yeah, all the phrases they knew were, yeah, "Son of a bitch" and all me artis and

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:34.160
 musket and downed rascal and stuff like that.

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:38.640
 And selling t-shirts that said, "My dad went to the Pacific, no, that's not a silly t-shirt."

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:39.640
 Exactly.

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:43.560
 Because that's obviously the only way that they could have come across any white people.

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:44.560
 Yeah.

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:47.800
 Also, they were basically covered in mosquitos all the time.

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:52.240
 The Mosquito clouds were so thick around them that all their meals, they had to eat over

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:54.920
 the smoke of a fire, because obviously mosquitos don't really like that.

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:59.040
 And even then, as they were eating their meat, dozens of mosquitos got in the way, as they

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:00.040
 took huge bite.

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:01.040
 Oh, my God.

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:02.600
 So they were constantly eating mosquitos.

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:07.800
 And Lewis spent a third of his budget on anti-mosquito devices and other things like

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:08.800
 that.

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:09.800
 And they said, "Oh, look at that."

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:10.800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:11.800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:12.800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:13.800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:14.800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:15.800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:16.800
 And they said, "Oh, look at that."

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:17.800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:18.800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:19.800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:20.800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:21.800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:22.800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:23.800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:24.800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:25.800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:26.800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:38.800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:39.800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:40.800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:41.800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:42.800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:43.800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:44.800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:45.800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:46.800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:47.800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:48.800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:49.800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:50.800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:51.800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:52.800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:53.800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:54.800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:55.800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:56.800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:57.800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:58.800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

00:14:58.800 --> 00:14:59.800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:00.800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:01.800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:02.800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:03.800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:04.800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:05.800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:06.800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:07.800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:08.800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:09.800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:10.800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:11.800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:12.800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:13.800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:28.800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:29.800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:30.800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:31.800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:32.800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:33.800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:34.800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:35.800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:36.800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:37.800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:38.800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:39.800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:40.800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:41.800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:42.800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:45.800
 Dear wife, we've definitely only even one dog.

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:49.800
 Oh, just remember, they also dogs accept the one dog

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:51.800
 that there was their Labrador companion along the way.

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:53.800
 Okay, so they brought 200 and one dog.

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:56.800
 It's a different story, isn't it?

00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:58.800
 201 Domations.

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:03.800
 Louis got a shot on the expedition by one of his own men,

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:05.800
 and it was because they were our elk hunting,

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:07.800
 and he was out hunting with his mate,

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:10.800
 who was blind in one eye and very short-sighted in the other,

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:12.800
 and mistook him for an elk.

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:15.800
 And so he fired a musket shot straight through his buttock,

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:18.800
 and so he couldn't sit down with the rest of the trip.

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:20.800
 Apparently, he had to spend the rest of the expedition

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:21.800
 lying face down in the boat,

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:23.800
 because he couldn't let his ass touch the ground.

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:27.800
 You have to be very short-sighted to mistake a man for an elk.

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:29.800
 You do, yeah, yeah.

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:30.800
 It's true.

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:35.800
 But they wore sort of skins and stuff, animal skins.

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:37.800
 So he was dressed as an elk?

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:38.800
 He was dressed up as an elk.

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:40.800
 Maybe he saw an elk and shouted elk,

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:42.800
 and the guy who shot him thought he was an elk.

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:43.800
 Who knew his own name.

00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:44.800
 Yeah.

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:47.800
 [laughter]

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:49.800
 I have some stuff on laxatives.

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:50.800
 Oh, right.

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:51.800
 Cool.

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:53.800
 Do you know in Bingo, they say,

00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:54.800
 "Doctor's Orders?"

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:55.800
 Number nine.

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:56.800
 I do know that.

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:57.800
 You know that, Adam.

00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:58.800
 Yeah.

00:16:58.800 --> 00:16:59.800
 She's a Bingo.

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:00.800
 Huge Bingo fan.

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:02.800
 That's because during World War II,

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:05.800
 number nine was the name of a laxative handed out by medics.

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:06.800
 Really?

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:07.800
 Which I didn't know.

00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:12.800
 And did you know ketchup was originally sold in pill form?

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:14.800
 And they thought it would cure illnesses,

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:17.800
 such as diarrhea, jaundice, and indigestion.

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:20.800
 But actually, they ended up fraudulently making them,

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:22.800
 and instead of putting tomato in them,

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:23.800
 tomato extract in them,

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:26.800
 they just put laxatives in them.

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:27.800
 So basically...

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:29.800
 So it wasn't actually curing?

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:32.800
 No, it was just making people shit themselves.

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:34.800
 And for people who are already suffering from diarrhea,

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:35.800
 that must have been...

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:36.800
 Oh, God.

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:37.800
 Cool.

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:39.800
 So this wasn't ketchup as a food supplement.

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:40.800
 No.

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:41.800
 You wouldn't have your chips,

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:44.800
 and then you'd have the chips on the pill with ketchup.

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:46.800
 No, it was in the old days when they had these things

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:47.800
 called patent medicines.

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:48.800
 Okay.

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:50.800
 You know, things like Seven Up used to be one of those

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:51.800
 Coca-Cola kind of was one as well.

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:52.800
 Right.

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:53.800
 And Dr. Pepper, all these things were...

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:55.800
 And ketchup pills were one of these things

00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:58.800
 that people used to take for just the general illnesses.

00:17:58.800 --> 00:17:59.800
 Wow.

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:00.800
 Yeah.

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:01.800
 That's so cool.

00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:02.800
 And according to Herodotus,

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:07.800
 Egyptians used to spend three days in every month,

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:10.800
 three successive days in every month taking laxatives.

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:11.800
 No.

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:13.800
 That's what Herodotus says.

00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:14.800
 Oh, Herodotus.

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:16.800
 Wasn't either bloke who said there were ants,

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:17.800
 the size of foxes.

00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:19.800
 Yeah, he couldn't have been right about everything.

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:21.800
 Yeah, I reckon about this one.

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:23.800
 But they kind of make sense,

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:25.800
 because they'd feel like they're flushing you out,

00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:26.800
 which actually we've learned is not a good thing.

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:28.800
 It just means it's just another way of saying it massively

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:29.800
 dehydrates you.

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:31.800
 But you can imagine in the olden days they would have thought

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:33.800
 this looks like bad stuff that's coming out.

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:34.800
 That's good.

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:35.800
 Yeah, yeah, definitely.

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:38.800
 They used to be reusable laxatives.

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:42.800
 So one of the most popular laxatives was called antimony,

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:44.800
 which is a chemical element.

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:47.800
 And it worked, and it was used from the 1700s.

00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:49.800
 And it's been used for loads of stuff.

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:51.800
 So I think the Egyptians used it as eyeliner.

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:53.800
 But yeah, it became a really popular laxative.

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:55.800
 Not after it's been used as a laxative.

00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:56.800
 Well, I don't know.

00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:57.800
 You know, they had...

00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:59.800
 You can wash it off, rinse it in the nail.

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:00.800
 Yeah.

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:04.800
 But the good thing about this is that it would stay completely

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:05.800
 intact through your system.

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:07.800
 So it totally flushes out your system,

00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:09.800
 then comes out on your poo, and then you pick it out

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:10.800
 and reuse it later.

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:11.800
 Wow.

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:14.800
 And apparently, according to the source I was reading,

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:16.800
 which was from a university somewhere,

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:20.800
 it said, "Some lucky families pass down antimony laxatives

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:22.800
 from one generation to the next."

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:24.800
 To my wife, I leave the house, to my son.

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:27.800
 I leave the windows, and to my other son.

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:31.800
 I leave my well-used laxative.

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:41.800
 All right, it is time for fact number three.

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:43.800
 And that is Annan.

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:46.800
 My fact this week is that the author's Thomas Hardy,

00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:50.800
 Roger Kipling, and Joseph Conrad have all written books

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:52.800
 the size of postage stamps.

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:54.800
 This was for Queen Mary's Dolls House,

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:57.800
 which is just so cool.

00:19:57.800 --> 00:19:58.800
 And if you haven't seen it, you should.

00:19:58.800 --> 00:19:59.800
 It's a Windsor Castle now.

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:02.800
 But it was commissioned in the 1920s,

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:04.800
 and it was finished in 1924.

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:06.800
 And it was built for Queen Mary,

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:09.800
 who was the wife of George V.

00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:12.800
 And the idea was her cousin's idea.

00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:14.800
 And her cousin, Princess Mary Louise,

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:19.800
 contacted 171 authors to write miniature books for it.

00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:22.800
 So authors who did write books for it were J.M. Barry,

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:25.800
 Chesterton, Conan Doyle, Robert Graves,

00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:28.800
 Huxley, A.A. Milne, E. Dithwater.

00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:30.800
 It was every big writer of the time,

00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:32.800
 wrote a small original novel for it.

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:34.800
 And they were about the size of a stamp,

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:36.800
 about three centimeters by one centimeter.

00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:39.800
 And the only refusal was from George Bernard Shaw, I think.

00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:40.800
 I think there were a few refusals.

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:42.800
 I think Virginia Woolf refused as well.

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:44.800
 She wasn't asked, I don't think.

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:47.800
 Oh, well, she's a counts differ.

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:48.800
 Yeah.

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:49.800
 Well, no, I don't believe it.

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:50.800
 I thought she wasn't asked.

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:54.800
 She was actually, so she, her girlfriend at the time,

00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:56.800
 or lover, was Vita Sackville West,

00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:58.800
 who was us and who did write something.

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:01.800
 And the way I found out about this is that they're just publishing

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:04.800
 the thing that she wrote for the first time in full size.

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:08.800
 And they've realised that the novel that she wrote for this doll's house

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:10.800
 is basically exactly the same as Orlando,

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:14.800
 which was Virginia Woolf's most, well, one of her most famous novels.

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:17.800
 And which Virginia Woolf said she was inspired to write Orlando

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:20.800
 by Vita Sackville West, but we've only just realised,

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:22.800
 she literally was inspired by this idea that Vita had.

00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:23.800
 Well, so hang on.

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:26.800
 Did she, Virginia Woolf, plagiarise an existing novel,

00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:28.800
 but we just didn't know about it because it's too tiny?

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:31.800
 It's the same general idea as this nymphlike person

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:34.800
 who travels through lots of fairy tale landscapes, discovering stuff.

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:37.800
 But it's most definitely, they were very, very in love.

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:41.800
 And Orlando is like this whole love letter to Virginia Woolf's lover.

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:43.800
 And so she was open that she was inspired by her.

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:44.800
 Why?

00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:45.800
 But yeah, it turns out this book is legit.

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:47.800
 Imagine, have we read all the other books just to find out

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:50.800
 if there are any other great books that we don't know about?

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:52.800
 No, I mean, they do have to be quite short.

00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:53.800
 Yeah.

00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:54.800
 How long are they? They're about 30 words.

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:56.800
 Because I could come up with, you know, nymphlike reach

00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:57.800
 travels through fantastical worlds.

00:21:57.800 --> 00:21:59.800
 That's half the words right there, isn't it?

00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:00.800
 Yeah.

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:02.800
 But if someone wrote another book off the back of that,

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:03.800
 I wouldn't feel too hard done by.

00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:05.800
 Because they've really put the hours in.

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:06.800
 Yeah.

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:08.800
 Weirdly, they got about 20 words on a page,

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:09.800
 which I think is really impressive.

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:12.800
 They had to write in very small re- and undy

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:14.800
 are going to write some still on here.

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:17.800
 I'm trying to come up with a box that's three by one centimeter.

00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:18.800
 One centimeter.

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:19.800
 A pardon.

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:22.800
 I think hers was 3.9 by 1.5 centimeters, maybe.

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:23.800
 Yeah, see James is going to be.

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:24.800
 I've just written once upon a time.

00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:25.800
 I know it's a bit of a hack opening,

00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:27.800
 but I've just written it anyway.

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:29.800
 Do you know, I've written exactly the same opening.

00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:31.800
 That is a major isn't it?

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:34.800
 You can see how the Orlando situation happens.

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:36.800
 I mean, we are wildly in love with each other.

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:37.800
 Yeah, that's very true.

00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:38.800
 Yeah.

00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:41.800
 I think I'd be surprised if I could get 20 on there.

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:43.800
 But maybe about 12.

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:45.800
 I've seen photos and they do cram on a lot more.

00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:47.800
 In fact, they even cram detailed drawings.

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:50.800
 A few have been reproduced already.

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:53.800
 Back in 2012, there was an author's book

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:55.800
 who was made a lower print.

00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:56.800
 Andy, you've doubled space jobs.

00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:57.800
 That's a problem there.

00:22:57.800 --> 00:22:58.800
 Yeah, it's funny.

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:00.800
 What did you go for?

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:02.800
 What did you go after once upon a time?

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:04.800
 There was a tiny pony with a nice haircut,

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:06.800
 but then I've run out of ideas.

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:08.800
 What have you got, James?

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:10.800
 Well, mine didn't have quite as nice a haircut.

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:13.800
 But it's really a love letter to you, sir.

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:14.800
 That's right.

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:17.800
 This is an amazing adult house.

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:18.800
 It's incredible.

00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:20.800
 It's all the stories about the rest of the house.

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:23.800
 It was built by Edwin Lutjins.

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:25.800
 Yeah, like the biggest architects,

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:27.800
 probably of the 20th century in Britain.

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:29.800
 And he spent half his time during the construction of this house

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:31.800
 building the city of New Delhi,

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:32.800
 which was 80 square miles.

00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:34.800
 And he spent the other half working on a single doll's house

00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:35.800
 which was five feet high.

00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:36.800
 That's mad.

00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:37.800
 Yeah.

00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:38.800
 So cool.

00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:40.800
 But it was cool, wasn't it?

00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:42.800
 The toilets had working plumbing.

00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:43.800
 It had electricity.

00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:44.800
 It had lifts.

00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:45.800
 That worked.

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:46.800
 The functional lifts.

00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:47.800
 Yeah.

00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:49.800
 It had a cellar with 200 bottles of shuttle,

00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:51.800
 a feet 1875.

00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:52.800
 No.

00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:54.800
 It's so incredible.

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:56.800
 So Dunhill, the cigarette manufacturer at the time,

00:23:56.800 --> 00:24:01.800
 he donated tiny cigarettes and cigars to the house.

00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:02.800
 You know, all these people basically

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:04.800
 it was a huge national project.

00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:05.800
 Because it was going to be the centerpiece

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:07.800
 of the British Empire Exhibition of Arts and Manufacturing.

00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:09.800
 It's a bit like the Millennium Dome.

00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:10.800
 It is.

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:11.800
 Isn't it?

00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:12.800
 It really is.

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:13.800
 Yeah.

00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:14.800
 But it is a bit smaller than that.

00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:16.800
 But aside from that, it is the same.

00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:17.800
 Yeah.

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:19.800
 But do you know the one thing that wasn't in it?

00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:20.800
 Any dolls?

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:21.800
 Really?

00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:22.800
 Yeah.

00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:23.800
 There were no dolls in this doll house

00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:24.800
 because if you put them in,

00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:27.800
 it would grotesquely dispel the enchantment.

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:28.800
 Wow.

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:30.800
 So is it really a doll's house?

00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:31.800
 Good call.

00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:32.800
 Yeah.

00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:33.800
 Yeah, it's just an uninhabited one.

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:34.800
 It's just still on the market.

00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:35.800
 You're right.

00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:37.800
 A house doesn't stop being a house as soon as I leave for the day.

00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:38.800
 Yeah.

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:40.800
 Because they're very solipsistic

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:42.800
 wherever you look at the world.

00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:44.800
 I like the fact that it also contains,

00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:45.800
 as part of its library,

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:47.800
 a stamp album.

00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:48.800
 Yeah.

00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:51.800
 So the stamps are 1/12 the size of actual stamps.

00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:52.800
 So.

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:54.800
 Whereas the books are the size of stamps.

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:55.800
 By the way,

00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:57.800
 if you want to like see all of this stuff

00:24:57.800 --> 00:24:58.800
 and there's so much more,

00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:01.800
 really do go to the Royal Collection Trust website

00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:03.800
 because it just has every single item

00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:05.800
 called ISOM on the in-minute shirt descriptions

00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:06.800
 of where it's come from.

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:07.800
 It's so great.

00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:08.800
 Or go to Windsor Castle.

00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:09.800
 Is it on view to the public?

00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:12.800
 Well, when I went, I saw it years ago when I was a kid, yeah.

00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:15.800
 The weird thing about this place is it was for Queen Mary

00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:17.800
 and she was an adult at the time.

00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:19.800
 It wasn't created for a child.

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:22.800
 And dolls houses weren't originally for children.

00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:23.800
 Really?

00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:25.800
 Oh, there were markers of status.

00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:28.800
 So the first one was made for the Duke of Bavaria in 1557,

00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:30.800
 who was not a child.

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:33.800
 And then later on, about a century or two later,

00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:35.800
 there were things called Nuremberg Kitchens.

00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:36.800
 And these were dolls houses, right?

00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:37.800
 And they had all kinds of stuff of them.

00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:39.800
 They were full of all the household items.

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:42.800
 But they were designed to show young women

00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:44.800
 how to become the lady of the house.

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:47.800
 So it was like that you know there's little military maps

00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:49.800
 that you push little tanks around and the soldiers.

00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:50.800
 Yeah.

00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:51.800
 Which is like a domestic version of that.

00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:53.800
 You say, right, this is how you run the house.

00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:55.800
 This is how you instruct the servants to move around it.

00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:58.800
 This is how you need to run things on a day-by-day basis.

00:25:58.800 --> 00:25:59.800
 Clean here.

00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:01.800
 That was so cool.

00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:03.800
 The purpose of the dolls house in the 17th century.

00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:04.800
 Amazing.

00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:06.800
 It's amazing that they thought that no one

00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:07.800
 would be able to work out a hut,

00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:09.800
 so if you live in a house,

00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:11.800
 it doesn't have to tell them how to do it.

00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:12.800
 I know.

00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:14.800
 Come on, our houses were way more complex.

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:16.800
 If you were living down an abbey or something,

00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:18.800
 you had to know which scholarly you'd find which

00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:20.800
 made to deal with which pan.

00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:22.800
 It was very complex.

00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:24.800
 You know the game, The Sims.

00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:25.800
 One of the biggest games of all time.

00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:26.800
 Love it, right?

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:27.800
 Yeah, awesome game.

00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:29.800
 That started as a dolls house.

00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:30.800
 Really?

00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:31.800
 A real, a physical dolls house.

00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:32.800
 A virtual dolls house.

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:34.800
 It still is a virtual dolls house.

00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:35.800
 Yeah, but so...

00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:37.800
 It started as a men to go on.

00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:43.800
 No, but this very interesting will write the creator of The Sims.

00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:46.800
 He created a virtual dolls house of his house,

00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:50.800
 which he lost during a firestorm in 1991.

00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:53.800
 And he was so upset about losing the memories of his house

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:58.800
 that he created a virtual miniature version of his house on a computer

00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:01.800
 where he just literally replicated all the rooms

00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:03.800
 so he could have a memory of what he once had.

00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:04.800
 Hey.

00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:06.800
 Yeah, and then he saw that and thought, actually, this...

00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:07.800
 This might be something big.

00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:10.800
 And he pitched it to the people who made Sims City

00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:12.800
 and that's how we got to it.

00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:14.800
 He called it his virtual dolls house.

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:16.800
 And did people, whenever they asked him his name,

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:17.800
 and he said, "Will write?"

00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:20.800
 Did they always say, "No, you can just tell us everything about it."

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:23.800
 Some stuff on small books.

00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:24.800
 Yeah.

00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:28.800
 And the smallest book, according to the Guinness Book of World Records,

00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:31.800
 is called Teeny Ted from Turnip Town.

00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:35.800
 And it was made in 2007 by Robert Chaplin.

00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:39.800
 And it's 0.07 millimeters by 0.1 millimeters.

00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:42.800
 And it tells a story of Teeny Ted's victory

00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:45.800
 in the Turnip contest at the annual County Fair.

00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:47.800
 Spoiler alert, sorry.

00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:50.800
 0.07 millimeters.

00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:52.800
 I mean, how is that even possible?

00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:53.800
 Well, it's just small.

00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:56.800
 It's carved into micro tablets

00:27:56.800 --> 00:28:00.800
 on a polished piece of single crystalline silicon

00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:03.800
 using a focused gallium iron beam.

00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:04.800
 And how...?

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:06.800
 It kind of helps.

00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:09.800
 I don't know, science is involved.

00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:11.800
 How are we supposed to read it?

00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:13.800
 Well, I'll just tell you what happens.

00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:15.800
 Well, he did a Kickstarter project

00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:18.800
 or one of those crowdfunding projects.

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:20.800
 And they've printed a large print edition.

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:24.800
 But since then, a Russian guy called Vladimir Anitskin

00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:28.800
 has made a book which is 0.07 millimeters the same

00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:31.800
 by 0.09 millimeters.

00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:34.800
 So it's 0.01 millimeters shorter.

00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:38.800
 And that is a story about a flea's shoes.

00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:39.800
 Really?

00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:40.800
 Yeah.

00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:44.800
 And he plays the finished pages into half of a poppy seed.

00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:45.800
 Wow.

00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:47.800
 That's how small that is.

00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:50.800
 Because it would rattle around in a full poppy seed.

00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:53.800
 And the smallest book I think you can buy in Amazon.

00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:56.800
 Not the best book that you can buy in Amazon.

00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:58.800
 Are there other books available?

00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:02.800
 But the smallest book is called The Smallest Book in the World.

00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:05.800
 And it was from the first September 2001

00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:08.800
 and it measures 2.4 millimeters by 2.9 millimeters.

00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:13.800
 And there is one used copy for 700 pounds.

00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:15.800
 That's so good.

00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:18.800
 Is the picture of it just unbelievably tiny

00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:20.800
 when you see the cover arc?

00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:22.800
 There is a little kind of picture.

00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:24.800
 And there's a picture of a matchstick next to it.

00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:26.800
 And then it says it's the size of this matchstick hat

00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:27.800
 and there's a tie.

00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:30.800
 Oh, the author signings must be an absolute bastard.

00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:33.800
 I'm afraid I'll need a gallium iron cannon.

00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:43.800
 OK, it is time for our final thanks to the show.

00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:45.800
 That is Andy.

00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:49.800
 My fact is that army ant nests are made of other army ants.

00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:52.800
 So this is like a doll's house made of dolls.

00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:54.800
 If I can blind you all with science.

00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:55.800
 Of course, human house made of humans.

00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:56.800
 Terrifying, exactly.

00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:57.800
 Yeah.

00:29:57.800 --> 00:30:01.800
 So they have these weird faces of living in one place.

00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:03.800
 They live in one place while they love it growing.

00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:05.800
 And then they go on the road for a bit.

00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:06.800
 Like a band.

00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:08.800
 They talk to a different place every night.

00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:12.800
 Well, like a band that marches through a jungle eating everything in its path.

00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:13.800
 Yeah, exactly, yeah.

00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:15.800
 So like Erasmith, for example.

00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:18.800
 So they have these three week long roaming faces.

00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:21.800
 And during the roaming phase, every night they form a living colony

00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:25.800
 and a load of the ants link together and create a ball around the queen.

00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:27.800
 And it's got tunnels and it's got chambers,

00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:31.800
 but all the columns and pillars and walls are made of army ants.

00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:32.800
 That's so cool.

00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:33.800
 It's really weird.

00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:34.800
 So they're all alive.

00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:35.800
 They're all alive, yeah.

00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:40.800
 And they have hooks on their feet, which allow them to create these bivouacs as they get called.

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:44.800
 I wonder, do they have, because ants are very specialised in their rules, aren't they?

00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:50.800
 But I wonder if they get to be different parts of the house, like summer sofa ants, summer shower ants.

00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:53.800
 And they're about a half a million in the colony.

00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:57.800
 And they launch these raiding parties, about 200,000, which just fan out and then march.

00:30:57.800 --> 00:30:59.800
 As you say, eating everything in their path.

00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:00.800
 Yeah.

00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:01.800
 Those guys are absolutely incredible.

00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:06.800
 There's like stories of them eating drunk people who've passed out in the middle of a jungle.

00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:09.800
 But I never found any evidence and that's actually true.

00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:13.800
 But they will eat stuff if, you know, if an animal's injured, they'll just go over it and eat it.

00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:15.800
 And they'll just be bones by the end of it.

00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:16.800
 Yeah.

00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:22.800
 There are apparently 557 associates to an army ant march,

00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:27.800
 by which I mean animals that kind of feed off them or are helped by them.

00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:34.800
 So you've got mites who live on the ants, you've got birds who eat any insects that are running away from the army ants.

00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:38.800
 You've got butterflies who follow them eating their droppings.

00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:43.800
 Yeah, more than 500 different species are following these ants around, living off them.

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:49.800
 But there's actually a new species that's been found, that is one of these 500 I guess,

00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:52.800
 which is a new species of beetle that's been found in Costa Rica.

00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:59.800
 And it bites onto an army ants bum and pretends to be a second bum and hitches a ride.

00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:01.800
 And that's how it travels.

00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:05.800
 And so you look at this army ant and scientists look at this army ant and we've got two arses,

00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:06.800
 what a weird species of ant.

00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:10.800
 And it's actually just this guy who's got his teeth embedded in his bottom.

00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:14.800
 But surely it's not convincing to pretend to be a second bum.

00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:15.800
 Why not?

00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:17.800
 Because I don't know anyone who's got two bum.

00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:19.800
 You're not, I don't know.

00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:20.800
 No, I guess not.

00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:25.800
 And also ants, I suppose they can't really turn around and look at that own bum.

00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:26.800
 No.

00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:29.800
 So they're just going to think they've put on a bit of weight down there.

00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:30.800
 That's true.

00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:31.800
 And they're also really polite.

00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:33.800
 So if they say, "Does my bum look okay in this?"

00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:35.800
 They all just tell each other, "Yeah, that was great."

00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:36.800
 Which one?

00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:42.800
 Here's another weird thing that they do.

00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:43.800
 This is army ants.

00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:45.800
 Have you guys heard of an ant mill?

00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:46.800
 I've never heard of this before.

00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:47.800
 No.

00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:51.800
 This is when army ants are in a big group of army ants are going out.

00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:55.800
 And what it said is when they're blind.

00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:56.800
 So I don't know how--

00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:57.800
 They're all blind.

00:32:57.800 --> 00:32:58.800
 Ah, okay, right.

00:32:58.800 --> 00:32:59.800
 So they're all blind.

00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:00.800
 Thank you.

00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:01.800
 That makes so much sense of this now.

00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:03.800
 It's what is, they lose the pheromone track of where they're on.

00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:05.800
 So one of them leads them astray.

00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:06.800
 And they all head off.

00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:08.800
 And then suddenly they're lost as a pack.

00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:11.800
 But then what they start to do is follow one another.

00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:13.800
 And it eventually turns into a circle.

00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:17.800
 And they're just walk in a circle till they die of starvation.

00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:20.800
 Basically, it's just a continuous circle where they think they're walking back.

00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:23.800
 It's like being in a conga, but the back of the conga joins the front of the conga.

00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:24.800
 Yeah.

00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:25.800
 And you just conga until you all die.

00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:26.800
 Exactly.

00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:27.800
 It's a very sad way to go.

00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:28.800
 Do it, do it.

00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:31.800
 I mean, it's not a sad way to go.

00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:32.800
 Is it happiest?

00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:33.800
 Is that happiest that way?

00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:34.800
 I think I wouldn't want to go to that wedding.

00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:37.800
 People always say what's the best way of dying.

00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:41.800
 You know, like some people say there are some ways of dying where you have like euphoria

00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:43.800
 just before you die, isn't there?

00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:47.800
 You think the conga is the happiest way?

00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:48.800
 Well, it's quite happy.

00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:50.800
 Is it how you would want to go?

00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:52.800
 Absolutely.

00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:57.800
 Or death by, you know that one where you sit down on the dance floor and pretend you're rowing about.

00:33:57.800 --> 00:33:58.800
 Oh, that's a great move.

00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:00.800
 Maybe it oops up side your head.

00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:01.800
 Oh yeah.

00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:02.800
 That's a good way to go.

00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:04.800
 Because you're doing the conga thing, but you're also sat down.

00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:06.800
 So you're a bit more comfortable.

00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:07.800
 Yeah.

00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:09.800
 The aunts don't do that one, though.

00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:11.800
 And they don't have the music for the conga line.

00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:13.800
 I do think it's quite a bad way to go.

00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:15.800
 That's a real tragedy, actually.

00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:16.800
 Tragedy.

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:18.800
 Now that dance would be a good one.

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:19.800
 Yes.

00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:22.800
 Now aunts do sometimes make noises, though.

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:26.800
 Not music and not 90s pop hits, but they do make noises.

00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:31.200
 You listen closely they're going, "Hey, macaro, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."

00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:37.800
 There's an ant nest beetle which can speak three different dialects of ants depending on which nest it goes into.

00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:46.800
 So they do it by stridulation which means you're kind of rubbing one body part on the other, but they know three different dialects and they'll go into a nest and pretend to be that ant.

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:51.800
 But if they get the that accent slightly wrong, the other ants kill them and eat them.

00:34:51.800 --> 00:35:00.800
 So that's like kind of going to a bar and new castle and speaking with a jordy accent and they realise it's not a jordy accent and then they kill you and eat you.

00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:06.800
 So actually, I mean it's a different language, it's like going to a bar in France and speaking with the wrong French accent, it's terrifying.

00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:10.800
 Yeah, weirdly so that was a beetle that speaks these different accents, right?

00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:18.800
 Yeah. So there are other beetles who have evolved to look like army ants so they can sneak in to the army ant nests.

00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:28.800
 So they have developed a gland which can squirt a chemical at the ants and blast them out of the way so it allows them to make their escape if they're ever rumbled by the ants.

00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:32.800
 But these beetles spend their whole lives living in the colony.

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:35.800
 You spend your whole life surrounded by a hostile species.

00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:43.800
 And it looks ridiculous, right, because they're blind so they don't know but to us when you see pictures of it, it's just like that's obviously not one of you guys.

00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:50.800
 I didn't realise they were blind, I just thought the answer was stupid, I didn't know that. But actually that explains why they couldn't see that they had two bumps.

00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:59.800
 Yeah, so that one little detail is real so much about the fact that it does my bum lock good in this, I don't know why I'm blind.

00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:06.800
 They do have, when they find meat, they transport it to what they call a booty cash so that kind of fits the bump thing.

00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:09.800
 They don't call it that, no, that's a good point, yeah.

00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:18.800
 So something they can do with their bodies, which is really clever, is that they plug any holes in the ground or any obstacles and this speeds up their progress anywhere.

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:28.800
 But they're really smart about it, so as they're going along in these big troops of hundreds of thousands of ants, they'll come across a little hole or a tiny little bump that maybe we couldn't even see.

00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:34.800
 And they measure up their bodies as they go past to see which of them is the right size for the whole.

00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:42.800
 And the right size and will play out over that hole and spend hours while the other ants just go back and forth over him if they're collecting or anything.

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:49.800
 And scientists have literally, they've drilled slightly different size holes in a plank of wood and they watch the ants go and they measure themselves up against the hole.

00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:52.800
 They're like not too big for that one, Barry, you're on this.

00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:55.800
 And the different size ants go and then spend hours spread out over these holes.

00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:59.800
 It's a bit like lemmings, the game, isn't it? Do you remember that game?

00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:05.800
 And you would have holes and they all did different things to get you past those holes, but then everyone would just keep marching over you and stuff.

00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:06.800
 Really?

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:07.800
 Just like that.

00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:08.800
 Yeah, maybe they'd based on that.

00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:10.800
 But do you think they like it?

00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:13.800
 Or do you think they get to a hole and they go, "Oh, that's the same size as me."

00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:17.800
 Yeah, I think it's that. They try to, they sound tipters and go, "No, I'm definitely too tall for this one."

00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:18.800
 No.

00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:22.800
 But they do, they do get, they're all blind.

00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:30.800
 But you can feel it. You can feel the size of a hole. So can I just say, not all army ants are blind.

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:31.800
 Oh, not?

00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:35.800
 There are lots of different species of them and the ones that have the ant mills are blind.

00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:37.800
 But not all species are.

00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:41.800
 Is there sometimes a big hole that the beetle has to get into?

00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:43.800
 That's when he's gone blind.

00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:51.800
 It's very cool though, because if you're sitting in the hole,

00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:55.800
 you don't get to get any of the food that the ants find you, you don't get any prey.

00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:57.800
 But they save you some when you get home.

00:37:57.800 --> 00:37:58.800
 Come on.

00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:01.800
 They get a meal when they get back because for the work they've done for the colony.

00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:04.800
 That is the least they can do, I think.

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:09.800
 So some ant nests, these are not army ants now, but these are, this is a different species of ant.

00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:12.800
 It's actually called the hairy northern wood ant.

00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:18.800
 Some of their ant nests have essentially listed building status in the UK.

00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:22.800
 The British Forestry Commission have mapped and said these must be preserved.

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:26.800
 And it's a little skyscraper city of ant nests, up to two meters high,

00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:32.800
 made by ants, which is bigger relative to an ant than the Empire State Building is to a human.

00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:37.800
 Yeah, and they're all made of pine needles and there are 69 of them which have been found and plotted.

00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:42.800
 And they are basically preserved because the British Forestry Commission have said

00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:44.800
 you have to look after these.

00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:46.800
 So you can't build a conservatory on anything?

00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:47.800
 No, you can't.

00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:48.800
 No.

00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:50.800
 But who's going to stop an ant if it was to make a conservatory?

00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:51.800
 That's true.

00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:53.800
 They're not going to get flat information.

00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:57.800
 But actually, conservatory would be really good for them because they need, no, it would.

00:38:57.800 --> 00:38:59.800
 Because they need heat, right?

00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:03.800
 And the way that the ants get heat is some of the work rats will go outside,

00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:08.800
 some days for a bit, soak up heat, and then quickly go back in and release the heat into the nest.

00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:10.800
 And that's their method of warming up their nest.

00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:12.800
 So conservatory would be much better for them.

00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:13.800
 Yeah.

00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:18.800
 Well, and they're farmers, aren't they? A lot of ants are farmers, so conservatory would be great for growing their food.

00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:22.800
 There are a lot of ants that can't bite into seeds because their teeth aren't strong enough.

00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:23.800
 Their mandal's aren't strong enough.

00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:26.800
 And so instead, what they do is, which is a really long-witted way of getting a meal,

00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:29.800
 is that they plant the seeds, they fertilize them with their own feces,

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:32.800
 they wait for them to grow germinate and split for the huster split,

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:34.800
 and then they can eat the stuff inside.

00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:35.800
 Wow.

00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:37.800
 Which is quite a long time to wait if you're really hungry.

00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:38.800
 Others, yeah.

00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:40.800
 You've got to plan your dinner parties well in order.

00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:45.800
 And did you guys know that ants' mandal bills used to be used, and still are used,

00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:48.800
 I think, in bits of East Africa, to stitch up wounds.

00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:53.800
 They get an ant, and the mandal bills are just the right size of certain ants to heal up a wound,

00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:59.800
 and then they make an ant bite into the sides of a wound, of a cut,

00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:02.800
 and then the sort of little teeth will pull the skin together,

00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:07.800
 and then they cut the ants body away, and the teeth just sit there healing up the wound.

00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:10.800
 So they decapitate the ant once it's acted as a stitch.

00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:13.800
 It's actually more like deboditating than I think.

00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:15.800
 Because you're traveling the body off of it.

00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:17.800
 The effect is much the same.

00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:18.800
 Yeah.

00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:19.800
 That's just semantics.

00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:21.800
 Great news, don't worry.

00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:27.800
 We've managed to get your sentence commuted from decapitation to deboditation.

00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:33.800
 Andy, do you have a relative in North Carolina called Joan?

00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:34.800
 Not that I know.

00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:38.800
 Okay. I was reading the story, a lady called Joan Murray, in America.

00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:43.800
 She went parachuting, skydiving, and this is extraordinary.

00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:47.800
 Her parachute didn't open, so she plummeted to the earth.

00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:51.800
 She approached the ground at 80 miles an hour, and as she landed,

00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:54.800
 she landed on a mound of fire ants.

00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:57.800
 And doctors reckon, I got this off Wikipedia,

00:40:57.800 --> 00:41:02.800
 doctors reckon that the shock of having been stung over 200 times by the ants,

00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:05.800
 as she landed on them, released a surge of adrenaline into her

00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:09.800
 that kept her heart beating so that when the emergency services got there,

00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:11.800
 and she's still alive to this day.

00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:12.800
 Wow.

00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:13.800
 Wow.

00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:16.800
 I wouldn't have thought, hitting into the ground after your parachute not opening.

00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:19.800
 I wouldn't have thought that the thing that killed you would be a heart attack.

00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:20.800
 Yeah.

00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:24.800
 I would have thought it would be the crunching up of all of your bodily bones in organs.

00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:27.800
 But if you landed on a mound.

00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:28.800
 Yeah.

00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:30.800
 And then they repaired all your wounds with their mandibles.

00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:31.800
 Yes.

00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:33.800
 They stitched you as you land.

00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:35.800
 Do you think they all basically caught her, maybe?

00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:36.800
 Yeah, effectively.

00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:39.800
 I guess you do have accounts of people falling on, I don't know,

00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:42.800
 trees and hay bales and stuff like that and managing to survive.

00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:47.800
 So supposedly she did her heart stopped, and then she got bit so many times.

00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:54.800
 I think it's stories like this that the phrase citation needed was invented.

00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:55.800
 No, I do believe that.

00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:56.800
 They do actually say they don't.

00:41:56.800 --> 00:42:01.800
 They don't often, if you're falling out of a building or something, that what.

00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:04.800
 I'm going to aim for that.

00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:10.800
 And so so strong relative to their body size.

00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:13.800
 From this height, all those people look like us.

00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:19.800
 I know, I'm one foot away from the floor.

00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:21.800
 They don't say any of that.

00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:25.800
 They just say that you have a heart attack on the way down off and that kills you.

00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:26.800
 Do they?

00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:27.800
 Yeah, yeah, I think they do.

00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:28.800
 So it is plausible.

00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:29.800
 Wow.

00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:30.800
 Not sort of stupid facts.

00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:33.800
 Do you guys want so busy mocking what I've said before?

00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:40.800
 I might have stepped in to save you earlier.

00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:42.800
 Okay, that's it.

00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:43.800
 That is all of our facts.

00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:45.800
 Thank you so much for listening.

 It's a wrap-up of the weirdest stuff that happened in 2017.

00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:33.800
 And it's good.

00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:34.800
 I've read it.

00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:35.800
 I like it.

00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:36.800
 And I think you will too.

00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:37.800
